4596657,5,B0057J5BMG,"When I first saw the previews for these movies, I thought they looked stupid.
However, after watching them both with my 3 year old son, I changed my mind.
Jack Black's presence in these movies gives them a level of awesomeness that
would be completely absent if he was not Po.  Both movies are equally funny
and engaging for my son and, surprisingly, for me as well.  While a lot of the
animated movies he watches drive me batty after 20+ showings, I'll sit and
watch these movies with him any time they are on.  I like the music, the CGI is
fantastic, and the attention to detail is second-to-none, especially during
the fight scenes.  The HD versions on Bluray are a must if you have a player.

As a side note, I also like Dustin Hoffman as Shifu.  His character adds a
lot to the movies, and his delivery is brilliant.

These movies are clean, and so far, there aren't any scenes that scare my
son.  I hope they make a 3rd installment.",1326067200,,938,4.350574712643678
4596658,5,B0057J5BMG,My daughter fell in love with Kung Fu Panda after watching it once on TV - sort of a violent movie but has good lessons and enjoyable even for adults.,1326067200,,150,4.033333333333333
4596659,5,B0057J5BMG,"Have you ever watched a movie where you had to watch it again multiple times within a day or a week, well I got Kung Fu Panda fever.  I love this movie, great character development, plot and ending that makes a father and son want to cry together. And it sets up the movie perfectly for a sequel.  Four more from what I heard.

4596666,5,B0057J5BMG,"I was finally able to watch the first KFP in its entirety and I have to say, I was thoroughly impressed. I was also skeptical with the second KFP but again, I was blown away by the plot, the storyline and how it was carried out. I felt that the second one dug a little deeper into something that was more intimate that I could definitely relate my life to. I appreciated both the creative aspects of both films and how detailed each one was. Very heartwarming masterpieces and will be in my movie collection forever.",1443052800,,516,4.385416666666667
4596667,5,B0057J5BMG,"Kung. Fu. Panda. Enough said! Delightful story with comedic elements. And the second begins to bring in some back story for Po, the main character. And some hints of back story for Tigress: would love to see more on that too. Both movies have excellent direction, visualization and music.

4596700,2,B0057J5BMG,"The beginning of this movie scared my toddler niece. I like the story of Po in Kung Fu Panda,but the presentation in the beginning of the DVD is Horrendous. If you are Christian minded or come from a Christian background,Beware! You will not like the start of this movie. My sis and hubby who attend church every Sunday,felt some trauma was done to my 2 year old niece. I feel bad about not watching it,before popping it in for her to watch. I understand that all kids are not the same,but honestly,even i was troubled by the start of this movie myself. After the beginning,my niece wanted nothing to do with this movie. My opinion to anyone out there,this may suit pre-teens and older,but toddlers might not enjoy this,especially if you are a parent that pop in a dvd to leave your kids to be entertained. Think twice before doing that. Just my personal good intent advice to any parent or guardians out there. Lesson learned for me. You never know how children may react to certain things.",1419552000,,991,4.573033707865169

4596713,5,B0057J5BMG,"""one of the best movies of the year"" as rated by Ebert & Roeper. Leonard Maltin says that this is ""a delightful movie..."". Po, a panda, goes on a vision quest to discover his inner warrior. Awesome animation, all-star voice cast, and action packed humor is how to best describe this collection. Time magazine calls this ""ultra satisfying entertainment..."". This also includes a new adventure called ""Secrets of the Masters"". Po and the Furious Five meet the legendary Rhino, Ox, and Croc. This is an excellent choice!",1408924800,,517,4.954022988505747
4596714,5,B0057J5BMG,"What can I say? I'm a movie freak. I am in love with all kinds of movies, and animation has to be my favorite. I have been very interested in the Kung Fu Panda series ever since I first saw the trailer all those years ago. Superbly written stories, wonderful voice acting in these movies and I just could not beat the price. This double feature is a work of art and deserves to be in your collection whether you like action, comedy, or just have a child in the house that loves to watch movies. This is a great gift for everyone. Also includes the short film ""Secrets of the Masters"" which is great in its own way. The packaging is nice and colorful and has some excellent detail, letting you know just how much effort was put into just the art on this set. If you are looking for eye cand on your big new HD tv, look no further! These movies are stunning, with a massive attention to detail, crisp imagery without any signs or blemishes or color bleeding, the black levels of these films are deep and rich, overall just an amazing Blu-ray transfer. If you, or your child are a fan of the series, you absolutely need to add this set to your collection.",1407801600,,1152,4.264840182648402

character unto himself and life lessons are learned as the Panda demonstrates through his life experiences.  We watch as the main
character makes mistakes, but also learns from his mistakes to overcome obstacles and reach goals he has set for himself.  Kung Fu Panda 1 & 2 are definitely worth watching with the whole family!",1402272000,,468,4.406976744186046

4596724,5,B0057J5BMG,"As a Senior I find these movies fun and a great departure to the ""Shoot-em-ups"" of the action/advent genre we see all to often.  Too much these days we see too much of the latter that doesn't add to story content.  Kung Fu Panda starts with a dream and grows on it showing desire and determination.  In the second movies his confidence builds but one can never forget the bond between him and his Father, truly touching.  I also enjoy watching the actors doing the voice overs, they look like they are having fun bringing life and personality to these characters, a joy to watch.",1389830400,,579,4.485714285714286

Fun times for the entire family but more for the kids. They have quickly learned the Kung Fu moves and they are asking to sign up for martial arts classes. I guess that is good!

4596768,1,B0057J5BMG,The audio for Panda 2 will randomly cut out. To fix it we have to restart the movie. Very annoying. Amazon will only provide a partial refund and we have to pay shipping. Not worth it. Amazon is usually great but very disappointed in this purchase and with Amazons lack of customer service for this product.,1337904000,2,307,4.5

It is one of the few movies I have purchased sight-unseen and I am very happy.  I even loved the bonus feature, although I was slightly disappointed with it.  It didn't carry the same ""epicness"" that KFP and KFP2 seemed to have.  All in all, though, a very good deal and a great buy.",1331510400,,420,4.1234567901234565

4596780,5,B0057J5BMG,"Kung Fu Panda is the story of a panda, Po, who loves the art of Kung Fu.  He's a big fan of the Furious Five, a group of elite fighters who are schooled in Kung Fu.  The movies follow his adventures as he becomes the (unlikely) leader of this group of fighters (the Dragon Warrior).

In the first movie, we follow his adventures as he become the Dragon Warrior and defeats Tai Lung, an imprisoned ""dark side"" kung fu master.

In the sequel, Po and the Furious Five continue their exploits in defending China.  An odd moment battling an opponent gives Po a sudden flashback to memories he has long forgotten, leaving him dumbstruck.  It turns out that an evil opponent, Lord Shen (Gary Oldman in a movie stealing performance), is building a weapon to end Kung Fu and result in the total domination of China.  Turns out that Lord Shen, though, was warned (via prophecy) that he would be defeated by a ""black and white"" warrior, and he fears Po (though Jack Black's comical portrayal of him leads Lord Shen to take the prophecy lightly).

In the end, I feel that both movies are extremely strong and represent the rare case where someone besides Disney delivers the animated goods!  Overall, great!-

As an aside, the first product I received was defective and skipped like crazy.  Thankfully, Amazon is really great about replacements, so I am hoping this is an isolated issue.",1326931200,,1381,4.637860082304527
