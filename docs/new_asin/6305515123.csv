7890805,1,6305515123,"I watched this movie just last night, or at least I tried to...

The acting is terrible, except for the two leads, who weren't too bad. I'm not a big fan of horror, preferring to get my scares through the old-fashioned way where a frightening scene is actually scary, not just bloody.

The underwater scenes, I will admit, were quite good, but that's all the good I can see in this film. As for the rest of it...

I'll just leave this with one more comment about so-called scary movies:

7890806,4,6305515123,I watched Lady of the lake and was very impressed by the overall quality of that production. That movie was also featured on a pay-per-view TV station in Montreal in French and in English. It's great to see a Montrealer having it's own production being sold on Amazon.com.

Visually the film is stunning...considering the 'budget' the director had...special effects are 'mindboggling'...storyline is so-so (but ,hey I've seen worse)and some of the performances are solid (especially Michette who plays the 'deranged next door neighbor'...this guy's performance is a 'hoot').Kudo's to the director Richard Deveraux",996624000,3,544,5.411764705882353

IT TURNED OUT TO BE A REALLY  DECENT MOVIE...THE MAKE-UP WAS EXCELLENT AND I LIKED THE FACT THAT THE  MOVIE ACTUALLY HAD A PLOT TO GO ALONG WITH THE SCARES...IT WAS A SCREAM !  [EXCUSE THE PUN]...I LOVED THE ENDING TOO!",966556800,2,400,4.089743589743589

This movie was  not scary at all!  The reason I rented this video was the great special  effects the movie supposely had from what the cover said.",963360000,2,492,4.127659574468085
