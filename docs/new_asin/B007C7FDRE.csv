5076847,4,B007C7FDRE,"The staging is at such a spectacular scale, with impressive structure and grand painting. The diverse range and detail of costumes are jaw dropping, apparently the dancers are having a lot of fun wearing them, but there would be tons of logistic and laundry involved before and afterwards.

The orchestra is very strong with beautiful DTS5.1 sound, the music and dance style ranges from typical european, to Arabic, Persian, Flamenco, etc, are fun to watch.

I found the dancers are pretty good, I also like the facts that there are quite some young dancers. Some people complain about occasional piano popping on the right side of screen, I actually like it.

Now for the negative part, the weakest part to me is the thin story, which doesn't give the leading dancers opportunity to show emotion, as well as technical skills, a good ballet is supposed to be a combination of orchestra, staging, costumes, technical skill, emotions, some of them are sadly lacking in this production, which makes the whole package inconsistent. There are tons of dance but don't seem to serve any purpose.

It's also quite long for such a simple story to take about two and half hour. I have to admit all those dances are fun to watch.",1369353600,2,1218,4.785714285714286
5076848,5,B007C7FDRE,Just beautiful! The music is absolutely glorious.  The ballerina is stunning. Costumes and sets are fantastic!  Fall in love with story ballets all over again!,1366329600,3,159,5.32
5076849,5,B007C7FDRE,"I am very impressed by this performance. Novikova in the title role was excellent. The costumes were very colorful. The sets were elaborate as one would expect from this venue. The booklet claims this is a reconstruction of a performance from 1898. I can't vouch for the accuracy.
I find the orchestral execution quite good. The sound and picture quality are very good. This performance runs 2 1/2 hours. There are no extra features.

I have an issue with the final act. During the lovely variation that Raymonda performs the screen is split for about 60 seconds. Novikova is seen on the left and a piano keyboard is on the right. This is a distraction. I don't even think pianophiles would like this since it is not a bravura passage. This is only for 60 seconds in a 2 1/2 hour ballet but it happens at a bad place. Overall I still have to award this 5 stars.",1364169600,4,861,4.449367088607595
5076850,4,B007C7FDRE,"Since I received the La Scala Raymonda (2011) I have been doing a Raymonda binge. I've been playing each of the several versions I have several times each. This way I have compared and contrasted each version and evaluated the lot of them and my reaction to them over a period of time. The La Scala is the latest and purports to be a recreation of the original choreography of M. Petipa to the music of A. Glazunov. Marius Petipa is the grand ringmaster of classical ballet as we know it. He did over 50 choreographic productions including the three Tchaikovskys, a version of Giselle, Paquita, Don Quixote, Raymonda, La Bayadere etc. etc. The music for this one was done by the then unknown Aleksandr Glazunov and it remains as one of the most noted of his works. As noted by other reviwers the story line is very thin and is based on a tale from the Bordeaux region of France about a knight from there who joins a Hungarian King Andrei II in the First Crusade. Before going off he gives the beautiful Raymonda a white veil as a pledge of his love. He leaves to do his knightly stuff and she stays and awaits his return. Now if you have not seen the Petipa original as presented here by the La Scala or haven't read a detailed synopsis and are seeing the ballet for the first time you will not have any idea what is going on. The several versions e.g. 1982 Bolshoi, have cut out much of the mime works that fill in the story line. With the La Scala version you see a Medieval setting and costumes and following the giving of the veil you see the girl bewildered by all this and doubts appear in her mind. But now the mime of the White Lady (in the French legend she is the patron saint and protectress of betrothed young maidens)comes off her pedistal and we have the beautiful dream sequence. In it Raymonda is confronted by a young verile seductive Muslim prince who awakes a certain temptation in her. More dancing. More dancing. Then the Muslim prince Abderakhman comes back, gets excited and tries to abduct Raymonda. At this moment our hero the knight Jean de Brienne and the King arives back. The two men (knight & Muslim prince) duel for Raymonda but the White Lady intervenes and the Muslim prince is killed. Raymonda is repulsed and Jean has to court her again with greater sincerity. He succeeds and the wedding is celebrated by Hungarian style celebration and dance. This is the famous Pas Classique Hongrois or Pas de Dix. All of this is spelled out in the La Scala disc as Petipa originally conceived it. However though Petipa gave more to do for the men than in most other ballets of his time there is not much for the two men to do but fight. This is the 1898 version as contained on this disc. It is in many ways quite dated and has about as much drama as a street dance but at least you know the story. Over the years many revisions have been made adding more things for the men to do and adding new music. Of the several versions I've reviewed my favorite is the 1982 release of the ballet done at the Bolshoi. This has the superb Ludmila Semenyka as Raymonda with highly acrobatic solos for the Jean de Brienne of Irek Moukhamedov (a tall statuesque man) and for the Abderakham of Gedeminas Taranda. The stremlined choreography is by Yuri Grigorovich. But alas in this version the story is incomplete and confusing. The White Lady appears but fades off. Adding new things to choreography and music to replace some of the less inspired sections of the original has gone on for years. Some of the best are by Nureyev and Grigorovich with new music by John Lanchbery and others. I think you need this beautiful disc with its great features of Blu-Ray for color and accuracy of faces etc and the 1982 Bolshoi for total beauty of dance.
I must take off one star for the La Scala corps. As has been said before they are-in a word-sloppy! Not just in this recording for I have seen them in person, in DVDs of operas and other ballets. Sloppy! They need to emulate the corps of the Paris Opera ballet (I think the best corps) or the two Russian companies. Why can't the La Scala corps move together. But then asking anyone at La Scala to cooperate with anyone else at La Scala is like herding cats.",1358812800,10,4211,4.420849420849421
5076851,3,B007C7FDRE,"I was thrilled to see a new release on blu ray of one my favorite ballets shown as a pre-order. There are two versions already on dvd: One by the Bolshoi Ballet and one by the Paris Opera Ballet. They are both excellent but being on standard dvd the video quality cannot compare to blu ray. Watching ballet at home on my HD TV has replaced going to see it live as the admission tickets are priced for the rich these days. $25 being the cheapest(that's the highest I ever paid for an orchestra seat)to $125. Add to that having to drive to the theater, find parking, annoying people seating near you talking or coughfing. I don't think so.
So I waited with anticipation and decided to check if YouTube had any highlights and they did. I watched the solos with lovely Olesia Novikova and was delighted. Until I saw the Act III pas de Action(which is the leading couple's pas de deux with 6 couples behind them, that makes it a pas de action). Traditionally this dance is performed wearing beautiful short tutus that may have some details to give them a hungarian touch. But in this production all couples wear costumes that look out of La Sylphide or even native american. what's with the purse on the ladies' skirts and the feather on the leading ballerina's head? Why did they have to ruin this beautiful production with this humongous mistake? For this reason alone, I will pass on adding this blu ray dvd to my ballet collection. I'll wait until another company will record a performance in high def. I hope it will happen in this century.",1341705600,5,1540,4.523297491039426
5076852,5,B007C7FDRE,"This ballet was written in 1898 with choreography by Petipa. At that time the fashion was for medieval settings featuring spectacular pageant set-piece displays by the corps de ballet as the main focus of attention. It is important to realise that this production aims to be a recreation of the original and should only be considered on that basis therefore.

In order to faithfully recreate the original 1898 concept an enormous amount of care and expense has been lavished on this production and much research and time has been spent investigating and studying the original illustrations and instructions as regards costuming, staging and choreography. The final results can only be described as being a total success and as such completely recreate an earlier age in ballet history.

The set piece corps de ballet scenarios in this production are totally impressive in both delivery and panoramic effect when seen with the 1898 concept in mind. The camera work supports this by giving a greater viewing time than usual to whole-stage imaging rather than close-ups. This seems to me to faithfully match the visual intentions of the original choreographer. In general terms the courtly dances are more sedate and contrast with the more energetic dances performed by the rest of the population.

The relatively limited amount of solo time is well danced in my opinion with the main focus naturally concentrating on guest artist Olesia Novikova in the title role of Raymonda. The camera work illustrates her technical skills by picking out some details of her footwork in addition to the normal coverage. However, these examples of detailed technical focus did not bother me in contrast to some others. In my opinion they should not be exaggerated as they take up a very small part of the total viewing time.

The imaging quality is excellent throughout with not a trace of movement blur. Colours are rich and faithfully reproduce the sumptuous costumes and scenery. The sound is clear and accurately reproduces the sound world of Glazunov and is presented in DD 5.1, DTS 5.1 and stereo.

Since 1898 there have been revisions which have changed the emphasis of this ballet towards more active display and which may be more appealing for different reasons. However that is not the concern of this production which has aimed instead to recreate precisely Petipa's original concept of 1898. It would therefore be both unreasonable and wrong to criticise this production for lacking the alternative attractions of later versions.

In summary this is a fine reproduction of Petipa's original 1898 concept. This is the production's stated specific intention and to that end it succeeds as well as could be expected. On its own terms I personally believe it to be fully worthy of 5 stars and on those terms alone it should give ample satisfaction to many viewers.

Another even-handed and interesting Review, Ian!
Thank you.. (U.K. review)",1341619200,10,3047,5.164300202839756
5076853,4,B007C7FDRE,"This DVD of Raymonda hails to be a revival of Petipa's 1898 choreography, done by Sergei Vikharev. Allegedly, the costumes and sets have also been recreated.

With several additional mime scenes, the plot of Raymonda is now easier to follow, though it is still the same, thin plot as in other productions. The costumes and sets are all brightly colored and dazzling to the eye. Choreographically, I think this ballet is dated, and the dozens of character and corps de ballet dances tend to bore the viewer.

As for the dancers, Olesia Novikova is absolutely stunning, the ideal of a Russian ballet dancer. Friedemann Vogel and Mick Zeni have very little to do, but they do their roles admirably. The corps de ballet tends to be slightly sloppy at times, and it is evident that some of the dancers have no idea what character dance is; they stick out in the dances of the final scene.

Of course, the music isn't dated at all, still that near-perfect ballet score, despite being a little long for today's tastes.
For the most part, the video recording was good, besides some irritable moments during Raymonda's variation in the last scene, and those of various close-ups in other parts of the ballet.
In my opinion, this ballet has proved to be very typical of La Scala - the stars are extremely better than the rest of the dancers (particularly Novikova), and the demi-soloists are completely lacking, while the corps de ballet has an inclination on sloppiness. I'd recommend this DVD to fans of Raymonda and Novikova, and those who have a genuine interest in the 'original' choreography. For a more exciting version, I'd point to Bolshoi's Raymonda, with Lyudmilla Semenyaka.",1339718400,5,1676,4.853146853146853
5076854,5,B007C7FDRE,"I hope this dvd helps to expose more people to the wonderful ballet Raymonda. I agree with the other review that the decision to show the piano keyboard during Raymonda's important final variation was a distraction. But what is worse than seeing the keyboard on one side is that the picture is blacked out twice during her variation. That is terrible! It is one of the best variations in the ballet and two times the video editor or whoever has the screen black out as it takes the piano keyboard away each time. When the piano reappears the screen doesn't go blank. So why does it have to go blank when the piano is removed off the screen? These two black out moments are split seconds but VERY, VERY annoying.

Olesia Novikova is marvelous as Raymonda. She is a pretty woman and her footwork is great. Her developpes, balances, pirouettes are all spectacular. I personally like the final variation to have a little more commanding attitude to it, but that is just a personal preference. Novikova is stunning throughout.

The production is gorgeous and apparently is what the original version in 1898 looked like.

Friedemann Vogel as Jean de Brienne and Mick Zeni as Abderahman have very little to do in this version. The Bolshoi version gives Jean de Brienne and Abderahman much more to do! Of course, that was Grigorovich adding more for the men to do, and I have to say it is exciting.

Still I would not want to be without this new dvd of Raymonda. There are no recent commercial Raymondas available except for this one, so it is a must have. The others are from the 1980s and are good, but video quality was not what it is today.

The corps looked a bit out of synch at moments, but overall they did a good job.

If you like traditional Petipa choreography and love great dancing, get this dvd. I think it is also timely. I interpret the ballet as showing how the West is intrigued by the East but doesn't really embrace it. This story is similar to what is going on in the world now.",1335484800,34,1991,4.486187845303867
5076855,4,B007C7FDRE,"I loved the dance, the costume, and production overall.  However, when Raymonda was doing the most important solo dance during the last act, the video editor decided to cut a third of the screen and insert the piano players  hands which I thought was very distracting.",1335484800,19,268,4.804347826086956
8514258,5,B007C7FDRE,"The Ballet of Teatro alla Scala put on a skillful and handsome production of a work not many have seen outside of Russia. In many respects, ""Raymonda"" is a synopsis of 19th century or classical ballet all put together. Compared to the 1989 version starring Natalya Bessmertnova in the title role by the Bolshoi Ballet, the tempo is slower with the choreography simpler and not quite as clean. Otherwise, this version boasts superior production values. The costumes and sets are gorgeous. I love Glazunov's score. It's one of only two ballet scores I have and I could listen to it all day as background noise. Other than Raymonda's variation in the third act which I'll get to in a moment, I find this version to be the best shot and edited ballet in my collection and I have over 25 works. I really enjoyed the numerous brief interlaying closeups and overhang shots sprinkled in with the dance. The overhang shot of Olesia Novikova as the title character at the start of the dream sequence in Act 1 is breathtaking. As for Raymonda's variation, the split-screen effect of Novikova and the pianist is jarring at first. While I agree it's best if it weren't done in that way, essentially you haven't lost any of the dance and you learn to ignore it in subsequent viewings. You can tell the filmmaker wants to give the orchestra some recognition as well so I can understand it happening. If you're fortunate to get your hands on a copy, don't miss out.",1468627200,,1449,4.642023346303502
8514259,5,B007C7FDRE,"Other reviewers have made pertinent and mostly just comments, which I won't repeat.  All of our principals were splendid.  Our Raymonda, Olesia Novikova, while dancing wonderfully, alas seemed emotionless throughout, particularly in contrast to her Jean de Brienne (Friedeman Vogel) and our Abderahman (Mick Zeni), both of whom truly lived their roles.  Would-be viewers should be made aware, in light of the angst recorded by several of the honorable other reviewers, that the split screen co-featuring the piano keyboard encompasses mere seconds, repeated once or twice, and one can easily simply focus on the dancer rather than on the keyboard.  The momentary blackouts during the same number are difficult to explain.  One wonders if perhaps there were three different ""takes"" stitched together for this demanding number; it would have been more sophisticated for the camera to have cut to onstage onlookers to segue the cut (or whatever was going on); but this is an extremely minor aspect of this excellent performance of a classic ballet which deserves to be much better known.  The genius of Petipa is triumphant here, particularly--in my opinion--in the exciting and varied second act; I had tears in my eyes from the sheer beauty of it.  This effort to recreate the original production succeeds in giving the viewer a rich and unforgettable experience.  Don't you deserve that experience too?",1460764800,,1402,5.255605381165919
8514260,5,B007C7FDRE,"This is beautiful. This is astounding. This is awesome. Every camera angle is perfect.

Olesia Novikova is dreamy and beautiful as Raymonda and you see her character mature throughout the ballet. In her last variation, she is elegant and womanly. Her dancing is soft at the best moments, precise at the next. As for acting.she could be a Hollywood star if she wasn't a ballerina! She portrays all the right emotions, no matter how complex, at the right time.

Friedemann Vogels Jean de Brienne is the perfect knight in shining armor. Olesia and him make a cute couple, especially in the dream sequence. Vogels dancing and acting are top-notch too.

Mick Zeni, as Abderahman, is outstanding also. His acting is very convincing and his appearance in the dream sequence gives me chills.

Glazunovs music is to die for. It is so pretty, I do not know really how to describe it.

Great performance by the whole company, acting and dancing wise. You can tell that everyones heart and soul went into this performance. This is definitely a DVD to add to any balletomanes collection.",1450051200,2,1074,4.815217391304348
