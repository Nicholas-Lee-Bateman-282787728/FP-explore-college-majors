8733205,5,B015CVRQCQ,"For anyone interested in rock music history, excellent filmmaking or just a compelling story, Jobriath a.d. is a revelatory and valuable documentary.  It focuses on one of the most talented musicians ever to be crushed by the weight of misguided promotional efforts and a misplaced faith in the readiness of the public and the media to embrace an alternative (and genuine) presentation of sexual identity.  The film is impeccably produced, directed and edited to provide insight as well as drama, often drawing on interviews with characters who seem worthy of their own biographical documentaries.  Having seen Jobriath perform in his 1974 stripped down, straightforward rock tour at a New Jersey venue called The Joint In The Woods in 1974, I am particularly grateful to Kieran Turner for taking on the formidable task of telling this story.  After decades of concert-going (including Hendrix, The Doors, Springsteen, Bowie) that concert still stands out as among the best.  The potential for Jobriath and his band to move beyond the radioactive effects of the early overhype was not realized, but the perseverance of the artist featured in Jobriath a.d. is both uplifting and tragic.  Also, rather than being the usual filler, the bonus features on the disc, especially Turners commentary, add to the artists story and to the story of this excellent film.  This is a highly recommended documentary that transcends mere reporting and, like all excellent filmmaking, tells a compelling story in a compelling way",1473897600,,1511,5.2190082644628095
