7978432,5,B00007M5HD,Most fun musical in a long time.  First musical i memorized songs from.  And try to sing in my car.  Badly.  But you know...,1506384000,,124,4.041666666666667
7978433,3,B00007M5HD,"This entry in the Nunsense series may not be quite up to its predecessors, but is still enjoyable. Vicki Lawrence is very good, but I still miss the original Nunsense cast members.",1395964800,,180,4.65625
7978434,3,B00007M5HD,i think Rue McClanahan done a much better job then what Vicki done .. just a over all opinion it was a ok movie but i must say i was disappointed,1379203200,,145,3.7096774193548385

7978436,3,B00007M5HD,we did not care for this movie. tha dvd was ok the change of story line and actors would not hold a candle to the first two.,1353974400,,124,3.6296296296296298
7978437,1,B00007M5HD,We LOVE Nunsense I and II and looked forward to watching this DVD.  Worse spent 90 minutes of my life.  The original cast is far more talented and funny.  Don't waste your money or time on this DVD.,1227830400,,198,4.157894736842105
7978438,5,B00007M5HD,"Several of the Nunsense musicals have been performed by our local community theater group. They are so funny! I'm a cradle Catholic, so I wonder if non-Catholics get the jokes. Anyway, the library for which I work, used to have Nunsense 1 and 2 on VHS. When I started purchasing DVDs for the library, I replaced the VHS with DVDs. Now we have Nunsense 1, 2, and 3, as well as Nunsensations (Vegas revue) and Nuncrackers (Christmas musical). You want to roll on the floor laughing? Nunsense is for you!",1225238400,,501,4.5777777777777775
7978439,5,B00007M5HD,"I was pleased with the quality of the DVD as well as the fast delivery. I would use this vendor again.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nunsense-3-The-Jamboree/dp/B000A0D1PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nunsense 3 - The Jamboree</a>",1224028800,,266,8.535714285714286
7978440,4,B00007M5HD,"I thought was a very funny DVD, some of the sight gags were histerical and Vickie Lawrence was terrific as Sister Amnesia.  I would truly recommend this DVD, especially to those who love the nunsense shows.",1190764800,2,206,4.722222222222222
7978441,2,B00007M5HD,"I enjoy Vicki Lawrence, but the creators should have stuck to the orignal cast.  The original Sister Mary Paul was very, very, funny. Sister Mary Regina's ""cameo"" appearance just wasn't enough. Though all the actors and actresses were great, they could never ""fill the shoes"" of the original cast. If you are a Nunsense fan, I don't advise purchasing ""Jamboree"", as it was a real disappointment, compared with Nunsense 1 and 2.",1137283200,5,427,4.930555555555555
