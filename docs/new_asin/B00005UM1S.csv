1665885,5,B00005UM1S,All other documentaries should aspire to the level of that of the Blue Planet series.  By far the most impressive documentary ever put together!  Even though the Discovery Channel re-airs these programs; the high quality of DVD sound and audio make this worth paying for it.,1047859200,2,274,4.934782608695652
1665886,4,B00005UM1S,"The only thing that kept me from giving this film five stars was the fact that I didn't find the audio as stimulating as the video.  There's nothing really wrong with the score or the narrator, but in my opinion niether sounded as inspiring as the images on the screen, and the added sound effects were at times almost annoying.  The information in this documentary is very fascinating, but after watching it once I found the desire to play it again with the sound off; while listening to Beethoven instead.  But for all this, it is really a very beautiful film.",1043020800,2,562,4.544554455445544
1665887,5,B00005UM1S,"This disk is easily the finest of the Blue Planet offerings. Maybe this explains why this disk alone has a green cover. Tackling two very difficult and hard to film subjects, you will be awed by the grace and motion of the storytelling and cinematography. ""Open Ocean"", the first chapter on this disk, will amaze you with a sense of the grandness of the oceans like no other documentary before it. Imagine a 10000 strong school of fish being attacked from the bottom by dolphin and tuna; and from the top by seafaring birds. Not an easy thing to commit to film. The ""Making of"" trailer states: ""We looked at what has been filmed so far, and tried to film what hasn't been done."" They succeeded in spades. After sitting through many oceanographic documentaries, I naturally expected to see a cage-bound cameraman awaiting the appearance of a Great White or Blue Shark... or some shots of a group of placid reef fish. Well, after viewing the first 10 minutes (and picking up my lower jaw off of the ground), I realized that the beauty of this film lies in the professionality of the production. The cameramen have a knack for angles and natural presentation. Never once do you see a diver's air bubbles or feel that a ""Person"" is filming. For a brief moment, you feel like a fish and you are introduced into a world where you cannot naturally go. The second part, ""The Deep"", is even more engrossing. Close your eyes for a moment and envision the oddest creature that you can imagine. Surprise! There are stranger things living in the depths. Captured on film are an amazing array of critters that can only make you shudder in horror or gape in wonder at the elegance of their existance. One unfortunate, yet understandable bit is that computer graphics are used to a noticeable extent in this chapter. Considering that some of the fish have never been filmed before, and the scarcity of ambiant light, a few man-made liberties can be easily forgiven. The highlights include the footage of luminous creatures and a wonderous underwater lake (if this sounds like an oxymoron, simply buy the DVD and you will see that our imagination is comparatively bland in scope and vision to what is constantly being discovered.)",1023321600,32,2213,4.72093023255814
1665888,5,B00005UM1S,"...Truth be told, the second set has no episode as stunning as the Deep Seas in the first set, or as beautiful as the Polar Seas. However, the four episodes match the first four in the depth of information offered, beauty of their photography (how often did I oscillate between ""How beautiful!"" and ""How...did they shoot that?""), and the marvelous narration and production values.
As with the first set, each disk has a ten-minute ""making of"" short, and an in-depth interview with a member of the production staff. Disk 4 also has an hour-long bonus program, ""Deep Trouble"", which describes how fishing is ravaging the seas. That alone is worth the price of the disk.
I cannot recommend the four Blue Planet DVDs too highly. Buy them. Enjoy. Share with your family. Marvel at the beauty they show - and the superb craftsmanship with which they were made.",1021593600,11,854,4.777027027027027
1665889,5,B00005UM1S,"If you or anyone you know has even a remote interest in the ocean and marine life this DVD is a must.  Even if you've seen parts of the ""Seas of Life"" series on the Discovery channel this DVD is still worth it as the difference in quality is astounding.
I had heard a lot of great things about this series before buying them and so my expectations were quite high when I popped the disc into my player.  Nothing could have prepared me for the indescribably clear images and absolutely beautiful photography.  I don't have a fancy TV, but this disc gave me a taste of the promise of high-definition video.  And not only is this disc technically brilliant, the storylines that the editors chose to cover are all incredibly compelling.
During many segments in both ""Open Ocean"" and ""The Deep"" I watched almost in disbelief at what I was seeing.  Through many years of watching nature documentaries I have never seen anything like what is contained in these two episodes.  It really is quite remarkable (and the ""making of"" featurettes are well worth watching as well).
I can and do recommend this DVD without any reservations (something that any of my friends and relatives could attest to ;-)!",1021593600,6,1191,4.647619047619048
1665890,5,B00005UM1S,"The Blue Planet - Seas of Life (Part 2) is a fascinating look into the ocean.  The photography is superb and the animals that are shown in The Deep look like something out of Star Trek rather than animals that live on our planet.  Over and over I needed to keep telling myself that these animals live in the same ocean that we swim in.
The quality of this DVD is second to none and as always, the BBC does a great job with the extras.  The wide screen format of these two programs enhances the overall experience.
I would highly recommend this DVD series to anyone who is fascinated by our planet and to anyone who has ever wonder what lives out there in our oceans?",1017619200,2,666,4.228346456692913
1665891,5,B00005UM1S,"I was amazed at the quality and splendor of this DVD. It has some of the most incredible (some never before seen)fish and animals captured in beautiful detail. The ocean-diving birds, the sunfish being cleaned by sea-birds, the psychedelic creatures of the deep - amazing stuff!!!! Is excellent for children and adults.",1015200000,3,319,5.153846153846154
1665892,5,B00005UM1S,"Only BBC documentaries take such pain and go to such lengths
to educate the public on nature (or the seas).One has to see this documentary to believe what I'm saying. The technical brilliance of this documentary must be praised. The clarity is just amazing. I could almost feel the seas. I have 2 copies of this brilliant documentary. In fact every home should have one..er
..make that two.
Cheers to the dedicated team that made Blue Planet.
Love you all

1665894,5,B00005UM1S,Our grandson just love watching this informational video over and over.  It explains the seas and the creatures very well.,1398816000,,122,5.1
1665895,3,B00005UM1S,"The other reviews are usually a good idea as to whether or not I make a purchase. This was purchased for my children, as they are huge fans of the ocean and it's inhabitants. They got bored with it even before the end, where as I was more than happy to sit through the entire show and bonus content. Educational and visually stunning, but no new content for avid ocean explorers.",1389571200,,379,4.352112676056338
1665896,5,B00005UM1S,"I love all the BBC nature documentaries. They're entertaining and informative, and win the prize for scenery porn. I do realize a lot of these ""natural"" encounters between animals are staged, but it does provide an opportunity to learn about and appreciate the world around us from the comfort and convenience of our own homes.",1388793600,,327,4.963636363636364
1665897,5,B00005UM1S,my son loved this. Loves the sharks. forget about it he is obsessed with sea life. Great purchase. definitely worth it.,1367971200,,119,4.714285714285714
1665898,5,B00005UM1S,"The vastness of the open ocean and the deepest abysses are brought to you, filmed beautifully and narrated informatively by David Attenborough. The ""Making of ..."" extras are essential viewing, showing the care and effort that went into making this voyage so easy for the viewer.",1367798400,,279,5.086956521739131
1665899,5,B00005UM1S,I love this item.  My eight year old son is fascinated by sea life.  I highly recommend this DVD.  Astonishing photography and filming.,1367625600,,135,4.782608695652174

If you are under 11 years: This move ROCKS!!!

Can't imagine Pierce Brosnan, and much less the special effects team got any Academy Awards for this one. But to see the looks of my son watching this movie made this an easy choice: 5 stars!",1362528000,,297,4.192982456140351

1665902,5,B00005UM1S,Purchased this for my grandson who got hooked on ocean creatures through Disney's Octonauts.  He loves seeing all the sea creatures in this film. Beautifully made.  A good buy.,1346284800,,176,5.0344827586206895
1665903,5,B00005UM1S,"After watching the BBC Blue Planet series with our son (now 5), he continued to ask for it.  We purchased this DVD for his birthday & it is wonderful.  Although it is not a Blue Ray disc, the quality is stunning.  I am also pleased by the price!",1330214400,,245,4.0625
1665904,5,B00005UM1S,This DVD takes you places you will probably never see otherwise. If you like the sea and are curious about the animal life in it you will love this.,1323907200,,148,4.137931034482759

Narrated by David Attenbourgh, it is entertaining and educational in a part of the world that has been visited by fewer people than have visited the moon.  The bonus is another show on coral reefs.  Definitely worth the money.",1229040000,,520,6.507246376811594

1665908,5,B00005UM1S,Really incredible images of the weirdest sea life ever seen. The footage of the faunal comunities of the thermal vent is particularly striking. A must see for anyone interested in sea life.,1167955200,4,189,4.9375
1665909,5,B00005UM1S,"This was an amazing documentary that I saw not long ago.  I have always wanted to be a marine biologist and then I saw this movie and knew exactly what I had to do.  This movie is fantastic with rare footage of live deep sea creatures uninhibited and fully entrenched in daily activities.  This not only gives you an idea of what deep sea creatures look like, but amazingly shows predator/prey interactions (though some of that was dramaticized, it was entertaining none the less).  Now working with one of the contributing scientists from the movie, I watch this every time I sea it on discovery or animal planet and I'm even more amazed when I see the fish the filmed in person.",1165795200,4,680,4.549180327868853

1665911,5,B00005UM1S,"AMAZING dvd..The colour is just out of this world w/o a high Def TV. The footage makes the viewer feel like they're actually there..DEFINITELY worth buying as well as seasonal seas/coral seas..I couldn't decide which one to get so I bought them both and highly recommend them :)

Oh and they have behind the scenes footage for each section (so two BTS per DVD) very interesting to see how much effort and energy was invested!!!",1104537600,4,427,4.693333333333333
1665912,5,B00005UM1S,"The Blue Planet's two episodes on this tape are the very best I have ever seen on the ocean's bowels and surfaces. The best episode here is ""The Deep"", which alone completely trashes Steve M's film ""The Living Sea!"" The Deep is ten times more amazing than anything shown in ""The Living Sea"". This episode takes you
 in a submersible down into the dark depths of the planet. The creatures shown are amazing, including: Gulper Eels, rodlike fish, Anglerfish, Sixgill Sharks, and many more! The submersible even passes over a trench 4000 meters down in the deep ocean. It is amazing and sometimes frightening. Very much worth the expense of the entire video!
  ""Open Ocean"", is also very exciting. The real highlights of this episode are the battles between different fish. There is ocean footage almost every second of the 45 minutes.
  You will have to view this for yourself and find out how excilirating it really is!",1088726400,11,918,4.784810126582278

7954836,3,B00005UM1S,"I really hoped for something a little more interesting that gave a better sense of the vastness and mystery of the open sea, especially the deep ocean. To me, it felt like the movie were gussied up video footage from an oceanographer's research project. It felt a little on the low budget side to me. Then again, when do documentaries get the funding they deserve to deliver the goods in a big way?",1435104000,,398,4.465753424657534

Highly recommended for anyone who is interested in the creatures of the very deep ocean. Stunning cinematography of some really far out creatures. I only wish they'd make a more updated one - this one was made in 2000-2002, so I'm sure they've discovered a lot more since then. This is just one episode from a whole series of ocean videos made around the same time called ""Seas of Life"" or something. We have those too, and they are also phenomenal foe ocean lovers.",1412208000,2,604,4.5
