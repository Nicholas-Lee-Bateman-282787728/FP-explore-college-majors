8618403,5,B00FRV8UJU,"This film accurately depicts the Native American occupation of Alcatraz Island in 1969, which lasted for 19 months. I remember it because I was there. Not on the island, but in San Francisco, living with my grandparents. It was the start of a lot of modern day Native activism. Nearly all of the militants who started AIM were there, and met and knew Richard Oakes, who was, in my opinion, the Martin Luther King of the Native people of America. His death is a tragedy that most Americans, and even Indians, know nothing about.

This film belongs in the library of every university and ethnic studies department in the country.

8618404,4,B00FRV8UJU,"For thousands of Native Americans, the infamous Alcatraz is not an island, it is an inspiration. After generations of oppression, relocation and assimilation, a small group of Native American students from UC Berkeley and San Francisco State along with Urban Indians from the Bay Area began the occupation of Alcatraz Island in November, 1969. They were eventually joined by thousands of Native Americans, retaking Indian land for the first time since the 1880s. Alcatraz Is Not An Island is the story of how this historic event altered U.S. Government Indian policy and programs, and how it changed the way many Native Americans viewed themselves, their culture, and their sovereign rights. The story of the occupation of Alcatraz is as complex and rich as the history of Native Americans. This documentary examines the personal sacrifices, tragedies, social battles, and political injustices many Native Americans experienced under the United States Government policies of assimilation, termination, and relocation - all eventually leading to Alcatraz. Beginning with the struggle to establish American Indian Studies programs at Bay Area universities, the occupation of Alcatraz quickly became the springboard for the Red Power movement of the 1970s, which has been called the lost chapter of the Civil Rights era. After 30 years, Alcatraz Is Not An Island provides the first in-depth look at the history, politics, personalities, and cultural reawakening behind this historic event, which sparked a new era of Native American political empowerment and cultural renaissance.

Here are some reviews.

As with all significant moments in history, there is always more than one story to tell - and it's the recollections of those who experienced Alcatraz from the inside and outside that makes James Fortier's documentary ""Alcatraz Is Not An Island"" so revealing.

The 1969 occupation of the most famous island in the United States fueled a generation of activists and galvanized Indian country at a critical time. The full weight of the federal government's policies of termination and relocation were being felt by urban Indians across the country.

But Alcatraz, like other political activities of the '60s, became victim to external and internal forces. Along with dealing with the obvious logistical problems of occupying a site that was an island and had been abandoned for years, there were other difficulties in building a community overnight. Issues of leadership, negotiation strategies with the government and ideologies on what an contemporary-traditional Indian society is, all played out under the scrutiny of national media attention.

For many, the occupation was a bittersweet experience and as director-producer James Fortier explains, he feels that time was the healing ingredient.

""Some of the biggest challenges were not just finding the people, but then getting them to do the interviews,"" he says. ""With some people, we had to first show them other people's interviews before they'd agree or want to tell their story. A lot of people didn't want to talk about it.

""I think that may be one of the major reasons why a big documentary on the occupation couldn't have been done for a long time is because the people involved didn't want to bring it up. I think over time the feeling toward the occupation has changed, it evolved and I think the accomplishments - because they were subtle and weren't so obvious at the time - it took awhile for those effects to really crystallize. Their feelings toward the occupation softened and actually it turned into pride at some point, so then they were willing to talk about it.""

Drawing from a diverse circle of storytellers, a wide array of impressions and memories are shared. And it is all those stories that give insight into the personalities and incidents that made up the 19-month occupation.
""Alcatraz touched and affected the lives of Native people to the extent that it affected people that weren't even there. At any time there may have been 15,000 to 20,000 Native people on the island and each one of them went home with a different story to tell. Combine that with thirty years and you have a lot of variation of what went on,"" Fortier says.

""Our challenge was to sort through all of that and see what were the dominant themes and recollections and then have them all come together and be represented by key storytellers in the film. I hope we captured the essence of the occupation for most Native people whether they were there or the other generations that came after.""

James Fortier's documentary is a rare reflection into a historic event - a portrait that strips the infamous occupation of any romanticism that may have enveloped it at the time. Now, three decades later, the filmmaker presents the facts and motivations that provide a clearer picture of what the occupation started out as, and ultimately ended up achieving. It is a struggle about re-defining self-determination - a story full of heart, personal tragedy, collective vision and the realities of moving forward.

""Someone said to me that the thing about Alcatraz is that those who got involved with it can't just let it go. It's going to be with you for the rest of your life. And even though I'm a young man and I was just a kid when the occupation happened, but now having gone through the occupation through this film I can see how it will stay with me for the rest of my life,"" Fortier says. ""Once you're connected to that island in any way it's hard to let go - it's almost like it won't let go of you. Living in the Bay area, every Thanksgiving there's a sunrise ceremony out there - the spirit of the occupation is kept alive.""

Editor's note: James Fortier's documentary on the occupation of Alcatraz was a 1999 American Indian Film Festival winner and will be shown at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, (Jan. 19, 3 p.m.; Jan. 24, 3 p.m. and Jan. 27, 9 p.m.).

PARK CITY, Utah - Alcatraz was always more than just an island, emerging as a symbol of resistance and renaissance for the spirits of American Indians dampened by urban assimilation and relocation.

""It brought heat, it brought warmth back to us as the collective spirit of Native people,"" says Santee poet John Trudell in a new documentary.

""Alcatraz is Not an Island,"" selected for avant garde festivals nationwide, was chosen for the highly-competitive Sundance Film Festival in January, San Jose Film Festival in February and slated for the Taos Talking Picture Festival in April. It claimed best documentary at the American Indian Film Festival in San Francisco.

With sharp-spoken verse, superb cinematography and an incredible Native soundtrack, the voices of Wilma Mankiller, Vine Deloria Jr., LaNada Boyer and Robert Warrior tell the story of Alcatraz with fellow scholars and warriors.

The action-packed, historical account details the loss of tribal lands, the occupation and the resulting trail of 20th century resistance.

The screening at the Sundance Film Festival was dedicated to its executive producer Millie Ketcheshawno, Mvksoke from Shell Creek, Okla., who died recently following a fall that resulted in a blood clot on the brain.

Director James Fortier, Metis/Ojibwe, remembered Ketcheshawno for her dedication to American Indians spanning the 30 years since Alcatraz.

""Millie was an incredible woman. She had an incredible sense of humor, but was a serious woman, too. She was always very kind and accepting of people.

""But she never forgot her own experiences of boarding school, with assimilation and those at Alcatraz. We tried to capture that in the film.""

Ketcheshawno's children, Leslie Deer and Gino Barichlo, joined the cast at the screening, which began with a Ute blessing offered by Larry Cesspooch.

Ulali sang ""The Rock"" from the soundtrack, and in the audience were those who spearheaded the occupation and held the rock, including Trudell, Boyer, Adam Fortunate Eagle and Robert Free.

Alcatraz tells of the urban relocation and termination policies that attempted to vanish Indian people from their lands and one another. But, in relocating Native people to urban areas, the government did not foresee that Indian groups would organize a firestorm of resistance.

""I felt like that was just the beginning of the transformation process,"" Ketcheshawno says as she details her own story from boarding school, to relocation in the San Francisco Area to the ultimate occupation of Alcatraz.

Alcatraz was the symbol, the catalyst for liberation.

But the actual occupation had a rough start, in fact there were a series of attempts to occupy the island. On March 9, 1964, American Indians briefly claimed the island as unoccupied federal territory after the U.S. penitentiary was closed.

After the San Francisco Indian Center burned in 1969, Bay Area Indian activists said it was time to take the island and create a Native cultural and educational center.

When Fortunate Eagle urged the occupation, people asked, ""Why Alcatraz?""

""It looks like most reservations anyway,"" he said. ""It's removed from society, there's no running water, unemployment will be very great and there's not enough game to support the population. It's typical of Indian reservations.""

""It was a good kind of satire.""

Fortunate Eagle told people if they didn't like what they saw on Alcatraz, they should look around them at Indian lands.

During an attempt to take the island Nov. 9, 1969, a Canadian skipper declared to Indians onboard his ship that it would be an ""act of war"" to land under a foreign flag. Richard Oakes and others dove overboard and swam toward the island, but only Joe Bill made it.

Finally, a modern-day group of Sausalito boat runners, viewing themselves as modern-day pirates, took the occupiers across under the cover of darkness.

Peter Bowen, at the time owner of the No Name Bar, was asked by Alan Miller to use his boat to ferry occupiers across the Bay. Bowen recalls viewing himself as a pirate and saying, ""Terrific!""

Once on the island Nov. 20, 1969, the group heard the watchkeeper call out, ""May Day! May Day! The Indians have landed!""

Oakes was a dreamer, a steelworker who found spiritual renewal at Alcatraz, offering the government $24 in trade goods - glass beads and red cloth - for the island.

The Mohawk leader said ships arriving in the West should first see the occupation of Alcatraz as a symbol of the continent's first people.

""Alcatraz is not an island, it's an idea. It's the idea that you can control your own destiny, and self-determine your future."" Oakes said.

But Oakes also lost his young daughter Yvonne, who died from a fall at Alcatraz, and lost his heart to continue leading the movement on Alcatraz.

The film details the final struggles, within and without, of the occupation which attracted 15,000 Indian occupiers and visitors. It tells of the destructive fire to the buildings, the government's attempts to divide activists with dollars, and the trail of resistance that continued on to Washington, D.C., and Wounded Knee in South Dakota.

President Nixon repudiated the termination policy and Indian lands at Navajo and Taos Pueblo were among the first to be returned after the Red Power movement grew from the seeds of Alcatraz.

Trudell says Alcatraz was the strongest sense of community he has ever experienced. For Indian people it was the result of the termination, relocation and hopelessness of 20th century policies.

""We were the statistics. We had just come out of this meat-grinder they call democracy,"" Trudell said.

Alcatraz changed him. ""It was while I was there that I came to understand that the government was the enemy of our culture.""

Boyer, Shoshone-Bannock, earned a doctorate degree after Alcatraz. While a student at Berkeley, she was also a strong voice of Alcatraz.

""Alcatraz was symbolic in the rebirth of Indian people to be recognized as a people, as human beings, whereas before, we were not.""

At the end of the film, Miller says of the Alcatraz story, ""It is not over yet.""

On screen, scholar Troy Johnson joins American Indian historians Warrior, Deloria, Daryl ""Babe"" Wilson and Edward Castillo to document the history of United States policy and Alcatraz.

Tim Findley, former reporter for San Francisco Chronicle, provides intriguing accounts and Don Patterson, former director of the San Francisco Indian Center, tells of Bay Area Native history.

Fortier said efforts are under way to gain distribution through PBS in San Francisco. Final editing and the need for funds to purchase a license for the film's music means nationwide distribution will not occur until the fall of 2001.

After the Sundance screening, Free, who tells onscreen of pitching his tipi at Alcatraz, said he viewed the Sundance's Native Forum as the result ""of the sacrifices of the people of the movement.

""It was a testimony to how far we've come, with the support of several tribes helping us produce our own images and tell our own stories.""
