8192830,5,6303510302,"When we remember that Charlie Chaplin not only starred in LIMELIGHT, but also directed it, and even wrote the beautiful musical score, we realize that these early moviemakers were more than just stars as we know them now.  Much more!  Buster Keaton
was his own stuntman,and judging from the incredible stunts in STEAMBOAT BILL and other Keaton greats like SEVEN CHANCES, he was an awfully lucky man just to survive these very demanding films. I've only begun to appreciate Buster Keaton's movies and I've found already that the time is well spent!  This Madacy 4-pack has Buster starring in three of the films, but only in a minor role as Lonesome Polecat in LIL ABNER.  STEAMBOAT BILL will forever remain one of the silent classics. Ivy leaguer Buster returns to his roots on the river to be spurned by his husky selfmade father Bill who scoffs at the metamorphosis his son has made while away at school.  He is now too much of a sissy to hold his own on the river.  And then he falls in love with his competitor's daughter.  The story unfolds rapidly and the storm that catalyzes everything is the grandest cinematic storm in history.  STEAMBOAT BILL alone makes the 4 pack worth the buying,but also included were two of Keaton's first talkies.
SPEAK EASILY and PARLOUR, BEDROOM, AND BATH demonstrate Keaton's ability to transend boundaries and successfully act in various comic genres. LIL ABNER is a tour de force for all lovers of funny movies.  Whether it is the charms of Daisy Mae,Delightful, or Wendy Wilecat or the showdown of epic proportions between Lil Abner and Earthquake McGoon, or the amazing tricks of Dogpatch's maidens after their male prey on Sadie Hawkins day, the movie is as funny as you will ever be privileged to see. You will learn about the ""code of the hills"" and admire the spunkiest little character in all of film, Mammy Yoakum. My journey back in time to earliest cinema has brought me the most pleasure in a lifetime of loving film.  I hope that you will make the journey, too.",1084060800,,2011,4.703703703703703
