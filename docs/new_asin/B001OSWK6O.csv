8331398,1,B001OSWK6O,"Wow!  Based on the other reviews, I really wasn't expecting a lot in terms of packing or presentation.  However, I did expect the actual items to be included which were not!  There was no votive candles, no tea bags, and no honey sticks for tea.  Even the MASSAGE oil was not as described, instead they included a cheap tube of hand lotion.  REALLY!!  So I received the cheap DVDs and a CD along with a bottle of hand lotion.  Don't waste your time, you will just end up returning it like I did.",1389398400,,495,4.258064516129032
8331399,5,B001OSWK6O,This is a great gift for a baby shower. It includes a bunch of fun things and a dvd that will help baby and mommy.,1290643200,,114,3.6
8331400,3,B001OSWK6O,"The ""happy meal"" box in the background is the basket.  I opted to toss the box and make my own basket. Also note that the picture shows six candles and three tea bags/honey sticks, but the item includes three candles and one tea bag/honey stick.  My vote is the contents make a great gift idea, presentation is lacking.",1256342400,,319,4.482758620689655
