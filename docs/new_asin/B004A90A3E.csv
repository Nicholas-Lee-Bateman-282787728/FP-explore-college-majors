4299595,1,B004A90A3E,"When searching on Roku for The return of the Native with Catherine Zeta-jones, I found the correct movie cover with a link to buy it on amazon. I clicked the link and completed the purchase, but what plays is not the movie. It is this other item with the same name, but an additional name of welcome to Bruther.",1389744000,3,311,4.288135593220339
4299596,1,B004A90A3E,"I was looking up Ray Stevenson who is in a version of this movie (along w/ Clive Owen and Catherine Zeta-Jones), this came up so I purchased it only to find it's a some homemade looking film.  It looks like a high school production but I think even a high school kid could do better.  Want my money back!",1356307200,5,304,4.135593220338983
4299597,1,B004A90A3E,"I was never so dissapointed in a movie. Not only did they change the time and location,but they even changed the names of the title characters. The acting was terrible. Thomas Hatdy would have been unable to recognize it.",1348185600,,221,4.6923076923076925
4299598,1,B004A90A3E,This was a waste of money! The movie makes no since at all. The picture sucks. It looks like a five year old filmed the movie. I don't no where someone came up with this. Its not even a movie. Im mad that i spent three dollars on this. I would not recommend anyone to buy this garbage.,1341532800,7,285,3.9310344827586206
4299599,2,B004A90A3E,"Thought I'd provide some info about this DVD since Amazon does not have a ""Product Description"" for it.

Happened upon this when checking out Thomas Hardy adaptations and, as I'd never heard that a new version had been made of the Victorian writer's 1878 tragic novel, I decided to do some digging.

According to the IMDB and other sites, this version of THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE is set in the Appalachians during the early 1930s, runs for 94 minutes, and is said to have been shot on a budget of $2000 (which might explain why no ""big name"" actors appear in its credits).  The screenplay was written by Ben Westbrook (who doubled as the director) and Deena Bermudez.

Judging by its trailer (which is on youtube), I can't say that I'll put it on the top of my DVD wish list becuz - I'm sorry to say - it doesn't look all that great, which isn't a good sign since producers tend to put a film's ""best parts"" on the trailers  (incidentally, since I was forced to provide a rating, I based it on the promo reel).  Go ahead and check it out for yourself.

Again, this ""review"" was just for ""informational purposes"", so that no one will mistakenly assume that this story was set - like the novel - in the mid-1800s in Hardy's fictitious English county of ""Wessex"".",1330992000,2,1260,4.428571428571429
8419769,1,B004A90A3E,"Just finished reading the book of the same name by T Hardy, This movie is a fraud, It has nothing to do with the story by Hardy. It does not feature Catherine Zeta-Jones as advertised. It is more poorly produced than any home movie I ever watched. Watched only a few minutes. Extremely disappointing,  Requesting a refund..",1477180800,,323,4.666666666666667
8419770,1,B004A90A3E,"I didn't even watch it. I had been looking forward to seeing the actual Thomas Hardy story w Catherine Zeta Jones, not some knock off story.  I was very disappointed.",1468972800,,166,4.533333333333333
8419771,1,B004A90A3E,Lowest production quality I have ever paid for.  I wish I had read these reviews first.  Amazon has no business charging anybody for this piece of garbage.  A middle-school production of Return Of The Native would be acted better.,1463270400,,230,4.846153846153846
8419772,1,B004A90A3E,This is advertised as the version with Clive Owen and Catherine Zeta-Jones; instead I got a cheap rip-off and had to pay for it! Not nice.,1462665600,,138,4.346153846153846
8419773,1,B004A90A3E,This should not be included as a movie for sale.  It is not to be described.  I think Amazon should delete this from their sale list of movies. It is not a movie at all.,1456185600,,169,3.8
8419774,3,B004A90A3E,Great!,1454025600,,6,6.0
8419775,1,B004A90A3E,it is a bad home movie with horrible acting and a disjointed incomprehensible plot. icant believe they are selling it as a hardy-esque adaptation.,1450483200,,146,5.125
8419776,2,B004A90A3E,Not  my favorite,1445558400,,16,4.333333333333333
8419777,1,B004A90A3E,This is supposed to be the movie Return of the Native with Catherine Zeta Jones. It is something completely different. I don't know how this happened.,1433548800,2,150,4.8076923076923075
8419778,1,B004A90A3E,I would like my money back on this movie. I only watched a few minutes. It is an amateur production that made no sense in those minutes. Please refund my $2.99.,1432944000,3,160,4.193548387096774
