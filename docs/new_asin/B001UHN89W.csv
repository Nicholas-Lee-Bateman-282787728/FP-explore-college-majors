I did buy a VHS Pilot episode off of eBay, and watched it in amazement. That it was a total rip-off of Boiler Room. Not that I minded. It was a great movie, and a great idea to bring the concept to TV. It was a little dated (The Murphy Brown current events effect?) but if the show was able to progress, it would've stuck with the times.

Every other show in the world is getting released...let's do this too.",1245888000,4,580,4.123893805309734
