8579197,5,B00CAEICEK,This is just as good as friday the 13th and all those other 80's horror movies. I've been looking everywhere for this one and was super cited when i found it. Great movie!!,1493510400,,172,4.242424242424242
8579198,3,B00CAEICEK,"Okay, if you see that Director, Ruggero Deodato is attached to this movie, and are expecting CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST 2.0, just get that notion right out of your noggin, right now! Nope, BODY COUNT has no disturbing pathos, tragic irony, or anything else that could be considered even semi-intelligent. Unlike HOLOCAUST, there is no dark, mean-spirited philosophy of any kind underpinning this film. Instead, it has a group of fun-loving young people on vacation in the wilderness; camping, hiking, and being stalked and butchered by a rubber-faced maniac. It also has David Hess (LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT) as a grumpy, RV-driving dad, whose only purpose seems to be to make the gaggle of 27yo ""teens"" miserable. Actually though, he's involved in a grim subplot that's more interesting than the main story! Otherwise, there's murder, mutilation, and assorted imbecility. Many of the death scenes are very similar -identical in some cases- to those found in far superior genre films like FRIDAY THE 13TH, etc. Still, there's something so outrageously, stupendously preposterous about it, that it takes on a sort of bubble-headed glory, all its own! This is Deodato giving 80s audiences what he believed they wanted. It's certainly what they deserved! In the end, the most shocking thing about BODY COUNT is the naked fat guy flopping all over the place! Brrr...",1409788800,,1352,5.122171945701357
