3046083,5,B00104AYGU,"A lot of great films came out last year, 2007--No Country for Old Men, There Will Be Blood, The Lives of Others, and so on--but I honestly can't think of a better one than this: ""Control.""

This is a gorgeous and skillfully done film--all awash in silvery starkness, in luminous black and white--and all feeling so genuine and so far from anything fake or phony.  I am not the suicidal singer of a New Wave band, I am not in love with a French journalist, and I do not think I married too early, but watching this, the movie really put me inside the man's skin.

""Control"" tells the story of Ian Curtis, Joy Division's ill-fated lead singer--as well as his unfortunate wife, his band, his manager, his label, and his lover--and it does so without resorting to making it a slick biopic or a phony depiction of celebrity.  It is one of the realest feeling films I have ever seen, and yet it doesn't sacrifice anything compelling or filmic to be so.  The story plows ahead with amazing music and a formidable drive, with scenes that are artfully shot and gorgeous to behold.

The film's final scenes are indelible, cut forever into my mind, and the feeling the film invokes is powerful.  I have never felt more genuinely punk than after seeing this--leaving the theater, I wanted to rip benches out of the ground and attack speeding cars head-on.  More than that, I wanted to walk back into the theater, get another ticket, and watch it again.  (I'm not really that into Joy Division either--at least I wasn't before seeing this.)

""Control"": Best Movie of 2007.  And Best Music Movie in Decades.  So well-made and flawlessly executed that it couldn't ultimately depress me--it could only excite me.  It's amazing.",1206835200,46,1711,4.663333333333333
3046084,4,B00104AYGU,"It's a long time since Ian Curtis's solemn laments of thwarted love have hit my turntable. And in spite of the longevity of Joy Division's successor, New Order, I confess that the demise of Curtis, an authentic Rock tragic, singled the demise of my interest in their music. What explanation is there for an attraction to talent extinguished prematurely; the titillation of having glimpsed, sometimes stared at some gift that was squandered? In many instances, and Curtis's is among them, early, meteoric talent most likely was fufilled...fatalism was written into it, the biography and art in perfect tandem. Their music already sounded as if it was rising from the grave, a severly cold other place. That's what the popular press has continued to feed us over the ensuing decades. In this sense Corbijn's film is no exception. You buy the Q magazines or NME, whatever, for some fresh insight to such legends. But there isn't any. The film's script has been anticipated in the music; alienation of the inner, poetic self from the cramped and dour quotidian life of cramped, urban, Macclesfield. The band's public image, as per Corbijn's recreation has been honorably projected, mesmerizingly so by Sam Riley...the entire slow surge of its black and white cinematography inexorably, hauntingly moving toward the last gasp in that sad little kitchen. The acting is so convincing that you often feel it's a documentary rather than an interpretation. There is no sensationalism to be found in Curtis's life or death. For all its Doors-like anthemic sound, Curtis was no aspirant Jim Morrison.",1203811200,,1588,5.111538461538461
3046085,5,B00104AYGU,"This movie was spectalular.  I was very impressed by the actor's portrayal of Curtis.  He was phenomenal.  Every Joy Division fan should see this movie.  If you ask a lot of people if they have ever heard of this band you will get a lot of no, who, never heard of 'em.  But Joy Division continues to inspire performers of many different genres.  Its amazing how many people love songs like Shadowplay from The Killers or Dead Souls from NIN (The Crow soundtrack), but have no idea that these are Joy Division songs.  The old saying, the good die young, no matter how cliche, continues to ring true.",1202169600,2,598,4.481481481481482
3046086,5,B00104AYGU,"I became a Joy Division fan long after the fact. I was a New Order fan after hearing Temptation and then rushing out to buy Blue Monday after seeing them perform it on TOTP for the first time. My friend Mooncat introduced me to 'both bands'.

25 years later - we are viewing rock history as interpreted by people who are closer to what actually happened at the time.

This is a beautiful film. Yes - Curtis is legend, as are the rest of the band. This film (and yes - I have read the book) gives a good portrayal of what it is to be to be working class English, with ambition and with flaws. All of the performances are powerful - Sam Riley does a good job (though I felt he looked more like Stephen Morris), and the actor playing Rob Gretton is fantastic. Comedic relief while at the same time giving the sense that he had some control over the band. Kudos by the way for learning to play your instuments for the roles and reform for a long overdue Joy Division concert at Cochella !!!

My criteria for a movie is - does it move me ? At the end of the film I was almost in tears. My wife was. I am sentimental towards Joy Division and ""Atmosphere"" is the perfect song to induce this feeling. Was it just the song - no. The movie is perfectly cast, directed and should win bucketloads of awards but it probably won't due to lack of distribution.

If you have any desire to watch a music biography - this is the film. If you care to enquire about post punk - this is the film. Beautifully written, shot and performed. A must for my DVD collection.",1201046400,4,1546,4.177852348993288
3046087,4,B00104AYGU,"Ian Curtis wasn't you're typical rock star.  Instead of sex, drugs, and rock and roll, you get epilepsy, broken marriage, and performance anxiety.  Control, though a well made movie that avoids many pitfalls of a typical musical biopic, doesn't really get to the bottom of who Curtis really was, which might just be an impossible task.

Sam Riley plays Curtis, the lead singer of the legendary band Joy Division.  I'm probably not spoiling anything by saying that he killed himself, making himself in to a legendary rock figure.  The main story centers on Curtis's struggles with his ill advised marriage at a young age, his severe epilepsy, and his affair with a Dutch woman named Annik.  Riley obviously studied Curtis's mannerisms, as his awkward but strangely charismatic stage presence and his voice really stand out.  He sings all of his own parts, and he does a respectable job.  Curtis was not a great singer, but he did have a very distinctive voice, something that Riley emulates well.

Watching Control, you get the sense of just how gloomy Joy Division's music really was.  I've listened to Unknown Pleasures and Closer many times, but seeing the inspiration for Curtis's pitch black lyrics played out in a dreary Manchester makes them appear more palpable.  You could argue that there is some mythologizing going on, but it doesn't beat you over the head like Walk the Line does.  Instead, it lets the viewer put together the pieces for the most part.  A good example is when Curtis see's a girl have an epileptic seizure when he's working at the unemployment office.  For those who have followed Joy Division closely, you this is the inspiration for She's Lost Control.  You'd have to know the lyrics of She's Lost Control to know that it's about a girl with epilepsy.  There are some times though where the filmmakers hold your hand, like when they show his book collection, filled with depressing books by JG Ballard and William S. Burroughs, or when he talks about going to see Apocalypse Now.  Even then, it still relies mostly on subtext to get the message across about Curtis's influences.

One major problem I have with most musical biopics is that they rarely show anything about the creative process.  There is a bit in Control, like the scene where they are recording the drum tracks for She's Lost Control.  Apparently they got the odd hissing sound using a spray can.  I was hoping for a more prominent role for Martin Hannett, the notoriously controlling producer of both Joy Division albums.  By all accounts Hannett had a large influence on Joy Division's sound, but he's only shown for about 5 minutes.  And how did they decide that the bass would take lead and the guitar would be used as a background device?  Was it because Peter Hook was the best musician in the band, or was it some other reason?  Of course, I'm a music nerd, so these things might not interest anyone outside of me and a few other dedicated weirdo's.

Control is a cut above most biopics.  Riley does a wonderful job as Curtis, and it offers a fairly unsparing look at his life.  Curtis still remains a mystery though, and will probably stay that way forever.  That's part of the appeal of his music; you can listen to it over and over and still not know what was in the creators mind.",1200528000,7,3288,4.699300699300699
3046088,4,B00104AYGU,"Corbijn's talents as a photographer and music video director lend themselves perfectly to this biography, as it's stark cinematography and haunting music certainly overshadow it's lackluster script. Fortunately, Riley's breakthrough performance and Kebbell's bombast more than compensate for the film's few (but noticeable) lapses in narrative. (8/10)",1198800000,,351,6.48936170212766
3046089,4,B00104AYGU,"A biopic of Joy Division's lead singer, Ian Curtis? Who besides a handful of people like me, (in 1980 we had their posters on our bedroom wall and sketched what Joy Divison's third album cover might have looked like),  and the only other patron at the matinee theatrical showing that I viewed could possibly care? Indeed, why should I want to see actors performing a suicidal swan dive when all the sadness of Curtis' death lies imbedded in the gloomy, psyche-rich and beautiful music Joy Division left behind?

Because now Ian Curtis is really dead. Anton Corbijn's film, ""Control"" brings closure to the first time I heard Joy Division, raced to a record store, and was no sooner through a second listen when I heard the lead singer had committed suicide. I've been in denial ever since, and the sketchy details of Curtis' death, the same sketchy details offered in the film, suddenly ring true to me.

Filmed in the British working class black and white, like the Beatles' ""A Hard Day's Night"", with tones of muted and spacious greys, like The Who's ""Quadrophenia"", the film brings vitality to the bleak Manchester neighborhoods that were the haunts of the band. It has that wide screen black and white ordinariness that film geeks love. Very common images of modest Brit apartments, cheap recording studios and seedy clubs, are given an immaculate shine by the variable b&w cinematography which conjure not only the do-it-yourself Manchester music scene, but Joy Division's own bleak and surviving psyche. And the head bobbing teens digging the band in the clubs look like the honest to god post punks of yesterday.

You'd thing that was genuine Joy Division during the musical performances, but it is the actors uncannily recreating the music with Sam Riley as Curtis, not only looking the part while delivering a 'let's-let's not' demeanor, but sounding like a dead-on Ian Curtis, with all the brooding deep voiced restraint Curtis possessed. In a subtle performance in which the camera finds him, as opposed to a mugging for the camera, Riley as Curtis, (just another English bloke holding a day job), gives reason to believe in the seemingly petty causes of Curtis' self-destruction. He simply didn't want to live anymore, (""I give them everything 'on stage' and they want more""), and the overload of prescription drugs to combat epilepsy surely complicated matters. Samantha Morton as wife Deborah Curtis, (whose autobiography the film is based), is extraordinary as the plain and sexy love struck young woman who stands like a pillar against Curtis' doomed horizon. The big scene is taken like an arrow through the heart, even as you know it is the only destination the film aims.

My one and only gripe is the movie's insistance to incorporate Joy Division music at times of marital strife, which seemed a lessening of the music's depth.

But now Ian Curtis is really, really dead. He had sung his last song. Finito. Out of here. Love tore him apart.",1197072000,34,2960,4.91
3046090,3,B00104AYGU,"In 1979 a young Dutch Photographer called Anton Corbijn heard an album called `Unknown Pleasures'. Within days he had left Holland and headed for England intent on locating the makers of the record. He found them in Macclesfield and, with a series of monochromatic images, began to forge their legend.

 A scant eighteen months later the group were considered one of the most important bands of the post punk era. On the eve of the release of their second album, their biggest hit single and an American Tour, their lead singer hung himself in his kitchen. The first rock and roll suicide - he was twenty three.

 Corbijn went on to have an amazing career in which his photography and video promos resulted in much of modern rock's iconography via his work with U2, Depeche Mode, The Rolling Stones and many others, and now, finally, he has come a full circle with his directorial film debut telling the story of the band which brought him to England in the first place.

 The band was Joy Division. The film is Control.

 Control is the biopic of Joy Division's lead singer; the charismatic but deeply troubled Ian Curtis. Joy Division had emerged from the fallout of the late 70's punk explosion. Taking the inert nihilism of that new sound and instilling it with an intellectualism far removed from the cheap shock tactics which sold it to teenagers everywhere, Joy Division, with the visionary brilliance of producer Martin Hannett, developed an oeuvre of dystopian soundscapes which continues to serve as a ground zero for new music to this day.

Based on the book `Touching From a Distance' by Curtis' widow Deborah and starring newcomer Sam Riley in the lead role, Control does as much to dismantle the Curtis cult as it does to propagate it. The sleek futurism and Ballardian preoccupations of the music are in stark contrast to the kitchen sink dour-ocity from which it emerged. Control is a rock and roll `L Shaped Room' or `Look Back In Anger' with an epileptic Jimmy Porter dumping his trumpet for a Vox Phantom guitar. Terrifying evocations of Curtis' jerking, trance-fixated on-stage persona, juxtaposed with his day job at the local job centre or making cups of tea in the mannered surroundings of his small council house is as far removed from our perception of Curtis the uber-prophet of urban ennui as can be imagined. Think Bowie trying to set the video recorder or Lou Reed doing the washing up.

 The musical sequences deftly convey the chaos and excitement of the band's live appearances thanks to Riley's convincing portrayal of Curtis but Tony Kebbell as Rob Gretton, whose introduction and pronunciation of himself as the band's new manager, is the highlight of a film which may be too drama-heavy for fans and, perhaps, too long for everyone else. Nevertheless, Control is a crash-course in the banality behind the bombast and the dissection of a myth. Tony Wilson, owner of Joy Division's record label Factory is often quoted as saying ""if it comes to printing the truth or the legend, always print the legend"". With Control, Anton Corbijn has managed a collision of both.

Amended to 4 stars (see comments)

3046091,5,B00104AYGU,"I've now seen this story played out 3 times, twice at the movies in the last 2 days and once as a 15 year old from the North of England where the film is set. In the true spirit of the ""Kitchen Sink"" genre, it begins like a modern day ""A kind of loving"" and has a touch of "" Room at the top"" (the wedding car scene). Sam Riley plays Ian Curtis Lead singer of Joy Division, a band who influenced so many groups in the UK and internationally. Riley is outstanding, portraying Curtis in a way that does not show him as the icon he became posthumously but as a somewhat immature 20+ year old man. This of course is countered by a soundtrack that reminds us of his musical genius played by the actors in a very authentic ""Garagey way"". A portrait of a man torn between his old and new life complicated by the onset of an illness he was struggling to come to terms with.

If that wasn't enough the photography is glorious, every other shot could be hung on the wall, it never looked so good when I was a young! I understand that Corbijn was trying to shoot the film like a sequence of music videos and with his massive experience as a still photographer it all works beautifully. He sank a large amount of his own money into this project, and you can tell that making it was important to him as a fan and aquaintance of the band You can see his passion and committment to the film throughout. The sequence in the kitchen towards the end of the film was electric, an incredibly haunting dramatic shot. This movie demands the biggest screen that you can find.

I read a review that said you don't watch this movie you live it, the first time I saw Control I was angry at the futility of it all, the second I wept tears for lost youth, his and mine. My advice ? Go to a really big Movie screen and take a box of tissues and enjoy what must be considered the best music movie of all time. There's no getting away from the end, like Ian Curtis's all too short life it comes too soon in this movie, but enjoy the majesty of the photgraphy, the stunning performances, revel in the darkness and enjoy the music. Surely a candidate for Oscar(s)?",1195689600,26,2130,4.205378973105135
3046094,5,B00104AYGU,This film is a class A bummer.

3046095,4,B00104AYGU,"You can't not like this biopic if you are a Joy Division fan. Seems to be a natural character portrayal.

3046105,3,B00104AYGU,"Well-acted and well-written story, but not about the actual Ian Curtis or other members of Joy Division in any meaningful way. Casting did an impressive job of choosing actors who resemble the people they're portraying in real life, and the acting is good. The camera work is charming and the choice to film in black & white interesting. But I feel like they focused on capturing some of the simple aesthetics to the detriment of telling a serious story. In my opinion the story is shallow. It reduces Curtis to some kind of mysterious misunderstood poet, instead of a complex, intelligent, angry human being. It portrays his marriage to Debbie and relationship with Annik as the likely causes of his suicide, asserting that his relationship with Annik was romantic when she maintained it was platonic until her dying day. I felt this really did Curtis, the rest of the band, and their art a huge disservice. There is no meaningful exploration of their political, social, or economic contexts, growing up in post-industrial, post-WWII Manchester. There is no meaningful discussion of the Nazi imagery and history they incorporated into their music and art, which was irresponsible of the filmmakers. That deserved serious consideration and discussion. Viewers won't even learn the origins of their name from this film, understand they were anti-fascist, or even why they chose those symbols.

Overall, this was an entertaining and moving story but it was far too individualistic, lacking in context, and oversimplified for my taste. I would have appreciated more exploration of Curtis' childhood and work as employment advocate for adults with disabilities. But, again, taken as a fictional story, it's really very good. If you want something about the actual band Joy Division, I recommend the documentary written by Jon Savage & directed by Grant Gee.",1483747200,,1853,5.156146179401993

Like his wife, Debbie, who stares at him, mouth agape, on the television, we realize that something exceptional is before us.  I'm not even a fan of this music, but the actor playing Curtis is absolutely magnetic.

Ian Curtis, as played by the very talented Sam Riley, was too smart for the situation he was born into, but he managed to turn his talent into writing thought-provoking and outr lyrics for the songs Joy Division put together. Curtis was too young to have gotten married, but he was overly sensitive and craved love and closeness. The terror Ian felt from his epilepsy condition overwhelmed him and presented him with no option but lifelong medication with heavy, debilitating drugs. Curtis was likely a difficult man to work with and know, but if the film was in any way accurate, he had to have been mesmerizing when he was on stage.",1482710400,,760,4.7218045112781954

3046132,4,B00104AYGU,"Amazing performance by Sam Riley as Ian Curtis, lead singer of Joy Division.  Riley even sings the songs, and its well done.  This is the performance that moved Riley's career forward.  A well crafted bio-pic with outstanding performances all around.  Samantha Morton as Curtis' suffering wife inhabits the role beautifully, as usual for Morton.  The script is tight, dialogue crisp and natural, directing unnoticeable - thank God.  No obvious tricks, goofy editing, or over acting.  I love this film.  If you like bio-pics, this is a good one about the troubled lead singer of a punk band that made its mark on music.  Love the soundtrack too.",1480982400,,644,4.94392523364486
3046133,4,B00104AYGU,"As a teenager, he is aware of his brooding, moodiness, but he has a profound interest and love for poetry, prose, music, and a newfound exuberance for a sweet, loving girl named Debbie (Samantha Morton). Once married and a father, now suddenly battling epilepsy, and a burgeoning rock-star status, Ian Curtis (Sam Riley) meets up with the ultimate spoilers-- despair and darkness.  And this is the story, adeptly told by Matt Greenhalgh, and directed and astutely captured on film by Anton Corbijnin. Curtis is brilliantly played by Sam Riley.  Much of the screenplay is informed by Samantha Morton's biography.  As the lead singer for Joy Division, good-looking and sexy, more than a little awkward and self-conscious with most, Curtis is a magnet for women, actually for hoards of fans in the late 70s. Pile on top of that, the reciprocated fixation of a gorgeous Belgian groupie Annik (Alexandra Lara), and you might just end up with a man who wants out. Skilled, dramatic, and measured black and white photography effectively fleshes out the sad tale of a really brilliant (his songwriting so good) clinically depressed, charismatic (almost against his will) reluctant star. His impassioned singing and marching, waving arms, an odd dance that highlights both his weakness and his strength, electrifies the crowds. What happens next remains to be seen. Samantha Morton is stellar as Debbie. This is an accurate depiction of this musician, and is skillfully filmed and written, but even from a more universal perspective, it shines a constant light on the downside of success.

Obviously this is about both of these topics.  I wish I understood what they see, or how their minds work.

That said, the movie was terrific.  Ian Curtis was very well portrayed by Sam Riley who was simply superb.

3046152,4,B00104AYGU,"Stark and powerful. Some liberties taken likely: a young and doomed Ian Curtis idolozes a young and doomed Jim Morrison. As a young civil servant, he witnesses a young woman wearing a rugby cap suffer a gran mal seizure right in front of him: obtuse foreshadowing of the fate which will befall him. Too blunt? So what.

A new-built concrete apartment block accomplishes two goals: it shows the bleak urban boredom that inspired ugly UK portraits like Trainspotting or A Clockwork Orange while housing the restless, rebellious Curtis, a product of a rebuilt, stoic, angry Britain that arose from the ashes of WWII desolation. He's ready to channel that anger with a number of references to the war, Nazis, and some barely contained bitterness and sarcasm.

And you'd think he was a savvy urbanite with a privileged upbringing and world-citizen-like experience but no, you see quite clearly that he's torn between small town sensibility and desire to raise a family and wanting to make original art. That was a small surprise... You hear about Black Sabbath and Def Leppard and whoever coming up in the shadows of steel mills in places like Sheffield and Birmingham, but you don't figure the polished, cool, semi-gothic Joy Division would be from a backwater.

The real surprise though: just how insanely good the music is (especially the original performances made in the film). How desperately Curtis gets into the music, like it's contorting him, or, well, giving him fits. How vastly different Joy Division's style is compared to the punk they were replacing. Sex Pistols: angry. The Clash: fashionistas. The Buzzcocks: bridging a gap between brashness and cool. Joy Division: completely raw, inventive, emotion-evoking, autobiographical. Definitely a bit of hipster to them (watch for Curtis's overcoat early in his adult life in Macclesfield--it shocks and makes you crack a smile whether or not you're familiar with the era) but otherwise plain, middle-class, in your face, directness. I like to think Fugazi took many cues from this band, as both preferred to avoid costume, invent sounds, reject convention, and bellow cathartic mantras. Well Ok, clearly Curtis liked a little press-up now and again, but see if the spare style doesn't impress you as original.

Anyway, if you wondered what drew people to listen to a little known post punk band and hold it in higher regard than even luminaries like New Order (as I do--both are great, but Joy Division remains like a... Like a really deep and dark Velvet Underground), the performances here paint a picture of a band that rightly awed people. When the crowd reacts to Ian's manic gestures, see if you don't feel some of that surge too.

What's left out? Well, I'm not a historian of theirs, but I imagine Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook get short shrift. Wooden. Inconsequential. There's no explanation as to why they seem to dislike him and resent his illness and social and self destructive behavior. Though on the whole that's ok... It's not about them. when he wonders aloud why everyone hates him, you feel that rejection and you see the hated too.

And it does another fine thing... It captures the almost Shakespearean tragedy. He feels he's doomed, as if the illness and medication have robbed him off his youth. He's heartbroken that he has worn out a marriage that he entered into very early on (the wedding scene is like the end of The Graduate) and ruined with abandon. And that he has barely a friend and seemingly no future. The final scene, of his cremation and a short statement about his death, is as bleak as any I've seen. And you're thankful the whole thing was in black and white at that point. It's haunting.

See this if you ever had the least bit of interest in the man or the band. You won't forget it.",1474243200,,3784,4.857364341085272

As a biopic, the movie captured a few key moments in Curtis' life, but did little to capture the pain and artistry that contributed to those seminal albums and singles.

3046165,4,B00104AYGU,"It is kind of a mixed feeling when I watched this movie.
Ian is a singer who becomes a famous one.
First, the death of the singer Ian, I quite didn't understand fullheartedly the reason why.
He had a wife with a daughter but he falls in love with this woman whom no man can refuse because she is so beautiful.
Then he cannot get rid of his wife because she is such a nice woman and of course they and a baby and all.
Finally he decides to hang his neck in his house where there is his wife and his little daugher.
So then again, why he had to die? Isn't there any substitution at all?
I know that love is important but he can just choose between his wife and the girl.
He is in his peak and about to go to the Us for the tour. He is nothing but to become more famous.
His songs are always moody and sad somehow although they are rock. I get that. But there is no behind story of his that supports the reason of his behavior-death.
He has this disease that makes him keep having pills and whenever he doesn't have pills, he faints.
But is that something to do with suicide? I don't know.
The director must have thought more about his matters before making the roll of Ian I guess.
I am not saying though that this movie is a failure. It is still a well made one.
The singing parts and all. They are very good.
But the ending seems all left questionmark. Now that's something troubled for me.
There's an old world if the end is good everything is good. You know, that doesn't apply to this movie.",1461110400,,1494,4.085034013605442

Existence-well what does it matter
I exist on the best terms I can
The past is now part of my future
The present is well out of hand

The above lyrics of Ian Curtis (the sadly departed Joy Division vocalist) are a narrative in the song Heart and Soul, and these potent words are key to the world of a celebrated singer who took his own life.
Curtis was a tortured character who was physically crippled by epilepsy and mentally torn between the love of two women (one of whom was both his wife and mother to his baby daughter). He was also an artist who wanted to create music but did not seem interested in the cut throat world of fame and fortune. As his band was on the cusp of commercial kudos and an American adventure the pressure became too much for a man who has become an icon.
On May 18, 1980 a suicide at his terraced home in Macclesfield closed a dramatic passage of time that is depicted in Control, the debut Anton Corbijn directed feature film. This story of dreams and despair via the channels of love and lust is a major movie as the Curtis saga is transferred to the big screen with aplomb; and, the pages of the Touching from a Distance text (that was penned by his spouse Deborah) are animated.
The celluloid skills of a black and white shot movie come in many forms with the performances of Sam Riley (Ian) and Samantha Morton (Deborah) capturing the era and emotions of a true tale. To add to which the music that ices the action is precious with the tunes of Iggy Pop, David Bowie, The Velvet Underground and Kraftwerk aiding the proceedings. The genial gems of Joy Division in either their original format or regally reworked by the actors who take up the mantle of the band are also at the core of this phenomenal film.
There are also Unknown Pleasures in amongst the darkness and Joy Division manager Rob Gretton (who has also since passed away) provides several smiles e.g. When he tells Curtis that things could be worse as he could be the lead singer of The Fall! However, expect intensity as the chapters unravel but do not avoid Control, as this is a pristine product.",1459814400,,2149,4.432911392405063

Some creative licenses were employed in order to give the viewer a better understanding of the major events and some people's perception of reality, though no distinction is provided where reality and perception break (eg claims that Ian's relationship was platonic by Annik vs. Deborah's view of it being an affair).

I am a particular fan of the creative licence taken at the end, where it seems that all the possible factor's leading to Ian's suicide seem to collide in the end. It does a good job of conveying that no one really know the reason Ian took his own life.

3046195,4,B00104AYGU,"This film is beautifully shot and the story is well told.

I found it hard to separate the telling of this story - the film itself - from the story that was told. I was aware of the music and history of Joy Division - where they came from, the challenges of that time/place, Ian Curtis' epilepsy and the suicide. I had always thought that Ian Curtis must have been a depressed and difficult guy - but sensitive and overwhelmed. This film - and again it is a film - not a diary or documentary - showed me a completely different perspective on Ian Curtis' life.

There is the cultural narrative of the ""tortured genius"". I would describe this film's Ian Curtis as the ""torturing genius"". He steals his best friend's girlfriend by lying to her, pressures her to get married, then says he wants to have a baby with her. Meanwhile, she is supportive and loving, friendly to his bandmates...and just gets left in the dust. Ian Curtis does whatever he wants - including starting an affair with a sub par journalist - while his wife is at home with his baby. The band closes ranks around him, so his wife doesn't know a thing - even while his mistress goes on tour with them. Ouch ! The note that Ian composes for his first suicide attempt - left in the home he shares with his wife - to be found by her instructs her to ""Give my love to Annik"" (mistress). Whoa. Despite this. his wife calls an ambulance and he is saved. The film highlights many episodes where he treated his wife terribly in the most casual of ways. He is never shown physically assaulting her - but he is emotionally abusive and controlling. The context where the song ""She's Lost Control"" is written in becomes a spiteful victory song.

The film highlights many aspects of his behaviour that are very egocentric. It seems that the only time that Ian Curtis feels any anguish or concern is when it affects him directly. This lack of empathy is common in people with personality disorders, particularly narcissism. Ian's suicide, prior to the US tour for increasingly successful Joy Division, seems to be a result of his worsening epilepsy and growing performance anxiety. However - the film doesn't show Ian Curtis seeking a second medical opinion regarding treatment options for example.

It is difficult for me to separate the music and image I had of Ian Curtis prior to watching this film -from the apparent jerk who he apparently was. The film is beautiful, but the story(story or history ?) is difficult. Sometimes our heros are better left unknown.",1427241600,,2517,4.599109131403118

Hey, I'm a musician myself and I have a broad tolerance for all kinds of music, but this band sucks, even when viewed in the place and time of post punk. I went and listened to the original recordings and sure enough, the mumbled tuneless vocals and dreary lyrics showed no hidden talent. There wasn't even the raw energy of the other punk bands of the era. You certainly don't feel that this is some kind of band ready to break out and set the world on fire, and they didn't.

So the guy cheats on his wife and screws his life up with guilt, not really much of a story there. As a portrait of depression, yes, it does that very well. But to drag it on for two hours is just plain torture.

With a musician like Ian Curtis, who died especially tragically, it would be easy to fall into that trap.

But thankfully, this film avoids that.  In fact, it specifically emphasizes the damage Ian caused to his wife and family up to and including his suicide.

It doesn't paint his death as an act of salvation, or as an escape from his suffering.

No, instead it ends on his wife in pain, showing the real selfishness of his suicide.

It paints Ian as more than just this mysterious rock idol.  It shows him as human,  Deeply flawed, genuinely brilliant, but human.",1418342400,,872,4.884353741496598

3046214,4,B00104AYGU,"The music of Joy Division was informed by glam and punk and anticipated the grunge and industrial sound that came later.  Wisely filming the film in black-and-white director Anton Corbijn creates an atmosphere that mirrors the moodiness of its main character, singer Ian Curtis(Sam Riley). It's the same moodiness that portends the doom of Curtis that looms large throughout the picture like a train wreck you're unable to stop.  Aside from being a terrific rock film ""Control"" is also a great character piece painting a full bodied profile of Curtis showing the coexisting demons and angels that made him a great artist which were also his ultimate fate.  Sam Riley is nothing short of mesmerizing as Curtis avoiding the rock star clich that are the undoing of a lot of biopics.  I wasn't into Joy Division, or New Order for that matter, at the time but my wife was and she had an enthusiastic reaction to the film.",1406764800,,916,4.7784810126582276

3046217,5,B00104AYGU,"My husband kept turning to me and asking, ""Wait, is this a true story?""  You get sucked in instantly by Sam Riley and Samantha Morton.  Besides being a compelling tale, it's a great film with great performances.  You feel like you are actually there as a fly on the wall with the band.  The supporting cast are all amazing and memorable.  It's incredible, to me at least, that Sam Riley hasn't had more starring roles and was notoriously rejected by both LAMDA and RADA.  Riley really sinks into his characters.  His northern boy looks could have been used to portray Ian McCulloch with just a change of hair.  (amiright?)

What's even more amazing is that the kids playing the band actually learned their instruments so they would look like they knew what they were doing onstage but ended up playing live for the soundtrack in the concerts staged in the film.  Sam Riley's voice is incredible.  I know I blaspheme when I say that they sound better than Joy Division.  The music perfectly fits the film, capturing the mood.

There are multiple levels to the film with a few in jokes referring to other films about the time (24 Hour Party People), though all of Riley's scenes as Mark E Smith were cut.  And what you don't know is that Riley married his co-star who played Annik, Alexandra Maria Lara.  There was real chemistry there.

The cinematography in this is excellent.  Every single shot is beautifully composed.  If you are a fan of Anton Corbijn's rock icon photography, then you will certainly want to see this.  He was the photographer for many of the bands in the Nu Wave/post-punk British scene from Joy Division to Depeche Mode and Echo and the Bunnymen.

That being said, there are some problems with changing from music and feeling written down to a visual medium.  Curtis comes across as bit of a jerk and not nearly as magnetic as he must have been.  IN a film, scenes have to tell a tighter story than in reality.  It makes more sense when Corbijn reveals that about an hour's worth of scenes were cut.  (Can we please have a director's cut???)  Another issue is that 35 years on Annik revealed that the ""affair"" with Ian was never consummated.  This is totally believable because he was on heavy barbiturates that would have made it impossible.  But as a movie, don't let actually reality get in the way.  This is the closest representation you will get in film.

As a New Order fan in 1980s Los Angeles, getting to know Joy Division was easy because they were on KROQ's playlist.  We loved New Order to distraction, it wasn't a dance party without them.  Certainly Joy Division would have been as popular as New Order had Ian still been around.  So when we heard New Order used to be Joy Division, we loved that music too.  Love Will Tear Us Apart was on all the video shows, so we saw Bernard and Hooky with a different singer and it was like, whoa.

The commentary track with Anton Corbijn delivers a wealth of information and the extra concert footage is really cool.  And now it's only 8 bucks.  I rented from Netflix.  I'm thinking I just might buy it.",1403308800,,3079,4.542805100182149

I expected a good film based on reviews, but Control surpassed my expectations and that rarely happens anymore.  That is, more films disappoint than surprise in terms of quality.
The movie feels like a documentary.  Sam Riley's portrayal of Ian Curtis is uncanny.  The tone of the movie captures the feel of the times just as I remember it.  And it also has the air of something remembered that is hard for me to explain here.  The acting is uniformly excellent, with the actors fully inhabiting their roles and never falling into caricature.  One of the most interesting things about the movie is how the director, Anton Corbijn, maintains the proper degree of tension for each character's story, subtly shifting perspective to make each person whole, and sympathetic.
This is a great movie, regardless of the viewer's knowledge of Joy Division.  For those unfamiliar with their work, this film is likely to lead them to the music.  The film bears watching over and over and it should be near the top of any list of music films, documentary or otherwise.",1388102400,2,1172,4.678048780487805

Sam Riley is mezmerizing as the doomed Ian Curtis who suffered terribly from epilepsy and committed suicide May 18, 1980 at age 23. The film covers 1973 to his death and was co produced by the singer's wife Deborah who also wrote a book called Touching From a Distance. Highly recommended.",1379203200,,587,4.9393939393939394

3046230,5,B00104AYGU,"Didn't think I was going to like this, but being a casual fan of Joy Division knew the film was worth a look see.  Wonderfully cast all round, but the standouts are the actors who play Ian and his wife, Deborah Curtis:  Sam Riley and Samantha Morton, respectively.  Sam Riley's practically a dead ringer especially when filmed at a distance for the Joy Division's lead singer - in stature, body frame and facial structure, all except his tell tale brown eyes.  For the record, Ian Curtis' most striking feature was his almost transparent, otherworldly eyes.

Anyone who knows the story of Joy Division is aware that this tale does not have a happy ending.  Don't have to spell it out.  The trajectory is doomed from the start so, of course, this in effect bogs down the whole enterprise.  That said, the script, based on the book by Deborah Curtis, rings strikingly true to life, and in fact feels like cinema verite at its finest.  Sam Riley does his own singing and is nothing less than remarkable in his evocation.  And, as suspected, all band members played their own instruments too.  In fact, there is nothing more phony than musical biopics with actors miming to a dubbed soundtrack.  So, by way of legitimate performance, the film becomes stunningly on point.

Can't imagine that any fan of the band Joy Division would want to pass this up.  The only negative thing I can offer is that the heavy accents made it hard to decipher the dialogue at times.  Also, the depiction of Ian's ""jump off,"" Annik Honore, rings rather superficial.  And she doesn't come off as a sympathetic character, being she broke up a family with a baby via the affair that she continues to deny.  Clearly, the story's told through Deborah's eyes.  Even still, the film, directed by Ian Curtis' friend and accomplished photographer, Anton Corbijn (who took iconic early photos of the band), makes a wonderful tribute to the memory of Ian Curtis and the band Joy Division.",1375920000,,1953,4.727810650887574

3046236,4,B00104AYGU,"Anton Corbijn directs his first major feature film-length production, about the short life of his friend, Ian Curtis.  This movie is the visual representation of Deborah Curtis' biography of her husband's life,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Touching-from-a-Distance-Ian-Curtis-and-Joy-Division/dp/0571239560/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Touching from a Distance: Ian Curtis and Joy Division</a>.  Tony Wilson's wife at the time (Lindsay Reade) also contributed to this biopic in her book.

Curtis, an epileptic with major depressive disorder, was the singer, lyricist and leader of Manchester, England band Joy Division.  Ian Curtis committed suicide the night before he was supposed to leave for the band's first major American tour.  He left behind a distraught girlfriend, an estranged wife (and a 2 yr old daughter), disappointed band mates (who went on to form New Order) and a devastated Tony Wilson (the head of the bands' label, Factory Records).

Anton Corbijn established a relationship with Ian Curtis as Joy Division's band photographer.  Corbijn also directed Atmosphere, a Joy Division music video released in 1988.  Friendly with Ian, this is Corbijn's gift to Curtis, Deborah, their daughter, the bandmates, Tony Wilson, the Legacy of Joy Division.

This biopic was shown at the Cannes Film Festival to rave reviews, and it won a few European film awards.

Nonetheless, I found it quite engrossing. The production design and photography are absolutely stunning, giving us hard reality and grit without a let up. The acting is superb, especially Sam Riley as Ian Curtis, the tormented lead singer of Joy Division. Riley bears an uncanny resemblance to Curtis during the performance scenes. Truly uncanny. I don't think we ever get any real idea what drove Curtis to make the decisions he did -- perhaps we're not supposed to know or never can know. Those looking for uplift, happy endings and a fully explained story line will probably find this film disappointing. Well, I have to admit that it disappoints me in those respects, but everything else about this picture is so incredibly well-done that I don't care.",1363651200,,991,4.904761904761905

It's one of the best biopics I've seen. Even if you don't listen to Joy Division or like their music, I think that you'll find something to appreciate about this film.

We were of the same age group and had a band ourselves, we listened to J-D and admired them.  I am a lifelong artist and have never tolerated the repetition of musical cliches, just like J-D.
Much of the movie was unbearable to watch, because of how Ian Curtis made the one bad choice I avoided: he married his highschool girlfriend at 18, became a father immediately, then discovered how his own personal development was stifled by his marriage obligations.
Of course, I also knew how the story would end, and had to watch his life unravel.
The music and poetry of Joy Division are phenomenal, and it was marvelous to see and hear the band perform, marvelous portrayals, writing and direction!

3046248,5,B00104AYGU,"Before watching this film, it struck me how many ways they could get this film wrong - pandering to his wife (who co-wrote the script), unconvincing acting and, perhaps the greatest potential error: pretentious directing.

The good news is that the film avoided all of these pitfalls and was actually way better than I expected (for such an acclaimed film). Although not a ray of sunshine, the acting was convincing and the plot wasn't too focused around the bleak side of Ian Curtis. In my opinion, it seemed in keeping with Stephen Morris' description of Curtis being ""an ordinary bloke just like you or me, liked a bit of a laugh, a bit of a joke.""

And as for the story being biased in favour of his wife, the story seemed fair when it came to Annik Honore (Curtis' alleged mistress), portraying her as more of a friend, rather than any sort of bad influence.

Of course, if you don't like bleak films or biopics about troubled rock singers, then this isn't for you.

However, if you want to see a fairly balanced and well-researched treatment of the story of Ian Curtis, which shows him as a 3 dimensional, fairly normal guy, then this is about the best you'll get.

It's also worth mentioning that I'm not really a fan of Joy Division and have only really ever heard 1 or 2 of their songs. If you're concerned that this film is an inpenetrable geeky fan portrayal then don't worry - it's not.",1324944000,2,1398,4.509881422924901
3046249,4,B00104AYGU,"An awesome film from start to finish, it is primarily a biography of Ian Curtis and charts his marriage to Deborah, his love affair with another woman, his involvement in the band and his struggle with epilepsy and depression. It also covers the rise of the band itself: although this is not the central thread, this aspect is quite well covered. Given the subject material and well known denouement, it's not easy watching but I was deeply moved by Sam Riley and Samantha Morton's outstanding performances as Ian and Deborah. The monochrome filming adds to the sense of place and time and I can't imagine that it would have worked in colour.

The music lifts the mood. Apparently the actors played all the music sets themselves and Riley seems to have Curtis' style, mannerisms and delivery down perfectly. Joe Anderson (Hook), James Anthony Pearson (Sumner) and Harry Treadaway (Morris) are seriously convincing. Indeed, this is where I believe that the film scores highly over the documentary ""Joy Division"" which included only a few abbreviated exerpts of the band's performances. It's ironic that fans should have to turn to a dramatisation for a good portfolio of JD music. Three full performances (by the actors) are also provided on the DVD as extras - Transmission, Leaders of Men and Candidate - and Corbijns (rather odd) video for the song Atmosphere is also included.

All that said, I can't really see this as a film for general viewing - the subject is too esoteric and (let's face it) grim - but if you're a fan of the band or of the music of that era you can't afford not to own this.

Biopics can often feel forced, created less by vision than inevitability. The cast of ""Control"" have chemistry; there is a cool smoothness to these short-spoken people, and which permeates the film. But nothing really special emerges.

The upshot is, I was never sucked into the movie to a depth where I no longer noticed its Hollywood machinery, hear the producer saying, ""time for a sex scene,"" ""time for a time jump."" I just didn't care. Some will dig it. I did not.

Maybe it's me. It's not a bad movie. Just not *great,* perhaps not enough for most people without a strong connection to punk/post-punk. Although with a little patience, I could well see this slow-moving film may serve as a meditative backdrop for some good old pondering about the human condition, fame, fear, and the banality that forms the undercurrent of most of our lives.

Control won 25 awards, including three at Cannes, and was nominated for two BAFTA awards in the UK. The film is yet to receive a Blu-ray release in the US, but has been released in Germany and Canada. This review covers the Canadian version, which is locked to Region A.

The film made just under $8 million worldwide owing to the dark subject matter and the fact that Joy Division's music still isn't widely known. That's a shame because Corbijn (The American) has made a wonderful film.

This is the story of Ian Curtis who was the lead singer for Joy Division until his suicide in 1980. He died on May 18, so it was 31 years ago today at the time of writing.

I wanted to see the film because Joy Division is still one of my Top 5 bands 30 years later. I know who made me the tape so that I could hear debut album Unknown Pleasures for the first time and I remember who I was with and where I was when the news leaked that Curtis was dead.

It wasn't easy to find a theater which was showing the film when it was released so I ended up hunting down an obscure run-down cinema in downtown Toronto to even see it. About six other people showed up. Every single one appeared deeply moved and on the verge of tears after the film. I'm happy to finally own it on Blu-ray.

The main problem I have with this review is that I went in loving the band and knowing most of the story. Did it work for me because of that, or is it truly a great story that will appeal to people who know nothing about Curtis or Joy Division? It partly depends on whether you like the dark, brooding music, but it works for some people who don't like the band at all.

The film is bleak. It appears in black and white and is set in a northern town in England (Macclesfield). The houses are small, the streets are narrow and it rains often. This is all true. It's a depressing part of the country. The dreary setting matches the atmosphere of the music and the band's tale. The film shows how the band came into existence and their early successes such as recording, getting a recording contract and appearing on TV, but this isn't a true biopic.

Although I knew the lyrics and understood what the words meant before I saw the film, I didn't know the origin of those lyrics. The film ties together some of the events in the life of Curtis with the origin of the songs. When you see what She's Lost Control is really about, it adds new layers of meaning. If you think Love Will Tear Us Apart sounds like a pop song, it takes on a more sinister tone when you understand why he wrote it.

The actors rehearsed together to get the songs right so that they could play them in the film rather than miming. Corbijn never intended to include real performances of the music, but the ""band"" convinced him. The first time I heard the first note of the first song played in the film, I felt a huge surge of emotion.

Sam Riley manages to look very similar to Curtis and must have spent a long time studying the few examples of Curtis performing the songs. He mimics the actions perfectly and sounds like him too. It was almost like stepping back in time and experiencing a Joy Division concert. Samantha Morton gives a strong performance, managing to look like a young girl and then his wife and the mother of his child.

There's a lot of truth in this film too. Deborah Curtis (his wife) wrote the book Touching From A Distance which tells what really happened. The screenplay was adapted from that book and the details are as true as possible. Corbijn shot some of the iconic photographs of Curtis and the band while working as a photographer for the New Musical Express in England. This was a labor of love.

The result is a moving drama detailing the final few years of Curtis' life. It doesn't hold much back, showing his faults as well as his redeeming qualities. It's the story of a young man (23 when he died) who was in a situation he couldn't control. Loving and hating two different women, a parent at a young age, success at a level that was hard to imagine and all the while dealing with epilepsy. His character says in the film that the audience didn't realize how much he gave during a performance, or how draining it was and how painful to access the emotions to perform those songs. To the audience, they were songs. To Curtis, they were hideous parts of his life.

I found the film incredibly moving, haunting, captivating, happy and sad. I'm glad that Curtis will be introduced to new audiences through this film. Joy Division is important to me and Control is one of the most prized Blu-rays in my collection.

Video Quality 4.5/5
The film was shot in color and transferred to black and white and the images suit the mood of the film perfectly. Detail is sharp throughout and the print is clean and natural in appearance. I have also seen the German release and the presentation is similar. It's hard to imagine the film looking any better.

Audio Quality 5/5
The sound is the best I have ever heard where music is concerned. It's as good as listening to a CD on high quality equipment. The songs have a lot of depth and range and it's easy to pick out individual instruments. The dialogue is also clear.

Joy Division's music isn't for everyone, but this is an interesting look at the life of Ian Curtis whether you are a fan or not. The presentation from Alliance is superb and I would recommend it to anyone capable of viewing Region A material. The actors do a wonderful job and the music sounds authentic. It will send shivers down your spine.

3046255,5,B00104AYGU,"This has been one of my favorite movies since it came out. I love Sam Riley as Ian and, of course, the music is great  :) The black & white works really well. One thing I like a lot about this movie is the way that character's moods & thoughts are not always explicitly stated or spelled out to the viewer, making the movie far more subtle and interesting. Overall, well done!",1296604800,,376,4.222222222222222
3046256,5,B00104AYGU,"The movie captures the mood of the late 70's Callahan and Thatcher Britain superbly and gives as detailed a rationale for Ian Curtis' suicide as you will ever receive, acknowledging that this ""history"" is written strongy from the perspective of his wife, but then again, who really ever knew him better than her ? I wish that more filming was made in the authentic surroundings of Macclesfield, or even Manchester, rather than Nottingham, but that, and what seemed to me to be the excessive beautification of Annik, (she was far more Siouxsie than a 1980 ""Anne Hathaway"" in real life)are ""nits"". Riley's resemblance to Curtis is remarkable in so many ways. I find myself watching youtube footage of the movie and the band and truly blending one with the other in my mind.",1295740800,,771,4.804511278195489
3046257,4,B00104AYGU,"Ian Curtis is the lead singer of Joy Division, a group which is anything but joyful.  I always enjoyed the song, Love Will Tear Us Apart, even though other songs don't really reach me and move me very much.  This movie is the story of Ian's short life before he committed suicide.  For me, who knew little about the person or the group, I found the story at the beginning confusing and wasn't hooked on the music and the supposed greatness of it.  None of the characters appear that likable though after awhile I grew a bit interested in the story and the filmmaking.  In the end, I liked the movie enough to give it 4 stars but didn't feel any attachment with the group or Ian Curtis.  Samantha Morton is most welcome as a familiar face in a sea of strangers.  She plays Ian's wife who finds his body.",1294617600,,802,4.306666666666667
3046258,4,B00104AYGU,"I haven't watched a lot of biopics about doomed rock musicians but I did have some expectations about the tone: loud, showy, melodramatic, maudlin. I was much surprised by this movie's tone. This was a film about a BRITISH doomed artist, a NORTHERN ENGLISH artist at that, and, apparently, in the seventies, the good old way British way of feeling and expressing was not yet dead. Poor Ian Curtis largely suffered in silence, as did the people he hurt. When his wife Debbie barks at him over her discovery of his mistress, the effect is jarring. No one else really raises their voice afterwards until Ian's final tirade near the end. This stoic incidentally is a working class bloke who is polite to his teacher, helpful to clients at work (when he entered the employment office first time I thought he was looking for work; no, he worked there). He moves in a world where the F bomb is dropped constantly but doesn't swear much himself. He lives in a world where it takes a few moments for a viewer to notice that the film is in black-and-white. He kills himself in large part over guilt over having an affair; who does that in these degenerate times? And whoever heard of another rocker doing it? (I'm sure rock history buffs will know someone; I don't.)

Sam Riley is good as Curtis, though he conveyed pain better when he was suffering in silence than when he was begging for help. Samantha Morton played the put-upon wife as if she had never been anyone else much less played anyone else. As the mistress, Alexandra Maria Lara was irresistible, a fact that made Curtis's agony complete. Toby Kebbell gave the film a small dose of comic relief.

I liked the music too which was a surprise since I disliked the only CD I've heard from that era.",1288915200,,1747,4.560509554140127
3046259,4,B00104AYGU,"This is quite a beautiful film, very much in
the tradition of English cinema of the 60's - with
understated and nuanced performances all 'round.
Bleak and disquieting, the film takes you on a very
harrowing journey.
One not to be missed.",1286323200,,237,4.666666666666667
3046260,5,B00104AYGU,"As much as I enjoy this great movie, each time I watch it I can't help but think how startled Ian Curtis would probably have been to know that it would be his legacy to be remembered as the tragic figure Control (and to a much lesser extent 24 Hour Party People) made him out to be, instead of the social rebel he thought he was. The actual Curtis swore and drank, had temper fits, could be temperamental and difficult to friend and loved-one alike, and was known for his loud, scathing diatribes, including a famous one in which he blasted David Bowie for living to age thirty, despite the tone of Bowie's 1970s ode to dying young, ""All The Young Dudes"". In contrast the Ian Curtis of Control was a suffering martyr figure with a quiet, Keats-like delicacy that gave him a wispy quality that really doesn't gel with what we know of the flesh and blood man.

Having said all that, Control is still one of the most watchable films that's ever been made about the rock and roll scene. It is a both a labor of love and an artistic remembrance of a place and time and those who lived there. The story it tells can be either criticized as a subjective exercise in idealism, or praised for its close connection to those participants in and around Joy Division (Tony Wilson, Deborah and Natalie Curtis, the guys from New Order) who remained alive at the time of filming. One member of the band went on record as saying that the events depicted in Control were not much like they were in reality, but added that in telling Curtis' story, Control improved things, making the story more dramatic and approachable.

No commentary on this film would be complete without mentioning both the brilliance of its soundtrack and the meticulous reenactments of its concert scenes. Many of the locations from Curtis' life and death were actually used in the making of Control, adding an unmistakable punch to the plot. Finally, the fine acting on the part of virtually everyone who appeared onscreen was a delight to see, with Samantha Morton and Sam Riley turning out emotional performances that deserved Oscar recognition: something an outside film like Control would never get in Hollywood.

Like Ian Curtis himself, Control isn't perfect but it's still darn interesting.",1282176000,,2254,4.70126582278481
3046261,4,B00104AYGU,"Beautifully realized art film about a wasted life. Stunningly photographed, brilliantly written and acted, however, unfortunately about someone not worthy of having had a film made about him. So selfish, so self centered, as though he was the only one whose life mattered, devastating the wife who loved him, betraying his band, his manager whose dialogue in the film is totally outstanding. From its first frame it's a visual feast in black and white, each angle like a painting and therefore I enjoyed watching it, but since I wasn't familiar with Ian Curtis' bio, I was disappointed that I wasted my time seeing a film about a waste of a human being and my Brazilian wife was even more pissed than I. Yet, one cannot but applaud the purely genius filmmaking, a treat to anyone who loves cinema as an art form.",1280966400,,812,4.725352112676056
3046262,5,B00104AYGU,"If you are expecting another run-of-the-mill biopic about a drug-addled rock star and are thinking that you don't really need to see another one of those, I urge you to throw your inhibitions to the wind and snatch up this superb film, for it is far from run-of-the-mill.  In fact, `Control' may be the best biopic of this nature I've seen in quite some time.

The film tells the story of Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis.  At a very young age (and I mean VERY young) Ian found himself married, fronting a rock back, thrust into fatherhood and rising to superstardom.  While all of those things are what dreams are made of, when you add to the mix harrowing epileptic seizures and medications with undesirable side effects you find your protagonist beyond depressed and unable to cope with the strains of each individual responsibility.  A mistress on the road certainly doesn't help any (especially when your wife finds out).  Yes, `Control' is about a tortured musician, but not in the vein of most films in this genre.  This man's torment was even more poignant because of his inability to rise above it.

It's hard to believe that a lot of what makes this film so great comes from newcomers to the game.  Everything about this film feels so mature, so authentic.  It baffles me that this is Anton Corbijn's debut film.  Nothing about this film says `amateur' at all.

The decision to shoot the film in black and white was genius, adding crisp layers of style and flair.  The way he frames each actor, each scene, each musical experience feels straight out of a magazine, yet it never feels like he's intentionally `glamming' up anything.  This film retains its raw appeal without losing an ounce of finesse.

The screenplay, written by Matt Greenhalgh, is a stunning piece of work.  What I found so moving about it was that it highlighted Curtis's youth with subtle flourishes, exposing the faults within his own impatience that helped propel him to his doom.  Notice the way he does everything pertinent to his life is with a nonchalance and rashness that almost spells failure before it progresses.  The way he proposes, the way he suggests a child; it's done without any real thought given, showing his immaturity.  And yet, when his world begins to spiral out of control we are given a more intimate look at very mature emotions.  The way that Corbijn allows his actors (namely Sam Riley) to express what is racing through their minds, with prolonged shots of distilled faces and silent afflictions, is just magnificently real and unquestionably stirring to the soul.

I also really loved the use of music here.  A lot of times with a musician's biopic, the music can fall to one of two extremes; either it feels like an afterthought, used because it has to be, or it feels too influential, giving the events in the musician's life a veneer of manufactured realities.  Here, the music feels like a real part of the film.  It doesn't drive the film, which is key, but it illuminates the emotions and is used as a catalyst for great character development.

And that brings me to the performances found within this brilliant biopic.

Alexandra Maria Lara is beautiful (and I mean B-E-A-UTIFUL) and she can act too, delivering a simple and subtle look at a woman falling in love with a man she can't have completely.  Toby Kebbell is also strikingly good as Joy Division's manager.  His smooth swagger is key to developing a character with polished arrogance.  Samantha Morton (one of the best actresses working today, no exceptions) is flawless here.  I love what she was able to do with a very clich&eacute;d character (suffering spouse).  It's not like there is a lot of originality within the character (it is what it is) but she brings so much heartfelt emotion to her every scene.  Hearing her utter those heartbreaking words, ""I don't deserve this"", literally made me shiver.  What Sam Riley does with the scene afterwards is astonishing.  Yes, the way he completely melts down before the camera without once betraying honest emotion for forced theatrics is stunning.  Sam Riley is a god here.  Nothing against the likes of Jamie Foxx and Joaquin Phoenix who came before him, but they can't even compare to the raw earnest realism that Riley pulled out of this character.  Forget that apparent mimicry found in the Oscar loved performances, Riley captures a soul as apposed to a mannerism.  He lives and breathes this performance, and it shows in his unwavering from character.

In the end I highly recommend this film.  It is far more than one would expect it to be, for it focuses on a man who is not far removed from the youth of today.  He wanted it all, and he thought he could handle it, but at the ripe old age of 23 it proved too heavy for his fragile shoulders.",1280361600,,4781,4.712048192771085
3046263,3,B00104AYGU,"This movie, based on Deborah Curtis' book Touching from a Distance, is a little lopsided...and I guess it should be. Obviously Mrs. Curtis' life was torn apart by Ian's isolation due to his affair, mental state, medical condition, and suicide. So you get the sense that this is Ian's story being told by a jilted lover. I do not mean that to be harsh. Deborah should have been angry. But it would have been nice to see more of the creation of the band and the conversations Ian had with his band mates, friends, family, etc...

I can recommend this as a Joy Division/Ian Curtis/New Order fan but I would have preferred the whole story and not just one side of it.

Check out the Joy Division doc that is available as well. I liked that a lot more.",1271635200,,747,4.366906474820144
3046264,4,B00104AYGU,"You know the story. Ian Curtis, lead singer/songwriter for Joy Division, tragically ends his young life just as one of the most influential post-punk UK bands from the late 70's begins their climb to fame.

This movie begged to be filmed in black and white, and thankfully Anton Corbijn had the good sense to do it. The cinematography, score (if you want to call it a ""score"" - it is mainly songs by other artists, such as Bowie, Lou Reed, and Kraftwerk, that influenced Curtis), and casting are all top notch. Sam Riley is uncanny as Ian Curtis, and Samantha Morton as Debbie Curtis and Alexandra Maria Lara as Annik Honore probably could not have been cast better either. Tony Kebbel is a kick to watch as Rob Gretton.

As long is one is aware the movie focuses primarily on Curtis's relationship with his wife and his affair with Annik Honore, all is well. And there is enough musical footage thrown in to satisfy most Joy Division fans, which, I might add, is as about as realistic as one could ever expect from a movie. There are however, two or three parts of the film of which I must be critical. The first is technical in nature but to me is huge. There is a scene in the studio when the engineer is taping ""Isolation"" - Ian is laying down the vocal track to the already existing band tracks. Why in God's name, after putting so much effort into getting Riley to sound like Curtis (which in 90% of the movie was amazingly successful), do they allow him to sing Isolation in a way which sounds nothing like Curtis at all? This scene mystifies me completely. Riley sounds like a sick choir boy, so I was expecting the engineer to say ""Ian, what's wrong?""...but at the end of the song he tells him, essentially, ""great job, that's a wrap"". Sorry, no. That vocal track isn't even close to reality. The second issue is with the ending. Corbijn seems to be suggesting Ian took his life primarily as a result of his anguish over relationship issues, his love for Annik and guilt over what he had done to his wife. This is of course a distinct possibility, and no one will ever know the truth, but to those who know the history, the music, the lyrics, the environment, the epilepsy....this implication seems a little over-simplistic (although to be fair, since the movie was based on Debbie Curtis's book ""Touching From a Distance"", perhaps Corbijn was trying to stay true to what she had written, and I have not read that book). Also, Corbijn made it seem Curtis's suicide was almost a ""last minute"", or at best, a ""last hour"", decision. Again....maybe. But it didn't ring true to my sense of what was likely. Your mileage may vary. Finally, I was disappointed there was no mention of the album ""Closer"", even though we hear tracks from it. Odd to say the least.

Certainly a film worth seeing, but for the true Joy Division aficionado, get the documentary by Grant Gee. Superb.",1267747200,,2879,4.543352601156069

Success means that he attracts more attention and

3046268,4,B00104AYGU,"I remember first hearing Ian Curtis' haunting, gloomily dictatorial croon in the 2001 semi classic ""Donnie Darko"" and as a kid listening to Nine Inch Nails' version of ""Dead Souls"" on ""The Crow"" soundtrack.  They struck me, and still do, as one of the darkest bands I have ever heard--move over, all you candya** contemporary posers like Manson or Evanescence.  One might even say that they went full circle with the lyrics of insanity, impending doom, etc with Curtis' absurdly early demise.  They were the real thing.

Anton Corbjin's ""Control"" is not so much about the band Joy Divison itself as Curtis' life.  Shot in a sort of sepia black and white style typical of his photography, a minimalist approach to this enigmatic and ultra tragic figure is employed to maximum effect.  Inspired by Deborah Curtis's ""Touching From A Distance"", a biopic on her tumultuous relationship with Curtis, I couldn't but feel that some of the uglier aspects of Curtis' personality--and the very real possibility that he faked his epilepsy--were glossed over.  We don't see much of the monstrous behavior Curtis would often display, like dumping a Bloody Mary on his wife's head for dancing with a friend at their wedding, or nearly kicking in Tony Wilson's door (the scene makes his verbal assault on the legendary music producer seem ""cool"") when he didn't get his way.

Don't get me wrong, this is a fine film and illustrates well how Curtis' infidelity and non-communicativeness, worlds apart seemingly from everyone else, may have led to his tragic demise. It is also a fantastic portrayal of the post industrial punk scene of that time.  But I can't help wondering if there was something else going on besides these things.  Ian Curtis was a person who did not want help.  Deborah Curtis suggested he see a psychologist on numerous occasions and he absolutely refused to do so.

The film illustrates some very real possibilities, but I doubt that the final book or film on Curtis has been written or made.  That said, this is a nearly great film everyone who has any interest a classic band and a sad musical figure should see.",1254268800,,2120,4.855555555555555
3046269,5,B00104AYGU,"First and most important, this movie is about Ian Curtis, not about the band itself. Anyone going into this movie who wants to see the best bio on Joy Division will be disappointed. The director himself says this is about Ian's life, his troubles etc...

Second it is a beautiful movie, what I loved about it is you really get a sense of what Ian was going through, you can feel it. The lyrics in his songs make so much sense and bring new meaning to the songs based on what he was going through in life. One conception I always had about Joy Division that was squashed in this movie is the fact I was always pissed Ian took his own life. His music was so good, timeless, and brillant. After seeing this film I doubt, even if he would have not killed himself he would have continued. Joy Division would not have survived.

Again this is a wonderful movie about a troubled man and one of the most important figures in rock. Any TRUE Joy Division fan will enjoy this movie which is entirely in black and white.",1253750400,,1008,4.3

I was not into Joy Division at the time, but this movie, and the lyrics in the songs sent shivers through my soul. I have since watched the film several more times and cannot get enough of it. The emotion and the bleakness of life in Manchester in the late 70's is portrayed excellently, and Sam Riley puts EVERYTHING into his performance and he was cast perfectly by Corbijn.

A must see for anyone with intelligence, and a passion for art, and the beauty and darkness of life and the 'human condition'. Who says young people can't be depressed?",1253404800,,665,4.4958677685950414

The flight was booked, they were ready to go. But something really nasty happened. That may sound like a familiar rock & roll tune, but I thought this film was particularly well done, with a sense of realism and fine performances.",1251936000,,510,4.4361702127659575
3046272,4,B00104AYGU,"I'm reading reviews on this film that have been both positive and negative, but agree with the many that have written that you must be a fan of the group, and understand a little about Ian's motivations and problems to get the most from it.  Coupled with that, you must also understand the time and the place.  If you don't, it is unlikely that you will be able to comprehend what all the fuss is about, let alone write a fair review for this film.  I have read several books on the group, and have also read Deborah Curtis's account in her book `Touching from a distance.'  My interest in the group also reached into my own musical performances.  The band I was drummer for would always kick of every gig with a rendition of `No Love lost.'

`Control' is a look at the short, brilliant life of Ian Curtis from the years 1973 to 1980.  At that time there was a major depression in the UK, particularly in the North of England.  At this time it was not unusual for youngsters to have major angst and a feeling of despair with the state of the nation.  This film shows that those feelings were often twinned with a glimmer of hope of breaking free of it.  This picture is a look at all of those things.  Coupled with a tragic end for Curtis, and a new, albeit uncertain beginning for the surviving members (who went on to form New Order.)  Ironically New Order went on to be more successful, which makes this story even more incredible, given Curtis's obvious genius.

The film is shot in Black and White mainly because most of the Joy Division photography from the time was shot in Black and White (A smart move by Corbjin).  The actors play most of the music as a group in this film and I'm not sure if it's ever been done as successfully as it's done here.  They actually gel pretty well, and its very impressive considering they only rehearsed for a few weeks.

The acting is very believable.  Sam Riley as Ian Curtis is quite literally mind-blowing. Riley's performance carries the film as the troubled, epileptic, genius singer-songwriter, of an up and coming band.  Torn between his obligations as a husband and father, and his quest to be the quintessential rock and roll star.  Samantha Morton fills the role of Deborah superbly.  She plays Ian's young wife and mother to newly born Natalie.  She is the most humane character of the film, and is consistently and intensely worried about Ian's state of mind throughout.

Other great performances come from Toby Kebbell as Rob Gretton (Joy Division's spirited and dynamic manager.) and Joe Anderson as Peter Hook.  In fact Anderson does a perfect impersonation of Hooky both physically and verbally, he also gets to be the hard- case of the group, especially when a fight breaks out because of Ian's refusal to go on stage.  These characters also provide some humor, which serves to allow some light in, despite the darkness of the film.

For me, the films end evoked deep emotion because of the fact that Ian was so young when he passed.  However at the same time, it made me smile, because Joy Division's legacy is all around us.  They really put the Manchester music scene on the map and paved the way for the likes of The Happy Mondays, The Stone Roses, Oasis, and many others.  He also influenced Moby, and The Killers.  With that said Ian's death was a tragedy of a young man who could not cope, but what we can be thankful for from his life and his unfortunate death is the wonderful catalogue of music he left behind in such a short career and the many who he influenced and still influences today.  Thank-you Ian.",1251676800,,3577,4.517884914463453

Joy Division was incredible! Innovative and, they just plain rocked. I do think that in the film they shouldve focused on the other members more because everyone in the group was super talented. The director did a superb job in depicting the isolation, disappointment, anger, and pain Ian lived through. Even though he did bring some of it on himself. The film shows a young kid who was, completely human, bored, and looking for his escape from Manchester. The black and white film color depicts Ian's seemingly gray mood cleverly, almost like your looking through his eyes. Sam Riley really looks like the real Ian Curtis , and he played the part perfectly, although his voice isn't as awkward and strange as Ian's, but the cast did a great rendition. And it also stayed genuine, depicting the disregard and disrespect Ian had for his poor wife. Its crazy because he would write songs about her and he cheated on her, poor woman must've been humiliated. Very good movie. Interesting character study.",1247961600,,1170,4.797029702970297
3046274,4,B00104AYGU,"Anton Corbijn, who had been one of the staff photographers on the NME in the 80's and 90's has produced a beautiful movie on Ian Curtis and Joy Division. If you know the way that Mr Corbijn used to make photographs for that musical weekly, it is visually slightly different. Instead of grainy images with innovative angles of vision, we get a very straightforward photography that suits the storyline well. Of course, if you know rock, Joy Division or even if you have read the book by his wife, you will already know the storyline by heart. WE discover Joy Division to be just another band...but with a very strong new musical approach. Since the movie is based on her book (Touching from a distance) the book does of course provide a sympathetic image of Debbie Curtis but  also a rather neutral one of his on-the-road mistress Annik Honore. Apparently the main actor sang and the band played themselves which is very surprising because they are excellent and sound and look very much like the original band. The portrayal of Ian Curtis as a talented young man who suddenly becomes this iconic leader of a post-punk band is excellently portrayed and we see his disintegration by his epilepsy and alcohol lead to his early death. As Corbijn says in the excellent interview: it was alcohol combined with exhaustion and his epilepsy drugs that made him more depressed and made small problems seem unsurmountable. Indeed as he said a man loved by 2 women does usually not commit suicide. Anyway it is a very discreet and beautiful movie.",1247961600,,1535,4.749063670411985
3046275,3,B00104AYGU,"SPOILERS AHEAD....

Ian Curtis, lead singer of Joy Division, killed himself in ""gray and miserable"" Macclesfield in 1980 at the age of 23.  Anton Corbijn's ""Control,"" shot in black and white, gets the gray and miserable parts of Curtis' life exactly right. The movie is based on a book by Curtis' wife Deborah. They were married when he was 19 and she was 18. They had a child. He was depressed. He joined a band. He began having epileptic seizures. He started cheating on his wife. The band started to become successful. The seizures got worse. The end.

Director Corbijn is known mainly as a rock photographer and, though well-acted, the movie feels a bit like a slideshow -- full of memorable (and depressing) imagery, plus concert performances that capture the look, feel and sound of Joy Division's live shows. As a biopic, it's a major contrast to a movie like ""I'm Not There"" which expands on the persona(s) of the artist and finds new ways to dramatize the impact of a creative life.  ""Control"" reduces Curtis' life to an oppressive kitchen sink drama.  It's realistic, but not uplifting. And you already know how it ends.  If you know nothing about Ian Curtis and Joy Division you'll get a better understanding about his and the band's impact on the world by reading Wikipedia than you will by watching this film.",1246579200,2,1322,4.726086956521739

3046279,4,B00104AYGU,"Train wrecks are endlessly fascinating, especially when the passengers are young, so talented and so full of potential.  ""Control"" gives us the disaster everyone now sees coming.  The script is based on the book ""Touching From A Distance"" by Deborah Curtis, wife of the late Ian Curtis.  Her memories and director Anton Corbijn's eye for texture drive this rather slow, mannered take on the Joy Division story.  Sitting room aridity and Euro artiness seem inevitable with this particular concoction.  It's a worthwhile exercise but fortunately just one version of a music phenom's howl in the night.  The recent Joy Division documentary is an essential companion piece and a must see for all devotees of the band and post-punk.  Corbijn's film, on the other hand, gives us a young man who could not reconcile his hasty marriage with a compulsion to scream out his dark phantoms from the stage.

The Dutchman's cinematography is bleak but beautiful, the end of the film, as expected, wrenching.  And yet the last leap is more a relief, a kind of release, than an emotional gut punch.  Curtis had an interior as grim as his surroundings, an internal landscape drained of fellow feeling by a fascination with the abomination, but the descent needs a counterpoint.  Curtis had a laddishness too.  When Curtis (Sam Riley) explains ""Man City Blue"" to his Belgian girlfriend Anik, there is a glimmer of the submerged Manc scally.  The real Curtis supported a football team, drank pints, and engaged in elaborate pranks with his bandmates, all barely out of school (they were particularly fond of a turd holding challenge).  The trajectory of ""Control"" doesn't allow for the contrast of British bluster and reserve.  The film gives us only the latter, to the extreme, which in a way seems a clich.  The visual acuity of the film is undeniable, however.  The marital meltdown is equally powerful for its authenticity, and Riley does a very good spastic chicken dance and pale-eyed gaze to the beyond: both trademarks of a seer too soon felled.",1242432000,,2034,4.952802359882006

Yet ""Control"" is not really about Joy Division. There is not much music; the film makes no mention, none whatsoever, of the band's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/second/dp/B000VZC4CQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">second</a>&nbsp;and final album. The actors went to the trouble of learning to play some of the songs, but they can't help sounding amateurish -- if you haven't heard the songs before, you are unlikely to understand why there was anything special about them.

Moreover, the other band members come across as louts. This provides the film's few memorable lines of dialogue, but seems unfair. Watching ""Control,"" one might believe that Ian had no interaction with his own band. He is shown attacking Bernard in the scene that leads to his first epileptic fit, but he is never shown talking to the guys about anything. They all act quite cold to each other. They have little love of music; they think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Buzzcocks/dp/B00008BLCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Buzzcocks</a>&nbsp;are ""okay,"" but show no enthusiasm. Ian is shown offering his services as singer to the other guys as if he were a total stranger. One wonders why they accepted.

Look, just because the film has Joy Division in it doesn't mean that everyone involved has to be an icy death machine. Even Tony Wilson, that charismatic bon vivant and con man, is a gloomy Gus in this film. Watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24-Hour-Party-People/dp/B00007BK2N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24 Hour Party People</a>&nbsp;-- it is not pleasant viewing for a Joy Division fan, but it shows the sleazy, yet exciting and adventurous atmosphere surrounding the burgeoning Manchester scene. People knew there was something good in the air, and they were excited about it. That's why they spent their free time doing it. ""Control"" shows none of that. Producer&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Martin-Hannett/dp/B000EJ9KJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Martin Hannett</a>&nbsp;is never mentioned by name. Instead, the spotlight shines on manager Rob Gretton, who steals the show simply by swearing a lot.

Okay, fine, the film doesn't have to be about Joy Division. But it's not really about one man's anguish, either. The first half of the film gives the impression that the director's knowledge of dialogue and human interaction derives entirely from French New Wave&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/films/dp/B000BC8SWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">films</a>. Scene after scene consists primarily of ""smoking cigarettes with existential meaning,"" to the point where it is unintentionally comical.

For example, the film opens with Ian reciting a verse from ""Heart And Soul,"" and shows him purchasing an LP. But that's all it does to show his attraction to poetry and music. Why was he interested in these things? Okay, he didn't like to show his feelings, but every earnest young man, especially one with an introverted character, has numerous pedantic opinions on rock music, and greatly enjoys holding forth on them. The film shows Ian and Deborah attending the Sex Pistols concert, but they show no interest in the music. Ian gives no sign of excitement, except perhaps some slightly more animated head-nodding. In another scene, he flatly recites from Wordsworth, one of the least edgy poets in the English language. What's the big deal, why is he interested in Wordsworth? More importantly, why do his friends listen to him? Do they view him as an authority on intellectual matters?

The courtship between Deborah and Ian is so bizarre that it's funny. Deborah is shown to have a boyfriend; she pouts in front of Ian, who gives her no emotional cues. They both look very bored at the concert, when suddenly, they leap into each other's arms. Starting immediately, the boyfriend disappears and is never heard from again, and Ian proposes to Deborah in the very next scene. This also is peculiar. Ian, both in the film and in real life, seemed to have little taste for family life and fatherhood (""with children my time is so wastefully spent,"" he cruelly wrote). Yet here, he's the one who initiates every move. He proposes, and he also asks Deborah to have a baby. It is not unrealistic that a man might have an idealized view of marriage, and then become dissatisfied with the reality, but that's precisely the sort of thing you have to carefully explore if you're making a feature film.

But here? You honestly have to wonder why the man is depressed. In the early scenes, he's a dashing mop-top with a manly chin, who wins Deborah's heart without the slightest effort. There is some indication later that he is distraught by the diagnosis of epilepsy, but this quickly takes a backseat to the love triangle with Annik Honore, which Ian himself initiates of his own free will. The only logical conclusion would seem to be that Ian always had a self-absorbed death wish, and willfully ignored his slavishly devoted wife (traces of Emily Watson in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breaking-the-Waves/dp/6305899681/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breaking the Waves</a>""). Oh, and he also sang a few songs in the process.

Toward the end, Ian laments, ""I give them everything on stage and they want more."" He says that no one can understand how his performances affect him. The film gives no indication, prior to this line, that this is the case. Ian's performances just seem to be a mild distraction from his usual moping; a distraction that he engages in just so he can have something to do.

There are two possibilities. Either a) Anton Corbijn is a hack, or b) everything good about Ian Curtis had already been expressed in his music, and thus there is no point in a film about his short life. Either way, there is little reason to watch ""Control.""",1240185600,13,6667,5.894409937888199

3046284,3,B00104AYGU,"A biopic on the short and (I guess) somewhat tragic life of Joy Division vocalist Ian Curtis. Starting out as a pre-emo kid on the streets of Manchester up till his suicide at the age of 24, this tale shows how fame as a music star is just too much for some to handle, even when you're dealing with the smaller amounts.

I dunno though, watching this I kept thinking that this story isn't really all that interesting or filmworthy other than the fact that it's main subject died so young. Strangely the picture takes place mostly in the mid to late 70's but it's entirely shot in black & white and seemed like the wrong choice for it, no matter if it's a sad tale or not. And even though Sam Riley is the spitting image of the late Curtis, down to his appearance and stage presence (of which I had to go to YouTube to refresh my memory of who Joy Division was like in the first place), his life story seemed too trivial and predictable for me to really care. He and the band make it quickly, he has to deal with occasional epilepsy, he marries young and has an affair/love-triangle, and finally decides to check out of life. Pretty by the numbers really, and in the end you wonder if anyone today who doesn't hate the world while wearing black mascara and dark clothes really cares. Recommended to fans of JD/Curtis or English early New Wave music.

Anton Corbijn's compact, masterful study of The Joy Division and its lead singer's fall is moody in all the right ways, its black-and-white palette a fitting metaphor for the hero's bleak working-class origins, the harrowing depictions of Curtis's epilepsy, his attempts to manage it through hit-and-miss drug regimens and its devastating effect on his relationships and career.

So I wanted to like it more than I did.  But it's too long (doomed rock star biopics should never run more than 90 minutes) and it was hard for me at least to work up much sympathy for Curtis, who, as depicted here and aside from the medical issue of his epilepsy, created his own situation (he wanted to impulsively get married, he wanted to have a child) and then does not have the guts or the energy to either extricate himself from it or live with the consequences of his own actions and end his extramarital affair.  Instead he spends a lot of time crying and feeling sorry, mostly for himself.  I imagine there are lots of plumbers, stockbrokers, and farmers with exactly the same bad-decision trap as Curtis.  How they deal with it might have made for a better movie, but we have Control instead because Curtis happened also to be a goofy, awkward lead singer with a frequent good lyrical bent.",1226102400,4,1226,4.60091743119266

3046292,5,B00104AYGU,"Dutch photographer Anton Corbijn made ""Control"" about the man and the band that brought him to England: Ian Curtis of Joy Division, which carried on as New Order after Curtis' death in 1980. ""Control"" follows Curtis' life from 1973-1980, starting with his high school days in Macclesfield with future wife Debbie (Samantha Morton), through joining a band with Bernard Sumner (James Anthony Pearson) and Peter Hook (Joe Anderson) in 1976, to Joy Division's success -having added drummer Stephen Morris (Harry Treadaway). All the while,  Ian (Sam Riley) suffered increasingly from the crushing stress of the band and family, exacerbated by side effects from his medications for inadequately uncontrolled epilepsy. Anton Corbijn knew Curtis briefly, having photographed the band, so ""Control"" feels like a personal and heartfelt project.

The black-and-white photography, Sam Riley's resemblance to Ian Curtis, and the music are striking. The music is actually performed by the actors, whose instruments are plugged in and microphones turned on. Riley has limited experience as an actor; he is a singer, and a darned good one for Joy Division's post-punk sound. They sound good. The gig scenes are electric. ""Control"" is black-and-white, because the band's visual history is almost entirely black-and-white. It's beautiful. The film is longer than it needs to be but doesn't  feel prolonged. It spends time establishing Ian Curtis' ambition, talent, temperament, and then his deteriorating state of mind. Sam Riley's performance is surprisingly charismatic and sympathetic without ever being sentimental. Toby Kebbell provides some comic relief as manager Rob Gretton. ""Control"" is the story of a modern poet and one of the most memorable music-themed films I've seen.

The DVD (Weinstein 2008): ""The Making of Control"" (23 min) interviews the director about his inspiration and decisions, the cast about playing real people, and writer Matt Greenhalgh about his process. ""In Control: A Conversation with Anton Corbijn"" (13 min) discusses the director's relationship with the band, his view of Curtis, and casting the film. ""Extended Live Concert Performances from the Film"" (9 min) offers 3 performances. ""Music Videos"" are ""Transmission"" from 1979 (3 1/2 min), ""Atmosphere"" (4 min) from 1988, and a cover of ""Shadowplay"" (4 min) by The Killers from 2007.

There is, however, a lot of emotional subtley I think, and in the places where people claim that the movie ""drags on"", I think there is a virtue in being inexplicit about the character's struggle.  I agree that this struggle could have been cut shorter, but I think the way in which the events leading up to Ian's suicide ""drag on"" somehow echoes the very appeal of Joy Division's music.

So it's depressing - interesting and beautiful to watch, but it ends badly, of course. The film does justice to the onset of his epilepsy, betrayal of his young wife and baby, a love affair he can't resist, the band's new fame, ending in his suicide, all sensitively treated with taste and restraint. Anton Corbijn's photography is gorgeous and the acting is strong, but the script is minimalist to a fault. A standout is the part of Annik Honore, played by the lissome and limpid-eyed Alexandra Maria Lara. Corbijn overdoes the shots of her smiling up prettily at Curtis from the audience in concert scene after scene, but this movie makes it as clear as the docu how different she was from Curtis's everyday Macclesfield milieu. Alexandra Maria Lara also played Hitler's high-spirited secretary Traudl in the outstanding ""Downfall.""",1217980800,2,1232,5.014634146341463
3046297,4,B00104AYGU,"""Control"" is a biopic about Ian Curtis, the lead singer of the 1970's British rock band Joy Division, who killed himself in 1980 immediately before the group was to embark on its first American tour.  The movie chronicles Curtis' early days in Manchester, the formation and rise of the band, his unhappy marriage, his serial philandering, his uncontrollable epilepsy, and his lifelong battle with depression.

One might be tempted, looking at the bareboned detailing of his life, to ask if there is really anything new here.  And indeed, Curtis' story seems to follow a fairly standard arc for the lives of artists in general and rock musicians in particular (though there doesn`t seem to be a whole lot of illicit drug use going on in this case), and as such the movie doesn't show us much of anything we haven't already seen countless times before in similar works.  Yet, ""Control"" is so cool, understated and restrained in its handling of the material that it succeeds in drawing us into the lives of these characters in spite of the over-familiarity of the tale.  The conflicts are real and the emotions raw, particularly when dealing with Curtis' rocky relationship with his wife, Deborah, who loved Ian unconditionally but could never get him to reciprocate those feelings, partly because Ian had fallen in love with a Belgian fan he met while on tour.

In a beautifully controlled and thoughtful performance, Sam Riley poignantly captures the sadness that seems to lie ever present at the core of Curtis' being, while Samantha Morton conveys the almost desperate state of a woman too much in love to realize, until it is too late perhaps, that she isn`t receiving love in return (the Matt Greenhalgh screenplay is based largely on Deborah`s memoirs chronicling their time together).  Much of the anguish Curtis went through in his life served as source material for the lyrics to many of the group`s songs, a number of which are used to provide a running commentary throughout the film.  The movie also makes effective use of voiceover narration to try to figure out what is going on in that troubled head of his.

For his impressive directorial debut, photographer Anton Corbijn has wisely chosen to shoot his film in artful black-and-white, the better to capture the starkness of the scene and the state of his character's mind.  Joy Division purists may object to the fact that Corbijn has had the actors themselves perform the songs rather than dubbing in the originals, but they do a fine job overall in interpreting the pieces.

Whether Curtis, in the long run, had a harder life than many who don't wind up committing suicide is not for us to determine.  What the film does make clear, however, is that once he felt he was losing control over his life (symbolized by his constant and seemingly incurable epileptic seizures) and had pretty much made a mess of things as a husband, a father and a lover, his purpose for continuing in the struggle seemed to have disappeared.  What a sad conclusion to come to, especially when one is only twenty-three years old.

3046298,3,B00104AYGU,"This film is made in black and white which immediately fosters idea that it should be treated as an art movie.  It starts that was but half way thru it, it simply drags on.  I did not know much about ""Joy Division"" and Ian Curtis, until I started reading film and book reviews about him.  Surely, it is always intriguing for anyone to try to figure out what drives a person of 23 years to commit suicide, the way Ian did.  Born and raised in Manchester, with no education and not much to do, he marries young, has a baby on the impulse and starts career as a singer in a local band as a way to keep himself involved with the crowd and nurtures his musical talent.  He also likes to write poems so it seems natural, his attraction to the art.  Until one day, Ian discovers that he is epileptic.  His life is consisting of pills he needs to have around the clock in order to avoid the seizures that have devastating effect on his body and overall mental state.  Tours to promote his band's material, binge drinking, late hours inside crowded clubs, hords of fans and women are adding unexpected stress to his life.  Ian is unable and unwilling to tend to his wife and young child and is having mistress who is French, seemingly sophisticated and free as a person -- which is amazing to him.  He starts his affair with Annik Honore almost as a way to create a new freedom for himself only to learn too soon that it is impossible to have it all.  He is immature, more than he is a jerk and emotionally unstable to handle all the changes that happened to him too quickly in both his personal and professional life.  Ian is troubled and there is really no one that can help him with his problems.  Him committing suicide almost seems like the only available option to the complete chaos in his life.  He is just too much of a burden to his own self and people around him and with his epilepsy his future is bleak anyway...I think I would like to listen to his album - his voice seems to be unique.  I still need to hear his message from his lyrics.",1217289600,2,2042,4.267532467532468
3046299,3,B00104AYGU,"Biopics are usually very dull and drag their feet getting to the core of the story that matters rather than what the director uses to assume credibility or closeness to the source. This is not one of those movies because you never connect with Ian to feel like you have any connection at all, nor do you get a sense of chronology by music, lyrics, or anything else that made us drawn to the movie.

You watch a very beautiful picture show. At times unflattering to the 90 seconds we get of Sumner's dialogue, and in general, the actors seem a little peeved they are even in the movie, but honest to a fault since given the writer's apathetic take and connection to the subject, ""that is what it was like"" we are left to assume. There are many things missed and the band aspect could be substituted for just about any job, as the music and gigs are atmosphere and not plot with the emphasis on Ian only showing up to sing, and not pouring out emotions in to writing his lyrics. I am left wondering what was left out or what the writer was thinking some 20 years on leaving the cast and story to be told out of memories that were not so clear or maybe the director, an extremely talented photographer, was making a movie out of a romanticised notion going over at 24 frames per second shots he wished he could have taken at the time.

Simlarities to the Doors can be made, but here, Ian's life is not made glamorous. We do sort of miss the point though, you feel as shut out by him as his wife must have felt, and yet even some more token performances and chronology could have helped us fans put the songs in to perspective since if this was a movie about some steelworker, we would not have watched it. We watched this because it was about Ian, the lead singer of Joy Division, but yet I appreciate that it was not a music video with liner notes stitching his life together.",1217289600,3,1874,4.290960451977401

3046304,5,B00104AYGU,"Noted rock photographer and video maker Anton Corbijn, who had met the members of Joy Division on a couple of occasions in the late 1970s, makes his debut as a director of a feature film with his take on the life and death of Ian Curtis. (The script is based on the 1995 memoir from Debbie Curtis, Ian's wife.)

As to the film, ""Control"" (122 min.) is as good a rock bio-pic that I can remember, keeping in mind that this is meant to be a film about Ian Curtis, not about Joy Division as such. Ian's struggles with epilepsy, alcohol and medication abuse, and most of all his relationship with people, including his wife Debbie, his Belgian girlfriend Annik, the band members, and last but not least, himself. As the movie goes on, and Ian's moods turn darker, it becomes more difficult to watch, because you now how it all will end. The movie is appropriately shot in black and white. The acting is outstanding, none more so than Sam Riley as Ian Curtis. Special kudos als for the four actors playing the Joy Division songs. This is not a playback or dubbed: it's the actors themselves playing the music, and they did a great job at it. I thought that Anton Corbijn did an outstanding job as well in directing this film.

The DVD comes with a number of nice extras. In particular ""The Making of Control"" (23 min.) and ""A Conversation with Anton Corbijn"" (12 min.) are quite insightful. The ""Extended Live Performances From the Film"" segment is mislabeled, in the sense that it brings a mere 3 songs (Transmission, Candidate, and Leaders of Men), so it is not quite the ""extension"" it could have been. There are a couple of videos as well, most interesting the 1979 performance from a BBC show, which is fascinating (and underscores how well Sam Riley has ""caught"" Ian Curtis). In all, ""Control"" is a fantastic movie. It puzzles me why the movie failed to get any traction at the box office here in the US (it was released only in a couple of cities; I never had a chance to see it in the theatre here in Cincinnati). This DVD is a nice way to catch up. If you have a nice home theatre-style sound system, it will absolutely enhance your enjoyment of this film. ""Control"" is highly recommended!",1215129600,3,2193,4.493734335839599
3046305,4,B00104AYGU,"Control is the movie version of the book Touching from a Distance: Ian Curtis and Joy Division by Deborah Curtis.  Although the movie is a kinder portrayal of the life of Ian Curtis, it succeeds in showing him as a cruel and dark person.  One understands that it is from these depths that the innovation and art of the music of Joy Division comes from, yet this was no excuse for the way that he treated those who loved him.  In fact, Control is more a love story than a musical tribute to Joy Division.  The film contained the correct balance of dramatic and musical effect.  The starkness of the black and white filming helped add to this effect.  It is also useful that a lack of hero worship is given to Ian, unlike the life of many of his fallen musical sole mates.  This helps one admire the music of Joy Division for what it is rather than who created it.",1214784000,2,862,4.283950617283951

3046307,5,B00104AYGU,"Joy Division are a group that require little introduction to those familiar with the late-70's and 80's post-punk scene.  One of the most influential rock bands of all-time, it grew out of 4 guys from Manchester in love with punk bands such as the Buzzcocks and the Sex Pistols.  But rather than having a similar sound to those punk bands, Joy Division's sound was something entirely new, ushering the post-punk sound, one that combined the raw edge of punk but with gothic and dramatic tendencies.  This sound would prove influential to countless 80's bands and also more recent ones, most notably ""Interpol"" and ""Editors"".  The Joy Division story is a tragic one, as singer Ian Curtis committed suicide at the age of 23.  The remaining members then went on to form New Order, sell 20 million albums in the process and the rest is history.  ""Control"" is a semi-autobiographical look at Curtis' rapid rise to fame and equally fast descent into despair.

The story traces Curtis' life from the age of 16 and beyond.  A David Bowie worshipping, chain-smoking, distracted teenager, Curtis never quite fit in with the school crowd and used music and poetry as an outlet to his emotions.  He married while still in high school and had a child shortly thereafter, all of this before being in the band.  Then the story shows us how he met up with the other band members and their rapid rise to fame.  Throughout all this, Curtis worked a day job as an unemployment office counselor and had to tend care to his wife and newly-born daughter.  The struggle between being in the band and being on the road (which in itself was not quite enough to pay the bills) and his family responsibilities not to mention his epileptic condition proved to be too much for Curtis to bear and the movie concludes with him tragically putting an end to his life.

I found ""Control"" to be bar none of the best movie bio-pics ever.  The director's decision to make the movie in black and white is an absolutely brilliant one, as it accurately catches the essence of he band, whose artwork was always in black and white and also gives the picture the gritty feel it merits.  The best part of the movie of course is the breakout performance of Sam Riley as the title character, who nails Curtis to the point of eeriness.  The downcast looks, the hairstyle, the jittery movements on stage, everything is bang-on.  I read somewhere that the singer of New Order had to stop watching the film midway because Riley bore too much of a resemblance to Curtis that it was scary to him.  I can see why.  Another star in this movie is the music.  Joy Division's music is great of course, but the way the director selectively uses songs that fit the mood of what's currently unfolding on screen is remarkable.

If I were to have one issue with this film I would have to say that the reason for some of Curtis's emotions are never really explained.  Why exactly is he so depressed when he has so much to be proud of?  Why did he stop loving his wife so suddenly when she never stopped loving him?  Maybe Curtis proved to be so complex of a character that even he himself didn't really know who he truly was.  It should be noted that this DVD offers generous extras such as a commentary track, a 20mns making-of documentary, a director interview, still gallery, promotional materials, extended live performances from the film.  But the highlight would have to be the music videos, where we see the real Curtis performing on BBC and see just how much of a resemblance there is between him and the actor that portrays him.  Overall, ""Control"" is brilliant, essential stuff for both fans and also non-fans who just want to sit through a great drama.  Highly recommended!",1214697600,2,3721,4.613981762917933

I have just watched the DVD from Amazon, and while I don't think it was as good as seeing the movie in the movie theater 3 times, this is not to be missed for any reason.  The director saw Joy Division live and was able to incorporate the music into his aesthetic as a photographer and then movie director.  As we all know, part of Joy Division's lure is the incredible marriage with the image (and at times absence of image) of the music, and how the images came to speak to all of us fans as icons of the far-reaching sounds of this incredible, divine band.  The director makes a very formally-wise film, utilizing and loving up  the actor transformed into Ian.  Each scene is perfectly married into the story and the music.

3046311,4,B00104AYGU,"The 2007 film ""Control"" chronicles the life and brief musical career of Ian Curtis, Joy Division's doomed frontman. An epileptic whose stage performances mirrored his seizures, Curtis was also entangled in complicated personal relationships that he could not navigate successfully. His death on May 18, 1980, gave birth to yet another legend of the rock star who lived fast, died young, and left behind a good-looking corpse.

Anton Corbijn's film exposes that myth and reveals the human cost of Curtis' fatal choice. His young wife, Deborah, penned the book on which this film is based, and we first see Ian as a schoolboy in love with Bowie and all things rock and roll. He seduces Debbie away from a fellow student, proposes marriage, and sets up a home with her, all the while penning lyrics for the music career he strives to achieve.

The film's major strength is in these early scenes, when it's established that Ian and Debbie have a connection early on. Because that connection will be tested and ultimately betrayed when Curtis goes on the road and meets Annik Honore, the ""other woman"" of Ian's life.

The film also shows the visual appeal of the band, due to their stark fashion sense and energizing live performances. Sam Riley is more than just a lookalike for Curtis; he's a skilled interpretor of Curtis' stage mannerisms and voice. The bonus extended live performances on the DVD are awe-inspiring (one wishes that more than just three of the live performances had been included). But the film is more than just ""Joy Division: The Movie."" It tells the story of Ian's rapid decline even as he's on the brink of success. His condition forces pills and unnatural bedtimes for a rock star on him, and his life with Debbie becomes a series of brief moments between his return from a tour and her leaving for her job. The stark greys of the black-and-white cinematography reflect not just the accepted visual style of the band (as Corbijn states, the band was always thought of in black and white, due to the way they were photographed), but shows the bleakness of Curtis' worldview as he struggled with the demands of fame, fatherhood, marriage, and illness. By the end of the film, the audience is no longer sure that Curtis' death was pre-planned at the beginning of his fantasies to make it big (a charge that Debbie makes in her book). Instead, it seems like real life caught up to his romantic notions of early death and made it seem like he had no other choice.

The film is a great companion to Michael Winterbottom's ""24 Hour Party People,"" an altogether more cheerful affair which nonetheless had highlights in its section dealing with Joy Division. Corbijn's humor is not absent of humor, however, and there are moments which puncuate the grimness. If you know the story of Ian Curtis, you know how it turns out; but the moments that are amusing help to keep you interested in the film.

The movie is fair to both women in Curtis' life, and he isn't portrayed as the typical groupie-crazed rock star. Debbie grows to realize that Ian is going away from her, and she has lost him long before she finds him hanging in their kitchen. Annik is not a gold-digger but a caring, sympathetic fan, and their relationship is considerably less tawdry than it could have been portrayed. For all his faults, Ian in the film comes across as profoundly human, and unable in all his twenty-three years to come to terms with all that the world is laying on his doorstep.

I've been a huge Joy Division and New Order fan for ten years, and I always wondered if the story of Ian's life would ever get film treatment. Now it has, and the results are worth your time even if you're not a fan. As someone who lost a close friend to suicide last year, I know firsthand the grief that Curtis' friends and family must have felt in the aftermath of his death. This film goes a long way towards healing those wounds left over from a life cut far too short.",1214006400,,3951,4.637142857142857
3046312,3,B00104AYGU,"I'm a Big Joy Division fan going back to the early 80's. While I can appreciate director Anton Corbijn's personal tribute to JD's lead singer IAN CURTIS, the film is just too Dark and Excessively Slow to recommend to the average viewer.

Corbijn's stark B&W photography (He was a close friend to the original Band and held many a photo shoot with them..Their 1st two album covers were Black-then White. A third, Grey!) perfectly captures the atmosphere of dank Manchester, England in the 1970's. Sam Reilly is Amazing as Ian and mimics Ian's voice and performance mannerisms to-a-T. Samantha Morton (Minority Report, Woody Allen's Sweet & Lowdown, Elizabeth - The Golden Age) is heartbreakingly good as Ian's suffering wife. The actors playing JD band mates are noteworthy and seem to play their own instruments which certainly add to the realism. However, the film just plods on at a Snail's pace. Maybe this was the director's ploy, to depress us Slowly into Submission given the nature of Ian's illness and make us feel what Ian felt. Any solid JD fan knows that although their music could be Dark & Challenging, it was never Boring or Depressing. Although we're given very small glimpses into the creative psyche, recording and performance of the band, CONTROL is really the slight, personal story of Ian Curtis their lead singer. You'll rarely see much in the way of lengthy music clips here.

A better place to start is Grant Gee's new documentary JOY DIVISION just released by TWC as well. It paints a much broader picture of the Band and still maintains Ian's story as its main Focus. The music and performance clips of the Band are amazing and the Doc rarely drags. It features extensive interviews by remaining band members (nka NEW ORDER) and Control director Corbjin.",1213747200,6,1779,4.887417218543046

3046314,5,B00104AYGU,"If you're a fan of Joy Division, you've already seen 24 Hour Party People.  That movie was a funny biopic of Tony Wilson, founder of Factory Records - Joy Division's label.  The JD story was told there, and Ian Curtis's brief life was touched on.  Control is a serious, and much more thoughtful look at Ian's life and death.  This movie is based on the book ""Touching From a Distance"" (penned by his widow Deborah) and sticks closely to it both factually and thematically.  The Ian seen here isn't the legend he later became; here he is a figure of great talent  - and greater flaws.

Sam Riley, in his first lead role, portrays Ian with a mimicry that's almost creepy.  (Don't believe me? Watch his performance of the song Transmission, then watch the original Joy Division performance included in the extras.)  Kudos to him and the other actors for actually performing the Joy Division songs themselves, rather than lipsyncing.  They pull it off admirably.

As to the movie itself, it's shot beautifully in black and white.  This is Anton Corbijn's first feature-length film, and he did a great job with it.  While this certainly isn't a happy movie, it's well worth seeing - whether or not you're a fan of the band.  Beautiful images, good storytelling, and great performances - they're all here.

Sam Riley plays a convincing Ian Curtis, so that is a plus, but from there that is really it. So if that is it then why am I giving it a full four stars, well because he is really really good, and really the saving grace of the movie. The movie is based upon Deborah Curtis, Ian Curtis' wives memoirs of her teen age marriage to the lead singer of Joy Division upon until his 1980 suicide at the age of 23. The movie chronicles Ian's life from his mid teens through the birth of Joy Division and their albums Unknown Pleasures and Closer and ends with the his death. His epilepsy is featured here as the cause of his depression when really it was his meds. Also the movie makes it look like his marriage was most of the cause when once again the meds caused his personality change as well as marriage problems such as looking for the arms of another woman.

So while the film is based on an actual memoir it hardly follows it, and in fact for the most part is nothing like the memoirs twisting tales. But for a loose introduction and background on Ian Curtis this is a decent way to go.",1212796800,2,1100,4.208530805687204
3046316,4,B00104AYGU,"Ian Curtis, one of new wave's most prolific songwriters, died at the age of 23, unhappy and alone. Joy Division provided him with an outlet, but he couldn't be contained within the band. In fact, he felt alot of distance between the band and himself as if someone else were singing.

I an made a terrible mess out of his life-had kids and got married too early, had two mistresses, and hung himself in his wife's house because he felt like a total failure, which he was.

The film only gets 4 stars because I wanted more Joy Division music, more stage performances, and perhaps more videos of the original Joy Division(you only get three here). No mention of Warsaw, except for a performace of ""Leaders Of Men"", surely one of Warsaw's most superior songs, however, the title track is never sung at all. No ""Warsaw""? No star.

3046317,4,B00104AYGU,"This film is based on Deborah Curtis' biography and so this ""Ian Curtis"" is the Ian Curtis that she knew and Control in most respects adheres to her interpretation of his life. But it should be noted that Deborah Curtis knew but one side of Ian Curtis' story, her side. And like any other point of view that might have been chosen to tell this story, this one is limited & distorted. The writer of the screenplay is fully aware of the fact that Deborah's perspective is a limited one (as all of our perspectives are) and the screenplay makes some attempt (though not enough) to find the Ian that Deborah did not know, and that maybe no one knew. To achieve this screenwriter Matt Greenhalgh balances Deborah's own remembrance with the remembrance of other key figures in Ian's life (parents, band mates, Belgian girlfriend Annik) to give us a more rounded look at what it might have been like to be Ian Curtis. Unfortunately, these additional perspectives do not amount to as much as one would have liked them to as Ian was apparently not particularly close or open with parents or band mates. (The film rarely shows Ian interacting with either.) And the girlfriend just seems like a very pretty, very fresh, very young smiling face. Most likely the band has their own story to tell, as does the girlfriend Annik. To Deborah, Ian Curtis was a husband and so her story is one largely dominated by domestic squables. After the fourth or fifth round of domestic argument the film begins to feel like a film about marriage and not about music. The over-reliance on Deborah's perspective/biography begins to feel like a liability before the second hour of this two hour biopic begins, and the second hour is almost entirely devoted to the last moments of marital woe that, according to Deborah, sparked the final act. But there is so much more to this story than the one that Deborah has to tell. In addition to Ian the husband, there is Ian the singer and performer. And, most importantly to fans, there is the Ian Curtis that wrote some of the most austere and hypnotic and compelling rock music ever recorded. This is what is really missing form the film: a sense of where the music was coming from. Certainly some lyrics can be explained as autobiographical confessions of self-loathing and regret but some are comments and critiques on modern life.

To listeners of Joy Division's postpunk sound what was immediately alluring was that it sounded nothing like punk. Punk was manic and Joy Division was subdued. The sound was hollow but hypnotic and the voice was full of romantic longings and yearnings for some kind of transcendence but the romantic longing was always accompanied by the feeling that there was nothing to be done with these feelings. If punk was about irreverence and having a rebellious larf in the face of authority, Joy Division was about looking for something to revere and finding that modern life gave man very little to revere. In the face of utter hopelessness, the only grace to be found was in the music itself because the music offered trance-like beauties unavailable in real life (Unknown Pleasures). To fans, Ian & the band were the rarest of things, the expression of a genuinely original sensibility/musical vision. Unfortunately, this is the part of Ian's story that Deborah has the least access to--the writer Ian and the stage Ian is someone she barely knew--, and so it is simply not dealt with. We get no sense of what music meant to Ian nor what he was looking for in it, and without some kind of understanding of the music it is very difficult to understand Ian. Instead we get a story about a relationship and a cliched one at that. Sympathetic as we are with Deborah, rock wives rarely lead happy lives, and in biopics they almost always look like obstacles to their more talented husbands artistic urges & drives. Thats true here as well. And sad as the relationship between Ian and Deborah was it is simply one part of a larger story.

The other perspective on display here is the directors. As one might suspect from that very romantic film poster, director Anton Corbijn knows Ian as a photographic object. And, as a visual object itself, the film  is primarily a chance for Corbijn to display his own considerable gifts for grim yet starkly beautiful composition. From both the still  photographs that he took of the actual band circa 1980 (which should have been included in the DVD extra gallery) and from the film itself, one can understand that Corbijn felt a deep connection to Ian & Ian's unique romantic/existential sensibility and vision. As compelling and convincing as the film sometimes is, it is a work of art made by an artist that has his own ideas about what made Ian what he was and what made the music what it was. But, like all great artists, Ian was more than just the sum of his many influences (William Wordsworth, Lou Reed, Brain Eno, David Bowie, Roxy Music, Sex Pistols, Iggy Pop, Apocalypse Now, Werner Herzog...) and so no mere visual record of these influences and sources from which he drew will ever fully explain the artists own vision. Artists recognize greatness in others but the good ones always transcend their sources. Ian Curtis' true sources of inspiration are & will remain mysterious, no film can really know or show what Ian was or knew or what he felt when listening to a favorite song or reading a favorite book; no one can know what Ian was to Ian. Biopics are intriguing and frustrating because they are, at best, speculative. Though the film faithfully represents Deborah's version of things, the key moments in this life are ones that no one had any access to but Ian (how does anyone really know what he watched, or listened to, or thought in those last moments?). Faced with unknowability, it is our nature to be curious and to speculate but one should not mistake speculation for truth. As a result, the most valuable part of this DVD to those fans of Ian the artist and his formidable band mates (given short shrift in this film) will be the actual footage (not included in the actual film but included as a DVD extra along with Corbijn's 1988 video for Atmosphere and the Killers video for Shadowplay) of the real Joy Division playing Transmission.",1212796800,13,6247,4.697080291970803
3046318,5,B00104AYGU,"Anton Corbijn has probably lived up to the old adage ""A picture is worth a thousand words"" a million times over, having captured photos of too many acts to mention.  While he's done a number of music videos, he's more known for photography.  It's fitting then that his feature directorial debut seems to stand more of a collection of photos than one single film.  But don't worry, that's to the film's credit.

The main attraction of Corbijn's direction is a stark attention to detail.  As a photographer, there's one shot that has to speak volumes to viewers.  Corbijn takes advantage of numerous shots to get in Ian Curtis's head.  In one of the opening shots, a young Curtis, played brilliantly by Sam Riley, is seen sitting on his bead.  While we hear David Bowie blaring in the background, Corbijn gives us a look around, gazing at Curtis's book collection and pictures and posters of such iconic rock stars as Lou Reed.

As to the story, it's a very familiar one to Joy Division's fans.  So familiar, that it's already appeared on film, albeit more briefly, in the brilliant comedic 24 Hour Party People.  The film's appeal will be the attention put on Curtis as opposed to Joy Division as a whole.  This is where the movie takes on a life of its own.  Corbijn attends to such details as Curtis's lowly job in an unemployment office and continuous interactions with Curtis's wife, Deborah.  Corbijn's gift as a photographer pours over on these scenes as he takes time with each scene, allowing the viewer to really absorb not only the immediacy of what is seen on each scene, but the internal emotion that is felt as well.  This is the power of Corbijn at work.

None of camera's magic would work, however, if it weren't for the brilliant performances and the intentionally spare script.  The cast is led by Sam Riley, who has the uneasy task of stepping into Ian Curtis' shoes.  He gets it all down to Ian's hypnotic performances on stage.  Samantha Morton also packs a punch as the distraught performer's wife.

The script is fairly direct and familiar. The pictures speak for themselves.  There are no long monologues or quick witted lines of texts in the film.  A lot of the drama is delivered by the camera.  Corbijn, a man known for minimalism, is powerful as director in creating a portrait of one of the most iconic figures of the post punk scene.  While Corbijn's photos often allow us to spend a moment with someone through his use of minimalism and candid photography, Control feels like we just spent our lives with Ian Curtis.",1212537600,2,2545,4.654708520179372
3046319,5,B00104AYGU,"Thankfully, a film about Joy Division and the continuing myth of its frontman, Ian Curtis, landed in the right hands.  Only someone close to the band could have pulled off this masterful film, encapsulating not only Ian Curtis but the entire feel of a miserable place like late 70's Manchester, England.

At the opening whirling, eerie sound of Exercise One, I was hooked for a lifetime.  Sadly, Joy Division was the basis of too many ""goth"" bands that followed who never seemed to understand their punk roots.  This movie, I hope and pray, will cast a dark light onto that presumption and dispel it once and for all.  Joy Division were a tough band in a tough time.

Anton Corbijn made a solid choice to shoot this film in black and white.  Joy Division were a black and white band.  Stark, bleak, beautiful; beyond or beneath the confusion of color.  Marrying too soon, becoming too big and finding himself profoundly overwhelmed, Ian Curtis understood more about failed relationships and the futility of existence by 23 than most people will know in a lifetime.  He lived a black and white life.  Hope vs. despondency.

In retrospect, the album Closer was one he could never survive.  That album is a blueprint for a funeral.  Yet never wallowing in self-pity, he crafted painfully honest lyrics that drive into the heart of depression.  Upon seeing this film, years after reading the book Touching From A Distance, it became even clearer that his suicide was a viable option for him.  His depression was severe, a US tour was the next day, his guilt about being a poor father and his two tenuous relationships were all approaching the boiling point.  As in all suicides, the pain of continuing on eclipsed the fear of the dying.  What was he to do?  Quit and go back to working at the employment office?  No.  That was a fate worse than death.

Like the book, Control does a good job of portraying Ian Curtis not wholly as a victim of his diseases.  He was not the nicest guy yet you find yourself empathetic of his ordeals.  Where having a child will often transform a father, the birth of his child sent him further into despair.  For that, he could not forgive himself.  He was not merely ashamed of his behavior but, as he wrote in the song Isolation - ""I'm ashamed of the person I am.""  The grave was already shoveled; it was only a matter of time before he stepped in.

I would recommend knowing and enjoying the music of Joy Division before seeing the film.  It is a great film but (possibly?) one that is best taken in context.  As a fan, it's fascinating to see their rise from nothing into massive.  And the toll it took on everyone.  It was a long wait for a great film about Ian Curtis and Joy Division and I can soundly declare, I'm glad I lived long enough to see it.",1212537600,3,2785,4.508
3046320,5,B00104AYGU,"Ever since Ian Curtis, lead singer of the British band Joy Division, died in 1980, he has achieved the iconic status of an emerging artist showing signs of brilliance before meeting an early, tragic end. In Curtis' case, he committed suicide on the eve of his band's first American tour. His brief life has already been depicted on film in Michael Winterbottom's fast `n' loose look at the Manchester music scene of the 1970s and 1980s,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24-Hour-Party-People/dp/B00007BK2N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24 Hour Party People</a>, but it was only for the first half of that film.

He not only directed the video for their song, ""Atmosphere,"" but also shot some of the most memorable photographs of the band, making him the ideal choice to helm this film.

There is an audio commentary by director Anton Corbijn. With his thick accent, he's a little hard to follow at times but manages to cover the usual topics: casting choices, shooting on location, and so on. He praises the performances of Sam Riley and Samantha Morton while also pointing out technical details, like how the concert scenes where shot with hand-held cameras and everything else was done with steadicams. This track is a little on the dull side but Corbijn does impart interesting factoids and it was clearly a labour of love for him.

""The Making of Control"" takes a look at how the film came together. Corbijn moved to England because of Joy Division and took iconic photos of the band. So, he had an emotional connection to the material. His black and white photos influenced his decision to shoot the film in a similar style. The actors who played the members of Joy Division talk about the challenge of playing people who are still alive, learning to play musical instruments, and the songs. This is an excellent featurette filled with loads of interesting information.

""In Control: A Conversation with Anton Corbijn"" tends to repeat some of the information from the commentary track and the making of featurette. The director talks about how he discovered Joy Division's music and how he eventually met them. He touches upon how they shot in Ian's hometown for authenticity.

""Extended Live Concert Performances from the Film"" allows you to see ""Transmission"", ""Leaders of Men"", and ""Candidate"" in their entirety.

In a nice touch, there are the videos for ""Transmission,"" a powerful rendition done for live TV with a riveting performance by Ian, Corbijn's video for ""Atmosphere"" that is haunting as it was done after Ian's death, and The Killers' cover of ""Shadowplay"" which is surprisingly effective.

Also included is a ""Still Gallery"" with photographs from the film.

Finally, there are ""Promotional Materials,"" trailers for the film, a blurb for Deborah's book about Ian, the soundtrack, and so on.",1212364800,41,3202,5.495934959349594

3280580,5,B00104AYGU,"A lot of great films came out last year, 2007--No Country for Old Men, There Will Be Blood, The Lives of Others, and so on--but I honestly can't think of a better one than this: ""Control.""

This is a gorgeous and skillfully done film--all awash in silvery starkness, in luminous black and white--and all feeling so genuine and so far from anything fake or phony.  I am not the suicidal singer of a New Wave band, I am not in love with a French journalist, and I do not think I married too early, but watching this, the movie really put me inside the man's skin.

""Control"" tells the story of Ian Curtis, Joy Division's ill-fated lead singer--as well as his unfortunate wife, his band, his manager, his label, and his lover--and it does so without resorting to making it a slick biopic or a phony depiction of celebrity.  It is one of the realest feeling films I have ever seen, and yet it doesn't sacrifice anything compelling or filmic to be so.  The story plows ahead with amazing music and a formidable drive, with scenes that are artfully shot and gorgeous to behold.

The film's final scenes are indelible, cut forever into my mind, and the feeling the film invokes is powerful.  I have never felt more genuinely punk than after seeing this--leaving the theater, I wanted to rip benches out of the ground and attack speeding cars head-on.  More than that, I wanted to walk back into the theater, get another ticket, and watch it again.  (I'm not really that into Joy Division either--at least I wasn't before seeing this.)

""Control"": Best Movie of 2007.  And Best Music Movie in Decades.  So well-made and flawlessly executed that it couldn't ultimately depress me--it could only excite me.  It's amazing.",1206835200,46,1711,4.663333333333333
3280581,4,B00104AYGU,"It's a long time since Ian Curtis's solemn laments of thwarted love have hit my turntable. And in spite of the longevity of Joy Division's successor, New Order, I confess that the demise of Curtis, an authentic Rock tragic, singled the demise of my interest in their music. What explanation is there for an attraction to talent extinguished prematurely; the titillation of having glimpsed, sometimes stared at some gift that was squandered? In many instances, and Curtis's is among them, early, meteoric talent most likely was fufilled...fatalism was written into it, the biography and art in perfect tandem. Their music already sounded as if it was rising from the grave, a severly cold other place. That's what the popular press has continued to feed us over the ensuing decades. In this sense Corbijn's film is no exception. You buy the Q magazines or NME, whatever, for some fresh insight to such legends. But there isn't any. The film's script has been anticipated in the music; alienation of the inner, poetic self from the cramped and dour quotidian life of cramped, urban, Macclesfield. The band's public image, as per Corbijn's recreation has been honorably projected, mesmerizingly so by Sam Riley...the entire slow surge of its black and white cinematography inexorably, hauntingly moving toward the last gasp in that sad little kitchen. The acting is so convincing that you often feel it's a documentary rather than an interpretation. There is no sensationalism to be found in Curtis's life or death. For all its Doors-like anthemic sound, Curtis was no aspirant Jim Morrison.",1203811200,,1588,5.111538461538461
3280582,5,B00104AYGU,"This movie was spectalular.  I was very impressed by the actor's portrayal of Curtis.  He was phenomenal.  Every Joy Division fan should see this movie.  If you ask a lot of people if they have ever heard of this band you will get a lot of no, who, never heard of 'em.  But Joy Division continues to inspire performers of many different genres.  Its amazing how many people love songs like Shadowplay from The Killers or Dead Souls from NIN (The Crow soundtrack), but have no idea that these are Joy Division songs.  The old saying, the good die young, no matter how cliche, continues to ring true.",1202169600,2,598,4.481481481481482
3280583,5,B00104AYGU,"I became a Joy Division fan long after the fact. I was a New Order fan after hearing Temptation and then rushing out to buy Blue Monday after seeing them perform it on TOTP for the first time. My friend Mooncat introduced me to 'both bands'.

25 years later - we are viewing rock history as interpreted by people who are closer to what actually happened at the time.

This is a beautiful film. Yes - Curtis is legend, as are the rest of the band. This film (and yes - I have read the book) gives a good portrayal of what it is to be to be working class English, with ambition and with flaws. All of the performances are powerful - Sam Riley does a good job (though I felt he looked more like Stephen Morris), and the actor playing Rob Gretton is fantastic. Comedic relief while at the same time giving the sense that he had some control over the band. Kudos by the way for learning to play your instuments for the roles and reform for a long overdue Joy Division concert at Cochella !!!

My criteria for a movie is - does it move me ? At the end of the film I was almost in tears. My wife was. I am sentimental towards Joy Division and ""Atmosphere"" is the perfect song to induce this feeling. Was it just the song - no. The movie is perfectly cast, directed and should win bucketloads of awards but it probably won't due to lack of distribution.

If you have any desire to watch a music biography - this is the film. If you care to enquire about post punk - this is the film. Beautifully written, shot and performed. A must for my DVD collection.",1201046400,4,1546,4.177852348993288
3280584,4,B00104AYGU,"Ian Curtis wasn't you're typical rock star.  Instead of sex, drugs, and rock and roll, you get epilepsy, broken marriage, and performance anxiety.  Control, though a well made movie that avoids many pitfalls of a typical musical biopic, doesn't really get to the bottom of who Curtis really was, which might just be an impossible task.

Sam Riley plays Curtis, the lead singer of the legendary band Joy Division.  I'm probably not spoiling anything by saying that he killed himself, making himself in to a legendary rock figure.  The main story centers on Curtis's struggles with his ill advised marriage at a young age, his severe epilepsy, and his affair with a Dutch woman named Annik.  Riley obviously studied Curtis's mannerisms, as his awkward but strangely charismatic stage presence and his voice really stand out.  He sings all of his own parts, and he does a respectable job.  Curtis was not a great singer, but he did have a very distinctive voice, something that Riley emulates well.

Watching Control, you get the sense of just how gloomy Joy Division's music really was.  I've listened to Unknown Pleasures and Closer many times, but seeing the inspiration for Curtis's pitch black lyrics played out in a dreary Manchester makes them appear more palpable.  You could argue that there is some mythologizing going on, but it doesn't beat you over the head like Walk the Line does.  Instead, it lets the viewer put together the pieces for the most part.  A good example is when Curtis see's a girl have an epileptic seizure when he's working at the unemployment office.  For those who have followed Joy Division closely, you this is the inspiration for She's Lost Control.  You'd have to know the lyrics of She's Lost Control to know that it's about a girl with epilepsy.  There are some times though where the filmmakers hold your hand, like when they show his book collection, filled with depressing books by JG Ballard and William S. Burroughs, or when he talks about going to see Apocalypse Now.  Even then, it still relies mostly on subtext to get the message across about Curtis's influences.

One major problem I have with most musical biopics is that they rarely show anything about the creative process.  There is a bit in Control, like the scene where they are recording the drum tracks for She's Lost Control.  Apparently they got the odd hissing sound using a spray can.  I was hoping for a more prominent role for Martin Hannett, the notoriously controlling producer of both Joy Division albums.  By all accounts Hannett had a large influence on Joy Division's sound, but he's only shown for about 5 minutes.  And how did they decide that the bass would take lead and the guitar would be used as a background device?  Was it because Peter Hook was the best musician in the band, or was it some other reason?  Of course, I'm a music nerd, so these things might not interest anyone outside of me and a few other dedicated weirdo's.

Control is a cut above most biopics.  Riley does a wonderful job as Curtis, and it offers a fairly unsparing look at his life.  Curtis still remains a mystery though, and will probably stay that way forever.  That's part of the appeal of his music; you can listen to it over and over and still not know what was in the creators mind.",1200528000,7,3288,4.699300699300699
3280585,4,B00104AYGU,"Corbijn's talents as a photographer and music video director lend themselves perfectly to this biography, as it's stark cinematography and haunting music certainly overshadow it's lackluster script. Fortunately, Riley's breakthrough performance and Kebbell's bombast more than compensate for the film's few (but noticeable) lapses in narrative. (8/10)",1198800000,,351,6.48936170212766
3280586,4,B00104AYGU,"A biopic of Joy Division's lead singer, Ian Curtis? Who besides a handful of people like me, (in 1980 we had their posters on our bedroom wall and sketched what Joy Divison's third album cover might have looked like),  and the only other patron at the matinee theatrical showing that I viewed could possibly care? Indeed, why should I want to see actors performing a suicidal swan dive when all the sadness of Curtis' death lies imbedded in the gloomy, psyche-rich and beautiful music Joy Division left behind?

Because now Ian Curtis is really dead. Anton Corbijn's film, ""Control"" brings closure to the first time I heard Joy Division, raced to a record store, and was no sooner through a second listen when I heard the lead singer had committed suicide. I've been in denial ever since, and the sketchy details of Curtis' death, the same sketchy details offered in the film, suddenly ring true to me.

Filmed in the British working class black and white, like the Beatles' ""A Hard Day's Night"", with tones of muted and spacious greys, like The Who's ""Quadrophenia"", the film brings vitality to the bleak Manchester neighborhoods that were the haunts of the band. It has that wide screen black and white ordinariness that film geeks love. Very common images of modest Brit apartments, cheap recording studios and seedy clubs, are given an immaculate shine by the variable b&w cinematography which conjure not only the do-it-yourself Manchester music scene, but Joy Division's own bleak and surviving psyche. And the head bobbing teens digging the band in the clubs look like the honest to god post punks of yesterday.

You'd thing that was genuine Joy Division during the musical performances, but it is the actors uncannily recreating the music with Sam Riley as Curtis, not only looking the part while delivering a 'let's-let's not' demeanor, but sounding like a dead-on Ian Curtis, with all the brooding deep voiced restraint Curtis possessed. In a subtle performance in which the camera finds him, as opposed to a mugging for the camera, Riley as Curtis, (just another English bloke holding a day job), gives reason to believe in the seemingly petty causes of Curtis' self-destruction. He simply didn't want to live anymore, (""I give them everything 'on stage' and they want more""), and the overload of prescription drugs to combat epilepsy surely complicated matters. Samantha Morton as wife Deborah Curtis, (whose autobiography the film is based), is extraordinary as the plain and sexy love struck young woman who stands like a pillar against Curtis' doomed horizon. The big scene is taken like an arrow through the heart, even as you know it is the only destination the film aims.

My one and only gripe is the movie's insistance to incorporate Joy Division music at times of marital strife, which seemed a lessening of the music's depth.

But now Ian Curtis is really, really dead. He had sung his last song. Finito. Out of here. Love tore him apart.",1197072000,34,2960,4.91
3280587,3,B00104AYGU,"In 1979 a young Dutch Photographer called Anton Corbijn heard an album called `Unknown Pleasures'. Within days he had left Holland and headed for England intent on locating the makers of the record. He found them in Macclesfield and, with a series of monochromatic images, began to forge their legend.

 A scant eighteen months later the group were considered one of the most important bands of the post punk era. On the eve of the release of their second album, their biggest hit single and an American Tour, their lead singer hung himself in his kitchen. The first rock and roll suicide - he was twenty three.

 Corbijn went on to have an amazing career in which his photography and video promos resulted in much of modern rock's iconography via his work with U2, Depeche Mode, The Rolling Stones and many others, and now, finally, he has come a full circle with his directorial film debut telling the story of the band which brought him to England in the first place.

 The band was Joy Division. The film is Control.

 Control is the biopic of Joy Division's lead singer; the charismatic but deeply troubled Ian Curtis. Joy Division had emerged from the fallout of the late 70's punk explosion. Taking the inert nihilism of that new sound and instilling it with an intellectualism far removed from the cheap shock tactics which sold it to teenagers everywhere, Joy Division, with the visionary brilliance of producer Martin Hannett, developed an oeuvre of dystopian soundscapes which continues to serve as a ground zero for new music to this day.

Based on the book `Touching From a Distance' by Curtis' widow Deborah and starring newcomer Sam Riley in the lead role, Control does as much to dismantle the Curtis cult as it does to propagate it. The sleek futurism and Ballardian preoccupations of the music are in stark contrast to the kitchen sink dour-ocity from which it emerged. Control is a rock and roll `L Shaped Room' or `Look Back In Anger' with an epileptic Jimmy Porter dumping his trumpet for a Vox Phantom guitar. Terrifying evocations of Curtis' jerking, trance-fixated on-stage persona, juxtaposed with his day job at the local job centre or making cups of tea in the mannered surroundings of his small council house is as far removed from our perception of Curtis the uber-prophet of urban ennui as can be imagined. Think Bowie trying to set the video recorder or Lou Reed doing the washing up.

 The musical sequences deftly convey the chaos and excitement of the band's live appearances thanks to Riley's convincing portrayal of Curtis but Tony Kebbell as Rob Gretton, whose introduction and pronunciation of himself as the band's new manager, is the highlight of a film which may be too drama-heavy for fans and, perhaps, too long for everyone else. Nevertheless, Control is a crash-course in the banality behind the bombast and the dissection of a myth. Tony Wilson, owner of Joy Division's record label Factory is often quoted as saying ""if it comes to printing the truth or the legend, always print the legend"". With Control, Anton Corbijn has managed a collision of both.

3280588,5,B00104AYGU,"I've now seen this story played out 3 times, twice at the movies in the last 2 days and once as a 15 year old from the North of England where the film is set. In the true spirit of the ""Kitchen Sink"" genre, it begins like a modern day ""A kind of loving"" and has a touch of "" Room at the top"" (the wedding car scene). Sam Riley plays Ian Curtis Lead singer of Joy Division, a band who influenced so many groups in the UK and internationally. Riley is outstanding, portraying Curtis in a way that does not show him as the icon he became posthumously but as a somewhat immature 20+ year old man. This of course is countered by a soundtrack that reminds us of his musical genius played by the actors in a very authentic ""Garagey way"". A portrait of a man torn between his old and new life complicated by the onset of an illness he was struggling to come to terms with.

If that wasn't enough the photography is glorious, every other shot could be hung on the wall, it never looked so good when I was a young! I understand that Corbijn was trying to shoot the film like a sequence of music videos and with his massive experience as a still photographer it all works beautifully. He sank a large amount of his own money into this project, and you can tell that making it was important to him as a fan and aquaintance of the band You can see his passion and committment to the film throughout. The sequence in the kitchen towards the end of the film was electric, an incredibly haunting dramatic shot. This movie demands the biggest screen that you can find.

I read a review that said you don't watch this movie you live it, the first time I saw Control I was angry at the futility of it all, the second I wept tears for lost youth, his and mine. My advice ? Go to a really big Movie screen and take a box of tissues and enjoy what must be considered the best music movie of all time. There's no getting away from the end, like Ian Curtis's all too short life it comes too soon in this movie, but enjoy the majesty of the photgraphy, the stunning performances, revel in the darkness and enjoy the music.

Casting did an impressive job of choosing actors who resemble the people they're portraying in real life, and the acting is good. The camera work is charming and the choice to film in black & white interesting. But I feel like they focused on capturing some of the simple aesthetics to the detriment of telling a serious story. In my opinion the story is shallow. It reduces Curtis to some kind of mysterious misunderstood poet, instead of a complex, intelligent, angry human being. It portrays his marriage to Debbie and relationship with Annik as the likely causes of his suicide, asserting that his relationship with Annik was romantic when she maintained it was platonic until her dying day. I felt this really did Curtis, the rest of the band, and their art a huge disservice. There is no meaningful exploration of their political, social, or economic contexts, growing up in post-industrial, post-WWII Manchester. There is no meaningful discussion of the Nazi imagery and history they incorporated into their music and art, which was irresponsible of the filmmakers. That deserved serious consideration and discussion. Viewers won't even learn the origins of their name from this film, understand they were anti-fascist, or even why they chose those symbols.

Overall, this was an entertaining and moving story but it was far too individualistic, lacking in context, and oversimplified for my taste. I would have appreciated more exploration of Curtis' childhood and work as employment advocate for adults with disabilities. But, again, taken as a fictional story, it's really very good.

Like his wife, Debbie, who stares at him, mouth agape, on the television, we realize that something exceptional is before us.  I'm not even a fan of this music, but the actor playing Curtis is absolutely magnetic.

3280610,5,B00104AYGU,"This was surprisingly moving. I had occasionally wondered what had happened to Joy Division, and this film told me the story. Ian Curtis, as played by the very talented Sam Riley, was too smart for the situation he was born into, but he managed to turn his talent into writing thought-provoking and outr lyrics for the songs Joy Division put together. Curtis was too young to have gotten married, but he was overly sensitive and craved love and closeness. The terror Ian felt from his epilepsy condition overwhelmed him and presented him with no option but lifelong medication with heavy, debilitating drugs. Curtis was likely a difficult man to work with and know, but if the film was in any way accurate, he had to have been mesmerizing when he was on stage.",1482710400,,760,4.7218045112781954

Samantha Morton as Curtis' suffering wife inhabits the role beautifully, as usual for Morton.  The script is tight, dialogue crisp and natural, directing unnoticeable - thank God.

3280630,4,B00104AYGU,"As a teenager, he is aware of his brooding, moodiness, but he has a profound interest and love for poetry, prose, music, and a newfound exuberance for a sweet, loving girl named Debbie (Samantha Morton). Once married and a father, now suddenly battling epilepsy, and a burgeoning rock-star status, Ian Curtis (Sam Riley) meets up with the ultimate spoilers-- despair and darkness.  And this is the story, adeptly told by Matt Greenhalgh, and directed and astutely captured on film by Anton Corbijnin. Curtis is brilliantly played by Sam Riley.  Much of the screenplay is informed by Samantha Morton's biography.  As the lead singer for Joy Division, good-looking and sexy, more than a little awkward and self-conscious with most, Curtis is a magnet for women, actually for hoards of fans in the late 70s. Pile on top of that, the reciprocated fixation of a gorgeous Belgian groupie Annik (Alexandra Lara), and you might just end up with a man who wants out. Skilled, dramatic, and measured black and white photography effectively fleshes out the sad tale of a really brilliant (his songwriting so good) clinically depressed, charismatic (almost against his will) reluctant star. His impassioned singing and marching, waving arms, an odd dance that highlights both his weakness and his strength, electrifies the crowds. What happens next remains to be seen. Samantha Morton is stellar as Debbie. This is an accurate depiction of this musician, and is skillfully filmed and written, but even from a more universal perspective, it shines a constant light on the downside of success.

Obviously this is about both of these topics.  I wish I understood what they see, or how their minds work.

That said, the movie was terrific.  Ian Curtis was very well portrayed by Sam Riley who was simply superb.  If you get a chance, I'd recommend reading 'History of Rock 'n' Roll in Ten Songs by Greil Marcus.  He uses as one of his ten songs Transmission by Joy Division.

3280649,4,B00104AYGU,"Stark and powerful. Some liberties taken likely: a young and doomed Ian Curtis idolozes a young and doomed Jim Morrison. As a young civil servant, he witnesses a young woman wearing a rugby cap suffer a gran mal seizure right in front of him: obtuse foreshadowing of the fate which will befall him. Too blunt? So what.

A new-built concrete apartment block accomplishes two goals: it shows the bleak urban boredom that inspired ugly UK portraits like Trainspotting or A Clockwork Orange while housing the restless, rebellious Curtis, a product of a rebuilt, stoic, angry Britain that arose from the ashes of WWII desolation. He's ready to channel that anger with a number of references to the war, Nazis, and some barely contained bitterness and sarcasm.

And you'd think he was a savvy urbanite with a privileged upbringing and world-citizen-like experience but no, you see quite clearly that he's torn between small town sensibility and desire to raise a family and wanting to make original art. That was a small surprise... You hear about Black Sabbath and Def Leppard and whoever coming up in the shadows of steel mills in places like Sheffield and Birmingham, but you don't figure the polished, cool, semi-gothic Joy Division would be from a backwater.

The real surprise though: just how insanely good the music is (especially the original performances made in the film). How desperately Curtis gets into the music, like it's contorting him, or, well, giving him fits. How vastly different Joy Division's style is compared to the punk they were replacing. Sex Pistols: angry. The Clash: fashionistas. The Buzzcocks: bridging a gap between brashness and cool. Joy Division: completely raw, inventive, emotion-evoking, autobiographical. Definitely a bit of hipster to them (watch for Curtis's overcoat early in his adult life in Macclesfield--it shocks and makes you crack a smile whether or not you're familiar with the era) but otherwise plain, middle-class, in your face, directness. I like to think Fugazi took many cues from this band, as both preferred to avoid costume, invent sounds, reject convention, and bellow cathartic mantras. Well Ok, clearly Curtis liked a little press-up now and again, but see if the spare style doesn't impress you as original.

Anyway, if you wondered what drew people to listen to a little known post punk band and hold it in higher regard than even luminaries like New Order (as I do--both are great, but Joy Division remains like a... Like a really deep and dark Velvet Underground), the performances here paint a picture of a band that rightly awed people. When the crowd reacts to Ian's manic gestures, see if you don't feel some of that surge too.

What's left out? Well, I'm not a historian of theirs, but I imagine Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook get short shrift. Wooden. Inconsequential. There's no explanation as to why they seem to dislike him and resent his illness and social and self destructive behavior. Though on the whole that's ok... It's not about them. when he wonders aloud why everyone hates him, you feel that rejection and you see the hated too.

And it does another fine thing... It captures the almost Shakespearean tragedy. He feels he's doomed, as if the illness and medication have robbed him off his youth. He's heartbroken that he has worn out a marriage that he entered into very early on (the wedding scene is like the end of The Graduate) and ruined with abandon. And that he has barely a friend and seemingly no future. The final scene, of his cremation and a short statement about his death, is as bleak as any I've seen. And you're thankful the whole thing was in black and white at that point. It's haunting.

See this if you ever had the least bit of interest in the man or the band. You won't forget it.",1474243200,,3784,4.857364341085272

As a biopic, the movie captured a few key moments in Curtis' life, but did little to capture the pain and artistry that contributed to those seminal albums and singles.

3280662,4,B00104AYGU,"It is kind of a mixed feeling when I watched this movie.
Ian is a singer who becomes a famous one.
First, the death of the singer Ian, I quite didn't understand fullheartedly the reason why.
He had a wife with a daughter but he falls in love with this woman whom no man can refuse because she is so beautiful.
Then he cannot get rid of his wife because she is such a nice woman and of course they and a baby and all.
Finally he decides to hang his neck in his house where there is his wife and his little daugher.
So then again, why he had to die? Isn't there any substitution at all?
I know that love is important but he can just choose between his wife and the girl.
He is in his peak and about to go to the Us for the tour. He is nothing but to become more famous.
His songs are always moody and sad somehow although they are rock. I get that. But there is no behind story of his that supports the reason of his behavior-death.
He has this disease that makes him keep having pills and whenever he doesn't have pills, he faints.
But is that something to do with suicide? I don't know.
The director must have thought more about his matters before making the roll of Ian I guess.
I am not saying though that this movie is a failure. It is still a well made one.
The singing parts and all. They are very good.
But the ending seems all left questionmark. Now that's something troubled for me.

Existence-well what does it matter
I exist on the best terms I can
The past is now part of my future
The present is well out of hand

The above lyrics of Ian Curtis (the sadly departed Joy Division vocalist) are a narrative in the song Heart and Soul, and these potent words are key to the world of a celebrated singer who took his own life.
Curtis was a tortured character who was physically crippled by epilepsy and mentally torn between the love of two women (one of whom was both his wife and mother to his baby daughter). He was also an artist who wanted to create music but did not seem interested in the cut throat world of fame and fortune. As his band was on the cusp of commercial kudos and an American adventure the pressure became too much for a man who has become an icon.
On May 18, 1980 a suicide at his terraced home in Macclesfield closed a dramatic passage of time that is depicted in Control, the debut Anton Corbijn directed feature film. This story of dreams and despair via the channels of love and lust is a major movie as the Curtis saga is transferred to the big screen with aplomb; and, the pages of the Touching from a Distance text (that was penned by his spouse Deborah) are animated.
The celluloid skills of a black and white shot movie come in many forms with the performances of Sam Riley (Ian) and Samantha Morton (Deborah) capturing the era and emotions of a true tale. To add to which the music that ices the action is precious with the tunes of Iggy Pop, David Bowie, The Velvet Underground and Kraftwerk aiding the proceedings. The genial gems of Joy Division in either their original format or regally reworked by the actors who take up the mantle of the band are also at the core of this phenomenal film.
There are also Unknown Pleasures in amongst the darkness and Joy Division manager Rob Gretton (who has also since passed away) provides several smiles e.g. When he tells Curtis that things could be worse as he could be the lead singer of The Fall! However, expect intensity as the chapters unravel but do not avoid Control, as this is a pristine product.",1459814400,,2149,4.432911392405063

Some creative licenses were employed in order to give the viewer a better understanding of the major events and some people's perception of reality, though no distinction is provided where reality and perception break (eg claims that Ian's relationship was platonic by Annik vs. Deborah's view of it being an affair).

I am a particular fan of the creative licence taken at the end, where it seems that all the possible factor's leading to Ian's suicide seem to collide in the end. It does a good job of conveying that no one really know the reason Ian took his own life.

In a way I would not have been opposed to say a 3 hour film. I felt there were sections that easily could have been extended, not complaining tho.

Numerous times I could feel myself going into the JOY DIVISION ZONE watching this film. I mean that in how the members of this band all claimed to feel a very strong sense of unison with each other, in sync, real magic. Powerful song writing! Timeless! I am certain to always be a huge fan of this band. Any time I hear anything by this band I most certainly feel in sync with this creation!

Ian Curtis, you are deeply missed.

No doubt what so ever.....BUY THIS FILM!",1428451200,,711,4.2835820895522385
3280692,4,B00104AYGU,"This film is beautifully shot and the story is well told.

I found it hard to separate the telling of this story - the film itself - from the story that was told. I was aware of the music and history of Joy Division - where they came from, the challenges of that time/place, Ian Curtis' epilepsy and the suicide. I had always thought that Ian Curtis must have been a depressed and difficult guy - but sensitive and overwhelmed. This film - and again it is a film - not a diary or documentary - showed me a completely different perspective on Ian Curtis' life.

There is the cultural narrative of the ""tortured genius"". I would describe this film's Ian Curtis as the ""torturing genius"". He steals his best friend's girlfriend by lying to her, pressures her to get married, then says he wants to have a baby with her. Meanwhile, she is supportive and loving, friendly to his bandmates...and just gets left in the dust. Ian Curtis does whatever he wants - including starting an affair with a sub par journalist - while his wife is at home with his baby. The band closes ranks around him, so his wife doesn't know a thing - even while his mistress goes on tour with them. Ouch ! The note that Ian composes for his first suicide attempt - left in the home he shares with his wife - to be found by her instructs her to ""Give my love to Annik"" (mistress). Whoa. Despite this. his wife calls an ambulance and he is saved. The film highlights many episodes where he treated his wife terribly in the most casual of ways. He is never shown physically assaulting her - but he is emotionally abusive and controlling. The context where the song ""She's Lost Control"" is written in becomes a spiteful victory song.

The film highlights many aspects of his behaviour that are very egocentric. It seems that the only time that Ian Curtis feels any anguish or concern is when it affects him directly. This lack of empathy is common in people with personality disorders, particularly narcissism. Ian's suicide, prior to the US tour for increasingly successful Joy Division, seems to be a result of his worsening epilepsy and growing performance anxiety. However - the film doesn't show Ian Curtis seeking a second medical opinion regarding treatment options for example.

It is difficult for me to separate the music and image I had of Ian Curtis prior to watching this film -from the apparent jerk who he apparently was. The film is beautiful, but the story(story or history ?) is difficult. Sometimes our heros are better left unknown.",1427241600,,2517,4.599109131403118

3280696,1,B00104AYGU,"This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. It has no redeeming moments at all. I guess the only thing I could say is that the actor manages to do a very good job acting depressed.

Hey, I'm a musician myself and I have a broad tolerance for all kinds of music, but this band sucks, even when viewed in the place and time of post punk. I went and listened to the original recordings and sure enough, the mumbled tuneless vocals and dreary lyrics showed no hidden talent. There wasn't even the raw energy of the other punk bands of the era. You certainly don't feel that this is some kind of band ready to break out and set the world on fire, and they didn't.

So the guy cheats on his wife and screws his life up with guilt, not really much of a story there. As a portrait of depression, yes, it does that very well. But to drag it on for two hours is just plain torture.

And I had to turn on captioning just to figure out what they were saying.",1421798400,,949,4.037234042553192

3280701,5,B00104AYGU,"Biopics- especially ones about famous musicians who died tragically- have a tendency to give a rose-tinted glasses perspective on their subjects, glossing over the bad in favor of worshiping their hero. They tend to ignore the damage these hard-living, troubled individuals caused to the ones they love.

With a musician like Ian Curtis, who died especially tragically, it would be easy to fall into that trap.

But thankfully, this film avoids that.  In fact, it specifically emphasizes the damage Ian caused to his wife and family up to and including his suicide.

It doesn't paint his death as an act of salvation, or as an escape from his suffering.

No, instead it ends on his wife in pain, showing the real selfishness of his suicide.

It paints Ian as more than just this mysterious rock idol.  It shows him as human,  Deeply flawed, genuinely brilliant, but human.",1418342400,,872,4.884353741496598

3280711,4,B00104AYGU,"The music of Joy Division was informed by glam and punk and anticipated the grunge and industrial sound that came later.  Wisely filming the film in black-and-white director Anton Corbijn creates an atmosphere that mirrors the moodiness of its main character, singer Ian Curtis(Sam Riley). It's the same moodiness that portends the doom of Curtis that looms large throughout the picture like a train wreck you're unable to stop.  Aside from being a terrific rock film ""Control"" is also a great character piece painting a full bodied profile of Curtis showing the coexisting demons and angels that made him a great artist which were also his ultimate fate.  Sam Riley is nothing short of mesmerizing as Curtis avoiding the rock star clich that are the undoing of a lot of biopics.  I wasn't into Joy Division, or New Order for that matter, at the time but my wife was and she had an enthusiastic reaction to the film.",1406764800,,916,4.7784810126582276

3280714,5,B00104AYGU,"My husband kept turning to me and asking, ""Wait, is this a true story?""  You get sucked in instantly by Sam Riley and Samantha Morton.  Besides being a compelling tale, it's a great film with great performances.  You feel like you are actually there as a fly on the wall with the band.  The supporting cast are all amazing and memorable.  It's incredible, to me at least, that Sam Riley hasn't had more starring roles and was notoriously rejected by both LAMDA and RADA.  Riley really sinks into his characters.  His northern boy looks could have been used to portray Ian McCulloch with just a change of hair.  (amiright?)

What's even more amazing is that the kids playing the band actually learned their instruments so they would look like they knew what they were doing onstage but ended up playing live for the soundtrack in the concerts staged in the film.  Sam Riley's voice is incredible.  I know I blaspheme when I say that they sound better than Joy Division.  The music perfectly fits the film, capturing the mood.

There are multiple levels to the film with a few in jokes referring to other films about the time (24 Hour Party People), though all of Riley's scenes as Mark E Smith were cut.  And what you don't know is that Riley married his co-star who played Annik, Alexandra Maria Lara.  There was real chemistry there.

The cinematography in this is excellent.  Every single shot is beautifully composed.  If you are a fan of Anton Corbijn's rock icon photography, then you will certainly want to see this.  He was the photographer for many of the bands in the Nu Wave/post-punk British scene from Joy Division to Depeche Mode and Echo and the Bunnymen.

That being said, there are some problems with changing from music and feeling written down to a visual medium.  Curtis comes across as bit of a jerk and not nearly as magnetic as he must have been.  IN a film, scenes have to tell a tighter story than in reality.  It makes more sense when Corbijn reveals that about an hour's worth of scenes were cut.  (Can we please have a director's cut???)  Another issue is that 35 years on Annik revealed that the ""affair"" with Ian was never consummated.  This is totally believable because he was on heavy barbiturates that would have made it impossible.  But as a movie, don't let actually reality get in the way.  This is the closest representation you will get in film.

As a New Order fan in 1980s Los Angeles, getting to know Joy Division was easy because they were on KROQ's playlist.  We loved New Order to distraction, it wasn't a dance party without them.  Certainly Joy Division would have been as popular as New Order had Ian still been around.  So when we heard New Order used to be Joy Division, we loved that music too.  Love Will Tear Us Apart was on all the video shows, so we saw Bernard and Hooky with a different singer and it was like, whoa.

The commentary track with Anton Corbijn delivers a wealth of information and the extra concert footage is really cool.  And now it's only 8 bucks.  I rented from Netflix.  I'm thinking I just might buy it.",1403308800,,3079,4.542805100182149

I expected a good film based on reviews, but Control surpassed my expectations and that rarely happens anymore.  That is, more films disappoint than surprise in terms of quality.
The movie feels like a documentary.  Sam Riley's portrayal of Ian Curtis is uncanny.  The tone of the movie captures the feel of the times just as I remember it.  And it also has the air of something remembered that is hard for me to explain here.  The acting is uniformly excellent, with the actors fully inhabiting their roles and never falling into caricature.  One of the most interesting things about the movie is how the director, Anton Corbijn, maintains the proper degree of tension for each character's story, subtly shifting perspective to make each person whole, and sympathetic.
This is a great movie, regardless of the viewer's knowledge of Joy Division.  For those unfamiliar with their work, this film is likely to lead them to the music.

Sam Riley is mezmerizing as the doomed Ian Curtis who suffered terribly from epilepsy and committed suicide May 18, 1980 at age 23.

3280727,5,B00104AYGU,"Didn't think I was going to like this, but being a casual fan of Joy Division knew the film was worth a look see.  Wonderfully cast all round, but the standouts are the actors who play Ian and his wife, Deborah Curtis:  Sam Riley and Samantha Morton, respectively.  Sam Riley's practically a dead ringer especially when filmed at a distance for the Joy Division's lead singer - in stature, body frame and facial structure, all except his tell tale brown eyes.  For the record, Ian Curtis' most striking feature was his almost transparent, otherworldly eyes.

Anyone who knows the story of Joy Division is aware that this tale does not have a happy ending.  Don't have to spell it out.  The trajectory is doomed from the start so, of course, this in effect bogs down the whole enterprise.  That said, the script, based on the book by Deborah Curtis, rings strikingly true to life, and in fact feels like cinema verite at its finest.  Sam Riley does his own singing and is nothing less than remarkable in his evocation.  And, as suspected, all band members played their own instruments too.  In fact, there is nothing more phony than musical biopics with actors miming to a dubbed soundtrack.  So, by way of legitimate performance, the film becomes stunningly on point.

Can't imagine that any fan of the band Joy Division would want to pass this up.  The only negative thing I can offer is that the heavy accents made it hard to decipher the dialogue at times.  Also, the depiction of Ian's ""jump off,"" Annik Honore, rings rather superficial.  And she doesn't come off as a sympathetic character, being she broke up a family with a baby via the affair that she continues to deny.  Clearly, the story's told through Deborah's eyes.  Even still, the film, directed by Ian Curtis' friend and accomplished photographer, Anton Corbijn (who took iconic early photos of the band), makes a wonderful tribute to the memory of Ian Curtis and the band Joy Division.",1375920000,,1953,4.727810650887574

Tony Wilson's wife at the time (Lindsay Reade) also contributed to this biopic in her book.

Curtis, an epileptic with major depressive disorder, was the singer, lyricist and leader of Manchester, England band Joy Division.  Ian Curtis committed suicide the night before he was supposed to leave for the band's first major American tour.  He left behind a distraught girlfriend, an estranged wife (and a 2 yr old daughter), disappointed band mates (who went on to form New Order) and a devastated Tony Wilson (the head of the bands' label, Factory Records).

Anton Corbijn established a relationship with Ian Curtis as Joy Division's band photographer.  Corbijn also directed Atmosphere, a Joy Division music video released in 1988.  Friendly with Ian, this is Corbijn's gift to Curtis, Deborah, their daughter, the bandmates, Tony Wilson, the Legacy of Joy Division.

This biopic was shown at the Cannes Film Festival to rave reviews, and it won a few European film awards.

The acting is superb, especially Sam Riley as Ian Curtis, the tormented lead singer of Joy Division. Riley bears an uncanny resemblance to Curtis during the performance scenes. Truly uncanny. I don't think we ever get any real idea what drove Curtis to make the decisions he did -- perhaps we're not supposed to know or never can know.

The entire film is in black and white--this compliments Joy Division's imagery, and it enhances the tone of the film.

It's one of the best biopics I've seen. Even if you don't listen to Joy Division or like their music, I think that you'll find something to appreciate about this film.

The music comes in at all the right moments, and it adds to the atmosphere and the plot.

3280744,5,B00104AYGU,"I expected much less than what was produced from this project. But I'm very impressed with everybody's contribution. I was conveyed to the past, and experienced that lifestyle again.
We were of the same age group and had a band ourselves, we listened to J-D and admired them.  I am a lifelong artist and have never tolerated the repetition of musical cliches, just like J-D.
Much of the movie was unbearable to watch, because of how Ian Curtis made the one bad choice I avoided: he married his highschool girlfriend at 18, became a father immediately, then discovered how his own personal development was stifled by his marriage obligations.
Of course, I also knew how the story would end, and had to watch his life unravel.
The music and poetry of Joy Division are phenomenal, and it was marvelous to see and hear the band perform, marvelous portrayals, writing and direction!

3280745,5,B00104AYGU,"Before watching this film, it struck me how many ways they could get this film wrong - pandering to his wife (who co-wrote the script), unconvincing acting and, perhaps the greatest potential error: pretentious directing.

The good news is that the film avoided all of these pitfalls and was actually way better than I expected (for such an acclaimed film). Although not a ray of sunshine, the acting was convincing and the plot wasn't too focused around the bleak side of Ian Curtis. In my opinion, it seemed in keeping with Stephen Morris' description of Curtis being ""an ordinary bloke just like you or me, liked a bit of a laugh, a bit of a joke.""

And as for the story being biased in favour of his wife, the story seemed fair when it came to Annik Honore (Curtis' alleged mistress), portraying her as more of a friend, rather than any sort of bad influence.

Of course, if you don't like bleak films or biopics about troubled rock singers, then this isn't for you.

However, if you want to see a fairly balanced and well-researched treatment of the story of Ian Curtis, which shows him as a 3 dimensional, fairly normal guy, then this is about the best you'll get.

It's also worth mentioning that I'm not really a fan of Joy Division and have only really ever heard 1 or 2 of their songs. If you're concerned that this film is an inpenetrable geeky fan portrayal then don't worry - it's not.",1324944000,2,1398,4.509881422924901
3280746,4,B00104AYGU,"An awesome film from start to finish, it is primarily a biography of Ian Curtis and charts his marriage to Deborah, his love affair with another woman, his involvement in the band and his struggle with epilepsy and depression. It also covers the rise of the band itself: although this is not the central thread, this aspect is quite well covered. Given the subject material and well known denouement, it's not easy watching but I was deeply moved by Sam Riley and Samantha Morton's outstanding performances as Ian and Deborah. The monochrome filming adds to the sense of place and time and I can't imagine that it would have worked in colour.

The music lifts the mood. Apparently the actors played all the music sets themselves and Riley seems to have Curtis' style, mannerisms and delivery down perfectly. Joe Anderson (Hook), James Anthony Pearson (Sumner) and Harry Treadaway (Morris) are seriously convincing. Indeed, this is where I believe that the film scores highly over the documentary ""Joy Division"" which included only a few abbreviated exerpts of the band's performances. It's ironic that fans should have to turn to a dramatisation for a good portfolio of JD music. Three full performances (by the actors) are also provided on the DVD as extras - Transmission, Leaders of Men and Candidate - and Corbijns (rather odd) video for the song Atmosphere is also included.

All that said, I can't really see this as a film for general viewing - the subject is too esoteric and (let's face it) grim - but if you're a fan of the band or of the music of that era you can't afford not to own this.

Biopics can often feel forced, created less by vision than inevitability. The cast of ""Control"" have chemistry; there is a cool smoothness to these short-spoken people, and which permeates the film. But nothing really special emerges.

The upshot is, I was never sucked into the movie to a depth where I no longer noticed its Hollywood machinery, hear the producer saying, ""time for a sex scene,"" ""time for a time jump."" I just didn't care. Some will dig it. I did not.

Maybe it's me. It's not a bad movie. Just not *great,* perhaps not enough for most people without a strong connection to punk/post-punk. Although with a little patience, I could well see this slow-moving film may serve as a meditative backdrop for some good old pondering about the human condition, fame, fear, and the banality that forms the undercurrent of most of our lives.

Control won 25 awards, including three at Cannes, and was nominated for two BAFTA awards in the UK. The film is yet to receive a Blu-ray release in the US, but has been released in Germany and Canada. This review covers the Canadian version, which is locked to Region A.

The film made just under $8 million worldwide owing to the dark subject matter and the fact that Joy Division's music still isn't widely known. That's a shame because Corbijn (The American) has made a wonderful film.

This is the story of Ian Curtis who was the lead singer for Joy Division until his suicide in 1980. He died on May 18, so it was 31 years ago today at the time of writing.

I wanted to see the film because Joy Division is still one of my Top 5 bands 30 years later. I know who made me the tape so that I could hear debut album Unknown Pleasures for the first time and I remember who I was with and where I was when the news leaked that Curtis was dead.

It wasn't easy to find a theater which was showing the film when it was released so I ended up hunting down an obscure run-down cinema in downtown Toronto to even see it. About six other people showed up. Every single one appeared deeply moved and on the verge of tears after the film. I'm happy to finally own it on Blu-ray.

The main problem I have with this review is that I went in loving the band and knowing most of the story. Did it work for me because of that, or is it truly a great story that will appeal to people who know nothing about Curtis or Joy Division? It partly depends on whether you like the dark, brooding music, but it works for some people who don't like the band at all.

The film is bleak. It appears in black and white and is set in a northern town in England (Macclesfield). The houses are small, the streets are narrow and it rains often. This is all true. It's a depressing part of the country. The dreary setting matches the atmosphere of the music and the band's tale. The film shows how the band came into existence and their early successes such as recording, getting a recording contract and appearing on TV, but this isn't a true biopic.

Although I knew the lyrics and understood what the words meant before I saw the film, I didn't know the origin of those lyrics. The film ties together some of the events in the life of Curtis with the origin of the songs. When you see what She's Lost Control is really about, it adds new layers of meaning. If you think Love Will Tear Us Apart sounds like a pop song, it takes on a more sinister tone when you understand why he wrote it.

The actors rehearsed together to get the songs right so that they could play them in the film rather than miming. Corbijn never intended to include real performances of the music, but the ""band"" convinced him. The first time I heard the first note of the first song played in the film, I felt a huge surge of emotion.

Sam Riley manages to look very similar to Curtis and must have spent a long time studying the few examples of Curtis performing the songs. He mimics the actions perfectly and sounds like him too. It was almost like stepping back in time and experiencing a Joy Division concert. Samantha Morton gives a strong performance, managing to look like a young girl and then his wife and the mother of his child.

There's a lot of truth in this film too. Deborah Curtis (his wife) wrote the book Touching From A Distance which tells what really happened. The screenplay was adapted from that book and the details are as true as possible. Corbijn shot some of the iconic photographs of Curtis and the band while working as a photographer for the New Musical Express in England. This was a labor of love.

The result is a moving drama detailing the final few years of Curtis' life. It doesn't hold much back, showing his faults as well as his redeeming qualities. It's the story of a young man (23 when he died) who was in a situation he couldn't control. Loving and hating two different women, a parent at a young age, success at a level that was hard to imagine and all the while dealing with epilepsy. His character says in the film that the audience didn't realize how much he gave during a performance, or how draining it was and how painful to access the emotions to perform those songs. To the audience, they were songs. To Curtis, they were hideous parts of his life.

I found the film incredibly moving, haunting, captivating, happy and sad. I'm glad that Curtis will be introduced to new audiences through this film. Joy Division is important to me and Control is one of the most prized Blu-rays in my collection.

Video Quality 4.5/5
The film was shot in color and transferred to black and white and the images suit the mood of the film perfectly. Detail is sharp throughout and the print is clean and natural in appearance. I have also seen the German release and the presentation is similar. It's hard to imagine the film looking any better.

Audio Quality 5/5
The sound is the best I have ever heard where music is concerned. It's as good as listening to a CD on high quality equipment. The songs have a lot of depth and range and it's easy to pick out individual instruments. The dialogue is also clear.

Joy Division's music isn't for everyone, but this is an interesting look at the life of Ian Curtis whether you are a fan or not. The presentation from Alliance is superb and I would recommend it to anyone capable of viewing Region A material. The actors do a wonderful job and the music sounds authentic. It will send shivers down your spine.

3280752,5,B00104AYGU,"This has been one of my favorite movies since it came out. I love Sam Riley as Ian and, of course, the music is great  :) The black & white works really well. One thing I like a lot about this movie is the way that character's moods & thoughts are not always explicitly stated or spelled out to the viewer, making the movie far more subtle and interesting. Overall, well done!",1296604800,,376,4.222222222222222
3280753,5,B00104AYGU,"The movie captures the mood of the late 70's Callahan and Thatcher Britain superbly and gives as detailed a rationale for Ian Curtis' suicide as you will ever receive, acknowledging that this ""history"" is written strongy from the perspective of his wife, but then again, who really ever knew him better than her ? I wish that more filming was made in the authentic surroundings of Macclesfield, or even Manchester, rather than Nottingham, but that, and what seemed to me to be the excessive beautification of Annik, (she was far more Siouxsie than a 1980 ""Anne Hathaway"" in real life)are ""nits"". Riley's resemblance to Curtis is remarkable in so many ways. I find myself watching youtube footage of the movie and the band and truly blending one with the other in my mind.",1295740800,,771,4.804511278195489
3280754,4,B00104AYGU,"Ian Curtis is the lead singer of Joy Division, a group which is anything but joyful.  I always enjoyed the song, Love Will Tear Us Apart, even though other songs don't really reach me and move me very much.  This movie is the story of Ian's short life before he committed suicide.  For me, who knew little about the person or the group, I found the story at the beginning confusing and wasn't hooked on the music and the supposed greatness of it.  None of the characters appear that likable though after awhile I grew a bit interested in the story and the filmmaking.  In the end, I liked the movie enough to give it 4 stars but didn't feel any attachment with the group or Ian Curtis.  Samantha Morton is most welcome as a familiar face in a sea of strangers.  She plays Ian's wife who finds his body.",1294617600,,802,4.306666666666667
3280755,4,B00104AYGU,"I haven't watched a lot of biopics about doomed rock musicians but I did have some expectations about the tone: loud, showy, melodramatic, maudlin. I was much surprised by this movie's tone. This was a film about a BRITISH doomed artist, a NORTHERN ENGLISH artist at that, and, apparently, in the seventies, the good old way British way of feeling and expressing was not yet dead. Poor Ian Curtis largely suffered in silence, as did the people he hurt. When his wife Debbie barks at him over her discovery of his mistress, the effect is jarring. No one else really raises their voice afterwards until Ian's final tirade near the end. This stoic incidentally is a working class bloke who is polite to his teacher, helpful to clients at work (when he entered the employment office first time I thought he was looking for work; no, he worked there). He moves in a world where the F bomb is dropped constantly but doesn't swear much himself. He lives in a world where it takes a few moments for a viewer to notice that the film is in black-and-white. He kills himself in large part over guilt over having an affair; who does that in these degenerate times? And whoever heard of another rocker doing it? (I'm sure rock history buffs will know someone; I don't.)

Sam Riley is good as Curtis, though he conveyed pain better when he was suffering in silence than when he was begging for help. Samantha Morton played the put-upon wife as if she had never been anyone else much less played anyone else. As the mistress, Alexandra Maria Lara was irresistible, a fact that made Curtis's agony complete. Toby Kebbell gave the film a small dose of comic relief.

I liked the music too which was a surprise since I disliked the only CD I've heard from that era.",1288915200,,1747,4.560509554140127
3280756,4,B00104AYGU,"This is quite a beautiful film, very much in
the tradition of English cinema of the 60's - with
understated and nuanced performances all 'round.
Bleak and disquieting, the film takes you on a very
harrowing journey.
One not to be missed.",1286323200,,237,4.666666666666667
3280757,5,B00104AYGU,"As much as I enjoy this great movie, each time I watch it I can't help but think how startled Ian Curtis would probably have been to know that it would be his legacy to be remembered as the tragic figure Control (and to a much lesser extent 24 Hour Party People) made him out to be, instead of the social rebel he thought he was. The actual Curtis swore and drank, had temper fits, could be temperamental and difficult to friend and loved-one alike, and was known for his loud, scathing diatribes, including a famous one in which he blasted David Bowie for living to age thirty, despite the tone of Bowie's 1970s ode to dying young, ""All The Young Dudes"". In contrast the Ian Curtis of Control was a suffering martyr figure with a quiet, Keats-like delicacy that gave him a wispy quality that really doesn't gel with what we know of the flesh and blood man.

Having said all that, Control is still one of the most watchable films that's ever been made about the rock and roll scene. It is a both a labor of love and an artistic remembrance of a place and time and those who lived there. The story it tells can be either criticized as a subjective exercise in idealism, or praised for its close connection to those participants in and around Joy Division (Tony Wilson, Deborah and Natalie Curtis, the guys from New Order) who remained alive at the time of filming. One member of the band went on record as saying that the events depicted in Control were not much like they were in reality, but added that in telling Curtis' story, Control improved things, making the story more dramatic and approachable.

No commentary on this film would be complete without mentioning both the brilliance of its soundtrack and the meticulous reenactments of its concert scenes. Many of the locations from Curtis' life and death were actually used in the making of Control, adding an unmistakable punch to the plot. Finally, the fine acting on the part of virtually everyone who appeared onscreen was a delight to see, with Samantha Morton and Sam Riley turning out emotional performances that deserved Oscar recognition: something an outside film like Control would never get in Hollywood.

Like Ian Curtis himself, Control isn't perfect but it's still darn interesting.",1282176000,,2254,4.70126582278481
3280758,4,B00104AYGU,"Beautifully realized art film about a wasted life. Stunningly photographed, brilliantly written and acted, however, unfortunately about someone not worthy of having had a film made about him. So selfish, so self centered, as though he was the only one whose life mattered, devastating the wife who loved him, betraying his band, his manager whose dialogue in the film is totally outstanding. From its first frame it's a visual feast in black and white, each angle like a painting and therefore I enjoyed watching it, but since I wasn't familiar with Ian Curtis' bio, I was disappointed that I wasted my time seeing a film about a waste of a human being and my Brazilian wife was even more pissed than I. Yet, one cannot but applaud the purely genius filmmaking, a treat to anyone who loves cinema as an art form.",1280966400,,812,4.725352112676056
3280759,5,B00104AYGU,"If you are expecting another run-of-the-mill biopic about a drug-addled rock star and are thinking that you don't really need to see another one of those, I urge you to throw your inhibitions to the wind and snatch up this superb film, for it is far from run-of-the-mill.  In fact, `Control' may be the best biopic of this nature I've seen in quite some time.

The film tells the story of Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis.  At a very young age (and I mean VERY young) Ian found himself married, fronting a rock back, thrust into fatherhood and rising to superstardom.  While all of those things are what dreams are made of, when you add to the mix harrowing epileptic seizures and medications with undesirable side effects you find your protagonist beyond depressed and unable to cope with the strains of each individual responsibility.  A mistress on the road certainly doesn't help any (especially when your wife finds out).  Yes, `Control' is about a tortured musician, but not in the vein of most films in this genre.  This man's torment was even more poignant because of his inability to rise above it.

It's hard to believe that a lot of what makes this film so great comes from newcomers to the game.  Everything about this film feels so mature, so authentic.  It baffles me that this is Anton Corbijn's debut film.  Nothing about this film says `amateur' at all.

The decision to shoot the film in black and white was genius, adding crisp layers of style and flair.  The way he frames each actor, each scene, each musical experience feels straight out of a magazine, yet it never feels like he's intentionally `glamming' up anything.  This film retains its raw appeal without losing an ounce of finesse.

The screenplay, written by Matt Greenhalgh, is a stunning piece of work.  What I found so moving about it was that it highlighted Curtis's youth with subtle flourishes, exposing the faults within his own impatience that helped propel him to his doom.  Notice the way he does everything pertinent to his life is with a nonchalance and rashness that almost spells failure before it progresses.  The way he proposes, the way he suggests a child; it's done without any real thought given, showing his immaturity.  And yet, when his world begins to spiral out of control we are given a more intimate look at very mature emotions.  The way that Corbijn allows his actors (namely Sam Riley) to express what is racing through their minds, with prolonged shots of distilled faces and silent afflictions, is just magnificently real and unquestionably stirring to the soul.

I also really loved the use of music here.  A lot of times with a musician's biopic, the music can fall to one of two extremes; either it feels like an afterthought, used because it has to be, or it feels too influential, giving the events in the musician's life a veneer of manufactured realities.  Here, the music feels like a real part of the film.  It doesn't drive the film, which is key, but it illuminates the emotions and is used as a catalyst for great character development.

And that brings me to the performances found within this brilliant biopic.

Alexandra Maria Lara is beautiful (and I mean B-E-A-UTIFUL) and she can act too, delivering a simple and subtle look at a woman falling in love with a man she can't have completely.  Toby Kebbell is also strikingly good as Joy Division's manager.  His smooth swagger is key to developing a character with polished arrogance.  Samantha Morton (one of the best actresses working today, no exceptions) is flawless here.  I love what she was able to do with a very clich&eacute;d character (suffering spouse).  It's not like there is a lot of originality within the character (it is what it is) but she brings so much heartfelt emotion to her every scene.  Hearing her utter those heartbreaking words, ""I don't deserve this"", literally made me shiver.  What Sam Riley does with the scene afterwards is astonishing.  Yes, the way he completely melts down before the camera without once betraying honest emotion for forced theatrics is stunning.  Sam Riley is a god here.  Nothing against the likes of Jamie Foxx and Joaquin Phoenix who came before him, but they can't even compare to the raw earnest realism that Riley pulled out of this character.  Forget that apparent mimicry found in the Oscar loved performances, Riley captures a soul as apposed to a mannerism.  He lives and breathes this performance, and it shows in his unwavering from character.

In the end I highly recommend this film.  It is far more than one would expect it to be, for it focuses on a man who is not far removed from the youth of today.  He wanted it all, and he thought he could handle it, but at the ripe old age of 23 it proved too heavy for his fragile shoulders.",1280361600,,4781,4.712048192771085
3280760,3,B00104AYGU,"This movie, based on Deborah Curtis' book Touching from a Distance, is a little lopsided...and I guess it should be. Obviously Mrs. Curtis' life was torn apart by Ian's isolation due to his affair, mental state, medical condition, and suicide. So you get the sense that this is Ian's story being told by a jilted lover. I do not mean that to be harsh. Deborah should have been angry. But it would have been nice to see more of the creation of the band and the conversations Ian had with his band mates, friends, family, etc...

I can recommend this as a Joy Division/Ian Curtis/New Order fan but I would have preferred the whole story and not just one side of it.

Check out the Joy Division doc that is available as well. I liked that a lot more.",1271635200,,747,4.366906474820144
3280761,4,B00104AYGU,"You know the story. Ian Curtis, lead singer/songwriter for Joy Division, tragically ends his young life just as one of the most influential post-punk UK bands from the late 70's begins their climb to fame.

This movie begged to be filmed in black and white, and thankfully Anton Corbijn had the good sense to do it. The cinematography, score (if you want to call it a ""score"" - it is mainly songs by other artists, such as Bowie, Lou Reed, and Kraftwerk, that influenced Curtis), and casting are all top notch. Sam Riley is uncanny as Ian Curtis, and Samantha Morton as Debbie Curtis and Alexandra Maria Lara as Annik Honore probably could not have been cast better either. Tony Kebbel is a kick to watch as Rob Gretton.

As long is one is aware the movie focuses primarily on Curtis's relationship with his wife and his affair with Annik Honore, all is well. And there is enough musical footage thrown in to satisfy most Joy Division fans, which, I might add, is as about as realistic as one could ever expect from a movie. There are however, two or three parts of the film of which I must be critical. The first is technical in nature but to me is huge. There is a scene in the studio when the engineer is taping ""Isolation"" - Ian is laying down the vocal track to the already existing band tracks. Why in God's name, after putting so much effort into getting Riley to sound like Curtis (which in 90% of the movie was amazingly successful), do they allow him to sing Isolation in a way which sounds nothing like Curtis at all? This scene mystifies me completely. Riley sounds like a sick choir boy, so I was expecting the engineer to say ""Ian, what's wrong?""...but at the end of the song he tells him, essentially, ""great job, that's a wrap"". Sorry, no. That vocal track isn't even close to reality. The second issue is with the ending. Corbijn seems to be suggesting Ian took his life primarily as a result of his anguish over relationship issues, his love for Annik and guilt over what he had done to his wife. This is of course a distinct possibility, and no one will ever know the truth, but to those who know the history, the music, the lyrics, the environment, the epilepsy....this implication seems a little over-simplistic (although to be fair, since the movie was based on Debbie Curtis's book ""Touching From a Distance"", perhaps Corbijn was trying to stay true to what she had written, and I have not read that book). Also, Corbijn made it seem Curtis's suicide was almost a ""last minute"", or at best, a ""last hour"", decision. Again....maybe. But it didn't ring true to my sense of what was likely. Your mileage may vary. Finally, I was disappointed there was no mention of the album ""Closer"", even though we hear tracks from it. Odd to say the least.

Certainly a film worth seeing, but for the true Joy Division aficionado, get the documentary by Grant Gee. Superb.",1267747200,,2879,4.543352601156069

3280765,4,B00104AYGU,"I remember first hearing Ian Curtis' haunting, gloomily dictatorial croon in the 2001 semi classic ""Donnie Darko"" and as a kid listening to Nine Inch Nails' version of ""Dead Souls"" on ""The Crow"" soundtrack.  They struck me, and still do, as one of the darkest bands I have ever heard--move over, all you candya** contemporary posers like Manson or Evanescence.  One might even say that they went full circle with the lyrics of insanity, impending doom, etc with Curtis' absurdly early demise.  They were the real thing.

Anton Corbjin's ""Control"" is not so much about the band Joy Divison itself as Curtis' life.  Shot in a sort of sepia black and white style typical of his photography, a minimalist approach to this enigmatic and ultra tragic figure is employed to maximum effect.  Inspired by Deborah Curtis's ""Touching From A Distance"", a biopic on her tumultuous relationship with Curtis, I couldn't but feel that some of the uglier aspects of Curtis' personality--and the very real possibility that he faked his epilepsy--were glossed over.  We don't see much of the monstrous behavior Curtis would often display, like dumping a Bloody Mary on his wife's head for dancing with a friend at their wedding, or nearly kicking in Tony Wilson's door (the scene makes his verbal assault on the legendary music producer seem ""cool"") when he didn't get his way.

Don't get me wrong, this is a fine film and illustrates well how Curtis' infidelity and non-communicativeness, worlds apart seemingly from everyone else, may have led to his tragic demise. It is also a fantastic portrayal of the post industrial punk scene of that time.  But I can't help wondering if there was something else going on besides these things.  Ian Curtis was a person who did not want help.  Deborah Curtis suggested he see a psychologist on numerous occasions and he absolutely refused to do so.

The film illustrates some very real possibilities, but I doubt that the final book or film on Curtis has been written or made.  That said, this is a nearly great film everyone who has any interest a classic band and a sad musical figure should see.",1254268800,,2120,4.855555555555555
3280766,5,B00104AYGU,"First and most important, this movie is about Ian Curtis, not about the band itself. Anyone going into this movie who wants to see the best bio on Joy Division will be disappointed. The director himself says this is about Ian's life, his troubles etc...

Second it is a beautiful movie, what I loved about it is you really get a sense of what Ian was going through, you can feel it. The lyrics in his songs make so much sense and bring new meaning to the songs based on what he was going through in life. One conception I always had about Joy Division that was squashed in this movie is the fact I was always pissed Ian took his own life. His music was so good, timeless, and brillant. After seeing this film I doubt, even if he would have not killed himself he would have continued. Joy Division would not have survived.

Again this is a wonderful movie about a troubled man and one of the most important figures in rock. Any TRUE Joy Division fan will enjoy this movie which is entirely in black and white.",1253750400,,1008,4.3
3280767,5,B00104AYGU,"I remember when I first saw this in the Corner House in Manchester, THE place to watch this movie for obvious reasons. I was not into Joy Division at the time, but this movie, and the lyrics in the songs sent shivers through my soul. I have since watched the film several more times and cannot get enough of it. The emotion and the bleakness of life in Manchester in the late 70's is portrayed excellently, and Sam Riley puts EVERYTHING into his performance and he was cast perfectly by Corbijn.

A must see for anyone with intelligence, and a passion for art, and the beauty and darkness of life and the 'human condition'. Who says young people can't be depressed?",1253404800,,665,4.4958677685950414

And the band that re-enacts them in the movie, and does it for real, in live performances, is as good as the original, no kidding. It's a shame this band never made it to America. The flight was booked, they were ready to go. But something really nasty happened. That may sound like a familiar rock & roll tune, but I thought this film was particularly well done, with a sense of realism and fine performances.",1251936000,,510,4.4361702127659575
3280769,4,B00104AYGU,"I'm reading reviews on this film that have been both positive and negative, but agree with the many that have written that you must be a fan of the group, and understand a little about Ian's motivations and problems to get the most from it.  Coupled with that, you must also understand the time and the place.  If you don't, it is unlikely that you will be able to comprehend what all the fuss is about, let alone write a fair review for this film.  I have read several books on the group, and have also read Deborah Curtis's account in her book `Touching from a distance.'  My interest in the group also reached into my own musical performances.  The band I was drummer for would always kick of every gig with a rendition of `No Love lost.'

`Control' is a look at the short, brilliant life of Ian Curtis from the years 1973 to 1980.  At that time there was a major depression in the UK, particularly in the North of England.  At this time it was not unusual for youngsters to have major angst and a feeling of despair with the state of the nation.  This film shows that those feelings were often twinned with a glimmer of hope of breaking free of it.  This picture is a look at all of those things.  Coupled with a tragic end for Curtis, and a new, albeit uncertain beginning for the surviving members (who went on to form New Order.)  Ironically New Order went on to be more successful, which makes this story even more incredible, given Curtis's obvious genius.

The film is shot in Black and White mainly because most of the Joy Division photography from the time was shot in Black and White (A smart move by Corbjin).  The actors play most of the music as a group in this film and I'm not sure if it's ever been done as successfully as it's done here.  They actually gel pretty well, and its very impressive considering they only rehearsed for a few weeks.

The acting is very believable.  Sam Riley as Ian Curtis is quite literally mind-blowing. Riley's performance carries the film as the troubled, epileptic, genius singer-songwriter, of an up and coming band.  Torn between his obligations as a husband and father, and his quest to be the quintessential rock and roll star.  Samantha Morton fills the role of Deborah superbly.  She plays Ian's young wife and mother to newly born Natalie.  She is the most humane character of the film, and is consistently and intensely worried about Ian's state of mind throughout.

Other great performances come from Toby Kebbell as Rob Gretton (Joy Division's spirited and dynamic manager.) and Joe Anderson as Peter Hook.  In fact Anderson does a perfect impersonation of Hooky both physically and verbally, he also gets to be the hard- case of the group, especially when a fight breaks out because of Ian's refusal to go on stage.  These characters also provide some humor, which serves to allow some light in, despite the darkness of the film.

For me, the films end evoked deep emotion because of the fact that Ian was so young when he passed.  However at the same time, it made me smile, because Joy Division's legacy is all around us.  They really put the Manchester music scene on the map and paved the way for the likes of The Happy Mondays, The Stone Roses, Oasis, and many others.  He also influenced Moby, and The Killers.  With that said Ian's death was a tragedy of a young man who could not cope, but what we can be thankful for from his life and his unfortunate death is the wonderful catalogue of music he left behind in such a short career and the many who he influenced and still influences today.  Thank-you Ian.",1251676800,,3577,4.517884914463453
3280770,4,B00104AYGU,"films like this are important, no matter how silly people think they are, I would've never ever heard of Joy Division had it not been for this movie playing on Showtime. Joy Division was incredible! Innovative and, they just plain rocked. I do think that in the film they shouldve focused on the other members more because everyone in the group was super talented. The director did a superb job in depicting the isolation, disappointment, anger, and pain Ian lived through. Even though he did bring some of it on himself. The film shows a young kid who was, completely human, bored, and looking for his escape from Manchester. The black and white film color depicts Ian's seemingly gray mood cleverly, almost like your looking through his eyes. Sam Riley really looks like the real Ian Curtis , and he played the part perfectly, although his voice isn't as awkward and strange as Ian's, but the cast did a great rendition. And it also stayed genuine, depicting the disregard and disrespect Ian had for his poor wife. Its crazy because he would write songs about her and he cheated on her, poor woman must've been humiliated. Very good movie. Interesting character study.",1247961600,,1170,4.797029702970297
3280771,4,B00104AYGU,"Anton Corbijn, who had been one of the staff photographers on the NME in the 80's and 90's has produced a beautiful movie on Ian Curtis and Joy Division. If you know the way that Mr Corbijn used to make photographs for that musical weekly, it is visually slightly different. Instead of grainy images with innovative angles of vision, we get a very straightforward photography that suits the storyline well. Of course, if you know rock, Joy Division or even if you have read the book by his wife, you will already know the storyline by heart. WE discover Joy Division to be just another band...but with a very strong new musical approach. Since the movie is based on her book (Touching from a distance) the book does of course provide a sympathetic image of Debbie Curtis but  also a rather neutral one of his on-the-road mistress Annik Honore. Apparently the main actor sang and the band played themselves which is very surprising because they are excellent and sound and look very much like the original band. The portrayal of Ian Curtis as a talented young man who suddenly becomes this iconic leader of a post-punk band is excellently portrayed and we see his disintegration by his epilepsy and alcohol lead to his early death. As Corbijn says in the excellent interview: it was alcohol combined with exhaustion and his epilepsy drugs that made him more depressed and made small problems seem unsurmountable. Indeed as he said a man loved by 2 women does usually not commit suicide. Anyway it is a very discreet and beautiful movie.",1247961600,,1535,4.749063670411985
3280772,3,B00104AYGU,"SPOILERS AHEAD....

Ian Curtis, lead singer of Joy Division, killed himself in ""gray and miserable"" Macclesfield in 1980 at the age of 23.  Anton Corbijn's ""Control,"" shot in black and white, gets the gray and miserable parts of Curtis' life exactly right. The movie is based on a book by Curtis' wife Deborah. They were married when he was 19 and she was 18. They had a child. He was depressed. He joined a band. He began having epileptic seizures. He started cheating on his wife. The band started to become successful. The seizures got worse. The end.

Director Corbijn is known mainly as a rock photographer and, though well-acted, the movie feels a bit like a slideshow -- full of memorable (and depressing) imagery, plus concert performances that capture the look, feel and sound of Joy Division's live shows. As a biopic, it's a major contrast to a movie like ""I'm Not There"" which expands on the persona(s) of the artist and finds new ways to dramatize the impact of a creative life.  ""Control"" reduces Curtis' life to an oppressive kitchen sink drama.  It's realistic, but not uplifting. And you already know how it ends.  If you know nothing about Ian Curtis and Joy Division you'll get a better understanding about his and the band's impact on the world by reading Wikipedia than you will by watching this film.",1246579200,2,1322,4.726086956521739

3280776,4,B00104AYGU,"Train wrecks are endlessly fascinating, especially when the passengers are young, so talented and so full of potential.  ""Control"" gives us the disaster everyone now sees coming.  The script is based on the book ""Touching From A Distance"" by Deborah Curtis, wife of the late Ian Curtis.  Her memories and director Anton Corbijn's eye for texture drive this rather slow, mannered take on the Joy Division story.  Sitting room aridity and Euro artiness seem inevitable with this particular concoction.  It's a worthwhile exercise but fortunately just one version of a music phenom's howl in the night.  The recent Joy Division documentary is an essential companion piece and a must see for all devotees of the band and post-punk.  Corbijn's film, on the other hand, gives us a young man who could not reconcile his hasty marriage with a compulsion to scream out his dark phantoms from the stage.

The Dutchman's cinematography is bleak but beautiful, the end of the film, as expected, wrenching.  And yet the last leap is more a relief, a kind of release, than an emotional gut punch.  Curtis had an interior as grim as his surroundings, an internal landscape drained of fellow feeling by a fascination with the abomination, but the descent needs a counterpoint.  Curtis had a laddishness too.  When Curtis (Sam Riley) explains ""Man City Blue"" to his Belgian girlfriend Anik, there is a glimmer of the submerged Manc scally.  The real Curtis supported a football team, drank pints, and engaged in elaborate pranks with his bandmates, all barely out of school (they were particularly fond of a turd holding challenge).  The trajectory of ""Control"" doesn't allow for the contrast of British bluster and reserve.  The film gives us only the latter, to the extreme, which in a way seems a clich.  The visual acuity of the film is undeniable, however.  The marital meltdown is equally powerful for its authenticity, and Riley does a very good spastic chicken dance and pale-eyed gaze to the beyond: both trademarks of a seer too soon felled.",1242432000,,2034,4.952802359882006

Yet ""Control"" is not really about Joy Division. There is not much music; the film makes no mention, none whatsoever, of the band's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/second/dp/B000VZC4CQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">second</a>&nbsp;and final album. The actors went to the trouble of learning to play some of the songs, but they can't help sounding amateurish -- if you haven't heard the songs before, you are unlikely to understand why there was anything special about them.

Moreover, the other band members come across as louts. This provides the film's few memorable lines of dialogue, but seems unfair. Watching ""Control,"" one might believe that Ian had no interaction with his own band. He is shown attacking Bernard in the scene that leads to his first epileptic fit, but he is never shown talking to the guys about anything. They all act quite cold to each other. They have little love of music; they think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Buzzcocks/dp/B00008BLCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Buzzcocks</a>&nbsp;are ""okay,"" but show no enthusiasm. Ian is shown offering his services as singer to the other guys as if he were a total stranger. One wonders why they accepted.

Look, just because the film has Joy Division in it doesn't mean that everyone involved has to be an icy death machine. Even Tony Wilson, that charismatic bon vivant and con man, is a gloomy Gus in this film. Watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24-Hour-Party-People/dp/B00007BK2N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24 Hour Party People</a>&nbsp;-- it is not pleasant viewing for a Joy Division fan, but it shows the sleazy, yet exciting and adventurous atmosphere surrounding the burgeoning Manchester scene. People knew there was something good in the air, and they were excited about it. That's why they spent their free time doing it. ""Control"" shows none of that. Producer&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Martin-Hannett/dp/B000EJ9KJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Martin Hannett</a>&nbsp;is never mentioned by name. Instead, the spotlight shines on manager Rob Gretton, who steals the show simply by swearing a lot.

Okay, fine, the film doesn't have to be about Joy Division. But it's not really about one man's anguish, either. The first half of the film gives the impression that the director's knowledge of dialogue and human interaction derives entirely from French New Wave&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/films/dp/B000BC8SWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">films</a>. Scene after scene consists primarily of ""smoking cigarettes with existential meaning,"" to the point where it is unintentionally comical.

For example, the film opens with Ian reciting a verse from ""Heart And Soul,"" and shows him purchasing an LP. But that's all it does to show his attraction to poetry and music. Why was he interested in these things? Okay, he didn't like to show his feelings, but every earnest young man, especially one with an introverted character, has numerous pedantic opinions on rock music, and greatly enjoys holding forth on them. The film shows Ian and Deborah attending the Sex Pistols concert, but they show no interest in the music. Ian gives no sign of excitement, except perhaps some slightly more animated head-nodding. In another scene, he flatly recites from Wordsworth, one of the least edgy poets in the English language. What's the big deal, why is he interested in Wordsworth? More importantly, why do his friends listen to him? Do they view him as an authority on intellectual matters?

The courtship between Deborah and Ian is so bizarre that it's funny. Deborah is shown to have a boyfriend; she pouts in front of Ian, who gives her no emotional cues. They both look very bored at the concert, when suddenly, they leap into each other's arms. Starting immediately, the boyfriend disappears and is never heard from again, and Ian proposes to Deborah in the very next scene. This also is peculiar. Ian, both in the film and in real life, seemed to have little taste for family life and fatherhood (""with children my time is so wastefully spent,"" he cruelly wrote). Yet here, he's the one who initiates every move. He proposes, and he also asks Deborah to have a baby. It is not unrealistic that a man might have an idealized view of marriage, and then become dissatisfied with the reality, but that's precisely the sort of thing you have to carefully explore if you're making a feature film.

But here? You honestly have to wonder why the man is depressed. In the early scenes, he's a dashing mop-top with a manly chin, who wins Deborah's heart without the slightest effort. There is some indication later that he is distraught by the diagnosis of epilepsy, but this quickly takes a backseat to the love triangle with Annik Honore, which Ian himself initiates of his own free will. The only logical conclusion would seem to be that Ian always had a self-absorbed death wish, and willfully ignored his slavishly devoted wife (traces of Emily Watson in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breaking-the-Waves/dp/6305899681/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breaking the Waves</a>""). Oh, and he also sang a few songs in the process.

Toward the end, Ian laments, ""I give them everything on stage and they want more."" He says that no one can understand how his performances affect him. The film gives no indication, prior to this line, that this is the case. Ian's performances just seem to be a mild distraction from his usual moping; a distraction that he engages in just so he can have something to do.

There are two possibilities. Either a) Anton Corbijn is a hack, or b) everything good about Ian Curtis had already been expressed in his music, and thus there is no point in a film about his short life. Either way, there is little reason to watch ""Control.""",1240185600,13,6667,5.894409937888199

3280781,3,B00104AYGU,"A biopic on the short and (I guess) somewhat tragic life of Joy Division vocalist Ian Curtis. Starting out as a pre-emo kid on the streets of Manchester up till his suicide at the age of 24, this tale shows how fame as a music star is just too much for some to handle, even when you're dealing with the smaller amounts.

I dunno though, watching this I kept thinking that this story isn't really all that interesting or filmworthy other than the fact that it's main subject died so young. Strangely the picture takes place mostly in the mid to late 70's but it's entirely shot in black & white and seemed like the wrong choice for it, no matter if it's a sad tale or not. And even though Sam Riley is the spitting image of the late Curtis, down to his appearance and stage presence (of which I had to go to YouTube to refresh my memory of who Joy Division was like in the first place), his life story seemed too trivial and predictable for me to really care. He and the band make it quickly, he has to deal with occasional epilepsy, he marries young and has an affair/love-triangle, and finally decides to check out of life. Pretty by the numbers really, and in the end you wonder if anyone today who doesn't hate the world while wearing black mascara and dark clothes really cares.

So I wanted to like it more than I did.  But it's too long (doomed rock star biopics should never run more than 90 minutes) and it was hard for me at least to work up much sympathy for Curtis, who, as depicted here and aside from the medical issue of his epilepsy, created his own situation (he wanted to impulsively get married, he wanted to have a child) and then does not have the guts or the energy to either extricate himself from it or live with the consequences of his own actions and end his extramarital affair.  Instead he spends a lot of time crying and feeling sorry, mostly for himself.  I imagine there are lots of plumbers, stockbrokers, and farmers with exactly the same bad-decision trap as Curtis.

3280789,5,B00104AYGU,"Dutch photographer Anton Corbijn made ""Control"" about the man and the band that brought him to England: Ian Curtis of Joy Division, which carried on as New Order after Curtis' death in 1980. ""Control"" follows Curtis' life from 1973-1980, starting with his high school days in Macclesfield with future wife Debbie (Samantha Morton), through joining a band with Bernard Sumner (James Anthony Pearson) and Peter Hook (Joe Anderson) in 1976, to Joy Division's success -having added drummer Stephen Morris (Harry Treadaway). All the while,  Ian (Sam Riley) suffered increasingly from the crushing stress of the band and family, exacerbated by side effects from his medications for inadequately uncontrolled epilepsy. Anton Corbijn knew Curtis briefly, having photographed the band, so ""Control"" feels like a personal and heartfelt project.

The black-and-white photography, Sam Riley's resemblance to Ian Curtis, and the music are striking. The music is actually performed by the actors, whose instruments are plugged in and microphones turned on. Riley has limited experience as an actor; he is a singer, and a darned good one for Joy Division's post-punk sound. They sound good. The gig scenes are electric. ""Control"" is black-and-white, because the band's visual history is almost entirely black-and-white. It's beautiful. The film is longer than it needs to be but doesn't  feel prolonged. It spends time establishing Ian Curtis' ambition, talent, temperament, and then his deteriorating state of mind. Sam Riley's performance is surprisingly charismatic and sympathetic without ever being sentimental. Toby Kebbell provides some comic relief as manager Rob Gretton. ""Control"" is the story of a modern poet and one of the most memorable music-themed films I've seen.

The DVD (Weinstein 2008): ""The Making of Control"" (23 min) interviews the director about his inspiration and decisions, the cast about playing real people, and writer Matt Greenhalgh about his process. ""In Control: A Conversation with Anton Corbijn"" (13 min) discusses the director's relationship with the band, his view of Curtis, and casting the film. ""Extended Live Concert Performances from the Film"" (9 min) offers 3 performances. ""Music Videos"" are ""Transmission"" from 1979 (3 1/2 min), ""Atmosphere"" (4 min) from 1988, and a cover of ""Shadowplay"" (4 min) by The Killers from 2007. There is a Still Gallery of 49 photos, and ""Promotional Materials"" include 2 theatrical trailers. The director's audio commentary is constant and informative, although Anton Corbijn mumbles a bit. He talks about locations, filming, actors, the real Ian Curtis, and the reasons behind his choices. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH and Spanish.

But the directing, acting, editing, and cinematography quality from this pic simply blew me away. I was not expecting such care for detail and razor sharp precision yet artistic vision from a first time director (the famous photographer Anton Corbijn) and mostly unheard of cast. Yes at the least Mr. Sam Riley should have earned an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Ian Curtis, no doubt about it. Samantha Riley is indescribably excellent as his wife Deborah, these two roles could not have been done better. The best complement I can give Control is that it captures the environment and 'atmosphere' of Ian Curtis's world like a dream.",1220400000,3,803,4.661971830985915

The atmosphere, mood, and composition is also dead on, creating a wonderful and moving look at the early post-punk movement.  I find myself agreeing with other reviewers who say that the movie could have been better...though I'm not sure what that would entail.  There is, however, a lot of emotional subtley I think, and in the places where people claim that the movie ""drags on"", I think there is a virtue in being inexplicit about the character's struggle.  I agree that this struggle could have been cut shorter, but I think the way in which the events leading up to Ian's suicide ""drag on"" somehow echoes the very appeal of Joy Division's music.  It's dark and brooding, and it maintains the distance that is so central to Ian's tragedy.",1219968000,2,837,4.818181818181818

3280793,4,B00104AYGU,"Of the three Joy Division films available, ""24 Hour Party People,"" Grant Gee's excellent documentary ""Joy Division,"" and ""Control,"" ""Control"" is the least fun and the most demanding. It suffers from concentrating on Ian Curtis and his final days - it moves quickly through the formation of Joy Division to the chaotic and disastrous last week of his life, exploring his final hours in some detail. So it's depressing - interesting and beautiful to watch, but it ends badly, of course. The film does justice to the onset of his epilepsy, betrayal of his young wife and baby, a love affair he can't resist, the band's new fame, ending in his suicide, all sensitively treated with taste and restraint. Anton Corbijn's photography is gorgeous and the acting is strong, but the script is minimalist to a fault. A standout is the part of Annik Honore, played by the lissome and limpid-eyed Alexandra Maria Lara. Corbijn overdoes the shots of her smiling up prettily at Curtis from the audience in concert scene after scene, but this movie makes it as clear as the docu how different she was from Curtis's everyday Macclesfield milieu. Alexandra Maria Lara also played Hitler's high-spirited secretary Traudl in the outstanding ""Downfall.""",1217980800,2,1232,5.014634146341463
3280794,4,B00104AYGU,"""Control"" is a biopic about Ian Curtis, the lead singer of the 1970's British rock band Joy Division, who killed himself in 1980 immediately before the group was to embark on its first American tour.  The movie chronicles Curtis' early days in Manchester, the formation and rise of the band, his unhappy marriage, his serial philandering, his uncontrollable epilepsy, and his lifelong battle with depression.

One might be tempted, looking at the bareboned detailing of his life, to ask if there is really anything new here.  And indeed, Curtis' story seems to follow a fairly standard arc for the lives of artists in general and rock musicians in particular (though there doesn`t seem to be a whole lot of illicit drug use going on in this case), and as such the movie doesn't show us much of anything we haven't already seen countless times before in similar works.  Yet, ""Control"" is so cool, understated and restrained in its handling of the material that it succeeds in drawing us into the lives of these characters in spite of the over-familiarity of the tale.  The conflicts are real and the emotions raw, particularly when dealing with Curtis' rocky relationship with his wife, Deborah, who loved Ian unconditionally but could never get him to reciprocate those feelings, partly because Ian had fallen in love with a Belgian fan he met while on tour.

In a beautifully controlled and thoughtful performance, Sam Riley poignantly captures the sadness that seems to lie ever present at the core of Curtis' being, while Samantha Morton conveys the almost desperate state of a woman too much in love to realize, until it is too late perhaps, that she isn`t receiving love in return (the Matt Greenhalgh screenplay is based largely on Deborah`s memoirs chronicling their time together).  Much of the anguish Curtis went through in his life served as source material for the lyrics to many of the group`s songs, a number of which are used to provide a running commentary throughout the film.  The movie also makes effective use of voiceover narration to try to figure out what is going on in that troubled head of his.

For his impressive directorial debut, photographer Anton Corbijn has wisely chosen to shoot his film in artful black-and-white, the better to capture the starkness of the scene and the state of his character's mind.  Joy Division purists may object to the fact that Corbijn has had the actors themselves perform the songs rather than dubbing in the originals, but they do a fine job overall in interpreting the pieces.

Whether Curtis, in the long run, had a harder life than many who don't wind up committing suicide is not for us to determine.  What the film does make clear, however, is that once he felt he was losing control over his life (symbolized by his constant and seemingly incurable epileptic seizures) and had pretty much made a mess of things as a husband, a father and a lover, his purpose for continuing in the struggle seemed to have disappeared.  What a sad conclusion to come to, especially when one is only twenty-three years old.  With subtlety and insight, ""Control"" movingly distills the essence of that sadness.",1217721600,3,3158,4.867537313432836
3280795,3,B00104AYGU,"This film is made in black and white which immediately fosters idea that it should be treated as an art movie.  It starts that was but half way thru it, it simply drags on.  I did not know much about ""Joy Division"" and Ian Curtis, until I started reading film and book reviews about him.  Surely, it is always intriguing for anyone to try to figure out what drives a person of 23 years to commit suicide, the way Ian did.  Born and raised in Manchester, with no education and not much to do, he marries young, has a baby on the impulse and starts career as a singer in a local band as a way to keep himself involved with the crowd and nurtures his musical talent.  He also likes to write poems so it seems natural, his attraction to the art.  Until one day, Ian discovers that he is epileptic.  His life is consisting of pills he needs to have around the clock in order to avoid the seizures that have devastating effect on his body and overall mental state.  Tours to promote his band's material, binge drinking, late hours inside crowded clubs, hords of fans and women are adding unexpected stress to his life.  Ian is unable and unwilling to tend to his wife and young child and is having mistress who is French, seemingly sophisticated and free as a person -- which is amazing to him.  He starts his affair with Annik Honore almost as a way to create a new freedom for himself only to learn too soon that it is impossible to have it all.  He is immature, more than he is a jerk and emotionally unstable to handle all the changes that happened to him too quickly in both his personal and professional life.  Ian is troubled and there is really no one that can help him with his problems.  Him committing suicide almost seems like the only available option to the complete chaos in his life.  He is just too much of a burden to his own self and people around him and with his epilepsy his future is bleak anyway...I think I would like to listen to his album - his voice seems to be unique.  I still need to hear his message from his lyrics.",1217289600,2,2042,4.267532467532468
3280796,3,B00104AYGU,"Biopics are usually very dull and drag their feet getting to the core of the story that matters rather than what the director uses to assume credibility or closeness to the source. This is not one of those movies because you never connect with Ian to feel like you have any connection at all, nor do you get a sense of chronology by music, lyrics, or anything else that made us drawn to the movie.

You watch a very beautiful picture show. At times unflattering to the 90 seconds we get of Sumner's dialogue, and in general, the actors seem a little peeved they are even in the movie, but honest to a fault since given the writer's apathetic take and connection to the subject, ""that is what it was like"" we are left to assume. There are many things missed and the band aspect could be substituted for just about any job, as the music and gigs are atmosphere and not plot with the emphasis on Ian only showing up to sing, and not pouring out emotions in to writing his lyrics. I am left wondering what was left out or what the writer was thinking some 20 years on leaving the cast and story to be told out of memories that were not so clear or maybe the director, an extremely talented photographer, was making a movie out of a romanticised notion going over at 24 frames per second shots he wished he could have taken at the time.

Simlarities to the Doors can be made, but here, Ian's life is not made glamorous. We do sort of miss the point though, you feel as shut out by him as his wife must have felt, and yet even some more token performances and chronology could have helped us fans put the songs in to perspective since if this was a movie about some steelworker, we would not have watched it. We watched this because it was about Ian, the lead singer of Joy Division, but yet I appreciate that it was not a music video with liner notes stitching his life together.",1217289600,3,1874,4.290960451977401

3280801,5,B00104AYGU,"Noted rock photographer and video maker Anton Corbijn, who had met the members of Joy Division on a couple of occasions in the late 1970s, makes his debut as a director of a feature film with his take on the life and death of Ian Curtis. (The script is based on the 1995 memoir from Debbie Curtis, Ian's wife.)

As to the film, ""Control"" (122 min.) is as good a rock bio-pic that I can remember, keeping in mind that this is meant to be a film about Ian Curtis, not about Joy Division as such. Ian's struggles with epilepsy, alcohol and medication abuse, and most of all his relationship with people, including his wife Debbie, his Belgian girlfriend Annik, the band members, and last but not least, himself. As the movie goes on, and Ian's moods turn darker, it becomes more difficult to watch, because you now how it all will end. The movie is appropriately shot in black and white. The acting is outstanding, none more so than Sam Riley as Ian Curtis. Special kudos als for the four actors playing the Joy Division songs. This is not a playback or dubbed: it's the actors themselves playing the music, and they did a great job at it. I thought that Anton Corbijn did an outstanding job as well in directing this film.

The DVD comes with a number of nice extras. In particular ""The Making of Control"" (23 min.) and ""A Conversation with Anton Corbijn"" (12 min.) are quite insightful. The ""Extended Live Performances From the Film"" segment is mislabeled, in the sense that it brings a mere 3 songs (Transmission, Candidate, and Leaders of Men), so it is not quite the ""extension"" it could have been. There are a couple of videos as well, most interesting the 1979 performance from a BBC show, which is fascinating (and underscores how well Sam Riley has ""caught"" Ian Curtis). In all, ""Control"" is a fantastic movie. It puzzles me why the movie failed to get any traction at the box office here in the US (it was released only in a couple of cities; I never had a chance to see it in the theatre here in Cincinnati). This DVD is a nice way to catch up. If you have a nice home theatre-style sound system, it will absolutely enhance your enjoyment of this film. ""Control"" is highly recommended!",1215129600,3,2193,4.493734335839599
3280802,4,B00104AYGU,"Control is the movie version of the book Touching from a Distance: Ian Curtis and Joy Division by Deborah Curtis.  Although the movie is a kinder portrayal of the life of Ian Curtis, it succeeds in showing him as a cruel and dark person.  One understands that it is from these depths that the innovation and art of the music of Joy Division comes from, yet this was no excuse for the way that he treated those who loved him.  In fact, Control is more a love story than a musical tribute to Joy Division.  The film contained the correct balance of dramatic and musical effect.  The starkness of the black and white filming helped add to this effect.  It is also useful that a lack of hero worship is given to Ian, unlike the life of many of his fallen musical sole mates.  This helps one admire the music of Joy Division for what it is rather than who created it.",1214784000,2,862,4.283950617283951

3280804,5,B00104AYGU,"Joy Division are a group that require little introduction to those familiar with the late-70's and 80's post-punk scene.  One of the most influential rock bands of all-time, it grew out of 4 guys from Manchester in love with punk bands such as the Buzzcocks and the Sex Pistols.  But rather than having a similar sound to those punk bands, Joy Division's sound was something entirely new, ushering the post-punk sound, one that combined the raw edge of punk but with gothic and dramatic tendencies.  This sound would prove influential to countless 80's bands and also more recent ones, most notably ""Interpol"" and ""Editors"".  The Joy Division story is a tragic one, as singer Ian Curtis committed suicide at the age of 23.  The remaining members then went on to form New Order, sell 20 million albums in the process and the rest is history.  ""Control"" is a semi-autobiographical look at Curtis' rapid rise to fame and equally fast descent into despair.

The story traces Curtis' life from the age of 16 and beyond.  A David Bowie worshipping, chain-smoking, distracted teenager, Curtis never quite fit in with the school crowd and used music and poetry as an outlet to his emotions.  He married while still in high school and had a child shortly thereafter, all of this before being in the band.  Then the story shows us how he met up with the other band members and their rapid rise to fame.  Throughout all this, Curtis worked a day job as an unemployment office counselor and had to tend care to his wife and newly-born daughter.  The struggle between being in the band and being on the road (which in itself was not quite enough to pay the bills) and his family responsibilities not to mention his epileptic condition proved to be too much for Curtis to bear and the movie concludes with him tragically putting an end to his life.

I found ""Control"" to be bar none of the best movie bio-pics ever.  The director's decision to make the movie in black and white is an absolutely brilliant one, as it accurately catches the essence of he band, whose artwork was always in black and white and also gives the picture the gritty feel it merits.  The best part of the movie of course is the breakout performance of Sam Riley as the title character, who nails Curtis to the point of eeriness.  The downcast looks, the hairstyle, the jittery movements on stage, everything is bang-on.  I read somewhere that the singer of New Order had to stop watching the film midway because Riley bore too much of a resemblance to Curtis that it was scary to him.  I can see why.  Another star in this movie is the music.  Joy Division's music is great of course, but the way the director selectively uses songs that fit the mood of what's currently unfolding on screen is remarkable.

If I were to have one issue with this film I would have to say that the reason for some of Curtis's emotions are never really explained.  Why exactly is he so depressed when he has so much to be proud of?  Why did he stop loving his wife so suddenly when she never stopped loving him?  Maybe Curtis proved to be so complex of a character that even he himself didn't really know who he truly was.  It should be noted that this DVD offers generous extras such as a commentary track, a 20mns making-of documentary, a director interview, still gallery, promotional materials, extended live performances from the film.  But the highlight would have to be the music videos, where we see the real Curtis performing on BBC and see just how much of a resemblance there is between him and the actor that portrays him.  Overall, ""Control"" is brilliant, essential stuff for both fans and also non-fans who just want to sit through a great drama.  Highly recommended!",1214697600,2,3721,4.613981762917933

I have just watched the DVD from Amazon, and while I don't think it was as good as seeing the movie in the movie theater 3 times, this is not to be missed for any reason.  The director saw Joy Division live and was able to incorporate the music into his aesthetic as a photographer and then movie director.  As we all know, part of Joy Division's lure is the incredible marriage with the image (and at times absence of image) of the music, and how the images came to speak to all of us fans as icons of the far-reaching sounds of this incredible, divine band.  The director makes a very formally-wise film, utilizing and loving up  the actor transformed into Ian.  Each scene is perfectly married into the story and the music.

3280808,4,B00104AYGU,"The 2007 film ""Control"" chronicles the life and brief musical career of Ian Curtis, Joy Division's doomed frontman. An epileptic whose stage performances mirrored his seizures, Curtis was also entangled in complicated personal relationships that he could not navigate successfully. His death on May 18, 1980, gave birth to yet another legend of the rock star who lived fast, died young, and left behind a good-looking corpse.

Anton Corbijn's film exposes that myth and reveals the human cost of Curtis' fatal choice. His young wife, Deborah, penned the book on which this film is based, and we first see Ian as a schoolboy in love with Bowie and all things rock and roll. He seduces Debbie away from a fellow student, proposes marriage, and sets up a home with her, all the while penning lyrics for the music career he strives to achieve.

The film's major strength is in these early scenes, when it's established that Ian and Debbie have a connection early on. Because that connection will be tested and ultimately betrayed when Curtis goes on the road and meets Annik Honore, the ""other woman"" of Ian's life.

The film also shows the visual appeal of the band, due to their stark fashion sense and energizing live performances. Sam Riley is more than just a lookalike for Curtis; he's a skilled interpretor of Curtis' stage mannerisms and voice. The bonus extended live performances on the DVD are awe-inspiring (one wishes that more than just three of the live performances had been included). But the film is more than just ""Joy Division: The Movie."" It tells the story of Ian's rapid decline even as he's on the brink of success. His condition forces pills and unnatural bedtimes for a rock star on him, and his life with Debbie becomes a series of brief moments between his return from a tour and her leaving for her job. The stark greys of the black-and-white cinematography reflect not just the accepted visual style of the band (as Corbijn states, the band was always thought of in black and white, due to the way they were photographed), but shows the bleakness of Curtis' worldview as he struggled with the demands of fame, fatherhood, marriage, and illness. By the end of the film, the audience is no longer sure that Curtis' death was pre-planned at the beginning of his fantasies to make it big (a charge that Debbie makes in her book). Instead, it seems like real life caught up to his romantic notions of early death and made it seem like he had no other choice.

The film is a great companion to Michael Winterbottom's ""24 Hour Party People,"" an altogether more cheerful affair which nonetheless had highlights in its section dealing with Joy Division. Corbijn's humor is not absent of humor, however, and there are moments which puncuate the grimness. If you know the story of Ian Curtis, you know how it turns out; but the moments that are amusing help to keep you interested in the film.

The movie is fair to both women in Curtis' life, and he isn't portrayed as the typical groupie-crazed rock star. Debbie grows to realize that Ian is going away from her, and she has lost him long before she finds him hanging in their kitchen. Annik is not a gold-digger but a caring, sympathetic fan, and their relationship is considerably less tawdry than it could have been portrayed. For all his faults, Ian in the film comes across as profoundly human, and unable in all his twenty-three years to come to terms with all that the world is laying on his doorstep.

I've been a huge Joy Division and New Order fan for ten years, and I always wondered if the story of Ian's life would ever get film treatment. Now it has, and the results are worth your time even if you're not a fan. As someone who lost a close friend to suicide last year, I know firsthand the grief that Curtis' friends and family must have felt in the aftermath of his death. This film goes a long way towards healing those wounds left over from a life cut far too short.",1214006400,,3951,4.637142857142857
3280809,3,B00104AYGU,"I'm a Big Joy Division fan going back to the early 80's. While I can appreciate director Anton Corbijn's personal tribute to JD's lead singer IAN CURTIS, the film is just too Dark and Excessively Slow to recommend to the average viewer.

Corbijn's stark B&W photography (He was a close friend to the original Band and held many a photo shoot with them..Their 1st two album covers were Black-then White. A third, Grey!) perfectly captures the atmosphere of dank Manchester, England in the 1970's. Sam Reilly is Amazing as Ian and mimics Ian's voice and performance mannerisms to-a-T. Samantha Morton (Minority Report, Woody Allen's Sweet & Lowdown, Elizabeth - The Golden Age) is heartbreakingly good as Ian's suffering wife. The actors playing JD band mates are noteworthy and seem to play their own instruments which certainly add to the realism. However, the film just plods on at a Snail's pace. Maybe this was the director's ploy, to depress us Slowly into Submission given the nature of Ian's illness and make us feel what Ian felt. Any solid JD fan knows that although their music could be Dark & Challenging, it was never Boring or Depressing. Although we're given very small glimpses into the creative psyche, recording and performance of the band, CONTROL is really the slight, personal story of Ian Curtis their lead singer. You'll rarely see much in the way of lengthy music clips here.

A better place to start is Grant Gee's new documentary JOY DIVISION just released by TWC as well. It paints a much broader picture of the Band and still maintains Ian's story as its main Focus. The music and performance clips of the Band are amazing and the Doc rarely drags. It features extensive interviews by remaining band members (nka NEW ORDER) and Control director Corbjin.",1213747200,6,1779,4.887417218543046

The JD story was told there, and Ian Curtis's brief life was touched on.  Control is a serious, and much more thoughtful look at Ian's life and death.  This movie is based on the book ""Touching From a Distance"" (penned by his widow Deborah) and sticks closely to it both factually and thematically.  The Ian seen here isn't the legend he later became; here he is a figure of great talent  - and greater flaws.

Sam Riley, in his first lead role, portrays Ian with a mimicry that's almost creepy.  (Don't believe me? Watch his performance of the song Transmission, then watch the original Joy Division performance included in the extras.)  Kudos to him and the other actors for actually performing the Joy Division songs themselves, rather than lipsyncing.  They pull it off admirably.

As to the movie itself, it's shot beautifully in black and white.  This is Anton Corbijn's first feature-length film, and he did a great job with it.  While this certainly isn't a happy movie, it's well worth seeing - whether or not you're a fan of the band.  Beautiful images, good storytelling, and great performances - they're all here.

The movie is based upon Deborah Curtis, Ian Curtis' wives memoirs of her teen age marriage to the lead singer of Joy Division upon until his 1980 suicide at the age of 23. The movie chronicles Ian's life from his mid teens through the birth of Joy Division and their albums Unknown Pleasures and Closer and ends with the his death. His epilepsy is featured here as the cause of his depression when really it was his meds. Also the movie makes it look like his marriage was most of the cause when once again the meds caused his personality change as well as marriage problems such as looking for the arms of another woman.

So while the film is based on an actual memoir it hardly follows it, and in fact for the most part is nothing like the memoirs twisting tales. But for a loose introduction and background on Ian Curtis this is a decent way to go.",1212796800,2,1100,4.208530805687204
3280813,4,B00104AYGU,"Ian Curtis, one of new wave's most prolific songwriters, died at the age of 23, unhappy and alone. Joy Division provided him with an outlet, but he couldn't be contained within the band. In fact, he felt alot of distance between the band and himself as if someone else were singing.

I an made a terrible mess out of his life-had kids and got married too early, had two mistresses, and hung himself in his wife's house because he felt like a total failure, which he was.

The film only gets 4 stars because I wanted more Joy Division music, more stage performances, and perhaps more videos of the original Joy Division(you only get three here). No mention of Warsaw, except for a performace of ""Leaders Of Men"", surely one of Warsaw's most superior songs, however, the title track is never sung at all. No ""Warsaw""? No star. Worth seeing anyway.",1212796800,,845,4.589403973509934
3280814,4,B00104AYGU,"This film is based on Deborah Curtis' biography and so this ""Ian Curtis"" is the Ian Curtis that she knew and Control in most respects adheres to her interpretation of his life. But it should be noted that Deborah Curtis knew but one side of Ian Curtis' story, her side. And like any other point of view that might have been chosen to tell this story, this one is limited & distorted. The writer of the screenplay is fully aware of the fact that Deborah's perspective is a limited one (as all of our perspectives are) and the screenplay makes some attempt (though not enough) to find the Ian that Deborah did not know, and that maybe no one knew. To achieve this screenwriter Matt Greenhalgh balances Deborah's own remembrance with the remembrance of other key figures in Ian's life (parents, band mates, Belgian girlfriend Annik) to give us a more rounded look at what it might have been like to be Ian Curtis. Unfortunately, these additional perspectives do not amount to as much as one would have liked them to as Ian was apparently not particularly close or open with parents or band mates. (The film rarely shows Ian interacting with either.) And the girlfriend just seems like a very pretty, very fresh, very young smiling face. Most likely the band has their own story to tell, as does the girlfriend Annik. To Deborah, Ian Curtis was a husband and so her story is one largely dominated by domestic squables. After the fourth or fifth round of domestic argument the film begins to feel like a film about marriage and not about music. The over-reliance on Deborah's perspective/biography begins to feel like a liability before the second hour of this two hour biopic begins, and the second hour is almost entirely devoted to the last moments of marital woe that, according to Deborah, sparked the final act. But there is so much more to this story than the one that Deborah has to tell. In addition to Ian the husband, there is Ian the singer and performer. And, most importantly to fans, there is the Ian Curtis that wrote some of the most austere and hypnotic and compelling rock music ever recorded. This is what is really missing form the film: a sense of where the music was coming from. Certainly some lyrics can be explained as autobiographical confessions of self-loathing and regret but some are comments and critiques on modern life.

To listeners of Joy Division's postpunk sound what was immediately alluring was that it sounded nothing like punk. Punk was manic and Joy Division was subdued. The sound was hollow but hypnotic and the voice was full of romantic longings and yearnings for some kind of transcendence but the romantic longing was always accompanied by the feeling that there was nothing to be done with these feelings. If punk was about irreverence and having a rebellious larf in the face of authority, Joy Division was about looking for something to revere and finding that modern life gave man very little to revere. In the face of utter hopelessness, the only grace to be found was in the music itself because the music offered trance-like beauties unavailable in real life (Unknown Pleasures). To fans, Ian & the band were the rarest of things, the expression of a genuinely original sensibility/musical vision. Unfortunately, this is the part of Ian's story that Deborah has the least access to--the writer Ian and the stage Ian is someone she barely knew--, and so it is simply not dealt with. We get no sense of what music meant to Ian nor what he was looking for in it, and without some kind of understanding of the music it is very difficult to understand Ian. Instead we get a story about a relationship and a cliched one at that. Sympathetic as we are with Deborah, rock wives rarely lead happy lives, and in biopics they almost always look like obstacles to their more talented husbands artistic urges & drives. Thats true here as well. And sad as the relationship between Ian and Deborah was it is simply one part of a larger story.

The other perspective on display here is the directors. As one might suspect from that very romantic film poster, director Anton Corbijn knows Ian as a photographic object. And, as a visual object itself, the film  is primarily a chance for Corbijn to display his own considerable gifts for grim yet starkly beautiful composition. From both the still  photographs that he took of the actual band circa 1980 (which should have been included in the DVD extra gallery) and from the film itself, one can understand that Corbijn felt a deep connection to Ian & Ian's unique romantic/existential sensibility and vision. As compelling and convincing as the film sometimes is, it is a work of art made by an artist that has his own ideas about what made Ian what he was and what made the music what it was. But, like all great artists, Ian was more than just the sum of his many influences (William Wordsworth, Lou Reed, Brain Eno, David Bowie, Roxy Music, Sex Pistols, Iggy Pop, Apocalypse Now, Werner Herzog...) and so no mere visual record of these influences and sources from which he drew will ever fully explain the artists own vision. Artists recognize greatness in others but the good ones always transcend their sources. Ian Curtis' true sources of inspiration are & will remain mysterious, no film can really know or show what Ian was or knew or what he felt when listening to a favorite song or reading a favorite book; no one can know what Ian was to Ian. Biopics are intriguing and frustrating because they are, at best, speculative. Though the film faithfully represents Deborah's version of things, the key moments in this life are ones that no one had any access to but Ian (how does anyone really know what he watched, or listened to, or thought in those last moments?). Faced with unknowability, it is our nature to be curious and to speculate but one should not mistake speculation for truth. As a result, the most valuable part of this DVD to those fans of Ian the artist and his formidable band mates (given short shrift in this film) will be the actual footage (not included in the actual film but included as a DVD extra along with Corbijn's 1988 video for Atmosphere and the Killers video for Shadowplay) of the real Joy Division playing Transmission.",1212796800,13,6247,4.697080291970803
3280815,5,B00104AYGU,"Anton Corbijn has probably lived up to the old adage ""A picture is worth a thousand words"" a million times over, having captured photos of too many acts to mention.  While he's done a number of music videos, he's more known for photography.  It's fitting then that his feature directorial debut seems to stand more of a collection of photos than one single film.  But don't worry, that's to the film's credit.

The main attraction of Corbijn's direction is a stark attention to detail.  As a photographer, there's one shot that has to speak volumes to viewers.  Corbijn takes advantage of numerous shots to get in Ian Curtis's head.  In one of the opening shots, a young Curtis, played brilliantly by Sam Riley, is seen sitting on his bead.  While we hear David Bowie blaring in the background, Corbijn gives us a look around, gazing at Curtis's book collection and pictures and posters of such iconic rock stars as Lou Reed.

As to the story, it's a very familiar one to Joy Division's fans.  So familiar, that it's already appeared on film, albeit more briefly, in the brilliant comedic 24 Hour Party People.  The film's appeal will be the attention put on Curtis as opposed to Joy Division as a whole.  This is where the movie takes on a life of its own.  Corbijn attends to such details as Curtis's lowly job in an unemployment office and continuous interactions with Curtis's wife, Deborah.  Corbijn's gift as a photographer pours over on these scenes as he takes time with each scene, allowing the viewer to really absorb not only the immediacy of what is seen on each scene, but the internal emotion that is felt as well.  This is the power of Corbijn at work.

None of camera's magic would work, however, if it weren't for the brilliant performances and the intentionally spare script.  The cast is led by Sam Riley, who has the uneasy task of stepping into Ian Curtis' shoes.  He gets it all down to Ian's hypnotic performances on stage.  Samantha Morton also packs a punch as the distraught performer's wife.

The script is fairly direct and familiar. The pictures speak for themselves.  There are no long monologues or quick witted lines of texts in the film.  A lot of the drama is delivered by the camera.  Corbijn, a man known for minimalism, is powerful as director in creating a portrait of one of the most iconic figures of the post punk scene.  While Corbijn's photos often allow us to spend a moment with someone through his use of minimalism and candid photography, Control feels like we just spent our lives with Ian Curtis.",1212537600,2,2545,4.654708520179372
3280816,5,B00104AYGU,"Thankfully, a film about Joy Division and the continuing myth of its frontman, Ian Curtis, landed in the right hands.  Only someone close to the band could have pulled off this masterful film, encapsulating not only Ian Curtis but the entire feel of a miserable place like late 70's Manchester, England.

At the opening whirling, eerie sound of Exercise One, I was hooked for a lifetime.  Sadly, Joy Division was the basis of too many ""goth"" bands that followed who never seemed to understand their punk roots.  This movie, I hope and pray, will cast a dark light onto that presumption and dispel it once and for all.  Joy Division were a tough band in a tough time.

Anton Corbijn made a solid choice to shoot this film in black and white.  Joy Division were a black and white band.  Stark, bleak, beautiful; beyond or beneath the confusion of color.  Marrying too soon, becoming too big and finding himself profoundly overwhelmed, Ian Curtis understood more about failed relationships and the futility of existence by 23 than most people will know in a lifetime.  He lived a black and white life.  Hope vs. despondency.

In retrospect, the album Closer was one he could never survive.  That album is a blueprint for a funeral.  Yet never wallowing in self-pity, he crafted painfully honest lyrics that drive into the heart of depression.  Upon seeing this film, years after reading the book Touching From A Distance, it became even clearer that his suicide was a viable option for him.  His depression was severe, a US tour was the next day, his guilt about being a poor father and his two tenuous relationships were all approaching the boiling point.  As in all suicides, the pain of continuing on eclipsed the fear of the dying.  What was he to do?  Quit and go back to working at the employment office?  No.  That was a fate worse than death.

Like the book, Control does a good job of portraying Ian Curtis not wholly as a victim of his diseases.  He was not the nicest guy yet you find yourself empathetic of his ordeals.  Where having a child will often transform a father, the birth of his child sent him further into despair.  For that, he could not forgive himself.  He was not merely ashamed of his behavior but, as he wrote in the song Isolation - ""I'm ashamed of the person I am.""  The grave was already shoveled; it was only a matter of time before he stepped in.

I would recommend knowing and enjoying the music of Joy Division before seeing the film.  It is a great film but (possibly?) one that is best taken in context.  As a fan, it's fascinating to see their rise from nothing into massive.  And the toll it took on everyone.  It was a long wait for a great film about Ian Curtis and Joy Division and I can soundly declare, I'm glad I lived long enough to see it.",1212537600,3,2785,4.508
3280817,5,B00104AYGU,"Ever since Ian Curtis, lead singer of the British band Joy Division, died in 1980, he has achieved the iconic status of an emerging artist showing signs of brilliance before meeting an early, tragic end. In Curtis' case, he committed suicide on the eve of his band's first American tour. His brief life has already been depicted on film in Michael Winterbottom's fast `n' loose look at the Manchester music scene of the 1970s and 1980s,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24-Hour-Party-People/dp/B00007BK2N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24 Hour Party People</a>, but it was only for the first half of that film.

He not only directed the video for their song, ""Atmosphere,"" but also shot some of the most memorable photographs of the band, making him the ideal choice to helm this film.

There is an audio commentary by director Anton Corbijn. With his thick accent, he's a little hard to follow at times but manages to cover the usual topics: casting choices, shooting on location, and so on. He praises the performances of Sam Riley and Samantha Morton while also pointing out technical details, like how the concert scenes where shot with hand-held cameras and everything else was done with steadicams. This track is a little on the dull side but Corbijn does impart interesting factoids and it was clearly a labour of love for him.

""The Making of Control"" takes a look at how the film came together. Corbijn moved to England because of Joy Division and took iconic photos of the band. So, he had an emotional connection to the material. His black and white photos influenced his decision to shoot the film in a similar style. The actors who played the members of Joy Division talk about the challenge of playing people who are still alive, learning to play musical instruments, and the songs. This is an excellent featurette filled with loads of interesting information.

""In Control: A Conversation with Anton Corbijn"" tends to repeat some of the information from the commentary track and the making of featurette. The director talks about how he discovered Joy Division's music and how he eventually met them. He touches upon how they shot in Ian's hometown for authenticity.

""Extended Live Concert Performances from the Film"" allows you to see ""Transmission"", ""Leaders of Men"", and ""Candidate"" in their entirety.

In a nice touch, there are the videos for ""Transmission,"" a powerful rendition done for live TV with a riveting performance by Ian, Corbijn's video for ""Atmosphere"" that is haunting as it was done after Ian's death, and The Killers' cover of ""Shadowplay"" which is surprisingly effective.

Also included is a ""Still Gallery"" with photographs from the film.

Finally, there are ""Promotional Materials,"" trailers for the film, a blurb for Deborah's book about Ian, the soundtrack, and so on.",1212364800,41,3202,5.495934959349594
