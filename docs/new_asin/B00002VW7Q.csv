There is no ""..Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear, etc.""  The announcer isn't at the end either, so obviously this is not for the serious collector. Even the serial is an edited version.  It does not mean this DVD is without merit: it is better than nothing.  But if you can wait or already have these on tape, save the money.  Oh, for the day when real pristene copies, unedited, will be available.  Question: why do people who don't really care about the Lone Ranger, make these things anyway?",974937600,14,566,4.554455445544554
