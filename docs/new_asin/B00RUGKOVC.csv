6935659,5,B00RUGKOVC,"This movie should have been named ""The Price of War""  It shows the cost to the men and women who are there.  It is a steep cost.",1429401600,5,128,3.7037037037037037
6935660,5,B00RUGKOVC,Wow.  Hangin there till the end,1428969600,2,31,4.166666666666667
6935661,4,B00RUGKOVC,"""An act of war"" is the story of a veteran of the military that - after knowing the atrocities of war - comes back home, but unfortunately he cant  lead a normal life because of the post-traumatic stress. Violence and loneliness will continue to haunt him despite he attempts to adapt to normal.
It is a realistic view of what happens to many soldiers returning from war, of what remains after the honors and prestige: they cannot return to live as ordinary people, because they will bring back for ever the memory and the trauma of having fought and  having seen the deaths of their comrades.",1428364800,4,592,4.5754716981132075
6935662,5,B00RUGKOVC,"An absolutely brilliant film. Superb acting by all the players, but especially Russ Russo as Jacob in the lead role and supprted by a raw and powerful Natasha Alam as Ivana and an incredibly humanistic, nuanced and engaging performance by Doug E Doug. I can't recommend this film more!",1428105600,7,285,4.836734693877551
6935663,5,B00RUGKOVC,If you have had friends and family who have served in the military then you owe it to them to see this film.  An Act of War truly understands what its like to come home to a nation that has already forgotten about you.  It's a fascinating tale from start to finish that will leave you with questions that our society truly doesn't have answers to.  If you're tired of the same old Hollywood Blockbusters and you want a film with an awesome look that really makes you think.  Than go no further.,1427932800,8,494,4.279569892473118
6935664,5,B00RUGKOVC,Ending was definitely unexpected...,1427932800,6,35,8.0
6935665,5,B00RUGKOVC,"Amazing movie -
what a suspense thriller :) So very well directed and can't wait to see more movies by this Director - Ryan Kennedy.",1427932800,7,132,4.32
6935666,5,B00RUGKOVC,"Incredibly thought provoking if you are willing to give it 90 minutes of your time. A very unpopular subject matter, but a story that needs to be told none the less.  Was sucked in by the trailer and poster, but was pleasantly surprised when it ended up being so much more than I expected.",1427846400,6,289,4.351851851851852
6935667,5,B00RUGKOVC,not exactly what I expected but wow.... I will not forget this film!,1427846400,7,68,4.3076923076923075
8695921,5,B00RUGKOVC,"One of the best movies I've seen within last 10 years. What you see/read  on the box is not what you see on the screen. This is not a Hollywood ""big flames"" production or ""me too"" war movie. Stunning visuals, great acting and script. Not for everyone - after 10min you'll either love it or hate it...",1476403200,,300,4.2631578947368425
8695922,4,B00RUGKOVC,Tortured US Army POW Vet(Russ Russo)returns home from the Middle East.  Instead of experiencing elation he manifests himself with the wrongs of society and copes his own demented way.  Excellent performances by the ensemble cast.  Black and white photography adds to the gloomy noir atmosphere.  I didn't see the twisted end coming.,1443744000,,332,5.326923076923077
8695923,4,B00RUGKOVC,Great story line.,1440720000,,17,5.0
8695924,1,B00RUGKOVC,"This movie was so bad and traumatizing, I suspect myself of having ptsd as a result of the viewing experience.",1438732800,,110,4.55
8695925,4,B00RUGKOVC,Good movie,1437782400,2,10,4.5
8695926,5,B00RUGKOVC,"With the confect down sizing overseas, the peace we know is going to be a lot different for some then others, and it going to take long for them to fine that peace.",1437523200,2,164,4.0
8695927,1,B00RUGKOVC,"If you respect film, you won't read the moronic reviews that say ""you will be cool"" if you view this amateurish, colorized piece of school-project which is poorly acted and completely disappointing given the blurb which promises rage against the auspices of social injustice and numbing consumerism.",1432252800,,299,5.382978723404255
8695928,5,B00RUGKOVC,"not for the faint of heart, but it's definitely one of the single most important films I have ever seen.

there's no pretense here, no pseudo-intellectual affectation; it's simply one of the most important and revealing films documenting the stark realities of our post 9-11 world.",1431475200,2,281,5.108695652173913
8695929,1,B00RUGKOVC,"Disclaimer: Didn't watch this movie, just the preview, and that was enough!
Basically, this is a remake of the movie ""Taxi Driver"" made back in the 1970's by Martin Scorsese.
Just updated to current times, but with the same message: All combat veterans are ticking time bombs, Tim McVeigh's, and social misfits incapable of re-integrating back into civil society.
Once again, thanks Hollywood, for another kick in the groin.",1431216000,2,424,5.159420289855072
8695930,1,B00RUGKOVC,"Rough to watch. Could have been a documentary, without all the crass visual vileness.",1430265600,,85,5.142857142857143
