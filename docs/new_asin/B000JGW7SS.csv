8150370,1,B000JGW7SS,I purchased this cd but the quality was very bad.  You couldn't really hear it.  I would have returned it but they say it can not be returned.  Don't waste your time purchasing this cd.,1195603200,4,185,4.228571428571429
8150371,3,B000JGW7SS,"I liked the idea of a DVD based tutorial. However, while  this guide does a reasonable job explaining general concepts of digital SLRs and the basics of the a100.  It does a poor job explaining the specifics of the a100.  A lot of times I had difficulty following along with the demonstrations because they do not explain the nuances of the menu system. I had to have the manual in one hand and the camera in the other, when trying to follow the demonstrations. In at least one instance when the presenter was explaining how to use the camera in Manual Mode ""M"", his camera was obviously set to Program Mode ""P"". I guess I'll try one of the printed guides.",1169164800,23,656,4.404958677685951
