627216,4,6303257720,"After a ship hits a reef and goes down near the atomic testing area, the worst is feared, but four surviving sailors are rescued, healthy and with no trace of radiation at all!
This leads to an expedition to Infant Island, part of East Biru, and it's led by the Rolithican, Clark Nelson, a slimy, unsavory character with his face twisted in a sneer.  Japanese members of the expedition include Dr. Harada, the linguist and ethnologist Dr. Chujo, and a reporter named Vin Chun, nicknamed the Bulldog because he never lets go of a story.  They discover a pair of foot-high grown girls and decide to leave them in peace.  However, the greedy Nelson kidnaps them for his personal gain.  This leads to Mothra awakened to rescue them.  Despite entreaties by Chujo, Vin Chun, and his colleague Michi, Nelson refuses to let them go and puts them to work in The Secret Fairies Show, which plays to packed houses.
Compared to others in the Toho monsters canon, the production values are more topnotch than later entries, in regards to the brass band and the crowd seeing the expedition ship off, as well as the scenes of destruction.  However, there are some shots where it's clear that some of the tanks are toys, as the soldiers on them are clearly plastic soldiers, and there is a scene when Nelson seizes the twins and it's clear he's holding dummies in his hand.  The moth version of Mothra is a visual triumph, with its colourful markings.  A pity that for the majority of the movie, we only see a dingy brown caterpillar smashing up Tokyo.
But the charm of this movie clearly go to the twin fairies, played by the Peanuts, those twin Japanese pop singers of the 1960's, Yumi and Emi Ito.  They spend the majority of the movie chanting for Mothra, wearing kitschy costumes, and just overall being cute.
It's also clear that the Rolithicans are based on Americans.  The syllables and stresses on them are identical, but the existence of New Kirk City confirms it.  Another sobering thing is the Rolithican promising to help Japan, and it's with their atomic heat ray.  Typical!  Always with weapons and not diplomacy!
Two major actors come out here.  One is Takashi Shimura, best known as the lead samurai in The Seven Samurai.  He's the editor of Nitto Shimbun (Nitto Newspaper) here.  The other is comedian Franky Sakai (Vin Chun), who later appeared in the Shogun miniseries.  His personable smile, comical scenes, and spunky attitude makes him a standout character here.
I'm going by the American dubbing here, but the chubby Shinji, who is about twelve or thirteen, is Dr. Chujo's brother.  Now, Chujo is a man in his early forties, more the age of Shinji's father, and he acts like Shinji's father in one scene.  Dubbing goof?
One of the better Toho monster movies which is the debut of Mothra and the twin fairies.  However, the moral of the avarice of one leading to widespread mayhem at the cost of innocent people puts this a notch above others in the series.",1068940800,7,2964,4.685328185328185
627217,4,6303257720,"The original Mothra is an interesting movie.  It relies on human drama much more than the average kaiju movie that I've seen, but still manages to keep up the monster action enough to keep your attention.  Unfortunately, the monster action isn't very exciting.  After smashing a dam and a building or two, the catapillar spins a cocoon around Tokyo tower, only to be ""fried"" by a new military weapon.  But, after it hatches into a giant moth, the kaiju destruction really looks like nothing more than a hurricane documentary.
However, if you are a kaiju enthusiast like me, you'll love the movie for what it is and not so much what it has to offer in monster destruction.  But, if your looking for a cheep monster flick, you may enjoy this, but you may not.  This movie is really based on personal preference.",1045785600,5,809,4.6223776223776225
627218,5,6303257720,"OH YES, THE MOVIE IS A CLASSIC. IT WON A GOLDEN GLOBE AWARD FOR BEST MOVIE. THE FILM IS LISTED ONE OF THE TOP 10 BEST MOVIES EVER. GODZILLA NEVER MADE IT.

627219,4,6303257720,"A giant moth flips its lid and attacks Japan.  If Walt Disney ventured into the realm of Japanese sci-fi, this movie could have been the result.  Chuckle-headed, camp humor is evident, but another wacky monster fest is not the director's real purpose.  The emphasis is on a juvenile fantasy story that features ""The Peanuts,"" petite female fairies.  Tinkerbell's cousins. Twins, no less.  (If this was a fantasy film of another kind, the mathematical possibilities would be endless).  The Peanuts serve as high priestesses to Mothra, a primitive deity.  Their haunting rendition of Mothra's theme song holds a special place in the Japanese sci-fi hall of fame.  When ruthless men kidnap the girls, Mothra follows them to Japan.  Mothra first appears as a giant caterpillar that scoots across the countryside like an electric train.  The most thrilling part of this epic is the attack on Tokyo.  In the midst of the fiery destruction, the caterpillar attaches itself to Tokyo Tower, and spins a huge cocoon.  Atomic heat ray machines fail to destroy the cocoon, and a giant moth emerges.  The wind from Mothra's flapping wings gives off typhoon type wind.  Buildings crumble, fire rages, and vehicles whip around like toys.  Of course, the cars and trucks really are toys, but don't get technical.  The military fights back with tanks, rockets, and planes, but to no effect.  Considering the lousy track record of the Japanese military in these monster epics, the government of Japan might want to re-think its military resources.  The special effects reflect the limitations of the budget and the era.  Don't expect computer-generated razzle-dazzle.  Suspend disbelief and go with the flow.  Good for kids under seven and hard core Japanese sci-fi fans. ;-)",1026172800,6,1757,5.116197183098592
627220,4,6303257720,"Mothra has always represented the divine side of monsters. Worshipped as a deity, it acts only from self-preservation and to protect its worshippers.
A giant egg is discovered on a little Japanese coastal town. The inhabitants build a sideshow around it, trying to capitalize on its oddity. Unknown to anyone, the egg belongs to Mothra. When its servants tries to recover the egg, they are imprisoned. THey summon Mothra who arrives at the same time at Godzilla. During the battle Mothra dies only to be replaced by its offspring, 2 caterpillars who spins a silken web to capture Godzilla.
Mothra represents the Japanese's love and fear of nature. The 90s remake is more technical but not better.",1020384000,3,696,4.957264957264957
627221,5,6303257720,"Benjamin (four years old) can sing the Mothra song.  It's quite charming in his tiny voice, ""Moothooryaah, Yah, Moothooryaaaah . . "".  It doesn't matter that he doesn't speak Japanese.  He's remembered it phonetically.  He's always been a big fan of the denisens of Infant Island and the two little fairies who watch over it.  I have to admit though that his attention does tend to drift during the mid part of the film.  He's just not interested in the bad guys, I think mostly because they talk too much.  We have an interesting conversation though about the main bad guy's ""smerk"".  He didn't really quite understand what it ment.",981590400,3,633,4.6909090909090905

627421,5,6303257720,mothra has to be just as well known as godzilla and kong. a giant moth summoned by the singing of two little fairy people that goes on a rampage until the two little ladies are returned home. when you think about it it shares some similarities with the story of kong. except instead of cannibals its two fairies and instead of a giant ape its a giant moth with a sonic blast. ok so not very similar but none the less its a fantastic movie. though corny by todays standards it still holds as one of Japans great movies and will live on weather you watch the reboot with the new godzilla or the original mothra classic.,1497052800,,617,4.282051282051282

Apart from her guest appearences in Godzilla movies, the fantastic being that is monster/goddess Mothra becomes manifest in this Tauburaya FX tour de force! The movie is entertaining & well acted. A must see!
Fortunately, two more movies are included, as well
'Battle in Outer Space' and 'The H-Man' (aka 'Beauty and the Liquid People'). 'Battle in Outer Space' is a pseudo-sequel to 'The Mysterians', where Earth's new planetary defense force is pitted against the fiendish Natal. Amazing and new  Tauburaya techniqes for urban carnage are introduced! Definitely a worthy successor to my beloved 'Mysterians'.
'The H Man' aka 'Beauty & the Liquid People' is a Police Drama confused by sci-fi crimes, as well as a super hot nightclub singer, Chikako Arai. Drug dealers, Cops, the underworld... are forced to deal with a scientist's conclusion that the source of all their problems is the gelatinous, highly radioactive, crew of a fishing boat that strayed into the waters of the Bikini H-Bomb tests.
The acting is great, the effects are totally new & original from Tsuburaya, and the freighter's nighttime discovery of a ghost ship are not to be missed!

better then the ""Americanized"" version I grew up with.

the abandoned ship.

The picture quality is great! I have never seen these movies look so good.

Battle in space is pretty silly. I loved the phoney looking effects, esp with the explosions and bodies flying
up in the air was so funny I couldn't stop laughing.

The H-man was a really hair raiser in the day, though I think it ended up becoming the clear super putty we used to get back when I was a kid. The idea though that the deadly radioactive rays were mutating the human race into a slime jelly capable of eating anything, while harking back to the blob (who came out around the same time) is really quite forward thinking in many ways.

628242,5,6303257720,"From the golden age of Toho comes, Mothra, Battle in Outer Space, and The H-man.

The H-Man 1958: Police officers and thugs battle blob-like creatures spawned from H-Bombs.

The H-man was one of Toho's mutant movies like Matango (1963). By 1958 standards the effects are spectacular. The film has great acting, cinematography, great writing, great dialogue, great effects, and fantastic score.
English Dub: 4/5 stars
Original Jap. Version: 5/5 stars
English run time: 79 min.
Japanese run time: 87 min.
Special Features: Previews and commentary

Fun Facts: Known in Japan as Beauty and Liquid Men. Scored by Masaru Sato.

Battle in Outer Space 1959: Aliens start terrorizing Earth. So in retaliation, the military heads into space to battle the menace.

Battle in Outer Space was one of Toho's alien invader movies like The Mysterians and The War in Space. The special effects are ahead of there time for 1959 and look amazing. As for the aliens themselves, they aren't very interesting. While it does entertain other viewers or fans of Toho may find the film uninteresting.
English Dub: 3/5 stars
Orig. Jap. Vrsion: 4/5 stars
English run time: 90 min.
Japanese run time: 90 min.
Special Features: commentary
Great acting, good dialogue, good writing, dazzling effects, good cinematography, and great score.

Fun Facts: In the original story, the Natal were originally tentacled creatures, and in later drafts, insectoids with their own lunar tanks shaped like pill bugs, but these designs were dropped due to the lack of technology to make such creatures look realistic. The lunar tank conflict was changed into a saucer attack, as the Earth men make their way back to the SPIP landing site. The exterior shots of the ""Science Center"" was actually Japan's National Olympic Stadium (Tokyo) that was built in 1958 for the upcoming Tokyo Olympiad. At the time, the structure was newly completed and had a slightly futuristic look. Released in Japan as The Great Space War. Originally going to be a sequel to The Mysterians, Battle in Outer Space has no connection to The Mysterians. Other than returning human characters.

Mothra 1961: An expedition to an island turns deadly, when the researches steal 2 fairies, and kill a native tribe. In prayer the remaining native(s) call upon Mothra their god to rescue the fairies and avenge the tribe.

Mothra would go on to not only star in the Godzilla series, but also her own movie series in the 90s, Rebirth of Mothra 1-3. The first half after the island is a tad dull, but once Mothra heads for Tokyo, things get interesting.
English Dub: 4/5 stars.
Orig. Jap. Vers.: 5/5 stars
English Run time: 100 min.
Japanese Run time: 100 min.
Special Features: None
Great dialogue, good writing, good cinematography, great acting, fantastic score, and amazing effects.

Fun Facts: Mothra was an gigantic puppet. Based on the novel The Luminous Fairies and Mothra, this adaptation was penned by Shinichi Sekizawa. Another draft proposal was submitted shortly after, re-titled Giant Monster Mothra. A drawing was made before Mothra's final look. The drawing had Mothra look more frightening, but it was scrapped.

Unfortunately the dvd case is horribly designed, with the 3 discs stacked on top of each other. This design  causes the discs to be damaged rather quickly, so I'd suggest getting a better designed case. Which thank goodness, I ad a spare on hand.

My favorites from this set would have to be Mothra and The H-man. I liked Battle in Outer Space, but I much prefer the other two.

However Sony's rights to The H-Man and Batlle in Outer Space have expired, so now this dvd is going out of print. Get it before the price gets expensive.",1384128000,9,3680,4.954545454545454

As for the movies--Mothra is the most adorable critter of the Toho kaiju set, cute and destructive. The villain, named Nelson in the English version,is sneeringly amoral, while the heroes are sweet, and charmingly heroic. A last minute attempt to saddle the heroes with annoying kid sidekicks that get captured is handled with brevity and cuts back on irritation, leaving room for why we like kaiju films--BIG Monsters ripping up Japan!
The H-Man is an attempt at a horror movie, that, at the time, was probably frightening--centered on mutated men who turn people to liquid by touch, all in the middle of organized crime---very dramatic.
Battle in Outer Space is a sequel to The Mysterians and is a classic style invasion tale, done in Toho style--it is the middle of a trilogy, finishing with Gorath, but neither of these films are necessary to enjoy Battle.",1371168000,2,1133,5.0588235294117645

They make comments like ""Honda never wanted to fire his weapon and when he did he shot it in the air.""  ""Honda was a pacifist.""  ""Honda was antiwar""  While these statements may be true there is also the possibility they are false.  My opinion is that any person who served in the Imperial Japanese Army in the occupation of China is suspect of war crimes.  23 million ethnic Chinese were killed in the IJA's occupation of China-killed and tortured in barbarous inhuman ways.  To think that Honda had no part of these atrocities after two tours in China leaves me incredulous. Especially when Hirohito himself issued the Three Alls policy.  It is possible that Honda was a pacifist and antiwar later in life, but a more logical explanation for this is that he felt guilty for all the horrendous murders and tortures he committed while a member of the IJA.",1362182400,,1147,4.7

This set contains three Toho classics:

Battle in Outer Space is about how the Earth unites to fight off the threat of an alien invasion.  Rocket ships versus UFOs.  Very entertaining.

The H-Man is like the Japanese version of The Blob where a gangster gets mutated by radiation and proceeds to absorb people.  It's the darkest and slowest of the three.

Mothra is the first movie the monster Mothra appeared in before starring in various Godzilla films.  This is the story of how two magical fairies that speak for Mothra on Beru Island are kidnapped and Mothra goes to rescue them.  Very cheesy but very fun.

One thing I noticed is that the English versions of these films have the voice actors talking in a fake-sounding Asian accent, so that's one thing I didn't like cause to me it came off as a bit racist.  They could have hired a Japanese voice actor (who knows, maybe some of them were)  or just talked in American accents like they do in later Toho movies.  Just something to point out.  Each film also possesses it's original Japanese version.

I am NOT reviewing the DVD. Just the movies unless otherwise stated.

Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.

1. The H-Man:

H-Man from H-Bomb has connections with casHman resulting in Triple HHH!!!!!

Anywho, this movie is the basic Toho Monster Movie, with one exception. Dogora has this problem to, it doesn't focus enough on the monster. However, this is okay in here because the plot is all tied in with the monster thus it is sorta like a suspense mystery thriller sci-fi horror of the 50's. Speaking of the 50's, both this and the Blob came out in the same year and personally, I like this guy better. He's faster, and not just one form. He's also in REAL color and not fake color. But if your looking for a Toho monster movie, I believe this shall satisfy. It's all you want, just not anything extra.

I'm still sick so forgive me for not talking about the movie in depth other than that.

The Rating? 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288/5

2. Battle in Outer Space:

It's 50's (well almost 60's) Japanese Sci-Fi, this time, about Aliens trying to take over the world. It feels like Godzilla, Star Trek, Star Wars, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and an Alien documentary all rolled into one with plenty of awesome real effects and cheese to go around. The climax(s) are extremely fun, and all the characters are eccentric just like most. We don't actually get to see the aliens, which is a downfall, but there is defiantly plenty of Earth vs. The Flying Saucers to make you drunk. But, you already know what I think about classic Sci-Fi, I grew up with this pure awesomeness! So check out this and heck, every single monster movie/alien invaders film you can find.

The Rating? 3.9/5

3. Mothra:

Based off a book...I BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT!

Ah, the days before CGI. Absoulutely awesome.

First thing is, this is not real blockbuster entertainment, it's popcorn entertainment, and isn't it god dang good! I love it. First thing that really strikes me, is all the great messages in here. Mothra actually means ""Mother"" in another language, you would think Japanese but this movie was made in Japan so...who knows? Which makes me think that the humans are...well...humans. But this is a made up country, not Japan or US, but it certainly symbolizes US, with all the greed and religious corruption featured in the villains. They even mention a place called ""New Kirk City"" (Or as I like to call it ""New James Tiberius Kirk City.) The fairies are the animals and ghosts of holly souls, calling out to Mothra Nature. Mother Nature. Mother Nature then comes to destroy the places only to rescue the souls that have been taken away by cruel villains. It is Toho's way of saying ""THE EARTH WILL KILL US BECAUSE WE HAVE KILLED THE EARTH."" In a way that won't get them sued. And, heck, they're right. (Not saying 2012 or anything, but the end is coming soon.) (2012 was an awesome movie.)

For those of you who have no patience, the story goes like this. There is some news team that finds an island, that seems inhabitable because of radiation, but there are people on there. They go there, and they're seem to be a valley of trees and other plants. They find these inch tall grown women ""fairies"" and capture them for the entertainment buisness. The fairies use telepathy to contact Mothra, who goes on a wild rampage across the city. Wonderful carnage...awesome. She then makes a cocoon on the Tokyo Tower and then the army tries to destroy her with radiation. But she's obviously immune to radiation because she lives on a radiated island. The good guys take down the corrupt business men, and take the fairies to the top of a church building, ring the bells and paint a cross with the sun in front of it to attract Mothra. Like all Japanese Monster Movies, makes no sense whatsoever.

But, that's whats so great. Movies today spend to much time on explanations, and well I admit an acid trip is not my first choice, a history lesson isn't my first choice either!!! So, all in all, I love these movies, and everyone should to.

628602,2,6303257720,"I first bought Classic media's DVD releases of the various Godzilla films and I was pleased that after years of neglect these movies were finally getting the release they deserved.  Sadly as time went on Classic media seemed to care less and less about these releases.  Compare this DVD to say their release of the original Gojira.  That one had two discs, one for the original Japanese release and one for the edited US version.  Each disc had nice moving menus and great special features.  Fast forward to this release and we have....well...this release.

First of all it has three movies each on it's own disc but they're all stacked on top of each other, they could have at least put dividers in for the disc like they do with various ""TV series X:  The Complete X Season"" release.  Secondly there's no artwork on the disc, the only way to tell the movies apart is by the titles written on the discs.  Finally the special features are....two audio commentaries, that's it.  No posters, no slideshows, no trailers, nothing.  It feels like this was put out only to cash in on Toho's kaiju genre (I admit, I only bought this one for ""Mothra"", I'd never even heard of the other films on this disc).  It really feels like Classic media is saying, ""You got the films in their original Japanese, what more do you want?!""  While I'm glad just to have Mothra on DVD I do feel like a bit disappointed.

628644,4,6303257720,"BATTLE IN OUTER SPACE:
This release of Battle in Outer Space is part of Columbia Pictures' Toho Collection three-pack that also features The H-Man  and Mothra, all of which were originally released domestically by Columbia in the late 50s/early 60s. The DVD includes both the U.S. and Japanese versions of the film, along with commentary by Ed Godziszewski and Steve Ryfle. The prints for both U.S. and Japanese versions are fairly good, if not excellent. The packaging, unfortunately, is severely lacking, with the discs all being crammed into one side of a single-width case. To remedy this, I just put the discs in separate cases and fixed them up with reproductions of the original Japanese one-sheets.

If Battle in Outer Space is not a direct sequel to The Mysterians (Chikiyu Boeigun, 1957), it certainly shares common characters and characteristics. It's unclear whether Dr. Adachi, played by Koreya Senda, and Etsuko, played by Kyoko Anzai, are intended to be the same characters from The Mysterians (played by Takashi Shimura and Momoko Kochi, respectively), but Dr. Immelman, played by Harold Conway in both films, is obviously meant to be the same individual. More as a result of budget limitations than creative intent, the alien spaceships are slightly modified holdovers from the former film, and the same sound effects are used while they are in flight.

Whereas The Mysterians built slowly, setting up a grim, brooding atmosphere before introducing the giant robot Mogera and then progressing to a massive artillery/aerial battle, Battle in Outer Space opens with an alien attack on a space station, immediately followed by several other violent assaults on the earth. The film moves at a fairly brisk pace for the duration, with two Earth rockets, called the SPIPs, making a journey to the moon to combat invaders from the planet Natal, concluding with a major battle as the Natalians make a desperate final attempt to conquer Earth.

Though technically not a daikaiju film, Battle in Outer Space features many of the trappings that would eventually come to permeate the Godzilla series--invading space aliens, high-tech spaceships and aircraft engaged in spectacular battles, and the graphic destruction of major miniature cities. Eiji Tsuburaya's special effects certainly take a front seat in this film, mostly involving battles between spacecraft. The effects work succeeds to varying degrees, with the best taking place on the surface of the moon. The design of the SPIP rockets is typical of those from the 50s and 60s--tapering, needle-like fuselages with large base fins--and they appear quite convincing, especially during launches and landings. For the most part, the lunar surface miniatures and sets work exceedingly well, and the ground cars used by the SPIP astronauts appear functional; cuts between miniatures and full-size mock-ups are oftentimes flawless.

While anything resembling respect for the laws of physics might be rare in outer space movies--whether then or now--Battle in Outer Space makes only a few token nods to the concepts of weightlessness, effects of acceleration in gravity, et. al., and these are particularly odd at that. Most of the time, under said weightless conditions, the characters carry on as if they're in normal Earth gravity, except that--from time to time--one of them might rise unexpectedly in the air and then joke ""he forgot."" And one line, uttered quite ironically, is ""Doesn't this weightless feeling feel odd?"" even as the characters are hoofing through the spaceship's corridor as if they're on a sidewalk in downtown Tokyo.

Because the story is so fast-paced and plot-driven, none of the characters are very well-drawn or memorable, though Yoshio Tsuchiya plays a fairly tragic character who succumbs to the Natalians' mind control--the kind of role for which he came to be well-known in numerous Toho films, such as Dr. Otani in Destroy All Monsters and Masafumi Kasai in Matango. The romance between handsome leading actor Ryo Ikebe and Kyoko Anzai is understated--almost to the point of superfluousness--but further development would needlessly slow the pace of the picture.

Most fans of Toho science fiction films tend to rate Battle in Outer Space as inferior to The Mytserians--as do I--but also find it exciting and engaging. Despite the packaging, which hardly does justice to these DVDs, a decent presenation of both the Japanese and U.S. versions of the film--with very perceptive commentary by Messrs. Godziszewski and Ryfle--is a most welcome thing.

MOTHRA:
Mothra has always been one of my least favorite of Toho's giant monsters. It's a bug; depending on its incarnation, either an unremarkable, big honking caterpillar or a terribly unreal-looking giant moth. Yet Mothra has also starred in some of Toho's best Showa-era epics, from the original Mothra to Mothra vs. Godzilla (1963). Later incarnations of the critter, such as those in Godzilla - Mothra - King Ghidorah: All-Out Monster Attack and Godzilla: Tokyo SOS have been outright impressive. Go figure. Of course, then there was the 1992 Godzilla vs. Mothra. Eh. Not so much.

After the dark, somber moods set in Godzilla, Godzilla Raids Again, and Rodan, the Flying Monster, all of which were based on the disturbing premise of science gone too far, Toho opted to produce a friendlier, fantasy-based daikaiju movie. Mothra introduces a giant monster who wreaks havoc but is essentially gentle, driven to destruction only because of its loyalty to the benevolent Shobijin (which means ""little beauties""): a pair of one-foot-tall young women from the radiation-blasted Infant Island, who are exploited by a greedy entrepreneur named Clark Nelson. In his zeal to make money, Nelson abducts the Shobijin and forces them to perform in an exotic nightclub act in Tokyo. However, unknown to him, the Shobijin are using their performances to telepathically summon Mothra to their rescue, and when the big bug eventually does appear, Eiji Tsuburaya and his special effects crew get a chance to more than go to town.

Of course, it wouldn't be a Toho monster movie without spectacular scenes of miniature city destruction, and on this count Mothra definitely delivers, especially during its rampage in larval form. Several different larva puppets of various sizes were constructed, as well as a suit (only of the caterpillar's fore section) worn by actor Haruo Nakajima, which allowed for the use of very large-scale, super-realistic miniatures. Unlike in some later appearances, in this movie, the larva's movements appear very natural and lifelike, and the mottled tan and brown skin texture looks far more realistic than most of the subsequent puppets', which were a more uniform, glossy brown.

The adult ""imago"" Mothra doesn't fare nearly as well. For scenes of the flying Mothra's assault on Newkirk City, the capital of the fictional nation of Rolisica, the miniatures are smaller and less detailed, resulting in a far less satisfying look. Much like Rodan, Mothra is able to generate typhoon-force winds with its wings, but most of the shots of miniatures whirling around like paper confetti leave more than a little to be desired.

The musical score is provided not by either of Toho's most frequent composers--Akira Ifukube and Masaru Sato--but by Yuji Koseki, who scored relatively few films but provided a distinctive and exotic musical backdrop for Mothra. Koseki wrote the song that the Shobijin use to summon their guardian, but it was later re-orchestrated by Akira Ifukube for use in subsequent films, such as Mothra vs. Godzilla and Ghidrah, the Three-Headed Monster.

Although little good can be said about Sony's packaging job (see comments in the Battle in Outer Space review), the DVD presents generally fine prints of both the U.S. and Japanese versions of the film. During the film's initial release in 1962, Columbia inexplicably trimmed a considerable amount of footage from the film, including some impressive special effects scenes--presumably just to shorten its running time. Unless one has a serious aversion to subtitles, there's not much point in watching the (reasonably well-dubbed) U.S. version except to listen to the insightful commentary by Steve Ryfle and Ed Godziszewski. Despite the poor packaging, this set is a good value for any kaiju eiga fan on this side of the water.

THE H-MAN:
At long last, Toho's 1958 foray into the more horrific side of science-fiction, The H-Man, is now available on DVD, as part of the Columbia Toho Collection package that also features Battle in Outer Space  and Mothra.  The story is openly based on the 1954 Lucky Dragon incident--oftentimes referred to as the third nuking of Japan--when a Japanese fishing boat strayed into waters contaminated by nuclear fallout, resulting in the crew succumbing to radiation sickness. The H-Man goes a step further, in that the radiated crew members are transformed into green, blob-like entities who prey on other humans by dissolving and consuming their bodies. Their ship drifts into Tokyo harbor and the H-men (short for ""hydrogen-bomb men"") escape into the city and are soon making a grim and gooshy mess of things.

Noted Toho regular actor Kenji Sahara plays Dr. Masada, an up-and-coming nuclear physicist who deduces the origin of the H-men but has a tough time selling it to skeptical police investigator Tominaga (Akihiko Hirata). Yumi Shirakawa plays nightclub singer Chikaku Arai, the girlfriend of gangster Misaki (Hisaya Ito), who the police believe is in hiding--though in reality, he has been dissolved by the H-men. Masada, understanding what has actually happened to Misaki, becomes involved with Chikaku, but she is abducted by a rival gangster who, like the police, believes she is actually hiding Misaki. At the climax, the H-men intervene in their own gruesome way; Masada rescues Chikaku; and the authorities, in their efforts to purge Tokyo of the slimy, radioactive invaders, leave a large portion of the city's harbor district enveloped in flames.

With its grim atmosphere and suspenseful plot, The H-Man succeeds as a horror thriller, while retaining plenty of the trappings of standard, 1950s-vintage science-fiction melodramas. The early scenes aboard the abandoned, radiated ocean vessel are outright creepy, and Eiji Tsuburaya's unique special effects bring the mutated humans to life in very convincing fashion. The ""dissolving"" scenes were accomplished via life-size balloons created to resemble the actors, which were rapidly deflated, filmed at high speed, and optically enhanced, so that when replayed at normal speed, the illusion is of a human being dissolving into an oozing blob.

Composer Masaru Sato offers an enjoyable, somewhat frenetic orchestral score, occasionally accompanied by staccato, pinging percussion that adds an unsettling mood to the visuals. In the U.S. version, the opening theme is edited to accompany an abbreviated credit sequence, but thankfully is otherwise left intact, unlike too many other Japanese imports from this period.

The prints of both the Japanese and U.S. versions of the film are very good, though the American version is edited somewhat. Stick with the Japanese to get the fullest, best viewing experience.",1267315200,19,11246,5.275572945779765

The discs are stacked right atop each other with nothing between them, and they are very bare-bones offerings: the original films with English subtitles and the Anmerican-International releases. It is good to see just how the original films differed from the afternoon TV versions I saw, but the former two series of releases included trailers, documentaries, and some very entertaining commentaries by Toho/Godzilla fans of considerable knowledge.

628647,4,6303257720,"to a time when men were men and science fiction movie fans would walk ten miles barefoot (shoes were expensive in those days) to catch a glimpse of special effects on the cinema screen. Here, on the cusp of the 60's, three movies from director Inishiro Honda and special effects maestro Eiji Tsburaya. When American sf movies were timid little black and white affairs, the Japanese were producing these lavish full colour widescreen masterpieces.

Okay, maybe 'masterpieces' isn't quite the right word. Let's have a closer look at them.

I've wanted to see 'The H-Man' ever since a kid at school snuck into see it (Certificate X: no-one under 16 allowed) and gleefully regaled me with tales of its wonders. The reality is a little less wonderful but not without a fair amount of fun. Basically it's a gangster turned into radioactive slime (think the Blob on a small scale) turning his enemies into similar such and absorbing them leaving behind all the clothes and such.

'Battle in Outer Space' does pretty much what it says as long as you are okay with outer space being the Moon and the Earth-Moon orbit. It's fine by me. Aliens (never actually seen except once and they're in spacesuits) attack the earth with flying saucers, space torpedoes, and a mother-ship. Earth unites to fight back and sends a couple of space ships to the Moon where the aliens have made their base. Then the aliens attack Earth full on. Trust me, this is full of special effects because of the numerous battles, space and moon sequences. Ah, in the old days we never noticed all those wires holding up the space craft and flying saucers, being too much in awe of the spectacle in front of us. Sure it's naive and clumsy compared to today's equivalents but it has a charm they lack.

And, finally, Mothra, in her first appearance. Here we have the answer to the oft asked question: what happens when the bad guys kidnap two teeny-tiny singing twins from a radioactive island? Answer: the inhabitants raise a hacky great monster to destroy Tokyo in a rescue attempt. The bad guy is from a country with a long-winded made-up name but where the inhabitants speak English and drive on freeways. I'll leave it to you to work out the not-very subtle allusion. Oh, okay, just one hint: which country was still occupying Japan at the time the movie was made? If you love giant monster movies then you must see Mothra or hand in your giant monster movie lover card.

All three are available in edited English-language versions and the full Japanese originals. Two have commentaries. Order yours now before they're all gone.",1256083200,7,2593,4.727876106194691

628652,3,6303257720,"""Icons of Sci-Fi: Toho Collection"" contains three feature films from the Japanese studio Toho, which put itself on the fantasy film map with its phenomenally successful ""Godzilla"" in 1954 (released in the United States in 1956). The films in this collection are all in color and in the Widescreen format.
 In ""H-Man"" (1958), the Tokyo sewer system is an oozing mess after radioactive liquid turns people into slimy blobs that float down the drains following a rainstorm and begin to reproduce.
  ""Battle in Outer Space"" (1959) depicts a series of mysterious catastrophes that sweep the world, causing scientists to conclude that Earth is under invasion from another planet.  Two Earth space ships strike a serious blow against the attackers, giving the world time to prepare for the inevitable battle in outer space.
 ""Mothra"" (1961) is one of Japan's giant monster flicks.  Members of a Japanese expedition to a radioactive island find two tiny, beautiful girls and take them home for observation.  After the girls are taken off the island, a mysterious egg hatches, producing a gigantic moth which destroys everything in its path as it searches for the girls.",1251244800,4,1161,5.111111111111111

better. (They are housing the individual discs in paper sleeves which are held in place by the case.) However,
I would not consider this a deal-breaker...you have to expect some concessions at this bargain price.
If the packaging bothers you THAT much, don't be lame: just buy new cases and make labels on your computer!

Bottom line is that you get three individual DVDs of genuine Toho classics for a bargain price. Each disc
features USA and Japanese versions in wonderful Tohoscope. No trailers, unfortunately, but two films feature
audio commentary by acknowledged kaiju scholars. Video quality seems fine to me, and comparable to Sony's
great releases of the Godzilla titles. Really, there is not much to dislike here.

I won't bother describing the three films included, except to say that they are all fan favorites that were
long overdue for a DVD release. If you are a fan of Toho's glory days, don't even think about it: just buy it.",1251158400,5,1055,4.759562841530054

628742,4,6303257720,"This DVD contains Mothra, H-Man and Battle in Outer Space - This DVD has both Japanese and English language versions of the movies & are widescreen transfers. I expected these to be clean & crisp letterboxed actually - in Tohoscope & that is what they are.
All 3 of these movies were made by the people who brought us Godzilla such as Ishiro Honda and Eiji Tsuburaya and music by Akira Ifukube.
MOTHRA (1961) would be the main attraction starring Jerry Ito and the 1 inch Peanuts as they were called. Mothra rescues them after being kidnapped by gangsters. A magnificent movie done with style and taste.
BATTLE IN OUTER SPACE is a loose follow up to The Mysterians minus any monsters but it is a spectacular effects and an endless array of laser ray light show with rocket ships, UFOs and other space crafts. Great special effects during its day.
The H-MAN was the one I watched first since I hadn't seen this in ages..it is relatively short (under 90 minutes) and it basically about a person who becomes an H-Man (hydrogen man) as a result of hydrogen bomb testing - the h-man is a greenish blob that eats other people turning them into oozing blob monsters which also appear in a 'ghost' like form. I watched the English language version and the transfer is nice, and the film is ok,basically it is a lesser title, but still fun to watch. Great effects by Eiji Tsuburaya and lots of lovely Japanese ladies. More or less a Japanese version of the Blob..
All 3 were on VHS in full frame versions and were somewhat obscure. Now we can get them all in letterboxed transfers and see them how they were originally meant to be seen.
The DVD packaging for this is terrible. 3 discs with each movie stacked ON TOP of each other like a layered cake or pancakes. This is an easy way to damage the DVD's.",1242950400,79,1794,4.472560975609756
628743,5,6303257720,"A few years ago I got a chance to see the three films included in this set at the Castro Theater in San Francisco.  While I enjoyed ""Mothra"" and ""H-Man"" I have to confess I got up and walked out on ""Battle In Outer Space (something I don't normally do).

All three films were directed by Toho Studio's legendary kaiju director Ishiro Honda and when I saw them projected on the big screen at the Castro they looked almost like they had been shot the year before.  I don't know the source prints used for this DVD but I hope they are they ones used when I saw them in San Francisco.

Mothra (1961) needs little introduction to monster fans and is the best film in this set.  Survivors of a shipwreck on a radioactive island miraculously survive radiation effects by eating and drinking the juice of a berry endemic to the island.  They also find a pair of twin fairies and when a ruthless businessman wants to exploit them he brings down the wrath of Mothra upon Tokyo.  Great special effects (for the time), appealing characters and story make this a very family friendly and very entertaining giant monster flick.  Of the three films I saw at the festival this one looked the best.  The vibrant colors and the amazing Tohoscope cinematography fairly sparkled and almost leaped off the screen.  Either Toho had done some restoration or they had access to a very well preserved print.  I might also add that the line to get into see this one at the theater wrapped around the block and consisted of lots of parents with kids and I was very pleased to see that kids brought up on the CGI films of today were able to buy into the fantasy of this film and were having a ball watching ""Mothra"".  BTW, once you hear the surprisingly poetic song the fairy twins sing to summon Mothra you will never be able to get it out of your head!

The H-Man (1958) was a real surprise for me.  Frankly I didn't know what to expect and was very pleased to experience this atmospheric sci-fi thriller from Toho.  Most fans are accustomed to the studios giant monster extravaganzas but this one takes an entirely different tack with its low key storytelling.  The plot involves (oddly enough) a crime story interwoven with the sci-fi monster story line.  Tokyo police are investigating the disappearance of a narcotics dealer only to learn that his vanishing act as well as those by other people is in fact the work of some kind of radioactive blob creature.  It tends to get talky and drags a bit but I have to tell you that there are some really creepy scenes in this film and it is well worth your time to watch it.

Battle In Outer Space (1959) supposedly influenced George Lucas' Star Wars films.  All I can say is if George found this flick about aliens invading earth entertaining then he is welcomed to it.  Maybe it gets better later in the film but I can't say because I have to admit I got up and left before the half way mark.  There were endless scenes of space ships doing...well very little actually and the things they are doing takes forever!!  I know this film is held in high regard by some and perhaps I should give it another chance but I still have to stick to my initial opinion that this film was deadly dull.

Anyway, this is a highly anticipated release for Toho sci-fi fans and I only hope that Sony gives the films their due with quality prints.  The very reasonable price should make this a no brainer purchase for all 50's monster movie enthusiasts.  Heck, its worth it for Mothra alone!

UPDATE: (June 12, 2009) From the web site Digital Monster Island comes this news: ""Both the complete Japanese and U.S. release versions of The H-Man and Mothra will be included.

*Different storyline from Rodan
*Same effects from TOHO
*A new monster

Cons:

*Geared for kids not adults
*Not as dark
*Mothra not as menacing as Godzilla

Another monster movie by Toho directed by Ishiro Honda. I've always found Mothra to be probably the weakest monster of the TOHO franchise. It's not menacing, it's powers are somewhat limited and it's slow.

Watching this I could tell it was geared more for a kids audience (the usual complaint given to some Godzilla movies). The storyline is altered to make Mothra the ""good monster"" which I think took away something from the message. Also I found it hilarious that despite the destruction Mothra unleashes everyone waves to the monster at the end!!!

Godzilla, Rodan, never got any such praise so why Mothra? Anyhow, Mothra's rage is brought his two protectors who are kidnapped as a sideshow act for some corrupt Japanese man named Nelson.

It is cool though to see Mothra's transformation from a giant caterpillar to his true form of a Moth. The natives who worship Mothra remind me of the natives who worshiped King Kong.

In the dubbed versions the girls are called ""Ailenas"" and they of course have the interesting power of communicating to Mothra. Of course like Rodan and to keep the series alive there is more than one Mothra.

For me while it does have the same TOHO formula as the other monster it doesn't quite leave the lasting impression as Godzilla or The War of the Gargantuas which is that intensity for the monster to kill.  Likewise, as stated Mothra just doesn't come out as menacing as Godzilla, Rodan, King Ghidora etc. However,for the TOHO collector Mothra/Mosura is a must have. Word is there will be a two disc coming soon so it will be great for people who love these TOHO to see these movies on DVD.",1222905600,3,1809,4.732484076433121

The reason that it is different is because the title monster, is not out to destroy Tokyo for revenge. The only reason the creature destroys is because its small foot-tall maidens.

The film has great acting by some of the most recognizeable actors of Toho. The special effects for the film are, likewise, good as it was back in the 1960's. Mothra, both in her larva and imago form, is very well executed and well designed. From its patterns on its wings to her rampage in New Kirk City, the giant moth gives us a great show.

628805,3,6303257720,"Mothra was the 3rd major monster from Toho studios and though she (and her kin) have appeared in many a Godzilla film, she also has a strong fan following and her own series (in the 90's).

This film finds reporters annoyed because they are barred from a scientific expedition to a small island in a nuclear testing zone.  A chubby newsman soon takes center stage as he infiltrates the expedition.  They find an island filled with strange plants and stranger natives, the most unusual of which is a pair of tiny women.  The greedy expedition leader kidnaps the women even though the rest of the party protests.  The little women are exploited in a sort of freak show/broadway combination kind of a thing (It is here that the tiny women sing the famous Mothra song).  Fortuanately, the chubby reporter, his girlfriend and a couple of others befriend the little ladies, who turn out also to be telepaths.  They warn their new friends that Mothra is coming to rescue them but that many innocents may die when she comes.  Thus begins a desperates struggle to return the women to Mothra and also to destroy Mothra.  The evil guy who kidnapped the small women kidnapps them again and escapes into a small town.  Meanwhile, Mothra has gone into her cacoon stage, and the military believes that they have killed her.  Mothra emerges in her moth form, but before she can cause much destruction, the tiny women are rescued, the baddie shot and Mothra placated.

This is a fairly good film unitl somewhere around the mid-point when the characters are more or less forgotten and begin just going through the motions.  Close to the end, it takes a turn for the worst as Mothra is attracted by church bells and an altered symbol of the cross of Christ.

Mothra has some fine acting performances (for this type of film) and includes some real scenes of supense (rushing to save a baby on a bridge about to collapse from rushing waters comes to mind).  It is surprisingly exciting to see Mothra in action without having to compete with Godzilla, Ghidorah or Rodan.  She is a frightening monster and one of the few monsters in film history actually on a mission.  She is an unstoppable juggernaut, first at sea (some effective scenes there, building up the dread of her arrival...kind of like the fear of an approaching doomsday), then in the air, gently flying about, unnoticing the military efforts to stop her.

The villain is entertainingly unlikable, so when he is shot, one might very well cheer!  The chubby reporter is all at once annoying and likable.  His girl friend is underutilized, however.  The tiny women almost overstay their welcome but thankfully, do not.

All in all, Mothra is a head above the likes of Rodan, though never rises above a 3 star rating often in it's running.  Also, it suffers from too many dance numbers.  It is recommended viewing before Godzilla vs Mothra.",1109894400,4,2878,4.721442885771543

7843941,5,6303257720,"That is correct don't bring your date, because they say that a Mothra is attracted by a flame. Maybe that is why those two pint-sized cuties got Mothra to go to Tokyo. Oh, all right it was telepathy. Mothra unlike some other monsters we know will worm her way into your heart. Anyway Tokyo is always trying to defend its self with military solutions. Some claim that Mothra was ""Shot in Tohoscope"" However they never came near her Tohoscope. Did anyone think of surrounding the island with giant mothballs?

Mothra meets the standard Japanese Sci-Fi formula of having the standard good guys and bad guys and dumb guys and an environmental theme.

Personally I thing Mothra was lucky that Rodan ""Rodan - Dubbed in English ASIN: 6302658888""did not catch her in the larva state. You know what they say about the early bird.

Two things to keep in mind. This is not the last of Mothra and the soundtrack is for sale.",1504569600,2,912,4.617283950617284
