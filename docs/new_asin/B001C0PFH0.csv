8285570,3,B001C0PFH0,"Copycat (Andy Hurst, 2008)

Copycat starts, at least, from an interesting premise, one that I see rarely (but is probably used a lot more than I realize)a serial killer, instead of developing his own methodology, takes a page (this idiom is not used lightly here, as you will soon see) from the work of famous serial killers before him, and each of his kills is set in a scene staged to re-enact the famous work of his forefathers; the only clue this killer leaves that differs is a page from his diary relating to the killer whose work he is parroting. It's a great idea, and I imagine that, done well, and with a whole lot of research and interviewing of profilers and the like, someone could take this premise and do a bang-up job with it. Andy Hurst (Wild Things 2), or, more appropriately, screenwriter Ellis Walker (Grim Reaper), don't take it anywhere near its logical conclusion; instead, they use it as a hook into what is, ultimately, a generic murder mystery, with harried police detective (Hall Pass' Chloe Snyder) chasing diabolically evil killer (The Skeleton Key's Andreas Beckett). On the other hand, generic is an awful lot better than horrible. Copycat is a movie that you will likely have forgotten a week after watching it, but it is far form the worst movie I watched that month. It's not even the worst movie I watched that day (that dishonor goes to Desi Scarpone's horrifying Dark Town, which landed on my hundred-worst list). One to watch if you're bored on a Friday night and have nothing better to do. ** ",1396828800,,1532,4.649446494464945
8285571,1,B001C0PFH0,"I rated this a 1 because I couldn't go any lower!  If you are into porn, gore, and incoherent dialog with no plot, this is the movie for you.  I turned it off after about 26 minutes.  I thought it might be related to the ""Copycat"" movie with Sigourney Weaver, but this movie has nothing to do with anything worth watching. Very disappointing, very pointless, a total waste of money.",1355356800,3,382,4.428571428571429
8285572,4,B001C0PFH0,"Basically, the movie has little to no plot of a female detective hunting down a typical ""crazy serial killer"" (who does not even copycat the killers mentioned!), however! the one thing that saved this movie for me was the story-within-a story mini-bios, which show fictionalized murders from ""The Nightstalker"" Richard Ramirez, ""Cannibal"" Jeff Dahmer & the real life ""Leatherface"" & ""Norman Bates"" Ed Gein, pretty entertaining for true crime buffs, just get it for that.",1322265600,2,470,5.28
8285573,3,B001C0PFH0,"This is not the Hollywood version.  While the ""popular"" version has its moments of drama and a lot of suspense; this movie depicts the killer at his truest sense.  (Or killers?)  A gory but well-written and adequately acted adaptation of the same title.  Certainly worth watching again.",1264809600,3,286,5.0212765957446805
