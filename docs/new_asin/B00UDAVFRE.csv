7036216,4,B00UDAVFRE,"This is the first ""found footage"" movie I've come across that doesn't actual use found footage?!  Sound strange?  Well, the movie is played out through a Flashlight.  It's movie of a POV from INSIDE the flashlight, actually.  If that makes sense?  Either way, the movie accomplishes this quite well, in my opinion.

This film follows 5 teens that head for the local ""haunted"" area known as the Covington Forest.  It's here they decide to play a game they refer to as ""Nightlight"" (even though it's just 'Hide-N-Seek' to everyone else).  Nia, Chris, Ben, and Amelia are part of the ""it"" crowd and they decide to ask Robin to come along as some sort of sympathy for her friend, Ethan's, recent suicide.  Wanting to be a part of the popular kids, she agrees and at the same time decides it'll be a good chance to possibly delve more into Ethan's death since it was at Covington Forest where he met his demise.  All seems like a good time until mysterious things start to happen and they quickly realize the Forest won't let them leave.

I'm a ""found footage"" junkie (if you've read any of my reviews you'll definitely know).  For some reason, I just am fascinated by the genre and 9 out of 10 times I love the movies.  This movie is no exception.  I thoroughly enjoyed this one as well.  My only real problem with them, and again, this one has the SAME problem, they never seem to be able to create a decent ending.  It almost always seems more of an afterthought.  Regardless, the movie doesn't waste time getting started.  I never really looked at the clock to see how much time was left either.  All in all, I enjoyed watching it.

Final Verdict:  Worth a watch, but has it's typical flaws.",1427500800,7,1690,4.511551155115511

7036223,3,B00UDAVFRE,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

As most of you know who read me regularly I am not a fan of found footage films. The reason is that the majority of them are made this way for two reasons: because its cheap or because the film maker is lazy. While it was a novel idea when this genre first began its become so overused as to make a film like this unwatchable. On occasion a good one slips in but its rare. This movie is one of those.

Five friends go off to a remote woods to spend the night and to play a game. They head to a preserve that is supposed to be haunted and regularly attracts young people who choose the location to commit suicide. A friend of one of the girls going there for her first time recently did just that. But the group goes anyway with the intention of playing a game they do on a normal basis.

The game is called nightlight and consist of one person being blindfolded while the rest head off to hide. After counting so long that person goes off to find the others. Its an old game with a new twist in that everyone has their own flashlight or something to use as one. Our heroine uses a cell phone with a light on it while at the same time apparently recording everything thats going on as well. The most amazing things about that is that the phone never seems to lose a charge. Id love to know what model it is so I can get one like it next time I upgrade mine.

As the night progresses strange things begin to happen. One of the girls goes missing to be found later on in a trance like state having no clue where shes been or the passage of time since she first went out of it. Various members of the teens disappear only to show up later. All of them end up terrified that theyll never find their way back to their car or survive the night alive. With good reason too as there are times the cell phone camera picks up on images of demon like creatures slightly off camera of out of focus making their way among the group when someone hits that trance stage.

The movie offers a few suspenseful moments and has an ending that I thought worked quite well. But as I started out here, the found footage aspect of it doesnt hurt but doesnt help either. While the movie can be interesting at times and by the end has held our interest, it also doesnt make you want to watch it over and over again or make sure that your friends don't miss it. The jump scares featured here feel predictable rather than surprising. The jerk characters seem readily apparent. A few plot twists are nice and make the movie worth watching in the end.

While not the greatest thing since sliced bread the movie is an entertaining film that will more than likely hold your interests throughout. While its not the greatest horror film ever made it is far from the worst. It makes a good nights rental but not one to add to the collection.",1443484800,,2861,4.202185792349726

7036234,1,B00UDAVFRE,"So, this movie is shot from the perspective of a flashlight - not one but many as they are held by different people. The problem with this concept is that when the flashlight is being carried by a person, or at times dropped to the floor, all you see are legs and bums! Now, if you have a fetish for movies that show mostly legs and bums, this is the movie for you!!!! But, if you are a normal human being, this movie is not really for you! If it had a good story line or at least one that you could understand, then it might have been in with a chance for 2 stars, but alas, twas not to be! Since half the action is happening to people that are BEHIND the flashlight, you cannot see what is happening - but in this case that might be a good thing because the few bits of acting that you do see are absolutely terrible! Occasionally you see glimpses of something that looks like a person wearing a grey table cloth (or a leftover extra from the X-Files) but there are no real baddies in this movie, nor are there any goodies - just a few silly teenagers pretending to be afraid!

However, there is one star in this movie who really stands out -THE DOG and it has really got this acting thing down right! Stare at camera - then position head at correct angle to get fantastic spooky glare of light in eyes - wait until camera moves or person shouts something - then run away really fast! Perfect  acting every time!

Perfect movie for bums and legs freaks - otherwise totally useless!",1438473600,,1483,4.214788732394366

7036238,4,B00UDAVFRE,"I'll cut straight to the point, much like the film, and say it stands heads and shoulders above any of the FF movies in memory, at the moment. There have been so very many, since the granddaddy of the bunch, a film I truly respect. What surprised me most here is how it got right to the point. I am so used to watching these and not getting to the crux of the film, you know, the scary part, until the last 5 minutes. When shortly after it began, a guy got... well, don't want to spoil it...., I thought I had fallen into a reverie for a moment and missed something. So I went back. Nope. It just didn't hesitate in being what its supposed to be: horror, thriller. The next surprise was the excellent filmography and camerawork. The film has a definite aesthetic. Its downright beautiful, in a midnight in the forest sort of way. The images allowed into the frame, to the ones that got snuck in in the corner, well... very impressive artfulness. The use of the flashlight as POV, with the impression of an iris that it gives, a brilliant touch. The palpable dread, mystery, occult vibe was both subtle and overpowering. Very effective. The acting was competent. The dialogue was far less stupid than most of these types of films, where the bickering and blahblahblah grate. I guess that's because they got straight to the point. The dialogue, except for the narration by the one guy shortly before hell breaks loose (which was the only major poetic piece of dialogue).was utilitarian. But at least it had heart, which was poignantly evident when the girl started talking to Ethan. Good work there, girl. It didn't drag the movie down at all (the dialogue I mean). The plot/story was a little thin but since the movie is more of a sensory impression, that is forgivable. I'd like to see this team do something like this but also develop the story more. Like for instance, if the way each of the characters had met their fate as symbolic and tied in to a larger theme the story was ultimately about, it could have been even more amazing, and would've gotten the final fifth star from me. But horror junkies, ya gotta see this! I haven't seen anything approaching this quality in so long, I thought this one would be half the film it was.",1435017600,,2235,4.493857493857494

Pure unadulterated cheesy, cheap crap. Blair Witch was one of the worst movies ever and I have no idea why anyone and there seem to be many, emulate this premise.

7036244,5,B00UDAVFRE,"* I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

If youve never trekked around in the woods at night with just a flashlight to guide you, then you are truly missing out on one of lifes simple but effective thrills.  Ive lived the majority of my life in the rural south, and Ive been surrounded by wooded areas for as long as I can remember.  As a kid, my friends and I would play a game called Midnight Hide-and-seek, which is very similar to the premise behind NIGHTLIGHT.  As such, I can totally relate to the terror that a darkened forest can bring about.  NIGHTLIGHT does an excellent job of fleshing out these mind-twisting nightmares.  The film is a heck of a horror flick, and every fan of the genre will want to give it a look.

After I finished the movie, I dug around on the Internet to see what other folks thought about it.  To my surprise, many of the reviews I found were negative.  Most viewers thought it was too gimmicky, and they didn't enjoy the point-of-view in which it was shot.  Others thought it just didn't make it sense.  I have to wonder if they watched the same film I did?  I love this film, and I plan on watching it again soon.

NIGHTLIGHT is shot well, however it is not your traditional found-footage style film.  Instead, the entire movie is shot from the perspective of the main characters flashlight.  Yes, you read that correctly.  We get to see things unfold as if a GoPro Camera had been stuck to Robins flashlight.  The result is a clever and extremely effective POV that puts the viewer right into the thick of the intensity.  This is especially noteworthy when the scares are involved.  I will not divulge any of them, however I will confess I had to pause the movie and rewind it a couple of times to enjoy a couple of particular scenes over and over.

The acting is great, with the whole cast giving memorable (albeit stereotypical) performances.  The main character, Robin, is played by Shelby Young, who fans of Anchor Bays THE MIDNIGHT GAME will remember as Rose.  Young once again gives an enjoyable portrayal, this time as the uncool kid trying to hang out with the popular group.  The rest of the cast is top notch as well, but I have to give a particular shout out to Chloe Bridges who plays the uppity bitch, Nia.  Bridges would have fit right in with the cast of HEATHERS, and I commend her for her acting skills.

The special effects in NIGHTLIGHT are very nice, and I especially enjoy the creature costumes.  Im not giving anything away by mentioning them, but they are not what you would expect from a movie like this.  They are beyond effective in raising the fright level of the flick, and I love how they are integrated into the film.

NIGHTLIGHT is a huge win for me, and I highly recommend it.  This is not a rehashed version of BLAIR WITCH, nor is it your typical teens-in-the-woods scenario.  It is a taut thriller full of jump-scares that will keep you on the edge of your sanity.  The film is available now in a variety of formats, but try to watch it in surround-sound if you canthe ambient noises that surround you make a huge impact in the effectiveness of the frights.  Give this film a chance, for sure.",1432857600,2,3198,4.432246998284734

7036261,1,B00UDAVFRE,"Dull horror movie about five friends who venture eagerly into supposedly haunted woods where people go to commit suicide to play scary flashlight games.  One of the girls is pretty but socially awkward and too eager to be liked and the others plan to play a mean prank on her but things quickly become more serious and grim.

Nightlife is shot from the point of view of the unpopular girl's flashlight--there's an explanation for that eventually but it's still a terrible film-making choice.  In the scenes where she is walking through the woods alone, terrified, we are deprived the actual sight of the terrified character and get to look at tree branches and shrubbery instead.  In scenes where she is walking behind another female character we mostly see the back of that other character so if she's smiling or terrified it doesn't really matter because from behind she looks the same either way.

After a while it turns out that Nightlight actually has a larger story to tell but no good ideas for how to tell it--even ignoring the fact that we spend way too much of the movie listening to people's voices without seeing anything of interest the link between the opening scene, the flashlight and the violent occurrences in the woods are never as clear as they should be--does the spirit want to kill everyone or just the chick with the flashlight?  Are there malevolent spirits besides than the one the heroine assumes is responsible for everything?

Nightlight would have been improved greatly by using a more conventional shooting style that actually allowed the audience to see actors faces more often but the jumbled storytelling would still be a problem--it's hard to tell for sure if the filmmakers know what's going on in their own movie or if they even think it matters.

If you want to watch a horror flick where most of what you see are trees and shrubs and rocks and things and sometimes the backs of peoples heads then Nightlight is for you.  But as vengeful spirit movies go Nightlight is so muddled I'm not even sure it's actually a vengeful spirit movie.",1428105600,3,2074,4.754874651810585

7036263,3,B00UDAVFRE,"Parts were genuinely unsettling and shocking--I'm not one to whine about the occasional ""boo!"" scare in a horror movie. The actors were all very appealing and did credit to their roles. It had an overarching storyline that worked reasonably well to set up the shenanigans. But the central conceit--that we are seeing everything from a flashlight's-eye view, so to speak, could sometimes seem ridiculous, and by the end had worn a little thin. The idea of only seeing the part of the creepy forest illuminated by that single flashlight beam for much of the movie was inspired, but probably should have been used more sparingly rather than as an extended gimmick. Certainly this is passable entertainment, suitable for a Halloween marathon that might include ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""The Bay""--but it stops short of being as great as it might have been with a little more flexibility and a little less rigid weddedness to a single device.",1428019200,4,942,4.968354430379747

The kids play their games, tell stories about the woods, scare Robin and then....

This is another hand held camera film that is not technically a hand held camera. Instead they gimmick the idea and show the film through the viewpoint of various flashlights which gives us the same irritating effect as a hand held camera: kids screaming in the dark, camera shaking while we can't see what is going on, lots of footage of the ground.

I liked the basic plot idea of a haunted forest with demons, spirits, mad dogs, and bats. I was impressed as this was the first horror film that I recall that used the word ""precipice."" As far as entertainment, the film didn't deliver. You didn't see much horror. The jerking motion designed to create horror and confusion is dead. It doesn't do it. It is time for film makers to move on if that is all they got. Special effects consisted of fake blood and flashlights turning on and off. The only time I got creeped out was when my light burned out while watching the film.

Train scene might lead to bad imitation behavior.

8705445,1,B00UDAVFRE,"Even after reading the description, the description to this movie sounded possibly like either the Blair Witch Project, The Forest, or possibly something else.  The description didn't go into all that much about the movie.  Well upon watching this complete train wreck of a horror movie I found that not only isn't there that much to know about the plot, but this steals too heavily from Blair Witch and it's in many ways too much like The Forest only this movie came out a year earlier and it doesn't take place in Japan.

All of that being said, it focuses on these attractive yet dull and one-dimensional young teens going to this forest that just like that forest in Japan shown in both the movies The Forest and the drama movie The Sea of Trees, is repped for people entering it to commit suicide while evil spirits are roaming around that area.  Other than one of them probably being there to pay some last respects to a fellow student that she was mean to, it was neither clear why her four friends were there with her, nor was it especially clear what the rules and objectives of their NIghtlight game were.

All that I can say is this movie is a colossal crashing bore the way that the characters are all flat and dull, the plot amounted to hardly anything, there are no jokes, there's no real nudity, no sex scenes, no quotable or even memorable lines, barely any gore, too many off camera kills leaving you the viewer with no concept as to what's happening to the victims, in one scene for no clear rhyme or reason they put a coat over the camera lense.  As none of these kids seem to have a clear personal or scholastic reason for recording what's going on, it's entirely unclear as to why they are walking around with cameras.  Also, why it is that unlike Blair Witch they don't even bring any attention to the fact that they are going to be carrying cameras around is also very vague.

To make matters worse, not only is who or what is killing them never cleared up exactly, but they really milk that whole person falling and the camera falling to the side with them idea ala Blair Witch one time too many.

They did everything they possibly could to rip-off Blair Witch including having the remaining characters go to an abandoned, run down, dilapidated, old house(in this case an old church) that was in the middle of the forest to look for their missing friends.  Sound familiar?

Overall, this movie is not worth the film that it was made from.  It could have been its own thing one way or another, but instead it just steals so much from The Blair Witch Project that everything that happens in this movie is both predictable and not at all scary or shocking in the least.  The only thing that's shocking about this unscary and completely boring turkey is that they tried to pass it off as original, clever, and creative.  It's none of those things at all!!  Don't even waste your time with this one.  0 stars out of 10!",1487980800,,2938,4.463551401869159
8705446,3,B00UDAVFRE,I gave this movie three stars because of the acting and production.  It started out slow but quickly picked up.  It was the last act that I didn't enjoy.  I was hoping for interesting spin but this just went the way of most horror films.  Which disappointed me.  I think most horror films are now in a rut that has become cliche and predictable.,1486598400,,345,4.328125

8705448,3,B00UDAVFRE,"Nightlight is yet another found footage horror.  Now as you might know if you've ever read my reviews, I have mixed feelings with the found footage genre.  Most of the time the writing feels completely wasted as it focuses on teenagers running around from nothing that we can see, and then extended periods of silence afterwards after one of the teens supposedly gets attacked.  We're supposed to feel traumatized by whatever it was that attacked the character.  Lame because it hardly ever works for me.  Unfortunately Nightlight is guilty of the same old tendencies, however this movie actually gets better.

Nightlight is better than most because even though the first 20 minutes is nothing more than teenagers goofing around at night in a forest graveyard and having fun (which is a trademark of many horror films, found footage or otherwise) at least in this case something much better occurs.  Of course a lot of this goofing around in based on the subject of sexual conversation.  This is to be expected when you have teenage girls and boys together.  The scene showing the girl opening the guys backpack and discovering condoms is overkill with the sexual stuff seriously!  And the guy exposing his butt while posing on a rock?  Eww!!

The teens decide to play a little game of ""You stay here alone with a cloth wrapped around your eyes so you can't see anything- we'll run away as you count to 100!""  At least they allowed the blind victim to have the dog nearby.  Of course you can probably guess what's going to happen- well actually the most predictable thing doesn't happen (that being the blind person getting attacked by the forest monster).  No, instead something happens to the *other* teens.  Upon removing the cloth, the one girl nervously walks around in the forest looking for her friends.  She sees all kinds of suspicious things along the way such as bloody rocks and dead animals.  If you have a fear of being alone in the woods -a fear I don't have- this stuff mght make you a nervous wreck and you'll appreciate it more than I do.

What's going on here (at least I *think* what's going on here- I don't think the movie ever said for sure) is that there's a demon or poltergeist walking through these woods.  It's exceptionally vicious whatever it is, capable of making these teens fall asleep and able to turn on lamp posts whenever it wants.  The demonic entity can also appear in the distance to create scariness and uncertainty for the teens, or under a light to create immedate fear.  Whichever one it wants!  At least this stuff is a notch above most found footage horrors that don't even attempt to show anything scary until the very end.

Eventually the one girl (Shelby Young I think it was, but perhaps it was Chloe Bridges) decides to enter a cave infested with bats and mysterious transparent images at the end of the tunnel.  What a really bad idea but I suppose she thought her friends were hiding in here.  And of course the batteries in her flashlight start to go out around this time.  Darn batteries!  Should've used Procells.  Upon leaving the cave she sees her female friend lying by a tree asleep with no way to explain what's making her so tired.  The males of the group don't experience nearly as many paranormal surprises so their story is much weaker than the girls.  I wouldn't even say Carter Jenkins or Mitchel Hewer are that great of actors either.  At least not in this movie.

The story occasionally drags as the teens talk about typical high school prom and dance stuff (and boyfriend/girlfriend stuff too of course) but to counter this, the teens sometimes drift to sleep unexpectedly allowing the other friends to come by and check on them.  So there *is* a decent story going on in Nightlight.  I definitely like this movie more than most found footage horrors, and perhaps for the first time ever, I'd even say there's enough suspense to actually recommend this found footage horror.  Yeah man!  I finally broke the invisible barrier of hatred  I had for years by never recommending a found footage horror until tonight, haha.  Basically if you're someone who thinks forests are scary Nightlight will be right up your alley for certain.  And if you like bloodshot eyes you'll love this one scene later.  Wow did that scare me prety good!

So yeah, decent storyline and acting, and occasionally venturing down nonsense/typical teen territory but only in the beginning before the scary demon creature causes a sufficient amount of horror for the viewers.  Otherwise this movie does a lot of things right.  I'm surprised!  My rating's in between a 3 and 3.5.",1467417600,,4616,4.7293233082706765
