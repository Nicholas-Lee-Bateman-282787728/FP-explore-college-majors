This is an awesome movie that is well played about fear and how it robs us and others of untold joy.",1498348800,3,183,3.972972972972973

7282141,5,B00ZGJ84AI,"I didn't purchase this movie through Amazon, but had come across it at the Christian book store and purchased it there. This was a fantastic movie, with a positive message appropriate for the whole family. My daughter especially enjoyed it and said it was her new favorite! We enjoy supporting  Christian movies, but sometimes (let's be honest) you may feel like you're ""tolerating"" it to support the cause... but this one's a good one. I thoroughly enjoyed it!!",1449878400,8,462,4.923076923076923

7282144,4,B00ZGJ84AI,"Inspirational and spiritually nurturing, the lyrics are very good and would not be surprised if some professional talent do covers of many of the songs written here in the near future. Cinematographically could have been a little better; the continuity lacks the seamlessly of the blockbusters, the lighting and photography are, at times, something to be desired.
But the film has fire and it's highly motivational, that is something  that many of the big studio films haven't got and its shortcomings can be outgrown by its director who, this time, can add a feather to his hat. A Perfect Chord is a plausible and delightful movie.",1502150400,2,632,4.962264150943396
7282145,4,B00ZGJ84AI,"The acting was so-so, but I enjoyed the plot. It was really cute and safe for the kids aswell. I ove how it has a Christian base to.",1502064000,,132,3.75
7282146,5,B00ZGJ84AI,"Legitimate, appropriate entertainment. Don't worry about it not having an MPAA rating, that's just something that costs the producers extra money. This would be great for youth group viewings, provided you can obtain a public performance license. I was so impressed with this movie that I bought the ""A Perfect Chord"" single from the soundtrack and 3 copies of the DVD. I also looked up the film studio and it looks like a promising outlet for a new generation of Christian productions.",1501113600,2,486,4.939024390243903
7282147,5,B00ZGJ84AI,This was an awesome movie. It inspired me to keep reaching for my dream and don't give into fear.,1501027200,,97,4.157894736842105
7282148,2,B00ZGJ84AI,"Very much liked that it was a Christian film with a message to give your best to the LORD. The music was also very good. However, the acting was HORRIBLE. The writing was also lacking. The film as it stands could have been reduced to 15 minutes with the same affect but not been as tortuously slow. Sorry as I really want to support Christian films. But, we must give our best to the LORD and the casting and directing were not anywhere near the best.",1500854400,,451,4.255813953488372

8720170,2,B00ZGJ84AI,"I really wanted to love this movie. I liked the message they were trying to convey and was hoping it'd be something our family could watch together. The acting is along the lines of high school drama club. They try really hard and they're almost there, but just can't make it look professional. Kinda like when you watch locally owned businesses film their own TV commercials. The message of faith is also lost somehow. If I hadn't read the synopsis to know what it was supposed to be about, It wasn't until almost the very end to notice any christian characteristics. It was really slow and dragged on and on. The rest of the family got bored watching, leaving me to finish alone.",1532131200,,681,4.544715447154472
8720171,5,B00ZGJ84AI,"What a great showcase of amazing music. The acting isn't the best, but it is good. The story is good and encouraging. I found myself laughing at many of the jokes through this movie. Very well done and worth watching and sharing with others.",1529712000,,241,4.5
8720172,2,B00ZGJ84AI,Too slow with too much long shots and no story.,1515715200,,47,3.8
8720173,2,B00ZGJ84AI,"The message was supposed to be uplifting, and to an extent it was, but the 'amazing talent' was nowhere to be heard.  The girls' voices were flat and feeble, and the instrumental accompaniment was nothing to get excited about.  They were barely listenable.  I guess we were supposed to pretend there was something special about hackneyed lyrics and thready, uncertain singing.  Malia Flack is very pleasing to look at.",1507161600,,418,5.0144927536231885
8720174,2,B00ZGJ84AI,"Less than 10 minutes into the film, I stopped it. The music could not overcome the inability of the majority of the actors to deliver the lines in a believable manner. It, to me, came across as amateurish. Too bad as the basic message - if I understand it - is positive and inspiring.",1505001600,,284,4.277777777777778
8720175,4,B00ZGJ84AI,"About a high school student who loves music and composes lyrics as well as playing the guitar.  Although she (Cadence) has a special talent and a beautiful voice, she only is able to sing or play for her best friend and refuses to display her gift before an audience, even for her parents.  The movie is about her severe phobia, and her loving parents and devoted friend's encouragement and her and their frustration to move on from on early childhood incident where she froze, had a panic attack and collapsed at a church talent show.  It takes all her courage, and a deep inner realization too that her struggle and her talent will help others to get her to even begin to try to to face her phobia.

The movie is fun, funny, and true to life.  I say this because I used to be a perfectionist and was afraid to perform, write, or share until I learned to accept my best effort even though it was not usually perfect and move on.  I had to learn to trust myself and love myself despite all my imperfections.  The reason I enjoyed this so much was that it showed how a loving and honest family and friends like that too let us see ourselves through the eyes of others who love, care for, and believe in us.  That viewpoint often ends up being more realistic and revealing than our own.

I also enjoyed ""A Perfect Chord"" because the story-line, acting, and character development of the main actors was excellent and a welcome relief from the negativity and hopelessness that often seems to surround us in current events and the discussions of today.  The movie provided wonderful examples of how we find our purpose, meaning, and joy in life and follow it.  Too many of us find it very difficult to find the mentoring and caring relationships we need. The struggle of Cadence to find herself is difficult to watch at times, but her struggle actually encourages her friends, family, and many other classmates to engage in that difficult, but often rewarding and life-changing struggle on their own.",1504742400,2,1995,4.575842696629214
8720176,5,B00ZGJ84AI,"This is an excellent, clean movie that has a very inspirational story about someone being afraid to do what they love. It reminds us to pursue our dreams and not to be scared or ashamed.",1504483200,,186,4.3428571428571425
8720177,2,B00ZGJ84AI,"Beware the thumping bible.  Acting was very cheesy too, especially the best friend.",1503187200,,83,5.384615384615385
8720178,5,B00ZGJ84AI,"What a delightful film! The two main characters are a breath of fresh air together - witty, funny, and slap-sticky humor along with an entertaining story line. Get the entire family together, make some popcorn, and be ready to have your heart warmed over and over!",1503100800,,264,4.760869565217392
