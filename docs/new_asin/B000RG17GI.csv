2866765,3,B000RG17GI,"I got this DVD about a year ago and was disappointed with the lack of detail given by Jill Kennedy.  I agree with another reviewer that Jill rushed through some of the techniques, and spent a little too much time on other, boring segments such as the wax painting (put me to sleep) and gutta techniques.  Also, I would have loved to see more of the beautiful finished scarves she had but she just barely lifted them up for a quick look at them and then quickly put them away--almost as if she didn't want to share her finished work, which I found a little stingy, considering the price of the DVD!  I agree that the DVD is overpriced for what you get.  All in all, I was disappointed, especially by the inability to view the finished scarves and the lack of even a short explanation of how she achieved the results!  I own quite a few silk painting books including one by the same author, and I did not learn any new techniques from this DVD other than what I already knew from my books!  I have yet to make even one of the projects she demonstrated.",1224892800,,1050,4.277777777777778
2866766,2,B000RG17GI,"I was disappointed with this DVD.  I did not find it as professional as I think it could have been.  The building in which this was filmed was undergoing construction and you could hear the pounding and banging in the background throughout the entire DVD, which was very distracting.  I feel that Jill rushed through the exercises and instructions and should have gone into much more detail.  I did find some new techniques that she briefly showed and I found that part helpful.  In my opinion this DVD should not sell for more than $12.95. I would like to have seen more of her beautiful finished work. You only get a peek in this and that was disappointing.",1217980800,5,659,4.5508474576271185
2866767,5,B000RG17GI,If you have invested in silk and pigment dyes you will want this dvd!  She covers all the technical details and also provides inspiration for creating your own designs. A great reference. I used the pause feature to try a technique and then resumed play for instructions for the next technique.  Very inspirational and a lot of fun.,1199491200,6,332,4.706896551724138

8200465,3,B000RG17GI,"Jill Kennedy is certainly a knowledgeable artist in her field but I could only give the DVD 3 stars. This is an informative DVD and she shared her knowledge on several of the different techniques that she prefers, but as one reviewer already said, the background construction noise was distracting. Plus it was poorly filmed. It looked like a basement setting with spot lights on her- making it difficult to get a good idea of many of the areas she was working on. She sort of glossed by silk paints, preferring silk dyes and that was disappointing to me. The biggest disappointment however was what was left out. There should have been more than the final 4 minutes of the DVD spent on how to heat set, steam, wash, dry clean, hem  or otherwise finish off a silk product. In fact someone could easily have a DVD out on finishing techniques alone. No one wants to have their dyes wash out and there are specific steps to take but none were included. Because the DVD was filmed in England, there were also a few products mentioned that I did not have a clue what they were! I gave the DVD 3 stars because although the areas she covered were covered well, there was just a lot left out and for the price tag, the poor quality and sound of the filming made it feel like a YouTube video.",1380844800,3,1283,4.390756302521009
8200466,1,B000RG17GI,"I could not hear what she was saying on the Demo. There was a few minutes of sound and then no sound at all. I tried increasing the volume, but it didn't help. Therefore I had no opportunity to find out if this product will aid me in my desire to paint on silk. I prefer to use demonstrations to learn new techniques. Learning is easier when you can watch someone actually doing what she is teaching. Please fix the Demo. Thanks, Benita",1360108800,,436,4.265060240963855
8200467,5,B000RG17GI,"Dyes are expensive, so it is necessary to have some instruction when starting silk painting.  Jill is a great introduction teacher.  All of the basic techniques are taught.  If you are advanced, then you should pass on this as it is too introductory.",1295654400,,250,4.767441860465116

8200469,5,B000RG17GI,"I loved this dvd!

MY PERSPECTIVE: I have an art/design background (did one gutta-style silk painting eons ago) and wanted to get an idea of what else is possible on silk. Jill Kennedy delivered!

PROS:
Regarding earlier reviews that there is not enough depth, I have to say that I don't think that is the intent here. It is a wonderful overview of many techniques. In 145 minutes, there is a lot of information on techniques and materials. Does it tell you everything you need to know? Probably not. But I think the idea is to show what is possible so you can start exploring on your own and experience. I feel that Jill gave enough info to enable me to jump right in and start creating. If I make some mistakes along the way (did I say ""if?"" I mean, ""when...""), that's part of the process.
  I had been alternating between investing in paints or dyes --was leaning towards the dyes for a couple of reasons--and this dvd definitely helped me make that choice. I was really glad that these techniques focused on dyes rather than paints.
  A complete list of sections/techniques printed on the packaging would have been nice, but there is a chapter directory on the dvd that makes it easy to jump to a particular section.

CONS:
  One small disappointment: at one point Jill says that she will explain later how to get a nice painted edge where the silk is pinned to the frame but she never did get to that. I've seen alternative ways of stretching silk in which the edge is not pinned up against the wood frame and I think I will try that when I get started.
  As one reviewer commented, I also found the construction noise in the background to be a bit distracting, but I enjoyed the content of the dvd so much, and Jill herself is so likable, I'm going to forgive that.

BOTTOM LINE:
Positives outweigh the negatives by far so I'm still going with 5 stars.
At the end of the presentation, Jill herself acknowledges that these are not all of the possible techniques and suggests at the end that there might be another dvd down the road. I say, bring it on (without the construction)!",1269993600,8,2084,4.455263157894737
8200470,4,B000RG17GI,"I didn't have any idea of silk paitng, but I was interested on it as my new hobby. I think this DVD is like a good guide of the basic materials and a quick general review of what silk paiting is, for me it was useful. and for me works better than reading a book.",1239494400,,262,3.7818181818181817
8200471,5,B000RG17GI,"Whether you are a beginner or a pro or just an admirer of silk, this DVD is a must. It provides inspiration, assurance. Jill Kennedy's lovely personality totally comes thru. A very professional DVD. I can only recommend it!",1234137600,,223,4.743589743589744
