Special footnote, George Randolph Scott better known as Randolph Scott, was an American film actor whose career spanned the sound era from the late 1920s to the early 1960s ... his popularity grew in the 1940s and 1950s, appearing in such films as ""Gung Ho""! (1943) and ""Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm"" (1938); but he was especially famous for his numerous Westerns including ""Virginia City"" (1940) with Errol Flynn and Humphrey Bogart, ""Western Union"" (1941) with Robert Young and ""Ride the High Country"" (1962) with Joel McCrea (a coin was flipped to see whether Scott or McCrea would receive top billing, and Scott won despite having a slightly smaller role) ... his long fistfight with John Wayne in ""The Spoilers"" (1942) was frequently cited by critics and the press as the most thrilling ever filmed; they were fighting over Marlene Dietrich ... another smash hit film together that same year called ""Pittsburgh"" (1942) once again with Dietrich, Scott and Wayne --- Daniel Webster defines ""Legend"", as being a notable person, or the stories told about that person exploits --- well by the time Randolph Scott made his best films he had long established himself as a legend in the film industry --- they say practice makes perfect, if that is true by 1958 at 60 years of age he was the master with these oaters from the 50s ... ""The Cariboo Trail"" (1950), ""The Nevadan"" (1950), ""Colt .45"" (1950), ""Santa Fe"" (1951), ""Sugarfoot"" (1951), ""Fort Worth"" (1951), ""Man in the Saddle"" (1951), ""Carson City"" (1952), ""The Man Behind the Gun"" (1952), ""Hangman's Knot"" (1952), ""Thunder over the Plains"" (1953), ""The Stranger Wore a Gun"" (1953), ""Ten Wanted Men"" (1954), ""Riding Shotgun"" (1954), ""The Bounty Hunter"" (1954), ""Rage at Dawn"" (1955), ""Tall Man Riding"" (1955), ""A Lawless Street"" (1955), ""Seven Men from Now"" (1956), ""Seventh Cavalry"" (1956), ""Decision at Sundown: (1957), ""Shoot-Out at Medicine Bend"" (1957), ""The Tall T"" (1957), ""Buchanan Rides Alone"" (1958), ""Ride Lonesome"" (1959), ""Westbound"" (1959),  ""Comanche Station"" (1960) --- Scott's age seemed to matter little, they only came to see another Randolph Scott film and always got their money's worth --- Scott's films were good and getting better becoming classics --- so if you ever wonder ""What Ever Happened To Randolph Scott"", just rent or purchase one of his films and you'll see he's never left us.

381474,4,6301952529,"This film has shown up on several labels, usually in faded cinecolor. It's a good vehicle for solid Western action by Randy Scott (this time up in Canada), who turns in a very enjoyable performance. George ""Gabby"" Hayes steals the show, however, and the movie is worth having to have his inimitable antics. Recommended. Now, if you can find TRAIL STREET, BADMAN'S TERRITORY, RETURN OF THE BADMEN, all with Scott and Hayes, snatch them up, too.",1059004800,12,443,4.842105263157895

381617,4,6301952529,"Jim Redfern (Randolph Scott) and Mike Evans (Bill Williams) are driving a small herd of cattle up from Montana into British Columbia, and arguing over whether to set up a ranch, or sell the beef and set themselves up prospecting in the gold fields. Evans, the junior partner, is the one with gold-fever, which translates quickly into hatred and anger when the men are ambushed, their herd driven off, and Mike severely injured. Jim still wants to be a cattleman, but he runs into many obstacles, not the least of them the man behind the stampeding of his cattle, area bigwig Frank Walsh (Victor Jory). He makes a new friend in Grizzly (a very characteristic Gabby Hayes) and together with his chuckwagon driver Ling (Lee Tung Foo) they proceed to try their hands at prospecting so as to be able to get back into ranching, surviving Indian attacks and Walsh's henchmen, with Jim finding himself the object of affection of Walsh's only competitor, Frances Harrison (Karen Booth), and the increasing venom of his ex-partner.

THE CARIBOO TRAIL was Scott's third western released in 1950, his sixth film with director Marin (and fifth western), and it shows up a lot of what is both best and worst in the b-westerns of the period.  Worst first - it looks cheap: shot in the ugly Cinecolor process, which doesn't offer the definition of monchrome nor the beauty and variety of Technicolor, and shot almost entirely and obviously on sets, which provides for some pretty ludicrous scenes like the one where our heroes are ambushed by Indians attacking from about 8 feet away. It's got one of the worst escape-from-capture scenes I've ever seen, the comic elements are uninteresting at best, and the natives aren't anything more than caricatures - though thankfully they don't make up too much of the plot. And what a plot! Indians and bandits and cattle and a bit of feminine jealousy and an ex-partner and prospecting and...whew. Too much to shoehorn into 80 minutes, that's for sure.

BUT the film also shows the virtues of these modest films. Scott is fine, bringing it up half a notch as he tends to when needed, and Jory is an excellent oily villain, with the best-written role in the film, not quite the typical man-who-owns-the-town, smoother and less violent, seemingly cowardly at first but with backbone enough to make him eventually dangerous. Williams is good too, wringing a little pathos out of the damaged goods role; Hayes is as I said, playing his expected part but it's appropriate here. And one upside of trying to put so much plot into such a short running span is that it's never boring, and somehow, miraculously, it does seem to all fit together at the end. I guess the worst thing I'd say about the film is that it feels like it could have been much better, had it had a bigger budget with better technical qualities, and maybe 15-20 minutes more to breathe. Paul Sawtell's music certainly seems to belong to an A-level picture, and is reminiscent of the score (by Dmitri Tiomkin) for another, better film focusing on a cattle drive from a couple of years earlier,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-River/dp/6304696612/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red River</a>. Well, this ain't on that level, pardner, not no way or no how, but it was a lot of fun, and sometimes that's enough.

The VHS looks a little rough but is serviceable enough; bottom line is, this isn't going to get a DVD release anytime soon unless it's ""on-demand"", and I doubt any restoration work would be in the offing.  Plus Cinecolor is only going to look so good.  So if you're a Scott fan, it's worth taking any way you can, and though it's certainly not one of his absolute best, like 90% of his westerns it's worth a look see.",1297900800,8,3758,4.854914196567862
