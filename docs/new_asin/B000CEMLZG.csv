8603409,1,B000CEMLZG,"The photo and title of the ad is of 2open water video tapes. The very small print is 1 dive master tape. Totally different level of certification. The seller would have taken it back but I had already tossed the package. Verrrry overpriced but again, I decided to buy it and not read the fine print. Seller admitted he knew nothing about diving as he sells a lot of books. Read the description carefully before purchasing from these large book sellers.",1345161600,,452,4.592592592592593
