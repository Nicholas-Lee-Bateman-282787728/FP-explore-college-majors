8355452,5,B00281TGJA,"I found Adam's technical approach to Flatpicking Blues as very beneficial.  His easy going teaching style is like sitting down with a friend and learning a part by part piece and then putting it all together.  I learned a lot from this DVD and I think it was fully worth the dollars I spent.  I am an intermediate guitarist and I REALLY enjoy my time spend with him.  I have several training DVD's that I - go back too - from time to time and, this is one of them.  I always seem to pick up something new from these lessons.",1285113600,2,524,4.148514851485149
8355453,5,B00281TGJA,"Many acoustic blues players play only fingerstyle guitar.

With this new release from [...], we have an excellent addition to the Homespun collection of music instruction as Adam Traum, son of Happy Traum, teaches acoustic blues with flatpick.

The instruction is presented clearly, and Adam builds slowly.  His teaching, especially in the key of E, is very enjoyable, both for those still in the latter stages of beginner, as well as for the Intermediate guitarist. There are some special small tricks (including using the pick to hit two strings and bend) but the majority is sound, ""line upon line"" that has marked his father's teaching.

The video is of the same high quality that one would expect from Homespun.  Clear, moving camera, close up, etc.  Very well done.

Because I don't play electric guitar (at least for now), this is my first encounter with Adam's teaching.  His demeanor is easy going and quite clear.  Like any gifted teacher, he anticipates a student's challenges and will slow down and repeat.

I hope that Adam plans on many more acoustic guitar DVD releases in the future.",1252627200,4,1099,4.923913043478261
