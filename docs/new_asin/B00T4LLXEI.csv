7000062,5,B00T4LLXEI,"This movie is a great feel good story.  It is obviously low budget, but sends a message that is pure and uplifting.  I don't know anything about horses, but I know a lot about people.  This movie kept a living room full of tweens quiet and interested for an hour and a half.  Thank you Gift Horse.",1431734400,6,297,4.157894736842105
7000063,1,B00T4LLXEI,"Very bad and unrealistic movie. The riders looked like they just hopped on a horse for the first time in their lives the eq was so bad. This movie pulled out every stereotype in the book, the snobby barn brat, the girl who lost her mother and hates fathers girlfriend, fathers girlfriend who wants his daughter to love her, you name it. The horse gets an injury (By the girl pulling the horses reins too hard some how...) then the horse might need surgery but makes a full recovery from just ice packs in less than a week, all the while the owner of the horse wants to get rid of the horse but some how is never brought up again. Don't forget about he kid who cant afford to eat and has a crush on the main character. The worst part of the movie is the big show at the end, the main character somehow gets first place on a horse recovering from a major injury and has never been to a show in her life.

Overall this movie is a mess with plot lines that were just forgotten. I would recomend if you want to laugh at the riding though, it is absolutely horrible",1429833600,2,1059,4.140776699029126
7000064,2,B00T4LLXEI,"A slow moving, often boring film.

7000065,3,B00T4LLXEI,"The story is cute but true equestrians beware - there is some cringe-worthy riding, oh the busy hands!  There's also quite a few head scratcher moments interacting with the horses and it's a completely unrealistic storyline.  Watchable but just ok really.",1429142400,3,255,5.195121951219512

7000075,1,B00T4LLXEI,"I tried to like this movie. I really did. I've loved horses and horse movies since I was a little girl, and I even like some of the really cheesy ones as long as they're believable.

This movie, however, was not believable at all.

First of all, the horse playing ""Misty"" (supposed to be a female horse) was a gelding, and the characters would regularly switch calling the horse ""she"" to ""he"" from one sentence to the next.

All of the characters were incredibly one-dimensional, from the little girl protagonist with no mother who hates her new potential stepmom but is somehow a perfect Horse Whisperer at 8 years old, to the spoiled rich teenage girl who really should have no business owning any animal and makes you feel good when the main character ""saves"" her horse from her. There is also the caring but oblivious widowed father, the rich father of the spoiled teenager who loves her but seems to have no idea that such a thing as tough love exists and keeps buying her affection instead, the rich man's gold-digging ex-wife, and the African American horse trainer who, as is typical in Hollywood, is characterized as rambling, excitable, and somewhat dim (because what movie is complete without some dated, racist sterotypes?)

The story is disjointed and has little buildup to the exposition, and all of the ""touching"" or ""teaching"" scenes that should have had some emotional depth just feel rushed and stuck randomly throughout the thin plot.

Overall, while I didn't expect this story to be an Oscar winner, I was hoping for at least a little bit of relatability and realism in the characters so that I could try to get immersed in their world. This movie delivered none of that. My advice: save your money and time for something better, like ""Black Beauty"" or ""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron."" At least with those the plot makes sense.",1478476800,2,1850,4.750778816199377

7000106,1,B00T4LLXEI,"Worst horse movie ever made. If tou know anything about horses or riding, this movie will make you cringe. I only watched it for free to make fun of it. The acting is awful as well. Makes equestrians look bad.",1442102400,,209,4.25
7000107,1,B00T4LLXEI,"My first impression upon seeing the cover of this movie ( A decent rider jumping a 3ft fence) was that it would be a somewhat cliche horse movie with good riding scenes like International Velvet or The Horse in the Grey Flannel suit but boy was I wrong. The actor playing the main character, a young girl working at a fancy barn can barely post to the trot and has to sit several bounces before posting again. The 14yo rich girl has supposedly been riding since she was six but has no contact and is only barely better than the other girl at posting. I was ready to turn it off only after watching one riding scene, but I kept going because I hoped the stunt doubles they would inevitably use for the jumping scenes would be better but...auuughhh! The doubles for both riders hunched over at the canter and got left behind over the fences multiple times. Furthermore, the horse that was supposedly a mare, was a gelding...The moment when I finally gave up and turned it off was the final show scene. The girl goes in, gets horrible distances, chips in, breaks gait, counter canters part of the way, and does simple changes all while flopping around on the poor pony's back like a sack of potatoes, and wins the class. I turned it off there.
Positive Elements? Some good messages about faith and a really cute horse that doesn't deserve to be ridden by those kids.
If your kid is six and can overlook the bad riding, cliche plot, bad acting, and general lack of horsemanship then this would be a cute movie. Anyone else?
Save the 7.00$.",1441843200,,1535,4.4661921708185055
7000108,5,B00T4LLXEI,Great movie!,1439251200,,12,5.5
7000109,1,B00T4LLXEI,"There were two chicks who were exactly the same and completely interchangeable. I think one was a 'Country Victoria Justice,' but the other wasn't even necessary. THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE FOR CHILDREN BECAUSE IT DOES NOT ENFORCE LABOR LAWS. THIS CHILD IS LIKE 2 YEARS OLD AND IS DOING MANUAL LABOR WITH HORSES. IF YOU WANT YOUR CHILD TO BE LAWFUL, DON'T LET THEM WATCH THIS FILM. Also, the horse was originally lame on the right front, but in the next scene (and the rest of the movie), apparently the left front was injured. And I think the girl injured it because she kept putting the boots on wrong. Also, as a side note, my daddy flies me in to my riding lesson every day (IN MY HELICOPTER)- even though she lives on site??? Don't forget the completely unnecessary child who didn't have any food, but now has food until he is fifteen years old (except he's like 3 tops). Also, the horse on the cover is not teh same horse in the film. And the jumps were one foot high and these chicks need to get a hold of their lives and stop poking horses with shovels.",1438646400,,1057,4.343434343434343

7000115,2,B00T4LLXEI,"1) As someone else pointed out... if you know anything about riding, there are some pretty cringe worthy scenes. Additionally, the child I watched this with pointed out very quickly that the horse that was supposed to be a ""she"" was actually a gelding.  FAIL.
2) I get that there was some religious influence in the movie but the lines where they were supposed to be showing that faith is a good thing felt very stilted and contrived; they came across as awkward at best.
3) The main reason I gave this movie 2 stars:  I understood that the movie was about personal growth and family values as well as being geared toward children of a certain age who are up for a ""I love fluffy ponies"" story and yet there's WAY TOO much of the whole ""$$ can solve your problems"" thing going on here.  I think that's a very BAD thing to be telling kids.

8700240,2,B00T4LLXEI,"It would be better if the cast could ride, if anyone in the movie knew anything about horses,  and if they would actually use a mare instead of a gelding. Also I don't get why the rich dad doesn't buy his daughter a horse that is actually trained. Also, the little girl randomly goes from not even being able to trot a full lap to being able to canter and jump. Really doesn't make sense. And the whole ""I pulled on your reins to hard that's why your leg is hurt"" is so dumb. This is a cute movie if you know absolutely nothing about horses. If you like the story line but want better quality watch the older movie called Danny.",1519084800,,628,4.147540983606557
8700241,1,B00T4LLXEI,This movie was very inaccurate. The ridding was absolute rubbish. It was clear that none of them knew any thing about horse.

8700243,1,B00T4LLXEI,"I watched this on Netflix. It had the potential to be a good movie...but oh boy was it not. I can't even describe how terrible the acting was. It came across as forced, cheesy, and as though the actors were literally reading their lines from the script. Very disappointed in John Schneider's acting. At his age and his ""resume"", he should have delivered a far better performance than he did. I recognized Kyla Kennedy (Amanda) from her role as Mika on The Walking Dead, and while her character development in this movie was piss poor, she did try her best. It just wasn't believable. The actor who portrayed Avery could not be understood. I had to turn on the subtitles because he was mush-mouthed. The ex-wife was laughable, the teenager had no acting skills whatsoever, and the father of Amanda was downright pathetic. The boy who had a crush on Amanda.....I won't even go there.  I think the only one who delivered a half-believable performance was the trainer. Overall the movie fell flat, and quickly. It was all I could to finish it.

Watch this on Netflix and then decide if you want to purchase.",1495065600,,1103,4.651282051282052
8700244,2,B00T4LLXEI,"This movie appears to be a re-make of an older film called Danny, and the producers here should have left good enough alone. This film is great for kids or for anyone who doesn't know a thing about horses, but for anyone who does, wow--this is really, really bad. The little girl who is the protagonist is adorable and sweet, but she clearly hasn't spent more than about 10 minutes up on a horse, she doesn't even know how to hold the reins. The ""rotten"" girl isn't any better. I don't understand why someone would make a movie about riding horses, and not use kids who can ride. At least swap them out for doubles on the riding scenes! Even aside from the riding, its clear from the terminology used throughout the film that the director knows nothing about horses, and didn't bother to consult anyone about it. Find the film called Danny, with Rebeca Page, and see the difference! Now THAT one is a great film, all the way around!",1491868800,,932,4.456140350877193
