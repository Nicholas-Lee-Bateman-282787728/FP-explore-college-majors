8523823,4,B0080WV0GS,"The 25th Anniversary Of WrestleMania:
WrestleMania celebrated it's 25th EDITION (not anniversary if you want to get technical) here with a few notes in that Tazz left WWE earlier in the week when his contract expired & with there being no ECW match, the entire event was a 3 man announce team of Michael Cole & Jim Ross & Jerry Lawler, the lead singer from the pop group ""The Pussycat Dolls"" (don't remember her name & honestly, don't care) sang the national anthem, and newly inducted Hall Of Famer Stone Cold Steve Austin giving his own salute to Texas.
The match that had the entire world talking about this PPV was ""Mr. WrestleMania vs. The Streak"" with Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels in a match that had everything (including the unique ""Heaven & Hell"" entrances) on a physical & emotional level of both men refusing to lose to the point where this was the closest anyone had ever come to breaking the streak to the point where you saw the most emotion from Undertaker since his ""Deadman"" character returned 5 years ago while Shawn was even so desperate at one point that he was hoping for a win via count out.  The main event was the WWE Championship Match with Randy Orton challenging Triple H in a match where the title could change hands on a disqualification however it was a stipulation that only hurt the match more than helped as it wasn't played out well on so many levels with the story of Triple H keep ""holding himself back"" while they hit their finishing moves in the first minute that popped the crowd only to slow the match down so much that the crowd was dead minus big spots.  Another standout match here was Chris Jericho in a handicap elimination match against Roddy Piper & Jimmy Snuka & Ricky Steamboat with Ric Flair in their corner that saw Steamboat put on such a performance for a man who's been retired for 15 years that was better than some of the current talent today but stay tuned for the aftermath involving Jericho & ""The Wrestler"" star Mickey Rourke.  Other matches include World Champion Edge vs. John Cena vs. Big Show, the Money In The Bank Ladder match that saw Kofi Kingston be the human highlight reel of the match, the Ms. WrestleMania battle royal that saw some divas from the past return along with the a ""debut"", the Hardy brothers of Matt & Jeff fought against each other in an Extreme Rules match, Intercontinental Champion J.B.L. vs. Rey Mysterio that would end up changing on man's career forever, and the pre-show match to unify both the WWE & World Tag Team Titles between Carlito & Primo vs. John Morrison & The Miz in the DVD extras.
DVD extras include the Hall Of Fame featuring Koko B. Ware (why?), The Funks, The Von Erichs, Bill Watts, The Fink, Ricky Steamboat, and Steve Austin.

Backlash 2009:
After a decade, this would turn out to be the final Backlash PPV for WWE as they would move Extreme Rules up to replace it the next year.  The main event was a Last Man Standing Match with World Champion John Cena vs. Edge in what was set to be the final encounter in their long running feud that played off both men knowing each other so well while also beating each other into exhaustion.  The WWE Championship was defended for the first time ever in a six man tag between all 3 members of Legacy (Orton, Rhodes, Dibiase) against 3 men who they've all had issues with for months in WWE Champion Triple H & Batista & Shane McMahon with the title being able to change on a DQ or count-out with the story being played that the one team had so many different their personal issues & agendas against Legacy that they were having trouble working together.  Other matches include Ricky Steamboat's final match against Chris Jericho, ECW Champion Jack Swagger vs. Christian, C.M. Punk vs. Kane, and Jeff & Matt Hardy against each other in an ""I Quit"" Match.
The only DVD extra was what happened backstage after the six man tag.

In the end, while WrestleMania was hyped to be a major show due to the 25th anniversary, it was a letdown quality wise with the only highlights being the first HBK vs. Taker Mania match, Steamboat's performance, the Hardys, and Money In The Bank.  Backlash was the better wrestling show overall & although it wasn't a classic event, it's still a show that's worth going out of your way to see.  Overall this is a good package.",1343520000,,4305,4.543225806451613
