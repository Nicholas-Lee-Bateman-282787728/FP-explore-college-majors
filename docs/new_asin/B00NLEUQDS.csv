This film was adapted from a Broadway play and it shows. It begins with a car driving through the southwest desert. A lone man walks along a dry dusty road. There is a desert lunchroom and gas station. One customer comments on politics. The owner is a member of the local militia. There is a rumor about bandit gang loose in the area. The hired man Bose likes Gabby, the daughter of the owner. A wanderer walks into the lunchroom. Gabby was born in Bourges France; her mother left the desert to return to France. Gabby dreams of poetry and a fantasy life in France. [Will she be disappointed by reality?] Mr. Squire seems to have a grand idea of himself. The talk reveals their characters. Is world chaos caused by nature? [An odd way of thinking.]

The Duke Mantee gang is in the area, what will happen if they reach the lunchroom? The talks suggests Mr. Squire seems doomed. The tension affects the people. Bose makes a wrong move. Mrs. Edith Chisholm doesnt have a bridle for her tongue. Did Mr. Squire have too much to drink? Is this story too fantastic to believe? Do the speeches seem unintentionally funny now? Like Ediths asking for a ride. [What did she drink?] The posse arrives at the lunchroom and the shoot-out begins. Will the outlaw gang escape? Will Squire do a far, far better thing that he has ever done before? Is there a moral to this story? Its success on Broadway tells something about the theatre audience of that time. The ending to the film seems tacked on to match the Hollywood Code. What happened to the hostages? I wonder what people read into this story. Gramps seemed like the star in his scenes.

One unbelievable part is the capture of the militia men. Being from that area they should have noticed something was wrong when they arrived. Squires talent seems to have been smothered in the lap of luxury: too much too soon. If Gabby has talent she should practice, not travel like a tourist. Her fantasy won't match the reality. Entranced by the translation of a medieval poet? Grow up! This story was inspired by the Dillinger Gangs visit to Tucson Arizona. The police there soon captured this gang and sent them back to where they were wanted for their crimes. This gang could hide in an urban area like Chicago, but were more noticeable in a rural area.",1470614400,,2321,4.561151079136691
