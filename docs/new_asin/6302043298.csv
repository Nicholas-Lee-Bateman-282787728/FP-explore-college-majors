8207086,5,6302043298,This is a really fun video. You learn a little bit about the band and see some of their earliest music! I think these guys were an amazing band. I saw them in concert and absolutely loved them! Nuno is a guitar genius and the bands energy really impressed me. Having a video to watch is great but I would love it on DVD! I wish there were more videos released of them! Now I want some live video from 3 Sides!,1076025600,,409,4.0
8207087,5,6302043298,"This video is definitely under rated as was the band Extreme. My own home town of Boston has always had the gift of rising talents such as Aerosmith; The Cars; even They Might Be Giants and the J Geil's Band rose up from the under ground in Bean town. Extreme's talents are ever changing and leaves one going on journeys through out the music. I for one have had the pleasure of seeing and greeting this amazingly talented quartet. With fun personalities and incredible musicianship, this video production has what it takes to get to the top, even if it is for a short while. Here's to my home town boys and friends I will always treasure! They are AWESOME!",1026604800,,657,4.483333333333333
