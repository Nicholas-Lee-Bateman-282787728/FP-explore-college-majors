8494212,5,B0066PSQ3G,Great video and instruction!,1456704000,,28,6.25
8494213,5,B0066PSQ3G,"I bought this DVD as a supplement to my other guitar lessons I'm doing. I have a few of Troy's books, and really like them and find them pretty concise and helpful, although they are really challenging. This isn't really an instructional video per say, or just an interview video, it's somewhere in between. Basically what this dvd is, is it is like you get to sit down and talk to Troy about his philosophy and how he approaches playing guitar, what techniques he uses and likes and recommends, and some of his favorite  exercises for speed and control. It's filmed interview style and its him talking directly to you. Some ""instructional"" videos I have are basically some meathead showing off for 55 minutes and then telling you, ""so, like, now do that."" Well, this isn't quite as bad, as Troy RIPS through plenty of examples without very much set up, but the thing I like about this video is, yeah, he's ripping through them, BUT, he's explaining WHY he's doing it and his logic behind it. So, even though I am an ""intermediate"" guitar player, the few tips I picked up, the knowledge about kinda how and why to do a few things, made this video worth purchasing. I really appreciate an INSTRUCTION video that actually has someone smarter than me on it, who is actually TEACHING me something or inspiring me in some way to figure something out on my own. That's where this video shines. Troy really comes off as being sincere and wants me to learn something from him. He's very well spoken and a natural teacher. His style is loose and candid. The setting and camera work are top notch. This isn't one of those gimmicky cash grab ""Learn everything about playing in a band as lead guitar in an Hour"" dvd's where you're just copying what some horrible host is showing you and talking to you as you're a dork and he's the cool kid.

 Most of the video was way over my head, as there is a LOT of assuming you have some knowledge of music theory, but the way it's presented didn't make me irritated, it only made me want to learn more so what was presented could really connect with me.  It comes with a TAB lesson book, which has all the examples he plays, so you can practice them on your own.

I would say, if you're hungry for all types of guitar instruction, this video is a great insight to a really super talented guitarist! It's basically like sitting down with Troy for a couple hours and him trying to convey to you his 30 years of experience and ideas. There's a ton of knowledge here, you just have to be able to properly receive it, or be prepared and ready to do some work to make those ideas ""click"" for you.

**UPDATE:OCT.2014***** Well as I've progressed at guitar and my knowledge of music theory, I went back and rewatched some of the tips. It was cool because now I can better grasp some of the concepts and was able to pick up some valuable tips! I would say to any and every new guitarist, don't blame the material at first if you don't understand it yet, just be patient and keep studying and soon things will just make sense to you. Good luck! Great video!!!!!!! Also, fun to watch some of the shredders on this video. MAB was my favorite. Sweet guitar too!

**UPDATE: NOV.2014**** I watched this video AGAIN the other night. I pretty much learn something new each time I watch it. The more you learn, the more you are able to learn. This DVD is a great resource if you can extract the tips that Troy presents. Also, its fun to watch.",1408579200,4,3454,4.41287284144427
