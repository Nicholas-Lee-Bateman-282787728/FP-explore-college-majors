5963957,3,B00F37VHPM,"Novemeber is going to be a great month. PS4, Thor- The Dark World and this episode of Dr Who.
Seeing Smith, Tennant, Coleman and Piper as well as John Hurt, its just going to be awesome.
I really liked Tennant when he first started his stint in the role but in his later years he just got too shouty and bug eyed for me.
For me, Smith and T Baker are the best incarnations of this amazing character",1380499200,22,398,4.115384615384615
5963958,5,B00F37VHPM,A great episode.  The 50th Anniversary special not only brings back a fan favorite Tennant (Doctor #10) but also shows us the Time War and intruduces the War Doctor.  This is a must have episode for any true fan of Doctor Who.,1515715200,,226,4.357142857142857

5963960,3,B00F37VHPM,"Episode is pretty good but I experience playback issue with this blu-ray disc that I don't experience with other blu-ray discs. I am using LG OLED 55c7 TV and Sony 4K ubp x800 player. I've had random picture flicker issue with Sony player and it was actually this Blu-ray disc when the flashing was the worst. Because I experienced the blu-ray player menu screen flashing in other occasions, I ended up replacing the player with a new one (same brand/model) and it  had been working fine with no issue until tonight when I inserted this disc and the flashing came back. So I suspect it has something to do with this disc. Maybe mine is defective but then again the issue sometimes goes away when I turn off and turn on the unit. Im at a loss. Maybe it has something do with it being 3D.",1515024000,,786,4.383561643835616

5963964,5,B00F37VHPM,"One of the better Doctor Who multi-doctor shows; it asks the philosophical questions, ""how do you know if a person is a good person or not? Is it just the decisions they make or does context of decisions temper that judgement?""",1514073600,,227,4.560975609756097

5963975,5,B00F37VHPM,"This is one of those ""you've got to see this!"" Videos. For the Doctor Who fan it includes 5 Doctors! (You'll need to go through the Extras to find the fifth Doctor, and that makes it fun).
For those who are new to the Doctor Who, dare I say lifestyle, this is a perfect story for explaining the Doctor's long life, his ability to regenerate, and the great burden he carries. Plus you get two of the very best companions/associates; Clara Oswald and Rose Tyler.
There are enough twists and turns to the storyline to keep the fanatics happy and to initiate the new viewer to the Doctor's world .
I have all of the videos from Doctors 9-12, plus many of the Tom Baker series (for you who are still new to the show, Tom Baker was the image of the Doctor up to the new series. He's the guy with the unbelievable long, multicolored scarf; the explosion of curly hair, and the most colorful clothes since  height of Victorian fashion. He was a total change from the previous Doctors and set the bar for all of the Doctors who followed. )
And I have to put this DVD among the 5 best of all. I've watched it over a dozen times and it is still one that I could pop in the DVR and enjoy watching it again.",1504310400,,1194,4.191304347826087
5963976,5,B00F37VHPM,"As one who was confused about how many discs this movie came with, I'm seeking to leave a review of the content of this product, rather than a review of the movie itself. I'm tired of seeing those types of reviews when I'm only looking for information on the product.

Day of the Doctor comes with only 2 discs, a regular DVD and a blu ray/3D disc. First time I've ever seen both the blu ray and 3D versions be included on the same disc. Though the cover slip says Blu Ray 3D+Blu Ray+DVD, there are only 2 discs, not 3. Obviously the Blu Ray/3D has all the Special Features like the 8th Doctor and Fall of Arcadia short. Hope this review is helpful to someone out there.",1502928000,,670,4.234375

5963978,3,B00F37VHPM,"Who was this Doctor? I could not understand John Hurt's place in the pantheon. The special cannot compare to The Three Doctors and the Five Doctors. I recommend it for diehard fans only. Tennant and Smith are great together. So too is a cameo by the great Tom Baker.

5964004,5,B00F37VHPM,If you like Doctor Who THIS is THE ULTIMATE.  Firstly this special is extremely well written and a complete joy to watch.  The addition of 3D makes it extra great.  The Time Lord art they refer to in the program that's supposedly 3D now really is and looks much more impressive.  I've seen this before in 2D and very much enjoyed it but I wasn't prepared for how much better it was in 3D.

5964055,5,B00F37VHPM,"A lot has been said about this special ignoring the classic who. The truth is, it would be hard or impossible to have a representative of all the Doctors in the run time of this special. What really hurts is the dead status of a few actors, and the advanced age of others. What is really great is the inclusion of the mini-episode The Night Of The Doctor, which gives Paul McGann, perhaps, his final time on screen as the Eighth Doctor. The 90s TV movie is often maligned by fans, but giving McGann a more proper, on-screen farewell is a nice touch.

The biggest thing that is great about this special, it doesn't eliminate any of Doctor Who from 2005 to 2013 in terms of story, but it does help eliminate the bad taste of the Doctor being the one who wiped out his own people. Sure, he can't remember, but we know that the Doctor didn't burn his people after all. It also helps in filling in gaps, the Night Of The Doctor shows the Eighth Doctor regenerating into the War Doctor, The Day Of The Doctor shows the War Doctor regenerating into the Ninth Doctor. We can safely assume that, without much in terms of time, the scene with The War Doctor regenerating is quickly lead into Series 1, Episode 1, Rose. A lot has been said about Moffat's storytelling, but at least these moves have helped fill holes that might otherwise have laid open.",1482883200,14,1342,4.411290322580645

5964068,5,B00F37VHPM,"You should only watch this if you like fun. If you are uptight, stodgy, hate silly things, hate adventure, need everything to be realistic and dour all the time, then this isn't for you. Doctor Who is silly. It's for families. This particular entry has a great roller coaster of a plot, great performances all around, and a beautiful redemption arc. So if you want to be happy, get yourself a bit familiar with the Doctor Who mythology, maybe watch some previous episodes to get the gist of what's happening, then enjoy yourself.",1482019200,,529,4.698924731182796

My first real introduction to Doctor Who was the 2005 version with the 9th Doctor and Rose.  The scene in that one where she become Bad Wolf and says 'the time war ends'  doesn't seem so random with this sort of wove everything into a tighter over all picture too. :)  Still loose enough for wiggle room too.

No more Daleks
No more

This 50th Anniversary special finally tells us about the Last Great Time War and what the Doctor did. There's a silly little side story involving an invasion of zygons that doesn't get much screen time or any kind of resolution. Three Doctors meet up and that, of course, trumps any invasion story. But this is very well done

The War Doctor is about to end the war with a weapon known as The Moment which takes the form of Rose Tyler.  The Moment brings together the ninth and tenth Doctors to meet up with the War Doctor to help him decide a better fate for Gallifrey.

5964204,4,B00F37VHPM,"As a lifelong fan of Doctor Who, I really enjoyed this special. It had all the elements that could make a great special, or a horrible mash-up of Doctors... and delivered an exciting, if brief, joyride through time. Unless you watch future episodes of Doctor Who, many of the ""unresolved"" plot points WILL drive you batty, which is Steven Moffat's usual method of storytelling. There's a lot going on in this special that plays out much, much later... but even as a stand-alone episodes it's quite enjoyable. My only complaint is the lack of Eccleston, but I had already known he wasn't going to reprise his role as The Doctor before I watched it. If you like Doctor Who, you'll like this... assuming you haven't already watched it a dozen times.",1467244800,,746,4.702290076335878

5964281,4,B00F37VHPM,"I think my favorite part of the collection was actually watching the recaps of what Doctor Who had been like over the years. As a mostly-new Whovian, I really like the nuts-and-bolts aspect of it. I also really enjoyed the short videos leading up to the special, though some of the effects in ""The Night of the Doctor"", particularly, look a little bit cheesy, but I loved the dialogue. The fiftieth anniversary special was heartrending, but not quite as spectacular as I had expected, for some reason, up until the part where all the Doctors came back to save Gallifrey. The ending with the clue that Gallifrey had survived felt entirely unnecessary, though I did appreciate the Tom Baker cameo.
Maybe that's the point, though--we interrupt Ten on just one of his casual adventures, Eleven getting sucked back in, and some faith restored for the War Doctor. All the same, I expected a little bit more.",1462924800,,901,4.782051282051282

I might actually get tempted to buy the entire set, we will see...",1440115200,,278,4.365384615384615
5964405,5,B00F37VHPM,"The ultimate question that rests upon the mind of Who fans everywhere (and everywhen) - what happened to, and at, Gallifrey back in the era of the Time War - is answered in the most divine, sublime, heartbreakingly beautiful and brilliant way possible in this, the most extraordinary and watchable episode of DOCTOR WHO ever made.

It starts out with a bit of James Bond-esque parody and fun, with the TARDIS being innocently picked up by helicopter and returned to UNIT HQ - but with Clara and the Doctor still inside.  From there, a note from Queen Elizabeth THE FIRST is hand delivered to the worlds favourite time travelling super hero, and then the action simply never lets up.

The episode is brilliantly structured and plotted on several different levels.  Earth is under attack from shape shifting aliens in their own truly brilliant way and its only the Doctors with a little inspirational help (from Mega Babe Clara Oswald) who can come up with the perfect solution to beat them at their own game.  But the story is not just about an alien invasion.

The overall solution to it all is so overwhelming and satisfying, that at programs end, you don't know if you should laugh, cry, stand up and applaud your television set or even send love letters to the British Prime Minister for creating the BBC in the first place.  I suggest that you calm down, and watch the whole thing again.  That is what I did.

As an epilogue to the episode, there is a cameo from a famous Doctor from the past (or is that the future?), but this is more than a mere cameo.  It is the icing on the cake, but even that phrase fails to do its effect on the viewer justice.

The role and performance of John Hurt as the man who started it all, in his attempt to thwart those dastardly Daleks back during the Time War, sets the story telling bar so high that you may need your own oxygen supply just to keep track of it.  Doctors Ten and Eleven work so well together, that you may think they have always worked that way.  And even standard, everyday Whovian technology such as the humble sonic screwdriver is given its own flash of genius by the scriptwriters in one of the shows pivotal points.

Doctor Who has always been about fun mixed with science mixed with  fiction, but this episode is at times laugh out loud funny.  Emotion overall plays a strong role, too; at various points you may find yourself gripping your armchair in awe as massively significant historical facts are revealed which leaves the viewer with goosebumps on their goosebumps.  And when Clara has tears of disappointment running down her cheeks near the shows end, it is hard to keep your own face dry from the same sentiments.

THE DAY OF THE DOCTOR is so good that it is ridiculous.  As i have  said at the top of my review, it answers the ultimate Whovian question in typically brilliant style, but leaves the viewer wanting (and getting) more.

Never have I loved television so much as I do right now.  The BBC rules my world!!!",1439683200,,2990,4.528864059590316

The story was filmed in 3D, and it actually uses this in the storyline. It's not just the usual ""ooh look, things are popping out of the screen"" party trick. Enjoy it here in this episode. The BBC announced that ""The Day of the Doctor"" would be their last 3D television production. There aren't any US companies of note doing 3D television production.

Unfortunately, the DW discs have become increasingly thin with the extras. This one is no exception, so I downgraded the rating. Considering it's the golden anniversary, I was expecting a feature-packed disc set. In particular, I was hoping they would provide ""The Five(ish) Doctors,"" a great comic piece starring Peter Davison, Collin Baker, Sylvester McCoy, Paul McGann, (the recorded voice of) Tom Bake...

5964409,4,B00F37VHPM,"Since the reboot of Doctor Who in 2005 with Christopher Ecclestone as the battle-scarred Doctor, the series has had some great moments and some wonderful actors. While the current lead writer/script wrangler Moffat may lack the sureness of touch possessed by the former lead writer Russell T Davis, he's undoubtedly been responsible for some of the best individual episodes. Now, however, comes the greatest challenge: writing a 50th Anniversary Special that will satisfy the fandom, enthrall new viewers, and somehow maintain continuity with all that has gone before.

The bad news first: Ecclestone refused to participate in the making of this Anniversary Special, which meant that Moffat was forced to write around the absence of that particular Doctor. It also meant that Ecclestone's particular blend of menace and manic energy was unavailable - a great shame, as it would have made the moments with all three Doctors much more engaging and edgy. But it was not to be, for reasons best known ... Read more",1439337600,,1010,5.121212121212121

His stories about the Doctor, always fascinating, sometimes frightening, sometimes amusing. But in any case, it is always interesting. For me, this film is a kind of holiday. It's wonderful that I live in a time when the cult TV series Doctor Who is on top of the world success. I will not reveal the intent of this film, because it's spoilers.

What's wonderful is that even if you're not up to speed on the rebooted Doctor Who (up to that point), it's a great story and you quickly learn your way around. It helps, of course, if you understand what Doctor Who is. <smile>

The bantering and byplay between three incarnations of the Doctor, played by Matt Smith, David Tennant and one other (no spoilers!) is unbeatable. There are some touching moments for fans of the original Doctor Who series as well.

5964475,5,B00F37VHPM,A one-of-a-kind chance to gather most of the Doctors in a drama to solve a dilemma that goes to the heart of Doctor 'Who'.,1427414400,,122,4.125
5964476,3,B00F37VHPM,"As with previous celebratory episodes of the series, the 50th anniversary episode of Doctor Who pitted different iterations of the same character on the screen together, including one which we had not seen before (outside of a brief moment of foreshadowing for this very episode) and well a spoiler would fit in quite nicely here.

So, obviously, the world was excited.  My friends (most of them) were excited.  My wife was excited (a selection of treats including jammy dodgers, jelly babies, and fish fingers and custard was created for our viewing event).  And yesI was a bit excited.  There were so many rumors going around about this thing, which of the previous 10 doctors were going to appear, which villains were coming about, what previous companions were going to join in, and a whole host of other murmurs regarding this single 75 minute episode.

So, perhaps I came into the episode with my hopes too high.  As someone whos been recently making his way through the original episodes, trying to fill out my geek card as well as possible, I was hoping for something that would work well as an homage to the entirety of the previous 50 years of story telling.

I was disappointed.

Although there were questions that were answered (in minimal fashion) that were initially asked back when the series restarted in 2005, it seemed that most of the series prior to that date was forgotten about.  Sure, there were little head nods toward costume choices, character names, and pictures of companions; there were overt attempts to remind people that this show has been around for awhile, including a moment that would be too much of a spoiler as well as the final shot of the episode, which actually reminded me a bit of the old episode titled The Five Doctors.

But, heck, even this episode didn't resolve its own storylines.  All three of the doctors leave a tense moment with aliens who are in the midst of invading earth (arent they always?) to deal with their own personal issues.  We never see how things resolve the story line was really only there to show a monster that only appeared one time prior in the entirety of the show.

Overall, the episode had its moments.  There were definitely some exciting bits in which little fanboy jumps of the heart occurred.  But as a storyit was lacking, it was confusing, and more than that, it really didn't do the series as a whole any form of justice.  Instead of acting as an homage, it really only served as a launch pad for the new face of the doctor, so we have an idea of where his stories will be going.

Im not saying that we needed Tom Baker back on the ground, sonic screwdriver in hand as he goes on a hunt for the ghost of Patrick Troughton.  But I do think that a lot more could have been done to make this an actual anniversary episode for something that has spanned a half a century, as opposed to the precursor for next season that it really ended up being.

Its totally worth the watchbut Im not certain it was worth the attention the BBC gave it.",1427068800,,3016,4.5602968460111315
5964477,5,B00F37VHPM,"Really like the episodes where past Doctors get together to do the ""things"". It was great to see Tennant and Smith together and the word play was terrific (e.g. comparing the sizes of there sonic screwdrivers and Timey Whimey logic) I think John Hurt provided the anchor to keep the two others from bouncing off the walls with their exuberance. From the light hearted moments to the darker side of the War Doctor this is a terrific Special leading into the Time of the Doctor season finale. P.S. Loved the cameo by Tom Baker (shhh!) The fourth Doctor was my first Doctor. So sad to hear that many of his companions have passed on.",1426896000,,630,4.535087719298246

5964534,5,B00F37VHPM,"Oh boy was I excited for this movie.

I'm a slight Whovian in that I've seen most of the show but am not quite caught up yet. I got my roommate into it and he came running into the house throwing me a coat and yelling about getting in the car. They showed this in theaters for one night only. We were lucky to have one about 45 minutes away that had it. How I wish I could watch it like that all the time. Just seeing the Doctors up on screen was so beautiful that it sent shivers up my spine.

I really don't want to spoil anything so I'll just state some stuff about the film. 3 Doctors meet under very strange circumstances. Doctors 10, 11, and the War Doctor. They are played by their actors, Tennant, Smith, and John Hurt. This movie was so much fun. Tennant and Smith are hilarious together and the sternness of Hurt just makes it more fun. There are serious times, of course, but overall, it feels like a very long episode. That's not a bad thing at all. It's brilliant.

There's a ton of little references that older Doctor Who fans will notice. I'm 24 but one guy in the theater explained some of them for me. For example, at least one previous Doctor makes an appearance. There's a scarf involved. There's also some nods to River Song (her shoes) and some others that I won't spoil.

If you're a Whovian, you really should own this. As long as you've met Matt Smith, it will make sense. Clara, his companion, was new to me because I'm not that far into the episodes but it wasn't that big of a deal.

Stop reading this and click 'Buy'. It's so good, I laughed, I cried (especially the ending), and I even shivered a bit (those eyebrows).",1421020800,,1647,4.2492012779552715

The exchange between Matt Smith and David Tennant (my favorite) is priceless, not to mention John Hurt's performance (phenomenal). The final scene with  - spoilers - is probably the best moment on the show in 50 years. The only thing I wish was different is that Christopher Eccleston showed up for the regeneration scene-not because I like him so much (he's actually one of my least favorites), but that the connection between Hurt and Eccleston would make a little more sense to those who have been watching this show for only a little while. I know it's not the producer's fault, but still, Eccleston needs to realize he has been a part of something that he won't ever be rid of.",1420675200,,760,4.547445255474453

With friends of ours talking about it, reading comments on the Internet, we felt that we needed to purchase it in order to avoid spoilers.  It also cost a lot more than a normal episode, even though it was an 1:20 instead of :47.  I kind of felt taken advantage of.

Other than the price, it was a really enjoyable episode.",1416182400,,545,4.42

5964685,5,B00F37VHPM,"I am a HUGE DW fan and this does not disappoint.  Loads of fun with a wonderful chemistry between Smith and Tennant that just shines through every moment they are together on screen.  Tennant's doctor gets to have a picnic with Queen Elizabeth, kisses a lot (not much has changed there!) and threatens Thumper because his timey wimey detector goes ""ding"" at the wrong times.  Smith's doctor still loves a good fez, can NOT keep his hands from gesturing and revels in his sonic screwdriver being bigger than Tennants.  They both love ""the round things"" in the Tardis even though neither of them know what they are for and they both like each other's glasses.  All through this Hurt stands between them and basically just shakes his head.  They call him grand dad, Tennant is sand shoes and Matt is chiney.  Confused?  Don't be.  Just sit back and go along for the ride.  All will make sense along the way and you will be so happy you climbed aboard the Tardis for this incredibly satisfying and just plain fun trip!",1415836800,,1014,4.583333333333333

Those of us who saw this in theaters in the US know that there is a Theatrical version with a run time of 85 minutes.

The Theatrical version is quite funny and all those bits are missing in the TV version.

Is the Theatrical version included on this disc as a bonus feature?  If not, does anyone know where to obtain a copy of the US theatrical version.

He had to make the mistake in order to grow and for time to pass so that he could come back and correct that mistake.

5964815,4,B00F37VHPM,"While I'm heartbroken, devastated, disappointed and depressed at the exit of Matt Smith as the doctor, I can still appreciate the quality of these last episodes.  Steven Moffatt is on a roll these days, with a Midas touch that gives us Sherlock! and the last few seasons of the Doctor.  The show is slick, smart, sophisticated and yet charming.  David Tennant was the doctor that won me over, and I didn't think I could stay involved after he left.  But Matt Smith turned out to be a perfect successor.  In a pretext where each iteration of the Doctor carries the experience and emotional development of all previous lifetimes, it seemed totally plausible that David Tennant could morph into Matt Smith, a classic clown with the mask of tragedy peeking out through the manic comedy. Very much like Robin Williams, the devastatingly sad eyes  that sell anything the story throws at us.  I'm not ready to engage with another Doctor, and will miss the man-child carrying the universe on his back.  I hope Peter can bring it, but having come to this party very late in the evening, I savor every moment with the Doctor as he is.",1411603200,,1124,4.67005076142132

Too bad Christopher Eccleston declined to participate.  But we do get a fine performance by John Hurt.  It's worth seeing the prequel with 8th Doctor Paul McGann.  I wish there would have been a way to include more companions.  Being a fan of the original series, I found this much better than earlier multiple doctor anniversary episodes (i.e. 10th Anniversary:  The Three Doctors, 20th Anniversary -- the last time we see the original three:  The Five Doctors -- which did have some great ""companion"" guest shots.)",1410480000,,660,4.7368421052631575

When Doctor Who was relaunched in 2005 with Christopher Eccleston, I became hooked once again.  Ever since the relaunch the series has just got better and better, and every actor chosen to play the Doctor since Christopher Eccleston in the relaunch has been perfect (including Chris).

50 years, and still going strong. Who remembers screaming spiders? As many fans know, you must forgive the inconstancies of the over-arching story lines and canons of the show. We all know of major rewriting of timelines and at times ignoring past events to make newer stories work. That is part of the show now. Sure this sometimes causes some fans to cry ""WHY?"", but it is for the sake of continuing the ride. Sometimes it paints itself into a corner, but we are willing to forgive a lot to have a little more of the Doctor.

The bad how Moffat sexist b.s. continue  with treatment of historical women by reducing them to love sick tweenager who falls in love with any man mainly the Doctor and have sex with them

And that last scene...with the great curator...I felt what could only be described as glee, arise from the within the inner recesses of my soul and burst out of my chest shining the light of a thousand sunshines, whilst glitter, twinkling stars and fairy dust rained down on me...
I feared my face would affix permanently with the smile that creeped involuntarily onto it...my eyes stung slightly from years of joy and love and mush and omg...this must be what true love feels like...

5964943,5,B00F37VHPM,"I was always confused by the various references to the Doctor's home planet, Gallifrey. At the same time, I have always loved it when two doctors appeared in the same show, working together and cooperating with each other to accomplish the greater good

Two of our Doctors get together through the machinations of a wormhole and a fez. They talk about the Doctor that nobody ever talks about, and lo and behold, that Doctor shows up, and together, they do accomplish something that none of them, or two of them, could have accomplished by himself or themselves.

Unfortunately, the Evil Doctor realizes that he will not remember the good he finally did when he returns back through time to the rest home where is is living out his years. (Sorry, I didn't get all the details about his elderly life, but maybe he was still living his elderly life because there was something good for him to accomplish before he regenerates, which he finally does.

If you enjoy Doctor Who, you will love this move.

5964964,4,B00F37VHPM,"I think I went into this expecting too much. I wanted to see all the living actors who played the doctor. I especially wanted to see Christopher Eccleston who could have done so much more with the role had he been there a few years. And I wanted to see Capt. Jack, Mickey, Martha and Donna. Maybe even Amy and Rory.

I'm a huge Dr. Who fan, so my expectations were tremendous,

I did get to see David Tennant and the magnificent Tom Baker, and Billie Piper. In fact, Tom Baker's appearance, was wonderful.

I also wanted an incredible plot that satisfied beyond the storyline. Something on the level of Star Wars.

Instead, I didn't understand everything. The ending seemed too easy. The funny parts weren't really funny. None of the doctors had a chance ti flex their skills.

In other words, it was very four-stars good, just not worth the buzz.

John Hurt, the ""War Doctor,"" so terrible he didn't use the Name, was  . . . kinda cuddly.  Then there was the awfully complex time travel business with Queen Elizabeth that I felt they didn't think through, and (SPOILER -- STOP READING.

5965016,5,B00F37VHPM,"When Doctor Who came to my attention on the American Public Broadcast System (the closest thing to the BBC in the USA) I was entranced with the idea of a hero dedicated to saving the human race. What made it exceptional to myself and many of my friends at the time was that ordinary young people from any time or place could join a great man and do exceptional things that helped the world and all of its people (I could make a difference, my friends could make a difference, all people could do more and be better).
Today, I watched ""The Day of the Doctor"" it was well executed, great portrayals, standard Dr Who story telling but with a new message for those of us who have become jaded and have accepted the world as it is, we can change ourselves and the world to be 'more better' (which is bad English but a great thought).
This Movie and the series to date may not be life changing, but they do represent great entertainment and their underlying messages may actually change lives if we let them.

5965085,4,B00F37VHPM,"This special was a great way to celebrate the 50th Anniversary. It captured a lot of the essence of the Doctor Who with several wonderful references. I especially like the interaction between two of the Doctors, one being my favorite. I wish it was longer and contained more references (particularly to some of the older Doctors), but there's only so much you can fit into a 25-minute episode.

5965095,5,B00F37VHPM,"Personally, this is my favorite episode of this great show. Not only is it a wonderful celebration of the longest running sci-fi show in history, but it stands alone as a phenomenally written and acted 90 minutes of television entertainment.

I'm not going to give away any plot details, if you've watched through Series 7 you have as much idea of the plot as you need. Suffice it to say, this is a paradigm-shifting episode. Steven Moffat could have easily just written a 'tribute' episode to celebrate the 50th anniversary, but he didn't. This is a riveting story that changes the entire direction of the show in an unexpected way.

And of course, it's wonderful to see the beloved 10th Doctor back in his pin-striped suit. David Tennant looks as if he never left, and his banter with Matt Smith's 11th Doctor is fantastic. There are some laugh out loud moments.

But the real hero of this episode, in my opinion, is Clara. Now that her 'mystery' from Series 7 is solved, she is finally able to break out and come into her own as a character and companion of the Doctor. Jenna Coleman is a great actress, but she really wasn't given much to work with as Clara in Series 7, and because of that many labeled her character as 'useless' and 'boring'. Not anymore.

If you are a Doctor Who fan, this is a must own. Happy 50th Doctor, here's to 50 more!",1405814400,,1349,4.493877551020408

Adventure in Space and Time was well done. I never knew any of what went on with the beginning of the series. I wonder how much was true and how much was fictional, but I'm glad I watched it.

He lived being tortured by the actions he did and we find that really he is a Doctor.  His goal is to heal and protect people.

Since the '80s I have watched Dr Who and I will continue. This show ranks permanently among the all time greats, The Bond pictures, Dirty Harry, The Prisoner, The Breakfast Club, Tron, The Matrix Trilogy, All fit to be marathon  binge watched any day any time, to name a few. But The Doctor, even if only in it's longevity, even with the BBC's confusion over it in the past, stands confidently as a beacon and a pillar in the history of entertainment. Referenced many times in many shows, Doctor Who is doing for video entertainment very much like what Jimi Hendrix did for the music industry. And with all of time and space to work with I have no doubt that Doctor Who will continue bringing us timeless television as long as time continues, if I may say so without sounding excessively presumptuous.

I was a little upset that the Ninth Doctor Christopher Eccelston decided not to appear but John Hurt did an excellent job as an addition. I recommend this to anyone who watches Doctor Who, looking forward to what the show offers next.",1402099200,,540,4.4646464646464645
5965178,5,B00F37VHPM,"First off, the DVD of THE DAY OF THE DOCTOR is crisp, the sound is clear and balanced nicely, and the color photography in the 1.85 format is beautiful.  Also, the color and sound on the bonus features, the documentary on the history of the actors who have portrayed the Doctor, and the two shorts, is likewise excellent.  On Blu, they are probably even better.

Now to the main feature: THE DAY OF THE DOCTOR.  The writing is top of the line, with only one false move (""I don't want to go""; it makes, to this viewer, that very emotional original moment with David Tennant a bit cheap). The bringing together of Smith and Tennant's Doctors with the addition of the War Doctor (asking John Hurt to play the ""wearing a bit thin"", battle-ravaged Doctor was inspired), makes for drama, and, yes, comedy, which only DOCTOR WHO can do.  Thank you for bringing back Billie Piper, even if she is not playing Rose Tyler. And I loved the Curator.

You have to pay close attention to the story to grasp all the plot threads, but is it so, so rewarding upon several viewings.  This is one of those DOCTOR WHO outings which has a plot ""complicated enough for children, but simple enough for adults"".  Everyone on the production worked very, very hard to get this right, from the director to all the actors to the production designers to the costumers to the digital creators.  And, of course, Murray Gold's music does it again.  Kudos all around for making this very special 50th Anniversary episode one which could have easily been a major theatrical release as well.

AND we get a quick look at the new Doctor, the marvelous Peter Capaldi, whom I've followed since LOCAL HERO.  Once again, a fine actor who has also been a faithful Whovian since he was a boy.  Great choice!",1402012800,,1763,4.5587301587301585

5965181,5,B00F37VHPM,"We saw this in the theater in November when it came out and absolutely loved seeing it in 3D.  We just bought a Sony 65X900A 4K 3D TV at less than half price along with a Sony BDP-S6200 3D blu-ray player and it absolutely blew our minds how good it looked with both devices upscaling to near-4K crisp and clear ghost-free 3D perfection.  [NO sarcasm intended]

The content was entertaining and its usual schizophrenic self vacillating between somber drama and slapstick comedy, but the 3D sold it more than nearly any other Doctor Who episode I've seen in the past nine years.  Continuing to watch the series in 2D in the future is a letdown, as BBC has stated that this was a one-time trial run for a 3D episode.  If you get a chance, watch this 3D blu-ray on this amazing 3D TV for an experience you'll not soon forget!!!!!!",1401667200,,826,4.443708609271523

I wanted this so that I can download it to my tablet for down time at an airport or for one of ""those"" nights when sleep just won't come.

5965208,5,B00F37VHPM,"This was truly an exceptional piece of screenwriting. Every bit of dialogue for Tennant's return and Piper's return were phenomenal. The War Doctor's reaction to who the doctor was before and after helps reconcile the two incarnations of the program and still makes for a brilliant, fun, engaging, witty story. Moffat still majorly lacks in the sci-fi department, trying to go further than he can handle into explaining paradoxes, forgetting ""rules"" he attempts to set up, and becoming too contrived much of the time. But his ability to write engaging narrative and witty dialogue far outshines any detriments. Well worth the hype and the money.",1399939200,,645,5.152380952380953

Tennant, Smith, and Hurt make a great team that ties up some loose ends that pertain to the Time War while weaving a story that deals with decisions that we have made in the past and how something that seemed good at the time may not have been such a great idea.  In a crisis we have all made good and bad decisions and the best way to move on...whoops I almost gave something away.  you better just quit reading my review and go purchase this delightful tale and make up your own mind.

I really loved this episode; it was so well done and pulled in a number of the Doctors, even if only via old television clips.  I'm really looking forward to the direction the show is going in.",1398384000,,386,4.5
5965234,5,B00F37VHPM,"When the initial buzz over ""The Day of The Doctor"" started, this old Whovian had moments of pure joy and moments of great fear.  Would Moffat and company dash the rich history of classic Who on the rocks in order to appease new Whovians and hipsters who only watch the  show because they find one of the Doctors attractive?  Or would he actually pay homage to the men who have portrayed this brilliant character before Matt Smith and David Tennant?  I'm happy to admit that Moffat and the gang at the BBC did a brilliant job of blending the two together to give old fans, new fans, and wannabes a happy compromise.

Without giving anything away, ""The Day of the Doctor"" is brilliant.  Smith, who in my opinion is the best of the new Doctors, is in top form here.  He's a bit silly, a bit oafish, and very centered.  Tennant, another fine Doctor, brings his combination of smugness, pop-culture referenced, brooding attitude to the show and doesn't skip a beat when he slides back into his old trainers.  Billie Piper also returns, but not necessarily as Rose.  Jenna-Louise Coleman tags along as Clara, and proves to be the grounding point for all three of the Doctors in this episode.  Wait?  Did I just say, ""three?""  Absolutely.  John Hurt appears as the ""War Doctor,"" who did something so vile that #9-11 have done all they can to blot his actions and his existence out of their minds.  He is the Doctor that does what must be done, and this episode focuses on his moral dilemma.

The entire episode plays out brilliantly.  It has just enough of everything in it, from comedy to fear and suspense to silliness.  For older fans like myself, there's also some wonderful nods to the past, and I dare not say another word about them in case I spoil the show for anyone.  Just know that by the end of the tale, you'll be smiling from ear to ear, or crying, or both.

I love the renewed interest that has hit Doctor Who.  I love the energy of the young fans and the happiness that fills many of the old fans' hearts.  As with any franchise, there are those who hop on the bandwagon only to bail once the newest thing comes along.  They'll be gone soon enough.  For now, let's enjoy the ride!",1398384000,,2189,4.442211055276382

5965248,5,B00F37VHPM,"So cliche but I laughed and I cried and will watch it over and over again. Even though I didn't get all of the references as die hard Whovians would, I must say I was still entertained. While I'm sure many would say they would have loved to see Christopher Eccelson, I did too but having David Tennant, Matt Smith, and John Hurt together on screen more than made up for it, together such a class act!!!! I appreciate that the actors, writers and crew really do take into account the fans and it shows on the screen. I had to work so I didn't  get to see it on the big screen which is somewhat better because I had it all to myself. I can't think of any show in the US that will ever have that level of commitment. The fact that Doctor Who celebrated 50th years is astounding.",1397692800,,775,4.132450331125828

David Tennant reasserted himself as my favorite Dr, but I felt a little let down by the plot and the overall affect.  After the high of season 6 and the beginning of season 7, I felt that they could have packed some more umph into it.
But being a huge Whovian, I can't complain.  I got to see my favorite Dr again!",1397606400,,447,3.933333333333333

Although I had seen some of the pre 2005 episodes and liked them, the story of the destruction of the Time Lords always eluded me. This movie provides a bit of the context and introduces a new time lord. The interaction between the three Dr. Who was phenomenal and was throughly enjoyable. I am a sucker for a happy ending and this one that many will find critical to the Dr. Who timeline.

As usual the acting is average but that's not why you watch the series. Its the incredibly intelligent stories involving a character that is perhaps the best ever created for science fiction. I highly recommend it. The doctor thinks his way out of this calamity instead of doing the usual thing that the vast majority of science fiction protagonists do (Pull out a deadly weapon and mercilessly destruct their opponents.).

5965269,5,B00F37VHPM,"So it has come to this...for 50 years, Doctor Who has graced our TV screens, books, comics, audio plays and more, but now the Doctor--or should I say Doctors--face what has been their biggest problem for nearly 9 years now, the Time War. The ultimate, heart-wrenching moment in Doctor Who mythos (right up there with the show's cancellation, or 'long rest' in 1989) that changed everything about who the Doctor is and what he can accomplish. The Name of the Doctor started this trilogy, leading up to the 50th Anniversary and Holiday specials, by introducing us to the unknown Doctor who fought or at least lived through the Time War (We don't actually see him fighting, but he looks like a survivor) as portrayed by John Hurt. Here we come to the Moment, where the War Doctor (as we call him) has to decide whether or not he should destroy Gallifrey, and we get...an unexpected Moment, a Moment that changes everything as well.

That Moment is Billie Piper as Rose/Bad Wolf and it seems fitting when, yes, she was the first person who appeared in the New Series of Doctor Who, launching it to critical acclaim and worldwide, enormous popularity. After all, Ian and Barbara were among the first people who appeared in Doctor Who, although the very first was that policeman; the companions are the ones who started it all, in a sense. She is the one who helps the War Doctor see what becomes of his decision, introducing him to the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors. Clara accompanies Eleven to the National Gallery to investigate a mysterious painting left behind by Queen Elizabeth, enjoying a picnic with Ten before some Zygons crash the party and start messing things up. Ten and Eleven, in the midst of all this, aren't too thrilled to have the War Doctor around when he is a painful reminder of their past, but neither of them are aware that the past is in flux, and currently, the Moment is right to change everything.",1396569600,,1917,4.671597633136095

The story was filmed in 3D, and it actually uses this in the storyline. It's not just the usual ""ooh look, things are popping out of the screen"" party trick. Enjoy it here in this episode. The BBC announced that ""The Day of the Doctor"" would be their last 3D television production. There aren't any US companies of note doing 3D television production.

Unfortunately, the DW discs have become increasingly thin with the extras. This one is no exception, so I downgraded the rating. Considering it's the golden anniversary, I was expecting a feature-packed disc set. In particular, I was hoping they would provide ""The Five(ish) Doctors,"" a great comic piece starring Peter Davison, Collin Baker, Sylvester McCoy, Paul McGann, (the recorded voice of) Tom Baker, and former cast and crew. It was only available online on BBC for about two weeks and I was hoping to see it again. I'm also the sort of geek who enjoys good commentaries and in-depth making-of documentaries.

5965309,5,B00F37VHPM,"I'm always skeptical about TV shows that bring back characters that have died or been written out permanently. Even though this epic special does start out with a few contrived moments to make the show open with a bit of excitement and humor (which I thought didn't really work), it quickly moves into a storyline that both works, makes sense, and really goes into the Doctor's emotional development throughout the series. As a big fan of John Hurt, I was bound to like his role in it, but he brought a depth and a humanity to the war doctor that I hadn't expected. As someone who doesn't like Billie Piper (don't flame me for that, it's a personal taste that you won't change my mind about), I was happy to see that her role was limited and she wasn't, strictly speaking, playing Rose. In some ways, I actually liked her performance - it was enigmatic and powerful, even though I would have rather not had her there since it did feel gimmicky to have the Doctor interacting with a person he had not yet met. So many questions that were started at the beginning of the series and nearly answered throughout, but never fully were, are answered and are made to feel like a real part of the Doctor's history, not like (as I had feared before seeing it) a gimmick to go overboard on Doctor Who 50th anniversary celebrations. And the special is very exciting, funny, and clever. They managed to work out a way that was not contrived or gimmicky to bring back all of the past and one of the future Doctors and it was an epic moment that I will always love. If you like Moffat's Doctor Who, this special is almost certainly perfect for you.",1394323200,2,1633,4.446666666666666

It is for Doctor Who fans that the Special really shines -- LOTS of references paying homage to the 50 years of Doctor Who history.  They aren't forced and shouldn't be distracting when you don't get the reference.  I'm not into spoilers, so I'll let you find them yourself (or look them up online).

5965341,5,B00F37VHPM,"First, we found out just what happened in the end of the Time War.  We kind of knew it already, from the last episodes of David Tennant's time as the Doctor.  But in The Day of the Doctor we learn about just how guilty he felt about it.  To the point where he refused to even allow himself to even hold the title of Doctor.  It makes more sense when you watch the special.
I am not a big fan of Rose but, funny enough, Billie Piper played Bad Wolf, so that's okay.  We get to see the Daleks and even see the Zygons back in action.  And we get to visit the Time Lords again.
Now, we get to see two new Time Lords.  John Hurt, a favorite actor of mine, who has brought many wonderful and horrible parts to life.  He played Smith in my favorite version of Nineteen Eighty-Four, so I don't mean he was horrible at it, it is just a dark piece.
He plays a wonderful Doctor, old and tired and bitter and making a decision that will change the very universe itself.
We also get a glimpse of the future, and last, Doctor.  Well, his eyes and eyebrows.
There is a lot of humor and the interaction between Hurt, Smith, and Tennant is wonderful.  It is always nice to see scenes where the Doctors get together.
The Zygon sub-plot isn't that bad either and they do a good job of keeping the whole story moving without any bumps in the road and without over using special effects. And there is a surprise guest at the ending, which was very nice if not explained.  So, in fact we get five Doctors.  Enjoy!",1393286400,,1491,4.156794425087108

5965374,5,B00F37VHPM,"Based on his writing for television, one imagines that Steven Moffat's enjoys puzzles in whatever spare time his professional commitments allow. On the sitcom Coupling, Moffat showed a great affinity for making seemingly disparate pieces come together into a satisfying whole, often by playing around with time. Not surprisingly, this approach has been even more thoroughly explored in his writing for Doctor Who.

Following his relatively straightforward first story* with the ""empty child"", Moffat has taken the time travel aspect of the show and run with it like no other writer in Doctor Who's 50 year history. From his first script for David Tennant's Doctor to the overarching story-lines of his time as the show's lead writer, time has been a key element of the narrative puzzles he's assembled. This was true even of the 2007 mini-episode ""Time Crash"", produced for the BBC's Children in Need charity event, which presented a brief meeting between David Tennant's Doctor and his 1980s predecessor, Peter Davison.

In some ways that brief interlude was good practice for yesterday's special episode for the show's 50th anniversary, ""Day of the Doctor"". Having the current Doctor meet his former selves was done to mark both the 10th and 20th anniversaries of the show and, despite the show not being on TV at the time, the 30th and 40th as well^. This precedent of celebrating the past in a way virtually no other show can added a particularly tricky piece to the puzzle, because while these stories had their moments none could be classified as one of Doctor Who's finest hours.
After an uneven run of stories that culminated in ""The Name of the Doctor"", I had my doubts as to how well Moffat would succeed at crafting a puzzle whose pieces included

-celebrating Doctor Who's past in a way longtime fans would appreciate but didn't require decades worth of background knowledge for everyone else to enjoy.
-displaying the fun parts of multi-Doctor stories without succumbing to the pitfalls that made previous ones less than great.
-fostering optimism about a 60th anniversary (and beyond).

My doubts gave way to anticipation a little over a week before ""Day of the Doctor"" aired, thanks to one of two prequels that had been announced for the story. What made ""Night of the Doctor"" so good was not that it gave longtime fans like myself what we wanted, particularly a return appearance as the Doctor by Paul McGann, but rather that it did so in unexpected ways. In a little under seven minutes, Moffat managed to subvert our assumptions about some key elements of the show's mythology while also telling a sharply written story about gut-wrenching choices. It also helped explain how John Hurt as the mysterious ""War Doctor"" fits into the larger story.

The idea of a missing incarnation seemed to annoy a lot of hardcore fans, especially when it was announced that none of the show's pre-2005 Doctors would be in the anniversary episode. Despite three of those actors being dead and none of the others except McGann and (to a lesser extent) Davison looking much like they did when they were the current Doctor, an awful lot of these ""fans"" prejudged the story as a disappointment solely based on Tennant being the only established past Doctor in it. This attitude is amusing in retrospect because it was having John Hurt as this newly revealed Doctor that made the multi-Doctor element work in a way that I can't envision any of Tennant's and Smith's predecessors doing.

Because he represented a shadowy period in the Doctor's story before the one that started with Christopher Eccleston's Doctor in ""Rose"", Hurt was able to embody the Doctor's entire past. On the one hand, his jabs at Tennant and Smith harkened back to William Hartnell putting his successors in line in ""The Three Doctors"", but he also personified the tension between who the Doctor was, who he's become and who he should be. More to the point, having an actor of Hurt's calibre seemed to push Tennant and especially Smith out of their comfort zones. The end result is that a story that could have been a shallow and incoherent mess feels believable on a character level, which enabled me to enjoy the icing on the cake all the more.

Admittedly, not all of the icing was to my taste. The war scenes on Gallifrey felt a bit too ""Star Wars"" for my liking, presumably intended to give more 3-D bang for the buck (or rather quid), but the return of the Zygons and seeing UNIT led by Kate Lethbridge-Stewart was great fun. Needless to say, it was also fantastic to see that the line about no pre-2005 Doctors appearing wasn't quite true either, and seeing a glimpse of incoming Doctor Peter Capaldi was a terrific touch.

And then there's an element that's simply beyond objective assessment for a fan of my generation, Tom Baker.
Baker declined to appear in the 20th anniversary story ""The Five Doctors"", in which he was only seen in footage from ""Shada"". Coming just two years after the end of his 7 year run as the Doctor, that decision wasn't surprising, though, Baker later said he regretted it and in recent years seems to have re-embraced Doctor Who. Seeing him as the museum curator who may or may not be another version of the Doctor may not have made total sense but here again on the level of character it worked, providing that elusive piece of the puzzle whose final form looks even cooler than you imagined.

-----
*Technically, Moffat's first script for Doctor Who was a 1999 charity sketch called ""The Curse of the Fatal Death"" starring Rowan Atkinson as the Doctor and Jonathan Pryce as the Master. Like all the best parodies, it also worked as a good example of the thing it was spoofing.
^There a lot I could write quite a bit about both the 1993 Doctor Who/Eastenders crossover ""Dimensions in Time"" and the audio drama ""Zagreus"", but I'll leave it at saying that both were done in good spirit but neither is especially good.",1392249600,,5922,4.798039215686274

5965382,5,B00F37VHPM,I really loved the way this 50 year special came together it blended wonderfully how it tied in Rose Tyler who was a very important character I loved the interaction of the 3 Doctors and the way they saved there home planet and brought back all of the past Doctors. In the end where the curly haired scarf wearing Doctor meet the 12th Doctor in the museum was a good touch and now I am looking forward to seeing the Doctor look for his home world that is frozen in an instant in time.,1391990400,,484,4.159574468085107
5965383,5,B00F37VHPM,"I don't know how many people could be more stoked about this 50th Anniversary Special than me.  But then, I'm betting every review makes the same claim.  I'm not going to get too much into the story, since by now you already know what it is, or I'm going to spoil it for you.  So I'll get to the pros at cons.

Pros:
1. If you do not yet have a 3D player and 3D TV, this still comes with a 2D version.  So if you ever upgrade, you don't have to buy this again.  And for those that have the ability to see this in 3D at home, you will not be disappointed.

2. The two prequels are included

3. The making of special is also included, which was aired in the theatres.  It's called ""Behind the Lens"", is voiced over by Colin Baker, and is roughly 15 mins long.

Cons:
1. No commentary.  SERIOUSLY?!?  How could there NOT be one of these on this monumental achievement in Doctor Who history?  I think that they are holding out on this, and will include it in a later release to get people to buy this again.

2. Extra excerpts that were in the theater were not included, such as the 10th and 11th Doctors explaining 3D, and Stark explaining theater etiquette.  Again, possibly another hold out?

Personally, I really enjoyed the story.  It has the sometimes over complicated Steven Moffatt bits and pieces, but that's to be expected.  But if you have been a fan of the new series, this simply is a MUST HAVE.

I know this review is brief compared to my other Doctor Who reviews.  And while I could have made this a huge read through by adding spoilers, highlighting the good and not so good parts, but again, I think most people already know the story.

2-19-14 UPDATE:  Yup.  Just as I expected, a Collector's Edition is scheduled to be released, date yet unknown.  The 2 extra features there were in the theater will be included, and a deleted scene.  I would not be surprised if a commentary is added as well.

I originally titled this review as a MUST HAVE, but now I say to wait, since a better version with more extras is on its way.  I'm REALLY PISSED, and want my money back.",1391990400,5,2079,4.264102564102564
5965384,3,B00F37VHPM,"3D Blu-ray Experience:

This is highly recommended if you are looking for a good 3D Blu-ray. I was pleasantly surprised at the high quality of the 3D. Because all 3D is expensive, I was not bothered by the price as some reviewers are. It is good to see something other than a made-for-the-theater 3D movie.

Dr. Who Episode:

The best thing about the content of the episode is that, like most Dr. Who, it is very family friendly. For a Dr. Who episode it was just okay, My 10 year-old girl loved it. Clara is a big hit with her generation. For me, a good Dr. Who episode has a well structured plot with a clever twist that revolves around some sort of interesting science fiction innovation that either expands a well known sci-fi concept or introduces a new one. But that is the ""old"" or ""original"" Dr. Who formula. We don't get much of that anymore. The latest series rely on visual and aural dramatics. The bad guys who are almost always daleks -- which inexplicably have not been upgraded from their aged and dated inverted Rubbermaid trashcan look.

The soundtrack is a loop of the dramatic sounding Dr Who theme music that plays throughout the episode. In lieu of true suspense or drama; there are frequent battle scenes with innumerable narrow escapes; each more contrived and difficult to suspend disbelief than the last. And of course, there is heavy reliance on referencing past episodes including appearances by former characters. This is clearly an attempt to tug at the heart strings but instead falls flat as you can see through the transparent attempt to provoke an emotional response but instead invokes sentimentalism which does not last very long.",1391990400,2,1665,4.750865051903114

5965399,5,B00F37VHPM,"OK, so I was one of the folks who bought advanced tickets to see the 3-D version at the local multiplex.  Great time!  Having an audience around you to react to the things you love about this anniversary special just makes the experience so much more fun.  This is my souvenir keepsake, if you will.

The reason I'm giving it five stars is for the inclusion of ""Night of the Doctor,"" the glorious return of Paul McGann into the filmed Whoniverse.  Now I happened to like his movie; don't care what the haters said, he was really the best thing about it, and I loved his gentle start in the role.  Now that we see him again, he's had his Big Finish adventures to really give him a deep grounding in his iteration of the Doctor, so you see a man completely at ease as he attempts to rescue a young gunship pilot from a difficult situation.  Six and a half minutes of Eight is better than certain problematic episodes featuring Nine, Ten, and Eleven.  Admit it, although we love the Doctor, not every episode of New Who, or Classic Who for that matter, has been a winner.  As much as I enjoyed ""The Day of the Doctor,"" and it was celebratory and fun, ""Night of the Doctor"" was my favorite part of the 50th anniversary celebrations.

Re, DotD, it's great seeing David Tennant back in action, although his face is a little fuller (guess he wasn't doing nearly as much running since he left Who).  He has great chemistry with Matt Smith, and their scene forcing peace negotiations between humans and Zygons was priceless.  All proclamations by Steven Moffat aside, I really resented John Hurt's presence as the War Doctor.  Too much of a gimmick.  Since Christopher Eccelston couldn't be convinced to return to the role, by all rights, Paul McGann should have had the opportunity to have been the Doctor we thought wiped out both the Time Lords and the Daleks.  Moffat's ultimate solution in the last 20 minutes  was creative and celebratory - the noise in the theater reminded me of the first time I saw the original Star Wars in '77, with Han Solo's return at the climax of the Death Star assault.  Just as then, an explosion of fans cheering and hollering as each of their favorite Doctors appeared on the screen, and another explosive reaction at the surprise introduction of some rather wicked eyebrows.

While watching the DVD alone at home isn't quite as much fun as the communal experience of the cinema, it's still an enjoyable way to pass an evening celebrating the Doctor.  The ""making of"" feature that was shown in our cinema after TDotD was included (smooches to you too, Paul McGann), so that was fun.  What I wish they had included on the DVD was the short introduction film, featuring Strax demonstrating how Sontorans treat cinema-goers who talk on the phone or try recording the film on their phones - brilliant - transitioning to Matt Smith and David Tennant preparing the audience for the 12-D - uh - 3-D experience.  Here's hoping that it ends up on the Series 8 DVD package.  Very nice that both a Blue Ray and a DVD were included in this set, so I can watch the DVD on my laptop.  A lot of fun.  Now go sign the petition on Change.org so that Paul McGann can get more filmed appearances as the Eighth Doctor!",1391558400,5,3225,4.520689655172414

5965403,1,B00F37VHPM,"Trying to avoid spoilers, I had heard very generally what the plot was going to be for the 50th anniversary special, and was cautiously optimistic because it had potential to be very good.  On the potential downside, I figured there were two ways to resolve it, one of which would be deeply disappointing in my mind.

First off, the plot wasn't anything close to what I was led to expect, opting for a much less epic story.  Second, it is very slow moving.  Even at roughly the halfway point, I was wondering when they were going to get past the setup and start the plot.  The climax was, well, anticlimactic.  It felt like ""Well, we're almost out of time, we should probably wrap this up.""  Lastly, when they did resolve the minor, but heavily promoted, secondary plot they chose the bad ending.

Long story short, save your money.  This is 75 minutes of my life I'm not getting back.",1391472000,4,885,4.515723270440252

5965418,3,B00F37VHPM,"Definitely recommend all things Doctor Who, but pricing for the important things here are a bit pricier than expected and I've become extremely weary of amazon's season passes.  I love saving a little by just buying who seasons at once or episodes as they come out with a season pass, but Amazon seems to include things that are extra (should be free, like trailers) at a cost that you are forced to buy with a season pass.  This often negates the savings and leaves you better off just buying the episodes individually.

There is the usual nuttiness, incredible science, and even a wedding tossed in.  (You have to wonder if River Song knows about that one.)  The Doctors play off each other beautifully and work as a team in ways that only a time traveler could possibly do.  (Of course they get into problems that only a time traveler could get into, but that's all history now.  Or maybe it is future history now.  English does not have the verb tenses necessary.)

5965430,5,B00F37VHPM,"This story is amongst the top five of any Doctor Who story bar none. The absolute attention to detail alone and the way it tied in events that loosely or otherwise were connected was done so very well, even my wife who casually watches new Who with me from time to time (no pun) said how impressed she was with how they were able to have so much attention to detail.

For me it was great to finally see why the Zygon's home planet was lost - answer time war, nice way to fill in that gap after so many years. The Eighth Doctor's regeneration was finally shown in what I can only describe as such a treat in the Night of the Doctor and showed after 18 years how Paul McGann is still and always will be such a good Doctor and his only episode in 1996 was such a waste, but we got to finally see his end, so at least we now have a beginning and finale for him - closure of sorts finally. The idea of paintings in the background of the main feature was a good ploy to show how the Zygons and indeed Gallifrey survived to re-enter our world, like the idea of Galiferian art capturing one moment in time, ha moment! The interaction between David Tennant and Matt Smith were fabulous and the addition of the gravitas of John Hurt who also seamlessly jumps in as the War Doctor, adding an older voice to the typical multi-doctor bickering and self appreciation.

But what a treat at the end, Tom Baker as the mysterious curator and to see all the doctors up to Matt Smith in his dream sequence paying homage again to the past.

The production of the whole story here shows how grand it was in the eyes of those that made it, it felt like a feature rather than an episode but didn't lose it's British TV background, which the 1996 outing for Paul McGann I think did.

I watched this finally with my wife in late Jan 2014, so was very good in waiting all that time but could tell despite her really trying to absorb and understand some very fan related things she thoroughly enjoyed it too, which I think was the point, die hard fans like me loving it and non-fans also appreciating it too. Like the art it showcased, a masterpiece!

The extras are fabulous, not much - but great additions, the history of Doctor Who is fantastic (no pun on 9) and has some great interviews with new and old to look at the whole 50 years of the show and being narrated by Colin Baker makes it all the more special as he is sort of half-way in the history of it all. The making of the 50th shows how absolutely secret the whole operation had been, and it was appreciated so surprises could be had. The mini episodes - and referring to the Night of the Doctor specifically - are worth their weight in gold and to me are added to the list of full episodes and show what Paul could have been on TV if used right, thank you Steven Moffatt for that one at least, I was one happy fan when the internet showed this one, and finally seeing it fulfilled my Whology in ways I cannot tell you.

5965436,5,B00F37VHPM,"This is for the mini-episode 102, The Night of The Doctor.

It's full of action, and as with many of the episodes of the new Doctor Who there are callbacks and even characters, groups and factions from Classic Doctor to give it a feeling of continuity regardless of the several years gap between Classic and New Doctor Who. My first Doctor was Tom Baker, so I go back a ways as a fan of the BBC programme.

This mini-episode was delightful if a bit strange for something truly miraculous that happened toward the beginning.  The Sisters of Karn were almost forgotten since they only appeared in one episode that I can recall.

At the end of this episode, even thought I knew how it would end (sort of) with the appearance of a familiar face, I still felt a pang of sorrow at the fate of Cass. I find myself feeling that more and more as I grow older. I'm trying not to create spoilers. But so much had to be packed into a 7 minute episode that nearly everything is s spoiler.

How the Warrior came to be is enlightening. I would dearly love to see more of John Hurt as the doctor. Sure, the fame of the actor goes against the ethos of the producers who choose relative unknowns (Chris Ecclestone notwithstanding) for the Doctor and his companions. John Hurt as the Doctor would be a time of true delight for most DW fans.  It is outstanding to see Paul McGann as the Doctor again after his one appearance as DW as Sylvester McCoy's Doctor changed into Mr. McGann.  He's never even had one full episode as The Doctor. And it would be great to see more of him in the role.

Doctor Who didn't have to do what it did with Matt Smith. They could go back in time to fill out the doctor as Paul McGann and even build on John Hurt as the doctor (I'd do John Hurt first since he's not getting any younger).  I can see several more seasons playing out as sidelines for those two doctors as we follow them into their lives from a brush with a current doctor.

This episode left me wanting so much more. I wanted to know the fate of Cass and perhaps even to see her as a companion. I think she would be brilliant as a companion even though the doctor's current companion is absolutely gorgeous (smart, fiesty, pretty, sexy, and lively). The two women would overshadow any man on screen. So, one would have to go. Either one of them would give any man a challenge to not be overshadowed by her on screen (or off).

I don't know if this mini-episode is a way to explain something unseen before now or may be a glimpse into the future of Doctor Who. Either way, I want more of it and the people playing those roles. This is simply smashing.",1390867200,2,2625,4.282828282828283

The story line is so reminiscent of the crazy ""timey-wimey"" we have come to expect from Doctor Who show.

You will laugh you rear off, love the twists and turns and David Tennant and Matt Smith so  make this perfect, as we expect and John Hurt makes a great War Doctor.

Was glad to see Billie Piper (Rose Tyler) in this commemorative episode of Doctor Who and Jenna Coleman really ties it all together with her quirkiness.

And of course, true, diehard Doctor Who fans will love the references and characters from the past 50 years.  It really is a tie in to all of the years and celebrates in true fashion, the intent and fun of Doctor Who.  The craziness is just a wonderful bonus.

The 3 Doctors together make it worth watching alone, the writing is great and the action perfect and bringing old foes back and even other characters gives you a sense of rightness for this being a show piece movie for Doctor Who.",1390608000,5,1038,4.276923076923077

I have to address for your satisfaction !?!  Now, back to Doctor Who, I have watched this dvd over 10 times and I still enjoy it like the
first time.  Casting John Hurt  was excellent,  using a little bit of Dickens "" A  Christmas Carol"" to save the tradition of the Doctor was
a very entertaining idea.  And how the devil they got Tom Baker to do an appearance is mind staggering and it only serves to make
the story that much better.  In conclusion a fantastic story featuring a hero that does it with style.

Also, the way Moffat has always been able to link, even with a word, to the older Doctors...We will ALL miss Matt Smith, as we did David Tennant, as we did Eccleston...and on and on.  (oops, showing my age here!).  As fans of Doctor Who since....oh, since god was a boy I suppose, this special befits a show that has lasted 50 years, a character that for all practical purposes really does exist, and the adventures, the memories...and the memories yet to be made.  GO FOR IT!  You will not be diasppointed.  And keep watching this one...there are layers like the world's largest onion down in there.  Allons-y ya'll!",1389744000,,1036,4.959302325581396

5965524,5,B00F37VHPM,"The 50th anniversary special was a triumph--I'm not actually in favor of multi-Doctor stories, but this one was actually a story, an actual plot.  And the story was a superb one.  I've been expecting Moffat to fix the Time War issue, and he did it!  Smith and Tennant play off each other as if they'd been a double act for years:  they perfectly capture the idea that, essentially, they are the same person, no matter the incarnation.

My only complaint about this DVD was the DVD itself:  I often run into problems with defective BBC DVDs, and this one was yet another....Amazon replaced it promptly, and I'm hoping the new DVD works properly.  The issue with the DVDs is so prevalent that, when I buy a DVD of a BBC show, I expect that the first purchase will be defective and that I'll be getting a replacement.

Not only is it a nostalgia trip touching on elements of the last 50 years (with tons of Easter eggs for the devoted fan) it also stands on its own as a very good story and setting the stage for the next season.  And defintiely check out the web episodes included on the disk.

A fair to good effort for a feature film as far as the 3-D goes and I know if it had been made for the big screen I would be more critical but I can honestly say it can meet or beat most Marvel films in 3- D. Focus especially in the beginning is not good but most of the show is clean. Directors just have to be artistic instead of focusing on what 3-D is about.,1389139200,,494,3.669811320754717

5965573,5,B00F37VHPM,"This was a fun episode.  It contains the main feature episode, plus two additional scenes (less than 5 minutes each) that give a bit of extra context to some of the things that happened a bit earlier in season seven.  Without spoiling anything too specific, if you've been following Doctor Who since Amy Pond and Rory left, this effectively ties up all of the loose ends from Matt Smith's tenure as well as a few lingering questions from the first few seasons of this recent run of the show.  I hear they are making another season to be released in summer or fall 2014, with a new actor taking over the lead role from Matt Smith (you do get a tiny glimpse of the new guy in this one), but really I feel like this episode could serve as an end to the show... so if you're looking for closure as an excuse to walk away from the show this could be it.  Pfff...nah, if you're buying Doctor Who on DVD it's because you don't want it to end, so nevermind.  ;)

This features a collaboration of three of the doctors for most of the story (Matt Smith, David Tennant, and John Hurt) but there are a few scenes involving ALL of the other Doctors in various incarnations.  And there's a glimpse at the Doctor's possible retirement plans featuring an old fan favorite, too.

All in all, yeah 20 bucks is a bit much to spend on a single episode but if you're going to spend it on one episode it might as well be this one.  It's the 50th anniversary special, and it's fun.  It explores some of the Doctor's choices during the Time War as well as a certain marriage proposal, so we get to know our favorite time-traveling scientist/hero a little better, too.",1388966400,,1643,4.339869281045751

How can I have a kid, but the mother died before giving birth?  This is a sample of what they did and youll have to watch it to know what is there are no spoolers here.

5965637,5,B00F37VHPM,"The only thing I felt a bit sad about is that Chris didn't come back for the 50th. As I started watching Doctor who in 2012 on netflix, I started with chris really awesome performance that left me wanting more. It was way too short his run and at least a hello would suffice. Other than that David and Matt were just Fantastic! The hints and easter eggs were many, and most enjoyable. I even cried of joy for seeing that they put all 13 TARDIS capsules to come and save the day.

Again Matt and David performance together was great! Seeing David again brought back good memories of his run. I got so used to Matt's run though that I felt it was pleasant to feel Matt really sealed his Doctor connection towards me. This is why I felt really sad about his leave in the recent episode. I wish he could of done one more season. It was way too short compared to Davids. So this special leaves me satisfied with both playing together in an adventure. Hopefully in a different incarnation, both actors can do something together outside of being doctors.

Hurt did a marvelous job as being the grumpy War Doctor/X Doctor too, as too Billie really made that Bad Wolf energy flow throughout time mean something. Who knows what she did in other parts of the universe?! It's perfect use of that story tool indeed! Everything meshes together even though to some it just doesn't make sense lol

So again I'm really happy about this collection set as well, knowing what's going on behind the scenes is always wonderful info to me.

all of it! it's just awesome. I wish I could of been a Doctor who fan earlier in my life, but all things come in there place.

5965644,5,B00F37VHPM,"An entertaining 50th anniversary special, ""The Day of the Doctor"" brings together the 10th (David Tennant) and 11th (Matt Smith) incarnations of The Doctor together with the previously introduced War Doctor (John Hurt).

SPOILERS:

The War Doctor fought in and ended the Time War between the Time Lords and the Daleks by destroying the galaxy. ""The Day of the Doctor"" takes place in three time periods on two worlds--the 11th Doctor receives a call from UNIT when figures from a 3D painting depicting the end of Gallifrey disappear.

The 10th Doctor tries to stop the Zygons from shape shifting into Queen Elizabeth (during the Elizabethian period) and changing the timeline.

All three end up in the Elizabethian period to try prevent the Zygons from taking over Earth while the War Doctor debates whether or not to end the lives of two races as part of the Time War. Capped with an appearance by Tom Baker, the special does a terrific job of resetting elements of the series (and also sets up elements for Smith's Christmas episode that closed off his appearance as The Doctor).

END OF SPOILERS:

Featuring cameo appearances by a variety of past Who cast members, ""The Day of the Doctor"" looks exceptional in a 1080p high def presentation with a terrific 5.1 audio mix.

The special features include two mini-episodes. The first ""Night of the Doctor"" features a surprise and delightful appearance of Paul McGann (the 8th Doctor who appeared in the TV movie ""Doctor Who"" from the 1990's). It provides a critical link the arrival of the War Doctor played by John Hurt.

The second mini-episode focuses on the attack of Arcadia the city on the planet Gallifrey where the War Doctor activated the device to end the Time War.

We also get a very good behind-the-scenes featurette on the production of the episode with plenty of comments from Tennant, Smith and the other returning cast members.

This is a terrific 50th anniversary special and the mini-episode ""Night of the Doctor"" delightfullly ties everything together and allows McGann to appear as The Doctor again.

Highly recommended!",1388275200,,2089,4.94

All the bits of the puzzle fit together.  yes, I could find some nits to pick if I tried hard enough but the story was so strong, hit all the right emotional notes, had excellent characterization, tied in to so much Who history in both big and little ways, that whatever complaints I might have fade into something insignificant.

I kept myself 'unspoiled' for this episode and I'm glad I did. It's surprises were really surprises (especially that last one!).  This is probably the best of any of the annivesary specials.  Great for any long time Who fan, but also a strong story for someone who is not familiar with the show.

I am familiar with the story and this was my first experience to watch an episode all the way through. What grabs you is the brilliant writing, the way it deals with complex anomalies in simplified ways and terms. And while being humorous, it deals with serious issues such as the use of WMDs, the decision to sacrifice innocence to stop evil.

The characters were splendid. I understand there was talk about Helen Mirren  playing the title role. Now that would indeed make me a ""whoey.""",1388275200,,569,4.461538461538462

5965658,5,B00F37VHPM,"There are very few TV shows I watch any more. US TV shows leave me flat and uninterested but British TV has always been interesting to me. The BBC really puts out some quality shows that are engaging and brilliantly written. Sherlock, Copper,, Torchwood, (until Miracle Day that is because they tried to Americanize it)

As a kid I watched the Avengers and the Saint and the Prisoner in the 60s and caughrt some Doctor Who in the 60s as well but never really got interested until Tom Baker became the 4th Doctor and set the Bar for how the Doctor should be.  All Doctors have been great though a few like Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy were victims of crappy writing and showrunners.

The 50th Anniversary Special could have had more but it was great and filled in some gaps, including Paul McGann's transformation into the War Doctor. Also the the semi Biopic of William Hartnell and that start of the show was excellent.  I guess When a TV show that has been around almost as long as I have, there is something to be said about it.

5965706,3,B00F37VHPM,"Many of the negative (1 to 3 stars) reviews to date have focused on the price of DVD or Blu-Ray.  Such reviews are not helpful to prospective buyers.  The price fluctuates from day to day, and a prospective buyer can decide whether to pay what the item costs.  What a prospective buyer NEEDS is information on how good the episode is.

This is not a terrible episode, but I have two major complaints about it.

ONE:  Misuse of Billie Piper.  Advance information about ""The Day of the Doctor"" indicated that David Tennant (the Tenth Doctor) and Billie Piper (who played Rose Tyler, companion of the Tenth Doctor) would return.  Silly me!  I thought this meant the Tenth Doctor + Rose Tyler.  Rose Tyler was my favorite companion of the modern era and possibly my all-time favorite back to the early days of Doctor Who.  Well, David Tennant did come back as the Tenth Doctor, but Billie Piper played a completely different role, as a character who had never appeared on the show before.  What a bunch of baloney!  If they were not going to have Rose Tyler, they should have had somebody else play the role that Billie Piper played.

TWO:  Too many annoying sub-plots.  The story has three interacting plot threads:  the end of the Time War between the Daleks and the Time Lords, interaction between the Tenth Doctor and Queen Elizabeth I (with interference from the Zygons), and interference from the Zygons in London in 2013.  The Time War has been hanging over the modern show like a storm cloud ever since the first episode of the modern series back in 2005, and the story should have focused on the Time War to the maximum extent practical.  The other stuff mostly constituted a distraction, although the interlude with Queen Elizabeth in around 1570 did tie up a minor loose end from The Shakespeare Code (the second episode of the third modern season).  Also, given the intensity and gravity of the Time War, much of the episode was a bit silly and light hearted.",1387670400,2,1967,4.646376811594203

5965720,5,B00F37VHPM,"Very few shows in history ever make it to a fifty year anniversary, in fact, according to the folks at the Guinness Book of World Records, the sci-fi genre has seen exactly zero shows last that long. Something like that deserves to be appropriately celebrated and the BBC and the Doctor Who crew pulled out all the stops when they crafted the worldwide simulcast of 'The Day of the Doctor'. Sadly there were some unlucky fans who didn't have access to watch it live on television and couldn't make it out to the theater to see it broadcast on the big screen either, but no worries now because they immediately put the special extended episode out on DVD along with bonus features to add to their growing collections.

'The Day of the Doctor' brings the two most recent Doctors (Matt Smith and David Tennant) together on screen along with a mysterious third Doctor, known as the War Doctor (played by John Hurt.) As the story unfolds we find out why this long forgotten version of our hero has been buried in his memories, in his guilt and in his shame. All three Doctors have to learn to trust each other (or themselves, you could say) in order to set right something that went wrong so long ago.

From the moment the show begins every fan is just waiting for one thing, to see Smith and Tennant on screen together for the first time. How will they react? How will they play off each other? Will it be funny, awkward or just plain silly? I'm happy to say I thought it was exceedingly charming not only how those two worked together, but how they in turn played off Hurt as their older/younger version. In terms of plot and story structure the episode works well at the start, but I felt the ending left something to be desired. It rang a little to reminiscent to me of the same tactic used in the legendary episode 'Blink'. Yet, I won't go into that too much more since folks might not have watched this yet. I'll just leave it with this; anytime you are writing a story dealing with time travel and paradoxes, there are about as many possible endings as their are audience members. There's just no way to please them all.

The DVD release has a few neat bonus features for the die-hard fans. There are two mini-films which cover a couple of outside plot points which lead into the anniversary episode. One features the beginning of the final attack on the Doctor's home planet, while the other film features a former Doctor, Paul McGann, and details his transformation into the War Doctor. There is also a behind-the-scene featurette about the making of the episode, where you get to see and feel the real camaraderie between everyone, both in front of the camera and behind. It's not just a nicety passed on without thought when actors from this franchise talk about it being like a family that just keeps growing. Once you're into Doctor Who, no matter how long your character lasts, you are part of the history of it forever.

There's also a primer, kind of a documentary tracing the show all the way back to it's humble beginnings. Many former Doctors and companions are featured in interviews and you get tons of interesting tidbits, like exactly who it was that named the Tardis for the first time (hint: it wasn't the Doctor at all.)

As we wait for the days of Matt Smith to come to an end and for Peter Capaldi to step into this increasingly big shoes, fans might be asking themselves if the show could possibly make it another fifty years. If the quality keeps up and the fans keep watching, personally I see no reason why not.",1387324800,3,3538,4.513260530421217

I was expecting something like this.  While it was fun to learn more about the lost Dr. who made the terrible choice.  We have hope for the Dr's people, and have a quest to follow now, but for me it just lacked the greatness of 50 years of work.",1387238400,,568,3.7796610169491527

5965731,5,B00F37VHPM,"Best 3D I've seen in a long time. I just got my Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Special, the 2 disc 3D, Blu-ray combo. I watched it on my Amazon purchased VISIO M3D55KDE 55"" TV and a VISIO 3D player. This is 3D that the movie theaters use.

I deeply appreciate the thought that the producers and director put into each shot of this marvelous show. The 3D is exceptional. Most scenes look like the viewer is standing on the side of the set watching the actors. There is very little gimmickry to the show. Some scenes, like the fields and forrest in the Queen Elizabeth scene are majestic and so natural looking. Very little contrast or brightness is lost in the 3D viewing.

After seeing the 50th Anniversary Special in 3D I was hoping that the extras would be in 3D as well. Alas, this was not to be. They are in 2D and crystal clear in the Blu-ray disc.

There was a surprise pack of Trading Cards included. Each card has a drawing and history of each Doctor, the Doctor years on TV and a bonus card for John Hurt.

Seeing David Tennant one more time was the topper for me. He was 'my Doctor'. He hasn't lost a step and can hold his own with John Hurt.

If you are a Doctor Who fan, and have a 3D TV and 3D DVD player, this collection is a must have.",1387152000,,1247,4.157676348547718
5965732,2,B00F37VHPM,"This story is a mess. This story took a bit to get on with its own story. Once again we have scenes showing how much someone wants to get into the Doctors pants and the teeny boppers swoon. Billie Piper seemed wasted in the role she did play. She plays primarily the conscience of the doctor. That could have been played by anyone and the story does not explain why it has to be her. Any explanation could be chalked up to assumptions because the story doesnt tell us why out of all the characters, companions and species that the doctor has encountered it had to be Rose playing his conscience.
The villainous Zygons are introduced quite well and are rather menacing however that threat is not really resolved. The plot resolution that we do get with them had already been done previously with the Silurians in the series 5 two episode story Hungry Earth/Cold Blood.
John Hurt was overall fine in this story but for a character who was built up as a massive mystery is more or less sidelined to highlight Matt Smith and the return of Tennent. As much as i love to see John Hurt at his craft this story would have served better with Paul McGann who only has to a visual audience a crappy movie and a short episode to his run.
John Hurt's doctor at the end of his appearance regenerates for no bloody reason. Any explanation given is all assumptions because yet again the story does not tell us. At least, as crappy as it was, Colin Baker had a reason. He bumped his head. John Hurt says goodbye walks into his tardis and just starts to regenerate.",1387152000,2,1547,4.4125874125874125

This special managed to take so many beloved characters and elements of the show and combined them into a story that will please any fan of the show, regardless if you just jumped on board or if you were there in 1963 for the Doctor's first black and white adventure. I'm not normally a fan of 3D but it was tastefully done and helped give the experience an extra bit of depth and immersion. All of the nods to previous Doctors and episodes was nicely done and it will take numerous viewings to catch all of the subtle nuances that are sprinkled throughout this special.

We were both thrilled with it and it's wonderful to be able to relive this adventure at home over and over again. Here's hoping we make it to the 100th anniversary",1387065600,,840,4.384615384615385
5965742,5,B00F37VHPM,"This show is a non-stop tip of the hat to longstanding Doctor Who fans, so if you're the sort of person who really ought to watch this, then you probably already have.

The action is driven by a subplot involving the Zygons, a shape-changing race of nasties.  Between that and the main plot, about the ultimate fate of Gallifrey, three incarnations of The Doctor are brought together.  That's a ton of fun.  They banter well off of one another, and argue, and cooperate.  As Matt Smith says in the middle of it all, ""this is what I'm like when I'm alone""  The main plot is also about the ultimate fate of John Hurt's Doctor: damnation or redemption?  No specific spoilers here, but this is Doctor Who, after all, one of the most deeply optimistic shows around.

The effects are marvelous.  One thing I like about the high production values of the revived series: the effects help move the story, but they are not the story.  My only criticism of the show is the role Billie Piper was given.  She is sort of a high-tech version of the angel Clarence from ""It's a Wonderful Life.""  It was a decent way of bringing Billie Piper back to the series without having to concoct an excuse from bringing in Rose Tyler, either from the past or from That Parallel Universe, and she acts the role well.  But as a past-and-future Who fan, I didn't think she was the right person for the role.  That should have been Alex Kingston.

There are so many tributes to the previous Doctors, especially in the last 10 minutes, as to make a long-time fan giddy.  In particular, there's a cameo in the last five minutes that just about had me jumping up and down.

So five shape-shifting thumbs up.  Extremely well done.",1387065600,,1696,4.504918032786885

5965746,4,B00F37VHPM,"Overall excellent and nice tear-jerking surprise at the end.

You should probably go to [...] and watch ""Night of the Doctor"" featuring Paul McGann before watching this.  Or at least watch it afterwards.

My only disappointment was that Christopher Eccleston did not appear in the special but there is always room for filming it later.  After Hurt's regeneration I would have had Eccleston offering his surrender to the TimeLords over the former coordinates of Gallifrey who are of course gone as well as orbiting Skaro and offering his surrender to the Daleks but the planet is desolate and abandonned.  They could have used voices of Davison, C. Baker, McCoy, and McGann with new dialog paired with images of their younger selves offering advice to the Doctor that to seek a companion that companions always brought him peace.  As the Doctor struggles to come to term with what he had just done, he sees a signal from a Nestene ship approaching Earth and decides to set a course for Earth.  (i.e., linking to the Rose story).

I was also disappointed where there is reference to ""Bad Wolf"" which Tennant puzzles over but then quickly forgets about it as he tries to work a solution with the other Doctors.  I was hoping Rose would play herself and in the end ask Matt Smith's Doctor why she isn't with him that she thought she would be with him forever.  Matt's Doctor tells her that he promises everything will work out and to stay with Tennant's Doctor as even though he won't admit it, he needs her.",1386979200,,1504,4.684410646387833

5965749,5,B00F37VHPM,"I gave this five stars because of ""Day of the Doctor"" which was awesome. Also, it is important to know that you only need to be caught up to ""End of Time: Part 2"" in order to watch this, which is the last of the season four specials (called the David Tennant specials on Amazon). The rest of the content is fun extra material that celebrates the 50th.
David Tennant and Matt Smith were really funny together. I haven't been really impressed with Smith as the Doctor to be honest, but he did a great job here. Billie Piper was great too, as was John Hurt.
The only problem I have with the collection is that it is missing the Night of the Doctor short with Paul McGann. I don't know why it was omitted, but it needs to be here. The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot would have been nice as well.

*SPOILER*
Yeah I wish Rose Tyler/Bad Wolf/The Moment could have at least said ""Hi"" to the Tenth Doctor, like all fans who prefer RTD era Who, but I can honestly see why Moffat shied away from doing that.",1386892800,2,990,4.238095238095238

In the Gallifreyan city of Arcadia, all is lost.  But as the Daleks advance, chasing down each last soldier, they are met with a message shot out on a wall, ""NO MORE"".

In the Gallifrey capital, the General is told there has been a breach of the Time Vaults, ""where all the forbidden weapons are hidden away.""  A Lord corrects him, ""They aren't forbidden any more. We've used them all against the Daleks.""
General: ""No. No, we haven't. The Moment is come.... The Galaxy Eater. The final work of the ancients of Gallifrey. A weapon so powerful the operating system became sentient. According to legend, it developed a conscience. How do you use a weapon of mass destruction when it can stand in judgement of you? There is only one man who will even try.""

In a Gallifrey desert of gold sand, an old man, his face etched with too much knowing, trudges with a sack over his shoulder. It is the Doctor (The War Doctor, we can call him #8 1/2?) and he's going to set off the Moment. But the weapon projects a reasoner, to make sure the Doctor understands the horrible deed he plans.
The Doctor: ""I have no desire to survive this.""
Reasoner: ""Then that's your punishment. If you do this. If you kill them all, then that's the consequence. You. Live.
...
Do you want to see what it will turn you into? I'm opening windows to the future.""

And suddenly we're in 1569 Elizabethan England, where the Tenth Doctor is romancing the Queen.
At the same time, the Eleventh Doctor has been summoned by U.N.I.T. in 2013.

And the fun begins, three Doctors together. This is an epic tale of great seriousness and loony comedy.  ""We're being attacked by shape-shifting aliens from outer space formerly disguised as my horse.""

""You might say, I've been doing this all my lives.""

There is only the briefest glimpse of the 12th Doctor,  We'll have to wait for the 2013 Christmas Special to meet him formally.

Special Features:
1.  Mini-Episodes. Two prequels to ""The Day of the Doctor"":
.....A. ""The Last Day"" (4 minutes) A new soldier is outfitted for the important work of monitoring the space trenches over Arcadia. Check out every spot that appears in the sky, every bird, every shadow where there shouldn't be a shadow. And then, NO!, it's a shadow with an eye-stalk.
.....B. ""The Night of the Doctor"" (7 minutes) The Eighth Doctor tries to rescue the pilot from a crashing spaceship. When she realizes he's a Time Lord, she is repulsed. ""Go back to your battlefield. You've not finished yet. Some of the universe is still standing.""
He crashes with her, and is rescued by the Sisterhood of Karn (1st seen in ""The Brain of Morbius"" 1979).
They offer him a forced regeneration. Pick what you become.
2.  ""The Day of the Doctor: Behind the Scenes"" (15 minutes) This making-off featurette is narrated by Colin Baker, the 6th Doctor. He says, ""Steven [Moffat] really had his work cut out. Not only create a work that celebrates the past, but also takes Doctor Who into a brand new era.""  The next 50 years start here!
3.  ""Doctor Who Explained"" (50 minutes) This has a long list of commentators, as befits a special explaining 50 years of Doctor Who: Matt Smith (11th Doctor), Steven Moffat (showrunner), Colin Baker, Tom Baker, Peter Davison (4th Doctor), Sylvester McCoy (7th Doctor), Neil Gaiman (writer ""Nightmare in Silver""), Marcus Wilson (producer), Julie Gardner (executive producer), Nicola Bryant (plays Peri), Jee Jee Tso (plays Chang Lee), Daphne Ashbrook (plays Grace Holloway), David Morrisey (plays Jackson Lake), Carole Ann Ford (plays Susan), William Russell (plays Ian), Freema Agyman (plays Martha), Mark Sheppard (plays Canton Delaware), John Barrowman (plays Captain Jack), Karen Gillan (plays Amy), Frazer Hines (plays Jamie), Mark Stickson (plays Vislor), Arthur Darvill (plays Rory), Jenna Coleman (plays Clara), Matthew Waterhouse (plays Adric), Hugh Bonneville (plays Captain Avery), Nocholas Briggs (voice of the Daleks), Noel Clarke (plays Mickey) and Sophie Aldred (plays Ace).
Strickson: ""If I can imagine myself, I'm now a TV producer, going into an office and trying to sell Doctor Who. 'It's about this guy who travels around the universe in a telephone box and he has these ever-changing companions with him, and when he dies he comes back as another actor.'  Well, that's not going to work, is it? Because where's the loyalty for the audience?""
This is a very basic introduction to the world of Doctor Who. As a fan who's collected the classic Doctor Who DVD's, I don't think there was anything new. But then, I don't think a long-time fan like me is who they are shooting for on this.
4.  Comic Con Trailer for ""The Day of the Doctor"".
""There's one life I've tried very hard to forget.""
5.  Teaser Trailer for ""The Day of the Doctor"".

At first I figured, well, the Season 8 story-arc must have, in the background, a search for Gallifrey. But then I realized, if he has forgotten it all, how will he know he's supposed to search?

* On November 23rd 1963, a worldwide phenomenon started broadcasting from the BBC. It was called Doctor Who. The ambiguous title along with a very eccentric, ambiguous, cantankerous, old, young, funny, witty, gadget orientated, sportsman-like, tall, short, blonde, brunette, dark haired, white haired skinny, chunky straight-haired curly-haired.main character otherwise known as The Doctor, has traveled through time and space for last 50 years in an original Police Box of the late 50s and early 60s. These Police boxes were commonly seen around the streets of England way yonder when. Why a Police Box? The T.A.R.D.I.S. (the Doctors time machine which is an acronym for Time And Relative Dimensions In Space) broke its chameleon circuit which is designed to shape the TARDIS into the background environment wherever it goes so as not to be seen or distracting. (But, then was fixed only to be set back again to the Police Box setting by the Doctor himself  for sentimental reasons he says.)

This year, on November 23rd, 2013 (in America on the 25th)  50 years to the day - a worldwide event occurred both on the small screen and the large (silver) screens in Global Geo Sync for the first time ever. The Day of the Doctor was first presented with a wonderful behind the scenes  treat for the fans before the screening itself and an intro that introduces the audiences to 3D! A Doctor Who first! In 660 theatres across the US, $4.77 million was made for one night for one showing. Detailing precise arrangements through the BBC with Fathom Events, that translates to $7,155 per location and over 320,000 tickets sold making this Fathoms biggest and most successful synced event ever! In every theatre, wherever The Day of the Doctor was playing, it was the number 2 box office gross on that particular Monday night showing nationwide.

Now in the Guinness Book of World Records, Doctor Who is already been noted as the longest running Science Fiction Television show in history, it has now received another Guinness award for being the most watch single episode of any TV show event worldwide  ever! Beating all the viewers of the broadcasts of The Academy Awards and the Superbowl yearly! For 75 minutes, on TV, in the UK alone 10.2 million viewers watch The Day of the Doctor at the same time as the rest of the world did (add another 5.2 million viewers for the second showing during primetime that evening making it 15.4 million viewers). On Twitter it broke the most Tweets ever over a period of time during its actual first run airing, it became GetGlues most downloaded show on ITunes for BBC America within 24 hours of its release beating the former record holder, the Breaking Bad finale and finally setting a new record on Tumbler for the highest level of activity for any televised event in Tumblers history!

Enough with the statswhy you should watch the show (or get the Blu-Ray version, also available in 3D on December 10th, 2013), simple; Its simply the best, up-to-date action, adventure, shocking, surprising, plot-twisting, villain filled, humorous, whirlwind of a roller-coaster ride of exciting Science Fiction story telling youll ever see.

SPOILERS (If you have seen it  stop reading here and go to the last paragraph):
Technically Director Nick Hurran (Sherlock, Me and Mrs. Jones) did an amazing job of taking a Steven Moffat (Sherlock, Tin Tin) script filled with plot twist, time anomalies, aliens, companions and three (actually 4) Doctors of the past, present and yes, future, and making the entire mini-movie (episode) exciting and funny and just pure heartwarming fun all in 75 minutes!

Speaking of the cast. Matt Smith is our 11th (or 12th) Doctor and currently needing the assistant of two of his other selves. Doctors # 9 (Hurt) and Doctor #10 (or 11th who is Tennant). Matt has taken on the role and over his four year run has become adored by fans. His quirky, over the top and broad theatrical skills have cemented him as a fan favorite. With only one more episode to go, his four run is almost at an end and in this episode the actor has publicly proclaimed he was delighted and thrilled to work both with Tennant (his predecessor) and John Hurt. Matt is colorful and serious and above all fun with all his adventures and his comic keen timing with both Hurt and Tennant is spot-on!

Fan favorite Doctor and brilliant actor David Tennant (Hamlet, Harry Potter) returns as his personification of the 10th (11th) Doctor who must join forces and collaborate with himself, the 9th and the 11th (12th) Doctor to save Gallifrey once again because The Great Time War between the Daleks and the Timelords has not occurred. But, yes it has. Confused? You won't be, its exposition at its best. And its all done with relatively real logic and a lot of humor. Having been the favorite of the newly rebooted Doctor Who for four years prior, it was like watching David slip into a comfortable pair of old slippers. His performance was sharp and witty as well as brining back his Tennantisms of fast dialogue and third person repartee with no one there. Just pure fun!

John Hurt (The Elephant Man, Alien) is the 9th Doctor (In between Paul McGann and Christopher Eccleston but everyone past him up one  go figure!). John is a superb actor and theres no arguing that, but this role he just seemed to delight in. Ive never seen him more happy, perky and downright funny. Thats what he made of his character who was obviously playing that he was not that impressed with his future incarnations (i.e. Smith and Tennant) extremely well. John was wise and regretful but with a twinkle of wonderment making the three of them like a nuclear bomb of talent and excitement!

Jenna Coleman (Captain America, Death Comes to Pemberly) is riding on as the current companion known as Clara or the Impossible Girl, and Jenna has the best job of all, even with her wonderful modern-day kick and attitude of how a real person today might react to the personalities that are The Doctor, she gets to play tennis with three of the most diversely different performers you could think of. And showing her acting chops, Jenna is a pro tennis player bouncing and providing the exact response each Doctor needs. Bravo Jenna.

Billie Piper (Foxtrot, Penny Dreadful) is back and she looks a lot like Rose Tyler but calls herself The Moment. Yet another talent, Billie a former pop star turned actress, thanks to Eccleston/Tennant mostly, she gets to play a wildly bizarre character with voice inflections and a Yoda-like wisdom while still bearing the cute charm of what was once the first companion in the Doctors reboot back in 2005. Billie must have had a ball doing this and when you watch it again, watch her eyes. So cool!

Jemma Redgrave (Howards End, Unforgiven) is back as Kate Stewart, the Brigadier Stewarts daughter who only heard stories of her father talking about the many incarnations he has seen of the Doctor over the past decades. Jemma is fun and what better than to play a duel role. That of a bad guy (a Zygon) and that of a good guy (head of UNIT). Again another actress who plays like a pro and gets to bounce two personalities she is playing with three amazing actors. (Remember? Matt Smith, David Tennant and John Hurt!)

Joanna Page (Love Actually, From Hell) plays Elizabeth the 1st with lots of heightened energy, but the only down side for me is she played it more modern and I would expect an 18th century Queen to be more regal and stern. Joanna is obviously having so much fun because most of her scenes are with Tennant.

BIG SPOILER  DONT LOOK!  DANGER  DANGER! : Tom Baker (The Golden Voyage of Sinbad, Little Britain) is in this production. For those of you just joining the planet, Tom is playing The Curator (Or is it really Doctor #4). Yes the oldest living Doctor of the thirteen actors who have played the title character makes a wonderful, heartwarming, charming and funny last appearance. Back in the 70s Tom was the most popular Doctor for having had the role for the longest which was for 8 years! He and Matt performed magic together with their unique twinkles in their eyes and an almost tear-jerking smile between the two of them. It was a cherry on top of a big delicious cake. Yum! Seconds please!

Again, the Doctor or Matt Smith will return for his final performance in the Christmas Special which always airs on Christmas Day worldwide well see the end of yet another Doctor (era) and start the legacy of another.  The Time Of The Doctor will introduce us to Peter Capaldi as the new 12th (or 13th) Doctor on Christmas Day! A sneak preview for the episode was shown after the simulcast of ""The Day of the Doctor"", confirming the appearance of the Cybermen and revealing the inclusion of the Silence, Daleks, and Weeping Angels, as well as confirming the Doctor's return to the planet Trenzalore. Dont miss it!

Oh and the best shot is when Matt Smith walks out of the TARDIS with a wonderful voice over narration and we see all 13 Doctors! Now on DVD/Blue Ray this episode The Day of the Doctor has already gone down in history and if you have never seen Doctor Who and you want to see what this 50 year old legacy tastes like, buy this episode. Yes buy it, don't just watch it, its that good!",1386806400,9,9413,4.725609756097561

5965763,5,B00F37VHPM,"This was everything and more beyond what I could have hoped for. I purposely discarded any expectations and let Steven Moffat's brilliant story take me where it wanted me to go. No spoilers here, but I do feel compelled to note one important aspect. Despite any statements or insistence to the contrary, it is very clear that if Christopher Eccleston had agreed to participate that it would have been the Ninth Doctor at the heart of the story, and that there would not have been a ""lost"" Doctor, whom the others tried to forget or repress in their memories. The Ninth Doctor would be filling the role that the ""War Doctor"" now fills. Exactly how that would have played out isn't so very difficult to imagine. Eccleston's loss is our gain, because if he had participated, we would not have John Hurt's brilliant incarnation of the Doctor that we now have to treasure. So, to apologize to anyone who reads this review in advance, I'll then say that Eccleston's no show was no loss to us, but his own loss and his alone (Goodbye Christopher Eccleston, and thanks for all the fish), and I for one, didn't miss him here. Provision was still made as to how he (Eccleston) remains in the canon; his story begins where this story ends, and his, the War Doctor and the Tenth Doctor will have no memory of what they had attempted to accomplish and whether they succeeded. This is both an incredible celebration of 50 years of Doctor Who and a launch into the next 50, made by people who love and cherish it every bit as much if not more than the fans. And Billie Piper comes on in, with a brilliant portrayal of someone ""other"" than Rose Tyler and almost steals the show. Briliant writing, brilliant acting, brilliant production all around, I could not have asked for more.",1386720000,2,1764,4.5678233438485805

5965770,2,B00F37VHPM,The main reason I'm giving this two stars is that the audio is horrible in parts of the special. It has this robotic kind of effect and just about ruins the special.

5965771,4,B00F37VHPM,"You know this is a hard item to find. I have looked all over the place for it and just now i found it on Dvd, I would have liked to get it on Blue Ray but it included 3D, Blue ray, and Dvd.
Not a bad thing but if i do not have 3D then what is the point plus my eye doctor said i can not watch 3D movies, My eyes, So for all those who like 3D good No harm in that, I missed watching the show on TV and  now can get it.
So from one huge Doctor who fan that has the Doctor who stamps and was not easy to get those stamps and lucky i had family in England who got them for me,
About this show i think it is a honor for them to do this for a 50th and hopefully more years of Doctor who.
Now for getting it on dvd i really do not mind it was cheaper.
So when you look around for something you like shop around, before you buy online but if you can not do that then use online
Some days can only get things online
good luck to all",1386633600,,923,3.5245098039215685
5965772,5,B00F37VHPM,"So here it is - December 10th - the release date of the Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Special: The Day of the Doctor (Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD Combo) - and there are alreadt 288 (!) ""reviews"" posted. This is because Amazon groups ALL reviews of all formats of films, TV shows, etc together, whether they were aired on TV (the 50th Anniversary special aired in more countries than any other TV show on the same day!), were available for streaming (Amazon Instant) or on a physical DVD or BD. As I often mention in my reviews, it is important to look at the ""version"" that is being reviewed. This is of the BD/DVD 3D Combo pack).

I will say up front that I do not have a 3D player (never saw need for one) so I can't report on that function - and if someone has a 3D player, they may want to note that in title of their review.- but the BD player fine in my player and the image on my 40: flat screen was great.

The set includes The Day of the Doctor (approx. 80 minutes), Doctor Who Explained (approx. 45 minutes) , two mini-episodes, ""The Night of the Doctor"" and ""The Last Day,"" a 13-minute ""making of"" featurette and two trailers: the trailer that played at Comic Con and the first 50th Anniversary trailer.

Now, I only recently discovered the Doctor Who series and won't hold myself out as knowledgeable about its 50-year run. As a novice, I did find the ""Doctor Who Explained"" episode (available separately on Amazon Instant) well thought out and helping to fill in missing pieces for me. It might be redundant for those fans who have watched the whole series and repeat the lines when they re-watch the episodes.
The purpose of this package from BBC America seems to be to compile the shorter pieces produced for the ""Big 5-0"" of Dr. W into one package and to give those with 3-D players and TVs a chance to see the episode in a format that they can't stream (and, of course, show off their equipment.)

For more details on the individual components, I'll leave you to peruse the comments from the previous 288 reviewers.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5965773,5,B00F37VHPM,"Amazing episode! I can't wait to see what the Christmas special holds in store for the Doctor.
I'm giving it 5 stars for how good the episode is, but would like to give it 3 stars since it cost 7$ on amazon.  It's running time is less than an episode of Sherlock and cost many times more.  Seems to be amazon is capitalizing on the hype.

Was still worth 7$ for me.",1386633600,2,365,4.041666666666667

Ten and Eleven's interactions are quite funny and when you add in John Hurt's character, it's even better.  This is a must see for any Doctor Who fan and you won't be disappointed.

**Before watching this episode it's important that you check out a mini episode called The Night of the Doctor.  You can find it on YouTube and probably the BBC and BBCA sites.  It's also on the DVD.

The Blu-ray/DVD combo came with a set of collectible trading cards in a foil pack.  There are 12 cards total and any fan will love this added bonus.",1386633600,3,661,4.458333333333333

5965788,5,B00F37VHPM,"Last month, the BBC series Doctor Who celebrated its 50th anniversary with the television special/movie The Day of the Doctor starring Matt Smith, David Tennant, Jenna Coleman, John Hurt and Billie Piper, which aired simultaneously in 94 countries across 6 continents and set a Guinness World Record for the largest simulcast of a television drama.

Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Tribute Teaser Trailer

Two Mini-Episodes - ""The Last Day"" & ""The Night Of The Doctor

The Doctor had to jump into his own timeline to save Clara Oswald at the end of ""The Name Of The Doctor,"" resulting in the Doctor meeting another incarnation the viewers have never seen or heard about before, played by John Hurt. In The Day Of The Doctor, we finally get to see the great Time War that will destroy his home world, Gallifrey. During this era, he has done terrible things to stop the Dalek invasion and no longer deserves to be called the Doctor, but instead he is known as the Warrior or the War Doctor. To the stop the Dalek from destroying the universe, he steals the ancient weapon called ""The Moment,"" a galaxy eater, which would destroy both the Time Lords and the Dalek race, but the weapon has a conscience in the form of Rose Tyler/Bad Wolf. The Moment tries to show him another option than killing his own people and opens up a portal linking to the Elizabethan England and 2013.

The 11th Doctor summons Clara Oswald, who just finished her first day of teaching, but almost as soon as she enters the TARDIS, they are forcefully taken by the UNIT, where the Doctor is given a letter written by his previous wife, Elizabeth I of England. She leaves a message stating he is now the curator of Under-Gallery, which happens to have a 3D Time Lord painting of the final day of the Time War. The paintings title is either No More or Gallifrey Falls.

The 10th Doctor is in the Elizabethan England romancing Elizabeth I, as he believes she is really a Zygon and proposing marriage may be the only way to find out if she is one of the creatures, but it turns out he is completely wrong, except for the fact that the  Zygons are planning an invasion.

The portal The Moment created brings the 11th, 10th and War Doctor together to stop the Zygons invasion through time and possibly prevent Gallifrey from being destroyed during the Time War.

I missed out on the original airing, but I did get to watch Doctor Who: The Day Of The Doctor 3D Blu-ray over the weekend. With all the hype surrounding the 50th Anniversary Special, my expectations where mighty high, but I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed by the end result. Lead writer and executive producer Steven Moffat did a wonderful job paying homage to the last fifty years and finally bridging the gap between the 8th and 9th Doctors. It's nice to have David Tennant returning one last time as the Doctor, which he blended in great with the 11th Doctor (Matt Smith). John Hurt does a wonderful work as the War Doctor. I actually thought he would play the villain in the special, but I was completely wrong. Being a fan of Billie Piper, I thought it was great to have her back, even though she wasn't playing Rose again. It would have been wonderful if Christopher Eccleston could have came back, but at least the producers added the 9th Doctor using archive footage along with the first eight Doctors. Speaking of the past Doctors, I enjoyed watching the mini-episode Night Of The Doctor with the return of Paul McGann as the 8th Doctor, but I do wish it was a bit longer. The back of the Blu-ray states the movie is 75 minutes, but the display time on my player had it at almost 80 minutes. There is a new Doctor Who documentary similar to the ones on the Doctors Revisited sets, but this one is 50 minutes. Overall, Doctor Who: The Day Of The Doctor is a great way to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the series. I enjoyed watching every minute of it and I'm looking forward to the new direction the series will have thanks to the clever ending.

Its a great MOVIE!!

Now to the quick point that really angers, and I mean ANGERS me on here about the customers. THIS WAS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE AN EPISODE!!! THIS WAS CONSIDERED TO BE A MOVIE!!!!

So please, stop complaining about the episode being 7.99 to download. Just go and buy the disc then. DON'T PIRATE IT EITHER!! Its not price gouging either. I'm pretty sure some of the feature films may be 4.99 or 5.99 to download. This is the price that it is because its considered to be a SPECIAL MOVIE for Doctor Who. Not a special episode. Thats what the Christmas Special is.

The other thing I don't like is that I don't think people realize that they bring the overall rating of the movie down when they rate it a 1 Star. At least give the film the proper rating you know it deserves and then grip about the price if you must but I think the price is a good and reasonable price for it.",1386374400,3,1117,4.205607476635514

Meanwhile, I am so glad that they have added The Night of the Doctor to this DVD,
BUT, where is the hilarious mockumentary, The Five(ish) Doctors??  It was  produced as a gift for the fans who wanted to see other Doctors and companions participate in the 50th Anniversary episode, and we were all hoping it would be on the DVD.  Also,  an Adventure in Space and Time, about the beginnings of Doctor Who, should also be included.",1386028800,2,683,4.689075630252101
5965818,5,B00F37VHPM,"This review is for the content of the actual episode as the DVD has not yet been released.
This episode is a fantastic one which can be enjoyed by fans of both the new and old series equally. Yet there are so many inside references that the newbie will actually lose out on the nuances I think.
I don't want to give away anything but I have to say that the most exciting prospect for the future of the series is that we will get to see Gallifrey portrayed the way it was meant to be! This has been the one thing I found lacking since the 2004 reboot - the boorish menace of the High Council who might at any time force the Doctor to do their dirty-work for them.
As for the episode itself, it really is a true celebration of 50 years of TARDIS travel. Even the idea of the Doctor meeting his former selves is a callback - especially David Tennant delivering the line ""Oh, I see you've redecorated ... I don't like it."" in exactly the same way as Patrick Troughton did in ""The Three Doctors"" in 1972-73. Maybe the best moment of the entire episode is the meeting of Matt Smith (the current Doctor) and Tom Baker (the oldest living previous Doctor). One thing which I think will make all Whovians happy is that it has been all but declared that the old rule that Time Lords can only regenerate 13 times has essentially been overturned. It seems that as long as there is an audience for the show and people who love it working at the BBC to produce it, there will continue to be many new episodes of ""Doctor Who""!
SPOILER ALERT!!! If you have not yet seen the episode and don't want to know any more, stop reading here!!!
The story itself clears up at least one huge mystery which has been plaguing fans both new and old - what exactly did the Doctor do to end the Last Time War? In some stories it seemed as if he burned Gallifrey to cinders but in others Gallifrey is described as being simply lost. And in ""The End Of Time"" the Time Lords actually did try to return. We now know (or at least I strongly suspect) that Moffat and Davies have been playing a long-game and have been working towards exactly this moment all along. Essentially, the Doctor used a weapon which had a conscience and could actually speak to him. Appearing in the form of Rose Tyler, whom this incarnation of the Doctor had not yet met, and calling itself Bad Wolf (see Season 1 of the new series) it decided that his punishment would be to survive the devastation. In allowing him to live, he then has time to think about the consequences and live with them - and maybe even change them! In the end, when Matt Smith is confronted by Tom Baker, he's told not only that he will have many many more incarnations - some even returning to old models in different apparent age-stages - but that Gallifrey is out there for him to find, if he wants to do so.",1386028800,3,2824,4.280373831775701

5965821,5,B00F37VHPM,This is one of the best anniversary episodes of Dr. Who ever produced.  I love the recent series' and this is an excellent example of their commitment to producing quality entertainment.,1385942400,,186,5.0
5965822,5,B00F37VHPM,"Before I start here, I want to be perfectly clear about something: For years of being a geek, I have cared not one single iota for anything in the DOCTOR WHO universe. I didn't care about the shows, I didn't care about The Daleks, The Cybermen, the Sonic Screwdriver, The TARDIS; none of it. In fact, I had made it a point, despite my other geek friends practically forcing me to watch, to almost actively be against DOCTOR WHO.

In other words, I didn't want to like this. What's even worse is that I didn't want to LOVE it.

And now I do.

THE DAY OF THE DOCTOR will make you a fan of The Doctor, and this is part of the genius of Steven Moffat, as well as David Tennant, Matt Smith, Billie Piper, and John Hurt.

It could have been so easy to screw this up, to have three Doctors in the same place at the same time, but Moffat has yet to do me wrong. Initially with his fantastic reimagining of the Jekyll/Hyde story with JEKYLL, then with his beyond awe-inspiring reimagining of the adventures of Holmes and Watson with SHERLOCK, and now... he's made me a DOCTOR WHO fan. Of course it doesn't hurt to have so many fantastic performers in one place either. I've been a fan of David Tennant without being a WHO fan, and who doesn't love John Hurt? This is literally my first exposure to Matt Smith, and I have to state that I am looking forward to getting to the 11th Doctor, because I've been binge-watching WHO starting with the 9th Doctor, Christopher Eccleston, and the introduction of Piper as Rose Tyler, and I've just recently finished Tennant's first season with ""Doomsday"" and that hit me right in the feels. I want to be finished by this year's Christmas episode.

I know that this review makes me seem like I'm jumping on a bandwagon, and perhaps I am, despite my best intentions, but THE DAY OF THE DOCTOR is so marvelously entertaining, so charming, so smart and surprisingly dark at times, and having a better perspective on it now that I've seen some of the past episodes, it's just kind of miraculous. It's a shame that they couldn't get Eccleston, but his loss.

So thank you again, Steven Moffat. You've made someone who never EVER wanted to be a fan of DOCTOR WHO now asking for Sonic Screwdrivers and a TARDIS for Christmas.

The Doctor discovers a hole in time and realizes he recalls it sort of as it appears time is working to help him in some way.
  Meanwhile in the year 1592 The Doctor is enjoying a picnic with Queen Elizabeth the First and has just asked her to marry him.

What are the plans of the Zygons in 16th century Earth?  Will the Doctor make sense of it all or will he need help from the only place he can get it.  Himself?

5965838,5,B00F37VHPM,"I thought the episode was great. I must say to those complaining about apparent shortcomings in the series plot line to this point and the episode itself: as far as the doctor going to 13 re generations and the so-called problems with that, as the doctor himself would say, pay attention! this problem has already been addressed and gotten over in both the reboot series and classic series. the master in the end of time episodes, somehow magically regenerated himself from sort of witches brew spell, and also in the classic series please watch the episode serial the keeper of the traken, the master also resolve the problem of going past the regeneration limit in that episode as well, so please stop complaining and picking apart the hows and whys of going past the limit of regenerations it's already been done more than once pay attention please. as far as the episode the day of the doctor mentioning redundant details, please remember that this was a special event shown in movie theaters, opening the series to a potential market of people who may have never seen the show before, therefore the possible need a redundant ex position for those people who may have never seen the show. finally, as for complaints about silly things dead plot parts like the doctor flying through space falling out of the TARDIS, remember that were just basically trying to have some fun! Isn't that what part of the series is about? in addition to that it also has a rather clever device which does what science fiction does best explore deep moral questions about what it means to be a sentient being, such as a human, for those of you who are out there for you may or may not qualify as sentient, the moment has a conscience, and it is a device to make the plot more meaningful by asking questions such as how do we as human beings deal with important moral questions that have impact on the lives of many people? so the episode is doing that, trying to make it fun, trying to appeal to a potential new base of fans, as well as being the only anniversary episode to ever try to write all of the regeneration of the doctor into the plot line. to try to get all that in a meaningful and entertaining way is quite a piece of work. so for those of you were complaining, if you really are fans do a bit of homework and think about the previous episodes that explain the problems that you think ar problems now, and just relax! remember at the end this is supposed to be something that is imaginative meaningful and most of all fun! don't spoil that fun by arguing about little points that aren't relevant anyway this episode was great!",1385856000,2,2622,4.522105263157894

5965840,5,B00F37VHPM,"Disappointment was most definitely not an emotion that was felt during the viewing of these. For the actual 50th anniversary special, ""THE DAY OF THE DOCTOR"", The amount  of excitement that was created in the making of the film was directly translated to the actual movie. Once again, Steven Moffat lived up to his expectations by forming this clever storyline with brilliant twists (though it might have been slightly hard for him to resist killing a main character). Either way, I cannot express my enjoyment and encouragement to view this, and I must say that mere words are nowhere close to being a direct expression of my happiness!",1385856000,,637,4.898148148148148

That said, I do have a question:  In re-watching some episodes, in particular the McGann tv movie, the ""Doctor"" clearly states that Time Lords have 13 lives.  If Matt Smith is the eleventh and Capaldi is the 12th... or should he be the 13th?  With the intro between Eccelson (sic) and McGann of John Hurt as the Warrior Doctor, doesn't this make Capaldi the 13th and final Doctor?  Or will Day of the Doctor assuage my fears.....

5965843,5,B00F37VHPM,"I expected a lot from the 50th anniversary special, and Steven Moffat delivered; The Day of the Doctor actually exceeded my expectations! We finally learned the truth about the time war and the terrible choice that haunted the doctor for so long. John Hurt was brilliant in the role of that earlier regeneration, his ""older"" and darker self. Tennant, Smith and Hurt were fantastic together, and bringing Billy Piper back as a manifestation of the sentient weapon intended to end the time war was perfect. The story tied up some loose ends and explained an inconsistency in ""The End of Time"" that had bothered me. It also opened a whole universe of opportunities for the future of the show.

Oh, and it was great fun! I watched the television simulcast on November 23rd and saw it in the theater on November 25th. Strax the Sontaran explained what would happen to those who attempted to use their communicators during the presentation, David Tennant and Matt Smith did introductions ... and told us how to identify Zygons in the audience.

5965845,5,B00F37VHPM,"One of the best Doctor Who Specials to date, I loved seeing Tennant back again as the 10th Doctor, I was a little disappointed in ""Rose's"" character, because I was expecting her to be the actual Rose companion.  Other than that small disappointment, I was blown away by this episode and can't wait to see the XMas episode this month.  And, to all the people giving this one star because they felt the price was too high, that seems a bit strange.  A review is supposed to tell you if you liked something or not, are most people's pleasures relative to price?  I find that I either like or dislike something, regardless of price paid.  If Total Relative Pleasure received = Actual Pleasure MINUS Cost, then by that logic, the Mona Lisa is a terrible painting because its ""priceless"" and therefore its price is infinity, and no amount of pleasure would ever offset the price.

I find this ironic considering most people pay over $100 a month for full package cable television (which you need to include BBC America), so I guess 7 dollars doesn't really seem like that much for an episode that only occurs every 50 years.",1385856000,,1118,4.592964824120603

It's true, there may have been many several little moments of missed opportunity over the course of this 75 minute story where the writers COULD have included a few more fan-pleasing cameos and jests and COULD have buckled to their pressure, at the risk of the stories integrity, but what they did give us where just enough big pieces to set this episode apart as a celebration, and enough little jests and nods to please fans from all periods of the show.
  The dynamics between the old and new Doctors are brilliantly executed here, while every little intricacie and parallel within the two on-running stories is presented in top-notch 'Who' fashion. Even if you're fooled by the main plot of the episode though, or not satiated by the little pieces of the Time War that are used as a plot device to set up the the rest of the episode, the climactic twist that sets up the final moments minutes of the episode and takes us back through all 50 years of the shows history-and even a little bit forward- will be sure to leave you satisfied.

I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but I can say this, it's possibly the best ""Dr. Who"" of all time. Steven Moffat really did a fantastic job writing this one. The Doctor (Matt Smith) is united with his previous incarnation (David Tennant) as well as another Doctor (John Hurt), a previous unknown Doctor who is a much darker Doctor that has actually renounced the ""Doctor"" title. The Doctors' adventure stretches from 21st century Earth to Gallifrey during the Time War. We see the return of the Zygons as well as the Daleks. Billie Piper returns. Plus we get to see a cameo appearance by Fourth Doctor Tom Baker! All in all, an epic action-packed adventure that is both dark and uplifting, dramatic and humorous, and did I mention action-packed?!

You wouldn't be seeing a world in a painting. It would be like a black and white picture telling you how colorful a painting is.
Everything about it is first rate at least for the first forty minutes. Then a little  less attention gets paid to the 3D aspect.

I hope this spurs more 3D broadcasts because it was such a great experience.  3D on televisions is so well done and yet there is so little content readily available to customers who own 3D capable sets.

5965863,5,B00F37VHPM,"So, whatd you think?

The overwhelming response to the 50th Anniversary special of Doctor Who, which aired this past Saturday (as the largest global simulcast in television history) is that Whovians were generally pleased.  They enjoyed the 180-degree turn the Whoniverse has taken away from the darkness of the past that we had gotten used to and toward what is potentially a more optimistic and hopeful future.

This turn of events (Gallifrey being frozen in time somewhere in space and not, in fact, destroyed by the Doctor in the Time War) now sets the stage for some interesting story arcs, as well as for the plot holes and continuity errors that are just waiting to be discovered by devout Whovians.

One thing the 50th did for sure was live up to its hype, particularly when it came to bringing back the beloved Tenth Doctor, David Tennant, and having him interact with the current and Eleventh Doctor, Matt Smith.  Simply put, the two went together like peas and carrots (or fish sticks and custard).

Seeing Tennant again made us realize just how much we had missed him (even if they did make him inexplicably dafter here), and seeing Smith in his first new episode since the announcement of his departure in the upcoming Christmas special (set to air on December 25, 2013) made us love him even more and miss him like hes already gone.

John Hurts War Doctor teasing the both of them felt very you kids should get off my lawn!  Imagine finding out that you actually get less mature as you get older  youd probably get irked at your selves, too!  We were all prepared to despise this man, and yet he was, in the end, just as lovable as every other Doctor.

Thankfully, the writers had Billie Piper portray the Bad Wolf version of her character, as opposed to the Doctors former companion/lady love, Rose Tyler.  Rose would have distracted us too much from the main storyline.  Plus, we now can understand how the Ninth Doctor, Christopher Eccleston, found the Bad Wolf he was subconsciously (?) searching for, and that it may not have actually been pure happenstance.

Surely many of us were still disappointed, though, that Piper and Tennant did not interact at all whatsoever during the 50th, so well have to settle for how happy they must have been behind the scenes to see each other on set once again.

Seeing Tom Baker was a warm and pleasant experience, even for those of us who were too young to have seen his performance as the Fourth Doctor when it originally aired, and the fact that Claras presence was kept to a minimum was a relief indeed and further proof that Clara is less of a companion and more of a plot device, something of which the 50th was certainly in no need.

How epic was soon-to-be Thirteenth Doctor Peter Capaldis cameo?  The fact that they included him in the 50th when hes not even the Doctor yet (as well as how they never leave Eccleston out, despite any bad blood that may exist between him and the crew) lends credence to the respectability of this show.

Though, even knowing that Eccleston would never return, we were all still hoping hed show up in that regeneration scene, just for a brief second.  At least he was there in CGI spirit and, for that, we can be appreciative.

And now for the less impressive elements of the special.  First of all, the poor Zygons - they really served no other purpose than as a nostalgic throwback.  It seemed that the subplot (which, lets face it, none of us were paying attention to anyway [and since when does Who have a subplot?]) was simply a way through which the writers could channel their nostalgic homages, like River Songs shoes or Bakers scarf.

The fact that the War Doctor was likeable by the end of the episode is unsettling.  Simply put, for the War Doctor to be likeable, he has then risen to the same level on which we place all the other Doctors which, in turn, makes him the true Ninth Doctor.  At first, this may seem like it craps on Ecclestons run, but all it really does is mess with the numbers (Nine is now Ten, Ten is now Eleven, and so on  and we all know that Tennant has to stay Ten  its in his name, after all!).

However, thanks to the spoiler that was released today with regard to the upcoming Christmas special, apparently Matt Smith is the Thirteenth and Final Doctor.  What?!  So then they really have been following the numbers rule all along, even if Whovians were the last to know.  But now that Gallifrey has not, in fact, fallen, its more than possible that the Time Lords will grant the Doctor more regenerations, something that seemed less likely before  perhaps as a thank-you for saving the planet?

Two things the creators of Doctor Who manage to do time and time again is to talk themselves out of corners that they had painted themselves into, and to move us to unmatched levels of emotion.  The 50th anniversary special certainly accomplished that, and much more, culminating with its final shot.

Now, we can prepare ourselves to weep on Christmas as we say goodbye to Matt Smith.  But hey, were also saying hello to Peter Capaldi  a Doctor who may not be as dark now as we may have been initially led to believe.  Interesting things to come indeed.",1385683200,2,5183,4.56926406926407

5965865,5,B00F37VHPM,"The Day Of The Doctor features both Matt Smith and David Tennant who unexpectedly collide with each other in this episode/film.  There is also a serious meeting with their past incarnation from their homeworld (played by  John Hurt). They are important to dealing with shapeshifters who seem to want to invade the earth.  All three men do an illustrious job of collaborating together in their roles as time lords who must deal with both their home world of Gallifrey and the shapeshifters.  It was a good idea to have Bille Piper return. Billie Piper and Jenna Coleman also give strong performances in their roles as vital helpers to the Doctors personal evolution (Coleman in the companion role and Piper as a powerful interface of a superweapon).  Parts of the plot involve returning to the time era of Queen Elizabeth.  I must refrain from saying more out of consideration for those who have yet to see The Day Of The Doctor.  However, this is a thrilling science fiction movie that plays with the idea of what can happen if one is given the chance to see their future selves materialize before them.

5965877,3,B00F37VHPM,"I had really high expectations for The Day of the Doctor, given all the promotion and excitement leading up to it, so it's probably not a surprise that I was disappointed after watching it. In retrospect I believe the purpose of this anniversary special was more of a celebration rather than The Best Doctor Who Episode Of All Time (as I said, I had high hopes!), which makes sense but was not, in my opinion, the special we were ""pitched"". I understand why fans are pleased with the references and inside jokes, but I've got to align myself with those who admit that the special could have been much, much more.

The introduction we were given to Hurt's Doctor at the end of The Name of the Doctor made me expect a very dark, emotional episode that was going to make me empathize with the Doctor, and understand why Hurt's Doctor is kept tucked away in the future Doctor's memory. But, the episode was surprisingly lighthearted - hearkening back to the ""celebratory"" purpose I mentioned earlier.

The pacing was off, there were too many filler scenes, too much quick-fire dialogue so if you miss an explanation, you're lost . . . not enough character development for Hurt's Doctor, which is a pity since this is (apparently) the only time we'll accompany him on any adventures. There wasn't much focus in the episode - it felt very scattered . . . the subplot was necessary for ONE detail that links it to the main plot, and for such a small detail, that subplot took up way too much screen time. Ten didn't always feel like the usual Ten, from facial expressions to attitude. I thought there was going to be more emphasis on the ""war"" part of The Time War . . .

The basic mechanics of the plot are clever, there's no denying that. But I think the anniversary special tried to be too many things at once.",1385596800,5,1806,4.5

Not only will you 'not' get Amazon's attention in doing so, but you'll hurt the success of the product you may actually love.

For future reference...If you like a product, rate it well.  If you dislike a product rate it poorly.  If you dislike a price, feel fee to mention it within the written review and then contact Amazon directly.  The star rating, however, simply is not the place to take out your pricing frustration.

5965884,4,B00F37VHPM,"I have mixed feeling about The Day Of The Doctor. In many ways I love it and have already pre-ordered the Blu-ray even before I saw it in the cinema, and I thought the 3D aspect was very good. The best 3D I've seen since the Doctor Who Experience actually which was the best with the Pandorica and Daleks and Matt Smith's Doctor.
I enjoyed TDOTD very much but I am a little sad at what could have been, I think Eccleson not doing it was a mistake. It's obvious that it was written with him in mind because Eccleson was the Doctor that was born in war and as wonderful an actor as John Hurt is of course Eccleson should have been there. It also messes up the order because by John Hurt playing an all new Doctor it pushes every Doctor after him forward so now 9 becomes 10, 10 becomes 11 and so forth....
My other big complaint is Billie Piper, she is so overused and my least favorite companion in the new series. Besides that to be honest it would have made a LOT of more sense if Clara had been The Moment for John Hurt's Doctor instead of a Rose clone because after all we had just seen Clara enter The Doctor's time stream in The Name Of The Doctor and was able to be in all the places of his life from William Hartnell to Matt Smith. Excepting in these parts I consider TDOTD a success and wonderfully crafted story (note * when Matt Smith is in Trafalgar Square and the TARDIS door is left open we can see inside and the control room is not present but instead we see the inside of the prop! Whoops! Something I fully expect from the classic series but until TDOTD they never missed a beat and normally we would see the control room.)
Seeing Tom Baker was a delight and having him come in as the curator to the museum was brilliant and a fantastic nod, 30 years late from appearing in The Five Doctors but at least we see him join this Anniversary Special...
I think Eccleson made a huge mistake on this one but it is a joy to have John Hurt in it so as I said, mixed feelings on this all around but that won't stop me from enjoying it.
If I had my way we would have had Chris Eccleson instead of John Hurt, a second Clara instead of Billie Piper, the TARDIS control room sliver fixed and Captain Jack Harkness show up! Well... we can't have everything but what we do get is wonderful...",1385510400,3,2293,4.166666666666667

5965889,4,B00F37VHPM,"The Day of the Doctor was a great 50th Anniversary episode. However it is not perfect.
There are two story lines during the episode. One of the stories is about John Hurts Doctor and why he is meeting two other Doctors (played by Matt Smith and David Tennant). The other story is about creatures escaping paintings. I don't want to spoil anything, so Im not going to go into detail about either of the stories. However, I will say that the story about the paintings takes up a big portion of the episode. And while this story would have been good for a normal episode it feels a bit weak for the 50th Anniversary special. Another issue with the episode is that it starts off slow and takes a while before the more entertaining moments happen.
With the negatives out of the way, now Ill explain what I thought was good about the episode. The story about John Hurts Doctor is more interesting than the other story line. Seeing the Doctors work together and the big finale are easily the best moments of the episode. These two things alone almost overshadow the weaker parts of the special. There are also several fan service moments (which range from certain pieces of clothing to a certain actor making an appearance). Finally, the Doctor is given a new purpose to travel through time and space at the end of the special.

5965898,5,B00F37VHPM,"The Day of the Doctor capped the 50th Anniversary of Doctor Who. I remember seeing it in theaters in 2013, when I'd just barely begun New Who and seen a few Hartnell episodes. The second time I'd watched it was after having watched all Seven Series of New Who and hundreds of episodes with the First Five Doctors, and my appreciation for it only grew.

It's cinematic and gorgeous with a quality of effects that is astounding. It's full of great moments, Easter eggs to the show's Classic past, and also key moments that address the events that have shaped New Who. While I wish Christopher Eccleston had come back, John Hurt steps into the role of the Doctor flawlessly and has beautiful chemistry with Matt Smith and David Tennant.

It's a story that looks back at the Doctor's history and what it means to be the Doctor. It's full of humor, nostalgia, and

The story isn't flawless. The Zygon resolution was video contrived. The videos for the climatic scene are obviously out of context stock footage that could have been done better. Still, I have to be honest that none of these flaws dampened my enjoyment of a truly memorable story that was a fitting celebration of 50 years of Doctor Who.",1385424000,,1197,4.610328638497653

5965902,5,B00F37VHPM,"This was a marvelous addition to the series, giving purpose to the future doctor, as well as the endearing quips between three doctors.  It gave us much better insight into the time war with the realization of just how badly it affected the Doctor with repercussions we have seen since #9.  The real gem was the final few moments by Tom Baker who still retains a childish spark behind those eyes.  And when all of the Doctors stood together, it really gave me a sense of how long the journey of 50 years was and the stories that I know, the ones I did not, and the ones--sadly--I can never know.

Doctor Who became for a brief moment something more than a TV show.  It was a shared experience that transcended generations and gave us all something in common.  It was a story worthy of the Doctor.  It was an experience that only the Doctor could give to us.  In the face of a terrible tragedy he gave us a reason to hope, and a reason to believe that we can always place our hopes in him.",1385424000,2,988,4.245989304812834

5965911,4,B00F37VHPM,"Day of the Doctor was good and did exactly what it needed to do for the 50th anniversary. The comedic elements between the three doctors were really funny, and the movie gave us our first real interaction with the Time War, the horrible decision that was made, and the effect it had on everyday people. John Hurt did a great job playing the War Doctor and all the characters were played well, though Elizabeth was probably the weakest. Matt Smith and David Tennant worked well together and you could tell they really enjoyed what they were doing. The choice of the Zygons as the primary villain worked though I do wonder if they could have come up with something better or really used the Daleks more than they did in the anniversary.

If I had to point to anything that didn't completely work for me I would say it was the Billie Piper Bad Wolf character from the show. I enjoyed seeing her again, but it was disappointing that there was never any interaction between her and David Tennant. The Rose/Doctor relationship was a big part of why the show was successful at the time. in the 50th she was just the face they used to play the artifact that was going to be used to end the Time War.

I also had held out hope we would see more of the actual old doctors and not just CGI. The 50th anniversary is a big deal that all should be involved in. Most disappointing was no Christopher Eccleston, even if it was just to finish the regeneration sequence from the War Doctor to the 9th. The older doctors are involved in other 50th anniversary projects outside of this episode, which is good to see, but no matter how good Day of the Doctor was, it does bother me on some level that everyone wasn't in it, even if they had to play other characters.

I had the privilege of watching this in 3D at the local theater, and I went really not being sure if I would be one of the only people going, when the reality was we packed that theater full of Doctor Who fans. Its been a long time since I went to anything where people were cheering and it felt good. Day of the Doctor is worth seeing, but it was so worth it to see it on the big screen with all the other Who fans out there.",1385424000,5,2173,4.256658595641646

The episode is fully worth the money spent. I will most likely be watching it multiple times over the course of the next week, trying to wrap my head around all the insanity and brilliance contained in these too few minutes.

So, the review (where I attempt to be as spoiler free as possible):

There is so much cheating of time and timelines that go on in this episode. Things that were taken for granted are no longer value because everything has now changed.

Many old friends return. Read that again: many. Especially for the old guard who fell in love with the show before the reboot. It has so much for us that it really does make it out to be the 50th anniversary rather than just a big budget adventure somewhere in the season 7 to 8 transition.

For the fanboy/girl, it's a got all the little tidbits and hints and shoutouts that people wish for, but never expect to actually come to fruition. Only, this time, they somehow fit everything into a cohesive, contained story that makes you really have to think about where it fits, how it fits, and HOLY TARDIS OF GALLIFREY, WHAT'RE THEY GOING TO DO NEXT!?",1385337600,5,1221,4.433035714285714

If you're a Doctor Who fan I highly recommend seeing this. However I'm going to wait to purchase this until the price comes down. For the quality of the episode I would gladly pay the price but it seems to have jumped several dollars in the past day or two.

5965937,4,B00F37VHPM,"Overall, I loved the series, but the Day of the Doctor ... I thought it could of been better.  There seemed to be a lot of 'lets undo and hit the rewind button' on stuff that had been canon, aka the Time War.  Also, where was River Song who was so much a part of both the 10th and 11th doctors, or for that matter, where was the 9th Doctor, Christopher Eccleston?  I mean the guy/actor is alive right, was there so much bad blood here that they couldn't include him somewhere in the episode?

why did they switch in Liz the 1st to be the Doctor's wife, to take the place if his wife, River Song?  Why no mention AT all of River song?  Will we ever find out who the Doctor's Grandaughter, Susan Forman's parents were (I'm still rooting that she wasn't really the Doctor's grand daughter, but is/was really his daughter with River song)?

Also, I'm seeing a lot of 'complaining is the polite word here' about the upping of the price by Amazon @ the last minute.

People who got hit with this, were the ones who waited until the last minute to buy and then only wanted to buy the 50th, 1 episode @ a time.

This is why I always get the season pass whenever I want to get a TV show I can't otherwise get (Like in this case, where I don't get BBC American). This way the price is guarenteed by Amazon @ 1.89 an episode for SD (which BTW the SD format WILL play on a HD TV, and is much cheaper), and if you MUST have it in HD, if you get the season pass, the you would get each episode for $2.89 an episode.

For me personaly, I signed up a while back for the Season Pass for the 50th (including all the extras) as soon as it became available on Amazon, as this way I make sure I don't miss a thing, and also they can't jump the price on me either.

Another way is to sign up for Amazon Prime for I think it's $79 a year ... where you would (from my understanding) be able to download anything instant for free after you pay for the membership.  YOu also I think then get free shipping on purchases from Amazon as well if you have a yearly membership with Amazon Prime.

Just a suggestion for future reference for everyone here.

With that being said, I enjoyed this episode quite a bit.  The reason for 4/5 rating is I expected a bit more and it seemed mostly like a longer episode of Doctor Who.  I am a huge fan and this definitely seemed fitting for a 50th anniversary episode, but perhaps a more production value would have helped push it to 5/5.

5965945,3,B00F37VHPM,"I could ramble on for thousands of words but I will condense my thoughts into a quick statement: While this was an excellent Doctor Who special, it was not a great 50th Anniversary Doctor Who special.  The classic era was practically ignored instead to focus the vast majority of its time and effort on the new Who Doctors.  I know some previous anniversary specials have been wanting (a.k.a. Silver Nemesis), but I really wanted to feel the full weight and history of 50 years in this special (more akin to ""The Five Doctors"").  That didn't happen.  If Tom Baker was included, I don't see why the other living classic Doctors couldn't be there too.  We know they were interested based on ""The Five(ish) Doctors: Reboot.""  Good but having a clip show in the final minute doesn't celebrate 50 years.",1385337600,5,798,4.705035971223022

This Revisited episode would have been a lot better if they had expanded the discussion about the 8th to more than just the Fox Movie.  The 8th has been in a multitude of audio dramas over the past decade, with companions alluded to in the mini episode ""Night of the Doctor"" (which for some reason Amazon doesn't have yet).  Also the episode was missing one main ingredient, a discussion with Paul McGann himself.  Not sure if he wasn't invited but with all the involvement he has had with the audio projects and being in ""Night"" I highly doubt he would have said no.

Episode was OK, just needed a bit more detail on the full run of the 8th.",1385337600,,753,4.35
5965950,5,B00F37VHPM,"I'm giving the SHOW 5 stars because that is what we should be rating.  Loved it.

As for the price.

While I do think the price is a little high the price needs to be taken into perspective.

First.  This is 1 hour and 20 minutes, no commercials.  Most other shows on TV are going to be about 45 minutes after commercials are removed.

So if you calculate the cost per minute most shows are .066 a minute while this is .099.  So its about 50% more not really double.  Still higher than average but not all shows cost the same on Amazon.

Second, if you go on over to Itunes where people are saying they will buy it now its the same price.  Google has it for $5.99 but I'm not sure if thats HD or not.  I have never bought from Google, just a reference.

Third, related one and two.  Amazon, Itunes, etc. do not have complete freedom in setting prices.  The content owner does have some say in what things cost.  Part of the price increase COULD be from BBCA not Amazon.  I'm not saying this is the case, just a possibility.

So if you want, go buy from Apple or somewhere else in protest, but you are currently paying the same price, at least on Apple now.",1385337600,3,1156,4.153846153846154

I logged in early this morning and saw the Standard Edition at $2.99.  I gave in and ran over to Bing to have my points redeemed for a $3 Amazon Gift Card, only to return to the show page and have it tell me the price was $4.99 for the Standard Edition!

Now I see it's jumped yet again in 12 hours.

What's more upsetting is that I'm a Amazon Prime member.  Although it would have been nice to see a free streaming version, and I know day-after releases usually don't have free-streaming, it would STILL have been nice if we Amazon Prime members were NOT treated in this manner, let alone how the rest of the faithful Amazon customers have been treated.

It felt much more like a good cliff hanger/season opening story than a celebration of an amazing series reaching it's semi-centennial. In a never again opportunity Moffat ignored chance to use the modern technology and  historic footage to create a dazzling crossover of the 13 Doctors in what could be, arguably perhaps, the greatest Doctor Who story ever told, but rather opted for flashy effects and story that does not reach any further back into the shows history than what has occurred in the scant 8 years since the events in ""Rose"". Aside from it's return there was no other time in the recent Who was Russell Davis needed to giver respect to show and it's history.

If you like flashy effects and care little to not at all about the people involved over the last 50 yrs that kept the show if not always going, but never forgotten then by all means this is a fine episode.

I wasn't able to purchase the episode on Amazon being I had to be somewhere this morning but somehow I'm wishing I would have just bought it.  All those lucky people who bought it this morning got a D-E-A-L!  I came out here now to finally buy the episode and watch it tonight and BAM!  Now the price is $7.99???????????  Sorry but this is unacceptable!!!!!!  I'm so furious my husband told me to calm down before I wrote this.  I will not buy 1 TV episode for $7.99 (I know it's a special but the other specials have never been this much money!).

I also think it's complete garbage that I have to buy a bunch of revisited episodes if I want to purchase Season 8 at the normal Amazon discounted rate.

And by way of actually reviewing the movie itself, as opposed to Amazon's selling practices, this was a wonderfully executed piece and highly appropriate for commemorating Doctor Who's 50th.  It's a great union of new material and acknowledged history.  I do recommend viewing the mini movie ""Night of the Doctor"" for a little backstory to John Hurt's Doctor.

Finally, don't blink. Not on account of Weeping Angels but because you might miss a brilliantly flippant but subtle quip. About what one would expect from Tennant and Smith.

5965984,3,B00F37VHPM,"First of all, I wish people would rate the dumb episode based on whether or not it is ANY GOOD, and not because of the price they charged.

More to the point... definitely could not have given this episode even close to a 4 star rating, and it barely squeaks by as a 3.  Steven Moffat the writer of Doctor Who for the several years, has really brought down the series to being, not only boring, but predictable, overly embarrassingly sentimental, and very, very unimaginative.  Quite honestly, I think ANY of us who are true die-hard Doctor Who fan could have written a better story line celebrating the 50th years to the month of Doctor Who shows, than Moffat.

My complaints are as follows and may complain spoilers, so do not read if you want to know thoughts on the episode before seeing it and judging for yourself.

1.  This was just another ""THE THREE DOCTORS"" episode, which was broadcast in four weekly parts from 30 December 1972 to 20 January 1973.  It starred three Doctors, Pertwee, Troughton, and my favorite Hartnell (who had a very small part since he was very sick at the time).  Basically, it was a story about immortality and the ability to time travel discovered by ""Omega"" who was a Time Lord at the time, but wanted to become mortal again since the time winds had destroyed his body.  You have to watch this episode but there are a lot of cross over plots.  (So much for ""The Day of the Doctor"" being original).

2.  Next, what happened to the trailer where the Gallifreyan Guardsman spotted the first attack of the Dalek's breaking through the time dam's, during the first trailer about the upcoming major episode.

3.  What happened to involving any of the prior companions, which for nostalgic reasons would have meant so much to those of us who are hard-core fans.

4.  Moffat claimed that he wanted a story line in which anyone, EVEN those with absolutely NO ""Doctor Who"" history with the show, could understand it and enjoy it.  IN OTHER WORDS, more concerned with profit than story.

5.  Too much time is spent with the William Hurt Doctor, fussing over what to do and speaking to rose, lots of time that could have been better spent on a better story.  (in other words, time killing, typical Moffat writing style)

6.  The story is boring, unexciting, adds nothing new to understanding the doctor more, and what is with the Doctor having to marry Queen Elizabeth the 1st.  What possible purpose does that hold in an anniversary special.  DUMB, DUMB, DUMB.

7.  Both the two VERY first companions of the doctor, William Russell as Ian Chesterton and the very own Granddaughter of the doctor also not involved in the anniversary special.  Personally, I would LOVE to have known WHY the doctor felt the need to escape from Gallifrey and what was the true relationship between himself and Susan his Granddaughter.  They could have covered this at the very beginning for a lousy 5 minutes instead of the Tardis swinging stupidly from a helicopter to Buckingham palace.

8.  Why the Zygons in this Anniversary special... they did not play a huge role as his adversary during the past 50 years and made no impact on the excitement of the story-line.

9.  William Hurt as the Doctor who decides to destroy all of Gallifrey and the Dalek's is never mentioned in any prior episodes and they had a whopping 12 doctors to choose from who could have been responsible for that action, such as Tom Baker, and then he would have had a MUCH bigger role.  Personally, his appearance was the only thrill I got from the show.

10. Where is Romanadvoratrelundar, for short known only as Romana, I know, I know, she is in E-Space, but she is the 2nd Time Lord to be alive in the Universe so the Doctor, technically is NOT really alone,  Lalla Ward, who played her after the KEY OF TIME series, is still alive and would be wonderful to have seen again, helping the Doctor, or even just with assisting Tom Baker.  She played a crucial role during the recovery of the Key of Time, yet she continues to go on unheard, but ""Riversong"" (Rori and Amy Ponds child) is always showing up in every episode, saying ""Spoilers!""

11.  This was the BIGGEST opportunity on the planet for Doctor Who to shine after 50 years of running and it was like any other Moffat episode, I even read he was very worried about this episode being liked after its release.  They could have brought back ""Russell T. Davies""  The BEST damn writer from 2005 starting with Eccleston and Tennent.  Moffat made a sporadic for the show from (2005-2013).  A collaboration of the best sci-fi writers in Britain was what was really called for in order to pull off this show.

12.  Lastly, I don't know where the show will go on from here, the newest Doctor is actor, Peter Capaldi, who was last seen on a Doctor Who episode called ""Fires of Pompeii.""  From his appearance only, he looks more like an aging, experienced doctor than the pin-ups we have been getting before, except for David Tennent whom in my opinion, is right up there with Tom Baker, and William Hartnell as great Doctors.

13.  By the way, in another trailer the showed a look alike Doctor William Hartnell in the junk yard where it all started, but never saw him???  Bad teasing trailers to disappoint you after spending your $7.95 to watch the move length episode.

And, there you have it, 13 complaints for 13 time-lords, btw, whatever happened to it was impossible for any Time-Lord to regenerate MORE than 12 times.  Hmmmm.  So, there you have it 13 complaints.

I imagine they believe no one can count in the 21st Century.  You know even in Star Trek they cared about ""Continuity,"" maybe in Britain money and a long standing sci-fi series speaks louder than that?  The ""Master"" the Doctor's arch enemy jumped through unimaginable hoops to extend his regeneration, apparently the Doctor has a get out of Death card.

Thanks for reading my review, and please keep my personal complaints in mind, I am not a troll of the ""Doctor Who"" show, I am more-overly an extreme fan-boy of the show and was born in 1963, 2 months before the first Doctor Who even aired.  Grew up on it every since. I love the show, which is why I am so fed up where it is being taken to, and both its overly commercialized actions for BBC profits instead of entertainment as it used to be.

5965999,4,B00F37VHPM,"Since the reboot of Doctor Who in 2005 with Christopher Ecclestone as the battle-scarred Doctor, the series has had some great moments and some wonderful actors. While the current lead writer/script wrangler Moffat may lack the sureness of touch possessed by the former lead writer Russell T Davis, he's undoubtedly been responsible for some of the best individual episodes. Now, however, comes the greatest challenge: writing a 50th Anniversary Special that will satisfy the fandom, enthrall new viewers, and somehow maintain continuity with all that has gone before.

The bad news first: Ecclestone refused to participate in the making of this Anniversary Special, which meant that Moffat was forced to write around the absence of that particular Doctor. It also meant that Ecclestone's particular blend of menace and manic energy was unavailable - a great shame, as it would have made the moments with all three Doctors much more engaging and edgy. But it was not to be, for reasons best known only to Ecclestone himself. So Moffat had to create a hitherto unknown Doctor and the great John Hurt was slotted into the part. Without the context of prior appearances as the Doctor, however, this wasn't entirely satisfactory - yet what alternatives did the writer truly have? It's a bit like trying to arrange a Beatles reunion with only a couple of the original members.

The good news is that the work-around solution does come close to working. The plot is quite clever (although internally inconsistent, but who cares?) and many of the old favorites emerge to please die-hard fans. Some will quibble with the appearance of a former companion in body but not spirit (despite the use of a well-known catch-phrase later on) and perhaps a more confident writer would have let the Tennant Doctor interact with his most beloved companion, but these are minor quibbles. The biggest single problem arises from the casting of Queen Elizabeth the First. This was a woman who overcame tremendous obstacles and ruled over a very unstable kingdom for many years. She should be a powerful, intense, yet vulnerable character. For some reason both the script editor and the casting supervisor felt it was a good idea to portray Elizabeth as a kind of mentally retarded overweight schoolgirl with all the gravitas of SpongeBob SquarePants. Fortunately the plot races along and we're spared too many embarrassments but... surely someone, at some point in the production, should have had the courage to point out the mistake? And then rectify it?

Overall this was a competent effort and the use of references (in so many places) to former stories, characters, and props means that dedicated Whoovians will spend the next few days re-playing the episode to ensure that they spot every single one.

The end of the tale also sets up the next Doctor for a new journey (always a useful plot device) and, in theory at least, the appearance of a much-loved Doctor as an aged Curator seems to imply that regeneration isn't necessarily The End for any particular Doctor. Perhaps a writer in future will use this opening to great creative effect - or perhaps it will go down in the annals of Whodom as a throw-away anachronism. Personally I'd use it for all it's worth, in tiny doses at precisely the right moments.

In short, not as great as it could have been but very, very close. Let's hope the 60th Anniversary Special is even better!",1385251200,11,3415,4.932173913043478

5966010,5,B00F37VHPM,"every blue moon or so a character comes along who is so uniquely unique that there is frankly no room for the possibility of influence. you ""borrow"" even the slightest element and the parallel is so distinct that it can't help looking like a rip-off. (or ""homage"" if you wanna be a diplomat.) you can't, for instance, present your own ""apeman"" and not remind people of Tarzan. you can't present your own little old lady detective and not remind people of Miss Marple. you can't present your own hero serial killer and not remind people of Dexter. and you can't present your own unfettered wanderer through Time and Space without reminding people of a certain Timelord.
and the Timelord in question shows no sign of winding down. nevermind the original 26 seasons, the 8 years the revived series has lasted could be several lifetimes in television years. so why isn't the concept runnin' out of steam yet? because it's unique recipe of heart, poignancy, and imagination is damn potent, that's why. take this example...
the two most recent versions of Our Hero, nos. 10 (David Tennant) and 11 (Matt Smith), join the hitherto unseen incarnation who pressed the panic button to end the ""Time War"" and destroyed Gallifrey all those years (or centuries) ago, played by John Hurt. the decision was equal parts noble and ghastly, and together they grapple with it's ramifications. and as if their hands weren't full enough, there's also an attempted invasion of Earth to deal with, this time by the Zygons. (one wonders if that wasn't one of David Tennant's demands. he never got face them in his heyday, despite his having stated that they were his favorite alien species from the original series.)
the aficianados will remember that previous such anniversary adventures had featured every Doctor up to that point, so this one's inability to do so may feel a little off. that can be good or bad: the 20th anniversary's ""The Five Doctors"" is somewhat uneven because they had to somehow accomodate so many of him, not to mention various sidekicks. on top of which, several bits of WHO effluvia - the Daleks, for instance - made utterly illogical cameo appearances soley for the marquis value. (Tom Baker upset a few people by declining to appear, but ironically he ended up doing them a favor. his absence meant there was that much less convoluted intricacy for them to have to come up with.)
whereas the 10th anniversary's ""The Three Doctors"" concentrated simply upon bringing together the three in question, and the result was a much more streamlined affair. a couple years after ""Five,"" ""The Two Doctors"" - in which the underrated Colin Baker meets the first great Doctor, Patrick Troughton - would further demonstrate that, for story's sake, you can multiply your Doctors only so far.
and i'm happy to say that DAY OF THE DOCTOR follows the latter examples. the only major plot-related tip of the hat to the days of old is a Doctor's consciense character taking the form of Rose Tyler. it's handful of more incidental such salutes are mecifully discarded once they've served their purpose. (i do have to admit i was quite tickled by the ""round things"" moment.) i'm sure they were tempted to try to work in some wink at K9 or Torchwood or The Key To Time or his relationship with The Master, but wiser heads prevail. unlike John Nathan-Turner (producer at the time of ""The Five Doctors""), Steven Moffat understands that he can present either an adventure or a retrospective. however neat-o the idea of both at once might seem, the result can't help but be a cumbersome mess. (especially when one considers how much The Doctor's world has developed since it's 20th year.)
and of course we can't overlook the nifty cameo appearance by one Tom Baker. whether it's enough to compensate for his absence from ""The Five Doctors"" is for anyone to surmise. i think so, if only because it serves the story.
in short, what we have here is an engaging and unpredictable ride which more than demonstrates why The Doctor has (to borrow a phrase from one of his spiritual bretherin) lived long and prospered. and why he will continue to do so for a few more years (or should i say centuries) at least.

[NOTE: i do hope i don't seem to be dissing ""The Five Doctors"" too severely. it's not the most tightly structured exercise in storytelling ever attempted, but it's not without it's charms either. it's just not one of my top 100 (or however many) episodes, that's all.]",1385251200,4,4450,4.7717250324254215

I'm going to start this review off by saying that I will offer no spoilers beyond the confirmation that, quite regrettably, Christopher Eccleston does not appear in Day of the Doctor. It is disappointing but thankfully Smith, Hurt, Piper, and Tennant more than make up for his absence.

A phone call from U.N.I.T. sets off a fascinating chain of events that eventually brings 11, 10, and the Warrior together. The action is fast, the story is fun, the Doctors are an absolute joy to watch, and by the end of the special, the series will be headed in a bold new direction. There are several other surprise appearances that I will absolutely not spoil. Suffice to say that fans, new and old, will be very, very happy with them.

This special was as close to perfect, without Eccleston, as it could get, though I do wish the villains were a little more threatening, though that is nothing more than a nitpick. Smith and Tennant are simply marvelous together, and John Hurt only makes them more fun to watch. All in all, The Day of the Doctor is a fantastic tale that no Whovian should miss.",1385164800,326,1246,4.582959641255606
5966020,5,B00F37VHPM,"Note: This review contains SPOILERS.

As someone who discovered Doctor Who with the 2005 revival series, I have greatly enjoyed all 7 (so far) seasons and all 3 (again, so far) incarnations of the Doctor.  And I've slowly been working my way backwards in time to catch up with the ""classic"" era episodes on DVD.  I've bought plenty of books and collectibles as well.  I am a fan.

So, like all fans, I was very excited about this highly-touted 50th anniversary episode, which sees, among other things, the return of 10th Doctor David Tennant.  And I will say right here and now that Tennant's interactions with 11th Doctor Matt Smith are among the best parts of the episode.  The episode has a very cinematic feel to it, and I regret not taking advantage of the opportunity to see it (in 3-D, no less) on the big screen.  It looks fantastic, and the main story is very engaging.

On the downside, I was quite disappointed that Billie Piper was only playing a sort of Rose Tyler avatar, not the real character.  There is really no reason for her to be there (the character even admits she has appeared to the wrong Doctor, but never changes her appearance).  And although John Hurt is a fine actor and does his best with the material, I never really felt that his character was as dark as the 11th Doctor indicated at the end of the previous episode.

And even with one delightful cameo, I still feel there were some missed opportunities here.  It IS a good story, and one that's important to the show's overall mythology.  But it needed to be bigger, with more guest stars.  It needed to be an EVENT, and I just feel it fell short of that ambition.

Like I said, I'm a fan.  And I'll definitely be buying this.  I look forward to seeing it in 3-D.  And maybe I'll like it more the second time around. . .we'll see.

UPDATE: I've just viewed the 3-D Blu-ray, and I am happy to raise my rating from 4 to 5 stars.  While I do stand by my comments above, watching the episode in 3-D really made for a much richer experience.  On the technical side, it's as good as any 3-D theatrical release I've viewed on my home screen.  The early scene with the TARDIS being lifted by helicopter over London is breathtaking, as are the panoramic views of old England with the 10th Doctor and Elizabeth I.  Since the show itself went to high definition in 2009, it has been among the most visually-striking programs in production.  ""The Day of the Doctor"" raises the bar even higher.

The disc also contains a 13-minute ""making of"" featurette, narrated by 6th Doctor Colin Baker.  Make sure you watch the episode first, though, as the special does give away some major plot points.  There are also a handful of delete scenes (nothing earth-shaking), two trailers, and a nice overview of the series in general.  This last feature is basically another, longer (46 min.) episode of the ""Doctor Who Revisited"" series.

If you have the equipment, and are a Doctor Who fan, this is absolute must-have.  More than anything, it really made me wish ALL future episodes of the show could be in 3-D.",1385164800,2,3070,4.517241379310345

5966029,5,B00F37VHPM,"""Doctor Who At the Proms"" is an awesome version of this great concert, conducted by the wonderful Ben Foster, with very high video and audio quality even over streaming (the HD version is worth the extra  dollar). This version only edits out some of the talky bits, Orff's ""O Fortuna"" and the Oodish ""Song of Freedom"" from the original Radio 3 broadcast. As far as I can recall, all of the special appearances and hosting are intact in this 90 minute version.

I personally find this to be the most enjoyable of the Doctor Who Proms (compared to 2008 and 2013) in terms of the Murray Gold compositions selected (heavy on Series 5), and the surprise appearances (NO SPOILERS!). This video and performance includes:
- ""Mad Man with a Box""
- ""Fish Custard""
- ""I Am the Doctor""
- Gustav Holst's ""The Planets: Mars (Bringer of War)""
- ""Battle in the Skies (Daleks vs Spitfire)""
- ""Amy""
- ""Liz, Lizards, Vampires and Vincent""
- Richard Wagner's ""Die Walk&uuml;re  The Ride of the Valkyries""
- ""This is Gallifrey"" / ""Vale Decem""  ((( you will want to cheer and cry as you watch this marvelous segment )))
- ""Pandorica Suite""
- ""Doctor Who Theme""

For those who watch this on a Kindle Fire that has X-Ray, this is a super feature with this video... real-time cast listings, trivia and song titles as it plays along. Although I have this video on one of my DVDs, I'm absolutely loving this version on my Knidle Fire HDX, and will certainly be looking for more Doctor Who specials for my collection.",1384905600,2,1489,4.582706766917293

But where is Christopher Eccleston? In July 2012, Christopher Eccleston spoke positively of his time on Doctor Who during a talk at the National Theatre. This led to speculation he was considering making a return appearance as the Ninth Doctor for the show's 50th anniversary in 2013. The current Doctor, Matt Smith, stated that he would love Eccleston to return but Eccleston declined for some reason after discussing with executive producer Steven Moffat to return to Doctor Who. And where is Captian Jack Harkness? played by John Barrowman.
 We want both Christopher Eccleston and Captain Jack, Back! :(

BBC America has revealed the title and photo from ""Doctor Who's"" upcoming 50th anniversary episode, which will be called ""The Day of the Doctor."" The photo shows the sideviews of both Matt Smith and David Tennant, the tenth doctor, with veteran star, John Hurt walking toward us from an explosion.

Hoping they show a clip of all the actors who played Doctor Who and his companions for the last 50 years. I started watching as a kid on PBS Channel 9 back in the day, early 70's, with The Third Doctor Jon Pertwee who played him from 1970-1974.

""Doctor Who: Day of the Doctor

""The Day of the Doctor"" stars outgoing Doctor Matt Smith, predecessor David Tennant, Jenna Coleman, Billie Piper and John Hurt. The special marks the first time Tennant and Piper have appeared in the series since their farewells in 2010. According to BBC America, the special will be ""a celebration for long-time fans and an opportunity for those new to the series to jump onboard."" But Clara Oswald the Doctor's new companion or Clara Oswin Oswald, otherwise known as the Impossible Girl as she keeps Popping up and coming back after death thru-out Time played by newcomer Jenna-Louise Coleman is still my most favorite companion for Doctor Who as she's the only one who can out-talk Doctor Who. The new Clara was ""more grounded and so far easier for the viewer to latch on to"" than her two predecessors, both of which could have been harder to sustain as companions and she has the potential to be ""a truly great companion"", and that it was ""refreshing to see a companion who isn't in total awe of the Doctor... and she's not afraid to take the lead when she needs to. Moffat chose her for the role because she worked the best alongside Smith and could actually talk faster than him. Also Incarnations of herself are scattered throughout the Doctor's history, appearing to every known face of the Doctor and saving his life in numerous ways--for the most part unnoticed--and even ensuring that the First Doctor (William Hartnell) picks the right TARDIS on his home planet, prior to the events of the show's first episode.

In a statement, Smith said: ""The Day of the Doctor is nearly here! Hope you all enjoy. There's lots more coming your way, as the countdown to the 50th begins now.""

Steven Moffat, lead writer and executive producer of ""Doctor Who"" said: ""50 years has turned 'Doctor Who' from a television show into a cultural landmark. Personally I can't wait to see what it becomes after a hundred.""

""The Thick of It"" star ""Peter Capaldi"" will replace Smith in the titular role beginning with Season 8.

Veteran Star ""John Hurt"" has revealed that his role in the 50th anniversary episode of TV's Doctor Who was one of the `toughest' challenges of his career.

The actor, who will play an earlier reincarnation of the Time Lord in The Day Of The Doctor said, ""He had `given his life' over to the part so he could get to grips with the script's `quasi-scientific nonsense'.

The 73-year-old star of the Alien, Elephant Man and the Harry Potter movies also dismissed a lot of modern television as `PAP' and said he was planning to cut back on his work commitments so he could spend more time indulging his passion for Painting.

Hurt, who will star with Matt Smith and David Tennant in the episode, said: `It was one of the toughest parts I have had to learn, as difficult as anything I have done.

`There is a lot of quasi-scientific nonsense which doesn't stay in your head that easily and that meant entire weekends spent on solid learning.

`I remember Matt said I'd have to give my life over to it because there is a lot of learning and very little time to shoot.' I thought he was kidding.

Hurt's unexpected debut as the ""War Doctor"" in the dying seconds of the last series caused a sensation when it was broadcast in May. Last week the BBC released an online mini-episode, which revealed that his character had regenerated from the Eighth Doctor, played by Paul McGann.

""The Zygons"" and ""The Daleks"" will also be featured in the special as the Enemies. It has been confirmed that ""paintings"" will be a plot point of the episode, and that the ""Time War"" will be explained.",1384819200,10,4887,4.698245614035088

Amazon is not saying if they will include special 3d glasses for this disc but maybe if we cross our fingers, this will be the case.

It has been confirmed that ""paintings"" will be a plot point of the episode, and that the ""Time War"" will be explained. The Zygons  first appeared in the Fourth Doctor serial Terror of the Zygons, where it was revealed that centuries ago, the Zygon homeworld was destroyed in a stellar explosion. A craft escaped and somehow made it to Earth, where it then crashed into Loch Ness. When the Doctor encountered the Zygons, they were led by a warlord named Broton. Broton wished to conquer the world to allow a refugee fleet of Zygons to colonize Earth. The Zygons have shape-shifting abilities, allowing them to replicate the appearance of another being, but they must keep the subject alive in order to use its body print. This skill was vital in their concealment and in their scheme to seize power despite their small numbers. The Zygons were also accompanied by an armoured cyborg creature called the Skarasen, the lactic fluid of which was necessary for them to feed. The Skarasen became the Loch Ness Monster. Tenth Doctor actor David Tennant has stated that they are his favourite monsters from Doctor Who.",1384560000,9,5777,4.7279046673286995

8611861,5,B00F37VHPM,"""The Day of the Doctor"" celebrates the 50th anniversary of ""Doctor Who"" by telling the story of the end of the Time War, an event only hinted at since Russell T. Davies revived the series in 2005. The 11th Doctor (Matt Smith) must work with his previous incarnations, the 10th Doctor (David Tennant) and the War Doctor (between 8 and 9, played by John Hurt), in order to forestall a Zygon invasion and reconsider his own past decision to burn both the Daleks and the Time Lords. Billie Piper even makes an appearance! The story includes references too all incarnations of the Doctor, including the 12th (Peter Capaldi) who had yet to appear in the series at the time this aired. Steven Moffat works in a role for a particularly poignant cameo as well.
This DVD includes the episode itself plus two web shorts that set up events. One of these, ""The Last Day"", focuses on the Dalek attack on Arcadia and the other, """"The Night of the Doctor"", features Paul McGann's second and final on-screen role as the Eighth Doctor as he becomes the War Doctor (McGann played the Doctor in various radio stories, which he briefly references here). This, paired with the TV film ""An Adventure in Time and Space,"" was a fitting celebration of 50 years of stories.",1515715200,3,1246,4.642533936651584
