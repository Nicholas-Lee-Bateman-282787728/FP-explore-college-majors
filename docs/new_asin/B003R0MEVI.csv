8402937,5,B003R0MEVI,"The best medical series of the 1960s was Dr. Kildare. Starring Richard Chamberlain and Raymond Massey. Great actors, excellent writing. What more could you want? The stories are compassionate, sometimes with humor, sometimes with sadness, often like life itself. The moral of the stories is usually that doctors are only humans but they try their best (at least they try their best in this TV series) to help their patients. Production values, direction and camera work are all good on this series. High quality TV shows never go out of style so let's see Dr. Kildare come to DVD.",1361836800,6,580,4.8686868686868685
