1652590,2,B00005R24L,"""I Quattro dell'apocalisse"" is a good example of the spaghetti western at the end of its run: sensationalistic, self-referential, often tedious, yet sporadically brilliant.  For Lucio Fulci surely has his moments in this film: the greatest is when Lynne Frederick (who plays ""Bunny"" O'Neill) gives birth in an isolated, mountain mining town inhabited solely by men, the entire population of which waits silently outside the saloon in hopes of hearing the baby's first cry.  It's a stunning moment, visually and narratively.  Unfortunately, Fulci too often descends into gratuitous sadism, such as when Tomas Milian (as ""Chaco,"" a rather banally gruesome outlaw) tortures an unlucky lawman or when Fabio Testi (as Stubby Preston, the film's ostensible anti-hero) attempts to remove a bullet from a comrade's leg.  The massacre that opens the film (in which townspeople rid themselves of local ""undesirables"") is also an act of pure gratuity: poorly filmed and edited, it seems simply a warm-up for Fulci's subsequent horror film techniques.  Although the bare bones of the plot is intriguing--four of the town's ""undesirables"" are allowed to ""escape"" into the desert where they are further victimized by Chaco while attempting to make it to a rather mythical place called ""Salt City""--the film's heavy-handed symbolic imagery, outrageously dated scoring, and perfunctory ""revenge plot"" coda, are surely not what Bret Harte had in mind all those years ago.  Unless you're a big fan of Fulci's special brand of film-making, ""Four of the Apocalypse"" is best viewed as a curiosity or a final nail in the spaghetti western's coffin.",1031788800,2,1626,5.33203125
1652591,5,B00005R24L,"I normally despise westerns because of their indifference toward plot and the dull ways they present development. More often than not, there is a definitive lesson to be learned from the one or two ""good guys"" of the film, and the ""trials and tribulations"" faced aren't that harsh at all. There may be loss and suffering, but it isn't truly loss or suffering. Its normally just padder. Well, that all changes when Lucio, who seems to thrive on tormenting his main characters, picks up where most Westerns leave off.
I was impressed by the uniqueness of some of the characters he presents as well as the way that Lucio opens the floodgates for the characters to experience. For starters, there's a versatile villain to keep up with, one that introduces himself in a rather helpful way before going into his more sadistic, more enjoyably graphic, truths behind the ""good guy"" mask. There's also one of the main four, a black gentleman that sees and speaks to the dead, that seems rather off the chart for most frontier movies, and that's just the beginning. Also, while traveling along the way, there are other odds and ends characters add to the story being woven.
This, added to the fact that the movie didn't succumb to the ""be a Western"" pressures made it much more than watchable. It made me want to get a good friend like Chaco on DVD, too.",1016323200,,1344,4.651260504201681
1652592,5,B00005R24L,"To begin with, I hate westerns. Westerns continually bore me. But I love the films of Lucio Fulci (The Beyond, Zombie). So I thought I would give it a try. It turned out to be one of the greatest gambles I ever made ... It was a beautiful movie from start to finish. It is definitely Fulci down to the last drop. A lot of details are paid to the violence. And there are some scenes that were banned from America the first time and for good reason. If you have a weak stomach, Fulci might not be the director for you.
 Normally, I don't appreciate the voices used when selecting voice-over dubs. But the voice they got for the black guy was very expressive and emotional. The movie is filled with poignance. And you have to admit the scene in the mining town when the miners are gambling over what the gender of the baby's gonna be, and then he is born and every miner stops and faces towards that little building is one of the most beautiful of all time. There's some nudity, disturbing scenes, graphic (and I'm not kidding) violence.
 If you have a strong stomach and love westerns or well-written stories, Four of the Apocalypse is definitely for you.",1015372800,,1153,4.408450704225352
1652593,4,B00005R24L,"It's unusual to see a Western in which an extended sequence is devoted to giving birth.  And when you combine that with other scenes that include torture and rape, it's definitely unique.  Even so, the torture scene is cheesy (the fake skin and blood are ridiculously obvious), and the rape scene is really not that graphic (the juicy parts are not shown).  BUT--now add to this peculiar mixture a serious alcoholic and a total nutjob who cavorts in cemeteries and winds up being a cannibal and you could honestly say there is truly no other Western like this one.
Fulci here includes elements much more characteristic of his horror films that were just around the corner, but with the birthing scene--in which all the townsfolk (all men) are genuinely sympathetic and warm--he shows a side of him that no one familiar with his work ever would have suspected.
While it's true that the three or four songs in the soundtrack come close to ruining the film--these songs are way beyond cheesy; they're putrid--the presence of Tomas Milian as the evil Chaco does much to counteract the effect of the songs. This character is not one-dimensionally evil.  At first he helps the four stragglers (the gambler, the prostitute, the drunk and the nutjob) by shooting oodles of wild game.  When he turns bad it's a pleasure to watch, because he does so much more subtly than is usually portrayed in Euro-Westerns.
This is a truly curious blending of various elements that set it apart, without question, from any other Western around, Euro or American.  If you can get past the terrible songs (at least they don't take up the majority of the soundtrack), this is a film worth seeing.",1014076800,4,1670,4.78125
1652594,5,B00005R24L,"A MASTERPIECE! THE BEST SPAGHETTI WESTERN OF EVER. THE MOST UNPOLITE SON OF LUCIO FULCI, WITH FABIO TESTI: TERRIFIC, YOU'LL NEVER FORGET HIS BEARD! BUY IT IF YOU ARE INSANE!",1006732800,3,173,4.8
1652625,2,B00005R24L,"This Lucio Fulci directed spaghetti Western suffers from one thing, which almost manages to bring the whole thing down: hype. The violence in this film, hyped to be extra gory leading to the film being banned and suppressed in several nations, was quite tame by Fulci's standards, hell, even spaghetti Western standards. The film itself is quite surreal, not in a Buuel or Jodorowsky sense, but rather in that it has a completely dreamlike feel to it. Seems that part of the environment is always falling on the characters: dirt, rain, and snow. Are they being washed of their sins, or did Fulci simply want to dirty his actors? It is difficult to gather a reading of the film. Much Christian allegory throughout, even an outright baptismal toward the later part of the film that seems out of place with everything that happened before it. I don't know if the allegory was intentional. Seems more to me like Fulci conjured up several ideas for the film and as soon as he got to film them, became bored with said ideas and moved on to something else. There is a scene, for example, where two of the wanderers are given meat from a third wanderer. Turns out they were eating human meat, which one of the wanderers discovers in horrific fashion. Nothing is said about this afterward, almost like it never happen. Ideas come and go haphazardly. There are much better spaghetti Westerns. And there are definitely much better Fulci's.",1295827200,,1428,4.738955823293173
1652626,1,B00005R24L,"There is little in this movie to warrant watching it.  It starts off as a kind of MAVERIC (remember the tv show) but then degenerates quickly to a confused kind of evangelistic horror western (if there is such a thing).

There is some potential for interest in the movie.  For example, given at the start, the town kills all its ""degenerates"" in a bid the clean itself up by this purging, why did the sheriff choose these four to save by putting them in jail and then helpling them get out of town.  If it was just for the cash why bother with all four?  Why not just the one guy with the money?  What made these four special?  Alas, this is never revealed.  And so goes the rest of the movie.

The lack of any kind of flow between events makes the movie useless.  For example, when the four arrive in a rain-storm at a deserted town they start a fire in one building to get warm.  So when did the drunk with the shot leg make his way to another building, why was he dead, and why was his left butt cheek carved up like a turkey?  Did Butt the black guy who sees ghosts and is also now missing, pick up a flesh eating habit from Chaco the bad gunman?  No explanation (maybe it is just as well).

Makes little sense, has no flow, has no value.

1652627,2,B00005R24L,"For my dollar Sergio Leone is the benchmark for all Spaghetti Westerns. ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"" is not only the best Spaghetti Western ever made it ranks in my top 100 movies of all time. I know there were a ton of these to hit the States in light of Leone's success and, as happens, some would be better than others. That anyone even considers this one of the better ones boggles my mind. It's not even in the running.

This is one of the worst and dumbest movies I've ever seen. For all intents and purposes it's a Spaghetti Western Road Movie. The ""Hero"" (a card sharp) gets thrown into the local jail with a drunk, a hooker and a crazy black dude. When were jails ever co-ed? Some masked guys ride in and shoot up the town and kill untold numbers of people. We don't know who they are, why they are doing this and we never hear from them or about them again. The sheriff might know because he calmly sits in the jail house eating his dinner as all of this is happening and is not the least bit concerned about it all. The next morning he lets our four cell-mates free and they all head off together. Why? We don't know. After they're freed there is no reason for these people to want to hang together, but there they are hitting the road for some mindless adventure.

The entire movie is filled with stuff like this. Things just happen. There is no cause or effect. When they pick up Chako, things are going pretty well, but after a night of drinking and copious amounts of Peyote Chako turns on them, ties three of the four up (why not the fourth?) and leaves them to die. And when he finds out the fourth freed the other three he gets pissed and wants to track them down and kill them, which he could have done at the outset. This is dumb beyond the meaning of the word. Stuff like this keeps happening throughout the movie.

It isn't directed all that well. It isn't shot all that well. Some of the music is OK but there are some circa 60s, west coast sounding songs that are awful beyond belief. I can't really comment on the acting because the dubbing erased much of what might have existed. They DID mix the sound of the gun-shots well though if that counts for anything.

The beginning of the film states this is the most complete print available. Is it the most complete print that ever existed we'll never know. And this might account for the clunkiness of the proceedings, but by any standard this is a sub-standard entry into the genre. Unless it's your mission to see every Spaghetti Western ever made, I'd give this a pass.",1287619200,,2549,4.315240083507307
1652628,2,B00005R24L,"Owing to the fact that i am a huge Fulci fan i was very excited about seeing Four of the apocalypse. I have enjoyed a wide spectrum of his movies including the beyond, conquest, house by the cemetary, city of the living dead, new york ripper, contraband, lizard in a womans skin, don't torture a duckling etc etc.
Unfortunately with four of the apocalypse,i was very disappointed. The acting is good and im a fan of Fabio Testi but the pace is slow and plodding, the soundtrack awful and there is very little of Fulcis signature violence to speak of !
Worth a look but for Fulci completists only, I would certainly recommend renting this first before you buy it !",1229385600,2,663,4.487603305785124
1652629,5,B00005R24L,"Lucio Fulci, Italian gore meister, shocked me with ""Four of the Apocalypse.""  Except for the scene where Chaco is slicing a patch of skin from his captive's stomach, this movie isn't as gory as I suspected it would be.  I don't understand why it was never released in America.  It is a very emotional movie starring Italian hunk Fabio Testi who starred in one of my favorite Italian gialli, ""What Have You Done to Solange?""  It also has British beauty Lynne Frederick of Pete Walker's ""Schizo"" and Hammer Production's ""Vampire Circus"" - one of my favorite Hammer films.

  Testi and Frederick are locked together in the town jail when the good people decide to massacre everyone in a nearby saloon.  They are freed, along with two others, and head across the desert towards another town.  They are befriended by Chaco who betrays, tortures, and leaves them to die in the hot desert sun.  They do manage to survive the attack, but they have no food, water, or transportation.  Testi, a gambler, vows to obtain revenge against Chaco.

  ""Four of the Apocalypse"" is a violent, emotionally packed tour de force of betrayal and revenge.  I became emotionally attached to the four friends who struggle to survive.  There are several scenes where I cried.  I felt their pain.  Their loss was my loss.  I was very glad when Testi got his revenge!!

  A beautifully filmed movie, ""Four of the Apocalypse,"" has grandiose scenes of breathtaking mountains and deserts.  I especially enjoyed the snow falling on the mountain village.  (During filming, Testi caught a bad flu and was bedridden for several days.)  The pop 70's music was great; there were several songs I wanted to sing along with.  Great direction was provided by Lucio Fulci who has proved that he was a great film director of all genres.

  ""Four of the Apocalypse"" is a must have for all fans of Lucio Fulci.  I will have to view other Westerns that he directed.  I bought ""Four of the Apocalypse"" for my dad who is a fan of the Western genre. Even though he enjoyed this movie, I'm going to have to keep it for my own Lucio Fulci collection.  I'm only joking.",1217635200,3,2116,4.665760869565218
1652630,5,B00005R24L,"This being a Lucio Fulci movie, i obviously expected to see a ton of graphic violence and i did, but he didn't offer just some cool bloody western with this film. Actually it was much more than just that. The film was brutal, it was sad, it was beautiful. It had some many excellent moments all throughout it and the score was brilliant and completely set the tone for the film. This was a very emotional picture and it seems to be a really personal from Fulci. It really had some moments that were truly heart breaking, these characters were totally likable. And to see what the characters went through, you really felt bad. I think that this film could definitely go as  far as being one of the greatest spaghetti westerns that i'd ever seen. And that comes from a great genre with a ton of great pictures under it's belt. If you're a fan of Fulci's but have not seen this you'll most likely be very pleasantly surprised as i was.

1652631,2,B00005R24L,"LAME... had to force myself to watch it!!! Even considered giving it a one star rating.

This really is a creep show in western dress.

If you enjoy watching people on peyote trips, people eating flesh, crazies that speak to the dead, women dying from child birth, the misery of severe alcohol addiction, and suffering; you might like this movie.

To top it all off it has a really cheesy soundtrack too!!!!

The story is.... well I don't think there is a story here other than to illustrate a sadistic view on death and life.

Thomas Milan plays a brief part... no doubt to use his name to sell the movie... and does his character well.",1202860800,,637,4.456896551724138
1652632,2,B00005R24L,"I bought this alongside ""Great Silence"" after viewing ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly"", my favorite again, during a resurgence of interest in Spaghetti Westerns.
""Silence"" was great (see seperate review) but this one didn't deliver on the hype that surrounded it. I applaud it for it's mostly UN-western approach being a tale of four individuals traveling from a dangerous situation in one town with literally the clothes on their back to the next and their encounters along the way.
Chief of which is Tomas Milian's Chaco playing the role of the Western equivalent of a deranged psycho hitchhiker. This is when the film is at it's best, but alas all too briefly.
After this high the movie seemed to drag for me until the no-surprise finale that could have been done better.
There was a lot of build-up to this I had either heard or read. Like most items of the type you need to see them for yourself. ""Great Silence"" measured up...""Four of the Apocalypse"" didn't.",1182038400,,965,4.715976331360947
1652633,3,B00005R24L,"This is a neat film. It's by no means as violent and portrayed. When the alleged gore is shown, notice the actor for he has been in a lot of Spaghetti Westerns which was kinda neat. Tomas Millian is great as Chaco. ""Do you see how Chaco Shoots?"", and other lines are cool. This is more of a drama if you ask me. Not a lot of action or shoot outs. But it's an entertaining fils.

1652634,4,B00005R24L,"Fulci's always gonna be remembered for his horror flicks, but his films outside the genre are worth checking out.  Usually they're just downright silly like Conquest and Contraband(though I have to admit that I found them both quite entertaining).  Fulci's stab at a western isn't all that bad.  It's not gonna rank among the best westerns of all time, but it's decent and shows that Fulci had potential in this genre.  The always reliable Fabio Testi is a snooty, selfish card shark that, through a twist of fate, hooks up with a drunk, a looney ""I see dead people"" guy and the required prostitiute with a heart of gold(pregnant of course).  Basically they're all just trying to get to a town 200 miles away, but get delayed when Tomas Milian stops them in the desert, drugs them, rapes the girl, cripples the drunk and steals their stuff.  A long trek follows, Fabio vows to kill Milian and falls in love with the chick.  Fabio spends 90% of the film without a gun, but when he gets one he kicks it into badass mode.  Milian as usual, is great(a damn shame he isn't known in America), and though you may not recognize the name, you'll recognize Michael Pollard.  This was made before Fulci discovered that sticking splinters in peoples' eyes could pack a theater, so don't go into this expecting Fulci gore.  Sure, it's bloody in some spots and was considered extreme for the day, but pretty lightweight compared to what Fulci would eventually do with his horror flicks.  A good film.  It's a little slow, but it's got decent performances, it's well shot, and Fulci even gives us a scene with a baby that manages to conjure up some emotion(!).  But I'm sure this film wouldn't fly in America.  It may be a western, but it certainly comes across as European though.  The average John Wayne fan's probably not gonna dig this much.  I'd strongly suggest it for diehard Fulci and spaghetti western fans.",1140048000,,1901,4.6467065868263475
1652660,4,B00005R24L,"Three hippies and a brother run away from a bad scene in a lawless town.  They meet Charlie Manson in the desert, who turns them onto some peyote.  The trip turns into a bummer and Charlie Manson turns cruel.

 Only the names were changed, baby. There are four refugees and one requisite Bad Guy in FOUR OF THE APOCALYPSE, a rambling yet entertaining spaghetti western from the Italian Lucio Fulci, who is best known for directing such Italian horror classics as A LIZARD IN A WOMAN'S SKIN and DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING.

 The Manson reference comes from something Tomas Milian, who plays the evil Chaco, said. (All bad guys in Italian westerns never have a last name, or much of a first name, either.)  Milian said he took a make-up cue from Charles Manson, who had notoriously carved a swastika in his forehead, and drew a blood red cross beneath each eye.  Constrained by time and driven by Method, it seemed the thing to do, and it works.

  Chaco is a brutal character, and he's involved in a couple of grisly scenes, cut from the original English release, that have been restored with subtitles on the dvd.  The scenes may have been a little much for audiences in 1975, but they're unlikely to raise many eyebrows three decades on.  A little skin flayed here, a little cannibalism there.  Been there, done that, excuse me while I stifle a yawn.

  The characters in FOTA, a gambler (Fabio Testi), a prostitute (Lynne Frederick), a town drunk (Michael J Pollard), a mentally challenged mortuary assistant (Harry Baird) and a few plot points may have been ripped from current headlines, but the movie also borrowed heavily, with attribution, from the works of Bret Harte.  Most of act three, which is by far the strongest and most coherent section of the movie, is taken directly from Harte's ""Luck of the Roaring Camp.""

  FOTA is cobbled together and not all the pieces fit.  As Milian tells us, he was available for only six days of filming, so his character sort of drifts in and out of the movie without undue rhyme or reason.

  I liked FOUR OF THE APOCALYPSE, even though I feel compelled to admit, sheepishly, that it's not a very good movie.  The plot is all over the place and the climatic revenge theme should have been torn down and rebuilt from scratch. On the other hand, the acting was a notch above that found in most spaghetti westerns and I found myself involved with and caring about the characters.  Also, from the parched deserts to the snowy mining camp, this movie looked good.  With reservations, a moderately strong recommendation.",1109030400,11,2559,4.677130044843049
1652661,5,B00005R24L,"This truly is a movie of great depth and beauty.  Gore Fans will surley tear this apart. This film possess to much class for the gore fanboy. What a shame that some Fulci fans criteria for a good movie is a high body count.  For open minded film buffs this film is a must.

We are blessed to hear a soundtrack that is very unique for a western. Some critics complain about the soundtracks music in  reviews, making it out to be quaint seventies fare. What would they prefer?  The standard spaghetti western music? Today's computer generated techno refuse?

The music works very well with this film.  It is a little like America or Pink Floyds Meddle--Obscured by Clouds period, but it has its own unique voice.

This film can stand on it's own compared to ""Once Upon A Time In the West"", ""For a Few Dollars More"".  It does not have the shear sprawling power created by Sergio Leon or groundbreaking Morricone soundtrack, but it makes up for it in its focus on friendship and heartfelt emotion. The Camera work is very impressive. Fabio Testi does a great job!  No wonder he is so big in Italy.

Too bad Fulci pandered to gore fans in his later work, but it may have been the only work he was given, futhermore, he most likely needed to eat.

The picture looks great on a Hi Def 16x9 monitor!  The use of a diffusion filter is very noticable in this film, the effect was quite common for the mid-seventies.

Give it a try!",1106092800,2,1421,4.394636015325671
1652662,4,B00005R24L,"Spaghetti westerns are, in my opinion, generally the best fictional films about the American West. You can argue that John Wayne made a bunch of great movies about life in the Old West, and you would be right to say so, but for some reason the Italians captured perfectly the specific elements of the era that made their movies seem more realistic. The frontier was a dirty, violent place full of unsavory types trying to get rich quick. Italian westerns capture this mood expertly whereas American films portray characters whose outfits look like they just came back from the dry cleaners. Hollywood films also tend to apply a black and white dichotomy onto their characters, the old ""good guys wear white, bad guys wear black"" philosophy that obscures the reality of the time and place. Not so in Italian films, where even the good guys often have distinctly unsavory traits. It's too bad spaghetti westerns went the way of the dinosaurs a few decades back; I never tire of watching these films even though I am not an expert on the genre. ""Four of the Apocalypse,"" part of the larger Anchor Bay ""Once Upon a Time in Italy"" spaghetti western box set, serves as an excellent example of how powerful the genre once was. Too, none other than goremeister Lucio Fulci directed the picture.

Fulci's contribution to the spaghetti western genre contains some of the great cult classic actors of the Italian film era. Fabio Testi, who later teamed up with Fulci again for the mobster picture ""Contraband,"" plays a renegade gambler named Stubby Preston. Testi's character looks the part; he wears the clothing of a dandy, possesses an oily smile that could melt steel, and has four or five decks of marked cards tucked away in his suitcase. Unfortunately for this poker shark, the local sheriff promptly arrests him when he steps off the coach in a small Utah town. It seems the townspeople are weary of dealing with miscreants, so they've taken the step of cleaning up the town the hard way. The process involves waiting until nightfall, donning masks, and gunning down all of the goons. One poor chap takes a header out of a window with a noose around his neck. Bodies litter the street the next morning when the sheriff orders Stubby and three of his fellow detainees to hit the bricks. The four individuals, now traveling companions, form an odd bunch. Besides Stubby, there's a pregnant harridan named Bunny (Lynne Frederick), an alcoholic called Clem (Michael Pollard!), and a scary guy answering to Bud (Harry Baird) who actually says ""I see dead people"" years before ""The Sixth Sense"" arrived on the scene. For better or for worse, these four set out across the alkali flats (or is it a desert?) of Utah in search of Sand City, a town full of the vices all four have come to love.

Problems emerge from the get go. First, the four run into a shaggy looking fellow named Chaco (Thomas Milian), a crack sharpshooter with a penchant for violent outbursts, peyote, and whisky. At first, Chaco befriends the group, but at some point he paints crosses under his eyes and turns as mean as a snake. The thug literally skins a prisoner captured in a shootout, then turns his attentions to Stubby's cohorts. He critically wounds Clem and terrorizes poor Bunny before riding off into the mountains with the group's wagon and horses, leaving the four to plod miserably through the blasted climes. It's not long after this incident that the group begins to melt away. By the time Bunny and Stubby arrive in Altaville, a small town peopled by a ragtag bunch of grizzled men, the movie oddly turns into a rather sappy series of scenes about caring for an infant. The conclusion to the film whips ""Four of the Apocalypse"" right back to where it should be with the obligatory showdown between Stubby and the evil Chaco. I've watched all but one of the films contained in the Anchor Bay boxed set at this point, and Fulci's film is the strangest of the lot.

Odd though it is, the picture is still a lot of fun to view. The performances on the whole stand well above usual Italian film standards. Milian is the one to watch, though. His villainous Chaco ranks as one of the most despicable bad guys I've seen in awhile. The humorous, languid attitude Milian's character exuded in ""Companeros"" is nowhere apparent here--this guy is just plain evil incarnate. He even overshadows the general weirdness Michael Pollard brings to the Clem character, and that's quite a feat if you're familiar with any character portrayed by Pollard during his lengthy career. Beyond the performances, ""Four of the Apocalypse"" shows us a hint of the Fulci gore that would become a staple in his later horror films. When bullets strike down guys in this film, the wounds explode like miniature atomic bombs. Then there's that skinning scene. Yep, shades of the grotesqueries of ""The Beyond,"" ""The Gates of Hell,"" and ""Zombie"" are perceptible in this ultra violent spag western. A series of great prog rock ballads serve as the musical score.

All in all, I'd say this film is one of the best I've seen from Fulci. Heck, the guy even forgoes the usual eye zoom shots so prevalent in his later work. A big round of applause should go to Anchor Bay for bringing us this flick on DVD. Even better, they added in the gory scenes cut out of prior releases, and even throw in a seventeen-minute documentary containing interviews with Fabio Testi and Thomas Milian. You also get talent biographies, a trailer, and an easter egg accessible from the extras screen. Spaghetti western fans will want to add this one to the collection. So will fans of Fulci in general.",1093564800,9,5617,4.734422880490296

1652664,4,B00005R24L,"I recently picked up Four Of The Apocalypse as part of Anchor Bay's ""Once Upon A Time In Italy"" box-set of non-Leone spaghetti westerns. After reading mixed reviews of FOTA, I delayed viewing it until after the other four movies contained. I was surprised to find that I liked it.

 My only other experience with director Leo Fulci had been ""House By The Cemetery"" which my wife and I felt had potential, but was ultimately pretty dreadfully bad. With that in mind, I didn't expect to be impressed with FOTA and was worried that some of the gore I'd been reading about would ruin it for me. Although I'll have to admit that some scenes we're pretty hard to watch, overall the film had a classic spaghetti atmosphere with some fairly macabre moments, and was a step above many I have viewed.

 Many people have complained about the score which includes narrative songs with a kind of folksy early period Pink Floyd/Byrds sound which I personally love. In comparison with the more respected film Keoma, which is also included in the OUATI collection, the soundtrack is pure gold! The caterwauling that passed for a score in Keoma virtually made it unwatchable for me.

 If you like the genre, and aren't turned off by some of FOTA's non-traditional western elements, you should enjoy it. Recommended.",1091750400,3,1298,4.772321428571429
1652665,3,B00005R24L,"This isn't your typical spaghetti western - you know the sort - lot's of glowering faces, silly dialogue and violent action that crops up every five minutes or so. This operates on a slower, more pretentious level. The dialogue is still silly, the glowering faces are still there, but instead of numerous action  sequences, Fulci gives us a slow, pretentious - almost dreamlike - affair. It's supposed to be one of his personal favourites, and it does have that air of ""the director doing his thing"" about it. Lots of ""meaningful"" but somehow unrelated sequences strung together to give an incoherant whole. The violence, when it comes, is pretty strong stuff: there's an opening massacre that has no bearing on the plot whatsoever, a scene where a sherrif gets skinned alive (while the heroes stand by doing nothing, for some strange reason), a rape, cannabalism and torture. But it's not the stuff of westerns - it belongs more in the realm of horror films or thrillers (in fact, compare this film with Fulci's earlier western, Massacre Time, and you can see that Apocalypse is really a precursor to his ultra-bloody and silly horror flicks of the 80s, where long bouts of inactivity and inane dialogue are punctuated by extreme gore).  Apparently, in order to woo audiences back to a dying genre, the spaghetti westerns became increasingly explicit in their depiction of violence (it didn't work - this was one of the last westerns made). For a better example, check out Majanna. So why 3 stars? Well, it is a strangely haunting film. Maybe it;'s the cinemaphotography, or Tomas Milian's over-the-top performance as Chaco (the DVD features a great interview with him and Fabio Testi), or even the out-of-place 70s style soundtrack. Or maybe it's a combination of all the above (and the gore, of course). But be warned. If you like your spaghettis fast and furious, stay away.",1052006400,,1878,4.90251572327044

1652667,2,B00005R24L,"FOUR OF THE APOCALYPSE, a movie directed by Lucio Fulci in 1975, has been released by Anchor Bay in its superb Spaghetti Western collection. Lucio Fulci is best known for his horror movies directed in the 70's and in the beginning of the 80's, movies that are appreciated by a certain number of aficionados.
If I'm very fond of the movies of Mario Bava and Dario Argento, I've always been reluctant in front of Fulci's filmography. In my opinion, this director has crossed the frontier between the horror movie and the pure filming of disgusting images that can only please special effects fans or would-be butchers and surgeons.
When these horror elements are found in a western, their gratuitousness is patent, these scenes don't bring anything to the action and are simply disgusting. Why do Tomas Milian suddenly feel the urge to skin alive the sheriff who was chasing him ? For no good reason at all except for the pleasure of the director and of a few fans.
Furthermore, FOUR OF THE APOCALYPSE is a subpar western with a lot of ridiculous scenes such as the delivery of Bonny in a small town lost in the Utah mountains and the encounter of a group of fundamentalists in the middle of the desert. The characters are shallow and even the last shootout is failed.

1652668,3,B00005R24L,"This is a strange film. It's a dreamy, hypnotic Western, and Fulci was evidently developing the weird dream aesthetics that permeated THE BEYOND and HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY. There are some brilliant sequences: the opening massacre; Chaco's torturing of a lawman; the travelling through the desert sequences, and others are a marvel. But the film can't sustain this. Sentimentality ruins the film. There are too many extended death bed scenes and too much gushing warmth. The sequences of dread are far more convincing. The film takes a massive detour into sentimentality and takes ages to get back. But the final showdown between Stubby and Chaco is brilliant: the penultimate image of Stubby's shattered narcissism is unforgettable.
The dvd is fine. Picture is excellent, and an interesting interview with the film's stars: the brilliant actors Tomas Milian and Fabio Testi.
Overall, an interesting film, one that I wish was the masterpiece that it could have been. You'll like it, but you'll wish you could like it better.",1032220800,,1022,5.162650602409639

7951598,3,B00005R24L,"Review:  FOUR OF THE APOCALYPSE (1975, Dir.  Lucio Fulci)

A weird, ambitious western opus from Lucio Fulci, a veteran of the horror genre best known to western fans as the director of Franco Nero's MASSACRE TIME. (His signature horror pic is probably 1979's ZOMBIE.) Fulci here delivers an episodic, dreamy, somewhat languorous picture, marked by bursts of emotion and drama.

We find gambler Stubby (Fabio Testi) tossed in a jail cell with a hopeless drunk; a loopy, hallucination-prone black man; and a winsome prostitute. During a raid on the town, the four prisoners are set free to escape, and wander the desert to ponder their next move.

(Spoilers follow:) In a series of vignettes, the group discovers the prostitute's pregnancy, meets up with a pack of religious settlers, is set upon by cruel bandit Tomas Milian, holes up in an abandoned town during a rainstorm, aid in the delivery of the baby, and eventually have a showdown with Milian.  This might seem like a pretty straightforward checklist of events, but the presentation and mood of the picture make it all feel like a fevered, surreal dream.

The cast features some familiar faces in fine performances: Testi (A/K/A Stet Carson) is handsome and charismatic. We expect Stubby to be a cocky wisecracker, he turns out to be pensive and brooding: Testi's wide-eyed good looks are perfect for the character. Michael Pollard (of BONNIE AND CLYDE) is appropriately pathetic as the town drunk; Harry Baird, who I know from TRINITY AND SARTANA, THOSE SONS OF... does a great job of being earnest and bright-eyed at the start and escalating into full-on freak-out. As the mysterious and evil bandit Chaco, Tomas Milian is mesmerizing as always, and brings a rock-star swagger to the part of a merciless thug.

The direction by Fulci is such that scenes shift from one setting to the next rather jarringly; we may go from a dusty, sun-drenched vista to a fog-heavy valley just like that. It helps to paint the story as a weird, disorienting dream. You can almost imagine that the four leads are being depicted making their way through the afterlife, or purgatory, or judgment of some kind. Not a straightforward narrative, but really engrossing.

There is not much action or western-style stunt-work in the picture; however, several scenes of violence are conveyed with the aid of very gory, bloody makeup effects, which are shocking but effective. The unusual song score also aids in the film's impact. Several soft-rock-style narrative songs, whose lyrics mimic the action onscreen, are initially unexpected and off-putting but seem to fit well the more you hear them. The songs are done in English by what sounds like a typical mid-70s acoustic rock ensemble, led by composers Vince Tempera and Massimo DeLuca.

I would suggest this to Fulci fans first and foremost. But definitely not for newcomers to the Spaghetti West, you folks should see MASSACRE TIME by Fulci instead. Also, if you are a fan of dream-like, trippy western epics like KEOMA or of David Lynch-style weirdness, you might want to take a look.

B-/C+, 6.5 out of 10 stars.",1303776000,,3103,4.959537572254336
