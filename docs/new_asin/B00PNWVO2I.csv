8688927,2,B00PNWVO2I,"The movie itself is quite uncomfortable to watch, as it would be IMPOSSIBLE today to get it done. But daring and perverse indeed. It's a re-imagination of THE BAD SEED, and anticipating THE GOOD SON in twenty years. Many twists and turns, and a really surprising one (really unexpected!) at the very end. And it is the Uncut version.
As for the VCI Blu ray, it's probable one of the worst i've seen in ages. I didn't see any artefact of scratches, but... it is a Disastrous transfer. sometimes blurry, can't see much of the details, the colors are sometimes over-saturated. It's a chance I payed a cheap price. only Under 7 $, it's  worth the buy.",1516838400,,647,4.52991452991453
8688928,1,B00PNWVO2I,"This blu-ray would look good if it were high definition - - but it isn't.  Picture quality is substandard DVD.
The 2nd lie: It is not 'Uncut.'  It's the cut version.  I have a pirate copy of the movie which accords with the version I remember when the film was first released in UK as NIGHT HAIR CHILD, and the pirate version IS uncut.  This blu-ray is cut.
So VCI Entertainment has no scruples about lying and treating customers like chumps who deserve to be conned - - worth knowing when you decide whether to buy other VCI products.  Some conned customers have even written reviews conning themselves.
So just to straighten it all out: The VCI 'Uncut' blu-ray is not high definition and it's cut.",1516060800,2,699,4.515873015873016
8688929,4,B00PNWVO2I,"The British are no strangers to the suspense film, mainly through the work of Alfred Hitchcock and of Hammer Films.  Set in Spain, ""What The Peeper Saw"" (aka ""Night Child"") is an early 70s offering of creepy, insolent kid (Mark Lester of ""Oliver"" and ""Melody""), mysterious murders, a seemingly clueless father and seemingly naive stepmum. In the surprise whodunnit ending, we wonder who was telling the truth and who was the crazy one.

The Blu-Ray is as good as it gets, given that the source material is more than 45 years old and certain excised scenes are restored (albeit a little sloppily). The film does not seem to have been digitally restored, but it's in otherwise good shape, without any remarkable special features. In the US, this would probably carry an 'PG-13' rating today -- not for violence or profanity, but for a controversial sexual fantasy scene and discussion of animal abuse.",1511222400,,899,4.907894736842105
8688930,2,B00PNWVO2I,"Uneven and very slow thriller about a young woman (Britt Ekland) who marries an older author (Hardy Kruger) and finds out that her 12-year-old stepson is not only a liar and a pervert but also possibly that he murdered his own mother.  Unfortunately, she can't seem to convince the boy's father that there is anything seriously wrong with the kid and eventually she starts fearing for her own life.

I'm generally a fan of evil kid films and child actor Mark Lester is very effective as the cold and potentially psychopathic boy.  What the Peeper Saw has a couple of creepy scenes but never generates much tension otherwise and, like other British thrillers from the period, feels way too tame to fully take advantage of its lurid premise.  The writing also seems highly illogical at times.  After the boy confesses to murdering his own mother Britt Ekland's character keeps the confession to herself rather than tell her husband.  Then there's a late scene between Ekland's character and a psychiatrist played by Lilli Palmer, who is apparently so incompetent she doesn't realize that torturing and killing a cat is actually a pretty strong indication of mental illness by the boy.  Instead, the entire scene is played as if the psychiatrist thinks the stepmother is the one who is crazy, which is simply too ridiculous to be plausible.

What the Peeper Saw is a pretty boring movie, basically little more than The Bad Seed with a little sexual perversity thrown in to spice things up.  Britt Ekland is very pretty and Mark Lester very creepy, but that simply isn't enough to save the film.",1496448000,,1591,4.819852941176471

8688932,5,B00PNWVO2I,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Im surprised at the number of vintage horror/thriller films Ive run across lately that Ive never heard of before.  Case in point is this classic gem, WHAT THE PEEPER SAW.  While more of a thriller than an actual horror film, this one still certainly merits watching.  It is well made and has an amazingly satisfying ending that I never saw coming.  Intriguing and intense, WHAT THE PEEPER SAW is an excellent entertainment experience I highly recommend.

I really had no expectations going into this one.  I was hoping it would be good, but Ive been disappointed in the past with foreign thrillers.  Thankfully, this film turned out to be great.

WHAT THE PEEPER SAW is shot well and looks good onscreen.  The cinematography is not exotic or artistic, but it doesnt need to be to tell the story.  The picture quality is excellent, with the HD transfer offering vibrant colors and clear imagery.  As I never saw the VHS or previous DVD quality, I cannot compare it; however, the Blu-ray is the way to watch this one.

The acting is very good, with Mark Lester offering a powerful performance as Marcus.  Lester plays the diabolical youth like a pro, and his chilling persona lingers in the memory long after the movie is over.  Likewise, Britt Ekland does an excellent job as Marcus stepmother, Elise.  The onscreen chemistry between these two is very interesting, and they play off each other well.

The storyline in WHAT THE PEEPER SAW is a big part of what makes this film so engaging.  What starts off as a seemingly innocent situation quickly spirals into madness.  And the grand finale is unexpected yet fun, so when it arrives, the viewer doesnt know whether to gasp in surprise or clap for joy.

WHAT THE PEEPER SAW is a big win for me, and I suggest it to anyone looking for a good, solid thriller.  The film was a bit controversial for its time due to some of the subject matter, so be forewarned:  it won't be for everyone.  Check out IMDB for the scoop on the films content.  If that doesnt concern you, then pick up this one for sure.",1472688000,6,2119,4.559681697612732
