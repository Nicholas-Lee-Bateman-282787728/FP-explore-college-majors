It takes the audience on an emotional rollercoaster as it shows each character's perspective (without taking sides) and offers a valuable moral lesson in the end to its viewers.  If you liked the movie ""Brothers"" I think you'll enjoy this film also.",1117065600,29,384,4.892307692307693

8042830,5,B0006SSPHG,"This movie was very funny. Although it had some drama. Sean Blakemore was great. He shows his many talents by switching up between roles. Remember him in T.D. Jakes, ""Woman, Thou Art Loosed"" and ""Motives I and II"" with Vivica Fox?  A good actor can skillfully play many different characters. I would've never thought he'd have a comical side to him because he's usually the bad guy, with exception to his role with Robin Givens in, ""Restraining Order,"" which where he was awesome.

I'd suggest to anyone to buy this film. I bought it on Amazon and I put it in every now and again for a good laugh and love story. It's just enjoyable.

Hope to see him in more films. He has talen Hollywood and Independents had better recognize.",1262044800,,727,4.534351145038168
8042831,1,B0006SSPHG,"Well, where should I start. The movie was just horrible, everything from a bad script to bad acting. The sound and clarity of this dvd was terrible. Very upset I wasted my money on this garbage. The movie seemed extra long just because it was so boring. Whatever you do don't make the same mistake I did...STAY AWAY from this Movie!!!!",1239580800,,335,4.508196721311475
8042832,4,B0006SSPHG,"The Denver character carried this movie.., This crazy chic could have finessed a entire story around her.., The script was pretty good, but some of the cast came up lame or the golf buddy lines need a little more snap.. The Atlanta scenery was great, I like the record co. & car wash business story lines and the Dino & friends story line also...  Nice movie !",1229126400,,360,4.373134328358209
8042833,4,B0006SSPHG,I found this movie while adding to my Netflix list and I'm glad I picked it. Sean Blakemore was great as always. I love how the it showed Ric dealing with the repercussions of his infidelity because it gave the character depth and layers. Montana Taylor gave me some laugh out loud moments and I wish she was utilized more in the film. I like Tico Wells but I don't think his character was really needed. Overall I'd definitely recommend this one. It's one of those small budget films with more heart than many of the mega-budgets ones coming out of Hollywood.,1205712000,,560,4.5
8042834,3,B0006SSPHG,The movie could not have been that good because I don't even remember it.,1169078400,,73,4.285714285714286
8042835,1,B0006SSPHG,This movie was terrible from a bad script to bad acting. The only bright light was Tico Wells. i am glad that I rented this movie instead of buying it.,1168214400,,151,4.066666666666666
