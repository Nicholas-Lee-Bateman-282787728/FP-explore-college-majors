8592953,5,B00DGETIIM,"Its the other side of camp ""beyond bad and a rare chance to see these great legendary stars work together. Boom! is a 1968 British drama film starring Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton and Nol Coward, directed by Joseph Losey, and adapted from the play The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore by Tennessee Williams. Flora 'Sissy' Goforth (Taylor, in a part written for an older woman) is a terminally ill woman living with a coterie of servants in a large mansion on a secluded island. Into her life comes a mysterious man, Christopher Flanders, nicknamed ""Angelo Del Morte"" (played by then-husband Burton, in a part intended for a very young man). The mysterious man may or may not be ""The Angel of Death"". John Waters admires the film, and chose it as a favorite to present in the first Maryland Film Festival in 1999.",1422662400,,820,4.701388888888889
8592954,4,B00DGETIIM,"Film director John Waters called ""Boom!"" ""the best failed art film ever, so genuinely beautiful and awful that it is perfect"".  Directed by Joseph Losey and starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, this high-budget 1968 film flopped both at the box office and with critics. The film remains obscure and is not available on an American DVD. Fortunately, its obscurity allows it to be accessible online.  I sought out the film after reading Tennessee Williams' play, ""The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore"" on which the film is based. Williams' play flopped twice on Broadway in 1963 and 1964 before its even worse initial failure in this film. Williams wrote the screenplay for the film which itself adds interest to the work. In 2011, ""Milk Train"" was revived off-Broadway in a production starring Olympia Dukakis and has sometimes been performed thereafter. John Waters used the film in 1998 to open his annual Maryland Film Festival.

The film's primary character is a wealthy eccentric, aging American widow, Flora (Sissy) Goforth who lives on an island she owns off the coast of Italy. Goforth refuses to acknowledge that she is about to die. She is engaged in writing her memoirs by dictating to a secretary and she keeps a strange staff who are terrified of her and refer to her as the ""monster"". Christopher Flanders, a young man and a failed poet, finds his way onto the island.  Flanders is called the ""angel of death"" because of his habit of befriending wealthy sexually frustrated women in their dying days.  The film develops the relationship between Goforth and Flanders in the two days before her death. Goforth is alternately flamboyant, terrifying and vulnerable as she dresses in a kabuki and wears garish expensive jewelry. She dresses Flanders as a Japanese samurai, replete with sword, but refuses even to feed him. The two engage in long discussions about life, religion and love in the hours before Goforth's death. The unfortunate title ""Boom!"" is a term Flanders uses in the play when he hears the waves beating against the rocks. It refers, according to Williams, to ""the sound of shock felt by people each moment of still being alive.""

The film and its dialogue are have long empty stretches and the acting is mixed. Taylor is beautiful, but she is younger than Williams' Goforth while Burton is older than Williams' Flanders.  With the costuming, the two primary characters, and the supporting characters, the play is over the top. Mrs Goforth is the critical actor and she dominates nearly every scene. The best acting performance in the film is that of Noel Coward, who plays the part of the ""Witch of Capri"", a cynical and eccentric friend of Mrs Goforth. The mansion in which the play takes place, the rocks and the crashing waves contribute to the atmosphere as does John Barry's musical score.

Williams considered the film ""much better written than the play"". With its weaknesses and extremes, this movie deserves a better fate. It tells the story of a frightful old woman who is afraid to die and in the process shows the viewer something of the joy of life. Both the film and the play cling tenuously to a place in the work of Tennessee Williams. This film will appeal to admirers of Tennessee Williams and to viewers who are willing to experience the bad and the good in an attempted serious film.

8592955,5,B00DGETIIM,Everyone should see this at least once. I think the casting was poor but only due to actor's ages. Campy classic...another I watch a lot.,1415577600,,137,4.52
8592956,5,B00DGETIIM,"When this movie first came out, I went on opening day and sat, stunned and overwhelmed, through four consecutive showings.  I didn't know the words ""decadence"" or ""camp"" back then, so this was a great introduction.  I once had a VHS copy that seemed like a fourth-generation copy bootlegged from a censored TV showing.  I'm glad I finally got a dvd version.  Do not be afraid of the Portuguese cover.  The soundtrack is in English, and you can turn off the Portuguese subtitles.  What bothers me is the extreme letterbox look.  My eyes never got used to the ultra-wide aspect ratio that seemed more appropriate to ""Lawrence of Arabia.""

The movie can be viewed as total camp, Tennessee Williams at his most florid.  John Waters has said it is his favorite film, so that should be enough to convince people who want something outlandishly memorable.  Taylor is much too young for her role, and Burton much too old for his.  The costumes are fabulous.  The setting is breathtaking.  Taylor overacts like crazy, and I have to wonder if this is not one of the films that influenced Divine's acting style---Wear outlandish fashions and shout your lines while staggering around.  The appearance of Noel Coward as The Witch of Capri is one of the most bizarre aspects of this cult film.

A revival of ""Milk Train"" starring Tallulah Bankhead and Tab Hunter entered the Hall of Fame of famous camp performances, and this film version of the play deserves to be there as well.",1408320000,3,1466,4.739130434782608
8592957,5,B00DGETIIM,"I loved this when I saw it long ago. This dvd is in English. The sound is Dolby digital mono and very good. The picture looks great, best I have seen it. And, there is more here than I have seen. My estimate is about 20 minutes must have been cut from what I saw before. The story is more meaningful and there is more beauty. When I am really enjoying a vacation near water... I think of this. It's a great one to have in the archives of your brain. I would love it on Blu-ray... but this is a great gift as is. Note: It's hard to pitch the movie. I think that a young person would never get it. I was young when I saw it first... but I'm not sure I got it. It's a reminder that Tennessee Williams should be experienced as much as possible. Burton and Taylor... how lucky we are. Noel Coward... you can be sure that this made me follow everything he left behind. Don't miss this.",1388793600,4,879,4.0285714285714285
8592958,5,B00DGETIIM,"Long-dismissed as overwrought trash, this is actually one of Joseph Losey's lost masterpieces. Adapted from The Milk Train Don't
Run Here Anymore--by the playwright himself--Boom marks one of the great playwright's last major film adaptations. With the art direction and locations enough to justify the Spanish copy's extra price, I found this to be deeply moving and surprisingly powerful.
Of course, I love Losey. And Tennessee Williams. Having Burton and Taylor chew the scenery is just a bonus!",1387756800,4,498,5.397435897435898
