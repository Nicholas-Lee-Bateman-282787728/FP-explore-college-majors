8078316,3,B00004CIUJ,"Wow, what a hot mess!

Pros: Gratuitous nudity! It is like one of the producers told an editor to let him know if the film went over 3 minutes without a nude female breast somewhere in the shot. Loads and loads of violence.

Cons: Flimsy story. Barely likable characters. Clunky story pacing. Very little fake blood/gore. Rape.

Wow, I am truly mystified to see this film pre-dates 'The Running Man'.

My personal recommendation if you attempt this one is to have a group of friends with you and have fun making fun as it plays along.",1517443200,,534,4.53125
8078317,5,B00004CIUJ,"After an apocalyptic, nuclear holocaust opening, ENDGAME (1983) begins. We are shown a hellish world where cannibals dine on the fallen, storm-troopers patrol the streets, and the game show of the title is underway. Ron Shannon (Al Cliver- ZOMBIE, THE BEYOND) is a contestant / prey, up against a group of sadistic hunters, led by the notorious Kurt Karnak (George Eastman- ANTHROPOPHAGOUS, STAGEFRIGHT). Apparently, all of the contestants must wear ridiculous, KISS-like face paint (??) as part of the contest. There's also a hilarious emcee, and his roving TV crew, always looking to show the violence and promote products! Shannon runs into Lilith (Laura Gemser- CAGED WOMEN, WOMEN'S PRISON MASSACRE), a mutant w/ telepathic powers. She's willing to assist Shannon to win, if he agrees to guide her people to a safe destination. Shannon assembles a team of fighters to accompany him on the journey. It's funny how, in the far-flung future, everyone drives armor-ized vehicles from the 1970's, and dresses either in biker gear, or Renaissance festival costumes. ENDGAME is another Italian ""kitchen sink"" production, including elements from other films like ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, BLADE RUNNER, THE ROAD WARRIOR, etc. (for example, the caravan of mutants and their protectors are straight out of the George Miller playbook). It's all blended together and used to cheeeze-tabulous effect here, making for one of the better of these silly conglomerations! Whether battling an army of blind, machine gun-toting monks, or sparring w/ a ludicrous lizard-man and his effete dirt bike patrol, Shannon and company party like it's 2199! A final encounter w/ government thugs, leads to a monumental bit of hyper-schlock cinema, complete w/ telekinesis, explosions, and slaughter! Let nothing keep you from witnessing this miraculous mess!...",1508803200,2,1831,5.405594405594406

This movie was made with the same rationale and in the same spirit as spaghetti westerns, which fared a whole lot better, but riding on the success of Mad Max and Escape from New York. You have to LOVE a movie which manages to throw in every conceivable creature in a single feature, -for the sake of maximizing whatever little resources available and also save the audience time and money watching them in separate entries-, even ninjas, ex-soft core stars, fishmen, apemen, telepaths, killer blind monks, werewolves, etc... and manages to anticipate the idea behind such movies as The Running Man, while attempting to be something else. This is a movie in its very own league, not to be judged by any other standards; actually Joe D'Amato's favorite among all the colorful entries in his immense catalogue. I reckon from seeing Death Smiles on a Murderer, that David Lynch's place in film history should have been occupied by him instead, but there was just no market for such a thing in the Italian industry back then. So, he went, ""if they want rubbish,  I have no problem delivering just that.."" and the rest is history.  Made in the truest Ed Wood spirit, taking into consideration the man was ""ahead of his time;"" certainly, their kingdom was not of this world... It's a rare privilege that this movie is available in the first place!",1497139200,2,1442,4.764
8078319,2,B00004CIUJ,"Poorly written. Poorly executed, Poorly directed.  Just a sad effort at making a movie.  They really were a bunch of amateurs.  I would say that if you have nothing else you can do then this is the movie for you.",1486080000,,212,4.25
8078320,3,B00004CIUJ,"1983's ""Endgame"" was yet another dubbed futuristic picture released by Italy's noted film studio Filmirage Cinematografica, who pumped out many a similar effort during the early '80s, all capitalizing on the success of 1981's killer combo of ""Escape from New York"" and ""Mad Max 2.""  It was also yet another credit for legendary low budget Italian director (the late, great) Joe D'Amato, who is best known for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ator-The-Fighting-Eagle/dp/B007HMCQ6A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ator The Fighting Eagle</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2020-Texas-Gladiators/dp/B000MGHAN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2020 Texas Gladiators</a>.

In 2025, a nuclear war has devastated the planet and what's left of New York is a radiation-contaminated series of crumbling underground sewers and tunnels.  It is also home to a nationally televised death-sport called ""Endgame,"" in which ""hunters"" stalk their contestants in a fight to the death.  All of this is overseen by the oppressive federal government, whose strong arm consists of guys in black trenchcoats and gas masks armed with machine guns, ready to use any means necessary to maintain control over detractors and a population of radioactive mutant rebels.  Al Cliver (of 1984's aforementioned ""2020 Texas Gladiators"") is a star contestant (i.e., the film's good guy) on the show who is enlisted to help a decent brood of the exposed mutants to escape the city's barriers and into the promised land.

I want to start out by saying that I'm not the first to acknowledge that the storyline of 1987's Schwarzenegger vehicle ""the Running Man"" seemed to be lifted whole from this earlier Italian entry, as this key plot element was expanded into a feature-length film.

Now, is it as good as ""the Running Man""?  Inconclusive.  I'm actually going to compare it to its own crop of early '80s Italian futuristic film brethren, all of which I am a die-hard fan of.  There is a lot of good action here.  The machine gun duels and hand to hand combat sequences are well-staged.  In addition there are such highlights as a sewer rat feeding on a rotted corpse and a bare-breasted half dead woman wielding an assault rifle.

Those bits are entertaining, and Al Cliver turns in as charasmatic a performance as he did in ""2020 Texas Gladiators,"" but there are also a fair share of slow, dull stretches during the 96 minute runtime, and it lacks a really strong (and hot) female lead like ""Gladiators"" had in the awesome Sabrina Siani.  So overall this is not one of my favorite of the '82-'84 Italian post-apocalytic trash flicks.

Still, I'd love to see a real DVD release of this (along with ""Gladiators"").  D'Amato movies have not seen good treatment on DVD (""Ator"" notwithstanding) and his dedicated fans across the world deserve better than mere washed-out VHS transfers.

All in all, I'd say fellow connoisseurs of early '80s Italian cinema should be satisfied, but don't go expecting a grand production on the level of ""the Running Man.""  Still, an early example of how influential D'Amato and other Italian film makers of his time were to later and more big budget Hollywood movies.",1355011200,6,3241,5.4351297405189625
