I put it in the player. I have no idea to whom should I complain.  I met
personnally Elmyr de Hory , so I was interested to see it.  Teresa Hoagland

8083233,4,B000B86MZ8,"I had read FAKE by Clifford Irving and THE FORGER'S APPRENTICE, both books about Elmyr de Hory.  I found the video interesting, but wished it contained more footage of Elmyr.",1367366400,,174,4.8

8083235,3,B000B86MZ8,This movie is a good beginner on Elmyr De Hory.  Unfortunately much of the information is now more or less widely known.  It does include interviews with Elmyr's former boyfriend and Clifford Irving (the author of FAKE! (the biography of Elmyr De Hory) who himself was accused of forging Howard Hughes autobiography).  The documentary could have explored much more in depth by tracing paintings and studios.  Inevitably there is a paper trail.  We just didn't get to follow it for this documentary. At 52 minutes it comes in a little light on material but it's still interesting.  Recommended for those who know nothing about Elmyr De Hory but not for those that are informed about him.,1308268800,,686,4.870689655172414
