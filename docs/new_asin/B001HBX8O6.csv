8308585,5,B001HBX8O6,Walter Felsenstein is one of the great stage directors. We are lucky that his productions were made into DVDs.  Stage directors can learn a lot from his productions. T.K.OHSKA,1468108800,,175,5.0344827586206895
8308586,2,B001HBX8O6,"When this set first came out, it was priced way out of reach at about $350-$400.  While I wanted to get it, that was a lot more than I wanted to pay and there were only a couple of the movies that I even had an interest in seeing.  I was please when they started to release the movies individually.  I immediately purchase Ritter Blaubart.  If you're looking for Tales of Hoffman, its actually under it's German title of Hoffmans Erzahlungen.",1274054400,,442,4.419753086419753
8308587,5,B001HBX8O6,"Walter Felsenstein (1901-1975) was the founder and, for years, director of the Komische Oper Berlin, one of the premiere ensembles of the former East Berlin. In his long career he was responsible for almost 200 opera productions and also left a legacy of seven opera films, which are now available on DVD in a single set. The set includes (1) Beethoven: Fidelio (1956); (2) Janacek: The Cunning Little Vixen (1965); (3) Mozart: Don Giovanni (1966); (4) Verdi: Otello (1969); (5) Offenbach: Les contes d'Hoffmann (The Tales of Hoffmann) (1970); (6) Offenbach: Barbe-bleu (Bluebeard) (1973); and (7) Mozart: Le Nozze di Figaro (The Marriage of Figaro) (1975-76).

In presenting these seven films in this convenient set, the Felsenstein Archive also makes available background material and some historic footage. The second disc of Othello includes a presentation of Felsenstein's working notes, as well as an interview with the director. With Ritter Blaubart, the materials move logically from text to graphics and, eventually, to footages of a rehearsal of the staged version of that work. Materials like these are found throughout the set, and also include some historic films from Pariser-Leben (1945); Die Fledermaus (1947); Die Kluge (1948); Orpheus in der Unterwelt (1948); and Carmen (1949). Such materials augment the solid information found in the detailed booklets that are included with each film.

This set not only preserves the groundbreaking work of Walter Felsenstein in filming opera, but also makes it available dynamically through the medium of DVD. The restoration involved with the creation of this set, an element documented in the accompanying materials, contributes to the overall effect.

With the availability of this set, those interested in opera film have a resource that is essential to understand the technical and artistic accomplishments of one of its more creative artists. Arthaus has done a fine service to opera by making these films available a such of such fine quality and thoughtful presentation.",1247875200,9,2035,5.3730407523510975
