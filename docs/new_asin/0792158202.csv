Is at the time I think it was the biggest  box offcie movie at the time.  And I think it's good.  But also a little over rated.",1514764800,,445,4.317073170731708

126511,5,0792158202,"Great movie. One of the best ever. Still one of the best ever.

In the story, Indy has to let go of his ego and close his eyes. The colors red, black and white are often associated with one another in movies from George Lucas. Here, the colors are associated with the Nazi flag. In AMERICAN GRAFFITI it's the police car. And, of course, in STAR WARS it's the black and white of the Storm Trooper uniforms paired with the praetorian guard of the Emperor in RETURN OF THE JEDI. See the work of anthropologist Victor W. Turner on these colors in primitive cultures and his work on twins. Or, you can insult my dissertation at Northwestern University.

Maybe they are into history pieces or artistic documentaries, but those are not popcorn films. This is. The series has its peaks (this film and the Last Crusade) and its valleys (Crystal Skull) but overall an enjoyable romp that sparks adventure in anyone if you let it.

This review will be short only because their is nothing more to say. Check out the film and see a tale of exploration. Of good vs evil ,and when your done just try not to get the impulse to go adventuring.....glory and treasure Dr. Jones....glory and treasure",1512518400,,660,4.689655172413793

126630,5,0792158202,"This is the first in a series of fun to watch action packed movies based on what an archeologist should be. Being a first you will not notice the pattern of the film unless you are used to Saturday matinees.

We hit the deck running on this one as we see Indiana Jones making a John Wayne type of entrance. So much that you do not notice the dubious looking character next to him Statipo (Alfred Molina). Until he says ""Give me the Idle and I will give you the whip.""

Now settled down, after his near miss with the natives, Harrison Ford is a professor (Indiana Jones) teaching the fact that archeology is a search for facts not some thrill ride.

That very afternoon he is confronted by some government agents. It seems that his old professor Abner Ravenwood has disappeared. They picked up some radio transmissions that contained the name of Abner and a city Tannis. Immediately Indiana Jones knows that the Nazis (natural bad buys) are looking for the Ark of the Covenant (which can be used as a weapon of unspeakable power) and somehow he must bet them to it for the sake of the world.

He is helped by an old love interest Marion (Karen Allen) and rivaled by an old nemesis Dr. Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman).

Does it really exist?

How can he beat them to it?

Why is he on the outs with Abner?

126637,5,0792158202,"My all-time favorite film, and one that I can make a case for as one of the most perfect films ever made.  Great story, excellent cast, outstanding action, excitement, and a little romance in there to give the girlfriend something to look at, apart from a younger Harrison Ford, Raiders of the Lost Ark has pretty much something for almost everyone in it.  There's no bad scenes in this film; everything services both the characters and the plot well enough to do what the story needs.  What I especially love in this film, oddly, are the baddies, particularly Rene' Belloq, who's not an idiot.  Indeed, he keeps Indy frustrated throughout, and even defeats him, in a sense, at the end, and good stories have very good villains.  One common complaint I'll hear is that the way the story unfolds toward the end, Indy could've just as well have done nothing and the situation would've sorted itself out, through the Hand of God.  I think this misses the point the film is making, and there is something deep in it all, that perhaps things happen, or don't happen, for a reason larger than ourselves.  If you haven't seen this film yet, do yourself a favor, watch it.  It's standard viewing for any male over the age of 9.",1505088000,4,1219,4.585253456221198

126833,4,0792158202,"As far as steelbook releases go this blu ray of what I believe to be the best of all the Indiana Jones movies ranks among the best ever produced.  The raised detail on the front cover is very nice; unfortunately for me the packaging wasn't sufficiently sturdy to protect my copy mine has a big dent on the front that I can't remove.  Otherwise this simple release with hardly any special features suits my needs to some extent as I only really wanted a superior quality release to replace my standard dvd copy.  Unfortunately while the sound quality in DTS HD-MA clearly is a vast improvement over my dvd the picture quality is a mixed bag.  For some reason the skies over Egypt are very grey here when compared with my dvd where it's very blue.  There is however a major imperfection on the standard dvd in one scene with Belloche in the desert with a big black mark in the sky.  This is vastly reduced but still a little present in the blu ray version; the price to pay though is a much less blue sky.  Overall though the picture quality is an improvement over upscaled standard dvd.

If you can get an intact version of this steelbook release and you are not bothered about special features and the strange colour tint in the picture than this is for you.",1492473600,3,1258,4.415584415584416

This movie is an example of the principle in filmmaking called I am not able to suspend my disbelief. Watching this movie is like a police officer or a lawyer watching Law & Order. I wish that we could have seen more of Baloch in other installments. The movie has good action scenes. Would I like to pick this movie apart and look at the flaws in detail? Yes I would. Would I love to do an analysis of the movie? Yes I would. Would I like to talk about the history of the Ark of The Covenant and explain details relating to it.,1488585600,,628,4.1138211382113825

Now that I've learned to look for them, his touches are all over it, lifting it out of a Lucas-style B movie to something much better than that. It's too self-conscious about evoking the classics to be a true classic itself, and it's hardly the best film Spielberg has ever made, but it's good entertainment that has aged well.",1486944000,,496,4.584269662921348

127233,5,0792158202,"I saw this movie in the theatre when it was released and was blown away by the characters and the film art of Spielberg. ET is widely credited as Spielberg's finest but I believe that Raiders is clearly his best. The movie is exceptionally well written and produced. Casting was brilliant and the editing and production all very well executed.

Raiders is filled with action, relentless action. It is both at times violent and graphic without being either gratuitous or gory. It has a female lead love interest that while mildly romantic is never sexist or exploitive outside of the development of the story. The script contains no profanity. The lost Ark of the covenant containing the stone tablets given to Moses by the Hebrew God which he then brought down . . .  the ark is an artifact, a relic. Jones is an archeologist and his interest is purely academic.

The Ark is an object of great power, the bible speaks of it leveling mountains. An army that carries the Ark before it is invincible. Don't open your eyes Marian, don't look at it.

When the Ark is recovered and safely in the hands of the United States Government it will be kept in a safe location. What safe location asks Jones? A safe location where it's secrets will be studied by top people. What top people asks Jones? Top People.  In the end the ark is again lost forever.

While I have seen it a hundred times, I watched it again the other evening having not seen it in years and found it to be just as entertaining and just as remarkable in the way it was produced. It is in my opinion the best action adventure film of all time - and one that you can take the kids to see.",1486598400,8,1646,4.3980263157894735

128548,4,0792158202,"There are timeless classics, such as Casablanca, but this is a distinctively American classic. Yes, Harrison Ford can't act. Neither could Gary Cooper but we simply don't care. Yes, the script is far from immortal but the story is so joyously plot driven and perfectly matches pace with humor that, again, we do not care. And, of course, so many of the scenes reflect such deep disdain for people who are not Western but that attitude would not come back to bite us, a little, and them, a lot, for another decade or two.

It still great to watch but for first time viewers... it will be corny since you are used to mondern films. I watched 1966 batman tv show and it was horrible but when I was a kid it seeemed so awesome. Same thing with Indiana jones and etc. shows like I love Lucy still seem ok by mondern standards to me. Anyway it's not bad if u can't find anything else but it is corny to me.,1484697600,,528,4.186274509803922

Great family fun, this film is Spielberg at his best (director) and Harrison Ford was at the top of his game.  This was our first look at the Indiana Jones character, who was later showcased in 3 additional movies. The exciting plot, which incorporates actual events, starts out with our hero risking life and limb to procure an artifact in the Amazon jungle and follows him as he fights Nazi to win the priceless Ark of the Covenant. It doesn't get much better than this and I have to say it stands the test of time.  Definitely 5 stars in my book!",1484352000,3,669,4.251968503937008

Always missing from the Indiana Jones have been gratiutious and out of place sex scenes.  Hopefully if they make another one following Crystal Skull, they'll slip a few in there that almost garner the film an NC-17 rating.

132852,5,0792158202,"I had the honor and privilege to work on the production of this film. The last time that I saw it was at the cast and crew preview screening in May 1981. Today, I watched it on the January 4, 2017, and I still enjoy it. They don't make films like this anymore.",1483488000,,260,3.9245283018867925
132853,5,0792158202,"Wow, the Uncharted games are an exact copy of this movie. The acting seems kind of bad but it is old so I guess that is OK.",1483488000,,123,3.5925925925925926
132854,2,0792158202,"Watched on a well calibrated smart TV through Amazon Prime. It didn't look like film. The constant assault of bold color was incredibly distracting. It undermined the gritty reality the original movie once had. One of my favorite shots in movie history (Jones and the digging crew in sunset light) looked awful. The silhouettes had weird bright orange edges on one side. Whoever did the digital scan, transfer, and color timing was apparently lacking in color perception if they had to crank it up that high. It was like the painfully oversaturated Star Wars special editions. Maybe movie companies do this kind of picture quality reduction to thwart piracy. The real, believable looking films are being held back.

Beautiful, colorful things need neutral or even bland backgrounds to stand out. Natural, subdued color photography is quite beautiful on its own. By pushing the color of everything as high as possible, the movie became ugly. The boosting of shadows didn't help either, since screen darkness is helpful to convey location darkness. Dark places seemed artificially overlit. The constant orange tint was tiresome as well. I don't remember this enjoyable movie looking like this in its 1981 theatrical run. I'd rather watch a story on film, not something looking like unrealistically clean digital video with all ""imperfections"" strained out.

The story hasn't aged well. All the surprising moments, so effective at the time, lacked entertainment value 36 years later. I detected the clumsy hand of George Lucas in many of the tedious and stilted action sequences starting with the fighter plane scene. The existence of so many dumb, awful sequels has diminished the power of this once fresh adventure. I salute the movie's light touch and sense of freedom, but the bizarre need of all the later movies and TV episodes to shoehorn ""iconic"" stuff in all the time makes Raiders of the Lost Ark seem recycled now.

Another beautiful, living creature sacrificed on the altar of Man's greed!",1483488000,,1998,5.103975535168196

133336,5,0792158202,"In the early 20th century, the fantasy-adventure genre was in vogue in the pulp magazines such as ""Amazing Stories"" and ""Weird Tales"" where western-society adventurers, typically British and American, replete with safari hat and khaki pants traveled to a far-away locale encountering ancient relics and ancient peoples. There would be a few obligatory scenes where an ancient people with spears would be chasing after the hero. Alan Quartermain was one of the first of these adventure-heroes traveling to distant lands seeking adventure. A few of these adventure-genre stories were produced into films, such as ""King Kong"", ""The Most Dangerous Game"" (by the same producers as ""King King""), ""Four Frightened People"", and ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"". Even the ""Flash Gordon"" serials had much in common with these adventure-to-other-lands series. ""The Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is a late 20th-century updated version of these old adventure films and takes place during the 1930's when Hitler and the Nazis ruled Germany.

Oddly, the adventure films of the so-called Golden Age of Hollywood, circa 1930 to 1960, were relegated to B-film status and the serials. With the possible exception of ""King Kong"", most adventure films were low budget B-films with lesser-known actors, lower budgets, and relatively mediocre scripts. Many of these offerings were shot on sound-stages in Hollywood. When ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" premiered in the early 1980's, the adventure film had received some serious face-lifts. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" set the standard with better scripts, better actors, location-shooting, and larger budgets, incorporating fun, adventure, antiquities, and even some humor into a satisfying cinematic experience.

When he's not engaging in mediocre lectures as a nerdy professor at his university, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford in one of his defining roles) is an archaeological adventurer, seeking antiquities throughout the world for museums in the western world, predominantly for the United States and Britain. His arch-rival is Belloq (Paul Freeman), a French archaeologist who has sold his soul to the Nazis in return for financing archaeological exploits. Jones studied under Dr. Abner Ravenwood, an archaeologist who has gone missing somewhere in Asia. Jones briefly dated his daughter, Marion, before the beginning of the events of the story.

After an altercation with his rival Belloq, losing a gold religious icon-head in Peru, Indiana Jones is approached by the US government to engage in a treasure hunt which has a nearly 2500-year history. The Nazis are after the so-called Ark of the Covenant (not to be confused with Noah's Ark, Joan of Arc, or Archie Bunker), an ornate gold chest which supposedly housed the Ten Commandments brought down from on High by Moses to the Israelites, a.k.a. the Jews/Hebrews of Pre-Christianity. According to Old Testament biblical tradition, the Ark of the Covenant resided in the ""Holy of Holies"" in the Great Temple in Jerusalem and would only have been seen by the highest priests of the temple. The Ark went missing after the Babylonians conquered the Israelites circa 500 BCE. (Whether the Ark actually existed has been debated for nearly 2000 years. Although some antiquities-hunters and Christian-Evangelicals want to believe the Ark may still exist, more than likely, if it had existed, it was destroyed by the Babylonians who probably melted down the Ark for its gold to create their own treasures and artifacts.)

The Allies believe the Nazis desiring the Ark of the Covenant has to do with their quest for ultimate domination, the Ark associated with divine power. So if the Nazis think they can attain the Ark, the Allies better confiscate it before they do. So US government officials offer Indiana Jones an offer he can't refuse: finance him to find the Ark before the Nazis. He travels first to Nepal where he meets his old flame, Marion Ravenwood, who has in her possession an amulet which turns out to be a crucial piece of the puzzle to find the Ark. The Nazis are also hot on Jones' trail. Marion and Indiana then travel to Cairo, Egypt, where the Nazis are already engaging in a large-scale dig for the Ark. Jones solicits the help of Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) to hire a crew of excavators to find the Ark before Belloq and the Nazis. Unfortunately, Belloq has often been able to take artifact-treasures literally right out of Jones' hands.

One of the all-time great action-adventure films with a humorous script, top-notch acting, and wonderful scenic shots. A few scenes use some of the Old Hollywood devices, like a map with an animated line showing their journey across the globe. Some of the chase scenes go on a little bit long, but there's plenty of other ingredients which keeps the story fresh and moving. Even the love-story which is rekindled between Marion and Indiana is a nice relief from the action. One of the best scenes is how they discover the actual location of the Ark, supposedly hidden in the lost city of Tanis in Egypt not far from Cairo. While Tanis was a real ancient city now in ruins, the idea the Ark would have been placed there seems quite fantastical, considering the Ark was lost when they were conquered by Babylon, not Egypt. The Egyptians probably could have cared less about a Jewish artifact. However, we tend to run with the story all the way.",1473724800,6,5365,5.078231292517007

133463,3,0792158202,for a 1981 film the special effects and production of the film are excellent and most likely high budget.  the acting and scenary plus story are all worth while but overall its not my type of film and I find myself getting bored with all the action in reality.  I just don't care much for this type of film however I do appreciate the temple of doom part 2 much more because I always found it intriguing as a young boy watching it.  most likely the mystique of the temple and beauty of all the visuals in part 2 appeal to me more than the first film or parts 3 and 4 as well.,1469491200,,575,4.026315789473684

133686,5,0792158202,"It's hard to find fault with this movie. Steven Spielberg's skill as a director is undeniable. He perfectly balances humor and danger in a way that is relentlessly entertaining. The action never lets up. Almost like a ride at an amusement park. John Williams's score deserves billing as a main character, standing front and center and greatly enhancing every scene.

Having not seen it for a while, and getting a fresh impression, I guess the thing that stood out most is that Indiana Jones is really not portrayed as a good guy in this one. He's just one of many greedy and self-interested people seeking ""fortune and glory"". His treatment of Marion (Karen Allen) is particularly bad. We learn early that he used and dumped her in the past, and later he leaves her in Nazi custody when he could have rescued her, because he doesn't want to screw up his quest for the archaeological prize. She clearly loves him, and he doesn't particularly care. You could say she forced him to let her tag along, but still, you don't leave a girl to potentially die like that.

That overall lack of morality on the part of the characters serves the title concept of the film, and leads to the final conclusion, which also stands out because it would never be made today. That is:

(SPOILER?)

That these greedy and power hungry characters find out that the Bible is true.

(END SPOILER)

The film is quite violent for its PG rating, but in just the right amounts to maintain the real threats against the funnier parts of the movie.

Raiders of the Lost Ark is basically a textbook for how to make an entertaining, mainstream action/adventure movie for a wide audience. Often imitated, never duplicated. I've never met anybody who didn't like it.",1466121600,,1730,4.68976897689769

Our niece was having a surprise and costume party for our nephew and the theme was Indiana Jones. We watched this movie to get ideas of what to wear for costumes. I also make cupcakes with tiny skulls on top and snakes coming down the side of the tiered iron tray.

134125,5,0792158202,"Raiders of the Lost Ark, 1981 film

This was the most popular film in the summer of 1981, and played to packed audiences. It must have resonated with peoples emotions as an action film unlike many others. It starts with an adventure  an explorer travels to a savage society in order to steal their wealth (for scientific knowledge of course). He fails when another adventurer expropriates his winnings, but survives to return to his teaching job at a university. The film shows him traveling in a flying Clipper from the 1930s, but not on a railroad (passenger trains are now obsolete).

It is a good action film, as long as you don't question some of the scenes. Could Nazi Germany have military forces in 1936 Egypt? Could German Schmeisser sub machine guns be found in 1936 Nepal? I don't believe so. I suspect these scenes were copied from the 1940 serials that entertained moviegoers. Indiana Jones will entertain you as an action adventure story with a multitude of cliches from long forgotten films. Sliding under the truck recalls Yakima Canutes famous stunt. Some scenes seem far fetched to me (when you think about it). Could Indiana Jones on a horse overtake a convoy of trucks? The theme music came from the 1948 film Don Juan starring Errol Flynn (rarely seen on TV). The chase through the maze of streets reminds me of 1940 cartoons. Other scenes may be derived from other old movies (the truck knocking down scaffolding from Abbot & Costello Meet the Keystone Kops). A few sequels were made, but it failed to be translated into a television series. Just like Jaws. The ending scene reminded me of the movie Kiss Me, Deadly.",1451865600,,1638,4.7403508771929825

134366,5,0792158202,"Raiders of the Lost Ark has earned a spot on BoldList's Top 5 Action Movies list!

Cool tidbits about Raiders:
- Jeff Bridges actually turned down the role of Indiana Jones
- During fight scenes, most of the body blows you hear were created by hitting a pile of leather jackets with a baseball bat.
- During filming in Tunisia, nearly everyone in the cast and crew got sick, except director Steven Spielberg. It is thought that he avoided illness by eating only the food he'd brought with him: cans and cans of Spaghetti-O's

Our remakes like Robocop and Total Recall for all their technology, are mostly lifeless and humorless. Raiders had a story and a format that a thousand movies have tried to mimic ever since. When people don't have CGI, they are forced to figure out how to make things look real. My suggestion to today's filmmakers is to make the film CGI and color in the things you can't create in the real world. CGI should be a band aid, not the only paint in your palette.",1436400000,,591,4.238938053097345

134534,5,0792158202,"One of the things that makes ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" stand out among ""modern"" action movies, i.e. action movies in the era of summer blockbusters that Lucas helped to create, is the way that it seems to have been transported to us from an earlier time. It is well-known that George Lucas was interested in recreating the feel of 1930s and 1940s adventure and sci-fi serials, not only for Indiana Jones but for Star Wars as well. The Indiana Jones movies, and ""Raiders"" most of all, therefore does not look like a big-budget production. It makes very little obvious use of special effects technology, even less so than Star Wars which had mostly used practical effects such as scale models and puppets. The distinctive Indiana Jones color palette is drab, from the tweedy earth-tones of an archaelogy professor's office to the olives and grays of WWII-era military vehicles to the unadorned off-whites of a desert tent village. The movie's image quality is, by design, ever so slightly dusty and murky. It feels nostalgic and vintage, and I recall it feeling that way even when I first encountered it as a child in the early 1990s. It feels small and unprepossessing, like a secret that very few have uncovered. It is like nothing so much as an old classic newly rediscovered. Perhaps that is also what helps keep it fresh so many years later. To rediscover it now, or ten years ago, or ten years from now, is to be transported not to 1981 but to a mythical version of the 1930s, reimagined here as the last age of globe- trotting adventurers, with a layover travel map a la ""Casablanca,"" and Arabian bazaars and snakes and pith helmets and, of course, those ever- scheming Nazis. It doesn't hurt that the story is rock-solid and moves along at a perfect clip, that the script hits every note it aims for from humorous to mystical to ""epic,"" and that Harrison Ford and Karen Allen have great chemistry together (she should have been his partner throughout the trilogy; she radiates confidence and power even when the script tries to limit her to the pot-smashing damsel-in-distress role.) It may seem strange that such a purely entertaining movie, with no whiff of a message and no grand artistic pretensions, would occupy such a prominent place in the history of film, comfortably making both AFI lists of the 100 best American movies and enjoying almost universal critical and popular acclaim. But since you have seen it, as almost everyone of all ages has, you know why it does.",1423180800,2,2482,4.747685185185185
134535,3,0792158202,Still holds up!,1423094400,,15,4.333333333333333
134536,5,0792158202,"The biggest blockbuster of 1981, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" introduced the now-iconic Indiana Jones, played by Harrison Ford. The film is a series of globetrotting adventures as Jones and other characters seek the lost Ark of the Covenant and (gulp) dare to open it.

""Raiders"" ranks with my top five films of all time. Not only is the action/adventure exhilarating from beginning to end, the story's compelling and the characters are interesting. Ford is excellent, of course, but you also get Karen Allen (Miriam), Paul Freeman (Belloq), Ronald Lacey (Major Arnold Toht), Wolf Kahler (Colonel Dietrich), John Rhys-Davies (Sallah) and several more (e.g. Denholm Elliott). Rhys-Davies and Lacey are standout examples of the excellent supporting cast.

Everything about ""Raiders"" magically works and you can tell the incredible effort that was put into making it. While Steven Spielberg directed it, George Lucas & Phillip Kaufman came up with the story and Lawrence Kasdan wrote the screenplay. Needless to say, it's significantly better than the three sequels/prequels, as well as the direct-to-video/TV ones. Don't get me wrong, most of the other Indy adventures are worthwhile, but none capture the beginning-to-end magic of the original.

The film was so successful that a hoard of movies clearly borrowed from it in the ensuing decades. Some quite successfully, like 1999's ""The Mummy,"" and others not-so-successfully, like 2001's ""The Mummy Returns."" Speaking of the latter film, it has a lot going for it, including the Indiana Jones appeal: A great cast, locations, costumes, cinematography, F/X, etc., but it's all for naught as the plot and characters are merely a clothesline to string together continuous action and F/X sequences. It's all style and ""excitement"" without substance. ""Raiders,"" by contrast - fun as it is - includes an interesting story, character depth and even some fascinating insights. On top of this is the string of action sequences second-to-none: The jungle treasure opening, the Nepal bar brouhaha, the streets of Cairo chase, the Well of Souls in Tanis sequence, the plane episode, the truck sequence, and, of course, the thrilling and horrifying opening of the sacred Ark.

The jungle scenes were shot in Kaua'i; the Cairo/desert scenes in Tunisia; the Nazi submarine base in France; the college scenes in Hertfordshire, England; the D.C. scenes in San Francisco; and other scenes in Stockton, CA, and England.

The film runs 115 minutes.

  Everyone knows the story, hero and renowned archeologist soldier of fortune, and expert in the occult, (Ford) Dr. Indiana Jones, is hired by the U.S. Government to find the Biblical Ark of the Covenant, which is believed to still hold the ten commandments some where buried in the sands of Egypt.

 Indiana Jones is the world's top treasure hunter, next to his arch and sinister unscrupulous rival (Paul Freeman) Beluche the French tomb raider and archeological black market dealer.  Beluche beats Ford to the mysterious Mayan treasure in the South American jungles, and then makes a deal with the monsters of the Third Reich who will stop at nothing to find the lost ark.

Paul Freeman (Beluche) knows that the Nazis are basically a bunch of brutish stupid apes with the intellectual capacitance equal to that of a bucket of rocks (just as they were in real history), but he makes a deal with them out of desperation and the desire to have an advantage over anyone else in the hunt for the Ark.

A real vital & lovable character in this film is Sallah, played by English actor John Ryes Davis, his character is Egypt's top expert and he helps Indiana Jones on his quest to find the Ark and save the planet from the unethical Beluche, and Hitler's own deadly despotic scheme.

  This film has beautiful scenery, marvelous characters, daring stunts, amazing special effects, great action scenes, tied with John Williams phenomenal musical score.

 Beloche is an excellent villain, he unlike his Nazi partners in crime, is very intelligent and plays as a an equal to Harrison Ford.  Indiana uses just the right amount of muscle, guts, and bravado tied with the most important muscle of all his brain to never quit on his self crusade to find the Ark and keep away from the German Nazi enemy forces who would use the treasure to destroy the world.

 We have traditional Hollywood scenery and movie flow, the good guy during a major time of need just happens to find a strong gorgeous horse to ride off and chase down his enemy single handedly, even jumping on top of a U-Boat!

 George Lucas and Spielberg got these movies right from concept, to casting, to filming, editing, and total production making Ford and this film franchise one of the absolute greatest ever made.  Five stars for the greatest movies of all time.  Hope there is a fifth one better then the flawed newer one.",1422403200,,2643,4.764835164835165

A groundbreaking adventure with a hero who defined the term ""swashbuckling,"" Indy was everything I wanted to be when I was little.  No I didn't become an archeologist but I did develop a lifelong love for great adventure film, and I always get that spine-tingling sense of excitement no matter how many times I see this movie.  Here we have action, humor (the sword/gun fight scene is one of the funniest things I have seen on screen), a tough love interest who holds her own in a fight, and legitimately threatening villains. There's also a supernatural spooktacular event near the end which is just as scary now as it was in its time (thanks to well-done special effects).  There actually isn't a bad moment to be found here even when the action takes a brief pause to advance the plot.  This is a must-see for anyone who wants to know where the modern action genre of film came from, and a true classic for the ages.",1421884800,,1020,4.491891891891892

134650,5,0792158202,"What can you say about Raiders of the Lost Ark that hasn't been said before? It has been analysed, deconstructed, praised and written about at length by everyone from the highest of film critics to the man of the street film lover and his dog. Truth is, is that nothing new can be added to the millions of tomes written about what Spielberg coyly announced was his B movie homage to adventure serials of the 30s and 40s.

In simple factoid terms it was roughly made for $20 million and went on to make nearly $400 million! It quickly pulled Spielberg out of a depressive rut after the critical mauling of his period comedy movie 1941. It announced Harrison Ford as a superstar actor whilst simultaneously introducing pop culture references that still thrive today. It won four Oscars and was nominated for a further four, and as it made archaeology sexy it heralded the opening of a new era for the summer blockbuster. The whole production (apart from Spielberg) were taken ill whilst filming in Tunisia and it was the start of a franchise that still brings great GREAT pleasures to millions of fans.

Why is Raiders so adored? That it is a film that still entertains royally today, where once loved in 1981 is still loved by the very same older and wiser people in the new millennium? The answer is it gets everything right, it transcends its basic source to reveal one of the most exhilarating action/adventure movies ever made. It's packed with outstanding action set-pieces (amazing stunt-work), the special effects stunning, the locations are sumptuous, the cinematography gorgeous and Williams' score stirs the blood and raises the gooseflesh. The narrative is smooth and appealing in its good versus bad race against time simplicity, yet the pace is frenetic. From the establishment of the kinetic pleasures with its iconic opening section, to the gloriously gruesome finale, it's breakneck stuff that is by turns intense but played with considerable wit and playfulness.

Casting is also spot on, with Ford leading the way. Ford's performance as Indiana Jones - part time teacher, part time lovable rogue who lurches from one perilous situation to another - is note perfect. It's a performance of style and substance that is often wrongly ignored by the stuffy, purely because of the genre of film it sits in. That Ford oozes comic book heroics without falling into campy clich is a great achievement, while of course he gave us iconography unbound that still exists today. The supporting performances are also outstanding, with Allen's spunky hard drinking Marion and Freeman's weasel Nazi stooge Belloq particularly hitting the heights. While on the other side of the camera and at the writing table, the trio of Spielberg, Kasdan and Lucas prove to be a meeting of classical adventure loving heart and minds, for the film is crafted with humour, energy and skill.

It undoubtedly owes a debt to olde Hollywood fare like Gunga Din, Secret of The Incas and Valley of the Kings (and more), while some stereotyping of natives exists because the film harks back to olde Hollywood adventure movies! And undeniably it's a teenytiny bit annoying that as we enter the home straight Allen's character arc has her shift from tough dame to ""save me Indy"" fodder, but small complaints be damned. This is top line genre film making, where true love is proved to always last a lifetime, because, quite simply, Raiders of the Lost Ark is still the modern day template for action/adventure movies.",1410393600,4,3491,4.911864406779661

""Tanis development proceeding.  Acquire headpiece, Staff of Ra.  Abner Ravenwood, U.S.""

The above secret German cable is the motivation for this fantasy adventure film (from a story by George Lucas and Philip Kaufman, directed by Steven Spielberg).  For if the Germans acquire the headpiece, they will be able to locate the lost Ark of the Covenant with its mysterious powers.  (The Ark of the Covenant is a chest that contains the stone tablets in which the Ten Commandments are inscribed.)

It's up to Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) to locate the Ark before the Germans do.  Dr. Jones is Professor of Archaeology, expert on the occult, and obtainer of rare antiquities.  Jones' trademark when he's in the field is his bullwhip and Fedora (a type of hat).

This movie could very well be the greatest adventure film of all time.  The viewer is treated to one cliff hanger after another.  As well, the acting and special effects are good.  (This is Alfred Molina's acting debut.)

What I especially liked was the blend of humor, adventure, and drama.  Also, the music by the great John Williams is unforgettable.

Photography was in France, Tunisia, Hawaii, and studios in England.

The title of this movie was originally ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" but was later changed for marketing purposes.

This film originated from George Lucas' desire to create a modern version of the serials of the 1930s and 1940s.

The budget for this movie was eighteen million dollars.  It has grossed almost three-hundred and ninety million worldwide!

Finally, the DVD itself (released in 2008) has six extras.  I found most of them interesting.

In conclusion, I would recommend that you have your seat belts on when you view this film.  Why?  Because you're going to be taken on a non-stop action-adventure!!

134777,2,0792158202,"I was looking for a streaming video from Amazon to watch with the kids when I noticed Indiana Jones. This was listed with a rating of PG, so I thought it would be okay to watch with my 8 year old. I hadn't seen the movie in years, but I remembered I loved it back in the day. Unfortunately, my latest attempt to see the movie was not nearly as enjoyable.

For starters, I opted to pay the up-charge to stream it in HD. The picture quality was absolutely horrible. I've streamed many movies from Amazon in the past without issues. This one, however, was nearly unwatchable. I understand this is an old movie, but when it's listed as an HD title, and I pay a premium for HD, I expect to see picture quality at or near HD. This is far from it.

The second reason I rated this so low is the PG rating. This movie has a LOT of gun violence, blood, people dying horrible deaths, etc. There is no way I would rate this move PG. At a minimum, this should be PG-13, if not an R rating.

To summarize, I love the movie itself, but the awful picture quality and high level of violence with a PG rating compelled me to post this review.",1393718400,4,1124,4.123287671232877

In my view, it is an unfunny fantasy comedy, poorly written, and a waste of my time except for  family political values.  If it is supposed to be an action thriller, it fails.

But the transfer leaves much to be desired. It's obviously they did heavy digital clean-up, resulting in motion artifacts all over the place. Someone moves their head (even a little bit) and entire screen goes out of focus for during the motion. And that's unacceptable. Fortunately that does not plague the entire film. Mostly during the indoor sequences.

There is also some source related issues...where some of the more darkly lighted sequences show very noticiable frame damage. Particularly at Indy's home and at the University.

But despite the motion artifacts (very annoying) and print damage, the good news is that most of the time it's pretty sharp & colorful without obvious Edge Enhancement.",1390176000,,821,5.022058823529412

as seperate single cases this time
the last time was in 2011 a fold out Digi-book with all 4 Discs plus bonus Disc
which had all the making of Doco's plus some new featurettes

well this time these new single case reissue's
have no special features at all not even the Bonus Disc, all you get is the film & the Theatrical trailer
so for all the fans out there that have the Digi-book which has the Bonus Disc keep it
don't waste your money on these reissue's
what paramount should have done if they were going to reissue each film again with their own blu-ray case
is add the making of Documentaries to the new reissue's aswell
each film has a making of featurette/Doco so it would make sense to add the featurette's to each single Blu-ray Disc
plus all the other small featurettes aswell

but of course Paramount did not bother or were to Lazy which does not surprise me
well these blu-ray reissues are a waste of money and space
Disgusting effort by Paramount
i'll be keeping my blu-ray Digi-book released back in 2011 which has all 5 discs

I never saw them, but I have seen a few.  Flash Gordon is my personal best.  But Indiana Jones is a great big hero in the fashion of those serials, but given a whole film of great moments hung over a fabulous story.  It made me a very happy fella.

Brilliant performances by Harrison Ford, and John Rhys Davies and direction by Steven Spielberg this is a movie that is so good, that after 30 some odd years it still commands $18.00 for a Google play.

Everything works in this flick. The story, the actors interaction, the believability, the sets, the costumes, the music, the pulse of the action.

Ok that is the bad news, The good news is the picture, and sound are awesome. I just got a surround sound system and this movie was made for it. The colors jump off the screen, The dialogue is clear, and crisp. If you love Indiana Jones buy this film.

I found the blu-ray to be sadly underwhelming - at most it makes the movie watchable on a 57"" screen, but that is all. I don't mind grain - especially in older movies, because that comes with the territory - but this BD is badly in need of color restoration and possibly a transfer from filmstock that is not ""dirty"". Scenes appear washed out, overly bright and flat. I get that the movie can only look as good as the film it was shot on - but it would be a shame if this was the best that survived. *Note, my review is based on the disc that came with the boxed set, unless there was restoration done for this single release I would recommend waiting for a good price if you must have it, but with the caution that visually it is not all it could be.",1385596800,8,941,4.091891891891892

134829,5,0792158202,"It's sad that the world is really trying to milk some of these classics for all they are worth to the point where they aren't worth much anymore.  From `Indiana Jones' to `Star Wars', Hollywood seems intent on finding more ways to stretch its life out instead of just allowing us to bask in the glory of the originals.

`Raiders of the Lost Ark' is the ultimate `original'.

One of the coolest things about the Indiana Jones franchise was the way that it melded action, adventure and history into something unbelievably entertaining.  Taking place in 1936, a professor of archeology is hired to find the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis can use it for evil.  Jones travels the globe in pursuit of the Biblical artifact, and along the way encounters savage fights with Nazis and some brilliantly staged action pieces.

`Raiders of the Lost Ark' is the definition of exciting.

What is great about the original trilogy is that they really stand the tests of time.  Even today, they are remarkably exciting and modern in feel.  The action scenes are just as engaging and realistic and the humor is not lost on modern audiences.  Ford created an iconic character here (like he did the previous decade with Han Solo) and Spielberg was clearly at the top of his game (he usually is when he's having fun).  When you mix those two facts in with the ravishing techs and a storyline that is the right amount of complex to be enthralling from start to finish and you have an unforgettable movie experience.",1381190400,,1499,4.661596958174905

I had never seen Raiders Of The Lost Ark until just a few weeks ago.  I saw The Temple Of Doom in the theater when it came out in 1984, but never the first movie.  Really nothing more needs to be said about it.  A movie for the ages starring Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones.  Personally, I think it's a good movie, but I don't have the need or desire to watch it over and over.  I respect it, though.  George Lucas and Steven Spielberg teaming up...you really can't go wrong.  I recommend seeing this movie at least once.",1376784000,,615,4.278260869565218

134841,5,0792158202,"I'm 44 years old. I am too young to have seen Casablanca or Roman Holiday in the cinemas, or even the original run of The Godfather. But I did see this film on the big screen when it was released in 1981.

The movie is awesome, full of great lines, great scenes (Han shoots first!), great temple-destroying effects and flesh-melting graphics, and an earth-destroying topic that doesn't need to ACTUALLY show the initiation of the ACTUAL destruction of the earth (hello Michael Bey) to get the job done. Plus lots of snakes! Great dialogue: ""Asps... very dangerous... you go first."" ""We are merely passing through history. This... this IS history."" Everyone's seen the movie anyway, so there's no need to review it scene by scene; if you're one of the few people around who've ACTUALLY never seen it, make sure that you do.

The extras are good fun too. There are quite a few interviews from 1981, with Spielberg saying he told George Lucas he wanted to do a James Bond movie with a John Wayne score. Tom Selleck was cast, but couldn't do it in the end. Spielberg explained how ET, Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind all went over budget, his goal was to get Raiders in under budget and under schedule (he's not saying so, but he was probably under massive pressure coming from somewhere else - maybe his own pocketbook - to do so), it came in 15 days under schedule. Nice.

This disc came out in the prelude to Indiana Jones 4, the crappy crystal skull movie that was ruined by a bad screenplay and the presence of Shia Laboeuf (not that it didn't make money for the studio, but still...). And so, Shia makes an appearance to give comments, as does Cate Blanchett. Very nice re-creation of the melting head scene where they explain how it was done - fascinating. Great photo gallery. Among them are shots of George Lucas hanging out with Stephen Spielberg on sets all over the world in his white tube socks - looks really weird.",1371859200,,1937,4.560344827586207
134842,5,0792158202,The first in the series.  I have the whole series in VHS but they are about finished.  They have outlived their life.  I like to watch this once a year.,1371772800,,152,4.0
134843,4,0792158202,"The plot is pretty well known at this point, it comprises a series of misadventures.  Things are gained, lost, regained, lost again.  Even though it appears Indiana Jones is one step ahead of everyone, he's actually a couple steps behind and fighting to catch up or overtake.  The same rule applies to fight sequences and chase sequences.  He's not much of an archeology professor (rarely being in class), and as one opponent observes, ""you're going to give mercenary's a bad name.""  He's actually a bit of a stinker, considering how many times he's willing to sacrifice an old girlfriend (Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood), for personal gain.  Sadly, not much of their history is given to explain her animosity towards him, but one suspects, from his actions, that it's well deserved.  After a reunion of sorts, he ruins her establishment, puts her in harm's way multiple times, and more or less steals/borrows her headpiece for his own purpose (he does not, during the course of this movie, give it back to her).
On the whole, this is a fast paced thrill ride fraught with complications, danger, and high adventure.  Snakes and spiders play prominent roles, as do various nefarious Nazis (the perfect villains).  One in particular bears more than a striking resemblance to Peter Lorre (Ronald Lacey), to great effect.  There's a bar fight to top all bar fights, and even a Nazi monkey is on hand.  If you don't think about it too much, this is the perfect popcorn flick for any Saturday afternoon.",1370563200,,1498,4.8352941176470585
134844,5,0792158202,"This film is a nod to all the old time serials and it put us face to face with one of the greatest cinematic heroes of all time. Raiders is wonderful because it is a pure and simple adventure with wonderful characters, a great score, and intriguing scenes. This truly is one of the best action films of all time. Introducing a great hero in Indiana Jones this movie is a blast every minute. With his whip, pistol, and iconic fedora, Indy travels the world in order to track down the Ark of the Covenant. However his arch rival Belloq is also searching for it backed by the Nazis. Indy's search kindles an old flame in Marion Ravenwood and reunites him with his friend Sallah. Jones has a knack for adventure and despite constant obstacles he is never truly beaten. However Belloq does seem to have the last laugh by testing the uncovered Ark. Its power is so great though it destroys all who look at it. So Indy and Marion escape narrowly with their lives. With its great combination of George Lucas and Steven Speilberg along with a great score, this film is a lot of fun. It is difficult not to like the adventures of this classic hero.",1370044800,,1138,4.423809523809524

134846,5,0792158202,"Lucas and Spielberg's first ode to the serial adventure is still a densely atmospheric, loaded thrill ride. Indy is such a fascinating, larger-than-life personality that he outright demands our attention when he's on the screen (which is something like 95% of the time) and, even when we think we've got him figured out, still manages to surprise us. Casting Harrison Ford was absolutely crucial, though, because without his off-the-chart levels of confidence and charisma, the character wouldn't have been able to get away with half the things he does or says. Although it trots the globe, seemingly without rest, the plot is actually very well-paced and wisely gives the cold shoulder to any hint of overwrought back-story or origin. We're having enough fun in the present, so why get caught up in anything more complicated than ""He's a professor who moonlights as a tomb raider""? Quick-witted and funny when appropriate, exciting and unpredictable the rest of the time, it manages a near-perfect blend of realism and fantasy. The dark, dated cinematography is probably the only aspect of the film that hasn't aged gracefully.",1368230400,,1128,5.169398907103825

The story is well developed, and no one could have made the swashbuckling hero Indiana Jones their own as well as Harrison Ford did.

Indiana Jones is and archeologist, who also teaches part time. And the bad guys in this movie are the Nazis, their quest. The Ark Of The Covenant, Now Lucas didn't want Harrison Ford to be in this movie, seeing as how he had already done Star Wars. Just think , we almost had either Kurt Russel or Tom sellick as Indiana Jones. But Spielberg insisted on Ford, And it really feels like you're watching an old serial, as Dr. Jones must survive one cliffhanger after another. We get Karen Allen as his ex-flame Marion Ravenwood, who tags along, only because she has the missing piece to staff of Ra. There is also Indy's rival in the business Renee Belloq,  Jones getting locked in the well of souls, surrounded by tons and tons snakes. With Marion, and he has to figure out how to get out, the ending where the Nazis decide to open the Ark. Only to have it kill all who look in the Ark, which leaves Indy and Marion.

A crumpled document leads him to a cave bursting with deadly traps.  Cautiously, Indy wends his way to the idol, but then, when he takes the Idol . . . .

If you are Indiana your disappointment with your last quest is forgotten when two army intel men ask your help interpreting a cryptic Nazi message which says they need the headpiece of the staff of Ra from Abner Ravenwood for their dig at Tanis.  Stunned, you realize they are about to find the Ark of the Covenant, but if you can beat them to Abner . . . .

If you were Abner Ravenwood you died some time ago - unbeknownst to Indy.  Ten years ago you were Indy's mentor.  Your daughter Marion was quiet smitten with him.  After you died, Marion took over your tavern . . . .

If you are Marion Ravenwood you are still in love with Indy, but when you recall how he took advantage of you - you get mad!  So when he walks his sorry-butt into your bar, you let him have it.  When he asks for a trinket that your father dug up, you tell him to come back tomorrow; he leaves.  Just then, some thugs come in with a strange man in black . . . .

If you are the man in black you know that Abner is dead, so Fraulein Ravenwood must have the headpiece.  You're pleased when she resists you offer - doing the bidding of Mein Fuhrer has unleashed your barbarian soul!

Raiders was the first Indiana Jones movie and it echoes China(1943), Treasure of the Sierra Madre(1948), and Gunga Din(1939) as well as some of the early James Bond movies. Sean Connery played Indiana Jones' father in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade(1989). In the year 1936, Professor Henry ""Indiana"" Jones(Harrison Ford) tries to find the Lost Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis do. Indiana Jones is also stuck with his former ""love"", Marion Ravenwood(Karen Allen). John Williams' epic, sweeping, 1940's style music score is an instantly recognizable classic. Ronald Lacey played Toht in Raiders. He played a similar character in Aces Go Places IV(1986). Alfred Molina played a two faced guy who gets covered in spiders! Molina played Doc Ock in Spiderman 2(2004). In Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones goes from one perilous situation to another just like in the Hollywood B-movie serials from the 1930's and the 1940's! The scene where Marion gets into a drinking match with a man was ripped off in Fantasy Mission Force(1984). At one time, Tom Selleck and Sean Young were cast as Indiana Jones and Marion Ravenwood.

134948,5,0792158202,"The beginning of the myth, of the legend of that Indian Jones. Worth seeing again today and funny like hell, except if you are afraid of snakes or spiders. Steven Spielberg and his friend George Lucas are obsessed by Hitler and the Nazis. They situate the film in 1936, In Egypt where the Germans are looking for the Lost Ark of the Temple of Jerusalem. Indiana Jones is not only an adventurer, sorry a university professor turned adventurer during his vacation, but he is also the good guy who is fulfilling a quasi-divine mission, that of saving a Jewish mythical artifact from the hands of the Nazis because it is too valuable to let it rot in bad hands, but also because it is said it may give eternal life to the person who would control it. With that in mind and with a little bit of romanticism and sentimentalism he is able to complete the mission, to destroy a few German Nazis along with it and to sow the seed that will produce the Junior who will take over four films later to assume the continuation of the myth in the 21st century. Of course what is essential and unique in this film is the action, a perfectly gratuitous action that is shown only for our pleasure and in no way for our reflection or moral improvement. And it works perfectly well along that line. Still quite enjoyable today nearly thirty years later. A student recently pretended that good special effects were not common in that period and before. This film proves he is wrong. Special effects were maybe less technical, certainly less computerized than today, but they were just as creative and inventive as today, with a lot less technical means, hence with a lot more sweat and grey matter.

134950,5,0792158202,"As a child of the 80s, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was the epitome of movie making.  Two big directors, a huge star, Nazis, the unknown, a spooky finale, action, adventure, humor, far away lands - this movie, this one singular film had it all.  This film had something for everyone; man, woman, and child could all sit around and be amazed by Indy's adventure.  Everything about this film is addicting.  Watching it then, and even today - Indiana Jones' theme music stuck with me for hours afterwards.  This film is more than just a casual view; it is a part of history in the making.  The cult icon that Spielberg and Lucas created breathed a celebrity life into the world of archaeology, but also has handed the world a character that felt real and exciting.  With that said, re-watching this staple of my youth today, in 2009, it became a far different cinematic experience.  ""Raiders"" is an important film, it is still an amazing film to watch, it is still two hours of entertaining adventure, but does the DVD do it justice?  Is ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" only really meant to be enjoyed on VHS?  These questions arise from crisper images shouting through my player at night, the lack of detail around the edges (don't be ashamed of the VHS fuzz), and how bright this dusty hero should have looked.  I am not judging quality here, but Indy will always remain a VHS protagonist in my book.

""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" as a stand-alone film works better than anything that could be released today.  It takes the adventurous introduction of a man in search of a gold statue and juxtaposes it with an image of Indy as a teacher.  It is a film that even after numerous viewings, the deadpan humor of Harrison Ford remains funny and repeatable in a group of friends.  This, unlike ""Crystal Skull"" relies on Indiana's skills, it takes us to places that actually could exist, and builds a mythology that is real.  We were not overwhelmed with CGI or great effects, these were the days of stuntmen and real explosions - this was made during a time where realism took precedence over computer.  Yet, isn't that the mantra of Indiana?  Isn't the idea of this film to inspire youthful minds to become archaeologists, to make them aware that modern technology could take a backseat to a fedora and/or whip any day?  There is this classic nature of both this character, but of the way Ford portrays him.  Ford gives us this hero that is literally an everyman - he bleeds, he has fears, he punches when he should run - these are all great relatable features that still makes Ford's Indiana Jones so iconic.  The costume works, but it is the level of strength that Ford brings that makes me replay my VHS over and over.

What else makes ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" perfect?  The Nazi element, the idea that Hitler was searching for more than just total world domination was brilliant.  Lucas and Spielberg took a trusted villain, a villain from the classic radio era, and made him search all over the world for this Ark of the Covenant.  The spiritual element within this film is not overbearing, mostly explained, and it again gives us a task that may not be too out of reach for the average viewer.  Watching it today, older, wiser, and somewhat more film skilled, I loved learning that Karen Allen could drink like it was her job.  I never did catch the romantic twist forming between Belloq and Allen, but it seemed more relevant as I am older.  Our man Dietrich was both hysterical and utterly evil; one of my favorite scenes was when he tricks us into hanging his coat.  Brilliant.  Proving again that ""Raiders"" takes you on this journey, a journey that could have been stale and caper-ish, and delivers a story that seems bold, refreshing, and new each time that you watch it - no matter what age you are.

""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is a timeless film.  I cannot wait to watch it again - every element from the design, to the characters, to the finale is perfect.  Despite the passion that I have for the VHS version, the DVD does thankfully make this film more accessible to the modern masses.  This was created during the time where Ford was making skilled movies, a trait that he seems to have forgotten today.  Do not watch this series backward, do not begin with ""Crystal Skull"" and expect ""Raiders"" to be the same.  It is a retro film, a film about using skills sans computers.  It is near perfection from everyone filming, writing, and acting within it.  I would recommend this film to anyone looking for creativity, excitement, and/or a time where cinema was fun.

The action scenes are varied, from fist fights to battles with snakes, to dodging airplane propellers, guns, knives, poison dates, fires, supernatural plague-type winds, chases through city streets, caves, mountains....you name it, it's all in here.

The music can get too loud, the action too much, Karen Allen's mouth too profane; the credibility too much to believe, the theology too weird, etc, but no one can deny this is a fun ride all the way through. You take none of it seriously and just enjoy the adventure.

Coming on the heels of Star Wars, this really made Harrison Ford a mega-star. It didn't do much for the rest of the cast but it sure boosted Ford's stock.

Henry Jones, Jr. is an archaeologist, and an unmatched thrill-seeker. Harrison Ford's hero is a perfect mixture of intelligence and action. The film would be worth seeing if only for the opening prologue where Indy tracks down a golden idol in a secret cavern guarded by tarantulas, spear-hurling booby traps, giant rolling boulders and poison dart shooting hovitos.  In this scene watch for an early appearance by the talented English actor Alfred Molina as South American guide Satipo.

This opening scene is used to introduce Indy and his nemesis, French archaeologist Belloq (played by Paul Freeman), as well as Dr. Jones' dislike for snakes.

We next see Indy lecturing a room of star-struck co-eds in archaeology before colleague Marcus Brody (played by Denholm Elliot) drags Indy to a secret meeting with Army intelligence officers.  Secret messages intercepted from the Nazi's show that Hitler has sent a massive archaeological team outside of Cairo to attempt to recover the biblical Ark of the Covenant.  This scene is a piece of genius exposition, explaining a little of the history of the Ark and its location that sets up the rest of the movie, and at the same time adding the ominous warning that ""an army carrying the Ark of the Covenant before it is invincible"".

We meet Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, a former girlfriend with an important piece of the puzzle, and John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, an Egyptian archaeologist who has worked with Indiana before.

The movie is an absolute roller-coaster, with our hero dodging one near-death experience after another, but the thing that makes ""Raiders"" superior to the Indiana movies that followed is the perfect balance of witty derring-do and realistic humanity embodied in Harrison Ford's portrayal.  The AARP aged Indy in the recent ""Crystal Skull"" takes a beating without flinching, but the Indiana of the first movie makes you believe it HURTS to be drug behind a truck or punched by a 250 pound Nazi sergeant.

The climactic scene leaves no doubt who ""the good guys"" are, and the ending allows us to catch our breath before the credits roll.  Not intended to be a film of academic minutiae, it is nonetheless a perfect combination of action, romance and film smarts.

Movies simply don't come better than ""Raiders"".",1235088000,,2996,5.501089324618737
134955,5,0792158202,"In 1981, it wasn't obvious that an A-movie that is a pastiche of old B-movies could take the top spot at the box office and inspire a franchise that is still profitable 27 years later. But ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" did just that. Set in 1936, as the industrial world moves closer to war, and parts of the third world are still unexplored, archeologist and ""obtainer of rare antiquities"" Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) scours the globe for treasures of civilizations past. His talent for extracting long-lost artifacts under perilous circumstances attracts the attention of United States Military Intelligence. Nazi Germany has taken an interest in the reputed power of the Ark of the Covenant, which held the original Ten Commandments, and the US would like Dr. Jones to find it before the Nazis do. First, Jones must find his old flame Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), daughter of the man who was in possession of a medallion with clues to the Ark's location.

These days, the only filmmaker who makes big-budget tributes to low-budget genre films is Quentin Tarantino. But his films are often self-conscious comments upon the exploitation films that inspired them. In the 1970s and early 1980s, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg did something similar but less cerebral. They make movies that updated and upgraded low-budget genre films but with essentially the same intention as the original films. Post-War sci-fi flicks inspired George Lucas' ""Star Wars"" trilogy. Steven Spielberg upgraded youth-oriented exploitation films to make ""Jaws"". And Spielberg and Lucas together wrought ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" from adventure serials of the 1930s-1940s, with their dependence of cliffhangers, damsels in distress, and intrepid adventures in exotic locales. ""Raiders"" rounds it out with an evil, sadistic Nazi, Maj. Toht (Ronald Lacey). and a clever, cultured, but squeamish French rival, Dr. Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman).

""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" turned out better than its creators expected. Audiences didn't interpret it as a send-up or tribute to earlier films. They embraced it as a rip-roaring action-adventure with great style and humor. It had just the right mix of clich and freshness, and it takes its characters seriously, if not its plot. Marion is a damsel in distress, but a tomboy. The action sequences are creative and well-paced. A lot of credit goes to Harrison Ford for bringing an unselfconscious humor to the film (and to ""Star Wars"" as well) that endears Indy to everyone. It achieves the right balance of exoticism and down-to-earth. Indy's skepticism of the supernatural plays much better than his acceptance of it does in the sequels. It's no wonder there were so many adventure stories in the first half of 20th century. It was a time when amateur explorers were mapping the globe, always discovering new things. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" captured the romanticism of that for another era, and it still does.

The DVD (Paramount 2008 Special Edition): There are 3 featurettes, 4 image galleries, and trailer and demo (PC only) for a Lego Indiana Jones Original Adventures Game. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark: An Introduction"" (8 min) features Spielberg and Lucas talking (recently) about how the film was conceived and brought in under time and on budget, including some archival footage. ""Indiana Jones: An Appreciation"" (12 min) interviews the cast and creative crew of the 4th Indiana Jones movie, ""The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"", about their experiences making or seeing ""Raiders"" in 1981. In ""The Melting Face!"" (8 min), Chris Walas explains how he created Toht's melting face, including footage of the procedure. That is the only bonus feature that is worthwhile. I remember seeing several documentaries about the making of ""Raiders"" in the 1980s, particularly about the stunts, but this disc doesn't include anything like that, which will be a disappointment to fans.

He smiles everytime he meets them. Indy always comes prepared (his weapons.) He's got his famous whip, his machete and his pistol. Everytime he goes to a far-away place, he learns something. For example, Myths, Religions, Legends and Lanquages. He's very good with speaking to people from cultures. While Indy's running and stopping the bad guys, he falls back in love with Marion and saves her life more than twice. Even though she did have a plan on her own, it didn't work because of Toht and Rene Belloq. And his BIGGEST fear of them all is SNAKES! He really hates snakes. He can't stand being in the same room with them. Hey! I don't blame him. But, apart from all of that, he knows how to get the job done, even if it means feeling the wrath of the ARK. Never open your eyes, keep them shut when the lid is open. That's what the bad guys messed up on.

134971,4,0792158202,"Due to the recent release of the fourth installment, ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"", in the long-time trilogy, now turned ongoing ""Indiana Jones"" series; I felt the need to go back and re-watch all the classic original films that started this whole franchise. Without further ado, let us begin with the 1981 adventure flick that made Harrison Ford even more of a household name, with his second most iconic character's first film, ""Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark"".

""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (as it was known when initially released to theaters) follows the adventures of Dr. Henry ""Indiana"" Jones, Jr. (Harrison Ford), an archaeology professor/tomb raider. After being contacted by members of the U.S. government concerning a former colleague's connection to the Nazis and Hitler's interest in all things related to the occult, Indy embarks upon a quest to discover the powerful Ark of the Covenant before the evil Nazis can get their hands on it. To do so, Indy must ally himself with a former love, Marian Ravenwood (Karen Allen), who fully lives up to the phrase ""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned"", and do his best to keep both of them alive as their harrowing journey takes them from South America to the streets of Cairo, and beyond.

Many movie fans have long held ""Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark"" in extremely high regard as being one of the all-time classics of American cinema, along with being heralded as the best in the ""Indiana Jones"" series. I agree with the first half of the statement, but I beg to differ on the latter. Although I do enjoy ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", I do feel that in the early stages of the movie, the story seems to struggle to find its footing. This results in some rather uneven pacing problems in the first 30 to 45 minutes of the film. While the lulls in the story are never so problematic that the movie begins to truly suffer for it, these moments do tend to draw some attention and caused me to become a bit restless early on. That being said, all the minor problems were fully taken care of by the 45 minute to 1 hour mark, when the movie really kicked into gear and the pace began moving along at a very steady clip; but without going so fast as to make the early parts feel too out of place.

I think my biggest problem with the story for ""Raiders"", is that early on in the movie there seems to be so much backstory between Indy and Marion, and while it is dealt with to an extent, it never quite seems to get the attention it deserves. I mean, this woman clearly despises this man for something he's done in the past, yet she seems more than willing to let bygones be bygones. And she does so in a manner that makes her anger in the beginning seem immature and irrational. Now, I will be honest that I'm a little at odds with myself on my viewpoint for this aspect of the story. On the one hand, I wish that they would have fleshed out the history between Indy and Marion a little further to justify her intense anger for him; while on the other hand, I'm glad they didn't because this was the very portion of the story that I felt caused the movie to seem uneven. So, I guess I can't have it both ways, but the resulting conundrum regarding this part of the film is most likely the primary reason for why this movie doesn't rank as the best in the series for me, unlike most other fans of the ""Indiana Jones"" franchise.

From an acting standpoint the movie is very solid across the board. Harrison Ford (""Star Wars"" original trilogy) creates another classically heroic, yet flawed character for audiences to easily relate to. Harrison provided Indy with a dry wit, intelligence, and strength that allowed audiences to embrace more of a thinking man's hero that still knows how to handle himself in a fight, without resorting to the typical one-dimensional action hero that one would normally find in these types of movies. Karen Allen (""Starman"") is nearly perfect as the fiery ex-girlfriend of Indiana Jones, while she ultimately becomes the typical damsel-in-distress this kind of movie requires; she proves herself to be quite capable of handling herself in minor fights and drinking games as well. The only problem I had with Karen in this movie, aside from her seemingly irrational disdain for Indy early on, was that at times her line readings seem a bit forced. I don't know if this was due to rewrites of the script during the filming or what, perhaps it was just nerves; whatever the case may be, her performance just didn't seem to be consistent all the way through the movie. Serving as Indy's go-to-guy in Cairo, named Sallah, we have actor John Rhys-Davies (""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy), who delivers the majority of the comedic moments for the film; while still getting to see his fair share of adventure during his stint in the story. For the most part, the majority of the cast created some very memorable characters, all of which were entertaining and interesting; two qualities that are sometimes hard to come by in these types of films, where the characters usually tend to be a bit more one-dimensional.

With this movie being 27 years old, I find myself surprised by some of the bold stunts that director Steven Spielberg (""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"") and his producer/co-creator of the story George Lucas (""Star Wars"" saga) dared to accomplish in the film. The boulder chasing Indy in the opening moments of the movie, and the scenes at the end involving the Ark of the Covenant are exceptional works of movie magic. The fact that these two sequences, along with a few others, still look as good as they do even to this day is amazing to me; while at the same time, serving as a fitting tribute to the talent and ingenuity that these two men and the many individuals in their employ, that help to make this magic happen, have at their disposal to take audiences on an adventure that they'll not soon forget.

When all is said and done, ""Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is an incredibly fun movie to watch. While it does have some problems during the first half of the movie, overall it's a film that stands strong on its own and kicks off one of the greatest adventure series' in cinematic history.

134974,4,0792158202,"""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is universally considered to be an extremely entertaining action/adventure movie, so I won't waste your time reviewing the film itself. If you've already seen it, you know it's awesome; if you haven't... well, to quote Indiana Jones himself: ""Trust me."" It actually does live up to the hype. What's truly important for those thinking about purchasing this ""special edition,"" however, is a discussion of the bonus material.

The extras on this disc definitely do NOT warrant purchasing this edition if you already own the previously-released Indy Trilogy DVD set. The extras can basically be summed up in a word: ""meh."" Each of the handful of featurettes is around 10 minutes or less, and there are no surprises. Some brief ""making-of"" clips from the filming of ""Raiders"" are semi-interesting, but are all very short. Another featurette is just a bunch of actors from the series making bland comments about how great Indiana Jones is, set to overly-familiar clips from the various movies (Watch Indy run from the giant ball! Now watch him shoot the swordsman!). The endless repetition of clips from the movie is one of the tiresome aspects of DVD bonus material, and serves mainly to make you so sick of the film that you don't want to see it again for awhile!

The best featurette is the one about how they did the ""melting face,"" but even this is short and, really, no great shakes. Next is the apparently mandatory ""for interest to fanatics only"" stuff like storyboards and a gallery of production stills. Finally, there's a brief commercial for the Lego Indiana Jones video game, which actually (and tellingly) is one of the more entertaining of the extras.

Considering the importance and success of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" and the fact that it's being sold as a stand-alone ""special edition"" after having long been available as part of a trilogy set, the overall paltriness of the bonus features is a letdown. The extensive, well-produced extras on George Lucas's ""Star Wars"" prequel DVD's, with lengthy, thoughtful featurettes and deleted scenes, should have been the model followed here. Instead, it seems like Lucas and company were more interested in cashing in on ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" hoopla (a trailer for this latest sequel plays automatically before the main menu pops up) rather than rewarding loyal fans with something definitive and satisfying.

The score and sound effects are very loud compared to the dialog. In fact, in many places its hard to hear what the characters are saying unless you really turn up the sound (but then the score is super loud, and that is quite irritating).

I purchased this DVD after watching Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. I was a little disappointed by it (it was okay, but not as good as the previous 3), however, my girl friend really enjoyed it. Though she also admitted to me that she had not seen the previous Indiana Jones movies. So I felt like it'd be fun to do a movie night where we saw the original.

I picked this DVD up figuring it'd be the definitive version. The picture is wonderful and the movie itself is a thrill to watch. However, several times during the movie we found ourselves saying ""what did that person just say?"" The music and sound effects were very loud and prominent, however the dialog wasn't. We had to turn the volume way up, to the point where when the music kicked in or certain sound effects (like thunder) occurred, they were annoyingly loud.

We actually stopped the movie twice and fiddled around with the settings on her TV. At one point we even restarted the DVD and checked the options menu to see if there was some kind of setting for normal sound - there wasn't. She told me no other DVD had this problem. So I'm assuming they've mixed the sound like this on purpose, which I find to be extremely annoying. I wish they would have just left it alone or made it so someone could watch the movie with normal sound.

As it is, I'm unhappy with this purchase and can't see myself watching this version again.",1214697600,20,1817,4.351032448377581

134992,5,0792158202,"So much has been said about this film and I suppose that my two cents' worth won't really amount to much, but I just had to drop a line about one of my favorite films. With the release of ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"", I recently revisted my DVD copy of this classic film (along with ""Temple of Doom"" and ""Last Crusade"").

""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (the actual title before they stuck the ""Indiana Jones and the"" prefix onto it) was released in a ""golden age"" of sorts of movie making. George Lucas, the mastermind behind the revolutionary ""Star Wars"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" films and fellow movie maker Steven Spielberg, the man responsible for ""Jaws"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", had both established themselves in the annals of film making history with their immensely popular movies. When word spread that these two titans of the industry were teaming up to create a film together, Hollywood was all abuzz and expectations were high. Needless to say, they delivered in a big way.

In a time when movies were making a comeback (Spielberg and Lucas were both responsible in creating the ""summer blockbuster"" - prior to the late '70s, summertime was considered the slow season), the two directors decided to hearken back to the days of movie serials, sometimes called chapter plays, and created a tale of high adventure.

This movie was so unlike anything that had been done before. The special effects were ""old school"" (long before CGI) and gave a gritty realism to the whole look and feel of the film. The action was second to none, the story pulled you in, and the film helped further the career of the now-legendary Harrison Ford.

I will not compare this to ""Crystal Skull"", but suffice it to say that this film never grows tiresome. It is forever ingrained in American culture (Indy's brown fedora and bullwhip are icons in and of themselves and forever attached to the character).

If you've never seen it (either because you are too young or been living under a rock), please do yourself a favor and watch this film. You will thoroughly enjoy it.",1213747200,,2077,4.710743801652892

The two had formed a friendship earlier and decided to collaborate on their next project. Lucas had wanted to make a film about an adventurer/archaeologist who hunts down supernatural relics while being pursued by dastardly villains. The concept was inspired by Old Republic adventure serials, the Doc Savage pulp magazines and the film King Solomon's Mines. However he had not been able to get that project off the ground. Meanwhile Spielberg was trying to get involved on a James Bond film. Ultimately Spielberg and Lucas got together and agreed that he'd direct Lucas' adventure story. The two hired Lawrence Kasdan to write the screenplay. Thus Indiana Jones was born.

The film's first scene opens on a majestic mountain range where the silhouette of a man in a leather jacket and a hat steps into view. His name is Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford). He's leading a small party of explorers through the jungles of South America. After most of his group is frightened off, only three remain; Indiana, Satipo the guide, and a mysterious man whose reason for joining their group is never fully known. Indiana Jones removes an antiquated map from his well-worn leather jacket while behind him the third man raises his gun and prepares to shoot. But quickly Indy spins around, unfurling a bullwhip with which he skillfully disarms the man with his gun. The cowardly man runs off. Indy and Satipo head into the mouth of an ancient cave. This is just the beginning of Indiana's greatest adventure in which he faces and overcomes many obstacles only to be confronted with newer and more perilous ones. By the time the film is over he's survived collapsing temples, dodged poisoned darts, outrun a giant boulder, escaped an ancient crypt filled with thousands of snakes, and recovered the Lost Ark of the Covenant from the hands of Nazis. Along the way he's reunited with his former love Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), his Egyptian friend Sallah (John Rhys-Davies), and rival archaeologist Belloq (Paul Freeman) and the sadistic Nazi agent Toht (Ronald Lacey). Other cast members include Denholm Elliott as Marcus Brody, Alfred Molina as Satipo, and Pat Roach as a pugilistic German mechanic.

There are many reasons that Raiders was such a success. It had a brilliant director (Spielberg), a savvy creator/producer (Lucas), a great score composed by John Williams and an amazing cast. But what's made it a classic is the pure unadulterated sense of fun that can only be found in a pulp adventure.

He's also a teacher at a local college in his town, his friend Marcus (Denholm Elliot) tells him that the Nazis are after a special religious artifact called ""The Ark of Convent"" for they believe it can give Hitler's armies special powers. They head to the Middle East where the former love of his life Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) is and they team up together to stop the Nazi's diabolical plan.

This is the one that started it all folks! spawned three damn good sequels and a bunch of wannabes, this is one of the most original and unique movies of all time. It's the one movie that has captured the imagination of both audiences and critics alike since it's release in 1981, thanks to the creative geniuses of Steven Spielburg and George Lucas. They have created a masterpiece that stands the test of time, it's just as great as ""Star Wars"" and also co-stars Jonathan Rhys-Davis whom you remember from the Lord of the Rings. The story came from an idea by George Lucas and the film was directed by Spielburg, i love how they casted Harrison Ford for Indy instead of Tom Selleck cause Ford IS Jones afterall! the performances are flawless, the action, romance, humor, special effects and memorable music score by John Williams are all fantastic.

This DVD contains excellent picture and sound by THX and good extras include an introduction to the movie by Spielburg and Lucas, A DVD-rom demo of ""Lego Indiana Jones"", photo galleries and three featurettes. This is a masterpiece that should be owned by everyone.",1213142400,,1708,4.747474747474747
134995,4,0792158202,"Although it would be difficult to describe as a masterpiece, THE RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK is easily one of the most beloved films of its era--and has proven unexpectedly influential, spawning three other related films and laying the ground work for such fanciful, action-heavy, and hero-driven films as DIE HARD and NATIONAL TREASURE.  Not bad for a film that few expected to do much in the way of box office when first released!

The story is famous and as such needs only a bare description here.  Set in pre-World War II 1930s, RAIDERS finds archeologist-adventurer Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) pitted against the Nazis in a search for the lost Ark of the Covenant.  In order to locate the Ark, Jones must obtain an artifact from former lover Marion (Karen Allen), who demands to be included in the search.  Created by George Lucas and Stephen Spiellberg as an homage to 1940s and 1950s serials (SPY SMASHER, JUNGLE GIRL, THE DRUMS OF FU MANCHU, THE PHANTOM, and THE CRIMSON GHOST come to mind), the set pieces are spectacular: South American booby traps; exploding airplanes; elaborate fist fights and chase sequences; one right after another and piled on top of each other with a rapid pace.

But special effects and flashy action aren't enough to keep a film fondly remembered for close to thirty years.  Unlike many other similar films, RAIDERS actually has a sense of humanity--and it owes much of that to leads Harrison Ford and Karen Allen.  Their situations might be wildly improbable, but they themselves are not, and whether it be action, comedy, or romance the two twinkle, sizzle, and strike sparks off the clever script and each other to tremendous effect.  They give the film heart.

That said, there isn't really much special about the so-called ""special edition"" DVD released in connection with the theatrical debut of the 2008 INDIAN JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL.  The picture has been cleaned up and the transfer is good, but the bonus materials are trivial, with only ""The Mystery of the Melting Face"" of any real interest.  A pity: if ever a film was ripe for a double disk release with audio tracks and detailed making-of documentaries, it is one, which remains the best in the popular series.

What the wizard of oz and gone with the wind is for an older generation,this movie is to me and most of mine( I would dare say).Running fun from start to finish,the action is always there. The native indians of Peru,the love crazy students at Marshall university and the nazis....of course the nazis,this movie has it all,and all the more for the fans of Indy.adventure,excitement(yoda won't like it though),love...I can't remember the last movie that had this much clean fun for the whole family to enjoy. I couldn't pin point one favorite part of the movie because the whole movie is great. One of my favorite scenes,though,is the opening sequence at the temple in the jungles of Peru. Little by little we get introduced to our hero,and then the action starts! The chase across the jungle,the wonderful flying sequence with the aid of the red line on the map! The fight in Marion's bar and her rescue. Digging in the desert to find the well of souls,those snakes! The drinking game between Marion and Rene. The fight on top of the plane. One of the best parts in the movie,the truck scene. Indy sliding under the running truck with help from his whip! The action is almost non-stop and breath taking. It's to bad there aren't adventures like this to be found in these modern times,WOW!I love raiders of the lost ark the best of the three,although the other two are good also. This motion picture will make you glad to be a movie fan again! I can't wait for my nephews to get old enough so they can watch it for the first time! Who dosen't like Indy and his adventures?This is a real gift from Lucas and Spielberg...Thank you,like Indy says....He was good,he was very very good!",1212451200,,1727,4.592233009708738

The expectations were high when George Lucas and Steven Spielberg got together to make this movie.  They set the bar a couple of notches higher with this film.

What boy or man hasn't dreamed of finding lost treasure?  And what girl or woman hasn't dreamed of a dark mysterious man who literally sweeps her off her feet and takes her for an adventure she never forgets.

From the opening scene where Indiana Jones finds a small gold statue and almost gets crushed by a giant bolder to finding of the lost arc of the covenant we follow our hero and his romantic interest through caves, tombs and wild car chases that rival any movie ever done.

Harrison Ford is exceptional as the hero who thrives on adventure. His quick mind and Critical Thinking skills get him out of many a tight situation throughout the movie. A boy at heart with the knowledge as deep as the tombs he explores.  One minute he is teaching a class in archeology.  The next minute he is being dragged under a truck in the desert.  As he says in one telling line to Marion ""It's not the years, it's the miles!""

Karen Allen plays the heroine Marion with the right mix of spunk, sexiness and the girl next door look that men desire. She can take care of herself in tough situation, but has a kind and vulnerable side as well.  Her unwilling attraction to our hero provides the sparks for romance and arguments that make the movie just plain fun!

Overall this is the ""Gold Standard"" for action adventure movies!

135009,5,0792158202,"Whether a person likes the results or not, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas revolutionized the movie industry as seen in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.  Supposedly while vacationing in Hawaii in 1977 to avoid the hoopla of the opening of STAR WARS, George Lucas discussed with his good friend Steven Spielberg the idea of making an action adventure movie similar to the Republic action adventure serials and Scrooge McDuck comics of their youth.  Thus the idea of Indiana Jones was born.

RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK was a throwback to the adventure serials of the 1950s, but it was also a great deal more.  The film is an excellent example of one of the Steven Spielberg's great gifts: taking pieces of nostalgia and unifying them into a tapestry of cinematic wonder for more amazing, entertaining, and complex than the sum of its parts.  RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK introduced the world to Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), a professor, archaeologist, and finder of rare antiquities.  Jones is hired by the U.S. government to find the Biblical Ark of the Covenant and retrieve it before the Nazis get it and deliver it to Hitler.  The quest takes Indy to Nepal and Egypt and eventually to an unnamed island in the Mediterranean Sea.  Along the way Indy meets back up with the love of his life, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen); gets in a bar fight; is trapped in a buried tomb with all kinds of snakes; finds the Ark; loses the Ark; finds the Ark again; and eventually looses it again.

Full of adventure, action, and a little bit of romance; masterly directed; and wonderfully acted, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK is a movie that everyone should see in their life at least once.",1211673600,,1657,4.666666666666667

I'm still watching my laser disk version and won't give it up untill a ""made for 16x9 TVs"" version comes out in a 1.78 aspect ratio.",1211500800,,490,4.114583333333333
135011,5,0792158202,"Of course, I had to get the disks out and see this film before #4 comes out this weekend.  I wasn't sure it'd stand the test of time..so many do not.  I'm pleased to say, I enjoyed this film every bit as much as I did in the theatre when I first saw it.

Plot summary in a nutshell:  Dr. Indiana Jones (Ford) lives a double life as a bespectacled professor of Archeology, but when he gets the call, he'll go out into the field.

Now for most archeologists, that means taking a bunch of grad students out and doing a dig.  For Indy, that's running breathlessly ahead of someone else for an artifact he's trying to acquire.  In this case, he's been hired by the US Government to stop arch-nemesis Dr. Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman) from securing the Ark of the Covenant for the Nazis, who will use the artifact to power their ambitions.

Harrison Ford is exceptional as the dual natured hero.  He delivers his lines with worldly wisdom and droll wit.  His sidekicks: Karen Allen, who plays a jilted former sweetheart; Denholm Elliott, a museum curator who often uses Indy as his procurer; and John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, are perfect foils.

One of the best parts of the film is the soundtrack.  Can anyone hear the opening bars of John Williams' theme without thinking of the film?  The Maetro has done some amazing work, but ""Raiders of the Last Ark"" will stand out for me as one of my favorites.

One quote that stood out for me was when Indiana said, ""It's not the years, honey, it's the mileage.""  Well, for having so many years and miles, ""Raiders"" is still a primo vehicle for Harrison Ford and the rest of its cast.

I didn't want the stench of ""Temple of Doom"" infecting my collection.  I grew up with seven sisters and a brother eight years my junior.  The summer of '81 I was about to enter Temple(of Doom?) University.  Traditionally, I took my brother to the movies for his birthday whether it be ""Star Wars"", ""Superman"", or ""Ghostbusters"".  My brother wasn't too eager to go this year maybe because I pulled his leg and told him we were seeing ""First Monday in October"" with Walter Matthau and Jill Clayburgh.  Anyway, we took the train to downtown Philly when they used to have tons of cinemas.  After disembarking from the train I was accosted by a religious cult.  Being skinny with glasses and pimples must have signalled fresh meat to them.  I wasn't buying because the idea of going door-to-door selling peanut brittle and dead flowers didn't appeal to me.  Anyway, ""Raiders"" was playing at one of those old movie palaces, The Sameric, with 2000 seats and a balcony with widescreen and Dolby sound.  We were wowed.  I think I must have seen it 8 or 9 more times.  Back then movies would play in theatres for months because there were no VCRs, DVD players, or downloading.  What's this all have to do with ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""?  Very little.  Movies like this breed their own chat rooms so there's really little original to say that hasn't been said.

135028,4,0792158202,"The details of new DVD editions of the three classic classic Indiana Jones movies with all-new special features have been announced.  They'll be available separately for the first time on DVD, or as a set.  They were previously only available on DVD as a set.

The new releases will coincide with the new movie, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which comes out on May 22nd.  They'll have new special features designed to introduce new Indy fans to the old movies, and to introduce old fans to the new movie.

The Indiana Jones movies are George Lucas's recreation/update of the serialized adventures of the 1930s and '40s.  The first three were made in the '80s and set in the '30s.  They feature Harrison Ford as a mild-mannered archeology professor who moonlights as an adventurous seeker of priceless antiquities.  This takes him to exotic locations across the world, and gets him in some very tight spots of the kind that only a movie hero could get into, or out of.  He invariably finds himself opposed by dangerous men with evil plans for the powerful objects only he has the skills to recover.  There are elaborate set pieces with creepy critters, ancient traps, fights with weapons from bare hands to airplanes and tanks, and sometimes supernatural forces.  Along the way Jones manages to have some romance too.

Raiders was the first in the series.  In 1936, having barely survived an unsuccessful attempt to find (OK) and bring home (whoops!) an ancient idol from Peru, Indiana Jones is recruited in a race against the Nazis to recover the Ark of the Covenant (yes, the one mentioned in the Bible, but with lots of added mythology), which is reputed to have the power to make an army invincible.  The ark is located in the Well of Souls somewhere in Egypt; the key to the exact location is a medallion located, naturally, in a seedy lodge/bar in Nepal, in the possession of Indy's ex-lover.  All kinds of sparks fly, literal and metaphorical, as the pair, joined by another confederate in Egypt, use their knowledge of ancient myth and sheer bravado to work right under the noses of the Nazis to find the ark and remove it to safety.  Almost.  There are several reversals along the way, close escapes, a huge near-finale, and icky stuff--spiders and, especially, snakes, thousands of them, of which Indy unfortunately has a bit of a phobia.

Some of the more memorable moments are tinged with humor, if not outright hilarity.  Indy's reactions make the snakes as amusing as they are scary.  We see how to fight an expert swordsman, if you're in a hurry.  The way the Nazis got a copy of (half) the medallion is painfully funny.  The fate of the ark is a wry comment on Washington bureaucracy.

Raiders was an instant classic.  I'm sure there are people who don't like it, but I've never met any.  It's fine for most kids (PG violence and mild sexuality), and it's plenty smart enough for all but the most snooty adults.

The original title is just Raiders of the Lost Ark, which is preserved in the movie itself.  The longer title makes it easier to market as part of the franchise.

If you just want Raiders and don't want to wait until May, you could get a used copy of the old Raiders DVD (people sell them out of the sets).  The difference is in the extra features.  The bonuses from the old set are on their own disc, so what you get when you buy just the old Raiders DVD is pretty bare.  The new release, on the other hand, has the following, all new:

-- ""Raiders of the Lost Ark: An Introduction"" by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas

-- ""Indiana Jones: An Appreciation,"" in which the cast and crew of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull pay tribute to the original trilogy

-- ""The Melting Face,"" a recreation of the famous effect from the climactic scene that certainly left an impression on me (was new then), with Spielberg and Lucas on the evolution of visual effects and CGI

-- storyboards for ""The Well of Souls"" sequence

-- DVD galleries of illustrations, props, production stills and portraits, FX/Industrial Light and Magic stuff, and promotion/marketing materials

-- ""Lego Indiana Jones,"" a demo and trailer for a game based on the trilogy

If you like a few extras, you'll probably like this new DVD, though maybe not enough to upgrade from the old one, or to wait until May.  I like audio commentaries, myself, and since they're easy to produce and tend to bring out points not covered in other features, I subtract one star for a special edition without any, but I look forward to the rest.  If you don't care about commentaries, this may be a five-star DVD for you.

There have been rumors of deleted scenes, but none are included.

Some will want to wait for a high-def release, which may make sense if you have the equipment or plan to get it.  Many speculate that a Blu-ray release will come out for Christmas, but that's guesswork.

There's also some speculation that an edition with all four movies will be released for Christmas.  They may bundle the four together, but I doubt that there will be a better edition of this movie soon, if ever, on standard DVD.  Keep in mind that the previous set came out over four years ago, and if not for the new movie, that would probably be the only release during the decade of standard DVD.  The next upgrade may be high-def only, and may not happen for a while.

135032,5,0792158202,"While it may have been the role of Hans Solo in `Star Wars' that planted the name of Harrison Ford within the collective consciousness of the American (and world for that matter) public, it was his portrayal of the adventurous Indiana Jones in the '81 blockbuster `Raiders of the Lost Ark' that made him the iconic film legend he is today.

The first of three epic adventures, `Raiders of the Lost Ark' is in my estimation the best of the series so far (a fourth is now in production so who knows). If this is your genre of entertainment you have found your pot-of-gold. Amazing special effects, superb cast, an unforgettable soundtrack and a script and storyline overflowing with clever, quotable dialogue and heavy supernatural undertones that are absolutely mesmerizing.

Simply the ""Best of the Best!",1201132800,4,804,4.904411764705882
135033,5,0792158202,"Hollywood, Universal Studios, movie heroes, and modern classics - when these are mentioned, somewhere in the mix is the scene we have all viewed at some point or another - the archaeologist dressed as a lion tamer running from the huge rolling ball.  Harrison Ford, along with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, have done more than bring us a fantastic action/adventure that truly entertains, but they have created something that has gone down in cinematic history as a cultural movie icon - the creation of one of the greatest on screen heroes of all time - Indiana Jones.  If you have never seen Raiders of the Lost Ark, you are missing arguably not just perhaps the best Indiana Jones movie, but one of the best modern classic films ever to hit the big screen.

Indiana Jones is almost like James Bond in a sense - he is smooth, inventive, tough, cool with the ladies, and visits the most exotic of locations - perhaps even more exotic than what Bond is used to.  Armed with a gun and bare fists, its the whip that has become the trademark for Indiana Jones.  It's something that could come off as silly, but it worked so well, and it appears that nobody else dares to take the risk of copying in other films out there.

The hero isn't the only thing that makes this film work so well, it's the artificats.  The very beginning of Raiders is extremely engaging, pitting Indiana and some of his ""not so loyal buddies"" into a South American cave occupied by booby traps and big spiders.  The artifact Indiana is seeking is a golden head, but it's just an opener for what is yet to come - The Ark of the Covenant - and I can't think of any greater artifact one could want.  Historical information is shed on the Ark throughout the film, and to make matters very intense, Indiana's nemesis ""Beloch"" and his Nazi allies want the ark for themselves.  It becomes an all out war between both parties, filled with incredible action and adventure.

As a whole, Raiders is amazing entertainment.  It has a wonderful story, highly memorable characters, romance, action, adventure, archaeology, and teriffic pacing.  I don't think there is one scene in this movie that is not interesting.  Probably some of the best things about Raiders is the action and the characters.  The fights are memorable such as Indy vs the big Nazi guy, and the incredible truck chase scene that follows.  The characters deliver lines one after another that fans will (and do) quote for times to come.  If that's not enough to satisy, the story is so much fun and engaging as well.

I think everyone loves this movie, no matter who you are.  This is the kind of movie that goes beyond what kind of genre film you enjoy, its easily in a list of some of the best films of all time that are must see.

135034,5,0792158202,"Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) doesn't just teach about archeology.  When the right opportunity comes up, he goes in search of the lost ancient treasures of the world.  And he specializes in the supernatural and occult.

That's why he gets approached by the US government to go in search of the ancient Ark of the Covenant.  They have received intelligence that the Nazis have located its probably burial place.  And, while we aren't at war with them yet (it is 1936), we don't want that power to fall into their hands.

And so, Jones is off to Egypt to beat them to the ark.  But first, he has to stop in Nepal to get a needed item from Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), his ex-girlfriend and the daughter of his mentor.  When the Nazis show up at the same time, Marion decides to go with Jones.

But the danger has just begun.  Can Indiana Jones find the ark before the Nazis?  If so, can he steal it away under their very noses?

This is a wonderful pop corn flick.  It's got lots of action to keep everyone on the edge of their seats.  Yet the story is decent and holds together well.  And the characters, brought to life by great acting, are more then the cardboard cut outs you normally associate with the genre.  The special effects at times to betray the movie's age, but they are minor.

What surprises me more is the film's rating.  While originally rated PG, I think it belongs in the PG-13 category.  Some of those images are rather gruesome and the violence can get graphic.  Of course, back when this film was releases, PG-13 wasn't an option.  Still, parents will definitely want to preview this movie before they let their kids see it.

This movie has many imitators, and some of them are very fun.  But it's hard to top the original if you are looking for a great action flick.",1192752000,5,1791,4.443076923076923

The sacred and dangerous Ark gets bounced around here and there and so does Jones.

This film has it all -- the flavour of an old-time Saturday matinee cliffhanger serial, but also offering superb color cinematogragraphy, incredible sets, perfect casting, and on and on. I can hardly say enough good about it.

If I have an issue, it's that you apparently have to buy the Indiana Jones Boxed set (3 movies) to get this one in the Region 1 release. So that's sort of a stinky bummer. The other two movies are okay, but not of the caliber of this one.

  First movie in the series.

It is 1936. Archaeologist-Professor Indiana Jones is in the jungle of Peru looking for a temple. His guides are Barranca (Vic Tablian) and Satipo (Alfred Molina). Indy certainly has a good sense of direction and he knows where he is going. Indy has an old, weathered map to help him find the temple. Suddenly, Barranca pulls a gun on him, but Indy is quick with his whip and the gun falls in the water. The guide runs away. Indy finds the temple and inside it is booby-trapped. Indy is very knowledgeable and skilled. He made it alive past the traps. He finds the golden idol. He gets it and it starts another booby-trap. Indy can't get across the wide space in the stone floor. He throws the idol to Satipo for the whip, whom double-crosses him, drops the whip and runs with the idol.  Indy makes it across and runs to the entrance only to find Satipo has been killed by the shooting darts. Just then, a giant ball of stone rolls fast towards Indy. He is running as fast as he can with the idol so that he doesn't get crushed. At the entrance, the Hovito natives are holding their arrows at Indy. They have killed Barranca. Belloq (Paul Freeman) demands Indy hand over the golden idol to him. Indy does and decides to save his life and runs through the jungle. The natives are chasing after him. A pilot and a float plane are waiting for Indy.
  Now back at Marshall College, Indy gets an offer to go to the ancient city of Tanis in Egypt to find the Staff of Ra and to find the Ark of the Covenant, a gold-covered wooden chest that contained the two stone tablets of The Ten Commandments given by Moses.

Well with these movies its the same, you Just can't stop watching them... everybody can enjoy the movie's. You probably wouldn't let your kids watch the jones for a while becuase of there violence and gore. But actually, I saw them when I was a 7 year old boy. And you know what, I loved them! Personaly my favorite is the last one.

I can't stop watching them, one time i watched all of them... twice in one day! If you havn't seen them, your missing out on somthing huge!

In the second instllment, indiana jones and the temple of doom: Indy has crashed into India, where a tribe is missing something very sacred to them! the tribe suggests that a tribe of evil has stolen it! So indy finds himself in bind, becuase the only way indy id getting back home is to find that rock! Watch as indy and his two companions try come out of all this mess, alive!

Watch as indy struggles to: run away from nazis, try to save his fathers life, and find the holy grail and accomplish the three tasks that that lead him to it!

Chaos and mayhem ensues.

Indiana must face snakes, traps, spiders, the Nazis, and the ark itself on an adventure like no other.

The plot is simple-Hitler's men have discovered Tanice (not sure how its spelled), ""one of the possible resting places of the Lost Ark.""  Indiana Jones, also known to his peers as ""Indy"", is hired to recover the Ark.  The only problem is that Indy has to duke it out with some very nasty Nazis in order to successfully recover the ancient artifact.  The Nazis are assisted by a French archaeologist named Beloch (not sure how that's spelled either) who can be considered Indy's archrival.  If Jones is to succeed, he must use all his strength and wit to thwart his adversaries, whether they be gun-toting Nazis, sword-wielding Arabs or deadly snakes.  Throw in a great (and I mean GREAT) musical score by John Williams, a charismatic hero (Harrison Ford really delivers in the role of Indy) and some pretty darn good special effects, and the result is a movie for the ages!

 Set in the Dust Bowl year of 1936 Indiana Jones is a world archaeologist who is on the quest of recovering an ancient Artifact called the Lost Ark from a remote tribe in Amazonian Brazil but the ark is being persued by rival archaeologists who are trying to gain a hold of it and turn it over the German Nazi-forces who plan on using to completely take over the world and now with the help of a vixen bartender named Marion Ravenwood, Indie and Marion must recover the ARk and prevent the Nazis from gaining power from the Ark.

 This movie is just utterly amazing and has aged so well even after 23 years since it's release back in 1981. The special effects especially by 1981 standards are amazing and hardly look dated. The acting is awesome especially by Harrison Ford as he shows the emotional vulnerability of Indie and Karen Allen is head on Perfect as Marion Ravenwood.

From the director of ""Jaws"" and the creator of ""Star Wars"" comes the adventure film that all others in its genre are held up to, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". After twenty-three years and counting, I can honestly say that the film has yet to be outmatched (sure there have been good action/adventure films since ""Raiders"", including its own sequels, but I haven't seen a film that has had an indeliable, definitive impact that ""Raiders"" has left in a long time, possibly since the original ""Star Wars"")
Hired by the U.S. Government, archeologist/adventurer, Indiana Jones is on a race against evil to retrieve the lost Ark of The Covenent, the chest that contains the original stone tablets of the Ten Commandments. The ones that Moses brought down from Mount Harab and smashed. When was the last time YOU went to Sunday School!? Along the way Indiana meets up with an ex-girlfriend of his, Marion Ravenwood, outraces and dukes it out with legions of Nazis, and has plenty of close calls including a truck chase, The Well of Souls and its snakes (& Indiana's deathly phobia of them), a slugfest with a mechanic and his flying wing, and the opening of the Ark itself (lets just say GOD isn't to happy when mortals decide to open the Ark & sift through its contents).
An absolute modern-day classic. Why? ""Raiders""' opening, from the Paramount logo to the natives chasing Dr. Jones, the bar fight, the basket chase, The Well of Souls, the truck chase (that alone gets 5 stars), the opening of The Ark in all its glory, John Williams' Oscar nominated score, I could go on all day long, but, you get the drift. What gives the film its drive (and where the sequels fail) is the urgency & danger of retrieving the Ark and the competitiveness between Indiana Jones and the Frenchman, Renee Belloq (the film imposes, early on, that these two have been competitors since there college days).
I got this on cassette for Xmas 1984 and I burnt the tape out. Thank God for DVD.
Nominated for 8 Oscars including Best Picture, Director (Steven Spielberg), Original Score and winning 4 of those awards including Best Sound & Visual Effects. The American Film Institute ranks ""Raiders"" as one of the top 100 films of all-time and Indiana Jones as one of the top cinematic heroes second only to Atticus Finch from ""To Kill A Mockingbird"".
The truck chase wasn't directed by Spielberg (he did the close-ups afterwards), but was helned by second unit director, Norman Reynolds. Tom Selleck was originally cast to play Jones but had to back out due to contractual agreements with Universal and CBS for ""Magnum P.I."" (I think it would have been a different film. I saw a ""Raiders"" screen test with him and Sean Young and he came off very obnoxious). Danny DeVito was offered the role for Sallah but declined due to scheduling conflicts with ""Taxi"". The scene where the Nazi officer was supposed to shoot Sallah was filmed but couldn't be used, becuase of black smoke from burning tires in one take, and in another actor John-Rhyes Davies getting sick and filling his jallaba (and he didn't care one bit).
""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is one truly great adventure worth taking over & over again. No matter what George Lucas calls it.",1085702400,,3363,4.72108843537415
135080,4,0792158202,"Few classics in the history of motion pictures can be as easily recognizable for their theme music alone as Raiders of the Lost Ark and remain enduring beyond that identifiable element. When the feature was originally released in 1981, it certainly had a lot of potential going for it. Rising director Steven Spielberg showed potential with such hits as Jaws and Close Encounters with the Third Kind but lack-luster features like 1941 and The Sugarland Express hindered him from being a break-out commodity in Hollywood just yet. Added to the mix was the creative talents of another rising film-maker, George Lucas, who had just come off one the biggest motion picture phenomena of all time, Star Wars. Paramount executives must have been biting at the bit to see what these two creative geniuses could cook up but even they had to question their choice of relative unknown actor Harrison Ford as the lead role. But despite relative criticism, both Spielberg and Lucas believed they had the perfect choice after witnessing the former carpenter in American Graffiti and Star Wars. The real judgment would be determined by the movie-going public and whether or not they would endure a two-hour feature about a man with a hat and a whip.
The story centers on the adventures of a head-strong paleontologist as he searches for one of the most spiritual artifacts in the history of the world. There is no paleontologist in the world like Indiana Jones. He's seen it all from booby traps to a gigantic rolling boulder to spear-throwing natives. All in the name of archeology and maybe a little love here and there throughout his exhilarating exploits. But this new venture may be the most challenging of them all. The United States government, in their efforts to battle the Axis-powers during World War II, enlists Mr. Jones to search for the Ark of the Covenant, the sacred holding structure many believed contained the original Ten Commandments that were brought down from the mountain by Moses thousands of years ago, before the Nazis get to it first. Along his journey, he meets up with his ex-girlfriend Marion, who holds an essential piece to the puzzle in finding the Ark, but things become more complicated as the Nazis are in full pursuit. Indiana must get to the Ark before the Nazis do or else Hitler will control an unstoppable army that will eventually conquer the world. The story for Raiders of the Lost Ark doesn't seem all that complicated, or some can make the case not all that original, but looks can be deceiving. From the thrilling opening sequence to the mysterious conclusion, Raiders is one of the most entertaining and enthralling comedy/action adventures ever developed for the silver screen. It is all the little things in this film that make the big picture all the more enduring for viewers.
Whoever said Harrison Ford may have been wrong for the role of Indiana Jones may have had some merit in their comment back in 1981, but now adays that comment would be shot down so fast it wouldn't be funny. Though at the time the young actor had relatively light acting experience, Ford proves that he can measure up to any other in the role of high risk-taking adventurer. It is Ford's hilarious reactions to situations, most notably a particular moment during the chase through the marketplace, combined with his amazing ability to transition himself into key fight sequences that make him an essential casting decision in this feature. This may be a difference in time periods but for some audience members, Karen Allen's performance as Marion may be a little too Tom-boyish to be considered sexy. It might possibly have been more risqu back then but it isn't so much now. Not entirely her fault but the change of the times.
Overall, Raiders successfully brings to the screen one of the most charismatic and enduring action adventure heroes in cinematic history and does so in triumphant style. The wonderful thing about the film is that the filmmakers are able to blend humor into well-needed areas of the overall action oriented flick, though at times it seems they try too hard to get laughs across. The special effects were magnificent during the film's initial release and are still quite interesting today, though to a lesser degree. Unlike the special effects of later films like Terminator 2: Judgment Day, the special effects of Raiders of the Lost Ark don't have the enduring effect they once had but that doesn't make the film cheesy or seem aged. The bottom-line analysis of this film has to be based on the Indiana Jones series as a whole in that this feature is a wonderful first entry and deserves to be ranked highly but stands behind the last entry in the series on overall entertainment value. This doesn't, however, make the film less of an enduring classic or less of good time.",1077321600,,4818,4.841212121212121

Ford) lands in a Nazi plot to use the powers of the Ark of the Covenant to win the war. Karen Allen is cast as the obligatory dame who can land a solid punch and easily drink most men into oblivion.
Great tongue-in-cheek fun throughout. There's never a moment's doubt that Good will triumph over Evil, but it's sure fun to watch how it all plays out. Also fun to watch are Harrison Ford's facial contortions as he's ""just making it up as he goes along.""
Wonderful. If you've never seen it, watch it. Now.",1070323200,5,945,4.564705882352941
135082,4,0792158202,"I remember watching ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" for the first time as a child and wanting to go out and buy a whip and a hat.  All of the Indian Jones movies have stood the test of modern time, surviving countless viewings and rentals.  While I am personally a bigger fan of the second two films in the series, this movie is important for launching an extremely successful trilogy.  I enjoy ""Raiders"" for its somewhat sloppy nature; the acting and dialogue is not as smooth as it is in the later films, Harrison Ford is not as sure of his character in this film, and the pacing of the movie is a bit rushed.  This movie is all action with very little time to rest in-between.  Despite these immaturities, the film is highly enjoyable and well suited for a popcorn-eating-good-time.
""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is refreshing to watch amid the slough of action films that are being produced these days.  Indiana is not a perfect action hero; one of my favorite scenes is when Indiana swings on the vine to escape the villagers.  Just when you think he'll successfully swing out to his awaiting plane, he falls in the water.  The movie is constantly throwing in humor and antics to lighten up the pace.  Additionally, despite some of the more grotesque scenes, most of the action is downplayed in this film, as Indiana is quicker to throw a punch than shoot someone.  Indiana, like James Bond, always gets his girl-but he has to work at it.  He is definitely not a ladies man, which is a refreshing take on the whole Bond/Bond Girl motif.  In short, get this movie.  You'll have a good time watching a classic battle of good against evil...and whips and archaeologists.",1069718400,,1662,4.555555555555555
135083,5,0792158202,"Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first installment of a continuing series chronicling the adventures of archaeologist Indiana Jones, is a thrill-filled tribute to the Saturday-afternoon serials of the 1930s and 1940s.  It marked the first collaboration between Jones' creator George Lucas and director Steven Spielberg and is one of the most popular adventure movies to come out of Hollywood.
Set in 1936, Raiders of the Lost Ark pits professor-fortune hunter Jones (Ford) against a team of Nazis in a desperate race to find the legendary Ark of the Covenant, the sacred chest where the Hebrews had placed the fragments of the original Ten Commandments.  Lost for nearly 2,000 years, the Ark is coveted not only as an object of great historical import, but as Indy's boss and friend Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) points out, ""an army that carries the Ark before it is invincible.""  Now, Adolf Hitler wants the Ark, and Germany has sent a huge team of archaeologists led by the renegade Frenchman Belloq (Paul Freeman) and soldiers to Egypt in hopes of finding it.
When a secret German cable from Cairo to Berlin is intercepted by U.S. Army intelligence mentioning the lost city of Tanis, a relic called the headpiece of the staff of Ra and Abner Ravenwood, Indy's former instructor and estranged friend, the government hires Indy to find Ravenwood and get to the Ark before the Nazis do.  Soon, Indiana Jones will face Gestapo agents, Nepalese thugs, Arab swordsmen, and 7,000 snakes as he dodges bullets, swords and flying fists as he crosses half the world in search of the Lost Ark.  Along the way he is joined by Ravenwood's feisty daughter (and former flame) Marion (Karen Allen) and Sallah (John Rhys-Davies), ""the best digger in Egypt"" and a loyal friend.
Lawrence Kasdan's screenplay, based on a story by Phil Kaufman and George Lucas, keeps the whole endeavor moving like gangbusters and replete with 1930s-style humor in the vein of Michael Curtiz films (such as Casablanca). Featuring great stunts (some performed by Ford himself, including the famous rolling boulder in the prologue), fantastic special effects that still hold up over 20 years later, adept directing by Spielberg and a terrific score by composer John Williams, Raiders of the Lost Ark is an adventure film which has endured the test of time.",1068681600,,2317,4.992227979274611

135095,5,0792158202,"Oh, for the days when movies where about the good old battles between good and evil, before the days of moral relativism and political correctness.
In this fantastic 1981 blockbuster, action hero and archaeologist, Indiana Jones, battles against evil Nazis and other villains (such as bloodthirsty Arabs who bear a strong resemblance to Hamas terrorists), to prevent the Nazis and their minions from getting hold the Lost Ark of the Covenant, of ancient Israel, as part of Hitler's plan for world domination.
There is never a dull moment in this movie from battles with tribesmen, who have been recruited by the chief villain in the rainforests and ancient pyramids of the Amazon, to Tibet, to Egypt.
The leading lady, who accompanies Indiana Jones, and his love interest, is played by Karen Allen. She is quite tomboyish, and defiant, which only makes her all the more appealing when she is vulnerable and needing help!
And Indiana Jones will be called on to help the girl in distress, several times.
There are some really memorable parts, such as when an Arab swordsman challenges Indy, with some dramatic swordplay, and instead of the drawn out duel we expect, Indy quickly cuts him down with his pistol (I found that hilarious.)
Of course the most memorable and mind-blowing scene was when the Nazis finally found the arc. As they open it, they die a gruesome death, as their faces just melt away. G-D's vengeance on those who try to steal the property of his people, Israel.

135097,5,0792158202,"With George Lucas in full gear producing and co-writing his beloved ""Star Wars"" series, Steven Spielberg was hot off the box office trail after ""Jaws"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind.""  Since the two had already been friends before their respective careers started to take flight, it was natural that the two would come together and create a film that would stand the test of time.  The two, along with veteran writer Philip Kaufman, created Indiana Jones.  Lucas was inspired by the old Saturday matinee serials of his childhood (remember those ""Manhunt in the African Jungle"" short films?).
What a film!  I can't think of a reason why ANYONE should dislike it.  Even if you do dislike it (and for whatever reason, you're wrong), it's something you have to see just to see!  Harrison Ford is in fine form as the archaeologist Indiana ""Indy"" Jones, and we have Karen Allen as a feisty love interest and John Rhys-Davies excellent in the role of Sallah.  John Williams' score should've won the Oscar in my book (it lost to Vangelis' ""Chariots of Fire"") as well, with its haunting themes and the infamous ""Raiders March.""
The action hardly ever lets up and there's the occasional humor in-between the scenes and sequences.  Who can forget the boulder that Indy runs from near the beginning of the film?  How about the swordsman who shows off and Indy ends up shooting him without a fight?  How about the final scene in which the Nazis are practically decimated and destroyed by God when they open up the Ark of the Covenant?  All of these and more have become part of pop culture that we'll never forget.
Tom Selleck had turned down the role of Indy because he was committed to Magnum, P.I., and while he is a great actor, can you NOT imagine Harrison Ford in the role?  He defined the hero with his portrayal of the globe-trotting archaeologist.  In fact, I think this film's perfect in every aspect; the screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan (co-writer of Episodes 2 and 3 of ""Star Wars,"" and he also co-wrote and directed ""Dreamcatcher""), Steven Spielberg's old fashioned directorial style, and George Lucas's grand vision (along with a great cast and John Williams's spectacular score) helped propel this movie to be one of the top films ever made.
I guess not much more can be said.  GREAT film, an american classic.  You must see this film, whatever your opinions are.  You know you have to!",1064275200,,2395,4.734939759036145
135098,5,0792158202,"I grew up watching Indiana Jones, so I'm really partial on my comments.
Indiana Jones is everybody's hero because everybody wants to be like Indiana Jones. He has a cool profession, he has cool friends, women fall for him, he lives a life of constant and intriguing adventures. Spielberg and Lucas did an amazing job in creating such a likeable character. Even his name is fantastic, a name no one will ever forget. That's the secret of Indiana Jones: to be able to relate to all kinds of people, from young kids to old ladies.
""Raiders of the lost ark"" is one of the best movie-scripts I've ever seen. Every scene is memorable, the dialogue is quick, intelligent, and even funny, sometimes. Even if the main plot is not that original (Nazi Germany trying to dominate the world by means of an extermely powerful artifact), the accurately filmed action sequences, well-done by a master of the genre (Spielberg), will leave the viewer always in the edge of the seat. Spielberg and his production team did a great job in re-creating the perfect atmosphere of Middle-east in the years before World War II (1936), when the world seems a little bit antique (at least for us born after 1975) and yet already well-developed when we talk about scientific, weaponry and political stuff.
One other thing worth mentioning about ""Raiders"" is that it toys with the notion of the powerful, ancient artifacts of the monotheist religions - in this case, the Ark of the Covenant (in fact, in ""Last crusade"" we go back to this same notion, but with the Holy Grail), something that always gets the attention of the viewers.
Tom Selleck turned down the role of Indiana Jones because of his ""Magnum"" series. Thank God! It seems that Harrison Ford was born to be Indiana Jones. Combining Han Solo's wit and constant-feigned bad temper with James Bond's nerves of steel, Ford was able to create the perfect scholastic-adventurer. Of course, in this movie Indy represents the Good with a capital G, while almost everybody else that's not with him are Evil. That's OK. From the beginning, we already know who to cheer for.
My last comment is about John Williams' sound score. Just one word: unforgattable.
""Raiders of the lost ark"" deservedly became an overnight classic, bringing back the genre of movie appropriate to all ages and to everybody who likes a good adventure story.

Starting out with one of the best opening sequences ever on film, with spiders, deadly booby traps and one huge boulder, you know you're watching something special. With whip, fedora and sardonic grin all present and correct, Ford is the quintessential action hero in one of the most fantastic action films in movie history. The one line that sums up the whole film is spoken by Indy himself; when Sallah asks Indy ""How?"", Jones' classic reply is ""I don't know, i'm making this up as I go!"". Indeed, the film has a free-wheeling sense of adventure that goes from one amazing action set-piece to the next. My favourite scene is where Indiana is trying to save Marion.

135115,4,0792158202,"Original Comment -- 2002:

I still remember the rush I felt from seeing Raiders when it first came out!  Now, twenty years later, I've learned something else interesting about it.

Raiders turns out to be virtually a remake of a French film from 1964, That Man from Rio (L'homme de Rio) by de Broca.  Reviews occasionally mention the two films together as inspired by James Bond movies, but the scene-by-scene correspondence is so close that ""remake"" is the only word that fits.

The main difference between the two films is that Raiders, made in 1981 with U.S. technological pizzazz, takes the already fast-paced That Man and catapults it into orbit!

There are a number of other changes, which reflect differences in French and U.S. culture, as well as eras 17 years apart.  The French version has more Gallic lightness and is more socially aware, even ahead of its time, as it features a concern about environmental destruction.  The American version uses broader humor and is funnier (for my taste).  In place of environmental damage, the American version substitutes Nazi pillage of Jewish treasures.  Ironically, the American version actually chooses a Frenchman as its bad guy!

The differences are big enough that I can't say ""If you loved Raiders you'll also like That Man"" (you might not).  But for me That Man from Rio is an interesting film in its own right.

Added Comment -- March 2012:

I wrote my first comment ten years ago (!), and that was years after having first seen Raiders in the theater.  What prompted a comment in 2002 was my realization that Raiders was based on the earlier French film, L'homme de Rio.

Now in 2012 with all the publicity surrounding the new film The Adventures of Tintin (which I've just seen), it turns out that the aspect of Raiders that most made it stand out relative to L'home de Rio -- Raiders' high-voltage, non-stop action -- was itself inspired by the Tintin bandes dessines!

Which makes it all the more curious that the makers of Raiders decided to invent a French character as the film's bad guy.  Maybe in another ten years we'll find out what that was about!!  :-)",1041292800,,2125,4.756830601092896
135116,5,0792158202,"Five star movie, but I know when they release it on DVD it'll have a bunch of CGI effects replacing the lovingly-crafted rotoscopes and stop-action.  Also, the movie violence might be toned down ala E.T., where they replaced FBI agents' guns with walkie-talkies and the word 'terrorist' with the word 'hippy.'

So, get this on VHS in the unaltered, theatrical version, because it'll be the only time you can after they release the 'special' DVDs.

Other than that, this is one helluva movie!  Great characterization and writing.  The Gestapo mofo is creepy as hell, and cynical to boot.  You have to love his maniacal laughter at those religious fools when they find only sand in the arc.  The Frenchy you can almost feel for, and you have nothing but hatred for the Wermacht soldier.  Harrison Ford is a perfect intelligent action hero, and Karen Allen is a little tomboyish, but does a great job playing a girl that can keep up with Indiana and drink men under the table.

Total movie enjoyment from beginning to end.  Great adventure-action movie.  And just remember - a penanent man will pass!

135121,5,0792158202,"After the box-office disappointment of 1941, Steven Spielberg teamed up with longtime friend George Lucas to create one of the greatest action adventure films of all time! The premise for the film, a throwback to the old Saturday morning serials, was thought up by Lucas, who told the idea to Steven and the two of them came up with the idea of Indiana Jones, a character famously named after Lucas's dog. To think they originally wanted Tom Selleck to play the role of the rugged, charming ""collector of rare antiquities"". Instead, Harrison Ford took the role, fresh from the latest Star Wars film THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK as the dashing Han Solo. Ford is the perfect guy for the job, running around in tombs, chasing after Nazis and searching for lost treasures, all with fedora, whip and sardonic grin all in place.
The action is masterfully handled by Spielberg, especially in the classic opening scene where Indy avoids a series of lethal booby traps to obtain a rare idol, only to have a giant boulder start rolling after him. Indy's reply when asked how he's going to catch up with a truck is ""I don't know, i'm making this up as I go!"" That classic line sums up the off-the-cuff action sequences which are all reminiscent of the building tension and excitement of the spirit of the old serials of the 50's. John Williams' score for the film has become one of the most instantly recognizable movie theme tunes ever composed, except for JAWS and STAR WARS (Anyone who asks what's so great about John Williams, just ask them to hum notes from any movie, and it'll be Williams) and is one of the most popular soundtracks of all time. And the supporting cast of Karen Allen, Paul Freeman, Ronald Lacey, John Rhys-Davies and Denholm Elliott elevates the film to true classic status.
Considering the scope and scale of the film, the job Spielberg and Lucas did creating the picture is nothing short of amazing. The film spans 5 major locale changes and would shoot in 4 different countries in just 73 days for $20 million (production wrapped 12 days ahead of schedule to boot!). For what was fast becoming a relatively average production cost by 1980, Spielberg and Lucas packed the running time of RAIDERS with non-stop action that creates an exciting adventure, that's my (and many other's) favorite film of all time.
RAIDERS was released in the summer of 1981 and became the biggest hit and highest grossing film of that year. Between THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and RAIDERS for George Lucas and RAIDERS and E.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL for Spielberg, the two filmmakers were now at the peak of their profession, having individually (and together) proven themselves as hitmakers on 9 films by the time they would return for the next Indiana Jones adventure in 1984 with INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, which is exciting, but not as fun, and INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE, which is another one of my all-time favorite films. The huge influence that the eventual trilogy had on action movies is still seen today, with inferior rip-offs THE MUMMY, THE MUMMY RETURNS and TOMB RAIDER, to name a few.

The plot is pretty ridiculous, but that is besides the point. Raiders of the Lost Ark keeps you having fun for the whole time. Besides being exciting, it is pretty humorous as Spielburg clearly does not take himself too seriously. With this movie, he brings back the old style of the B-picture, and has fun doing it.

I probably saw it when I was seven or eight, and for a kid that young with such big dreams of the world it certainly inspired a lot of imagination on my part. A movie really captures your imagination when you actually imagine yourself in it, you imagine yourself as the hero of the tale. Not until years later when I reflect on how much I wanted to be Indiana Jones did I come to appreciate the movie's impact.
I know most people who idolize George Lucas do so because of Star Wars. I personally get more of a kick out of watching Harrison Ford punch out a few Nazis than in watching Darth Vader rasp ""A tremor in the Force..."" Why? I like Indy better because I love Lucas' re-imagining of those old 1930s and 1940s pulp serials about heroic adventures in far-off lands that many Americans in that era had simply never heard of. There is a grand spirit of adventure in Indiana Jones that is sorely lacking in Hollywood these days. (The closest movie I have seen to come close to emulating the magic of Indy is the two Brenden Fraser ""Mummy"" films.) When Indy dashes through the deserts of Egypt or climbs out of a Mayan temple there is an exhilarating sense of journey and exploration. When we see Indy arrive in a new locale it is exciting to imagine what it must have been like.
Of the three Indy films ""Raiders"" is the first and probably the best (although not my favorite: ""The Last Crusade"" wins that honor. I still laugh uproariously at the scene where Marcus Brody arrives in Egypt pleading: ""Does anyone speak English?"") The story is straight out of classic pulp fiction: the mysterious hero must journey to exotic lands (the Amazon, Cairo and Tibet) to obtain the mystical artifact. Such a simple concept, yet it is so much more enjoyable than the multitude of confused and convoluted story-lines that Hollywood churns out into movies each year. (The ""nuclear weapon stolen by terrorists"" plot is a tad overdone in my opinion. E.g. ""Bad Company"", ""Sum of all Fears"", ""Broken Arrow"", ""The Peacemaker"".)
The movie's premise might be simplicity itself, but Indy is not a simple character. He's intelligent, savvy, has weaknesses and is an imaginative thinker. Indy has what so many other movie characters lack: charisma. After watching ""True Lies"" I didn't want Arnold to be the guy who saves the world. Who could root for that jerk? Indy is the guy you want to root for.
This was the movie that made Harrison Ford a star and rightfully so. Ford perfectly strikes the perfect balance in his acting. Unlike, say, Elisabeth Shue as a physicist in ""The Saint"", Harrison Ford is perfectly believable as a college professor and as an action hero. I doubt George Lucas and Steven Spielberg could have done a better job casting the part. People remember Steve McQueen as the epitome of ""cool"" in the 1960s and 70s. Harrison Ford has probably never been cooler than in ""Raiders"". He is everything an action hero should be.
From John Williams stirring score that provides the emotional backdrop to the story to the gorgeous cinematography (the matte painting scenes still standup well even in our CGI-dominated age), this is a terrific film that fires the imagination. It is hard for me to name a favorite movie or even a top ten. If I did sit down to think about what my favorite movie is, you can bet money that ""Raiders"" will probably win out.",1025913600,,3483,4.592295345104334

One star is deducted for the political incorrectness and insensitivity in the opening sequence, where the grave robbing hero sends a bunch of ""primitives"" to the sky world. In an early Western, such simplistic trash may be excused, however, I expect more from Spielberg. Call me over sensitive, but (with exception for Harrison Ford's charming screen presence), the hero in this story is no more hero to me than a sleazy Mafia boss in a gangster movie.
In the ""Action Movie"" category, I would rate a movie such as Star Wars five stars. In fairness to movies of that quality, I cannot rate ""Raiders"" as high, because it is simply not in the same league. In Star Wars the mythologist Joseph Campbell was successful in helping to create a thought stimulating and interesting fantasy environment that made my jaw drop. In comparison Raiders of the Lost Ark lacks that extra edge some more demanding viewers would like to see.

135138,5,0792158202,"What can I say except that ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is a classic movie gem? With George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, and Harrison Ford contributing to this film, it's one of those movie greats which will always remain as one of my favorites to watch forever.
Harrison Ford is Dr. Henry 'Indiana' Jones, Jr., a college professor but also a renowned archaeologist. The story is set in 1936, with WWII going on. After coming back from a 'trip', Indiana and his friend Dr. Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) are visited by some government people who have some very serious news. The Nazi are very close to finding the lost Ark of the Covenant, hoping to use its holy powers to win the war for them. Indiana certainly jumps for the chance of recovering the Ark and agrees to try to find it before the Nazi. But he knows to find out it's whereabouts, he must find the medallion crystal piece which can pinpoint the Ark's exact location. With this knowledge, Indiana travels to look for Marion Ravenwood (Karene Allen), whom he knows has what he is looking for. But the Nazi, along with their French archaeologist Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman), are hot on his trail. It's up to Indiana, Marion, and good friend Sallah (John Rhys-Davies), to recover the Ark of the Covenant.
With plenty of action and adventure, this movie is sure to please anyone. It's a wonder how Indiana Jones can stumble on from one danger into another without getting killed! There's also plenty of wry and witty humor to keep you laughing and smiling. I must also mention the acting which is done superbly. There's Sallah who is faithful and trustworthy and Marion who's hardheaded, strong-willed, and ready to face anything. But the one who really carries the film is of course Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. He is just PERFECT for the part and I can never, ever imagine anyone else playing the part. He's the perfect hero and adventurer (even if he hates snakes, hee hee!)
A must-see, I can recommend this movie for anyone, though I must agree that it would be pretty scary for younger kids, especially the end. Two other Indiana Jones films are ""The Temple of Doom"" and ""The Last Crusade"". In my opinion ""The Last Crusade"" can measure up to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", with talented actor Sean Connery playing Indiana Jones father. ""The Temple of Doom"" was so-so. Now when are the DVD's coming out for these three films?",1017187200,3,2379,4.666666666666667

How many of today's Blockbuster movies have scenes as novel and ingenius as the one where they read the headpiece to the staff of Ra and discover that Belloque is digging in the wrong place?

135140,5,0792158202,"George Lucas was hot off of his first two installments of his ""Star Wars"" series, when he hooked up with mega director Steven Spielberg to create a whole new series of films. Little did they know that this creation they've made would be so incredibly successful and beloved. Lucas' ""Star Wars"" hero, Harrison Ford, was on board as our star. This 1981 classic takes place in 1936, and Indiana Jones is a school professor who is also an archaeologist, which takes him on many dangerous and scary adventures all over the world. In this one, Indiana gets involved with the nazi's who are planning to use the mysterious powers of the ark in order to help them win the war. Along the way, Indy meets up with a feisty young lady(played by Karen Allen). This adventures gets Indy in a series of thrilling and death defying moments. The movie obviously draws inspiration from those old time Saturday morning serials of yore. Harrison Ford was the right choice. Is there anybody better?. Tom Selleck was the lead for this role, but dropped out because ""Magnum PI"" came up. Thank goodness for us, huh?. This series has become one of the most memorable and hailed film series in movie history. And rightfully so. There's no better evening entertainment than letting Indiana Jones take you all over the world on one exciting adventure after another. Get this movie and the rest of the trilogy as well.

Another thing that separates this film from some other action films is that it's cheerful and darn fun to watch, not moody and depressing. There is something for everyone: great dialogue (""I hate snakes!""), great film moments (Marksman versus Swordsman) and certainly great music (Even someone who's deaf knows the theme music by heart). With all this, we forget the clichs and wooden characters, caught up rather in the excitement of what's going on screen.

135143,5,0792158202,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is the first and the best of the Indiana Jones trilogy. Here we are introduced to Dr. Jones(Ford), that apart from teaching archeology also spends a good amount of time tracking down articfacts.
Jones is introduced to a nazi plot to obtain the Ark of the Covenant, an artifact they believe will give them the power to conquer the whole world. Jones sets out to foil their plot and on his travels he hooks up with an old amour, Marion Ravenwood(Karen Allen) and the exeptional stereotypical Gestapo man Toht(Lacey) that continues to be his nemesis throughout the movie.
The movie seems to breath new life into the old saturday night matine cliffhanger style. The movie is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat. Indiana Jones got knack to getting out of a tight situation, although he rarely uses firearms. Most often it is the whip or the fist. The fist is something Marion also favours in her dealings with bad guys.

135156,5,0792158202,"I normally shy away from the term `perfect' in description because by its very definition it implies that the subject in question is in a static state; it cannot grow or be expanded upon.  In a world that functions on the principle of constant change, `perfection' is an anomaly, a stagnant blight rather than the mark of supreme beauty.  Yet I find that _Raiders of the Lost Ark_ challenges that assumption, for it edges on being the absolute perfect action movie, the blockbuster defined and unsurpassed.
Everything about this movie works.  Script, direction, and music all mesh into a superb piece of entertainment.  _Raiders_ is truly a movie more than the sum of its parts--though of course it was the imagination and talent of those individual players that fashioned this epic of mystery, danger, romance and pure adrenaline excitement.  Let's give these individual parts a closer look, shall we?
Laurence Kasdan, who also scripted the Star Wars movies, took Lucas' concept for an update of the 40's action serial and rewrote the genre in the process--Raiders is both homage and subtle ridicule: ""I hate snakes, Jack! I hate `em!"" ""I'm making this up as I go."" ""It ain't the years, honey, it's the mileage."" -understated character-building dialogue that also plays for a good chuckle--genius!  And then we get the archetypes: glowering, occult-obsessed Nazis; deceitful coolies; a singing sidekick; the suave French rival who thinks he is God's gift to history and women.  And then there is Indiana Jones, a hero who manages feats worthy of Hercules yet pays for it all in sweat and blood, and Marion, a world-wise dame who can drink the big boys under the table yet manages to convey vulnerability and sorrow with her big blue eyes.  The story itself, ludicrous in concept but masterfully introduced and followed through, when coupled with the astonishing action sequences makes _Raiders_ one of those movies you can watch again and again just for the sheer visceral and intellectual joy of it.
So much has been said and wrote about the illustrious career of Steven Spielberg that there is little I can add; let it be enough that every scene is framed for its maximum statement to the film *as a whole*.  No needlessly splashy camerawork to draw attention to the man behind the camera here! Besides the breathtaking action of the numerous fights/chaises, Spielberg's deft and understated direction turns _Raiders_ into an enthralling classic.
John William's score is magnificent, building tension in all the right places while strengthening the presence of the main characters, from Indy's galloping anthem to Marion's sweeping, romantic/melancholic theme.  Giddy orchestration fuels the chaise through Cairo; a brooding crescendo gives import to the final scene.
Perhaps I'm biased here.  I can still remember the chills `n thrills Raiders gave me when I viewed it in the theater at the age of seven. But then, I saw this just a couple nights ago with adult eyes and even with my analytical deconstruction, I loved it just as much now as then.  I know I'm preaching to the converted here, but if by some strange chance you have not viewed this wonder of the cinema, do everything in your power to rectify the situation.  _Raiders of the Lose Ark_ is in my top three movies of all time, and I'm sure I'm not alone.",997920000,7,3321,4.940754039497307

135160,5,0792158202,"There's a danger with a film like this that its excess of iconic moments will weigh down the narrative with so much nostalgia that things just can't move forward.  Think about it: You have Indy replacing the golden idol with the sandbag... running from the giant boulder... holding the staff of Ra in the map room... staring down the king cobra... etc.  These moments are now twenty years old, stuffy staples of American cinema.  Well, I recently had a chance to see ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" in a rep theatre, with a large and boisterous audience (the biggest cheer was reserved for -- you guessed it -- Indy shooting the Arab swordsman in the market of Cairo) who didn't mind how familiar the film was.  And you know what?  Neither did I.
I had forgotten what a great story this is.  From a technical standpoint, it's perfectly structured (the dialogue sure isn't world beating, so the narrative has to be tight).  There are very few wasted moments as Indiana globetrots in search of the Ark of the Covenant.  Sure, there are some clunky moments of exposition in the scenes at the university, but they can be forgiven quite easily when the rest of the film is nothing but exhilarating suspense and clever plot twists.
Don't expect political statements here, regardless of how many swastikas fly across the screen.  This is just amped-up B-movie fun.  But there are at least two elements here that elevate the film above such a modest pedigree.
The first is, obviously, Spielberg's direction.  For those who insist that the man is a syrupy hack plying whitewashed fairy tales to box office success, an attentive look at this flick will explicitly reveal his talent.  The camera always seems to be in the perfect place to capture the action, never meandering around a scene too long or it becomes stagnant.  Spielberg's massive technique does wonders in elevating the material.
The second is, obviously, the uniqueness of our hero himself.  Indiana Jones is a comic book come to life, able to take a punch of startling power and volume and then come right back with one of his own.  His proficiency with a whip is now legendary, as is his drive and desire for archaeological knowledge.  Nothing special so far, right?  Run of the mill superhero stuff.  But he bleeds when shot.  A lot.  And his big love scene is hilariosly punctuated by a strike to the chin courtesy of a vanity mirror.  And he's scared of snakes.  He's more like an anti-superhero (to coin a phrase).  That last bit is the most intriguing, for the psychology behind his fear is never explained or rationalized.  The fear is just presented matter of factly.  And once it is, the filmmakers are free to throw as many snakes as Jones as they see fit, just to watch him squirm.
The rest of the film is pretty standard fare, I'd say.  There are an endless supply of near misses and twists and turns, each more unbelievable than the last, but all fitting perfectly in the comic-book world the film is set in.  There's Indy's archrival, pragmatically throwing his hat in with the Nazis in the hopes of fame and fortune.  There's even the standard Peter Lorre-type character, a German sadist who talks in a childish voice and wears three-piece suits in the desert.  Come to think of it, if transferred into lush black-and-white, this movie would have no trouble fitting in with the best of its kind from the 1940's.  It's got that old school charm.
But it also relies on a modern sensibility.  I was shocked at how gory and violent it was.  Sure, most of the bloodshed was done off camera, but there sure was a lot of it.  You don't actually see the shirtless brute get sliced by the propellers, but you certainly see buckets of blood in the aftermath.  I didn't mind it one bit, but was taken aback by the fact that a film that achieved such massive popularity managed to infuse a healthy amount of gore into the mix.  I got a kick out of that fact.
One final thing I noticed this viewing that my previously unsophisticated ears didn't catch before.  John Williams' score modulates and slithers around that great familiar theme, but only hits it full-force (in the proper key) in the climactic moments.  I was waiting anxiously to hear that tune in all its glory, and when I finally got to, it had that much more power.  Williams is a master of catchy and simple melody in his scoring, and this is a fine example of his talent.
My memory hadn't treated ""Raiders"" nicely in the years since I'd first seen it.  Trying to rebel from Spielberg's popularity probably had a lot to do with that.  But my most recent viewing changed all that, confirming that the film's classic status is well deserved.",992649600,,4656,4.623629719853837

What I've never understood is how the villain could have been so stupid as to *open* the Ark. Biblical accounts make it quite clear that thing was *dangerous* and best left lost.",992304000,,546,5.0777777777777775
135171,5,0792158202,"""Raiders..."" is one of my all-time favorite movies. Harrison Ford plays Dr. Indiana Jones, college archeology professor. In his spare time, he also hunts for lost historical artifacts. Set in 1936, ""Raiders..."" finds the U.S. government concerned over reports that the Nazis are close to finding an ancient artifact of enormous historical and religious signifcance. It may also have great power. Intrigued, Indy takes up the quest to find the artifact first. What follows is a classic Saturday-matinee adventure that never lets up. It's got action, suspense, romance and humor. There are a number of famous scenes, here (i.e. Indy fleeing the huge stone ball or Indy and the sword-wielding assassin) and the acting is fine. Ford gives Dr. Jones a modest, boy-next-door charm to go with his two-fisted, death-defying persona. Karen Allen plays Marian, Indy's old flame, and is a terrific match. She is tough and self-sufficient one moment, vulnerable and sexy the next. On top of all that, you've got George Lucas writing and producing, and Steven Spielberg directing. Great stunt work, too. There isn't much more you could ask for.
Is there anyone out there who is actually unfamiliar with this movie? If there is, and you're reading this, where have you been? Get it and watch it. It's just pure fun from beginning to end. The only downer is that they only made two more Indiana Jones movies after this, and Harrison Ford isn't getting any younger. There are scads of James Bond movies, so why can't they get it together and make a few more of these. But I digress. Get ""Raiders..."" if you haven't already got a copy. It's one of the very best.

Its one of those great movies where it knows its a movie and makes the eventful things up, the classical things up. When I become a filmmaker I want to make movies like this, very eventfully made, very self-aware films, that are as eventful as possible. Somtimes I think of films that should be like this one, and like the ones I want to make. In Raiders, Harrison Ford is someone we've seen in Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back, but still he's this very mystique-full character, we wonder who this tough-guy is, wearing that hat. We end up getting to know him, but throughout this film and the other Indiana Jones films, his mystique is always intact, much like Batman. Indiana Jones is classical figure.

135175,5,0792158202,"Okay. Just to get this out of the way; Yes, the title change is stupid, but I understand the meaning behind it. Paramount wants to market the entire package of Indiana Jones films, from the theatrical kind to the ones made for television. Since ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was the only movie that didn't have the Indiana Jones name in the title, newcomers to the series would have to <gasp> read the back of the tape to know that it was the same character. It's silly to think that people would not know that this was the first Indiana Jones film, but to the newbie, it might not be so obvious. I think we ought to cut Paramount a little slack here. It's not like a 1980's Ted Turner colorizing every black-and-white he got his hands on. It's just a title.
If you decline to buy this movie simply because the box has a different title, you are a fool. The film inside the tape remains unchanged. The opening credits say ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" as it should. So, you are losing NOTHING by purchasing this breathtaking, heart-stopping ode to the ""B"" movies of the Golden Age of Cinema.
Now, onto the actual film. This is quite possibly the perfect movie. Alright. Before your laughter gives you an embolism, let me explain. Movies are here to entertain. They are made to make us laugh, cry, yearn for something, root for the good guys, boo the bad guys, and feel like you've been through the whole amazing sequence of events right with the heroes.
Not only does ""Raiders"" do all of that in abundance, but the film also earns special merit for changing moviemaking as we knew it. No previous film was as non-stop, as bold, or as fast-paced as this one was. It upped the ante in terms of what a movie audience was to expect from a film. Steven Spielberg hardly lets you gasp for your next breath before he snatches it from you with the next incredible scene. (It's no wonder that it is a story co-written by the director of one of the most popular films of all time, George Lucas.)
After ""Raiders"" was made, it seemed like every film wanted to aspire to the same level of excitement, and sadly, few have even come close.
Do not be deterred by the title-change. You would do yourself a great disservice if you were to pass on owning this masterpiece of ""on-the-edge-of-your-seat"" filmmaking.
Now, I'm going to pop in my own copy and donate a few more gasps of pure excitement and joy toward Mr. Spielberg's work. If he had a dollar for every time I gasped, he'd be a . . . Wait. He already IS a millionaire. Oh well.

135194,5,0792158202,"As far as action movies go, this is the best of them all. Spielberg scored big in '81, he almost single-handedly resurrected the Saturday matinee  serial. The film is a fast-paced roller-coaster ride with break-neck action  sequences and drenched in cliffhanger suspense. Harrison Ford is the  ultimate action hero; brooding, heroic, fearless and resourceful. Along  with James Bond, Indiana Jones is the most enduring action hero of the past  century. One of the great screen entertainments. The unforgettable now  classic opening action sequence is a knockout. But it is followed by one  unbelievable action sequence after another, in fact this are the most  incredible series of action sequences that have ever populated an action  film. But the film is also romantic and filled with tongue in cheek humor.  Karen Allen is perfect as Indy's tough talking girl, in fact none or the  female costars of the following Indy sequels even came close. It is also a  technical landmark, with groundbreaking use of editing, cinematography and  sound. And the special effects, astounding at the time, look kind of cheesy  today but fit perfectly into the essence of the Saturday matinee serials.  Also one of the films biggest assets is the now classic John Williams score  that also became one of the most famous of all time. Besides being the film  that put archaeology back in vogue, it also revived the action genre after  almost a two decade slump. This box office smash was followed by two  sequels, while both were good, none of them captured the essence and  top-notch escapism of the original.

135195,5,0792158202,"What can I say...I've been watching these movies since I was four years old, and every time I view them, I notice something new.  This is due to the fact that all the INDY movies are so rich and full of cinematic mastery it  is hard to comprehend during one viewing. Raiders is jam packed with  memorable scenes, that have stayed in the mind of its viewers ever since  its original theatrical release in 1981.  Who could forget the opening  bolder sequence, or the shoot out in the cantina...or my favorite scene  inperticular, the truck chase sequence. All of which have been presented  here in their original theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35:1, thus preserving  the image as it was seen on theater screens, while at the same time,  revealing the director, STEVEN SPIELBERG's artistic integrity.  Never  before has this film been available in this format, and the picture quality  has been greatly increased.  One of the many unforgettable aspects of  Raiders is its brilliant sound design, courtesy of STAR WARS sound designer  BEN BURTT, for which he won an academy award.  Listen carefully to the  truck chase sequence; at a certain point, one can decipher the sound of a  lion roar as the truck switches gears, a mere stroke of genius.  MUSIC...what  would this film be without JOHN WILLIAM'S swashbuckling score...the raiders  march alone sets the mood, and the choir utilization for the biblical ARK  OF THE COVENANT is yet another stroke of genus.  I could talk forever about  this film, as you can probably tell...but please, bare with me.  The  cinematography in this film is outstanding.  Spielberg chose to open the  lenses of the cameras a little more, to make the scenes in the desert seem  blazingly life-like.  Few directors today have the ability to pull off such  a brilliant effect.  Film editing by Michael Kahn is incredible, and Kahn  definitely deserved the academy award he won for this picture.  Now,  sound wise, until this film is released on dvd, I have yet to hear a better  version of this mix; especially the opening sequence, in which bass is  delicately balanced, and the crumbling of the idle temple fills the entire  sound field...Not bad for vhs.  I'm sure the THX process has a little  something to do with it, hahahaha.  The cantina gun fire is also quite  effective, and overall sound is superb.  Well, lets see, how much  better can you get?  A movie with a story by George Lucas, and directed by  Steven Spielberg; not a bad combination if you ask me.  Screenplay was also  brilliantly penned by Ann Arbor's own Lawrence Kasden.  (EMPIRE STRIKES  BACK, RETURN OF THE JEDI, THE BIG CHILL.)  All and all, RAIDERS hits it on  every element, nominated for 11 academy awards, including best picture.  This vhs edition is the best version of the film available, and if you're a  true INDY fan, you'll definitely buy this to tied you over while waiting  for the dvd release!

It is saturated in the Saturday matinees much the  same way that George Lucas' ""Star Wars,"" but unlike the other  film, it combines the exhileration of pure speed with clever dialogue.  Harrison Ford radiates old-fashioned star quality like no actor since  Bogart, and his co-star Karen Allen has never been more entertaining or  more fetching. (They top my sexiest film couple list.)
