3726957,4,B001O4C6IU,THe work out was ok if you are beginner... Poor cueing ... I would recomended if you don't use it as your only workout.,1242086400,2,119,4.0
3726958,4,B001O4C6IU,"So I just finished doing this dvd and the jury is out on this one.  Did I enjoy it?  I really don't know.  Did I sweat?  Not really, I had to add the bonus segments to get a good sweat going.  The workout starts with a standing warm-up.  Nice for your back and thighs  Lots of roll downs and ups, leg squats and oblique work.  Each aerobic segment starts with an on the floor abs workout.
Segment 1:  head side to side; straightening one arm cobra; cobra rolls; opposing leg and arm lifts; bent leg straight arm lift...to touch behind with twist...to sitting on each side; forearm plank; child's pose.  The aerobic section is a bunch of scoop releases, and hip pops and turns on each side with add ons.  You can go to totalfitnessdvds and see a clip of segment 1.  This segment is aerobic, but not sweat inducing, for me anyway.

I have to say a word about the music.  It is calypso jazz.  It is quite syncopated.  Now, I am quite rhythmic and I can follow almost any beat, BUT I kept getting lost with this music. So I guess if rhythm is not your strong suit, then you may get lost. I suggest that you follow your own beat and have a good time. The steps are simple but for me it was hard to figure out what beat she was dancing on.  She should have counted more.  But you know Kimberly is not great on cuing and that applies here. UPDATE: I did this workout on music only, and I swear that it is hard to pinpoint the beat.  You have to listen for it as I think she changes beats frequently.  Basically I think the count is in the bass guitar and not the percussion.  So listen for that.  What a challenge!

Segment 2 begins with some simple pilates moves.  Nothing too hard.  The aerobic section is somewhat aerobic but mostly toning, just lots of hip circles and snake moves.  There is an african dance move that will test your coordination and timing.  Hands on hips and twisting side to side with a step touch. Same music as segment 1.

The cool down stretches the back and is done mostly standing.

After I finished the main workout, I was barely sweating so I did the 2 bonus segments:  Bollywood workout playtime (5 minutes) and Samba da roda (8 minutes).

My overall thoughts are that this is not an intermediate workout like the people at collage video said.  It is more beginner to advanced beginner.  Kimberly is her usual perky self and I'll do it again with the music only option and maybe the rhythm will be more apparent.  Just a note, I think this dvd goes hand in hand with lower body burn.  I returned that dvd, but a friend gave me hers and I think next time I will do them together, if time permits.  If you do both segments from that one and both segments from this one, you'll have a great workout.  Together you'll sweat up a storm.

I wish she would come out with an intermediate/advanced workout with a longer aerobic section, taught like a real dance class.  But alas, the next Dance and be Fit dvd is a hip hop workout. Not feeling that!

P.S. Fast forward 3 years.  I found this dvd in the back of my dvd holder.  Looked at it again and had the same issue with the music.  Sooo, I put it on mute and played Ikuma Jungle jam by Earth Tribal Rhythms and Re-awakening the Spirit by Bob Holroyd.  Perfect!!! The dvd is so much better with different music.  I have a new workout!!",1239840000,9,3304,4.258064516129032
3726959,5,B001O4C6IU,"Okay, it started simply enough, last Fall, when I went into Amazon looking for a nice, simple video workout for my girlfriend. I stumbled upon one of Kimberly's other videos and purchased it. My girlfriend loved it AND got great results from it! That video made its way to my mother's home and she's since bought a copy for herself. In the meantime, we bought another Kimberly video and the same thing happened.... Sensing a trend, we were happy to see this 'Abs Burn' video, new in '09. We have it in our library and I'm finding this one to be especially great for morning-time, as a way to wake up and get your body and blood moving! The music is upbeat and positive, like Kim, and her instruction is easy to follow, educational, and inspirational. It seems like beginners to exercise and dance would have an easy time following this, as she takes it at a nice, natural pace and you can perform the moves to the best of your abilities until you can keep up with her (lofty goal as that may be). Anyway, if you can get yourself up a half-hour before your normal waking time, push 'Play' on your DVD player, and go with the music and Kim's upbeat instruction, I'm sure your abs and body in general will thank you greatly as has been the case with me, my girlfriend, mother, pets...! MUCH better than coffee as a wake-up. Start your day with this video and you'll be ready for anything that comes your way!! A+, Kim, and keep it going!",1239753600,,1434,4.394736842105263
3726960,5,B001O4C6IU,"The fact that I am now incorporating an abs component to my regular workout is a testament to Kimberly's infectious and motivating enthusiasm! Although I dream of sexy abs I usually have to drag myself to do the actual exercises. Not so with Abs Burn. The music is cool and sexy, Kimberly's directions are easy to follow and it's a lot of fun. Finally, true to  the title, my abs DO burn!  I can feel my abs getting sexier with each move! I love it!  I recommend this video to everyone!",1237075200,2,486,4.318681318681318

8329322,5,B001O4C6IU,"An absolutely great purchase, better than expected.  As a begninner it is easy to follow and will surely provide the exercise moves I am looking for as I become more fit and agile.",1355097600,,180,4.454545454545454
8329323,1,B001O4C6IU,"I bought one of her DVD before, Dance and Be Fit: Brazilian Body (2008)
and I loved it, I thought that this DVD was going to be the same as the last one or even better... is boring for me... I don't recommend it!!!!",1335484800,,215,3.909090909090909
8329324,3,B001O4C6IU,"She is fun and the moves aren't that difficult but also not super easy either.  The camera angles are pretty good; unlike some videos where you are just looking at their face when you need to see their foot work, or it's so schizophrenic that you get dizzy.  The music is good, but like most videos' for me, I get bored with them after a couple of weeks.  I would buy another from her, like her energy.",1301961600,2,402,4.194805194805195
8329325,3,B001O4C6IU,"The pace gets too slow at times for me, and the moves are not always evident.  In fact, I overextended a neck muscle the first time I did this workout, and I've done her other workouts for two years now.  I got a decent workout with this, though I will probably sell my copy.",1291507200,,275,4.074074074074074
8329326,5,B001O4C6IU,"The Acacia videos that I know are great! They have original music easy to hear several times thru.
This video in particular it is not very hard to follow. I consider myself as an intermediate dancer and I find this video easy to follow but I love it anyway because when I finish it I always can se the difference in my abs, they seem tighter and toned every time. Now I am doing this one once a week.
Another thing that I love is that the exercises are a mix of conventional forms of working out with some more unconventional. One other thing that is worth mentioning is that even though this workout is focusing on abs you still work your whole body because you are dancing half of the time.",1270512000,5,692,4.25
8329327,5,B001O4C6IU,"""This is a totally new way of working your abs or your entire core area. Kimberly will lead you through 2 segments: ""Curvy Core"" and ""Sexy Sculpt"". Each one is 20 minutes. It was slightly difficult following the DVD when you are laying on the floor moving all over the place, so you have to heavily rely on hearing Kimberly or just plain remembering the sequence! Floor work is half of the workouts and the other is standing/dancing. The standing is more cardio-oriented because you will be isolating the hips, the abs, doing undulations, ""scoop & press"", plies, et al. This is a workout where you will have to really contract your middle all the time because you don't want to stress your lower back, so beware and listen to Kimberly. This is a DVD, I would want to always watch and work up to doing. Finally, check out the bonus feature with other dances from ACACIA DVDs,""",1263340800,,875,4.544303797468355
8329328,4,B001O4C6IU,"This DVD is a nice addition to my collection of dance workouts. It gets me moving, but is pretty low impact. I love the instructor. She is very upbeat with out being unnaturally or annoyingly so!",1252713600,,195,4.444444444444445
8329329,4,B001O4C6IU,"YogaGirl wrote a grew review on the content & feeling of the dvd.
The amazon clips are helpful as the trailer doesn't show you the content, but the second one shows you part of the wonderful warm-up that when it finally builds up the the full movement, really stretches out your lats, shoulders, spine, etc. The third clip shows you one of the, what I would call ""free dance"" as it's not dance moves (other then step touches & occasional hip circles), but it is more fluid then just aerobics. You'd better like these kinds of moves as it's the main bulk of the workout & it feels very repetitive. But it DOES work. My abs were killing me the next day.
Kimberly Mullen's standing dance/aerobics pace felt a bit fast to me, but she has grace & fluidity. What's odd is she does do a small amount of pilates, but each movement/pose is done so quick, she's done before you can fully get into it almost, it's like an afterthought. I actually wished she did more, as her holding plank & bridge w/lifted legs was over before I could even feel anything. It's also thrown in between a lot of the standing aerobics as a break, but it seemed a little disjointed the way it was done.
Kimberly Miguel Mullen seems friendly & positive, she does have great presence as you can tell she does enjoy what she's doing which keeps you motivated.

Menu options:
Sound - Usual instruction & music or just music, biography of Kimberly Miguel Mullen & Composer Justin Michael & 4 trailers of other workouts.
Workout - Warm-up (5 min), Curvy Core (20 min), Sexy Sculpt (20 min), Cool Down (5 min) I can't tell you what difference curvy core or sexy sculpt has other then the latter repeated the same moves, but added hip circles w/the stepping & a few VERY simplified latin moves.
Bonus - Playful dance from ""The Bollywood Dance Workout""  (5 min) & Samba de Roda from ""Dance & Be Fit Brazilian Body (8 min)

Better idea of content on video clip: collagevideo com",1245542400,3,1936,4.478753541076487
8329330,5,B001O4C6IU,"What more can I say, these Dance and be fit DVD's with Kimberly Mullen are great. OMG, I am so sore right now. This is my third review of her DVD's. I worked my butt off, her energy keeps you so motivated, a calm, enlighting spirit transends through her dance. I could barely keep up, but just like with her first DVD the Brazilian Body, I was able to catch on in no time. The music, exotic movements, grace and form, makes you work harder to master it. I almost died getting through it, and what a sweat I was able to work-up. When I was done, I felt like a million bucks. You won't ever catch me in a gym again, No way this is it for me. I will dance myself into maintaining good health and wellness. Loved it.",1244937600,,712,4.056737588652482
