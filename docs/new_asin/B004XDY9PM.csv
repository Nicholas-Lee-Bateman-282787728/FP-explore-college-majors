4495372,4,B004XDY9PM,Great shows on information about other countries. Information I did not recieve in school. Make my children watch on weekends as these are sutible for learning and are family shows. This has improved the way my chldren look at other nationalities instead of just how they are put forth by the news on tv. Great for homework assignments. Keep them coming.,1366761600,,354,4.819672131147541
8446853,4,B004XDY9PM,"LOL, I love Burt Wolf because he's good at travel videos. He let's the people he speaks with speak, and is very informative, and likable. He focuses on the history of the places he visits, and this particular 25 minute short keeps the viewer's attention. This one started off slow which focused on dams blah blah, but became very interesting speaking of the interesting architecture. This video though only focuses on the Northern part of Netherlands.",1510272000,,451,4.947368421052632
