7976515,3,B00007GZPX,Like the other DVD's which mention Jules Verne's very interesting to watch and to have for my movie collection .,1370736000,,112,4.65
7976516,2,B00007GZPX,"There is very little interesting content included in this documentary. The first 2/3 of the video are a complete waste of un-watchable ""off subject"" nonsense. Out of the 58 minutes included in this DVD only about 12 are interesting enough to watch and that is in the very last part of the DVD. I don't write many reviews but I had to write this one so that it might save someone some time, money and frustration.",1329523200,,412,4.434210526315789
