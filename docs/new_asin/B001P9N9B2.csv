3746754,5,B001P9N9B2,"I'm a huge Friends fan, I have all the seasons on DVD. But this show is way better. I've watched this show ever since it came on and it's hilarious! I've laughed till I've cried and almost peed my pants. Kelly Ripa and Faith Ford are a great duo and I was so excited when I saw this come out on DVD I ran out and bought it. I can't wait till the other seasons come out, I'll have the whole collection!",1242086400,,401,3.902439024390244

3746756,5,B001P9N9B2,"I absolutely adore Hope & Faith, and I remember falling in love with it when it first came out -- I never missed an episode after that premiere. I about threw a fit when it was canceled, because I just loved it that much. Faith and Kelly are both amazing in their roles, and I truly couldn't pick a favourite character on the show. I've been catching reruns for the past few months, and it's just been bliss. Now I just discovered the DVD release, and rest assured this has made my entire week!",1241222400,3,494,4.26595744680851
3746757,5,B001P9N9B2,"Kelly Ripa and Faith Ford are reincarnation of Lucy and Ethel. The humor is slapstick and cute. In watching this, I haven't laugh that hard in years.

Hope  (Ford) is the happy married wife. Her sister Faith (Ripa)was fired from her soap opera gig and moves into her sister's home. Hope's husband (Ted McGinley) reminds me of Desi Arnaz's Ricky without the cubian accent. The three kids seem more like props for the two female leads, since the kids have NOTHING to do

My favorite episode is where their aunt died. Faith steals a ring she assumes is her mother's dfrom the deveased, however its another person's funeral.

The humor is not forced, just like fun slapstick with no message or heavy theme

3746758,5,B001P9N9B2,At last - a well deserved comedy series gets onto DVD - let's hope the whole of the series is on DVD soon after March and Season 1!  I wonder why it has taken so long to be brought onto DVD - it should never have been cancelled - what a hilarious sitcom and comedy at it's very best.  The actors are great and how ever many times I watched the repeats on ABC I still found it very funny.,1232841600,10,387,3.825

3746760,5,B001P9N9B2,"Hope and Faith is a really funny show my family and I would watch it every friday night when it was on and  it was hilarious. They chemistry of the cast was awesome and the timing was always perfect. I am so happy season 1 is going to be on dvd and I hope season 2 and 3 come also because it was a great show. The only thing I did not like about the show was the teenage daughter in the 1st season was really good and they replaced her with the girl from ""The Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen"" and the girl who took over was really a bad actress but other than that the whole show was hilarious and it is worth getting on DVD.",1231459200,2,630,3.883720930232558

3746770,5,B001P9N9B2,"ABC may have not liked this show, but it's a very funny sitcom

Series: Hope & Faith
Seasons: 3
Airing Years: 2003-2006
TV Guideline: TV-PG-DLSV, TV-14-DL

Faith Ford plays down to Earth happily married Hope Shanowski whose tidy little world starts to unravel when her attractive ex-celebrity sister Faith Fairfield (Kelly Ripa) moves into her house. Hope is the more mature one, and Faith tends to act like a child.
Among Ford and Ripa we have Ted McGinley (Married... with Children) playing Hope's hunky husband Charley who is hellbent on kicking Faith out of his house. Nicole Paggi later Megan Fox plays the role of Sydney, Hope & Charley's oldest daughter. Sydney is very rebellious and at times dim-witted, after Fox takes over Sydney becomes more promiscuous. Macey Cruthird plays youngest daughter Hayley, who is very akin to Lisa Simpson, and often butt heads with Sydney over intelligence. Paulie Litt plays Justin the youngest and the oddball, Justin has an obsession with Frank Sinatra among many other things, and tries to avoid trouble at any cost.

Season One is a riot, among the situations you will see Hope & Faith attending anger management, working in a diner to pay their bill and many other miscellaneous adventures.

Hope & Faith is like a modern-day version of Lucy & Ethel, and is actually based on creator Joanna Johnson's real life.

Now for my review this set
Video: 10/10, the episodes are taken from HD prints and lack compression
Audio: 10/10, how clear can you get?
Bonus: 10/10
Overall, I recommend this set
Great job ABC and Lionsgate for putting it together :)",1401235200,,1595,4.892592592592592
3746771,5,B001P9N9B2,I wished there was more shows like this. Kelly Rippa makes the movie pop. Enjoy it very much It makes your day better.,1397433600,,118,4.173913043478261
3746772,5,B001P9N9B2,"When this show aired on TV, I was hooked & to come across it on DVD made me so happy! This is definitely a show that can be watched by the entire family. It's clean & funny. So, buy it today & tomorrow have a movie night with your family or friends!",1395014400,2,249,3.8076923076923075
3746773,4,B001P9N9B2,"Built around the talents of stars Faith Ford (), and Kelly Ripa (Live! With Regis and Kelly, All My Children), Hope and Faith (2003-006) had a successful three year run on ABC.  Ford plays Hope Shanowski, a wife and mother of three living in Ohio, while Ripa plays her sister Faith Fairfield, an Emmy winning former soap opera star, who has left Hollywood to come and live with her sister.  Hope is the responsible and sensible type, while Faith is a self-centered diva, prone to behavior that creates outrageous situations for Hope and her family.

Created by Joanna Johnson, a long time actress on the soap The Bold and the Beautiful, the series is built on the relationship of the sisters, and there is excellent chemistry between the two stars.  Ripa is completely in her element, playing a self-absorbed extrovert, basking in the glow of her own spotlight, while Ford is adept at playing the extremely conservative Hope, a woman who often scowls at things she finds distasteful.  The two stars work very hard, and repeatedly demonstrate a flair for physical comedy, with a raucous food fight being just one of many examples.

Hopes husband Charlie (Ted McGinley,&nbsp;) is a nice guy, but desperately wants his sister-in-law out of his home.  The rest of the family includes daughters Sydney (Nicole Paggi), and Haley (Macey Cruthird), and son Justin (Paul Litt).  McGinley is very entertaining, and the others are also quite able when called upon.

The writing is generally good, dealing with a wide variety of situations, and featuring some original ideas.  The two-part, over the top season finale, set at the Daytime Emmy Awards, features numerous sitcom stars, and is a fabulous highlight that touches the heart.

Hope and Faith benefits from a terrific list of guest stars, topped by Robert Wagner (&nbsp;who plays Faith and Hopes father.  Ripas TV co-host Regis Philben is fabulous as a used car salesman, and Kathie Lee Gifford, who Ripa replaced on Live!, is wonderful, playing a sassy waitress looking for a break in show business.  Other notable guests include Tony Curtis (), Susan Lucci (All My Children), Tom Arnold (), Kevin Sorbo (), Lynda Carter(), Clint Black, Jenny McCarthy, Roger Clemens, Eric Braden, and Mimi Rogers ().

Season One of Hope and Faith contains 25 non-subtitled episodes on 4 discs.  Bonus features include commentary tracks on several episodes, a blooper reel, and Family Dynamic: Creating Hope and Faith, a marvelous 30 minute featurette about how the series came to be.  So far, this is the only season available on DVD, but the subsequent seasons will hopefully be released someday.",1389484800,,2628,4.993119266055046

They get into messes that get worse and worse, and the messes aren't sterotyped - often they are very surprising.  The writers are great, and so are the actors.  Highly recommend.  My favorite is the hot dog costume.",1293667200,2,314,4.722222222222222
3746783,5,B001P9N9B2,"Great dvd. It was a gift for my mom, she loved it and it got here faster than I expected. Hope and Faith are hilarious.",1287273600,,119,3.8
3746784,3,B001P9N9B2,"Hope and Faith is more than I expected.  It is mildly funny, which is high praise in these days of PC and network standards.  It is on a par with Everybody Loves Raymond, which is one rung below the Simpsons, South Park and the old Reno 911.  All of those are non-PC and wouldn't fit in this time, network, audience, etc.

This is 90% a woman's show, with female plots, themes, and characters.  However, Kelly Ripa is a whirlpool, a fount of sex appeal.  Noone in show business flaunts it like she does, God bless her.  Her sister (Faith Ford playing her married sis) is also good looking, more handsome than vamp.  The rest of the cast is fine also, with actors doing their comedic part in turn to make each episode just funny enough, just sweet enough, to be endearing but not cloying.

The show would be rated PG13 if it were a movie.  In that way, it is a family-motif comedy and not a family one, a la the old 1950/1960's 'wholesome' comedies of old...",1285372800,3,957,4.3559322033898304

3746786,5,B001P9N9B2,"I came across this show while channel surfing and noticed I was occasionally laughing out loud. I'm surprised at how funny Kelly Ripa is. She possesses great comedic timing and some of her expressions along with Faith Ford's are priceless. The rest of the cast contributes plently with Ted McGinley being my favorite as Charley. The poor guy just can't win with Kelly.
I wish this show had run longer or Kelly would do another sitcom. This is defitnitly a show that you can watch over as many of the episodes are hilarious.
I hope the last two seasons are released soon.",1276041600,,570,4.598039215686274

3746789,5,B001P9N9B2,The first season of Hope and Faith is like a modern day rewrite of I Love Lucy.  It is a fairly clean show and the comedic twists are innovative and absolutely hilarious!
