2352856,5,B000A2U5GW,I first downloaded several episodes of this and liked what I saw. Anything to do with history fact or fiction my wife and I like. I would recommend this to anyone that shares the same views that we have.,1371945600,,203,4.230769230769231
2352857,5,B000A2U5GW,"I first watched some of this series on public TV many years ago. I have looked for the series on DVD since. Unfortunately it was only available on the European version. I recently received a DVD player for the European region as a gift and after seeing an American version for over $100 I searched Amazon for alternatives. I was pleased to find this item at a reasonable price.
The story is very compelling folioing the rise of a common soldier up from the ranks to become an officer in the British army of the early 1800's. Each episode corresponds to an actual battle of the period. Richard Sharpe is a real action hero of the times. Sean Bean plays the character to perfection. The production is very high quality. The supporting cast is great. The action and battle scenes show the horrors of war at that period very realistically. Development of the characters adds to the enjoyment of the series.
I have started to read the book series by Bernard Cornwell. There are over 20 books in the series encompassing a wider length of Sharpes career and adventures.
For history, military history and gun history I highly recommend the books and the DVDs.",1360713600,,1151,4.647058823529412
2352858,5,B000A2U5GW,"One of the best historical series created by British! The cast (especially Sean Bean), costumes, soundtrack - everything is perfect!",1357430400,,132,5.65
2352859,4,B000A2U5GW,"I purchased this set and at the same time picked up a region-free DVD player. Together they cost less than the price of the Sharpe set for the US region. Took a little planning ahead, but I'm happy with the results. This is an excellent series but very overpriced in the U.S.",1342224000,3,275,4.3076923076923075
2352860,1,B000A2U5GW,"The initial description of the DVD series did not say Non-USA format - after I printed out what I had purchased, it was in small print in the bottom of the right hand corner, which I did not read. I did not read that, so it was my fault on that one, but when I called up the series, the first place I looked at it on your site did not say Non-USA format. I could not play it on my DVD player.  I double-checked and printed out that first page and sent it to the reseller, DaaVeeDee, and they only refunded about 3/4 of my money, after first suggesting that I buy a DVD player that plays Non-USA DVD's. I live in California, so that would seem to be a silly idea, since any movie I might buy here would be playable on my DVD player. I was buying something from a New Jersey company, so how could I be expected to know it wouldn't play on a Japanese made DVD player? This cannot be rated anything other than a very bad experience. However, thanks for re-teaching me that I need to be extremely careful about what I buy, even on a ""trusted site"" like Amazon. It cost me $40 to learn that lesson! I will not be buying any DVD's on Amazon again. I'm hoping you don't sell books in foreign languages without labeling them clearly?",1307664000,12,1224,4.142857142857143
2352861,5,B000A2U5GW,"Sharpe's Rifles is very well done. As a fan of British tv series I enjoyed this DVD collection very much. While it will not work on my standard dvd player both my computer and laptop play the disk well using Ubunut Linux. All one needs to do is run the program regionset and update the dvd drive settings by adding region 2.

This is an excellent buy and I thank Amazon for offering it.",1248393600,11,386,4.216216216216216
2352862,5,B000A2U5GW,"This review is here to cancel out the only other review on here. Sharpe's is a great series. The fact that this DVD set is a Region 2 release (Which it says right on the page) is not a valid reason for giving this product a 1-Star Review. That is the fault of the buyer. So I'm giving this excellent series a 5-Star Rating because it deserves it.

As for the Sharpe series, it is one of the best historical dramas out there. The acting, writing, and directing is brilliant. The only problem arises from the production values, which, while much higher than in your average TV series, limit the scale of conflicts to a couple of dozen men on each side. This isn't a problem in the beginning where Sharpe's leading a small unit of Chosen Men, but well before we get to Waterloo it feels a little weird. Costumes and sets however, look superb given the budget restrictions they must have been under. Not that you'd know from the American DVD release, which has simply transferred over the original VHS transfers. The quality of the DVDs here however is a completely different story. Released in the widescreen format it was originally filmed in the series' visuals are given a chance to shine which they could never have had on '90s TV screens.

Region free DVD players are not that expensive (and region unlocking software for your computer can be had for free without breaking any laws), so if you're interested in these DVDs this might be the way to go. Considering how expensive the American copies are it might even be cheaper.",1244073600,38,1528,4.572992700729927
2352863,1,B000A2U5GW,"I'm 61-that said, I was looking at the sale price and had no idea that there are ""regions"" when it comes to purchaing DVDs.  I had guests over to watch the Sharpe's series and low and behold no way to watch; no players to purchase locally; a huge disappointment and a lot of feeling really stupid that not one of us knew a thing about ""regions"".  I doubt any of us will purchase DVD online again since I'm now in dispute on paying the charges and have turned it over to my credit card company!  Buyer Beware...And we so wanted to enjoy these movies!",1233100800,6,549,4.259615384615385
2352904,5,B000A2U5GW,"It is notable that Arthur Wellesley, for whom the title ""Duke of Wellington"" was created, is constantly referred to by that title which was not given to him until about the end of the war.  It's a little like referring to the man known as General Eisenhower as ""President Eisenhower"" during World War II rather than after his election.

The poorly made nose on Wellesley for the first two episodes is a pity.  When I see those episodes, all I see is a block of dark plastic on the poor fellow's face.  After the change of actors for that part, the nose generally looks like a regular but somewhat prominent nose.

These issues aside, it's a great series.  Sean Bean makes a great Richard Sharpe and each episode is better than all the others, the way princesses outshine all their sisters in being more beautiful than each other.",1486857600,,829,4.5675675675675675

2352907,5,B000A2U5GW,"It is fun seeing the Sharpe series come to life, the casting is very good.  I wish I could have found the DVD's that were compatible with a USA player, but we are managing.  Good series and our purchasing experience was good.",1472688000,,225,4.333333333333333
2352908,5,B000A2U5GW,"Sean Bean excelled in this role. The series was extremely well filmed and well acted by a great cast. The stories were a bit over the top as expected, but very engaging. Sean is an excellent a leading man on the battle field and with the damsels he encounters during the Napoleonic wars in Spain and France. It was great to get the entire series in one package at a great price.",1470355200,,378,4.263888888888889

2352911,5,B000A2U5GW,"Through his decency, courage, and natural leadership, Sharpe overcomes class differences and rises to become a famous war hero.  This series is completely believable, has interesting historical evocations, and tells pulse-pounding stories of daring adventure.  It is great fun.  Bean is first rate, combining athletic physicality with stunning sexual charisma, to do some great acting.  This role made him a star.

In every episode, Sharpe faces some unbelievably stupid sod that thinks he is superior.  He also has some terrible obstacle to overcome, be it an enemy (within or without) or a mission, usually both.  While a first rate soldier, he has plenty of character quirks, such as the chip on his shoulder and his foibles with women.  Though formulaic at times, of the 15 episodes, there is only one that doesn't measure up.  There are also great characters that reappear, from the loyal men under his command, to arrogant aristocrats who would cheat to best him.

They made only a few of these each year, so each one has the quality of a film, yet tell an evolving story.  Sharpe starts out as an enlisted man of no background, rising on merit and daring alone.  He is lucky and driven, gaining promotions into the officer class against daunting odds, carefully taking risks to further his career.  He also has a series of intense relationships with women, some tragic, some catastrophies.  Finally, at the end, he marches to glory at Waterloo, under the eye of his mentor and admirer, the Duke of Wellington.  It is a fascinating look at career and class of that time, against the backdrop of the Peninsular War and defeats of Bonapart.

We were riveted by this for weeks.  It is TV at its best.  Warmly recommended.  Please note that this edition is European format.",1453680000,,1775,4.8762541806020065
2352912,5,B000A2U5GW,"We bought this version instead of the version with DVDs meant for the US because the image/video quality was supposed to be much better. It really is great! My husband had the US version when he was younger and said the video and sound quality are so much nicer with these.
They came packaged very well. We just had to change our DVD Player on his computer to the proper region to view it and we were good to go.
As far as the series, it's a very great historical series. I got it for my husband, who is a historian. I didn't think I'd really like it at all. But I was wrong. I absolutely love it. ""Over the hills"" will be stuck in your head! :)",1450137600,2,645,4.046875

2352947,5,B000A2U5GW,"The first time I saw one of the Richard Sharpe series of films was on A&E many, many years ago. I caught as many of them there as I could. Since then, I've read or bought most of the Bernard Cornwell novels as I could find, but always wanted the original British series. Then, when I finally found them here, imagine my surprise to learn they were what was called a Region 2 release and couldn't be played on American DVD players.

Fortunately, somebody wrote a review stating it was possible by downloading a free Video Lan Client (VLC) software from the internet and I could just Google it, which I did. It's available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, so I did and then ordered the complete series.

Of course, I have a multi-format ""zone free"" DVD so it works beautifully. That said, the movies are just as great as the first time I saw them. They did the Sharpe's Rifles books proud! Watching these movies is like seeing the Napoleonic War with the original cast. Great fun. Reading Bernard Cornwell's books doesn't detract from the movies, and the movies don't detract from the novels. This is just great fun, good acting and wonderful special effects.

While O'Brian deals with the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic wars, Cornwell concentrates on the Army.  The video series based on Cornwell's novels is excellent, although there are a lot of differences between the novels and videos.  ( I did not even realize beforehand that the principal actor, Sean Bean, also played the roles of Boromir (in Lord of the Rings) and Eddard Stark (in Game of Thrones).
