8139000,4,B000HDR8EG,"Despite the OTHER reviewer who mentions his Cop grampa arresting Al (???) Al Goldstein's show gives us insight into smut of the 80's and 90's without the attempt to make things ""clean and mainstream"" as porn now desperately tries to attempt. It's crass, vulgar, funny, informative and a lot of fun!",1275523200,9,298,4.862745098039215
8139001,3,B000HDR8EG,"I bought this expecting a little piece of history and documentary about an obscure TV show in NY City.  What I got was a very small piece of broadcasting history about a very vulgar and selfish man whom my Grandfather might have arrested way back in the day when he was one of NY's finest.

I'm all for freedom of speech, and I'm glad things like this could be made.  However, just b/c it can be made doesn't mean I have to enjoy it.  I'll keep it around just for my archives, but I doubt I'll ever watch it again.",1236470400,8,514,4.11
