6473165,5,B00L6AW2OK,As a huge Disney fan I loved this movie! I learned a few things I didn't know about Walt. Olan Rogers was fantastic! I would totally recommend giving this a watch.,1411344000,9,163,4.290322580645161
6473166,5,B00L6AW2OK,Great movie and cast. The whole family will enjoy. The movie is really saved when Olan Rodgers comes on the scene. I know its a low budget film but I still enjoyed the film.,1410566400,7,173,4.117647058823529

6473208,1,B00L6AW2OK,"Terrible acting, offensively inaccurate details about Walt's life, un-talented directing, but that's not all! It's even got an excruciatingly, embarrassingly, horrible soundtrack! This production is an unprecedented monument to human folly and stupidity. Do not waste your time with this horrible, horrible movie. ""Walt Before Mickey"" is a better movie about Walt's early life.",1461628800,,377,6.0
6473209,1,B00L6AW2OK,I gave it one star  because there was nothing lower.  Bad actors in a bad script that rambles on and on and goes no where except to boring !  I love Disney and found this to be a complete waist of my time.  If you want to see a good movie about the early years of Walt Disney's life watch Walt Before Micky.,1453334400,4,307,3.8253968253968256

6473213,1,B00L6AW2OK,"First off, I must make it clear from the beginning that I am a huge fan of Walt Disney, I've read several books about his life and career, and I consider myself fairly knowledgeable on the subject and therefor qualified to judge the merits of this film, as an alleged ""biography"" as well as a film on its own merits.

Anyone seriously interested in learning the true life of Walt Disney before he became successful and famous would do well to avoid this shlocky, treacly excuse of a movie.  Even allowing for the fact that biopics tend to be glossy and inaccurate, this movie is still a loser and a turkey.  It's so syrupy, with a lethal combination of bad writing and nauseatingly-corny dialog that sounds far too contemporary for the time in which it supposedly is set (kids of pre-WWI America would NEVER have addressed their fathers the way these 2 are portrayed as doing--certainly not with the way their real-life father truly was), full of cornball, hackneyed and contrived scenes, coupled with equally amateurish acting that doesn't even rise to the level of ""wooden"".  The performances--if so they can be called--are below grade-school play levels, as though they were simply reading lines for the first time without any thought as to what exactly they were supposed to be playing.  The kids playing the young Walt and his older broth Roy are especially bad, they make your teeth hurt every time they open their mouths to speak & you start longing for the laughing-gas or the Novocaine to get through their scenes.  The director, as I understand, mostly has experience as (I think) a documentary filmmaker.  If so, then he should return to that genre, since he obviously lacks the ability to direct actors, or to obtain anything worthy of the name ""performance"" from them.  (""Direction"" consists of something more than merely telling the actors when to start and stop reading their lines.)  Most unforgivably of all, the movie couldn't even get the most basic of biographical facts of Disney's life right--they portray him dreaming up what essentially became Disneyland about 20 years before the thought even first entered his mind--and they completely gloss over his very-difficult childhood as well (his childhood in real life bordered on abusive at times, in fact.)

So if you want to throw away good money on treacly, badly-written and badly-acted tripe passing itself off as a ""biography,"" hey, be my guest.  But my advice is to avoid it altogether, as far more interesting, compelling, informative, entertaining and ACCURATE chronicles of Disney's life may most definitely be found elsewhere.  (I recommend the recent American Experience documentary as a good place to start, even though that also got a few details wrong--but that's another story.)",1446336000,6,2764,4.984782608695652

6473215,4,B00L6AW2OK,"This was great. Sorta an abrupt ending, left you wanting more. But it was interesting and really fun to watch. Even the director's commentary was good!",1445558400,,151,4.846153846153846
6473216,1,B00L6AW2OK,Some of the worst acting I have ever seen.  I expected a lot more out of this.,1442016000,,78,3.588235294117647

6473228,2,B00L6AW2OK,"Unfortunately, Olan Rogers was the only good thing about this film. The production value was rather sloppy and the other actors were honestly horrifying at times. Olan shone as brightly as the star he should be and the script was actually very well written! But, bad actors and poor costuming were the two main things that sunk this docu-drama for me. I had high hopes :(",1431043200,,371,4.636363636363637
6473229,2,B00L6AW2OK,"We really were interested in watching this movie because we wanted to learn more about Walt Disney's early life.
This movie had some of the WORST acting we've ever seen and such a poor script....it was not meant to be funny, but it was because of that. Serious scenes totally ruined because of the bad acting.

I would have given it only one star, but it was an unexpected comic relief. So for that alone it was worth watching

They could have done so much with this subject! Very disappointing.",1428883200,,495,4.488888888888889

6473231,1,B00L6AW2OK,"We love Disney and were looking forward to this history of his life.  It ended up being full or religious content, and at times used Disney for religious lessons.  It is low quality in other aspects but a good story can over come quality in other areas, this was not the case here.  Too bad.  This ended up being a bad birthday purchase.  We will throw this away being watched only once.",1426204800,3,387,4.319444444444445

6473233,1,B00L6AW2OK,"By far the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I have seen better acting in a telanovela. I honestly tried, but I couldn't finish the movie. I waited for Thomas Olan Rogers to act because I heard the movie picked up from there. It just got worse. It's as if he tried and everyone else was randomly gathered off the streets before reading off cue cards. Watching the film I began to think I was wasting my life watching movies and I should do anything productive; clean my house, read a dissertation, volunteer at a soup kitchen... anything really. I think Olan should stick to the comedy sketches on YouTube. For nine dollars you would get much more satisfaction burning your money just for the thrill. I'm sorry if you watch this. It is truly terrible.",1424649600,5,758,4.460431654676259
6473234,5,B00L6AW2OK,I'd give more stars if I could. Great movie for all Walt Disney fans and dreamers,1423008000,,81,4.125
6473235,4,B00L6AW2OK,Pretty good indie film! I Bought it because my family and I are fans of Olan. This movie is Basically a short overview of Disney's youth and early career. I was sort of disappoint because I thought it would be his whole life. Still a great movie!,1421971200,,246,4.25531914893617
6473236,3,B00L6AW2OK,"Olan does a great job and so does the guy who plays Roy Disney, but the movie is paced really strangely and the parts of Walt Disney's life chosen to be portrayed is odd. Most of the actors are just sort of ok...worth a watch because I love Olan Rogers, but I'm not sure I would have bought it If I had rented it first",1421366400,,318,3.9076923076923076
6473247,2,B00L6AW2OK,"I am a BIG Olan Rogers fan. I've been watching and enjoying his videos on YouTube since 2010, and I have never lost interest. It's great to see him in a film and to see him branch off from the internet a bit. With that said, the movie sucked. If Olan Rogers was not in this, this movie would get a flat 1 star. Olan is the only actor I could really believe. That's what gave this 2 stars for me. I would love to give this a 5 star, but the movie just plain out doesn't cut it at all. I will never watch this film again, but I will continue to watch his vids.",1421280000,,558,3.8189655172413794
6473248,3,B00L6AW2OK,"The movie itself is eh. You can tell its a low budget film and most of the actors seem forced. The story is great though, and Olan Rogers is brilliant in it. I'm glad I purchased it, but I probably won't be watching it very often.",1421020800,,230,4.021739130434782
6473249,1,B00L6AW2OK,"This is pure Walt Disney propaganda. What a clunker! Amateur script, pitiful one-take acting. All in all, a terrible movie, one of the worst I've seen in 50 years of movie viewing. The cinematography was nice, though.",1420588800,2,217,4.891891891891892
6473250,3,B00L6AW2OK,"I love to read and watch things about Walt Disney.  I love learning the early years and what he had to do before he made it big.  This movie is decent.  Some of the acting is over the top.  I wish they went more in depth with Walt Disney's childhood.

If you don't have time to read a biography about Walt then buy this movie and learn something new.",1419379200,4,350,4.0144927536231885
6473251,5,B00L6AW2OK,Absolutely wonderful story of the young Walt Disney. My nephew produced and acted in it. Anyone who loves Disney should watch this to see the life of Walt before he made it big.,1417392000,,177,4.393939393939394
6473252,1,B00L6AW2OK,"Sorry, oh' I so WANTED this to be be a (low, or no) budget movie that had some spark of originality or something of interest. I understand no budget movies, but this video seemed to fail on every level. Casting, the worst choices. Country backwoods (Country singer)  narration, painfully terrible, and so out of place. It is possible to find little kid actors (even at no cost,) who actually have a talent to act, but these kids were painfully untalented. Writing was noting, no event of Walt Disney's amazing life was portrayed. Lighting, direction, set design, all of no note. Nothing would please me more to have one good word to say about this independent production, but it should have never been made by this group of grossly untalented filmmakers. After paying my $19, for the DVD, I'll be tossing it in the garbage.",1417132800,6,823,4.715277777777778

6473255,5,B00L6AW2OK,"I loves this movie. It has now become one of my new favorites. I bought this movie at Walmart and defiantly think it is worth more than I paid for it. I recommend this movie to anyone. It has a great story and love the actors they really portrayed the characters well. I laughed, cried, and over all could not stop smiling through out the entire film.",1414108800,3,351,4.253731343283582
6473256,1,B00L6AW2OK,"If you missed the local high school play you might want to watch this movie because there was likely no difference in the acting. (OK, your local high school WAS probably better.) I suppose it's unfair to lay all the blame on the acting since there wasn't much of a script to work with. The whole production is disjointed and ends before Disney does anything with his life. By the end of this video my family was heckling the movie and laughing at the acting. There are books about Disney's life that would be far more beneficial to a young person and certainly more enchanting than this film. If you want to inspire your child to reach for his/her dreams don't buy this film. Spend the money on a Disney movie or better yet, read a book.",1414022400,3,738,4.394160583941606

6473258,4,B00L6AW2OK,"Im going to be honest. It is a very ""B"" movie. Acting was pretty bad throughout and the  dialog was rushed in parts. But Olan was amazing n showed just how talented he was. Even though everything else besides Olan is terrible, still watch it! It's worth seeing the magic of Disney played by the one and only Olan Rogers!",1413158400,,320,4.333333333333333
6473259,1,B00L6AW2OK,"Well, it's a movie? I had pretty low expectations going into As Dreamers Do. I was thinking the quality would be on par with a Lifetime movie, over-acted, shallow, with at least a whisper of production value. Instead, As Dreamers Do starts out feeling like a high school drama production. Thankfully, the beginning of the movie is so bad I found myself crying with laughter, which actually kept me wanting more.

It wasn't until Olan Rogers comes on screen where things began to feel like a college drama production. Better, but still not close to what I was hoping for. Olan does a fair job. There were moments where I thought he nailed Walt's mannerisms, but overall his performance lacked nuance. In fact, all the performances lacked nuance. I couldn't be sure if the problem was the writing, the acting or both.

If you go into this movie expecting five star quality, you will be bitterly disappointed. However, watching the Behind the Scenes featurette clearly illustrates this was a labor of love and is a pure example of indie filmmaking. It's a situation where you begin to like someone you previously didn't like because you realize they have a family that loves them. With that said, the movie is still terrible, but I like As Dreamers Do because I love the spirit in which it was made. For some, that alone is worth supporting.",1412380800,3,1338,4.713675213675214
6473260,1,B00L6AW2OK,"My husband and I love biopics, and we were looking forward to this.  Unfortunately, it was stilted and awkward and had the most annoying narration you can imagine.  The actor playing the adult Disney wasn't too bad, but the writing was awful and a lot of the acting was awful.  We would love to see a good biography of Walt Disney.  Unfortunately, this wasn't it.",1411948800,3,363,4.538461538461538
6473261,3,B00L6AW2OK,"A well done faith based story of the life of Walt Disney before he became successful.  The first half was especially entertaining, the children were wonderful.  Olan Rogers did a good job playing the older Walt, but he certainly didn't look like he was 16 when he was playing Walt at that time.  It is a good family film and you get a chance to see Walt's early life before he went to Hollywood and became famous.  As a dreamer, Walt was lucky in his life that everyone supported his efforts.  Nice to see for a change.  Also you get to see how much he admired and looked up to his brother Roy.",1411689600,4,594,4.212389380530974

I was amazed by the production value the films producers were able to achieve on their limited budget.  The acting for the most part is top notch, especially notable is Olan Rogers.  I did find the performance of the actor portraying Ub Iwerks to be a little over the top, but I am not that familiar with Ub and this may have been an accurate portrayal of him. The behind the scenes shorts were very interesting.  Amazing use of a toy train and one antique vehicle!
