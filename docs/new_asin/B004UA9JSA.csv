8441339,4,B004UA9JSA,"I felt this movie was really good.  It was interesting to see Martin Sheen speaking Spanish.  At first I thought I had the wrong language selected on the dvd ;)  The movie does a pretty good job of developing the characters, but I was looking for a little more closure in the story line.",1400025600,,287,4.277777777777778
8441340,5,B004UA9JSA,Really enjoyed this hopeful film on the tough streets of Mexico City.  Boxing is used as the tool to get a young Mexican boy off the streets by a father and son from the US who have little in common.  Very good performances highlight the film.,1329696000,,243,4.260869565217392
