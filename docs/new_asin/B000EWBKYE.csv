8115057,3,B000EWBKYE,"This is a slow-paced documentary. Films about artists don't need to move along at a fast pace or include any action in order to gain our attention, but if a film is lacking in content, the presentation should be compelling. Paul Klee: The Silence of the Angel is a stiff, sub-par offering and will most likely disappoint the viewer who is already an admirer of Klee's imaginative, spirited work and artistic methods. It's filmed in timeline style, but feels unreasonably incomplete. What's even more surprising is that it doesn't offer much insight on the inner workings of Klee's mind. It's pretty evident that the filmmaker's main priority was in making the film aesthetically pleasing, but not particularly interesting or informative. It's a shame to see an outstanding artist laid to waste with such a cursory study.

The latter half of the disc is a slideshow exhibition of 150 drawings, paintings, and mixed media by Paul Klee. Fortunately, it allows you to the view the works at your own pace. I can only recommend this documentary to the viewer who hasn't read (or doesn't intend to read) any books about Klee.",1438905600,,1118,4.88421052631579
8115058,5,B000EWBKYE,"As a visual art student i found this DVD completely inspiring, after watching it i was itching to try out Klee's techniques, and spent the first two weeks ranting about how amazing he is and how clever he is. I don't think i could watch this DVD too many times its fantastic i wish all art movies were this great.",1364860800,2,313,4.233333333333333
8115059,5,B000EWBKYE,Fair price.  Prompt and well packed shipping.  The DVD is good.  Klee's art reflects early 20th century European politics and his contemporary artitsts more than I knew.,1356825600,,169,5.185185185185185
8115060,4,B000EWBKYE,"This DVD is for fans of Paul Klee.  Ever since I saw a small watercolor of his at the MFA in Boston, I have been obsessed with this artist for his draftsmanship and ability to relate art and music.  This DVD provides a great background to how the artist developed his methods of production and is a treat to those of us who are really entranced by his work.",1249689600,6,357,4.159420289855072
8115061,5,B000EWBKYE,"A soulful, utterly absorbing look at the world of Paul Klee. Not only does the film not shy from Klee's interior life, it revels in revealing it - through his paintings, journals, writings, drawings. Even Klee's extensive cataloguing habits are examined with love. I agree with another reviewer there has been no film like this made about an artist before. It's devastatingly fine, beautifully made. The film's riveting cohesion openly resembles Klee's paintings - Michael Gaumnitz's understanding of Klee's work is huge, and the rituals with which he attends his subject are profound. Presentation of the art is wondrously crafted. Every frame is a joy to watch and pulls the viewer deeper and deeper into the heart of Klee's own wonder. It's a remarkable experience indeed. To understand Klee, indeed to love him, is to see this perfectly revealing film. A hundred stars!",1197936000,14,873,5.111888111888112
8115062,5,B000EWBKYE,"Rarely does one come across a biographical film of an artist with such a beautiful melding of music (piano), color (the paintings) and narrative (historical photographs, films and voice overlay).  Gaumnitz's film shows Paul Klee's etchings and paintings in a biographical context with references to his musical and writing talents, his marriage and fatherhood, as well as his friendships, his professorial roles and the effect of Hitler's Germany on him and his work.  Gaumnitz shows the influence of Klee's travels to Tunisia and Italy on his use of color and on the subject matter of his paintings.  A wonderful segment illustrates a lesson from one of Klee's Bauhaus lectures seeking to achieve the illusion of movement through the use of a circle and a line. Klee's interests in physics and nature and his very accomplished musicianship helped shape his work as a painter. While Klee's work has always held a special appeal for me, Gaumnitz's film helped explain Klee's work and has made it even more interesting.  This film is highly recommended for anyone with an interest in Paul Klee and his work.",1193529600,19,1105,5.021857923497268
