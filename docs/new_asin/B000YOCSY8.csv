8373105,5,B000YOCSY8,"An absolutely brilliant video that gives a true to life and truthful narration of the development and production of the world famous, Marcello Gandini designed Lamborghini Diablo. Video was played back on my HD 120"" Stewart screen with 7.1 HT surround sound  on a $240,000/ super high end audio and video system. The video shows the Diablo breaking the world speed record back in 1990-91 when it first came out to replace the iconic Countach.  All the key people involved in the Diablo project are in the video which gets your adrenaline rushing and blood really pumping with excellent background music and the orgasmic Diablo engine roar. British narrator and possibly original video was British made and done with excellence. Possibly transferred later to DVD format and still holds your interest start to finish many times over. I own a 95 Diablo VT and a 01 Diablo VT 6.0& a 85 Countach. This video is a must have for Lamborghini Diablo owners and there are no more such DVDs available and getting more and more scarce like those beautiful exotics that made Lamborghini famous and a legendary super car",1396396800,,1106,4.8465608465608465
