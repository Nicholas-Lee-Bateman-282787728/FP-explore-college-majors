8019869,4,B00020W03I,"This DVD is a treasure trove of overviews and actual travel trailers, some restored, some waiting, some inbelievably rare! The DVD is short, but just seeing all of these great old masterpieces which are a slice of American history is a wonderful treat.  The photography is great, and we do see some wonderfully restored-to-original trailers, as well as some with modern modifications for the comfort seeking traveler, who still wants the vintage look. Definitely work the low purchase price for such a wonderful trip back in time.",1167782400,6,530,5.091954022988506
