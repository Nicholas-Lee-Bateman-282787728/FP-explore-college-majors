No worries about bad language here. A Herbie movie makes for a great family night or Saturday afternoon movie. My kids now look for ""Herbies"" when we're driving around town. I think we see a 60 something VW once a week or so. I highly recommend this set to anyone with kids.",1341360000,,436,4.329268292682927
3787433,5,B001SXZ7SI,"I ordered this DVD movie for my grandson, I was very happy that it arrived so fast. When you order something for a kid and they check the mail everyday and ask is it coming in today, is it coming in today, you sure are glad when it gets here. I'm very happy and would recommend the company and would use again.  Melba Hyatt",1337126400,,323,4.046875

3787436,5,B001SXZ7SI,"This is a classic movie set from Disney.

It is one of those that doesn't have swearing, has a lot of fun action and adventures, and shows everyone dressed with maybe a chaste kiss on the cheek. In other words, this is a movie that all ages can enjoy again and again. You don't have to worry about what your children will think and/or learn when you let them watch this movie. You don't have to worry about offending your grandparents if the children are watching this movie. Yet that doesn't make it boring.

Herbie, also known as the Love Bug, is a little race car that wins races at impossible odds. The car has his own personality and is a large part of the movie. In fact without the car, there wouldn't be a movie. The car winks and honks and starts and stops and even steers itself at times.

Of course, Don Knots only adds ot the fun in Herbie goes to Monte Carlo. With is madcap humor and willingness to be the clumsy idiot- he helps make that movie a classic.

This is one of my favorites and I only wish they had made more along the same lines.
Completely worth every penny.
Enjoy.",1316649600,,1092,4.260869565217392

3787438,4,B001SXZ7SI,"Two classic Disney comedies for a sweet price!

Bundled together in this set are two of Disney's beloved ""Love Bug"" comedies.  Herbie, the super-smart VW beetle was first introduced in Disney's ""The Love Bug"" in 1968.  The film became a surprise box-office smash all over the world and delighted audiences with it's unique charm and spirit.  The studio later readied their 'star car' for the first of several sequels - HERBIE RIDES AGAIN.

In HERBIE RIDES AGAIN (1974), we pick up the story several years after the events of ""The Love Bug"".  Tennessee Steinmetz has left Herbie in the care of his grandmother (Helen Hayes) in San Francisco, a feisty old lady who lives in the same rambling old firehouse with lodger Nicole (Stefanie Powers).  But Mrs Steinmetz looks set to lose her beloved home thanks to greedy property developer Alonzo Hawk (Keenan Wynn), so Herbie and Alonzo's meek nephew Willoughby (Ken Berry) must race to the rescue!

The character of Alonzo Hawk had originally appeared in ""The Absent-Minded Professor"", and it was a stroke of genius to have him cross over into the Herbie franchise.  Originally, Walter Brennan was to have starred (as a male version of the Helen Hayes character) but was seriously ill at the time.  Stefanie Powers and Ken Berry make a cute couple, and the film makes good use of the streets and bays of San Francisco.

Dean Jones makes his long-overdue return as Jim Douglas in HERBIE GOES TO MONTE CARLO (1977).  Throwing continuity to the wind, Jim (now strangely single again--there is no mention of the Michele Lee character!) and his new co-driver Wheely Applegate (Don Knotts) take Herbie to compete in the prestigious Monte Carlo race--complicated by bumbling jewel thieves who hide a precious gem in Herbie's gas tank and a sleek blue Lancier who sets Herbie's heart all a-flutter.

Julie Sommars co-stars as Jim's new love interest, with Bernard Fox, Roy Kinnear, Jacques Marin and a pre-""Young and the Restless"" Eric Braeden.",1249948800,6,1980,4.945619335347432
8340151,5,B001SXZ7SI,Classic movie on Blue Ray!!! My kids love these movies a bit reluctant at first but once they get into it they laugh and laugh.  In an age where cursing and partial nudity reign its nice that these classics are being rereleased onto the new formats.,1522886400,,249,4.413043478260869

8340158,3,B001SXZ7SI,"The first movie was very good.  Herbie Rides Again was better than I thought.  I give it 3 and 1/2 stars.  Herbie Goes To Monte Carlo is okay, I give it 3 stars.  So overall this set gets 3 and 1/2 stars.

I like the older lady in Rides again, how a corrupt man is trying to get her evicted from her home, so they can sell her property for his greedy project.  Herbie is protective of her, and I thought it was pretty good Herbie style.

Herbie Goes To Monte Carlos is okay, Dean Jones and Donn knotts teaming up I thought would be enough to root for, but Dean Jones played a woman free character and this wasn't as likeable as the first movie.",1360540800,,644,4.063492063492063
