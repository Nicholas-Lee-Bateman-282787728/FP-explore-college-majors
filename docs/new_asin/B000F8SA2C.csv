8119114,4,B000F8SA2C,We are farily new to ballroom dancing and wanted to learn the Cha Cha Cha.  This was one of the few DVD's that included it. We found the instruction easy to follow.,1283299200,,164,4.125
8119115,1,B000F8SA2C,Presentation and music selections made it difficult to learn from this video.  Also the menu selections (e.g. play all) were incomplete or didn't work properly.,1222473600,2,160,5.4
8119116,1,B000F8SA2C,"Poorly presented - instructors and videography. Many fundamentals, such as basic body positions, are absent or minimally explained.",1202342400,3,131,6.333333333333333

8119118,5,B000F8SA2C,I had this on VHS not too long ago. Buying the DVD for sure.  It is great and I remember thinking it would be better to forward and reverse if it's on DVD.  It is 2 DVDs so I don't think the price is bad considering the instruction was easy and informative.,1176076800,2,257,3.923076923076923
