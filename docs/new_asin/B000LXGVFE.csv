8319181,3,B000LXGVFE,"This film was made in 1973 which was a period when Indian film makers & musicians were doing a lot of experimenting, copying of western styles, and generally trying to find themselves. This film has elements of Elvis movies, hippie movies, gangster movies, you name it. Plus a couple of great songs. The acting is basically awful, the editing bites, the cinematography -arrgh ! It is NOT a good movie, but it IS entertaining.",1222128000,2,425,4.756756756756757
