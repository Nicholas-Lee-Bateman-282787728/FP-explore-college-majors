8360932,2,B0007N1K1S,"I purchased this DVD because I haven't fish much in years. It was not much help and far to basic. It may be OK for someone who doesn't no anything about fishing but not much new info if you have any knowledge at all about it!

It goes a little slow and spends a lot of time on safety ie life jackets, don't go out in a storm, etc. that is not why I purchased this, I purchased it to learn more about fishing!

I also purchased the Nearshore Boating & Fishing and When Fish Won't Bite, I wouldn't recomend the three of them, a lot of the same info is repeated on all three such as the same wasted time on all of the safety issues, (a little of that would have been ok but there was quite a lot of time spent on the topic, it seemed like they were just trying to take up time) also the same knots repeated at great length, etc.

Maybe for the novice there is some helpful info but in my opinion not much and just not worth the money!",1222732800,,931,3.9414893617021276
