8423286,2,B004CNK5CO,"This appears to be complete as the movie was intended, but the story isn't very complete even though it is all there....if that makes any sence...

 No ""secret"" is ever revealed so we never know what the hulabaloo is all about, and a couple times near the end the story leaps too far. Was there a deadline that made the end product suffer? Knowing the time the movie runs I was perplexed how they would end it with so little time remaining thus the movie ends fairly abrubptly. They spent agonizing moments on needless footage on the river, (though in an of itself the river footage was fine,) but they let the story or editing suffer... In hindsight it is peiceable together and comprehensable, but clearly this needed another reel or two. I get the distict impression this a rush job to complete the picture on time or something...Some scenes are paced at normal time and some points leap so much we have to catch up mentaly with the story. But even then the story suggests mysteries and dark secrets but never satisfies the curiosity.
  The sound and footage as a silent is pretty good...and it has most or all the original dialogue cards. The movie uses blue and sepia tints, though not nessesarily depicting out door and indoor scenes but apparently used randomly...again suggesting an inexperienced editor or director unable to properly alot time for sequences thus the whole movie suffers as aa result.",1369094400,,1409,4.738775510204082
