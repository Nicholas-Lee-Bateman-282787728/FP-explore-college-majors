500132,4,6302717256,"One of the few movies in which the spirit of once esteemed author turned  screenwriter, F. Scott Fitzgerald, is evident.  A rather simple story of post-war Germany; a trio of war vets adjust to life after the war and share their affection for the dying, tubercular Patricia.  Robert Taylor seems less than thrilled with his role and the tight-lipped Franchot Tone is probably conscious of how awful he is!  Those who hold affection for this movie generally cherish the beautiful performance of the elfin Margaret Sullavan in one of her best roles as the dying Patricia Hollman.  Slender and special, Sullavan was unique among Hollywood actresses of the day; she was not conventionally beautiful but she had something better - genuine acting ability plus a voice that could send chills up and down your spine. Sullavan hailed from Virginia where she was born in 1911. A non-conformist, the stage-trained Sullavan was brilliant yet insecure and she disliked Hollywood immensely, therefore she did not fit the stereotype of actresses of the day (rather like a less ambitious version of Bette Davis) Admittedly schmaltzy entertainment for sentimentalists, this Frank Borzage film handed Sullavan the New York Critics Award for Best Actress for this and was nominated for BA, alas Davis took Oscar home that year for her portrayal of Julie Marsden in JEZEBEL.",996537600,5,1354,5.108597285067873
500133,4,6302717256,"Erich Maria Remarque's novel receives a first-class treatment from MGM in this 1938 film, which was directed by Frank Borzage from a screenplay by F. Scott Fitzgerald and Edward E. Paramore.  The ""Three Comrades"" are three young German soldiers--Erich Lihkamp (Robert Taylor), Otto Koster (Franchot Tone), and Gottfried Lenz (Robert Young)--who are searching for a reason to live in post-World War I Germany.  The trio are also bound by their love for Patricia Hollmann (Margaret Sullavan), a young girl dying of tuberculosis.  Her illness and the general unrest in Germany combine to dampen the youthful spirits of the three young men in this love story that will remind older people of ""La Boheme"" and younger ones of ""Rent.""
I came across ""Three Comrades"" because I read about its rather infamous ""deleted scenes.""  Fitzgerald's original script had explicitly excoriated Nazi Germany.  There were scenes in which a poor Jew proclaims his love for Germany, a rich Jew refuses to cheat the three comrades, and one in which the Nazis burned books (including those by Remarque).  Of course, the Hays Office censored all of these scenes and made MGM remove most of the political references.  The end result is a love story in which the additional pathos of a world heading back to war has been stripped away.  The performances by Taylor and Sullavan are affective, and the supporting cast of Guy Kibbee, Lionel Atwill, Henry Hull, Charley Grapewin and Monty Woolley is excellent, although none of them seem particularly Teutonic.  A decent love story, ""Three Comrades"" could have held a more prominent place in cinema history.",992131200,9,1624,5.09811320754717

Scott Fitzgerald, his only screen credit. Not surprisingly, it's about the Lost Generation who came of age during World War I, and she elevates the movie into something quite magical as Patricia Hollmann, a beautiful aristocrat fallen on hard times and dying of tuberculosis. She becomes the center of gravity for three close war buddies eking out a living fixing cars and driving a cab in a pre-Hitler Germany torn asunder by unemployment and economic strife. The main focus of the story is on the unbridled love that develops between Patricia and Erich, the most openly nave of the three and probably the most in need of purpose in his life.

500152,5,6302717256,"A romantic glow hangs over this beautiful picture like a San Francisco fog over the Golden Gate Bridge. The story is based on the fine novel by Erich Maria Remarque and was adapted to the screen by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Frank Borzage was the perfect choice as director for this story of three German WWI expatriates who have bonded for life and the tubercular waif they all love in different ways. It has all the great romanticism Borzage was famous for bringing to his art. Three Comrades concluded his trilogy of otherworldly love intruded upon by war begun in the silent era with Seventh Heaven, and continuing when sound came along in A Farewell to Arms. A sense of impending tragedy even during the happier scenes creates what one might call romantic noir in one of the most romantic films ever made.

Robert Taylor portrays Erich, the younger and more innocent of the three comrades. Robert Young is Gottfried, an idealist angry at the post-war rise of fascism. And Franchot Tone, in one of his finest roles is Otto, the world-weary pragmatist. Their lives are changed forever when they meet up with the fragile Margaret Sullavan. She gave the finest performace of her career as the sweet and courages Pat, dying of tuberculosis but with just time enough left for Taylor to fall in love with her.

Each of the comrades falls in love with her in other ways as well, the threesome becoming a foursome, a makeshift family trying to keep fate at bay just a little while longer. It is a romantic film with a luminous performance from Sullavan you will always remember. Borzage creates a sense of doom underneath every light and happy moment the comrades share together, the romantic glow growing a little dimmer as destiny looms like a storm cloud just over the next hill.

You will rarely see a film so full of love, as Sullavan imparts to each of them what they need and in turn receives two friends who love and cherish her, and one who loves her even more. Tone gives his weary character considerable depth. Taylor's Erich is likable as the young brash member of friends, somewhat lost after the war is over and still a bit naive. Robert Young gives another solid performance as he captures the anger and restlessness of a world that has just come out of a war, yet finds itself moving in that direction again.

This was Remarque and Fitzgerald at their best, two great writers complementing each other. Director Frank Borzage brought a sensitivity and romanticism to his art few have ever matched. Margaret Sullavan gives the greatest performance of her career, her own life as fragile as Pat's, ending tragically years later. The final shot of Three Comrades is not one easily forgotten. If you love the magic of film, and enjoy the romanticism only film can bring to our hearts, then this is a must see masterpeice from a director who painted more than one such portrait in his career behind the camera. Beautiful.",1251763200,19,2921,4.69921875
500153,4,6302717256,"THREE COMRADES (1938)

Featuring a wonderful and thoughtful screenplay by F. Scott Fitzgerald, adapted from the novel by WW1 veteran Erich Maria Remarque. It would later be used by Michael Cimino as a loose outline for his film THE DEER HUNTER (1978)

Robert Taylor, Franchot Tone and Robert Young play veteran German pilots at the end of WW1. Taylor is the romantic, Tone the practical cynic and Young the frustrated idealist, unhappy with the direction that Germany is heading.

There is a wonderful scene in the beginning where the three friends are drinking and celebrating the wars end. A soldier comes up to Tone and tells him his plane is to be decommissioned and scraped. Tone walks outside and lovingly runs his hand along the body of the war ravaged plane. He drops a grenade into the cockpit and walks away, the plane exploding. This would be sentimental nonsense in anyone elses hands but Tone, who projects much complexity in this scene with just a nice subtle facial expression.

Several years go by and the friends become mechanics in post war Germany. While people become hungry and compete for jobs and food, while the political scene starts to shift around them, their friendship endures. Then they befriend Margaret Sullavan. A former aristocrat fallen on hard times and secretly dealing with a mysterious illness. She and Taylor fall hard for each other. Tone and Young also become protective of Taylor and Sullavans love as it seems to be the only ""good"" thing in a world slowly starting to tear itself apart. The movie has some beautiful countryside scenery, a wonderful quaint look.

Its a great movie about love, loyalty and friendship. Sacrifice and tragic loss. Taylor and Sullavan have great chemistry. Young has the lesser role of the three friends, but he makes a big impact in the film none the less. Franchot Tone is brilliant in a scene where he seeks bloody vengance in front of a church on a wintery evening, christmas hymns playing in the backround.

The movie takes its time telling the story of the friendship between the four principles, but the film really draws you in and you really care about the characters. It is really a delightful and entertaining movie.

Again, I highly recommend this one.",1242345600,3,2237,4.8556430446194225
500154,5,6302717256,"Well-done heartbreaker scripted (partly) by F. Scott Fitzgerald - and the only picture he worked on where he was so credited (though to his anger much of the dialogue he wrote was ultimately changed). Set in Germany right after WW I, Margaret Sullavan plays the heart-throb of three returning German soldiers (Robert Taylor, Franchot Tone, and Robert Young), who now are partners in an auto repair company. Although all three of them love Sullavan, it's a testament to their friendship that when she decides to marry Taylor, the other two are actually happy for him. The tragedy comes in the fact that Sullavan is suffering from TB and hasn't much time to live. Sullavan is wonderful and this is one of her best performances on film. Her throaty voice and eloquence are most effective and are impossible not to respond to. The ending, after she dies (Young has died, too, in a street demonstration), with Tone and Taylor appearing together with the ""ghosts"" of the other two, is a beautiful final sequence. Very romantic, very enjoyable.",1149206400,,1037,4.8977272727272725
500155,4,6302717256,"Franchot Tone, Robert Young and Robert Taylor star as three young German friends who survive the rigors of World War One, and stick together as business partners during the economic hard times that followed. In many ways, this is an explicit continuation of the better-known ""All Quiet On The Western Front."" It is also based on the work of novelist Erich Maria Remarque and also presents an atypically sympathetic view of the Germans who took part in the war (at least of the common soldiers...) This film deals less with the horrors of war than with its social aftermath, and with the collision of Germany's cultural rigidity with an emerging modern world, at times stifling, and at others liberating. Nazism is dealt with somewhat elliptically; one of the three friends is a left-wing idealist and runs afoul of a right-wing mob, leaving the other two to pick up the pieces. Raw stuff for the time, but ultimately not the whole story. The film was decidedly behind its own times: even though open hostilities had not broken out with the German Reich, by the late 1930s World War Two was all but inevitable, and the film's ending, in which our heroes abandon the charred husk of the Old World for the romantic horizons of the New, is simply wishful thinking. By the time this film came out, walking away from the mistakes of the past was hardly an option: the spectre of war had already reared again, and was hardly going to let these young men out of its clutches. Still, if you completely ignore the reality of the times the film was produced in, this succeeds finely as a conventional tragedy-romance. F. Scott Fitzgerald apparently started the script, which was the only screenplay he himself wrote, but it was taken away from him at the last minute, after the producers decided his lofty philosophical musings were too dense to translate into Hollywood boxoffice success.",1040947200,22,1878,4.799382716049383
500156,5,6302717256,"This is a poignant movie adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's  novel about three life-long friends in post World War I Germany and beautifully filmed by cinematographer and four-time Oscar winner Joseph Ruttenberg (""Waterloo Bridge"", ""The Philadelphia Story""). I read somewhere that this is a movie that MGM ran into some problems in its production because it was considered  by some to be a war-mongering story. For this film version to be approved by the Hollywood production code in 1938, the political presence had to be toned down. Audiences will not see  Nazi emblems and mention of Hitler and other Nazi leaders are noticeably absent. Remarque's novel have dealt harshly with the rise of Nazism in Germany in using it as a backdrop for a love story about three ex-soldiers, Erich Lohkamp (played by Robert Taylor) and his wife-to-be Patricia 'Pat' Hollman (Margaret Sullavan), who is dying from tuberculosis...and Erich's two friends, Otto Koster (played by Franchot Tone) and Gottfried Lenz (Robert Young), who share their fondness for Pat. The upheaval that is happening in Germany at that time were adequately represented, although there is no denying that it suffered from the censorship.
This is Margaret Sullavan's movie. The slight and delicate actress had the most convincing performance in this film. She only made sixteen films (not surpirising, since she's really a stage actress) but on all these films she  reputedly left an indelible mark on each and every one of them...and that is plain to see here. Director Frank Borzage would light up and close in on her pretty smiling face and her breathy, husky voice would give cheeriness in an otherwise tempestous period.
Ably directed by two-time Academy Award winner Frank Borzage, and with some suitably Teutonic flavored music from multiple Oscar winner Franz Waxman, this is one film genre of the pre WWII period that will always be worthwhile to see.",1005955200,15,1921,5.127795527156549

Like all films of that time which were set in Germany, it misses the mark in the history department. However, as a great love story and tale of honor among friends, it offers a  strong script and superb performances. F. Scott Fitzgerald was involved in the writing and it shows. There are many beautiful moments. I love this film and consider it one of my favorites.  Sullavan and Tone gave perhaps the best performances of their careers. Taylor, Young and Kibbee did a fine job also. The relationships between the men represent the military camaraderie of that time in America. The use of music in this film to set the mood is wonderful. Frank Borzage was known for being great with sentimental films and this was no exception. As the director, he kept the emotional pull going from start to finish and a great film was the result. There is a lot of spiritual symbolism which you will notice if you look for it. This is a must for people who love the films of the thirties.

7829986,5,6302717256,"In 1938, the political situation in Europe was rapidly deteriorating as the maniacal demon Adolph Hitler cast the black veil of Nazism across the continent first with the Anschluss and then later the Munich Crisis.  Against this grim background, the film ""Three Comrades"" opened, a picture of postwar Germany, in the first troubled years of the doomed Weimar Republic.  Based on a 1937 novel by Erich Maria Remarque, the three comrades are young German soldiers who fight together in World War I, and despite a fatalistic attitude at the surrender try to make a life together afterwards.  They are the pragmatic, paternal Otto Koster (Franchot Tone), the idealistic Gottfried Lenz (Robert Young) and the callow Erich Lohkamp (Robert Taylor) who is like a younger brother to the other two.  Together they open a taxi and auto repair shop, and just about scrape by in the depressed German economy.  The trio's one luxury is the car they jointly own, known by the affectionate moniker ""Baby"".  One Sunday to celebrate Erich's birthday they drive ""Baby"" out to a country inn where they meet the young, lovely Patricia Hollmann (Margaret Sullavan), a worldly though impoverished aristocrat.  All three men are entranced by her charm, but Erich seems to make the strongest impression with Pat.  She is touched by his naivet and despite her sophistication falls in love with his simple goodness.  However their happiness is shadowed by Pat's condition, she is recovering from tuberculosis which has played havoc with her permanent health, and she is in remission not cured.  Under these circumstances, Pat is reluctant to marry Erich, although she is deeply in love with him, but Otto persuades her.  Their joy is fleeting however when Pat suffers a serious relapse and must retreat to a sanatorium in the Alps.  While Otto and Erich desperately try to earn enough to pay the mounting bills, Gottfried becomes dangerously involved in the precarious political situation.

One of the reasons ""Three Comrades"" is noteworthy is that it's the one screen credit that acclaimed author F. Scott Fitzgerald earned.  Regrettably screenwriting was not his forte, and only about a third of the finished screenplay belongs to him, Fitzgerald was considered too literary and wordy by producer Joseph Mankiewicz, who also was an excellent writer and along with screenwriter Edward E. Paramore Jr. wound up rewriting the script.  However, ""Three Comrades"" is more diluted than the actual novel which covered almost a ten year period from the end of the war to the rise of Nazism.  The film concludes in 1922, and the gangs of thugs that play a part in it are never clearly identified as to their political affiliation, although it's presumed they're Nazis.  It wasn't until 1940 that MGM had the courage to take on the Nazis in the excellent ""The Mortal Storm"" also starring Miss Sullavan and Mr. Young.

The three men playing the comrades give good performances particularly Franchot Tone whose Otto is the father figure for all the others including Pat, and on whom they all rely on for advice.  Robert Young although affable and likeable on screen was rather lightweight, here gives one of his better portrayals as the ill-fated Gottfried.  It seems as if Robert Taylor needed to play against superb actresses to draw out his acting talent, in ""Camille"" it's Garbo, in ""Waterloo Bridge"" it's Vivien Leigh, here Margaret Sullavan does the trick.  Several reliable supporting players, Monty Woolley, Guy Kibbee, Charley Grapewin , Henry Hull and Lionel Atwell  do well in minor roles.

Still, make no mistake, what makes this film so memorable all these many years later and worth a viewing is the star performance of the unforgettable Margaret Sullavan.  This was the second in a quartet of roles as German women from the Weimar Republic through the Nazi era, the first ""Little Man, What Now?"", followed by ""The Mortal Storm"" and ""So Ends Our Night"", this last also based on a Remarque novel.  In addition this marked a reunion of Miss Sullavan with director Frank Borzage who had previously directed her in ""Little Man, What Now?"", and would direct her afterwards in ""The Shining Hour"" and ""The Mortal Storm"".  Margaret Sullavan was a unique, special actress,  writer David Shipman in his book ""The Great Movie Stars: the Golden Years"" described her as ""an enchantress pitched in terms of magnetism and personality somewhere (curiously enough) between the two Hepburns.""  That's just about right, she also possessed one of the most singular speaking voices in films, it's warm, throaty cadences and inflections labeled as ""liquid diamonds and sand"", again very apt.

In her portrayal of the noble, self-sacrificing Pat Hollmann, Miss Sullavan could easily tip the scale toward bathos, but she turns in a delicately shaded performance, beautifully realized full of subtle nuance and detail.  Her final scenes are particularly touching and will tug at your heartstrings.  Miss Sullavan was justly rewarded as the Best Actress of 1938 by the New York Film Critics Circle and also as recipient of the Picturegoer Gold Medal, but although nominated the Best Actress Oscar eluded her, going instead to Bette Davis' more febrile, flamboyant role in ""Jezebel"", what a pity!  She missed out on two key  career making roles;  first the unnamed second Mrs. DeWinter in the 1940 film ""Rebecca"" despite a screen test and being a strong contender, later on she would turn down the role of Blanche du Bois in the original Broadway production of ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", both were infinitely poorer for her absence.  Other missed opportunities would be two F. Scott Fitzgerald characters; she would have been the perfect Daisy Buchanan in ""The Great Gatsby"" and ditto Nicole Diver in ""Tender Is the Night"".  This is an actress that needs to have a major retrospective.  Margaret Sullavan's film oeuvre is slim, just 16 films, but she illuminated each one with her artistry, being  a sure mistress of both comedy and drama. This is evidenced not only by ""Three Comrades"" and the superior soap opera, ""Back Street"", but also the zany ""The Moon's Our Home"" with ex-husband Henry Fonda and best of all the delightful, enchanting 1940 Ernest Lubitsch film ""The Shop Around the Corner"", with her most frequent and perfect co-star, James Stewart.",1371340800,,6306,5.045323047251688
