8109414,4,B000EGDC3M,"This gives a good overview of Roman North Africa, which at its zenith spanned 1,500 miles and whose prosperity exceeded that under Carthage. This prosperity is reflected in the late 2nd century when a large portion of the Roman senate, even an emperor, were North African.

Much detail is on agriculture and buildings as it was a time of great expansion and construction into an area with little resistance and technology, but filled with opportunity.

Religion is also covered, how the Romans simply adopted Punic gods of Baal and Tanit, as Saturn and Juno respectively. The growing number of Christians who refused to worship these false gods were killed in colosseums such as in El Jem (Tunisia).

Historians provide most of the commentary and site photography gives an excellent feel for what the civilisation would have been like.",1441152000,,835,5.036231884057971
8109415,3,B000EGDC3M,"I gave this DVD three stars because I think it is a little pricey for the content.  The DVD starts with Rome after the third Punic War basically deciding to get rid of Carthage once and for all and take up a permanent residence.  Lesson here, you NEVER want to be a neighbor of Rome.  The DVD has interspersed commentaries by different professors which is good because it gives an explanation of why Rome ended up in North Africa and the many benefits Rome derived from North Africa.  Roman history enthusiasts will probably not learn anything new from the commentaries, but the real strenght of the DVD is the VISUALS.  The footage of the ruins, some of them still in amazing condition.  The DVD really focuses on Carthage, Dugga, and two other cities / centers when addressing the Roman presence. (Note - this DVD does not address anything about Egypt.)  You really don't learn about the North Africans or their societies or the impact on them from the Romans showing up, but as always, this is about the Romans.  Again the strength of this DVD is the video footage of the actual cities /sites and the maps are helpful also.  There are also some decent CGI recreations of the cities.  The DVD does a good job of tying the archeology of the sites to the history of the sites.  And as the DVD points out, Rome only needed to station one legion in all of North Africa to - ""keep the peace."" The DVD does highlight how some ""North African Romans"" rose to Senator status and even Emporer Severus.  If given a choice between residing in Rome or one of the wealthy North African cites, I choose North Africa.  (Sorry Trier...too cold).",1274659200,4,1630,4.541095890410959
8109416,3,B000EGDC3M,"Had finished ""The Fall of Carthage"".  So I was looking for more info. on the battles between these two powers and the aftermath.  I was longing for more after viewing this.  Hence only three stars.",1221782400,,197,4.571428571428571
8109417,5,B000EGDC3M,This presentation covers the Roman occupation of North Africa roughly from the fall of Carthage to the coming of the Vandals (although it refers to the Muslims). The commentary is very clear and many important Archaeological sites are shown in some detail. As a summary of important aspects of the occupation it is very good.,1179100800,7,325,4.927272727272728
