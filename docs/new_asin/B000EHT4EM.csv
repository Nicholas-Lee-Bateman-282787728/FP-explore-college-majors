8110364,4,B000EHT4EM,"Wasn't so bad. I got this because I'm a fan of Lisa Lutz's books. I thought it was okay. Not the worst movie I've ever seen, and had some laugh-out-loud moments.",1413763200,,161,4.225806451612903
8110365,5,B000EHT4EM,Great film to see before retiring for the night.  You will go to bed laughing and all relaxed.  No dreams but funny ones if you do.  Diane Keaton is so funny!!,1375142400,,159,4.064516129032258

8110367,1,B000EHT4EM,"The director of this ridiculous film should be drummed from the Film Academy and the Script writer indicted for malpractice.  Diane Keaton is a great actress and Paul Sorvino has an excellent body of work to point to but why these two high quality professionals agreed to perform this abortion which I refuse to call a movie much less a film, is beyond comprehension.  Keaton is a wonderful actress who is totally wasted here as she trembles, screeches, and twitches her way through her part as a reluctant hitman.  Sorvino is surrounded by the largest group of numbskulls this side of a Laurel and Hardy skit.  There is nothing funny or original about this movie and it is embarrassing to watch the cast disgrace themselves trying to make this screenplay work -- If there was ever a movie where the audience should demand their money back -- this is it.  Keaton and Sorvino should expunge this piece of dreck from their resume. Why I gave it one star I have no idea -- it deserves a minus star",1188086400,3,994,4.561797752808989

8110369,2,B000EHT4EM,"PLAN B has the appearance of a quickly made, unedited, sloppy script for a movie with the attempt for an outing for the actors involved - an outing that should have been nixed from the start. It is just another Mafia-based 'comedy' that has nothing new and lowers the standard for those participating.

Joe Maloni (Paul Sorvino) is the crime boss more concerned about clothing and appearances than about his business of control.  His personal assistant Mario (Anthony DeSando) is dumber than dirt and his ignorance is supposed to be funny.  Maloni has whacked one of his debtors (who just happens to be married to bookish Fran - Diane Keaton) and Maloni takes Fran on as his assistant to work off her dead husband's debt by being Maloni's 'hit man'. Fran is afraid of her own shadow and is unable to carry out Maloni's assignments, electing instead to transport her 'whackees' to Florida to hide at her brother James' house until she can figure out what to do next.  This alternative to killing the three candidates is called Plan B, Plan A being to kill them!  The ending is wholly predictable just as is every line assigned in teh script to the characters.

Diane Keaton has made a lot of fine films and is one of our most talented actresses and comediennes, but here she screams and rants and twitches her way through a ridiculous part that quickly becomes annoying to watch.  Paul Sorvino is, well, the Paul Sorvino type cast from other mobster films.  The supporting cast is likewise allowed to play to the balcony in the broadest slapstick, pratfall fashion imaginable.  What is supposed to be a comedy ends up being just silly and overdone.  Director Greg Yaitanes needs to go back to TV sitcoms: had this flimsy story been compressed into a half-hour gig it might have had a chance.
