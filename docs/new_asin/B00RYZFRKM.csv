6936714,5,B00RYZFRKM,Lucy steals this movie from Hope.  She was nominated for a Golden Globe in 1960 for best actress in a comedy.  She was overlooked for an Oscar.,1448496000,,143,4.2592592592592595
6936715,5,B00RYZFRKM,Enjoyed this movie very much. Surprisingly romantic yet funny. Bob Hope and Lucille Ball make a very believable couple. Lucille's wardrobe is beautiful too. I would recommend it.,1448064000,,178,5.392857142857143
6936716,5,B00RYZFRKM,"I am a life long Lucy and Bob Hope fan, so of course am very fond of this movie.  I hadn't even known of it's existence for that many years.  I happened across it on TCM and was so happy to see an 'undiscovered' (by me anyway) movie, that I was sorry I hadn't recorded it.  Finding it out on DVD was great.  It's not an out and out comedy, but can get quite serious at times.  No real slapstick here.  A good, believable story with good acting.  It's just enjoyable all around.",1444435200,,477,4.064516129032258
6936717,4,B00RYZFRKM,"1960 seems so very long ago. This was a movie that, for reasons I won't go into, really struck home. It definitely shows a time when things were so different, don't get me wrong cheating is cheating but to see the degrees of what they considered cheating then and compare it to now! World of difference. Bob and Lucy are married to other people, they always go on vacation together, one time the spouses can't get away so they go together, oh and they don't like each other much, but that changes, they actually have fun together and well....you will see. Such an innocent and better time. Check it out.",1430438400,2,603,4.490909090909091
6936718,5,B00RYZFRKM,"Facts Of Life is one of my FAVORITE Lucille Ball movies along with The Long Long Trailor and Yours, Mine, & Ours.  This movie was only available on VHS and I've been waiting several years now (since I've bought this movie on VHS) for this to be released onto DVD.  This movie was filmed after the hit TV series I Love Lucy and after Lucille Ball and her then-husband Desi Arnaz separated.  This film co-stars Bob Hope who has excellent chemistry with Lucy and you can tell that the two enjoyed working together, especially on this film, as it has a decent script.

Lucy is still very pretty in this film and has multiple costume changes.  Plus some scenes are very funny.  The storyline is as follows: three couples always go on vacation together.  Lucy's character is married to a man and they have children just as Bob Hope's character is married with his own children as well.  Something happens to Lucy's spouse that he cannot attend the vacation and something also happens with Bob Hope's spouse that she cannot attend the vacation.  So Lucy and Bob go on the plane seated together with the third couple.  Once they get there, the third couple becomes very ill.  So Lucy and Bob are left on the vacation themselves.  At first they dislike one another, but after a fishing together and catching a huge marlin and finding out they both had the same homeroom teacher, the two start to fall in love.  When they come home from their vacation, the two are pretty much inseparable having to meet up with one another often.  Some funny scenes occur when the two stop a motel with the fake names Mr. and Mrs. George Washington or also when the two go to a drive-in movie and get the horn stuck on their car plus on top of that have their mutual cleaning man see them together.  Very funny scenes!  As well as when the two go on a vacation to a leaky cabin.

I won't give away the ending but the two have to decide if they'll leave their spouses to stay with one another or if they'll remain married to their spouses.  I can say that there is nothing shown in this movie that's indecent.  Cheating on your spouse was probably strong subject matter for the time this film came out but there is no nudity or foul language.  The only intimacy you see between Lucy and Bob is nothing more than what you'd see on I Love Lucy and that's kissing.  I do recommend, unless you'd be offended by the subject matter of the film which is cheating on your spouse or having an affair.",1430265600,2,2464,4.407079646017699
