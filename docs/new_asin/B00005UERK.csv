7954548,4,B00005UERK,"Note: I'm in this for the eye-candy. If you are looking for good techno, keep looking. It's obviously dated; but even at time of release, most of this music was a bit embarrassing to anyone worth their salt. The inclusion of Coldcut and Brian Kane (of EBN) would seem to lend the sound some cred, but don't be fooled.
So why the four-star rating? Elementary: the pixel-juice! Some of the most breathtaking video ever shot was taken by astros, and these classic images are arranged in devastating layers of synaptic bliss. I prefer my visual toys to draw on film rather than CG, so this release is quite attractive to me. Visually, the Coldcut pieces are really quite good, and the Brian Kane piece is actually one of my favorites. (The audio on this last, which is not by Kane, is interesting as well, but very experimental, not ""dance"" music.)  This is guaranteed to work as atmosphere at your party, or in your club. See you in orbit!",1243900800,3,936,4.571428571428571
7954549,4,B00005UERK,"I really liked the idea behind this DVD. This seemed to be targeted to the club/Rave generation. The music on this DVD was not really my style, however it worked well with the visual content. You can put your own music to it as well.  I really enjoyed the space videos put in to a club type video format. If you're a video jockey at a nightclub, or DJ like me, this will be a welcome addition to your set.",1018137600,4,405,4.0625
