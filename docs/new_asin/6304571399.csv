7874379,3,6304571399,"""Heroes Shed No Tears"" is usually considered the first proper entry into Woo's cycle of ""heroic bloodshed"" films, though it was his next film ""A Better Tomorrow"" from the same year (1986) which really put him on the map. It's easy to see why this one didn't really connect - for all the excellent action, it's kind of dull as a story and the characters don't really have the romantic pathos of Woo's best material.  And it's non-city setting is something we don't usually see in Woo's work though it does look forward to his masterpiece ""Bullet in the Head"" to some extent, setting-wise.

Basically a group of mercenaries lead by Chan Chung (Eddie Ko) go into the Vietnames jungle to capture a drug lord, and the movie is mostly their journey as they add members, and then get whittled down one by one through copious amounts of gunfire, explosions, martial arts and knives.  There are definitely a few good slow-mo over the top sequences that make one think ""wow, this is the real thing"" but the non-action stuff is really not particularly interesting and it all feels rather programmed. I had fun with it, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who doesn't really like Woo and his sort of mayhem.",1381449600,,1197,4.636792452830188
7874380,3,6304571399,"This is obviously a rather early John Woo film, made right before A Better Tomorrow, which was his breakthrough epic. Watching it, I felt like it was a foreshadowing of Bullet in the Head (my personal favorite John Woo flick), but not as refined. It has some great action scenes, such as the Sniper Shot scene (mentioned by another reviewer as well) and the swamp fight against the natives. The massive, unrelenting action scenes will leave you at the edge of your seat: but there's still a problem. Being that it is an earlier Woo flick, it isn't (as I've said) as refined as A Better Tomorrow or Hard-Boiled. Also, it DOES lack Chow Yun Fat. The cohesiveness of the plot/ action/ story/ characters/ etc that is found in his later films is missing in this. Often I was left thinking, ""Dood. This doesn't make sense."" And thrown in is a scene where basically girls get naked: A VERY Un-Woo scene. I was both shocked and dissapointed to see this scene, but again, it is an earlier film so it shall be excused.
If you liked Bullet in the Head, this will dissapoint you, but I think it's still something to watch if you can call yourself a Woo fan. But if you're not really into the Woo style of things, go rent Full Metal Jacket or something instead.",978220800,,1248,4.454148471615721
7874381,4,6304571399,"When I first saw this film on television, I laughed my pants off.  It's one of those movies that you've seen, time and time again, made fun of, due to its poorly timed dubbing and spiratic violence.  The picture quality was  horrible, which fit its cheap attitude perfectly, and more than three  quarters of the movie was spent using extremely primitive sound-effects.  Yet, despite these small glitches, the movie seemed to draw forth more of  my attention than it deserved.  I couldn't help but revel at how consistant  John Woo was through his natorious use of explosions, stunts, and hardened  drama.  The movie didn't glorify violence, however, but made it almost  humorously insignificant.  The killing rate was undoubtedly outragous,  where ten to twenty ""bad guys"" in a scene would fall to their  death as the hero spray's unplotted bullets everywhere.  The drama was very  low, as well as unbelievable, and the relationship between characters was  poorly stimulated.  However, this is the beauty of John Woo's films (and  action films in general).  He expressed each character through pure  violence and tension; nothing more.  Most of the drama in the movie derived  from such violent siduations, and this tactic proves very effective.  Because of this, John Woo unfortunately delivered an excess amount of  action; to the point of exaustion.  This was the main setback, since it  lowered the appreciation of John Woo's poetic action sequences  greatly.  The cinematography quality was on and off, sometimes exceptional and  sometimes very very poor.  The script was horrible, consisting of cheap  one-liners and poorly thought-out reactions.  Never the less, I loved this  movie not for its basic script and storyline, but for the attitude that the  action sets forth (especially the laughs).  Call it cheap, call it trash,  but any sane action-movie critic out there will call it classic.  I would  recommend seeing the movie before buying it, but I would definately  recommend buying the movie just for the heck of it.  Enjoy!",960768000,,2039,5.113149847094801
7874382,1,6304571399,"This was a truly awful effort, one which should be viewed only as an indicator of how lost John Woo became before he focused his genius on A Better Tomorrow and, even more so, The Killer.
Eddie Ko Hung is terrible  in the lead role as a soldier of fortune with a soft spot, all the female  actors are atrocious in poorly written roles, the action sequences are  mundane and lacking in grace (thanks to a cast of workhorse, completely  charmless actors), the violence laughable, the villains completely  one-sided, and the cinematography a step back to the horrific '70s.
The  worst component of this sick excuse for a film is the child actor known on  set only as ""Friday"", according to accounts by a co-producer of  the film.  Hong Kong has never been known for naturalistic actors or for  paying great attention to subtlety of presentation, but this kid deserves a  nomination for worst performance of all time.  Perhaps they overdubbed his  dialogue, for every line he speaks sounds like a 16-year-old voice actor  (or a woman -- as they do in cartoons in Hong Kong) trying to emulate a  six-year-old child.  His face is a hysterical exaggeration, like a  theatrical mask, and his aim-for-the-cutesy posing becomes excessively  annoying after a while.  I found myself cheering when he's trapped in the  flames, groaning when he escapes death, and smirking when he loses his  mother.  Talk about losing an audience member.  This film is the first John  Woo work I've seen (and I'd seen all of his mostly brilliant post-1986  work, even Blackjack, before hitting upon this pile of trash) to make me  cynical to such a degree.
Thank God John Woo has progressed past this.  For if he had remained this kind of a filmmaker producing this kind of  junk, he's the one who should have his eyes sewn shut.",935884800,,1799,4.716129032258064
7874383,4,6304571399,"When I first saw this film it was only because one of my fav. directors, John Y. Woo made it. But it is surprisingly good for an old lo-budget HongKong movie. The direction is all right and when the action turns on,  you can see the master's handwriting. This film is gross but entertaining  and it's worth a rental. Avoid the dubbed Version!",916876800,2,342,4.412698412698413
7874384,5,6304571399,"Unbelievable!  This film was real nice.  I got it just cuz it looked entertaining, maybe it would make me laugh.  It did more than that.  the acting is superb and unbelievably powerful at times.  I love this movie and  will probably watch it several times a year for many years to come.  Rent  it if you can find it, but it's definitely worth buying if you can't",914457600,,362,4.298507462686567
