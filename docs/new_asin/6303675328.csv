8172467,5,6303675328,It is a great TV series that should be made into DVD. We don't see new movies or TV series like this any more.,1410739200,,110,3.625
8172468,5,6303675328,It took a long time to actually discover that they'd made a video of this movie.  I'm glad I finally found it here.  The service and product were just as described.  No complaints!,1391472000,,180,4.393939393939394
8172469,5,6303675328,"Great miniseries about MI6 and OSS agents during WWII during the D-day era. Just wish they would make a Bluray or DVD of this fine TV miniseries all I have is a taped version that I taped myself when it was shown. My only options now would be to convert my old homemade copy or risk a purchase of a old but unopened VHS copy a seller has available and hope it has not deteriorated. Thankfully I own some very powerful and very expensive converter systems . To digitize film,tape or whatever old media to digital. I have a collection of over 10,000 vhs tapes, tons of home movies on film, 500+ super 8,300+ betamax tapes and some more recent HI 8 camcorder and cassette tapes etc. I'm slowly and only restoring mainly rare and hard to find stuff like this series to convert as to do it all would be insane. AS it is very time consuming. So most of my film collection had been doubled and some even triple purchased due to blurays taking over DVD. Crazy circle I know. But I'll most likely stop at blurays for my old collection and buy only new films from then on for any future media as I know they are working on and will someday replace blurays as well.  Ive written the studio of this production asking for a bluray and or at least a DVD release. But you know how they are. Any way great show and very very hard to find especially with that Shane McMoron film of the same name, being sold or should I say flooded and spammed all over the place making it even harder to trace this show down.",1351296000,,1492,4.235087719298246
