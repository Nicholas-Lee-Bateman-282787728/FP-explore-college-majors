Primatologist Chloe Cipoletta works with native Aka trackers in searching for and observing a group of gorillas.  Gorilla tracks are difficult to detect, because the ground is covered with a thick layer of dried leaves, but the Aka trackers find faint signs of the gorillas' presence on the ground and long hairs that are viewed as coming from a silverback male gorilla.  The danger of gorillas is shown by the explosive warning charge of the dominant male gorilla named Makoumba (which means ""rapid"" in the Aka language), which is also shown in slow motion, and by the Aka tracker Balanyuana, who describes a male gorilla attacking him in the past.  It was amazing seeing the 6-foot, 440-pound Makoumba balancing his body against thin tree branches high in the air as he feeds on leaves and moving fluidly on a long branch, and Chloe states that he can easily climb to a height of 120 feet.  Gorillas eat fruit and grass during the rainy season, and they eat leaves during the dry season.  Gorillas travel up to 5 kilometers (3.1069 miles) a day in searching for food.  Because I remember reading that gorillas don't drink water as they supposedly get all their moisture from their food, I appreciated seeing the gorillas actually drinking water.  Chloe, the Aka trackers, and Park patrol guards discover and dismantle snares set by poachers for the gorillas.  A 2-year-old gorilla named Mapope is found dead, and after examination of the body, the young gorilla is viewed as falling from a tree.  Chloe and the Aka trackers are eventually accepted by Makoumba and the other gorillas, who become comfortable with the humans' observing presence.  The last scene before the credits shows a young gorilla walking in an upright manner on two legs.  There are scenes of leaf-dense rainforest and towering trees, and beautiful delicate music is featured throughout&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kingdom-for-the-Dzanga-Gorillas/dp/B0027VD3PE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kingdom for the Dzanga Gorillas</a>.",1486166400,2,2354,5.830903790087463
