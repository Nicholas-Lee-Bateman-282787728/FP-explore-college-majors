I have been  thinking  about  purchasing it every since I saw it for sale on amazon, After I watched it for the second time I had to add it to my collection. If you like a sweet romance with  some sad drama mixed in I think you will like this  show very much. Give it a try before  you can watch it  on crunchy roll and drama fever",1363910400,,373,3.8026315789473686
8067744,5,B0009W30AG,"I bought 2 copies of YA Entertainment's DVD of 'Ruler of Your Own World' and donated a copy to my local public library.  'Ruler of Your Own World', which became a sensation when it was originally broadcast in Korea, has a great cast, great direction, a great story, and a wonderful screenplay (one of the best screenplays I've ever seen). I have mentioned elsewhere that the brain cancer story element is not the whole story:  it's the relationships among the characters that is the whole story and how they deal with each other in sometimes deep, emotional, clever, and hilarious ways.  From the acting to the excellent script-writing, to the first scene to its final cut, this series is one of the best Korean dramas I've ever watched and enjoyed. I list it as number 1 on my top ten lists (among series like Jumong, Yi san, Jewel in the Palace, Iron Empress, the Great Queen Seondeok, and others).",1265587200,,900,4.647798742138365
8067745,5,B0009W30AG,"This is one of the best shows ever, period.  It's a shining example of how a TV show can be done right, instead of just being a tool to draw an audience for the sole purpose of selling them products.  Albeit, it's a Korean program, and their TV probably differs from American television, but I stand by my point.

There's just so many good things about this show, I don't know where to start.  I guess first would be that it's a great story.  Unlike the convoluted and confusing stories of American TV, this is a simple love story.  These aren't rich kids in SoCal, aren't the upper crust of society; the characters on this show are real people, with real problems.  The main character Go Boksoo is a petty thief just out of prison, only to fall back to his old ways.  Along the way, he steals from, apologizes to, and falls in love with a pretty young aspiring musician named Gyeong Jeon, much to the dismay of his overbearing, but loving girlfriend Mirae.

But there's only one thing that prevents Boksoo and Gyeong from achieving everlasting happiness: Boksoo has brain cancer.  Yes, it's been done billions of times on soap operas and other shows, movies, plays, books, etc.  But unlike a vast majority of those, Boksoo, and the story, don't dwell on his illness.  Instead, the show focuses on how we can help ourselves by overcoming adversity, and having a positive attitude.  Again, done a million times, but with this, it's right on the mark.  It's almost never cheesy (I say almost because there are some parts, but nothing has achieved utter perfection), and by the end of it, I truly felt all warm and fuzzy, a rather odd feeling if you've never really felt it (And I mean really felt it).

All in all, this show demonstrates that you don't have to have a big budget, or beautiful people to make something special.  Watching this show will not only make you feel good, it will make you see light in a world that can, at times, be completely shrouded in darkness.  It's a beautiful story of love, triumph over adversity, and living life to it's fullest (To which it maintains a great level of realism).  As close to perfection as TV will ever get.

(Plus, the music is totally awesome!)",1130803200,13,2195,4.539440203562341
