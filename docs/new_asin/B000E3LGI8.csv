8105194,4,B000E3LGI8,"Tatsumiyajima is an island off the coast of Japan. It is a self sustained island that is a source of hope in a world overrun with alien invaders called The Festum. The teenagers that live on this island pilot mechas called Fafner. Fafner is the only means for destroying The Festum. Kazuki is the greatest warrior among the Fafner pilots. He has a strong sense of justice and loyalty to his loved ones. He risks everything, along with his friends, to protect humanity.

There are a lot of mecha series out there. This one is above average. It doesn't reach the level of Evangelion, but it's a heck of a lot better than Gasraki. I think that it is most like RahXephon. If you've seen RahXephon, then you can get a pretty good idea of what this is like. It has good animation, voice acting, and a suitable soundtrack. There is plenty of action and drama is Fafner as well.

After hearing all of that you're probably wondering, ""why not 5 stars then""? The reason I can't give it 5 stars is b/c some of the characters seemed very distant. Even though the characters feelings and love for each other was a major theme, the relationships between them weren't developed very well. I think that the psychology of the Fafner pilots was focused on too much. The thing that would have made this series great was stronger relationships between them. This is the reason It wasn't great. Don't get me wrong, Fafner is definitely good, but it lacked the most important thing it needed...character development.",1358467200,2,1494,4.633962264150943
8105195,5,B000E3LGI8,"OK people, what is Fafner?

Before I get into the story, I will try to answer a hypothetical question first: Who should not and who should watch Fafner.

To begin with, if you are a die-hard fan of Evangelion or Gundam etc. than most probably you will not want to watch this one because it has some similarities with the previous mention animes indeed; and you most probably will `blow away' a great anime like this. On the other hand, people who would like to watch a very good anime, with strong storyline, twists, romance, lots of action and of course Mechas (belongs to the so called sci-fi category) than you should watch this one.

Let us proceed to the storyline:

It starts with the life of people, teenagers going to school, adults to work etc. by introducing the viewer to their everyday life. The place where the story starts is called Tatsumiya Island. To make the long story short, aliens attack earth and obviously the Island gets under attack, devastating their lives and throwing the teenagers into battle; basically, because they are the ones who are able to fly the Mechas. Additionally, power games will start to evolve, exhausting battles all over the globe will occur, between sort of government and military parties etc. and all the teenagers are caught in the middle of all this. As the series proceed, many questions will be raised (which will be answered - directly or indirectly - in the end of the series), the bounds between the main protagonists will become stronger (and of course romance), the viewer will witness all the emotional rollercoaster that these youngsters will go through and some of them will even die.

This sums up the story. I could get into more details and tell you what will go on in every episode but I refrained myself from doing this because I believe that if someone decides to watch the series than I would give away the entire suspense and twists of it.

Overall critique about the series:

If you are into Mechas for a while, then most probably you have watched Mecha series and are familiar with the common pattern that this kind of animes are following: teenagers are the ones who can fly the Mechas, alien invasion, battles, romance, power games etc (as for the good guy vs. bad guy, in the Mecha series this usually presents a grey zone). Therefore, why should someone watch Fafner? If you are not into animes for a long time, should you watch Fafner?

The answer would be yes. First of all, because of its animation, which is very good. Second, because of its storyline, which although is based on the common pattern that is been explained above, yet, it manages to bring forth new ideas, a solid and strong storyline, many twists and mainly till the final episodes you will not be able to foresee its final conclusion. Even if you are a die-hard fan of Evangelion, RahXephon etc. this one is definitely worth a watch from you. As for the action, the series are packed with it. Third, because of its dub; in other words, if you belong to the category of people that instead of Japanese would prefer the English dub, it is very good done and professional orchestrated. Thumbs up!

Apart from it, if you buy the box set or the complete collection, then the box is exactly the one you see in the picture, which is very strong, like a shelf and doesn't brake easily. As for extras, the usual stuff like previews of other animes, not credit opening/ending and so forth.

To the most obvious question: Buying it or not? To be honest, if you can afford the money than I will definitely recommend these series to you, if, you can not afford the money than try to rent it and watch it.

To conclude these series are highly recommended!

I hope that I could help you...",1169769600,,3721,4.587349397590361
8105196,4,B000E3LGI8,"Kazuki and his friends have become a force to be reckoned with. Together with Michio and Canon, two pilots formerly of the Neo UN, the Tatsumiya Fafner pilots have successfully defended the island for quite some time. A prolonged sequence of Festum attacks keeps the new defense force on the move but rarely does the enemy prove to be much of a challenge. With morale bolstered and egos stoked, the young defenders of Alvis feel they can overcome any and all challenge that comes their way.

Commander Makabe is wary of the island's recent success. The routine nature of the Festum intrusions, their numbers, and the timing, leads him to believe that the enemy might be testing the island's defenses. Or worse yet, Makabe fears the Festum are biding their time. His concerns are echoed by the ethereal words of Tsubaki Minashiro, who is faced with the fact that her body will not be able to exist outside of the island's core for much longer. Ever cheerful, Tsubaki focuses instead on a possible solution to the Festum conflict. She believes the enemy is learning from humankind, studying and measuring reaction as a means of strengthening the collective. Though they reject the notion of individual freedom and consciousness, it is clear to Tsubaki that the Festum can be taught to coexist. She hopes that such a message can be sent to the North Pole Mir, the heart of the Festum invasion, before the Neo UN launches its decisive battle to end the war.

But dreams of unity and peace are shattered when the pilots of Alvis are suddenly faced with the harsh reality of their continued existence. Inflicted with a phenomenon that will eventually destroy their minds, Kazuki and his friends must come to terms with the price they must pay for defending their homeland. To make matters worse, the Festum's plan of attack escalates, taking the defenders by surprise and striking them at their weakest. The arrival of a new, deadly enemy reveals at last the Festum's ultimate agenda: the Siegfried System and the young man who wields it in battle: Soshi Minashiro. Kazuki and his allies must rally to defend their friend and home against this new threat, in what will be one of the bloodiest battles to scar the island yet. Though experienced and battle-hardened, can Kazuki hope to save Soshi from the Festum now that the enemy has tasted hatred for the first time?

The final story arc of Fafner kicks off with an impressive turn of events in Volume 6. Here comes the payoff at last: intriguing twists, climactic battles, unexpected departures, and one very hostile Festum. The volume begins on a somber note, then kicks into high gear with two battles that will forever alter the lives of the island's inhabitants. With only three episodes remaining, we can expect the final volume to be just as action packed as this one. But coming with that expectation is a glimmer of hope, that perhaps some of the lingering questions (and there are many) will be answered before the end.",1165276800,,2974,4.7933723196881095
