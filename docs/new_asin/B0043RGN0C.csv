8415202,4,B0043RGN0C,"I loved this until the end. It was well put together. This series is about a girl whose mother remarries and she falls in love with her new stepbrother. They separate and don't see each other for a long time and end up reunited. The ending is sad, but I am glad I bought this. The soundtrack is wonderful.",1323820800,,305,4.186440677966102
8415203,4,B0043RGN0C,"I won't give spoilers, but well, the guy we learn to like dies, and she has to settle for mister second-best, who she cares nothing for.  No spoilers, huh?

It's a shame too, because you have all this build up and angst, on this troubled relationship that both parties want, but isn't meant to be. Nope, no ""love conquers all here.""  Though in a way, he does manage to stay close to her forever. I suppose it's okay, then.",1311552000,2,422,4.3164556962025316

8415205,4,B0043RGN0C,The drama was ok. It was a little weird but if you like weird it's a great show. Very sweet and loving.,1294963200,,103,3.727272727272727
