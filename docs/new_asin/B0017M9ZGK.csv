3174568,5,B0017M9ZGK,"I have high expectations in this modern age for a Blu-ray documentary and this production easily meets those expectations. Most features I have seen in the past are disappointing. The entire feature is filmed in HD unlike the ""Over Hawaii"" programme which has a mix of quality, although the content in that programme is very good.
The content is superb showcasing wildlife, short segments on towns and the majority on Alaska's superb landscapes. I cannot understand some reviewer's comments re the movie being MOSTLY about the ports of call as that is untrue.
The photography is outstanding and has me spellbound every time I watch it. The picture clarity, subject material and presentation are expertly put together and if you are a lover of wilderness and spectacular mountain landscapes, you should fall in love with this. If there are better Blu-ray DVD's on wilderness areas than this then I would love to hear about them!",1476489600,,927,4.987096774193549

3174578,4,B0017M9ZGK,"Let me start by saying that the visual components of the blu ray are fantastic. Something to keep in mind is that this video was sponsored by Princess Cruises, as a consequence, the bulk of the subject matter is limited to cities and towns along the coast of Alaska. I assume this is because those are the only areas accessible by cruise ship.

If you are interested in learning about Denali National Park, Fairbanks, or any other part of Alaska for that matter, skip this movie. It pretty much glosses over the interior in the first 5 minutes. If you're looking for an Alaska equivalent to the BBC Planet Earth series, this also isn't for you.

If you are interested in taking an Alaska cruise, this movie is probably for you.

The movie is also disappointingly short, which is a shame because again, the visual quality is very high.",1420416000,,834,4.583892617449664

Alaska has brown and black bears.  Summer of 2012, I went on a four day tour of Alaska.  We went on a tour to see Whales and Bears.  Because we went on the tour to see the Whales first, [we saw some whales].  The weather was lovely, sunny and the temperature went up into the 70's by the afternoon.  Because of the sun, warm weather the bears decided to stay in the shade and we did not see any bears.

The narration is a bit cheezie in parts but easily overlooked because of the stunning photography! Fly overs of incredible mountains never get old! I strongly recommend this if you like nature blu rays. The wildlife shots are also of the highest quality. It may not go into great detail and plays sort of like a travel advertisment but it was still highly entertaining to watch. It easily blows ""Over Hawaii"" away!",1360368000,,558,4.704081632653061

It shows you all around Alaska and not only the beauty of the cold snow and ice.  You get the most beautiful photography and color and view of the most magnificent wildlife, which we both always want to see, and you almost feel like you are in the helicopter riding around. It gave me a chance to see more of what I will be able to photograph when I go there.  The color and knowing the lifestyle the people have in Alaska.

3174614,3,B0017M9ZGK,"The imagery is stunning, and it's a great way to show of your brand new TV, but the storyline is completely absent, the editing is choppy, and there's just very little entertainment value. The entire disc is just a series of short snippets, strung together with no encompassing theme, storyline, or even any transitions.

This is certainly not in the same league as Blue Planet or Planet Earth, but it's probably worth $10 (I paid $11 with free shipping) if you've just bought a new HDTV and want to see what it's capable of.

But it's unlikely that you'll watch this disc more than 2-3 times.",1291075200,2,593,4.584905660377358

3174617,5,B0017M9ZGK,"This is one of the greatest documentaries I have ever seen: fantastic views of the mountains, very interesting and useful information told by a pleasant voice of the narrator and what I found really helpful was the location of Alaskan national parks and towns on maps.",1264291200,17,268,4.8478260869565215
3174618,4,B0017M9ZGK,"This is another show from PBS's ""Over"" series, which includes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Over-America/dp/B00104XYHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Over America</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Over-California/dp/B00104XYI0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Over California</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Over-British-Columbia/dp/B002D3KLK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Over British Columbia</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Over-Ireland/dp/B0025YFYQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Over Ireland</a>, etc. I call these ""armchair tourist"" DVD's because they're sort of virtual vacations instead of the proper educational/journalistic programing that PBS is better known for. They feel like a tourism board film, or one of those video you see at a museum exhibition (or a ""video essay"", as the box of Over America puts it). Light on historical, geological or other scientific info, the educational value here is minimal. Don't expect a documentary, but do expect some excellent aerial photography of Alaska's iconic geography and wildlife.

Buy it for the visuals instead of the narration. The narrator's voice is pleasant enough, although very ordinary, monotone, and uncaptivating. Missing is northern Alaska. The program starts in Denali National Park, already halfway down in central Alaska, jumps down to Anchorage, then and winds its way southwest to Juneau, meandering between different subject matters. You'll also find quite a bit of cornball fluff writing. For the bush pilots segment, ""On a clear day in Alaska, the routes are all the same -- somewhere just south of heaven."" Describing their derring-do ability to land practically anywhere, he says ""the wings of their planes are connected directly to the seat of their pants"". Later, about trains that go through mountain passes and tunnels, he says ""it's living proof in Alaska that men can move mountains."" He lays on the cheese pretty thick in several places.

What this 58 minute film does do well is give a broad visual sampling of Alaska to someone who hasn't been there (me). It captures the essence of the land and the character of Alaska -- its expansive wilderness, the independent spirit of its people, and a sense of never-ending freedom. The best shots are of snow covered peaks, glaciers, and water. The mountain flyovers really show off their majesty and give the viewer a sense of the magnitude and beauty of the land. Less interesting are the flyovers of buildings. There is also an appreciable amount of ground photography (of bears, elk, foxes, Iditerod race, closeups of foliage in the rainforest, indigenous peoples), though I did not find this to be a problem. Ugly yellow subtitles appear under places to identify the shot, but it's impossible to tell where you are in relation to the entire state if you don't have a map.

As for picture quality, the mountain shots are the best. They are crisp and vibrant, with great contrast. The forest flyovers are less good, being dull and muddy. All in all, good for virtual tourism. Bad if you're expecting to learn anything.

Alaska has brown and black bears.  Summer of 2012, I went on a four day tour of Alaska.  We went on a tour to see Whales and Bears.  Because we went on the tour to see the Whales first, [we saw some whales].  The weather was lovely, sunny and the temperature went up into the 70's by the afternoon.

You get the most beautiful photography and color and view of the most magnificent wildlife, which we both always want to see, and you almost feel like you are in the helicopter riding around.

The entire disc is just a series of short snippets, strung together with no encompassing theme, storyline, or even any transitions.

This is certainly not in the same league as Blue Planet or Planet Earth, but it's probably worth $10 (I paid $11 with free shipping) if you've just bought a new HDTV and want to see what it's capable of.

They feel like a tourism board film, or one of those video you see at a museum exhibition (or a ""video essay"", as the box of Over America puts it). Light on historical, geological or other scientific info, the educational value here is minimal. Don't expect a documentary, but do expect some excellent aerial photography of Alaska's iconic geography and wildlife.

Buy it for the visuals instead of the narration. The narrator's voice is pleasant enough, although very ordinary, monotone, and uncaptivating. Missing is northern Alaska. The program starts in Denali National Park, already halfway down in central Alaska, jumps down to Anchorage, then and winds its way southwest to Juneau, meandering between different subject matters. You'll also find quite a bit of cornball fluff writing. For the bush pilots segment, ""On a clear day in Alaska, the routes are all the same -- somewhere just south of heaven."" Describing their derring-do ability to land practically anywhere, he says ""the wings of their planes are connected directly to the seat of their pants"". Later, about trains that go through mountain passes and tunnels, he says ""it's living proof in Alaska that men can move mountains."" He lays on the cheese pretty thick in several places.

What this 58 minute film does do well is give a broad visual sampling of Alaska to someone who hasn't been there (me). It captures the essence of the land and the character of Alaska -- its expansive wilderness, the independent spirit of its people, and a sense of never-ending freedom. The best shots are of snow covered peaks, glaciers, and water. The mountain flyovers really show off their majesty and give the viewer a sense of the magnitude and beauty of the land. Less interesting are the flyovers of buildings. There is also an appreciable amount of ground photography (of bears, elk, foxes, Iditerod race, closeups of foliage in the rainforest, indigenous peoples), though I did not find this to be a problem. Ugly yellow subtitles appear under places to identify the shot, but it's impossible to tell where you are in relation to the entire state if you don't have a map.

As for picture quality, the mountain shots are the best. They are crisp and vibrant, with great contrast. The forest flyovers are less good, being dull and muddy. All in all, good for virtual tourism. Bad if you're expecting to learn anything.
