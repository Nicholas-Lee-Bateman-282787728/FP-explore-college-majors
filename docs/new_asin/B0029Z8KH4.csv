3882480,3,B0029Z8KH4,"A movie starring a hot babe wearing only a red bikini with cowboy hat and boots who hunts down zombies with a katana, what hot-blooded heterosexual male WOULDN'T want to watch that film.  Well, this isn't THAT film.  Sure, our heroine Aya does wear a red bikini, but she spends over half of the movie wrapped up in a blanket, only revealing her divine body during the battle sequences, which are sped up so fast and covered over with so much special effects that I couldn't tell if they were actually fighting each other or having a dance off.  Talk about wasted potential.  This is a film that would definitely have been better served up as an anime rather than a live action film.  For one thing an animated actress cannot complain about it being too cold or feeling exploited.

As for the storyline, the flow of the movie, the fight sequences, the dialogue and the acting, they are average.  It is the zombies that save this movie for me.  Their make-up is superb, and though they are at times your standard slow, lurching, twitching zombies, they can be fast and they can fight.  There is also none of the over-the-top cherry syrup blood spray that you get with Tokyo Gore Police, just a brief crimson splash which I feel fits better with zombies.  Though personally I would have preferred the blood to be darker in color.  I especially liked the homage to Silent Hill, intentional or not, with the nurse zombie in the hospital.  Other effects in the movie are also enjoyable: the blood spatter on the TV screen, the body parts being flung out of the fray, and the video game effects like the special attacks and the character boosts.  Combined with the 3 hot ladies in this movie, and I actually give this movie 3 1/2 stars.  More stars would have been granted of course if the ladies' outfits had been scimpier and more revealing.

The last point I would like to make is my pet peeve of the movie.  With all of the money they spent on the special effects and zombie make-up, why couldn't they spend a few extra dollars to make Aya's tattoo look real.  I have gotten better looking tatoos out of a Cracker Jack box.  Seriously, I thought the tattoo was going to come off at times.  But being that nit-picky allowed me to notice the biggest blunder in this movie.  In one scene of the final battle with Saki, her tattoo suddenly transfers to her right arm, the bandage is now on her left arm, and the slash on her face has temporarily been healed.  Bad, editor, bad.  I hope he had the decency to commit seppuku.",1252972800,19,2516,4.4714912280701755

3882482,4,B0029Z8KH4,"The film is based on the manga that became a popular PS2 game in Japan. Directed by Youhei Fukuda, the film ""OneChanbara the movie"" (called Chanbara Beauty in Hong Kong) features three of Japan's top pin-up girls in very significant roles. Eri Otoguro is a scantily-clad woman in a cowboy outfit and a bikini while Chise Nakamura is in a sexy schoolgirl uniform; both sexy women wields katana swords--joined by Minami Hashimoto who plays a biker chick clad in hot leather with a sawed-off shotgun. Do I have your attention yet?

In a post apocalyptic future, the D3 corporation had performed devilish experiments to raise the dead. These undead creatures started preying on living humans and the humanity is on the brink of extinction. Aya, (upcoming sex siren Eri Otoguro, U.S. remake ""Shutter) is the heiress of the ancient Imichi clan of assassins. Aya cuts her way through zombies created by mad scientist Sugita, on the path to vengeance in search of her sister Saki (Chise Nakamura, Cursed Songs 2) to avenge the death of their father at the hands of her own sister. Joined by longtime companion, Katsuji and a leather-clad, shotgun-toting woman named Reiko (Minami Hashimoto), Aya is determined to come to a resolution on the conflict between her and her sister Saki. Aya is an amazing swordswoman, Saki is her equal with a Katana sword --what would be the outcome?

The film isn't to be taken seriously at first glance. I haven't read the Japanese comic nor have I finished the game; but it is so obvious that this film has been inspired by a comic and the effects are very reminiscent of the video game. The Swordplay is a blend of ""Dynasty Warriors"", the effects can be compared to ""Fist of the NorthStar"" and even ""DragonBall Z"". When Aya unleashes her ""inner"" power or mystical ""Chi"", her surroundings are set to explode--dirt is being spewed forth and rocks are flying. The flashes and light trails emulates the sword strokes, limbs and blood hit the camera view and extreme close-ups are used to express pain. The fight choreography by Go Ohara is quite good and hard-hitting--and contain a very good amount of Blood, while GORE is omnipresent in the zombie feasting buffet. I rather like the birds eye view of Aya`s encounter with a zombie army and the final encounter between Aya and Saki is very exciting and fun to see. The fights are the film's main draw aside from the sexy female trio. Anime-inspired fighting poses is the trio's forte and boy, do these women look good when they wield a sword.

""OneChanbara's"" plot is very simple and is quite similar to other Japanese films of this type. I do commend director Fukuda's decision not to dawdle too much on Eri Otoguro, Chise Nakamura and Minami Hashimoto's ""star appeal"" and charisma. The film's screenplay does have a lot of emotion. The past is told in the form of flashbacks and there is a lot of emotion to be had. The loss of a loved one due to them becoming the ""undead"" has a lot of emotional potential and the director does manage to flesh them out. Killing a loved one is quite difficult--especially when one is guilty for their current situation.

The zombies in the film aren't your usual ""shambling"" undead. They are fast-moving and some of them have been enhanced to perform martial arts and to wield a weapon. There is a zombie who looks like a ""Go-go Yubari"" reject and one who looks like he is a ""Jin Kazama"" reject from ""Tekken 4"" video game. These change of mood doesn't hurt the film but rather shows its roots from the pages of manga. The zombie make up EFX is very similar to other Japanese movies in this genre and their faces have that pale-gray hue. The main villain himself is a cardboard anime villain. Dr. Sugita is the head of a corporation intent on playing ""God"". The sibling rivalry between Saki and Aya is decently developed and builds up its climactic climax. Reiko is a little underdeveloped and Katsuji seems like a minor plot device to lighten the mood somewhat.

The film is a little ""campy"" at times, but it doesn't lose its forward momentum. The film is very simple and the plot has been built around the encounter with zombies and the action sequences. There is some sex and nudity to be had--but I was disappointed that Eri, Chise and Minami kep their clothes on. The film is very action-packed and fast-paced. Despite its weaknesses in storyline the film is never boring and does provide the expected entertainment from a manga-inspired movie. Make sure you remember the source material when you are watching this film--Youhei Fukuda is no Ryuhei Kitamura but he does manage to put together a film that does justice to its roots.

Still, a katana-wielding woman in red bikini with a cowboy hat, scarf and leather boots proves very sexy. Eri Otoguro is the right woman for the job; joined by Minami Hashimoto and Chise Nakamura--these three Japanese women can make any man's blood boil with excitement.

""OneChanbara"" may not be a film for everyone but it sure is fun to watch!

Recommended! To fans of the game and to fans of Japanese cinema [3  Stars]",1247270400,21,5066,4.708803611738149

3882487,3,B0029Z8KH4,"A lot of movies based on video games are not that great. Some good examples are as follows...

Super Mario Bros.
Double Dragon
Doom
Street Fighter The Movie (Not the Animated one, the live action one with Van Damn)

Most cases, when they make a movie based on a video game, it's never how you would expect it to be, or they made story line changes to ""try"" and please the audience.

This is about the same case here. The only difference is that this movie seems to be ""Fan"" made (""B"" Movie) rather than a full production company. Fight scenes are pretty basic compaired to other fighting movies from asian films. Script also seemed pretty basic rather than detailed. The special effects were, although not the best, not the worst I have seen. They obviously thought it out a little bit to give the audience the feeling and look similar to the game. Actors/actresses were no one ""really"" famous so they obviously had amateur people. Although, overall I have seen a lot worse movies that had more budget. They did try to put effort into this movie, but the video quality is pretty obvious that it was a camera bought from your local store. (Probably the $2000+ kind, not the worst, but not the best either) The only other real problem is that, at least with the DVD I got, there was no english translation of the movie, so I hope your asian skills are up to par. What's odd is the DVD cover had english printed all over it. So, if you can, might want to look online for a script translated into english and try to follow along with it. The DVD does come with some extras, such as production overview and behind the scenes look at how the movie was directed and produced. It's not a bad movie, just hope you can find the script to follow the speech.

Got this in about 5 days using standard USPS, so I was most pleased with the timing. I do suggest you buy new, but that's just my opinion about such things. Movie is for adults only, not recommended for kids. Ideally for people who know the game and/or are fans of the game as well.",1379721600,,2030,4.362433862433862

3882495,3,B0029Z8KH4,"Onechanbara is a combination of two Japanese words meaning Young woman (onechan)and Sword fighting (chanbara) and that it what you get in this movie: Young women sword fighting. It is essentially a softcore movie designed to appeal to lovers of young women that show off flesh.

The fighting is good, and the women playing dress up are really hot, but those are the only good things. The special effects are laughable at times and the plot is stock. The comic relief character is painful.

Still that does not matter because you are only here for the women sword fighting. If you know what you are getting its enjoyable.",1328832000,,620,4.731481481481482
3882496,4,B0029Z8KH4,"In response to the previous review, there's certainly more budget allowances for this flick than there was for 'Attack Girls Swim Team VS. the Undead'. The special effects alone are proof of that. Apparently, he's upset about the lack of nudity and, quite frankly, aren't we all when it comes to these types of films? We don't seek them out for their intricate plotlines, character development, or cutting-edge CGI, that's for sure. We simply want to see rampant mayhem, militant madness, imaginative kills involving hordes of the unholy undead, and good-looking, scantily-clad babes involved in the carnage as either victims or victors, or maybe a bit of both. Plain and simple. It appeals to us males on a strictly primitive level of entertainment, and I personally prefer these to yet another tepid, tedious installment of 'Mission Impossible: The Assisted-Living Assignment'. And if there just happens to be gratuititous nudity involved, better still.

That said, this film was an attempt to bring the successful video game to a live-action movie, and the kill scene carnage reflects that in the way the ubiquitious undead are dispensed with, so it's faithful but not translated too well for those of us unfamiliar with the videogame. Once you adjust to its execution (pun intended), however, it moves along rather nicely. The lead actress performs the fight scenes adequately, has a great figure but not the usual Asian pretty doll face we're familiar with, though by no means is a two-bagger in the desirability department. Just a trite plain as far as uberbabes go. It's equal helpings of Spaghetti Western, ultra-violent videogaming and hypersonic zombie massacre, and if your expectations aren't elevated beyond that, you should be able to enjoy it on a primal level. Assuming you go in for these types of flicks in the first place; otherwise, you really shouldn't be reading these reviews.

In short, if seeing a babe in a 10 gallon cowboy hat, western boots, bikini, holster, samurai sword and a fur shawl kicking the bejeezus out of a gazillion zombies is any kind of fun to you, check it out. It's by no means a great flick, but you could do worse. Otherwise, I'm sure you can find another 'Mission Impossible: The Wheelchair Races' easily enough...3 1/2 stars (for this type of hyperviolent hootananny).",1327708800,,2317,5.03125

No nudity, not much gore, no real story, nothing too impressive as far as special effects or makeup.

Saki prefers the typical school uniform as does several other characters including a zombie version of Gogo for you ""Kill Bill ""fans. Aya has a sword that would make Uma Thurman green with envy as she squares off against zombies in a similar fashion against the 88, except her sword looks like lightning as it moves.

There was only so much killing I could take before I needed some plot. Background was provided by a fireside chat, but that grew boring as did the lack of linear plot indicating the script couldn't grow beyond that of an action game.
