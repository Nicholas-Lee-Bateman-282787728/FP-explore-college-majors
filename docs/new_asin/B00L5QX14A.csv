6470987,5,B00L5QX14A,"This is an amazing tour de force by Billy Crystal. First of all, the concept and the writing of this one-man play are of a highly artistic caliber. His humorous perceptions of life, family, and aging not only provoke side-splitting laughter, but they also prompt introspection and warm emotions. While we are moved by the humor and the insights, we are also dazzled by Crystal's amazing performance. We always knew he was an accomplished comedian--here, we realize that he is also a versatile actor with exceptional skills that affect us on all levels of our intelligence and emotions.",1416268800,4,585,4.979591836734694
6470988,5,B00L5QX14A,"One of the best things I've seen in a long time, Billy's ability to tell his story and convey the emotions tied to those times in his life were just fantastic. I laughed, I cried and I laughed again, I've viewed the video twice now, first time by myself and the second time I shared with family. I am sure I'll watch it again because it makes my soul smile, sort of a Matzo Ball Soup for the Soul... While I'm at it I just finished Mr. Crystal's book ""Still Fooling 'em"" on audio CD's which is great because Billy is the voice on the CD's. I highly recommend both ""700 Sundays"" and ""Still Fooling 'em"" worth every second of your time!",1416182400,,634,4.204918032786885
6470989,5,B00L5QX14A,"A wonderful blend of tender family memories, absurd juxtapositions, mime with an amazinfly flexible face, some real jazz history and the warmth of billy's humor without obscenity",1415577600,,178,5.62962962962963

6470991,5,B00L5QX14A,"saw part of it on HBO -and had to see the rest.  If you have a relative that has had a stroke, also a good movie to see",1415059200,,119,3.25
6470992,5,B00L5QX14A,"What I would have given to have seen this live! I watched this on HBO just a couple of weeks ago. All alone, just me and the TV. I found myself sobbing on a number of occasions and laughing out loud just as often! The next night I told my wife she had to see this with me. We watched it again and the experience was just as great as the first. Without a doubt, one of the Top 5 artistic experiences I have ever had! It was so wonderful written and told by Mr. Crystal. Sometimes crass, always touching and funny. I am purchasing a copy for all of my siblings, but most importantly for my dad.",1414368000,2,592,4.02542372881356
6470993,5,B00L5QX14A,"Moving and funny.
Billy Crystal is one true genius. He can do anything (acting,writing,directing and do stand up)
Don't miss this opportunity to see him at his best. You will probably see it several times,like I did
Please M.Crystal keep on making us happy with all your talent",1410652800,8,277,4.791666666666667
6470994,5,B00L5QX14A,"Having relished Crystals comedic talent for years, this proves he is an extraordinary actor, writer and, yes again, a comic.  These two hours hits one as a tsunami of emotion from the laughter that puts tears in your eyes and the sadness that puts the other tears in your eyes.  As he says here, Tears always taste the same.  Recommended especially for groups larger than one.",1410134400,11,376,4.666666666666667
6470995,4,B00L5QX14A,"Unabashedly sentimental, at moments arguably shticky, but theres a lot of heart and laughs, along with a good set of smiles in Billy Crystals one-man show remembering his youth, especially the 700 Sundays he had with his  father before his untimely death.

From the telling, Crystal had a remarkable childhood, and came from a remarkable family.  His father owned a music store and promoted concerts, and knew and was loved by  many of jazzs all time greats.  His family come off as sweet if eccentric.  As related here, this
was a family without many of the deeply painful skeletons in their closets that most of us grew up with.  Its sort of the Jewish version of Norman Rockwells America, but I don't mean that as a put down.  Crystal seems to truly appreciate the blessings hes had, and to honor and love the people who made him who he is.  He doesnt deny that life can be painful, but that doesnt mean for a second hes going to say its not wonderful and worthwhile.

If a few moments of emotion feel forced in the unforgiving close up lens of a  camera, theres a lot that ring true, no matter that Crystal has performed variations of this monologue on stage hundreds of times.",1407283200,15,1181,4.523584905660377

This is a beautiful one man show of Crystals life.  It's side splitting funny, tender, and heart breaking.  It's about jazz, Jews, family, loss, love, sports - a life and history of a time in America.  I absolutely loved this CD of the HBO performance of his Broadway? show.

What a ride!  I wound up watching it twice, back to back, just to make sure I didn't miss a word.  This one man play comes off with all the flair of a  fully staged, theatrical production.  I laughed so hard my sides ached, I cried a river of tears, I laughed even more.  Really, unbelievably brilliant story telling!

He is so gifted and talented, he is actually a living legend along with Mel Brooks, and sadly, Robin Williams. His creative mind and insistence in finding ways to make us laugh is his genius.

I must tell you that I burst out laughing yesterday over and over and over again from this show. I absolutely loved it. There are some very tender and heartfelt moments as well, such as the death of his dad and some struggles in life. However, he quickly had something funny to share and he is wonderful. This will be my gift for others in the holiday season.

Kudos to Mr. Crystal for sharing his life is such a wonderful way. Note to some who get offended, there is some use of the ""F"" word but it is done in a PERFECT context.  ENJOY!!
