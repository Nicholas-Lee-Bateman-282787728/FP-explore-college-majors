7455095,5,B0160MOD40,DVD was well produced and of high quality with a great pace that kept my interest throughout. I have been foam rolling for quite a while and I leaned many new things to try. Comprehensive training for the beginner to the experienced ... well worth the money!,1447027200,3,258,4.51063829787234
7455096,5,B0160MOD40,"This DVD is great if you are a novice, at using a foam roller, or you have experience. Kevin provides concise steps to follow while watching the DVD. Also very easy to remember the exercises, so that you can repeat on your own. I was a novice with my foam roller, but now feel more confident and I am looking forward to the positive results with my body. Definitely recommend this DVD.",1447027200,5,385,4.361111111111111
7455097,5,B0160MOD40,Foam rolling is like getting a massage anytime you want it. I knew a little about using my roller before but now I know so much more. I am so glad I know how to do it right! Kevin is a great teacher.,1445990400,3,199,3.6511627906976742

7455099,4,B0160MOD40,"This was a good overall demo of how to use a foam roller. I do foam rolling at my gym, but wanted this CD to show other family members how they could use the one I bought for home to their benefit. We all use it, from age 17 to 52 and love the way it relieves muscle aches.",1466640000,2,273,3.6440677966101696
7455100,4,B0160MOD40,"basic video. nothing fancy . after the first few times I would like something that that was more like a program so I would not have to listen to some of the don't get hurt etc dialog.  the instructions were good.
would I buy it again I don't know as I have nothing to compare it to.",1465689600,4,282,3.9473684210526314
7455101,5,B0160MOD40,"This video is awesome! As someone who tries to do some form of exercise everyday, the muscle tightness and soreness I felt made it pretty difficult to really get the most out of my workouts.  I'd heard of foam rolling and recently purchased a foam roller but I had no idea how to use it or where to even start.  This video was a great resource with a ton of information about how to safely and effectively perform each of the stretches. Kevin even takes the time to explain why foam rolling is so important and effective and how it helps our bodies recover so much faster from workouts, sitting at a desk all day, driving, etc. Really liked how he broke down each section of the video based on which body part we were focusing on and explained the benefits of each individual stretch.  This is a great resource for anyone looking to loosen up their muscles and joints and increase their mobility.  I will definitely be foam rolling as often as possible and absolutely recommend this DVD. So glad I bought it!",1464048000,,1008,4.461956521739131
7455102,5,B0160MOD40,"I really wanted to like this DVD,
It is best for someone just getting into foam rolling as it is pretty basic. I already do foam rolling in my pilates class and was looking for a supplement for home use. Besides being simple,I found this to be lacking in ""flow"". I think Moses is great, and anyone wanting to be introduced to foam rolling will probably get more out of it. If you are already on board and looking for a more experienced level, this is not it. Wish someone had written a review like this before I purchased it.",1462924800,13,525,4.26
7455103,5,B0160MOD40,"This DVD caught my eye one day while browsing fitness DVDs on Amazon. Since my foam roller was collecting dust I decided to resurrect it.  That was the best decision. Just completed my third workout and absolutely love it!  Didn't realize my hips were so tight. Over twenty years ago, I started using a therapy ball and it became my BFF (best friend forever) until now.  My roller just sat in the corner and rarely used because I didn't know the proper techniques. Instructions are easy to follow and Kevin demonstrates alternative positions (tips) to prevent injuries.  This was a good investment and a great addition to my fitness library. Would recommend to a friend.",1459296000,3,670,4.8
7455104,5,B0160MOD40,"I'm an injured runner due to knee problems.  Turns out my knee problems are partially due to some super tight IT bands.  It was recommended to try a foam roller, but I had NO IDEA how to use one.  Came across this video and didn't expect to learn as much as I did, and I was quite surprised at the many uses of a foam roller!  After watching the video, I learned how to not only work on my IT bands, but also learned how to work other parts that need rolling (my hips!) and I didn't even know it.  If you're lost and don't know where to start, this is a PERECT resource for you.  Also, even if you think you know how to use a roller, I bet you'll learn something new and beneficial through this great ""how to"" video.  Have fun rolling!",1450742400,15,735,4.027586206896552
7455105,5,B0160MOD40,"I have had a foam roller for a few years, I use it sometimes, it has been getting a little dusty lately.  This DVD has me fired up again, very clearly explained and demonstrated positions.  Good visual and audio production.  I appreciated the all the little tips and reminders about positions I tend to skip but are also really important.

I go to the gym and I also sit a lot at work, so I have many reasons to be sore and tight.  This video is a great reminder that it is within your power to feel good and reduce pain.  Stretching is not enough...a person needs massage/foam roller/etc.  Sometimes I follow along straight through the DVD for an hour, other times I just pick one of the 11 or 12 chapters and just do 5 minutes.  I am leaving this DVD in my computer so I can watch quickly when I need to.",1449619200,5,806,4.188311688311688
7455106,5,B0160MOD40,This DVD is a great tool to learn more about using a foam roller.  I had no idea there were so many ways to use it.  It has helped me so much with muscle soreness and my flexibility is really increasing by leaps and bounds. Definitely recommend this DVD by Kevin.,1448323200,3,263,4.137254901960785
7455107,5,B0160MOD40,"Big fan of this workout DVD. As a 30+ age male, I find it works wonders for my tight back. I would recommend this video to anyone interested in trying an ""outside the box"" type workout that can be done from the comfort of your living room.",1447804800,3,239,4.1063829787234045
8735277,5,B0160MOD40,Excellent! Exactly what I need to add to my workout routine. Especially for my lower back pain.,1528329600,,95,4.647058823529412
8735278,5,B0160MOD40,"For a newbie to a foam roller this DVD is just what the doctor ordered. Very clear explanation with live demonstration. The ongoing narrative, re the exercise target as well as do and don'ts, is most helpful. Not many questions to ask at the end. Encountered a technical issue at the beginning with the DVD itself, emailed Moses and got an almost immediate response, that is SERVICE at it's best. Highly recommend this DVD.",1516579200,,423,4.72972972972973
8735279,5,B0160MOD40,This DVD is packed with good information on foam rolling! I didn't realize how many ways you could use a foam roller. Kevin does a great job at keeping you interested the whole time. I have noticed that I have had better posture and flexibility since using this DVD.

8735281,5,B0160MOD40,"My wife recently purchased the foam roller video for me and it already has been very helpful.  I've only used it 2 days and already feel a benefit.  I already had a roller and myofacial massage balls but was not getting the true benefit they have to offer.  I have had myofacial release therapy previously at the Barnes institute and have currently found a massage therapist at Massage Envy that practices massage therapy.  So with Kevin Moses's video I feel I will be able to achieve greater pain relief.  Between being 57, previously injuries and working 12 to 15 hour shifts as a veterinarian in an ER, I place a lot of abuse on my body and have been for many years.  Things really started getting bad about 20 years ago when I started helping my wife, who is a children's entertainer, by being her costume character, who is a 6 foot frog, and doing an average of 250 to 300 very physical shows per year. (See Flumpa on Amazon)  I was also driving her around the country, covering over 60,000 miles per year.  And I was working a full time position in ER at that time also.  So needless to say, my body needs some help, and with the help of this excellent video, and some hard work on my part, I feel I am getting that help.  Just wanted to share and let Kevin know to keep up the good work.",1487894400,,1294,4.288065843621399

8735283,5,B0160MOD40,"This DVD is essential if you have never used a foam roller.  I almost returned my foam roller.  I hated the roller, but was not using it properly and didn't realize if rolling your IT ban is somewhat painful, it's working.  He takes you through step by step.",1486771200,,258,4.333333333333333
