5341152,5,B009IV2ZCI,"Absolutely loved this movie - and I'm not one for slasher films! It's just the right combination of silly and scary, which I think makes it better than a lot of horror movies out there. Malcolm MacDowell was a badass, and Jaime King was much better than I expected. Definitely going to add Silent Night to my DVD collection.",1354665600,3,324,4.508474576271187
5341153,4,B009IV2ZCI,"Caught this one while it was in theatres for ever-so-briefly a time and though it was a very well made gore fest. Malcolm McDowall appears to be having a ball with his role as the Sheriff and provides hammy fun to the part. The addition of the flame thrower as Santa primary weapon is a brilliant one, although it doesn't provide nearly the best kill in the movie. That belongs to a bit of gore-tastic mess provided by a ice-chipper, recalling Fargo in the best way, only this time with a half-naked Cortney Palm instead of Steve Buscemi.",1354665600,,538,4.5
5341154,4,B009IV2ZCI,"Silent Night is a loose remake of the 1984 cult classic slasher film Silent Night, Deadly Night. It is good, and at times very good, but it does not top the original. The original had that 80's charm that this one lacks. It also had a better storyline as we got to follow the killer and see how he became a killer. In this one, we don't even know who the killer is until the end. I did like the mystery aspect, though. And Malcolm McDowell is a hoot as the deputy. I actually liked him in Rob Zombie's Halloween, even though many didn't. Here, McDowell is even better though. He acts like he's in a comedy instead of a horror film, hamming it up every chance he gets. There is some nudity, though not as much as in the 1984 original. In that movie, there were three women who got naked. In this one, there is only one. I do think that this version is a lot gorier, though. There are decapitations, stabbings, intestines, etc. If you are a slasher movie fan, I'd say to definitely check this one out. It's probably the second best slasher movie of 2012, topped only by the very fun Girls Gone Dead.",1354579200,8,1097,4.253588516746412
5341155,4,B009IV2ZCI,"I remember when I was a teenager and I heard they were doing a slasher film with a killer Santa Claus. 20/20 and everyone was up in arms about this concept and Silent Night, Deadly Night's hype was born. And to any horror fan or movie nut in general, when people complain and try to ban a film, those are the ones you have to go see first. The sad news is most of us did get to see this film when it hit home video a year later we did not think it was warranted of what the uproar was about. Now that being said, if Silent Night which is directed by Steven C. Miller would have been the film coming out at that time, I would have seen what the uproar was about. While this is a very loose remake of Silent Night, Deadly Night make no mistake about it, this film is a million times better than any other Christmas slasher film I have seen so far. In a small quiet town in Wisconsin, Santa Claus seems to be coming to town a day early and seems to know who has been naughty and nice. This film has some of the weirdest yet amusing one liners I ever heard, like one I felt could describe this film to a tee. ""Once you see it, you can't unsee it"". This film is a gore hound's wetdream, and there is no lack of killing, death scenes and fun ways to kill someone. I mean, the film starts off with an electric chair made out of Christmas lights.

Malcolm McDowell plays the town sheriff and you talk about someone who is having a ball in his role, Malcolm uses so many dopey and silly one liners that you will find yourself just waiting for what gem he will say next. When he keeps on describing a situation as putting toppings on a hamburger, you just sit there and think this is dark comedy fun. Jaime King plays the deputy who we learn is going thru a crisis of her own, this is her first Christmas single and she is spent trying to piece the puzzle together and stop the evil Claus. Jaime I was ready to write off after she followed up Sin City, with so many bad films till she got a second life with Mother's Day. And now this, she may have found her calling with these horror remakes.

The funny thing about this movie is that Steven with his wide range of characters touched on everything a small town could never ask for. Also, this film breaks a lot of taboos, and this viewer blesses them for doing so. A foul mouthed little girl gets killed in one of the more fun scenes of the film and when the mother of the girl talks to the police she claims that she did not wish for this to happen she just was hoping for some kind of break or something. Then, you have the perverted priest, who is also another scene stealer especially when in this town; every woman looks either like she stepped out of a modeling agency or off the pages of Playboy. Did anyone else ever notice that in this town, there is no lack of beautiful women and guys who are either drug users, dealers, clueless, perverts or drunks?

I think Steven made this film hoping for backlash, he wanted to give fans a fun horror film that had balls and did not care if it offended anyone. This film is what people expect when they see a slasher film and looks like all involved were having a blast with this film, and it shows when you watch it. This film gives so much fun, I mean I can go on and on about scenes that really shined in this film. When people think about Christmas films, they think of those films that your family or girlfriend drag you to with that feel good message and romance, thank god Steven made the cure for that with this film that is geared towards the horror fan. This film is bat shit insanity from start to finish, and if you sit there and you are not entertained by this very violent bloodbath full of hate, dark humor, cruelness and boobs then maybe you should seek out Four Christmases or something in that nature, this is by far the best Christmas themed horror film I have seen.

This is the rare case of someone following up a really great movie like The Aggression Scale with another great film Silent Night. In film much less horror, this feat these days is rare. All in all, this was a very fun film that offers something for every horror fan on your Christmas list. To me, this feels like the original and the one from the 80's feels like the inferior remake. This is a must see for all horror fans, perverts and anyone who is a fan of anything that pushes boundaries and does not conform to the norm. And fan boys, Steven heard your silent prayers he gives you a cameo of Jessica Cameron playing a nurse and Wanda from Todd and the Book of Pure Evil in some seductive outfit as well. This film has cult classic written all over it, and there is so much more I did not talk about like the topless chase scene, and the total brutality of the kills in this film. This film is vile, disgusting, perverted, cruel and full of humorous hate but damn if I was not entertained from start to finish.

5341156,3,B009IV2ZCI,"There seem to be three roads to take when making a horror film these days. The first and least used path is to make something original. Unfortunately few in charge these days are willing to risk anything to make an original film. The second is to make a sequel. The sad part here is that when an original film is made that succeeds it tends to go this route to far lesser productions. The last road is that of the remake. The bad news is that some people feel they need to improve what can be considered a classic and update it for the times, more often than not by adding a few more scenes of titillation or more gore. Most of these fail. But once in a while...

SILENT NIGHT is not actually a remake of the classic bad movie SILENT NIGHT DEADLY NIGHT, the film that caused such an outrage when it was released years ago. Yes, a few of the memorable items from that film are here including a killer dressed in a Santa costume and the antler scene. But this film feels more like a tribute to all of those low budget slasher flicks from the 80s instead of a remake.

Its Christmas time and in a small Midwestern town everyone is gearing up for the annual Christmas parade as well as the Santa costume contest. Aubrey Bradimore is a new deputy for the Sheriff's department. Still dealing with the recent loss of her husband, Aubrey is called in to work the night shift when another officer fails to show for work. Bad goes to worse when Aubrey is sent out to find him only to discover his body strapped to a chair and electrocuted in a basement as well as the dismembered body of a woman upstairs. For those of us watching we know full well who the killer was. Well sort of. It was a man dressed in a Santa outfit with a mask on to keep everyone from knowing up front who the killer is.

The cantankerous Sheriff Cooper (Malcolm McDowell) insults his deputies and rules with an iron fist. Discovering he has a possible serial killer in his town while a major event is schedule doesn't bother him. Instead he welcomes the chance to face down the killer without the help of the State Police or FBI since the roads to town are presently closed. To him this just means that the killer can't leave.

As Aubrey and Cooper as well as the other deputies search for clues, signs of what is about to happen creep up around town. Various town members each receive a small wrapped package but none of them open them. Had they done so perhaps a clue would have led them to the killer? Included in those who receive a package are the mayor, the sheriff and Aubrey's father, an ex-policeman in town.

The victims at first appear to fall prey to that most dangerous of things found in slasher movies; they all seem to be having sex. The deceased deputy was having a fling with a married woman. The killer's next victims are shooting low budget soft core porn in a motel room giving the film makers the chance to offer some nudity, thus satisfying the prerequisite T&A required for all low budget horror films.

As the body count rises, Aubrey continues to try and figure out just who this mass murderer is. Cooper, on the other hand, is ready to blame almost anyone. The clues slowly unravel a bit but in all honesty it doesn't matter. For slasher films of this sort its more about body count and the methods of murder that matter most.

As I said at the start this movie isn't quite a remake of the classic bad film of the same name. That movie revolved around a young boy scarred by a life in an orphanage who had traumatic experiences around Christmas time as well as having witnessed his parents murdered and raped by a man in a Santa outfit. A twist on that is offered here at the very end, but nothing that would lead us to the identity of the killer early on.

The movie seems to pay homage to those cheap slasher films of the 80s by following their patterns fairly faithfully rather than try and make something more meaningful. It offers the masked killer who seems unstoppable. It offers the gushing fake blood by the gallon, more than any wound would actually spout out. It offers victims who are either in the midst of sex or have a secret in their past that began this whole cycle to start with. And it offers a heroine who comes to the rescue before the final reel. It also offers one more classic 80s slasher item but I won't reveal that one. If you don't recognize it then you're not a fan of the genre.

Offering few scares but enough story to hold your interest, this movie isn't that bad. It will be a nice addition to the collection of holiday horrors on your shelf. If you're offended by that sort of thing it will be easy enough to walk by. But for those who have a fond remembrance of those 80s slasher films then you'll want to give this one a watch. The vibes that emanate from this one bring back the feeling of those films in spades.",1354233600,19,4841,4.322687224669603

[...]

This movie is nothing like the original Silent Night, Deadly Night movie. There isn't a real story to it. The serial killer's Santa Claus mask is scary whereas everything else is forced. I nearly fell off my bed from laughing at Silent Night, 2 Christmas Eves ago. Watching the killer Santa literally taze that bratty 12-year-old pill popper to death was and still is hilarious.

5341165,5,B009IV2ZCI,"Silent Night is an instant classic for fans of the Holiday horror genre and can stand alone from the original film in which it takes inspiration from. This isn't a direct remake, in fact in only minimally gives subtle hints to the original movie while creating a completely independent film that is just as dark and sinister. It is also very entertaining, filled with an atmospheric despair and solemnity on what should be a lighthearted, joyful night. The story is filled with tragic characters on a clear path to self-destruction which adds to the fact that horrors are unfolding in this small town that go far beyond your basic killer on the loose. After all Santa slays the naughty and there is no better place to find naughty souls than a town filled with despair. There are times when the action seems a bit rushed when it comes to scenes with the actual killer at work that is probably intentional because it also creates an element of unease and question surrounding the goings-on within the town.

Silent Night creates a dark and intense story that doesnt rely on black comedy to beg for acceptance from the audience. Instead of taking a tongue-in-cheek approach Miller has brought forth a very somber thriller that is suspenseful and serious. Something a lot of horror films shy from when it comes to slashers. The closest the film comes to comic relief is in Malcolm McDowells character who maintains a sterile, focused, Chuck Norris styled attitude about policing his town. The character is closer to the one he played in Rob Zombies Halloween. The blood and gore in this film isn't over-the-top  but Miller never shies away from the graphic kills or gory matter either. Everything about Silent Night is balanced and toned in a way that allows the story to draw you into the nightmare that plays out. There are a few scary moments where the element of surprise caught me off guard. I jumped back in my seat during a few scenes. This is a great slasher film that should not be considered a remake and should be an instant classic with the majority of horror fans.",1433462400,,2074,4.695054945054945
5341166,2,B009IV2ZCI,"I'm not really sure what I think about this movie. I liked it but then I didn't. It's suppose to be a loose remake of Silent Night Deadly Night but it didn't feel like a remake at all which I think was good. I hated it because of the terrible acting & the feeling I had after the movie was over. Silent Night seemed like it could've been so much better than what it was but so much about the movie was off for me. If there is a part 2, I hope it will make me want to go back & check out part 1 again & I do hope there will be a part 2 just because I like to see how it continues where part 1 left off",1432080000,,600,3.5877862595419847

There are nods to the grindhouse classic that we all know and love but for the most part the villain, set pieces and plot line are pretty shiny and new.  Miller's direction is assured and crisp and the cast is game for the grime of the horror genre.  Silent Night wallows in the conventions of the genre in the best possible way presenting tons of nudity, gore and humor.

5341175,5,B009IV2ZCI,"I re-watched this to get in the Christmas mood, and it was much better than I had remembered. It is a very loose remake of Silent Night, Deadly Night, but creates a new story and is a breathe of fresh air in the 'killer Santa' genre. Killer Santa is a mystery and keeps you guessing til the very end. The film is very colorful and makes it feel like Christmas.

Jaime King stars as Aubrey Bradimore, a deputy who has lost her husband earlier in the year. She's forced to come into work on Christmas Eve to find the sadistic Santa Claus killer. The death and gore effects were great. There are at least three scenes that pays tribute to the original 'Silent Night Deadly Night' I highly recommend SILENT NIGHT!!!",1419033600,,711,4.427480916030534
5341176,4,B009IV2ZCI,"Director Steven C. Minors Silent Night qualifies as an above-average horror chiller.  This grisly, R-rated, 94-minute, cinematic massacre excels on the basis of its fidelity to standard-issue slasher movie formula with a valiant but vulnerable, gun-toting heroine, its body count, and its sadistically staged slaughter scenes.  A gruesome guy in traditional Santa Claus garb goes around slaying apparently unsuspecting but not altogether wholesome citizens in a variety of ways.  Our villain electrocutes a sex addict; shocks as well as skewers a foul-mouthed brat of a girl; eviscerates three people; hacks up more with an ax; mulches a naked woman in a shredder, and charbroils an armed policeman with a flame-thrower.  The image of Santa Claus armed with a flame-thrower alone should haunt you long after Silent Night fades away.  Indeed, this deranged maniac amounts to an exemplary but not quite iconic monster in the classical sense of Freddy Kruger from Nightmare of Elm Street, Michael Myers of Halloween, Leatherface of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or Jason of Friday the 13th fame.  Nevertheless, Santa Claus looks scary enough with his plastic mask to send a shiver down your spine.  He murders in cold blood without a qualm and takes delight in doling out his deadly deeds.  Malice in Wonderland scenarist Jayson Rothwell and Minor stock their movie with interesting, off-beat characters.  For example, they have a cynical Santa Claus, a mom with a heart ailment, a leering minister, and a horny cop.  In the words of one Santa Claus character, Silent Night aint all candy canes and pretty lights.  Minor displays more than enough style in depicting the action.  Squeamish viewers should shun this blood-soaked saga of death and dismemberment, while gorehounds will wallow in all this wanton mayhem with glee galore.

Silent Night gets off to a terrific start with our Santa Claus clad villain electrocuting a deputy sheriff with a string of colored Christmas lights.  The ill-fated deputy complains that he didn't know the woman with whom he had intercourse was Santas wife.  The cuckolded Mr. Claus fries him to death.  As it turns out before he dies, the cop realizes that the man who kills him isn't a harried husband but a sick f-word.  Cue the open credits and then cut to deputy sheriff Aubrey Bradimore (Jamie King) waking up to a phone call from her Sheriff Cooper (Malcolm McDowell) who wants her to suit up and come into work.  It seems that the horny cop who died in the first scene had taken over her shift but since he disappeared her presence is required.  During these first few minutes we also learn that the remote Midwestern hamlet of Cryer is slowly going out of business.  Aubrey is reluctant to pull her shift work.  Meanwhile, a bitchy little girl demands that her mother take her to the shopping mall.  She goes so far as to knock the bottle of heart medicine out of her moms hands to get her attention. Not long afterward, the doorbell rings and the little girl finds herself standing before a towering Santa Claus.  Without hesitation, jolly ole St. Nick knocks her unconscious with the use of a cattle prod and then reams her out.  The sheriffs dispatcher sends Aubrey out to an abandoned house where she finds the body of Deputy Sheriff Jordan.  Sheriff Cooper is pretty obnoxious as lawmen go, too.  Only a few characters come out of this tale of terror in one piece.  If you like horror movies that will raise your hackles, youll enjoy Silent Night.",1419033600,,3491,4.90289608177172

5341181,4,B009IV2ZCI,"If you are expecting a remake of the classic 80s slasher 'Silent Night, Deadly Night', you will be disappointed. This movie only bears aesthetic similarities, with none of the weird back story surrounding the killer, who is indeed an enigma in this movie. Silent Night definitely lacks in terms of plot. There really isn't one. A deranged Santa slasher carved his way through a small town, with cliche after cliche from amateur pornographers to a greedy priest. At times, these feel stretched.

What saves Silent Night, and warrants the four stars, is that it is a lot of fun. The gore effects are the crme de la crme of practical blood and guts. No CGI nonsense here that's easily noticable. Wood chippers, kitchen knives, flame throwers, the film looks and feels professionally done on every front. The acting is also good throughout, with of course a terrific performance by Malcolm McDowell. The Santa slasher himself looks creepy, and carries off the film's deadly hijinks well, although I do feel more dread could have helped this film reach its full potential.

If you like slasher movies, and want to see a modern one that doesn't suck, you can do a heck of a lot worse than Silent Night.",1409702400,,1196,4.7729468599033815

D: Steven C. Miller
C: Malcolm McDowell, Jaime King, Donal Logue, Ellen Wong, Brendan Fehr, Andrew Cecon, Lisa Marie, Courtney Jane-White, Erik J. Berg, Rick Skene
P: A homicidal killer dressed in a Santa Claus outfit kills off the naughty boys and girls of a small town with a police officer and the local sheriff hot on his heels.

Enjoyable remake / update of Silent Night, Deadly Night doesn't pretend to be anything other then what it is. Now whether or not a horror film that aims to be nothing more then fun, entertaining trash is a worthy ambition is up to viewers.

The cast strikes just the right chord throughout with their performances. The scenes that pay homage to the original feel perfectly placed into this film's proceedings. There's a few interesting story elements that expand the scope of the original and leave the door open for future sequels. And a scene in which a motel patron flees from her room, trying desperately in vein to get away from the film's killer Santa has cult classic written all over it.

Silent Night might not be the most ambitious horror film out there. It might not be the freshest film out there either, but it gets two things right. One, the people that made Silent Night took from a film that had potential, potential that wasn't realized in the original film and improved upon that. Two, the film never loses focus of what it sets out to do or what it wants to be and does just that precisely. With that in mind, the film is a success on its own terms.

5341193,5,B009IV2ZCI,"SILENT NIGHT is a 2012 horror film directed by Steven C. Miller & starring Malcolm McDowell, Jaime King, Donal Logue, Ellen Wong, & Brendan Fehr. A Sheriff & his deputies of a remote Midwestern town searches for a man, dress up as a Santa Claus, who is killing those who been very naughty on Christmas Eve. SILENT NIGHT is a loose remake of the controversial 1984 film, SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT. For a holiday-theme slasher, SILENT NIGHT really does stab it's mark...hard. Steve C. Miller had created a film that it's in spirit with the 1980's slasher era. This is made by someone who clearly love the genre. This a dark, sleazy, & delightfully cheesy blood soaked thrill ride. This killer Saint Nick with his red suit, fake white beard, & transparent mask is truly a memorable screen villain. The acting is quite good here, Malcolm McDowell pretty much hams it up, but who's clearly having fun in the role of the sheriff. The film's look is very vibrant in it's colors & contrast is very solid, which makes it very crisp in hi-def. The film's death scenes are simply brutal & does not disappoint. Father Christmas dashing through his victims in some very unique ways, from christmas lights to a flamethrower. As before, SILENT NIGHT is a slasher film from a simpler time. It doesn't bring anything new to the table & nothing ground breaking here. Nevertheless, it knows what it is & gets the job done. It's not a great slasher, but it's a damn good slasher. Overall, SILENT NIGHT is a huge crowd pleaser that should be watched with a group of friends. It's straightforward, to the point, loads of fun, & will delight anyone who craves that hack 'n' slash flick. Truly a Christmas movie that should be watched every year around the holiday season. For first time viewing, it's a rental, but for horror lovers, it's worth adding to your collection, a BUY. MERRY CHRISTMAS & HAPPY NEW YEAR!",1387670400,,1890,4.661676646706587
5341194,1,B009IV2ZCI,"This is a remake that sure makes me think of what Ricky Chapman said in the second Silent Night Deadly Night back in 1988. That is ""Garbage Day!"" Because that is exactly what this movie was! It sucked so bad it was unreal. This movie was so bad that it made the sequels that came out one after the other back in the 80's and early 90's look good. I would especially take Silent Night Deadly Night 2 like I mentioned above over this. Even though it was three quarters of it flashbacks as told by Ricky to his doctor. There wasn't one character in the movie except for maybe the girl Brenda (Ellen Wong) in it that were likable. Even as much as I love Malcolm McDowell as an actor this is one movie even he could not save. Like others on here have mentioned there wasn't anybody in that damn hillbilly village that wasn't a drug addict or obnoxious except for like I said Brenda. Even the main girl played by Jaime King was a weak character who no way in hell should have been a cop. I hate to imagine how bad of a cop she would be in a city with a high murder rate like Detroit, Chicago, New York City or Los Angeles or even Youngstown, Ohio for that matter. She was no Ziva David from N.C.I.S. or Joss Carter or Shaw from Person Of Interest that's for sure. Basically the movie was nothing but white trash throughout it. I think I could have made a better remake than this garbage! Another fault of the movie that everyone of the others seemed to have except the original was there was no snow anywhere at all in the movie! Common people where is the snow?! They act like snow became extinct after the original 1984 one. The only reference I could find in the movie to the original was there is a scene just like in the original where a young mans grandfather is catatonic and he grabs his grandson's wrist and says ""Christmas Eve is the scariest night of the whole damned year!"" I can understand why they just simply called it ""Silent Night"" and left Deadly Night out of the title. Heed my warning and please do not waste your money buying this movie like I did. It was a huge waste of money! And if you do I hope you liked it more than me. Merry Christmas! Watch the original instead.",1387065600,,2186,4.232057416267943
5341195,4,B009IV2ZCI,"This film is ever so loosely based on Silent Night, Deadly Night (a 1984 slasher flick of some renown).  And by loosely, I mean maybe one or two partial gags from the original film made it into this so-called remake.  Unfortunately, they did the story in reverse, which made precious little sense.  In this one, the deadly Santa felt compelled to wear a mask.  Why?  He was lost in a sea of boundless Santa suits and no one knew him in any regard, why wear a mask?  It didn't make him any scarier, in fact, it made him more obscure and random, just another run-of-the-mill psycho.  Most of the `naughty' people were so overtly/cartoonishly bad it came as no surprise they were targets.  A lot of the elements employed were clichs (running an ax down a wall to supposedly create a scary noise), the victim who can't run worth beans and doesn't even try, the obligatory jerk in charge (played with stupefying ineptitude by hack actor Malcolm McDowell), and a weepy/wary heroine (Jaime King).  Everything about this movie is familiar; it plays it too safe for a genre with specific expectations.  Compared to the original, this is quite tame.  Multiple times, they pull back, hiding someone's death (which ultimately defeats the purpose).  But.  On a certain level, it (begrudgingly) works (because it is rudimentary and does just what it set out to do).  It'll never be a classic though.  I can't see a series made from this one offering (although they certainly left the barn door open wide enough to suggest as much).
It's a keeper.",1386806400,,1532,4.706766917293233
5341196,4,B009IV2ZCI,"The blonde makes a fine wall decoration, and the topless brunette is quite trashy and chippy (though I was TOTALLY hoping that Santa would beat her to death with her own leg- what a wasted opportunity!)

Silent Night is quite the outrageous horror movie, though to be honest for a while I was convinced I was going to give it a 3-star rating due to the weak writing that's so forced and uninteresting in the beginning that I almost turned it over.  The strength of this movie relies entirely on the gruesome deaths and nothing else.  I mean I sort of sympathize with the police woman, not only because she's pretty, but because she's vulnerable and strives to be an excellent cop only to end up believing she's not good enough due to coming up short in finding the murderer time and time again.

There's also a fair amount of cliches- obviously the sheriff would be proud that he's experienced in his job and knows how to catch a murderer better than anyone else while inadvertently disrespecting the other police officers.  You can guess what happens to him at the end.  Let's just say, he ain't the hero!

Silent Night also has another high point- you're constantly guessing which person is doing all the killings.  You'll never guess which one!  And my goodness what splendid killings they are too!  About as violent as they come.  Of course each one is greatly exaggerated (except for the generous religious lady who was miraculously spared- how come?) but the blood-squirting scrumptiousness of each murder is solid enough to elevate the rating to a 4.  And the final 20 minutes are quite spectacular too.  Who brought out the flamethrower?

I'm curious how the one father can let his attractive blonde-haired daughter be sleazy and not seem to care what she's doing with the guy in the other room.  I mean come on!  And if you're still not convinced Silent Night is a pretty outrageous horror that doesn't hold anything back, get this- a 14-year old girl dies.  Of course you won't really mind once you see what she's like.  It begs the question- why is it okay to kill kids but not old ladies?  Merry Christmas everyone!",1386374400,,2127,4.654155495978553
5341197,2,B009IV2ZCI,"This is a detailed review regarding the gore filled 2012 remake, Silent Night, with some in depth comparisons of the original 1984, Silent Night, Deadly Night, thrown in for good measure.  It begins with a goofy short narrative of how dedicated I was just to get to a theater to see it...

Silent Night was a limited release movie when it came out in a handful of theaters.  I ignored my instincts and had to go see this on the big screen; traveling to a small town north of Philadelphia, which was a nightmare in its own right... getting lost, almost tail ending another car, my girlfriend's dog puking while riding shotgun on her lap (the dog could not handle my quality maneuvering).  It was like a dire warning of things to come.  Finally getting within the vicinity, we slowly circled the mall in anticipation looking for the Cineplex that was showing this straight to tape torment like Clark Griswold fiending for a glimpse of Wally World from inside his gaudy green family truckster.  I pulled the car in quick as a flash, holding back the urge to make a mad dash.  We left her dog in the car with some water to sip, then headed toward the goal at the end of this trip.  There it was, big and in lights, in bold block letters, Silent Night.  I bought two tickets, my eyes full of glee, hoping for some awesomeness that we were about to see.  We headed inside worried about finding a seat, but were really quite shocked not another soul making a peep.  I played it cool and considered the reality; that we were about to view our own private showing...

As the screen went black and the end credits rolled I was in somewhat denial.  We got up from our seats and shuffled out of the theater.  This was Silent Night, a film I had been totally motivated to see due to the absolute and total dedication I have to the original and its first sequel. I have spread the joy of those two B movie gems for many years from coast to coast.  I admit I was very cautious about this one amongst many of terrible 80's remakes and outright butcheries, but I put that to the side in hopes of this movie doing the original justice.  Well, it goes without saying that by the conclusion of the film I had a few choice words that I had to get off my chest, ""Punishment is necessary, it is good, it is absolute"".  Wise words of wisdom I had gathered from watching the original 84' classic since it first hit the video stores and viewed on the old VCR.  I began weighing the pros and cons that flashed insistently for consideration.

Surprisingly, there were actually a few good things about this remake.  Paying homage to the original mainly in the content of some of the creative deaths with a few twists added.  There is an extra graphic method of brutal death utilized on a porn star... the wood chipper.  This tool of terror was also employed in an episode of the late 80's television series, Friday the 13th: The Series; in the 1993 straight to tape horror flop, The Stepfather 3; and 1996's, Fargo.  The addition of a flame throwing rampage was an added plus and bonus, but that is about where it ends sadly.  The extreme gory blood bath that poured forth from the screen was the glue that held this sickened piece of celluloid together on the silver screen.

Right out of the starting gate I have to say that the acting was atrocious.  Aside from the great gore effects this movie needed all the assistance it could muster.  I really do not mind bad acting if it does not take away from the film and most of the time for a movie like this it can actually add some entertainment value.  Jaime King's stale performance was about as gripping as watching flies on a turd.  Even the great Malcolm McDowell, phoned in his sluggish performance.

Do not get me wrong, the original contained some pretty lame acting as well, but it was so bad it was good.  The original also made up for this by several 80's character actors doing their damnedest to sell their part.  A prime example is Will Hare (Enter the Ninja, Back to the Future), who played a off his rocker Grandpa for a short moment.  Another example is B movie scream queen, Linnea Quigley (Savage Streets, Return of the Living Dead), who played the scantily clad and doomed Denise.  Britt Leach (Weird Science, The Great Outdoors), played a likeable and nave Mr. Sims.  Mother Superior, played by Lilyan Chauvin, was pure evil and convincingly wretched; you actually begin to root for Billy to get his revenge...

In Silent Night, the overdose of Santas in town due to a Santa contest was supposed to assist the plot so that it was harder to identify the killer surrounded by fat fellow fans of the red and white suit.  This totally fails and actually takes away from the bold image of a lone psychopath roaming the streets searching for his prey.  Regardless, this same Santa killer is a ginormous corn fed fiend, who clearly wears a disturbingly odd looking mask, and is as vocal as a mime in that freakin gimp mask from Pulp Fiction.  Sorry, but there is no mistaking who the killer is.  (*Fans of the original are familiar with few appearances of other individuals dressed as Santa that were carefully used and actually assisted the plot)

Most importantly these A-holes would not even let the twisted killer utter the word I was itching to hear the entire film, not even once.  NAUGHTY!  Instead we received a lame and halfhearted, ""Not nice"".  Are you freakin' kidding me... not nice?  Come on!  The whole time I kept telling myself to wait patiently, that this mute masked poor excuse for a killer Santa would get around to saying what needed to be said; a nice loud, ""Naughty"" or ""Punish"".  I am guessing this is the result of pitiful rushed writing and bad influence from other classics such as Halloween and Friday the 13th (the originals, not the freakin' remakes).  The masked silent killer works wonders in the right film and franchise, but not with this movie.  There should be no confusion as to what motivates the killer if they would have stuck to a winning formula from the first film.

In the original 1984, Silent Night, Deadly Night, one of the characteristics that made the killer, Billy, more interesting and even garnered some sympathy was his well put together motivation.  Witnessing the murder of his family, massacred by a deranged murderer dressed as Santa is what made him unbalanced to begin with.  It did not help the issue by visiting his sick minded senile grandpa the same evening prior to the family's grave encounter and receiving a disturbing twisted take on what happens to those that have been naughty on Christmas Eve.  This was further fleshed out and built upon by Billy and his little brother Ricky being raised in a Catholic orphanage in the middle of nowhere, Utah.  The wicked and cold hearted, Mother Superior, who ran the orphanage with an iron fist clenching a rosary, dished out unlimited abuse upon the young boy without remorse.  This mental and physical anguish added heaps of further torment to his fragile psyche.  With his traumatic childhood full of violence and abuse it was no surprise when Billy finally snaps... the Christmas Eve night of unchecked punishment kicked off with a wisecracking supervisor dangling from a strong string of Christmas lights, boots violently kicking in their final death throws.

Now that prior description should get some of you enticed to buy Silent Night, Deadly Night: Parts 1 & 2 right here on Amazon.  It is a deal at only $9.99 for both films together.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Silent-Night-Deadly-Night/dp/B00ALZZC5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Silent Night, Deadly Night</a>

Again, this film relied heavily on the graphic gore effects galore to sell this canned ham to devoted fans of the original like me and hold it together in between a jumbled Jerky plot.  When this one hits the $5 dollar garbage bin in the back of Wal-Mart then maybe I will give it another shot.  Until then I will be content watching the two B movie gold nuggets of Christmas macabre that are still better after a quarter of a century.

Pros: They did a good job or trying to weave the favorite scenes form the original. They also made sure to have a bit of a twist in the end. The movie was pretty at points, the production value is certainty higher in this one than in the first.
Cons: While the premise is cool, and the santa is a lot creepier in this one. This movie also lacks the spirit of the original.

There are a couple nods to the original film sprinkled here and there, but you this film sort of stands on it's own.

On a chilly Christmas ever in a small Wisconsin town, deputy Aubrey is forced to come into work after another deputy fails to show up. Setting off on patrol, it's not long before Aubrey begins finding the bodies left behind by a maniac dressed as Santa. In a town decked out for Christmas with dozens of people dressed as Santa, can  Aubrey and the sheriff stop the killer before he strikes again?

If you are looking for a deep story, with a focus on character and plot....this ain't it. On the other hand if you want to see Santa stuff someone into a woodchipper, then pick this movie up by all means. The acting isn't bad, and while Malcolm McDowell is horribly mis-cast as a small town sheriff, ""Silent Night"" is worth watching just to see him chew up scenery. The F/X aren't bad, and while not terribly bloody, enough of the red stuff spills so that most gorehounds will be satisfied. Plus the movie earns bonus points for including a quick reference to ""garbage day"".",1371081600,,1786,5.41726618705036

The killer's identity is telegraphed early on but the script diverts your attention enough to provide a small surprise.  Malcolm McDowell adds a little panache as the stodgy sheriff; Jaime King is a serviceable deputy and Donal Logue chews up the scenery as a ""traveling"" St. Nick.

Police Sheriff Aubrey Bradimore is left to find this psycho Santa before he slashes his way through town on Christmas Eve! SILENT NIGHT is bottom of the barrel Slasher filth with few redeeming qualities. Steven C. Miller is sure to include all of the gratuitous nudity and gore that fans would have come to expect from a SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT remake, but without any of the more entertaining elements that made the 1984 film a cult-classic and Christmas tradition. The few characters and loose plot points that do exist are entirely inconsequential to the film, and serve only as filler between the bloodshed. One would hope that Miller would then overcompensate for the lack of substance with a series of jaw-dropping death scenes, but even these are mild and unmemorable at best. SILENT NIGHT has very little chance of surviving the holiday season once it is taken off the store shelves and forgotten.

5341224,1,B009IV2ZCI,"Let me start by saying that i am a huge fan of Christmas slasher movies, particularly around the holiday season. Don't Open'till Christmas-Silent Night,Deadly Night-Black Christmas-Christmas Evil..This one however lacks the brains the balls and the fun of all its predecessors. Inventive yet uninspired killings, mayhem with no edge to it whatsoever, completely flat, cliched and uninteresting characters, and hooks so dull that you don't feel them at all. What a waste of money and resources it took to produce this!? I can't believe so many people actually liked this movie. What a dumb world this is becoming... If you were as dissappointed by this movie as i was and you still need a fix of holiday carnage then maybe check out some of the films i mentioned earlier, or check out the two versions of the Tales From The Crypt story titled "" And all through the House.."" featured in the original TFTC Amicus movie as well as on the HBO show.",1356566400,,943,4.791411042944786

5341229,3,B009IV2ZCI,"A few years back when remakes were running rampant, I decided that I hated them. I made this decision before even viewing the bulk, as so many of them SUCKED. Was this fair; most likely not. Hell, Cronenberg's ""The Fly,"" one of my favorite films, is a remake. I suppose that in 2012, I am more open minded to the idea of remaking horror films that I loved as a child of the 80's. Or maybe I've simply ""accepted"" the fact that it simply will not stop (kinda like a Terminator). I honestly think that remakes stand a chance if they a. Are sans Michael Bay b. Try to add something that actually adds to the film and serves a genuine purpose (never put a garnish on a dish that is inedible) c. Are remakes of films that are not overtly iconic or commercial. <- Okay, so I understand that ""Silent Night, Deadly Night"" is infamous for the parental outrage (which is just ludicrous, imo) and such, but is it a stellar horror film that offers anything truly memorable, other than a 'boobs and antlers' scene? My answer is no. It's a cult film; it's an interesting film; it's a must for die-hard horror collectors. All of that aside, ""Silent Night, Deadly Night"" is NOT A Nightmare On Elm Street.

I think that I was most apprehensive about Silent Night because of the absolute train-wreck from HELL that Black X-mas (06) is. The original Black Christmas is chilling, stylish and effective despite its lack of nudity, sex and gratuitous violence. And the killer is never seen; the POV angle allows the power of suggestion. The remake is an absolute unintentional comedy, as it fails to truly be a black comedy or horror film; it's a yuletide log alright.

Okay, rant over. RE: Silent Night. It's good! It's not the best horror film that I've seen, even in recent years, but it's decent. It has a fantastic pace to it. Also, Jaime King is a great actress. I never thought that I'd say this judging by her stint in films such as ""White Girls."" Similarly, King also adds a lot to the remake of Troma's ""Mother's Day."" Something tells me that scream queen is her thing. She's not only beautiful; she can actually make me believe her and like her, and that's not an easy feat. So, pros: Good acting overall, great pacing, great FX, straight forward approach, does not try to be bigger than its britches.

This is more of a re-imagining than a remake. There are little nods and homages to the original, but Silent Night is a film of its own. That being said, a semi ""con"" is the fact that I miss the ""Mother Superior"" back-story. The orphanage adds a vulnerability to the the original that is missing here. On the other hand, making the ""killer"" faceless (masked) makes the film more suspenseful? The anonymous killer puts the audience on the edge, unlike the original, whereas we know from the very beginning whom is doing the killing and why. The ""Jason"" and ""Michael Meyers"" esque anonymity given to the killer Santa turns Silent Night into a 21st century slasher film, despite its recycled device. Too many horror remakes fail because 1. They should not be done in the first place and 2. They paint by numbers for most of the film, but then get en-snarled in the ""psyche"" of the killer. Black X-mas (06) is a mess on several levels, but the fact that ""Billy"" is given an elaborate and inane back-story is a part of the film's major flaws. Also, Rob Zombie's re-imagining of Halloween also suffers from the pitfall of ""too much"" character development and back-story. So, despite what might seem like griping, I maintain that Silent Night is a straight up horror film that delivers.

One major con is the LACK OF SNOW. C'mon now! Mountainous America in DECEMBER sans snow???? I'm not thrilled with the ending--a lack luster attempt to explain the killer's motives--but I am assuming that a SN part 2 is possible. This might be a wild guess, but will it be called ""Deadly Night?"" The shortened title could be a clever marketing move, but maybe I'm reading too much into this.

My favorite scene of the film is the Suicide Girls-esque photo shoot turned Christmas tree lot chase. It's proof positive that the director simply had a blast making this.",1356220800,,4134,4.581081081081081
5341230,3,B009IV2ZCI,"Well, I was expecting alot more of this movie for a remake of a great classic. It is absolutely nothing like the original version. Where is Mother Superior and the orphanage? Why call this a remake of a classic movie. It wasn't. This movie would have been a better Christmas horror movie with a different name. It's an okay movie, nonetheless, but far from fantastic. I much rather the original version myself. I do like the fact that Malcolm McDowell starred in this film. The movie kept me entertained and I was never bored. A good movie to watch during the christmas holiday season for scares, but that's all. There aren't too many really good Christmas horror movies out there except the original series (1-5) of Silent Night Deadly Night, Black Christmas (original & remake), this mediocre remake, and last year's release of Saint Nick, which is roughly about the same rating as well. Whatever you do, if you do decide you want a Santa horror movie, STAY FAR FAR AWAY from last year's movie titled ""SLAUGHTER CLAUS"". It was the worst movie ever, if it can even be classified as a movie. It was so bad, I immediately listed it on ebay right after I finished it, and finishing it was the most painful thing I ever had to do.",1356048000,2,1227,4.5565610859728505

5341234,4,B009IV2ZCI,"This was an enjoyable christmas horror.  Having said that I would like to point out that you should not for one second even consider this film a remake of Silent Night Deadly Night.  The first thing to note is that the slasher Santa is not just limited to Silent Night Deadly Night.  I actually feel this film has more in common with Don't Open Till Christmas than Silent Night Deadly Night because of the choice to center the narrative around the local police force trying to catch the killer.  What differs Silent Night Deadly Night from this is pretty much everything other than the weapon of choice being an axe and one famous impale. The killer has very little to no backstory and is not so much a character as he is just a force in a Santa suit.  Silent Night Deadly Night also is more heartbreaking and controversial because it dealt seriously enough with an orphanage run by an abusive mother superior who clearly contributed to the trauma.  This type of subject matter makes an audience more uncomfortable than bare breasts and gore.

This is an enjoyable film that manages to surprise with some serious character moments. I can not agree with whatever marketing that states this as being a remake.  It clearly is not one.  It is another wonderful addition to the limited, but enjoyable canon of christmas horror films out there.  AND IT'S GOT MALCOLM MCDOWELL SAYING SOME RIDICULOUS STUFF.

For those interested in other psycho santa movies check out Christmas Evil and - as mentioned above - Don't Open Till Christmas.",1355616000,,1529,4.7320754716981135
5341235,3,B009IV2ZCI,"There is nothing like a holiday slasher film to put one in the proper mood for Christmas-ween. The film opens with a double homicide without showing us Santa's face. It then builds the character of Deputy Aubrey Bradimore (Jaime King) who works for Sheriff Cooper (Malcolm McDowell) who doesn't want outside help with his homicide problem. While building Aubrey's character we are introduced to suspects such as the creepy priest, the bad Santa, and the talking catatonic Gramps.

The defining feature of a ""Silent Night"" film is the antler scene. I liked the original one far better. Likewise, the story was better developed in the original. In this remake, the characters are better developed, but lack good dialouge. It is certainly a viewable film and good addition to the collection. Ellen Wong plays a receptionist at the police department. She was Knives Chau, Scott Pilgrim's girlfriend.

5341237,3,B009IV2ZCI,If you have never seen the original film..this is a pretty good movie. It has some good gore effects in it.

5341238,5,B009IV2ZCI,"I have to tell you that I am not a fan of current horror films. You apparently have to have an enormous capacity to absorb all its violence and gore, and find enjoyment in that. And, if people buy, Hollywood gladly pays and makes. Watching ""Silent Night,"" these kinds of thoughts passed through my mind, but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised to see that there was order in the disorder, that is, there is actually a story in this movie, a redeeming one, if you will - or so I think.

Cryer, Wyoming, seems to be a quite small town USA that, like the rest of our cities, is being absorbed by unproductive values - there is no escape, really. It all begins on Christmas day, when a guy is killed in an electric chair, with Christmas lights, by a Santa Claus-like figure. However, this Santa has an ugly plastic mask. He goes on and keeps murdering people, with the pattern being that all this people were bad - pornographers, brats, pervert priests, adulterers --, sinners, for a lack of a better word. It is at this day that Officer Aubrey Bradimore (Jaime King) is ordered by Sheriff Cooper (Malcolm McDowell), her superior, to show up to work. She informs him that she can't do it this day, but to no avail. Aubrey gets deep into the assignment, proving that she has a better mind that Cooper, who is an old-fashioned kick-ass, bring-it-on kind of guy. However, they have to work together to stop this maniac Santa on the most wonderful time of the year.

The great thing about ""Silent Night,"" is that just when you thought that it was going to be another typical slasher movie, and that there was no meaning in all the killings, by the end you will get all the answers. In doing so, you will see that small towns are not what they used to be and that ""Christmas makes people crazy."" Ah, there is an extended nude scene which will probably remind you of the classic ""I Spit on your grave."" The Blu-ray includes a behind-the-scenes documentary and deleted scenes.

5341240,4,B009IV2ZCI,"One of my favorite holiday movies of all time is ""Bad Santa.""  Why am I telling you this?  Well, a review is for you and not for me.  If you didn't like that film then you REALLY won't like this film.  You've been warned.

But I also really liked the film ""Thankskilling.""  If you take that film, move the plot to Christmas, take out the turkey and replace it with Santa, add decent production values - as well as add reasonable acting, direction, and writing - you have ""Silent Night.""  If you have seen that ""wonderful"" Thanksgiving film, the opening scene - you won't forget it - is somewhat reproduced here with a gal that is running from Santa.  Now, just like ""Thankskilling,"" she is absent certain parts of clothing, with makes certain parts of her anatomy do interesting things.  That's all that I will say on a family site.  But there also is a slight bouncy nod during this same scene to ""Fargo.""  I'm guessing that you'll guess what that nod is.

This film ""borrows"" ideas from many other movies that I've seen, but it does so in more subtle ways than ""Cabin in the Woods,"" a movie that I panned not too long ago.  There is ""Fargo"" as I've already discussed.  But there is also ""Silence of the Lambs"" I believe as well.  Watch the main female lead here, and a few scenes here and there.  I argue that she is somewhat like the Jodie Foster character in that masterpiece.  There also might be a slight nod to ""Misery"" here as well.  There is a scene similar to a Kathy Bates nightmare at one point.  However, this movie does a good job of not devolving into torture porn.  I really don't like it when a film goes in that direction, and this film does not make that mistake.

Really a 3.5 most likely, but I'm rounding up since, well, while it's not as good as ""Bad Santa,"" it's certainly more killer than ""Thankskilling.""",1355184000,,1830,4.402985074626866

Deputy Aubrey Bradimore is assigned the task of finding this homicidal saint nick before he can attack again. She is also unaware of her connection to him which is revealed later in the movie. This isn't a whodunit by any means. We clearly see the psycho santa in the first five minutes putting together his costume. There is lots and lots of blood and a nerve wracking woodchipper scene that would make anyone look away. Also, Santa attacks a bitchy teenage girl with a stun gun which is also great to see.

Silent Night has all the elements that rock my slasher world.

This re imaging of the classic 80's film is done to perfection, leaving in key aspects such as a few great lines and even an infamous kill scene via Deer antlers. The new kills are great,very graphic yet not so over the top that they seem ridiculous. All the characters are amazing and lend to a never a dull moment film.

The dialogue is well done, entertaining ,funny and clever.
Jamie King who in her own rights has become a great Scream Queen is excellent as Aubrey Bradimore and of course Malcolm McDowell steals every scene he's in as the Sheriff.
There are so many creative and fun kill scenes ,You have a wood chipper,axes,Knives, blow torches,death by Christmas lights,a Pruning axe just to name some.

Of course, nothing can go sideways as quickly as an eighties horror remake (Im looking your way Children of the Corn.) Silent Night avoids the various pitfalls of the genre to deliver a solid horror film with a good sense of humor and some great set pieces.

Malcolm McDowell chews scenery admirably while Jamie King is solid as the straight woman lead. The film rises above the average with the chase of Cortney Palm ending in a Fargoesque way is so well done it simply raises the film well above the average. That scene along with some impressive stunt work throughout and a story that doesnt get in the way of the fun creates a film that is simply better than it had to be.
