4114458,4,B003EQN5UO,"Each season gets harder and harder to follow, IMHO, but worth rewatching through it, until it all ""clicks"". Some geniuses will grok the entire evolving series plot line(s) the first time through. Wish I were one of them!  YMMV. Still recommendable to RvB or Halo fans.",1404950400,,268,4.826086956521739

4114460,5,B003EQN5UO,This is the best Red versus Blue season ever ... of all time!  Perfect blending of their new WA of telling serious stories with the very best of their comedy. Superb!,1403481600,,166,4.354838709677419

4114463,5,B003EQN5UO,Not one season is a let down. Such a great show for true halo fans - comes across as stupid humor...but think they have done a great job with one hell of a story line.,1399939200,,167,3.8
4114464,5,B003EQN5UO,Rooster Teeth takes it up a notch with acutal animated fights in this one. Pretty good action sequences. Classic Rooster Teeth.,1399852800,,127,5.095238095238095

4114466,5,B003EQN5UO,Love RVB and love that they are on amazon prime. I wish that all the way up to 11 was on here. One day i'll buy the set to support Rooster Teeth.,1398556800,2,145,3.5625
4114467,5,B003EQN5UO,Love halo. Watched all this series since its first came out. Hilarious and funny. Great job to rooster teeth. If your lookin for more of their hilarity check the rooster teeth youtube channel.,1395964800,,192,4.848484848484849
4114468,5,B003EQN5UO,"gotta love the good, bad and weird.  It's a bit of back story, but it's a coherent back story, and we're all here to see Monty Oum's coreography and each years new HALO armor fashion changes anyway.",1394323200,,198,4.351351351351352
4114469,3,B003EQN5UO,"I liked the dialog and the voices, but the plot could use some more work. Seemed to meander a bit.",1394236800,,98,3.95
4114470,2,B003EQN5UO,Never finished animation is typically something I do not watch. May try to go back and watch at some point.,1393804800,,107,4.4
4114471,1,B003EQN5UO,"The dialogue is too simplistic.
It lacks technical authenticity.
It is what you would expect to hear from a bunch of kids ad-libbing to the scenes; not what you would expect to hear from warriors in the realm of HALO.
Don't waste your time.
I would like to add that the idea of making a movie from HALO footage is promising; however, this one is not..",1393286400,,351,4.333333333333333
4114472,1,B003EQN5UO,Didn't watch it all the way through; just not my genre of viewing with the cgi stuff and really bad dialogue.,1392854400,,109,4.238095238095238
4114473,5,B003EQN5UO,"Amazing season, great writing and machinimating!! A little different than the previous seasons but awesome nonetheless! Can't wait to finish the series",1391644800,3,151,5.909090909090909
4114474,4,B003EQN5UO,"This has been a great romp, and I don't even play HALO. Some of the characterization and events have been hidden (Tex) and are finally shown.
But there are a lot of non-deaths.

4114475,5,B003EQN5UO,"I've been a big fan of Volumes 1-7 of Red vs. Blue and very much looked forward to watching this volume . . . and I was NOT disappointed! I'm not sure, but I think they greatly improved the action animation with this series, it seemed like during the fight scenes that there was a LOT more unique animation done just for this.  It was definitely not things you would see in the Halo game itself!  And the hilarious dialogue and funny situations that all the characters get into continue as well.  I think this is probably my second favorite volume, following closely the first volume.  Overall, an awesome series and I can't wait to wait to watch Volume 9!!",1391126400,,657,4.45
4114476,3,B003EQN5UO,"I'm no prude, but my 7 year old is the Halo fan, and this is not appropriate for him.  I didn't finish it to find out if it was any good otherwise.",1391040000,,147,3.59375
4114477,5,B003EQN5UO,I've always been a fan of red vs blue and this doesn't disappoint. It's probably really confusing if you haven't seen the others,1390953600,,128,4.608695652173913
4114478,5,B003EQN5UO,I slowly came around to this internet show my kids kept trying to get me to watch and I will say Rooster Teeth has come a long way with this. Now I have to buy season 11. Caboose and Sarge rock!!!,1389744000,,196,3.8048780487804876
4114479,2,B003EQN5UO,the 5 minutes I watched was dialog between video game characters....and really bad dialog.  I guess I was hoping for a story at the least and some action.  It felt like bevis and buthead in Spartan gear...,1389744000,,205,4.513513513513513

4114481,5,B003EQN5UO,Thi season was the best for me in absolute laughs. At one point I had to pause the movie because I was laughing so hard.,1389139200,,120,3.84
4114482,5,B003EQN5UO,Red vs Blue is one of my all time favorite series (and yes this includes network TV).  This 8th season continues the amazing journey like no other adding depth and story to one of the funniest character casts of all time :D,1389139200,,223,4.309523809523809
4114483,1,B003EQN5UO,I HAVE ENJOYED HALO FROM THE BEGINING.  THIS WAS MY FIRST ATTEMPT AT TAKING A LOOK AT THIS SERIES.  I SIMPLY DID NOT LIKE WHAT I SAW.  THE FIRST PART WAS SO SLOW THAT I COULD NOT FINISH IT.,1388966400,,189,3.7948717948717947
4114484,5,B003EQN5UO,This is hilarious! Even better than the series. I think I was supposed to watch Reconstruction prior to this show for the continuity (IS there any continuity in this series???). Reconstruction is not as funny as Revelation.,1388102400,,223,5.054054054054054
4114485,5,B003EQN5UO,"This is a fantastic show, which may be hard to watch for some due to most of the lines being fed through bobbing helmets; but you get past that, it's a hilarious sitcom.",1373760000,,169,4.151515151515151
4114486,5,B003EQN5UO,"What else can I say.  If your a fan, then watch it, love it, laugh.  If you don't like it, then why are you wasting your time reading these reviews?",1373673600,,148,3.9
4114487,4,B003EQN5UO,"Having old school sarge with understanding code and taking orders to the fullest w/ the behaviors of his squad allows a balance that prevents either character from being too overbearing. I know I am not a famous critic or of great importance. However, I do enjoy this work.",1363824000,,273,4.708333333333333

4114489,4,B003EQN5UO,was good but the first 1's were a bit better in terms of comedy but it brings it directly to the 10th season.,1352764800,,109,3.782608695652174
4114490,5,B003EQN5UO,"RVB season 8 is the final season in the recollection trilogy. It is the most action pack of the three, due to the work of the Great Monty Om. His new motion capture adds a whole NEW element to RVB that makes it less like your watching a video game with voice overs to a movie with all new animation. This season is followed by RVB Season 9 (like you couldn't tell just by looking at the numbers)",1352160000,,395,4.076923076923077
4114491,5,B003EQN5UO,"I'm a huge fan of RT, this season did not fail to impress me. I loved being able to watch it on my Kindle Fire instead of by bits and pieces on the RT site. If you haven't already, go watch the earlier seasons and come back to this, I promise you won't be disappointed.",1346198400,,269,3.909090909090909
4114492,5,B003EQN5UO,"I love this whole red vs blue series.  It has tons of great guy-humor and even makes fun of itself.  To my surprise it was actually very well thought out and the story lines converge beautifully at the end.

I very much recommend this and all the other episodes of red vs blue.",1344384000,,277,4.188679245283019
4114493,4,B003EQN5UO,A good conclusion to a story that found itself after season 4. I love this entire series but it started as just something fun and then had to find a point once they realized people liked it and wanted more. The story arc they put in at that point worked well. Season 8 is a little serious for Red vs. Blue but feels right following the story line. Enjoy and bottoms up.,1334707200,,369,4.138888888888889
4114494,5,B003EQN5UO,"This product was purchased for my son, who thoroughly enjoyed it. Therefore, I am happy with the purchase and product. Thank you.",1320192000,,129,4.909090909090909
4114495,4,B003EQN5UO,"In Season 8, we continue the story of ""Reconstruction.""  Some old characters return (including Doc), and we finally discover the fate of Tex.  Just as in the preceding two seasons, the story is more plot-driven, and less an excuse to move the characters from one ridiculous situation to another.  The problem is, the plot still doesn't make much sense.  We could forgive that in the days when this was almost purely a comedy, but when the writers ventured into more dramatic territory, they should have begun filling all those holes in the plot.

The characters are still fun though, and the show is as full of laughs as ever.  In some of these episodes, Sarge really steals the show, and he has some of his best lines and most interesting growth as a character in this season.  Church also has some wonderful moments in the finale, and this was the season that I realized (maybe I should have before) that Church and Caboose really ARE best friends, no matter how much the former denies it.

The biggest change in this season is the CG.  Well I guess it's really ALL computer-generated, but this season they added CG elements that weren't from the game.  Instead of pure machinima, they brought an animator onboard to create fight sequences that could never have been done with the HALO engine.  They are stunning, but they never detract from the rest of the show.  That is, the writers never fall into the trap of just letting the amimation be the star of the show.  They have done it just right.",1304985600,7,1498,4.607547169811321
4114496,5,B003EQN5UO,"Visually: Stunning

Storyline: Addictive
Mood: Mature, but VERY FUNNY
Ending: INTENSE, then surprisingly Zen

SPOILER ALERT: I won't tell you WHAT happens, but I'll tell you how I felt about it. You should be okay if you haven't seen it yet.

All the BADA** people we've met so far have some TERRIFIC opportunities to show us how AWESOME they are, and while I was surprised with the ending, after watching it a couple times I was good with it and I'm definately looking forward to more! Just be ready in the last 10-15 minutes for a crazy adrenaline rush, and then for a quick change of pace. Everything makes sense, but there are some big changes afoot, and at first I wanted to resist change; once I stopped fighting it, it was really quite cool.

8395591,5,B003EQN5UO,I love all of the seasons of Red vs. Blue but this one is my very favorite.
