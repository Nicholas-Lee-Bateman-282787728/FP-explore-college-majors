4329486,5,B004CWLRKY,"This movie is much better than I thought it would be.  I started watching it fully expecting to stop it after 10 or 15 min.  Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised.  This movie is hilarious.  I have never laughed so hard at so many deplorable people in my life.  Granted, the film is more than a little morbid at times but its all in good fun and not meant to be taken seriously.  The acting was superb and everyone was funny, although I particularly enjoyed the actress who portrayed the model Sabrina.  I'm glad I took a chance on this one.",1389139200,2,546,4.294117647058823
4329487,1,B004CWLRKY,I loved the movie from 1999 with Kirstie Allie and Kirsten Dunst.  That one was one of my favorite movies of all time.  It's really hard to find a copy of it which seems really strange because it had an all star cast and was very funny.  This movie is just a bunch of models wasting your time.  It's like watching the bravo channel for 2 hours.  Waste of time.  Where's the real Drop Dead Gorgeous?,1386633600,11,398,4.171052631578948
4329488,1,B004CWLRKY,"A friend wanted me to order a few movies for her so I let her add what she wanted and placed the order for her.
I should have double checked with her that all the movies she added were indeed the movies she wanted.
This was not the ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" she wanted, she wanted the one from the late 90's which I knew but at a quick glance this movie does appear it could be the same just with a new updated cover art.
She was not happy with this purchase and much to my surprise it would have cost more to return the DVD than she actually paid for it, so now she is stuck with a movie she didn't want and to be perfectly honest does not seem like a highly entertaining movie at all.
If you are looking for the Cult movie with Kirsten Dunst do not buy this because its not what you want.",1370822400,,785,3.943396226415094
4329489,2,B004CWLRKY,This was not the movie I thought is was and if I could send it back I would. There is another movie with the same name and that's the one I thought I was ordering.,1360800000,11,163,3.6857142857142855
4329490,1,B004CWLRKY,"This wasn't the ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" I was expecting with Kirstie Alley and crew.  I wasn't even pleasantly surprised. This movie was awful.  I didn't even have the heart to use it as a white elephant gift at Christmas. It's properly filed.  Meant to get the one directed by Michael Patrick Jann",1358640000,,295,4.634615384615385
4329491,1,B004CWLRKY,I didn't even watch it.  I was disappointed that it was not the movie by the same name with Kristen Dunst. :(,1353369600,4,109,3.9545454545454546
4329492,2,B004CWLRKY,"I was quite excited to rent this and did not pay attention to the cover photo's thinking I was renting a film by the same name that was so popular in the late 90's. Was very, very disappointing that it was not, as were my family. Feel it is false advertising and at least some clear, easy to see, disclaimer should be presented.

With that said, later I did sit down and watch the film and it is ""OK"" and can be interesting, just don't be fooled that you're getting the real thing.",1338076800,29,481,4.172043010752688
4329493,5,B004CWLRKY,"This movie isn't exactly Academy Award material, but it was such a hoot to watch!  The lead actress was amazing, she played ""dead"" Incredibly well!  That must have been a terrific challenge, and she really pulled it off, actually I thought she did a better job than the more well-known actors in this movie!  A lot of dark comedy here, no blood or gore, but comedic sympathy for the poor model who doesn't get much respect, not even in death.",1309305600,,442,4.5
4329494,5,B004CWLRKY,"Quirky, fun, and spot-on prospective to the modeling industry. Miss Ivy Levan is superb in the lead role of Cynthia Barris. She is interesting, natural, and talented...looks totally comfortable in front of the camera, while other acting pro's look scripted. Kudos to IVY LEVAN for a great acting first, dead and alive.",1309305600,2,318,5.134615384615385

4329529,1,B004CWLRKY,"Accidentally bought this movie instead of the 1999 movie of the same name. Seriously, I even searched for ""Drop Dead Gorgeous 1999"" and this is the movie that popped up.

Maybe this one is an okay movie, maybe it's not.  I watched about three minutes and turned it off.",1459641600,,269,4.469387755102041

4329552,1,B004CWLRKY,"Giving this movie one star is one too many. Even though I payed 2 dollars for the dvd at a Walgreens, a Reese's would have been a much better spend. This movie is seriously Messed Up! to say the least. I Really Regret Buying this. This movie really puts a nasty stain on the fashion world. In conclusion, don't buy it. Buying it would be like supporting the idiot who thought this film was a good idea. There for destroying the future of movie making.",1417392000,4,451,4.317647058823529

8423717,1,B004CWLRKY,"Wow, this movie is so awful that unfortunately I could not even finish watching it! I do not like posting bad reviews, but I need to tell people not to waste their time. Not one single person in this movie knows how to act and the story line is just terrible. I wish amazon would just remove this movie. There are so many bad reviews!",1515369600,,334,4.153846153846154
8423718,5,B004CWLRKY,"It's a shame that most of the reviews for this movie are 1 star reviews from people who were literally too dumb to know what movie they were watching and too bored to just walk away without writing a negative review.
*UPDATE* I'm gonna cop to being too dumb to understand that many of the people giving one star for this being the wrong movie actually BOUGHT the movie as opposed to watching it for free on Prime like I did. Also, I was too crass to avoid calling people dumb, so mea culpa. You still shouldn't use the review system to fix this common problem with movies of the same name, but I can sympathize. This movie definitely isn't for everyone. However, I stand by my review: for those who appreciate dark satire and indie gems, this deserves five stars so it can stand out from all the indie crap and get the notice it deserves. It's hard enough to make a truly good movie on a budget, let's all think about the creators and niche audiences who are looking for something both different and good.

This is an exceptional example of high-quality, low-budget movie-making, a fast paced, biting satire that's as dark as it gets. The writing, acting, directing, and faux-documentary style are all top notch, with a special nod to singer/songwriter/model Ivy Levan playing totally against character as, mostly, a corpse. As a devastating commentary on the fashion industry, it's far more effective, weird and fun than any of the bland, mainstream, Hollywood ""critiques"" I've seen.",1504224000,,1484,4.72972972972973
8423719,1,B004CWLRKY,This film shares a title with a much better satire of beauty pageants. Don't be fooled. I couldn't even get through this movie. Slow. Boring.,1493424000,2,141,4.68
8423720,5,B004CWLRKY,"I know this movie has and continues to get bad reviews; I feel based on the name' however if you can get past mistaking this movie with the Denise Richards high school beauty queen mockumentary and watch it for the quirky and hilarious comedy it is then hopefully you can enjoy it as much as I did,,,,this movie has been a fav of mine for years,,,but then again my sense of humor is a bit dry,,,,but please, as a viewer know that this movie is dry  is presented in a way that most people don't appreciate or cannot intellectually appreciate,,,,I will never not have this movie in my watchlist,,,",1482796800,,595,4.458715596330276

Edit. I thought  this was the one with Kirstie Ally and was so excited when I saw that I could watch it on prime video for free. I have the vhs and hadn't seen it in a long time. Sad.",1481155200,,264,3.6315789473684212
