7941167,3,B00005JOAD,"This is less about Alice, the prepubescent girl who enters the story one-third of the way through, than it is about Philip, a German journalist travelling from city to city taking Polaroid pictures. Philip's a pretty ordinary fellow, not being particularly interesting or dull, just curious and awkward. The film opens slowly and finally gets going when Philip meets a mother and daughter (Alice) at a US airport. All three are in the process of purchasing plane tickets when an airline clerk tells them all flights to Germany have been cancelled due to security reasons. With the excuse that she must immediately return to her partner (who has suffered a breakdown), the mother temporarily leaves her daughter, Alice, under the care of Philip. Shortly afterwards, Philip and Alice fly to Amsterdam to search for her grandparents. During their journey, much like any other father-daughter relationship, they can't help but get on each other's nerves.

For a slow-paced film of 1 hour 50, it feels 15 minutes longer than it should be. It's much like Wenders' feature debut Summer In the City, but has more to offer the viewer in terms of interesting characters and story progression. This modest production may appeal much more to film students than the average indie viewer. It may hold your attention, but falls short of having the fully absorbing quality of Wenders' later films (ie. Paris, Texas and Wings of Desire).",1489017600,,1420,5.016949152542373

7941170,4,B00005JOAD,"Slow-paced odyssey starting in the U.S. and continuing in Holland and Germany. A somewhat alienated journalist ends up traveling with a young girl whose mother has temporarily abandoned her. The psychological interplay between the journalist and the child is interesting and sometimes tense, as they search in vain for the girl's grandparents. Worth seeing, though I liked some of Wender's other films better.",1476230400,,409,5.507936507936508

7941172,5,B00005JOAD,"Depicts increasing commercialization of society, loss of value of images brought about by consumerism and its ally, advertising, seen at its worst in American tv and society, in the background of loneliness and lack of ideals and loss of identity of modern man. Care for others and the purity of children come forth as redeeming values in the desolate landscape of an alienated world. Lisbon story - done 20 years later, in 1994, makes a nice match/segue to this movie, focusing on similar themes.",1472256000,2,497,4.928571428571429

7941174,5,B00005JOAD,"I was so fortunate that this film was playing in Koln, in a little art theatre over the museum, while I was in the city.  Wenders' latest film Don't Come Knockin' was also playing downtown so it was a great opportunity to see old and new films of his, both truly great.  I enjoyed this sweet story of the relationship between a lost child and the even more lost adult who comes to be her guardian, even though I don't understand a lick of German.  Help this film come to DVD by signing up to recieve an alert if it's released, it deserves to be seen by the world.",1162425600,8,563,4.146788990825688
7941175,5,B00005JOAD,"The script cannot be more linear. A precocious 9 year child is abandoned by her mother and the thread of destiny will make her to intersect with a German journalist. A road movie which still has too much to say.

A fascinating road movie by paradisiacal places.",1139961600,9,261,4.553191489361702
7941176,4,B00005JOAD,"A seminal road movie classic from 1974. It's a critique of mindless noise that is (North) America and of its becoming a nefarious cultural, moral, spiritual and intellectual wasteland. And how much scarier, uglier and more horrifying the monster looks today!

Wenders follows this with another brilliant road flick, ""Im Lauf Der Zeit"" (1976). Generally, it seems that the seventies were a decade of brilliant road flicks starting with Bob Rafaelson's ""Five Easy Pieces"" (1970) and ending up with Tanner's immense ""Messidor""(1979).

For those familiar with Wenders best films from the seventies, much of his later opus seems very pale in comparison.",1131235200,8,648,5.3431372549019605
