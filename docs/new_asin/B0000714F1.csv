1800194,3,B0000714F1,"I have recently purchased 3 DVD's which are:  Mahalia Jackson:  The Power & The Glory, Mahalia Jackson-You'll Never Walk Alone, & The Immortal Mahalia Jackson which shair the same footage as applicable to Disc 2 on this DVD.  Ms. Jackson is on the same dreary stage in the same studio standing sedately under arches or beside a replica of a stained glass window or sitting on a park bench wearing for the most part a choir robe.  All are in black & white.
While Disc 2 has many more songs than the previuosly mentioned DVD's, the sound is of the poorest quality in that there is a crackling noise on most of the songs being played (Disc 2).  The songs are for the most part of the same tempo & boring.  Ms. Jackson just stands there looking somber with no joy.
Now I absolutely loved Disc 1.  I loved seeing segments of Ms. Jackson in color joyfully performing with a smile on her face, clapping, & obviously enjoying herself as she performed for an adoring audience while singing upbeat songs with a fast tempo.  This could well have been one of the greatest DVD's ever if they would have given complete performances. Disc 1 shows what she was really like as a performer.  I enjoyed the documentary depicting her rise to fame up until she became ill & went into a physical & mental decline.  The end showing her personality change after her heart attacks & the way she acted (deva like) after her final performances was shameful & may well have robbed her of her dignity.  In all fairness, she was severely ill & in pain & had no other solace other than performing.  It left me with a bad taste in my mouth, but it is what it is.  She left us with a wonderful legacy of music which is still being played on the radio & in homes some 38 years after her death.",1270857600,2,1759,4.342507645259939
1800195,5,B0000714F1,"I had this already, but I share one, but if you get the trill of real Gospel, then Mahalia will trill and chill your soul. Although she's been gone awhile, I don't miss her too much do this having this. You can learn as well as take the journey with her.",1187827200,,254,4.0
1800196,5,B0000714F1,"These two dvds were excellently produced.  The first one about Mahalia's life was informative and interesting.  The second one was entertaining, although to me a little lengthy but worth every penny spent toward this dvd collection.  It's great to see via dvd such a wonderful person with an inspiring distinctive voice preserved for many years for generations to enjoy and be spiritually motivated.",1178409600,,399,5.301587301587301
1800197,5,B0000714F1,"Here are both, a newmade documentary abou Mahalia Jackson and on a 2nd dvd 37 songs of her vintage collection of the XENON-video volumes 1-4 in digital quality. Before you get the other DVDs on Mahalia you should prefer this one for its expansion and quality. Most of the othe until now available DVDs are repacked DVDs. Highly recommended!!!",1161216000,3,342,4.813559322033898
1800198,4,B0000714F1,"I have read everything in print, I believe, about Mahalia Jackson.  I have researched her life diligently for more than 35 years.  This film does a good job of recreating from archival footage the basic substance of her life and work.  While some things are not fully accurate, the film does depict the chronological events in her life quite well.  For example, the Carnegie 1950 performance was not actually filmed or shown here.  The later 1961 image from CBS was used to approximate the actual event.  I do not fault any of this, as the film does justice to Mahalia's fabulous career in many ways, thus providing at least some form of historical narrative for future generations.  I sincerely hope that an intensive and thorough work is currently in the making.  Mahalia made TV appearances as late as 1971 (Flip Wilson).  She sang at M.L. King's funeral, yet in this documentary that actual performance was not used.  I personally watched her April 1968 televised performance of ""Precious Lord"" at his funeral.  All major networks televised the event, so this performance should have been used.  Mahalia was on TV in the 50's and 60's frequently.  I believe that in essence this particular film does capture the life and work of Miss Jackson fairly accurately and well.  I am grateful to its producers for the effort and research and the images of the great Mahalia.  I did enjoy this film and in the end I felt that long familiar pang. . .I surely do miss her.",1134518400,22,1465,4.71259842519685
1800199,2,B0000714F1,"It is not the rather lame documentary that makes this item worthwhile but the bonus disc. It contains 2 hours with 38 live video clips recorded in black and white for American television in the late fifties. The performances are set against a sober kind of German expressionistic background. Most of the time the accompanying musicians (piano -must be Mildred Falls-, acoustic bass, electric guitar, drums and organ) are not in the picture. Without an audience the performances are rather serene but they are of high musical quality. Though some songs are more uplifting than others Jackson and the other musicians are in great form. They are randomly taken from the 80 video clip collection 'Mahalia Jackson sings' which lasts for 4 hours.
In regard of the documentary: it is apparent that there is not that much video footage left of Mahalia Jackson, except from the above mentioned footage. There is something to be said for the interview recordings used but for a visual documentary it is a pity that only two excerpts, lasting only seconds, are accompanied by moving pictures of Mahalia Jackson. This is the great omission of the film. To cover up for this problem a lot of irrelevant archive footage is used and the camera zooms in or out on tens of still photographs. Then there are a lot of chit chatting talking heads from people who where more or less close to her and on top of it all there's the annoying voiceover. Most troubling is that their voices are mixed through the soundtrack of the few interesting concert snippets, which are not fully shown in the first place. Most of the scarce concert footage is from one of her later and less impressive concert tours where her voice, music (without pianist Mildred Falls) and performance have lost power. This footage is earlier and to a greater extend used for Allen Miner's, mostly depressing, 86-minute tour report (released in 1974). On a slightly positive note: added up there are a few minutes of unique video material from earlier performances. The one-minute recording of 'How I got over' from the march on Washington is very impressive; she performs the song at the same lectern where Dr. M.L. King gives his famous speech. Unfortunately this recording is also interrupted by speech and visuals.
I have not much trust in hoping for a thorough documentary film on Mahalia Jackson's life and music. I do hope for complete video releases of the concerts, which are so barely touched upon in this documentary. For example nothing beats the overwhelming recording of a part of her concert at the Newport Jazz festival 1958, which was used for the impressive music documentary 'Jazz on a summer's day' (Bert Stern, USA 1960). And then there are the unpublished television specials she made for CBS in 1955 (not the same as the 'Mahalia Jackson sings' recordings), a bit of interesting audio material is used for this documentary.",1067126400,50,2893,4.870182555780933
1800200,5,B0000714F1,"This 2-DVD set is a treasure if you care about Jazz, Blues, Gospel, the Civil Rights movement or the roots of Rock music.  If you're a Mahalia fan it's an absolute ""must have.""
The first disc is a montage of photos, film clips and recent interviews with people who knew and worked with Mahalia, interspersed with brief clips of her actual performances and interviews with her.  The second disc is composed entirely of her performances.  The approximately 40 songs she performs on the second disc appear to all be from one or two recording sessions on a set.  Apparently without a live audience for the most part, and restrained for the occasion, her performances aren't as animated as many of the clips in the first disc, but it's still an amazing experience to watch.
This set meant that, after 35 years of hearing, at last my eyes could see the life and the joy and the laughter and the tears with which Mahalia Jackson embodied Gospel and the gospel.
Watch, listen and ""move on up a little higher.""",1049241600,13,1001,4.606741573033708
1800201,5,B0000714F1,"I grew up listening to and admiring the voice of Mahalia Jackson. I began to collect her precious recordings, When I first saw this documentary, I declared, ""I must have this in my collection"". This set is priceless because accompanied with the cd of a great documentary of a legendary Gospel Singer that painstakingly narrates her life, there are 39 rare vintage performances of Mahalia at her ""Zenith"" Listening to her actually perform truly memorable songs such as ""when the saints come marching in"" ""Guide me oh Great Jehova!"" and other truly memorable songs bring you to tears. The Great Mahalia has a voice that will lift you to great heights and when you finish listening to her, you feel as if you were on a mountain and witnessed a breathtaking view and you do not want to ever leave that mountaintop! Mahalia is very engaging as you see her sincere  Facial expressions and her ability to thrust her whole being in her song. One is left with the impression that she lived those songs, for they were sung with her heart. This set is a must for all Gospel and Jazz enthusiasts in the world. Teens and adults, get this so that you can recognize why there will never be another Mahalia Jackson!
All the Best!
