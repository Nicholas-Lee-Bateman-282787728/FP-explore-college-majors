933546,5,6304819781,"I just rented this movie the other day to watch in my dorm lounge and it damn near killed me. :)  What a beautiful world!  I live in and love southern california which this film, despite production values, reeks of.  Plus, it's got graphic sex, violence, crime, machismo, chase scenes and a  happy ending . . . everything silly and seedy (yet fun!) that queers get  left out of in straight films.  Plus, it's a welcome relief from the sappy,  shallow, straight-pandering gay films (read: Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss)  that make it mainstream.  And, unlike mainstream gay films (read: Billy's  Hollywood Screen Kiss), it's got black people! (and ones that myself as a  black queer absolutely *loved*.  Bless you dr. davis! I *love* that scene:  ""that was not a rape.  merely an exercise in black power."")
  Though the movie is better served with LaBruce's autobiography The  Reluctant Pornographer, which shows this particular work of art to be the  result of something greater.  Plus, it helps to understand his blend of  sincerity and camp that's evident in the film.  :)  I came here to buy it!",951696000,56,1098,4.821621621621621

If you are looking for high art then you don't want to see this movie, if you are looking for  somehting with a message again this isn't the movie for you. But if you are  into camp and weirdness for camp and weirdness sake then this is just the  right film for you. It has a few laughs and you might enjoy the reffernces  taken from better films. Again this isn't a movie for all tastes. This  movie contains graphic sex and language, not for the faint of heart.",936921600,23,588,4.12280701754386
933549,1,6304819781,"I wouldn't give this film even one star if that was an option - which it is not.  I view a lot of independent films, and so called experimental films, and in so doing come across some pretty tawdry ones.  But this  clunker takes the cake.  After spending many years in the area this  ""director"" chose for his locale, and having led a very extremely  liberal existence while there, I am a pretty hardened viewer of films and  reader of books.  This film was, as I mentioned earlier, a complete waste  of my time.  Mr. Diretor needs to get a focus on what he is trying to  convey to his captive audience - the majority of scenes were not just  shocking, but completely disgusting and added not substance or value to  this film at all.  There are a number of very good ""gay"" films  out there - don't waste your time encouraging this guy.",923616000,3,834,4.324675324675325
7878146,2,6304819781,"up until all the excessive body fluids in every other scene. the rape scene, but the amputee thing was too much! I am no prude by any mean, this is a gay themed movie, I'm gay, I have seen Bruce La Bruce's films before. I'm actually a pretty big fan of a few of his work. My fav being ""No Skin off my ass"" & ""OTTO, Up with Dead People"". The lead actor who played Monty (Tony Ward) & Bruce La Bruce, both saved this and were very charming as the unlikely couple, sorta like the gay equalvilant to pretty woman as far as the ending. However, the nazi killer, rapes, sadist theme, it ruined what j truly did like, and i had wanted to see it for years, but my old video place never had it. now i saw it, its on anew layer of terrible films i regret even finishing",1505174400,,759,4.0

To shock people? Well, maybe if it was made in the 60's or 70's...Then the job would be done, but nowadays?
Half of this venture could serve as a porn movie. Sex with SM - ticked! Sex with old ugly men - ticked! Sex with a drag-queen - ticked! Sex with an amputee...ticked! And some more. More or less all of them are testeless. Acted really badly.
If the director wished to show the world of hustlers, he failed there too. Tony Ward as a single-dad-hustler? Ha ha ha. This 2 minute episode must serve the viewer as a sort of explanation and justification(?) of his deeds. Weak.
I would lie if I said I expected a masterpiece when I started to watch it. Bur even then, I ended up being disappointed and puzzled, trying to understand the people who made this amatourish film.",1338940800,,793,4.401360544217687
7878148,4,6304819781,"Inspired by Billy Wilder`s classic Sunset Boulevard, Hustler White explores the sordid lives of various characters throughout the threshold of Santa Monica Blvd. While I can certainly appreciate the homage to classic Hollywood cinema, I am actually glad that LaBruce decided to take a completely different direction in this controversial low-budget flick.

One may be more reminded of early John Waters or Paul Morrissey films with all the shady going-ons, quirkiness & explicit montages. Viewers who are easily offended or gravitate towards the mainstream cinema should steer clear of Hustler White for a number of reasons. Be for warned: HW reeks of post-modern sleaze as it delves into the seedy underground of male hustling, johns, & pornography. There are several VERY graphic scenes of illicit activity which feature full-frontal nudity, a amputee sex scene, & a gang rape.  Sadly, not the typical film you would introduce to your fellow Sunday school members nor likely the flick to play for dear old mom or dad but an interesting work indeed.

The film opens up with Monty Ward narrating the story as he appears to be laying face down in someones jacuzzi. He gives his word of honor (if you're buying into his story at all)  that his confessions are the truth, the whole truth, & nothing up your butt. Naturally, we are lead to believe the two-bit hustler is already dead which sets the stage for the next 80 odd minutes of human depravity in it's most campy yet utterly raw form.  You should be full aware that all bets are off & you're in for one hell of a ride. Contrary to what one a reviewer suggested on the liner notes of  the DVD, this is NOT a light-hearted romantic comedy to place beside the Julia Roberts vehicle.

Monty Ward AKA Montgomery Ward is a street smart hustler who obviously has been around the block a few times & could tell you just about anything regarding the sleazy world of hustling if offered the right amount of money.  But make no mistake, Ward is certainly no angel by any means & doesn't exactly have a heart of gold. Within the first few minutes of HW, he steals a john's wallet & then proceeds to make quick getaway by stealing the man's vehicle. While obviously in a hurry & needing to make a quick dash, he then proceeds to run over another hustler's leg by accident. In this hilarious montage, he drives over the poor guy's leg numerous times before managing to evacuate the parking lot.

Jurgen Anger (no relation to Kenneth Anger) has just arrived on the scene & immediately sets his eyes on Montgomery after seeing him shirtless on Santa Monica Blvd . Anger is a self-absorbed writer who has made the journey to Cali in hopes of writing a novel on the life of hustlers. After spotting Monty, he desperately tries to scope the boulevard in hopes of returning a bloodied t-shirt found tied to a fence & discussing the possibilities of purchasing Monty's services for one afternoon of complete research. As one can easily predict from the beginning, Jurgen is totally infatuated with the hustler & will stop at nothing until their paths cross.

As luck or fate might have it, the two eventually meet & Monty agrees to help Anger after being offered a lump sum of $1000 for his wealth of knowledge. It would seem that fate has smiled upon the two & things should run fairly smoothly from here. Right? So how did Monty end up face down in the jacuzzi after all? I'm not telling.

Perhaps more than just about any film I've experienced up until, HW is one of the more bizarre if not insanely funny trips. If you're not somehow offended after viewing, there may not be much help for you at all. On the other hand, have at it if you're in the mood for really deviant post-modern sleaze which carefully examines the hedonistic lifestyle that some live on a day-to-day basis.

A few bizarre (or fun) montages: A street hustler's services are purchased by a local mortician. The mortician proceeds to dress in drag while mummifying our hustler completely with duck tape. Another young hustler arrives on the scene of an all-black male escort service for an interview & is raped by nine endowed black males within 30 minutes.  The leader of the organization proceeds to tell the young man, ""that was not a rape. merely an exercise in black power."" Perhaps the razor blade scene with the ""Versace Model""  made me cringe the most however.

Again, this is NOT a film for all tastes. Having said that, do yourself a huge favor & look for something else if you're seeking the next Oscar caliber film. Cheers!",1309219200,,4541,4.672932330827067
7878149,5,6304819781,"This viewer, long immersed in alternative films (and by that use of this label, not referring only to purely porno cinema that too often usurps this rubric), finds so many of the other Amazon users' comments about ""Hustler White"" truly beside the point. Bruce LaBruce's aesthetic in his films always is high in originality, deeply confrontational to the values of the film industry and to society at large. One either loves it or hates it. This viewer thrives on such films! While not so completely satisfying a work as his ""Raspberry Reich"", Bruce LaBruce's ""Hustler White"" is a masterwork of its kind.

What perplexes is how the humanity of LaBruce's films seems so under-appreciated. In ""Hustler White"", for example, the utter passivity of the young gay hustler who gives himself over to the increasingly obvious murderous intentions of the kinky undertaker, is disturbing; how can any young man have so little concern about maintaining his existence, to live so much in the present, accepting whatever it brings him, that he lets himself, so uncaringly indifferent to his fate, so lacking in any emotions whatever, to approach closer and closer to the ultimate suffocation that kills him? This is existential despair depicted at its most heartbreaking!

Another example is near the very end of the film when the hardened academic, so immune to others' feelings, so pseudo-intellectually presumptuous, so uncaringly arrogant until this point, is on the beach with the body of the beautiful male hustler for whom he has longed (and who for perhaps the first time has awakened love in all of its vulnerability in the scholar) and whom he thinks to be dead (from an accident much earlier in the film). When the lad awakens, the sheer joy of finding his idealised lover to be alive, and the latter's realisation that, for once, a stalker and client truly loves him, leads to a sort of tender dance of acrobatic turns that express genuine joy in, and recognition of, love reciprocated. This scene alone would make this film an essential for anyone who cherishes art that expresses a gay sensibility! The fact that immediately after this a closing scene of utterly perverse, degrading urination-as-sexual-kick follows (which has nothing to do with the hustler and the man who has sought him) makes the impact of what has preceded all the more forceful!

Bruce LaBruce does have an utterly aberrent way of portraying men and human love, lust, and sexuality, in this movie and in others, but his films do stir the viewer to ponder these and other ""ultimate concerns"", to which his art gives rise, while so paradoxically conveyed with the most sublime, cheekily mischievous playfulness. Bruce LaBruce is far from being some kind of shallow votary of decadence, for all the mordant and weird humour (grim and/or ludicrous) which make his films so enjoyable to experience. What seems to be in his films for mere shock effect, as many viewers experience it, surely Bruce LaBruce intends as a wake-up-call, sexual and otherwise, to examine the human condition anew, physically and in every other way, whether one is a committed and reflective Christian or supposedly hostile to any spirituality, orthodox or otherwise. Just in doing so accounts for the revolutionary label that LaBruce and his commentators so frequently affirm and recognise. As in all ""alternative"" film, the lack of glossy, high-cost production values simply is irrelevant in assessing the worth of LaBruce's strange and hauntingly evocative productions.",1224115200,3,3513,5.084922010398613

He is the only reason for watching this film.  Other than that the film is not worth anything, unless you are really into all that street Hustling of Hollywood.  I warn you that this film is not very good.  Direction is bad, picture isn't that good, low budget, mediocre plot, and Extremely explicit sexual scenes are characteristics of this film.  The only saving grace of the film is the hunkster Tony Ward.  If you want Tony, then this is a good film to see all of him.  Otherwise, discard the rest of the film.
