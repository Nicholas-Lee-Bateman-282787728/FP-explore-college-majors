5826938,2,B00DL47QDG,"In 1987, 43,000 acres burned in Texas, four people died and extensive clearing and repair were needed. This entry to the 2013 Seattle International Film Festival from the USA is a remake of "" annan veg"" (""Either Way"") from Iceland. We follow two men who are charged with the task of painting the lines in the newly repaired road in a remote part of Texas, mile after boring mile.

We see:
  * Paul Rudd (""Admission"") is the boss. He is in charge of each day's tasks; he oversees the camp site, the tent, the cooking and the general well-being of his charge. He loves the isolation because he can study German, read, and improve himself.
  * Emile Hirsch (""Killer Joe"") is the underling. He has been given this job because the boss is engaged to his sister. His family hopes this might help him grow up. He just wants to get to town so he can meet girls!
  * Lance LeGault (""Stuntmen"") is a trucker who comes by their job site a time or two. He always seems to have some spare moonshine that he is willing to share.

This is mostly two men talking, and talking, and arguing, and talking. I really didn't admire either one of them.... Get the DVD when it's available from Amazon and see what you think.",1372982400,4,1200,4.373873873873874

5827048,4,B00DL47QDG,"This is an unusual kind of movie. Don't expect a lot of action, prepare for a kind of slow, but thoughtful stuff. In my opinion, this is a movie where a man meditates on his relationship with women. You experience this world through the eyes of a man in 3 different stages in life: young, mature, old. The movie is full of subtle philosophy, which you'll probably enjoy to decipher. I don't think I get it all, but some guys on IMDB have suggested a few interesting ideas, like the prince is a kind of blend of two leading characters, because Avalanche is the blend of their two names. This is a very male-centered movie, and it's interesting for us women to glance into a male psyche. And I also must add, since I bought this movie because I'm a fan of Emile Hirsh, that he is spectacular in it, like always. He plays a kind of dumb young man, and I couldn't believe my eyes - I didn't recognize in this slow guy Emile at all. How do you play dumb is you're not making idiotic faces? Amazing.",1404345600,3,993,4.2592592592592595
5827049,5,B00DL47QDG,"Prince Avalanche is one of those rare ""small"" movies that demands your attention through fine acting, superb cinematography, a distinctive score, and an organic plot that seems to unfold one scene at a time.

Filmed in and around Bastrop, Tx., after the great fire of 2011, the film is a haunting yet realistic reflection of the growing bond between two immature yet grounded young men performing boring, brainless menial labor.  The script allows both characters to breathe and grow as the film progresses, questioning their lot in life, their sense of direction, and even their own values.  They are both endearingly, believably naive and this lends a wonderful charm to their story.

At times slowly paced and a tad bit arty, director Green nevertheless imbues Prince Avalanche with a spontaneous feel- not necessarily in the plotting as much as the dialog.  Paul Rudd and Emile Hirsch are in top form here, understated and reflective, and innocently goofy when necessary.

One personal note- I am extremely familiar with Bastrop, Tx. and the state park wherein much of the principal filming took place.  The fire ravaged property and land, and left it scarred for decades.  But it's a resilient land, and this little film did it proud. An amazing backdrop for a wonderful movie.",1402185600,3,1282,5.014150943396227

I don't remember Hirsch in much, but I love his Jack Black/Leo DiCaprio  mixture appeal.  I always like Rudd.  It is an honest down to earth movie that actually lets men feel, unlike most parts of our society, that try to deny men's humanity.  Every time I saw them walking in their bib overalls, I thought of the Mario brothers. (especially with Rudd's mustache :)

Even though much of the movie has a serious tone,  there are small moments of humor that just made me laugh out loud dispersed throughout.  There are moments of silence (no music) mixed with moments of music.  I really think the soundtrack can make or break a movie, and this one certainly made the movie.",1394323200,2,841,4.563758389261745
5827084,3,B00DL47QDG,"This is an American indie film from film maker David Gordon Green. His chequered career has seen him bring us `Pineapple Express, `Your Highness' and the rather good `Undertow'; in this film he has taken inspiration from an original story by Icelander  Hafsteinn Gunnar Sigurosson. He has relocated that to the fire ravaged forests of Texas in 1988. We meet the two main protagonists in Alvin (Paul Rudd - `Role Models and `I Love you man') he is working out his demons by working on the road painting service. His only companion is the brother of his girlfriend Lance, Emile Hirsch (`Into the wild' and `Milk'). He considers Lance to be a loser.

Now very little actually happens, they paint the road, erect some signs , meet an aged truck driver and an elderly woman who is searching her burnt out home to salvage memories . This lady was really doing that and was asked if her story could be put into the film - which is a nice touch. The idea was that this would be an absurdist, minimalist tale where the two main characters would slowly reveal their real characters - both strengths and weaknesses by just being together or alone with their own thoughts, and some alcohol and heart ache.

So does it work? Well a lot of people seem to think so with a 6.4 rating on IMDB this is certainly no turkey. It is also supposed to be a 'hilarious' comedy; well I felt amused a couple of times but this is not even in the foothills of being funny. The characterisation is good and some of the absurd themes sort of work, but overall I felt under whelmed by this film. It is only 90 minutes long and the scenery is often beautiful. The score is from `Explosions in the Sky' and `Loosley Tight' and that also really works, I would give 6 out of ten which roughly equates with 3 stars. That is not meant to be harsh but to ignore the areas where this does not work would, I feel, be disingenuous. Still if you like absurdist, minimalism then this could be one you will want to see.",1392854400,5,1974,4.387978142076503
5827085,3,B00DL47QDG,"This small, low-budget indi-film by David Gordon Green (""Pineapple Express"") is loosely based on an Icelandic film from 2011 called ""Either Way.""  Set in central Texas in 1988 after a devastating wildfire had destroyed acres of woodlands and homes.  (Note: The movie was actually shot in the Bastrop State Park, southeast of Austin which suffered a huge fire in 2011).  Alvin (Paul Rudd), who lives in the Dallas area with his girlfriend is a road worker of the state and has been assigned to paint new lines and install signs on a remote highway.  His subordinate is Lance (Emile Hirsch), the brother of his girlfriend.  Lance has no experience at much of anything but was given the job because of his sister's relationship.

The pair have little in common but make the best of their isolated time together.  Because of the distance involved to the nearest city, Alvin and Lance spend the nights in the burned out forest until the weekend.  Even then Alvin decides to go it alone to get his thoughts together about his life and possible marriage.  That's pretty much it.  This is a simple film about two guys sharing their less than perfect lives with each other.  There are conflicts about girls, marriage, kids, music, and sex.  There are some funny moments as well as more serious ones.

In one of the better scenes, Alvin is wandering about when he comes across an elderly woman (Joyce Payne) poking through the ashes of what was once her home.  The movie changes gears here a bit and becomes a mini documentary as the woman tells Alvin where the furniture once was and how she is searching for her pilot's license amongst the ash.  The fact that this is not an actress, makes the scene even more poignant.  Perhaps it should have lasted longer or perhaps there should have been more scenes like this.  I think Green missed the boat.

Lance LeGault does give the film a bit of energy when his truck driver character shows up out of nowhere to ply the boys with liquor.  Otherwise the film drags much of the time.  There just isn't much there there to coin a phrase.  On the plus side, Hirsch and Rudd do a fine job with the script, lean as it is.  I suspect there was some improvisation.  The film also features a nice soundtrack by Explosions in the Sky.

The Blu ray transfer has the usual 1080p video resolution and retains the film's 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Shot with digital cameras, the movie looks great.  Excellent colors, deep blacks and natural skin tones never waiver.  Some fine camera work features snippets of flowers emerging from the burned out landscape.  Colors of yellow and red seem most prominent.  The disc features a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and it very good recognizing that this is a dialog heavy film, lacking in natural surround sound opportunities.  We do get some birds and chickens flapping about.  The rest is properly focused up front and is very clear.  Here are the extras:  Commentary with Green and other production assistants, a deleted scene, Paul & Emile (character development), From the Ashes featurette, Lance LeGault remembered, interviews with Rudd, Hirsch and Green, a trailer and AXS TV promo.",1392076800,,3147,4.736648250460405

5827087,4,B00DL47QDG,"Ive had a crush on Paul Rudd for a few years.  Im ok with this.  Im comfortable enough in my manhood/marriage to admit that (Ive admitted a lot worse, so).  Ill watch him in anything, but even I am aware that his film choices can be questionable.  He seems to like to regurgitate the same character and the same scenarios a lot, and while hes very good at it, Ive be anxious for him to stretch himself a bit and do something really great.  On the flipside, I kind of hate Emile Hirsch.  I find his breed of acting to be annoying and false and while he has tried to stretch himself and has chosen some really quality works in the past, I often go out of my way to avoid his films if I can.

I was faced with a conundrum here.

Prince Avalanche brings both actors (who couldn't be more different) together with director David Gordon Green (who directed the Malick-esque George Washington and thenPineapple Express?) in a film about isolation, loneliness and self-discovery.  Some will balk that this film doesnt go anywhere or doesnt say anything or is devoid of real story or plot and yet to those I say dig deeper and look closer and you will see, because it is all there.

The film takes place in 1988 where a highway road worker named Alvin is spending the summer painting yellow stripes along the highway with his girlfriends younger brother, Lance.  Alvin enjoys the solitude; the camping out in the woods and being away from life in general, for it allows him the opportunity to reflect on his life.  Lance hates it.  He needs people and longs for some intimate interaction with women, but Alvin is fine with the distance, even if it means that he isn't around to meet the needs of his girlfriend, who is growing restless with his absence.  When Lance returns from a weekend in town, he brings information that alters Alvins life course, changing the way he looks at himself but also the way he projects his entire life.

What is he going to do now?

While Ill admit that the story itself may seem slight, there is a deeper impact here that I wasn't expecting, and sometimes it is in the simplest of plot details that the most direct emotional response can be found.  Alvins life is so micromanaged and his idea of what he wants and what others need is misguided at the very least and obviously built around a cushion to keep him protected and in control.  Lance breaks that down because he lives in a far less arranged world, a world that is colored outside of the lines and one that consists of reckless behavior and a striving after the wind.  Lances world is created on inexperience, while Alvins dwells in a world almost too experienced; one of subliminal fear.  They need to strike a balance, an amalgam of their particular views, and when that happens they can find enrichment they never thought possible.

But first they need to collide.

Rudd and Hirsch are both excellent here.  Hirschs ticks as an actor (the way he creates obnoxiousness has always irritated me) is best suited here where he is given a character who is about as nave as they come.  His expressions betray his faux sense of confidence and help bolster a performance that feels rich with underlying meaning.  Rudd handles Alvins backstory with ease, giving his gruffness a sense of underlying pain that helps underline the progressive nature of his character.  He also handles the humor, dry and awkward, with his undeniable charm.  I really, really NEED Paul Rudd to work with Wes Anderson.  He would fit so brilliantly into that world, and he needs to build a sharper career.  Hopefully this is only the beginning for him, although next year hes working with David Wain again so maybe not.

Yes, this doesnt have a lot going on, but it is also brisk, and when you look at the details (that scene in the destroyed home for one) you can find something that sings with life and has a real sense of character development.",1389312000,2,3900,4.545845272206304

5827111,5,B00DL47QDG,"after departing from the minimalist quirky drama side of film with 2008's ""pineapple express"" and the 2 not so great that followed ""your highness"" and ""the sitter', david is appreciatively back in form with ""prince avalanche"". similar to the innocence and cinematography beauty of George Washington and with the buddy humor of the likes of Pineapple Express, prince avalanche should appeal to anyone of DGG's previous work. it's truly a sad thing to see all these premature, negative reviews for a gem of a movie like this. I assume people were looking for obvious, loud humor and a cohesive conventional plot but were disappointed to find a movie with 2 main characters, who we know very little about except that they are different human beings and that they are painting lines on roads that surround a devastated forest and community in texas that was recently destroyed by a fire.  we have no clue what these 2 do back in the city when their not working, we only get a glimpse of who they are but as the film goes on we start to see subtle characteristics and personality rise to the surface and we see these two guys for who they really are or who they strive to be. the movie is an unraveling of emotions and character and possibly a start of an impossible, blooming friendship between 2 polar opposites.

anybody who has seen and liked david Gordon greens previous work before pineapple express, will not be surprised or bored with this movie. the man has a unique style of storytelling through film that uses subtle shots of nature and unconventional characters to bring forth organic human expression. and like his first 4 films, prince avalanche is no different. maybe a lot of the negative reviews are people looking for another pineapple express stoner comedy like film or just from seeing the great comedic actor paul rudd on the cover or trailer. this is not another paul rudd comedy, although paul rudd's comedic genius is seen throughout beneath that 80's moustache and clothes in the self-assured but flawed Alvin character, only in a more subtle way. also, emile hersch's character ""lance"" is very likeable and relatable and reminds me a bit like james franco laidback, clueless character in pineapple express. I think paul rudd's acting in this one is deserving of an award or at least an nomination. his reserved comedic presence along with drips of dramatic acting really shine here.

this is the kind of movie that is only going to hit a niche spot for movie seekers who ask more out of their movies than just cheap laughs and conventional plots and pacing. this is a special kind of movie for special film viewers and that's ok. why else would david Gordon green make such a minimalistic, spontaneous buddy dramedy in a desolate burnt forest in the middle of texas with only 4 total characters/actors in the entire movie? I think he made this more for himself than anything just to get back to what he enjoys about making movies and to not be restricted by big budget or marketers trying to make his film be something else.

as goes the saying, ""we all go back to where we belong"" or ""we all always return to our roots"". .and this is exactly the case with ""prince avalanche"". this is david making movies the way HE likes making movies and it is clear that this is the man's unique ""talent/gift"" on this planet.

They are in the middle of nowhere and are painting a road. Their relationship is quite similar to a modern day Laurel & Hardy.  The film takes a predictable but interesting twist when the more sophisticated of the two is dumped by his girlfriend.

I don't think Prince Avalanche sold itself well. Audiences these days are much too smart to just admit that self deprecating is cool. It didn't have any redeeming humour to work with. While it does try to be a real portrayal of lives, it ends up making the real look too mundane, too sad and nothing worth writing him about.

If the intention of the director was any different than celibate mediocrity, he didn't display that intention too well.

From  an excellent comedy such as The sitter(that reminded me of the Landis' great shots) he moves to Prince Avalanche that is a return to minimalism, a movie with two men in the middle of nowhere who are living, for the time being, in the margin of the world as we know it and are at the same time influenced by all the things they have chosen to leave behind for a while-and keep coming in one way or another-and by their present together with all the repercussions of their difficult relationship and, finally, friendship. Like Roman Polanski's Cul-de-sac or like Waiting for Godot or even like the best of Wender's movies, the film is built almost from nothing (and that is part of its greatness).However, as things unfold, we witness deeper feelings coming out; and before the movie ends we taste the sweet yearning for  all the things that get lost in the way, Then we understand we've been watching an elegy in understatement.

During the summer they experience the high and lows of love and begin to bond over the ups and downs of life. First of all even though Paul Rudd is in this I would not call this a comedy. I really liked this but do not go in expecting to laugh. One other disclaimer is that this isn't a movie where a lot happens. The director of this directed Pinapple Express and The Sitter and this could not be more different then those two. This is a hard movie to review because really nothing happens but I did really enjoy this. This is basically just two guys experiencing life and love. There is a sub-plot with a woman they meet that seemed to have deeper meaning that I couldn't grasp. This is a movie I recommend though. Overall, a movie that isn't for everyone but one that I enjoyed and recommend for fans of indi-movies. I give it a B+.",1381449600,4,1080,4.378109452736318
5827152,2,B00DL47QDG,"This looks like one of those things that actors like to do for themselves after they get sick of doing too many ""Hollywood"" movies.  It's been a long time since I saw ""Waiting for Gadot"" that may have been an inspiration.  Two pathetic, depressing characters just picking at and on each other.  If that's your idea of funny then you might consider this a comedy.  (You might also consider getting some therapy.)  I found ""Our Idiot Brother"" to a lot more sad than humorous.  This one made me want to open a vein.  So Paul, sorry I loved your early stuff.",1381104000,,554,4.425742574257426
5827153,1,B00DL47QDG,"My son convinced me to watch this with him after a date recommended it to him.  Yee gads!  This was the most boring, plotless movie I have seen in years.  Two dudes painting lines in rural Texas.  So much potential and so little delivery.  They never quite develop as characters nor is the peripheral mystery ever given any wings.  Pass this one by.",1381017600,3,349,4.4603174603174605

5827176,1,B00DL47QDG,Worst movie ever.  Waited 20 minutes for it to get better and never did.  It was supposed to be about fighting a fire or I so thought. Horrible!!,1378771200,,145,4.142857142857143
5827177,5,B00DL47QDG,The art direction is top notch. I could identify with the characters and the director did a good job helping me too. The setting is great. Feels like a dream even though its a comedy / drama. Well done.,1378425600,,202,4.205128205128205

5827179,4,B00DL47QDG,I love to see that one of my favorite directors has more or less returned to form. His latest run of comedies really fall short of his ability to dive into everyday characters and make them interesting. This is a very enjoyable film.,1378252800,,233,4.441860465116279
5827180,4,B00DL47QDG,A movie worth watching! Funny yet serious. Paul Rudd did an amazing job in this movie. The whole 80's thing made it work very well.,1378252800,,131,4.28

His character was a new dimension for him which wad fresh to see but still wasn't't enough to make a movie I loved! It was better than seating around with nothing to do, but there's always something to watch on regular tv! Better try next time Paul! The movie admission was a much better movie with Paul, so catch that one if you get a chance!!!",1377561600,,486,4.180851063829787
