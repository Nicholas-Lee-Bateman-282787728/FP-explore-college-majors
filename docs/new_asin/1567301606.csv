186906,5,1567301606,"This film is a delight for Flamenco aficionados. I can't think of any other video that I have watched over and over, as I do this one. It's all about soul, and it has captured mine.",987292800,11,181,4.055555555555555
186907,5,1567301606,"Performance as art, flamenco as art and performance is what this film captures. Minimilist in tradional theatrical enticements this film captures the pure essence of the total flamenco experience. No fancy Hollywood set designs, extravagant staging is nil, this is pure art, the performances stand alone. At times the lighting only reveals a siloutte, never detracting from the pure essence. The film captures an indoor gitano gathering where all participants are involved, from just handclapping and chorus to center stage vocals and dance, all the gitanos interact and compliment one another. The beauty in this film comes from different angles, the authenticity, the various styles of flamenco, the emotions the artists emote and the feelings that are brought out in the viewer. So many different people perform that it is hard to identify indidviduals, which may be just the intent of the director as the cohesion of the gitano family in performance seems to be most important. One of the intriguing aspects of this performance is that there are so many ""older"" performers, who dominate and captivate the viewer. If one listens and closes ones eyes momentarily, it is hard to imagine one is listening to people well into their sixties and older. A brilliant moment is when a young gitano of maybe twelve years of age performs a stunning dance, a visually blazing with speed dervish solo and then is suddenly joined by an elder gitano who accompanies him. The juxtaposition is unforgetable as the young boy and elder each pay homage to each other, in unison, dancing off the set. The guitar work is fabulous by various masters including a sensational set by Paco de Lucia and even the modern interpretations of flamenco by Ketama. The rich vocals are guttural at times but the emotions of the sounds come from the deepest parts of the soul. The sounds of pain and passion, love and desire, grief and hope, solice and community, the soul of the gitanos comes through loud and clear. This is one to not be missed for complete flamenco that includes guitar, dance and vocals, Andalusian nights are calling, los gitanos te esperan.",978134400,134,2130,4.969187675070028
186908,5,1567301606,"The first reviewer lacks knowledge of the many different elements and styles of FLAMENCO.
This film captures FLAMENCO in its many forms with the best performers alive.  It is a real treasure that you will want to watch over and over.  HIGHLY RESOMMENDED.",971568000,6,254,4.883720930232558
186909,4,1567301606,"Having had the remarkable blessing of living with the Gypsies of Granada and having seen them spontaneously create flamenco as part of a living culture, I still thought this film, despite, or maybe because of, its  ""sterility"" was the essence of flamenco.  Like all things,  flamenco gets politicized.  Personally, I have no political opinion on  Saura, New Flamenco, any of it.  If it WORKS, it's done.  This film works.",948585600,21,421,5.0144927536231885
186910,5,1567301606,"Although the rich and diverse cultural phenomenon of flamenco is extremely difficult to embrace within the limited frame of a single movie, this work of Carlos Saura is a great job on representing its  styles and forms. Yes, you need to have some basic understanding of flamenco to enjoy it - it is not meant for mass entertainment, but for those who are looking a little bit more deeply into this wonderful art form. And, yes, the core of flamenco is CANTE, not the dance, as unprepared spectator might expect. A lot of joy in recognizing the distinguished participant artists, (if you know them). I could only wish this film to be longer and even more diverse. Very recommended for serious flamenco aficionados, for everybody who wishes to get to know flamenco in depth, and in variety.

********

BTW - Joaquin Cortes is a great 'bailarin', but not 'bailaor' in my view, and THE LEAST authentic flamenco dancer here; he has a solid ballet background but too distilled from the real flamenco puro. However, I can see that he represents the most ""digestible"" ""flamenco-like"" image for the spectators who have very superficial idea of this culture.",1168387200,8,1148,4.846938775510204
186911,5,1567301606,"An amazing combination of the best of the best--this is the way flamenco is supposed to be.  The dancing is precise and the singing soulful.  My only complaint is that the performances take place in a cathedral, which seems a stark backdrop when compared to an open plaza or a crowded nightclub.  Still, of course, a phenomenal collections of players.",1168300800,3,351,4.816666666666666
186912,5,1567301606,"The film is of a magical beuty in its minimalistic presentation. From the strongfelt aperture with La Paquera de Jerez to the multitud of dancers converging at the end, makes this an estimulating introduction to the world of Flamenco.",1168300800,,234,5.0256410256410255
186913,4,1567301606,"Having spent my recent vacation in Spain, and having attended a flamengo dance performance in Sevilla (without bringing a recorder)I was glad finding this DVD. The music is of course highly authentic and I much enjoyed it. After a while though it becomes ""all of the same thing"" and starts to bore you. I ejected this DVD after 45 minutes or so. Nevertheless I do recommend purchasing it especially if you want to have an immediately accessable "" souvenir"" of your visit to Spain.",1152316800,7,480,4.726190476190476
186914,5,1567301606,"While this performance is choreographed, hence not 100% authentic Cant Gitano, this is a very rare opportunity to see many of the great people of flamenco in one place. Carlos Saura has brought together people of the likes of Moraito Chico, Fernanda de Utrera, Manolo Sanlcar, Manuel Agujetas, Paco del Gastor, Chocolate, Farruco, Farruquito, Tomasa la Macanita, Tomatito, etc, etc!

This DVD has on it most of the important forms of Flamenco, and hence makes a good reference. The presentation is somewhat artificial, and some of the important personalities are missing however - the most notable being Pedro Bacan. Still, it is a must have for any aficionado of the Cant.",1150070400,9,673,5.063063063063063
186915,4,1567301606,Saura is always very good at stories about the world of dance and this one is a real must for those who admire flamenco.,1132617600,7,120,4.041666666666667
186916,3,1567301606,"This DVD was not what I expected.  Although Flamenco covers song and dance, I expected more dance.  I'm a high school teacher and presented it to my upper level students.  They too were a bit disappointed, and wanted to hear less singing.",1129766400,9,238,4.619047619047619
186917,5,1567301606,"I first saw this film in the company of my own flamenco instructor, who actually rented it and brought it to my home.  She had studied flamenco throughout her childhood in Spain, and as an adult performed professionally for many years, both in the United States and in Spain.  Having her expert commentary as we watched the film together was fabulous, as she was able to explain who most of the dancers/singers are (all are highly respected and well-known artists) and how they are regarded in the flamenco world (traditionalist, modernist, etc.) as well as the many nuances and subtexts to the performances.

While the historical and biographical information supplied by my instructor enhanced my first viewing, the film absolutely captivated me on a purely visual basis.  The direction and design of Carlos Saura is brilliant.  In fact, if I were a filmaker I would be ""borrowing"" his design for my own projects!  Using an abandoned railway station as his backdrop, simple screens and lighting frame and enhance the performances.  And the performances, both singing and dancing, are fantastic.  I will admit, the singing was somewhat of an acquired taste, but by the 4th or 5th time I watched this DVD (I purchased it immediately after my first viewing), I was enjoying the singing as much as the dancing.  I think my absolute favorite performance however is when the very young Farruquito (now one of the current flamenco superstars) performs with his grandfather, the legendary flamenco master El Farruco.  His pride, and love, for his grandson, and the heir to his artistic legacy of flamenco puro, is very palpable, and very poignant.

If you are a true fan of flamenco, you probably already own this DVD, as the original film was made over ten years ago.  However, if you have only a passing interest in flamenco, and only plan to see one film, then I absolutely recommend this one.  It unites the sheer artistic brilliance of performer and director into a truly remarkable event.",1128729600,23,1987,4.913173652694611
186918,4,1567301606,"To the reviewers who are complaining about there being too much singing and not enough dancing, learn what flamenco is based on.  Flamenco is all about the CANTE, people...the song.  The dance, the guitar, and all those fireworks are secondary to the song.  True enough, this movie is an artsy version of what you find in Madrid, and doesn't have enough of the rootsy flamenco you find in Sevilla or Jerez de la Frontera.  However, if you are reading this, you probably aren't interested in the more rootsy stuff.",1112659200,18,513,4.730337078651686
186919,1,1567301606,"Flamenco - a music that came from the streets and caves is newly repackaged in this ""movie"" and set in, of all places, some type of warehouse/sterile art museum.

Everything is very arty without the hint of anyone breaking a sweat.  The camera moves from one performance to another with no hint of story or purpose  The performers look very posed and stilted and one of the essential components of a great flamenco performance, the audience participation or 'jaleo' is totally absent.  Why?  Well there is no audience.

A very sanitised and packaged version sorely lacking 'duende' and authenticity.

Little to no information on flamenco, its history, key players, styles.  Yes, this is Flamenco for the New York chattering classes.

I recommend you rent from your local library before you buy...",1110240000,17,796,5.015267175572519
186920,1,1567301606,"If this film repesents flamenco, then flamenco is 80% singing - 20% dancing (half of which is subordinate to singing). This should be listed as a concert film - not a dance film.",1107475200,10,178,4.424242424242424
186921,5,1567301606,"Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow,... I am stunned by this flamenco performance.  If there is better flamenco out there, I won't be sorry if I never see it, after I saw flamenco in this movie. Bravo!",1103760000,4,189,4.25
186922,5,1567301606,"Those not in the know tend to think of Flamenco in terms of women with fans and flying skirts and men in boots and macho attitudes.  Well, yeah, but there's more, much more.  This movie, filmed in a converted Spanish railway station, presents the full range of the Gitano's art, from traditional to modern, individual to group, expressing all the pain and joy of a true, very serious artform.  A delight.",1064880000,13,404,4.661971830985915
186923,3,1567301606,"I was looking foward to see this video because I have been familiar with all those artists since I was a kid back in my country.
Once I started the tape most of it had broken images. Once in a while I would be able to enjoy without a headache what was going on. I have no idea if anyone has had the same fate with the VHS as I have because I didn't read any negative reviews. So I guess I was blessed with the worst quality video of them all.
What I regret is how $$$ it was. I am so dissapointed I don't even want to go through the trouble of spending money to return it.",1034294400,16,572,3.8151260504201683
186924,5,1567301606,"Without doubt, this is pretty close to the pure heart of flamenco. They have a group of Spaniards singing Villancicos, which is really very interesting.  The singing is as authentic, and as soulful, as you will find at any tavern or Pena in Jerez or Cordoba, etc. As far as dancing, is not the primary point of this piece, but dancing in flamenco was traditionally a spontaneous action to the rhythm, like hand clapping. Dancing is also a percussion instrument. To the real aficionado dancing is just part or the accompaniment to the singer, like the guitar. If you want a classic, watery interpretation of flamenco, then look to the flamenco companies' and National Ballet of Spain performances. These are for the casual observer. This movie has some real Cante Jondo. There is a piece in the film with some modern Nuevo-flamenco dance; this was the only departure from traditional Flamenco. If you want more fire you will have to search for old Spanish movies or head for Andaluz.",1029283200,20,982,4.810650887573964

186926,1,1567301606,TOO MUCH focus on the flamenco singing which leaves much to be desired unless to like to hear hoarse voices screaming.  NOT ENOUGH flamenco dancing by really good dancers.  I've loved the flamenco companies' and National Ballet of Spain performances I've seen and all were far superior to this tape.  I'll sell this used to anyone - one viewing with fast forward button was enough.,1026345600,9,381,4.8307692307692305
186927,5,1567301606,"I dare you to find a better documentarian on the art of flamenco than Saura. Simply bringing this obsure but masterful artform to video is magical enough, but to have Saura do it is miraculous. He has chosen from the best that could be gathered in Spain, and did an awesome job putting them on a 2 hour tape. They only criticism is that this is not available on DVD, but no matter, it is a MUST for anyone who is a true flamenco purist or musicologist. The piece is beautifully staged, perfectly photographed and ingeniously edited.",1015804800,49,532,4.494845360824742

186929,1,1567301606,"This is a very dissapointing video. If you're expecting to see a long Joaquin Cortes performance, forget it!. He only appears  for 1 or 2 minutes.

7796809,5,1567301606,"For any aficionado of flamenco (or for anyone approaching it for the first time), the performances in this film are the real deal. These artists were (& many of them still are) the best of the best! Sadly, a number of these incomparable artists have also died since the film was made, so we are truly fortunate that their art has been preserved in a film of this astonishing quality. The director, Carlos Saura, also recognizes that the ""cante"" (flamenco singing) is central to the art form, & although it can be difficult & jarring for many Americans to ""get"", it is given its' rightfully premier place in the film (much like blues singing was so prominent in Ken Burns' documentary on ""Jazz""). And with Vittorio Storaro's cinematography, this film is a banquet for all of the senses! This is a cinematic treasure that is deep & rich & sensual & intoxicating& a glimpse into a uniquely Spanish art form that it takes years to get to know intimately.",1513209600,,950,4.627218934911243

7796813,4,1567301606,"I enjoy the spanish culture and have in the past danced at La Fairia in Sevilla. However, I'm not a person who follows dance performances. This DVD was wonderful in several way.
1) the performances both by dancers and musicians were done by performers, but by artists.
2) people featured in the DVD are some of the all-time best artists and it is obvious
3) For the most part these are not ""pretty"" Hollywood people, they are real people with passion for their craft.
4) The flamenco makes you heart & spirit come alive & soar. This DVD captured that magic.

Watching this dvd after knowing about Director Saura's Tango moved me to purchase other Saura films. They do not disappoint.",1358208000,3,683,4.644628099173554

7796817,1,1567301606,"There is no story line or plot, as there usually is in Saura's other movies that involve dancing; dancers and singers in a flamenco studio just perform. There is way too much singing (and close-ups of people singing) of the painful, wailing and grimacing type and not enough joyful song. And there is not enough dancing!! What little dancing there is is a bit cool and a touch modern, as are the stark sets. I like authentic flamenco (I have seen wonderful performances by well-known dancers) and I usually like Carlos Saura, but the dancing in this movie is somewhat pretentious and unengaging. I fast-forwarded through most of the DVD.  CVA",1185235200,2,642,4.783783783783784
