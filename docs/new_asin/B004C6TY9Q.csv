4325998,3,B004C6TY9Q,"The Blue Umbrella (not to be confused with Disney's animated film of the same name) follows the story of young girl, Biniya, who lives in a small, mountain village in India. One day she finds a blue umbrella which seems to be owned by some Japanese tourists (apparently, Biniya's town a tourist stop). The Japanese group ask for the their umbrella back, instead swapping it for a bear claw amulet worn by Biniya. Biniya's new bright blue umbrella is the envy of the town. There are quite a few musical numbers (like Biniya parading around with her bumbershoot) that paced throughout the film. Nandu, an old, scheming snack store owner has his eye on Biniya's prize. He pesters her to buy it from her. She refuses. Then one day, the umbrella goes missing. Nandu, and quite a few other town's people coveted the Biniya's unique possession. The umbrella was stolen. And the culprit found.
""The Blue Umbrella"" is a morality tale  the sins of stealing, and the act of forgiveness.
The cinematography was excellent. The alpine village of Himichal Pradesh picturesque.
Young Sheyra Sharma as Biniya was quite charming. The performances from Pankaj Kapur as Nadu quite good (he's a pretty funny guy.)
The song and dance numbers were a bit much. Yes, this was Bollywood (released in 2005), so the film felt a bit dated.
This was a pleasant film for the family.",1412640000,3,1351,4.773504273504273

4326000,3,B004C6TY9Q,"The Blue Umbrella is an instant classic. It is simple, heart warming and metaphorical at the same time. It is based on a novella by celebrated author Ruskin Bond. Bond's story captures the mood and the uncomplicated lifestyle of a small hill town spot-on and Vishal Bharadwaj renders it on the screen flawlessly.

A little girl (Shreya Sharma) trades her lucky charm for an umbrella with a Japanese tourist. The beauty of the umbrella takes over the whole of the town. Everybody falls for it but none more than the stingy shopkeeper Khatri (Pankaj Kapoor). He wants to have it by hook or crook. What Khatri finds and looses in his quest for the umbrella is the rest of the story.

This film is a reminder of the fact that Pankaj Kapoor never got the recognition he deserves. He is one of the finest actors this country has ever produced. He single-handedly turns 'The Blue Umbrella' from an ordinary film into extra ordinary achievement. The nuances he brings to his role - a twitch of his face, a gait to his walk, everything - works to etch the character in the minds of the viewer. A splendid performance is all I can say in short.

The little Shreya is endearing. We are as heart broken as she is when she looses her umbrella; and we rejoice with her when she dances with it.

The biggest credit of all, however, goes to Vishal Bharadwaj. It takes courage and commitment to make the kind of films he has made so far. A gem of a film !",1304380800,5,1438,4.415094339622642

4326002,2,B004C6TY9Q,"On the upside, the setting in the mountains of Himachal Pradesh is breathtaking. Other than that, I gave this movie a full half-hour to establish a point or a story line of ANY kind and gave up. Whatever novella this is based from, the movie version does not seem to get it across. There is no character development, no continuity between scenes, no meaningful (or even interesting) dialogue, and otherwise jumps aimlessly between a bunch of plot fragments and never landing on any thread that ties them together. Worse, this is right form the beginning. The movie opens with an old man listening to a recording on headphones telling him he is going to get rich then cuts IMMEDIATELY to a bunch of random kids singing and dancing all over the mountains while wearing fake mustaches....?!?!? Then at 16 minutes there is a prolongued wobbly aerial shot which can only be surmised to have been included in the film to deliberately make you dizzy. All this on top of ham-handed and awkward acting leaves this movie with no redeeming qualities. And it looked like it was going to be so cute.",1458777600,,1086,4.69109947643979

I miss being in Himalayas so much... I have watched this film at least four times. Set in a small Himachal town, this film has beautiful locations and the almost impeccable cinematography exploits that really well. No complaints at all: great story, direction, music. A cute-little touching film. The town has its own little world. What great performance by Pankaj Kapoor!",1449446400,,495,4.963855421686747

Easy on the eye, easy on the ear (easy on the wallet) movie. Kids, 12 and below, will think it is the cat's whiskers. Nice scenery. Yes, we are biased BUT I am sure that most of you will give this at least 4 starts if you watch it. Enjoy.",1438992000,,380,3.948051948051948
