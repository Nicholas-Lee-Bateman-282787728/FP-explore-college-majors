8226049,4,B000WXR4WC,An unusual compilation. Interesting if you're interested in Mazur. Recording quality is spotty on certain discs. But I'm a big fan of Mazur so it was fun to see him in different setting.,1468972800,,186,4.666666666666667
8226050,5,B000WXR4WC,"This five disc box set of DVDs offers the viewer a thorough insight into the conductor, his working practices and the political world he experienced in Leipzig in the movement for German Reunification centred there.

The first disc contains three documentaries, the first two of which deal specifically with the above. The opening documentary is a 30 minute coverage of the Peaceful Revolution embarked upon by the inhabitants of Leipzig to escape the oppressive political situation that controlled their lives and thoughts. There is plenty of live footage as well as detailed description and explanation from interviewees of particular relevance. This is an engrossing documentary from 1999 and a political statement that should never be forgotten.

The following 58 minute documentary explores the conductors working methods as applied to both the Leipzig Gewandhaus orchestra and the New York Philharmonic. Masur is shown to be an exacting taskmaster who works tirelessly, and with energy, to achieve exactly what he envisages to be the correct musical message. Both orchestras cope with this exacting regime and find the results musically rewarding. The attending public also respond with enthusiasm and this is important in order to achieve the necessary financing.

The third documentary is one of the series of Euroarts productions designed expressly to provide insight, both historical and musical, into musical works of significance. In this case it showcases the Mendelssohn violin concerto supported by the Gewandhaus orchestra under Masur and has a running time of 25 minutes.

The remaining discs are all of concerts featuring Masur with, mostly, his Leipzig orchestra.  Mendelssohn is, not surprisingly as the conductor has become frequently associated with that composer, featured quite substantially in these concerts. The earliest comes from 1993, followed by 1997. A Gala concert from 2007 follows with a wide range of repertoire. This is an HD recording and offers true surround sound and the best recorded product so far. There are numerous presentations made during an evening designed to honour Masurs 80th birthday. Fortunately repeat viewing is catered for by the facility to play just the music and eliminate the presentations. This is an enjoyable Gala selection but some viewers may find it a bit short of musical substance.

This is not the case with the final disc from the Verbier 2009 concerts. The young Festival orchestra, in effect a youth orchestra for the occasion, is suitably expert and delivers an exciting performance of Mendelssohns symphony 3 (the Scottish). Even more exciting is the fresh and spontaneous performance of the Piano concerto 1 given by a very young Yuja Wang on top form. Her bonus feature of Stravinskys Petrushka movements is equally lively. The disc is opened with a fine performance of Mendelsohns Piano sextet which is good enough to be considered as one of the best available. This is also an HD recording with full surround sound as well as stereo. It is also available singly for those who do not wish to buy this whole set.

This then is a rewarding and comprehensive survey of Masurs world and will be of considerable interest for supporters of this significant conductor. The recordings are good for their respective period and it has not been necessary to delve very far back into the archives to find suitable material.

This box offers a valuable historical and musical insight into Masurs musical and political background",1467590400,,3494,5.237924865831842
8226051,5,B000WXR4WC,Well done.  Fun and interesting.  I am a great fan of Kurt Masur; this was a nice surprise.,1465862400,,91,4.0

8226053,5,B000WXR4WC,"Kurt Masur was the principal conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra for 26 years. In the autumn of 1989, there were large demonstrations in Leipzig against the limitations of freedom imposed by the Deutsche Democratische Republik.  Kurt Masur became involved as mediator, presenting his call for no violence to the government leaders and appealing to the public by radio not to use force.  It was the strength of his personality and the high regard to which he was held by the people of the DDR and Leipzig that resulted in the success of his appeal.  In 1996, he gave up his position as principal conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra.  He continued on as principal conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, a position he held with Leipzig since 1991, for some additional years.  He gave up that position as well to become of principal conductor of another two orchestras: the London Symphony Orchesta and the Orchestre National de France.  In the summer of 2007, he returned to Leipzig in celebration of his 80th birthday, which was on July 18, 2007, to conduct a concert with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra.  He invited Harald Schmidt, a German talk-show host whom he regarded highly, to help liven up the concert.  He stated that his conducting is thought of as teutonic and serious.  None of the pieces selected for the gala concert were serious.  The first one, ""Die lustigen Weiber von Windsor"" by Otto Nicolai was the first piece he conducted in his first job at Halle.  This was followed by a Mazurka by Moniuszko from the opera, ""Halka"".  Then came two lovely ""Liebeslieder Waltzes"" by Brahms, sung by the MDR Radio Choir.  Tchaikowsky's ""Capriccio Italien"" was next, followed by Mambo from ""West Side Story"" by Leonard Bernstein.  Two songs from Gerschwin's ""Porgy and Bess"" were next, with the song, ""There's a boat dat's leavin' soon for New York,"" sung by Harald Schmidt.  The ""Sorcerer's Apprentice"" of Paul Dukas was next, followed by George Bizet's ""Carmen"".  The program ended with a piece he brought back from Brazil, ""The Girl from Ipanema"" by Antonio Carlos Jobim.

Harald Schmidt did help liven up the concert.  There was a great deal of verbal banter between Kurt Masur and Harald Schmidt, which can easily be translated into English on the DVD.  Harald Schmidt proved to be a real asset in this celebratory concert.

Every piece was played most masterfully.  The audience was enchanted to have Kurt Masur back.  There was also a birthday celebration in addition to the concert, with food and rose wine (Masur's favorite wine type). Andreas Schultz, Gewandhaus administrative director, and Ronnie Maier, the general manager of the Leipzig Marriott Hotel at that time, were responsible for the food and wine.  They offered to my wife and me, during our visit in May of last year, the opportunity to taste the four wine candidates but not to vote.  It would have indeed been a most pleasurable experience to have been there.  This DVD is the next best thing, though.  It is wonderfully entertaining, delightful, not serious.",1207353600,5,3070,4.947265625
