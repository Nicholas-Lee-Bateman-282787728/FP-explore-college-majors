8246860,4,B0012M8FLQ,I gave this as a gift to my mother-in-law as she kept talking about these shows.  I thought this set featured the best variety of episodes.  It was a very good price and arrived fast.  I will definitely reorder again.  Thank you very much.,1420070400,,239,4.363636363636363
8246861,3,B0012M8FLQ,This item was OK but it wasn't what I was expecting. I was wanting the REALLY old movies of the Little Rascals where Spanky was a baby. This wasn't it but I still watch it.,1362873600,,172,3.942857142857143
8246862,5,B0012M8FLQ,"Great DVD set for the money. Almost everyone loves the ""Little Rascals"" and I wanted the grandkids to see them too. The Little Rascals were on TV every day on our local TV channel 3, Charlotte ,N.C. and I watched them every day after school when I was young.",1356566400,,258,4.285714285714286
8246863,5,B0012M8FLQ,"If you belong to the 50-something crowd then you remember watching the Little Rascals while getting ready for school or after coming home and turning on that glowing tube-filled TV which showed the world as it was then - in black and white. You won't find these gems on ""TV"" anymore. These are wonderful examples of kids just being kids, not the polished pint-sized actors and actresses that are around today. Sometimes the plots are thin and the laughs are - well - juvenile but there are no ""bad"" words or purposeful off-color double entendres. This collection contains the best of the best in the wonderful shades of grey from the world we grew up in. Get it before the politically correct watchmen lock it away for good!",1303689600,6,724,4.6640625
8246864,4,B0012M8FLQ,"This boxed set of these old Our Gang episodes is a treasure in a sense that it showcases a different America. An America that was for all intent and purposes:politically incorrect. While looking on Wikipedia, one can see how a great deal of these episodes are recorded as in the ""Notes/Content edits for television section: prints edited due to racial humor involving African-Americans and Asian Americans."" These episodes don't jive with todays watered down and somewhat effeminate society. I have some black friends and they would dismiss the themes in these short films as childish fun and foolishness as folks should have a thicker skin plus not concentrate on the outer differences of people, but, the character of the person on the inside.
That's what God looks at, as shown in His Bible.

I gave this boxed set a 4 star rating because of the labeling of the DVDs are a little flimsy as that the labels aren't as robust as they should be. The Little Rascals taught me this: our drive by media has villianized what was considered just play that was understood by BOTH parties involved. Also shown in its full truth is what concerns that supposed dreaded killer ""PITBULL"" a.k.a. the American Staffordshire Terrier. I never ever heard of Petey/Pete the Pup ripping Buckwheat to shreds and crippling him for life or attacking Spanky that lead to his serious injury and/or death. The truth that was demonstarted is that these dogs are good dogs and it's bad owners that make bad dogs. Little Rascals shows these creatures in a positive light, where they rightfully belong.

Again, these short films showed a more innocent America (good old days) as opposed to now (bad new days) where every move is scrutinized for the potential bad in a person i.e. the only good folks to the police are their fellow officers and family members; the rest of the world is full of potential perpetrators/perps and lawbreakers. I consider the Little Rascals good wholesome entertainment by responsible parents that can help their child to discern what is right and wrong plus the person that enjoys the nostalgia of a different and simpler time in America.",1229817600,18,2138,4.8708791208791204
