8557383,4,B004FN26IM,"I bought this knowing it was made in 1968 - in fact, because it was made in 1968.  I remember seeing this show on TV as a kid and I bought it more for nostalgia than information.  I've read critiques that it's no longer completely accurate thanks to the almost 50 years or research since, so keep that in mind if you're really after something educational.  Not surprisingly it's in 3:4 format and the quality of some parts isn't that great, but hearing Joseph Campanella;s narration again after so many years brought back some fond memories.  So get it to remind you of those great National Geographic specials and enjoy this period piece as I did.  For something accurate and up-to-date, with HD quality widescreen video, keep looking.",1485820800,,736,4.71875
8557384,2,B004FN26IM,"I volunteer at a Natural History Museum that is currently hosting an exhibit featuring Lizards & Snakes. I purchased this DVD (a copy of the original VHS) because it is a NG product - plus I am interested in increasing my limited knowledge of these creatures.

I did not pay attention to the original release date - 1968! Because this program is over 40 years old, the scientific history/knowledge on this DVD woefully out of date. The 'animation' is fun to watch to see how far we have come in our digital/technological age. Unfortunately it is only amusing, because what is depicted is incorrect. This is not the fault of NG - merely that the knowledge gained over the last 40 years has made most what was presented obsolete.

However, the middle portion of the program about these fascinating creatures is still interesting and basically correct. I do not recommend this to anyone without a working knowledge of paleontology & earth history. But if you want to enjoy something from the past get this DVD, then sit back and watch an amusing bit of 'history'.",1329523200,6,1060,4.724324324324324
