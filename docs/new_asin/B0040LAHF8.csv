4240608,5,B0040LAHF8,I received it perfectly on time and was please with the package quality. It was clearly untampered with and brand new.,1356998400,,118,4.666666666666667
4240609,5,B0040LAHF8,"Big Laker fan, I actually have the dvd that commemorated this championship season, but this bluray has the entire championship series in high def picture! A must own for any Laker fan",1353801600,2,183,4.75
4240610,5,B0040LAHF8,"First of all, let me tell you these are the very first blu-rays I bought. So I cannot give a fair statement about how the video quality of this set stands against other high-def media. But as a ""prophane"" in this matter, let me tell you this: boy, the picture is awesome!

On the sports side, instead, having witnessed all the championships from the Showtime era on, I guess I'm entitled to say a little more: and let me tell you this, the 2010 championhsip has a special place in my collection. While it's true that Boston didn't have Kendrik Perkins for game 7, it's also true that Andrew Bynum wasn't his dominant self for the entire playoffs. So I guess it's fair to say it was a fair contest and WE WON!!! :-) At last, we defeated the Celtics in a game 7 of a final series! :-) :-) :-) And even if game 7 was indeed atrocious from a highlights point of view, it was one of the most tense, most satisfying games I've ever watched. In recent years, it's up there with game 7 of the 2000 western finals against Portland (the one with the unlikely Bryant-Shaq alley-oop). If purple and gold is in your heart, you gotta have it!",1303084800,3,1128,4.295774647887324
4240611,4,B0040LAHF8,"This is a very good video which reflects the evolution of the team throughout the 2009-2010 season.  It's not quite as good as the DVD for the 2008-09 season.  I think the quality of the interviews is not quite as good; that is, the range of people interviewed and the insights obtained.  However, I do find myself watching this every couple months and recapturing the flavor of that campaign as well as the personalities who were on the team and especially those new to the team such as Ron Artest.  This was the year the Lakers avenged their humiliation at the hands of the Celtics two seasons before, so the footage of the 7-game finals is priceless.",1297987200,,653,4.555555555555555
4240612,5,B0040LAHF8,"Since I am a Laker fan, it was easy to enjoy this blu ray set. I am a bit disappointed with the bonus features on the discs but the excitement of all 7 games in there entirety more than make up for it. I definitely recommend this package for all Laker fans. Any baskerball fan will enjoy this intensely played series by the NBA""S top two franchises.",1295740800,,349,4.223880597014926
4240613,3,B0040LAHF8,"It a must have if you're a hardcore Laker fan! Also, the price is not bad than what it was originally was for. But I expected an HD quality when I bought this bluray version, but unfortunately it's like popping in a DVD version; not very sharp and clear. The picture quality is just ok, now I know why they lower the price to $39.",1294876800,9,330,4.092307692307692
4240614,3,B0040LAHF8,"Been waiting for the price to mark down a little bit before purchasing it, took several weeks of waiting before the price went down from $89 to $67. Now that I purchased it, the price went down dramatically in an instant from $67 to $55. Nice job Amazon website! It tracks its consumers well.

Don't know about rating the bluray a perfect 5, all you got are games 1-7 and press conferences as your bonus feature. Won't hurt their pocket if they could have included the Championship DVD in here as well so that you don't have to buy them separately. They were made by the same company, anyway (Bombo). I thought this is a ""COLLECTION EDITION"" as they say?",1289606400,4,654,4.45
4240615,5,B0040LAHF8,"I am a hardcore fan and i just had to have it. This was a epic series of two great teams that went to game 7 and my team won the ring.
I think i have never been as happy when we won game 7 and know i can watch the game all over again.
I have watch the game that the Lakers lost to and that is hard but that makes the win in game 7 just better.

If you are a Lakers fan or just a fan of great Basketball then you have to have this.",1289001600,8,430,3.3877551020408165
4240616,5,B0040LAHF8,"- Ron Artest, champagne-drenched, in his Game 7 post-interview: ""What's the question? I''ll be here all day. Well, not all day 'cause I do want to go to the club.""

So can one get enough of them L. A. Lakers? With that emotional, very classy ring ceremony just this past October 26th, I thought every possible drop of fan joy had been wrung out of the 2009-2010 Lakers Championship Team. But then this hefty DVD set rolls around with its eight discs, the first seven of which offer up the entire Games 1-7 of the tension-wracked 2010 NBA Finals series between Boston and Los Angeles. Note that the bonus eighth disc compiles a busload of post-game press conferences, spanning Games 1-7 and, yes, this includes Ron Artest's classic wacky, exuberant Game 7 post-conference interview on the dais (""I got Wheaties!"").

This has been one of the most intense, most hotly-contested NBA Finals in recent memory, and I am mulling over how hard core of a fan I am, whether I actually really want to sit thru those soul-killing games in which the Lakers lost (I don't know if I could put myself thru that again). Anyway, each DVD that features a game also comes with a mini-movie which provides an overview of that game, and the sights and sounds leading up to that game (including sound bites from players, coaches, and fans). You should know that each of these mini-movies consists of clips lifted straight from the L.A. Lakers'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NBA-Championship-2009-2010/dp/B003LRVN6Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NBA Championship 2009-2010</a>&nbsp;DVD, minus the voice-over narrator. Each of the first seven discs also comes with team score breakdowns for each quarter and team stats (field goal %s, offensive/defensive rebounds, turnovers, blocks, fouls). Note that the Game 7 disc also has Doris Burke' immediate and surreal post-game interview with Ron Artest (""Well, first off, I want to thank everybody in my 'hood..."") and the presentation of the Larry O'Brien and Finals MVP trophies. I know this DVD set is pricey as heck but, for you Lakers fans, this is about as must-have as it gets.

The bonus 8th disc gives you the following post-game press conferences:

- Game 1: Doc Rivers, Phil Jackson, Pau Gasol, Kobe Bryant
- Game 2: Doc Rivers, Phil Jackson, Ray Allen
- Game 3: Phil Jackson, Doc Rivers, Derek Fisher, Kobe Bryant
- Game 4: Doc Rivers, Kobe Bryant, Phil Jackson, Nate Robinson & Glen Davis
- Game 5: Doc Rivers, Paul Pierce, Phil Jackson, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett
- Game 6: Phil Jackson, Doc Rivers, Pau Gasol, Kobe Bryant
- Game 7: Doc Rivers, Phil Jackson, Kobe Bryant, Ron Artest",1288742400,25,2657,5.073226544622425

Lakers are still the best!!!

8412382,5,B0040LAHF8,"I really enjoyed watching this Finals series back in 2010 but had only viewed it in standard def. So it was nice to be able to watch it now in high def with the Blu-ray format. The picture quality is nice, sharp, and vibrant. And the sound quality is very clear and crisp.

There are four discs in total with the first three discs each housing two games(the forth disc has game 7 plus some bonus material). Lakers versus Celtics is a classic NBA rivalry and it is nice to have the latest one on a complete Blu-ray set.",1420243200,,518,4.232323232323233
8412383,5,B0040LAHF8,Great series and a great set of videos. I would recommend to any Laker fan.  Too bad they don't have all of these for the Laker championships of the 80's.,1416528000,,154,4.133333333333334

8412385,5,B0040LAHF8,"I loved the blu-ray quality you feel you're in the finals, it was so intense and a true rivalry.  I'm a die hard laker fan and it is a great feeling to see the glory days when Phil Jackson coached the team.

8412387,3,B0040LAHF8,"Wonderful to finally own the whole series and I only have one complaint: NO YEAR IN REVIEW DVD?!! Instead they give you a bonus dvd of press conferences, which is cool if you want to add that to the championship dvd itself. Sad to say this ""Collectors Edition"" feels incomplete without it. The ""Return To Glory"" '85 Series has theirs as does the '86 ""Sweet Sixteen"" as well...can't believe they didn't include the traditional Championship DVD to go with the games for the high price and all...makes me not want to buy another series unless I KNOW it has eveything it is supposed to..and to the association: no I will not buy the NBA-Champions-2009-2010-Angeles-Lakers as a separate item like they are trying to force fans to do as a way of nickel and diming us on this one, no thanks NBA",1367452800,3,787,4.588652482269503
8412388,4,B0040LAHF8,"Quality of the video is okay. Sort of expected something like the league pass that we get nowadays but I guess due to the advancement of technology we've been getting better quality streaming through league pass so not bad I guess.

Price? A bit expensive but I was buying them anyway just cause I would like to own a piece of history.

Overall, it's a good purchase if you're a fan of basketball cause the series was great!",1364947200,,424,4.423076923076923
8412389,5,B0040LAHF8,I went to game 6 of the 2010 NBA Finals and got this dvd set as a birthday present to remember that moment. Love that all 7 games are in this set! The blu-ray HD is legit. The mini-movies have additional clips to the 2010 Lakers champions DVD. Worth the money if you love the Lakers-Celtics rivalry.,1361836800,2,299,4.2631578947368425
