8237723,5,B0010DM47I,"This DVD series is one of the most moving I have seen. The animation is pretty good over all, but the story is the biggest sales point. It's complex, nuanced, and fascinating. Centered around a scientific experiment gone awry and its long-term effects, it follows the adventures of an alien being as she seeks to complete her earth-bound experience. She is consistently misunderstood by most she encounters and her journey is quite moving throughout. I so wanted to find out ""what happens next"" that I bought the entire series, and am very glad to have it. This series is serious in tone and provides food for thought about many issues. I highly recommend it.",1207872000,6,659,4.7894736842105265
