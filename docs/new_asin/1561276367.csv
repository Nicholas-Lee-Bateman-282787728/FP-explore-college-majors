7796147,2,1561276367,"Kovacs can be recognized as a bold, new innovator, and extraordinary talent as a character comic - although the only scant laughs in a typical show are found in his adlibs, ""in character"", i.e. Percy Dovetonsils, et. al.

In this two-episode set, we have more of the avant-garde thing, accent on videotape tricks, and not on clever, pointed dialogue. Some intriquing camera angles, image manipulation; close-ups of the cast, who, by the way, are superb at mime. It's a shame that their work confuses the viewer more than entertains him/her.

Best bit: Kovacs trouper as ""Mother Rustic"", who lives off the land...and relaxes by dabbling in conceptual painting, too far out for The Guggenheim!

Main selling-point for this package: Kovac's last show from c. January, 1962. Plus interesting foreshadowings of the popular show Laugh-In.
