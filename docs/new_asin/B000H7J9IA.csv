It needs to be made clear, however that the film is in Spanish for English speakers that are not educated other languages.",1368576000,,292,4.959183673469388
8137305,1,B000H7J9IA,"I purchased this dvd and was so disappointed that I just throw it to the dustbin.
It has vhs quality, no audio original version, only latinspanish dubbing. Brutally scruciating!
Do not buy it!",1323216000,,192,4.848484848484849
