3619658,5,B001GT9DQ6,"The setting for this anime is refreshingly different. Visually the anime is amazing with the details on the background, clothing and acuracy of fencing movements being superb. The story does get kind of rushed especially on the last disc but it does not take too much out of the whole experience, although it is so good they should have made a longer ending to give it the ending it deserved. This combines international espionage, history, and some fantasy. There are also no goofball characters which to me are usually annoying in some anime plus the tone of the series was not favorable for that. You should definitely buy it or you can buy the first DVD if you like that you will love the series. I might even buy this again as a set, anybody knows if there are any extras besides what is on the individual DVDs. Oh by the way the packaging is usually extermely nice as well and so is the soundtrack.",1231718400,4,904,4.484848484848484
3619659,5,B001GT9DQ6,"I got this as a Christmas gift and I liked it. I have only watched it once and need to watch it again to understand it a bit better (this is just me though). I liked the music. Michiru Oshima is talented and also composed the music to Full Metal Alchemist. There are spectacular fencing duels but not many. The few were spectacular. This is a historical fantasy anime, much of this is based on real people and actual events but with a fantasy, supernatural twist. And I sort of like that. I learned alot with the historical facts that come with each dvd. I will say though that this series may not be for everyone, so do some research before you buy this.

I have one complaint, in the dvd extras the voice actors for the main characters dressed up in drag for some reason. I thought I was going to see a documentary on d'Eon and how/why he dressed up in women's clothes in the 18th century with the opinions of the voice actors. But they themselves dressed up and took pictures. I saw no reason for this and thought an english cast interview would have benefited the series much better than this. Some of you may like this but it just wasn't for me. Honestly, I was turned off to the series because of this, but luckily I saw the japanese cast interview which made me want to watch it in japanese. I am giving the series 5 stars because the anime itself was great.",1231286400,2,1365,4.290697674418604
3619660,4,B001GT9DQ6,"I finally finished this series a few months ago after beginning it over a year ago, and overall I'm glad I took the time to see it through, despite some major flaws that were primarily towards the end. It's an above average anime series, and it could have been a 5 star show, but somewhere after the middle the story becomes too convoluted for its own good and the various explanations for why certain events crucial to the core story occured do not make any sense, and after volume 6 there are still several unanswered questions.

Without spoiling anything I'll say that the ending felt rushed and seemed like a really lazy way to wrap up all the various characters and arching plot lines. I really enjoyed the first half of this series, which was full of intrigue, espionage, great characters, clever dialogue and excellent blend of CGI and hand drawn animation, but unfortunately in the end the build-up of such an interesting story falls far short of expectations and the potential of what this series could have been. For those with an interest in European history, I recommend watching it, since the architecture, clothes, mannerisms and so on are incredibly realistic and well done, plus the mysticism of it keeps the plot moving at a steady pace with enough action to keep it from becoming dull, but again, after the middle it begins to meander aimlessly and culminates in a less than satisfying conclusion, so be prepared for a letdown.

Ultimately I'd say it's a disappointing show because of the unanswered questions and uninspired ending to what was an otherwise superb show with a highly unique premise.  Having said that, however, I still recommend watching it because despite some of the major letdowns, this show is a classic example of the journey being more important than the destination.",1225929600,21,1807,4.841423948220065

8306962,3,B001GT9DQ6,"I couldn't believe my eyes. Someone had apparently coughed up the venture capital for an anime series set in 18th century France, in which dashing musketeers fight with swords and engage in cloak-and-dagger political intrigue. The story involves historical figures such as Louis XV, Catherine II, the Marquise de Pompadour, and even relatively obscure names like Francis Dashwood.

Of course, this is an anime, so there are concessions to the audience. For example, the musketeers also fight zombies and their evil necromancer overlord, Maximilien de Robespierre, well-known in history for his command of the black arts. At least it wasn't giant robots, I guess. Like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/many/dp/B000767QTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">many</a>&nbsp;anime series, this one also places too much weight on complicated plot details and dramatic speeches, to the point where they overshadow plot coherence. But that comes with the territory, and this show isn't any better or worse in this regard than the norm. It may even be more realistic than Hollywood's latest&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/attempt/dp/B007CLSE8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">attempt</a>&nbsp;at a swashbuckling film, which involved kung fu and exploding airships.

The show is, however, gorgeous. The historical setting is not just a lark -- they recreated locations such as Versailles, the Cologne Cathedral, and the Winter Palace in truly magnificent, opulent detail. The streets and canals of St. Petersburg, and the French sunsets, are lovely. They even got the Orthodox priests' vestments right during Catherine's coronation! The costumes and weapons are historically accurate, with perhaps some minor touching up to make them ""cooler,"" but within reason. The sword-fights are flashy, but take the trouble to show fencing moves that are at least grounded in reality. Even some real-world historical facts are cleverly reinterpreted for the plot, like Catherine's role in Peter III's assassination (Catherine is splendidly tough in this show), or the historical Chevalier d'Eon's cross-dressing, which is turned into an unusual gender-bending super power. They even ease up on the visual conventions of anime, so that the characters look more realistic and European than anime characters typically do. When anime stereotypes do appear, they are used pretty cleverly -- real-life musketeers are actually supposed to have long anime hair, and showing Robespierre as an effete&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Legato/dp/B00AUJH32E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Legato</a>-like anime villain was an excellent (and hilarious) idea.

The main problem with the show -- more than the zombies, I mean -- is that the protagonists are kind of bland. Basically they are four awesome-looking dudes who, while not fighting zombies, spend their time looking concerned and making grave pronouncements and repetitive professions of French patriotism. This kind of works for d'Eon himself (his voice actor has a compelling husky tone), but there's not a lot of variety or side conversation, and really, there just isn't much difference between supporting characters other than the purely visual. This is a serious flaw for any kind of historical fiction, zombies or no. By contrast, Dumas' novels are bursting with ornate and witty dialogue, clever political hypocrisy, and adventurous spirit, still with plenty of room for honour and patriotism.

So, this isn't a work of genius. But I think it's more valuable for the possibilities it suggests, rather than for what it is. The show proves beyond a doubt that this is actually the perfect medium for historical fiction in the 21st century. Live-action sets are too expensive, directors and producers are too cowardly and unwilling to take risks, and actors have had too much plastic surgery to pass off as aristocrats. But animation gets around all of those problems, and the 24-episode anime format is absolutely perfect for a truly definitive film adaptation of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Three-Musketeers/dp/0140440259/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Three Musketeers</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twenty-Years-After/dp/0199537267/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twenty Years After</a>, without the stupid zombies, and with all of Dumas' verbal verve. This idea is staring us in the face, and I do hope that someone with enough money to hire a good writer picks up on it. Please, we beg you, rescue us from Hollywood's endless flood of loathsome sequels and remakes!

There is, however, one part of the show which instinctively gets the appeal of this setting. That is the ending, which is as opulently cruel as Dumas'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Reine-Margot/dp/2090319208/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Reine Margot</a>&nbsp;(and actually heavily recalls it), with poisoned wine, heartless betrayal, and blood on the luxurious carpets. People read historical fiction because it can show both the splendour and the terror of one's national past, and for a short while, the show's depiction of misplaced loyalty taps into that vein. I wish they'd had the guts to commit to their setting a bit more. But there's no sense bemoaning the show's flaws -- instead, let's just hope someone else fulfills its promise.",1378857600,3,5504,6.161458333333333
8306963,4,B001GT9DQ6,"This is one of the better Anime that I have seen in a long time .The visual look of this Anime feels as you are in France,with the play of historical real people and fiction you get a history lesson in a Anime. I recommend this to anyone its more of a adult Anime but anyone who has to take world history may enjoy it it made me go back and do some research on France.",1293235200,,368,3.8552631578947367
8306964,5,B001GT9DQ6,"The other reviewers went into great detail about this anime so there's no need to follow a trail that's already been walked. I will say that this was a different anime that the typical stuff we get from Japan. This anime is pretty much historical fiction. A tale about real people who existed in a story that sounds like something Stephen King came up with. I could honestly see this being a movie and doing well.

There was some confusion with the story though. It follows a pretty heavy outline and you better pay attention to whats going on. What confused me though was the girl Lia and her Brother Deon. For one thing they look just a like...as most of the men in this anime are drawn very femininely. The plot has this strange affection with cross-dressing and gender swapping. Which was quite odd at certain moments.

Other than that this anime is a pretty good watch. My only complaints about it are how depressing it becomes. The ending is pretty hopeless and not very satisfying. I didn't walk away with a jolly feeling exactly. If the purpose of this anime was to show just how ruthless Monarchy's are it's mission accomplished.

Well worth picking up and checking out if your looking for a change of pace.",1274227200,2,1216,4.568807339449541

8306966,5,B001GT9DQ6,"Historical fiction at its finest, Le Chevalier d'Eon is a fantastic series. Set slightly before the French Revolution, d'Eon focuses on d'Eon de Beaumont, an aristocrat living in Versailles whose sister's body is found in a coffin on the Seine River. Unable to be put to rest, d'Eon and his sister's souls merge into one in the body of d'Eon. Given the greenlight to investigate her murder by the king, d'Eon's adventures will lead him to Russia, England and then back to France as he searches for the perpetrators.  Along the way, he meets up with Durand, a fellow aristocrat, Tellagory, an old soldier and friend, and Robin, a young boy who although a commoner lives in Versailles and is extremely intelligent for his young age.  The ""Four Musketeers"" get involved in various political intrigue plots in the countries they visit as well as the inner workings of Versailles, where their fate ultimately lies.  Opposing them are an occultist group lead by a mysterious man named Maximillian Robespierre, who wants to destroy the monarchy of France and bring about revolution.  Filled with fantastic subplots, great animation, and intriguing characters, Le Chevalier d'Eon is one of handful of excellent Anime series that have come out in recent years and should not be missed.",1257379200,4,1276,5.004716981132075
8306967,5,B001GT9DQ6,"Im sure anyone who has ever looked this anime up have seen the rave reviews about the animation and I whole heartedly agree so I'll skip that part of this review.
Plot-wise this was a great piece of work, a great historical fiction story. French history is intruiging and the events leading up to the revolution in France and in other countries are an interesting time period and a great setting for an anime. There are many reviewers who say it had a dull ending but I, for one, did not see this as the case. The ending was very much like that of a tradgic play which coincidentally audiences have a hard time accepting. Also, alot of the twists and suprises happen in the last 5 or 6 episodes and the whole story leads up to the begining of the revolution.
Anyone who enjoyed animes such as Rurouni Kenshin, Peacemaker, or other historical fiction animes will enjoy this and especially the well done fighting scenes. This ending is not a let down, its realistic and is what really would happen in the politics of hte 1700s",1246060800,4,1024,4.481283422459893
8306968,5,B001GT9DQ6,"If someone would have told me that an anime that can best be described as Alexandre Dumas meets George Romero could be this good, I would have been sceptical to say the least.  But after caving in after reading so much positive buzz, I am very glad to have this in my collection.

Mid-level French spy d'Eon de Beaumont, based on a real-life 18th century transvestite, is devastated when the body of his beautiful, talented big sister Lia, a fictional hardcore superspy, is found floating in a coffin on the Seine pumped full of mercury.  Naturally, he wants to find out the details behind her death and puts the rest of his life on hold, including his engagement to his fiance Anna - but things get more than a little odd when he starts being chased by Gargoyle zombies and his sister's spirit starts posessing him when he wavers in battle.  He is soon approached by three other males in Lia's life who also claim to have cared enough about her to want to avenge her when they hear of her death:  the Queen's page Robin, a very young friend of both Lia and Anna who d'Eon wants to protect due to his age but allows to come along because he can handle a pistol well enough to hold his own; Durand, a dashing spy who often co-worked with Lia and had apparently been in love with her; and legendary swordsman Teillagory, d'Eon and Lia's aging but still fit former fencing instructor who has come upon word of his protege's fate.

The ""Four Musketeers"" will have their work cut out for them as they travel across Europe to discover the truth, though.  Lia was not the kind of spy to botch a job - and considering that spies know what they're getting into and what will happen to them if they're caught the fact that her soul is not at rest suggests an alarming betrayal..

The highlight of the series is undoubtedly the phenomenal artwork.  Everything from the Palace of Versailles to Cologne Cathedral and the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg is rendered in loving detail, as are the period costumes.  It's also just plain fun to watch, if fun is the right word for a story with such a serious tone.  The swordfights, battles against the Gargoyle zombies, supernatural trappings and of course the intrigue surrounding Lia's death keep things jumping.  Lia herself is posthumously one of the story's most interesting elements, as she seems to waver between a thirst for vengeance at all costs and desire to protect four guys she cared for very much in very different ways until we finally get her whole story.  The relationships the guys develop with eachother and their posthumous bond with Lia give the story emotional depth - especially in the final episodes.  Aside from people who just aren't into period pieces or stories with occult elements, the only people who I would advise to stay clear are history buffs who would go into apopleptic fits at the sometimes broad liberties taken with tweaking history.

The bit about the Gargoyle zombies should clue everyone else in about that though, and this is otherwise a great choice for adult viewers who want a dark action anime that doesn't involve mecha.",1243123200,23,3104,4.638686131386861
8306969,2,B001GT9DQ6,"This series was not meant to be historically accurate.
It is a melange of French historical characters, zombies, samurai and knights, therefore...a bunch of cultures. The entertainment is similar to The DaVinci Code: elaborate and confusing plot, mixing cultures and lots of adventure.
Even with the confusing plots and unanswered questions, I feel that the creators made some fast make-ups at the end, which left me disappointed.
Nice drawing quality and the English dubbing was great for an anime.
I personally didn't enjoy paying so much for it but if you enjoy espionage, adventure, confusing plots, magic and multicultural and magical themes, you'll enjoy this.",1242604800,5,666,5.352380952380952
8306970,4,B001GT9DQ6,"I fell in love with this series from just the intro animation.  Gorgeous animation, with a strange, twisted revenge mystery tale that's a little historical but all intriguing.  For anyone interested in the time period, I would recommend giving this a go.  There are parts in France, Russia, and England, so you get a little snapshot at the time from those countries.

Le Chevalier d'Eon is set in pre-revolutionary France and is based off of an actual French spy for King Louis XV, d'Eon de Beaumont.  He is involved in solving the mystery of the death of his sister, Lia, sending him from one end of Europe to the other, dealing with secret societies, the living dead, and dealing with the soul of his vengeful sister, who resided inside of him after her death in order to kill whoever was responsible for her death.

The series will have you hooked in the first episode (what better way to start than with a mysterious coffin?) and the mystery is built up so carefully that you expect the ending to be just as spectacular as the rest of the series.  But when I got to the last DVD, I was let down.  The ending was very rushed, and new information was thrown at me so quickly, I was in a whirlwind by the end, wondering what happened.  What would have been a wonderful series ends up falling flat in the end.  And unfortunately, the ending of a series means much more than the rest, a build up without answered questions.  It was a series that had major potential, but it just didn't get there.",1241136000,10,1495,4.459558823529412
