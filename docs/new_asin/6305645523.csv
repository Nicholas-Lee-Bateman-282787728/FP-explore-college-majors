1054763,4,6305645523,I love these movies for the family aspect as well as the old style feel. It's more like a police drama from the 80's and I really enjoyed those. Charles Bronson is still the ultimate good guy and love seeing Joe Penney again from the 80's in the second and third installment of this series. Sebastian Spence is adorable and as wonderful as ever.,1255910400,,345,4.40625
1054764,5,6305645523,"This is Charles Bronson as we know him.  One of the good, tough guys.  It is like the Death Wishes"" only he has family of policemen and a smart lawyer daughter  There is also the youngest daughter who does what she wants.  She didn't get to know her mother and blames herself for her mother's death but Charles is the loving father and turns her around.

I didn't get the first one of Family Cops but this one I do recommend.  Charles Bronson at his best.",1225065600,2,455,4.232558139534884
1054765,5,6305645523,"Anyone that has any sense whatsoever, knows that a Bronson tv movie action film isn't going to have too much on plot. He made these ""Family of Cops"" films as entertainment, not as a thinking man's drama or a serious action picture. His performance in this one is top notch though. If you want to see Charlie at his best watch ""Once Upon A Time In The West"" but, in the meantime meet the ""Family of Cops"" and Paul Fein played by Charles Bronson.",1194912000,8,444,4.2976190476190474
1054766,2,6305645523,"I was in this movie as an extra while working for the Milwaukee Police Department, so was a friend of mine. As most know it was filmed in Milwaukee and in Toronto. It was a lot of fun and I made $110.00 dollars for the day.

During that day I broke up an actual fight between two crew memebers. If I recall, I believe it was between the vehicle rangler and stuntman.

In one scene Charles Bronson was to drive around the access road of the Milwaukee County Courthouse in an unmarked squad car and pull up at the front door. He had to then exit the vehicle and walk into the court house with a purpose. It had to be shot several times. I recall that after the first take he would have to back the squad car back around the access road to the starting mark. During that process he hit the curb several times while backing and voiced his discussed with several explitives...

What a great day!

I later saw the movie and thought it was not the greatest, but if your a Bronson fan its a must to see...at least once.",1154131200,4,1011,4.1692307692307695
1054767,3,6305645523,"This is the only ""Family Of Cops"" movie you really need. I wonder if the sequels were planned at this point, because the performances seem to have more juice here. The action scenes are pretty good, especially the one in the woods. Bronson's involved in a couple of shoot-outs, but they're practically identical to similar scenes in the other two movies. (-Notice in particular the shoot-out by his character's house; arms stretched out in trademark ""Telefon"" aiming position, shooting at a car.) Forget about the two uninvolving ones that followed, and stick with this one.",995414400,18,574,5.052631578947368
1054768,3,6305645523,"This Bronson film was ok, not his best work though, rent one of the Death Wish movies to see Bronson at his best. I used to Enjoy Bronson films quite a bit, but he needs to stop. The man is way to old, and its hard to believe  that a man his age, would be running around shooting people. He Belongs in  a wheel chair and a nursing home, not making movies anymore, sorry Mr.  Bronson its time to Retire. Watch the movie if you absolutely love Charles  Bronson!",965001600,4,459,4.123595505617978

1054866,4,6305645523,"Family of Cops (1995-tvm). Running Time: One Hour, 30 mins.
Directed by Ted Kotcheff. Written by Joel Blasberg.
First tv-movie in the series.

Ben Fein (Daniel Baldwin) meets with his father Paul Fein (Charles Bronson) at a restaurant bar. Ben starts talking about the blond woman also sitting at the bar. Four tough guys come into the restaurant acting-up. Paul walks over to the gang and gives Tommy (Richard Zeppieri) a warrant.
 Paul Fein is the Inspector and most of his grown children are also in law enforcement. Some are cops and one is a public defender.
  Tommy purposely bumps his head into Paul's chest. Ben grabs a hold of Tommy. The three tough guys pull their guns out. Just then, the blond woman pulls out her gun at the men and says ""Police!"". Tommy tells Ben ""...why don't you be a smart Jew boy""?  Paul hits Tommy across the face and throws him at the table. Then Tommy is arrested and put in the police car.
  It's not over yet, there is more to happen this week.
