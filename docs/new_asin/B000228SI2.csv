8020480,2,B000228SI2,"Demon Summer (Luke and Andrew Campbell, 2003)

After the exceptionally pleasant, and gruesome, surprise that was Midnight Skater, I figured I'd give the Campbell brothers' best-known film, Demon Summer, a shot. I was expecting bad no-budget horror, of course, having been exposed to Campbell flicks previously, but even so, the film surpassed my expectations-- and I don't mean that in a positive way. I didn't hate it as much as the IMDB crowd seem to have, but Midnight Skater this isn't.

In fact, it seems almost as if they looked at Midnight Skater and tried to do everything exactly the opposite. Where the previous film was over the top in every respect, Demon Summer almost seems restrained in everything but the gore (and even that is toned way, way down). The intentional humor is absent, let alone the unintentional humor, and no-budget mayhem does not good straight horror films make. (Judging by my recent horror film viewing, this is a lesson that a whole lot of indie horror directors need to learn, so no points off to the Campbells for it.) The story is straightforward and just keeps going, unlike the surprising complexity (and willingness to veer off into any sort of useless tangent at the drop of a hat) of Midnight Skater-- the most impressive thing about that movie, in my estimation.

I was about to write ""were this a big Hollywood production, I'd say the filmmakers were trying to churn out another movie to capitalize on their first unexpected hit."" Then I realized that Hollywood has nothing to do with it-- that's exactly what this feels like. I still give the Campbells a lot of respect for throwing caution (and sense) to the wind and mortgaging their souls to make cheap horror films, and I hope someday another movie as good as, or better than, Midnight Skater pops out of Speed Freak Productions. This, however, isn't it. **",1176336000,,1859,4.803125

They just finished up another great horror flick in ""The Red Skulls,"" which doesn't have a national distributor yet, but you can purchase from their website. Also they are in post-production on ""Cordoba Nights,"" which is a comedy/drama in the vein of ""Repo Man."" Thanks for reading. Sorry about the bogus teaser.",1133827200,2,461,4.703703703703703
8020482,5,B000228SI2,"The low budget horror genere is fill with horrible cookie cutter pictures that are pretty much good only because they are bad....Demon Summer is good for more reasons than that.  The story might seem old, the camera work might not seem all that spectacular but the entertainment and laugh factor is very very high.  Most people think of a horror movie as all screams.  But any true horror fan knows that some of the best horror comes with tons of laughs, the more campy, the more funny, the more gorey, the better.  This film provides and then some.",1116979200,3,549,4.571428571428571
8020483,2,B000228SI2,"The gore was the ONLY reason i gave this 2 stars. The acting sucked, very very low budget filming. It's like it was done with JoBlows video camera. Take some good advice and stay away from this terrible home-made movie. Trust me, i have probably seen amost every horror movie ever made since 1970, and with the exception of Zombie Island, this has got to be one of the worste i have seen.",1116028800,,388,4.328767123287672
8020484,5,B000228SI2,"this is an excellent feature from the speedfreakproductions crew! i wasn't planning on writing a review for this movie until i saw the filth in the previous review for it. this movie has a great story line, creative shots and gore and plenty of comic relief. this movie flies straight over the heads of anyone who gives it a bad review. it is low-budget horror, i mean what did you expect?! go back to your cookie-cutter regurgitated hollywood crap if you don't like this and quit complaining. i am not quite sure what the bad reviewers expected. maybe if SFP would have put in some more explosions, car chases, nudity and Ben Affleck they would have liked it more. anyways enough of my rants, this is a great movie and a must have for any fan of indie movies or aspiring filmmakers.",1095897600,8,783,4.52112676056338
8020485,2,B000228SI2,"I believe the genesis of this movie went something like this,""Hey Mom! Can Andy and I borrow the video camera? We want to make a monster movie"" And with the help of the local high school drama class, that's exactly what they did. Very poorly, I might add. I'd like to see one more copy of this movie sold and that's the one I'll be offering up for sale. The one bright spot is the fairly decent demon, slash 'em up effects other than that don't bother. Sorry guys, but I call 'em as I see 'em.",1095379200,2,493,4.092783505154639
