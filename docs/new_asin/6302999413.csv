530078,5,6302999413,This was one of the best rumbles in history from the beging of owen trading on his brother. To the match for the intercontinental title it was IRS against the bad guy razor ramone IRS stolled razors gold on a earlly raw the two battled but then shawn michals came out and tried to screw razor out of the title. Till one of the revs came out and explaned what had happined and then they awared razor the victory. My favorite match of all time was next it was the casket match between the phenom the undertaker and yokozuna. Yokozuna pulled out all the stops to make sure that he didn't lose his wwf title. From salt in the eyes to fugi's froce but the undertaker kep comeing back till they finally discoverd that the undertaker urn was giving him all the power. Then they opened it and green smoke stared to come out then the undertaker stared to get weak intill he was almost lifeless.  They rolled him into the casket and awared yokozuna the vicktory even though he really didn't do any thing acep give oders but the undertaker wasn't vinshed on the tittentron the undertaker appered he was in the casket.  Saying that he won't rip  the shap of the undertaker rose to the top of the screen till it got to the top undertaker was on the top of the tittentron every body in the arina was shocked and had a chill up their spine. It was now time for the royal rumble match the first person to enter the ring was scott stiener. Then kobokey then rick stiener scotts brother they helped each other out in the first minutes untill rick was elimenated. There were a lot of guys in this match but the person who was in for the longest was disel(also none as kevin nash) elimenatted almost everbody till getting elimenatted by a group of pepole. The two last pepole were bret hart and lex luger they bouth fought till they bouth went out of the ring later on after the rumble was finshed two of the refs were fighting over whos feet touched first then the annocer said that they bouth were the winner.,1104710400,,1991,4.346774193548387
530079,3,6302999413,"Koko B. Ware v. The Mountie
This match was Ok, but it basically on the card to put the Mountie over since he had just made his debut in the WWF. *1/2
Barbabian v. Big Bossman
As you all know, the Big Bossman was feuding with the Heenan family around this time because Bobby the Brain Heenan made some comments about the Bossman's mother on WWF Wrestling Challenge. This eventually led to Mr. Perfect getting involved who was the current IC champion. The Big Bossman eventually got his shot at Heenan's right hand man, Mr. Perfect, but before he did he had to go through this man. This match was decent. **1/2.
The Rockers v. Orient Express
EXCELLENT MATCH. THIS HAS TO BE SEEN TO BE APPRECIATED. THESE TWO TEAMS HAVE TREMENDOUS CHEMISTY AND THIS MATCH PROVES IT. ONE OF THE GREATEST OPENING MATCHES IN THE HISTORY OF ROYAL RUMBLES. ****.
Dusty Rhodes and Goldust v. The Million Dollar Man and someone else
I can't remember who The Million Dollar Man's partner was. This was nothing special though. 3/4*
The Royal Rumble Match:
This match was ok. Certainly not one of the best, but it was ok. The Model Rick Martel and Greg The Hammer Valentine put on some impressive performances as well as the Undertaker. But in the end, THE ORANGE GOBLIN, HULK HOEGAN WENT OVER. ***.
The Real Deal: Get this tape for one match. Rockers v. Orient Express. The other matches are OK, but the rumble really bombed. OH YEA, WARRIOR LOST THE TITLE TO SRG. SLAUGHTER DUE TO OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE FROM THE MACHO MAN. THAT MATCH WAS NOTHING SPECIAL EITHER. But like I said earlier, YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY CHECK OUT ROCKERS/ORIENT EXPRESS. You'll be glad you did.

530080,5,6302999413,"The '94 edition of the ""Royal Rumble"" was full of surprises. It saw Owen turn on his brother, Bret. We also saw the burial of The Undertaker as he was attacked by pretty much every heel in the building. We also got the controversial two-way tie ending that resulted in a double main event at ""Wrestlemania X"".
The thirty-man ""Royal Rumble"" match featured such superstars as Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart, ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage, Lex Luger, Crush, The Steiner Brothers, Shawn Michaels, Diesel, Jeff Jarrett, and more. This was one of the best Rumble matches.
This event also saw the return of ""Million Dollar Man"" Ted Dibiase as he took over color commentary duty for the departed Bobby Heenan, who had recently left for WCW. God, I wish the WWE would invest in releasing the Royal Rumble library.",1062288000,,791,4.739130434782608
530081,5,6302999413,Tatanka vs bambam bigelow good fight suprising me. Hart brothers did not get the job done they lost to the Quebecers for the title tag team.razor ramon vs irwin R. schyster should of been a ppv match worst match of the evining.taker vs yokozuna in a casket. Royal rumble 94 was great and everybody was putting a show on at the end it was a tie because lex and bret came out as a tie look at carefully at the end who was the real royal rumble winner.,1025481600,,449,4.113636363636363
7833362,5,6302999413,"I started watching WWF wrestling back in 1993. I was nine and the years have passed by but I still remember moments of 1993 more then any other year. Yokozuna and Lugvig Borga attacking Tatanka so he could not compete at the Survivor Series, Razor Ramon winning the intercontinental belt from Rick Martel, Crush turning on Savage, Owen turning on Bret, among other moments. I loved the Rumble and I still remember most of these moments as if it happened yesterday.

Tatanka VS Bam Bam Bigelow: Awesome opener. One of my favorite wrestlers growing up was Tatanka and he puts on a great effort in this match. A perfect opener.

Quebecers VS Owen and Bret Hart: One of WWF's greatest feuds of all time was Bret VS Owen. Boy, Quebecers had some annoying theme music. A great match and the ending was perfect.

Razor Ramon VS IRS: I loved Razor before he went to hell. Ramon retains in a great match that flowed good.

Undertaker VS Yokozuna in a Casket Match: I remeber Takers promos building up to this match. A decent match the ending of the match sucked. I did love the ending where The Taker speakes and ascends in the heavens.

Rumble: Awesome Rumble with some great talent. Jarrett VS Savage went well and I would have loved to see these two men fight during this era. Luger and Hart co own a great Rumble.

Overall, one of the best Rumbles from top to bottom.",1222387200,,1362,4.493927125506073
7833363,3,6302999413,"1994's Royal Rumble Match was one of the bests ever. It had a decent under card and the casket match was pretty alright, it wasn't really all that bad.

1. Bam Bam Bigelow w/ Luna vs. Tananka
This was a good match. It had reversals and some nice moves. Good opener. 3.5/5

2. WWE Tag Team Title
The Quebeckers vs. Bret & Owen Hart
This match was certainly the longest match on the card besides the Rumble match. The Quebeckers would take some cheap shots to Bret and really just whell on his knee. It did felt like it dragged on at some points. Both Harts pulled off some good ring work movenuevers. Bret had a chance to tag Owen but he didn't and then the ref would call off the match due to Bret's knee injury. The match of course was only here to continue the fued between bret and owen but it was a pretty good match and the conclusion didn't hurt it. 4/5

3. Intercontinental Title
Razor Ramoan vs. IRS
Nice title match up. It was all Razor in the beginning. IRS would soon turn the tables and start wearing down Razor and even cheating a little bit. HBK would interfere with his IC title belt but that would only lead to his match with Razor at wrestlemania x. Good way to set up the casket match and to continue the true IC champ fued. 3/5

4. Casket Match for the WWE Title
Undertaker w/ Paul Bearer vs. Yokozuna w/ Mr. Fugi & Jim Cornette
This match wasn't really all that bad and the hype leading into the match certainly added more to it. Taker and Yoko put on a good fight for about the first 6 or 7 minutes of the match until everybody came out to help Yoko. It had some good action to take place in the ring and on the outside before everybody would come out and just beat on Taker. Taker & Paul Bearer did everything they could to fight them all off. The after match segment would only add more suspense and mystery to the deadman for the upcoming months ahead. 3.5/5

5. Royal Rumble Match
I really enjoyed this rumble. It had some pretty good names to partake in it too.

Diesel was just dominate in the beginning, just throwing people out left and right. Randy Savage would enter and stop all of that and continue his rivalry with Crush who would enter shortly after. The ring never looked too crowded and there was some good action happening all over the ring. Bret Hart was for sure selling his knee injury all the way through. The fans really went nuts when Shawn & Marty had their little showdown in the ring. The final 4 had a good showing and so did the final 2 which had a questionable end but it was a great Rumble, I really felt this was one of the bests. 5/5

I recommend on yall checking this one out whenever yall get a chance too. It had a great Rumble and the casket match wasn't all that bad. Pretty good.",1218672000,,2738,4.213740458015267
7833364,5,6302999413,"This is the event that kicked off what I think is the greatest year the WWF ever had. The Royal Rumble started things off in a big way, as much was at stake. For one thing, there was the uniquely novel storyline involving the ""tension"" between Bret and Owen Hart. The trouble had started the previous year at Survivor Series 1993 when Owen accidentally bumped into Bret during one of the elimination matches, thus causing Owen to become disoriented and rolled up in the process. Owen blamed Bret and even challenged him to ""step up to the plate"" in a match. However, the brothers reconciled over the Christmas holiday and teamed together to face the Quebecers in a Tag Team Title match. Eventually, Bret's bad leg costs he and Owen the match, resulting in Owen getting his feelings of jealousy back for his brother, forcing him to turn on Bret. This would set up their classic WrestleMania X (10) match. Also, Razor Ramon battles I.R.S. for the Intercontinental Championship. Shawn Michaels gets involved, nearly costing ""The Bad Guy"" the title. This was also one of the things that led to their WrestleMania X Ladder Match. Of course, there was also a pretty cool Casket Match for the WWF Title between Champion Yokozuna and The Undertaker. This was the encounter where 'Taker was ambushed by many of the heel WWF Superstars who stuffed him in the casket. Undertaker then does his ascension where he appears from inside the casket on the video wall. After this, 'Taker would not be in another match until SummerSlam of that year. Tatanka battles the late great Bam Bam Bigelow. And, who can forget the classic 30 man Royal Rumble in which both Bret Hart and Lex Luger go over the top rope at the same time. Vince McMahon and Ted Dibiase do commentary, except for the I.C. Title match when Gorilla Monsoon and Jim Ross break in from their Radio WWF broadcast. I absolutely love this Rumble and give it 5 stars. Get it and you will love it.",1179100800,,1939,4.6395348837209305

Jaunary 22, 1994

Providence Civic Center

Providence, Rhode Island

Tatanka V. Bam Bam Bigelow

good opener actually that got the Providence crowd going. Tatanka wins. **3/4...Jesus spelling Tatanka is like spelling Canada...there is an ""a"" after every letter. Maybe Tatanka is Canadian

WWF Tag Team Championship:

Quebecers (Champions) V. Bret Hart & Owen Harr

Speaking of Canadians...awesome match that took the Bret/Owen feud to a different level. Oh, the wrestling wasn't bad either. The Quebecers win after Bret can't continue. ****

WWF Interocntinental Championship:

Razor Ramon (Champion) V. IRS

good match that had an awesome ending. Razor retains. ***

Casket Match for the WWF Championship:

Yokozuna (Champion) V. Undertaker

I thought the WWF Championship match was suppose to be the match of the night...well...this was the worst match of the night. Why?..Well because Yoko's matches always suck and Undie wasn't the performer he is today and he was injuried. Yoko wins after ten men interfere. *

Royal Rumble Match:

Awesome rumble that had 29 people in it, not 30. What Vince couldn't find one more person to enter? Anyways...who do you think won the match. I think Bret won because of one simple fact...Luger sucks! and Luger is taller than Bret, so..you would think the taller person's feet would touch first. It's common sense people. ****

overall a good show that had a hot opener, two hot championship matches, a horrible WWF Championship match, and a very good rumble.",1138924800,,1516,5.198347107438017
7833366,3,6302999413,"This was an average event with only a couple of memorable moments (most memorable comes from the Royal Rumble match). There have been better Rumble events than this one. I would really recommend for any fan of collecting Royal Rumbles to purchase this for the ending of the Royal Rumble match. Here were the matches.

1. Tatanka vs. Bam Bam Bigalow 6/10

A really weak opener. Most of the match was when Bam Bam had Tatanka in a bear hug and any other action included Tatanka getting beat up. Towards the end, Bam Bam was stupid because he went to the top rope and did a back flip trying to hit Tatanka and missed. Then Tatanka got up went to the top rope and hit Bam Bam, and Bam Bam was already hurt so this enabled Tatanka to get the victory. Tatanka got real lucky.

2. The Quebecers (Pierre and Jacques) vs. Bret Hart and Owen Hart 9/10

This was an awesome match. A great comeback after the previous bad match. There were a lot of good moves here (especially from the Hart Brothers). The Hart brothers were in control basically most of the match until the Quebecers manager, Johnny Polo pulled the rope down and Bret went over and hurt his leg. The Quebecers saw this and then started hitting his leg real bad with chairs sticks, etc. The weird thing is that the referee never saw this occur. The ending sucks when the referee had to end/stop/no contest the match because Bret Hart could not continue. Owen after the match felt really distgruntled and hurt Bret's leg even more.

3. I.R.S. vs. Razor Ramon 8/10

This was another pretty good match that had a controversal ending. It began witha regular fight and then I.R.S. started to get in control. All of sudden, the ref got knocked out. I.R.S. then tried to hit Razor with his briefcase, but then he reversed it and I.R.S. got hit. Razor went for the pin but there was no ref. Shawn Michaels also came in to interfere. I think that is what planted seeds for their Ladder match at WrestleMania 10. Anyway, I.R.S. then hit Razor with the I-C belt and the ref got up an counted to 3. I thought I.R.S. was the new champ, but another ref came and said no and the match continued. Razor did the Razor's Edge and got the three. Razor gets the victory and retains the two I-C belts.

4. Yokozuna vs. The Undertaker (Casket Match) 10/10

This was another good match. Every entertaining to see Yokozuna get beat up by the ""Deadman"". All was going well until like 9 people came to help Yokozuna (Crush, The Great Kabuki, Tenryu, Bam Bam Bigalow, Adam Bomb, Jeff Jarrett, Fatu, Samu, and Diesel all got involved to get The Undertake in the casket). This was sort of suprising which is why it got 10/10. The Undertaker got mugged most of the match. Then they finally put him in the casket and Yokozuna won. This was basically a 1 against 10 Handicap Casket Match. At the end of the match some weird stuff happened that was sort of pointless (The Undertaker started talking from the inside of the casket). Good match.

5. The Royal Rumble Match 10/10

This will go down in history as the most controversal Royal Rumble in history (I'll explain later why). In this match Scott Steiner and Samu started this match, and people came in and people came out, but then Diesel came. When Diesel came he started to clean house, he eliminated superstars such as Bart Gunn, Scott Steiner, Owen Hart, and Kwang. The ring was clear until superstars such as Bob Backlund, Billy Gunn, and Virgil came in, but they were all tossed out like in a couple of seconds. After that the ring started to fill up all the way to the end of the match. Only one superstar named Bastion Booger (number 25) did not come or show up into the Royal Rumble. At the end Bret and Lex were the final two, they started throwing punches and then Lex scooped up Bret and they fell back. After this they both fell over the top rope, and from my point of view they both hit the floor simultaneously. When this happenned they both went back in the ring, and they announced Lex Luger won. His music played but then they said the winner was Bret hart, and then his music played, then it stopped. The people out there kept on discussing their thoughts and then Howard Finkel was going to say who won, but then stopped and then went back and started talking. He announced both Lex Luger and Bret Hart won the Royal Rumble and they played that Royal Rumble music. This was a classic moment. I personally do not know who really won which is why this ending was so controversal. This was sort of like this years 2005 Royal Rumble when Batista and John Cena fell out at the same time, but then did a restarted Rumble and Batista won. If you want to watch some Rumbles similar to this one, watch the 1995, 1997, 1999, and the 2005 Royal Rumbles.",1111708800,2,4738,4.416953035509737
