1518833,5,B00005JNDZ,"I laughed my butt off during this movie. I looked forward to it--and it was well worth the wait! Colin Firth is absolutely charming, I'm such a fan now. Hugh is as cheeky as ever, and it's good to see Bridget have a nice balance between depression and glee. She really is a lot more chipper in this movie and it's infectious! I'm seeing it AGAIN tomorrow!",1100217600,5,355,4.313432835820896
1518834,4,B00005JNDZ,"I am a huge fan of everything Bridget Jones. I've read the books and love the movie. So imagine how elated I was when I discovered that a sequel film was in the making!

Today, ""Bridget Jones's Diary: The Edge of Reason"" opened in Portland, and of course, I was there to see it.

Bridget has definitely grown up a bit [...]. However, the film is consistent in Bridget's awkward moments and physical humor. But this film deals more with what happens when we finally get the relationship we've dreamed of.

Mark Dary (Firth) is the perfect boyfriend. But what happens when the honeymoon is over? The workaholic lawyer spends more time at work and with sexy Rebecca, leaving Bridget out in the rain (literally!). Bridget's fears get the best of her, and to make a long story short, gets stuck in a Thai prison...

The cinematography is consistent with the predecessor, and it is ofen enjoyable to hear Bridget's inner dialogue. I felt that the acting was actually significantly better than the last, too, especially considering the improvement of Renee Zellweger's British accent. And props to her for gaining weight to fill the role!

Overall, this romantic comedy was touching as well as funny. I give it four stars and recommend it to any Bridget fans!",1100217600,3,1252,4.751152073732719
1518835,4,B00005JNDZ,"I considered this movie to be a worthy follow-up to the first one. Its a very charming and undemanding movie where Bridget tries to take her relationship with Mark Darcy to the next level. The sequel proves to be just as laid back as the first movie and I enjoyed the comic talents of all three stars involves, Renee Zellweger, Colin Firth and Hugh Grant. Yes, Grant as back in his usual role from the first movie, trying to ""change"" but remaining the same wormy self.

There are some uneven spots along the way which may distract from the overall story. A good example of this would be the subplot of Bridget's friend and her involvment with a younger man which get Bridget thrown in Thai prison where she bonded with all these Thai women who really had bad relationships; making Bridget realized how lucky she was with Mark. The entire scene, charming as it is, was bit off tangent from the general tone of the movie.

Zellweger managed to master her English accent pretty well this time around and her perky demeanor and high spirit carried the movie pretty well. Her skills as an actress also improved as well. Both Firth and Grant provided very good support as well. Firth had more screen time then Grant this time around and Bridget's ""friends and family"" also got less screen time as movie worked around the relationship between Bridget and Mark. A good all around comedy that I thought to be pretty entertaining and enjoyable to watch.",1100217600,7,1443,4.6328125
1518836,5,B00005JNDZ,"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason

This is no average romantic comedy. Strap yourself in for the riotous laughter that ensues in this comedy featuring the ever-talented Renee Zelleweger. Friends and enemies, old and new, throw in some truly unexpected twists and turns in this sequel to the extremely successful Bridget Jones' Diary. Watching the film is like catching up with an old friend. Scenes are put together like little vignettes drawn from her now infamous diary (which only makes one appearance in the film strangely enough). The filmmakers expect that you have seen the first one and are delivering fans all the Bridget they can handle. Viewers of the first film will feel as if they are on all the ""in"" jokes... as they play up all of Bridget's endearing neuroses... from her ""appalling bad public speaking"" to her relationship with the ""scary stomach holding-in panties popular with grannies the world over"".

Colin Firth (Mark Darcy) is totally off the ""hot"" charts in playing the leading man. He lets it all hang out personality-wise and romantically in the Edge of Reason. If you're not swooning over him already, this film will certainly put you over the edge! And Mr. Cleaver (Hugh Grant) does not disappoint as the boyish cad that we all hate to love, or is it love to hate?

The movie bets on its female fans having had a relationship with their own ""Daniel Cleaver"" and the scenes between Daniel and Bridget will make you squirm in your seat. Watching this movie is like being at a pajama party! You will laugh, squirm, yell and be driven to the edge of your seat and feel good doing it because so will everyone else in the theater. The movie is not so much about trials and tribulations of single-hood, it is about the pitfalls of the relationship decisions we make and how we can bond as women because of them. And this experience is reflected in the audience it brings together.

Women bond with Bridget because they know what she is going through and fans will continue to enjoy that relationship with the new movie. That's half of what makes the scenes so downright hilarious (the other half is Zelleweger's comedic talent). As for the guys, don't worry, there's a scene at the end that will make it all worthwhile for them.

What is lackluster about the film is that it is not as structured as the first, and Zelleweger starts it off a little weakly with a fuzzy accent in the beginning. Some fans might find that the smarminess subtracts from the experience and there is too much unfortunate mimicking of the original that came off a little forced. You won't really notice the relative lack of scene set up in this one because you will be too busy laughing and the filmmakers continue with some beautiful scenery and an excellent soundtrack.

This movie has a hard time being at all serious but don't we all need a laugh (or two or three hundred) these days? The Edge of Reason is a must see for any true Bridget fan; it does not disappoint. It will take you to the edge of your seat and make you laugh like no other film this year. 4  stars.",1100217600,2,3070,4.591240875912408
1518837,4,B00005JNDZ,"I'm from the UK, hence I have seen the film prior to the US release date.

The criticism I have seen of this film is that it doesn't follow the book closely enough.  Maybe not, but its a charming, funny and very sweet movie.  All the characters you love are back, the 2 boyfriends, her family and her friends (though I still feel the friends should get more airtime).

There are many cringeworthy moments, never better than when she gets arrested (I won't give anything away) and the film doesn't let up.  I literally giggled and belly laughed from start to finish.  There are many 'moments' - the Thai 'Like A Virgin' prison scene for exmaple is hilarious. The acting is excellent, and the best performance without a doubt is from Hugh Grants caddish character! Brilliantly wicked.

My criticism of the first Bridget Jones, was that it was so 'twee', it portrayed the Uk in that postcard perfect image, which it certainly isn't (eg: London looking beautiful during the Christmas snowfall - the reality is black slush and hardly any snow at Christmas anyway!), and whilst there are a couple of moments like that this time round, its not so prevalent. (But thats a small gripe).

A very funny, heartfelt and sweet movie, and I think an excellent sequel, irrespective of how close to the book it is.",1100217600,5,1297,4.657894736842105
1518838,5,B00005JNDZ,"i saw this movie at a sneak preview.  there was a line out the door an hour before the movie started.  i really enjoyed it.  it seemed as if the entire audience did.  it was very funny (embarrassing if you are Bridget).  It has all the same elements and people from the first movie.  If you enjoyed the first movie you will certainly enjoy this one.  I hate to say anymore and give away the movie, but it is safe to say if you are a Colin Firth fan, as I am, you will absolutely love this.",1099526400,8,489,3.979381443298969
1518839,3,B00005JNDZ,"If you read the book Bridget Jones' Diary you might be disappointed by the movie. The book focuses more on her relationships with her friends, who are all wildly amusing and lovable characters. I was disappointed to not see more of those characters adpapted into the screen version.",1099008000,,282,4.895833333333333
1518840,3,B00005JNDZ,"So many sequels, so little time. Should you spend some of that time with this sequel to the popular and funny Bridget Jones' Diary? If you have a taste for the light and frothy, certainly.  If we were discussing the book, The Edge of Reason, I would say ""no""--- there are far better books, and better sequels, out there. But this is that rare case where the second book was rushed out to capitalize on the wild popularity of the first, and disappointing----- while this movie, not so rushed, is only casually based on and certainly better than the book.

Although neither book nor movie quite live up to the first, fans of the first movie will be well entertained by the second. And I, for one, am immensely glad that at least one horribly painful scene in the book is not even hinted at in the movie: Mr. Darcy keeps most of his dignity intact.

Can you enjoy this movie without seeing the first Diary? Yes, you learn enough of the characters early that this movie can stand on its own. However, I would bet that if you even smile during this one, you will want to rent or buy the first. You'll laugh out loud.

Especially if you love Colin Firth and Hugh Grant, as I do, this sequel is time well spent. I can't spell out why Colin Firth is so attractive, but there it is: he is. He is a much greater presence in this movie than the first--- after all, he (as ""Mark Darcy"") and Bridget have a real relationship as the movie opens. Of course they ---uhmm--- ""mess"" it up (""language, Bridget!"") with misunderstandings, jealousies, and very funny mishaps. I am not a huge fan of humor based on one character's running the continuum from private embarrassment to public humiliation; yet Bridget, who constantly manages to embarrass herself and others in public, is such a good sport and so charming as Everygirl, that we laugh or groan with her in recognition of those moments in ourselves, and not at her. There are some great laughs in this movie.

Some of them come with Hugh Grant, who seems to have lost the weight that Renee Zellweger gained. Too thin but still devilishly attractive, Hugh's rakish character Daniel Cleaver hangs around to take advantage of the misunderstandings between Bridget and Mark Darcy-- even if he has to ""hang around"" Thailand to do it. Cad that he is, when Bridget really becomes a damsel in distress, he evaporates into thin air. That's all right. We know there will be some rough times in between, but surely Mark Darcy, human rights lawyer, will come cantering in on a white horse to save Bridget from Thai prison, right? Not quite. But with a few comic kinks, close enough.

I don't expect Renee Zellweger to receive another Oscar nomination for this one. She is fun, she is appealing, and she is good, but this is not the script for it. I've heard the British objections to her inconsistent, not to say hokey, accent, and while they have some merit here, I do applaud her for bravely diving into Everygirl-dom, a little overweight, a little embarrassed and embarrassing, but with self-awareness enough to make her a cult favorite of all of us ""Singletons"". She's effervescent, and she's resilient. Gotta love her.

If the movie was shot on location, it largely lost the advantage of it in Thailand, but that is a mere quibble. A stronger criticism: the first movie's soundtrack was marvelously energetic and witty--- who could forget ""It's Raining Men""? This one, however, tries too hard: too many oldies which are favorites because they are very good songs,  but which have been used in too many soundtracks. Even slightly new arrangements don't imbue them with the freshness the movie deserved. However, the costumer showed some wit in this episode, as well as  underscoring some of the broader humor.

Not serious, not deep, not an exercise for the intellect, ""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason"" is enjoyable and bubbly, and a darned good time. B--",1099008000,145,3887,4.669590643274854

1518995,4,B00005JNDZ,"Everyone who loves Bridget has to revisit the entire series, especially if it's been awhile. This middle child of the trilogy (after the Diary and before the Baby) will remind you once again (he's already married and divorced twice by this one, and none of these are to B) of B's limited husband options by her mid 30s. Although I'm a big Colin Firth fan, his Darcy does seem so ill-suited to B; and Hugh Grant is just as vile as ever (talking about ""pervy"" pictures and scenarios constantly). The latter is likely your next Tinder date.
Cringeworthy ethnic-stereotyping moments in Thailand show that the bar was lower in this one. The male fighting, though, is entertaining. When the 4th comes out (which was the 3rd in the novels), I can't imagine how she'll handle it all, or how we will, for that matter.",1507593600,,808,4.618055555555555

1519119,5,B00005JNDZ,"Uh oh, it couldn't be that our girl, Bridget Jones (Rene Zellweger), the 'Queen of Singledom' is in a dilemma over the two adversaries for her heart just when things are looking... stable. Good old Bridget, the one we always know will get by taking the knocks through thick or thin and surviving with or without a broken heart, yep, good ole' Bridget. Who will she finally choose, once more, to be the captain of her heart: the sneakily clever and infatuated Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) 'or' her chiseled-jawed human rights lawyer and steadfast Mark Darcy (Colin Firth)? Can Bridget ever be sure? Or will she always be on the lookout for these two to up and change on her just as she forms an opinion? One of these two has got to reach a solid opinion about her as we blaze the Daniel, Mark, Daniel, Mark open trail again for this sequel to ""Bridget Jones's Diary"": a fabulous film taken directly from the newspaper column run in daily British papers and made into a series of books then movies. This time our girl is working at a new job has a steady man and is trying her hardest to fit in until she finds out that she may have a rival for her boyfriend's attention. After she feels totally ignored at the Lord Chancellor's Dinner with Mark, she decides to cut him loose and stride away in her gold gown as there are just too many problems anymore.

Her boss at the news channel decides that she would make a great co-guide on the, just so happens to be, travel show with the tour guide, Daniel Cleaver. It is a promotion after all. But, what is a girl to do when tropical Thailand is knocking on your door and you must travel with your nemesis, well, maybe that is way too harsh concerning it is Daniel after all and they do have the past, but does she still really love Mark? It is all so undecided until she gets tossed in jail for smuggling of which she is totally unaware of. At least our Bridget is never alone and starts her own sort of club with all of the Thai women in there too. Oh, what is Bridget to do when her legal advisor tells her she is in a ""sticky wicket""...Whatever that means. Don't worry though, we are talking about Bridget Jones and her capacity for survival is better than most. A truly fun and cheeky movie and another endearing romp with all of the characters we have come to love from the first ""Bridget Jones"" film...",1499644800,2,2350,4.353075170842825

It felt as if they tried to cash in on the popularity of the first without adding a lot more character development.

1519898,3,B00005JNDZ,"I was a bit surprised by this movie. I didn't exactly expect Edge Of Reason to be better than its predecessor, but I certainly expected to like it much more than I actually did. I thought we'd see a genuine growth in Bridget Jones, but it was a bit disheartening to see her make the same mistakes again, as she had done in the first movie. But despite all that, I think the biggest blunder this movie made was to, at one point, copy the same idea from another movie - Brokedown Palace. In fact, the biggest part of the movie was so similar to Brokedown Palace, I was left comparing both movies, scene by scene. In Brokedown Palace, two friends visit Thailand for some post-graduation fun and meet a charming man on their journey for whom they both become enamoured with. Fast forward to the day they return home, they're stopped by airport security due to an anonymous tip off that they were smuggling drugs back to the States. After searching their bags, security finds a huge amount of drugs, possibly slipped into their bags by the charming man they'd met. The two girls are then locked up in a Thai women's prison and are left to rely on an American attorney to sort out their situation and help set them free. Similar situation with Bridget. In the movie, she and her friend, Shazza, travel to Thailand and are quite enjoying their time (this is where Bridget almost makes another huge mistake that she should have learned from in the first movie). On the day of their departure from Thailand, Bridget ends up offering to pack a souvenir of Shazza's, given to her by a ""friend"" she met on their trip. Lo and behold, Bridget is stopped by airport security and searched. When they find the souvenir, they destroy it to reveal that there were drugs within the souvenir. She is then locked up in a Thai women's prison (albeit, a nicer prison than the one we see in Brokedown Palace) and has to rely on Mark's sympathy to save her. One thing I do like though is that she learns something in the prison - that she took Mark and their relationship too much for granted, and her little worries and complaints about things Mark did or still does really isn't anything to complain about at all.

Altogether, I still liked the movie, although not as much as the first one, and currently have this one in my collection. And while I don't think there needs to be a third movie, I will still go out and see it, as Edge Of Reason has not turned me off of the Bridget Jones phenom one bit.",1463702400,,2478,4.422319474835886

1519971,2,B00005JNDZ,"Ok. I bought this because I recently saw the first film, Im obsessed with movies, and my already enormous collection apparently needed another lame romantic comedy. Plus, I adore Colin Firth. BUT - this movie is so unrealistic in every single way. A fat, greasy, makeup-less, clumsy, obnoxious smoker somehow lands two of the hottest and most successful men in the city? NO. Not going to happen in real life. The series was clearly written for women who don't want to work out or put themselves together. It was written for delusional women who think their problems make them look cute, because thats how it was written for Bridget. Bridget isn't real! If a woman acted like this in real life, she would be considered psychotic and end up forever alone. I saw a lot of reviews all over the internet that praised Jones's character, and now that Ive seen it all for myself Im unsure as to why. So.. as a young woman, I thought it'd be nice to speak some truth: No sane human thinks how Bridget thinks. I was so embarrassed watching Renee Zellweger play this role. She did pretty well in the first film, but this was so horrifying to witness. Don't get me wrong, its very entertaining, but she just looked so awful. The bright red cheeks, the chest acne, walking like she had a stick in her butt, and acting clingy and obsessive with her boyfriend. I read the first book as well, and it was crazy. If I could sum up Bridget Jones with two words, Id use fat and h*rny. Also, Bridget is the type of girl who always thinks she's pregnant and makes a big scene about it every time. We all have a friend like that...don't we, ladies? Any who, this movie is cheap, so if you're wanting to buy it, go ahead! Its something you can watch on a rainy day. Just don't believe a single word that Mark Darcy says to Bridget Jones, because in real life, he'd absolutely be dating Rebecca Gillies.",1456099200,,1878,4.446376811594203
1519972,2,B00005JNDZ,"Next time I decide that I want to watch this... someone please remind me not to.  I didn't like the second book, first of all, it was weird and... well, weird. I like the second film even less.  For someone who knew what he was getting into, Darcy still seems to be so shocked by the way his girlfriend acts.  Bridget has yet to learn any common sense.  The whole drug incident I thought was stupid in the book, made even stupider by the film.  How is it that Bridget is completely aware of what happened between Daniel and Mark's former wife (before she was a former), not to mention how he treated her in the past, but she is still shocked by what a jerk he is? How did she not learn that lesson already?
Then there's the fact that Daniel just goes on filming his TV show while Bridget is in a Thai prison? Wouldn't the company that they both work for be a bit more concerned that one of the stars of their big Travel show was just arrested for drug possession while on a business trip?  I'm sure I'll go see the upcoming third film (won't even try the book) and cross my fingers that it's better than this.",1455580800,,1109,4.183098591549296

1520058,1,B00005JNDZ,"One of the worst movies EVER. So disappointed and basically angry because Bridget Jones Diary is one of my favorite movies. They did everything possible wrong with this one. They made Renee so ridiculously fat and unattractive for this and took away all her innocence, replacing it with a pseudo-amusing veneer that never works. There is no longer any chemistry between Darcy & Bridget and very little between Daniel & Bridget. Everything is forced. They try to repeat everything that worked in the first movie and it flops big-time. Nothing feels fresh. There is not one funny moment. Things happen such as Bridget flopping around on skis and careening down hills and there's even an almost identical fight scene between Mark and Daniel, substituting a fountain for the street. So strained and ultimately pathetic. I haven't checked but I can't imagine it's the same screenwriter and director as the first and therefore it's a real travesty to take the original superb cast and make them dredge through this awful thing. Maybe that's why there's no romance or laughter-- because the actors all knew they were dealing with a bomb from the word go.",1437523200,,1147,4.948186528497409

Things have been going swimmingly lately for Bridget and attorney Mark Darcy, but her insecurities get the best of her...and then smarmy Daniel Cleaver comes onto the scene again, giving Bridget the impression that he's a changed man, but he's still as rakish as ever. The vacation scenes were too funny, I personally loved that one in which Bridget is trying to buy a pregnancy test but isn't asking for it in the right language...""Frau girl, meets frau boy, and frau girl mitt baby?"" LOL!! The whole thing where Bridget is getting romanced off her feet in Thailand by duplicitous Daniel and Bangkok is the city of call girls...then Bridget has had the misfortune of a cocaine stash planted on her and ends up in an international prison...all those Thai girls trying to sing Madonna and all ROTFL...I know I have a Bridget kind of moment when I find myself looking into my closet and saying to myself, ""I cawn't wear that""..she is a legendary icon with all the typical neuroses of an American girl searching for love and trying to get her act together. Her beau, Mark, is the one to fight it out for her again...and so most thirty-something single women can agree that the train of love hasn't left the station...There was a lesson here I think, and it's that your true love is never the kind of guy like Hugh Grant's character...they're not the smooth characters who make the biggest bucks and call all the shots. This is the movie in which Bridget finally may be getting that long dreamed of proposal. Well done...didn't exactly out-do the first movie...but enough funny, memorable lines and dialogue mixed in with the unfolding scenarios to make it worth your while to watch, and have a good laugh.",1425168000,,1748,4.772277227722772

Runs into Daniel Cleaver again and has more misadventures.  Mark comes to the rescue.  Easy plot to follow, but seemed a big strained.  Not a great film, but a humorous was to spend a little time.

1520287,2,B00005JNDZ,"I loved Bridget Jones Diary, but could barely stand to watch this sequel.  At first, I could understand Bridget's insecurities, but she became so thoroughly unlikable, I found myself wishing I wasn't watching.  This movie seemed to be undoing all that I enjoyed about the first movie.  In the first movie, I felt for Bridget during the awkward, humiliating moments.  Here, it felt overdone without the spirit of the first movie, and Bridget herself seemed as shallow as Daniel Cleaver much of the time.

There were parts that I did enjoy, particularly around Darcy, but instead of rooting for Bridget like I did in the first, I found myself saying, 'How can he like this awful mess of a woman?'  'He's an idiot for wanting this faithless psycho'.

I do wish I hadn't seen it because it does cause a pall on the first movie.  Knowing this comes after they finally get together, I want to say 'Run Darcy Run!'  I'm going to try to pretend like this never happened so I can just enjoy the first movie whenever I re-watch it.  It's not the worse movie I've ever seen by a long shot, but I do hate how it makes me feel about Bridget when I did enjoy her so much in the original.",1401148800,,1173,4.413953488372093

I had the misfortune of buying a 4 dvd set at Bed Bath and Beyond a couple of years ago -- I mostly wanted the About a Boy dvd that came with it (and was going to swiftly discard the Love, Actually and Notting Hill dvds)-- and I thought I'd hit the jackpot by having BJD thrown in!

1520361,4,B00005JNDZ,"I cannot for the life of me understand why this movie repeatedly gets such low ratings. It's everything it ought to be. It's quirky, ironic, romantic but not the least bit sappy (in comparison to other romcoms), and the top billed cast is just awesome. If people had gone into the experience expecting something else, I could maybe understand why it would disappoint. But The Edge of Reason follows in the campy footsteps of its predecessor. So nothing about it is unexpected or left field. It's exactly what it should be, and it ought to be rated as an extension of the first film.

So I give this movie 4.5 stars because of all the upside factors I listed above, plus there are some golden moments of absolute, tear-inducing hilarity. *POSSIBLE SPOILER: Magic mushrooms and Madonna's ""Like a Virgin."" 'Nough said.* I would give it a five but I can't bring myself to rate it that highly, because it's not like it's flawless.

This is so painfully hilarious to watch this woman that bad things just happen to. I've read they're probably going to make a third movie after the third book. We're in for a tear-jerker.,1384819200,,317,4.781818181818182
1520394,3,B00005JNDZ,"First let me say, I loved the first Bridget Jones' Diary. All the characters in the original movie were just too funny and charming in so many ways. They each held their own. I can't help watching it over and over again laughing at the same things each time. It was very well done.

The problem I have with this second movie is Bridget herself. One of the things I was counting on was for Bridget to be a bit more mature and not finding herself in situations that totally embarrassed her and Mark. You would think she would have developed a bit more sophistication, if for no other reason but to understand that she is now finding herself in Mark's inner circle. I found it very hard to watch most of this movie due to her total idiocy! Not only that, she looks like she is another twenty pounds heavier on top of the weight she had in the first movie. In other words, she looked and acted worse in this movie than the first. I understand some of the situations she found herself in, but seriously I think the producers painted her in such a bad light that it bordered on the rediculous.

The supporting cast did a great job continuing their rolls in this movie, but for the most part it was just one mishap after another one. I was so hoping that this second movie would also develop Bridget and Mark's relationship (courtship) a bit more, for after all, that is what we all want to see. The first movie ended in such a great uplifting way that I would have like to see that carried on to this one, but it seemed to go down hill instead, and not for any particular reason except for misunderstandings by Bridget herself. I'm sure that was, to some extent, the whole purpose of the movie was to have things go so wrong that their love was to be tested. But, really, it was just too much. This movie was sorely lacking in their having a romantic relationship that you would have thought they would have built on after the end of the first movie.

The end was somewhat predicable, but at least it worked. Obviously, there probably won't be a third movie, and that's too bad. There were some laughs in this movie, but for most of it, you had to feel totally embarrassed for Mark. Like I said earlier, I was sadden that  Bridget, herself, looked so bad in this one, that it makes you wonder what on earth Mark sees in her now.",1384128000,,2322,4.306636155606407

I am a big fan of the British comedy genre for because of its witty humour; but I am also a fan of movies with well-acted female leads, and Bridget Jones is a character that many women can relate to.

The only issues I have with the film are: 1) Bridget is repeatedly referred to as fat, when in actuality she is really average size (at least Zellweger's body is) and 2) It would be refreshing to watch a Western film in which Thailand and other Asian countries are not the subject of re-heated stereotypes.  Nevertheless this is a great film for anyone who likes comedy. Watch it.",1357171200,,984,4.6

1520510,3,B00005JNDZ,"I love all of Jane Austen's books and wish she had lived longer and written more.  A lot of people feel the same way and so ""Austen Spinoffs"" are very popular.  However they seldom live up to the originals, expecially when it is a sequal to a spinoff, like THE EDGE OF REASON is a sequel to the spinoff, BRIDGET JONES DIARY.  Some Jane Austen spinoffs REALLY stink, and I have to say that in comparison, THE EDGE OF REASON isn't actually all that bad.  I was mildly entertained for an evening and I got a few laughs.  But it just doesn't do it for me like a ""True Jane"", and by the next day, I was having a hard time remembering exactly what this movie was about.

I don't especially get the populaitry of Bridget Jones, since apart from the bare plot paralells and play on names (like Darcy) the actual sense of the story is far from PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.  Bridget Jones is in no way similar to the intelligent, poised, witty, self possessed Elizabeth Bennett.  In PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, it is easy to see why Darcy falls for our Lizzy, but I keep wondering what he sees in the grasping, silly, promiscuous, annoying and just plain embarassing Bridget!  Both characters are disadvantaged, but Elizabeth Bennett's shortcomings are completely external while Bridget Jones's issues are an ingregal part of her personal core. I suppose the point of the story is that if Bridget can find happiness with Darcy, then all of us everygirls have hope.  But for this kind of plot to interest me, it would have to have something that makes sense about his attraction to Bridget.  Elizabeth Bennett was beneath Darcy's social status, but she was a superior woman and you could see why he loved her - she was his equal in temperment, character and intellegence.  The fact that he was able to recognise her worth,and love her is the main thing that made him attractive as a love interest.  We all want to believe that there is something loveable in us, and a man who sees our finer qualities is dream boat!  But I definately didn't swoon over Bridget's Darcy.  She was beneath him in every possible way and I couldn't connect with them as a couple.  In fact, I found it hard to even respect a guy who could fall for someone like Bridget and the idea her as a heroine was a little depressing.  It just wasn't believable and therefore I didn't really care if they got back together or not.

I also don't get Renee Zellwegger in the title role.  She is sometimes a decent actress, but I didn't find her believable as a Brit, because her accent and mannerisms seemed off.  Since I am an American, perhaps it was my ear that was off, but the whole thing came across so contrived and overdone that it was distracting.  Also, the weight Renee gained for this role looked unnatural on her, and I kept wishing that the lead character was someone who was truly British and naturally plump.  There are plenty of fat girls who are very beautiful because their faces and bodies are meant to be round and soft.  Rene's natural rock-hard fitness just didn't translate well, and instead of coming off as an ordinary overweight girl, she looked hard, ill, and bloated - It reminded me of the ""cockroach man"" in MEN IN BLACK.  Very distasteful.  What in the world would have been so bad about hiring a real, live, pretty, plus sized English actress to play this role?  Was it actually necessary to find a skinny actress and pay her to pack on a bunch of pounds?  I think the message here speaks for itself - ""fat people are undesirable, so when you need an actress to play a fat role, hire a skinny/fit one and have her gain weight.  After all, everyone knows that fat people cannot act!""

I guess this movie is OK for what it is, but certainly nothing I would care to watch again.  Now, excuse me while I cleanse my senses with a dose of Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth in the real PRIDE AND PREJUDICE!",1353369600,2,3866,4.458036984352773

I saw it quite a few years ago and hated it and I thought, ""Maybe I didn't give it a chance.  Let's watch it again to be sure.""

Well, it's as bad as I originally thought; maybe worse.  Actually, I think that it is one of the worst movies in the history of cinema, mostly because it has a decent cast and yet it is still a total stinker.  Bad music, bad acting, worse direction, and horrible writing doomed this dog from the beginning.  Everything seems to be wrong about this film:  the fake British accent by the star; the music; the dialog; etc. etc.  What do the Brits think about this film?  My guess is that they hate it even more than I.

But I did like the first film; I thought that it was funny and entertaining.  But it is the case that most sequels are not as good as the first in the series, and this film keeps up that tradition.  But it does it in such a glaring way that it is appalling.

I just screened and reviewed ""Heartburn"" and I ripped that pretty bad.  But in comparison, I would rather watch that film 10 times over this disaster even once more.  Watch - and cringe - at your own risk.",1346716800,,1286,4.096385542168675

However, in this movie I was almost pulling for Daniel because Mark simply was a snob.  Many female viewers can identify with Bridge and I think that made the movie successful.
The one thing I didn't like was making Bridgett act like Lucille Ball in ""I Love Lucy."" We westerners have had enough of ""Lucy"" and her silly musings.

Also, in Bridgett Jones's Diary, Bridge was a good size and quite beautiful.  In Edge of Reason, she was made to look dumpy, red-faced, no make up and did some of the stupidest things I have ever seen. (climbing on Mark's roof? another classic Lucy thing). The clothes were awful, and non flattering. No wonder Renee paid $2,500 a day for a spa when she got back to LA.

I still loved her.  The acting was superb, lots of emotion, facial expressions were great, I even loved her tears.  Mark was demeaning to Bridge and why in the name of the planet did you want to insert someone like Rebecca Gilless.  She added absolutely nothing to the movie.

1520590,1,B00005JNDZ,"The original ""Bridget Jones Diary"" is one of my favorite recent comedies . . . I can say that even though I'm a guy.  Renee Zellweger, Colin Firth, and Hugh Grant led a stellar ensemble cast that was as committed to pitch-perfect little moments as it was to broad laughs and big romantic scenes.  All in all, the original ""BJD"" is right up there with the most charming of English comedies.

But you know what happens with Hollywood and good ideas - if there's a nickel to be made, then nothing is sacred.

Somehow Zellweger, Firth and Grant let their ""people"" talk them into making this absolutely soulless shell of a sequel.  On the Sequel Scale, with ""Godfather II"" at the top with an easy 10 and ""Caddyshack 2"" a zero, ""Bridget Jones:  The Edge of Reason"" rates about a 1.5.  The concept is stupid - Bridget is still dizzily in love with Darcy (Firth), and he does nothing at all wrong except be just too darn perfect for words.  But we must contrive some conflict, so Bridget concocts stupid sins on his part that even she realizes are stupid, but they are sufficient to create some distance between the two.

Look, in romantic comedies we expect a certain amount of cliche and coincidence - it comes with the territory.  But this sequel just isn't true to Bridget.  She learned in the first movie that Darcy really loved her, and she is a smart enough girl that she would never do the idiotic things she does in this movie.  That's one of her most endearing qualities - Bridget is smarter than the thin people in her world realize.  Stupid Bridget just ain't that interesting.

In this closed universe of profiteering, the filmmakers are so completely bereft of ideas that no sooner has Darcy left the stage in a semi-huff that Hugh Grant oozes back into Bridget's life, looking for a return to Bridget's arms.  This makes absolutely no sense - here's Grant (it makes no sense to refer to his name - he's playing Hugh Grant), jet-setting around the world for a fun TV show, apparently still sleeping with supermodels, and yet his number one goal seems to be to seduce Bridget.  Whaaaa?  If Grant's purpose was to get revenge on Darcy, then perhaps the movie might have been funny.  Not even Hugh Grant's charm can make this ridiculous character work.

We also get lots of contrived scenes demonstrating how the lovable Bridget gets herself into trouble.  When Bridget thinks she's pregnant, not only are the filmmakers content to fall back on the old ""Let's watch the terrible skier fly down the mountain at top speed, leaving a trail of destruction while narrowly escaping death and screaming 'Whoooo!',"" but they have her glide into a pharmacy (yes, a pharmacy) at the bottom of the slope (pretty prime real estate for a pharmacy), where she requests a birth control test, only to realize that she is in the one store in a German tourist town where nobody speaks English.  Hardy har nope.  There's more exercise of similar ""wit,"" including most tastelessly some completely shameless scenes in a Thai women's prison, where the filmmakers think the prisoners can be made to forget their cares and woes with a little Madonna sing-a-long and some lingerie.  Nice.

Save your money - do not buy this film.  At best, this movie should be seen by potential filmmakers and storytellers as a cautionary tale of the bad things that can happen to a great idea.",1258675200,5,3356,4.65704584040747

The story is quite different from the book, which is fine, but I don't think it captured the essence of the book.

It was entertaining and I might consier watching it again, but it's not what I would consider to be one of the top films.

Like they were trying to make everyone happy, which is impossible.  Adding extra stuff or changing events is sometimes a great thing (like in John Grisham's ""The Firm"") but it didn't seem to work here.

WHile three years passed in real life until the second movie was made, it has only been a few weeks since Bridget found her happiness with Mark Darcy.  She is happy as can be, with her winner of a boyfriend, and enjoying an all around happy streak in life.  Soon, however, she is on shakey ground.

She fears that Mark is turning his affections towards the new hot number in his law firm.  Her paranoia is rising, as she sees the other woman's bright smiles and her appearences at every outing she and Mark go on.  Out of the blue, Daniel Cleaver, the cad who played her, reappears in her newly aquired field of television reporting.  Convinced that Mark is cheating, Bridget goes on an ill advised and irrational trip to Thailand with Daniel Cleaver for business which will inevitably turn into pleasure.

It wasn't as good as the first one, as there were no big surprises.  Daniel will inevitably cheat on her and be caught like in the first one.  Bridget will end up in some terrible mess again (getting thrown in the Thai jail - and notice how all the cellmates speak English marginally well?).  And Mark will come to her rescue once more and bail her out.  Still, it was a good time, with Bridget's bumbling antics.  SHe can laugh at herself, as we can all laugh at ourselves.

1520691,2,B00005JNDZ,"What happened?  Everything that was great about the first movie went terribly wrong in this one.  The first Bridget Jones film was centered on Bridget and Mark Darcy ""finding"" each other, sorting out their misconceptions, and ultimately falling in love.  It is a modern re-telling of the core plot of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice: Girl meets guy at party, guy makes disparaging remark to girl, girl spends majority of film (and miniseries) disliking guy, is briefly deceived by villain (Daniel Cleaver, or in the case of P&P, Mr. Wickham), and eventually realizes guy is truly her perfect match.  And to top it all off, girl and guy share passionate kiss at the end of the film (and the miniseries).  Great formula, right?  And then came the second movie...

Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason is supposed to depict the aftermath, or the ""happily ever after"" that in this case turns out not to go so ""happily.""  Bridget and Mark Darcy have already been together for a while at the start of the film, but all of the chemistry that they had in the first film is completely gone.  They seem almost estranged.  Mark Darcy is just as icy as he was in the first film, only now that he's got the girl, there's no excuse for it.  It just makes him seem closed off.  Bridget is even more insecure than she was in the first film and gets into even more scrapes, only they don't seem as funny this time around.  Instead of making her feel more secure, her relationship with Mark Darcy appears to have had the opposite effect.  She comes off more as a train wreck than as a delightfully accident prone single girl.  Even in their more intimate moments, they don't really seem like a couple (the ski slope scene in which Bridget realizes that she might be pregnant due to ""all the weeks of uninterrupted sex they've had"" begs the question, ""When, exactly?"").  I watched the film thinking, ""How did these two get together?""

And then there's the plot.  Gone are the hilarious conversations between Bridget and her friends in the pub, and gone is the subplot involving Bridget's parents.  The parents are hardly featured in this film, and the friends only sporadically. Instead, we have Shazzer, Jed, cocaine, Thailand, way too much on-screen time with Daniel Cleaver, and a beautiful young lawyer who turns out to be a lesbian in love with Bridget.  Huh?  It's like one of those films where they just throw everything in together and take whatever emerges from the mess.  To make it even worse, the mood of the film is inconsistent.  It starts off attempting to be funny, then gets very dark after Bridget is imprisoned in Thailand on drug charges.  All of a sudden we've gone from comedy to drama, then back to comedy after she is released.  The film is a roller coaster, and in more ways than one.

Overall, it is simply a bad sequel, as so many other sequels have been before it.  Stick to the first movie.  At least you'll still have the ""promise"" that something great will happen.",1176422400,9,2975,4.615238095238095

1520698,4,B00005JNDZ,"Colin Firth still tops the list as one of the hottest leading men, and he only improves with age.  Hugh Grant is comparably handsome, but we find that his character Daniel is up to his old tricks (so despite the fact that he looks absolutely gorgeous, we know he's NOT the one for Bridget). (I must be getting older, as men in their 40s are beginning to look more and more attractive...)

In my opinion, this sequel was well done. The plot may have been a little thin, but I thought the dialogue hilarious.  I was in stitches for much of the movie. In fact, I thought the sequel even funnier than (or at least as funny as) the original, though I admit the plot wasn't as good. (Likewise, I thought Analyze That funnier than Analyze This and loved Meet the Fockers as much as Meet the Parents--as an aside, when my brother got married a little over a year ago, both wedding parties claimed to be the Fockers...)

A few things that I really liked about this movie: it's SO sweet, and I can't imagine a better catch for any woman than Mark Darcy.  When he claims that he was just ""a messanger"" for his law firm who happened to be in Thailand (where Bridget is wrongfully arrested for cocaine smuggling), Bridget looses heart.  She later learns that Mark travelled throughout the world, tracking down the real criminal with as much aplomb as James Bond or the Avengers. I like that despite Bridget's numerous social gaffes and self-professed ""love handles,"" Mark really loves her and recognizes her worth. In other words, unconditional love conquers misunderstandings, jealousies, physical imperfections, and words said in the heat of anger. Bridget Jones is a realistic woman the rest of us can relate to: she battles with insecurities, tries (unsuccessfully) to get rid of bad habits (in Bridget's case, smoking and unhealthy eating), and makes many of the mistakes featured in the movie, ""How to Loose a Guy in 10 Days.""  Yet she's charming and a refreshing break from the Superwoman syndrome.

If you want an escapist movie with some good laughs, this is a great movie to watch.

One part that wasn't so funny--we see women who share their horror stories with Bridget while she's in prison in Thailand--so there's room for social advocacy on the behalf of the viewer and human rights activists.",1166486400,3,2294,4.7007481296758105
1520799,2,B00005JNDZ,"The film, and I guess the book, suffers from being the sequel of what was an unexpected success. Tired, lacking the increasing maturity that one may expect from years added to a girl's journey through life and rushed into making an awful gaff.

There is one scene which the writer and film maker will come to regret. Obviously based on a real life, recently the subject of a UK TV series 'Banged-up' overseas, now the subject of a harrowing autobiography and presumably an equally harrowing film to be. Being dumb enough to become an unwitting drug mule, the suggestion that a Bangkok women's jail could be fun is deeply disturbing. The forthcoming docudrama about Golden Gate suicides is already being criticised for the risk of encouraging such suicides. That film may be able to defend itself, but the Bridget Jones sequel cannot. It is on the edge of reason.

Had the film makers included the scene cut but available on CD, then the Bangkok sequence may have been believable. However it is far too great a suspension of reality to believe that any government and international human rights lawyer, could remain in love with someone whose actions threatened  his career, self concept and family happiness.

The book, the film could have been a 'great' and a great tear-jerker, if the plot had matured closer to reality.

Men the likes of the tall, handsome, forthright Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) and the rakish, shag-happy Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) are still fighting over the bloated, awkward Bridget (Renee Zellweger), who, besides the extra weight, sports an ugly flush of rosacea for most of the film.

We forgive this, though, as we forgive the farfetched Thai prison storyline and the lesbian kiss because scenes like the trivia quiz at the barrister's dinner make it all worthwhile. Bridget is pop-culture's thirtysomething Everywoman, and she's just so damn likeable and yes, most women see parts of themselves in her.

The soundtrack, including Barry White with ""The First, The Last, My Everything"" at the climax of the film, and Sting's ""We'll be Together"" at the credits, doesn't disappoint.

The 1st Bridget Jones movie is lovely but this one is awful!. Bridget Jones now becomes so dislikable and offensive one wants to vomit. It's very sad that Bridget Jones' character is murdered by ""The Edge of Reason.""

The intentions making this change in Bridget's character is plainly mean. Most of the people who love Bridget Jones' Diary are women with ""silly romantic notions."" They image that the lovely ""Bridget"" is their reflection or someone they can relate to. The filmmakers of ""The Edge of Reason"" not only intentionally want to spoil their fun but also want to make fools out of them all. Now by making the biggest fool out of Bridget's character ""The Edge of Reason"" becomes a movie of ridicules! Bridget Jones now is not only obese but also extremely insecure, much more insecure than before so she is a completely unlikable laughing stock.

What man would want to saddle with an awful foolish female like ""The Edge of Reason"" Bridget Jone? Certainly not a man like Mr. Darcy!

1520860,1,B00005JNDZ,"At the end of ""Bridget Jones's Diary,"" the aforementioned Ms. Jones believed she had found eternal happiness in the arms of her new boyfriend, civil rights attorney Mark Darcy.  But at the beginning of ""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason`"" she seems not to have achieved the happy-ever-after ending that both she and we thought she had.  After only a short while together, Bridget suspects that Mark may be cheating on her, and Mark seems embarrassed by all the social faux pas Bridget commits while in public.

Even before the opening credits had ended, I had a premonition that this film might be a stinker when I noticed that no fewer than four people were credited with having had a hand in the screenplay - a sure sign of trouble if ever there was one.  And I wasn't wrong, for ""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason"" stinks to the high heavens.

And what did these four talented, highly paid writers come up with for all their efforts?  A patchwork mess consisting of preposterous situations, boneheaded dialogue, and thoroughly unappealing characters, that`s what.  Frumpy, shrill, desperate and wracked with insecurities, Bridget comes across as the kind of needy, high maintenance girlfriend that would send any reasonably self-respecting man racing not for the altar but for the exits.  It's amazing Mark puts up with her for as long as he does, yet, in all honesty, he`s really no more appealing than she is.  All they do is fight then make up, bicker then reconcile for nigh unto two hours with no rhyme or reason to any of it.  Every moment in the film feels pre-fabricated and arbitrary, with no connection at all to the real world or recognizable human emotions.  In short, as romantic partners, the two of them are so insufferable that I kept wishing that they would put their relationship out of its misery before some desperate soul in the audience did it for them.

Renee Zelwegger and Colin Firth are annoying and grating as the ill-fated pair, and Hugh Grant sleazes his way through the part of the slime-ball news reporter, Daniel Cleaver.  All three actors deserve much better than being mired in a hopeless misfire like this one.  Instead of giving us believable characters in believable situations, the filmmakers pile on scene after scene of inane, embarrassing slapstick routines:  Bridget jumping out of an airplane, Bridget racing uncontrollably down a ski slope, Bridget getting drenched by passing motorist, Bridget getting arrested for cocaine possession in Thailand etc.  Then, in order to cover up for the emptiness of the screenplay, the filmmakers ladle on an endless series of golden oldies to fill up the soundtrack.

""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason"" is about as bad as a romantic comedy can get.  Let's hope some merciful soul over there in Jolly Olde England has the decency to toss Bridget Jones' next diary into the nearest incinerator before it can find its way to the screen.",1136678400,7,2917,4.858585858585859

For several reasons, I thought this movie was a hit and miss endeavor. First of all, I couldn't understand why Jones was whining about boyfriend Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) never fighting for her, considering he beat Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) to a pulp for her in the LAST movie. (Which incidentally, was only four weeks before the second movie begins. Apparently, fighting for Jones at least once a month is required.)

Secondly, some quite preposterous plot turns (Being thrown in a Thai prison? That's a bit much for even my flexible suspension of disbelief.) made the whole movie pretty hard to swallow. Zellweger descends into pure slapstick, and the script takes every opportunity to make jokes at Jones' expense.

The movie was okay, but I don't expect that another film following the escapades of Jones will be worth watching unless the formula is changed enough to allow for some relief.",1132358400,7,1039,5.034883720930233
1520863,2,B00005JNDZ,"As in the first film, Bridget Jones (Rene Zellweger) embarrasses herself again and again.  We're supposed to root for her because she's the underdog, but in the universe of these films she's been blessed with cuteness beyond words, a devoted boyfriend (Colin Firth) who forgives everything (despite an endless string of contrived misunderstandings), and a trio of single eunuchs (Sally Phillips, James Callis, and Shirley Henderson) whose sole reason for existence seems to be cheering and supporting Bridget.  In addition, pop songs swirl around her whenever she's feeling sad and pensive.  Given all that, I wouldn't mind trading places with Bridget.

The gifted cast isn't up to the task of saving this one.  It generates an occassional smile but also some genuine grimaces, such as during an embarrasing (for the filmmakers as well as Bridget) sequence in which she is incarcerated in a Thai prison.  Naturally, the downtrodden Thai prostitutes are charmed by the chubby British white girl, hang on her every word, and enthusiastically participate in her impromptu performance of a Madonna song./",1131667200,,1100,5.293103448275862

I couldn't understand for the life of me why the scriptwriters didn't thought it adequate to use the storyline and ideas of the 2nd BJ book ""The Edge of Reason"" - and a very good sequel at that - especially as it should have been based on the book, shouldn't it? I mean, Bridget's going to Thailand with Daniel (!) and Rebecca's turning out to be lesbian IS NOT included in the original story, to say the least.

There are no  witty scenes to speak of, only exaggerated ones that are embarrassing and painful rather than funny. There is no plot to speak of and no funny dialogues. The characters are all back, but you just can't find  the reason why, as they aren't given any chance to act. However, the worst of all is that the scriptwriters hand in hand with the director succeeded in transforming (=destroying) Bridget's down-to-earth, honest, witty character into a brainless, idiotic blonde ninny. Neither her character, nor her looks are credible any more. The terrible hair and make-up and the fact that instead of gaining some weight to appear more attractive Ren&eacute;e Z simply got fat! didn't help much. Not mentioning the disadvantageous and uncharacteristic clothes that the real Bridget - knowing exactly her good and bad points - would never have worn!

Beeban Kidron whose Hollywood directorial debut was for ""Used People"" in 1992 and also had a moderate hit with ""To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar,"" takes the slapstick and pratfalls to the next level in her work on this film.  The pacing on the film is brisk and keeps us riveted to the fine actors' performances.  Zellweger has gone from success to success with her Oscar nominated performance in ""Chicago"" and her Best Supporting Oscar win for ""Cold Mountain.""  She puts on a few pounds and makes Bridget seem like a real woman caught up in the strangeness of her life.  The sequence in Thailand where she lands in a jail and teaches all the Thai inmates to sing is hilarious.  What really works about the film is the romance.  As Mark Darcy, Colin Firth has a magnetism that he's been able to show repeatedly on film (""A Month in the Country,"" ""Valmont,"" ""Circle of Friends,"" ""The English Patient,"" ""Shakespeare In Love,"" ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"").  As the somewhat stiff barrister, he shows great heart while still maintaining that British reserve.  The fight sequence in the pond with Hugh Grant is hilarious.  The DVD extras where Grant & Firth repeatedly put each other down like, ""He's gaining some weight,"" or ""He's showing his age,"" is good-natured fun.  Hugh Grant as Daniel Cleaver is again one of Britain's best comic actors with great timing and charming good looks.  While Cleaver is as sleazy as ever, he's also hilariously sleazy, and the audience feels that the character just can't help himself.  All in all, while a bit more slapstick than the first film, this sequel puts a smile on your face and is a satisfying good time.  Was it good for you?  :)  Enjoy!",1127088000,5,1874,4.699386503067485

1520913,2,B00005JNDZ,"As described above, The Edge of Reason does not live up to its prequel.  The whole movie revolves around Bridget Jone's jealousy and lack of confidence--common themes that falter relationships as we know.  What this film lacks from the first one is Bridget's directedness as well as her courage to go after the man of her dreams.  Where is the heroine who chases after Darcy in her panty?  If you're a Colin Firth fan, you'll get to see a lot of him in this one.  But I find him not as adorable as before just because he doesn't do anything to get Bridget back into his arms.  I mean, if his love was never wavered despite of her clumsiness and inability to reason as a normal human being, as shown in the first one, why would he agree to break up with her without uttering a word.  Humor wise, well there are some humorous scenes, but most of them are involved Daniel Cleaver, as Hugh Grant remains to be the funniest role in both movies (though still a fat liar.)  I was disappointed after watching it, though I didn't regret spending money on the DVD just because of the bonus piece of which Bridget Jones interviewed Colin Firth.  She kept on and on about his wet-shirt look in Pride and Prejudice.  It was outrageously funny, and I thought that should've been included in the film rather than the skydiving scene, which was a total repeat of the firestation scene in the first movie.  If you love the first movie and you are the kind who will die if you don't ever find out the possibility of ""happily ever after"" between Mark and Bridget, do watch this movie to fulfill your curiosity.  But if you think the story had ended perfectly with Darcy's line ""Oh yes they f*cking do"" in replying to Bridget's remark about how nice boys don't have wickedly awesome kissing skills, perhaps this movie will disappoint.",1125532800,4,1814,4.496951219512195
1520914,4,B00005JNDZ,"Oh Bridget!  You are an absolutely loveable mess.  I watched this movie in both Spanish and English, its just as funny in either language. The wicked Daniel Cleaver is scrummy as ever - but a little easier to resist this time around - since we know he can never truly mend his bad boy ways.  Darcy is the hero every girl dreams of - and yes he is still infuriatingly reserved.  Follow Bridget's wacky adventures and don't miss out on the DVD's deleted scenes.",1124582400,2,459,4.428571428571429
1520915,1,B00005JNDZ,"Everything Bridget learned, grew, appreciated and worked towards in the first film is undone by the calculated stupidity and unfunny blunderings committed in this sequel. It seems that the only time Bridget can be a happy, self-confident woman is when she's on the borderline of misery and happiness. Once happy, she struggles to undo everything she might have done right.

Hugh Grant's character is a sleazy, but fun cad and he plays Daniel allowing us to enjoy him while at the same time showing his appalling self-involvement. However, abandoning Bridget when she's caught at the Thai airport was a stretch and out of character, even for a narcissist. Just because a man's a skirt-chasing, flirtatious louse doesn't mean he needs to be portrayed as an intolerant oaf.

Also, in the first film, Renee was filmed beautifully. Her skin was glowing and even in her granny panties she looked kittenishly sexy. In this film, the director aims certain shots to make every crease in her skin, every fold of flesh and every little wrinkle stand out and frame Bridget as a silly, flabby fatty which, even with the extra pounds, she is not.  Why was it necessary to show her in negative situations in the worst negative light?

The movie and the character might have resonated had she not been  directed and shown in such a ridiculous manner.  As it was, it was dreadful.",1124496000,31,1363,4.828326180257511
1520916,1,B00005JNDZ,"I was and I am still crazy about the first movie of Bridget Jones: I have watched it more than 10 times on DVD. I can laugh and cry with her every single time. And there were so many moments that you feel that she were just you in the real life and have no way out. The screenplay was so well written, even much better than the original fiction in a reasonable funny drama way. All the characters in the movie are so outstanding, also the music; dialogue...perfect! It makes you want to watch it over and over again and never feel bored.

But this one? (sigh...) Is that how UK movie try comedy? Maybe they should stick to their old gun. At some stage, I was thinking maybe it was a bad idea for them to make the second movie for Bridget Jones out of the second fiction. Or should I say, I expected too much? Put in this way, it is more like just an ordinary UK comedy! With exaggerated drama, boring screenplay, over weight character, custom and music...I feel sorry for Bridget. It looks like everyone (mainly the director and the screenplay writer) just want to make fun out of her as much they can. There is no touching moment any more. Even when Mark asked her to marry him at the end, I didn't feel anything at all.

When I read the second book of Bridget, I thought the only storyline in it can match with the first book and the movie is how Bridget deal with this new, long waited relationship, how she build up the trust and commitment with Mark after all they have been through in their previous life. In the book, Mark did have had some affair with Rebecca, but back to Bridget eventually. However, in the movie, Rebecca has been changed into a lez and the whole thing that Mark has an affair was just a joke. The only sophisticated part left over in the second book has been left out in the movie. Well, it is good in a comedy and drama way. I had a good laugh in the cinema, too. But not in a natural way, and there is nothing left on my mind as soon as the screen started to show the credits at the end.

I asked lots of people around me who have seen the second one: Those ones who only watched the second movie said it is a funny comedy. Those ones who watched both of them, but mainly under age 25, said they liked the second one more, because it is funny. Those ones who watched both but more mature told me they think it might not even worth to compare the second one with the first one...Maybe that explains!",1123113600,7,2428,4.183760683760684
1520917,5,B00005JNDZ,OH MY GOSH! Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason is 10 times funnier than than the first one!! I just couldn't stop laughing ! It's soooooo funny! I almost laughed EVERY 5-10 minutes! It's fabulous! U should NEVER miss this film!!,1122854400,2,228,4.4523809523809526
1520918,3,B00005JNDZ,"Did anyone notice the similarities between Brokedown Palace with Claire Danes to Bridget's time in Thailand?  I found the wonderbra scene particularly inane and it seemed to downplay the seriousness of the imprisoned women's condition while Bridget unrealistically skips out of prison like a Catholic schoolgirl.  It just tried too hard to be humorous in the wrong places and didn't capitalize on what could have been genuinely funny.  It seemed to be one of those sequels that plays off of the funny moments from the first movie instead of creating new humor.  Also, while Daniel Cleaver was a likeable cad in the first movie, he comes off as a genuine fool in the second.  Bridget was adorable in the first movie, but just plain dumpy in this one - I couldn't figure out what Mark saw in her.  Like another reviewer said, she failed as an ""everywoman.""  I could identify with her in the first movie, but if I could identify with her in this one, I would be embarrassed to admit it.  Further, Rebecca was unrecognizable (from her book character) and what kind of horrible friend is Shaza?

That being said, this movie wasn't unwatchable as far as entertainment value goes.  Mark Darcy was still great though the fight scene was silly and forced.  Renee Zellweger and Hugh Grant were tolerable.  Renee seemed to be a bit more of a poseur and not as ""real"" as her original Bridget character, but she wasn't terrible.  I would recommend this to anyone who is not a Bridget fanatic and who liked the first movie.  I am a big fan of the first movie and book, and so found this movie disappointing.",1122163200,,1593,4.642857142857143
1520989,1,B00005JNDZ,"As other reviewers have noted, this time around the film makers have made Bridget SO inept and inane that she's just not funny. The focus is on her incredibly bad mismatch with Mark Darcy and after the second or third break-up you wish they'd just end it and get it over with. We really needed much more of Hugh Grant's Daniel Cleaver for it seems he's the only one who really seems to like Bridget this time around. But when the film takes a preposterously unrealisticturn into a Thai prison it moves from unfunny to decidedly unpleasant.",1122163200,7,539,4.56701030927835
1520990,2,B00005JNDZ,"...just like Hugh Grant as Daniel Cleaver says to Bridget at one point in the movie.

And this makes this movie hard to watch in many places.  Bridget Jones was supposed to be sort of like an Everywoman, someone who other women could identify with who have bad days at work, bad hair days, aren't the perfect weight,  and have been in bad relationships.  But the writers and director just made her ridiculous in this one.

Renee Zellwegger is as good as she is in the first movie, but she's given a crummy script in my opinion.  The relationshipship between her and Mark Darcy doesn't make any sense at all here, at least not nearly as much as it did in the first movie. They have absolutely nothing in common, despite supposedly  having grown up in the same neighborhood.  Colin Firth is gorgeous to look at as always, but the Mark Darcy character is so, well, haughty .  I realize he's based on Mr. Darcy in ""Pride and Prejudice', but in the book he at least displayed some humor sometimes, as he did in the first movie in the cooking scene.

In this movie he barely cracks a smile, though who can blame him when Bridget keeps doing embarrassing things whenever they're together.  Honestly, it seems as if the people that made the film wanted to make her character a total figure of fun.  Parts of it were actually cringe-producing.",1121472000,4,1334,4.5125
1520991,1,B00005JNDZ,"I don't usually review films that I only saw by chance and then didn't like, but I'm making an exception here, as ""Bridget Jones  - The Edge of Reason"" is a true disaster all round. I saw the first movie and found it mildly amusing, so when this turned up I thought I'd give it a go, but I'm sorry I bothered.

Basically, the Bridget Jones in this film is a total idiot, who messes up everything in her life including her pride, her love life, and her career. Not in a funny or endearing way, though, which would encourage sympathy. And not in a zany Lucille Ball-type way either, that would get you laughing. No, just in a totally stupid and pointless way that makes you want to hit her. Every embarrassing  faux-pas or misunderstanding the character stumbles through (and there are dozens) just makes you want to switch off and leave her to it. She messes up every single aspect of her relationship, her job, and her holiday by saying and doing the most brainless and unfathomable things, in ways that a real person would never do. Or if they did, they wouldn't have any friends...and certainly not Hugh Grant and Colin Firth fighting over them!

Rene Zellweger playes Bridget as a totally unloveable, boring and socially inept loser...I don't think this is the actress's fault, or even due to the original charcter in the Helen Fielding novels, but more due to the terrible script and direction. Why does Bridget walk everwhere like a constipated duck, for example? Why does she laugh and sigh at every stupid blunder she makes, and just waddle on to the next stumbling point? Even when she's lost the love of her life, it's all summed up with a shrug and a rueful smile. Come on, girl, try and make us care! I sure didn't!

If that wasn't bad enough, the last third of the movie almost made me shout at the screen...Dopey Bridget is duped into smuggling a massive stash of cocaine out of Thailand, and gets caught trying to board a plane at Bangkok airport. She then gets thrown into a Thai women's prison. This notoriously unpleasant predicament really doesn't belong in a (supposedly) frothy comedy like this is, but it just gets worse, as have-a-go Bridget gets all (and I mean ALL) the inmates on her side which results in a  huge sing-along scene and lots of laughing and hugging. Sorry, I don't think so somehow. This sugar-coated representation of the notoriously brutal Thai prison regime left a nasty taste in my mouth...not alleviated in the slightest when Bridget gets an anticipated (but blatently unlikely) full pardon and early release, just because her lawyer boyfriend pulls the right strings.

The above illustration is the worst example, but I didn't find any of Bridgets other antics entertaining or affecting in the slightest either. She's somehow got a high profile TV reporters job, but she can't even do it. Everyone makes jokes about her weight and she just thinks it's funny. With a central and supporting cast of usually reliable performers, it's tragic how lame this film has turned out. There's nothing apparent to make you understand or care about any of the lead characters actions. And that means a waste of 90 minutes in my book. Make better use of your time and give this one a miss.",1120003200,30,3220,4.668430335097002
1520992,3,B00005JNDZ,"OK, as many have noted it is not as good as Bridget Jones's Diary, which is the gold standard in romantic comedies as far as I'm concerned. The Thailand plot is totally ludicrous with the only saving grace being a very sexy and snarky performance from Hugh Grant. Be prepared for more slapstick and physical humor from Renee Zellwegger (who pulls it off quite nicely) but not as much wit as the first film. However, as a major Colin Firth fan I have to recommend it because he appears much more frequently in this film than the first. There are a few times that he takes your breath away with his gorgeousness and of course there is the terrific second fight between him and Hugh Grant. Plus, if you purchase the DVD you'll find some very fun extras--a mock interview between the ""real"" Bridget Jones and Colin Firth, a dissection of the fight scene, a look at the CGI during one of the film's key scenes and a lot more.

If you love Bridget Jones you're going to find some laughs from this and if you love Colin Firth you really shouldn't pass it up. Who's cuter than Mark Darcy?",1119398400,3,1080,4.4
1520993,3,B00005JNDZ,"Those who loved the prequel, ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" will, undoubtedly, be disappointed by this sequel, as it lacks much of the charm of the original, as well as its rapier sharp and witty script. Instead, the viewer is set upon by a bloated script that lacks intelligence and charm. Even the main character, Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger), our formerly lovable every woman, seems to have lost some of her winning ways, as what previously seemed effortless, now seems too contrived. Quite frankly, this film simply does not reach the heights of excellence that the prequel did. So, those viewers who loved the original film will be disappointed.

The direction of this film seems ham-handed, with a screenplay that simply tries too hard to be all that the original was.  Unfortunately, it fails in its execution, hampered with too many sub-plots that are simply not funny. Colin Firth (Marc Darcy) and Hugh Grant (Daniel Cleaver) reprise their original roles and manage to hang onto their charm, but their dialogue rings hollow, as they struggle with a script not worthy of them. Ms. Zellweger also struggles with her role, as at times it calls for her to act totally stupid, something that the original screenplay did not require. The screenwriters obviously confused stupidity with naivet.  It is a shame that they were unable to come up with something worthier of the wonderful talent in this film. While there are some funny moments in the film, they are few and far between. In fact, some of the film is downright painful to watch. Still, those moviegoers who viewed the first film should see this sequel and judge for themselves. They should, however, rent rather than buy it.",1118793600,2,1683,4.919014084507042
1520994,2,B00005JNDZ,"I didn't find Bridget THAT cute in this story after seeing her with That strange make up in her face for that party. It was not fun, made her seems very unworthy of Mark Darcy. Both the guys were stupendous, the cad one suggesting a ""shag-a-thon"" weekend, the fight in the fountain, really nice, they ""saved""the movie. But Bridget with that make-up, the party, being in that prison where the roomates were so cultured that most of them knew English, Mars and Venus, Madonna sounds crap. The movie had too many flaws, the only thing worthy was seeing both guys fighting for her (Why anyway? She is a pathetic woman).",1118707200,7,615,4.6
1520995,3,B00005JNDZ,"Last time we saw her, Bridget Jones (Zellweger) was in love with Mark Darcy (Firth) and they were staying together for the movie's happy ending. Now, we find them again only a few weeks later, exactly one year after they first met in the buffet organized by Bridget's mother. And guess what, they are there again; another year, another buffet, another diary. This is how we jump into the sequel, and as usually happens, it is not as good as the original; but it still provides us with a fun time.

Bridget is working in ""Sit Up Britain"" and is continuously finding herself in ridiculous situations, which do not portray her in a very flattering light, but boosts rating. As happened in the previous movie, we get to listen to her comments on the events that she is going through; comments that are usually pretty funny, but sometimes turn out to be a bit corny.

You probably are asking yourself by now, what about Daniel (Grant)? Well, he has a TV show in the same network as Bridget, and even though she does not even want to hear about him anymore, their paths cross when they have to work together on one of the shows. And this happens right when she is thinking about marriage with Mark, but the encounter situation things a bit. And the fact that Mark is working with a very attractive woman does not help in the least.

The movie keeps the main characteristics of the winning formula used for the first one, and yes...you will get to see another fight between Daniel and Mark, so do not worry. But some things are funnier the first time around, and that is true in this case too. The creators did add a little variety though, with a little travel that allows for a change of settings, but it is still not enough to compensate for the repeated humor.

The cast does a very good job, especially Zellweger, who is perfect for the role and shows a clear ability for portraying a character that constantly makes a fool of herself. The soundtrack is eclectic and fits the movie well, including songs ranging from Barry White to Madonna. Finally, I need to comment on the option of watching the movie with the quiz option, since it is an annoying feature that keeps stopping the film to ask the questions. And on top of that, it has such silly options as answers that my wife decided to quit it and stick with the ""normal"" version of the movie. - 3.5 stars",1117843200,,2356,4.459396751740139

A plot would've been nice (instead of wandering around from a skydiving incident to a jail in Thailand); I don't consider a ""misunderstanding"" about a woman a viable plot device. Renee Zellweger and Colin Firth, whom I thought had a sparky relationship in the first film, have been turned into screenplay robots, reading their lines as if directly from the page.

The only saving grace in the story was Hugh Grant (and believe me, I'm not a huge Hugh Grant fan). When he finally showed up in the picture he immediately added some much needed dialogue-infused comedy to the story. And he delivered his lines as if he MEANT them.

The sad part for me, too, is that I really like Mrs. Zellweger and Mr. Firth as actors. Renee was excellent in the musical ""Chicago""; and Mr. Firth's crowning achievement (""Pride and Prejudice"") has yet to be rivaled for a period piece in my humble opinion.

I feel that this film was simply a money-grab by the movie studio, trying to benefit off of the success of its predecessor ...and failing miserably.",1117843200,5,1214,4.611111111111111

If you have seen ""THE DIARY OF BRIDGET JONES"", you must see this one and if you haven't seen it. I would recommend you to start with that one so you can follow better the story.

This time the picture starts with a very happy Bridget (Rene Zellweger) who is deeply in love with Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) and that love is mutual. Everything goes perfect until Bridget and Mark have a fight that ends with the relationship because Bridget is jealous of Natasha (Mark's friend who is beautiful and rich) and because Mark is still very arrogant with her. After this appears once again Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) who is called to work with Bridget. The story goes to several places from this point and you can laugh very much and have a great time with this movie that also has a wonderful soundtrack featuring songs by Joss Stone, Mary J.

It's almost as funny as the first time around, with some great hair-pulling, body-slamming interludes. The rest of the movie left my mind almost at the same time I watching it, except some painful memories of cheesy looking sets and politically correct third-world prisons. Any movie set in Thailand with no filth and squalor goes way beyond comedy to a kind of propagandistic obscenity. Don't be fooled, tourists of the world, ""Edge of Reason"" is to the real Thailand what Woody Allen films are to the real New York.",1116115200,2,640,4.774774774774775
1521049,2,B00005JNDZ,"The first Bridget Jones movie was a perfect little human comedy.  Although absurdly unlucky, Bridget remained a consistent and logical (in her own way) centre to the film.  The humour grew organically from her ""logical"" reactions to the absurdity happening around her.  And we had a nice, romantic happy ending.  The same praise cannot be given to this sequel, ""Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason.""  Don't get me wrong - I enjoyed the film in a superficial way, at least while I was watching it.  Unfortunately, it's entirely unecessary, except as a money-making grab by the studio.

The plot: Mark Darcy is seen in the presence of another woman.  Bridget assumes he is cheating on her and is then assigned a job in Thailand with Daniel Cleaver (the ""ex"").  Therein lies the main problem I had with the film: the entire story is built on misunderstandings that could be cleared up with the tiniest application of logic on any one of the characters' parts.  Similarly, actions are not driven by the nature of the characters, but rather the requirements of the plot.  For example, almost immediately after starting the relationship with Mark Darcy, Bridget's friends are advising her to dump him.  Why?  I have no idea - I guess because the screenplay told them to!  Similarly, if Bridget is thrown in a Thai jail while on assignment for her TV network, wouldn't someone at that network notice that she had gone missing?

Am I applying logic where none is required?  Probably.  But a sequel should be able to build on the characters rather than making them more two-dimensional (or making their actions arbitrary).  I should be asking is the film funny?  Are the actors good?  The answer to both questions is undeniably ""yes!""  I applaud the idea of building a comedy around the question, ""what happens after happily ever after?"" Unfortunately, the film bails and gives us a series of silly little scenes that work on their own, but never add up to anything worthwhile.

On the plus side, Mirimax has deigned to give us at least a few extras on the DVD.  There are some deleted scenes, the most welcome being the infamous ""Bridget interviews Colin Firth"" scene from the novel.  Obviously, it became impossible to put this in the movie with Firth playing Mark Darcy, but they filmed it anyway at the end of a day's shooting and stuck it on the DVD as a treat to those who have read the book.  There are also some scene breakdowns and a director's commentary.",1115856000,5,2455,4.706572769953052

They would be spared the pain of possibly remembering even one second of this unbelievably bad movie.

Zellwegger is her usual self; pouty, cute, irresistable even when deliberately overweight. But the plot has worn thin and her almost-virginal innocence is getting old. Clumsy girl meets boy, girl gets engaged, girl goofs up, girl gets sidetracked, girl gets boy back....

That said, if you're in the mood for a pleasant evening, this is the ticket. If you're in the mood for a great, innovative story with exceptional delivery, choose another movie.",1115596800,,735,5.016393442622951
1521052,3,B00005JNDZ,"Oh how we love to cry ""not as good as the first movie"", but in truth very few movie sequels capture the freshness, or spirit of an often inventive and new idea like an original. Sadly, that is also the case here when comparing the first and infinitely better Bridget Jones Diary, but there are a few saving graces to make this at least mildy entertaining. The story picks up 4 weeks after the end of the first movie (although 3 years have elapsed in real time) and we find ALL the main characters reprising their roles. Bridget is still oozing the giddy romance and, likeably bumbling naivety of a 30 something schoolgirl, alongside Colin Firth's stoic, but gentlemanly romantic lawyer Darcy, and all seems well despite some nagging incompatibility issues between the two. The clash of class cultures between them continues (albeit in some very contrived scenarios) until doubt, envy and the adjustment of two single lifers suddenly sharing, looks set to send things off the rails. Enter at this point dashing bad boy Hugh Grant as Daniel, stirring up old memories, and mixed emotions, and conveniently now working for the same TV company as Bridget and we are set hopefully for some light entertainment. Problem however, is that none of the engaging aspects of Bridgets character from the first movie, or the concern or sympathy that were previously generated is here, and most of the original cast (nice to see as they are) are just minimally sprinkled in the plot for the purpose of continuity without any real inclusion. I kept asking myself why a sequel was necessary (as I often do, despite the obvious money spinning aspect) when the first picture was so complete, making this a reheating of old material to a large extent. There is enough charm to keep the picture moving, and the characters are all played excellently, but the script is limp overall, some parts being often less than funny completely (especially the Thai prison scenes). The occasional nice dialogue and one-liners try but fail to lift this picture out of the doldrums, and the cringe aspect of most of the embarassing situations Bridget falls into is painful at times. If you liked the first movie, chances are this will amuse you, but it's not in the same league unfortunately. There are some nice extras on the DVD including some funny interviews with the leading characters, deleted scenes, and the usual director comments etc. My best advice? rent before you buy.

1521053,3,B00005JNDZ,"Was it too late to make a sequel to the adorable Bridget Jones'Diary after more than 3 years? That's what I wanted to ask when this one came out in theaters. Some movies are better if no sequels were made. This one obviously wanted to make more money when the script is really not as interesting and funny as the first one. Apparently, Renee Zellwegger got paid like twenty times more money for this film than the first. The hundreds of donuts, cheese cakes and pizzas she had to eat to gain the 30lbs really showed in this film. She's very ""striking"" in one scene when she wore a tight fitting gold colour evening gown. Talk about the waistline of BJ. Well, we got to give the American Texan the credit for the stunning transformation, and the British accent is still right on.

So we know that she found the love of her life in BJ Diary. Colin Firth reprises the role of Mark Darcy, the future husband of BJ,since they have moved in together. Their relationship looks picture perfect at first, but jealousy and insecurity took over BJ's mind when she mistaken him for cheating with a tall and beautiful assistant. Bridget gets pregnant, and Darcy was very happy and decided to propose to her. Then Daniel(Hugh Grant) reappeared in BJ's life, and they spent some time together in a journalism partnership in Thailand. Bridget's life is at a chaotic state when she was mistaken by the customs for carrying drugs in her luggage, and who will bail her out before she faces possible imprisonment.....

There's many attempts on jokes in this movie. They did Madonna's Like A Virgin and Material Girl in the prison scenes, but it didn't provoke much laughters like BJ did when she did All By Myself in the first film. Darcy and Daniel also get to have a man-to-man fight over BJ again, but we know Daniel is not the man for Bridget, because her heart belongs Darcy.

Hugh Grant had limited screentime here, and didn't have much chemistry with Zellwegger. Colin Firth is good as a calm and sophisticated high class gentleman/lawyer(a true ladies man). As for Renee Zellwegger, she's tried her best at being funny, and touching while maintaining her British persona, but the role has lost it's zest compared to the first BJ. Hopefully we won't have to see her playing overweight and English again for a while.",1115424000,,2302,4.651105651105651
1521054,3,B00005JNDZ,"The essential problem with the second Bridget Jones film is that the best parts remind the viewer of parts of the first film that were done a whole lot better.  It is a pleasant enough movie, but not so pleasant that I would recommend it over taking a risk on any other film or doing something safe like rewatching an episode of BUFFY.  I haven't read the book upon which the second film is based, so perhaps it is to blame for the relative blandness of the sequel, but something is to blame for the fact that while the original was charming and entertaining, the sequel feels tired and derivative.  But even if the book is to blame, it is incumbent upon anyone making a sequel to try to find some way of making the second film in some way new, instead of merely recycling the first.  In this regard, the movie fails.

An additional problem I had with this movie is that it took some of the weaker aspects of the original even further than it had done.  For instance, one of the sources of the original was Bridget's penchant for making a bit of an ass out of herself.  Despite this, she constantly manages to come across as cute and adorable, but in the second film she merely looks ridiculous.  The first film presented Bridget as a sympathetic character, but she was much harder to love in the second.  Again, the fault may lie with the source material, but it is important for any filmmakers, when confronted with a weak source, to make it stronger in the rewrite.

As with the original, Renee Zellweger is delightful as Bridget, and she remains the main reason for watching the film.  She is one of my favorite contemporary actresses, and someone who hasn't done the range of performances that I would have liked to see her take on.  I miss the days when she did small, independent films like THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.  She looks a bit plumper in this one than in the original, and it is interesting that one of the more celebrated non-anorexic characters of reason years would be played twice by one of the thinnest actresses in the movies.  On the other hand, I didn't like either Colin Firth or Hugh Grant as much in this film as in the former.  The interesting thing about Mark Darcy (just as with his namesake from the BBC production of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE-not a slip on my part, because Ms Fielding acknowledges that the model for Darcy was Colin Firth's performance in the six-hour BBC production of the Jane Austen classic) in the first film was in gradually learning about his true feelings about Bridget.  There was no such mystery in this one.  Likewise, knowing from the original that Daniel Cleaver was a deceptive, manipulative creep made him a pretty uninteresting character in the sequel.  The guys too as good a job as is possible given the limited possibilities of character development, but their roles are too circumvented to allow of much interest.

So, do I recommend this or not?  I really am on the fence.  I guess I'm glad I saw it, but if I hadn't I would have been able to preserve more fully my respect for the original.  Sequels can often mar excellent originals (think of the MATRIX movies), but still leave an overall surplus of enjoyment.  I guess I liked seeing this one OK, but I can't say now that I would have regretted never having seen it at all.  I suppose that there is no harm in seeing this one, but I would warn anyone who really liked (as I did) the original, that this one falls far short of that superb film.",1115251200,2,3455,4.464968152866242
1521055,3,B00005JNDZ,"What I loved about the Bridget Jones books and the movie most was the fact that we got to see a heroine who was far from perfect in every possible aspect. She was someone women could relate to and perhaps laugh at her flightiness and in turn make the rest of us feel better that we are not in her shoes. However, watching the film version of Bridget Jones: The Edge or Reason was like watching a parody of the aforementioned anti-heroine. Almost every scene in the sequel centers on Bridget Jones going through humiliating moments that are too over the top at times. There were some poignant and sweet moments with Bridget and Mark Darcy, but they were few and far in between. The plot also seems bloated, like the editors tried to add as many elements of the book as possible in 110 minutes. And the solution regarding relationship interloper Rebecca is too contrived and simplified for my taste. Also, the elements of Jane Austen's Persuasion that were in the book are missing here.  What happened?  The first book had been inspired by Austen's Pride and Prejudice and said inspiration was also apparent in the movie.  This is yet another major flaw in this film. But despite the aforementioned things, the movie was indeed funny and entertaining and Renee Zellwegger (who gained more weight to do this film than she did in the first one) and gorgeous Colin Firth had great chemistry. Hugh Grant is always fun to watch whenever he plays a bad boy. Grant is more believable in the aforementioned roles than he is when he plays the boy next door type of characters he played in Notting Hill and Love Actually. All in all, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason is not as good as the Helen Fielding novels or as good as the first movie and I'd advise you to rent the DVD before you buy it.",1115078400,,1783,4.513931888544891
1521056,2,B00005JNDZ,"I've never written a review before, but I felt the need after watching this movie.  I absolutely adored the first installation and found the whole Pride and Prejudice thing cute.  I was told that the second book, The Edge of Reason, was not as good, but still good for laughs.  Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was laugh-out-loud funny with wonderful characters.  I really felt the ties between Bridget and her friends, as well as Bridget and her parents.  I really enjoyed ""seeing"" into the whacky lives of her friends who were written quite well.  You really got a sense that they were individual people.  I also loved the whole Austen's Persuasion thing with Rebecca and Benwick.  Being a bit slow, I didn't catch on until the party with the accident, but when I got there I was delighted.

Unfortunately, the movie cut all of this out.  The crazy story with her mom and the African dude..GONE.  Everything about her friends and their lives...GONE.  The whole Austen's Persuasion thing...GONE.  And Rebecca's scheming ways..GONE AND TRANSFORMED!  The Thai thing was there, but the sadness of it, the desparation of it, Bridget's time of reflection...GONE.  Its like the movie makers robbed the story of everything that made it ""real"".  All we were left with was a bit of fluff. Granted, Colin was looking yummy in the fluff, but still, it was just souless, meaningless fluff.  I was so disappointed.",1114646400,9,1410,4.877637130801688
1521057,3,B00005JNDZ,"What is a young woman supposed to do when she is torn between two lovers? That is the question posed by this movie, ""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason"". Renee Zellweger is back in the main role as Bridget Jones in this continuation of the original Bridget Jones from 2001. And this time around, she is forced to choose between her new lover, Mark, and her former lover, Daniel.

This movie is the type that most will find agreeable enough to give it a chance, but it isn't as loaded with laughs as some viewers will hope. I found only a couple of scenes funny, and I started to wonder why the movie was billed as a romantic comedy. It is really more dramatic than humorous, and many of the attempts at humor are tired and worn out- the type of humor you hear over and over again in movies.

I didn't care much for the storyline of this movie, mainly because it is so ordinary. How many times have we seen a movie like this- one that portrays a woman who is torn between two men, feels jealous about the new guy, but is still attracted in a strange way to the former lover, even though he has betrayed her trust in the past? It is the same old formula from Hollywood that we have grown to expect, but would like to see changed.

I like the performances of the three main characters; Zellweger, Colin Firth, and Hugh Grant. They all bring a certain degree of charm to their respective roles and they all seem believable, although it is difficult to look at Hugh Grant as a bad guy. He just doesn't have a nasty- enough look to fulfill this role, even if his bad reputation is because of dishonesty in relationships.

Overall, this is a decent flick, and those who enjoyed the first Bridget Jones will probably like this one too. There isn't anything particularly memorable about it, but there is enough entertainment overall to make it worthy of seeing just once.",1113782400,3,1861,4.401162790697675
1521058,3,B00005JNDZ,"This movie was so great!  It was so much better than the first Bridget movie.  Maybe I feel this way because I love Colin Firth, but there were so many things that I really liked in this movie. If you like love stories that have great endings and make sense they you will love this movie! Watch this movie you will love it too!!!",1113436800,2,329,4.125
1521119,4,B00005JNDZ,"Some of this movie does feel like a re-hash. But that's okay, since the movie was great the first time around, I don't mind seeing some of the same stuff again. This time around, we join Bridget, as she's right in the middle of her relationship with sexy lawyer Mark Darcy (Colin Firth). She's still at her TV job, making a fool of herself (remember the hilarious fireman's pole thing from the first??!! Similar situation in this one...).

Bridget is getting worried because it seems that Mark might have a love interest at work. Of course, Bridget is just jumping to all the wrong conclusions. She gets pretty low, then gets a job to go to Thailand and film a sort of tourist guide. Guess who is working there too? And at the same job and company because her boss told her that they needed a male personality? That's right. Daniel (Hugh Grant). Unlike Mark, Daniel really is a skeez. Will she go back with Daniel, who feeds her compliments and tells her what a fool he's been? Or will she get back with Mark? Obvious answer. The movie got a little weird for me (I actually thought she had to be dreaming at first because I couldn't believe it) when Bridget is sent to a Thai prison. Yeah.

Overall, though, this is a funny movie. It'd be fun just to take a Saturday night with your girlfriends and watch both movies in a row, feeling bad, then happy, bad, then happy right along with Bridget. I don't care if I've seen some of this movie before in the first. It was funny the first time. Why wouldn't it be the second time?? RECOMMMENDED!!",1113004800,4,1540,4.419014084507042
1521120,4,B00005JNDZ,"I had read, and laughed hilariously through, Helen Fieldings' book of the same name, so I was on tenterhooks to see the movie. I would not say it's as good as the book or even the first movie, but it has plenty to recommend it, and I found myself hooting with laughter more than once.

Just remember where the last movie left off, and settle back for the mindless but purely enjoyable sequel. Bridget is still getting into impossible situations at work, all is NOT well with Darcy, and the nefarious Daniel (Hugh Grant at his most wicked and desirable) turns up again to muddy the waters. Throw in a Thai prison, a drug smuggling charge and sundry other embarrassing predicaments, and you've got the gist.

Hugh Grant and Colin Firth have a truly side-splitting fight (again, but better than the first movie), each is perfect in his role, as always. Renee Zellweger, puffed up to the max, is wonderful as the overweight Bridget, although I must say that a scene BEFORE the ending, which must have been shot last, has Renee considerably slimmed down, only to appear heavier than ever in the very next scene. Quite disconcerting, actually.

The extras on this DVD are a riot, especially when Hugh and Colin, separately, each diss the other (in fun) and discuss the fun they had filming the memorable fight scene.

Altogether a fun addition to one's collection, maybe not as perfect as the first, but so what? I loved it anyway.",1112659200,5,1425,4.665338645418327
1521121,1,B00005JNDZ,"We all loved Bridge Jones the first time around because she was the underdog.  She was the Spider-Man of Superheroes; the everyday average woman with every day average troubles who was a victim of circumstance, and eventually bad luck turned into good luck and she ended up with the handsome successful lawyer Mark Darcy (Colin Firth).

This time around she is too stupid for us to care about her.  She is her own worst enemy, and no one really cares about that heroine.  She is pathetic.  She sabotages her relationship - more importantly, herself - not through her insecurities about her weight, paranoia or jealousy, but just by being an overall basket case.  Gone is the woman from the first flix who was a least trying; this one seems to be trying to but herself into ridiculous situations when she is not flat out screwing up something if her life.

Bottom line, the first movie was enough and it is best to remember the character that way.  It's like peeking behind the curtain at the wizard, or learning what happening after Happily Ever After . . . we learn the upper class educated lawyer really cannot have a happy relationship with the lesser class half-wit short skirted journalist, not just because love does not conquer all, but because we couldn't stand having her around us either.

I give it 2 stars, however, because Hugh Grant's Daniel Cleaver is worth one, and this time - you do route for him to love her and leave her because she just cannot learn from her mistakes.",1112572800,7,1489,4.6311787072243344
1521122,1,B00005JNDZ,"I rather enjoyed the first movie and had no qualms about renting its sequel...that was my first mistake. When will I learn that all sequels are generally crap? I get my self all exited only to be let down.  There's nothing new in this movie. No character growth, no original ideas, and no humour. Okay maybe a little humour if you can call it that. Being British myself, I can only describe this as Americas view on British people in general. We're not all dithering idiots that use the word shag in every other sentence.  Bridget has transcended into a paranoid, annoying and embarrassing individual and not in the cute way so much as you want to slap her for being so ignorant. The witty dialogue in the first film has been replaced with rather pathetic physical comedy that induces nausea. Its so unrealistic. And the whole Thai jail thing? Well that plot was lifted from a film called Broke down palace, with Clair Danes. That was crap as well. You'd think they'd take a hint. Colin Firth plays Fitzwilliam Darcy in the 21st century yet again. Personally I'm tired of seeing him play the same character in every film. Kind of like Sandra Bullock (you know its true). I didn't mind Hugh Grant, but that was probably because he had the most amusing lines. I just hope he expands to more then his two I'm a total sex rogue\clueless dopey English guy from Notting Hill roles. As for comparisons from the first movie

1. Jones lands bottom first on camera. Check

2. Cleaver remarks on how urr..appropriate her mini skirt is. Check

3. Darcy's in a stupid Jumper. Check

4. Darcy and Cleaver have another fight, only this time its totally unfunny because we've seen it all before. Check. Playing horrific music from The Darkness doesn't help

5. The big knickers have there come back. Check

6. Jones makes total fool of herself in front of a crowd of haughty tautys. Check except this time its not endearing because she's become a total twit

There's more but I need to wrap things up. Basically Jones has gone from a rather amusing character into a paranoid, stupid git that doesn't think before she starts spouting total tosh and revealing herself to be no good for anyone really. Being a woman myself, I think she gives us a bad name. Perhaps men like blond, ditsy, insecure, jealous woman because it makes them feel intelligent and in control. I don't know. I have one more gripe: the making fun and stereotyping of the Thai woman in jail was totally wrong. And Bridget giving the `men are from Mars, woman are from Venus' books was stupid. Plus if the title was in English I'm assuming the books were as well so how the hell are they supposed to read it anyway. Perhaps I'm just too picky. If you're looking for some good English humour, try Fry & Laurie, French & Saunders, Absolutely Fabulous and The Vicar of Dibly. I enjoyed the lesbian scene though. It was the only plot point that I didn't see coming from a mile off. Cute!",1112400000,9,2934,4.552182163187855
1521123,2,B00005JNDZ,"Unfortunately, Bridget Jones's Edge of Reason is just one more example of a sequel that falls short of the magical perfection of the original film.  Actors Renee Zellweger, Colin Firth, and Hugh Grant, reprise their roles with the usual charm and gusto of the first movie but their efforts can't sustain a weak storyline that has poor Bridget spiraling downwards into a seemingly endless series of mishaps which seem to become increasingly discomforting to watch.  The final (low) blow occurs when Bridget is arrested and detained at the Thai prison among women whom she finds out have been abused, drugged, and pimped by their ""boyfriends"".  The ""humor"" in this wears even thinner (if that's possible) when Bridget teaches her fellow inmates the proper words for singing Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"".  (Perhaps the writers should have been incarcerated instead of poor Bridget.)

The film sequel picks up where Bridget Jones's Diary ends, with Bridget and Mark Darcy well into the start of their relationship, wrapped up in the excitement, joy, and self-absorbed warmth of being a couple.  However, the relationship is tested as Bridget's insecurities coupled with Mark's self-conflict in trying to reconcile loving someone who doesn't quite fit in among his work colleagues and friends, forms the storyline for the movie.  Matters get further complicated with the reappearance of Daniel Cleaver with whom Bridget is paired for a work assignment.  While Edge of Reason has some wonderful moments reminiscent of the first film such as the exchanges (albeit short ones) between Bridget's parents, her friends, and of course the obligatory ""giant panties"" and disarmingly funny fight scene between Mark Darcy and Daniel Cleaver, in total it just isn't enough to match the near perfection of Bridget Jones's Diary.

It was also a bit surprising to see some character shifts, particularly with Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) who in the first film was a seductive yet charming predator who seemed to have some (if little) conscience.  In Edge of Reason, his seductive charm has now taken on a darker quality which makes it clear he is not to be trusted.  Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) exudes moments of warmth (""I have a high regard for your wobbly bits"") mixed with cool aloofness but underneath it all, he does love Bridget and we root for him as he struggles to define the context of that love.  As for Bridget, she continues to battle her own demons, but finally realizes that Mark does love her, ""just as she is.""  (Note:  Bridget's coloring has inexplicably changed from the engaging babyish colors of cream and pink from the first film to a somewhat ruddy tan in the sequel - which seems odd as the sequel is supposed to pickup just a few weeks (or 70+ shags-worth) from the end of the first movie.)

The DVD bonus segments, particularly Bridget's interview of Colin Firth was very funny, and the segment on the ""Lonely London"" CGI effects was quite interesting.  However overall it would have been nice to have had more material included on the DVD such as: a featurette on making the movie, trailers, movie premiere and press interviews, out-takes, information about the music selections used for the movie, and perhaps even more deleted scenes (only 3 deleted scenes were included on the DVD).  At  $20.99  this is a pricey DVD (more than The Incredibles, and just a few dollars short of Lord of the Rings and many other better made films) with few additional materials to justify the cost.",1112400000,2,3484,4.9553264604811

The same goes with the movie. I can pop in the first Bridget DVD anytime. It's hilarious, sweet, and as charming as any Austen adaptation should  be; not so with the Edge of Reason. The movie is not funny in any sense of the word. The watcher sees poor Bridget go through one humiliating experience after another, and then there's the whole Thailand debacle. What is this, Brokedown Palace? I can safely say, though, that because of the many horrible changes/additions in the movie that were not in the book, I have a newfound respect for the novel. But what worries me is Fielding had a hand in writing the screenplay for Reason. All I can say is what was she thinking?

For one, I wasn't initially a huge fan of the first, which I agree is the better of the pair, but it's since grown in intrigue for me as it presents a sympathetic although neurotic character who's trying her best to be lovable but keeps messing up.

I appreciate the commitment the filmmakers had to this character, who is almost maddeningly paranoid in this second movie, but still has charm, and is believable enough to make you root for her.  Some of the earlier sequences between Darcy and Bridget are too cheesy for my taste, but I liked how they were balanced with squabbles between them as well--they seemed stupid, but so typical of many real couples.

Most of all, I thrilled to the part where I found out, along with Bridget, that Darcy had indeed done his utmost to advocate for her release from the Thai prison.  I was pleased when he fought Daniel the sleazebucket, even if it was a really pathetic and silly sort of wrestling in the fountain.  But knowing the love and righteous anger on behalf of Bridget that motivated him, I thought it was touching.

I liked the proposal scene, and how Bridget insisted to do-over the proposal moment that had gotten ruined.  That was cute.  I'm glad it didn't end with Bridget and Darcy's wedding--hopefully they'll save that for a future sequel!",1111968000,7,1374,4.621399176954733

1521127,3,B00005JNDZ,"You ever have the kind of friend where for a long time you shake your head in admiration and then gradually realize you're shaking your head in despair? Bridget Jones would be a friend like that.

She's hopelessly lovable, and she's always going to be your friend no matter what, but, really, who but Bridget, with her guilt-ridden diary entries for alcohol and nicotine units per day, would manage to get jailed in Thailand on drug-smuggling charges?

Bridget of course is not a drug smuggler, but being Bridget she did the one thing no tourist should ever do, and that is to carry in her luggage a souvenir given to her girl friend by a guy. But Bridget has pluck. In no time at all, she's traded her pink bra for cigarettes, organized her prison inmates into a Madonna class, and they're rehearsing ""Like a Virgin.""

""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason"" is a jolly movie and I smiled pretty much all the way through, but it doesn't shift into high with a solid thunk the way ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" (2001) did. In the first movie, things happened to Bridget. In the sequel, Bridget happens to things.

As the story opens, Bridget is happily involved with Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), who to her astonishment became her boyfriend in the earlier film. Plump Bridget, in love with a hunk! She's still working as an on-air personality for a TV show which seems to be running its private version of ""Fear Factor"" just for Bridget; surely this girl is not ready to sky dive? Or ski? Or manage a romance without getting unreasonably jealous of the quality time Mark seems to be spending with his colleague Rebecca (Jacinda Barrett)? But she loves the guy. Who else could keep him standing outside her door while she finishes leaving a message for him on his answering machine? Especially when the message is, essentially, that he is standing outside even as she speaks?

Bridget depends as before on the wisdom of three friends whose advice is infallibly dangerous. They are Shazzer (Sally Phillips), Tom (James Callis) and Jude (Shirley Henderson), and they support her when she and Mark have a completely unreasonable fight. Bridget flies off to Thailand on assignment and discovers that her former boyfriend Daniel (Hugh Grant) is already there. This is a man she should never, ever, have anything to do with, but because she is mad at Mark she allows herself to be maneuvered into a position where Daniel can cry with glee: ""Please! Please be wearing the giant panties!""

Renee Zellweger is lovable to begin with, and combining her with Bridget Jones creates a critical mass of cuteness: You don't want to just watch her, you want to tickle her ears and scratch under her chin. She has that desperately hopeful smile, and the endearing optimism of a woman in a dress two sizes too small. When she embarrasses herself, it's big-time, as when she single-handedly causes Mark's table to lose the annual quiz at the Law Society Dinner.

The scenes in Thailand, it must be said, venture beyond contrivance. Bridget is the kind of woman who is more at home dealing with the sorts of things that could happen to anybody, like dropping a rock Cornish game hen down the front of her dress. She isn't made for cocaine busts. And it's a little mystifying why Daniel and Mark, two relatively important and successful men no longer in their first youth, have another brawl over her. Their motivation, I think, is that the fight in the first movie was so funny. Hugh Grant is so good at losing his dignity that we forget what skillful acting it requires to assure us he has any. Colin Firth plays the basically good guy, never a plum role; rascals always have more fun in comedies.

Standing back from ""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason,"" I can see that the perfection of the first film has been replaced here by a series of comic episodes that could as easily be about anything else. The movie doesn't have the dire necessity of Bridget 1's quest for true love. If we didn't know better, we'd suspect that Bridget 2 subtly engineers her way into pickles because she knows how cute she looks when she gets in trouble.

Still, at the end of the day, I left hoping there will be a Bridget 3. Long may she squint and bravely smile and keep tugging her neckline up and believe in love.",1111968000,4,4262,4.634437086092715

Bridgett is a bit more annoyingly stupid, but the movie is cute, and there's even more of Colin Firth.... to which I say hip, hip, hooray!  What a fabulous actor.  His character is so totally different from Hugh Grant's that sometimes Mark Darcy can seem really boring and dull.  The love scenes with Hugh Grant & Renee Zellwegger were definitely much steamier than the airtime between Firth & Zellwegger.

I don't know why this movie didn't do better at the box office.  Our only comments negatively, are that the star, Renee Zellwegger did not look as cute as she did in the first movie, and she is perhaps even chubbier and less attractive, and sillier and bubble-headed.

This was apparent in Love Actually which just rehashed all the most popular scenes from his earlier movies and this Bridget Jones sequel is just a reheated version of the first movie. The plotlines are the same - Bridget torn between reserved, uptight, underpant folding lawyer boyfriend Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) and raffish Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) who gets all the best lines and, as in the first movie, has far more sex appeal as a cocky, funny womaniser. Bridget obviously finds him irresistable but he keeps blowing his chances with her due his nymphomaniac sex life (in the first movie, his American fiancee got in the way, in this movie he is just about to close the deal when the Thai prostitute he ordered enters his hotel room, prompting the film's funniest line 'I'm up for it if you are' to the unimpressed Bridget). Apart from Hugh Grant the rest of the movie is just a padded out unrolling of the on off romance between Bridget and Mark. Even the actors come across uninspired by the script. Zellweger appears less kookily sparky than in the movie and Colin Firth looks as if he is bored and embarrased with his part (he has publicly admitted that he never wants to act in another Bridget Jones movie). Richard Curtis's material used to be original (when Four Weddings and a Funeral came out eleven years ago) but now his writing resembles a busker playing the same tired old tunes, keeping going only because the money keeps rolling in. Like all film genres, romantic comedies evolve. Curtis's conservative, trite, cliched offerings should make way for more creative, original productions.",1111968000,,1662,4.8350877192982455

The first movie was downright a keeper for life, so it was hard to imagine them re-creating the same atmosphere and level of hilarity as the first. While there are parts that are omited from the book and replaced with other situations,it is understandable why. For example,Cleaver is hardly in The Edge of Reason, but he's in the movie for a fair amount. Another involves her trip to Thailand.
All the original actors/actresses are back which is key to pulling off a authentic sequel. The music, situations, ""Bridgetisms"" are all wonderful, if not at times better than before. And it is rewarding to know that her interview with Colin Firth did not go overlooked. Can't wait till I have enough money to buy this DVD and upgrade the original from VHS to DVD.

1521153,3,B00005JNDZ,"While watching the second 'Bridget Jones' film, about 15 minutes in, I realized that the sequel is not going to be the same kind of romantic comedy.  In short, more comedy and less romance.  Not that the film is bad; it's surely amusing to see it, but in a very different way.  Though the actors are as energetic as ever, slapsticks take the place of the original's character-driven story.

When the film starts, we see happy Bridget.  Good for her, but then we remember another Bridget of the original, so miserable in her family's annual Christmas turkey curry buffet.  And then, because of her misery so convincing, we related to her character immediately.  It was a magical touch, which the new film fatally lacks.  Instead, the second film gives us a parody of one classic musical, and a sketch of Bridget's awfully botched TV report among dirty pigs in a dirty pigsty ... oh dear.

I am not saying the film is not funny (people were laughing in the theatre, I can tell you).  There are many funny moments in this new 'Bridget Jones' film.  I'm just saying that the film has nothing to add to the original's story that ended four years ago.  Why did they have to make this film anyway?

Actually, if there is a good reason to make this sequel, it's to see again perpetual womanizer Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) and listen to his devilishly sweet and hilarious talk, which is, he is clearly aware, total nothing.  Hugh Grant has a strange talent of giving irresistible charms to very empty words, which cast a spell on us too.

Compared  with him, the love story of Mark and Bridget are not very intersting.  The film shows, Mark and Bridget must overcome another misunderstanding, but that's exactly they were doing about four years ago.  The writers couldn't find anything new to write about in this new diary, and the film fails to produce the original's natural and spontaneous feelings between them.  And the idea of ""Bridget in Thailand"" and the 'Brokendown Place'-like story is never the right material for the heroine whose delectable personality is most effective when coupled with the British middle-class values, not on the tropical beach.

The second 'Bridget' is not all slapsticks -- thanks to four screenwriters including Andrew Davies ('Pride and Prejudice') and Richard Curtis ('Love Actually'), and sure, the dialogues become sometimes lively, but just sometimes.  You probably will notice Richard Curtis's touch, when Bridget mistakes 'Iran' for a person's name.  But witty jokes and intelligence are hard to find in this (unwittingly) ironically titled 'The Edge of Reason.'

The film is funny to some extent, but that's because Renee Zellweger, Colin Firth, and especially Hugh Grant are doing good job.  The unkind camera often captures the chubby face of Bridget and that's done tactlessly, but thanks to Renee Zellweger the scenes remain watchable.  The gifted players keep the film rolling, and as romantic comedy 'Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason' is entertaining, but not as much as the original.",1111881600,2,3027,4.911417322834645

I loved the first Bridget Jones--the heroine was lovable because, while she wasn't a moron, she had foibles and encountered pitfalls that made the ordinary person able to relate to her. And there were some genuinely funny scenes that combined insight into character with physical humor.  Sad to say, the sequel has none of this.  Bridget is made to appear so unattractive that, unlike the first time around, one finds it hard to see what on earth Mark Darcy OR Daniel Cleaver see in her.  Moreover, her brain seems to have departed completely and she does things that are not only stupid but indicate that she doesn't learn anything from previous debacles, which is not the Bridget of the first movie.  Overall, the whole thing appears to be a group of not-very-funny pratfalls and idiotic scenes strung together without much rhyme or reason just to give us a second round of Bridget Does Thailand/ Ski Slope/ Elegant Dinner Party in hopes that we will bear her enough carried over good will to watch it.

1521157,3,B00005JNDZ,"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason is the sequel to the popular Bridget Jones's Diary (2001) that conveys Bridget Jones' (Rene Zellweger) most intimate thoughts and feelings in her diary.  This time the audience is introduced to her new diary, which opens with the happiness and joy that Bridget experiences through her love life.  Everything seems to be perfect, as her boyfriend Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), a human rights lawyer, provides the most delicious escapades in the bedroom, at least according to Bridget, who willingly shares this with her diary and people she meets.  This sharing of secrets becomes a little repetitive as the film moves along.

Preoccupation with obsessive dreaming of Mark affects her life, as she thoughtlessly steps into trouble and embarrassment.  This embarrassment further increases her already strong insecurities.  Insecurity then leads to situations where she begins to question Mark's honesty, loyalty, and love for her through assumptions that she makes based on information inflamed with jealousy.  She could be a poster child for insecurity, as she continuously questions Mark's integrity and in the end only hurts herself.

In the middle of her predicaments regarding her relationship with Mark she once again meets the sly womanizer Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) who is the anchor for a TV travel program called ""The Smooth Guide.""  The TV station that Bridget works for wants to make the program more accessible for a wider audience and suggests that she becomes a co-host on ""The Smooth Guide.""  Initially Bridget refuses, but as expected, she gives in.  Their first episode together is to be shot in Thailand, and Bridget brings one of her friends to help chaperone her.

When they arrive in Thailand Daniel turns up his charm and tries to sway Bridget to give him a second chance, however, Bridget is cautious as she was once hurt before.  This happens while Bridget's friend hooks up with a younger man who asks her to bring home a gift from England when they are about to leave.  The nave Bridget thinks she is going to be helpful, but she has evidently never seen Bangkok Hilton (1989), Return to Paradise (1998), and Brokedown Palace (1999), which would make her a lot more cautious.  Just as in these other films there are drugs in the item that she is to bring to England, and she is sent to a Thai prison.  Who could help her get out of prison?  Well, that might not be a surprise to the audience, as they will see this film unfold.

Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason delivers a cinematic experience full of obvious stereotypes that are turned into slapstick moments.  Furthermore, the film attempts to make fun of Bridget's lack of knowledge and insecurities, which occasionally work, but frequently lead into awkward and confusing moments where the audience does not know whether to feel sorry for Bridget or to laugh at her.  As if it was not enough, the film uses clichs that have been seen in similar films many times before throughout several decades, and this enhances the predictability of the story.  Ultimately, this sequel falls way short of the accomplishments made in the initial film.

As mentioned, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason falls short compared to the first film, yet the film has its funny moments.  Those who are Rene Zellweger fans might want to see this film, as her performance is actually remarkable.  However, overall this film is only a mediocre romantic comedy that is worth renting on an evening when the audience feels that they need to put things in perspective in regards to relationships and love.",1111622400,3,3587,4.920265780730897

""Bridget Jones' Diary"" is a wonderful film, sweet, sexy, full of pathos, humor, and yes a bit of the absurd.  The sequel is not up the prequel, but I think it is two different films in one.  The first part oscillates wildly between edginess and slapstick, disconnected scenes which seem to exist only to convince us that Bridget is horribly conflicted.  It is also terribly predictable.  Then, entirely unpredictably, the film reverts to the format that made the prequel so good.  Bridget's struggles enchant the viewer, and a mild surprise enlivens the film.  I give it four stars because the second part is so good, though I understand why others would give it only two or three stars.  The music, BTW, is very good.",1111622400,,813,4.716312056737588

The film begins nearly right where the first left off, which was a plus, for so many of us were curious to see where the romance of the heroine, Bridget, and her new beax, Mark Darcy, would lead. It quickly loses steam and SENSE from then on. Why?  Gone are the ""insightful"" reflections of Bridget that lead us to care about her in the film.  In its place are a few ill-matched diary-esque insights amidst a series of odd (a Thai prison, are you kidding me?) situations or the stereotypical social scene (Mark's lawyer's ball).  In an effort to make us laugh, Bridget is thrown out of plane, a ski lift, and is subjected to drugs, water puddles, and hair and make-up mishaps.  Also missing was the clever infiltration of Bridget's parents (they have a very minor role this time) who really livened up the first film.

When a cast of the order including Jim Broadbent, Gemma Jones, Hugh Grant,  Colin Firth, Renee Zellweger, and Jacinda Barrett, there must be a reason for this group to consent to participate in this mindless mess.  Money, I suppose, because there doesn't appear to be another reason.  The script is poor at best, the 'fat actress' concept and poor accent that besiege Renee Zellweger's attempt to create a credible comic character is ludicrous, and the obvious big budget/multi-location squandering of production costs is shameful.  Sad that there is an audience for this type of film.  Maybe others can be entertained by this escapist route, but the smarmy digs at characters embedded in lesbian or Thai prisoner roles etc are in poor taste and definitely not funny.

Bridgette is a revolting, wanton, fat, stupid woman doing her best to somehow replicate on the silver screen the fatuous feats that one might have done in childhood. The story is pointless. The main character is everything a man hates in a woman; desperate and annoying and wholly lacking any kind of confidence in herself. She says infantile things on the phone to her boyfriend and does all she can to be as outrageously facile as possible in public.  The jokes are stale and any purpose is completely lacking.

The film devolves into a series of scenes documenting how irritating she is. One is forced to put up with that tragically common English expression shag' again and again. The `shags' her bloke, her friends and old boyfriends all `shag', and she has `shag flashbacks'. It is all drivel and unbearable dross. She is a modern nightmare. I failed, I guess, to see the point. Is she supposed to be the defiant voice of the disenfranchised women in modern England? If so, it is a voice not worth hearing.

I am not sure who would enjoy this. Fat women with no friends who want to feel that other people are even more pathetic than themselves? Perhaps. Do yourself a favour.

The movie is what fans of Bridget have waited for-

What happens after happily ever after we all wonder when we see the end to any movie and in this one we get the chance to see a piece of what becomes between the buff Bridget and her ""perfect"" boyfriend Mark-- who folds his underwear before he goes to sleep. In this reality strikes their relationship as Bridget and Mark deal with snobby/single friends, lesbian kisses, Thai prisons, break-ups, family, weekends spent away together, and work-- also a beautiful young secretary with long legs who happens to work with Mark. Of course, as in any squel there is a comeback by Daniel Cleaver who everywhere Bridget turns manages to see his face as he has just landed himself his own television show and is the same as ever-- and still going after Bridget. Can Bridget and Mark manage to survie??? Well I think we all know the answer to that.

Colin Firth is more charming in this as Mark Darcy than he was in the first and of course, Renee does a wonderful job as the buff Brit who never seems to get anything right. Hugh Grant is davishly evil and once again you see that wonderful on-screen rivalry between Hugh and Firth.

This was the film I have been waiting for after seeing the words ""the beginning"" in Bridget Jone's Diary... and I loved seeing Bridg and Mark together. I found myself swooning after Mark who likes Bridget-- ""likes her just the way she is""--wobbly bits included... what girl dosn't want a man like Mark?

1521291,3,B00005JNDZ,"Renee Zellweger was brave to sign onto this film.

Reneez Zellweger was so concerned about making the sequel that she even rejected the first script.  The second script must have been good, but the director's cut was three hours long. The actors and actressed walked away, leaving the dilemma of what to cut to the editor. Who made a complete and total hash of it.

So many story-lines began in the beginning of the film that needed to be closed in the last hour, that, in the last thirty minutes, Renee's character is seen running from event to event at a dizzying pace.  Case in point is the lesbian affair that was well-publicized prior to the opening of the movie.  It comes down to a hasty peck and an 'okay?!' before Bridget runs off to her next hasty resolution moment.  Ditto for the famous fight scene redux, apologies to friends who left her hanging in Thailand, etc.

Renee Zellweger was brave to sign up for this film for another reason: the character of the novel is not in a likeable stage of life.  She is whiny, neurotic, unreasonable, unhappy, and unaware of her responsibility for her behavior until near the end of the film.  True to the novel, and true to life.  But it's hard to watch an unlikeable character for nearly two hours unless something else about her is likeable--beauty perhaps?  And once again, Zellweger was let down.  This time by the director of photography.  Who made a total hash of her.

I went back to Bridget 1 and checked out the lighting and set design.  Zellweger is nearly always found in a favorable background set of soft blues with touches of red and much indirect, magic lighting.  With precisely the same poundage on her, she manages to look beautiful. Compare this to Bridget 2.  Harsh lighting, lots of yellow tones, really atrocious focus on her midriff, which was never, once exposed in Bridget 1.

1521292,3,B00005JNDZ,"Don't buy this movie, as you'll just regret wasting your money on a film that's not up to scratch as the original. Get it for your birthday, Christmas, or hint that you want it, but can't find it cheap enough, and some nice person will buy it for you.

I wasn't expecting much from this movie, although I ended up watching it straight away, just to see what it was like. I already knew it wasn't going to be a patch on the original, and it was going to be totally different from the book. What I noticed was how different Bridget was from the movie. She was slightly attractive in the first movie, but in this, Renee had awful stylists etc. Her hair was a mess a lot of the time, and she had hamster cheeks. And what was equally distracting was the fact she was poured into really low cut tops a lot of the time. We all know that when Renee's not being Bridget she's ultra skinny, but in this she just wanted to flaunt her chest as much as possible! At least 50% of the world's population, if not more, have them dear, there's no need to shove them in our faces! And as for the lesbian kiss - what was the point in that, apart from the fact it was a cheap thrill for the guys? There was absolutely no need for it.

So the film is very different from the book. Bearing in mind, I haven't read the book in a few years, so don't quote me on this. The Thai jail scene is a lot longer, and more tougher in the book. There's no Like A Virgin singalongs in that! And Bridget lost a lot of weight during her time in there (in the book), but she looked just the same when she came out. The first book was not-so-loosely based on Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"". The first movie left a lot of that in, and even included a lot of ""inside jokes"" for those of us who are familiar with the book and the filmed version starring Colin Firth as Fitzwilliam Darcy. ""The Edge of Reason"" was not-so-loosely based on another Jane Austen novel, ""Persuasion,"" but any overt Austen references are completely wiped out here. Also, in the second book, Bridget had to interview the God in her life, Colin Firth. That would have been slightly difficult since Colin Firth is already in the movie playing of course Mark Darcy. I'm pretty sure this scene might be among the extras, but not included in the movie. Of course, they could have always done an Oceans 12, and had Colin Firth playing Mark Darcy playing Colin Firth. The mind boggles.

Some of the movie is funny - the skiing scenes gave me flashbacks of my own skiing incidents (including dragging the instructor down the slope with me cos I was so scared), and yet again, the hair-pulling, and eye gouging between Colin Firth & Hugh Grant. But apart from that, there's nothing else that funny about the movie. It's watchable. It just doesn't have the same class as the original. At least with the second book, Helen Fielding attempted to move away from her original work, and have some fun with Bridget. This movie sticks closely to the first, with no surprises thrown in.

Bridget's friends have a lesser part in this than the first, and they were hilarious in the first! There is also another 'friend' added who's never really introduced, but just hovering in the background.

A lot of this movie is meant to be spent watching with a group of girlie friends, in your PJs, drinking wine, and having pillow fights. Why? Mainly because every other scene is backed by an overly loud soundtrack, featuring a lot of the songs that funnily enough on the soundtrack to the movie!!! Funnily enough, there is also a lot of drunken ballads to be sung at the top of your voice, like the ""All By Myself"" at the start of the first movie. Talk about over publicising the soundtrack to the movie! Also, there's a lot of product placement in this movie: Coca Cola, Vodaphone, BMI and probably more that I missed. It's very noticable product placement, not just subtle.

This film picks up where Bridget Jones's Diary left off; Bridget (Renee Zellwieger)is happily in a relationship with the lovely Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), and trying to figure out how to keep it going strong despite the obvious differences in their careers, backgrounds and general dispositions.

Yes, she's insecure and quick to jump to conclusions, but on the whole, I thought the writers handled her (and his) reactions very well.

In the middle of all this angst comes Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), who hasn't changed a bit despite his promise to having been reformed. As luck would have it he's now working at the same TV station as Bridget, and as double luck would have it Mark Darcy has a new, beautiful assistant.

So here we have the basic premise which, of course equals many potential problems.

Some of the slapstick does get a bit out there, such as her jumping from an airplane right into a pig pen (what's the chances of that happening I wonder?), or when she slides off of Mark's roof and suffers nothing worse than some plantlife stuck in her hair. But, all in all, these are two of the most irresistable characters in movies today, and I personally find all of this worry and insecurity rather...well, sexy.

By the way, as much as some other reviewers have obsessed on Bridget's weight, and been most insulting to the rest of us while doing it (you mean a woman who's not a perfect size 5 can't be loved?), I thought she looked very good. Even at 130 lbs., she displays a curvaciousness that up until the last thirty years would have been considered the norm and not just ""fat"".

The other point I'd like to make is that contrary to those reviewers who said that Daniel was not even in the 2nd book, check again. Although his part is small, he not only IS included, he gets punched in the mouth by our dear Darcy (well done, Mark!).

All in all, I found this movie delightful, and am anticipating the DVD with high hopes.",1106697600,10,2315,4.597087378640777
1521295,1,B00005JNDZ,"Completely lacking in the originality and humor of the book, this is a sad sequel to a charming movie.

Reading both of Ms. Jone's diarys, we see that Bridget isn't fat, she just thinks she is. The one time she reaches her goal of 119 lbs, she looks emaciated and aged. The film ignores this and makes her a porker of epic proportions.

The best parts of Ms. Fielding's book center around Bridget's relationships with her friends, single and married. The film completely ignores this aspect, instead bringing back the tired love triangle between Bridget, Mark and Daniel.

If Amazon had a negative star option, I'd give this sad sequel -20 stars.

1521296,3,B00005JNDZ,"Did this movie really need to be made? The first movie was fresh, funny and cute.  The sequel however, is annoying, not funny and lacks charm.  No longer is Bridget funny and charming, she is just an embarrassment to watch.

The sequel starts out ok, but quickly relies on subplot after subplot to keep the viewer interested.  This actually made the film rather annoying as you constantly had to focus on yet another storyline happening.  Perhaps the director could tell the film wasn't working and wrote in more subplots.

To me, the main problem with the film is that Bridget is no longer funny. You can only stretch the fat jokes so far. Also, the scene where she stormed into Darcy's chambers with a wet dress and hair was just too far fetched and not credible.  It was supposed to be funny, but ended up being a poor attempt by the Director to make us believe that a man of Darcy's calibre would be interested in a woman who storms in when he is in a meeting with his colleagues.  A similar scene occurs in the first ten minutes of the film.

Hugh Grant's brief appearance in the film was an attempt to recapture the magic of the first. It failed. He was annoying in this film because he didn't fit in this time around.

Overall, 2004's most eagerly awaited film turned out to be 2004's most disappointing film.  Please, do not make a third installment.",1105315200,3,1358,4.479674796747967

I love Grant and Firth in other movies I had seen them in.  And usually love Zellwegger but something about her accent turned me off.  Once I started the movie I was extremely thankful that they gave an overview of the first movie so I didn't feel lost and I thought all the characters clicked well.  I also loved the fact that she had gained weight for the role and honestly she looked better--but she waddled.  Annoying.  She was hillarious as she reminded me of my friends and I in her quest for love.  Something always seems to go wrong.  Which turns into a good movie plot.

The sequel continues where the first movie left off with Bridget now together with her boyfriend Marc Darcy. Hugh Grant is of course back as Daniel Cleaver adding complications to Bridget's life.

Although this movie is probably not as good as the Bridget Jones Diary, it is still a great movie. Many funny situations like when Bridget finds herself in jail, trades her bra for some cigarettes and rehearses 'Like a Virgin' with the other inmates.

1521361,2,B00005JNDZ,"The original Bridget Jones' Diary committed so many Book-To-Film conversion crimes that it's impossible to know where to begin - it changed events, omitted things, cast an American in the role of British Poster Girl for Singletons, etc - but for all of that, it was an excellent and thoroughly enjoyable movie, full of the same kind of bittersweet humour and zany slapstick that has made the novel such a seminal classic.

The book ""Edge of Reason"", while perhaps not in the same league as the original, is still an excellent read, and Helen Fielding's wry observationism and witty sarcasm are as vibrant as ever before. Sad, then, that this movie adaptation of that novel lacks almost all of the warmth and wit of the book, replacing it instead with schmaltz and tired stereotyping, histrionic set-pieces and truly predictable comedy.

Bridget is now in a relationship with Mark Darcey and the Daniel Cleaver affair seems to be well and truly behind her. Her career is going well and her friends are jealous. So far, so good. Suddenly, she and Mark break up, she and Daniel are sent to Thailand together, she's framed for cocaine smuggling, and unless her friend Shazzer can alert Mark in time, it'll all end in tears.

Except after the first thirty minutes or so, the sugary sweetness and blind mundanity of the movie we just don't care how it ends.

Zellwegger's accent and performance mannerisms are once more flawless in their British impersonation, and she does what she can with a truly uninspiring script. Firth as Mark Darcey is the same as before, except now almost totally one-dimensional, lacking any of the depth of either the novel or the original movie. Hugh Grant as Daniel Cleaver is now a totally transparent character, and the movie-invented TV show he hosts does not serve any purpose other than to showcase his soullessness - a trait which we were already well aware of, why underline it here? - and at the movie's end we do find ourselves wondering what the point of including him in the screenplay was.

Not that these are bad actors, you understand - this is the fault of a lousy script that relies far too heavily on schmaltzy emotion and a gross underestimation of the audiences' intelligence levels. Devoid of all subtlety and warmth, the movie  rattles on to a cheesy and predictable close, but by that stage, you may well have switched off before the inexorable happy ending.

One to avoid, read the novel instead.",1103673600,5,2443,4.788598574821853
1521362,2,B00005JNDZ,"Tours of duty in ""Chicago"" and ""Cold Mountain"" have moved Renee Zellweger past the Bridget Jones character, and it shows on her moony, perturbed face in ""The Edge of Reason."" It's a sequel of absurd slapstick - in contrast to the mannered comedy of the original ""Diary,""  -  and sitcom trappings need jolts of inspired whimsy. But Hugh Grant drops by for a only cup of coffee and Colin Firth, as the constipated Marc Darcy, wraps himself in even more discomfort than he did in ""Diary.""

That leaves Zellweger, who grinned and cried and stuffed herself into max support bras with zeal her first go round, earning nominations and perverse recognition for size swapping. Now, it's paycheck time, and little more, and no wonder Zellweger shed her chunky monkey physique so quickly post-production: She plays one miserable character. This is not the Jones you'd want to know.

Director Beeban Kidron has designed ""Edge of Reason"" to make Bridget not a heroine but a lightning rod of unappealing, embarrassing sequences - in a pig slop, at Marc's lawyer ball, on the ski slopes, in, yes, a Thai prison (where the girls shrug off their communal, disease-ridden existence for an impromptu rendition of Madonna's ""Like A Virgin."")

What was it again that was so special about Ms. Jones? Is staring at someone as they sleep really that endearing a trait? How about suffering three increasingly annoying, meddling friends? Kidron seems to have forgotten Bridget's plucky cuteness - there isn't one scene in ""Edge of Reason"" where Zellweger is allowed to look, well, attractive for very long without being drenched or slopped or having her hair ruined.",1103500800,9,1640,4.970802919708029
1521363,2,B00005JNDZ,"Movies usually don't turn out better than the books they are based upon. Movie sequels, unless part of a trilogy, rarely turn out better than the original movies. However, movie sequels based upon book sequels usually turn out better (see THE LOST WORLD for example). BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON isn't one of those cases. In fact, it's the exact opposite. This movie is an example of what happens when you make a copy of a copy a couple of times over. The original film adaptation of BRIDGET JONES was a joy to watch and in many ways improved upon the original novel. However, the book sequel was a disappointment and this movie sequel is a pure disaster. The film is one of the worst movies I have seen in a theatre in a long time and if it wasn't for the presence of Colin Firth, it wouldn't be worth watching ever.

The first film stayed fairly close to the novel. This movie doesn't. That's not necessarily bad, especially seeing that the novel's sequel is inferior to the original writing as well. However, the way the filmmakers chose to veer away from the novel's plot is just so wrong. From the commuted stay and sentence in Thailand with very little background information to the turning of Bridget's nemesis Rebecca into a lesbian out to seduce her and not Mark Darcy to the complete disappearance of certain important events, situations, and people (e.g. naked housekeeper's son, the party at the summer house, Wellington) the book rarely uses the original text as an outline. Like I mentioned before, that's not necessarily bad, but instead of straying away from the text to improve upon it, the book swerves completely away.

Then of course there are all the extras that were added. Supposedly to make the script more interesting: Bridget trying to buy a pregnancy test somewhere in, Austria I guess. Or how about the fistfight between Colin Firth and Hugh Grant--the only reason that scene is even in the movie is so the directors could have some excuse to have Colin Firth fall in a fountain of water again and get soaking wet so that the ladies of England would lick their lips. Scenes like these add nothing to the story whatsoever. Not only that, they aren't even funny; not in a typical American-type ha-ha-funny, not in the usual droll British guffaw type funny. The only people who would get a serious laugh out of those scenes are people who aren't going to be watching the movie (the REAL WORLD/MTV crowed will be watching things like AMERICAN PIE, not BRIDGET JONES) to begin with. So why even bother to putt them in as filler?

Besides all that, there's also the actors' enthusiasm. In the first movie, everyone seemed liked the must have really had a good time making the movie. In THE EDGE OF REASON, everyone but Colin Firth seems like they are just there to pick up a paycheck. Renee Zellweger is a very talented actress who is one of my favorites and one an Oscar nod for her first performance. In this movie, Zellweger appears as though all the weight gaining/loosing/gaining and other physical demands she has placed upon herself have gotten to her. Bridget no longer seems perky and adorable, but down and almost pathetic. Colin Firth does the best job out of all the actors, but even he at times seems like he's just walking through the paces following the tape on the floor. It just goes to show, if you're going to copy a copy of a copy of a copy, change it up a little bit and make it more original. Originality can be a lifesaver because Colin Firth isn't always going to be around.",1102982400,,3526,4.602543720190779

That is what is refreshing about this movie.

1521365,4,B00005JNDZ,"I never had a sister, but Bridget Jones would be the one I wish I had even if only for the entertainment value.

In BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON, our heroine (Renee Zellweger) is an on-air personality for a British telly that specializes in pseudo-journalism. In the first sequence of scenes, Bridget reports live as she parachutes from a plane into a pigpen's excremental bog. Consistent with this, her life is pretty much of a total disaster except for an ongoing affair with a high-powered amnesty lawyer, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), about whom she dreamily counts the days, hours and minutes of their relationship as well as the number of times they've ""shagged"". The wildcards are Rebecca (Jacinda Barrett), Darcy's assistant, both elegant and gorgeous - attributes not to be associated with Jones - with whom Mark may also be dallying, and Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), an old boyfriend who still lusts after what's inside Bridget's ""giant panties"".

Bridget's engaging persona is established in BRIDGET JONES DIARY (2001). Though the original was perhaps a better film, neither it (nor this one) are the comedic fluff of which indelible cinematic memories are made. Therefore, by default and my failing memory, THE EDGE OF REASON must stand on its own merits. (Perhaps the two are best seen together when they're eventually released as a DVD set.) In any case, I've always had an objection to any appearance by Colin Firth, which always results in an on-screen character, in my opinion, totally devoid of charm or humor. Perhaps he reminds me to much of myself:>) (Only in a 1996 film adaptation of Jane Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE did this formula work for me.) Hugh Grant, here a charming rascal that could well be my alter ego, has only a subordinate role. Too bad.

Bridget certainly has pluck, best depicted when, after being arrested in Bangkok for drug smuggling, she becomes the song coach and darling of a jail cell-full of Thai prostitutes . Ok, ok, that subplot was a bit of a stretch by the screenwriters, but it works for her. My biggest problem with Jones is that I can't see her in a romantic (or even prurient light), so her triangular relationship with Darcy and Cleaver remains, for me, unconvincing. It's a chemistry thing.

I hope Zellwegger, at the risk of being typecast, consents to do another episode in the series. Despite my reservations and chemical imbalance, they're good fun.",1102550400,,2415,4.897310513447433

Then again, all is not lost. Renee Zewellger really lights up the screen. It's amaizng how she again put on those kilos to appear in the movie and her British slang is quite as real as it can get. Her paranoid and neurotic antics continue in Edge of Reason and she still keeps her diary but now she seems to have it all, the perfect man and the perfect job. Colin Firth reprises his role as a stern and unromantic man who manages to snarl Bridget's hear while Hugh Grant is still the philandering man who keeps up his pursuit of Bridget and ends up fighting for the lady.

The ridiculous part of the movie, incidentally also quite enjoyable, is when Bridget is sent to a Thai jail for drug trafficking and she ends up teaching the girls sing Like A Virgin, lambasting about their bad boyfriends and giving them wonder bras. Unbelivable twist in the plot, but made enyoable by Zewellger's sponataneous acting.

1521367,3,B00005JNDZ,"Is Renee Zellweger a decent actress? Some people either love her or hate her. Yes, she did get Marcia Gay Harden's (Mystic River) Oscar for Cold Mountain, but like a late comedian, she still ain't got no respect. In Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, she proves that she's a fine actress who can expertly portray the insecure title character, overcoming a weaker story line than the original Bridget Jones' Diary.

The new film picks up six weeks after the first. Bridget, suffering what seems to be a 24/7 inadequacy attack, breaks up with laywer/beau Mark. Just then, as it does in the hundreds of Bridget Jones type stories/novels (with titles like More Than My Heart Dropped to the Floor or The Goddess of Terminal Guilt) a new paramour drops in, Daniel, (Hugh Grant), who plays the biker dude to Mark's stuffy homebody. Bridget will have to choose between the two men, a trip to Thailand, and, oh yes, of how insecure she wants to be for the rest of her life.

The beautiful thing about Renee Zellweger as Bridget Jones is her typicalness. She's fat, makes social gafes and is forever talking to herself.

I have seen it 3 times and enjoyed it more with subsequent viewings. My husband who hates chick flicks also loved it. The audience laughed and cheered throughout the movie and everyone left the film with a smile on their faces. How many movies do that?

I read the book and I personally think that the film is orders of magnitude better. The story is tighter, with much less of Bridget's friends and mother (thank God!). The acting is first rate: Renee IS Bridget, Hugh Grant is at his sleazy best and what to say about Colin Firth - fabulous! Firth delivers an amazing spot-on performance which really exposes Darcy's difficulties dealing with emotions and how he eventually manages to get past them to fight for the woman he loves. My only quibble is that Colin Firth could have had more screen time. He did however, have more time than in the first film. (I am biased, being a huge fan.)

1521400,2,B00005JNDZ,"Something happened between this film and the original that I just cannot put my finger on. Was it the actors feeling like they were too comfortable in their roles? Maybe. Was it the unchallenging story that fell too clearly into a clichd moment than a fun film? Maybe. Was it the random exploits of our character that pulled us away from her and into a world that we were unfamiliar with? Maybe. Was it the lackluster music that filled my ears with pain instead of enjoyment? Maybe. It could possibly be one of these options or all of them, but when I walked out of the theater, I didn't feel the same excitement as I did when I walked out of the theater for the first one. Bridget had changed (or maybe it was me, but for the sake of argument I will say Bridget), and it wasn't for the better.

Let me explain my four points from above a bit clearer to see if anyone can help me discover what went wrong in Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason. First, the comfort level of the actors. To begin, did Renee look bigger in this film. In the first film she was plump-cute, in this film she seems just plump-plump. She seemed to just stroll through her lines not giving us half the emotion or excitement as she did in the original. Instead of building upon Bridget Jones, Zellweger just gave us a recycled version of the original Bridget Jones, jokes and all. She was just the same as the original. Nothing new was created, but more was destroyed. Firth was equally as bad (GASP for me to say that), but he just never came out of his shell. In the original I wanted Jones to be with him by the end and in this film I just didn't care. He felt and seemed cold-hearted, even in all of his emotional moments. I wanted his character to be over-the-top instead of under-the-weather. Finally, there was Hugh Grant, so literally just didn't care about this film at all. There was no passion in his eyes or any magic in his words. Together this troupe made an unfunny film where they attempted to pull everything back from the original. The book was not the same as the original, so why should this be?

This leads me into my second point regarding the unchallenging story. It seemed and felt as if Zellweger was falling her paces instead of leading her character. The events that surrounded her seemed so surreal that I never really felt as if they were happening to her. Somewhere near the center of this film we go from personal story to fantasy. The fact that the director could only tell us with Darcy did for Jones proved that money and creativity were lacking in this sequel. The director obviously did not have a very good grasp on this film, and it was obvious from the beginning to the end. The entire Rebecca moments were laughable and unemotional. I needed a dramedy instead of a silly-goofy film. Who felt as if the fight between Darcy and Cleaver was two men looking to get paid instead of act. Why was this scene even in this film? I can tell you why, it is because women love Firth and Grant fighting and the studio executives wanted to pull those same women back into the audience. Well, couldn't we be more original and find someone else to fight? Apparently not as we are forced to uncomfortably sit through two hours of repetitive motions that we had already seen from the original. URG!

Third and I know this is something that we probably couldn't avoid because it was in the book, but the change of scenery was pointless. I like Jones in her environment, London, it allows her humor to come from inside instead of from her 'wacky' expeditions. The ski trip moment was horrible. I even felt awkward throughout it. It just showed me that there was more money and more ability to travel. Did anyone else seem to notice that the prison seemed awfully glossed over? This is built another level to disappointment that I was already feeling from this film. Why did we have to butcher a great character with sight gags? Bridget Jones is not a sight gag person, it is her uncanny passion that makes her funny, not putting her butt in pig feces.

Finally, there was the music. In the original the music complimented the film. In Edge of Reason, it only detracts us from the film. It is the most random chaotic choices encountered in a film. From classic oldies to modern pop, Bridget Jones changed before my own eyes as a wanna-be music video and platform for those that want to get ahead. If it was going to be a repetitive film like the first was, where was 'It's Raining Men'. That would have at least made me chuckle. Instead, there was some American-ized Christina Aguleria/Pink wanna-be blasting her song in this very British film. Chalk this one up to yet another disaster brought about by this director. Did she even see the original? The music failed in this sequel, causing a distressed viewer run back and rewatch the original.

Overall, this was a horrible remake. Jen seemed to feel the same, but still found it enjoyable to purchase when it is released. I felt as if there was something missing. Bridget Jones is not one that needs to change for a new generation, and I felt this is what director Beeban Kidron did. She tried to make her perkier, plumper, and hipper. Bridget Jones is a character that is supposed to speak to women in the audience by her awkward behavior and passion for love, but instead what I witnessed (and I think the women will agree) was an actress packing on more weight than needed to gain the sympathy of anyone in the audience. She put no emotion behind her character, nor did anyone else involved. This felt like a painful sequel, and it was obvious that nobody was fully behind it.

1521401,3,B00005JNDZ,"At the end of ""Bridget Jones' Diary,"" sweet, sexy, clumsy, confused Bridget had at last fulfilled her dreams.

She found her ideal man in Mark Darcy. She stopped being a dreaded singleton. She became a TV journalist. She finally accepted herself as she was - the 20 extra pounds, the cigarettes, the alcohol units and all. She grew up.

But wait a minute. Did she? In ""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason,"" the old Bridget is back, confused and silly as ever, and wearing yet more stupid hats and questionable sweaters.

And with her, the old movie is back. Nearly intact. The producers might be selling ""The Edge of Reason"" as a sequel, but it is so close to the original, in details large and small, that it could be considered the industry's fastest remake to date - three years and change.

The movie takes place a mere six weeks after the end of the first. Bridget (Renee Zellweger) is swooningly in love with Mark (Colin Firth), who adores her in return. For some reason, though, she is still insecure. She suspects he might be cheating on her, which leads to a few pratfalls as she spies on him.

Then - hurrah! as Bridget might say -Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) turns up and turns Bridget's head once again with his sly, seductive humor. They wind up in Thailand together, which could be considered new, but is actually just a change of scenery, since Bridget, of course, gets herself into embarrassing trouble there as easily as in London.

For those who enjoy more of the same, it's a likable enough, light entertainment. Zellweger is still adorable, and Grant is still the funniest thing in the movie. But the second time around, the flaws that we easily overlooked in the first movie are more visible and are suddenly incredibly annoying.

Chief among them is Bridget herself, and what makes her annoying lies in the difference between the Bridget of the books and the Bridget of the movies. In the books, Bridget goes through all manner of humiliations, but the key is that she is writing about them, and so they come to us filtered through her quite wicked, even sophisticated wit. In the movies, Bridget does not get to ""tell"" her story; she is the object of the stories, and so all we see are the stupid humiliations without the mitigating wit.

In short, she looks not like a wit, but like a nitwit. And so, as Bridget stumbles from stupid gaffe to humiliating mistake to embarrassing outburst, just as you're supposed to think, ""Oh, how cute,"" instead you're thinking, ""Does she have the IQ of an inflatable doll?""

""I don't get it,"" I e-mailed a female friend of mine the morning after the preview screening. ""Is this a movie only a woman could love?""

""Actually, it's a movie to make a thinking woman question her love of the first movie. Was Bridget really so retrograde a figure the first time?"" was her response.

Perhaps. When Daniel is trying to flatter her into bed, he reminisces about the events of the first movie. ""You made me laugh, Jones,"" he says smoothly, ""though I was always laughing AT you, not with you.""

Which pretty well sums it up, I'd say.",1101254400,2,3079,4.608775137111517

However, BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON departs from what made the first film so charming, instead concentrating on the goofball slapstick of Bridget, rather than her inherent ""Everywoman"" quality that made her so relatable.

Lots of women know what it's like to be stood up for a date or to be lied to by a cad. Hardly any women or other members of the target audience for BRIDGET JONES know what it's like to be under arrest and held in a Thai women's prison. (I also doubt, in that situation, that most women would spend their time choreographing a Madonna number for fellow inmates.) Other women likely aren't going to accidentally end up skiing down a championship racing slope. Or skydive into a vat of pig slop. Or get into another of the groan-inducingly unrealistic situations that the makers of the film put Bridget in.

The movie's not like the second novel, either, which has its own set of flaws. The second novel didn't even include the Daniel Cleaver character, but the movie had to find a way to include Hugh Grant - so they threw him in there.

The problems of the romance between Darcy and Bridget, like in the book, could be solved if the two of them just sat down and had an open conversation. But, instead, we're treated to the situation - and the movie AND Renee Zellweger's wavering accent - just getting worse and worse.

That said, the romance is interesting. Colin Firth is good. Renee Zellweger is good enough. And the movie makes London look awfully pretty.",1101254400,2,1757,4.636655948553055
1521403,1,B00005JNDZ,"I didn't care much for the first ""Bridget Jones"" movie, and the second one was just plain awful.  For the life of me, I cannot figure out what is supposed to be appealing about Renee Zellweger's character.  She's not a BAD person, but she's annoying and is a social disaster, and I don't understand how these two fabulous British guys (played by Colin Firth and Hugh Grant) could possibly be interested in her.

The plot of ""The Edge of Reason"" also leaves a lot to be desired.  There really wasn't anything else to tell about Bridget Jones, but since the first film made so much money, they decided to make a second movie (regardless of the fact that it was so crappy) in hopes of making even MORE money.  Sadly, the plan worked, but I wasted two hours of my life in the movie theatre that I'll never get back.

I really tried to like this movie.  I love Firth and Grant, but they weren't enough to save the film.  (Grant is only in the movie for a grand total of about ten minutes, too, so moviegoers who haven't read the book version will likely be disappointed.)  By the time the Thai prison scenes rolled around, I was thoroughly disgusted.  How could they have made this movie more ridiculous?!  I don't think they could have.

The only ""good"" thing I can say about this movie is that it supposedly sticks pretty close to the plot of the book, but that should tell you something about the quality of that particular novel.  I haven't read it, but I'm guessing that it sucks.  Don't waste your time or money on this crappy, crappy movie.",1101254400,6,1542,4.421985815602837
1521404,5,B00005JNDZ,"Bridget Jones is back. Once again she struggles with her weight and love confusion. She has a boyfriend, charming Mark Darcy, yet she feels unsure of this relationship. She is convinced that this spark between her and Darcy is gone. And then comes along Daniel Cleaver. In a steamy and exotic scenery of Thailand Bridget is hoping to begin a new without-Mark-Darcy life, however, what she really begins is a cornucopia of slip-ups. And once again she deals with it in a typical, yet delightful Bridget-like way.

In this movie as in the previous one we meet again Renee Zelweger (Bridget Jones), Colin Firth (Mark Darcy) and Hugh Grant (Daniel Cleaver). But this time more of Bridget's friends show up and it's good to see that the movie is not entirely Bridget oriented.

The movie may not be the one hundred percent adequate reflection of the book, yet it contains this light-hearted humour which was used by Fielding to describe Bridget's search for love.

So, if you are looking for an amuzing yet not silly movie, for a bit of emotion and a loads of fun and all this spiced up with a portion of romance, go and see it. So what if Mark Darcy guy is a hard to find and real life Bridgets mostly end up dreaming of a perfect man. They won't find him at home. This movie at least will show them and all of us that the search for the real love is sometimes bumpy and often knackering yet worth taking the risk, because one never knows when it hits him. You, however, will not have to risk with the movie - fun is guaranteed. You will enjoy it!",1101254400,4,1543,4.426056338028169
1521405,5,B00005JNDZ,"It felt like a comical amusement ride.  I couldn't stop smiling a long time after it was over.  It was good to see specific side characters get attention in this film, like Magda, Jed, Giles, the ""Jellyfisher"", and of course Bridget's 3 best friends.  I know that the love triangle with Mark and Daniel is rewritten, but I think it works well.  And I love the way Mark fights for her in the end, not only with Daniel, but how he gets her out of the T-land jail!  It was soooooo Mr. Darcy.  I just wish they had shown all the work Mark went through to obtain her release.  The way they showed Mr. Darcy hunting Mr. Wickham down and making him marry poor, stupid Lydia.",1100995200,4,667,4.246031746031746
1521406,3,B00005JNDZ,"I found some of this movie hysterical, yet also very frustrating to watch someone constantly doing self-damaging things.  The first movie seemed more innocent in the wackyness of Bridget.  This one seemed to try too hard and simply lacked the charm and chemistry of the first.  Can't compare to the book as I have not read this one.",1100995200,,332,4.689655172413793
1521407,5,B00005JNDZ,"Ahhh! What a lovely thing it is to anticipate a movie for two years to have it meet and go beyond every expectation!

Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason was wonderful!!  It felt like watching the first one for the first time again.  Well, except this time around, we all know that dear Mr. Cleaver is a complete dirty pratt and that handsome Mr. Darcy is every woman's dream come true!

The story line was just as substantial as the first.  With the first, Bridget was struggling with her ""little demons"" (i.e., weight, smoking, drinking, verbal diarrhea, etc).  In this one, she continues (as we all do) struggling with those demons, but there is a new twist (do not worry... no spoilers).  She is struggling with the most evil of demons... insecurity.

The acting is wonderful with the slight exception (IMO) of Mark ""Wanker"" Darcy ;) (Colin Firth).  Every now and again, it seemed as though his heart just wasn't quite into the project.  It was very slight, however.  It truly was not enough to ruin the movie... trust me!  He was his normal, gorgeous, charming, eloquent self 98% of the time! Gorgeous man!

Rene Zellweger (sp?) seems to have gained more weight (in the face) in this movie.  It was quite odd... her body seems trimmer, but her face more round. Amazing! However, she was as cute and lovable as ever! There could never be a different actress for Our Little Bridget!

Hugh Grant appears to have lost quite a bit of weight.  He's as handsome and clever as ever, but his weight loss was a bit distracting.  They made Daniel Cleaver more slimy this go-round, but it was oh-so-FUN!!

Bridget's family was as crazy and fun as ever!! They make mine appear... normal! :D

If you're a Bridget Jones fan, you MUST see this movie ASAP!! If you're a pretty-good fan, see it during a matinee.  If you're a luke-warm fan, wait for the video.  If you're not a fan at all, please do not watch it, then come here and leave a nasty review!

This movie is (as the first was) fun, inspiring, uplifting and most of all: Closer to the truth about real women than any other movie out!",1100995200,5,2079,4.517426273458445
1521455,4,B00005JNDZ,I enjoyed the edge of reason because I love Colin Firth.  It had some moving moments about relationships.  Not quite as good as original but the edge of reason book wasn't as good either so I think the movie lived up to the book but better.  I would see any movie Colin Firth was in.,1100908800,2,283,4.109090909090909

1521457,4,B00005JNDZ,"OK I just saw this movie about an 1/2 hour ago. It is a good movie. Not great, but good. But then that is what I would say about the first one too. Anyway, I liked this movie. The 3 main stars return: Renee Zellweger, Colin Firth and Hugh Grant. Actually everyone that was in the first one is in this one. Bridget Jones (Renee) hasn't changed much. She has a real boyfriend now, but she still smokes and drinks (not as much though). My only problem is Renee looked too overweight. She looked good in the first one, but this one she just gained too much for the role. Mark Darcy (Colin) in this movie is a combination of sexy, annoying, snobbish & a bit funny too.(similar to the first movie, but better). There are times in this movie that I just wanted to shake some sense into Mark. The movie: It takes place 6 weeks later from where the first one left off. Bridget and Mark are together. It is still very awkward between the 2 of them. He is the straight laced serious lawyer and she is the insecure tv reporter.  Daniel Clever (Hugh) is also back - still the same sexy scoundral as in the first movie. It has some funny parts, some that you laugh at just because that is you during that scene or situation and then there are some parts that really don't make sense. Like the first movie, there are areas that don't match if you read the book and then see the movie or vice versa. You are taken through quite a few situations from start to finish, but in the end it finishes like you want it to. It is a good movie to see if you are 1) wanting to see what happens from where the first movie left off & 2) wanting to completely forget your life for an hour and a 1/2. I really suggest that you see it!",1100736000,7,1703,4.129518072289157
1521458,1,B00005JNDZ,"Prepare to be disappointed.  The first film was tolerable entertainment, the sequel is boring offensive trash.  Ploddingly written, with little wit and a barrage of expletives, this is a complete waste of your time.  It is revolting in its stereotyping of the Thai people - how misguided is it to have Bridget, the ultimate fantasy figure, compare her problems to the real ones of a Thai woman, in jail, a prostitute, beaten and forced to take heroin by her pimp?  Is the child sex trade in Thailand good material for a 'joke', as occurs when Bridget is on a plane seated next to a beer-swiling boor?  Wake up audience!  This is not harmless light entertainment, it is drearily cynical garbage.

*

Aside from the racial slurs, there is the predictable sexual stereotyping.  Bridget's suitors are rich, intelligent, and, especially in Darcy's case, powerful.  Bridget is less than rich, less than intelligent, and a victim to the point of feeling 'unworthy' - much of the alleged humour is prised from her acute embarassment.  The men use their powers to gain Bridget's affection, which is largely equated with sexual favours, and dreams of marriage and babies.  Her career is belittled, any success seen as accidental, theirs presented as important, glamorous, and well deserved.  Of course it's possible to milk some laughs from all this, but haven't we seen all this many times before?  Isn't it tedious?

*

Grant has his character down pat, and he provides the few genuine laughs.  Renee is made to look as unattractive as possible - one wonders whether the men behind the film have deliberately done this, again quite cynically - all very well to say it's 'brave' of the actress, but why are the men presented normally.  Colin Firth - why is he bothering with this?  The minor characters, especially Bridget's so-called friends, are repulsive and unbelievable - her parents are similarly embodiments of a single joke repeated ad nauseam.

*

In terms of basic plotting, it is also very weak.  For the first half of the film it's only Darcy and Bridget.  He is all wonderful, she is all paranoia.  It takes Cleaver, Hugh Grant, to add any drama, hackneyed those this may be.  All this provoked many a yawn in the cinema audience.

*

Don't be fooled by those fond of the first film - this is despicable rubbish.",1100649600,11,2316,4.7974683544303796
1521459,5,B00005JNDZ,"I saw this movie a couple days ago expecting to be disappointed due to all the bad reviews I've heard. From the very beginning to the end, it was an excellent movie. Granted, most men or non-Bridget fans will find it boring and preditable, those who enjoyed the first flick and the books will love this movie. It did follow the book fairly closely, but some things were changed or removed entirely (Bridget's mom's African project was not mentioned). The acting was well done, I was happy to see more of Colin Firth although is it true that he had as much variety in expression/voice as Keanu Reeves in ""The Matrix"". Hugh Grant returned as the womanizing sleeze and he was great. Renee Zellweger looked much heavier in this movie than the first but she played Bridget wonderfully.

I can see the point of some critics wondering why these 2 men chased after her so intently as it did seem a little excessive, especially when Mark Darcy feared that Bridget had returned to Daniel again. All I have to say on that subject is that it did follow the book, where Bridget was pursued by both throughout the story.

All in all, this is a great film and I will be seeing it again. If you loved the first movie, loved the books, and can relate to Bridget, then see this movie!",1100476800,6,1266,4.452586206896552
1521460,2,B00005JNDZ,"I got dragged to this hideous feature by two female friends who had seen and loved the first film.  I hadn't, but I was filled in on the background before it began, and references were explained to me.

Basically, it's a romance involving an insecure fat girl (Renee Zellweger) and the two men who are competing for her affection. She is in love with an human rights lawyer (Colin Firth) whom she has been with for two whole months but finds herself occasionally drawn to a funny, charming, but ultimately slimy TV show host (Hugh Grant.)

I couldn't for the life of me figure out why anyone would be fighting over this woman. She's an idiot. She constantly humiliates Firth's character in front of his professional colleagues. She is completely inept at nearly everything. And none of this is even remotely cute or endearing. Conversely, I couldn't understand what she saw in her boyfriend, who has all the personality of the desk I'm sitting at. Oh, right, the shagging was good. We are reminded of that many, many times over. Grant's character is a jerk, but at least he's funny.

Zellweger is incredibly annoying, with her fake English accent and exaggerated mannerisms. Roger Ebert says he wanted to tickle her under her chin. I wanted to punch her in the eye.  Do women actually relate to this character?  That's so very sad.

Hugh Grant is the only entertaining thing in the movie. His scenes were the only times I genuinely laughed.

The film is nauseatingly sweet at the worst of times, and predictable as well. If you can't see what's coming when someone asks the main character to carry a souvenir item from Thailand in her luggage, then you just haven't seen enough movies. By the time Bridget is singing Madonna songs in a Thai prison, you'll be wanting to ram skewers into both your eyes and ears.

This isn't the worst film I've ever seen, but it is unquestionably the worst film I've seen in theaters in the past year.",1100476800,17,1934,4.648093841642229
1521461,3,B00005JNDZ,"Renee Zellwegger, Hugh Grant and (especially) Colin Firth are three actors I'm willing to give any benefit of the doubt to, but ""Edge of Reason"" really tested my patience in that regard.  These three professionals try their collective best to breathe some life into this slight tale, but only marginally succeed.

Blame the material - the original 'Bridget Jones' penned by Helen Fielding basically invented the chick-lit genre (or at least brought it to the collective consciousness of the UK/US public).  Richard Curtis (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Love Actually) helped Fielding bring it to screen, as directed by close Fielding friend, Sharon Maguire.  'Edge of Reason' - the book - was shunned by most of the audience that flocked to the original.  It comes across as a stretch.  And what doesn't work in print definitely falls flat on the screen - a call girl-backed rendition of 'Like a Virgin' in a Thai jail (don't ask) for example did not succeed in elicting a single laugh from the audience.

Too bad, because these three deserve better.  Hugh Grant was quoted recently as saying he was contemplating 'retiring' from film.  If so, it'll be a huge loss - this guy makes it look so effortless.

One other point is how abysmally under-used some of the actors are - Jim Broadbent might be one of world's foremost character actors.  We get a couple of shots of him in a lavender tux.  He has maybe ten (at most) lines througout, none memorable.  A waste.

And, amongst Bridget's support crew, we get Jude, played by Shirley Henderson.  Since the release of ""B.J.'s Diary,"" Henderson has gone on to star in ""Intermission""  and ""Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself,"" both to critical acclaim.  Yet, she's completely part of the woodwork here.  Another lost opportunity.",1100476800,4,1767,4.87248322147651
1521462,3,B00005JNDZ,"Bridget (Renee Zellweger) is back with Mark (Colin Firth) and Daniel (Hugh Grant) in tow: looking resplendent in a variety of wacky outfits, which only accentuate not hide her weight concerns.

But some of the fun and gloss of the first installment is gone, however. Zellweger is still chipper and a blast as Bridget. It's just that the plot and everything surrounding her is just a bit off.

Many scenes, in particular the Skiing sequence, reminds me of a similar one from a 1960's Doris Day movie: which is OK if it is done in the same light, snappy vein, but it isn't... it just falls flat. Humorless.

One scene that does work is the fountain scene/fight between Darcy and Daniel. It's silly, awkward and dumb.... but very very funny.

But to tell the truth, what we all want to see anyway is some kind of resolution to the Bridget-Darcy-Daniel triangle. Am I right? And we get one...finally. But like life it takes awhile to get there.

""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason"" is humorous and sometimes even downright funny.

Yet, perhaps it was just me?  Much of the audience did laugh from time to time at the often slap stick humour.  I just found it predictable and tired.

The original film of 2001 was fresh and at sometimes amusing.  This sequel, however,  showed that you can only get so much out of the one idea.  Bridget Jones had morphed into an absurd caricature.  She even gets stuck in a Thai jail on a drugs charge!  What's more, the feeling of dj vu when her two suitors are involved in another fight is palpable.  It just wasn't funny!
