3919920,5,B002EWD0CC,"I am an intermediate level exerciser & try to work out atleast 5times a week at home. And this DVD is certainly a great addition to my library. The moves in all the segments are new & makes working out more effective.
My favorite is the Belly Fat Blaster bcoz I hate working my abs lying down & Amy had new moves to work your abs in a standing position.
Highly Recommended!",1259193600,11,373,4.194444444444445
3919921,4,B002EWD0CC,"As an instructor, Amy is one of my favorites!  She usually doesn't mess around - tough workouts are typically her norm.  10 Minute Solution isn't bad, it's just not as high intensity for what I'm used to with her.

Five 10 minute segments:
- Fat Blasting Intervals
- Belly Fat Burner
- Lean Body Sculpt
- Cardio Kickboxing
- Power Yoga

You will need 5 lb. weights and a mat (if hard floor). The first two 10 min. sections were a little disappointing. In Fat Blasting Intervals, the weight intervals seemed awfully short, even taking into account it is a 10 minute segment. The cardio intervals are excellent though =) The Belly Fat Burner had some intense moments - she does standing & floor ab work. Again, just not as intense as I was hoping for. I'm wondering if she was preggers when this was filmed....that may help explain some things =)

The remaing three segments make this DVD worth buying. Amy does some awesome arm work in Lean Body Scuplt. She also incorporates squats, glute work, and balance in this segment. The Cardio Kickboxing has great combos...these really get your heart rate up!  Excellent cardio =) Finally, the Power Yoga.  I enjoyed this, it was a nice stretch for the hamstrings, and excellent shoulder work.  She seems a little wobbley - but that doesn't affect the effectiveness of this segment!

The only thing I think is important to note - if your form is not correct, you will not think this is a good workout.  Form is absolutely key in this, otherwise, you may not get much out of the workout.  Amy's cueing is right on, and as mentioned by another reviewer, some crazy camera zooming/angles in Belly Fat Burner.

Four Stars for this!  Great for beginner advanced and up.",1253059200,15,1706,4.627906976744186
3919922,5,B002EWD0CC,"Another winner from the 10 Minute Solutions camp.  3 of the 10 minute sections utilise dumbbells (the instructor, Amy Bento, recommends 5 pounds, but to listen to your body and adjust the weight as necessary) and these workouts combine multi-body part strength training with short burst cardio intervals, foucsing on abs, and total body toning.  It works by doing a series of reps with the weights, then 1 minute of cardio and repeating with variations for the full 10 minutes.  There's a dedicated  10 minutes for cardio kickboxing, which includes some very fast paced moves, then a final power Yoga set.

It's a great way of working out, and as I also do the 10MS 'Knockout Body' I can use the weighted pink gloves on the 'Cardio Kickboxing' session, bonus!  Getting to work arms and legs at the same time is a brilliant time saver and my only gripe, is the usually very high production values have slipped with the music overpowering  Amy's instructing and also,  2 minutes into the 'Belly Fat Burner' workout, the camera angles start to dart around and the focus goes out quite dramatically.  I'm genuinely very surprised this wasn't corrected before release, as I've come to expect alot more from 10MS.  Once you get used to it though, it doesn't distract from the workout and the dodgy camera work/edit lasts around a minute.

Amy is fast becoming one of my favourite instructors as I find her cueing spot on, she's friendly and informative, motivating and really encouraging, 'how about getting a bit lower this time?' plus I'm pleased she's making less references to blood getting in the muscles, (as in her previous DVDs) as this always makes me a little oogy!",1252627200,2,1669,4.800699300699301
3919923,5,B002EWD0CC,"I like to mix up my workouts and this workout fits the bill.  If you do them all together you get a total body kick butt mix of a variety of exercises.  This would also be a nice add on to do one or a few after a short workout or if you are pressed for time.  It is true that each section is only 10 minutes, but there is no time wasted.  The Cardio Kickboxing section is a heart pumping mix of kicks and punches with other cardio moves thrown in.  Fat Blasting Intervals is a fun and effective mix of cardio and toning. There is nothing traditional about Belly Fat Burner, not a traditional crunch to be seen (or done) and I can really feel the work as I am doing it and the burn afterwards. Lean Body Sculpt is challenging since it requires you to balance in many of the moves and to utilize both the upper and lower body at the same time.  I found the workouts to be fun, well cued, and the time flew.  Amy Bento is a fantastic instructor (as a side point, the other 10 Minute Solution workouts she has instructed are awesome, too).  She is motivating, reassuring and is easy to follow.  I hope she continues to be featured in the 10 Minute Solution workouts.  This collection or workouts is an asset to my exercise DVD library!",1251331200,73,1231,4.177966101694915

I would advise taking care if you have injuries, but above that, to do a warm up and cool down to avoid injuries.  I believe they are a great workouts, and good quality DVD which would justify 5 stars, but because I think caution is needed, especially if you are not in your 20's any more, make sure you warm up.

3919991,4,B002EWD0CC,"One of my favorites of the 10 Minute Solution series.  I really like the variety of being able to mix and match a few of them together, and my typical 30 minute workout always seems to fly by when it's separated into three 10-minute increments.  Many in this series are too easy for an intermediate/advanced level, but I find this one to be challenging enough for that level exerciser on a light day.  Amy's pace is good and she makes the most of the time available.  The High Intensity Interval, the Butt Lift, and the Rapid Results Pilates, and the Carb Burner are the best I've found so far for quick, lighter workout days.",1427846400,3,626,4.464912280701754

3920007,5,B002EWD0CC,"I loved this DVD, as all of the workouts keep you moving with very little rest between sets. Also, it keeps the heart rate high without being high impact i.e. easy on the back and knees.

I usually do the workout in this order:
1. Lean Body Sculpt
2. Cardio Kickboxing
3. Fat Blasting Intervals
4. Abs

The best thing is that you don't realize just how fast you can do these workouts. I start them and before i know it, 10 minutes have passed and I've worked hard and want to do another workout.

The music is ok.  I have been doing this about 3 times a week for the past 4-5 weeks and definitely have lost weight because my pants are loose.  You are definitely sore the next day or two and some of the exercises, I cannot finish when I do 3 of them in a row.  I definitely recommend it, but want something else to trade off with since I don't want it to get boring.",1410739200,,542,4.037383177570093

I emailed the company and I left a request on Amazon for feedback, but did not hear from anyone.  On the whole, Amy Bento is a good instructor.  I think that giving modifications for a few of the exercises would be helpful.

Amy leads you through exercises that aren't overly complicated and when you perfect the form through her suggestions, give quite a work out.

I use one of these first thing in the morning, every day! Who doesn't have 10 minutes!

Amy Bento is a fabulous trainer in every section and gives lots of tips to make the workouts even better for you. If I could only own one workout DVD, this would definitely be it.

3920081,4,B002EWD0CC,"I get bored easily with workouts, so the 5-day mix works great for me.  I'm not a fan of the Cardio Kickboxing segment (just not my thing), but the rest are great.

Amy is a good fitness personality.  She's natural on camera and not annoying like some can be.

I'm a big fan of the 10-minute solutions because motivation is often a huge barrier.  Even I can get myself to commit to just 10 minutes.  Then once you get started, it's not so hard to just do another one.  Even in just 10 minutes, she packs in a good workout.  My first time through a couple of them, I had to pause for a quick rest.  She also looks tired and sweaty as she leads you, so that's a good sign.

My one caution is regarding cardio.  I love this mix mostly for strength and core training.  I have yet to find a good, short video that really gives a good cardio workout.  Granted I don't like the kickboxing.  The interval workout does a decent job for cardio, but it still doesn't compare to something like running.  Awhile after I got this DVD, my husband and I broke down and bought a used elliptical.  There's just no competing with 10 minutes on that machine to keep the heart rate up.

Still, I use this DVD all the time in between elliptical workouts for variety and strength training.  Of all the 10 minutes solutions I've tried (about 5 of them), this is the one I bought and like best.",1368057600,5,1369,4.24031007751938

I thought instead of doing 1/2 of a 20 minute workout I should try a workout that was intended to be 10 minutes. I didn't care for this video much. I found the moves were not great on my joints and the instructor's form was rather bad, in my opinion. I doubt I will ever use this dvd again. I wish I had youtubed it first to get an idea of what I was in for. I will never buy another workout video without checking out a sample on youtube first! I am going to go back to my Jillian Micheals dvds (30 day Shred is my favorite) and just do what I can. I find if I do the warm up and first set that's about 10 mins (or since I'm warmed up already from the bike, I do the 2nd two sets and that's about 10 mins).  I recently tried The Biggest Loser: Boot Camp dvd and really liked that too. For some reason I found it got me sweating way harder than the Shred dvd, but I was able to get through the entire 20min workout.  It also has 2 other workouts that are 15 & 10 minutes each. Recommend those two videos over this one any day.",1361059200,6,1237,3.8814229249011856

I came across this DVD and for around $5 thought I would give it a shot... what do I have to loose?  Well... I LOVE this DVD.  If you do all 5 workouts at once I think that this video would be a decent workout for an intermediate to experience level person.  It is great for me because I do one of the 10 minute workouts at a time.  This allows me to get a good rest and get my breathing under control.  Then later in the day I do another 10 minute workout with the same rest period afterwards.  I know these are little steps... but for someone like me it is a great way to get back into shape.  Hopefully, in time, I can work up several of the workouts at once... I think this video is a great option for anyone.  You can design it to fit your needs.  For the price...

It takes a few times to get all of the moves down since it goes pretty fast (it is only 10 minutes after all!), but I really enjoy the workout.  I like that it mixes it up from the same old crunches and aerobic exercise.  Probably couldn't use only this, but it is a great start to my day.",1358121600,,451,3.817204301075269

I am in fairly good shape, within my weight range, but have not worked out at all in the past year and wanted to just tone up.  Well I love this video because there are 5 ten-minute workouts targeting different areas/objectives and you can do as few or as many workouts in whatever order you want.  The pace of each workout is quick and easy to catch on to, and you really get right to business after some quick stretching.  That I love.  But don't let it fool you - I was sweating half way through the first 10 minutes.  First day I did two of the workouts, and the next day my legs were pretty sore.  And because the workouts are so easily customized to whatever mood you're in and how much time you have, it's easy to keep going and stick with it.

3920160,4,B002EWD0CC,The Ten Minute Solution Five Day Get Fit Mix is a good workout that will make you sweat. The segments are ten minutes long and there are five of them. The Cardio kickboxing section will work your whole body and rev up your heartbeat. The Fat Blasting Interval is my favorite section as it will make you sweat and stronger. Power Yoga is a great segment to relax tired muscles and stretch after a long workout. Belly Fat Burner toned my midsection and works many different section of the core. Lean Body Sculpt tones the arms and upper body plus the legs and lower body. This section gave me slight muscles and the longer I do it the stronger I get. the instructor Amy Bento is enthusiastic and shows every move in great detail. This is one of the best workout videos to tone and tighten and lose weight in a short but effective workout.

I was under the impression that this DVD would make a 10 minute workout seem to just as effective as a 20-30 minute workout. I've done all of the workouts and only the yoga and ab ones are decent- not the best, but they were OK; the rest are a pure waste of time. I understand that the it's suppose to be a 10 minute workout, but that doesn't mean that it has to be rushed. I'd rather do 5 meaningful intense moves than 15 rushed, sloppy ones that will have no benefit. The only good things I can say are that all of the workouts do include a warm up and a cool down, you have the ability to mix and match your own routine, and they stick to being very close to 10 minutes.

With the exception of the yoga segment ( which is really bad), the rest of the workouts are just ok and pretty uninspired.

I loved the lean body sculpt because she uses compound moves where you exercise legs and arms at the same time, so you save a lot of time. I just wish that each section would be at least 15 minutes long, so that each exercise would have more repetitions. Seriously, I don't believe that 10 minutes with only 6 repetitions for each movement is enough to change your body.

I was looking for an exercise DVD that I could fit into my schedule with two kids.  I really like the format of this DVD and the fact that I can pick and choose which segments I want to do.  However, there are days when I wish each segment was 20 min instead of 10 because I sometimes feel like just when I'm starting to get a good workout it's over and then you kind of lose your momentum when it transitions to the next segment.  I am not as coordinated as I used to be, so the kick-boxing took me a little while to catch on to.  This was my first time doing yoga, and have to say I'm not a huge fan of than segment, I usually skip that one and just do my own stretching.  I find the instructor motivating and not annoying.  I appreciate that she tells you how many reps are left at various points throughout the workout and gives pointers on how to do exercises correctly, suggests modifications if you're unable to do something, as well as after several reps often adds something to make it a bit more challenging.

I LOVE yoga and needed something that challenged me more.
I don't like this DVD because it doesn't challenge me. Some of the workouts I get a good sweat worked up, but the power yoga is a very simple routine that I could do in my sleep.

3920220,3,B002EWD0CC,"I heard great things about Amy Bento which is why I decided to give this DVD a shot.  I will hold onto it, I like some of the workouts on this DVD, but I was somewhat disappointed.

Pros:
-I like the abs workout-it really BURNS and it's nice to do something other than plain ol' crunches. I felt it after the 10 minutes were up.
-If I want a warmup for more cardio I enjoy the kickboxing workout. It's not intense, but it is simple choreography and a good way to wake up the body before more intense cardio.
-The power yoga is great for a quickie if you want to slip some yoga in your day.

cons:
The circuit training/intervals workout was not enjoyable for me.  The cardio bursts got my heart rate up, but the weight sections just didn't feel like I was working anything, regardless of how much weight I used.
Same thing with the sculpting section.
The kickboxing is not enough to really feel like a cardio workout.
On the abs section, some of the standing exercises have too few reps and I felt that the one exercise where you mimick a kettlebell swing with your weight did not have enough instruction or explain how it would be beneficial, seemed pointless to me.

I'll hold onto it for the pros above.",1277337600,58,1205,4.337777777777778

And watch out with the kickboxing.  If you're into REAL hardcore kickboxing, this will be a huge disappointment.  I didn't end up sweating very much, and it was more frustrating than anything else.

3920228,4,B002EWD0CC,"Amy Bento gives us 5 top workouts which are all fun and get your heart rate going.  This review focuses on the cardio/strength segments, which are what I bought the DVD for.  I think it's worth getting this workout for any of the cardio strength workouts.  To break it down:

Fat Blasting Intervals:  This workout is very high energy with some really cool upbeat music.  This will definitely wake you up in the morning.  This sound strange, but the moves are all really fun, almost like something you'd do as a kid when playing (e.g. ""going skating"" and ""football feet"").

Cardio Kickboxing: I've never done an actual kickboxing routine, but I found this, like the Intervals, was heaps of fun and got my heart rate up.

Belly Fat Burner: Excellent workout here.  Amy has a combination of ab moves (that do not include situps - which I don't mind as I don't particularly enjoy them).  I definitely felt this workout the next day in my core, and I can definitely see this helping me on my way to a tight stomach.

Lean Body Sculpt:  This one is good too, but in my opinion, is a bit weaker than the other workouts.  Amy basically attempts to work every muscle in your upper body in 10 minutes, which is just a bit of a stretch.  Definitely enough shoulder work, but there's only one set of triceps, abs, biceps, and pushups and I don't think you would really be able to build muscle using this workout alone.  What I may end up doing, though, is just pausing the DVD after she does her set and do an extra 1-2 sets of each exercise.

Power Yoga: Having never done Yoga before, I'm probably not qualified to give an educated review of this one. But, I did find the workout easy enough to follow, and I felt stronger and more relaxed after doing it. For me, this was a nice introduction to yoga, and it makes me want to try more yoga workouts.

The only qualm I have with the workouts in general is that there really isn't much warm up or cooldown before/after each (again, trying to get it all in 10 minutes can be a bit of a stretch).  I found this was particularly noticeable with the kickboxing, where there are really quite large movements of the leg.  I think to be safe, one should really warm up and do some simple leg stretches before doing them.

Overall, I would say this workout is fun and motivating because it's so varied.  Each day you can do pick something new and mix and match the routines with whatever else you do for fitness.  There really are like 5 different workouts in 1 here, all of which are more or less good, and so I would say this DVD is well worth getting.",1270598400,26,2584,4.359832635983263
3920229,5,B002EWD0CC,"Whether you do 1 or all 5 in a row, this is a super effective video! I like how you can choose just a few and they will play after each other. I have already noticed results with less than a dozen uses and only doing 2-3 segments each.",1269907200,,235,3.816326530612245

I have a handful of tried and true videos that keep me motivated to work out 7 days per week.  This will definitely make the 7 day list for me!  To be honest, I just did this for the first time today and only did the abs portion, the cardio/weight portion and the lean muscle portion.  I work out 7 days per week and THIS MADE ME SWEAT!  The best part about the sections I did today was the abs workout.  I have NEVER seen any of these moves.  She kept it new and effective and definitely kept my interest.

I like to combine it with about 30 minutes of Zumba for cardio.  My one star dock is because the DVD is an older format and doesn't look great on a widescreen TV.",1483401600,,413,4.0
