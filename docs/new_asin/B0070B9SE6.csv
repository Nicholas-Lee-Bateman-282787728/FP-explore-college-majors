5046119,5,B0070B9SE6,"There were no actors like the ones on Dark Shadows.
I can't say how I enjoyed watching all the cast again playing those unforgettable roles.
Everything was really exciting and it kept you on the edge of your seat.",1396483200,,213,4.487179487179487
5046120,5,B0070B9SE6,"I am a huge fan of the original Dark Shadows series, and this DVD set has a significant plotline for the story arc the series was in at the time  Parallel Time 1970.",1372204800,,165,4.0
5046121,5,B0070B9SE6,"Great DVD if you like Dark Shadows like I do.
Barnabus is the star of the show and he has a great part as a 175 year old Vampire",1362096000,,128,3.4482758620689653
5046122,4,B0070B9SE6,"Like many fans I suppose, I couldn't wait for the Tim Burton / Johhny Depp remake. Without saying it was a bad film, I can say that other than taking the names, it had nothing to do with this series. That is what makes having the original series on DVD all the more sweet, bringing back childhood memories",1346630400,,305,4.275862068965517

8507641,5,B0070B9SE6,"Not bad.. I didn't think I could still be interested in this.  I've looked at these a little out of order and I skipped over this collection (#22 going into the future was much more interesting.)
but I was looking for another one because I like the format of an extended mystery, more involved, taking you away.  The Parallel World fit because it is not entirely the same old vampire thing and not a costumed dreary past,  but still with old friends.  It does begin (or continue) a Jekyll and Hide thing, for a short time, (recycled  actors in different roles didn't bother me.), and that hooked me.  Then it became a murder mystery with supernatural elements and Barnabas in a good role. For some reason, some plot complications look a little familiar like they have been recycled. The lack of continuity always bothered me; characters suddenly lose gained knowledge or have knowledge they shouldn't.  You'll need your finger near the mute button for megaphone voices.
