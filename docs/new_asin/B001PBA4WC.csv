3746740,5,B001PBA4WC,Received Vol 1 of the Videos. Can be described as totally AWESOME. Everything you ever wanted to know about carnivorous plants is fully explained and shown in steps that assume you know absolutely nothing (which in my case was true). And in a way that does not talk down to you. I am impressed.,1278633600,6,294,4.462962962962963
3746741,5,B001PBA4WC,"I've loved these plants since I was a kid.  Like many, I've tried many (way too many) times to grow these fascinating plants.  Now that I've watched this DVD, I learned what I was doing wrong (namely following the instructions that came with the plant).  After learning the right to cultivate way from this video, I now have carnivorous plants in bloom!  The best part is they set-you up for immediate success but the DVD is so full of tips and information I refer back to it.  It's become my first place to look-up information (while several books on the subject are now gathering dust) time and time again.  Watch the video -- these plants aren't hard to grow after all!",1278547200,6,672,4.512396694214876
3746742,5,B001PBA4WC,"This is the first video I have found that truly tells you how to grow Carnivorous plants.
Since finding this video have 3 beautiful venus flytraps and 3 beautiful pitcher plants.  In the past with bad information I have tried to grow venus flytraps but they always seem to die,  I now know why.
If you want to grow Carnivorous Plants this is a must have video.
The video is easy to watch and very informative.",1278547200,4,409,4.368421052631579

3746744,5,B001PBA4WC,A wonderfully engaging video series that is very informative! It gives practical instructions for keeping carnivorous plants and has a magnificent overview of many species available in the hobby! I ended up purchasing all 3 Volumes and have thoroughly enjoyed each. When I re-potted my Nepenthes and took cuttings for propagation I re-watched portions of Volume 3 several times. I could re-watch the species overviews many many times as they are so well done and do a great job of showing the diversity. A must watch for anyone interested in keeping carnivorous plants!,1417564800,3,569,5.129032258064516
3746745,4,B001PBA4WC,I got this before I got my Cape Sundew to make sure I didn't kill another plant.  The Cape Dundee is supposed to be easy to keep and i5 must be so because I can kill anything and mine is thriving.  The video gives you all the information you need to keep your plants but is not preachy.  I have since bought the remaining videos in the series even though I don't have space for any more plants.,1410912000,3,394,4.0256410256410255
3746746,5,B001PBA4WC,"Perfect guide to growing North American carnivorous plants.  I had a rudimentary understanding of growing Venus Flytraps, but was missing a lot of critical info, such as putting plants into dormancy during winter, which is a REQUIREMENT for the plants to have a long life.  Jeff and Jacob make everything pretty easy to understand and the instructions are really simple.  If you can grow tomatoes, you can grow North American carnivorous plants!!!  Thanks Jeff and Jacob!!",1404259200,3,472,5.171052631578948
3746747,5,B001PBA4WC,This was a very informative DVD. It was given me courage to grow some carnivorous plants in the desert of Utah this next spring. The DVD was very informative and explained a lot. I do wish it had more information concerning low humidity and growing in more desert like conditions but I can't ask for everything! Still worth 5 starts. I will be purchasing the next DVD soon!,1379894400,2,373,4.5
3746748,5,B001PBA4WC,"There are some excellent books available about carnivorous plants, but not many DVDs. Fortunately, this is a good one, published by an experienced carnivorous plants nursery owner. If you are new to growing these plants, this video will give you the confidence you need to get started...and do it right.  I waited until after receiving this DVD before planting my plants in an outdoor dish garden and I believe they stand a much better chance of survival because of the planting and watering tips in this video.  Highly recommended for first time growers.",1371772800,4,555,4.956989247311828
3746749,5,B001PBA4WC,"GREAT DVD!!  Very informative. Beautiful colorful video.  This covers plants that grow in the wild in North America.  Everything is covered, light requirements, harmful minerals in water, soil, etc.  This DVD should be all you need to start this fun hobby. I was surprised to learn there are over fifty varieties of carnivorous plants in North America.  This DVD should also be helpful to CP experts as it includes information on testing water, filtering water, transplanting, peat moss, drainage, etc.  They demonstrate making ideal potting mixture.  KEY points for beginners:  Six or more hours of sunlight a day, use pure or very low mineral water, IF in doubt use Distilled Water.  Do NOT use bottled Spring Water because it is high in minerals.  AVOID potting soil, compost and fertilizer.  Basic soil mix is 1 part sphagnum peat moss to 1 part perlite. Good luck!!",1368489600,6,870,4.972222222222222
3746750,5,B001PBA4WC,"I may have written one or two reviews in my life. I made a point to review this video. I am new to growing carnivorous plants and needed help to tackle this new endeavor. Well, this video did exactly what I needed plus showing me some things that I didn't know I needed to know! It is one thing to read and quite another to watch someone do the things I need to do now and things that I will face in the years to come. This is a video that is not just for beginners. I can tell that I will refer to it frequently in the years to come. I found out that it is much easier to care for my sundews and pitcher plants than I thought. In fact, I'm about to order more plants and will include a couple of Venus fly traps in my new order.",1356393600,4,729,3.834437086092715
3746751,5,B001PBA4WC,"this series is by far, the best how-to i have ever seen. volume 1, north american plants.  packed with facts, information and detailed growing instructions in a format that is easy to understand and apply with outstanding results. follow the simple instructions and have beautiful carnivorous plants of your own!",1290729600,3,312,5.24
3746752,5,B001PBA4WC,"I had already been successfully growing carnivorous plants for quite a few years when Jacob and Jeff released Grow Carnivorous Plants! Volume 1. I hesitated buying it because it was described as 'for beginners'. But I decided that the cost was a minimal risk and bought the DVD. I was very glad I did. The thrust is certainly aimed at beginners, discussing basic growing techniques of sun, soil and water. But they also cover propagation, pests and repotting. The DVD is divided by species so the care information is tailored to the specific type of CP.  I can almost guarantee that you will learn something you didn't know.  You might be able to find this information elsewhere, but seeing it is so much better. If you are a beginner, this is the DVD for you ... if you have been growing for years like me ... this is the DVD for you.",1278720000,5,835,4.4868421052631575

8332883,5,B001PBA4WC,"What a great set of videos! Jeff & Jacob explain every aspect of American native carnivorous plants a beginner could want to know. They say at the beginning of the main video that they learned by trial & error since there was little information about these great plants. Having made a thriving business in these plants they obviously know what is required. They go into detail about soil, watering, light, dividing, repotting, overwintering outdoors, pests, growing from seeds, and various issues a person might run into.

This video covers ONLY carnivorous plants found in the US (hardy); the 3rd DVD covers Asian & South American varieties (tropicals).

Whether you grow these plants or are just interested in unique plants this DVD is loaded with great information, examples of the major plants in the market including Venus' Fly Traps, Pitcher Plants, Dews, and Butter Warts.",1463356800,2,879,5.097222222222222

8332885,5,B001PBA4WC,"This truly is a no nonsense way of learning how to grow your own carnivorous plants. Though it will not teach you how to grow each type from seed or teach you how to care for them. This is more of a general rules of care to help a person that is new to carnivorous plants. It covers basic information such as, water, potting, etc.",1438300800,2,330,4.092307692307692
