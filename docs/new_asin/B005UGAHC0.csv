8486824,5,B005UGAHC0,I have done hypnosis for 25 years now.  I thoroughly enjoyed the DVD Stage Hypnosis training. It was fun and great.  Richard makes many excellent points well worth the purchase.  Highly recommend this DVD set.,1442880000,,209,4.914285714285715
8486825,5,B005UGAHC0,"This DVD set is everything I expected it to be. I was very impressed. It is like attending Richard's Seminar Live. Richard is nothing short of amazing. He is truly a professional at his craft. One of the best parts of the DVD set, is watching Richard instruct his students live in a lecture setting. You will also see his students test their skills, with instant induction, right out in public. His instructions are very easy to follow, and his confidence is what impressed me the most. I can't wait to watch the entire set all over again. If you can follow instructions, I don't think there is anyway you can fail, after watching and following Richards expert instruction. I hope to meet Richard in person someday, to thank him for sharing his knowledge and skills with me.  This is a must have!  Thanks! Richard,,,, Respectfully,  Ken
(PS I suggest you watch Richard's Show on Youtube. That is how I first found out about him.)",1442880000,,929,4.618181818181818

Richard is a master hypnotist and he is actually teaching this class. He takes students out and many of them are performing instant shock inductions on the streets. I cant wait to find someone to let me try this out on them. one word....Awesome",1442793600,,504,4.662921348314606
