8412659,5,B0041ETK0M,"After being awed by TZM, and having enjoyed Outsourced, Slumdog Millionaire, and My Name Is Khan, I started watching more
Bollywood films.  I had not heard anything about Udaan, but I ordered it on Netflix.  I found this to be as good as any of the
above mentioned films.  The performances of the entire cast, and the script and story were exceptional.  The ending brought
tears to my eyes.  A terrific film, in my opinion better than ""Khan"", which won the Filmfare award the same year as best picture,
as I felt the ending of that film betrayed the first 2 hours.",1381708800,2,564,4.490196078431373
8412660,1,B0041ETK0M,"In the 80s when Mithun Da and Bhappi Lahiri ruled, a genre of movie makin...g was invented and was proudly heralded by the pseudo-intellectuals as parallel cinema/art-movies. Poor folks like me, who too, albeit hesitatingly, had some claim to intellect, soon called its bluff and mocked it by saying that movies, which even whose makers do not understand are called ""art-movies"". Till day before y...esterday, I was living under the happy impression that such a race of movie makers was long extinct and then I watched Udaan. The blurb announced the accolades it has recieved at numerous film festivals. But poor ""dumb"" folks like yours truly have to spoil the festivities by announcing that the Emperor is naked, while all and sundry praise the Emperor's New Clothes lest they are labelled as hoi polloi. I really do not understand the movie. There is something called momentum and script - which I think were cruelly absent in the movie. Highly avoidable. This Udaan is surely crash landing into my ""koodadaan"".",1315785600,3,1013,5.0
8412661,4,B0041ETK0M,"Nothing about Udaan is grand or extraordinary. This story of a severely dysfunctional family with a teenage boy tugging hard at the last remaining strings that hold the family in place is full of heart and soul. The unblemished performances of the actors take it to another level.

Udaan is peppered with some hilarious moments but at times the artiness catches up and you have a dragging moment. This is one of those movies which once you watch you sort of feel empowered ...like maybe you can do anything you want if you put your heart into it! If the father shown in the film is anywhere close to yours you'll feel happy that there's some hope for you to get over it all. If you can't relate to this onscreen father at all, it will make you glad that you are so lucky!

Udaan is one of those films that reflect life and watching it may just give perspective on yours",1300406400,2,869,4.3580246913580245
8412662,3,B0041ETK0M,"This coming of age story by debutant director is a must watch. The movie is about a young student (Rajat  Barmecha) who has recently been expelled from his school. He returns home to meet his father whom he has not met for 8 years and 6 year old half brother. His father (Ronit Roy, a superstar on Indian TV) is an authoritarian and at best communicative only when he had a few drinks. His Uncle (Ram Kapoor) is the only one who tries to understand and bond with him. Against his wishes he has to enroll in an engineering college and work in his father's workshop. Things soon come to a boiling point between this young man and his father.
 I thought this was a great film especially given the young unknown cast, the locations in Jameshedpur are spectacular, and the music is okay. Three stars. 11/10/10",1291766400,2,804,4.462585034013605
8412663,4,B0041ETK0M,This is a great movie.  Not much I can add to the previous review.  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a movie with a good story to tell and is told very well.,1291161600,,167,3.742857142857143
8412664,4,B0041ETK0M,"A teenager (Rohan) is kicked out of his boarding school after a series of pranks, and returns ""home;"" he hasn't seen or talked to his family in eight years.  His father, an abusive factory owner, decides Rohan needs to become an engineer (""Yes, sir,"" Rohan replies).  But Rohan wants to be a writer.  He's already a great storyteller.  Meanwhile, Rohan struggles to develop a relationship with his younger half-brother, who wasn't even born when he left for boarding school.

This is a story of a dysfunctional family.  Udann is a movie that would work even if it wasn't centered in India, since the issues - physical abuse, parental love, abandonment, conflicting goals - occur worldwide.  Indeed, if this was a story centered in, say, Detroit, it would still work.

In this subtitled version, the color of the subtitling was such that there were many occasions, particularly at the end of the movie, when the light background made it very difficult to read.  That's a real production problem.

The India presented here was not the noisy, crowded, impoverished India featured in many other India-centered movies that make it to the United States.  It focuses on relationships.

The actors, and the acting, were perfect for this movie.  Recommended.",1287792000,8,1249,5.004854368932039
