8378405,5,B002R6IIW2,"I adore these little KidSongs DVDs... It's a riot watching the kids sing and dance to these lively tunes. No matter how many fancy video games and board games are invented, nothing beats the simple, old-fashioned fun of singing and dancing around the house.

When I saw that the kids on this cover were older than Devon (who will be four in three weeks), I hesitated getting this, but I liked the songs, so...what the hey! I got it for him for Christmas and am I ever glad I did! Singing along with him and his mom to ""Skip to My Lou"" and watching him dance his awkward little beginner steps was the most fun I've had in ages. This DVD has several other songs on it, but he seems to favor ""Skip to My Lou,"" ""Oh, Suzanna"" and ""The Circus is Coming to Town."" Can't wait till his mother sends me that promised video. :-)

Devon's too young to have hobbies yet--unless you call playing with cars, firetrucks and Transformers a hobby--but this book has a clever storyline about a boy name Billy who feels left out because everyone has a hobby but him. I'm sure Devon will enjoy the story more as he matures, but since he's having fun and getting exercise from the singing and dancing, that's enough for me!

For the fun factor, I can't praise&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/KIDSONGS-304-Were-Dancing-Now/dp/B002R6IIW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">KIDSONGS #304: Were Dancing Now</a>&nbsp;highly enough. I heartily recommend this entire series.
