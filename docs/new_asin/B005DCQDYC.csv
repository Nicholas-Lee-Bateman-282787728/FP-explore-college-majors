This is real drama. Life is wonderful and that's you see in the movie.
600 plus dead bodies are still laying on the mountains who have tried to climb Everest.
This is adventure not only climbing Everest, the tallest mountain in the world but touching human life with the true meaning of life
that we can through Lord Jesus.
I encourage that you watch this movie . This is more than a adventure but life changing documentary!",1401840000,,487,4.48314606741573
8466520,3,B005DCQDYC,"Given all the 5-star reviews, I had high expectations of this DVD.  I own a lot of Everest-themed DVDs and, just like the subjects in this story, I hope to venture to base camp someday.  I was very excited to receive this DVD, but after watching it, I'm tempted to sell it... that's saying a lot for someone like me who tends to hoard Everest material.

First, the Entertainment Examiner's Editorial Description is a bit misleading.  This is not ""about a quest to conquer the world's highest peak""... it's about a trek to Base Camp.  The cinematography is not ""breathtaking""... there are decent shots, but in the Himalayas decent shots are expected.

There was a lot of time and emphasis on a plane crash... a plane they were scheduled to be on.  I'm sure it was unnerving, but they act as if they've never heard that flight can be a little dicey.  This theme - one of being surprised by things that they shouldn't be surprised about - left me wondering if they had done much research into their trip.  Either that or they were making more of the trek's issues than needed to be made.  I couldn't tell.

They also made a lot of the altitude, which is a real factor as one approaches base camp, but it's not extreme or unusually high at the start of the trek, where again I felt like they were making more of the challenges than was deserved.  Ill-prepared trekkers?  Sub-par acting?  Again, I couldn't tell.  Indeed, a trek in the Himalayas poses many major challenges... no need to magnify the minor challenges.  It just cheapened the story.

Lastly, the religious overtones were a bit over the top for me.  Other viewers might appreciate the frequent references to God, but I for one didn't need to keep hearing it.

My recommendation would be to view other DVDs about treks to Everest base camp first.  Having watched this one, I wished I had.",1352246400,2,1846,4.553191489361702
8466521,5,B005DCQDYC,"A definite MUST SEE... Unique cinematography, compelling music and voice over... this is a fascinating adventure turned mission... great how the trekkers were able to learn about new cultures and religions as a result of an unexpected interruption... the beauty of this region makes for an interesting setting... Blessings on the families of those who perished...",1343088000,,363,5.5
8466522,5,B005DCQDYC,"I had the pleasure of being present for the theater premiere of this amazing film. Certainly the cinematography is breathtaking, but it is the magnificent backdrop of an even more magnificent story. It's not merely a motivational film about testing your own limits, pushing past your own comforts, and climbing your own personal Everest. It's about a land and a people that have largely gone undetected by the global radar. It's about compassion and relationship. It's about hard decisions.  The film is incredibly authentic.  There is an unexpected and chilling crisis in the film that is captured in real time, one that brings the trip itself and the participants to a courageous crossroads. Like the mountains themselves this film soars!",1343088000,,740,5.158333333333333
8466523,5,B005DCQDYC,The scenery and testimonies in this film are beautiful.  It is amazing to see God's work along the journey to Mt. Everest. Everyone should see this film!,1330473600,,153,4.666666666666667
8466524,5,B005DCQDYC,This movie was so informative and the scenery was out standing. To see the mountain was so much like you were there. The team being always close to God and His Glory was the part I enjoyed the most. It is so hard to find true Christian films which make your wonder of His mighty works more real. Thank you for your vision and thank you all team members for sharing your spiritual Journey to Everest. I sure will recommend this film to my friends and family.,1330473600,,457,4.264367816091954

8466526,5,B005DCQDYC,"We were very fortunate to see this on the big screen. It's an amazing visual treat. It's a fantastic perspective of a vision, that becomes a reality and unfolds while you are watching it.  A wonderful film showing a fresh view on the culture, as well as the beauty Everest has to offer. The film making is breath-taking! I hope you enjoy it was much as we did!",1311811200,2,360,4.294117647058823
8466527,5,B005DCQDYC,"Journey to Everest is a fascinating movie for the whole family.  It is not the typical Everest conquering movie - it is truly about the Journey of the team - preparation, getting to the mountain and the making of a team while heading to conquer the great Chomolungma.

Journey to Everest details not only the conquering of the mountain, but the preparation and emotional toil teams experience in planning for this event of a lifetime.  It explores and details team members' personal and emotional challenges unabashedly without trite cinematography and music.  The movie features the Sherpas and details their important roll for team and individual success on an Everest Expedition.

Most importantly the film details the spiritual aspect of the members of the team.  Without worrying about what is politically correct, the producer explores the members faith in God and how this faith helps them through the challenges of the expedition, personal tragedy and conquering the mountain.

This movie is fabulous for all families with children elementary age and older and a great bridge to family discussion on faith and perseverance through tragedy.",1311724800,5,1147,5.2349726775956285
