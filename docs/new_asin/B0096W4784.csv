5274773,5,B0096W4784,We love all these movies and are thrilled to have them in 1 pack. Never laughed so much. Thank you!,1365379200,,99,4.0
5274774,2,B0096W4784,"I love all of the movies in this set and the price is pretty good. My issue comes from the fact that so far I have had to return 2 copies for having faults on the same disc in the same place. On disc 2 on the movie The Cutting Edge: Fire and Ice a burn fault has made chapters 8 and 9 unplayable. I checked the discs on my computer to make sure it wasn't just my dvd player and found multiple burn errors on the disk. Once is a mistake. Twice could be an example of a bad production run.

I would have given this set 5 stars if I could get one that isn't damaged.

That being said, I plan to keep trying until I get a set that actually works. that's how much I like the movies on this set.

Update 4/3/2013

I have now received 3 bad copies. All have frozen at about the 54 minute mark during the movie The Cutting Edge: Fire and Ice. Looks like they got sloppy on this production run.",1364601600,20,885,3.9

5274832,1,B0096W4784,"I was disappointed in the programs I started to watch from this set because I felt they had language that was not appropriate for family viewing. I cannot tell you if they are all that way or not and a do not remember which titles we started to view. It seems so challenging to find good family viewing that has a high tone and nothing you don't want your kids to see. I often think families just give up and lower their standards, but we shouldn't.",1373241600,3,449,4.232558139534884
5274833,1,B0096W4784,One whole DVD didn't work. The DVDs were poor quality and I am so stinkin' upset with this mess. I didn't get to watch the DVDs immediately because I was busy with classes. I am a grown woman and I know how to operate my machine and so it is not my DVD player. Just a rotten set of DVDs. It was too late too ask for a refund or replacement because I waited too long to review them. I wonder how many DVD gifts I gave away that were this rotten in quality?,1369958400,8,455,3.851063829787234
5274834,5,B0096W4784,"I was originally looking to just purchase Holiday in Handcuffs... Found this item and was excited to see the other movies in the pack.  I have not watched Au Pair 3... only because I have not seen the first 2 and despise watching movies out of order... but The other movies are good.  Revenge Bridesmaids was great! My Fake Fiance ranks right up there with Holiday in Handcuffs! The Princess movie is surely a unique one.  The Snowglobe and My Future Boyfriend were also unique...  my least favorite of the ones I watched was probably My Future Boyfriend but over all, they are all pretty good movies and a great deal for the price.",1369699200,3,632,4.517543859649122
5274835,4,B0096W4784,"It's hard for me to rate some movies because I am biased about what ""family"" means and what would be for all ages.  My home is a Christian home and I don't like profanity or crude sayings or actions that others would probably think OK.  This particular pack has a large range of variety from the mythical fantasy to futuristic & time travel; humorous to romantic.  I have not watched Snow globe yet.  I would probably not watch Revenge of the Bridesmaids again it was my least liked.  Favorites were The Cutting Edge: Fire & Ice and Au Pair 3.  My Future Boyfriend made you think about the importance of love, procreation & family in the traditional way that we too often take for granted.",1368835200,4,689,4.472
