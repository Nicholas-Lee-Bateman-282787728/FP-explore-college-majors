Jeff Hardy (C) vs Johnny Nitro w/Melina

Jeff Wins: While Nitro jumps down to hit the floor and win, Jeff opens cage door and impales Nitro between the legs on door.

4/5

Micky James (C) vs Victoria

Micky wins: Melina comes to interfere but the 'checklist divas' come down and attack. Decent.

Ric Flair vs Kenny Dykstra

Kenny Wins: Back and forth match with some good submissions. Dykstra refuses to tap from a figure-four. Flair gets roller up, bad ending...

3/5

TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP

Rated-RKO (C) vs DX

No winner: Back and forth match until Shawn Micheals knocks out the ref and thats when things got interesting; HHH got injured (really) but he did well to finish the match (rumors that it was a hamstring. REMEMBER: I'm writing this the day of the PPV (In Ireland because of time differences, it was on this morning) so this is a rumor, but he IS in Birmingham hospital). Anyway, Shawn elbows Orton through the announcers table from a turnbuckle leap but Triple H messed up the Pedigree on the table and it didn't break (injury). Great and very interesting!

5/5

Carlito w/ Torrie Wilson vs Chris Masters

Masters Wins: Poor match, nothing interesting. After Masters wins, he applies the Masterlock for no reason on Carlito.

2/5

JOHN CENA INTERVIEW: Very funny and then Cena gives a truely inspiring speech, admitting risk and fear. After this, you knew he would win.

5/5

WWE CHAMPIONSHIP

John Cena (C) vs. Umaga

Cena Wins: What a cheap match. Umaga dominates throughout, Cena cannot lift him (unrealistic, seen as Cena can lift Big Show, and Big Show weighs 150lbs more than Umaga). In the end, Cena rolls up Umaga for a cheap victory. Terrible ending to the match. Was interesting to see Cena get whooped for the majority of the match though!

Overall, an alright PPV, but Umaga deserved to win, and the Carlito/Masters match was rubbish. Kenny could have a bright future in the WWE (no matter how much I hate him, it's true) as could Nitro. Ric Flair is being mistreated, and losing to so many wrestlers just isn't acceptable for old-school Wrestling fans like myself.

Steel Cage match for the Intercontinental championship
Jeff Hardy vs. Johnny Nitro(John Morrison)
This was a great way to start off a exciting event. These two put everything in there skills into this match. These guys had some huge moments like a sunset flip powerbomb off the top rope, Melina gettign involved, and a brutal moment where nitro was escaping, and hardy opened the door and nitro slipped, landed on the door, and injured his crotch(which was also the funniest moment in the match)and getting a huge laughing reaction from Jerry Lawler. 4.5/5

Tag Team Turmoil for a shot at the World Tag Team championship
This match included Cryme Tyme, The Highlanders, The worlds greatest tag team(the worlds lamest tag team), jim duggan and super crazy, lance cade and trevor murdoch. This was actually a pretty nice turn out to this match, having the few highflying moments, and the most surprising moment, with Cryme Tyme actually winning a match that would be big to there career. But i enjoyed this, and thought that it was surprising, especially with the tag team of jim duggan and SUPER CRAZY! 3.75/5

Kenny Dykstra vs. Ric Flair
Well, this match ruined two good matches in a row, this match ruined the streak. All this was, was just Kenny being a freaking jackass and beating a legend who can bearly talk anymore without spitting in someones face, so really big whoop, because this match should have never even been on the card. 2/5

Womans championship
Mickie James vs. Victoria
This was another waste of time, these two woman are great fighters, but here they just didn't put on a good match at all, this isn't even worth watching and is boring. A usual thing in the Diva division. 1/5

World Tag-Team championship
DX vs. Rated RKO
This of course was the best match on the card. These guys put on a freakin show. This match was never boring at any point and was match of the night. This was brutal and had some huge moments like. Triple H injuring his knee, which is one part of how this match was a no contest. Another was when chairs came into affect, and the pedigree on edge on the announce table and a elbow drop on Orton through the announce table. So, if you had any word to describe this match, it would be this, classic. These guys just went out there and did everything they could. Great match. 5/5

Chris Masters vs. Carlito
Why would WWE schedual this match to be after a classic like Rated RKO vs. DX. This match was only domination from Chris Masters and was a waste of time, this was also another match that shouldn't have been on the card. 2/5

WWE championship
John Cena vs. Umaga
Another good match for the night. This wasn't a classic, but the last man standing match a month later sure was. But these men went out there, and did everything they could like DX and Rated RKO. But in this match, this was Umagas first loss in the WWE, Cena again was put in the main event and over came the odds. But, i gotta give him props, he beat Umaga(R.I.P)twice in a row. But this almost deserved to be the main event. 4.5/5

Overall, this ppv was really good, sure it had some crapy matches, but had some great matches. I would recommend picking this one up.",1279152000,2,3265,4.494097807757167
8157078,3,B000KHX70I,"All three of the New Years Revolution PPV's had potential to be better than they ended up being. Actually 2006's version probably had the best card of the three. This version card was not to bad but this PPV still focused to much on the Main Events and not on the undercard. I personally was looking forward to a few matches on this PPV, The Steel Cage Match, I actually am looking forward to the Mickie James and Victoria match who are two of my favorite Women's wrestlers. I was looking forward to the Tag Team Title match between DX and Orton and Edge which should be good and then the Cena and Umaga match for the WWE title should be a pretty good battle.

Steel Cage Match for the Intercontinental Championship:

Jeff Hardy(c) vs. Johnny Nitro(John Morrison)

It was a good opener to start this PPV, it was a solid Cage Match I have seen better matches but this one got the crowd going and both men worked well together and shown great chemistry. During the match both men executed some great manuevers to keep this match exciting. The match was given good length and allowed both men adequate time to showcase their skills. Match Length: just under 15 minutes

Winner Jeff Hardy (3.5 out of 5 stars)

Tag Team Turmoil:

Highlanders vs. World's Greatest Tag Team vs. Hacksaw and Super Crazy vs. Lance Cade and Trevor Murdock vs. Cryme Tyme

Most people did not like this match but I thought it was good, I mostly liked it because it gave the teams time to work with and the match did not feel as rushed as these type of matches usually feel. Did not understand why Duggan and Crazy were a team luckly they were not in the match very long, but you have to give it to Duggan at his age that he still wrestles. The two best teams by far Benjamin and Haas and Cade and Murdock have the chance to shine although neither of them won the match even though they should have. Instead Cryme Tyme wins and to me they are way to green to try to represent the Tag Team Division. Match Length: 19 Minutes

Winner: Cryme Tyme (3 out of 5 Stars)

Single Match:

Ric Flair vs. Kenny Dykstra

Acually given some time to be a good match,it just did not happen. Dykstra is a promising prospect and might one day be good but honestly a feud with Flair does nothing to help him because he is not ready to take advantage of it. I figured the WWE would think as much considering the past couple of matches on RAW were disapointing. This match was given about 10 minutes and was not much better than seen on RAW. Match Length 10 minutes

Winner: Kenny Dykstra (2 out of 5 stars)

Women's Chmpionship:

Mickie James(c) vs. Victoria

Decent match, I was disapointed because I figured this would be a solid match because it involved two good workers. Neither one meshed very well with each other and this match actually was given close to 7 minutes which is above average time for a women's matchup. Both women tried but the match just did not turn out the way they wanted it too. Match Length: Just under 7 minutes

Winner: Mickie James

World Tag Team Championship:

Edge and Randy Orton(c) vs. Shawn Michaels and HHH

Very good tag match, HHH unfortuantely tore his other quad, which hurt the match itself and probably what the planned ending would have been. HHH proved how tough he was and finished the match which was very brutal for both teams. DX wanted revenge on Orton and Edge and they got it as both teams were out for blood. It ended up being a no contest that hurt the match rating, still I think it was the match of the night. Match Length: close to 25 minutes

Winners: No Contest (3.5 out of 5 stars)

Single Match:

Carlito vs. Chris Masters

ugh, not good at all easily the worst match of the night. The tag match probably cut some of the time for this match. Still it is no excuse because this match was horrible. Carlito looked okay and somewhat looked like he tried to make this watchable but failed miserably. Match length 6 minutes

Winner: Chris Masters (1 out of 5 stars)

WWE Championship Match:

John Cena(c) vs. Umaga

I liked the match overall, it wasn't the match of the night. I still was a good match at least I thought so. Umaga proved to be a undefeated monster but this match had fluke and rematch all over it. Cena was dominated and then Cena out of no where rolled him up to retain the title. I don't think Cena should have lost to Umaga but why bulid Umaga up for so long to end his streak how they did. Match Length: 17 minutes

Winner: John Cena

Overall this was a pretty average PPV from the WWE, basically bulit on three matches, the steel cage, Tag Titles, and Cena and Umaga which pretty much delivered with some exceptions. Unfortuantely there were two other matches Flair and Dykstra and Carlito and Masters that really disapointed and were just thrown in to add something to the card.",1219536000,,4810,4.403389830508474

1. Jeff Hardy vs. Johnny Nitro for the ITC title in a steel cage match- This was a good way to kick off the show. These two had some great matches before this but this might have been the best. Match started of slow but than it picked up pretty quick. This was not a blood bath  steel cage match but it was a high flying one. There was a sick sunset flip into a power bomb from the top of the cage preformed on Jeff hardy. Some more soild wrestling after that but hardy hit a dropkick on the door and nitro fell straight down which must have hurt. Winner and still ITC champ Jeff Hardy. Match Rating 8.5/10.

2. Tag Team turmoil- This was a good match. It had all the teams on raw in it. I which they would have kept the worlds greates tag team in it because they I thnk were the best. Just good soild wrestling by all the teams and it ended up to be preatty good. Winners Cryme Tyme. Match Rating 6.5/10.

3. Kenny vs. Rick Flair- This seemed more of a raw match to me. It was still a solid match and for kenny being only 20 years of age looked pretty good out there. Flair also did a good job  in carrying the match. It was mostly solid wrestling which was mostly controlled by Kenny. Like I said more of a raw match but a passable raw filler on a ppv. Winner Kenny. Match Rating 5/10.

4. Mickie James vs. Victoria for the wwe womens title- This was a match that I was really looking forward to as victories new hell turn was awesome. I was expecting a trish mickie showdown from wrestlemania but it was not quite there. It started off kind of slow and I was getting bored. Than the ending was really good with lots of near falls and melina came out and I thought she was going to cost Mickie the womens tile but Candice and torrie came down for the save. A decent womens match. Winner and still wwe womens champ Mickie James. Match Rating 6/10.

5. Rated Rko vs. DX for the world tag team titles- This was an awesome match and match of the night. A lot of people don't think it is as good as I do because HHH got hurt but this was still a very good match. It started out fast paced but slowed down. Than HHH got the hot tag but rated rko got the titles and nailed michales in the head with them and busted him wide open. Just some more solid wrestling but HHH got the tag and cleaned house. There was a ref bump and michales and HHH got some chairs and laid out rko with some sick chair shots. Than michales nailed a flying elbow through a table and HHH nailed a pedigree on edge on top of the table. The match ended in a no contest which sucked but the match was still very good. Winners NO Contest. Match Rating 9/10.

6. Carlito vs. Chris Masters- This was not a good match. I remember these two have had some pretty good matches in the past but this was deffenitly not one of them. This was slow and boring and it almost seemed like they put this in as a filler to slow the crowd down after that match. I think if they were given more time they probably could have done better but nothing more than a filler here. Winner Carlito. Match Rating 3/10

7. John Cenavs. Umaga- This was an okay main event. This really had a old school main event fell to it. Umaga really controlled the whole match. There were some cool spots were cena tried to pick up umaga but umaga would fall back down on him. Cena kept on fighting back and ended up getting the win ending was weak. Winner and still wwe champ John Cena. Match Rating 7/10.

Well that raps up another. I would give wwe no way out 2007 a grade of 45/70 which means this is a poor ppv. This was not terriable but there are two must seen match the cage and tag besides that the ppv is not to good and cena retained again which sucks. If you can tell me if my review was helpful or not I would appreciate that. Thanks for your time.",1176768000,,3855,4.129506008010681
8157080,2,B000KHX70I,"Intercontinental Championship Steel Cage Match

Jeff Hardy vs. Johnny Nitro-- This was what it was. Nitro was pretty decent but the excessively spotty Hardy again drags a lot of this down. I never once got the feeling this was an 'important match' per sae. Again, Nitro pulls some good stuff out of Hardy from time to time, but save for the nice heel getting his sort of ending, this wasn't much. **

Tag Team Turmoil

Cryme Time vs. Lance Cade & Trevor Murdoch vs. Worlds Greatest Tag Team vs. Super Crazy & Hacksaw Jim Duggan vs. The Highlanders---- Cryme Tyme won an otherwise entirely unspectacular tag team turmoil match with proved to have utterly no point to it as they never did anything with the title shot CT ended up winning. Throwaway junk. *1/2

Kenny Dykstra vs. Ric Flair

As can be expected, this wasn't anything overly spectacular, but was a pretty solid little offering. Kenny is young and uber talented but also really f-ing retarded. He blows more than a few advantages for himself over the course of the match (and others as well) and Flair makes him pay like only Flair can. Kenny does however, end up the lucky one, pulling a roll up out of his of young behind. They played off that little story for the first three matches until Flair finally would get revenge on Raw a few weeks later. Very basic, but solid action. **1/2

Women's Championship

Micky James vs. Victoria

This is probably the only time i've found myself agreeing with many posters on this site, but this was brutally awful and equally dissapointing. These two are easily the class of the WWE Women's Division right now and never seemed to be on the same page the entire time. *1/2

World Tag Team Championship

Rated RKO vs. DX

Thank God Triple H tore his quad. I'm not saying that because I dislike him. Not only do I consider myself a fan of his but I stray from the pack with many and think he's a very capable worker as well. I'm just sick and tired of DX and am thanking my stars I don't have to watch two 40 year old men try to re-live their childhood every Monday Night.

The match itself is entirely unspectacular and like the other matches, was more or less a complete and total squash job on Edge and Orton. This had all the potential in the world to be a great feud but Rated RKO never once looked like a legit threat, save for the con chair to spot on Raw leading up to this. Other than that, this was an awful feud, and gave us some of the worst stuff i've seen out of any of these four in a long time. The ending was okay, but the blown spots and everything else just make it hard  to watch. ** for a match that never got off the ground.

Carlito vs. Chris Masters

Dammit Chris Masters is starting to make me look like an idiot for calling him a talentless oaf. Not only is Masters coming into his own as a heel (love the contract saying the ML wasn't ever broken), but the guy is learning how to work like a bruiser and has improved in the ring 100 fold. The pace was just right for this match and really is a Masters carry job (!). Again, plodding at times, but that's the way it should be. Masters is turning into one of my favorite heels on the show, I just wish they'd do something with him. **1/2

WWE Championship

John Cena vs. Umaga

People that think Umaga's a crappy worker have got to lay off the stuff they're smoking. He was sensational in this match and when you juxtaposition this match with the Rumble match a few weeks later, this is perfect for what it was. Cena spends the entire time just figuring out how to get out alive, never mind keep the belt. Umaga controls 95% of this match. And as well he should. He is a monster after all. But much like Samoa Joe during his big ROH title run from 03-04, Umaga's a guy who's beatable with a flash pin. Cena doesn't dominate him or beat him or anything. He just catches a flash pin and gets lucky. It really does a good job of putting Cena's back against the wall for the Rumble by making him look significantly weaker than his challenger in a way that's believable instead of nine million run ins and all the peripheral crap WWE usually likes to do. Again, this isn't MOTY or anything, but it's a super-solid set up for the Rumble match. ***1/4

Overall: This is a pretty flat pay per view. I've seen the WWE put on shows that are far, far worse than this, but this isn't going to blow your doors off. Umaga-Cena, while I felt a little lost the first time I watched it, LOVED it the second time through, especially when you watch the Rumble match. Outstanding set up to it. Masters-Carlito & Dykstra-Flair are fun little offerings as well. DX-Rated RKO dissapoints again as we get the usual DX kills everyone deal. The rest was pretty poor. Decent show, but if you're debating about which show to get (the Rumble or NYR) i'd go with the Rumble.",1174003200,,4816,4.337041156840934
8157081,3,B000KHX70I,"Normally, this PPV is RAW's version of SmackDown's Great American Bash (or ECW's December To Dismember) in which WWE only focuses on their main events & pays little to no attention to the under card resulting in a horrible PPV.  However, with ECW having the Elimination Chamber this year...RAW focused on the entire card & gave us a show worth watching.

Steel Cage Match: Intercontinental Champion Jeff Hardy vs. Johnny Nitro - This cage match was similar to the Bret Hart vs. Owen Hart match in which they didn't turn it into a bloody massacre but did good wrestling inside the cage.  If you've seen their previous matches, you know this will not disappoint but the ending was something unique for a cage match.

Tag Team Turmoil: Highlanders vs. World's Greatest Tag Team vs. Jim Duggan & Super Crazy vs. Cade & Murdock vs. Cryme Tyme - Just like Cyber Sunday, this was just a filler match.  It had some weird booking like Duggan & Crazy being a tag team along with Cryme Tyme & WGTT not fighting each other when they were feuding for the past month on RAW.

Ric Flair vs. Kenny Dykstra - This was a solid match as Flair did what he had to do to elevate the young talent but if you've seen their matches on RAW the weeks before & after this match, you aren't missing anything.

Womens Champion Mickey James vs. Victoria - I liked that they had Victoria doing the ""Kill Bill"" gimmick but this match was more focused on setting up the Mickey/Melina feud & having the divas get their revenge on Victoria more than showcasing what Mickey & the most underrated diva in WWE can do.

World Tag Team Champions Rated RKO vs. DX - I guess Triple H has a curse in World Tag Team Title matches because he injured his other quad in this match but again, he worked through the pain & injury which is something you have to respect...love him or hate him.  Past that, they stepped up their match from Cyber Sunday & Rated RKO took a hellacious beating but still got the credibility they lost after that Survivor Series embarrassment.

Carlito vs. Chris Masters - Their Backlash match was the shock of the night seeing how well the match was but this match was very disappointing.

WWE Champion John Cena vs. Umaga - This match was basically an extended version of Cena's WM 21 match.  To summarize, Cena was dominated by Umaga for a majority of the match but then he scored the quick pin at the end.  Just like it was a crappy way to end JBL's title reign, this was a crappy way to end Umaga's undefeated streak.  And just like JBL, they made up for it on the next PPV but this wasn't a match worthy of the main event spot.

DVD extras include the Cena/K-Fed match from New Years Day edition of RAW...and the Rosie/Trump match the next night on RAW.  The Rosie/Trump match was heavily edited down so it didn't go as long and all the ""WE WANT WRESTLING!"" & ""TNA! TNA! TNA"" chants were edited out.

Just like Cyber Sunday, this event was passable but compared to all the previous NYR's, this was the best one WWE has ever put on.  I would get it for a rental & made your decision from there.",1171497600,5,3076,4.404593639575972
