8711749,5,B00VZAAW4S,"Wonderful animation and sweet kind friendship between Heidi and Peter.  In a world of bad influences and extreme violence and selfishness, I take great pleasure to be able to subject my 3,4 and now 5 year old to this German series in English and German language choices, with interesting story lines and beautifully done life lessons.  It's a definite MUST if you want to introduce your child to a rich culture of foreign cartoon/animation and give them something more than they are provided here in the states.  We LOVE  this series.

NOTE: If you appreciated this review please give it a thumbs up/like your helping me to continue to give honest/unbiased insight into products Ive used and you may have questions about. Interested in a product but don't know enough about it and would like it reviewed? Please let me know and I'll see what I can do... Thank you ",1524355200,,864,4.726666666666667
