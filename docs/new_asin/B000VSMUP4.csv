8219771,5,B000VSMUP4,"Meet John Doe, 1941 film

The film starts with a name change: The New Bulletin has streamlined news and is cleaning out some of the old staff. [Relevant to todays world?] One reporter writes a new story for her column. Are politics the cause of rising unemployment? Does the film suggest yes? Life can be beautiful. Can a newspaper create news to build circulation? Will people make a self-serving claim? They pick one who can pitch their line. The newspaper will build up a story on John Doe. Is there a danger in owning things? The newspaper creates protest stories on various themes. It shows how a wealthy publisher can sway public opinion by controlling the news. [Isnt this ever relevant?] The film tells about the effects of the Great Depression in a subtle way.

Can a writer find inspiration from an old diary? Will a competing newspaper try to expose this publicity stunt? What will John Doe say on live radio? A heckler is ejected. Were the people. John Doe cant escape his fame. [The scenes are funny.] People form fan clubs all over the country. Should people show more concern to their neighbors? [The attitudes of that era are shown.] Will the John Doe Clubs become a big business? Can a multi-millionaire use them for political purposes? Could a new third party represent 90% of the voters? [No, but 55% is enough to win.] This film shows how candidates are manipulated to advance the interests of the super-rich. It cant happen here? Those who object will be dealt with harshly.

John Doe escapes to address the convention, but D. B. Nortons troopers and newspapers attempt to squash the movement. The crowd rejects their hero (the fickleness of public opinion). What the media prints as Truth is accepted by most people. A group travel up to the 14th floor to watch. A man drops a letter into a mail slot, then goes to the 14th floor. There is a confrontation. Any idea worth dying for is worth living for. [Or is it the reverse?] Will the people triumph in the end?

This film asks some interesting questions as part of its story. It also tells about popular attitudes (as shown by Hollywood). [Daisy made a guest appearance earlier.] Most of the world was at war in 1941. This story warns how a millionaires money could back a political movement that could get him elected President. Surely not! Would it make the country great again? The future will tell.",1508025600,,2376,4.663484486873508

8219773,5,B000VSMUP4,"I have really liked this gem of a movie since I first watched it and have recommended it to many of my friends.(even gave many DVD's as gifts years ago)  It's director is the same as ""It's a Wonderful Life"" .  Many don't know that.  For a time, this movie was hard to find and then they made terrible copies.  I treasure my good copy. :)  I was thrilled to see it as a free movie on Amazon Prime and of course I watched it.  Maybe it's there just for the holidays.  IDK.  Anyways, If you liked "" It's a Wonderful LIfe"" you'll like ""Meet John Doe"".
