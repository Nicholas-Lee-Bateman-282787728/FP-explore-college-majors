8633427,5,B00HLY3T92,"Season 3 of Yae no Sakura deals primarily with the Battle of Aizu which ended with the siege of Tsuruga Castle in the heart of Aizu itself. All of the catastrophe predicted by clan elders when Aizu became responsible for the security of Kyoto in season 1 now comes to pass as the clan lord of Aizu is accused of rebellion against the Meiji government.

Throughout the series thus far Aizu people are referred to as fierce warriors with a strict martial code. The implication being that they are backwards, stubborn and honorable to the point of self destruction. This season we get to see why they have that reputation as the men, women and children of Aizu fight to protect the clan lord and their homes against (basically) the rest of Japan. Outnumbered and outgunned, the people of Aizu prepare to go down fighting. Yae and her husband try to modernize the army and Yae gets her first experience with nursing as the war wounded retreat to the capitol. During the siege of Tsuruga castle Yae dons her brother's uniform and rallies the riflemen, using her Spencer carbine to good effect.

I found this season riveting and watched it in pretty much a single sitting. While there is quite a bit of action, there are no big Hollywood battle scenes as most of the fighting shown is between small groups in the streets and woods around Yae's home town. Much of the plot revolves around how the people of Aizu prepare to meet an almost inevitable defeat at the hands of their enemies. This season may be challenging for some western audience members to identify with as it couples a uniquely Asian stoicism with a flair for the melodramatic. (For example, a person may write a poem and then commit bloody ritual suicide to atone for some mistake. When the death is reported to their loved ones, the survivors weep with pride and approval and later build a statue to commemorate the act, which is not how most western families would react.) Certain scenes left me shocked.

This set contains episodes 21-30 on three discs in a fold out cardboard case. There are optional Chinese or English subtitles. I believe this is a licensed Chinese version of the Japanese drama. The cover picture really should be on season 5 as it shows Yae and her husband in western clothes, which has nothing to do with the contents of this set. (She hasn't even met him yet by the end of the season.) The picture on the season 5 DVD set (Yae in a man's uniform holding her rifle) should actually go on this season's cover.

All in all, another great season that I highly recommend. Definitely do not watch without having seen the previous two seasons, though. Due to the violent content, I would not recommend showing this to children under the age of 13 or so.",1482451200,,2733,4.594262295081967
