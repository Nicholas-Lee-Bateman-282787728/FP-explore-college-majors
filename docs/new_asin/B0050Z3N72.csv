This movie was one of the most touching and moving ""Boy and his Dog"" movies I have ever seen. The acting is good, the dog is wonderful and the well done story and the movie is a tear-jerker worth shedding tears over. It also portrays the love and devotion a dog and can have for a person quite well. The boy and the dog are naturals together too. It is this movie that set me on the path I am still on today, working with and rescuing dogs in need. Just how good is this movie? I was only able to watch it all the way through to the end once. It's that moving. The only other movie about a dog I can say that about is ""Old Yeller"". This great little movie never got the caring treatment and restoration it should have. This offering here may be not be a pristine copy but it is still the original movie and worth a view. The later version remade from Disney is good, but not as good as the original. And if you really want to see yet another great classic movie about a dog; see ""Good-bye, My Lady"" made in 1956, with Walter Brennan, Brandon deWilde, Sidney Poitier and a Basenji dog. Just keep that box of tissues close by..",1476057600,2,1244,4.040485829959514

8452118,5,B0050Z3N72,"This recommendation is for the 1940 version of this movie starring Billy Lee as Lonnie McNeil (the main character who is incredible as a very young boy), Cordell Hickman as Lonnie's friend Text Lee (who says he was named `Text' by his Mama because he was a Bible Boy), Richard Lane as Harvey McNeil; the father of young Lonnie, Helene Millard as Mrs. McNeil - Lonnie's mother, Lester Matthews as Mr. Ames; the new absentee landlord and kennel owner, and Fred `Snowflake' Toones as `Sermon' the farm sharecropper.  Tiverton Invader ably plays `Promise' - the outcast runt dog from the litter of promising bird dogs.  The story is about two little boys that have enough faith in a `throw away dog' they name `Promise'.  Promise was given to the boys by Mr. Ames early in the movie after a promise was made between them.  At first Mr. Ames, who had just purchased the farm where Lonnie's father is the caretaker and dog trainer - wants to sell out and go into cattle or horses.  But good sense prevails when Ames decides to give dogs a brief try.  During Ames first visit to the farm he meets Lonnie and Text.  That is where he promises to give them a dog of their own someday.  When they first get Promise as a little pup the dog ends up in every kind of mischief imaginable.  Promise breaks free and steals eggs from the farm chicken house; an act that automatically brands any dog a `Biscuit Eater' - a not so endearing term describing a worthless dog that looks only after itself.  Lonnie's father orders Promise banished from the premises since Promise early on set bad store and example for the rest of the kennel.  Lonnie's Dad was worried that Promise would ruin the good bird dog stock and his own reputation as a fine dog trainer.  However, Lonnie's and Text's faith is so powerful that they hide Promise regardless of the father's instructions to get rid of the dog.  These determined little boys find a way to care for, raise and train Promise to not only be a great dog, but the finest bird dog that likely ever lived.  Promise performs for these boys owing to their love and devotion to him.  Lonnie and Text finally enter Promise in the grand championship trials for bird dogs. The favorite is `Georgia Boy' bred and trained by the boys' fathers at the famous dog kennels owned by Mr. Ames.  If Georgia Boy doesn't win, the fathers may both lose their jobs.  You will have to watch the rest of the movie to find out what happens.  This is one of the best acted and best written movies I have seen.  This movie is not to be confused with the later Disney release.  Although difficult to find, The 1940 version of the Biscuit Eater is not to be missed.",1310083200,19,2662,4.472049689440993
