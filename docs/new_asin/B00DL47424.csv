5825199,5,B00DL47424,"Simply put, one of the best films of the year. Kudos to the cast, not a misstep among them. Liam James was outstanding as Duncan.

5825200,4,B00DL47424,"What drew me to this movie in the first place is how it got released now in a time where summer blockbusters seem to dominate. 'The Way, Way Back' tells the story of awkward 14 year old Duncan (Liam James) who goes on a summer beach vacation with his family and secretly discovers this water park called Water Wizz where he gets employed by a free spirit named Owen (Sam Rockwell). Duncan first appears to be rather depressed and subdued, but gradually some interesting changes occur. There are good moments of poignancy in this comedy, as well as the subtleties of family dynamics. And Steve Carell plays such a jerk.",1375142400,3,618,4.627272727272727
5825201,5,B00DL47424,"Saw this in the theatres and had to pre-order it. A very funny movie that reminds me a lot of Meatballs with Bill Murray with a more current theme. We found it quite funny, moving and powerful.",1375142400,4,193,4.243243243243243
5825202,5,B00DL47424,"The Academy Award winning writing team (The Descendants) of Nat Faxon and Jim Rash are back at it with the coming-of-age drama, The Way Way Back.  Both Faxon and Rash write, direct, and act in the film, which stars Liam James as Duncan - a shy, uncertain 14-year-old that travels to an East Coast vacation house for the summer with his mother, Pam (Toni Collette), his mother's boyfriend, Trent (Steve Carell), and Trent's daughter, Steph (Zoe Levin).  Trent and Duncan have a rocky relationship due to Trent seemingly always picking on Duncan or isolating him in some way - forcing Duncan into a world of seclusion.  After arriving at the coast, Duncan feels out of place and miserable until one afternoon when he encounters Owen (Sam Rockwell), the manager of a local waterpark.  Owen befriends Duncan, gives him a job, and encourages him to have fun while being his own person and creating his own path in life.  The dramatic-comedy's supporting cast also includes Allison Janney, Rob Corddry, Amanda Peet, Jim Rash, and Nat Faxon.

While the plot of this film is nothing new, it really does capture the essence and purpose of making a ""coming-of-age"" film.  In order for a film of this nature to succeed, a distinct antagonist really has to emotionally hammer away at the protagonist before the push-back occurs.  Oddly enough, Steve Carell is the antagonist in this film, a role which is completely unlike him, yet he pulls it off in an entertaining, proficient manner.  It's hard to believe - during his scenes in the film - that's he's still the same funny-man that brought us Michael Scott in The Office, and the roles of Brick Tamland in Anchorman and Andy Stitzer in The 40-Year-Old Virgin.  For once, it was an absolute pleasure to watch Carell in a role where he doesn't have to rely on being funny or outlandish.  Carell's dramatic roles are few and far between, but he has previously thrived as these rarely-acted characters, the most notably of which can be found in Little Miss Sunshine.  Speaking of Little Miss Sunshine, Carell is once again reunited with Toni Collette for the first time since the 2006 road drama.

There are literally not enough great things to say about the entire cast of The Way Way Back.  Outside of Carell's dramatic performance, Sam Rockwell steals the show.  He brings such a unique enthusiasm to his roles, which is one of the many reasons he's become such a well-respected and sought-after actor.  There's very little doubt Rockwell is well on his way to earning himself an Academy Award - since he's far too talented to not have one already.  Along with Rockwell, the talented Liam James is also making quite a name for himself.  At only 16 years old, James has already had significant roles on television, but none more important than his big screen feature role in The Way Way Back.  James does an admirable job in the role of Duncan - the quiet loner who is searching for his identity.  He brings raw emotion to the screen and meshes well in the role of Rockwell's befriended protg.

As the film begins, trying to dissect the title of the film is a bit of a head-scratcher.  It's an unusual name for a film, and while it's initially unclear what it means, mostly due to the symbolism only being in the first and last scenes of the film, the title really does earn its meaning by the time the credits roll.  This is a moving film about a boy growing up, finding his own way and becoming his own person, despite being neglected and ridiculed.  Not only is the script well-rounded with the perfect amount of drama and comedy, it's also a respectable theme-driven film that can be watched over and over with enjoyment.  Writers and directors Nat Faxon and Jim Rash have written another gem, and have created one of the most heartwarming, entertaining films of the year.

Overall, The Way Way Back should be seen by anyone and everyone without hesitation.  It features an all-around brilliant cast, in which each member plays their roles exquisitely.  Aside from the slightly predictable and recycled plot, the film has something to offer all movie lovers.  The Way Way Back is full of charm, charisma, and honesty, meshing perfectly with the incorporation of family drama and teenage fun.  Even though this well-written script is a bright spot, the plot is still overshadowed by the superb acting of Steve Carell, Sam Rockwell, and the rest of the supporting cast.  There's very little doubt that after viewing this film, you'll be hard-pressed to find a more enjoyable family film thus far in 2013.

5825204,5,B00DL47424,"why aren't these captivating movies given a chance at wide release, im fortunate to have a one movie theater, (yes a single movie theater, tix less than $9) that shows these kind of indie independent type of films.... This movie, The Way Way Back, is definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a really long time. The cast, the story line, dialogue, all of it together makes one amazing Film !

It's not often we find ourselves wrapped up in the life of a character, laughing and crying right long with him, and to have the audience clap at the end of the movie, should show the entire crew working to make this Film know that they did a stellar job.

The movie follows a young teen who is 15 on a summer beach vacation with his Mom and her boyfriend, and his daughter. His mom is wrapped up in her boyfriend and the young boy feels left out, feels like he does not amount to much. He befriends a manager of a local waterpark who gives him a job and the two form a really nice friendship, the older one is more like a mentor, gives the boy confidence and self assurance that he IS someone important, which gives him the courage to tackle some issues in his own life.

It's a great story, the soundtrack is good, the filming location is really pretty and its an overall fun movie, family friendly, really no bad language or sex scenes which would make it okay for some of the younger teens whose parents are being cautious about what their children see.

I just wish it was in more mainstream theaters among these ""popular"" movies, which really amount to nothing compared with this Movie. Please if you are able to find it, even if you have to drive more than a half hour or more, make a trip out of, grab dinner and a movie, you will not be disappointed. It's not often I desire to see a movie at the Theater more than once, but this one, Yes I think I will make an exception.

Steve Carell and Toni Collette did a great job as his Mom and boyfriend, Duncan, the main character was also ""young Shawn Spencer"" for you Psych Fans.
Sam Rockwell did just a great job befriending Duncan and really making him feel like he was someone important in this world.

Five Stars, no question.",1374883200,11,2183,4.31219512195122
5825205,4,B00DL47424,"The writers from ""The Decedents"" Nat Faxon and Jim Rash co-directed as well as co-wrote this charming coming-of-age movie.  Duncan (Liam James) is a shy 14 year old in route to a beach town and a cabin owned by his mother Pam's (Toni Collette) boyfriend Trent (Steve Carell).  Along for the ride is Trent's teen aged daughter Steph (Zoe Levin).  We know things are bad right away as Duncan has to ride in in the ""way back"" backward facing seat in Trent's restored vintage Buick station wagon.

Playing against type, Carell's Trent is a real jerk, but he sees himself as a sophisticated stud.  Once at the cabin, Trent restarts a friendship with Kip and Joan (Rob Corddry and Amanda Peet).  Joan also wants to reignite an affair with Trent and Trent is welcoming even as he courts Pam.  Feeling lonely, Duncan strikes up a friendship with Owen (Sam Rockwell), the owner of the local water park.  Faxon and Rash have supporting roles as employees of the park along with Maya Rudolph, a potential love interest for Owen.

Rockwell rocks as Owen a sloppy, lazy manager but with a quick wit and a heart of gold.  Owen takes Duncan under his wing as the adults in his life constantly get drunk and/or high along with their wild next door neighbor Betty (Allison Janney).  Eventually Duncan does get the courage to talk to Betty's very cute but older daughter Susanna (Anna Sophia Robb).

The movie is sweet and realistic as the reserved Duncan finds his voice and his way.  His eyes are opened to some of the sadness and disappointments of the adults in his life.  In many ways the movie can be faulted for its predictability but at the same time, there are surprises and a hope for better days ahead for most of the characters.  Well, certainly not Trent, the cad.",1374796800,4,1759,4.592948717948718
5825206,4,B00DL47424,"The Way Way Back is a follow up to The Descendants for writer/director pair Nat Faxon and Jim Rash that premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival.  It is a coming of age film focused on an awkward teenager named Duncan (Liam Jones) who has been forced on a vacation with his mother and her new boyfriend Trent (Steve Carell).  The relationship between Duncan and Trent is uneasy to say the very least.  The film opens with Trent telling Duncan that, on a scale of 1 to 10, Duncan is a 3.  Duncan wishes he could be with his father, all while he continues to become more and more disgusted with his mother's choice in Trent.  From their summer beach house he finds a bicycle and makes his way to Water Wizz, a local water park built during the 1980s, and run by Owen (Sam Rockwell) and his girlfriend Caitlyn (Maya Rudolph).  At Water Wizz Duncan finds a place where he belongs as his family life continues to devolve back at the beach house.

When The Way, Way Back is centered on the story of a boy living in a divorced family and dealing with his mother's new boyfriend The Way, Way Back is a spot on, honest movie about a teenager growing up in a divided family.  The material at Water Wizz is also enjoyable.  The Way, Way Back does have weaknesses in deriving humor froma generic, disobedient teenage girl  (Trent's daughter) and setting up a sort of romance between Duncan and the girl next store which is essentially the same romance you see in every other coming of age movie.

Occasionally hard to sit through due to the overwhelming awkwardness of the situations, one cannot penalize The Way Way Back for its accuracy.  The moments watching 14 year old Duncan respond to his mother and Trent are incredibly genuine and do set the film apart.  It is a rough subject matter to address in film, but it is done well here and is in no way sugar coated.

The acting is, like the plot, down to earth.  All the characters are believable.  Steve Carell is an unlikable character, and we are not meant to support him, but the character of Trent does exist as a human being.  The most eccentric role (not to mention, most entertaining) is Sam Rockwell's Owen, but even then we're left with a character who one could easily imagine meeting at a water park.

Despite some missteps, and coming of age clichs, The Way, Way Back sells itself on its honesty.  Although it doesn't manage to break new ground it is different enough to recommend it to viewers who are willing to sit through it.  If you lived through a divorce as a child the film could either be a tear jerker or it could be a trigger you'd rather not sit through.  From my point of view, it was worth sitting through even with the harsh memories it dug up.  If you're looking for an honest, sometimes humorous, often times serious look at a teen living in a post-divorce family then you should give The Way, Way Back a watch.",1374624000,46,2886,4.436432637571158
5825207,4,B00DL47424,"I had seen the trailer for this movie a number of times in recent weeks at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati and couldn't wait to see this movie. The movie finally opened today, and I went to see it right away.

""The Way, Way Back"" (2013 release; 103 min.) tells the story of 14 yr. old Duncan (played by newcomer Liam James) who, along with his mom Pam (played by Toni Collette), her boyfriend Trent (played by Steve Carell) and his 16 or 17 yr. old daughter Stephanie, are going to spend the summer at Trent's summer house on a beach somewhere in Massachusetts. Right as the movie opens, Trent and Duncan get into an already destined-to-be-a-classic exchange: Trent: ""On a scale of 1 to 10, how do you see yourself?""; Duncan: ""a 6""; Trent: ""a 6? more like a 3... Let's try and get that score up this summer!"". Duncan has a hard time fitting in with anyone but he does seem to be able to talk to Suzanna, the neighbor's daughter who's just a bit older than him. Duncan then strikes gold when he is able to get a job at the local water amusement park (called Water Wizz, which in fact does exist in real life under that name) and gets taken under the wings of the park's manager Owen (played by Sam Rockwell). It doesn't mean that all is well, though. But to tell you more of the plot would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first, this is yet another coming-of-age movie in the last several month's, after ""Mud"" and ""The Kings of Summer"", yet this one clearly stands apart from the previous two, both in its bitter-sweet tone, and its depth. Second, this movie is a labor of love for writers-directors Nat Faxon and Jim Rash (they also have a small acting part in the movie), as they have been trying to make this movie for years (winning an Oscar for best screenwriting for ""The Descendants"" a few years ago finally got them on track for this movie). Third, the movie is a nice study of how people, both young and adults, adjust to new situations (following divorce). Most of the immediate families we get to know in the movie comprise of single moms, either with or without a new husband or boyfriend. Fourth, the movie just oozes great acting performances, none more so that from Liam James as the awkward teenager who is flailing his arms about as he is trying go get comfortable with himself and those around him. And what about Steve Carell, who is cast against type, in a role 180 degrees away from the likeable guy he usually plays. Here he plays a jerk whom you'd like to slap in the face and yell ""look at all the hurt you're causing to people you supposedly love"". Carell pulls it off brilliantly. Other notables include Maya Rudolph (as one of the waterpark managers), and Allison Janney as Betty, the loud and possible alcoholic neighbor. She is as outrageous as she is funny. Last but not least, the movie features a great soundtrack (which is available on CD) with tracks from indie-artists like Edie Brickell, Wild Belle, and Ben Kweller, just to name those. (There are also several 80s hits from Mr. Mister, INXS, etc.)

When doing a coming-of-age movie like this, there is a thin line between bitter-sweet/moving and overly sentimental. This movie never gets too sentimental. Instead, the directors bring what feels like a very authentic, even if fictional, story about young adults fitting in and also broken families. I'll admit that I was pretty much choking up the last 15-20 min. of the movie. The screening I saw this at today was very well attended, and this movie seems to have all the makings of a hit movie on the art-house theatre circuit. If it wasn't clear enough by now, ""The Way, Way Back"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1374192000,46,3739,4.544510385756676

Sam Rockwell is awesome in it. Steve Carell plays a bad guy for a change. It reminds me of my youth in the 1970's, but this movie time frame is the 80's, dealing with a bad, soon to be step parent.  We even had a big old 1972 Station Wagon just like the one in the movie, which is why the movie is named 'The way,way back'.  That is where the older teen kids sat. This teen found himself and grew emotionally working at a water park over the summer.

While the youths representation is slightly conspicuous, hes the sort of kid who middle America feels was them at the age of 14; chronically hitting road blocks with family and friends until sheepishly coming out of the shell. Everyone needs a Sam Rockwell in their lives, and his casting for The Way Way Back couldn't have been better, with character flaws and all.

I loved how it demonstrates to teens that just one person can affect your self-worth negatively, but also how just one person can bring you back up to see how worthy you really are.  He was living a life that no one knew about..... And it was the really good part of his life.  His mom came around, so that made ithe film so much better....

5825324,5,B00DL47424,"The older I get (I'm 40) and the more I experience of life's highs and lows (more low than high lately), the more I gravitate to these type of quirky, offbeat, indie ""dramedies"".  The stories and characters just feel more real, human, and relateable than most Hollywood stuff.  Right up my alley.  Its like they opened up a new world to me and made me realize its ok to just be myself, not some ""normal"", soulless, successful, macho, ""alpha male"" cliche.  Highly flawed but basically good hearted people just trying to do their best, in their own messed up way, to make sense of and survive this Type A, capitalist, Trump-loving society and scary world of ""normal"" people and ""grown-ups"" ::shudder::.  Sign me up.  My kind of people.

Related to the protagonist so much (despite being much older, haha).  Great movie that celebrates just staying true to yourself, regardless of what other people think.  Anyway, so if anyone out there (of all ages) has ever felt different from the herd, ever felt lost, alienated, or like they don't belong in this world, I'd definitely recommend this movie to you, my fellow misfit and kindred spirit :)  If you agree with my review at all, you can mostly find me these days at twitter dot com/ShyLivesMatter Peace :)",1494374400,,1252,4.728110599078341

To me this reminds me of those teenage beach movies of the late 70s...Zuma Beach etc. But the writing is better and funnier. I guess this is aimed mainly for the younger audience, but as an older adult who is young at heart, I really did enjoy this movie. I was one of those very awkward teens, and this brought back so many memories. Sam Rockwell is hilarious in this I thought also.

Yeah this theme has been explored many times in tons of movies..coming of age, awkward teen who feels like he doesn't belong but finds a way to belong in the end blah blah blah. And yeah it's a total fluff movie. Not a ""deep thinking"" movie by any means, altho it deals with divorce and step parents and the effect it has on the children involved. But having said that, it's still a very good movie. There's times I don't want a ""heavy"" ""deep"" movie and this brings me back to my teen years long gone now. Made me laugh and tear up a little at times and that's all I ask from a movie when I watch it. I'd recommend this to anyone.",1485388800,,1084,4.161904761904762

Trying not to give away anything in this review, I just have to say I enjoyed the movie, as it dealt with real family and personal issues that will make you feel the emotions.  Similar to what I feel when I watch movies like Little Miss Sunshine and for some reason, I hearkened back to Meatballs for some of the sentiments (although I wouldn't classify this movie as a comedy).",1474588800,,670,4.430894308943089

5825513,5,B00DL47424,"Socially awkward teenager Duncan is on a family vacation for the summer and couldn't be more miserable. His mothers boyfriend Trent is the worst of his tormentors. In the car ride on the way to the summer home, on a scale of one to ten, Trent gives Duncan a three and tells him to get that number up by putting [himself] out there. As Trent and his daughter continually berate Duncan, Duncans mother is powerless to do anything to stop them. The only place the awkward teenager can find any happiness is at a local water park run by a sarcastically humorous slacker named Owen. Trent destroys Duncans self-esteem and Owen rebuilds it.

What makes me give this movie an A+ above all else is the believability of each character. When I say Duncan is a socially awkward teenager, Im not lying. He keeps to himself most of the time, hes constantly frowning, he speaks with a blunt affect, and he cant make conversation with cute girls without making them uncomfortable. Duncan sounds like a teenaged version of me in real life, so you're damn right Im rooting for him to find the love and friendship he needs.

Trent is the exact opposite of what a heroic character should be. He criticizes Duncan for every little thing, he cheats on Duncans mother while criticizing her as well, and pretty much has no redeemable qualities. TV Tropes dot org would refer to him as a Complete Monster, which is an annoying sociopath with no likeable traits. I used to have a step-father named Art and he was a living, breathing caricature of Trent. Naturally, I keep cheering for Trent to get flattened by a steamroller.

Owen, the water park owner who builds Duncans self-worth, is everything you could ever want in a role model (apart from the slacking off). Hes funny without being mean, hes sarcastic, hes charismatic, and whenever hes not being goofy, his serious side is believable and warm. One of my favorite lines from Owens dialogue is when he sees Duncan sitting slouched over on a beach chair and jokingly says, Excuse me, sir, Im afraid Im going to have to ask you to leave. Youre having way too much fun and its making everyone uncomfortable. Duncan actually tries to get up and leave before Owen says, That wasn't even my best material!

The entire character roster of The Way Way Back is special in some way. Peter is a nerdy kid who has to wear an eye-patch because his eye stares too far to the right. Susanna is a cutie pie who tries to bring Duncan out of his shell with borderline romantic love. Even Pam (Duncans mother) has moments when we can root for her despite her passiveness toward Trents abusive ways.

The Way Way Back is a movie a lot of people can relate to. Okay, so not everybody gets to work at a water park with a charismatic charmer. There are times, however, when we feel out of place. We all have someone we consider to be our greatest critic and we all have someone who will pick us up if we seek out that persons help. The movie reminds us that love is out there and its ours for the taking. It may be far away, it may be much closer. Either way, its there if you look for it. It doesnt have to be a kissy-kissy kind of love. It could just be a casual friendship. Somebody out there likes you and somebody out there cares. Thats not just a myth perpetuated by cheesy romance movies. Thats gods honest truth. A life without love of some kind is the true definition of loneliness. If you ever feel this way, don't let any jerk call you a three out of ten. Rankings can never determine the true worth within us all.",1473552000,21,3534,4.447530864197531

5825563,5,B00DL47424,"Without a doubt, this is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  This coming-of-age story focuses on Duncan, who goes on summer vacation with his mom and her new boyfriend.  Steve Carell plays the very unfunny boyfriend, Trent, who thinks that the introverted Duncan just needs some brutal honesty and tough love.

The highlight of the film is watching Duncan come into his own under the watch of Owen (Sam Rockwell) at the local water park. Rockwell channels his best Bill Murray ala Meatballs, and the result is a fantastic character who serves as Duncan's anchor.

5825766,5,B00DL47424,"I happened upon this movie while flipping channels one day.  I caught it halfway through so, having totally enjoyed the last half of the movie, I had to find the next showing to record.  Once recorded, I watched it every time any of my family members who hadn't seen it decided to watch it.

Now, it has been a while since the movie was shown on cable so I had to break down and buy it - it is such a great little summer movie.  The characters are well developed, with such realism and quirkiness to be endearing.  The feel of the movie reminded me of being a kid and that feeling of not fitting in a particular situation but it has such an innocence to it, that the inappropriate adult behavior in this movie is not in your face, but more of a nuance.  This movie has such a great woven story with the main thread being the innocent, sort of neglected kid getting to have the best summer ever!

This will always be one of my top favorites - and it's suitable for most anyone!  I watched it with my teenagers and both loved it.",1464307200,,1027,4.177664974619289

5826101,4,B00DL47424,"Watched The Way Way Back Featuring Featuring Liam James (2012) as Duncan , Steve Carrell (Get Smart) as Trent Ramsey , Toni Colette (Little Miss Sunshine) as Pam, Allison Janney( Juno) as Betty Thompson ,The Stunning AnnaSophia Robb(Soul Surfer) as Susanna Thompson , Amanda Peet(Syriana) as Joan , Maya Rudolph(Grown Ups )as Caitlyn and Sam Rockwell (Moon) as Owen. There are some movies which sound so simple that it's hard to convey to people just how good they are. The Way, Way Back is one of those movies. It's simply a coming-of-age story about a 14-year-old boy over the course of his summer break. There are no big action scenes or special effects here, just really good writing with actors who can bring such a realistic story to life.

The movie begins with the boy, Duncan, riding in a car with his family to his mother's boyfriend's beach house. As the mother sleeps in the passenger seat, the boyfriend asks Duncan to rate himself on a scale of 1 to 10. After replying with a 6, the boyfriend insists that he's just a 3. What's surprising is that this seemingly heartless guy that the mother is dating is played by Steve Carell. Carell is known for playing lovable and funny characters. But he switches it up with this role. That scene sets the tone for how little Duncan is looking forward to this summer trip. And it doesn't help that his mother doesn't really set her boyfriend straight even when she is awake.

To escape the annoyances at his new temporary home, Duncan takes a bike to ride around town with. When he finds a way into the local water park, he meets one of the middle-aged operators there named Owen. Duncan seems fascinated by Owen and how he uses humor in almost everything he says. It seems like he's never met anyone like him who's so worry-free and exudes such confidence all the time. Owen manages to get Duncan a job at the park where he tries to instill some of that same confidence in him as well. It becomes clear that as they bond with each other, Duncan wishes this would be the kind of guy his mother would date instead. The job at the water park also opens up a whole new fun side that this 14-year-old kid didn't even know he had in him. Amazing score by Rob Simonsen(500 Days Of Summer), Costume Design By Michelle Matland(Closer) & Ann Roth(Signs ) and Amazing Direction/Writing by Nat Faxon(The Descendents) & Jim Rash(Adopted) Truly heartfelt and Hilarious Dramedy 8/10",1451952000,,2421,4.614849187935035
5826102,4,B00DL47424,"In the Way, Way Back, 14 year-old Duncan travels with his Mother, the mother's boyfriend, Trent, and his daughter to a cottage for the summer.  Duncan is not too impressed with Trent and the latter believes Duncan rates only a 3 out of 10.

Things soon pick up for Duncan when he meets a girl that is living next door to him and he encounters a gentleman, Owen, at a local water park.  At this point, Duncan would rather be at the water park then at home as he only feels happy when he is at the park with Owen and the other crew.

Duncan later discovers that Trent is having an affair and wants his Mother to end it with him, but she refuses, and Duncan later discovers that his father didn't want custody of him.  After a late night at the water park, Duncan arrives back to find out that his Mother and Trent are leaving the cottage early, but Duncan is reluctant to leave.

In the end, Duncan makes one final stop at the water park to say goodbye to Owen and he eventually leaves with his Mom and Trent, but the ending is rather interesting.

I was impressed with the acting of Liam James (Duncan) and Sam Rockwell (Owen) in the film; many critics thought Rockwell should have been nominated for an academy award and I can see why after a spirited performance.",1451692800,5,1264,4.30801687763713
5826103,5,B00DL47424,Really well written movie. Love the concept,1451347200,,43,5.285714285714286
5826104,5,B00DL47424,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and almost definitely my favorite drama. Every character is so realistic, and you see certain characters as people you know yourself. The Way Way Back captures a part of a 14-year-old boy's life that changes him for the better. Some characters change while others stay in their little ruts. I think the title is perfect; this is a story about people and how sometimes to move forward, you have to go back. You have to find yourself.

Duncan is a teenager that is mature for his age, but he has problems connecting with people and finding something to capture his attention. His mother is trying to forget about her problems and live it up with her new boyfriend, Trent, who is pretty much just a jerk. Owen is an immature adult, but as he starts to help Duncan loosen up he realizes he has some maturing to do himself. The point is, everyone has problems. I only named a few of the main characters, but nearly every person onscreen is fleshed out really well.

I'm a fan of independent films, but this one really tops the list. The Way Way Back grabs your attention from the first second and keeps you watching. Duncan is the awkward teenager that actually exists in real life, and the way he starts to come out of his shell is real. Speaking from personal experience, most movies and television shows with the ""awkward/shy teen"" don't really understand what it means to be shy. They assume the person just doesn't like people...but like Duncan, he just doesn't know HOW. He wants to but feels the weight of the world on his shoulders. He wants to be somewhere else, with different people. But like Owen says, ""Carve your own path."" And Duncan starts to see the upside in life, rather than just the downside.

5826160,5,B00DL47424,"Ok ok the title may be both corny and a tiny bit overboard but even still I really like this movie. Written and Directed by the team of Jim Rash amd Nat Faxon (The Descendants) ,the film features some well known names such as Steve Carrall (The Office, Dan In Real Life) in a rare serious/bad guy role, Allison Janney (Juno, Mom) , and Toni Collette (Little Miss Sunshine) as well as young Liam James (Psych, The Killing). Liam does a very good job playing the down in the dumps Duncan and Sam Rockwell's Owen toes the line between loveable and d-bag. Sam & Liam work really well together, but I would be remiss if I didn't give props to AnnaSophia Robb and Maya Rudolph as well. All this talk makes me want to watch it again...

5826355,5,B00DL47424,I love this show.  It is great for teenagers and adults alike.  It has some very significant family issues that are addressed with a young 14 year old boy that goes with his mom and her boyfriend to a summer beach town.  His mom makes some very poor choices because of insecurities and this young boy has plenty because of his age and his awkward situation.  He actually ends up learning some important lessons and making some friends that had a wonderful positive influence in his life at this difficult time.  He ends up teaching his mother a thing or two about priorities.  It is funny and thoughtful.  THe only weird thing for me was Steve Carell's character.  He was the biggest jerk and I just couldn't see Steve Carell as a jerk..,1439424000,,737,4.488721804511278

5826387,5,B00DL47424,"I've seen this movie at least half a dozen times and it's one of my favorites. It's a thoughtful and ultimately joyous little movie, as the main character (a sullen, unhappy teenager whose mother's jerky new boyfriend and his daughter clearly disdain him) discovers (and then must leave prematurely) a place where people like him and accept him for who he is.  If you enjoy movies that actually make you think--about human behavior and why the characters do what they do--this movie is very satisfying. It is funny without aiming for non-stop hilarity, and touching without being melodramatic.  They weren't trying to make a blockbuster here, just a movie that feels like a little slice of real life.

As an aside, we recently visited Water Wizz, the water park  where much of this movie was filmed, and came away pleased by how the movie captured, authentically and affectionately, the spirit of the place.  They really didn't change anything for the movie.  Yes, it's small, slightly shabby, and a bit corny, and for people used to  huge, shiny and slick theme parks  it may be a disappointment.  But it's family-owned and it feels like a labor of love--when you reflect on what a gruesome winter we had here in New England, the fact that anyone could be optimistic enough to build a water park in a place where you can only operate it for three months out of the year feels downright miraculous. It may not be the best thing for the environment, but they seem to understand how much we need a little summer fun to help get us through the long cold winter ahead.",1438473600,3,1564,4.658181818181818

Sam Rockwell is a little too old for the part he is playing, but he nonetheless nails it. He is the highlight of the film. Steve Carell plays a real jerk and does a good job as well.

But he finds an unlikely role model in a ""grown-up"" lifeguard at the local water park and makes a place for himself. Steve Carell plays the perfect casual tormenter, Toni Collette is the mother who'll put up with a lot for this chance at something like love, and Sam Rockwell brings his usual devilish charm but keeps it realistic, playing the lifeguard who hasn't yet grown up. This movie doesn't tie everything up in a neat little bow; it's more like real teen years, where you make incremental steps.",1431907200,,746,4.8359375

5826784,5,B00DL47424,"I picked this up based on the description on the DVD cover, as I'm a sucker for these teen-coming of age type stories, and I was not disappointed In the least. The writing is top notch, and the acting is amazing, even from the younger actors. Steve Carell nails the part of the overbearing boyfriend, and Liam James owns his role as the protagonist. Sam Rockwell, however, steals the show, although not easily. His delivery is spot-on, reminding me of Ryan Reynolds, or Jeremy Piven at their comedic best.
The term coming of age might be the wrong tag to this story, but it deals with teen angst concerning families, fitting in, and finding your identity. Filled with lots of laughs, touching moments, and just the right amount of doubt from the characters as they struggle to grow <or avoid growing). The Way Way Back is a film I look forward to sharing with family and friends. Its moving without being heavy handed, funny and over-all entertaining. I find it hard to believe that anyone could watch this film and absolutely hate it, when there is so much to love.",1427587200,,1066,4.61578947368421
5826785,4,B00DL47424,"The Way, Way Back
 I admit that the clever title escapes me.  The Way, Way Back takes a home movie of 13 year old Duncan (Liam James), his mom (Toni Collette), her boyfriend (Steve Carell) and his daughter as they spend a few days at the beach on a kind of pre-nuptial family vacation.  The adults want to marry and thus blend the families, each once torn by modern family-life fractures.  The acting is top notch, including Carell in a dramatic role.  Never mind that the film is billed as a comedy.  Do not be taken in.  This film is as serious as acne.
 13 year old Duncan has more on his plate than he can cope with.  The movie action swirls around him, a tempest of lust, ill-behavior and rejection.  His dad lives across the continent and wants him not.  His mother desperately yearns for a stable man in her life.  She and her boyfriend party down with some old friends of his.  This shows the young lad how much fun you can have even if you are terribly old if you just have enough alcohol.  Many many empty booze bottles great the family every morning.  Amanda Peet plays well the half deranged friend with eyes for the boy friend.
 The plot flows, rises and tumbles all around the poor 13 year kid.  He can scarcely communicate-to anyone not just the adults.  The characters storm and crash around the boy.  And he has the older next door beauty to deal with as well.  She is 15 or 16 (and played by the lovely 20 year old Anna Sophia Robb of Soul Surfer fame) and dealing with the same kinds of problems.  Sam Rockwell as Owen the witty loser who runs the local water park rescues the lad and gives him the self confidence to go on.
 I found this three star movie a bit challenging.  We often cry for adult level movies and this qualifies in spite of the PG-13 rating.  There are no naked people, violence or language issues which normally come with an adult theme.  But the anguish of being 13 in a fractured household surrounded by people who use alcohol to self medicate in order to cope with their other problems is very adult.
 Nat Faxon and Jim Rush penned this very busy one hour 43 minute long tale.  They also directed it.  They also wrote themselves small but important roles as well.  I am sure they had fun making an emotionally charged, serious look at adolescence.  They made the film on a tiny $4.6 million budget but they have made some $23 million at the box office which is also fun.  Good for them, I liked it even if I might not understand it completely.
 Also note actress Maya Rudolph and child actor River Alexander who was very funny.",1427587200,,2569,4.3544303797468356

This was a very entertaining movie. The main kid really sold his part as an awkward teenager coming into his own. He showed a lot of depth as an actor as the movie progressed and he became more self confident. (Which is the main plot of the movie) He expertly grew the character to change from a dippy awkward teenager into a young adult with confidence.

Steve Carell plays a rare role as a jerk. That's out of his normal comfort zone as well but he nailed it.

Allison Janey adds some of the comic relief as the neighbor who's one step away from complete insanity.

Sam Rockwell steals the entire show though. He is a complete goof off who's taking the path of least resistance in life, but he provides the moral compass of the film and the guiding path for the main kid to grow into a self confident young man. As an added bonus he's absolutely hysterical as he provides that guidance.

The movie is funny. It's emotional. It's uplifting. It makes you hate Steve Carell (or he character at least). It's just 2 hours of good entertainment.",1427241600,,1067,4.507772020725389

This is pretty much a coming-of-age narrative, which manages to refresh an already crowded genre.

The film opens at the end of a road trip to their holiday let for the summer; our main protagonist is Duncan his family comprises of his single mother Pam, her arrogant boyfriend Trent and his, not so nice, teenage daughter. Meanwhile Duncan is relegated to the rear of the car way, way back. On first meeting Duncan, he is melancholy, distant 14-year-old Duncan (played aptly by Liam James). On the way to the beach house, Trent emotionally belittles Duncan, often making remarks and gestures that are demeaning and offensive to him. Trent asks Duncan to rate himself on a scale of one to ten, and tells Duncan he thinks Duncan is a three  thus begins their summer vacation: what could go wrong?

As Duncan emerges out of his shell he is befriended by Owen (Sam Rockwell) as the narrative moves on Duncan finds consolation in a clandestine summer job at Water Whiz, mentored by Sam Rockwell's jesting manager and an assortment of oddball employees.

This is a quirky film with some pretty good lines given over to the Sam Rockwell character. The cast performances across the board, by and large are good, however, the character of Rash as the camp Lewis, the kiosk attendant with no customers and no prospects of escape  is a real scene-stealer.

I watched his antics, analyzed his body language, and he showed he has diversity.  The sound track made me a fan of Edie Brickell--opening song.  Toni Collett, felt the pain, Allison Janney, was just lovable and could feel the anxiety of being her neighbor...however, she would could be a friend.  These ladies made me laugh, all of them.

5827327,5,B00DL47424,"A publicly underrated movie about the pains of growing up and being in a family traveling together that, like the similarly dysfunctional but loving Little Miss Sunshine, gets rolling and rolling until you can't get out of its way.  And like that movie, *most* of this one is very believable - and painful to watch.  No surprise, given who's in and involved with both movies.  Great writing and acting by quite a few people.  Maya Rudolph puts Sam Rockwell in his place in a good way :)  Loved it enough to re-watch it more than once - still not tired of it, and hope I won't be.  Won't ruin the ending, but it was pretty satisfying if you followed all of the subplots.

Love the way, way back station wagon - we used to have a similar nine-seater when I was a kid :)  Have to admit that when I first saw the trailer I thought it was about growing up in the '70s because of the station wagon, so I was very confused for the first few minutes of the movie.",1409443200,,955,4.208791208791209

5827398,5,B00DL47424,"This Film was a little strange but very good.  It reminded me of the movie Adventureland.  A young boy goes on a vacation with his mother and her boyfriend.  It is unfortunate when a child is more aware of the downfalls of a relationship (especially their mothers) than the people involved.  This boyfriend has made it verbally clear (when his mother isn't present) that the boy is a loser and he, unfortunately, feels like one.
Once they arrive at their summer destination, he has no friends, so he seeks solace at a waterland park. He starts to work there.  He tells no one. He just gets on his bike each day and goes there.  The staff has been working there forever (the kind of people that never want to grow up) and they take him in and treat him well and teach him how to have fun and how to grow into his own person.  There is a great resolution at the end but I don't want to spoil it.",1408233600,,893,4.2176470588235295

I do not think Steve Carell is funny...and I didn't want to watch this movie because he was in it.  I'm sure glad I did watch because he is not a funny guy in this movie at all and he actually does a really great job in the role of Trent.  Duncan is every kid who has been cast aside by a divorced parent looking for a new mate.  Owen is the guy that every one of these types of kids needs.  He's an F-up for sure, but his personal philosophy and rare blend (in a male) of kindness and openness make him a treasure.  This movie will make your heart sing, your mouth laugh out loud and your soul cry with frustration. We have all been at least one of the people in this story at one time in our lives. Groovy water park backdrop in an East Coast, old family money, beach community setting. Writing is excellent and both of the writers are in the film...Louis and Roddy.

Steve Carell was an excellent actor, perfect for the role.  At first I didn't even know it was Steve.  He played this tough macho guy, far different from the role of a softy, gayish-looking, 40 year old virgin.  Now that's a versatile actor.  However this Trent character could have been developed deeper: he's financially independent through hard work and never asked for anything from others, and expects others ( his step-son-to-be ) to man up and be an efficient individual like him.  His motivation is to motivate Duncan to be better.  But in Duncan's perspective, Trent was being hard on him, and Trent was being a jerk.  In truth, Trent is simply being human.  He's not perfect.  It was Trent's nature to be blunt and untactful.

I love the Betty character.  We all know one in real life.  A woman way past her prime, who still thinks she's sexy, and has that over the top joyful eccentricity.  I once was asked by a ""Betty"" to paint her nails when i was a teenager riding a bus home from a summer job.

Duncan is a teenager we can all relate to.  Children are the natural ""tape/video recorders"" - recording everything they now see and hear (,though they do not understand,) for later processing and analysis when they become adults trying to make sense of what they saw or heard.  Duncan is a very mature boy, and this movie is from Duncan's perspective and interpretation.

There is one minute logistic flaw in the movie: the relationship between Owen and Duncan.  Why did Owen take such great interest in Duncan?  It was established that Owen wasn't gay nor a pedophile.  But was a common hobby ( playing video games ) enough for Owen to take Duncan under his wings? What was Owen's motivation?  Did he always wanted to have a boy like Duncan?  Did he lost a brother as a child, and that Duncan reminded him of this loss? etc...

Also i'd like to see a subplot being developped between the teenage boys and girls.  At one point, Duncan was at the beach with 3 pretty girls.  One girl asked her boyfriend, ""Can i get into the water?""  Boyfriend said, ""Then get in the water""  and some gossips - did you know so and so broke up with so and so?  ...  We could develop a love triangle suplot here to spice things up a bit.

This is a wholesome movie, so simple, yet so sophisticated - a Classic to be.",1406937600,,2564,4.456896551724138

5827555,4,B00DL47424,"Call it them generation of68, the me generation, the millennial generation, generation X,Y, or Z any way you package it the growing of up years of each generation have been filled with more teenage angst and alienation that you  could shake a stick at. And while each generation has its own little sociological quirks, for example todays average teens are more likely to face their anxieties in single parent homes than say, the generation of 68, there are many more similarities. Take the film under review, The Way Way Back, definitely a 21st century teen angst coming of age film where this generation of 68er found himself uncomfortably squirming in his seat at various points remembering back to some very familiar episodes.

Now this film is billed as a comedy and in many ways it is but it also contains the raw data of themes that most teens run through-questions of self-esteem and self-identity, close and distant relationships with parents and the adult world generally, and the question of questions for most guys-what makes girls tick (most girls just flip the genders, okay). All of those are questions that our hero Duncan (played by Liam James) encounters and has to work through in dealing with his world one summer when he, his mother, Pam, her fairly new boyfriend, Trent (played by Steve Carroll), and his daughter, Steph, pack up to go to Trents summer place down in Cape Cod for some fun in the sun.

Naturally schools out for the summer so Duncan should be ready from the get-go for fun and checking out the girls at the beach. This thing however starts out as something like a prison camp for the alienated Duncan (including his initial hunched-up physical persona) who still hasn't resolved the break-up of the family home and his long gone dad and who moreover loathes Trent. And Trent and the summer time adult gang, including Pam, do nothing to alleviate that feeling as they drink and carouse the weeks away. What does alleviate some tensions  is meeting wild and wooly mad monk Owen who helps run the waterworks amusement park in town, gives Duncan a summer job and some serious, if at times comical, advise about how to survive until adulthood. Throw in a short, if chaste, relationship with the girl next door ( a fox whom he should have been all over from minute one once she came hither on him but he was too wrapped in the teen angst thing to see that he could have gone that summer route-but we all made those kinds of mistakes) and a scandalous confrontation with Pam and Trent over Trents backdoor affair with a neighbors wife to add to the pile of wisdom that Duncan figures out by the time that whole crowd leaves early to go home and try to survive until next summer. A few places toward the end were a little too feel good but this one is worth watching for the chuckles and the traumas.",1406419200,,2829,4.629482071713148

I am so sick of werewolf, vampire, crime, and ""shoot'emup ""  movies. This one is adorable. Unfortunately,Steve Carell's character is so obnoxious that I hate it when he interacts with Liam James. I don't know why I hadn't heard of this film before. It's difficult finding a family film that's not specific to little kids only. It's a terrific flick and I have suggested that friends and family view it.",1401321600,,618,4.63302752293578
5827702,4,B00DL47424,"The Way, Way Back is nothing more than a nice little family movie.  And I mean it when I say family movie.  If there's anything even remotely offensive taking place anywhere, I didn't notice.  That's not a bad thing of course, but there's quite a bit of aimless filler taking place (especially in the beginning) so it's not like I can claim the writing is stellar.  The characters themselves are fine however.  It just takes a while and a desire to sort through the predictable/boring portions in the beginning to really get into this movie.

It's about a shy teenage kid played by Liam James who doesn't want to go with his mom and her boyfriend (played by Steve Carell who I swear plays in at least 20 movies a year) to a vacation near the beach, but ends up forced to go along anyway.  This is one of the slowest moving storylines you could ever imagine because it takes forever for the boy to finally open up and overcome his shyness related to talking to girls and other people, and figuring out what he wants to do while he's there.  However the story clearly centers around him so we have to persevere it.  The comedy is on the light/harmless side the entire way through the film.  Basically all the actors are the right choices, the characters are memorable, the acting itself is pretty good but the storyline writing needs a lot of work because the way it is, it's just not interesting enough.

The one character that makes this movie Sam Rockwell's character.  Liam becomes friends with Sam at the water ride park.  He's definitely the one actor who spices up a light-hearted comedy in constant need of something to cover up the dryness and the slow movement of the storyline.  Perhaps the funniest part is that Steve Carell actually plays a strict tough stepdad to the teenage boy, and this is just hilarious on so many unintentional levels.  Steve Carell's the LAST person who should be playing this role.

Everything about the boy finding a summertime job at the water park, to his interaction with the teenage ladies, to the conflicts that arise with his mom and Steve Carell is all very competent storytelling, but nothing particularly special or what I'd consider must see entertainment which is why this movie is fairly overrated in my opinion.  Nothing special ever occurs.  Maybe we've reached a dead-end in this area pertaining to light family comedies, who knows.

Still, I found the Way, Way Back fun to watch and even laughed a few times so it can't be all *that* bad.  The kid with the apparent wandering eye was a minor pleasant addition (though his eyes looked fine to me- I must have missed something here).  Most of the humor comes when the boy goes to work at the water park thanks again, to Sam Rockwell's arrogant character.  Otherwise a good movie but nothing to write home about.  Oh and of course, when three boys become trapped in a slide tunnel at the water park and the technique Sam suggests to remove them.  THAT was probably the best moment of the movie!",1401321600,,2994,4.595103578154426

Self-consciousness already consumes you, but Duncan, the main character, also has to deal with a quasi-parent figure (Carell) that seems bent on crushing his already shaky self-esteem.

I couldn't even stand the main character any more.  His parents are divorced, his mom is spineless and is dating a dirt bag.  Steve Carell did a good job of being a dirt bag, but this movie did not convince me to keep watching.

No foul language or anything inappropriate. It's been a long time since I've seen such an innocent down to earth thoroughly  enjoyable movie.

This premise reminds me a lot of Meatballs with Bill Murray - except that it takes place in the Hamptons and especially at an old water park that gave me a lot of feelings of nostalgia (I was really into water parks growing up).  And of course Meatballs was a bit more family-oriented, this is not.  Some elements of the story are pretty dark (broken family drama, and one of Steve Carrell's least likeable characters) but there's so much that balances that out, a lot of fun moments both at the beach houses and the water slides.  And plenty of hot young babes in bikinis, no harm in that.  Anyway, the blu ray looks great, so far I have only watched to make sure it has English captions (useful if you're really into film/scripts/etc) and that it looks better than I would expect from dvd, which I think it does.",1400716800,,970,4.52

Duncan, a middle-school aged youth, is en route to his mother's boyfriend's beach house when the boyfriend, Trent, suddenly asks him what he thinks he is on a scale of 1-10.  Duncan says a 6; Trent belittles him by telling him he's a 3.  Duncan resigns himself to a boring, agonizing summer cozying up with his mom and Trent, but surprises await.

This is a great coming-of-age film and a refreshingly accurate depiction of all the age groups involved.  So many youth-oriented films, when written by adults, show the kid acting younger than his age group, or pursing fads that are more appropriate to the adult writer's generation.

I remember some of those ""outcast"" feelings as a teen - and the movie does a great job (sometimes a little over the top) of showing fractured families and miscommunications.

5827831,4,B00DL47424,"There are two main reasons to see THE WAY, WAY BACK. They are 1. The wonderful cast 2. The beautiful seaside location in Massachusetts. Although the story is somewhate predictable, this is an enjoyable and sweet little film. It's a coming-of-age story of 14-year-old Duncan (Liam James). He is dealing with the trauma of his parents' divorce. His mother Pam (Toni Collette) has found love again in the form of Trent (Steve Carell) who has a teenage daughter Steph (Zoe Levin). The four take a roadtrip to spend the summer at a cottage by the beach.
The scenery is gorgeous and one wonders how all these grown-ups have their summers free to have dinner and beach parties every night. It's a lovely setting for a group of people who are emotionally broken. Duncan is shy and awkward around people, especially girls but neighbor Susana (the lovely AnnaSophia Robb) takes an interest in him. Wacky Owen (Sam Rockwell) becomes his mentor and hires him to work at the Water Wizz theme park.  Owen is little more than a kid emotionally and it is hard to understand why he takes such an interest in Duncan. I can seem creepy but the attention is all innocent as Owen tries to break Duncan out of his shell. Add in the fantastic Maya Rudolph and Allison Janney and we have quite the cast.

Both AnnaSophia Robb and Liam James seem to have a bright acting career ahead of them. Both are a joy to watch on screen and along with the a great adult cast, THE WAY, WAY BACK becomes a movie worth watching.

Of course, secrets are unearthed. Trent is not the perfect man Pam needs. Carell treats his version of Trent tenderly. It's clear that Trent is emotionally broke and unable to cope with fatherhood or relationships but he is not a bad-hearted guy. Trent needs to grow up just as much as Duncan does.  The story does get predictable but there is just joy in this cast and the setting is so wonderful that THE WAY, WAY BACK is a pleasant movie to watch.",1399248000,4,1942,4.5085227272727275

5827867,5,B00DL47424,"A film about a brooding, depressed, self-esteem-challenged 14-year-old does not, on its face, sound appealing or entertaining.  Add to the mix an overbearing new boyfriend for the teen's divorced mom, a mom seemingly content to look the other way in her desperation not to be alone, and even more angst and misery seems eminent.  But director/writer/actors Nat Faxon and Jim Rash have waved a magic wand over their delightful film THE WAY, WAY BACK, as this charmer is a keeper.  It's tender, poignant, funny, and uplifting--with a twist of defiance in the end that can't help but make a viewer smile.  When said teen is dragged against his will to accompany his mom and boyfriend to a summer resort--a resort with a very special water park--the magic of THE WAY, WAY BACK begins weaving.

The cast is exceptional.  Steve Carell plays boyfriend Trent, a less than savory, pretentious, transparently fake rogue, with the wonderful Toni Collette as teen Duncan's mother, who finally realizes the proverbial line has been crossed.  Kudos to young Liam James as downtrodden Duncan; over the course of this film, Duncan takes an amazing, life-changing journey.  Yet the true scene stealer is brilliant Sam Rockwell as Owen, the ""developmentally challenged"" manager of Water Wizz, the local water park.  I'm used to seeing Rockwell in dark, often sinister roles, so here the actor throws a sensational change of pace; as Duncan's mentor and ardent supporter, Rockwell is funny, yet compelling and very strong.  Other cast members include Maya Rudolph as Owen's often-frustrated girlfriend, and Allison Janney as next-door neighbor Betty, who can't live life to its fullest enough.  Even Faxon and Rash have small, yet satisfying, roles playing employees of Water Wizz.  With spontaneous moments that will have you burst out laughing, or get angry at Trent's callousness, or find a lump in your throat, THE WAY, WAY BACK is a diamond in the rough.  Who knew teenage angst could be this entertaining?

5827870,4,B00DL47424,"A depressed kid, Duncan (Liam James), is dragged to the beach by his divorced mom (Toni Collette) and her boyfriend (Steve Carell).  Duncan seems to be in a perpetual, morose funk, apparently brought on by his mother's divorce and family predicament.  Right out of the gate, Carell seems hostile to the kid -- ""How would you rate yourself on a scale of 10?"" he asks on the drive down, with Duncan in a depressed, catatonic state, barely able to respond.  Allison Janney adds some jaded adult let's-live-it-up-and-have-a-blast shtick, and Duncan, trying to escape this, befriends Owen (Sam Rockwell), who runs a water slide amusement ride (""Water Wizz""). This brings the kid for a time out of his funk.  The brightest moments in the film are delivered by Owen, with some very funny lines, who inexplicably takes an interest in the kid.  The film lurches back and forth between family clashes and fun in the sun. Duncan's onscreen glumness is overdone, and tends to drag the film down.  The plot is contrived and predictable, but overall the movie is enjoyable.",1397865600,,1059,4.888268156424581

Despite this disappointment, I really liked the movie based on the strength of the story and the other characters. In the end, it was a feel good movie.",1397520000,,334,4.403225806451613
5827928,5,B00DL47424,"It seems like nowadays, most movies that come out are high budget films with lots of special effects.  This movie was a low budget movie, and could have even had a higher budget if the story took place in 1984 as the trivia in imdb says it was originally set to, but they switched it to today to save money.  Despite a low-budget movie showing places around a community, this movie is great.  The other day, I rented it on-demand despite having seen it earlier because despite all my choices, I wasn't sure if I'd be entertained by any of the movies, but was convinced I'd be entertained by this movie.  What makes it a good film, there is a lot of humor in the movie.  You'll laugh if you watch it.  But, what really makes it a good film, the characters in the movie are relatable, especially Duncan, a shy 14-year old.  His character is relatable, because I have been shy before and sometimes still am shy.  But, it shows how an isolated teen can find something he enjoys and is good at.  His character is also relatable in a scene where he goes on a boat with his family, and asks why he's the only one who has to wear a life jacket.  So, I'd give this movie 5 stars for being funny, and showing characters that relate to real life.",1397347200,,1235,4.261802575107296

Tale of boy who spends summer w/single mom wrapped up with new boyfriend (Steve Carell is excellent as the not so nice boyfriend), and his quest to be noticed by someone while mom tries to keep her relationship alive and not lose herself or her son in the process.

Excellent cast. Lots of humor but still not a superficial storyline which was nice. You'll be groaning & cheering for Duncan and even little Pete.",1394928000,,559,4.427184466019417
5828126,3,B00DL47424,"I thought that it was  a light sweet movie that is heartwarming. The acting was very good, but the plot was predictable. It's the kind of movie that is better thought of after you watch it, rather than during the experience of watching it. Steve Carrel was perfectly snide and unlikeable. Toni Collette was great.  She had the best developed adult character because she had the opportunity to communicate the process of facing her fears and wisdom and she did it with sensitivity and  believability.  Allison Jamey plays a terrific drunk and must have had a blast doing this part after her stoic West Wing performance.  The best actor in the film was the 14 year old character Duncan, played by Liam James.  His physical affectations, non verbal cues and expressions were engaging and allowed a 60 something like me to get inside the head of a 14 year old.  The most redeeming part of the movie is the opportunity for adults to watch it and observe what we look like in our worst moments from the eyes of teenagers.  For this reason alone, I recommend the movie as food for thought for  couples who are thinking about blending families.",1394928000,2,1136,4.64

5828130,4,B00DL47424,"Sweet Movie! Highly recommend. All actors on-point -- or as is typical for Steve Carrell - he crafted a completely tone-deaf character. If he said ""hey buddy"" one more time - I wanted to reach into my screen and wring-him.",1394668800,,222,4.575
5828131,5,B00DL47424,"Really, a movie where Steve Carell is never, not even once, remotely funny?  Sounds horrible, right?  Instead it's genius as the rest of the cast is able to deliver the laughs and smiles and everyone especially Liam James gives performances worthy of some kind of award.  What makes it so great?  It tells the classic coming of age story with the added new twists of post-modern yuppies and waterpark heroes.  Lots and lots of great one-liners but what impresses the most is the well written dialogue and the well-acted ""in between the lines"" stuff that classics are made of.  This young star Liam James shows more acting chops without saying a single word than you can find in however many seasons of Gilmore Girls they made.  This movie will make you laugh and make you cry (literally) but the rarity of it is that it makes you think.  A MUST SEE.",1394582400,,849,4.576158940397351

5828183,5,B00DL47424,terrific character and dialogue driven movie.  Filled with laughs from Sam Rockwell's terrific performance but also a heart-felt coming to age story of an adolescent trying to find himself.  Scripts like this are the one's that should be winning oscars....Faxon and Rash wrote one of the best scripts and the terrific acting of a star-studded cast brought their work to the screen....definitely going to be the most understated movie of the year,1394496000,,445,5.166666666666667

5828448,4,B00DL47424,"My wife compared this movie to the movie, Meatballs, and I can totally see that.  As a matter if fact, I believe others have said the same.  Very enjoyable movie about a lonely divorced mom, her disaffected teenaged son and their vacation with her new boyfriend played by Carrell who did a great job just playing a dick.  Toni Collette is awesome in everything she does and does a wonderful job her transforming from a needy, insecure person seeking compromise for love to realizing that unconditional love might has always been right in front of her.  Sam Rockwell steals every scene he's in and both the relationship and chemistry between him and the boy is worth watching the movie in itself.  This, too, was another nostalgic take on the formulative years of a teenage boy during a summer vacation trip and how experiences many grown up things for the first time.

Again, not terribly original but just a damn good movie,",1393027200,,925,4.714285714285714

There wasn't much comedy. It's definitely not Little Miss Sunshine. Characters weren't defined very well. The plot points were over dramatic, to serious, and sometimes to subtle.",1392595200,,343,4.830508474576271
5828586,4,B00DL47424,"The preview for this movie initially turned me off. It panders to broad social appeal by harping on a scene where a waterslide attendant uses his limited authority to stare at a girls butt in a bikini for an extended amount of time, striking me as a simple teen flick that objectifies women.
But, after a podcast I respect recommended it, I gave it a whirl and I was pleasantly surprised. It was wonderful, smart, and funny.
The movie deals with the dynamics of divorce, self-esteem, and friendship.
A young, shy teen is dragged by his mothers jerk of a boyfriend to his beach house for the summer, a situation that he doesnt necessarily want to be a part of. And as a result the hermit-like kid crawls out of his shell in an attempt to escape an unwanted father figure (his mothers boyfriend) and ends up at a nearby water park where he ultimately finds a true father figure.
Theres a lot of really great performances as well, Steve Carrel lends none of his typical tenderness to his portrayal of the boyfriend; Toni Collette (as the mother) really embodies the passive personality that she has passed down to her son; Allison Janney is wonderful as a party-happy, overbearing, but sweet neighbor, and co-director Jim Rashs performance as a grumpy, lost-and-found attendant at the water park is pretty delightful.
Its a great movie to watch on a cold night when you need to warm up your mood.",1392595200,2,1393,4.6437246963562755

5828699,3,B00DL47424,"The Way, Way Back has its charms and provided a few, good belly laughs. For me, it was a victim of its own hype. After hearing all about this indie-darling's successes, I expected more. All in all, it's a fine movie and well worth a watch. The performances are good enough. The story is okay. It suffers from having too many characters and (for a movie quite grounded in reality) more than a few questionably believable scenarios.
Personally, I've always had a hard time watching people of some privilege struggle with trite problems. The Faxon-Rash team's most recent efforts have taken viewers from the beaches of Hawaii, to the beaches of the Hamptons. The vast majority of America lay in between, and not on a beach.

This movie owes a great debt to the earlier film, but it also tells its own story and makes its own impact. Oh, how I loved this movie. The casting was fantastic. Nobody does slightly-bewildered mom like Toni Collette; the kid was perfect; and Sam Rockwell is amazing as the nice slacker who takes the kid under his wing. (If you don't think Rockwell is a good actor, see also ""Moon,"" in which he was incredible.)

5828802,5,B00DL47424,"I passed by this movie several times when looking for movies to rent, and I never really paid attention to it until I noticed who starred in it.  I love both Steve Carell and Toni Collette, so that made the decision for me.

The character of Duncan, played by Liam James, shows such a transformation over the course of this movie.  He starts off as a quiet, socially awkward teenager who learns how to stand up for himself and let his personality show, thanks to guidance of Owen (played by Sam Rockwell).

This movie shows the not always pleasant adjustment that kids of divorced parents go through when their mom or dad begins to date.  I love Steve Carell but his character is fairly unlikeable in this film.  I think the only thing that saved his character in my mind was knowing that he's a nice guy in real life.  He's the mom's boyfriend that any teenage boy would absolutely hate.

This film was filled with great actors who give a lot of depth to this story.  Everyone wants to belong, and the viewer ends up being the biggest cheerleader for numerous characters who all want that for themselves.",1391040000,,1105,4.5125628140703515

5828910,4,B00DL47424,"The Way Way back has a lot of things to Like. A great directing duo, Nat Faxon and Jim Rashhelm, and a great ensemble, in a charming but not too sentimental coming of age drama with a lot of comedy and a lot of heart. The protagonist is the teenage,socially awkward Duncan, played charmingly by the young Liam James. He really leads the cast of sometimes much older and more experienced actors.
Duncan's mother (the awesome Toni Collete) is a divorced, probably lonely,woman dating an overbearing car salesman Trent, played effectively by Steve Carell. He and Duncan have not hit it off, Trent wants the respect an admiration he feels is a father's due, and wants it overnight. Allison Janny makes a brilliant comedic turn as the drunken, overly critical, single mom Betty in the summer house next door.
Duncan's most admirable trait is his ability to put himself out there, sometimes with a push from all the new friends he is making He secretly lands a job at the local water park under tutelage of teenager in a man's body, Owen. Duncan blossoms and also falls for an older girl, the daughter of Betty. This film is satisfying and poignant, treating drama and teenage angst with a refreshingly light touch and is definitely worth the rental.",1390348800,,1244,4.7373271889400925
5828911,5,B00DL47424,"This movie teleports you back to your awkward years...  in a great way.  This is the story of a kid named Duncan, who is stuck in a place he doesn't want to be, in a situation in which he doesn't want to be - at the cottage of his mom's new boyfriend, a person with whom he doesn't want to be played wonderfully by Steve Carell in a role that will actually make you not like him.

Duncan meets some offbeat, wonderful people - and the beautiful girl next door - who help him come out of his shell and grow from doormat to dynamo.

While there is drinking in this movie, I think high school kids can overlook that in order to see the bigger picture. This movie looks at social skills and blended families and how it all works and sometimes doesn't work. If you think it is too racy for school, at least it is entertaining for educators to watch as they can learn ways to deal with the socially challenged child.

5828996,3,B00DL47424,"When I first saw Steve Carell in this film, I was like ""Yay, this is really good."" and I thought he is going to really turn up the acting spark but later I realised his role is a negative one and he is so convincing as a bad guy that I absolutely hated him. It doesn't normally happen but this ruined the very spirit of the film for me. You see, The Way Way Back is a film about a single mother who has a boyfriend and a shy kid named Duncan. Duncan is so shy and awkward but under his demeanour there lies a true worthy grit of someone who knows right from wrong. There were scenes involving him smiling and laughing which were easily among the best scenes in the film so he is that likeable.

What didn't work for me in the film was Sam Rockwell. From the moment he entered the film you seem to know what he is going to try and do, then a few scenes more and you are convinced you know everything about this man trying to bring a semblance of clarity and pleasantville to the little kid, Duncan. It just all didn't add up well for me. Sam's character was unlikable and I thought Steve Carrel was a gamble that didn't pay off.

I did like Duncan's mother and Duncan, the little relationship they shared where Duncan would just hang around the make shift house not willing to come home because he couldn't be bothered.

Conclusion - This is a film about growing up and rising out of the odds. But trust me, dear reader, I have like you, seen 1033 films on this topic and I dare say this one did nothing for me.

For those looking for more involved intrinsic cinema I would recommend ""Win Win"" , ""World's Greatest  Dad"" , ""Art of Getting By"" , ""Submarine"" and maybe even ""The Squid and the whale.""

Worth watching but nowhere did this offer me something I was looking for. I wish the film had a better storyline, better paved characters and more charm overall. It just felt like a second best effort.",1390089600,,1899,4.232044198895028

5829038,5,B00DL47424,"Aside from a ""they wanted Greg Kinnear and settled for Steve Carrell"" miscasting, this was a perfect movie.  It's a wonderful update of the ""yay the scrappy underdog triumphs"" archetype of classic 80s movies of yore.  This one was made particularly great by the performances of aforementioned scrappy underdog Liam James, his defacto mentor Sam Rockwell and Allison Janney playing against type as the boozey cruisey neighbrah with the heart of gold.  Those performances and the wonderful personality of Duncan the protagonist and the eventual denouement leads me to say without reservation: seriously, WATCH THIS MOVIE!!",1389916800,,620,5.4375
5829039,5,B00DL47424,"I couldn't even tell you when this was released. The release was so small it was like a summer drizzle that lasts two seconds at a pool and the poor schlubs leave first. Steve Carell is marvelous as a hedonistic heel in a strangely 80's mode. And Sam Rockwell is the non-creepy under-achiever every young man struggling to negotiate his identity in a troubled family should have as a summer mentor. I put this up there with ""Adventureland"" and ""Dan in Real Life"" as good-hearted flicks with major league casts that are forgotten too quickly for all the wrong reasons; yes, if you ever, follow my reviews -- I doubt anyone does -- I will concede I bother to review only films/books I genuinely like, unless they annoyed in some special way. This is, to a great degree, a setting film, with a water-park at its heart. This is almost like taking a sub-plot from one of those very average-to-sub-par 80s films, such as ""The Great Outdoors"" and blowing up one portion in a serious, thoroughgoing way that has genuine character development.",1389916800,,1034,4.686813186813187

As you may have read elsewhere, sure, it's a combination of ""Caddyshack,"" ""Meatballs,"" ""A Boy's Life,"" and other films, but it has its own voice and atmosphere.

All the actors did a terrific job in this movie, all oscar worthy. I saw this movie at the theatre with my husband, but rented it through Amazon for my sons to watch. Entertaining through out, I enjoyed Toni Colette's role as well as Steve Carell. The movie is about a family driving to the summer home of the boyfriend (Steve Carell) with his daughter, his girlfriend (Toni Colette) and her son. I highly recommend the movie to anyone who wants to watch a feel good movie. Sam Rockwell should win an oscar for his role and the movie should get a nomination for best movie of the year.",1389312000,,734,4.287769784172662

5829274,4,B00DL47424,"I didn't like Steve Carrell in a movie for the very first time, and that is a good thing here.  He plays an overbearing, arrogant, philandering schmuck incredibly well.  The protagonist in the movie was awesome - looking forward to seeing him in future movies.  My only complaint would have to be the character played by Sam Rockwell.  He was way over the top most of the time, and needlessly so.  I did really enjoy his relationship with the kid, though.  The ending scene with him is awesome.  Good movie.",1389225600,,507,4.566666666666666

Every character is developed just perfectly so you quickly get hooked on their charming, sweet, rude or outlandish behavior. And it's got a happy ending. I'd recommend this to anyone!",1389225600,,350,4.833333333333333

I would have never heard about this movie if it hadn't been for a brother who read an obscure article about it.  Fortunately, one theater in our region ran it for a few weeks.  Apparently, the word was getting around and the theater was almost full.  By the loud laughter throughout the showing the audience loved the movie as much as I did.  Some great performances by the actors making the most of a great script.
This is a coming of age movie I would recommend for an audience of 12+.  I bought the BluRay when it came out, however I did not see any significant difference between it and the DVD version which I had screened more than twice before the BluRay was available.",1389225600,,761,4.4

5829311,4,B00DL47424,This a very touching and hilarious coming of age story.  Sam Rockwell makes the movie so much more entertaining.

5829314,4,B00DL47424,Wonderful coming of age story.  Sam Rockwell had me laughing throughout the film. Steve Carrel was great as the sleaze bag.,1389139200,,123,4.857142857142857

5829351,3,B00DL47424,Not bad not great.  The movie never really took off for me.  It had some fun scenes and was almost able to pull me into the characters.  The acting was fine but I was left longing for more substance from the story.,1389139200,,214,4.0476190476190474
5829352,4,B00DL47424,NOT as good as Little Miss Sunshine - which is a hard act to follow. But the same genre and nice family viewing experience for the Holidays.,1389052800,,140,4.222222222222222

5829354,3,B00DL47424,A bit slow but overall a good movie.  Odd to see Steve Carrell as the bad guy.  The main boy actor in the film was a convincing teen finding his way.,1389052800,,149,3.774193548387097
5829355,5,B00DL47424,I had never heard of this movie before seeing it on here. What a great story and wonderful cast to carry it out. I think most of us have either known someone like Duncan or been him...whether we are male or female. I think every teen in that position needs and Owen in their life....Great movie. A must see..,1388966400,,308,4.237288135593221
5829356,5,B00DL47424,"I hadn't heard of this film, but it proved to be a nice little comedic surprise, with depth. Liam Jones plays a 14-year old Duncan, dragged along to a summer beach house with his mom (Toni Collette)  and his mom's boyfriend Trent (Steve Carell). Trent demeans Duncan, and it's soon clear that his nice guy demeanor is an act (although he doesn't have the self-awareness to see that for himself.) The neighborhood is (as a teen girl Duncan befriends puts it) ""spring break for adults"", with everyone behaving badly. Allison Janney is fabulous as a recently divorced, big-drinking neighbor mom with an outsized personality. The rest of the supporting cast is excellent too.

But it's Sam Rockwell who is arguably the star of this movie. The laid-back, wise-cracking owner of an old water park takes Duncan under his wing, providing him a place to work and much more. At the water park Duncan grows into himself, and discovers the strength to defy Trent and encourage his mom to do so too. It's a sweet coming of age movie with many laugh-out-loud moments. Highly recommend!",1388966400,,1071,4.815217391304348
5829357,5,B00DL47424,"The Mrs. and I watched this piece because of the actors that are in the piece. Then, the grandsons came over for a movie afternoon and we decided to re-watch the movie with the 15 year old there and boy was that worthwhile. It is more than apparent that parents today are way too busy with their own trials and tribulations to understand what their teenage kids are going to face in many of a teenager's life situations (parents divorce, new potential parent in the mix, blended families, first job, mentoring, first kiss, betrayal and forgiveness).

That is a lot to have on the plate for one story but this piece does it almost flawlessly. The acting may be a little cliche-like but it works out later on.

Most importantly, the teenage grandson kept ""Ohh'ing"" and ""Ahh'ing"" when the various situations arose for the movie's protagonist teenage character. This turned out to be a conversation starter and a realization on the part of our teenager that these situations are not that far fetched and do happen to a lot of kids.

Well worth it! Oh, and have fresh popped popcorn to go around while it plays.",1388966400,4,1106,4.63265306122449

5829402,1,B00DL47424,This movie has nothing positive to recommend.  The theme is trite and acting uninspired.  Steve Carell's name is probably the draw but he can't afford too many more like this and keep his status as a star whose name will produce a popular movie.  Boring and three generations were watching so it's not just an age bias reporting here.,1388966400,4,334,4.627118644067797

I thought I would see his normal Office ""Michael Scott"" like character but he was completely opposite. By the end of the movie you really hate him, and that is good acting when someone makes you hate them even though you love there acting.

It is a strong story with a lot of heart, I was entertained the entire time and was sad to see the movie end, I wanted more.

Overall it is a very good movie that anyone who likes the Little Miss Sunshine type humor will love. Watch it, trust me you will like it.",1388880000,,646,4.119047619047619

It sort of remind me of life in northern Michigan in the 70's, where neighbors living on lake in the summer party openly in front of their children.  That's so real it's kind of funny.

One of the things I appreciate about this film is that it doesn't shy away from awkward or painful moments. It feels real; either you have experienced being in these situations, you've seen them happen, or you know someone who did. Sam Rockwell is probably my favorite, but the whole cast is fantastic.

His mom (Toni Collette) is dating Trent (Steve Carell) who is overly pretentious and made unlikeable. Trent has a teen daughter Steph (Zoe Levin) who is self centered. Duncan lives in a shell, but has taken a shine to Owen (Sam Rockwell) an out going adult who works at the local water slide where the modern family is summer vacationing.

Owen befriends Duncan and instills confidence in him. Duncan makes friends with the cutie and moody neighbor teen (AnnaSophia Robb) who sees her mother as irresponsible just as Duncan sees Trent and his mom. We see the world through the eyes of a teen as if once wasn't enough.

The film is a heart warming comedy. It touches on a number of family themes, but never drives home a point, or perhaps allows the audience to gather whatever meaning they desire. Worth seeing.

5829974,5,B00DL47424,"If you were expecting The Way Way Back to be a typical Hollywood comedy, complete with crass jokes, a thin story, and stereotypical hot female characters, prepare to think again. But neither is The Way Way Back an overtly-dramatic, sentimental, and cheesy drama piece that leaves you gagging in treacle. Directors Nat Faxon and Jim Rash have constructed a breezy and well-acted film with the perfect mix of killer humour and moving drama. Unlike most other comedies out there, The Way Way Back puts a strong emphasis on it's characters (who are brought to life by a colorful cast), meaning that the film stays relatable and at times, surprisingly poignant.

Speaking of cast, can we give a shout out to relative newcomer&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Liam-James/dp/B00BMKG54C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Liam James</a>? His performance as 14-year-old social outcast Duncan is so awkward you feel pity just looking at him. Unlike most teen stars who've played a loser onscreen, James *legitimately* seems a loser who finds confidence and becomes cool, rather than a cool guy who hides his coolness in loser persona to shed it later on. This guy is a talent to hopefully watch out for.

The big draw of the movie, however, is probably&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steve-Carell/dp/B008LXZFH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steve Carell</a>, who completely sheds his lovable idiot persona playing an absolutely detestable, controlling, dominating stepdad for our hero. Trust me, you're going to hate him by the time the credits roll (but that doesn't mean you don't empathize with him, and that's the power of Carell's performance). However, the biggest scene-stealer in a movie full of scene-stealer's is going to be&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sam-Rockwell/dp/B0030B621W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sam Rockwell</a>, who - in addition of making every movie he is in approximately 47.02% better, and being extremely charismatic - provides all the films biggest laughs.

The female supporting cast - Toni Collette, Allison Janney, Maya Rudolph, and *especially* AnnaSophia Robb - are all excellent, hilarious, and interesting in their colorful roles. I was especially impressed in the way that Duncan and Robb's Susanna's relationship remained fresh and touching without ever resorting to cliches or cheesy sentimentality.

In fact, The Way Way Back rejects unearned sentiment in favour of honestly-won emotion, and lots and lots of laughs. Now keep in mind that I don't watch a lot of comedies, but The Way Way Back is the funniest film I've see all year (in particular a moment of rich humor comes courtesy of co-director and actor Nat Faxon, Sam Rockwell, some kids stuck in a water slide, and a large black man). Hilarious and filled with humor, but never cheesy or sentimental, The Way Way Back is certainly not original - you've seen all of these elements before. But it's made with such love and style, and acted so excellently, and remains relatable through it all that it's almost impossible not to love! 4.5 water wizzes out of 5!

5830034,5,B00DL47424,"I think this was my favorite movie from summer 2013. We saw this one Sunday morning on a whim. I really enjoyed it. The story revolves around a young teenager, Duncan, on his family vacation with his mother and her boyfriend and well as the boyfriend's daughter. His relationship with his mom's boyfriend is less than stellar with Trent (the boyfriend) calling him a 3 on a scale of 1-10. The mother is a total wreck of a midlife crisis who can't handle her divorce and is clinging to her awful boyfriend like a life raft in the storm. Duncan at first makes no friends on his trip and eventually strikes out on his own with a bicycle he found in the garage. He starts to hang around at a local waterpark that is full of that small town amusement park charm. The place has it's own way of operating, it's own crazy cast of characters, and it's own folklore. Duncan is eventually offered a job by the owner of the waterpark and he spends the rest of his summer vacation finding acceptance amongst his coworkers. This movie made me feel nostalgic for the summers of my youth. It made me miss the years when summer meant months at the pool. Even though this movie had some truly funny moments it was a bit heavier on the coming of age stuff that Duncan dealt with. Learning how to stand up for himself and how to accept himself.

Mom, played by Toni Collette, is a meek woman, devastated by a divorce and allows her new boyfriend, played by Steve Carrell, to walk all over her, and her son, Duncan.

They arrive at the summer house of the boyfriend, and Duncan knows what he is up against in the snarky, mean boyfriend. He has rated Duncan a 3 out of 10, and expects Duncan to move up. Duncan, trying to avoid the boyfriend, rides off everyday on an old used bicycle, to the sumner water sports arena. He is befriended by Owen, a 30 something guy pretending he visit a teenager. Owen gives Duncan a job, and his life improves at work. At home, mom is still meek and mild, suspecting her boyfriend is cheating, but too afraid to say anything.

The next door boozed up lady, played by Alison Janney has a daughter who Duncan likes and they strike up a friendship. The summer moves on until trouble erupts between boyfriend and mom. Things left unsaid and emotions come to the fore, Boyfriend, Trent, is one of those men with no redeeming qualities, picking on others to make himself look good. Duncan, learns to be a man and comes out of his shell. A long miserable summer has turned into lessons on living.

5830175,3,B00DL47424,"Quirky indie comedies are a dime a dozen these days, and their popularity has soared since films like Juno and Little Miss Sunshine took Oscar by storm.  Now it feels like every year there is that one film that is trying to be Juno.  Earlier this year, we got a small film called The Way Way Back that many were toting as the next big indie Oscar breakthrough, but the trailer gave me heed.  It just looked too light for Oscar.  Reviews confirmed that speculation.

But not every movie needs to be an Oscar movie.

The Way Way Back suffers from one major issue; it feels like two movies.  There is the darkly enlightening portrait of Duncans home life (vacation life) with his mother and her creepy boyfriend, and then there is a very tonally different film, that of a young boy coming into his own skin as he starts working at a water park.  I wish that the two halves met better in the middle, but when they attempt to (like in that awkward finale) things get even worse.  Separate, they work to varying degrees, but ultimately the first film is far better than the second and quite honestly you can feel the quality of the film drop every time Duncan goes to the water park, despite the fact that Sam Rockwell is the best thing about the film.

He just doesnt fit.

The film tells the story of a young 14-year-old boy whose father abandoned him and his mother for a younger woman.  Now he is stuck in summer vacation with his mother and her new boyfriend and his daughter.  The new boyfriend, Trent, doesnt even try to hide his douchbaggery, and yet Duncans mother seems to ignore it for her own illusion of happiness.  While wasting away at Trents beach house, Duncan strikes up a small romance with the neighbor girl and begins to work at a water park when he befriends a childish man named Owen who, well, refuses to care about much of anything.

There is a lot of potential here and yet none of it truly comes together like it should have.  It is an enjoyable film that lacks the connective tissue to make it a good film.  The ensemble is spectacular though, with each performer really nailing their respective character.  I just wish that the film felt more cohesive, and I wish that ridiculous final scene with the tubes was omitted entirely.  The Way Way Back has a sweet spot, and there is a tenderness and an honesty that permeates much of the darker aspects of the film (the blowout over Trents indiscretions feels so rich poignancy, especially when you couple it with Pams immediate reaction), but this is a prime example of a filmmaker (or filmmakers) who didn't quite know how to express all their ideas at once.

And was I the only one who was confused about the decade this took place?  Like, I swore this was the 70s or something like that until they hit the water park and kids started krumping.

Anyways, I cant say I don't recommend it because it has its perks, but overall this is an uneven venture that missed a lot of key opportunities to be something better than it is.",1385942400,,2995,4.446886446886447

5830255,4,B00DL47424,"This is a pretty decent movie.  It's a gentle coming of age story, not a wild and crazy teen summer flick.  And really it's not even so much a coming of age story as it is a character study.  The humor comes from clever dialog much like Juno although not quite as rapid fire as that movie.  I didn't find it original or particularly memorable but I did get emotionally involved with the story.  Duncan was an interesting protagonist who doesn't say much but has a subtle teenage scowl that feels pretty authentic.  In one scene his scowl subtlety shifts through a range of emotions.  I really liked Liam Jones's performance.  All the actors give great understated performances.

The story really is predictable in a way, Duncan is drawn to Sam Rockwell's character and Rockwell is drawn to Duncan.  Why the aging cool guy picks out Duncan is one of those movie tropes that defies reason and is just there to get the two together.  Rockwell's character is the stereotypical charming rogue and he's great as usual but sometimes the wackiness feels forced.  While the plot is predictable the actions of the characters is satisfying.  The ending is the typical heartwarming closing but it didn't feel heavy handed.  The movie pretty much ends the way it began, small and sweet.",1385337600,,1273,4.7272727272727275

5830363,5,B00DL47424,"If you like indie-style off beat, clever films, you will love this one, which has some elements as well as actors from Little Miss Sunshine and Napoleon Dynamite.

I've read that this is a ""coming of age"" movie, but have to disagree. The teen boy (Duncan) starts and ends the movie very much a child and is lucky in this film to get a first kiss; he leaves with his innocence quite in tact. What this move is about are those key, critical people in our lives that enable a person to pivot from a bad place to a much better place. And, in stark contrast, those key relationships that can chip away at ones confidence and make the world a quite miserable place. The latter person in Duncan's life is Trent played by Steve Carrel, in one of his finest acting roles. He is Duncan's mother's boyfriend and without for the most part laying a hand on Duncan is a mean SOB with each interaction with the boy worse than the last. Owen is the man who enables Duncan to pivot from this dark existence into a much brighter place. I love in this movie the transformation of Duncan as he comes into his own. I also like that the film doesn't provide any easy, magic solutions to complicated problems.

A second theme is how middle aged parents see that last gasp of vitality and beauty in their own lives and want to grasp it and take full advantage, ditching their responsibility to parent youths who probably need them more than ever. Toni Collette (Pam) is brilliant, once again reviving her ""mom to awkward teen boy"" role and is a great multidimensional character here in her struggle with conflicting loyalties to Duncan and Trent.

For the people who found it slow-moving, they just didn't have enough ""stick-to-it-iveness,"" I guess.  Duncan is everything:  dorky, funny, smart, bordering on cool, and basically, just trying to find his way during the ""awkward years.""  I hope as an actor he gets a chance to develop his burgeoning talent because it's definitely there.  While Owen may not be the best role model for Duncan, he is certainly a great mentor.  He teaches Duncan more in a summer cut short than he could have ever learned from having a full-time father.  Steve Carell plays a great creep; you just want to smack him!  It does take Duncan's mom a while to come around, but as a single mother, you can't help but understand some of her actions and decisions.  Allison Janney is very ""rough around the edges"" but so quick witted and funny, you have to be very jaded not to laugh.

Few nice scenes and an ok portrayal of a general teenage life with single parents but you won't find much meaning in the movie other than the shallow, daily summer grind with a bit of flerting and obligatory stereotyping of depressed female mom, shy boy, jerky mom'd bf etc.  Really wasn't funny, sad rather.

5830488,5,B00DL47424,I think (for me) what makes this movie so great is that it's relatable. The movie is funny and quirky yet serious. I like how the humor steers the movie away from being depressing. So you'll still laugh but you'll also be moved by certain heartfelt moments. You'll also find yourself rooting for the main character...and despising Carrell's character. The actors all did a splendid job here. Watch it. You'll love it.,1384041600,,417,4.805555555555555
5830509,5,B00DL47424,"How do you get a bunch of A and near A-list actors to star in a small-budget film such as ""The Way Way Back""?  Well, you offer them a summer vacation in the Hamptons, or at least a location that looks a lot like the Hamptons.  That might do.

But then again, maybe a better way would be to write a way, way good screenplay, and then throw that screenplay to your actor candidates. or at least their agents.  After they nearly pass on the project because of the low salaries, they might read it and then nearly beg to take a pay cut to just be part of it all.

Well, I'm assuming that this is kind of how it went with really top-notch acting talent such as Toni Collette and Sam Rockwell, but I'm just guessing.  But I'm not guessing that this film was made for a mere five million dollars, which is an unbelievable steal nowadays.  Heck, you could barely cover just the cost of their summer rental for that.  Even in a place that just looks like it's in the Hamptons.

I can't say that I liked this film as much as ""Little Miss Sunshine"" or even ""The Descendants,"" but it is really close.  The writing was terrific in all three, the directing was terrific in all three, and the acting was terrific in all three.  What else could you ask for really?

It seems that the theme of this film is ""Settling.""  The workers at the water park have settled for their ""measly"" jobs for longer than they'd care to discuss.  The water park itself has even settled for a manager that might be out of his mind -- a really funny Sam Rockwell that sure tries to steal the show.  The mother settles for a boyfriend who might have a few skeletons in his closet (I won't say what those skeletons are as that might be a spoiler).  But I guess the title ""The Way Way Back"" has something to do with the very back seats in station wagons.  I had never heard the phrase until today, outside of perhaps in baseball.  Perhaps it is a metaphor for being able to get away from your problems?  Or maybe even take control of them when you decide to by going to your happy place?  And our protagonist finds out that sometimes, while it might be best to be alone, it might be best to be alone together.

I just watched a film called ""Lincoln"" this week, which was beyond a snooze-fest.  Many critics have complained about that film's historical inaccuracies that were completely unnecessary as well, but I'm not a history buff so I can't say.  And that film was made for $65 million, which is 13 times the cost of this little gem.  Which producer do you think got the better deal?  While I may not be a history buff, my math skills aren't too bad.

I say, ""Why settle for a lousy, overblown film such as Lincoln?"" at 65 mil when you can sit back and truly enjoy yourself for a mere 5?  Take control, and don't be willing to settle for anything less.",1384041600,,2815,4.252354048964219

I'm not a Steve Carell fan but his role in this movie was more supporting role than the all eyes on him all the time lead roles we often see him in.  There were some great one-liners I'll be sure to use in the future and Sam Rockwell is always great.  You'll end this moving loving Sam and hating Steve, if you didn't already!

5830518,3,B00DL47424,"In the first five minutes of this movie, Trent (Steve Carell), the boyfriend of Pam (Toni Collette), tells Pam's only son, Duncan (Liam James), that he thinks -- on a scale of one to ten -- Duncan is a three. He bases this on the fact that Duncan never goes anywhere or tries to make friends or pretty much does anything except mope around his mom's apartment. Duncan doesn't ""put himself out there."" The three of them (plus Trent's spoiled daughter) are headed up to Trent's beach house for the summer, and Trent hopes that this experience will help Duncan ""get that score up.""

Now, look. It's a horrible thing to tell a kid he's a three on a scale of one to ten. It's not bound to be inspiring, like Trent seems to think it is. It's a douchey move, and the movie obviously intends for this to immediately characterize Trent as a douche supreme.

But the problem is that Trent, it turns out, is 100% correct.

For the first thirty minutes of the film, Duncan mopes around sullenly like a stereotypically bitter teenager, barely talking, enduring everything with insufferable silence, and basically wearing his self-pity on his sleeve. The only thing that makes him a likable character is that he's constantly juxtaposed against Trent's relentless douchey-ness. Douche-osity. Douche-itude. Whatever. The point being: Duncan doesn't do anything to make you root for him other than be quietly put-upon, and his complete passivity -- while understandable -- doesn't really earn him a whole lot of points, especially since he's surrounded by a cast of characters with so much more depth and energy to their personalities, including an alcoholic neighbor, her cross-eyed child, and even her curiously cranky daughter, a girl who takes sullen silence and actually makes it interesting by covering it with a poetically repressed rage.

Then, while wandering the area, looking for ironic places to be depressed, Duncan stumbles upon a water park with the unlikely name of Water Wizz. While practicing his silent moping at the park, he is inexplicably befriended by the charismatic manager of the park, a ne'er-do-well named Owen (Sam Rockwell). As Duncan learns to put himself out there and do things outside of the house, his score goes up. Ta da!

There is a lot to like about this movie. Toni Collette -- while underutilized -- is amazing as usual. Rockwell is also a win, although he seems to be channeling Bill Murray in the role. Some of the antics at the water park, especially the bits involving&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Community-s/dp/B002N5N5LG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Community's</a>&nbsp;Jim Rash, are winners. Even Amanda Peet and Rob Corddry as Trent's friends are pretty good (although, again, not allowed to live up to their potential). The stuff surrounding Duncan isn't half bad, and is worth a watch.

The problem is that the backdrop of the film is so colorful and engaging that it makes Duncan and his issues look even duller and more predictable than they already are, like a paint-by-numbers exercise book that only uses black, white, and gray. I'm not entirely sure if it is the way the character is written or acted (or a bit of both), but Duncan sucks the life out of the script, even when he's supposed to be finally finding a spine and learning to love life. It just feels fake.

The best example of this comes in a scene about break dancing. MILD SPOILERS AHEAD!!! Duncan, working at the water park, is told to stop some breakdancers who have set up a sheet of cardboard and are doing spins and ollies and whatever they're called. Duncan goes up, turns off the music and begins to remove the cardboard, and -- of course -- everyone boos. Then, bizarrely, one of the breakdancers tells Duncan that he can take the cardboard if he first does some breakdancing himself. At this moment, contrary to anything we've seen in the character so far and propelled by nothing that makes sense, Duncan does some of the worst and most awkward dance moves I've ever seen. And EVERYONE CHEERS. That's right. This group of crunking teens cheers him, shows him some moves, and even helps him spin on his head and ""stick it."" Then they clap as Duncan removes the cardboard and ends their dancing party. I mean, is it just me, or are these the most ridiculously friendly break dancers outside of Sesame Street? I kept expecting them to mock him, or even demand that he leave the cardboard and boom box, but nope. After he does dance moves that would get him mocked off of a Barney video, they applaud and cheer and let him take their fun away. END OF MILD SPOILERS!!!

This scene was where I felt a huge part of myself disengage with the film. ""Is this meant to be a farce?"" I wondered, but nope, because the stuff with his mom and her jerk boyfriend is aggressively sincere. I realized, at the end of this scene, that the movie meant for this to be the first catalyst of Duncan ""coming of age.""

I didn't buy it. And even when I tried to buy it, all I kept thinking was, ""Trent was right."" Duncan is a boring, gloomy kid -- a three all around -- and it is only when he puts himself out there and tries to do something with himself that he comes out of his shell. I doubt the movie meant for our resident villain to also be the film's moral mouthpiece, and so the flick comes across as disingenuous and cheap when it should be its deepest and most meaningful.

Genuinely enjoyable when it's being funny and silly, but boringly insincere when it's trying to be dramatic, this film only half-worked for me.",1383868800,5,5559,4.769230769230769

The POV of the kid is really damning to parenthood, especially his mom who is seen as a lost, scared lemming, unable to really be a good, strong parent.  She's spineless.

It's not about fitting in but about finding where you fit in in the world at a time when you begin to question other people's motives. Not a pat teen comedy by any means.

The actors are so true to life. Carrell is terrific in a serious role and Toni Collette, the main character Duncan's mom, shows a broad range of emotions while she too is trying to figure out how she fits into the world in her new role as a dating single mother.

I learned that Sam Rockwell, who rarely if ever gets to play a lead role, is absolutely good enough to win an Academy Award,  3.  I learned who Liam James is, he did play the lead role of a 14 year old boy,

This movie is told from the viewpoint of 14 year old Duncan who is taken on a family vacation for the summer with his mom's (""Pam""-Toni Collette) jerk of a boyfriend (""Trent""-Steve Carrell) and his daughter, who could not be more glum.  On the car ride to the summer house, Trent tells Duncan that on a scale of 1 to 10, he thinks Duncan is a 3.  That gives you an idea what kind of summer Duncan is in for, at least until he meets Sam Rockwell's ""Owen"" who is HILARIOUS and works at the local water park!  Whoever wrote the dialogue for Owen also deserves an Academy Award (I can't believe I am saying things like this!!!).  Duncan gets a job at the water park which changes his view of life over the course of the summer...for the better, thank goodness.  The cast is amazing with Allison Janney, Maya Rudolph, AnnaSophia Robb, Amanda Peet and more.  I wasn't expecting this movie to be THIS GOOD.  What a FUN surprise!

I have to adore the kid riding in the back, back seat in the station wagon.  I well remember that third row facing backward.  The occupant was either the family rebel or the outsider.  In this movie it is the son who is addressed by his mom's boyfriend as to his rating in the world.

There are a lot of sweet moments between two of the blended variety.  And there are some witty, sly minutes at the water park where he retires to come out of his shell.  Toni Collette does a star turn as the anxious mother desperately trying to save a romance while her boyfriend becomes more and more overbearing with her son.  One can see the warring emotions chase through her features, and it is a wonderful piece of acting.

That alone could have resulted in yet another film where precociously wise kids have to raise the childish parents, this is not that film.  The kids seem like kids, the adults, well they're not entirely grown up yet and live to party.  Finally though, through a job at a water park (where all sorts of retrograde behavior is depicted as quite the norm and acceptable)  Duncan finds a niche for himself and begins to climb out of his shell.

I think the worst part of the film, for me, was that Steve Carell seemed so laid back and in the woodwork, while every time Owen (Steve Rockwell) was on the screen I couldn't help but think of Zaphod Beeblebrox.

5830822,2,B00DL47424,"*SOME SPOILERS*

Based on reviews and cast I was excited to see this movie. Unfortunately for me it was very disappointing. It is a likable movie and I can see why it would get great reviews. It is a typical coming of age summer story that is easy to watch, but it never really gets much past the level of an average after school special. There are dozens of similar themed better movies. One example is Little Miss Sunshine which has many of the same actors and production team (not the same writer) but is a far deeper and superior movie.  The problem I had was with the writing. The characters are all shallow, cliche, stereotypical, caricatures and the entire movie is surface-level and highly predictable.

The main character is also very hard to root for. They basically make him painfully silent throughout most of the movie and his big ""change"" or revelation is very underdeveloped. SPOILER**- His big scene is going back to the water park and passing his ""mentor"" inside a water slide. Supposed to be a big moment but you feel nothing. Another very obvious scene was Steve Carrel cheating. He says he was on his friends boat then very predictably a few scenes later his friend blabs to everyone that his boat has been in the shop for a week. It's lazy writing and you could see it coming from a mile away.

I am sure some people disagree with me, there is nothing really wrong with the movie overall and it is an easy safe watch but if you are into true coming of age type stories with real depth check out Little Miss Sunshine, Squid and the Whale, Juno, Dazed and Confused, etc/

That's my 2 cents",1382659200,7,1608,4.474402730375426

I also agree.  The theme is the same.  But really, how many plot lines are out there?  Everything is a variation on a theme.  Titanic is nothing more than Romeo and Juliet on a sinking boat.

The title:  The Way, Way Back is the term used for the very back seat of the station wagon driven as the movie opens.  Hence, the entire movie is set up in the opening sequence.

Kids of any age or time period need to understand they have worth.  And sometimes it takes an outsider to point it out.  Bill did it in Meatballs, Sam does it here. Within the year another movie will do it again.  It's an important concept.  Kids are influenced by movies.  I love seeing this message presented on the big screen.  It's good for young audiences.

2 star thinks the teenage lead isn't going anywhere.  I disagree.  I think this kid could go far.  He evolves during the story arch and we viewers get to see that.  He handles it well.  Just compare his posture from the opening scenes to his demeanor in the climax.  It's subtle.  It's supposed to be.  He handled it perfectly. And it's important.

I found the movie delightful.  I took my daughter to see it (she's 18 and loved it).  I highly recommend this show.  It works.

5830859,5,B00DL47424,"""No patterns on my quarter, cut your own path."" Duncan is a shy teenager who is stuck in a summer with his mom and her new boyfriend Trent (Carell). Duncan has no self esteem and when he leaves one day he ends up at a water park where he meets Owen (Rockwell) and finds himself. This is a very very funny and touching movie that all teens with low esteem should watch. This is a very different part for Carell and he does do a great job in this. As likable as Carell is you really hate him in this movie. This is also another movie that continues the trend of the lower budget movies being much much better then the big tent-pole movies that are being released. This is kind of hard to review since the movie is really nothing more then a kid gaining confidence over a summer but it feels like so much more then that. The kid that plays Duncan is great and Sam Rockwell is perfect in this. A great movie with great actors and a great message. A real must see. I highly recommend this.

5830864,5,B00DL47424,"Every once and a while there is a movie that just strikes a chord and sticks with you long after you've seen it.  For me, that includes movies like ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""The Dead Poets Society.""  ""The Way, Way Back"" is one of those movies.  It is a quite little movie that doesn't have car chases and explosions, there are no gimmicks anywhere, it's just a simple story told in a pretty simple way but still packs quite a punch.

The story's main character, who we see the world through his eyes, is 14-year-old Duncan who is on summer break with his mother, her boyfriend, played by Steve Carell, and her boyfriend's daughter.  None of them seem to get along that great and Duncan is truly a fish out of water (pun intended since a lot of this movie takes place in a water park) looking for where he fits in.

The two main characters that help Duncan find his way are the manager of the Water Wizz Water Park, played to perfection by Sam Rockwell, and the girl next door played by AnnaSophia Robb.  They keep Duncan on course when he tries to navigate through all the bad things happening at home.  He sees Carell's character, who plays a total jerk that truly makes you want to hate him, kissing another woman and finally blows up when his mother won't do anything about it.

Overall this is a story about growing up that I think everyone can relate to in some way or another.  The acting is perfection and the story so believable you are just transported into their world.  Perhaps that's what makes me put this movie into the same category as ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""The Dead Poet's Society"" as they are all about growing up and finding your voice in the world.

Overall I highly recommend ""The Way, Way Back"" to anyone, a true 5-star effort all the way around.",1381795200,2,1771,4.415384615384616

5830868,5,B00DL47424,"THE WAY, WAY BACK is a real-to-life movie portraying the story of hunched-shouldered, socially-awkward Duncan (played by talented Liam James) finding his life's meaning while away on vacation with his recently separated mother (Toni Collette) and her new boyfriend (Steve Carell). Seeking to escape the heart-heavy atmosphere weighing him down, Duncan peddles to the local water park, finding himself mentored by the comedic Owen (Sam Rockwell).

Despite the strong cast of comedians, THE WAY, WAY BACK should not be considered a comedy. In fact, most viewers will loathe the despicable character played by the usually lovable Steve Carell. But, as in life, comedy offers a welcome salve to an otherwise hopeless reality. Like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/50-50/dp/B006X6J8IA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">50/50</a>, another movie I recently reviewed, the combination of brilliant comedy amidst bleak reality makes for an excellent storytelling combination.

THE WAY, WAY BACK is one of this year's best films. The entire cast, not just those previously mentioned, pull together to create a believable atmosphere of social conflict resulting from heartbreak and untruthfulness. Audiences have cheered and will continue to cheer for Duncan as he navigates the complexities surrounding him, leading to a very satisfying, happy-tear conclusion.

As an aside, the soundtrack for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Way-Way-Back-Music-From-The-Motion-Picture/dp/B00CU9QFL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Way Way Back (Music From The Motion Picture)</a>&nbsp;is equally exceptional, capturing the summery teen feel as well as the emotionally-high transition into the coming-of-age moments.",1381536000,5,1769,6.784140969162996

5830900,5,B00DL47424,"'The Way Way Back' is really great movie which is both hysterically funny and deeply heartwarming.  It tells the story of Duncan (portrayed by Liam James) and his mother Pam (portrayed by Toni Collette) as they go on a summer vacation with Pam's boyfriend Trent (portrayed by Steve Carell) and his daughter Steph.  Duncan is quiet and shy and evidently not enamored with his mom's boyfriend.  The summer vacation is filled with a lot of adult fun, but Duncan seems to be forgotten in the whole thing, until he finds a place to fit in at a local waterpark, where he meets Owen (portrayed by Sam Rockwell).

The movie is filled with hysterical performances by Alison Janney and Sam Rockwell, and it also has a very serious side as it examines the difficult family dynamic between the main characters.  There are several secondary stories which tie nicely into the main story as well.  The story is complemented by a great soundtrack, which has an eclectic mix of songs.

Overall, after seeing this movie, you might feel it is a bit formulaic and sappy, but it isn't.  The combination of the very funny dialogue and the serious and heartwarming story of Duncan makes this movie a very fun one to watch.  You will walk away satisfied, both from laughter and probably a few tears as well.

This one's well worth your time and whatever you spend to see it.  And as if what I've written above isn't enough, I'm buying the DVD as well!",1380931200,13,1427,4.600790513833992

It happened to be showing on a recent long haul flight, so as a captive viewer, I started to watch it and was very pleasantly surprised. The movie was far better than I thought it would be. My only comment is that Sam Rockwell was clearly channeling the Bill Murray Tripper character and Liam James the Rudy character from the original Meatballs movie. It was spooky how similar the characters were, as was the relationship between them. Nothing wrong with that - Meatballs is a hidden gem and it's been a few years.",1380758400,4,651,4.4789915966386555

The film isn't perfect, but if you accept it on its own terms, and just watch the fine ensemble acting from all those involved, you won't regret it.",1378857600,5,450,4.857142857142857

5830906,5,B00DL47424,"My mom, step sister and I were going to see a movie.  There were two we had to choose from.  My mom said this movie was out.  I saw a preview for it a bit ago and wanted to see it.  So we did.  I am so glad we choose this movie.  It was one of the best movies I have ever seen.  That being said, the movie is very simple.  There are not a lot of things going on.  Though you may find that the characters have a lot going on in their lives.  Things are changing.  The movie is one I am sure you've seen before.  A girl and her father and a boy and his mother find themselves together.  They go on a trip.  Certain members of the group may not get along.  The mother tries to make everything work.  The boy is shy and kind of a dork.  He finds someone to help him relax and that lets him see that he can be and is a good person.  You will see things happen that will make you ask yourselves why.  Why the people or person would be with the other, when they seem so different and when one seems to really only have themselves in mind.

Does that make sense?  I did not want to give to much away.  This movie had 80s summer movie written all over it.  I really enjoyed it.  I will pre order as soon as I can.  The cast is so great in this movie.  You see a lot of known actors.  Even in smaller parts.  You may be able to figure out what is going to happen at the end.  But you may be surprised.  Though, at the very end something happens that really leaves you wondering.  Wonder IF.  Amazing movie.  Check it out!!!!

Just a bit more.
You really see a reflection of the parents in their kids.  The son does not know who he is.  He is afraid to say what he thinks and to stand up for himself.  The daughter is kind of mean and thinks only of herself.  She does seem to change or at least act different during a part towards the end though.  Very well done.

I really liked the colors and general tone of the film.  Everything seemed to be set to the same pallet.  Very relaxing and laid back.  The colors and textures never took over the story of the movie.  Sometimes it seems like things get dragged down by certain elements of movies.  That never happened in this movie.  Such a great movie.  Just go see it.  I do am sure you will enjoy.",1375747200,15,2238,3.934684684684685
5830907,4,B00DL47424,"""The Way, Way Back"", written and directed by Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, is a welcome escape in the summer sea of bloated, unimaginative summer blockbusters. Combining funny moments with incredibly rare observations, the film is a gem that deserves to be remembered among the best coming-of-age films.

Faxon (star of the short-lived TV show ""Ben and Kate"") and Rash have been working on this project for years. A while back, the stars started to align and they were able to get the relatively small budget together before moving on and signing Sam Rockwell, Toni Collette, Allison Janney and Steve Carell. At the most recent Sundance Film Festival, ""The Way, Way Back"" sold for a near record price to Fox Searchlight and a mid-summer release date was set.

Duncan (Liam James) travels with his divorced mom (Toni Collette), her boyfriend (Steve Carell) and his older daughter (Zoe Levin) to the boyfriend's summer house in a sleepy New York beach town. As soon as they arrive, the boyfriend's insecurities begin to rear their ugly heads, but Mom downplays the behavior, desperate for a relationship, any relationship even if there are problems. And the boozy next door neighbor (Allison Janney) immediately insinuates herself into the family's activities. Kip and Joan (Rob Corddry and Amanda Peet) are two friends who hang out with the family a bit, but they have problems and insecurities as well. When someone comments ""It's like summer camp for adults"" they weren't kidding. As the vacation continues, and Duncan feels increasingly alienated, he finds solace and friendship in Susanna (AnnaSophia Robb), the daughter of Betty (Janney) and Owen (Sam Rockwell), the manager of a rundown water park, Water Wizz.

When you watch a film like ""Way Back"" it quickly becomes apparent that someone was crafting this story from events they actually experienced. There are too many moments that seem real, could be real. Jim Rash wrote an early draft of the screenplay based on his own experiences. Later, when he became creative partners with Nat Faxon, they fleshed out the story and ideas and made it something that is, at times, a little magical.

As Duncan realizes how much his mom is going to side with her new-ish boyfriend, played completely against-type by Steve Carell, he spends more and more time trying to stay away from them. He spends a lot of time outside and watches as Susanna deals with her own parental issues. There are moments when we think Susanna might become the typical teenage girl, ready and willing to lord her supposedly confident sexuality over the younger boy living next door because many of the girls in her group do this. But she shows some depth and doesn't fall into this trap; she prefers to do things her own way and that means talking with and becoming friends with Duncan. This relationship is especially refreshing and adds nice nuance to the film.

Out of frustration, Duncan rides a bike far into the little village and finds the run-down water park. He quickly meets Owen (Rockwell), his girlfriend, Caitlin (Maya Rudolph) and two of the ne-er do well employees, Roddy and Lewis (Faxon and Rash). Owen immediately takes a liking to Duncan and you can see he recognizes a little of himself in the younger boy, so he befriends him and gives him a job. Duncan immediately takes to the new profession like a fish to water and really seems to grow and break out of his shell. These moments are quiet and subtle, making them seem almost downplayed and ultimately more real.

But then he has to return home every night. And face the reality of his mom's low self-esteem and her boyfriend's continuing efforts to demoralize him.

So the young man seeks refuge at the water park and Owen becomes a mentor to Duncan, listening to him, guiding him and teaching him. These interactions allow the teenager to have fun and forget about his troubles at home.

Liam James seems like a natural fit for Duncan, a smart, good looking, normal young teen with pretty typical problems. While this may not be an earth-shattering portrayal, the young actor makes the role very believable. We can all relate to his problems because we have gone through many, if not all, of these issues ourselves. James makes the role believable by bringing the quiet nuances and moments to life.

Toni Collette is also pretty much perfect as the single mom desperate to make her new relationship work. Because of this desperation, she overlooks many things, neglecting her needs, her son's needs, losing a little of herself and her son in the process. It is Collette's ability to bring a quiet intensity to this role that makes it work. She doesn't shout a lot, but pain and disappointment register on her face. And when realization hits, it is a powerful moment because it could happen to any of us.

The lovable, but awkward guy Steve Carell usually portrays is nowhere to be seen. Instead, he has a lot of problems he has clearly never dealt with, choosing to deflect them upon those around him. It is a good performance and more memorable because it is surprising.

As soon as Allison Janney's Betty appears on screen, her mouth opens and she begins a rapid fire litany of booze-induced observations, remembrances and predictions that prove she is simply the perfect person to play this role. Betty insists on becoming a part of the festivities and Janney provides a lot of laughs throughout the film.

But the real standout in the cast is Sam Rockwell. I have never been a huge fan, but as Owen, he seems the perfect fit. Again, there are some great comic observances, but the filmmakers have also managed to give him moments of particularly lucid introspection. Owen recognizes a lot of himself in Duncan and while he realizes it is too late for him to change, there is still time for Duncan.

""The Way, Way Back"" is a fairly rare film; when you leave the theater you feel like smiling rather than demanding a refund. You also remember moments from it, moments that will make you smile and moments that will make you talk about the story with your friends and family. Don't miss it.",1375574400,5,6084,4.793893129770993
5830908,5,B00DL47424,"Written and directed by the team of Nat Faxon and Jim Rash (winners of the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for The Descendants), The Way, Way Back is absolutely one of the best films of 2013 so far. And even saying that feels inadequate because it's such a fine film, a coming-of-age comedy/drama with a great script, fine performances by a superb cast, and directed with a flawless natural touch so that there's never a moment where things feel false or forced.

The Way, Way Back is seen from the point of view of Duncan (Liam James), the  shy and awkward fourteen-year-old son of recently divorced Pam (Toni Collette), as they head out on a summer vacation with Pam's also-divorced boyfriend, Trent (Steve Carell), and Trent's teenaged daughter Steph (Zoe Levin). Riding in the back of Trent's station wagon, Duncan is visibly less than thrilled at the prospect. It's quickly apparent why in the opening scene when Trent engages Duncan in conversation while Pam and Steph are sleeping, asking Duncan to rate himself on a scale from one to ten. When Duncan shrugs and rates himself a middling ""six"", Trent immediately responds with a down-putting

""I think you're a three.  You know why I think you're a three?  Since I've been dating your mom, I don't see you putting yourself out there, bud.  The good news is that there are going to be plenty of opportunities for you to take advantage of at my beach house this summer. It's a big summer for all of us really.  So what do you say you try to get that score up huh?  Aim a little higher than a three?  You up for that, buddy?""

Which tells us everything we need to know about Trent and how he deals with people.

When they arrive at Trent's beach house, they are immediately greeted by neighbor, Betty (Allison Janney), who like Pam is divorced with kids, teenage daughter Susanna (AnnaSophia Robb) and younger son Peter (River Alexander). Later on they are joined by Trent's friends Joan (Amanda Peet) and Kip (Rob Corddry). Duncan feels distinctly out of place and increasingly miserable. Trent and Pam are always partying with Trent's friends (with Trent constantly seeming to find ways to intimidate or humiliate Duncan). Steph is like a miniature version of her father, bossing her own clique around and not wanting anything to do with Duncan. Peter's too young to be company, and Susanna is, well, a girl, and Duncan finds it very difficult to talk to girls. Even when Susanna makes the effort to talk to him.

Desperate to get away from the beach house, Duncan finds a small girls' bike - probably Steph's when she was younger - in the garage and takes a ride into the nearby town. At the local pizzeria he sees Owen (Sam Rockwell) busily playing Pacman on an old videogame machine. After watching for a bit, Duncan mentions that there's a trick to the game - a pattern to follow that'd make it a lot easier. Owen looks at Duncan like he's crazy. ""What fun is that?"" Owen retorts. ""Just following a pattern?"" Before he can finish his game though, Owen, who it turns out owns the local water park - the Water Wizz - gets called back to work.  He still has a life left on the game, so he asks Duncan to finish up. But as Owen leaves, he calls back mock-imperiously ""No pattern on _my_ quarter!  Cut your own pattern!"" Which tells us everything we need to know about Owen and how different he is from Trent, something that Duncan immediately picks up on.

The next day, Duncan goes to the Water Wizz, partly out of curiosity but mainly to get away from the beach house. The scene when Owen comes across Duncan sitting by himself on a bench is priceless:

Owen (deadpan serious):  ""I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.""
Duncan (startled): ""What?""
Owen: (still deadpan): ""You're having way to much fun. It's making everyone uncomfortable.""
Duncan (dejected, getting up to go): ""Okay.""
Owen (dropping the act when he realizes that Duncan is taking him seriously): ""Wow! I was just kidding! And that wasn't even my best stuff!""

Before Duncan knows it, Owen takes him under his wing and gives him a job helping out at the Water Wizz, giving him both a place to escape to during the day and, more importantly, a place people just accept him as he is. This is the kind of summer job we all wish we had when we were kids (well, all of us who aren't future Trent's anyway).  Given his first real taste of both acceptance and responsibility, Duncan blossoms in the easy-going environment, and for the first time we actually see him happy.

It's hard to say enough about the superb cast and the spot-on performances they bring. Liam James (The Killing, Psych) does a marvelous job of bringing out Duncan's coming of age, growing over the course of the film from being withdrawn and uncertain to growing in self-identity and confidence as he confronts the unpleasant realities that his mother is unwilling to face.  Toni Collette (The Sixth Sense, Little Miss Sunshine and The United States of Tara) is particularly moving as Duncan's mom, Pam, struggling to deal with being divorced, with raising a teenaged son and with her fear of being alone, and knowing that she's not doing all that good a job at any of it. Steve Carell, well-known from his many, many comedic roles, turns in a highly effective straight-laced performance as Trent, bringing out the character's manipulative and frequently demeaning nature in both subtle and not-so-subtle ways. Allison Janney (The West Wing)'s Betty is a nice turn as a kind of simpatico counterpoint to Pam, being another divorced mother with kids, trying to do her best and dealing with the same struggles, albeit with a fair amount of drinking, a performance at once both comic and sympathetic. Maya Rudolph (Bridesmaids, Saturday Night Live and Up All Night) is solid as Owen's patient but reaching-her-limits girlfriend, Caitlin. AnnaSophia Robb (Bridge to Terabithia, Soul Surfer) is perfect as Susanna, Duncan's companion in summer-vacation misery and the girl who (after several tries) gets Duncan to open up some. River Alexander has some choice comic moments as Susanna's younger brother, Peter, who's desperate to escape their well-meaning but trying-too-hard mom. And writers/directors Nat Faxon and Jim Rash bring good-natured comradery as Roddy and Lewis, veteran employees of Water Wizz, the water park where Duncan ends up working. But it's Sam Rockwell who gives The Way, Way Back a lot of its comic heart as Owen, the laid-back cracking-wise owner of the water park who ends up taking Duncan under his wing and giving him his first tastes of independence, of responsibility, and most importantly of acceptance for simply being who he is and not expecting him to be anything other than that.

The screenplay is extremely well done, with a nice even flow and natural believable dialogue that gives depth and development to all of the characters, and is, I feel, worthy of a Best Original Screenplay nomination come Oscar time.  According to an interview, Jim Rash said that the main inspiration for the story was really the opening scene between Duncan and Trent, which was based on a similar conversation he had with his own stepfather when he himself was 14.

There is also an interesting story behind how the film ended up with the title The Way, Way Back.  When the script was actually written back in 2007, the original title was The Way Back, which was easily understood given the themes of the film and the way in which it ends.  However, by the time the project was green-lit for actual production, another film with the title The Way Back had just come out in 2010.  So partly to avoid confusion with that film, and partly as a kind of inside joke, Faxon and Rash changed the name of their film to The Way, Way Back.

And on a last note of trivia, the Water Wizz is an actual water park in Massachusetts. Everything you see in the Water Wizz scenes - including the staff uniforms - is part of the water park, and most of the extras are locals who actually go there. A nice touch of reality that really adds to the realistic feel of the film.

Highly, highly recommended.",1375488000,114,8102,4.71004243281471
