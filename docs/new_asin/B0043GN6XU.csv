4255690,5,B0043GN6XU,"I am writing this review (with all due respect) to counter the review below that advises Placido Domingo to give up singing baritone roles.  Domingo is a great artist whose longevity on the operatic scene is a source of admiration to me.  While he is no longer a young singer, he has matured as an artist and as an actor.  All this is evident from his performance here as Simon Boccanegra which is moving and heart-felt.  I do not believe this is Mr. Domingo's attempt to have a second career as a baritone, it is simply that he CAN sing this role and he brings so much to it.  At this stage in his career and with all the gifts that he has given us over the years, if he wants to sing a baritone role, I would say go for it.  I would like to also point out that many years ago when he was singing all the great tenor roles, he recorded Figaro in the Barber of Seville (another baritone role).  Some of these baritone roles have a high tessitura and they could easily be sung by a dramatic tenor.  I also would like to point out that Adrienne Pieczonka is marvelous singer and great artist.  For me any chance to see her perform is a great occasion.  I do not believe for a second that she is having an off night in this DVD.",1300320000,5,1225,4.1308016877637135
4255691,5,B0043GN6XU,"For an opera that is alleged to be one of Verdi's more unpopular operas, Simon Boccanegra has garnered more DVD's than one could have assumed. Of course, part of this interest is the result of Domingo's desire to sing the role. A number of houses invited the tenor to sing the role there and Domingo accepted. Two of those houses have now provided us with the documentation of the great tenor singing a great Verdi Baritone role.

When PBS telecast the Met investiture I listened/watched with curiosity. Domingo sang like Domingo, neither tenor nor baritone. It did seem as if, however, there appeared to be a lack of power that one associates with the role but it couldn't be denied that the voice was in healthy condition without a hint of wobble or poor intonation. Still I remained convinced that this assumption was questionable. What I did not question were other principals in the cast. James Morris who has given long servce to the Met and has been replaced in Wagner roles was singing Fiesco. Unwise move. Added to his CV this document will not add luster to his career (most of his roles in the Italian rep have been undistinguished). He is afflicted with a wobble and the experience of hearing his Il lacerato spirito was painful. Like many older listeners and those curious in the history of singing will have heard Kipnis' recording of this aria. It was a benchmark and remains so. I do not know if it is available on YouTube, but search it out. A soprano whom I have (and still do) admired, Adrianne Pieczonka, was the Amelia. Either the role is uncongenial or she was in poor voice on the day of the taping; it was distressing to hear her laboring to to sing the music, notably the opening aria. Adorno was Marcello Giordani. I confess that I have never heard this man sing a role that made me want to hear more of him. I find the sound leathery, uniniflected and worst of all unmusical. Adorno is not the tenor role of one's dreams but he participates in duets and ensembles and is critical. Then there is the production: I suppose one either likes it or doesn't. For an opera set in Genoa it makes no attempt to convey the geography; it is claustrophobic and lacking in any sense of location. Indeed, I suspect that it could be interchanged with a number of operas.

The EMI set on the other hand is superior in all the aspects that I have cited above. Domingo is still Domingo but he sings with a greater freedom and more power than in New York. The ROH production is, if not the last word, preferable to del Monaco's in its openness; it fails only in the great Council Chamber scene. The Amelia, Marina Poplavskaya, has created a great deal of controversy in New York with her Violetta in the Willy Decker production of Traviata. ROH is a house that has welcomed her in Don Giovanni, Don Carlo, (both the premiere and the revival) and Simon Boccanegra. She is in good voice and I have enjoyed her singing with its youthful freshness and dramatic commitment; I wish that her Italian were better, but she is an appealing presence, notably in the great father-daughter duet in Act I. She is also a wonderful Desdemona in a Salzburg Otello conducted by Muti. Furlanetto is the Fiesco and while he may not erase memories of Kipnis, he is a marvel--the Italian equivalent of Matti Salimen, two artists who have retained their voices after decades of singing. Indeed Furlanetto appears to improve as the opera progressed. Pappano and his orchestra bring a vigor and enthusiasm to the performance that really conconvinces you that his truly is one of Verdi's great works.

Calleja is the Adorno and in every way he is superior to Giordano. To begin with his musical instincts are greater, his sensitivity, his sense of light and shade all combine to make the role more interesting. It is interesting to note that in the thirties, the role was sung by Martinelli: in one of the early LP recordings the role was sung by Giuseppe Campora, a lyric tenor who also sang Fenton. I don't think that this is a ""one size fits all""  role, but Calleja's lyric voice is not compromised in any way and is very good--even when compared to Domingo's own assumption of the role in the Met's second DVD.

My only criticism is the casting of Jonbathan Summers as Paolo. I assume that Summers is a house artist and have no doubt that he is as important to ROH as Charles Anthony was to the Met. Vocally he leaves something to be desired. The role is not large but it is an important one. If one goes back to the era of 78's and checks out the old RCA catalogue you can find a Chamber Council scene with Tibbett, Martinelli, Bampton and Leonard Warren as Paolo. In those days it was not uncommon to find Paolo a stepping stone to the role of Boccanegra. Unfortunately that would appear to be a tradition that has passed on and the only Paolo on DVD who could conceivably step up in rank is Mario Vratogna in the Arthaus DVD. Obviously this is not a deal breaker in deciding to choose a DVD but surely ROH could have done better.",1296345600,7,5018,4.522026431718062
4255692,5,B0043GN6XU,"I saw this performance in the theatre a few months ago.  I felt the production was extremely powerful so unless they have botched the DVD, I can't wait to see it again.

Since one reviewer bashed Placido Domingo, I have to say that after the first few measures in which Domingo sounded much more like a tenor than baritone, he became increasingly credible in the role.  Theatrically, this was effective because Boccanegra ages tremendously in this opera.

It's interesting to compare Don Carlo to Boccanegra, two recent Met HD broadcasts, because the entire Don Carlo opera, a very big and long opera, takes place in a very short span of time.  It's unclear exactly how long that span is, but historically, the end of the war/wedding/death of Carlos were all in the same year.  That creates a different kind of theatrical intensity.

Boccanegra spans such a long period of time that it almost loses its coherence here and there, but this production was amazing.  I was so moved by the majesty and nobility and musicality that I will buy this DVD even if ten more people give it low ratings.",1296172800,2,1090,4.7
4255693,4,B0043GN6XU,"I enjoyed this video quite well.  It would not be my 'desert island' Boccanegra and I don't know if I would return to it often but I was very interested to see and hear Placido Domingo in the title role and I enjoyed him immensely.  Of course, you might wish for a bit of a deeper sound in the title role, but the fact that he is 70 years old, and still delivering very satisfying performances is downright thrilling.  He is very touching and it is enjoyable to see him in a role where he physically fits the character more than the young, tenor characters we have seen him in, but that don't quite match his physical maturity now.

The miscasting in my opinion was James Morris, whose voice is far from rich an simply isn't low enough to create and exciting Fiesco.  Not quite a fiasco of a Fiesco - but dull.

I found Pieczonka very enjoyable with a pretty, easy-to-hear voice.  I didn't notice her being off-key as someone else seemed to.  Also, I found Giordani in quite good voice and I enjoyed him very much.  The Paolo was pleasant-voiced, but perhaps could have been a bit more dynamic.

If you have never seen this opera, and want a more rounded out version vocally, the earlier Met version with Placido in the tenor role is a better choice, with Chernov in the title role and in exceptional voice.  Te Kananawa sings Amelia in the earlier video and Robert Lloyd is a much more acceptable Fiesco.",1295827200,18,1405,4.428015564202335
4255694,5,B0043GN6XU,"For legendary tenor Pl&aacute;cido Domingo, this summit among Verdi's dramatic baritone roles has gone from a ""maybe someday"" dream to a daring experiment slated for the eve of retirement, to, finally, just another role for the (voluminous) books as his career chugs on in its sixth decade. In the same month Domingo celebrates his 70th birthday, two new DVDs document the undertaking, with Sony licensing the February 2010 Met broadcast and EMI the July 2010 Covent Garden. The dual releases are a testament to star power: neither production was new, and both have long been available on DVD with other singers (indeed, the first DVD of Giancarlo del Monaco's Met BOCCANEGRA has Domingo in the tenor role of Gabriele Adorno, c. 1995). If a viewer must choose, it should be an easy call: Covent Garden/EMI boasts a stronger overall cast and a staging with more life and dramatic perception.

On radio or records, this would only be a good BOCCANEGRA. Live in the house or on video, it is more -- new virtues become apparent, and vocal weaknesses are less bothersome as part of an overall theatrical package. Much credit goes to Elijah Moshinsky, whose Covent Garden production always was stimulating, and here benefits from two decades of refinement. Moshinsky left the work in its period and there are only light glosses of abstraction. A fixed set of columns at stage-right blurs distinctions between indoor and outdoor action, and Moshinsky and designer Michael Yeargan use a recurring visual motif of jumbled names and words significant to the action of the opera, printed on backdrops. In the Prologue, the writing is in Italian and has the look of chalk on a blackboard. In the Council Chamber, the same words are in Latin on a red and gold banner, an ornate display of establishment authority. In the beginning of the final act, with order restored, the words revert to Italian, taking the form of graffiti scrawls the people are trying to scrub away. (Do the words stand for, respectively, Paolo's ambitions, his influence while at Boccanegra's side, and ultimately his dishonor and death?)

Moshinsky and the singers deliver here what eluded Giancarlo del Monaco and his casts on both DVDs of the more lavish and realistic, ""picture-book"" Met production: persuasive and involving character work. There is evidence throughout of choices having been made, and for every one I feel misses the mark (Paolo and Pietro are too broad in their self-congratulatory back-slapping as they exit together in the Prologue), half a dozen are convincing, with the effect of drawing us into the characters' triumphs and dilemmas, papering over cracks in BOCCANEGRA's occasionally creaky plot. For example, Amelia/Maria absentmindedly touches and plays with the locket around her neck, which contains her dead mother's portrait, significantly in advance of the locket's becoming an explicit plot device -- such a good behavioral detail that it seems obvious in hindsight. Paolo is proto-Iagoian and dangerous from the first, which is not the worst way to put over a nebulous villain who somehow got both stronger and murkier with Boito's revisions. In the father/daughter reunion duet, Boccanegra does not simply express operatic amazement for a few seconds and then behave as though his long-lost daughter is a gift to be taken for granted. His awe and wonder pervade that entire movement, communicated by the way he looks at and gingerly touches Amelia's hands and hair, a sensitive physical evocation of parental curiosity. The treatment of Boccanegra's instructions to Paolo at the end of the Council Chamber Scene, culminating in the ordered curse, is intriguing: the Doge's attitude combines a predatory shrewdness and clarity with (at ""Bramo l'ausilio tuo"") caustic mockery.

Domingo has treated his voice well, and in his sixties I heard many performances that made me reflect that the singing would be the envy of a man 25 years younger. But it would be going too far to claim he has been untouched by time. He sounds recognizable, but this is the kind of performance that prompts an admirer to begin with ""For a man nearly 70 years old..."" or ""At an age when most tenors have long since retired..."" The role's tessitura is no strain; indeed, in this Verdi baritone role, I sensed that the ""Verdi"" part was more of a hurdle than the ""baritone."" Domingo's emission does not have the iron firmness of old (a slight wobble has set in); the breath line is shortened; and there are occasional resorts to vocal trickery to achieve legato at a desired dynamic level -- in the long lines of ""Piango su voi"" (Council Chamber) and the very exposed ""Gran Dio, li benedici"" (launching the final scene's vocal quartet), he now must affect a covered, hot-potato sound that makes consonants vanish. But an aging great voice can be preferred to an adequate one in its prime, and this is a Boccanegra of style, stature, and feeling. The experiment was a success.

The other principals are worthy collaborators, although, again, their total performances in collaboration with Moshinsky are more satisfying than their singing in isolation would be. Ferrucio Furlanetto makes an appropriate foil as Fiesco. Sixty at the time, he sounds plausibly older than Domingo, and now has a tendency to overact his way through when vocally hard-pressed (e.g. rushing through a line or abbreviating a note value in a shout or grunt). It is the right size and color of voice, and there are still power and intelligence behind it. ""Il lacerato spirito"" is affecting, not only the aria itself but the accompanying pantomimes of grief and devoutness.

Marina Poplavskaya (Amelia/Maria) reinforces impressions of her as a performer right for the video/HD age. Though she is musical and perceptive, her singing is frankly uneven; registers are not well integrated, and effects are unpredictable. At times she sounds impressively full; elsewhere, well-judged authentic pianissimi alternate with a breathy, unsupported croon masquerading as same, at which points she is barely audible. She is, as always, a sensitive and dignified actor, the best on this stage: consistently present and engaged in her emotional responses (including while listening) and generous in rapport with partners.

As Gabriele Adorno, Maltese tenor Joseph Calleja (here looking very much like the actor Oliver Platt) is sweet-toned and likable, but the role makes no sense for him at this juncture. He sounds to be having a strenuous sing, at the upper limit of his capacity, and the lack of ease (plus the presence of Domingo and Furlanetto) makes his clumsy Italian stand out more than it would if he were singing the Duke of Mantua, which he is presently doing in New York. Nor is this hotheaded young blade a good fit for Calleja temperamentally. It is difficult to imagine anyone finding this genial, cautious presence threatening; there is no tension when Adorno rages over his belief that Amelia has been unfaithful, and the off-stage bloodshed and intrigue in which the character takes part is hard to enact in one's mind. Calleja's acting mostly consists of eye-popping.

Jonathan Summers, an experienced Boccanegra himself, gives Moshinsky the desired Paolo -- unsubtly but effectively unhinged. Paolo is the one competitive advantage to the Met/Sony DVD, which had a sensational vocal performance by Stephen Gaertner, a young baritone who replaced the scheduled singer late.

Antonio Pappano has minor coordination issues between the orchestra and both Domingo and Summers in the Prologue, and a few lyrical effects early on sound fussed over, but his ends up being an impressive and memorable traversal. The reading is impactful yet alert to the richness of Verdi's somber chording, and full of striking individual contributions (the bass clarinet shadowing the curse; the unusually assertive timpani punching through Fiesco's gloomy philosophizing in the quartet).

Technical credits are top-notch, but for some inelegant compression in the translations. Behind-the-scenes clips are woven into the performance, with Pappano explaining the plot and alerting listeners to musical details. These segments, seemingly pitched to opera novices, are discretely tracked; a viewer can watch or skip them to taste.

Despite my mixed feelings about much of the singing, I award this the highest rating on the strength of its stage production and other points of excellence mentioned above. It is the best BOCCANEGRA DVD for the time being, and there are now ten available (not bad for a supposed ""problem"" opera which faces audience resistance). For a baritone/bass duo in a vocal class by themselves, see Cappuccilli and Ghiaurov on an otherwise undistinguished 1976 Tokyo/VAI DVD, and hope for eventual release of the famous Abbado/Strehler production (the same duo plus Mirella Freni's Amelia/Maria). This is not to be confused with Abbado/TDK, with Karita Mattila and a poor male cast in an interesting minimalist production by Peter Stein. The 1995 Met/DG, the best of the three Met DVDs, is the suggested alternative to the new EMI for anyone demanding an actual baritone (Vladimir Chernov in this case) in the title role.",1295740800,27,9165,5.149093351242445
4255695,1,B0043GN6XU,"I don't know why anybody has not told Plcido what a disastrous role he is playing as a baritone in the autum of his career, a good one that should have ended more than a decade ago.  All principals here are a disaster, Morris is wobbly and never has been a true bass; Giordani bleats his way around and Pieczonka is not in a good night.  The Covent Garden DVD at least had a superb Fiesco in Furlanetto and the other two principals were good.  Please Mr. Domingo, let go of the idea of singing as a baritone which you are not, your baritone experiment is a complete failure.",1295568000,8,574,4.247706422018348
4255696,3,B0043GN6XU,"A .400 batting average would be great in baseball, but it's disappointing for the Met.  Only 2 0f the 5 principal singers reach base in this performance.  The amazing Placido Domingo, at the age of 69, sings with undiminished brilliance & intensity, albeit not as a tenor, but in the baritone title role.  Also outstanding, both vocally & dramatically, is Stephen Gaertner as Paolo.

But Adrianne Pieczonka shouts her way throughout, often off-pitch, with nary a hint of musical or dramatic nuance; Marcello Giordani often seems unsure of himself & tends to bleat; James Morris's once-magisterial voice sounds tired & threadbare, & he struggles, with difficulty, to get through his great aria, ""Il lacerato spirito.""

However, James Levine & his magnificent orchestra are, quite simply, magnificent, driving the score with precision, pulse & unflagging energy.  The costumes & sets are as sumptuous as the orchestral sound, down to the tiniest details of embroidery & furniture ornamentation.

The Met can still, on occasion (sadly, with increasing infrequency), mount a visually resplendent, ""traditional"" production.  It certainly does so here.",1295049600,25,1146,5.435028248587571
4255697,3,B0043GN6XU,This production has Domingo singing lead as a baritone. He is OK but he is better in the 1995 production as a tenor. Also Giordani just does not cut it in the tenor role.

4255700,4,B0043GN6XU,"Some customers will naturally resist the idea of one of the great tenors of our time attempting one of the more demanding Verdi baritone roles. Although I would personally prefer to hear Boccanegra sung by a genuine baritone, this performance works both musically and dramatically. Placido Domingo is in fine voice at the age of 70 and has always had a rich lower register which he calls on frequently in this performance. Of all the opera performances that I have seen Domingo give on video, this is clearly one of his finest achievements. He sings the role with great warmth, musicality and attention to the dramatic detail. His acting of the part is outstanding and he is always a commanding performer on stage. Marina Poplavskaya is also a star of this performance. She looks wonderful, moves beautifully and sings with great feeling. She is a genuine Verdi diva but never sings louder than she needs to. Ferrucio Furlanetto  had a stellar career and is still one of the great Verdi basses but his voice has clearly seen better days. Nevertheless, he is a compelling  Fiesco and his stagecraft is outstanding. Again, Jonathan Summers shows signs of wear and tear on the voice but he has been a stalwart of the Royal Opera for three decades for good reason. His portrayal of the villain Poalo is intelligent and convincing. Adorno is played by Joseph Calleja who gives an ardent performance. It is a genuine tenor voice well suited to Verdi although the fast vibrato can sometimes give the listener some nervous moments. He rises to the occasion magnificently in Act 3 with the big recitative and aria. The council chamber scene is a huge highlight in this performance as it often is.

The orchestra in Simon Boccanegra is not just there to accompany the singers but is an integral part of the drama, almost like a Greek chorus. Verdi experimented with a large variety of orchestral textures and moods which are all brought out beautifully under the baton of Antonio Pappano who, incidentally, provides a short and sweet introduction to each act, not allowing the exclusive backstage footage to interfere with the viewers operatic experience.
 The production is economical but very effective. I thought the recurrent theme of writing on the wall was a master stroke.
While there are some vocal flaws, there is certainly no bad singing and Domingo's performance is one for the ages. There are better sung performances of Boccanegra but, as a full operatic experience on DVD, I thoroughly recommend it.",1361577600,,2503,4.89622641509434
4255701,2,B0043GN6XU,"Domingo's attempts at baritone roles is successful only because, in my opinion, he is an untouchable. People love him and his ventures into the baritone repertoire are celebrated, but he can ONLY be compared to other baritones in the role and as such he fails.

Gobbi, Cappuccilli, Milnes, even Hampton, are all better by far. What is depressing is if you really want Simon Boccanegra on DVD you are overwhelmed with Domingo live performances. I do not deny his stature as one of the great 20th Century singers but that should not give him license to do anything without fair criticism.

Domingo is not a baritone, and while his stage presence might fill the shoes of Boccanegra, his thin, hollow ""baritone"" voice does not.",1352937600,3,723,4.82258064516129
4255702,5,B0043GN6XU,"Verdi's too long ignored Simon Boccanegra receives a smashing production in this important live broadcast production at the Metropolitan Opera in 2010.  This was the baritonial bow for the now 70 year old Placido Domingo and he impressed the world at the facility with which he transitioned from one of the world's greatest tenors in the roles of the light baritone range - a very wise decision for an artist of his caliber at this point in his singing career.  This production is elegant and meaningful and defines many of the obscure details of the libretto quite well.  Domingo is joined by Adrianne Pieczonka, the gifted Straussian soprano from Canada, as Simon's daughter (the only real female role in the cast), Marcello Giordani as the sole tenor love interest, James Morris as the elderly Fiesco, and Patrick Carfizzo as the villainous Paolo.

The Los Angeles Opera is now staging Simon Boccanegra for its musical director Placido Domingo who stars once again in the title role.  If anything Domingo's immersion into this perplexing role is more complete now (two years later) and the voice is still blossoming on the top as well as honey-hued on the bottom.  This opera is rich is orchestral writing - some of Verdi's very finest.  And the choral writing is also some of his finest.  The opera has its plot problems, but with performances like this form the Met and the one currently gracing the stage in Los Angeles all of that is less a problem than critics create.  The opera is rich in vocal splendors and if there are no 'famous arias' as form Verdi's other works, it is only because we don't hear this grand work performed frequently enough.  Perhaps the day of Simon Boccanegra has arrived.  Grady Harp, February 12",1329004800,,1731,4.794612794612795

Now, in his late 60's, with the darkening of that fabulous vocal instrument, he experiments by returning to his baritonal roots - with mixed results.  The acting, discipline and technique is there, but alas, he really cannot get his voice low enough so that you might ""feel"" the deep resonance or that rumbling sensation produced by a ""true"" baritone, e.g., Sherril Milnes. Other reviewers of Domingo's experiment have pronounced it a success, so mine might be a minority opinion, but I defend it on the grounds that when I grade Domingo I want to give him, not just a passing grade but the highest one possible - and I cannot do that here.",1302393600,10,977,4.735294117647059

At this point, Domingo still had control of his voice--the review for the revival in 2015 was much less glattering,  As this particular DVD, I loved it.  I found all the proncials outstandind, including the rather frayed Fiesco by James Morris, himself another long-lasting legend.  I will no go after the Domingo/Tekenawa",1432425600,,557,5.144444444444445

8414938,5,B0043GN6XU,"The critics like this presentation of Simon Boccanagra. It is definitely a masterpiece but not heard often enough. I saw part of it on tv in Japan. I decided the same day to buy it through Amazon.. Placido Domingo is quite moving as Simon. I like this mixture of tenor and baritone voice. This lightens also  the opera which has the reputation to be dark music wise. James Levine, the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra and the chorus make this video an excellent addition to my music library.

8414939,4,B0043GN6XU,"Placido was very good as a baritone.  He belted out the words with force... though occasionally his age did show through with some notes.  He will always be a great actor/singer.
The music is so beautiful... it could actually stand alone.
Glad I purchased it.",1412812800,,259,4.733333333333333
8414940,4,B0043GN6XU,I choose because of Morris and Domingo.  I prefer Domingo as a tenor but he did sing some good parts. Morris at the age he is still put on a good performance even tho his voice has changed.  The two of them together really acted out their parts especially the last act when Domingo reveals who Amelia is.  The performance was their last one and all seemed to struggle with their music.  I saw a piece of the rehearsel and Morris was in good voice then.  Levine conducted as always excellent. The music really spoke to you.  Was worth watching the two veteran performers work together and enjoyed the back stage interviews.,1393891200,,622,4.508928571428571
