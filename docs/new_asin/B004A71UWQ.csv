8419550,3,B004A71UWQ,"This is a cool film about the Russian poet (and Nobel prize winner, and exile) Joseph Brodsky. I do not like his poems. They are too opaque for me. But the film is fun. It shows mainly his childhood which was mainly good. Later on the Soviets exile him because they can''t understand his poetry either. There are some great anaimated scenes in this film: one of musical insruments flying through the sky and, another section about a cat. Most of the movie is filmed though - not aniamted. Altogether a nice entertaining piece.",1393977600,,526,4.6063829787234045
8419551,4,B004A71UWQ,"Room and a Half is a recall through the techniques of film of an earlier more classical era when civilization and culture had true value. The director Khrzhanovskiy shares with Brodsky a similar historical period being of similar ages,sharing similar friends and being brought up in the famous `room and a half' apartments,celebrated in this film. However they never met. Khrzhanovoskiy is drawn to him as Brodsky did many drawings which the director shows in one of the extras. He is also drawn to his prose essay ""A Room and a Half"" from the collection ""Less than One"".

Like Brodsky he was an only child and deeply devoted to his parents. The film is playful in tone as he suggests Joseph Brodsky,the Nobel Laureate, was in his outspokenness about individualism vs.mass conformity. This film is a fiction and takes poetic liberties with the facts of Brodsky's life. Using a perfect blend of different styles-fiction,animation and historical footage-in an absolute mastery of the different formats to create a magical, creative fantasia which is unified. At odds with post-WWII Stalinism and later Kruschev. He spent 2 years in a Soviet prison in the 60's and was eventually exiled from the country and his parents(forever),living in the U.S. from 1972 until his death in 1996. The soundtrack contains a lot of Bach and his favorite Haydn.

Walking out of school forever from age 13 his parent's apartment is a creative wonderland in a context of communal living. We see the boy and then the college student. In a hilarious montage of short scenes young Brodsky brings home various girlfriends in the half room,with the ultimate goal of having sex with them,while the parents,a short distance away try to pretend nothing is happening. Stalin's repression of artists and intellectuals(especially Jews) is shown by the image of musical instruments slowly floating above,and leaving,the city of Leningrad,like a Chagall.

Brodsky's reminiscences of his father and mother are full of heartful nostalgia as they adjust to contracting circumstances. The poet in exile as a university professor in the U.S.is shown phoning home,the umbilical chord of his new life and success. He never returns,so he is shown,in the after-life,sailing to the country of his childhood, traveling through space as well as time to see them once more. Brodsky's poetry is given a few short readings,but the film doesn't get close to Brodsky's importance to world literature as the great poet of freedom, exile and soul lament. If you like the film,go straight to the work. Forget then the life. The real Brodsky is in the poems. The power and lyricism. I loved the film for reminding us of Brodsky,the jazz,the cigarettes,the cats.",1325030400,,2705,5.087837837837838
8419552,5,B004A71UWQ,"Probably not much call for a film like this, but you don't have to be a lover of Brodsky's poetry to appreciate the wonderful biographical tale Andrey Khrzhanovskiy has woven together from 45 ""photographs"" into Brodsky's past.  The premise is fictitious.  We meet an aged Brodsky sitting on the deck of a small ocean liner penning his memoirs as he returns to Russia for a final visit.  His pen takes us back to his youth in Petersburg shortly after WWII and moves forward through the Russian thaw and eventually takes him to America, where he would gain his political freedom, if not his poetical freedom.  He remained forever linked to his homeland, recalling his doting mother and eccentric father, the friends he hug out with, his troubles with authorities which eventually got him expelled from Petersburg for ""decadence and modernism"" in his poetry, and his general vagabond ways.

Khrzhanovskiy recalls much of Brodsky's poetry as he weaves sepia tones, B&W and muted color vignettes together, along with some wonderful cartoons which add another layer of poignancy to this movie.  It is Brodsky's mother, however, who takes center stage in this film, played by the grand actress, Alisa Frejndlikh, probably best known for her role in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Office-romance/dp/B0002KM5RE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Office romance</a>.  As real characters fade into ghosts and an aged Brodsky confronts his past in a modern Russia, the movie deftly explains itself in a bittersweet ending.

Brodsky never got the chance to return to Russia.  He evoked his past in his poems and essays, from which Khrzhanovskiy pieces together this film.  No doubt he also filled in the gaps from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joseph-Brodsky-A-Literary-Life/dp/030014119X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joseph Brodsky: A Literary Life</a>, which was first published in Russian by Lev Loseff, a longtime friend of Brodsky.  If you aren't familiar with Brodsky this movie is a beautiful place to start.",1306368000,,2081,5.8125
