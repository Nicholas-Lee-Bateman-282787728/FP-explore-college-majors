7814735,3,6301766164,"Entertaining B western from the golden age (Late 40's & 50's) with a strong cast.  Jane Russell plays Belle Starr the famous female outlaw.  While in real life she wasn't beautiful like Jane Russell, but she had to have had something there was no end of men that wanted to marry her -- for real.  In the cast also Scott Brady and Forrest Tucker (both feature stars themselves), Andy Devine and a aging George Brent.  Brent does a good job, but I wonder if casting could have chosen a younger man, Brent was in his fifties.  The plot picks up after Belle's husband Sam Starr had been killed and Bob Dalton (Brady) has rescued her from being hung.  After she feels that the Dalton Gang gave her and her friends hideout up to the law, the ""Bandit Queen"" starts up her own gang and becomes famous.  She has plans to rob a saloon owner (Brent), but Brent (Who is secretly planning to catch the Daltons) falls for her immediately and tricks her into becoming a half owner in the saloon.  Russell performs a few musical numbers while running the saloon.  Decent western entertainment, worth watching.
In real life Belle had gone to finishing school and was well educated before the Kansas-Missouri Border War.  She had known the James gang and the Youngers.  While not linked with Bob Dalton, she was linked to Cole Younger.  It is said that when a member of her gang was captured, she would either bribe his way out or use her feminine charms to seduce their way out and it usually worked.  She also like to dress flamboyantly.  Jane Russell handled the role well.",1401062400,,1558,4.537634408602151

7814737,2,6301766164,"Belle Starr (1848-89) was the first of the female outlaws, and even to this date, more than a century and a half later, she heads a very short list (e.g., Ma Barker and Bonnie Parker). Her story was popularized in dime novels beginning in 1889 and in films beginning in 1928. She was played by Betty Compson in ""Court Martial"" (1928), Gene Tierney in ""Belle Starr"" (1941), Isabel Jewell in ""Badman's Territory"" (1946), Elizabeth Montgomery in ""Belle Starr"" (1980), and Pamela Reed in ""The Long Riders"" (1980).

If most of her films did not do justice to her real life, ""Montana Belle"" is the worst offender, with the only bare facts of her name, her marriage to Sam Starr, and his death prior to hers. Otherwise this is merely a traditional 40s oat burner, more about the Dalton Gang than about Belle Starr.

Of course it's not a total waste. No film with beautiful Jane Russell can be a total loss, and Jane gets a chance to do two musical numbers. Jane Russell (1921-2011) made her screen debut in ""Outlaw"" (1941) and went on to make nearly two dozen films, including ""Paleface"" (1948) with Bob Hope, ""Double Dynamite"" (1951) with Sinatra and Groucho, ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" (1953) with Marilyn Monroe, and ""Gentlemen Marry Brunettes"" (1956). She's OK is this one, and her voice is pretty good, although her dancing leaves a lot to be desired.

The film features Scott Brady as Bob Dalton, Forrest Tucker and Jack Lambert as members of his gang, Andy Devine as a sleazy traitor, and George Brent as a businessman who falls in love with Jane.

Scott Brady (1924-85) specialized in playing tough guys in more than 100 films and TV shows. I liked him best as ""The Dancin Kid"" in ""Johnny Guitar""

Forrest Tucker (1919-86) is best known from TV's ""F Troop"" (1965-7) but he was a prolific film actor in the 40s and 50s, frequently appearing in westerns (""The Westerner"", ""Gunfighters"", ""The Nevadan"") and war films (""Submarine Raider"", ""Sands of Iwo Jima"", ""Fighting Coast Guard"").

Andy Devine (1905-77) made over 400 films, include several with John Wayne (""Stagecoach"", ""Liberty Valance""), but perhaps is best remembered as Guy Madison's sidekick in TVs ""The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickock"" (1951 - 1958).

Handsome George Brent (1899-1979) is best known as the frequent co-star with Bette Davis in 13 films although he was also very close with Garbo. His memorable films include ""Dark Victory"" (1939), and ""The Spiral Staircase"" (1945).

Jack Lambert (1920-2002) plays a half breed named Ringo. Lambert is one of those actors whose face you've seen dozens of times but whose name you never knew. He appeared in over 50 films (e.g., ""Dick Tracy's Dilemma"", ""Vera Cruz"") prior to turning his attention to TV where he usually played a cowboy appearing in episodes of ""Gunsmoke"", ""Daniel Boone"", ""Bonanza"" etc.

Director Allan Dwan (1885-1981) made more than 400 films, most of them in the silent era. He's best known for ""Heidi"" (1937), ""Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farms"" (1938), and ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" (1949). He did several film noir including ""Slightly Scarlet"" (1956) and ""Surrender"" (1950), but was more versed in the western - ""Cattle Queen of Montana"" (1954), ""The Restless Breed"" (1957), ""Silver Lode"" (1954), etc.

The NY Times called it ""the most overstated Western of the year"" and said that Russell was ""beginning to look saddlesore.""

The film was actually made in 1948 but not released until 1952. The top grossing films in 1952 were ""The Greatest Show on Earth"", ""The Bad and the Beautiful"", ""The Snows of Kilimanjaro"", ""Ivanhoe"", and ""Singing in the Rain"".  ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" won for Best Picture and other Oscar winners were ""High Noon"" (Actor), ""The Quiet Man"" (Director), ""Come Back Little Sheeba"" (Actress), and ""Viva Zapata"" (Supporting Actor). Other memorable films that year were ""Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd"", Tracy and Hepburn as ""Pet and Mike"", Fritz Lang's ""Rancho Nororious"", ""The Red Planet Mars"", ""Scaramouche"", and Marian Cooper's ""This is Cinerama"".

Bottom line - not much here to appreciate but fans of Jane Russell will enjoy it nonetheless.",1326412800,,4095,4.969298245614035
7814738,3,6301766164,"Jane Russell, in a modest performance, is cast as the West's most notorious female outlaw, a role previously played on screen by Gene Tierney in ""Belle Starr"" in 1941 and by Isabel Jewell in ""Badman's Territory"" in 1946... Director Allan Dwan could not take any interest into the unworthy storyline or the determinedly pedestrian cast... In addition, the harsh colors are no asset to the proceedings...

Belle Starr (Russell), an outlaw's widow has a misunderstanding with Scott Brady and the three outlaw Dalton Brothers... She joins with Forrest Tucker and Jack Lambert in a holdup rampage, gaining an even more unpleasant reputation... Later she returns to her old favorite place of resort disguised sufficiently so that no one recognizes her...

Because gambler-saloonkeeper George Brent has $50,000 in funds that Jane is longing to gain, she persuades him to take her as a partner at his saloon... As the new presiding mistress of the establishment, Jane finds time to sing ""The Gilded Lily"" and to understand that Brent is basically a good guy after all, even though he is determined on bringing the Dalton gang and Belle Starr to justice...",1233878400,,1147,5.063492063492063
