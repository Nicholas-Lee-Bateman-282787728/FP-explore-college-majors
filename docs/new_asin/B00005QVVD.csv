1649529,5,B00005QVVD,Mash is the best show there has been on TV period.....Have a nice Day!!,1006992000,,71,4.142857142857143
1649530,5,B00005QVVD,I am looking forward to finally seeing the parts of season one I have never seen. Each and every time the pilot i on FOX or our local programming I miss it and have to wait to try and catch it in the future. The fact it is on DVD is also a bonus as MASH is a program that can be just as funny today as it was in the 1970's when it started. I am very happy to see this television program brought to DVD!,1006560000,6,402,3.632183908045977
1649531,5,B00005QVVD,"MASH is great. Just thinking of the show makes you smile. It's perfect humor, always with a message and always saying that war is hell. For example Klinger, who wore dresses and ate jeeps just to get out of the war. That makes for great humor, and if you look deeper you can often see a serious part of the show.
MASH is definitly something special, and you can watch almost every episode over and over again without being bored. And the price for it is great! Let's just hope the other seasons are going to be released too!",1006214400,6,524,4.303030303030303
1649532,5,B00005QVVD,"M*A*S*H is certainly one of the best shows in TV history.  Every other year or so I find myself watching them again and enjoying them even more.  The Colonel Blake years are my favorite and the first season was really great.  I like them all though and having them released on DVD means many years of great use and for the price of 24 episodes on one release can't be beat.  It would be nice to have a few extras, but the show is good enough for me.",1005091200,7,449,4.068181818181818

1649538,4,B00005QVVD,"Acting and direction are top-notch. But!!!Mash is a very left-wingish show. The fact that communist North Korea started the war is never mentioned once in the entire series ( and many characters in the show curse the war and the US leaders for it).

PS Boris Yeltsin presented many old Soviet documents in 1994, the documents showed how North Korea begged the Soviet Union for permission to start the war in 1950. See book (""The Forgotten War Remembered, Korea"") by Bill Shinn here at amazon.",1508284800,2,492,4.788235294117647

1649590,5,B00005QVVD,"A great season to start your MASH experience off with (natcherally), and full of surprises for those who know later seasons of MASH. In 1972, the producers were still experimenting a bit with the format, and were bringing in characters alternately to try them out - there was a different actor as Father Mulcahey (seen in nearly the first shot of the pilot), we get a rare glimpse of Gary Burghoff's short left hand fingers (also the first few scenes of the pilot), only two episodes with Lieutenant Dish (also the pilot, and one more), louche jokes, a bit of SC Jones, plenty of Ugly John, goofy Marx Brothers impersonations, a Ron Howard guest appearance, Leslie Nielson as the Ringbanger, a rare appearance of Sparky, and all sorts of other fun stuff. Even the music wasn't quite in place, as some openers late in the season experimented with an alternate big band opener on the same theme, and in the pilot there's talking over the music, which runs an extended 90 seconds!

There are also plenty of references to the book, including the first episode where the doctors help Ho Jun build a college fund (but they lay off on the Passion Play stuff). ""Tuttle"" is probably one of the classic episodes of TV ever, and the scene where Hawkeye flies to the front to provide emergency medical attention is amazing stuff too. ""The Ringbanger"" is pretty good, with some nutty situation stuff with Leslie Nielsen, and ""The Moose"" shows some of the morality drama stuff that they had in later seasons (as does ""Sometimes You Hear The Bullet"", with its tragic twists). ""The Army Navy Game"" (Episode 20) and ""The Sticky Wicket"" (Episode 21) have a big band version of the opening theme, while this series also has the episode ""Major Fred C. Dobbs"", considered by many to be the worst episode in the entire series (the boys convince Frank that there's gold in them thar hills...). The season closing episode ""Showtime"" is pretty amazing too, with the unusual non-linear structure showing the crew of the 4077th enjoying some musical entertainment of a great singing ladies trio, with their standup comedian, plenty of episodes interspersed, and Gary Burghoff having a great time at the drums blowing it away.

Funnily enough, even though the set comes with the option to turn off the awful laugh track, actually turning it off isn't much fun. So there!",1456099200,,2342,4.780246913580247
1649591,5,B00005QVVD,The first couple of seasons are kind of rough with silliness and hijinks. The end of season 3 it begins to hit its stride. Stick through 3 and you'll find that in season 4 it begins to develop the characters. You'll then begin to understand why it's such a much loved series that's now appreciated by the younger generation.,1456012800,,324,4.508474576271187

1649600,5,B00005QVVD,"I was very saddened to learn of Wayne Roger's passing last night.  He portrayed Trapper John McIntyre during the first three seasons of M*A*S*H and what a character that was!  He had great chemistry with Alan Alda(Hawkeye Pierce)and never failed to make us laugh.  Once these two got together to torment Major Frank Burns, the poor guy didn't stand a chance.  Over the years Wayne Rogers was better known as a financial wizard and was often seen discussing market strategies on Fox.  He will definitely be missed.",1451606400,,513,4.850574712643678

With this set the sound and video quality are great, and you get the option to watch the show without the laugh track if you want. It's uncut and full length episodes. Eight episodes on 3 discs (24 in all). It'd be almost impossible to be dissatisfied with this set. Well worth watching at a great price.",1443139200,,595,4.274336283185841

One feature I think the produces of the DVD could have added, which we see on seasons 5-11:  I would very much like a ""PLAY ALL"" feature where we could watch all 8 episodes on 1 DVD without interruption - that is, watch all 8 episodes in sequence without constantly having to use the remote control on each and every episode.

I was told to wait additional days for a package that was already one day late.  So, I called back got a new operator and the REAL story as to why my package was late, they lost it in shipping.

1649698,5,B00005QVVD,"Season 1 of MASH, Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, depicts a fictitious Korean War Army unit near the front lines of a stalemate of a war.  Starring Alan Alda as Hawkeye, Wayne Rogers as Trapper John, McLain Stevenson as the Commanding Officer, LtCol Henry Blake, Larry Linville Maj Frank Burns, Loretta Swit Major Margaret Houlihan and Gary Burghoff Cpl Radar O'Reilly, MASH helped a nation take its mind off the still active, but declining war in Vietnam.

Comedy, as we know, has a way of making us look at something horrible in a positive or less than horrid light.  While MASH was specifically set in Korea, the situations, including the bandage stations and hospitals alike, were very similar to what our nation's young men would have been exposed to in Vietnam.

As a series, the first season of MASH was nothing less than wonderful.  The cast, for the most part, jived in such a way they seemed both familiar to us, the viewers, and each other as characters.  We learned that Frank had the hots for Margaret and Margaret felt the same.  Hawkeye was a single soldier, and as such, trying to hit on anything in a skirt.  Radar had a sixth sense which allowed him to finish sentences of the CO or detect incoming wounded or occasional rounds.  Trapper John, Frank and Hawkeye all shared accommodations in a tent lovingly named ""The Swamp"".

While not a paid entity, The Swamp was as much a character in the series as the mess tent and any number of Jeeps.

MASH was a laugh.  The nation needed a laugh.  MASH was a hospital.  The nation needed fixing.",1402963200,,1554,4.624087591240876

This is very difficult for my father to do so I have to do it for him.

on Mash. He was a comedic genious along with Alda, Rogers, Burghoff, Linville and Swit. I enjoyed all
the Mash seasons but to me they were the best. I still cannot believe he left that show to do Hello Larry
that bombed and i think he had a sort lived The McLean Stevenson show that also floundered. That was
almost as bad as Pernell Roberts leaving Bonanza and going out on his own. How ironic, he ends up
playing Trapper John M.D. based on Wayne rogers character from Mash. In closing, the first 3 seasons
are great and it's nice to take a stroll down memory lane once in a while.

1649815,5,B00005QVVD,"The ratings weren't great for the first season of MASH and it came close to being canceled after just one season. However, the wife of a CBS executive forbade her husband to cancel this so it was renewed for a second season where it became established as a favorite and hit show for CBS.
The first season is fresh and funny, even though it's on 8 times a day in some regions. The advantage to having your own copies is being able to avoid commmercials. No extras here unfortunately, but the show itself still stands the test of time.

Favorite episodes are:

To Market, To Market - Hawkeye and Trapper trade Henry's antique desk for medicine without him knowing it.

Requiem For A Lightweight - When Hot Lips vows to transfer a new and attractive nurse, Henry agrees to cancel the transfer only if Trapper emerges victorious in a mismatched boxing match.

The Moose - The surgeons set out to convince a Korean girl that she is free and not required to be anyone's servant or ""Moose"".

Yankee Doodle Doctor - Pierce and McIntire remake a visiting film producer's film with their own Marx Brothers touches.

Bananas, Crackers and Nuts - Hawkeye pretends to be nuts after he is refused R&R.

Cowboy - A seriously fatigued chopper pilot begins making life uncomfortable for Henry after being denied leave.

Dear Dad - The first of many letters home episodes.

Edwina - Hawkeye is elected to romance a klutz of a nurse.

Love Story - Radar falls for a new nurse and is coached by Hawkeye and Trapper on how to win her affections. ""Ahhh Bach""!

Tuttle - The staff at the 4077th are honored to have the patriotic and charitable Captain Tuttle in the midst. The trouble is that Tuttle doesn't exist except on paper. ""You might say that together we all made up Tuttle.""

The Longjohn Flap - During an especially cold period, a pair of longjohns is passed from one person to another at the 4077th

The Army Navy Game - The Army-Navy game on the radio is interupted by shelling but the main interuption is the unexploded bomb in the compoound.

Sticky Wicket - Hawkeye slugs Frank resulting in Hawkeye being confined to quarters.

Major Fred C. Dobbs - Frank requests a transfer to another unit. Hawkeye and Trapper fear that they might get stuck with someone even worse than so they decide to trick Frank into staying.

Ceasefire - Everyone except Trapper is convinced that the unconfirmed rumor of a ceasefire means the war will soon be over.

Showtime - A visiting USO troop in Korea addition to Henry's wife giving birth in Indiana are the highlights of the final episode. The final episode takes the time at the end to re-introduce us to the cast, so we don't forget until next year.",1315958400,,2677,4.590336134453781

1649832,4,B00005QVVD,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

As an entire epic television series, ""MASH"" is brilliant.  As a first season to what would become an iconic TV statement of life in an Army MASH unit in early 1950's wartime Korea, the first season is very good.  For seasoned ""MASH"" fans, it's probably perfect.  For late comers to the show who may expect unfettered brilliance immediately based on a reputation, there may be a letdown in store.

Created for television by Larry Gelbart, the ""MASH"" main cast for Season One consists of Alan Alda as Captain Benjamin Franklin 'Hawkeye' Pierce, Wayne Rogers as Captain 'Trapper' John McIntyre, McLean Stevenson as Lt. Col. Henry Blake, Larry Linville as Major Frank Burns, Loretta Swit as Major Margaret 'Hot Lips' Houlihan, and Gary Burghoff as Corporal Radar O'Reilly. Side characters like the Korean houseboy Ho-John and 'Lt. Dish' pop up fairly sporadically in the first season.  A more significant character over the life of the series is Jamie Farr's Corporal Maxwell Q. Klinger, who turns up early in the season in ""Chief Surgeon Who?""  Interestingly, while Father Mulcahy was in the pilot episode, William Christopher was not playing him.  That character was recast with Mr. Christopher playing him for the rest of the series.

Episode highlights include the pilot episode, where Hawkeye and Trapper auction a date with Lt. Dish to pay for Ho- John's education, with a twist in the end.  The pilot is also noteworthy for its extended opening, an effective homage to the show's cinematic origins.  Other episode highlights are ""Sometimes You Hear the Bullet,"" co-starring James Callahan(""Charles In Charge"") and a young Ron Howard, then still billed as 'Ronny Howard.'  A final favorite episode is ""Henry, Please Come Home,"" as one of the first episodes to put a spotlight on the relationship between Henry Blake and Radar O'Reilly.

The first season of ""MASH"" is mildly rough, but only because its later seasons are sterling.  This is relative criticism, as the worst of ""MASH"" trumps the best of lesser shows.",1280620800,,2033,5.047904191616767

1649863,4,B00005QVVD,"M*A*S*H the television show was loosely based on the book and movie and must have given the tv censors fits, especially back in 1972.

The show's creators knew that the zany comedy and elaborate set-ups and practical jokes had to be translated to the small screen.  It would be several years before the cast had established themselves and worked together long enough to make those nuanced but meaningful journeys into our heart.  It would also be a few years before the show developed into a platform for humanist ideals.  M*A*S*H is loosely set at an Army field hospital during the Korean War, but the series makes not thinly veiled pokes at the Vietnam conflict, which was winding down as the show started.

Alan Alda will forever be beloved as the dedicated surgeon - but irreverent military man - Benjamin Franklin ""Hawkeye"" Pierce.  Hawkeye is burned into our television consciousness as much as Ralph Cramden, Lucy or Jerry Seinfeld.

Hawkeye is joined by Wayne Rogers as best friend and roommate Trapper John McIntyre. They share a tent with right-wing nutcase and religious hypocrite Frank Burns, played by Larry Linville.  Burns, a less competent surgeon than Hawkeye and Trapper, states that he is a happily married man, but the worst-kept secret in camp is Frank's affair with Margaret ""Hot Lips"" Houlihan, played by Loretta Swit.

The 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital is commanded by Henry Blake, played by McLean Stevenson as a doctor who seems a comic dimwit - it is difficult to see why Frank Burn's surgical skills are denigrated when Henry is as flighty as a canary most of the time.

The heart of the 4077th for his time on the show was Gary Burghoff as Corporal Walter ""Radar"" O'Reilly - called Radar due to his sixth sense about impending things like ambulances bringing wounded.  But in this first season Radar is not the innocent grape Nehi-drinking teddy bear soldier of later seasons.  At the beginning Radar drinks alcohol in the swamp and is a wily behind the scenes wheeler-dealer.

Klinger and Father Mulcahy were very much characters under development - in the first few episodes the beloved chaplain is played by George Morgan, who doesn't have time to make much of an impression, before being replaced by William Christopher, who fleshes out the Father we came to know and love.

Season One is important for historians and completionists, but it would not be difficult to argue that the show was far from ""hitting its stride.""",1250380800,5,2461,4.884615384615385

Another highlight is the 1972 pilot, which provides a spirited introduction to Alan Alda, Wayne Rogers and Company. By the end of Season One, ""M*A*S*H"" has found the ideal serio-comic balance.

1649869,4,B00005QVVD,"MASH is one of my top 10 favorite TV Shows of all time and it is a joy to see the antics of these Mobile Army Surgical Hospital doctors.  I am not a big fan of seasons 1-3 because the characters seem to too cartoonish for me and story lines seem a little weak.  I guess the producers wanted to keep close to the movie which was a little on the corny side.  With these faults, the show remains a classic for all generation and the dialogue is rather simple to understand.  Season 1 set the tone for the introduction part of the show to millions of viewers.

If I rated Films or TV Series based on whether I liked them, I would have rated the entire series a 5 or a 6, but I rarely do this.  Each episode is high quality and the sound is great.  They bring back the joy I originally had when I first saw them minus the commercials (which are really not that important.)  One problem exists the DVD itself dose not have a lot of features.  You can not ""play all"", there are no filmographies or even a list of the extra and cameos that made M*A*S*H one of the best shows.  It would have been more interesting to see where all those extras went off to do.

1649894,5,B00005QVVD,"'MASH' is one of the finest American TV series ever to come out of the old network system. As practically everyone who searches Amazon for information on this great show will have undoubtably already read the excellent highlighted reviews, I'd like to add my case for starting your 'MASH' collection with this particular DVD set.

First, as this was the first season, the show has yet to fully evolve into what we all remember it as from syndication. There's an endless parade of cute young nurses, and multiple characters from the film appear here and nowhere else in the series. Also, much of the comedy leans toward what other military-based sitcoms had already done. Thus, certain things happen in this DVD set that we don't usually associate with MASH. I don't regard this as a debit as it keeps this particular box set from being predictable.

Second, continuing with the shock of surprise comes the revelation that the producers seldom insisted on period accuracy. The aforementioned nurses, for example, wear 'mod' hairstyles and Radar O'Reilly reads comic books that weren't published until the 1960s long after the Korean War was over. The nonconformist attitudes of many of the doctors is definitely not what one would have expected in the 1950s and neither are most of their haircuts. Back in the early 1970s, this might have been seen as a flaw. Today, it helps to remove the 'period piece' stigma that so many other early 1970s sitcoms suffer from. Coupled with the use of film stock rather than videotape and this is certainly one of the freshest-looking TV comedies over 30 years old.

Third, there's the opportunity to appreciate actors portray characters who either were not there for the full run of the series or who evolved into something very different. McLean Stevenson's Colonel Blake may never win awards as a model of military efficiency, but I sure would love to have someone that easygoing as my boss! Wayne Rogers' approach to Trapper John make him seem like Dean Martin to Alan Alda's Jerry Lewis-like Hawkeye Pierce. Gary Burghoff's early version of Radar O'Reilly is a very sly, shifty, deceptively dimwitted corporal who is far removed from the lovable innocent we all remember. And was there ever an actor better capable of playing a pompous twit than Larry Linville as Frank Burns? Linville also shows incredible ability as a straight man to both Rogers' and Alda's antics; the same jokes would likely fall flat without a steady straight man as a target.

On the downside there are no extras. We do get the chance to turn off the laughtrack, which makes the TV show seem even more cinematic than before. But there are no cast interviews (not even contemporary talk show interviews), no still galleries, no commentary tracks. We do get a mostly noninformative booklet with some tiny photos and a track listing, along with original airdates. I didn't feel cheated by this, as the price of the set makes it very affordable, but I do think it's a missed opportunity.

In sum, I was very impressed with how fresh 'MASH' is, and how nearly impossible it is to 'date' the series. The first season may not be as 'good' as the later ones, but to me the differences are so slight that this DVD set easily deserves 5 stars. I strongly suggest you start with this set and then work your way through the others in sequence.",1214956800,2,3345,4.790294627383016
1649895,3,B00005QVVD,"Season 1 of M*A*S*H is sometimes uneven but shows flashes of the brilliance that is yet to come.  Perhaps because it was a film first, the main characters spring to life fully-formed in the pilot episode (which I had never seen before).  And they are a great bunch of characters - the anarchic surgeons Hawkeye and Trapper, the laid-back C.O. Henry, Radar with his sixth-sense ability to anticipate everyone's needs (and to sense when the Medivac choppers are on the way), etc.  Even Father Mulchahy and Klinger are here in a few episodes, although neither are theme-song identified.  The only problem (which will continue through more than half the series) is Frank, foil for Hawkeye and Trapper.  He's just not bright enough to provide much challenge (unlike the later Winchester), and is basically the one-note incompetent boob that always bumbles around and provides the comic relief.  Not much better is Hotlips Hoolihan, although we know she eventually comes into her own and so we can cut her some slack.  Memorable guest appearences by ""Ronnie"" Howard and Leslie Neilson round out the casting for the season.

The writing is somewhat uneven this early in the series.  There are some truly brilliant episodes (some that are laugh-out-loud farce, some full of that bittersweet cynical humour for which the series is best known).  Unfortunately, there are some forgettable and even bad episodes that are cringe-inducing to watch.

So, for the season itself, I'm willing to give it about a 3.5 out of 5.  When it is good, it's very good.  There is also a very welcome option to turn off the laugh track (you can play the audio with it on or off).  Mercifully, the menus are not animated, although there is an annoying episode submenu for each episode.  The transfer looks and sounds great, and obvisouly the shows are uncut.  But I have to deduct another 1/2 star for the lack of extras.  Surely Alan Alda wasn't so busy on Season 7 of the West Wing that he couldn't have provided a commentary or two!",1203033600,3,2005,4.798833819241983

I bought the first season on DVD, and I'm recalling seeing MASH,when it originally aired on television. I do plan on someday, purchasing Season 2 of MASH, and hopefully Season 3 as well.

Hawkeye is one of my absolute favorite TV Characters and episodes which focus mainly on him are my favorites. As for the other characters,Henry and Radar are my favorites in this season. I also like Mulcahy and Klinger and Margaret too in later seasons. The only characters I truly hate are Trapper and obviously Frank. I like Frank as a villain  though and he can be very funny. Trapper,on the other hand ,I cannot stand. He is an obnoxious pain and he cheats on his wife constantly and quite happily. He is also very shallow and lacks the depth we see in practically every other character. I infinitely prefer his successor,B.J.Anyways,while the first season is inferior to the later seasons,it is still a good season. It suffers from being a first season though. It is clear that the cast and writers are still trying to discover the identity of each character. Also,the show is trying to establish itself apart from the movie. Several characters are eliminated after a few episodes and the jokes are a bit more risque in the earlier shows. The only truly awful episode in this season is ""Requiem for a Lightweight"".I found that episode to be very uninspired in story and execution. In contrast,some of the better episodes are ""Chief Surgeon Who"",""I Hate a Mystery"",Dear Dad"",""Edwina"",""Love Story"",""Sometimes You Hear the Bullet"",""Sticky Wicket""and ""The Army-Navy Game"".""Sometimes You Hear the Bullet is by far the greatest episode in this season and in my opinion one of the greatest episodes ever! It showcases the perfect example of the show's formula. A perfect blend of comedy,tragedy,and humanity.

Save your money and buy ""The Martinis and Medicine Collection"" which contains the whole uncut series,the original movie,and two bonus discs of features.

There is also the blood caper episode along with the made up ""Capt Tuttle""...definitely one of my M*A*S*H favorites!!!  So this is definitely a great foundation of your M*A*S*H collection.

This Isan't a 2 to 3 hour movie,there about 25 minute segments so why can't you be able to hit play and just sit back and watch one after another play on? Sorry but these people have to be missing some seriouse brain matter. I never ever expected to see this on a show like this. I'm done and done buying any more of these. I'll just wait and record them on cd one after another like they should be recorded. Goofy people that's for sure.

1649925,5,B00005QVVD,"M*A*S*H creaters can smile back at television gold's first season where fans who were fanning out of Winchester's ""polysalavic putdowns"", Sherman Potter's relentless cliche's, and Hunnicut's ""daddy"" ploy, can look forward to the  preserved-to-DVD era of when we first fell in love with the we-love-to-hate Frank Burns, drunken-but-warm Henry Blake, and the former co-pilot to Hawkeye, Trapper John.

  Consumers can look to this season for long laughs, fun jokes, and plenty of section-eight action in these fab-phenoms of episodes:

  In M*A*S*H (THE PILOT EPISODE), Hawkeye, Trapper, and Radar foil Burns, and fool Henry Blake in order raffle off a nurse in a party to send their houseboy, Ho-jon, to college. Another favorite, REQUIEM FOR A LIGHTWEIGHT is when Hawkeye and Trapper get into training to literally fight for a nurse in a boxing match after the ""semi-nude"" lady is sent away by a transfer request by Major Houlihan. Then we have CHIEF SURGEON WHO?, where two firsts are initiated: Hawkeye is recognized as top-of-the-heap and Klinger's high heels come alive for a visiting general, wherein Hawkeye says, ""Get a dress or something,"" to him while he's nude. The gang rallies together to abollish the keeping of a Korean house-girl in THE MOOSE, foil a politically spunky film made to look like the draftees were volunteers in YANKEE DOODLE DOCTOR, and find themselves being written about good or bad in a letter from the cheif surgeon to his pops in DEAR DAD. Hawkeye even finds himself under court-martial when he is accused of the loss of many items via five-finger-discount by the entire staff in I HATE A MYSTERY. Radar hops on the love train for a spin when Hawkeye and Trapper set him up with the nurse of his dreams in LOVE STORY. Old friends, in different ""shapes"" confront the members of the 4077th, especially in SOMETIMES YOU HEAR THE BULLET where Hawkeye sheds tears for an old friend, and realizes the error in his soft ways as he turns in a soldier that is too young to join the army, but wants to stay to impress his old hearthrob-sweatheart. Less of a

person- physical wise- arrives when Hawkeye re-creates his childhood imaginary friend to take all the credit for charity work he and Trapper wish anonymous in TUTTLE. The next-to-best friend ploy runs loose in THE LONGJOHN FLAP, where the whole camp gets a chance to wear Hawkeye's longjohns during the winter freeze. The camp tries to follow the ARMY-NAVY GAME during an enemy bombshell attack, hopes of early end to the war comes into their minds in CEASE FIRE, and the camp is treated to a showcase of entertainment featuring showgirls, a comedian, and the first-ever flash back multi-story show in SHOWTIME.

  Fans could look forward to the beginning of a new era of television, where emotions could be seen, laughs could be heard, and characters could make their first mark in our hearts.",1153785600,4,2877,4.899176954732511

Hawkeye pulls many pranks on his fellow army friends and keeps up his sense of humor but continues to learn new things about himself. MASH isn't only a show about the army and war, this show combines humor, history, and life lessons that apply to all. There are almost embedded and subliminal morals to each story.

1649939,5,B00005QVVD,"MASH - the series - is excellent comedy.  It is easy to forget that the first season was produced at the end of the Vietnam war, another unpopular war.  As the movie, the series created a uniquely odd setup by mixing raw comedy with a very strong, deep, and gloomy antiwar message.  The first seasons were based on actual Korean war surgeons, but there was a considerable borrowing from Vitenam war stories as well.  The first season has 24 episodes, including the pilot.  I think the first three seasons are the best of the eleven seasons.  Henry and Trapper balance Hawkeye much better than Potter and BJ.

During the first three seasons, the humor is rawer and funnier.

""M*A*S*H the Pilot""

-------------------

Pierce and McIntyre's houseboy, Ho-Jon, has been accepted to Pierce's old college, but needs one thousand dollars of tuition. To raise the money, Pierce and McIntyre hold a party while Blake is away in Seoul, much to the chagrin of Burns and Houlihan. At the party, a weekend pass to Tokyo in the company of a nurse, ""Lieutenant Dish,"" is raffled off. Because Dish is engaged, Hawkeye rigs the raffle so that Father Mulcahy ends up the winner. Margaret reports the doctors' actions to General Hammond, but he decides not to press charges after seeing them in action in the operating room.

""To Market, to Market""

----------------------

The black market has knocked off the 4077th's supplies again. Pierce and McIntyre meet with a black marketeer and agree to trade Blakes's 100-year-old vintage desk for a new batch of hydrocortisone1, which they desperately need.

""Requiem for a Lightweight""

---------------------------

Nurse Margie Cutler arrives at the 4077th. Realizing Cutler is an incredible distraction for Hawkeye and Trapper, Major Houlihan has her transferred to another unit. Henry agrees to try to get Cutler back if one of them fights in a boxing tournament with a staff member at Cutler's new unit and they agree. To secure victory, Hawkeye has Trapper's boxing gloves coated in ether.

""Chief Surgeon Who?""

-------------------

Henry has appointed Hawkeye chief surgeon, much to Frank's disdain. Frank and Margaret call over General Barker, who enters the insane world of the 4077th and tries to bring about some order. This episode marks the first appearance by Corporal Klinger.

""The Moose""

----------

Sergeant Baker stops by the 4077th with his ""moose""; a teenaged Korean girl named Young Hi whom he ""bought."" Obsessed with freeing the girl, Hawkeye wins her from Baker in a card game, but now Young Hi thinks she belongs to Hawkeye. Hawkeye and the other doctors try to change her into something other than a moose.

""Yankee Doodle Doctor""

------------------

Lieutenant Bricker is making a documentary about MASH units and General Clayton recommends the 4077th. However, when Hawkeye and Trapper discover the ""documentary"" is little more than army propaganda, they destroy it and make their own version.

""Bananas, Crackers and Nuts""

-----------------------------

Henry won't let Hawkeye and Trapper leave for R&R, so Hawkeye begins faking insanity while he's away and Frank is in command. Captain Sherman, a brilliant psychiatrist, comes over to see if Hawkeye's madness is for real and decides Hawkeye can use a few weeks of observation. To avoid this fate, Hawkeye, Trapper and Radar pull off a scheme that makes it appear Sherman sexually assaulted Hot Lips.

""Cowboy""

------------

A disgruntled chopper pilot nicknamed ""The Cowboy"" attempts to kill an emotionally exhausted Henry, through various creative ways, when he is denied a trip back to the United States, where he believes his wife may be cheating on him.

""Henry Please Come Home""

------------------------

Henry has been transferred to Tokyo for administrative and training duty and now things at the 4077th are run Frank's way. Hawkeye and Trapper forge Frank's signature on two passes to Tokyo and try to convince Henry to return to his old post.

""I Hate a Mystery""

-----------------

A stealing spree has swept through the 4077th and Hawkeye becomes the number one suspect when the stolen goods are found in his footlocker. How can Hawkeye convince Henry and the others that he's innocent?

""Germ Warfare""

--------------

Hawkeye and Trapper discover that a North Korean in the 4077th's care has a rare blood type. Since Frank has the same blood type, they furtively steal some of Frank's blood in the night. However when the patient develops hepatitis, they suspect Frank is the carrier. This is the last episode Spearchucker Jones appeared in.

""Dear Dad""

----------

Hawkeye writes to his father about Christmas at the 4077th, including Henry's mandatory talk about sex and an instance in which Hawkeye must perform field surgery dressed as Santa Claus.

""Edwina""

-----------

Edwina ""Eddie"" Ferguson, a fairly attractive but hopelessly clumsy nurse, cannot find any romance at the 4077th and the other nurses conspire to hold off their romantic relationships with the doctors and corpsman until someone agrees to date her. Eventually, the doctors draw straws and Hawkeye becomes her date for an evening.

""Love story""

-----------

Radar has received a ""Dear John"" recording from his fiance and he has consequently become depressed. This is until a new nurse arrives at the camp and it's love at first sight for him. However, Majors Burns and Houlihan want to break them up because their relationship is against regulations, forgetting that Radar's isn't the only romance against regulations...

""Tuttle""

-------

Hawkeye and Trapper invent a fictional Captain Tuttle2, but one thing leads to another and soon everyone at the camp believes Captain Tuttle is real. This creates problems when General Clayton decides to honor Tuttle by awarding him a commendation and placing his picture in the newspaper.

""The Ringbanger""

-----------------

Hawkeye and Trapper try to have Buzz Brighton, a colonel with a high casualty record, sent back to America by convincing him that he is insane.

""Sometimes You Hear the Bullet""

-------------------------------

Frank, who put his back out, has applied for the Purple Heart and Hawkeye discovers one of his patients is an underage solider4. Hawkeye agrees to keep the young boy's secret until another solider, who happens to be a childhood friend of Hawkeye's, dies on the operating table.

""Dear Dad...Again""

-------------------

Hawkeye writes to his father again about several crazy events that take place at the 4077th, including the discover of an Abagnalesque fraud masquerading as a doctor, Frank becoming drunk and Margaret's attempt to sing ""My Blue Heaven"" at the camp ""No-Talent Show.""

""The Longjohn Flap""

-------------------

In the middle of a cold snap, Hawkeye receives a pair of longjohns from home. Hawkeye gives them to an ill Trapper out of sympathy and Trapper loses them to Radar in a poker game. The longjohns pass through the hands of almost everyone in the camp before coming back to Hawkeye.

""The Army-Navy Game""

--------------------

The 4077th is under enemy fire and an unexploded bomb lands in the compound. Henry calls the Army and Navy for aid, but both are too busy listening to the football game to provide sufficient help. The Navy eventually identifies the bomb as belonging to the CIA, and gives them advice on how to disarm it. The bomb explodes after the doctors cut the wrong wire, but it turns out to be a propaganda bomb containing leaflets. The opening theme in this episode and the two following it is played differently than it is normally.

""Sticky Wicket""

-----------------

Hawkeye has always teased Frank about how incompetent he is as a doctor, but now one of Hawkeye's patients is failing. Hawkeye becomes obsessed with saving his patient to protect his ego. In the end, Hawkeye is forced to admit to himself (temporarily) that he can't win them all.

""Major Fred C. Dobbs""

--------------------

Hawkeye and Trapper's latest scheme succeeds where no other one has; Frank has finally demanded that he be transferred to another unit and Hot Lips has followed suit. However, when Hawkeye and Trapper discover they will be assigned double duty until replacements are found, they decide to trick Frank into staying by convincing him there's a fortune in gold to be found near the camp.

""Ceasefire""

-----------

News of a ceasefire has reached the 4077th. Everyone celebrates and says their good-byes, except Trapper who remains skeptical as to whether the ceasefire is for real or not. In the end the ceasefire does, of course, turn out to be a rumour, but not before Hawkeye tells several potential dates that he is married and forgives over a thousand dollars' worth of gambling debts.

""Showtime""

------------

As a USO stand-up comic performs at the 4077th, Henry's wife back home gives birth to a son and the camp's dentist receives his discharge papers and takes great pains to make sure he doesn't get injured before he sets off for home.",1143849600,4,8971,5.107829670329671

I think people ,if asked, are tired of what is on today and would not mind stepping back in time to shows like M*A*SH where you could sit down as a family without worries of cursing and nudity and vulgitery.  This is an awesome TV series.  I love watching it!  Most nights when there is nothing worth watching I will put in one of the many episodes of M*A*S*H and enjoy clean humor and feel good afterwords.",1136246400,,723,4.390977443609023
1649946,5,B00005QVVD,"M*A*S*H is one of the first tv shows I ever became hooked on, and this DVD set only reinforces my love of this series. The 1st season introduces us to the 4077 and their characters.  As a fan, these first episodes show the evolution it goes through from the pilot to the end of the 1st year.

""The Pilot"" - the opening montage with Trapper John (Wayne Rogers) yelling ""fore"" after hitting the minefield definitely sets the edgy tone.  ""Hawkeye"" Pierce (Alan Alda) makes his presence felt although he is much more greasy and unkept in the earlier episodes.  Spearchucker Jones (Timothy Brown) makes his debut before he's written off, and the rest of gang also are introduced.

""Chief Surgeon Who?"" - this episode written by Larry Gelbart definitely sets the tone for Pierce's character as an anti-army surgeon who puts life above death and bureaucracy.  Gen. Barker (played by the great Sorrell Booke) makes his 2nd and final appearance as a visiting General to the unit.

""Love Story"" - Radar O'Reilly (Gary Burghoff) cements his role among the staff with his crush on a brainy new nurse.  The writing really tightens as the characters really start to resemble what you'll see for the next three years.

""The Ringbanger"" - Maybe the best episode of the first season, a plot, that becomes very worn out in this series, is hatched where Hawkeye and Trapper try to take out a trigger-happy Col. Brighton (Leslie Nielsen) before more soldiers pay for his decisions.

""Sometimes You Hear The Bullet"" - the term ""dramedy"" is invented in this episode where the realities of war hit home with Hawkeye.  This is probably one of the better dramatic M*A*S*H shows ever.

""The Army-Navy Game"" - You gotta love those zany installments - and can you ever have enough Notre Dame jokes?

The great thing about this collection is you see warts and all how M*A*S*H developes very quickly into a tv institution.  The writing has its moments where the dialogue stalls - and the first batch of episodes have some dark overtones (an MP pulling a pistol on Hawkeye, a drunk Margaret putting her head in the stove over Frank).  It is, however, some of the finest American television of all time, and anyone who hasn't seen this stuff should.",1134172800,3,2217,4.736979166666667
1649957,5,B00005QVVD,"When I first starting watching MASH syndications, I started in about season nine. I had no idea who Frank, Trapper or Henry were. Suffice to say, I am glad I started collecting from the beginning!

I must say that I prefer the origina cast. This show was designed to be a comedy, but it became more serious and boring (in my opionion) when Potter, Winchester and BJ were introduced. Trapper was much funnier than BJ. He had more personality and a better sense of humor. Frank, as incompetent as he was, was still very funny, perhaps because he was so imcompetent pretending to be the model soldier. Henry and Potter were the complete opposites-Potter had no sense of humor at all, the laughs had to be worked in around him.

Some of the best episodes were ""Edwina"" where Hawkeye and the boys must end a ""Hanky-Panky"" strike from by the nurses by getting to know a completely klutzy nurse who cant seem to get a man or ""Chief Surgeon WHo?"" when Henry names Hawkeye as chief surgeon much to Franks chagrin whom brings in a general to settle the score. The Romance between Hot Lips and Franks is just beginning to bud, although she has a roving eye every time a higher ranking officer is in town. Klinger begins his quest for a section 8 by dressing like a woman. Radar seems remarkebly more mature in these episodes. He even relaxes and has a drink or two. In the following seasons, he turns into a young boy who just wants to go home to his mommy. In the first season, this is the pivotal one which will determine whether the show will have any staying power or not. And MASH passed with flying colors!!!",1128211200,3,1603,4.448979591836735

1649959,5,B00005QVVD,"The success of the 1970 film ""MASH"", which was directed by Robert Altman, inspired the production of one of the most successful and longest running TV series of all time: ""M*A*S*H"".  While most of the main characters from the original film were portrayed in the TV series, only one of the film's actors reprised his role for the TV series: Gary Burghoff.  Like the film, the show was about the men and women working in a U.S. Army ""Mobile Army Surgical Hospital"", or MASH unit during the Korean War in the early 1950's.  The MASH unit was known as the 4077th and its U.S. Army personnel included (for the first three seasons) Lt. Col. Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson, 1929-1996), Major Frank Burns (Larry Linville, 1939-2000), Maj. Margaret ""Hot Lips"" Houlihan (Loretta Swit), Capt. Benjamin Franklin ""Hawkeye"" Pierce (Alan Alda), Capt. ""Trapper John"" McIntyre (Wayne Rogers), Father Francis Mulcahy (William Christopher, except for the first season pilot episode), Cpl. Walter ""Radar"" O'Reilly (Gary Burghoff) and Cpl. Maxwell Klinger (Jamie Farr).

As in the film, the TV show often demonstrated a lack of respect for the U.S. military by portraying many of its officers as being inept and incompetent.  This was the formula used for Maj. Burns and Lt. Col. Henry Blake, but whereas Lt. Col. Blake had a very likeable personality, Maj. Burns wanted to see a more disciplined command and was often quite the little stool pigeon.  Also, while being married and regarding himself as being a devout Christian, Maj. Burns maintained a romantic affair with Maj. Houlihan.  (In the film, it was while Majors Burns & Houlihan were passionately kissing with the entire MASH unit listening to them that Maj. Houlihan earned the nickname ""Hot Lips"".)  Whereas in the film Maj. Burns (played originally by Robert Duvall) was whisked away in a straightjacket, in the show, this never occurs; but the film's two primary characters and pranksters, Captains Hawkeye Pierce (played originally by Donald Sutherland) and Trapper John McIntyre (played originally by Elliott Gould), were portrayed equally well in the TV show.  Though typically disrespectful of the Army, Hawkeye and Trapper were completely honest about themselves, which is probably the main reason why they despised the hypocritical Maj. Burns so much.  And, as in the film, they both found Maj. Houlihan particularly attractive, but weren't particularly friendly towards her because, like Maj. Burns, she wanted to see greater military discipline.  This often set Major Burns & Houlihan at odds with Hawkeye, Trapper and Lt. Col. Blake.  So, with the officers preoccupied, it was essentially up to the 4077's lowly company clerk, Radar, to keep things running smoothly; but even with the interesting personalities among the officers, the MASH 4077th had the best rate of survival for any wounded soldiers treated there.  Hawkeye was an especially gifted surgeon, as was Trapper; while Maj. Burns had probably barely made it through medical school.  Father Mulcahy was polite and helpful, but Cpl. Klinger's main objective was to get a ""Section 8"" from the U.S. Army so that he'd be discharged.  To get his precious ""Section 8"", Klinger wore women's dresses instead of his uniform.  As a side note, the only major character from the film that was not included in the TV series was another doctor named Capt. Augustus Bedford 'Duke' Forrest (played originally by Tom Skerritt).

The first season of ""M*A*S*H"" premiered in 1972 with 24 episodes.  These include the following:

1. ""M*A*S*H: The Pilot"". Hawkeye & Trapper have a wild party to try and raise money to send a young Korean man named Ho-John (Patrick Adiarte) to college in the states by selling raffle tickets for a date with Lt. Maria 'Dish' Schneider (Karen Philipp).

2. ""To Market, To Market"". After a shipment of hydrocortisone is stolen by black-marketers, Hawkeye & Trapper make a deal with another black-marketer that leaves Henry without his beloved antique desk.

3. ""Requiem for a Lightweight"". Trapper has to box a big soldier from another unit to prevent Hot Lips from transferring one of their favorite nurses away.

4. ""Chief Surgeon Who?"". Frank gets very upset when Henry makes Hawkeye the chief surgeon. Hawkeye then holds a coronation for himself.

5. ""The Moose"". To free a Korean woman that is essentially a slave to a U.S. soldier, Hawkeye cheats at poker to win her, but she won't leave.

6. ""Yankee Doodle Doctor"". In one of the best episodes, Hawkeye & Trapper take over the production of a documentary film about a MASH unit.

7. ""Bananas, Crackers and Nuts"". When Henry takes some R&R, Hawkeye & Trapper want some too; so Hawkeye feigns a mental breakdown, but it backfires with Maj. Burns in command.

8. ""Cowboy"". Someone at the 4077th is out to get Henry, including blowing up the latrine when he's inside.

9. ""Henry, Please Come Home"".  After Henry gets to go and work at a hospital in Tokyo, Hawkeye & Trapper are determined to get him back after Frank takes their still away.

10. ""I Hate a Mystery"". Hawkeye is blamed for a series of thefts around the camp, but someone else is doing it.

11. ""Germ Warfare"". When Hawkeye treats a North Korean soldier that needs more blood, he & Trapper take some of Frank's blood while he's asleep. When the North Korean develops hepatitis, they think that Frank has it too.

12. ""Dear Dad"".  The first of several episodes with Hawkeye writing to his father about various things going on in the camp, including him & Trapper sabotaging Margaret's tent.

13. ""Edwina"".  The doctors love to date the nurses, except for one named Edwina (Arlene Golonka), who tends to make bad things happen around her.  So, it's up to Hawkeye to take Edwina on a date or the other nurses won't date anyone anymore.

14. ""Love Story"". Hawkeye & Trapper set up Rader to have a date with a nurse after he gets a ""Dear John"" recording.

15. ""Tuttle"". In what is arguably one of the best episodes, Hawkeye creates a fictitious officer named Tuttle, who is supposed to be a humanitarian and brilliant surgeon.

16. ""The Ringbanger"". Hawkeye & Trapper manage to get a disliked colonel sent home through a bit of trickery.

17. ""Sometimes You Hear the Bullett"".  Frank gets a purple heart after throwing out his back when he was in Margaret's tent.

18. ""Dear Dad, Again"".  Hawkeye is writing to his father again, telling him among other things about Radar working to get his high school diploma from a private U.S. diploma company.

19. ""The Long-John Flap"". It gets very cold in Korea in the winter, so everyone wants to get their hands on Hawkeye's long-johns to stay warm.

20. ""The Army-Navy Game"". The 4077th comes under attack from friendly fire while too many military personnel are glued to their radios to hear the famed Army-Navy football game.

21. ""Sticky Wicket"". When Hawkeye bemoans what he has done wrong with a patient who isn't responding well, he moves out of the Swamp for a while.

22. ""Major Fred C. Dobbs"". To prevent Maj. Burns & Margaret from transferring, Hawkeye & Trapper devise a scheme that will affect Frank's greed.

23. ""Cease-Fire"". An unexpected cease-fire makes for a very celebratory camp, but it is short-lived.

24. ""Showtime."" In a weaker episode, a paranoid captain crashes a jeep and an entertainer visits the camp.

Overall, I rate the first season of ""M*A*S*H"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.  In its eleven years of production, ""M*A*S*H"" was one of the best TV shows of its day and remains one of the best TV shows of all time.",1127952000,2,7551,4.897798742138365

1649961,3,B00005QVVD,What do you get when you mix Groucho Marx irreverence with Dean Martin style boozing/womanizing and typical American sitcom preachiness... that's right you get MASH! Unfortunately this is the best of the series. I used to say that I liked the first couple of seasons when it was still a comedy and before it became The Alan Alda Knows Best Show but seeing these first episodes again makes me realize this show always was a one trick pony. Simply put I find Alda's snappy banter and easy self righteous indignance more than a little irritating. Big budget production and some decent acting from supporting cast members especially Larry Linville (who plays a perfect straight arrow doofus) keeps the whole thing tolerable but this show really hasn't aged well and comes across as typically mediocre American fare. The movie is much better in every respect!,1125273600,2,854,4.9375

When he and Wayne Rogers left, I tried to stay with the show but it just wasn't funny anymore.

1649976,5,B00005QVVD,"Based on a Richard Hooker novel of the same name, MASH was released in 1970 as a full-length feature film by 20th Century Fox before experiencing widespread success as a groundbreaking television sitcom in the Fall of 1972. The show's brilliant integration of drama and comedy made it one of the most celebrated shows in TV history, culminating in an eleven year prime time series stint. The 1983 series finale of MASH made history as the program with the single largest audience in television history, beating out several SuperBowls and the fabled ""Who Shot J.R."" episode of Dallas. With the proliferation of new television mediums, it's a record likely to never be broken...

The sitcom is set in South Korea during American involvement in the Korea War (with M*A*S*H standing for ""Mobile Army Surgical Hospital""). Buffered from the front lines by a mountain range and a minefield, the men and women of MASH were tasked with patching up wounded American soldiers. Unique to its genre, the cast of MASH was unusually large. Surgeons Dr. Benjamin Pierce (Alan Alda) and Dr. ""Trapper"" John McIntyre (Wayne Rogers) play the roles of excellent doctors who enjoy women and booze, while Dr. Frank Burns (Larry Linville) and Nurse Practitioner Margaret ""Hot Lips"" Houlihan (Loretta Swit) play foil to the two men's shenanigans (due to a contract dispute, Rogers' character was later replaced by Dr. B.J. Hunnicutt - played by Mike Farrell). The character of Frank Burns was also later replaced by Dr. Charles Emerson Winchester (David Ogden Stiers)...

Corporal Max Klinger (Jamie Farr) provides comic relief with his early attempts to procure a discharge by dressing in women's clothing, and Father Francis Mulcahy (William Christopher) adds flavor to a diverse cast of characters. Also rounding out the cast are Lt. Col. Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson), Corporal Walter ""Radar"" O'Reilly (Gary Burghoff), and Col. Sherman Potter (Harry Morgan)...

The MASH (Season 1) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the series premiere in which Hawkeye Pierce and Trapper John McIntyre learn that their houseboy, Ho-John, got accepted to Hawkeye's alma mater. In order to raise money for Ho-John's trip to the United States, the two auction off a weekend pass to Tokyo with Nurse Dish and celebrate the college acceptance with a lavish party... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""The Moose"" in which a GI arrives at camp with a Korean female slave he purchased, and ""Cease-Fire"" in which the MASH camp prematurely celebrates a purported cease-fire which never takes place...

1649977,5,B00005QVVD,"this DVD set is GREAT! ALL the episodes are shown complete and uncut, with scenes that haven't been shown in years, since they've, unfortunately, been cut from the show whenever it's shown on TV to make room for commercials. As a result, all the episodes are shown in their original length of 24-25 minutes. And, the audio and video is so clear, it almost knocks you over! Columbia House realeased the episodes on VHS in the 90s, also uncut, but they were released out of order, unlike these. Also, these have the option to play them with, or without the laugh track-a REALLY nice touch that I wish all TV DVDs had. I'm just hoping that when they're done realasing the entire series, they'll release the spin-offs-""AFTER MASH"", ""TRAPPER JOHN, M.D."" (although, that was considered a spin-off of Trapper John in the movie ""M*A*S*H""), and the unsold plot ""WALTER""-it had Radar as a cop, in the post-Korean war midwest. It was only shown once, and only in a couple areas of the country.

It would have been nice, though, to see some ""extras"" included on the discs.",1113436800,,1060,4.668449197860962
1649978,5,B00005QVVD,"M*A*S*H has to be one of the best shows ever. The years with Henry Blake, Frank, Trapper, and a non-preachy Hawkeye were the best! So, I am partial to the first few seasons. After ""Ferret Face"" Frank Burns left and Charles Emerson Winchester joined the 4077th, things just weren't the same. Whne Kinger stopped wearing dresses, the whole vibe changed. When Radar became more and more ""Gosh-Golly, I'm from Iowa"" rather than the sneaky company clerk he started off as, things went down hill...When Margaret married Donald Penobscott, she changed.

This is a wonderful show, but the 1st 3 seasons are the best out of them all.

Even better, my all-time favourite episode "" Tuttle"" where Hawkeye and Trapper convince everyone that the imaginary Captain Tuttle is a real person.  Every episode has a cracking script, and the cast are all wonderful, especially Alan Alda as Hawkeye and gorgeous Wayne Rogers as Trapper (how I adored him, it broke my heart when he left the series).  And Maclean Stevenson is wonderful as daffy Colonel Blake, and Loretta Swit is brilliant as belligerent Margaret Houlihan, before they made the terrible mistake of softening her character and turning her into a nice, cuddly person (yuk).

1649982,5,B00005QVVD,"What can be said about M.A.S.H. that hasn't been said already? Among the longest running and best sitcoms ever made, it stands the test of time despite its very specific setting. The gags still work, the characters are still wonderful, and the show still enjoyable.
The first season is less serious than later seasons, which were not shy about dropping the gags in order to throw serious topics into the mix. The actors, too, were still finding their tone and pacing during this first season. But still, few shows can match these ""baby steps."" Hilarious from start to finish.
This DVD set is bare bones, though not poorly produced. We get the episodes spread out over three discs (all in a sturdy triple-case) and a small booklet with info on each episode. And that's it. No extras, no commentaries. Just the episodes.
Which is just fine, because the episodes are great. Good, crisp picture far better than reruns, and good sound.

1650006,5,B00005QVVD,"If you pinned me down and forced me to name the greatest show in the history of television, my answer would have to be M*A*S*H.  No show comes close in terms of comedy, yet at the same time few shows can rival the emotional depth, complexity, and power this show evoked over the course of its historic run.  This first season of the show relied principally on comedy for its sustenance, but the roots of this most humanistic and profound of shows are clearly laid in some critical episodes of winter 1973.  I was not quite two years old when M*A*S*H premiered on September 17, 1972, and while I have seen many of the early episodes in syndication, I was basically watching these first twenty-four episodes for the first time.  As a youngster, I didn't like Frank Burns at all, and that kept me from truly enjoying episodes such as these, but now I see that Frank was a very important character who helped make this show such a success.  Colonel Henry Blake is another great character I am now learning to appreciate anew, and Trapper John - well, what can you say?  Trapper was the best, and the timing and rapport between Alan Alda and Wayne Rogers rivals that of Harvey Korman and Tim Conway on The Carol Burnett Show.  The show was never as funny as it was in its early years, and the ability to have these shows in their uncut, original glory is enough to make me thank the gods of entertainment for the invention of the DVD.
One can't possibly speak to every episode's individual quality in the context of a review, but there are many classic, unforgettable moments contained in these first season episodes.  The show really hit the ground running, in a way that let you come to know the main characters by the end of the pilot episode.  There are a few issues and growing pains experienced, but not many.  The character of Spearchucker Jones, the African-American doctor who shared the Swamp early on, was a mystery to me, but I have come to learn that his character (the equivalent of Chuck Cunningham on Happy Days) is a carry-over from the original M*A*S*H motion picture.  Father Mulcahy was played by George Morgan in the pilot, with William Christopher taking over the role immediately thereafter.  Corporal Klinger's initial episodes are quite noteworthy; in episode 4, he briefly appears as a guard dressed in women's garb, but his next appearance in episode 12 finds him getting into a fight with Major Burns and having to be talked out of murdering him.  Even Radar is not the innocent young man he would come to be in later seasons, as he quite often serves as a willing partner in crime to Hawkeye and Trapper.
As for the best episodes, I have to start with episode 8, I Hate a Mystery.  Not only does it introduce us to Radar's teddy bear, it provides some of the longest laugh tracks in television history.  Episode 12, Dear Dad, features the first episode built around Hawkeye's letters home to his father and ends with Santa Claus shimmying down from a helicopter to render aid to a wounded man pinned down in a bunker.  Episode 17, Sometimes You Hear the Bullet, is clearly the best episode of the season; not only that, it serves as a powerful preview to the sense of humanity that would characterize the show over the course of its eleven-year run.  Hawkeye cries for the first time since coming to Korea when an old friend of his dies on the operating table.  Colonel Blake speaks to two of the first things he learned in command school - rule number one is that in a war, some men die, and rule number two is that doctors can't change rule number one.  This episode is also memorable for Ron Howard's appearance as an underage enlistee and for Frank's application for a Purple Heart after he throws his back out dancing with Hot Lips.  Episode 18, Dear Dad ... Again is another terrific episode.  Not only does Frank get drunk and loud, Hawkeye bets that no one will even notice if he were to walk into the mess tent naked.
There are just too many great memories for me to mention here.  Suffice it to say that this is a must-have for M*A*S*H fans and affords us a terrific means for making the show and its timeless themes a mainstay in the formative years of current and future generations.  I would have loved to see any kinds of special features included, but the episodes of M*A*S*H speak for themselves.  This is entertainment at its very best.",1071273600,3,4377,4.539440203562341
1650007,4,B00005QVVD,"MASH is definitely one of the best shows ever produced. After channel-surfing through the wasteland of formula trash and reality shows that makes up TV these days, I'm sure most people will agree with me. Not content to pigeonhole itself into any one genre, MASH works because it feels real. The humour (and delivery of it) feels spontaneous, witty, and irreverent. The drama is believable, and sometimes even tear-jerking without being sappy (at least in the early seasons). And the show takes risks with the topics it covers - I'm sure a series like MASH would be censored to death today by the suits. It's these elements that got me hooked on the show, and that make me continue to watch it over today's television.
While MASH was still finding its groove in season 1, there is still a consistently high level of comedy here. It may be a little wackier and out there compared to the later seasons, but in that sense it's actually more in spirit with the original books and movie (note the blurred, hazy look in some of the episodes - just like the movie). Season 1 also offers a different perspective on the characters, too. Besides Radar being more street-smart, Frank Burns doesn't whine and cry as much, and Henry Blake seems a bit more attentive to things. Hawkeye, of course, is at his womanizing best (the nurses in these episodes were hotter, too - check out Karen Phillip in the pilot).
At first I was hesitant about buying these sets, simply because they're pretty bare bones and I wasn't sure of Fox's release schedule. But after buying them to bring my friend up to speed with the network airings, I'm really satisfied. Audio and video are decent, and its great to turn that laugh track off. While extras would've been nice, it would've meant a 4th disc, and more $$ for each set (most sets put 6 episodes per disc - MASH packs 8). As it is, each set is affordable, the episodes stand on their own without extras, and the episodes are uncut - the extended opening to the pilot is a definite treat for fans.
Season 5 will be released in December, a testament to Fox's commitment in releasing this series. If you haven't picked up these sets yet, there's no better time to start.",1068076800,2,2191,4.577608142493639
1650008,5,B00005QVVD,"The choice - which is beautiful - of not having the laugh track is the best feature of these DVDs - you can hear everthing, including the horrible job of vocal overdubs that are, on such shows as ""Requiem For A Lightweight"", almost obnoxiously bad. The production quality of the vocal overdubs is the only flaw of these shows. Aside from that one gripe, this whole collection makes you realise what the TV ding dongs, to this day, cut out for the reruns. To be able to sit and enjoy these shows uncut without commercials is, in one way, a great paradise for the mind. ""Germ Warfare"" is, until I get the next three seasons, the funniest episode of MASH I've ever seen.

The high points of this collection:  The general's mounting frustration as he searches for Colonel Blake in ""Chief Surgeon Who?"", Colonel Blake's expression after getting blasted in the latrine in ""Cowboy"", and the antics of Hawkeye and Trapper as the dodge inquiring minds in ""Tuttle"".
The only beef with this collection is that there are no extras.  I'll wager they'll save them for the collection of the last season when it comes out on DVD.

1650011,4,B00005QVVD,"""M*A*S*H"" would become one of the classic situation comedies in the history of television, although when it hit its peak it was more properly a dramedy.  But it did not start off as a great comedy.  In the beginning of its first season ""M*A*S*H"" was more a military comedy in the tradition of ""Sgt. Bilko"" and ""Hogan's Heroes""; in fact, writer Laurence Marks, who wrote ""The Moose"" and ""Yankee Doodle Doctor"" of the eight episodes collected on this first video tape for Season 1, was the main writer on the bizarre sitcom set in a German P.O.W. camp during World War II.  Anyhow, on that first season of ""M*A*S*H"" set during the Korean War, Hawkeye Pierce (Alan Alda) and Trapper John McIntyre (Wayne Rogers), spent more time chasing skirts than treating the wounded in the O.R.  But by the last third of that season co-creator Larry Gelbart and producer Gene Reynolds would turn the bawdy sitcom into a legitimate black comedy, arguably the first on television.  You can see the low point from where they started with these first eight episodes from Season 1:
(1) ""M*A*S*H"" Pilot (Writer: Larry Gelbart, Aired: September 17, 1972).  Hawkeye and Trapper throw a party to raise money to send their Korean houseboy Ho-John to a U.S. college.  Notice that one of the Swamp's inhabitants is Spearchucker Jones (Timothy Brown), who failed to survive more than a few episodes.  Grade B+: Despite its faults, this establishes the sense of irreverence towards military authority.
(2) ""To Market, to Market"" (Writer: Burt Styler, Aired: September 24, 1972).  The 4077th needs medical supplies so Hawkeye trade's Henry Blake's desk to a Korean black-marketer (Jack Soo).  Grade C-:  Hawkeye as Bilko is old hat and at this point the North Koreans are comic relief.
(3) ""Requiem for a Lightweight"" (Writer: Bob Klane, Aired: October 1, 1972).  Hawkeye and Trapper are both after Nurse Margie Cutler (Marcia Strassman), which explains why Trapper ends up in a boxing ring facing a really big guy.  Grade C-: Substandard military comedy with no one wondering why Trapper knocks out his opponent without actually punching him.
(4) ""Chief Surgeon Who?"" (Writer: Larry Gelbart, Aired: October 8, 1972).  Hawkeye is appointed chief surgeon and a jealous Frank Burns (Larry Linville) brings in a general (Sorrell Booke) to set things right.  But Hawkeye shows the general a thing or two about meatball surgery.  The first appearance of Corporal Klinger (Jamie Farr) is in this episode.  Grade A-:  You can tell the quality of a Gelbart script from the start and at the end of Act II the show finds its serious voice.
(5) ""The Moose"" (Writer: Laurence Marks, Aired: October 15, 1972).  The first story drawn from actual historical detail, a Korean family sells their teenage girl to be the servant (""moose"") of a G.I.  An outraged Hawkeye tries to get her emancipated.  Grade B: Attention to historical accuracy would become one of the show's strengths and would make it harder to do the standard sitcom stuff.
(6) ""Yankee Doodle Doctor"" (Writer: Laurence Marks, Aired: October 22, 1972).  The army wants to make a propaganda film glorifying the doctors as ""saints in surgical garb.""  However, Hawkeye has his own ideas about what the film should be like.  Grade B+: Another first season episode where there is lots of shtick (Hawkeye as Groucho Marx, Trapper as Harpo), but a totally compelling bit where Hawkeye talks to the movie camera about what war is really all about.
(7) ""Bananas, Crackers, and Nuts"" (Writer: Burt Styler, Aired: November 5, 1972).  Hawkeye is denied a weekend pass to Tokyo and decides to go off the deep end.  Eventually Henry has to send for a shrink (Stuart Margolin).  Grade C+: More shtick, which would come back to haunt the character where he really does crack up in the final episode, ""Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen.""
(8) ""Cowboy"" (Writer: Bob Klane, Aired: November 12, 1972).  A shell-shocked helicopter pilot (Billy Green Bush) becomes violent when Henry (McLean Stevenson) denies him a discharge to go back home.  Grade C-:  Another reminder that there was a serious side to the war and the impact it had on families, but it is hard to take the kidnapping of the bumbling Blake seriously.
Overall this collection grades out as a solid B, purely on the strength of the two scripts each by Gelbart and Marks.  The other episodes just get in the way of what ""M*A*S*H"" would ultimately be in the end and look worse in comparison to what is to come.  Of course, the pilot episode is of primary historical importance, but there are a few nice moments on this first volume.",1053907200,3,4584,4.867268041237113

One strange thing was that Father Mulcahy was played by someone else in the first episode. The strangest thing is the evolution of Radar, who will become more naive in later seasons. I had forgotten that in this first year he drank alcohol and talked about girls, with not too much about Iowa or mom and Uncle Ed.
I have, like everyone else, seen the endless reruns on television. It is SO wierd, and nice, to be able to see the episodes with no commercials and without what I now realize has been some awful editing.
Some of the first episodes are sort of slow moving compared to later episodes.
On this DVD set you can remove the laugh-track, which is, um, interesting to try, though I ended up turning it back on.
On this DVD set you don't get the extras: the how it was made, the interviews, the hind-sight thoughts of producer or actors.

Through the years I watched for it in syndication and watched whenever I could find it on the air.  I got a satellite dish a few years ago and could occassionally find MASH running for a time somewhere.  Then it was gone.  Now, I can watch from the pilot through the end of the season, in order, or in any order I wish; at any time I have 20 some odd minutes to spare.  I usually watch at least one episode on my portable DVD before going to sleep at night.  Good, fun, and sometimes poignant entertainment!  I have ordered season two, and will buy three and any others that are available.  This is a timeless series. There are serious issues tackled in a way that puts them in perspective, but of course there is always the humor.

I even taped it off television and have 246 shows out of 251.  Even so I have anxiously awaited the release of this TV show on DVD.
Now that it's on DVD I am hoping they continue with the entire series.  As for this set, I sat down and watched it from end to end for over 7 hours.  It's simply the best there is, and I highly recommend it to any fellow M*A*S*H fanatic or future M*A*S*H follower.

You can remove the laugh track, which is interesting ... but the shows are usually funnier with the laughs.  A few of the early episodes come off a bit on the sadistic side when viewed without the laugh track - in fairness, it was probably a good idea on the producers' part to include the laugh track on broadcasts.  And you can see the actors leaving space for the track in many of the scenes (especially when McLean Stephenson is talking to Gary Burghoff).
The show actually starts to pick up steam on the second and third discs here.  The show starts to find its own voice, one a bit different than the one in the early shows, which was a clever continuation of the movie with its inherent sadism and misogyny.  The characters start to resemble people under stress, and their behavior becomes exaggerated and direct as a result of that continual stress.  Yet, a real bond exists even between people who are rubbing each others' nerves on a daily basis.  The cast is particularly excellent, and the show develops into something very classic right in front of the viewer's eyes.",1043625600,4,1223,4.625

Excellent quality, the complete first season in broadcast order with the restored scenes that were removed when it went into syndication, and the fine writing and acting that were the hallmark of the series.  And most importantly, it gives the viewer the ability to turn the laugh track off so that we can watch the episodes how the producers originally intended, before the CBS executives insisted that the laugh track be added.  The only thing I would hope that they would change in future compilations would be the ability to play all the episodes on a disk with one press of the button instead of having to go in and restart the next episode when the one you are watching ends.  Otherwise, this is a perfect package.  Who needs extras?",1037923200,5,860,4.5519480519480515
1650054,4,B00005QVVD,"I'm not going to go into too many details about the series.  If you're reading this, you probably already know who the characters are, what the show is about, etc.
The first season (24 episodes) is packaged on three DVDs with eight episodes per disc.  The episodes are presented in airdate order.  The video quality is quite good for film material from the 70s -- far better than the All in the Family DVDs.  The audio is good as well.
As others have pointed out, this DVD set comes with no extras.  The only modification that I make when watching this series is to turn off the laugh track.  M*A*S*H was such a thought-provoking series that sometimes the canned laughter was a distraction; yet funny enough that I didn't need to be told when to laugh.
For the material itself, I give it five stars (I'd even go higher).  For the audio/video quality, four stars and for the lack of extras only one star.  Overall, four stars.  For this price, the lack of extras is acceptable.",1037577600,88,976,4.5
1650055,5,B00005QVVD,"There are very few shows that go down in history as ""classic."" M*A*S*H* is certainly a contender for that title.  I was born only a few years before the show went off the air.  So, I don't remember ever having seen any of these shows on their initial run.  I have seen them all as out-of-order reruns.  I still see new ones once in a while.  I appreciate the fact that the seasons are being released on DVD.  The restorations are beautiful.  The older these shows get, the worse they get on TV, so seeing them in digital is amazing.
The first season is great.  It is nice to see the episodes with the original TV cast.  ""Trapper,"" ""Frank Burns,"" and ""Henry Blake"" who all left early in the life of the series are wonderful. (I can't remember if they left after the second or third season).  This cast is something so very special; their interaction is wonderful and funny.  In the face of the most terrible concept on earth, war, these people make the very best of their time together at the 4077th M*A*S*H* unit.
The first season episodes are hilarious.  The pilot episode is on there.  It is amazing to see how young everyone looks.  There is something very unique about M*A*S*H.* In a time when shows like ""All In the Family""  were on the air, displaying blatantly, their lack of political correctness and intolerance of certain social groups, M*A*S*H* was a model of tolerance and concern for fellow man.  Not to say that it did not harbor its own political incorrectness.  Women were regularly targeted by ""Hawkeye"" and ""Trapper.""  But, that was all in fun.  Most of the time, the young ladies rejected the advances of the pair anyway.
Above all else, the show is ""good"" to watch.  I do not really know of a show has more to say than M*A*S*H.* There is always a moral to the story.  This show really makes one wonder if we really know how much we lose when we go to war, and for what?  Now, I know that this sounds something of a drag to watch, but through all the drama, the comedy shines through brightly.

The big draw of DVD's, in addition to the Sound and Picture Quality, are the ""Extras"". Other than the ability to take out the laugh tracks (Yes!), this has none. There are no cast interviews, no bloopers, no Director's/Producers/Writers Commentary, not even Cast Biographies. Even the insert is rather plan and has nothing extra to it.  The episode description look as though they were written by some one who hadn't even watched the show.  I was hoping for more when the DVD's came out. Like the book ""Complete Book of M*A*S*H"" was not complete in it's fullest sense by leaving out that which would have made it truly complete (the secondary story lines, etc.), this is not complete in the DVD's fullest sense...the extras we've all come to expect in them. In that respect I am disappointed. But I am not disappointed in having a whole season on only 3 DVD's! I am not disappointed in the quality of the sound and picture (much better than the Video's from Columbia House and the Broadcast versions).
For the episodes themselves, M*A*S*H has never been better, more convenient, and funnier (thanks to long edited scenes rarely seen in syndicated TV)!  If you've only seen M*A*S*H in syndication, by this set and hold on to your sides.  They may just split from laughing!",1035158400,4,1466,4.648648648648648

1650060,5,B00005QVVD,"The airwaves of television have been graced with innumerable shows over the years. Some have been wonderful, others duds. And most are just a matter of personal taste. Well, for my money, there was never a better show on TV than M*A*S*H. At its height, the show was irreverant, cynical, a little mean-spirited, and always funny.
The first M*A*S*H DVD is, fittingly, a collection of the first season's episodes. I have long watched the reruns of M*A*S*H on cable, and while these early episodes lacked the polish of latter days shows, they had a bite which seemed to fade away as the series progressed. The first season, I feel, comes the closest to capturing the spirit of the movie.
The cast here is all great. Granted, I think all the emebers of the M*A*S*H cast are excellent, but this group still should be commended. They were the right guys for the job, and all played their parts exceptionally well.
The greatest thing about this DVD collection is that all the shows are uncut. Every episode has about five minutes of footage that is not on the TV reruns and probably hasn't been broadcast since they show originally aired. It's truly enlightening to discover how many great moments are not seen on televised reruns, particularly some of the great politically incorrect jokes. To see the uncut version of the pilot episode is a real treat.
The picture quality is also astounding. It's amazing how great this show can look on DVD. It spoiled me so much, I almost couldn't start watching the shows on TV again, even the ones  not on this DVD.
Overall, it is virtually impossible to find a better DVD value than this collection. 24 episodes, outstanding picture quality, and the uncut versions make this the best DVD I own (along with the second section collection, of course).",1029542400,2,1781,4.745161290322581

1650085,5,B00005QVVD,"If you are or ever have been a fan of M*A*S*H, this is a must-own DVD set. Season One was the best season of the series. This is the season that started one of the most successful series ever made. It ran for 11 seasons, which is pretty good considering that the Korean War only lasted a couple of years.
Why was Season One the best? First, I believe this season best captured the satire that was originally intended in the book M*A*S*H, which was the inspiration for the series. Second, the original cast had the best characters in the series. Trapper John, Colonel Blake and Frank Burns were only around for a few seasons, and here is where they were at their best. The first two were almost adequately replaced when they left, but Major Winchester did little to fill the void when Frank Burns was gone. He was the guy you loved to hate. Third, unlike many other shows, the best episodes of the series were in the first season. You will find yourself cracking up through some episodes and almost in tears through others.
I will not list all of the episodes, but here are some of my favorites:
""Bananas, Crackers and Nuts"" When Hawkeye and Trapper are denied R&R by acting CO Frank Burns, Hawkeye pretends to be crazy so that Frank will have to send him to Tokyo for a psych exam.
""Tuttle"" My all-time favorite. Hawkeye and Trapper donate supplies to an orphanage in the name of the imaginary Captain Tuttle. Tuttle's name gets thrown around, he becomes Burns' best friend, serves as officer of the day, and is honored by a General for his generous contributions to the orphanage.
""The Longjohn Flap"" A pair of longjohns gets traded around the camp on one of the coldest nights of the winter.

There aren't any extras, but the ability to watch the episodes with the laugh track removed almost entirely makes up for this. Giving this show a laugh track was one of the worst decisions in television history. Probably the best example of how much the canned guffaws undercut the episodes is in The Army-Navy Game. In the final sequence, Hawkeye and Trapper much diffuse a shell that failed to explode when it landed in the middle of the camp. The scene is filled with tension, then when they find the next step is to remove the entire tail section there were some mild laughs which destroyed the suspense that had been carefully built up.
The only real problem that I have with these episodes is Frank Burns. Larry Linville did a great job with what he was given, but even by the end of the first season the character of Burns was becoming ridiculous. To remain an army surgeon as long as he did you had to have at least an ounce of competence and/or maturity. Charles Winchester was a big improvement.

1650091,5,B00005QVVD,"I can say, without a doubt, that one my favorite TV series of all-time is M*A*S*H.  For as long as I can remember, it has been on tv in some way or another, whether it's through syndication or during its original run.  To this day, I never get tired of watching it whenever it comes on, even with episodes I've seen at least a dozen times.  M*A*S*H the TV series is based on the movie of the same name that tremendously successful back in 1970.  While the movie humorously showed a lot of the odd-ball antics that went on at the mythical 4077th M*A*S*H unit during the Korean War, it did not have the kind of heart that made its television counterpart one of the most beloved series ever to grace the small screen.  M*A*S*H blended comedy with emotional storylines and strong characters in a way that de-glamorized war, but still honored those that served during it.  That is why I am so grateful that the powers that be a Fox Video have decided to release the entire series on DVD.  Although, I am critical of how long it is taking them to release the individual seasons.
In Season 1, M*A*S*H was still searching for its identity.  There episodes where it seems like its main focus is strictly slapstick comedy with a war background, as in the episode 'Requiem for a Lightweight'.  The pilot episode, while not establishing the emotional background that would define the series, did show flashes of the dry wit that would become a hallmark of its run.  The episode 'Captain Tuttle' is one of Season 1's funniest examples of this.  Later in the season, M*A*S*H began to find it's emotional core with episodes like 'Cowboy' and 'Yankee Doodle Doctor' (A humorous send-up of Army life with an unmistakable anti-war message).  The episode where M*A*S*H truly comes into its own, though, is 'Sometimes you Hear the Bullet' where Hawkeye Pierce has to come to terms with losing one of his best friends and not being able to do anything to prevent it.  That episode showed why Alan Alda was perfect as the central character of Hawkeye.  Though some claim that this role was nothing more than showcase for Alda's vanity, I have to disagree and believe that Alda demonstrated the right mixture of humor, pain, and sympathy in his portrayal of Hawkeye.  He was the anchor around which the rest of the show was built.  In 'Sometimes...' he shows all those qualities.
M*A*S*H would begin to gain momentum and a fervent fan base in following seasons, but Season 1 shows how it all got started.  Fans who are more familiar with later seasons' episodes may notice some things in Season 1 that changed.  The character of Spearchucker Jones was dropped after it was discovered there were no black surgeons during the Korean War; Radar O'Reilly seemed to be a bit more savvy and world-wise in Season 1 than in later years; and, both Hawkeye and partner in crime, Trapper John McIntyre, were a bit more misogynistic back then.  Season 1 is a welcome addition to any DVD collection and now it's up to Fox Video to get on the ball and start releasing the rest of the seasons on a much faster schedule.",1023926400,19,3081,4.6098901098901095

This gives us the opportunity to see the progression of the characters through the years and also see how the writing changed from a mostly comedic attitude to a more serious one. This first set of DVD's is well worth the money and we're looking forward to the release of the other DVD's.
Our only complaint is that the DVD's could not be released at a more rapid rate--perhaps one every other month. With only two or three of these MASH DVD's released per year it will take years to collect all 11 years of the show. That's a shame.
Some of the reviewers here have complained about the U.S. flag (as depicted on the DVD's) with 48 stars. Well, the flag is CORRECT as shown! The Korean War ended in 1953. Alaska and Hawaii did not attain statehood until 1959.",1023840000,,979,4.268817204301075
1650113,5,B00005QVVD,"M*A*S*H was and always will be the best half-hour television has ever seen. Much of my early childhood in Inuvik in the North West Territories of Canada during the 1970s was filled with this show. Perhaps I was too young to watch it, and in fact my parents had seen the movie and decided that the TV series would be too much for our young eyes. After a few episodes they realized that it wasn't as racy as the film, and shortly thereafter M*A*S*H become a household institution. It was also the only TV show about Korea.
It was moral, compassionate, and taught me a lot about people. That I shouldn't care what color someone's skin was, whether they were gay or not, what race they are and that we're all people. It taught me to resent those who crave power over others and respect those who resisted it. I always liked Hawkeye, but I especially liked the minor characters, like Ho-Jon, Ginger Balis, and especially Sidney Freedman, played by Alan Arbus. Freedman was like yet another rock in the series that the other characters could meter their sanity against. Jokes I heard on the show I used in real life. It taught me that war, no matter how noble the cause, is stupid and should be avoided at all costs, by all sides.
So whether you like Hawkeye or Trapper John or Frank Burns, they're all here and more. Despite having seen these episodes dozens of times, I still laugh through each episode. Plus, it's amazing to see how much the current networks cut out of each episode just so they can cram more commercials into a half-hour time slot. Each episode had entire sequences removed- some I had forgotten about, others I barely remembered. It's nice to have them back.
This DVD collection is a must-have for M*A*S*H fans, uh, at least those who have a DVD player. The picture quality is superb- they did an excellent cleaning up the original film stock, and the sound is also quite good. With over 10 hours of viewing here, it's worth the price for the three-disk set. The down side is that there aren't any extras whatsoever- just the 24 original episodes from the first season. No blooper reels, interviews, or photo galleries. It is a better deal than the Simpson three-disk (by comparison) which only has 12 episodes and only a few extras. Still for the price, plus the sheer enjoyment of the best TV show ever made, the M*A*S*H Season 1 DVD is a must have.",1022976000,2,2367,4.5327102803738315
1650114,5,B00005QVVD,"M*A*S*H is arguably one of the best shows in television history.  Finally--they are on DVD!  We love the DVD collections and the ability to remove laugh tracks.  The first season DVD is particularly good.  We only wish, as do many others, that there were more interviews and commentaries.  Even if they were done now with the actors, writers, directors, and producers all looking back...there is a wealth of information that could be included.  We also find it a hassle to navigate around on the DVD and just want to watch all the epidodes in order without pushing lots of buttons.  Regardless, these are nit-picky DVD wishes from one who has grown up in the digital information generation.
The show itself is absolutely hilarious and poignant, all at the right moments.  Alan Alda brings so much to the role, and I am glad he was cast for it.  The other actors are excellent as well!  I'm only sorry we have said goodbye to a few already.
If you are looking for good quality television, with humor and wonderful messages on the human condition, the M*A*S*H season collections are well worth it!  Watch them with your family and friends!",1022889600,,1137,4.720812182741117

So what's wrong with this DVD? Well, it doesn't have ANYTHING that my old VHS tapes didn't have already. The picture hasn't been cleaned (looks grainy), doesn't additional commentary, footage, etc. This is a bit poor considered this is the collector's edition (I haven't seen the non-collector's, though).
However, the DVD has a good price tag. One buck a episode is more or less what it cost to have them on a VHS tape, so it's a very good deal. If all TV shows I love were released at this price, I would buy as many as I could afford. I love M*A*S*H the show, so I'm not really interested in additional material that is not the show itself. Sure, I expect it on a DVD when it costs [...] for a movie, but for 24 episodes of M*A*S*H, I don't need any material that could make the DVD more expensive.
Three single sided DVDs are included. Also a booklet listing the episodes, and a brochure of season 2, being is announced for May 2002.

While some of the plots are farfetched (even the actors complained during the filming of the episode in which Hawkeye & Trapper convince Frank that there is gold in the surronding countryside about the absurdity), each one is funny & poignant in its own way.

When you play this on your laptop in public everybody watches. At drivethoughs, restaurants, traffic jams, in airplanes and even on trains. People will ask you to unplug the head phones so the can listen and watch MASH too. Trust me it has happened. It covers all 24 episodes from the first season on 3 DVDs. It has an optional laugh track, interactive menus, scene selections, subtitles in English and spanish. But once you mastered watching MASH in english, you can listen to them talk in french; even with the accents (great if you are taking french). It includes a pull out booklet that tells the order and which disk has which episodes, and where the chapter stops and starts. The booklet includes a brife history of MASH also. Sure the sound is mono but it is really hard to tell. Another con is if you modify the DVD player to play way to fast sometime the voices and sound will behind the episodes.

1650206,5,B00005QVVD,"When I was in college, M*A*S*H reruns came on at 10:30PM, right after the local news. Religiously, I would watch the news, then M*A*S*H, then study (like I supposed to)...and definitely in that order! Luckily, my M*A*S*H habit didn't interfere with my school work but truly, this is one of my fondest college-days memory. At that time, when all we had were VCRs, I seriously considered attempting to record each show and create my own library of M*A*S*H episodes. Well, procrastination has paid off...in spades! 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment has finally realized that the incredible syndication calls for this show could easily be capitalized on via DVD sales. This (finally) was a marketing stroke of genius for I know, just from reading the reviews here, there are many M*A*S*H addicts like myself.
To get a few credits out of the way, Larry Gelbart deserves the lion's share of the credit for creating an incredibly lasting television series (tough to do these days) from Robert Altman's 1970 big screen offering. However, the missing piece to many of the accolades and praises for M*A*S*H is Robert Hooker (a/k/a Richard Hornberger, M.D.). Hooker penned the M*A*S*H novel in 1968 (his book created the introduction of the beloved characters of Hawkeye, Hot Lips Houlihan, and Trapper John McIntyre. Hooker sold the rights to the book and television show for only a few hundred dollars!). Regardless, we have a cast of characters to thank for this incredible tome of offbeat comedy (although Gelbart still reigns as King).
The Early years....Many of my friends as well as many reviewers feel that M*A*S*H was somewhat inhibited by the presence of Frank Burns and Margaret Houlihan. While Margaret endured the entire run of the show and became an integral character, Frank was eventually removed in favor of Charles Winchester (not my favorite move). At a very basic level, Frank Burns was a focal character in the First Season so I must disagree with my friends and the reviewers. Frank was necessary to create the incredibly funny hijinxs pulled by Hawkeye and Trapper...there just needed to be a fall guy and Frank Burns (played stupendiously by Larry Linville) was perfect. For instance, in the first episode, ""M*A*S*H - The Pilot,"" Hawkeye and Trapper are attempting to raise funds for Ho-Jon, a South Korean boy befriended by Hawkeye and Trapper, to attend college in the U.S. Hawkeye comes up with the nefarious idea of raffling off a weekend with Lt. Dish (played by Karen Phillip). However, before the idea can get off the ground, Henry has to leave the camp to attend a meeting in Seoul and rescinds the weekend passes. Radar clandestinely has Henry (unknowingly) sign the passes before Henry's departure (quick aside...I loved Radar as the sneaky rather than the innocent, gullible clerk). With Henry gone, Frank is the temporary commander and immediately bans any and all social functions. Not to be outdone, Hawkeye and Trapper sedate Frank, wrap his face in gauze, and put him in a bed in Post-Op to hide him from Hot Lips. The raffle ensues only to be cut short by Gen. Hammond (played by G. Wood) and Henry (by the way, Father Mulcahy won the raffle!). Concurrent with the arrival of Gen. Hammond and Henry, Hot Lips finds Frank (when she turns him over to administer a shot!) and brings Frank into the Mess Tent where the festivities are being held. All-in-all, this story and its incredibly hilarious plot would not have been possible with someone like Frank Burns.

1650208,5,B00005QVVD,"I have only the highest praise for the way 20th Century Fox has packaged and marketed TV's MASH on DVD.  Taking the approach of issuing all 24 episodes of the first season together in one set, is the way it should be done.  I hope that this form of marketing is successful, so that other TV programs will be packaged in a similar fashion.
...this set is a bargain compared to most other packaged collections.  You get more than 10 hours of programming, with the episodes presented in broadcast order.  Now you can truly follow the evolution of the series, and the characters from day one.  The transfer to DVD is outstanding.  After viewing countless poor quality TV reruns, one becomes so accustomed to garbage, that the ultra sharp DVD images are bit of a shock at first.
Though the show went through various cast changes, I always liked the original 4077 cast the best.  So having these uncut episodes is a real treat.  Alan Alda, Wayne Rogers and Larry Linville really had a special chemistry.  The same can be said for the relationship between Gary Burghoff and McLean Stephenson.  Can anyone forget the scene when Radar announced that Henry's plane had crashed?  I still get choked up when I think about it.  (No, that episode is not in this set).
Unfortunately, there are no substantial extra features in the set.  The booklet with the DVD has most of its text devoted to listing the credits for each episode, including the chapter stops, which someone has actually taken the time to title.  I don't pay much attention to the titles of chapter stops, so this is kind of a wasted effort.
I'm no MASH scholar, and will leave the detailed ""dissection"" of the series for others.  I will note that the series did feature production personnel, and writers who also worked on my favorite sitcom ""Hogan's Heroes"".  Some elements from that earlier program are also present in MASH.  Also William Christopher, who appeared in a few episodes of Hogan's Heroes, later became a MASH cast regular.  I would love to see Hogan's Heroes released on DVD in a similar fashion.
Don't hesitate to add this marvelous set to your collection.  MASH, the complete Season 2 will be ""incoming"" in May 2002.",1012262400,8,2186,4.690288713910761
1650209,5,B00005QVVD,"It is great to finally have M*A*SH on DVD. And I would hope that most true fans would agree that the first 3 seasons were definitely the best within the entire run of the series.
These are the episodes featuring (among others) McClean Stevenson as Henry Blake and Wayne Rogers as Trapper John. In other words, the truly funny, brilliantly written shows overseen by Larry Gelbart and Co. These were the shows BEFORE  Hotlips turned into Margaret (yawn) and Trapper John and Henry were replaced by the stale, unfunny and overall really boring characters of B.J. and Col. Potter. Frank Burns (who also eventually disapeared) provided a great foil for Hawkeye and Trapper John as is evidenced in these early episodes. It's too bad that by the 4th season the show took itself way too seriously and lost it ""edge"" by becomoing So Politically Correct.  These DVD's remind me of what  great potential the series intially had when the really good writers and the ORIGINAL characters were involved.

The picture quality is great and the sound aint too shabby either. Without that laugh track you are able to hear and catch many subtle things from the actors that were previously ran over by the canned laughter.

But here it is, great quality and in broadcast order!
My /only/ complaint about the DVD is that the menues feel a bit more cumbersome than I think they need to be (select the episode, then the scene and option selections are inside each of those) rather than being a bit more ""top down.""  For example, you should be able to turn off the laugh track or set options from a main menu or something, rather than inside each episode (though those options apparently ""stick"" between episodes).  I'd also like to be able to advance to the next or previous episodes from inside each episode.
It would have also been nice if they would have included some bonus material with it (eg. history, episode summaries on the menu, cast/crew interviews, commentary, etc), but this is still a great value without it.

1650260,5,B00005QVVD,"Any real fan of M*A*S*H who owns a DVD player needs to invest in this set of DVDs, period. If you're like me, and you're too young to have seen (or remember) the original broadcasts, you won't believe what editors cut out of syndicated episodes. Yes, I know there are more commercials now than 30 years ago, so edits must be made, but you could teach a class on editing by showing the stupid (and occasionally smart) editing decisions TV stations make to lose 3-4 minutes per show.
The material is 5 stars, but the video quality is only 3. That's not FOX's fault! This material is almost 30 years old. It's not the pristine DVD pictures we're used to, and it can't be. The producers of the DVD did a great job, but technology can only go so far.
The ability to watch episodes without a laugh track is wonderful. It's true that many parts of M*A*S*H had no laugh track, because producers successfully fought CBS to get the laugh track out of the operating room. But removing it entirely is even better.
Nitpicks: A bit more trouble than necessary to watch without the laugh track, and you must manually select episodes--you can't watch them back to back. Still, for any true fan of the show, owning this [...] is a no-brainer.",1011139200,10,1225,4.497757847533633
1650261,4,B00005QVVD,"In 1972 America was still involved in the war in an unpopular war in Vietnam, which created an environment in which an antiwar comedy like ""M*A*S*H"" could thrive.  The show was set during the Korean War, but the Vietnam sub-text was obvious from the very beginning.  However, what we forget when looking back at the first season of ""M*A*S*H"" was that it was a traditional situation comedy in the beginning and that it was not, from the start, the great show that it became when it hit full stride.  Larry Gelbart gets a lot of credit for creating the series and writing the pilot and the ""Dear Dad"" episode, but that first season Laurence Marks wrote almost as many episodes.  This is of some importance because Marks had been one of the chief writers on ""Hogan's Heroes,"" and there is a sense in which many of these early episodes are more reminiscent of that odd World War II sit-com set in a Nazi P.O.W. camp than ""M*A*S*H"" in its prime (the show was known as ""Hawkeye's Heroes"" in some quarters during that first season).  Of course, the television series was also burdened with toning down the blood and sex from the Robert Altman movie on which it was based.  By this point the original novel by ""Richard Hooker"" (pen name of Dr. Richard Hornberger) was pretty much completely forgotten except for the names and the places.  Today, when you think of ""M*A*S*H"" you think of Alan Alda, who clearly dominated the show from the beginnig in front of the camera and would have a greater effect behind it as the series progressed.
""M*A*S*H"" is one of the 10 best sitcoms of all time, and while I will gladly give the series 5 stars for its entire run, it is simply not that good that first season.  Several episodes, such as ""Requiem for a Lightweight,"" are easily dismissed as standard military comedies on a par with ""Gomer Pyle.""  Alan Alda was always embarrassed in particular by ""Major Fred C. Dobbs,"" where Hawkeye and Trapper are forced to actually keep Frank from leaving.  There were a few worthwhile attempts to deal specifically with the Korean War, such as ""The Moose"" and ""Cease-Fire,"" but only sporadic attempts to rail against the insanity of war, most notably at the end of ""Yankee Doodle Doctor.""  The pivotal episode for the series, written by Carl Kleinschmitt, is ""Sometimes You Hear the Bullet.""  You can say that the idea of a television Dramedy, the perfect blending of drama and comedy in a series, can be traced to this specific episode.  In it, an old friend of Hawkeye's dies on the operating table.  For one of the few times in a television sitcom, a sympathetic and charming character died.  One CBS executive literally demanded of Gelbart and director Gene Reynolds, ""What are you doing?  Is this a comedy or a tragedy?""  The pair stuck by their guns and because of that episode M*A*S*H was able to deal with both the dark and the light side of life, which set the foundation for the series' best episodes.
M*A*S*H was hampered in its early years by the character of Frank Burns, another character in a long tradition of comic characters who are incompetent at some important function.  Frank is an incompetent surgeon (versus Ted Baxter the inept news anchor and Howard Borden the incompetent airplane navigator).  There is a sense in which the greatness of M*A*S*H is defined by the major transformations of ""Hot Lips"" into Margaret and Winchester into Charles, neither of which is possible until Frank is out of the picture.  In the fall of 1972 M*A*S*H aired on Sunday nights at 8:00 EST in between ""Anna and the King"" and ""The Sandy Duncan Show.""  However, someone at CBS decided it was good enough to give it the choice spot behind ""All in the Family"" the following year, and the rest, as someone once said, is television history.  Final Note: One of the nicest things about this DVD is that the episodes are UNCUT.  For example, in syndication, the end of the second act of ""Sometimes You Hear the Bullet"" is used as the tag scene.  Pay attention to the difference when you see the entire thing.
Of course, if you are going to watch the entire thing then you need to start with the first season.  All television shows evolve and that is certainly the case with ""M*A*S*H,"" as Radar O'Reilly becomes more innocent as the show progresses and Klinger and Father Mulcahy are worked into the ensemble.  I think part of the fun of going through this first season on DVD is the anticipation of what lies ahead.  After all, you have to understand the initial antipathy between Margaret and Hawkeye to fully appreciate the longest kiss in television history that comes in the grand finale.

This series is tremendous and having it on DVD is a dream come true. The picture is wonderful and the ability to turn off the laugh track makes it even better to watch.
My only complaint ... is that whomever is responsible for the design of the actual DVD artwork, he/she needs to brush up on his/her American history. Each disc features a character of the show in front of an American flag...one problem, the flag is the 50 star flag used today. During the Korean War there were only 48 states and therefore the U.S. Flag only had 48 stars. The producers of M*A*S*H were able to remember this piece of history when they filmed the shows, but the designers at Fox are apparently just plain stupid.
P.S. The movie version of M*A*S*H has the exact same error all over the design of the DVD's and the brochure inside the DVD.

But the one thing that always wrecked the episodes for me was the canned laughter telling us when to laugh, sometimes needlessly, so I for one am glad to see that in the DVD version of the episodes, you have the option of turning off the canned laughter.
While Columbia House has collected these episodes in their own collection, it was always out of order, and you had to shuffle through the tapes if you wanted to watch them in order. But with this you can go right through the episodes in order.
The best part about collecting MASH on DVD is that the entire collection won't overpower your collection of tapes. Think about it, 12 DVD boxes (if you count the movie in the collection) about the size of a video tape with all of the episodes accounted for, with 8 episodes per disk or 72 boxes about the size of a video tape with 3 episodes on a tape with about 50 or so episodes missing.

I wonder if they'll be doing any of the spinoffs? There were three I think: ""Trapper John MD"" (the best and most successfull spinoff), there was another with Radar as the main character after he goes home, but I forget the title, and of course ""afterMASH"".",1010793600,6,1701,4.335423197492163

Like the late Sorral Brooke who went on to play Boss Hogg on The Dukes of Hazzard. Leslie Nielson who went on to do more comedy roles in such films as Airplane & The Naked Guns films. And future Acadamy Award Winner for Best Director Ron Howard. This is alot better than the Columbia House version. When does M*A*S*H* the complete 2nd Season come out?,1010707200,2,511,4.446808510638298
1650292,5,B00005QVVD,"I've watched the first eight episodes thus far, and I can recommend this wholeheartedly for the casual fan up through the serious fan.
It is truly amazing how much is cut from these episodes when they are broadcast in syndication -- I can honestly say that while I've seen all of the episodes from the eleven years of the series that I have definitely not seen all of the scenes.
Each episode runs about 25 minutes, so about 3 minutes are chopped from each episode when you watch in syndication.
Also, I really enjoy watching these episodes without the laugh track.  I've found it much easier to appreciate the inflection in the actors' voices and the jokes are even funnier when you don't feel like you are being ""forced"" to laugh.
Run out and buy it.  I can't wait for the other ten seasons.",1010620800,11,793,4.5
1650293,5,B00005QVVD,"Quite simply, this is the best TV series I have ever seen. I only saw the last two seasons on their original run, but what I saw impressed me. When the series was re-run in its entirety (I live in the UK) I watched the series from beginning to end and enjoyed it immensely. The characters are well drawn, the stories are well told and its interesting to watch how some characters evolve over the run of the show.
The picture quality of these DVDs is excellent, once again Fox show the way with releasing TV series on DVD. Some have remarked on the lack of extras but I must comment on this.
I watched the series on the BBC - they screened MASH without the laughter track. Although MASH is regarded as a comedy show I have always regarded it as a drama series. A lot of people I know go through life with a smile on their face and trying to find a laugh to make the day go by. Imagine being near the frontline of a war, imagine putting your medical skills to use patching together young men so as they go back into battle again. MASH is far more a drama than a comedy show - I have seen it with the laughter track but the series positively shines without it.
The option to watch this series without the laughter track is an excellent move by Fox and is to be applauded. I believe that this is how MASH was meant to be.
Those who enjoyed the exploits of the Hawkeye, Trapper,Radar, Hot Lips, Frank etc can do so again. Now you have the choice of watching your favourite comedy series or you can watch it for the powerful drama it truly is.",1010620800,10,1537,4.178451178451178
1650294,5,B00005QVVD,I nearly mauled the U.P.S. man coming up the driveway to get my DVD's! I am so happy they FINALLY put the first of the collection out!!This is the best! Now I don't have to wait for the shows to come on at certain times. Just pop it into my DVD player and away I go!! Can't wait for the next set to come out in the spring. Keep them coming!!! Thank you FOX and thank you Amazon for such great service!!!!!,1010534400,,405,3.951219512195122
1650295,5,B00005QVVD,"I am so thrilled that M*A*S*H finally came out on DVD!  It is outstanding!  It is wonderful to watch each episode without commercials, and uncut.  I enjoy the first years, but I think the show gets even better, if that is possible, when Potter, Winchester, and BJ join the cast.  Frank was so predictable, but Charles adds so much pomp and class to the show.  The later years are definitely better, but I'm thoroughly enjoying watching each episode in order.  I think everyone should go out and buy this show right away and enjoy.  I can't wait until May when the second season is supposed to come out!  I plan to keep on buying every season until I have them all.  Hopefully they will release several seasons each year.",1010534400,,720,4.51937984496124
1650306,5,B00005QVVD,"For a MASH fanatic like me this like a gift from heaven. The color is excellent, and the additional material makes the early episodes edgier than they are in syndication. Highlights include more ""Spearchucker"" Jones scenes, a scene in Bananas, Crackers and Nuts, where Burns and Houlihan come up with the idea of getting a psychiatrist for Pierce, and the uncut pilot. The pilot includes the full opening sequence that transitions into the opening theme, and the final scene uncut with a great helicopter shot of Trapper and Hawkeye handcuffed together as they introduce the cast. There are many other examples of material not seen in syndication. But, a word of warning, the second season should have some additional extra features if they want to continue getting a five star rating.",1010534400,,785,5.0

1650308,4,B00005QVVD,"Three Disc collection - all 24 episodes from the 1st year.  Old fans and new will love owning this collection of one of the best t.v. series of all time.  The mixture of comedy with the underlying seriousness of war is creatively handled and between the guffaws, there might be a few tears.  The only reason I gave this DVD collection 4 stars instead of 5 was that there are no special features other than you can turn on or off the laugh track.  Year 2 is scheduled to be released in May 2002 - for for the serious fan, you don't want to miss this.",1010448000,5,549,4.150943396226415
1650309,5,B00005QVVD,"whilst the option to watch this beautifully crafted show with or without laughter may seem insignificant to many i for one am ecstatic.
i come from the u.k. where m*a*s*h was only screened in this country without the laughter track included (the one instance bbc television left it in by mistake there was uproar!).  those of you yet to enjoy this programme without the laughter all i can say is that you are in for one hell of a treat.  the show was never filmed in front of an audience and so the presentation of the show without the laughter is a more accurate reflection of the feel of the programme for both the writers and the actors involved; so many of the subtleties and nuances of the script and delivery is lost by the addition of intrusive 70's-style canned laughter.  hey, we can tell when something is funny all by ourselves!
i can't wait to collect all the seasons...and thankyou for giving m*a*s*h fans around the world the opportunity to enjoy the show as we remember seeing it when screened in our own countries. good work!",1010448000,,1041,4.55614973262032
1650310,5,B00005QVVD,"This first season DVD set is wonderful - The greatest 'bonus feature' the creators of this DVD series has given us is the option to play the dialogue straight without the laugh soundtrack. According to Alan Alda, the cast and crew never liked the canned laughter but CBS insisted on it. The people involved with the show felt the audience didn't need to be told what was funny or when to laugh. Now you can watch these pristine quality episodes as they were intended - Without the laugh track (but for those who prefer it, the laugh soundtrack is also an option).
M * A * S * H  Season 2 DVD is set to be released in May 2002. We're finally getting a DVD collection with the quality it deserves! THANKS!! (Let's hope more classic shows are on the way...)",1010448000,48,754,4.347517730496454

1650312,5,B00005QVVD,"This DVD set of the first series is everything I could have hoped for. The packaging is a sturdy plastic three-disk case and not a card one that'll fall apart over time, and the episodes themselves are presented in screening order with the option to remove the laughter track, the much better option. Inside there's a flyer saying that season TWO should be out in May. Lets hope for some extras on coming sets, there must be some retrospectives out there, or documentaries!?",1010102400,2,474,4.72289156626506
1650313,5,B00005QVVD,"I am delighted beyond description that this series is coming out on DVD !!!  This is my wife's all-time favorite TV show, both because she is a retired nurse, and because it's a sit-com with some real depth to it.  We've just about memorized every episode and we still laugh together every time we watch.
What we've been watching, however, are a bunch of old VHS tapes that we recorded off the TV back in the mid-80s, which range in quality from pretty good to abysmally snowy, depending on what the reception was like that day in rural Minnesota. (No, we don't have cable out here...)  Our homemade tapes are the uncut episodes as aired by a local station, but they are all badly out of order and we are missing a few episodes.  So, it will be wonderful to see MASH uncut, in order, with no commercials and in DVD quality.  I ordered my Season 1 set today and I do hope that the other 10 seasons come out on DVD very soon.  I plan to collect them all.",1009670400,15,952,4.261111111111111
1650314,5,B00005QVVD,"MASH is such a great show and so worthwhile for DVD. Haven't seen the DVD yet but definitely will buy it. Used to be you had to pay 20 bucks just for 3 or 4 episodes on a tape from Columbia House, so this is a great bargain even at twice the price. I hope this means that later seasons and other shows will be forthcoming. The DVDs of TV shows that are available now are so focused on currently-running material. And classic stuff like this is a rarity. Maybe DVD producers and distributors will realize that there is a DVD market beyond what's on TV right now.",1008547200,11,561,4.203703703703703
