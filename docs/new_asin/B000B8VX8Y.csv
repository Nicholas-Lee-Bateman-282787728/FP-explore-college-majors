8083728,5,B000B8VX8Y,"The CD is excellent. The group's music is very serene and meditative. Every song on the CD is great. ERA is an amazing band along with some great videos. I would recommend this CD for those who like soft, comforting peaceful music. If you like the group Enigma, you will like ERA.",1268956800,3,280,4.403846153846154
