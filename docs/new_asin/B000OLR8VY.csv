2797383,2,B000OLR8VY,"I bought the series from Disney before they offered the box set. It was much pricier individually than it is now. If you remember watching this show when it first aired, or even more recently on Vault Disney you might be in for a shock: The sharp image of the original is gone. It has been replaced by the bad decades old colorized version that they used for syndication. When these were colorized it affected the clarity immensely. My question to Disney is: Who do you think wants to watch this show? If it's young kids who won't watch anything in black and white you're on to something. If it's people who remember and love this show already you've missed the boat by changing it. You already have both versions at your disposal. Why not release both so we can decide which one we want to fork our money over to you for?
I'm just saying... My videotaped edition from the final Zorro marathon on TDC looks better than these DVDs.",1205366400,47,930,4.444444444444445
2797384,5,B000OLR8VY,"Great show for any family to watch. They don't make them like this anymore. Just wish Season 2 would be released but if I know Disney it won't happen because they are too busy rereleasing their animated classics over and over and over and over. Case in point: 101 Dalmations, Jungle Book, Little Mermaid, The Lady and The Tramp, Toy Story, Peter Pan, Sleeping Beauty, The Fox and The Hound, Dumbo and the list goes on and on. If they'd do them right the first time they could focus on their unreleased TV shows and other movies.

2797386,5,B000OLR8VY,"The original series with Guy Williams as Zorro set the standard for the character and the movies that have followed.  A charming man who abhored violence in public but secretly changed into the avenger and saved his people from injustice.  Of course then, there was little violence as compared to television or movies of today.  Disney did a great job creating this character and series for television.  I enjoyed it then and thanks to Disney restoring and releasing the episodes on DVD, I can enjoy it all over again.

2797390,1,B000OLR8VY,I watched reruns of this series with all the friends I grew up with. Thing is 3 of them who were younger than me died this past year. I am 62 years old and I can't find anyone under 57 who have ever even seen this Zorro series. Some of them have seen some Zorro series that was on A&E that I never even knew about.  Most of them have seen the Antonio Bandaras Zorro movies. But they have no idea who Guy Williams is. The point is the fans of this old Zorro series are fading fast. Now I have idea who the CEO of Disney is.but someone needs to inform him that Disney needs to release this series at a reasonable price before all it's customers are deceased.,1461974400,4,656,4.046153846153846

But instead they remain in the Disney vaults  while the customers who would purchase them die off by the thousands each month. The Disney CEO must have been born after the release of The Lion King, otherwise they would know that nobody under the age of 50 will ever purchase the Zorro episodes they have locked away in their vaults.

2797397,5,B000OLR8VY,"A fanciful trip back to my childhood to see one of my absolute favorite TV shows.  I never knew how Don Diego's father found out that he was actually Zorro.  I missed those episodes, in fact I missed the entire second season.  Now I know and it was quite satisfying.",1438819200,,266,4.28
2797398,4,B000OLR8VY,"While I was familiar with many of Walt Disneys TV shows, Im sure there are many I hadnt heard of.  For example, I wasn't aware he had done a TV show based on the character Zorro until both seasons were released for the Walt Disney Treasures line.  I just finished season one, and I enjoyed it.

The show is set around Los Angeles in the 1820s.  Don Diego de la Vega (Guy Williams), who grew up here, has been away for several years studying in Spain until he was summoned back by his father.  As he nears the coast, he learns that there is a new Monastario (Britt Lomond) who is trying to grab all the land and money for himself.  Thats when Diego decides to take on the alter ego of Zorro (also Guy Williams).  Only his personal servant Bernardo (Gene Sheldon) knows the truth of his dual identity.  Even Bernardo, a mute, gets into the act by also pretending to be deaf, thereby often gaining some important information.

Now, if you are familiar with current TV shows, you might expect the fight with the Monastario to last most of the season.  Instead, it lasts about a third.  Just as Diego thinks he can retire his Zorro persona, he gets wind of an even bigger danger  The Eagle.  Who is the Eagle?  Who all works for him?  And can Zorro defeat this giant network of evil?

This show really is a serialized story told in half hour increments.  Each episode stands on its own, although they do occasionally build on each other.  Often, there are some smaller arcs that last three or four episodes within the larger arcs.

The episodes mix in a dash of danger with some humor and plenty of sword fighting.  Each episode finds Zorro needing to use his skills at some point to defend himself and save the day.  Meanwhile, Bernardo can provide some comic relief, although that job usually falls to Sergeant Garcia (Henry Calvin), the man caught in the middle of some bad orders but who really does try to do the right thing.  He's not too bright, and his bumbling using helps in the end.

The episodes are fairly formulaic, and this is especially evident if you watch two or three in a row.  That doesnt mean you won't get caught up in the danger.  Ive got to admit I was on the edge of my seat several times trying to figure out how Zorro would save the day.

The acting is certainly good, but it feels just a bit over the top.  Im not saying I don't buy anything I saw here, but it is much broader than were used to seeing today.  This is something you get used to as the season goes along, and it soon becomes a non-issue.

I mentioned the sword fighting earlier.  If you enjoy a good sword fight, youll certainly like what you see here.  There are very few special effects involved, although a few of the things they have Zorro do stretch the suspension of believe, even for me.

The first season consisted of 39 half hour episodes (another way TV was different back then: longer seasons and half hour action shows).  All of them are on the first five discs of this set in full frame and stereo.  The show was broadcast in black and white, so thats what we get here.  Ive got to say, for how old it is, it looks and sounds great.  The picture is sharp and very rarely do I see any issues with it at all.  In the way of extras, we get an introduction from Leonard Maltin on disc one.  The sixth and final disc in this set contains the rest.  There are two of the hour long Zorro specials that aired after season two, plus the introduction Disney did for the character and the show on his Disneyland weekly show.  Finally, there is a documentary on the history of the character up through the TV show.

Ive got to admit Im not super familiar with the character of Zorro period, but I got sucked into Zorro - season 1.  If you enjoy some light action and adventure, track down this set.",1433635200,,3788,4.307365439093484

Guy Williams is a spectacular Don Diego and an even more triumphant Zorro. Henry Calvin and Gene Sheldon appear as inspired players as Sergeant Demetrio Lpez Garca and Bernardo respectively.

2797412,5,B000OLR8VY,"This complete1st season (and the compete 2nd season) were purchased as a gift for my husband.  Zorro was one of his childhood favorites.

Once he opened it he had to put the 1st DVD on, and we sat and watched it.  We enjoyed it so much, so we started watching  3 or 4 installments each night.  It brought back some wonderful memories for him, and we had some wonderful conversations about when he was younger.

This turned out to be one of the best gifts I ever gave him.  And it became an instrument for him to share his childhood with me.  It was also a something we were able to share with our teenaged nephews, to show them, that you don't need special effects and violence to be entertained.  Wholesome G rated TV shows could still be interesting and have a message of good values in it..",1399593600,2,793,4.304054054054054

2797415,5,B000OLR8VY,"I remember watching this series as a kid, and I was mesmerized by the masked man wheedling the Spanish blade. The supporting characters are excellent, and to this date I believe no one captures the essence of Zorro quite like Guy Williams. The town set was very convincing as was the attention to costuming. I hope Disney will re-release this classic which should bring back a reasonable price.",1389744000,,394,4.8088235294117645
2797416,5,B000OLR8VY,"Disney's Zorro series featuring the late Guy Williams was a blockbuster success with critics and public alike. Great sets, fine ensemble acting and the best cinematic fencing in TV history. Some actors appear born to play a role and this is certainly true of Guy Williams . Tall dark and very handsome , his cavalier smile bought charisma to the swashbuckling scene that had been sadly absent since the glory days of Errol Flynn . Unlike most shows of the time , there were ongoing plots that moved through many episodes and allowed more character development. Also available in colorised form from amazon France .",1386460800,,614,4.857142857142857
2797417,5,B000OLR8VY,"Guy Williams WAS Zorro.....no doubt about it. His good looks, speaking voice which matched the character he portrayed, and his superb acting AND fencing abilities, made this series one of the best on TV. Walt Disney never settled for 2nd best on anything.

The series gives you everything: tense drama, suspense, humor, and action unmatched in most TV series at the time. And Lava's Zorro theme still resounds in one's ears, even after all these years since it was first on the tube.

I like the fact that the first season was serialized into several storylines that glued ones' attention, and made one not want to miss next week's episode. The characters in the series: Diego, Bernardo, Sgt. Garcia, the evil Commandante, Corporal Reyes and others helped to ingrain the show into the hearts and minds of the watcher.

This collection is now out of print, but maybe you can get lucky and find it available somewhere......well worth the cost.",1384041600,,941,4.86875
2797418,5,B000OLR8VY,"I enjoyed this series from Disney. The episodes are short but entertaining and feature many actresses and actors who were just starting an acting career, Many featured performers later became well known star.",1382659200,,208,5.333333333333333

2797420,5,B000OLR8VY,"But Gene Sheldon can fill in in a pinch like a champ .

This is, in my opinion, one of the greatest Disney productions EVER and is a great example of classic American television. It was a shame how it went off the air after only 2 seasons.

This was a positive television show that a family could come together around and enjoy the clean humor and fine moral characters presented as the heroes, which is a great contrast to today when the criminals are glorified everywhere you look, people are constantly berated, mocked and humiliated for amusement, and negativity is spewed everywhere on every channel.

It also came with some little collectibles in the tin case, but I didn't intend to leave mine shrink-wrapped for value. It's good TV and it's meant to be watched. I'm halfway through the first season on my 3rd time through the series since I bought it. It really is that good.",1380240000,,883,4.575949367088608
2797421,5,B000OLR8VY,"I'm finally getting back to the last two installments in the wonderful Walt Disney Treasures line. This review is for Wave nine's first release - season one of Zorro. A glorious 6 DVD set that features all 39 episodes of the popular TV series and two (the other two episodes are on season two)of the four hour long episodes that would have been part of season three. There are also a few short features about the program and character.

Each disc host 7- 8 episodes and the last disc features the bonus material. The show looks great even though the opening is a bit grainy which is mostly because it's made up from outside night shots and the over use of these pieces of film.

I wasn't alive when this series first ran, but surely remember the opening from when it was on TV in the 60's Like most of the Disney productions from the era, the show is quick paced and lively and for fans of the series a welcome treasure indeed.

Besides the 6 discs, there is a collector's pin and picture of the series star Guy Williams. For fans of the series this is as good as it's going to get, but after market prices have made this release a pricey investment, you'll have to decide if it's worth the plunge.",1378339200,2,1198,4.339285714285714

For the $227 I would expect it to come with someone to clean my house, do my laundry, shop for and cook my meals and through in a mani/pedi while I am busy watching Zorro! Guy Williams is the best. The movies are great! But at the asking price I fear that no one born after this series ended will ever get to enjoy it. A minimum wage worker would have to work an entire week (after taxes) to maybe be able to pay for this set.

I have a collection of DVD""s and at my age I can only tell my children of many of the Movies from Disney. And the greatest one of all, Zorro , And why I don't have it. Because some family member of Walt Disney has been smokeing some bad stuff or doesn't have enough money , and thinks us old people are going to live forever and can a ford $200.00 to $400.00 and maybe more for the three seasons of Zorro. I know of several familys that would love to have a set. But what thief would Charge so much that other generations of family's will never see one of Walt Disney's greatest shows. And I like so many old people can never a ford Zorro. So my children and grandchildren will never see because of GREAD ,and the Love of Money in the Disney family. All I can say is Mr. Disney It's a shame you can't see what they have done to your Zorro in the name of money. My Children are ages 19,21, and thirty five, and never will know Zorro At those prices.

When I finish cleaning the house or doing the dishes, I reward myself with a couple of episodes of Zorro. (My house is cleaner than it's been in years.)

It also brings memories of DAVY CROCKETT and the adventures of the SWAMPFOX. im watching Zorro season one right now and enjoying every minyte of it. As each episode begins I sing along with the theme song,as I did with Davt Crockett and the Swampfox and enjoying every minute of it. This is a MUST for any one who collects these old movies. There have been many adventures of Zorro in the movies, but only 3 have caught my attention like Walt Disneys zorro. the other 2 were The Mark of Zorro with Tyrone Power and The Mask of Zorro with Antonio Banderas. These were very good ,but not as good as Guy Willams was. Zorro caught fire across the nation,. At Halloween time you couldn't count the little Zorros in Zorros custumes, both boy and girls.

2797437,5,B000OLR8VY,"I'm finally getting back to the last two installments in the wonderful Walt Disney Treasures line. This review is for Wave nine's  first release - season one of Zorro. A glorious 6 DVD set that features all 39 episodes of the popular TV series and two (the other two episodes are on season two)of the four hour long episodes that would have been part of season three. There are also a few short features about the program and character.

Each disc host 7- 8 episodes and the last disc features the bonus material. The show looks great even though the opening is a bit grainy which is mostly because it's made up from  outside night shots and the over use of these pieces of film.

I wasn't alive when this series first ran, but surely remember the opening from when it was on TV in the 60's Like most of the Disney productions from the era, the show is quick paced and lively and for fans of the series a welcome treasure indeed.

Besides the 6 discs, there is a collector's pin and picture of the series star Guy Williams. For fans of the series this is as good as it's going to get, but after market prices have made this release a pricey investment, you'll have to decide if it's worth the plunge.",1326844800,2,1200,4.339285714285714

I too loved and remembered this series when I was a little kid. It, along with Davy Crockett were phenomenons of their time. I agree with all the reviews as to it's quality. Everything Uncle Walt oversaw was darn good to great.

But... the price is really out of line. I mean, $164.95 for a six disc set???? I ask you, is this not highway robbery? I would expect this from Sgt. Garcia and his men, and especially from the alcalde, but certainly not from Disney!  Where's Zorro when you really need him?

2797441,5,B000OLR8VY,"I,m almost 50 years old and this 1957 Zorro series is somewhat new to me. Oh I was aware of its existence, but being a child that preferred cartoons, giant monsters, and space adventures, Zorro was not much of a consideration for me. It was Guy Williams' other series Lost In Space that appealed to me much more. Without going into a lengthy how I suddenly became interested in Zorro, let's just say I suddenly became interested in Zorro. But unfortunately the pricing on these sets kept them out of my reach for a long time. I just couldn't see dropping over a hundred dollars a season just on the nostalgiac opinions of a few people. So I got season 2 first because of it's questionable ""fair"" price of under 60 dollars. So as I watched the episodes I thought to myself this show's good I guess, nothing great, but pretty good. So being the fair person that I try to be, when this Season 1 set was under 80 dollars I jumped at it. Now I know what people are talking about. Guy Williams IS Zorro. Zorro Season 1 is an outstanding show of drama, adventure, comedy, and suspense. In fact many episodes could be edited into several movies worthy of theatrical release. I also want to mention that there are no extra features, but the colorization looks very good. The fun thing is you can watch this whole set in color then go back and watch it over again in black and white by turning off the color on your TV.

Parece mentira que esta temporada, creada hace mas de medio siglo, siga haciendo latir corazones de esa manera, no solo entre quienes, como yo, crecimos viendo todos los dias un capitulo, sino en quienes no habian nacido para la epoca.

Esto hace ver que una buena serie no solo depende de la calidad tecnica, ni de los recursos tecnologicos, sino de la narrativa de un buen guion.

Es la primera recomendacion que hago, porque siento que tengo una profunda deuda de gratitud hacia quienes hicieron posible tanto la serie de El Zorro, como los que la han reeditado en esta nueva coleccion de la primera temporada (hay una segunda, tambien), y la han hecho accesible al publico por Amazon.com

One season one and two in the tins  in black and white and i got one of each season from disney rewards  colorized. One reason I got them  was i didn't sit on my butt and cry about how disney is ripping me off and blan  blah  blah.....This was a Great series worth every penny I paid and more. Takes you back to the good old  days of TV when you didn't have 10 different  C,S.I.'s out  of every city from LV to podunk w.v. ... Zerro was funny at times, and a serious side ,something you could sit back and enjoy instead of whinning about how you are being screwed. Wake up it is 2010 you get screwwed everyday you wake up now,, Deal with it or lose.  I have many of the Disney  collectors tins  from Spin and Marty,  the Hardy Boys, Annette  and so on and worth every penny and more...... If you can find them buy them  they are worth afew dollars more  then you pay for seasons of todays programs.  To everyone complaining about being ripped of then don't buy them duh,  it is your loss  not theirs. My biggest complaint when Disney Listened to the  whiners and cut a big part of Peco's Bill because the cartoon  Bill was smoking a cigarette.........omg  but it is ok to show a have eaten body or a body burnt  to hell  just as long as it stopped smoking before  they took the pics of it  Get a life, change what you can change and deal with the rest .

As for my opinion of these old Zorro TV shows--I never get tired of them. I watch them as DVDs and I have ripped copies for my iPhone and iPod. When I have to kill a little time (maybe sitting in the dentist's office), I watch an episode on my iPhone and I completely forget where I am. I also think Guy Williams was the best Zorro ever.

Anyway, high marks on these, both Season 1 and 2.  At least Disney learned from the SWAMP FOX debacle to release the complete series instead of half a season of select episodes.  Disney Channel's VAULT DISNEY aired these episodes in color some years back now, believe it or not. (The show was originally shot in color, just aired in black and white) Then the Disney Channel went all teenie-bopper and took up permanent residence in Suckville, USA.

2797463,5,B000OLR8VY,"From 1957 to 1959 Walt Disney's half-hour television show ZORRO was so popular that, if Disney and the ABC network hadn't had that legal skirmish, it would've kept on chugging along for a long, long time. I've seen the show off and on ever since I was a kid, but it wasn't really until I saw the episodes on DVD, one after another, that I really appreciated just how consistent and how very good Guy Williams was in his dual roles as Don Diego de la Vega and his swashbuckling alter ego. Guy Williams made it a point to portray Don Diego more as an average, somewhat spineless guy rather than as a swishy fop (you know, guys who tend to sniff perfumed hankies). Williams believed that playing Don Diego as past actors like Douglas Fairbanks and Tyrone Power had had would've eventually become tiresome for the viewing audience, and I think he was spot on.

Although there are a few stand-alone episodes, most of the first season can be carved up into three story arcs, although, okay, the last two arcs share a direct through line. The first thirteen episodes pit Zorro against Capitn Monastario, the sneery, underhanded, yet sort of elegant Comandante of the pueblo of Los Angeles (Britt Lomond was great in this role). It's against Monastario that Zorro would begin to build his legend. To keep it somewhat realistic, Monastario finally does overcome his Clark Kent syndrome and, in ""Zorro, the Luckiest Swordsman Alive"" and ""The Fall of Monastario,"" he figures out Zorro's true identity. In these same two episodes, by the way, Guy Williams gets a rare chance to fight (clumsily on purpose) as the inept Don Diego. The fallout to this is one exasperated evil swordsman remarking to him in their duel: ""You are the luckiest swordsman alive! I have never seen a man so awkward who lived so long."" Heh.

The second arc concerns Zorro's efforts to thwart the secret society wielding the sign of the eagle feather, or to quote a pensive Don Diego: ""And this eagle feather... Why does it spell death for one man and lower taxes for another? Someone has set up a deliberate campaign to spread misery and suffering, and it is up to us to find out who and why.""

Thanks to Zorro, one after the other, the Eagle's minions fall short of furthering the Eagle's goal - which is to sow seeds of discontent throughout California, thus paving the way for an uprising. Finally, with the fate of Spanish California hanging in the balance, El Aguilla himself takes a direct hand, and his appearance comprises a significant part of the third arc. I do think that Monastario in the first arc is the better villain, because the drawn out set-up to the Eagle's finally stepping in just doesn't live up to the actual presentation of the Eagle. Charles Korvin as the Eagle certainly looks very distinguished, with that chiseled jaw of his and that arrogant sense of entitlement. But the Eagle, despite his lofty, lofty ambitions, loses his cool way too often and turns out to be this shrill and petty fella, skilled with a sword but ridden with neuroses.  Zorro has a great good time bedeviling him.

Still, the most hateful character in this season, for me, anyway, is probably that sneering guy with the whip who shows up somewhere in the last third of the season. I couldn't wait for Zorro to teach him a lesson.

Guy Williams is such a terrific Zorro, and he's got that magnetism and flashes that daredevil grin so well. And, boy, was this show action-packed! Disney had gotten masterful fencing coach Fred Cavens on board, and this guy's resume included having tutored both Douglas Fairbanks and Tyrone Power in the past. Thanks to him (and his son) and to Williams' athleticism and flash, the action sequences boast thrilling, intricately choreographed sword fights.

Even though ostensibly a children's show, ZORRO doesn't shy from people getting killed in its episodes, although, from what I remember, Zorro himself doesn't kill anyone in the first season (except that in ""The Unmasking of Zorro"" I got the sense that Zorro doesn't really strain himself too much to save the bad guy who'd just learned his true identity).

ZORRO - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON has the 39 episodes on five discs and it kicks off with film critic Leonard Maltin's in-depth introduction. Disc 6 devotes itself to the following bonus features: ""The Life and Legend of Zorro,"" a documentary delving into the history of Zorro and his many screen incarnations, as well as behind-the-scenes stuff about Disney's Zorro series; the two-part special ""Zorro: El Bandido"" and ""Adios, El Cuchilo"" which was broadcast on the television anthology show WALT DISNEY PRESENTS more than a year after ZORRO had gone off the air - this special features Gilbert Roland as the audacious bandit El Cuchilo and Rita Moreno as a fiery tavern girl; and, finally, a segment from WALT DISNEY PRESENTS's ""The Fourth Anniversary Show"" with old Walt himself introducing Senor Zorro to his mouseketeers. The DVD case arrives in a cool black tin can which also contains a collectible Zorro pin, a black & white photo of Guy Williams as Don Diego, and a Certificate of Authenticity.

The wonderful supporting cast is anchored by Henry Calvin and Gene Sheldon. Calvin is awesome and hilarious as Zorro's fat, bumbling frienemy, Sergeant Garcia, and it's always neat whenever he gets a chance to apply his rich baritone in a song or two. He comes off as a more likable version of Oliver Hardy. Gene Sheldon uses his background in mime to flesh out Bernardo, Don Diego's mute man-servant who pretends to be also deaf so as to better serve Diego when out in public. The production values are lavish, Disney going all out with the huge sets and costumes and ensuring that everything was authentic to the Old California period. In fact Walt Disney wanted to eventually start shooting ZORRO in color, something which the ABC network was reluctant to do, and so began the prolonged legal battle which eventually killed off the series. And, omigosh, the memorable theme song! And the daring escapades and that sense of high adventure and Guy Williams elevating himself to instant superstardom. I am this close to calling him the best Zorro ever onscreen, except that Tyrone Power is so very, very good in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mark-of-Zorro-Special-Edition-Colorized-Black-and-White/dp/B000A9QK8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mark of Zorro (Special Edition) (Colorized / Black and White)</a>.

Leonard Maltin is hardly a ball of fire and has as much screen presence as a sponge. What Disney sees is him is beyond me.

From the ""Out of the night when the full moon is bright comes a horseman known as Zorro"" start of theme song, to the happy ending, these episodes do not disappoint.  They brought back many happy memories of sitting in front of the small screen watching every week with my family and friends.  My first crush, Guy Williams, remains one of the best looking men to ever grace the tv screen.  Others have played the part, but in my opinion, he is the ultimate Zorro.  I'll be getting the second season soon.  Thanks, Disney, for getting this treasure out there for us young at heart folks to enjoy.  I can highly recommend this DVD set.

2797469,5,B000OLR8VY,"Another Collector's Tin release by Disney; this time a limited series of 30,000 were issued. Each contains an individually numbered certificate of authenticity, a 7"" x 4.5"" black and white publicity still of the title character, a collectible pin, a booklet about the serial, and six disks.  This first season release covers the first 39 black and white episodes (there were 78 total) of the series, originally broadcast by ABC during the 1957-58 television season.  Also included are two (of four) 60 minute episodes which were broadcast as part of ""Walt Disney Presents"" in the fall of 1960; these are not in color in this DVD release.

This is a first class release with a nice Leonard Maltin introduction and on-point featurettes.

Made in the style of old Saturday-matinee action-adventure serials; Disney began each episode with a rousing theme song about the adventures of Spanish California's most famous swordsman.  Walt's success with Fess Parker's Davy Crockett miniseries paved the way for this relatively ambitious project.

Out of the night,
When the full moon is bright,
Comes the horseman known as Zorro.
This bold renegade
Carves a ""Z"" with his blade,
A ""Z"" that stands for Zorro.

Zorro, Zorro, the fox so cunning and free,
Zorro, Zorro, who makes the sign of the Z.

He is polite,
But the wicked take flight
When they catch the sight of Zorro.
He's friend of the weak,
And the poor and the meek,
This very unique senor Zorro.

Zorro was a 1820's Mission California version of Robin Hood.  Although fictional (first appearing in a 1919 five-part pulp magazine serial by Johnston McCulley) he bears a resemblance to Joaquin Murrieta, a semi-legendary outlaw who was either an infamous bandit or a Mexican patriot, depending on one's point of view.

Guy Williams plays young Don Diego, returned to California from several years of university study in Spain with his mute manservant Bernardo (Gene Sheldon) to live with his father Don Alejandro (George J. Lewis).  His newly acquired foppish ways are a disappointment to his father.  But playing the wimp is simply an act as he quickly becomes the new champion of the oppressed, donning the black outfit and mask of Zorro and carving a ""Z"" in places that embarrass the corrupt territorial officers and political appointees.

Bernardo and Sergeant Garcia (Henry Calvin) provide comic relief and would be paired a couple years later in Disney's ""Toby Tyler"". Disney sweetheart Annette Funicello does not guest star until the second season. But Season One gave the viewer multi-episode appearances of two of Hollywood's most beautiful starlets ever to grace 1950's television screens; Myrna Fahey playing Maria the barmaid and Sandy Livingston as Don Diego's childhood love interest Rosarita Cortez.

By almost any objective measure Season One is stronger than Season Two.

The film Zorro dates back to Douglas Fairbanks (Sr.) in the silent ""Mark of Zorro"" (1920).  After its initial episodes the Disney entry's format becomes more like the 12-episode Republic Pictures cliffhanger serial ""Zorro's Fighting Legion"" (1939).

I was always irritated by the color bleeding into areas it shouldn't have, especially in the trees.  These transfers are amazing.

2797477,4,B000OLR8VY,"These two Disney Treasures Zorro Season 1 & 2 box sets (tin made in China, DVDs made in Mexico) are well conceived and, together, represent every Zorro episode. The intro frames have more grain than I expected for ""digitally restored,"" but within the episodes the pictures are very clean. The only language is English and the only subtitles are English for the hearing impaired.

I also own the French colorized versions which do not include the subsequent four movies, which the new boxes include at two per set. I happen to like the colorized versions. The opening scenes of the first episode of season 2, Welcome to Monterrey, in color shows the ocean and coast of Spanish California as gorgeous as a postcard. I think that children would prefer the color versions as much as adult collectors prefer the original versions.

In addition to color, the French sets (Amazon.fr) includes the following languages and subtitles:

Season 1:
Languages: English 2.0 mono, French 2.0 mono, Spanish 2.0 mono, Italian 2.0 mono
Subtitles: English, French, Spanish, Italian, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, Portugese, Dutch

2797478,5,B000OLR8VY,"This is my first review because I never feel inclined to leave reviews for anything until now. I have to say that these Dvd's are every bit as good as everyone is saying. Some of the features included are:

- Guy Williams bio. Some of the actors from the show including Buddy van Horn Guy's stunt double talk about Guy.
- Archive of Zorro items with Leonard Maltin and Guy Williams son
- Leonard Maltin introducing the series on Disc One
- Limited to 30,000 copies
- History of Zorro segment tell Zorro's story from his creation to the Disney series.
- Walt Disney introducing Zorro to the Mousketeers

This Is a great Dvd set. I really like the fact that season one has different opening intro's for the show and that season two starting I think on disc 2 has no openings at all. I am not sure if this was how they originally aired but I am used to watching the show when it was on the Disney channel so to see different opening sequences for the show was kind of cool.

In Season two the episode opens with a intro to what the show will be about then a clip that says Walt Disney presents Zorro and then directly to the episode. Could some one tell me if this is how they were originally aired because i miss the theme song but it does not distract from the episode at all. The picture and sound quality are excellent you will not be disappointed with the purchase of these disc. Plus as a bonus you get to see what a great actor Guy Williams was when he wasn't be overshadowed by a boy a robot and a crazy doctor. Also these episodes feature some great work by Henry Calvin, Don Diamond, George Lewis, Bret Lemond, Gene Sheldon and many other great guest stars. Thank you Disney for releasing this great show on Dvd finally. Long live Zorro.

Also I wish Disney would have talked to Bret Lemond, Don Diamond and some of the actors from the show for the Dvd's that is if they are still alive which I think they are that would have been awesome.",1257811200,4,1946,4.265582655826559

2797480,5,B000OLR8VY,"Walt Disney Treasures: Zorro The Complete First and Second Season
(Released November 03, 2009)  A typically long DVD Review by Joe Torcivia.

""Out of the niiiight, when the full moon is briiiight,
Comes the horseman known as Zorro!""

And, out of the latest wave of Walt Disney Treasures DVDs come two amazing sets - ZORRO: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON 1957-1958 and ZORRO: THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON 1958-1959!

As is usual with the Walt Disney Treasures sets, there are introductions and much background information courtesy of film historian Leonard Maltin and loads of extras and special features.  There is even a ""postcard-size lithograph"" and collector pin - a different pair packaged in each of the two season sets.

But, the true ""Treasures"" here are the shows themselves and the actors' performances therein - particularly that of series star Guy Williams!

Relegated mostly to The Disney Channel in recent decades, ZORRO was neither a large part of my childhood, nor did it ever enter into my adulthood.  The last time I can actually remember seeing it was in early evening local syndication in 1965.  The same year that Guy Williams would move on to the role I will forever associate him with - Professor John Robinson, of LOST IN SPACE (1965-1968)

In LIS, he was the ultimate father figure... the one I wish I had.  He was everything famous TV dads Ward Cleaver and Jim Anderson were, but with a laser rifle and spaceship.  He'd ""teach you life's lessons"" while ""saving your life"" at the same time.  ...And he was always there for dinner conversation and needed moments of consolation.

As Zorro, I'm learning that he was even more amazing!  (I guess he's STILL teaching me things!)  His warmth and charm, that only peeked out from time to time (...as he was continually upstaged by kids, robots, ""special guest stars"", pyrotechnics, aliens, and monsters on LOST IN SPACE), is on complete display in ZORRO.

And, was any television star of the time better at sweeping (dare I employ the term ""swashbuckling""?) action than Guy Williams?  I'd say not!  He ran, jumped, rode, and fenced his way into our hearts, our collective consciousness, and television history.

But Williams was far more than a mere action hero.  As Zorro's alter-ego Don Diego De La Vega, he adopts the personality and mannerisms of a foppish dandy and a man of letters to throw off any suspicion that he is secretly Zorro.  He smiles cheerfully at everything, makes pleasant but innocuous small talk (though, often with a deliberate and purposeful undertone) and moves about in a somewhat lithely - but, nonetheless, manly - fashion!  Yes, it IS possible to do this, if you are as skilled as Guy Williams.

Diego's busying himself with scholarly books, poetry, and song, while eschewing any inclination towards ""the active life"", fools both his concerned father and scoundrels alike.  In one superb moment, he DEMANDS that he be allowed to try on a ""black mask and cape"", that the local tyrant is forcing upon a line-up of men in order to identify one of them as Zorro.

De La Vega's request to don the outfit is dismissed, as the tyrant cannot fathom it possible that one such as he might be Zorro.  That's an indicator of the depth of duality that Williams brings to the role of Deigo and Zorro.  So effective is this deception, that no one considers that both Deigo and Zorro sport the same moustache!

Great as Guy Williams was, the supporting cast was just as large a part of the show's success.

Gene Sheldon, as Diego's mute manservant Bernardo, offers repeated moments of inspired pantomime.  Bernardo CAN hear (and quite well) but, as Diego poses as an idler, so Bernardo feigns DEAFNESS, and acts as Zorro's eyes AND ears.

Henry Calvin is a cartoon-come-to-life as Sgt. Garcia.  He is the living embodiment of every large, bulky sidekick ever seen in animation.  He's one of those characters you feel for, because he'd like to ""do right"", but must remain loyal to his commandant.  His comedic talents and hangdog delivery, combined with a surprising ability (for one so large - think Oliver Hardy as a mustachioed Spaniard) to pull off unexpected amounts of slapstick humor, never fail to generate laughs.

Britt Lomand completes the cast of the first arc (...more on that to follow) as the evil Captain Monastario.  He sneers, preens, snarls, and schemes just like all the ""Spanish Oppressor"" parody villains that animation writer Michael Maltese would create to throw at ""El Kabong"" - a Zorro-type send-up ""masked avenger identity"" created for TV's Quick Draw McGraw.

Episode Three (""Zorro Rides to the Mission"") begins with a hilarious exchange between Garcia and Monastario, in which the former is soundly berated by the latter for his (what will become repeated) failure to capture Zorro.  These two actors settle quickly and superbly into their roles of good-natured bumbler and frustrated superior.

Oh, yes... ""Arcs"".  One very unique thing about ZORRO is that it apparently unfolds in ARCS, not unlike many modern TV series.  Highly unusual for the late 1950s!

While each episode has a nominal ""ending"", Zorro does not ""wrap up a case or mission"" and begin an entirely new one next week.  Instead, there is an overall story that carries over a number of episodes.

The first of these concerns Don Diego De La Vega returning from his studies in Spain to find Captain Monastario ruling Los Angeles of Spanish California with an iron (and unjust) hand.  To keep his father safe, as the neighboring rancher has been branded treasonous by Monastario in a play to seize his land and wealth, Diego adopts both his foppish pose and the identity of ""The Fox"" - El Zorro - to vanquish the tyrant. This arc is said to run 13 episodes, before moving on to a new story.

Sampling Volume Two, we also see the beginning of the tale of Zorro's adventures in Monterey.  Though we reach an initially satisfying conclusion in that ""first episode"", here too, things are not fully resolved - leading into the next show and likely several more.

Setting up the anticipation for each episode to come is Dick Tufeld, narrating the (miraculously included) ""Next Week Scene Previews"" with gusto.  Tufeld would later work with Guy Williams on LOST IN SPACE as the voice of the Robot - and in the series' third season would also narrate ""Next Week"" promos in the same fashion as he does here for ZORRO!

Music scores are by William Lava - later of F-TROOP and 1960s LOONEY TUNES fame.

Guest stars to come include Ricardo Montalban, Caesar Romero, Ross Martin (The Wild Wild West), and future LOST IN SPACE co-star Jonathan Harris!

Special features include a look at the life of Guy Williams, with Leonard Maltin and Guy Williams Jr. and, in a separate feature, the pair host a tour of ZORRO costumes and memorabilia (including a run of DELL COMIC BOOKS!) at the Walt Disney archives.

There's a segment of Walt Disney introducing Zorro to the Mousekteers.  Guy Williams makes a appearance in costume and wonderfully handles the subject of whether Zorro is ""real"" or ""legend""!  ""The Life and Legend of Zorro"" (...perhaps he IS both ""real"" and ""legend""!) traces the character from his 1919 serialized magazine debut thru the TV series.

There are also several longer ZORRO programs that aired on the Walt Disney television show, after the ZORRO series was canceled.

Every Walt Disney Treasures set has many things to recommend, but this one is particularly special as it offers the expected quality and features but also presents a series - in its ENTIRETY - that deserves to be preserved and enjoyed.  And, I'm looking forward to continued enjoyment of Guy Williams as Zorro!",1257638400,10,7652,4.859567901234568
2797481,5,B000OLR8VY,"Yes, I have not yet rewatched all the episodes.  In fact, I plan to take my time, to savor each one.  (But, rest assured, should some production problem arise, I will modify this review and lower the stars.)  And, in this season, Don Diego's father does not know and the annoying Eagle is eventually introduced. Here are the first thirty-nine episodes + bonus one hour episodes in their original clearly focussed glorious black and white splendor.  This is great fun, a six DVD set in a nifty tin presentation box with a bonus crossed swords pin(?)for costume parties, I guess.  It is easy to skip over the introduction and go straight to the show.  A great selection for those of us who remember the first presentation and, hopefully, a good choice for the younger set.",1257638400,2,770,4.666666666666667
2797482,5,B000OLR8VY,"I won't bother with a detailed review, others have done it well already. Both the first and second season tins are fantastic! I've been watching them for two days now.

If you are collecting these Walt Disney Treasures, don't waste time trying to get it cheaper on ebay.  The facts as I see them are

1) Only 30,000 tins produced.
2) Six DVD's per tin!
3) $36.99 price comes out to $6.16 per DVD!

This makes it likely the cheapest treasure on a per dvd basis, and I expect when it sells out the cost to find one will be north of $100 per tin!

Get it now if you are a fan and don't want to pad the pockets of a DVD speculator six weeks from now.",1257379200,3,646,4.015625
2797483,5,B000OLR8VY,"With Walt Disney's ""Zorro"" popular television series ending in 1959 after 78-episodes, for its 50th year Anniversary, Walt Disney is giving the classic action/comedy series special treatment with the ""Walt Disney Treasures"" release of ""ZORRO - The Complete First Season (1957-1958) and ""ZORRO - The Complete Second Season (1958-1959).

For the first season, this marks the ninth Walt Disney Treasures release in which a limited amount of DVD copies were printed (in this case - 30,000 were printed) and where the majority of the ""Walt Disney Treasures"" releases were animated releases, these two Zorro releases will be the first to receive an all-black tin case release.

This release contains the 39 episodes from the first season on five DVD discs and each episode has been digitally remastered.  Also, included are ""Zoro: El Bandido - Part 1' which aired in Oct. 30, 1960 on Walt's anthology TV series ""Walt Disney Presents"", ""Zoro: Adios El Cuchillo - Part 2' which aired on Nov. 6, 1960 on ""Walt Disney Presents"", an excerpt from ""The Fourth Anniversary Show"" which aired on Sept. 11, 1957 and ""The Life and Legend of Zorro"".  Included with each release is a certificate of authenticity signed by Roy E. Disney and Leonard Maltin (who personally selected the rare offerings in this set), a publicity still of Guy Williams (who plays the character Don Diego aka ""Zorro""), a Zorro pin (featuring dual swords, the black mask and the words Zorro) and a booklet with episode listings for the first season and more.

""Zorro"" was the first major series that film man Walt Disney was very enthusiastic about.  Ratings were terrific with the first season earning over 35% and the second season earning over 40% in the ratings which is phenomenal but the only reason why the series was pulled off the air was because Disney was pursuing color and ABC wasn't and thus, both ""Zorro"" and ""The Mickey Mouse Club"" were pulled off the air.

The story of Zorro first appeared back in 1920 as part of a silent film starring Douglas Fairbanks. For the next 35 years, there would be several ""Zorro"" related films that were released.  But it was in Sept. 11, 1957 when Walt Disney introduced the character to audiences through the 4th Anniversary show of Walt Disney Presents and four weeks later, Zorro would debut on ABC on Oct. 10th.

""Zorro"" takes place during the time of Spanish occupation of California (pre-1820 before Mexico won independence for California and took control of the state).  Where members of the Spanish colonial government are oppressing the Mexicans and Indians who occupy the land.  Meanwhile, Don Diego de la Vega (played by Guy Williams, ""Lost In Space"", ""Captain Sinbad"", ""Bonanza""), a scholar who trained in Spain makes his return to California along with his mute sidekick Bernardo (played by Gene Sheldon) and to see how people are being oppressed by Capitan Monastario (played by Britt Lomond, ""The Legend of Wyatt Earp"").

Capitan Monastario dreams of being a major leader in Spain but to do that, he tries to rule his region with an iron fist.  Joined by the hilarious, clumsy and portly Corp. Reyes (played by Don Diamond, ""F Troop"", ""The Flying Nun"", ""Rockford Files""), Monastario and his men try to capture those who speak out against him.

Fearing how things have gotten worse in California, in order to fight against Monastario and his men,  Don Diego dons a black outfit and mask and goes by a mysterious hero named as ""Zorro"".

Throughout the series, we watch as Zorro defies the rule of various leaders by helping the people who have been oppressed and not willing to challenge them in a duel.  But as Zorro tries to save lives, those of the Spanish military do what they can to capture the town's vigilante.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""ZORRO - The Complete First Season (1957-1958) - Walt Disney Treasures"" is featured in B&W and has been Digitally Remastered.  The series looks great for a television series that is over 50 years old.  For the most part, the blacks are nice and deep and grays are well-done.  There is a fine layer of grain and occasional dirt can be seen but for the most part, it is limited and I don't see any major banding or compression although the opening theme is a bit grainy.  But for the most part, the episodes look great.

As for the audio, the series is presented in Dolby Digital.  The series is front channel driven and dialogue and music is clear.  For my preference, I watched the series with my receive set with stereo on all channels.

Subtitles are featured in English SDH.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Zorro"" is an entertaining and classic hero-based series.  What made the series so exciting is that Walt Disney was behind the project and that the series was given the opportunity to have a higher production value.  So, you get that feel of an authentic old California during Spanish dominance.  The stories are light-hearted, fun, humorous but also very clever.  The high production values of the series were well-captured as evident in the set, production and costume design.  As well, as the music which helps emphasize the comedic or action moments in the series.

Although I was familiar with ""Zorro"" through the films, I have never seen any of the television episodes.  So, to finally watch them after hearing so much about Guy Williams stellar performance as the swashbuckling hero, I can see why many people enjoyed this series.

I can see how much Disney believed in this series and also spending money necessary to make sure that old California was presented well through the production design, the costumes and also the dialect.  I actually thought that a lot of the people on the show were Latino but later finding out that Guy Williams (Don Diego/Zorro) was Italian, Gene Sheldon (Bernard) and Henry Calvin (who played Sergeant Garcia) were Americans and Don Diamond (Corp. Reyes) was Russian.  But the series was also instrumental in hiring many Latino to have roles in the film, not only for this season but for the next.

Don Diego is the classic hero/vigilante that was created way before Bruce Wayne/Batman and he was a Robin Hood of sorts.  Taking down corruption and even helping out the poor.  He was a hero that many people identified with at the time and have heard from adults who remember those years when they would dress up as Zorro because they idolized him.  Granted, there are man portrayals of Don Diego in film and books but Disney was able to capture that flair of coolness with Guy Williams as the hero and for the most part, he is a hero that truly rocks!  It's been over 50 years since the series debuted on television and watching it, I can see why people enjoyed the series.  It's a well-done, enjoyable and highly entertaining series that captures that sense of adventure, action and tuning in for each episode watching Zorro take on those who would oppress the people, meeting the beautiful women but at the same time, remaining a gentleman.  I'll go even further to say that the show also had cultural impact.

""Zorro - The Complete First Season"" was quite exciting as the first arc on Capitan Monastario was witty and humorous but right after episode 13, it was interesting to see how the series would become a bit more serious as we saw the villainy of Senor Magistrado and also the Eagle starting to take place and people were actually getting killed.  But it worked out in the ratings because people were thrilled by the action-paced series while still retaining the humor.

Overall, if you were a fan of ""Zorro"" or are interested in classic television series, this series is quite fun to watch and I watched it alongside my six-year-old who was also entertained by the series.  The set as part of the Walt Disney Treasures line was pretty cool, especially the black tin case and the certificate of authenticity noting the limited production of the series.  But as a person who does watch classics, it's great to see Walt Disney release one of the highest rated television shows of all time on DVD.  Definitely recommended!",1257292800,12,14172,4.529202841357537
2797484,5,B000OLR8VY,"I just got my 2 package set of the whole of season one and two. I've never written a review before, but I want to try and share how special this packaged set is to me.

All the extras, even the episodes I'd only heard of but never seen that were on Disney's show, all the extras about Zorro, and Guy Williams (my first real love when I was 8 years old). I'd been dreaming of this collection, complete and whole since videotapes came out. And as a child, crying when Zorro disappeared from television, this collection makes that heartbroken child rest at peace at last. (I was so heartbroken, my parents had to call the television station to find out why it wasn't on, just to get me to go to bed.) The extras make this collection a dream come true. :) Thank You So Much Disney Company for Finally releasing this treasure.",1257206400,45,821,4.3311688311688314
2797485,4,B000OLR8VY,"Generally speaking, I do not purchase DVD's of old TV shows.  Experience has taught me that programs I thought were wonderful and really cool when I was 12 years old, usually turn out to be plain awful when viewed through adult eyes.  In fact, there were two of my childhood TV favorites that I simply ""had to have"" when they were released on DVD, for which I never even bothered to acquire the second season, because after 40 years, I found the productions were cheaply done and the plots simply made no sense.

However, when I was only four years old, a show debuted that I remember as a real event in my house.  Not being a member of the Disney Movie Club - I don't even know what that is - or a subscriber to the Disney channel, I had long forgotten the show that prompted my older brother to run around in a homemade mask and black sheet, pretending to be a swashbuckler.  But when I accidentally stumbled on this new release at Amazon last month, something nostalgic inside me told me to go for it, and I am very glad I did.

I received the boxed sets of both seasons yesterday, and sat down for a long evening to see if the shows were going to be as silly as I was afraid they might be.  What a pleasant surprise!  Based on the first seven episodes, the stories are well written, the acting is credible (especially for a 1957 television show) the laughs genuine and the action plentiful.  The stunts and special effects are first rate, and Guy Williams is every bit as charming and handsome as I remembered, even though I was only three when the show premiered.  The prints have been restored beautifully, and there is not a scratch on them.  The opening titles have not been digitally restored, but I can live with that.

I could have done without the intro by Leonard Maltin, who is probably my least favorite movie critic, but the other extras are pretty cool.  The inclusion of the four one-hour Zorro Disney specials is very much appreciated, and the keepsakes - each has a different Zorro pin, a photo card of Guy Williams and a certificate of authenticity - are very nice.  All in all, this is one of the first TV shows I've added to my DVD collection that was actually worth the price, and unlike some other TV shows from my long departed youth, I do not regret the purchase at all.

Recommended.",1257206400,17,2311,4.392018779342723
2797486,5,B000OLR8VY,"I had the luck to watch this DVD set before its official release date, so I can confirm it: it's great. Period. Zorro finally comes back in genuine black and white, with a pristine, spotless remastered picture that's just gorgeous - within the limits of the source material, of course: Pixar stuff it ain't.
The only flaw I could find is, the legendary opening credits have not been remastered and appear rather blurred and overly grainy. Additionally, this is the same incomplete credits that appeared in the early 90's along with the awful computer-colorized version - remember the good ol' days, folks? The show would start with 'Walt Disney presents', the shadow of a fox would appear and become Zorro, carving a cartoon 'Z' in the air, then turning it into a whirlwind with his sword, and only then would the Z-shaped bolt of lightning strike. Why this opening piece got lost is beyond me - but it's still not there. Too bad.
That said, this DVD may seem expensive, but believe me - it's worth every cent of its price tag!",1256601600,4,1027,4.648351648351649
2797487,5,B000OLR8VY,"The Complete First Season is the definitive version that Disney Zorro fans have waited years for. Covering all 39 episodes that comprise season #1 (1957-1958), this limited edition (and numbered) 6-disc set of 30,000 includes a Certificate of Authenticity, a collectible pin (showing two crossed silver swords with Zorro's mask superimposed on top), as well as a black-and-white photo postcard showing Guy Williams in character as Don Diego. A booklet outlining the contents of the set can also be found here. The set comes handsomely encased in a black metal tin, fitting of this B&W series where the hero wears an all-black costume.

A 5:21 intro by Leonard Maltin introduces the episodes and gives a brief history of Zorro and these particular episodes along with the extras on these discs. The remastering is evident on these episodes. The picture is clear and so is the sound; naturally, with the way it was originally recording, a digital surround experience is not possible, but the Dolby Digital recording is crisp, clear, and the score sounds better than it has in years. And no...there are no colorized versions here. Just the genuine black and white originals. The comedy, action, drama, and music combination that one expects from a Walt Disney production is all here, completed with a stellar cast. Guy Williams, Gene Sheldon, and Henry Calvin have fantastic chemistry. Williams' hero Zorro, who is a ""bookish"" Don Diego by day, becomes the black-caped & masked legend who rights wrongs in his ""off hours.""

Besides the 39 episodes (starting with ""Presenting Seor Zorro"", original air date of 10/10/1957 and finishing with #39 ""The Eagle's Flight"", original air date of 7/3/1958), there is a 6th disc of bonus material. Here you will find 2 hour long episodes:

1. ""Zorro: El Bandido,"" original air date of 10/30/1960, from Walt's anthology TV series ""Walt Disney Presents."" Clocking in at 51:10, this episode features Gilbert Roland & Rita Moreno, not long before her breakthrough role in ""West Side Story.""

2. ""Zorro: Adios El Cuchillo,"" original air date of 11/6/1960, from Walt's anthology TV series ""Walt Disney Presents."" This episode is 49:00 long and again stars Roland & Moreno.

An excerpt (3:17) is included here from ""The Fourth Anniversary Show,"" which originally aired on 9/11/1957. Walt is surrounded by the Mouseketeers who anxiously want to hear more about Zorro. Walt finally relents, and the opening from the show rolls out. There is an ""interaction"" between the two sets, where Zorro talks to the Mouseketeers and then engages in a sword fight shown only in shadow (very effective!).

There is also a featurette entitled, ""The Life and Legend of Zorro"" (12:26) detailing the history of Zorro. Starting with the publication of Johnston McCulley's story in a pulp fiction magazine titled All-Story Magazine, ""The Curse of Capistrano"" came out in 1919. Swashbuckler Douglas Fairbanks Sr. was the first to play Zorro in the movies (1920), followed by Tyrone Power over at 20th Century Fox in 1940. Disney purchased the rights to the property in 1952, but didn't get around  to actual production until 1957. This marked the first time that a standing set was built on the Disney lot in Burbank at a cost of $500,000. Disney worked closely on this show to make everything authentic, and made sure it was helmed by a quality team. Each episode cost $78,000 to film and was shot on a 5-day schedule, which was very lavish for the day. Each installment also had original music and scoring written by William Lava. Today, the quality still shows and has paid off handsomely for the studio from its continued fanbase over the past 50 years. The documentary has many technicolor images of Guy Williams and the Zorro cast, along with interviews of Williams' son. Legal battles between ABC and Disney delayed Season 3, which resulted in a few hour-long episodes. It is ironic that one of the top rated shows (garnering an unheard of 40% audience share in season 2) was killed not by the ratings but by legalities and quibbling.

This is a sure-fire set that will please old and new fans of this quality program.",1256256000,79,4131,4.968162083936324
2797488,5,B000OLR8VY,"Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment have announced the Region 1 DVD release of Wave 9 of their Walt Disney Treasures series. Available in limited quantity on 3rd November 2009 is Zorro: Season 1 and Zorro: Season 2.

The latest addition to the celebrated Walt Disney Treasures, Zorro, makes its fully restored black & white DVD debut. All 78 episodes of the timeless classic will be included on two new six-disc sets--making up the ninth installment of the popular Walt Disney Treasures, and for the first time, will be housed in collectible black, numbered unique tin cases.

From 1957 to 1959, Disney's Zorro was one of the most popular series on television starring Guy Williams, Henry Calvin, and Gene Sheldon. The show helped transform the literary character Don Diego de la Vega into the ultimate iconic, beloved swashbuckling masked hero of the time. The adventures of Zorro and his trusty steed Tornado have captivated audiences since their inception, gaining new audiences when it was re-aired on the Disney Channel in 1983 and re-colorizing the episodes in the 1990s. After the series conclusion, the Zorro adventures lived on from 1960 to 1961 on Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color in the form of a four-episode anthology series of hour-long Zorro specials, all of which are also included in Walt Disney Treasures Wave IX.

Both debut Walt Disney Treasures sets are hosted by noted film historian, author and critic Leonard Maltin. Each limited edition, individually numbered volume includes a Zorro pin, an authenticity certificate, exclusive lithograph and comes in a unique, collectible black tin.

2797489,5,B000OLR8VY,"Great series presented in orginal balck and white format. I did have the fist season from Disney movie club which was colorized and contained on five discs. So six discs in this set means extras that I'm enjoying. Found the first season to be as entertaining as I remembered as a boy 50 plus years ago. Masked heroes have always been a favorite and none better than Zorro.
updated 5/10 I have finished watching the final episode of the second season. The story arcs are shorter, three or four episodes in the second season, but none the less entertaining. I must say have a sense of loss - trying to understand why there were only two seasons of this excellent show. I know there was some sort of squabble between Walt Disney and ABC as Walt was trying to move to NBC and color, but this was really an exceptional series and the viewer got the short end of it with the premature cancellation. A wit and a warmth to the characters, great production values, and all the swash and buckle that you could want with the sword fighting and daring do. Anyway, thanks to WD Treasury for bringing back some truly fun and exciting entertainment. I enjoyed it as a lad and just as much as a semi senior citizen.

2797490,4,B000OLR8VY,"I fully agree with a previous reviewer regarding gushing reviews of titles that haven't even been released yet.  There was a time --  a long time ago -- when the only reviews you read on Amazon were for things that had actually been released or published.  Imagine that!!

It's one thing to wax sentimental in public about your childhood memories of a favorite TV show...but it's something else again to write a ""review"" of a DVD set that hasn't even been released yet.  Sure, the show has been around for half a century, but the actual DVD set people are going to purchase with their hard-earned cash won't be released until November...and probably hasn't even been manufactured yet!!  So how can people review something they haven't received yet??

Don't misunderstand. I too was a huge fan of Zorro as a five and six-year-old back in 1957-1959. I even remember the main sponsor of the show in its first season, which I'd bet no one else here does. It was 7-Up soda pop...with its punchy jingle sung by a bizarre, highly excitable little cartoon version of a 7-Up bottle come-to-life. It ran around the screen singing over and over in a high-pitched, speeded-up voice: ""Nothing does it like 7-Up, 7-Up. Nothing does it like 7-Up, 7-Up."" Then it was back to Sgt. Garcia, Bernardo and Don Diego de la Vega.

I'm leaving a rating only because it's required to post this sincere message to my fellow Zorro fans. I give the Disney Treasures version of the complete Zorro series four HOPEFUL stars based on what we all pray will be a terrific DVD set.

If you're smart, you won't purchase this set until you read a couple serious reviews of the actual DVD set when it's released. I've seen a lot of Amazon customers cry the blues when they pre-ordered titles that turned out to be far different than what they'd been led to expect...especially when their expectations were based on other people's fond childhood memories passed off as a ""review"".

2797495,5,B000OLR8VY,"Zorro, a half-hour Walt Disney Productions TV series based on the well-known Zorro character, premiered October 10, 1957 on ABC. The final network broadcast was June 2, 1959. Seventy-eight episodes were produced, and 4 hour-long specials were aired on the Walt Disney anthology series between October 30, 1960 and April 2, 1961.  Don Diego de la Vega (portrayed by Guy Williams) is depicted as a former University student, newly recalled by his father from Spain to his home outside El Pueblo de Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora Reina de los &Aacute;ngeles sobre El Rio Porciuncula (later shortened as Los Angeles). Just before reaching California, Diego learns of the tyranny of Captain Monastario, and realizes that his father, Don Alejandro, summoned him to help fight this injustice. Although he won medals for his fencing back in Spain, Diego decides that his best course of action is to conceal his ability with a sword, and to affect the demeanor of a milquetoast intellectual rather than a decisive man of action. His alter ego, Zorro, operates primarily at night, taking the direct action that Diego cannot. This deception does not always sit well with Diego, especially as it affects his relationship with his disappointed father. In reality, Diego relies heavily on his wits, both with and without the mask on. Later in the series, Diego emerges as a respected figure in his own right, a clever thinker and loyal friend who just happens to be hopeless at swordplay. The character's name in Johnston McCulley's writing and previous adaptations was Diego Vega; the Disney version expands the name to Diego de la Vega, an innovation retained in some subsequent versions of the story. Diego's singing voice is supplied by Bill Lee of the Mellomen.  For most of its brief run, Zorro's episodes were part of continuing story arcs, each about thirteen episodes long. The first of these chronicles the arrival of Zorro / Diego and his battle of wits with the greedy and cruel local Commandante, Captain Monastario. After Monastario's final defeat, in the second storyline, Zorro must uncover and counter the machinations of the evil Magistrado Galindo, who is part of a plot to rule California. The third story arc concerns the leader of that conspiracy, the shadowy figure of the Eagle, revealed as vain and insecure Jos&eacute; Sebastian Varga. Season one concludes with Varga's death.
  Season two opens with Diego in Monterey, the colonial capital, where privately collected money to bring a supply ship to California is consistently diverted to a gang of bandits. Diego stays to investigate, both as himself and as Zorro, and becomes interested in Ana Maria Verdugo, the daughter of the man organizing the effort. Once Zorro defeats the thieves, he enters into a rivalry with his old friend Ricardo del Amo, a practical joker who is also interested in Ana Maria. Ana Maria in turn is in love with Zorro. While in Monterey, Zorro and Sergeant Garcia also get involved in a dispute between the peons and a repressive Lieutenant Governor. Diego is on the verge of giving up his mask to marry Ana Maria, but Don Alejandro talks him out of it. Zorro (and Diego) says goodbye to Ana Maria and returns to Los Angeles, where he gets involved in a series of shorter adventures. In one three episode story arc, guest starring Annette Funicello, Zorro must solve the mystery of Anita Campillo's father, a man who does not seem to exist. Other storylines late in the series involve Diego's ne'er-do-well uncle (Cesar Romero), a plot against the governor of California, an encounter with an American ""mountain man"" (Jeff York, reprising a role from The Saga of Andy Burnett), and outwitting a greedy emissary from Spain.",1242172800,60,3704,4.99837925445705

2797499,5,B000OLR8VY,"Guy Williams' take on Diego de la Vega (a.k.a. El Zorro) was superb!  My parents grew up on this series in the 50's, and they brought me up on it when it was in syndication and on the Disney Channel.

The premise is well known after all these years; a rich young man adopts a costume and a mask to fight injustice and corruption by night, and pretends to be ineffectual, idle, and almost cowardly by day so that no one suspects he is the masked avenger. Zorro inspired dozens of heroes with this concept, just as Johnston McCulley (his creator) was inspired by the Scarlet Pimpernel and Robin Hood before him.

Season 2 makes some changes to the Zorro that Disney fans were familiar with by then. Originally, each storyline played for 13 episodes, as seen in the Monastario and Eagle episodes of Season 1. This caused a problem because if a viewer were to miss one of the early episodes in one of the first season stories, it was possible that they would not want to jump into the storyline midway through. Breaking the season into a number of shorter stories made it easier for viewers to miss a week and still be able to understand what was going on when they next watched the show. Stories were played for what they worth, whether it was 5 episodes, 4, or even just 3.

The first 13 episodes are set in Monterey instead of Los Angeles, and Zorro is mounted on a new horse (he couldn't very well take Tornado with him without attracting attention) and finally given a couple of love interests throughout the season. Bernado, Sgt. Garcia, Lt. Reyes, and even Don Alejandro (after a few episodes) are still present as series regulars, however, and despite the change of scene, the feel of the show is the same.

Cesar Romero got a fun and funny guest starring role as Diego's maternal uncle for four episodes, and watching him play against George J. Lewis (Don Alejandro) provided some of the finest comic moments of the entire series.

Much has been made of Annette Funicello's guest appearance. The story goes that she had a crush on Guy Williams and, as a present for her 16th birthday, Walt cast her in several episodes as Anita Cabrillo, a new arrival in the pueblo with a ""mysterious"" past. I won't cast any dispersions here on the late Ms. Funicello, but I will caution you to take into account that Disney child stars have about the same acting skill now that they did back then.

All in all, it's a fun addition to the first season DVDs, and essential for a complete collection, of course.",1228780800,2,2498,4.513274336283186

2797501,4,B000OLR8VY,"I really loved watching these before the demise of ""Vault Disney"" on the Disney channel.

The casting and characters were brilliant. Guy Williams is the ideal Zorro for me. He's dashing, charming and intelligent. Garcia is good hearted, but still one of the bad guys. If he wasn't always screwing up, he'd actually BE bad. The villans are well chosen and acted and the damsels are beautiful. I love seeing guest stars like Sebastion Cabot and so many other familiar faces.

Can you believe there was a time when you'd get 38-40 full episodes in a single season? Now it's what, 13 to 22? You get a lot of entertainment value when you buy some of these older series.

There is no gory or excessive violence, vulgarity or blatant sex, yet it still holds my attention well. I wonder if I am drawn to like it because it is genuniely good or just so nostalgic for me. I'm sure it's  both.",1223769600,11,882,4.459627329192546
2797502,5,B000OLR8VY,"Disney really hit the mark when they produced this show in the late 50's. It has everything you want in an action show: great action, adventure, pretty girls, a little comedy, and, of course, a sword (or whip) fight in every episode. Good and right always win the day!  The plots are thin, but that doesn't matter.  The production and sheer fun of the show make up for it.  Some of the episodes stand alone, others are in serial format, usually in groups of 3.

There are several things that make this show really stand out. First, Guy Williams is fabulous.  To me, he will always be the consummate Zorro.  He was an accomplished fencer before the show began, and it shows.  The sword fights in this series are absolutely first-rate--Williams had to hold back a little when he was fighting with the bad guys.  Second, Williams had the second most famous grin in Hollywood (after Burt Lancaster, of course). He just seemed to be enjoying everything he did on the show. Third, the Keystone Cop-like antics of Sgt. Garcia and his lancers give the show an added boost--comedy relief.

Disney has now colorised the series.  I don't mind watching shows in BW and am usually bothered by colorisation.  But Disney did a great job and I hardly noticed it had been colorised.  An added bonus is that the viewer gets to see the many colorful outfits that Diego, the Dons, and ladies wear.  I had never realised they were so colorful and impressive.

All in all, it's just a lot of good, clean fun.  Fit for the whole family.
Get it, you'll be glad you did.  It will bring back a lot of good memories and the kids will enjoy it as well. There's enough action to keep today's kids interested.",1223078400,2,1679,4.509933774834437

2797504,5,B000OLR8VY,"I am now watching this series again for the 3rd time in a row--all this summer. I had forgotten how much I loved this show. I watched it when it first aired on TV in 1957-59 as a child and then forgot about it until I recently got interested again by reading the book, Zorro by Isabel Allende. Her book follows the characters I knew in the Disney TV series, so I started searching for more Zorro stories and video on DVD. Shows I used to enjoy watching seem boring. I can't wait for them to get over so I can watch another Zorro episode.

My one gripe is that Disney makes it very hard to get these DVDs. They want you to join their Video club and commit to buying 5 regular priced DVDs within 2 yrs. That ends up being more than $120.

I also happen to know that the Season 2 of Zorro is already for sale in France on DVD but not here yet. I am tempted to order the set with Amazon's French website, but I am too worried that it will be difficult to play the video here since it would be in Pal format and region 2. So I am waiting and hoping Disney will get a US version of season 2 soon.

Update: Since I reviewed these DVDs, I have bought the Disney's Treasures complete sets of black and white Zorro shows. The colorized DVDs were better than anything else at the time, but the black and white DVDs are so much better than the colorized. The detail is HD quality. I really notice the difference on my 52"" LCD TV.",1220140800,,1417,4.07168458781362
