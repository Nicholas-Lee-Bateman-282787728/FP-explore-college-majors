Movies play well on many platforms, animation looks great, and the sound quality/subs are great! Its a great anime that talks about what its like to be a young girl in high school deciding which boy is the one for her. There are some surprising twists and dramatic scenes in the series that makes it a bit more mature than some silly school love triangle.

3564013,3,B001F2U71E,"Meh, This is based on a 20 volume manga and 3 spin off volumes so it's basically a super compact version of the story. Basically at this point any fans have probably like myself grown up and lost interest in the manga which I finished years ago. So I personally did not have any trouble following the plot but if you did not read the manga you will be lost in a blur of events. Basically my thoughts were what's happening, oh wait I remember this part. Background parts of the plot were omitted as I expected for such a short adaption. I wanted the anime to be longer and include more depth.
Overall the animation translates the manga well especially considering the art style of the manga. However it's obvious that the author just wanted to make an adaptation of her successful series. The opening song/animation of the anime is not all that inspired for example. If there were more episodes the plot could actually unfold in a way that has more emotional impact.
I could only recommend this to fans of the original manga. There is no way for a new viewer to pickup the series and enjoy the emotional depth of the original.",1404259200,,1125,4.466019417475728

I tend to see most love triangles as forced and unbelievable but this was not the case with Peach Girl. The circumstances that occurred seemed believable and to fit well with everything going on.

I liked the art style as well, while not like a lot of other anime I watch I appreciated the harsher lines and more realistic look to things. Having Sae go chibi during certain parts added lightheartedness to everything and fit in nicely.

Sadly it was not packaged well and the case arrived broken. The disks are fine but the case was beyond using.",1388793600,,710,4.446153846153846

3564019,2,B001F2U71E,"If you're a fan of soap operas and want to get introduced to anime, this is the show for you. Or if you're a fan of soap operas in general, this is the show for you.

This story is about an insecure, naive high school girl named Momo who is madly in love with a boy named Touji and she is also the love interest of another boy named Kairi. Her love life faces many problems mainly due to her narcissistic rival, a manipulative girl named Sae. Due to constant swimming and being a lifeguard, Momo's skin is permanently tanned which is a source of ridicule for her from the other classmates. Rumors spread, sides are taken, and boyfriends are stolen. Yeah, you get the picture of how this anime goes. It's a messy roller coaster ride of misunderstandings, hidden romances, deceptive people, and indecisive, jealous guys and gals. Soap opera to a 'T'.

That is the norm for Momo and the boys she juggles her feelings around all the while trying to overcome Sae's lies and schemes.

I watched this anime because I was bored and wanted to see something new. It wasn't bad at first, but I was dreading continuing it because it was all too mushy and I'm sorry, downright ridiculous. Three episodes in and I was wondering what I had gotten myself into. I peeked back in 13 episodes later and it didn't get much better. I've never seen so much flip-flopping in ANY relationship. Not even in American soap operas. (Though I never care for them.) The two most evil people in the show, Sae and Kairi's older brother Ryo, never even get a proper comeuppance. Insults and few slaps on the face? Seriously? (Momo is also slightly dense and a little too forgiving of Sae.)

I give this anime points for its beautiful animation and voice acting though. (I was shocked at how strangely pronounced the characters' lips are. I don't think I've ever seen such designs in many anime shows.)

Like I mentioned before, if you like soaps and mushy romance, go ahead and pick this series up for yourself. If not, pass it up. You'll be saving yourself some money and sanity.",1378598400,5,2047,4.521621621621621

3564027,5,B001F2U71E,"Peach Girl is about a girl, Momo, struggling to fit in and find love. She has major insecurities about her look as she is deeply tanned (an unappealing trait in Japanese culture) and more brawny then most girls. Her differences are made worst in comparison to her so called best friend, Sae, who is fair skinned and petite. Sae uses Momo insecurities to her advantage and does everything in her power to make life difficult for Momo. Thing come to a head between them when Momo starts falling for a guy, Toji. Toji and Momo  start falling in love and that is where the series gets interesting. Sae, to spite Momo, start turning everybody in school against Momo particularly Toji. Momo has a surprise champion in Kairi, a carefree boy that harbor deep feelings for Momo.  Momo soon becomes torn between Toji and Kairi.

The anime is about self discovery, trust, redemption, and hard choices in life. It does deal with adult themes so probably not suitable for young ones. While it can feel soap opera-ish at times, it true does have a captivating story line. I would strongly recommend this series as it was satisfying (it has a true end that wrap up all the main plots unlike some anime) and the story moved on quickly - no dragging parts causing viewer to become frustrated because the plot is not moving forward. Overall, a good price for a good anime!",1364083200,2,1354,4.609958506224066

3564033,4,B001F2U71E,"This has to be the ultimate shoujo manga so i feel I must write about it. A very popular manga by Miwa Ueda; in 1999 it won the Kodansha manga award for shoujo manga.

Although, I never read the manga, I did watch the 25-episode anime. The story is about a high school girl named Momo Adachi. A lot of people criticize her because she has very tanned skin and bleached out hair. They think of her as a ganguro*** girl. This is not true since Momo is part of the swim team and that is how she gets tanned (also she has skin that tans rather quickly).

Since junior high Momo has always liked one of her classmates Toji who she thinks is a very nice and open minded guy especially since he sticks up for her when other guys are trying to refer to her as a promiscuous girl(because of her unintentional ganguro look).

The only close friend Momo made in her class so far is Sae, a very a manipulative girl who happens to look innocent. Sae has absolutely no self esteem. She is very jealous of Momo and will do anything to be like Momo from buying the same hair clip to a purse to even the same boy.

Momo's life gets even more complicated when she meets a senior student at her school named Kairi Okayasu. Kairi really likes Momo. Since Kairi has a reputation of being a ""playboy"" Momo never takes his feelings for her seriously and also she only has eyes for Toji.

Sae's jealousy level rockets and Sae decides that she has to do anything she can so she can have Toji for herself. First, Sae spreads nasty rumours about Momo throughout the school even a rumour about how Momo is cheating on Toji with Kairi.

During all this turmoil, Momo has nobody except Kairi, who knows what a nasty person Sae really is, and always tries to cheer up Momo when she is down.

While watching the anime, I started to get really upset because Sae was really making me angry (lol); she was such a big time crazy liar...but I decided I really do like the anime because there are so many twists in the story line and has a lot of character development. You never know what will happen and who Momo will end up with. Although, I'm not a big fan of the artwork, the story does make up for it. It's really a page turner (or a wanting to sit at your computer all night and watch the anime).

***Ganguro (copied and pasted from wikipedia:) In ganguro fashion, a deep tan is combined with hair dyed in shades of orange to blonde, or a silver gray known as ""high bleached"". Black ink is used as eyeliner and white concealer is used as lipstick and eyeshadow. False eyelashes, plastic facial gems, and pearl powder are often added to this. Platform shoes and brightly-colored outfits complete the ganguro look. Also typical of ganguro fashion are tie-dyed sarongs, miniskirts, and lots of bracelets, rings, and necklaces.

The deep ganguro tan is in direct conflict with traditional Japanese ideas of feminine beauty. Due to this, as well as their use of slang, unconventional fashion sense, and perceived lack of hygiene, ganguro gals are almost always portrayed negatively by the Japanese media.",1357257600,3,3068,4.464285714285714
3564034,4,B001F2U71E,"I suppose that I should start out saying that I have wanted to see this series in the past but didn't know if it was worth spending money on. At the low price that it is now, no reason not to.
I was extremely surprised about how much I did enjoy this series. It is probably more of a 'girl' flick, Although, the humor and sensitivity would be enjoyed by everyone. I found myself intent on what was going to happen next.
The characters are incredibly well developed. I won't blow it but one of the guys is what we girls have always wanted. At least, I have. This is a romantic series with several twists and turns. I felt myself at times to be unsure of how to feel about them both. The guys are both good candidates and I think the one she chooses is the right one, just because of how he has always been there for her without hesitation and without being selfish.

3564036,4,B001F2U71E,"Peach Girl is a good series. It's definitely meant for girls. That doesn't mean that a dude can't find it entertaining. Emotions don't have sex boundary. Momo is a high school girl who has a crappy best friend and 2 really cool guys that want to date her. Her best friend is determined to make her life hell. This anime explores her relationships with both of her guy friends and the decision she makes on which one to become lovers with. Momo is a great character. You really feel for the troubles she encounters, and want her to be happy.

The animation in this series is pretty good. The voice acting is as well. I've always liked Cherami Leigh. She's not the main character, but she's great. The soundtrack in this is also very fitting. It's a very drama and it keeps you wanting more. I highly recommend it. Especially to a younger teenage audience.",1350432000,9,854,4.509677419354839

Just like the books, the show is very similar and plays out the same for the most part. It is a really cute, funny, and entertaining teen soap opera. With so many twists and turns, it keeps you watching until the end. The main character Momo is torn between two lovers and quickly finds herself in a love triangle between Toji and Kiley. In the end, she is forced to choose which one she wants to be with. If you are a fan of animation, cartoons, or high school drama, then you will love it!",1313020800,,626,4.139344262295082

Many girls here are extremely competitive - and one will stop at NOTHING to take another boy away from her best friend. They gossip about their best friends constantly.

Having only a few boys on this campus, they think they are God's gift to the world (and they are not, unfortunately).

To sum it up, the characters of this show are very immature, but that is how most teenagers are. Fun to watch, but gets crazy at times.",1312848000,,568,4.299065420560748
3564043,4,B001F2U71E,"The drama feels sometimes a bit forced and melodramatic, and a few characters needed a little more ""dimension"" to them (i.e., is Sae selfish, sneaky, and evil ALL the time?). However, midway through the series, things started picking up a bit, even if it was a really weird scenario of blackmail to get things going. Towards the end, the viewer gets used to the characters and the show becomes as addictive as a daytime soap (or nighttime sitcom). That the show is 26 episodes had me worried since I'm used to shows that are at least twice that length, but in this instance I think the writers did a good job of editing and putting everything neatly for the allotted time. If the writing had been a tad bit sharper and less ""rushed,"" I'd have given it a higher rating. Ironically, I was a bit bored by the slow pacing of Strawberry Panic's first half of the series, but felt this show flowed too fast at times and wished they had expounded upon certain situations.

The animation looked alright; it took some getting used to and there were some choppy sections here and there, but did not affect the enjoyment of the series. What helped was the use of slapstick and character expressions. Additionally, the two theme songs are cute and the Japanese voice actors were good. I think if the animation was better, I'd probably rank it a bit higher.

I was wondering where this series had gone to. For a moment, I thought the rights to distribute it in North America had expired (and Amazon went ahead and deleted all previous versions of the series on dvd). So, who would I recommend this for? I'm definitely not the average viewer for this sort of programme. I'd say this is more apt and fitting for the intended audience of ""tweens"" (e.g., the same kids who watch Degrassi: The New Series, iCarly, and such). There may be a few situations that require some explanation, but the overall subject material in this show is inoffensive and tame.",1302912000,,1938,4.598265895953757

3564045,2,B001F2U71E,"It's one of those anime love dramas that just makes you want to yell out ""just say it already you ST*PID B!""

However, that won't happen because then the story will end too fast. I admit that the anime is addictive somewhat, but on the second watch especially, it becomes a little too unbearable due to the following:

1. That everything is so conveniently or incontinently (however which way you wanna think of it) setup to create MORE drama and frustration.
2. Everything could be easily resolved if they stop being shy and modest with each other. If they were more direct and resolute, this anime would have been a half episode series.

This anime has a fun-to-watch factor in it, but it can be very disheartening and extremely annoying to watch as well. This is the third time I've attempted to watch the series over again, but I can't find myself getting too far into it without wanting to smash one of their faces in.

I would advise watching Hana Yori Dango anime in Dubs (they have a decent dub). At least the story is more amusing and you won't always be plagued with extreme situations of pure frustration. Why watch something that makes you want to ruin your computer or tv screen?

If this is how love is, especially in Asian countries, then I wanna be a monk and get out of the dating world PERIOD. Watching this anime gives me the urge to shave my b.....

That Sae character (the backstabbing b...), I wish there was someone like that in my life, because if she did that to me, it would only take a day for me to finish it. I'm pretty sure there are people like that out there. I never got a chance, however, to meet someone as tricky, determined, witty, and cunning as she is.",1293667200,,1691,4.421221864951768

They didn't change keypoints of the story. The onyl difference I could think of (bear in mind, I haven't read the series in a couple years, buy I have a good memory) is that Kiley is Kairi. But that probably has to do with the translation with the whole ""R"" and ""L"" thing. Also, if you've read Peach Girl: Sae's Story, this anime will make you want to see an animated adaption of that. Unfortunately, there isn't one yet that I know of, but I know one thing for sure: if they make it, I'm buying it!

The storyline is about one high school girl & two high school boys caught in a love triangle where the main character has to endure the happy & passionate moments, including the hardships & pain, towards both guys. The decision this main character makes will decide which guy to dedicate her love for. The plot is of a romantic genre but it is very exciting to follow. The way guys behave around girls, including perverted guys, makes this anime series hilarious but the pain & burden from relationships also makes this anime series very depressing & sad.
Anime fans will appreciate the production quality & powerful storyline integrated within the wonderful & beautiful plot. A great anime to have & watch with loved ones. This anime is too emotionally powerful for children but all anime fans are required to watch this anime series. The beautiful scenery, wonderful compassion, ballistic betrayal, & hearts being tortured/mended will definitely pull a heart string or two.
The voice acting by Funimation is well developed & continues to retain the emotions & thoughts of the characters. The dialogue is normal for a high school romance & presents a beautiful yet powerful escalating plot that results in a domino effect for the events of the anime series.
I recommend this anime series to all anime fans.
Thanks.",1287100800,,1494,4.956175298804781

I would sit there when something was happening thinking the whole time ""you idiot!! all of this would be SOLVED if you just opened your mouth and said something from the start like you really should do to begin with. haha! This anime is so full of drama it's crazy. once you think something is solved someone comes along to toss a wrench in things and everything goes amiss before it's all sorted out. It's defiantly not a series to take seriously! The drama is over the top and not really real to life but if you just realize it is to entertain you then you can get over those things and really enjoy it. The characters are really zany and you get to feel aggravated, and relieved, and different emotions for their situations. I was not too crazy about the way it was drawn at first. They are not the typical style of most anime you see; it (to me) resembles the American wanna-be anime shows that you can see floating around. I don't think any of it bothers me really except that the artist draws in this distinct upper lip on all the characters...it looks weird....and at some times when they have their mouth shut I would see that lighter colored upper lip and think it was their mouth open! ha! You get used to it though as you watch the anime. For me it's sorta like playing a really good game with really good graphics and then going back to playing an older console- the game is still pretty good but the graphics are not all as good as the other and you notice it at first, but as you watch it you get used to it and into the story and everything about it that you do not notice.

In any case, it's a typical Shoujo anime. There is a girl and some guys and drama hah! It's a decent show and worth your time if you like anime. Though I would also recommended checking out To Heart which has almost 0 drama compared- just friends and no backstabbers XD. Also, Kimi Ni Todoke (From Me to You) and that is a cute anime that might interest anyone (it is in Japanese only with subtitles).",1279843200,,2059,4.2126582278481015

3564053,4,B001F2U71E,"A series that shouldn't be taken seriously. Peach Girl tells the story of bullied Momo Adachi and her love for the popular boy in school Touji. Things get complicated when Momo's ""best friend,"" Sai, makes her life miserable and tries to steal Touji for herself. Momo's only friend is playboy Kairi who begins to fall in love with her.

The series is charming and although it is over the top, it's pure entertainment and has a strong message of friendship, forgiveness, and love. Fashionable character designs, nice music, and entertaining plot, this is a great show for people who love just the right amount of cheese and just the right amount of charm.",1254960000,,653,4.778761061946903
3564054,5,B001F2U71E,"I'm a 49-year-old SF writer, who prefers spec-fic anime, but I just loved this silly little soap opera.  I tried it just on a whim and fell in love with it.

Momo is such a great character.  She's well-meaning, desperate to be accepted, madly in love with a guy who barely knows she's there, touchingly vulnerable, and at the same time tough, given to bursts of anger, even violent when she thinks she's being attacked--very much, in short, like a real teenage girl, although I'd expect more of this over-the-top melodrama in the US than in Japan.

Sae is, admittedly, a little hard to believe--is anyone THAT single-mindedly evil at such a young age?  But she just does it so well, such a perfect portrait of a sociopath in action.

And I love how Kairi, who starts out as a sex-crazed opportunist, decides to help Momo and Toji just out of pure altruism, and is happy when they finally reconcile despite having wanted Momo himself.  Don't tell me teens are never altruistic.  They may never be CONSISTENTLY altruistic, but I believed Kairi could act the way he did in real life.

The school ostracism of Momo due to Sae's lies and staged confrontations is harrowing, but by episode six we have a happy ending, and from there on it's just more soap opera.  But those first six episodes are enough to redeem the series for me.  They should make a full-length movie out of them and release it theatrically.  I'm serious.  Just snip the intermediate intros and credits and the summaries and previews, and the length would be perfect.

It has a little something for the teenager in all of us. Best suited or teenagers and above age wise. Some parts would not be appropriate for a younger audience.",1232668800,2,378,4.338028169014085
3564057,5,B001F2U71E,"This show is a lot of fun to watch.  I've been watching anime for nearly 10 years now and this is one of the most enjoyable things I've seen in a long time.  Initially I didn't think I would like Peach Girl, I gave it a chance because I was bored, and I ended up loving it.  It's not for everyone, as the target audience is adolescent girls/young women, but I think anyone, male or female, with an open mind could enjoy this.

Peach Girl is full of drama, drama, and more drama.  The first 5 or 6 episodes alone are a roller coaster.  That said, you'll also find yourself laughing from time to time, when they introduce a bit of slapstick.  And although the situations and relationships are exaggerated they're all based on reality making just about everything a relatable experience.

The main characters in this series are very well developed, and some of them even show noticeable progress and growth as the story moves forward.  Most characters are very easy to love, while others you'll love to hate!

The character designs are nothing special, though the main character Momo remains visually interesting because she's constantly changing her outfits and hair.  As far as the actual animation goes - it's passable, but it won't blow you away.  That said, you'll probably never notice since this is really a more character driven show than anything else.

The English dub is very good - I actually like it better than the Japanese version.  The voices fit the characters perfectly and sound natural and smooth (I think Sae really steals the show here!).  Some of the side characters sound a bit stilted, but they never say more than one or two lines before disappearing anyway.

Peach Girl is an emotional roller coaster with some great characters, crazy love triangles, and a ton of drama.  When it was all over I found myself wishing for more!",1230249600,2,1849,4.674922600619195
3564058,2,B001F2U71E,"This anime, is horrible. Everything from the art, which is mediocre sometimes, to the story. It's like a soap opera, that goes just completely nutters. It's like a train wreck...you just can't turn away. There isn't a lot of anime out there that is oriented at females, so i guess i like that about it. But this show is just silly. Momo starts out this totally loveable girl, who just tans really easy so everyone thinks she's a slut. So, having no friends, this totally evil Chick named Sae, befriends her. But Sae doesn't really like Momo and trys to steal everything from her, from the things she likes to wear to boys she wants to date. And episodes 1-7 are actually very entertaining, and still believable. The first part of the show is like, an excercise in bullying to the extreme. Then after that it's just implausable drama after implausable drama. Yes, there is a love triangle, and mostly i stuck it out to see who Momo would pick, but just about everyone in this series undergoes a complete personality change half-way through so that the drama can continue. It's amazing that Momo doesn't off herself, with all the crazy crap that happens to her in this show. I think the best part about this show is the accidental humor, it takes itself so seriously and is so poorly executed it's hilarious!
