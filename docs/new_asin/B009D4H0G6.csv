5317406,4,B009D4H0G6,"This is the second film I directed for MGM when I was under contract to that studio in the early sixties so , of course I will neither critisize nor praise it Here.
Granger was fifty years old then and a huge star and I was all of 29 and only directing my third film .
He was a difficult actor to work with but an accomplished pro! It took me about two weeks of shooting before he saw who was the boss on the set and from that day for the next fifteen weeks all went well and he was very nice...

5317408,5,B009D4H0G6,"I got this movie because I saw it on tv for the first time, and I absolutely fell in love with Stewart Granger who played the starring role. It has everything you want in a classic movie. Romance, adventure, sword fencing, and a handsome leading man.

5317409,3,B009D4H0G6,"Steward Granger was always one of my favorite actors.  I enjoyed his roles in King Solomon's Mines, The Wild North, Scaramouche, The Prisoner of Zenda, Bhowani Junction, North to Alaska and others.  But this wasn't one of his better movies and it may not have been his fault at all.  Movie studios have been known to coerce actors into taking roles that they don't want to take.  Directors have been known to royally screw up a movie.  This was a B-movie: unbelievable story line, weak supporting cast, and  Granger himself just looked tired and jaded.  I saw on a biography webpage that he once said of himself, ""I haven't aged into a character actor.  I'm still an old leading man.""  I think that said it all.  I just wasn't able to get through this movie.  My opinion.",1360195200,,771,4.554744525547445

5317411,4,B009D4H0G6,"A good family entertainer from an era gone by. Stewart Granger has stunts and sword fights galore, with a sweet but devious love interest, starting with dislike of each other to their appreciating each others values and falling in love.

5317412,2,B009D4H0G6,"I usually like the swash-buckling, sword-fighting action movies of the past, and Stewart Granger was great in Scaramouche, so I had high expectations for this flim.  However, the supporting cast was weak, story-line thin, and even Stewart Granger seemed to have a difficult time with his role in making us believe he was truly invested in his part.",1353024000,,348,5.0
5317413,4,B009D4H0G6,"I first learned about ""Swordsman of Siena"" some twenty years ago through Jeffrey Richards' ""Swordsmen of the Screen"", and I've been wanting to see it ever since.  I thought that, perhaps, the print had been lost, since until this DVD release in September 2012, I'd never found it on Turner Classic Movies, on VHS, on LaserDisc, or on DVD.  This is all to say that my expectations were pretty high when I finally viewed the film.  I'm happy to say that I wasn't disappointed!

""Swordsman of Siena"" is a fine swashbuckler, with all the elements of a successful entry in that genre: action (one of the best rapier duels I've seen, and I own more than 80 swashbuckler films -- in addition to the dueling, the film climaxes with a thrilling and perilous horse race through the streets and countryside), humor (Stewart Granger is the equal of Errol Flynn in delivering witty riposts), romance (this nicely played by both Mr. Granger and Miss Sylva Koscina), gorgeous costumes and sets, and a clear delineation between good and evil (Riccardo Garrone as Don Carlos, along with his henchmen, provide suitably menacing villains).

In my experience, this is certainly the best of the ""Spaghetti Swashbucklers"" done in Italy with a mixed English and Italian cast.  The lips are in synch, and the Italian actors are very good and deliver their English lines convincingly.  The plot is good, though the film is fifteen or twenty minutes overlong at 96 minutes.  Still, there's so much to enjoy that I didn't find the ""Swordsman of Siena"" to have overstayed his welcome.  By the way, the print looks pretty clean and bright, especially for something shot in EastmanColor, which quite often has bequeathed faded prints.

I'm just a nudge away from giving the film 5 stars, but I certainly recommend it unreservedly to swashbuckler aficionados, and to fans of Mr. Granger's work.",1350086400,43,1863,4.885714285714286
5317414,5,B009D4H0G6,"At MGM, the high-adventure genre went out with the Fifties and Stewart Granger's status as contract star went out with it. After a few years of freelancing in Europe, he got a chance to swashbuckle once more -- in a French/Italian co-production distributed by MGM -- and the result is to be relished as an exemplary entry in the genre, capped by arguably the most exciting horse race committed to film. Throughout, director Etienne Perier applies a light touch, all the more apt since the Alec Coppel/Fay & Michael Kanin script keeps the witticisms coming fast and furious. Granger does an impressive amount of his own stuntwork and is as deft with a rapier as ever. Romantic sparks fly between him and Sylva Koscina from the get-go but Christine Kaufmann, as Koscina's maidenly younger sister defies ""bland."" Fausto Tozzi, the assassin in ""El Cid,"" is up to his usual villainy. Throw in atmospheric period settings and you're setting for a rollicking good time, even if composer Mario Nascimbene's main theme sounds disconcertingly like ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes""!",1469404800,,1065,5.056818181818182

5317417,3,B009D4H0G6,"I really wanted to like this movie.  I'm probably being more generous as I write this because I still want to like it.  This was made at the latter part of Stewart Granger's career. It was filmed in Italy with what appears to be an Italian and a French director and financed by MGM.  That's what happens late in your career with a genre that has played out its hand.  High points: Its in color.  Instead of a Hollywood back stage you get real Italian scenery which is simply striking.  To its credit there are a couple of plot twists one of which I called at the beginning but was still cool and another that I never saw coming.  Despite being too old for the part, Stewart is, well Stewart.  There is good old fashioned sword play.  Not so high points: The dubbing is distracting, really distracting.  Some of the support cast is noticeably flat.  There is a race at the end that is supposed to explain why a population is being held down but doesn't.  If I had already seen it, I would not have bought it as I don't plan on seeing it again.  If you are a hard core swashbuckler fan and have seen everything else, then I guess it would still be a buy.",1453075200,,1152,4.229357798165138

5317422,5,B009D4H0G6,"While I 'm reading the biography of actor Stewart Granger (1913-1993) I 'm wondering why author Don Shiach rated the Swashbucler film
Swordsman of Siena a ""second rate "" and "" Nevertheless it is an entirely forgettable film"". Viewing this film several times , it is for me impossible
To agree with the above opinion. Further the author continuous to write: "" It is doubly dislikeable because Granger was beginning to show his age
,but is still behaving on the screen as though he were in his twenties and convinced of his ability to conquer any woman who comes into his orbit"". Trying to be as honest as possible in my judgement , I state that Granger 's last Swashbucler film is completely on the equal artistic level
With the more famous Swashbucler films Scaramouche and Prisoner of Zenda . The only difference is that Stewart Gtanger looks older ,but at the same time more experienced,when using his sword. The plot for the modern age viewers might be ridiculous ,but we have to remember
That the action takes place in the 17 century Siena , where treachery was common and hiring a gallant Swordsman as a body guard for the future bride was taking place very often. In addition sword actions are excellent as is the climax involving the horse race was deadly and outstanding. Both ladies Sylva Koscina as the Lady Orietta and her younger sister ,played by Christine Kaufmann are playing their parts well. The supporting actors Siena's cruel overlord Don Carlos played by Riccardo Garrone , Captain Hugo , Don Carlos sadistic cousin ,played  by Fausto Tozzi and others are all outstanding. In sum it is an excellent and an entertaining movie. Highly recommended.",1438992000,5,1665,4.801393728222997

This is a good swashbuckler, with plenty of sword play and the climax involving a horse race was different. Grangers character has a subtle tongue-in-cheek ability to toss our comments and insults that poke fun at his targets.

The print is very good and the colors are excellent.  This was a good movie but I don't put it in the class of Grangers other features (Scaramouche and King Solomons Mines).",1410739200,4,559,4.57

5317443,5,B009D4H0G6,"Warner Archive has dipped into its MGM coffers and has released Director Etienne Perier's 'SWORDSMAN OF SIENA' aka 'LA CONGIURA DEI DIECI' -1962, a surprising coupling of romance ,tragedy and derring do packed into its 96 minute running time.  Hollywood star Stewart Granger never looked more dashing harkening the days of his Beau Brummell/Scaramouche roles and just coming off Director Robert Aldrich's production of 'SODOM AND GOMORRAH' would remain in Europe doing costume and espionage films.  Helping him along is the statuesque Sylva Koscina coming off her Steve Reeves/Hercules films and the beautiful Christine Kaufmann showing her naivety and fragility coming off her role in Director J.Lee Thompson's 'TARAS BULBA' with husband at the time, Tony Curtis.  Peppered throughout are excellent Italian character actors including Claudio Gora, Alberto Lupo who has a great sword fight with Granger, the gorgeous Marina Berti and the always excellent villainy of the great Fausto Tozzi.  The film centers around an excellently edited and photographed horse race which was a real event at that time and serves as the climax to the romance and treachery which ensues.  There appears to be two different versions of the film: an Italian version directed by Baccio Bandini and this one which was a French/English language version but looks as though they are identical for the running times are the same on both.  It also boasts great credits for this type of production. The music score is by the wonderful Mario Nascimbene who graced Director Richard Fleischer's 'THE VIKINGS'- 1958 and would go on to other memorable scores including Director Don Chaffey/Ray Harryhausen's grunt and groaner 'ONE MILLION YEARS B.C.'-1967. The photography is by the great Tonino Deli Colli who worked with Directors Mario Bava and Sergio Leone among others. Director Perier would have a sporadic career of writing and directing culminating in 1971's release of 'ZEPPELIN' and the underrated Alistair McLean film 'WHEN EIGHT BELLS TOLL'-1972.  Click the add to cart button and enjoy a European dash of action which should be right up there with the over blown Hollywood opuses of their day.

8540046,5,B009D4H0G6,"I wanted this movie in my collection for two reasons. First, i'm a big Sylva Koscina fan. She played in classics such as Hercules; Hercules unchained; Deadlier than the male; Agent 8 3/4; and so many more. She's lovely as ever in this great classic Italian action adventure which is a rarity. And second, i love period piece dramas and those classic Italian films were so inspired and inspiring to watch! I recommend it because it's a very well done period piece wih beautiful settings; locations and costumes. Stewart Granger was very well known for his sword and action movies acting at the time. What i like about those ancient movies from another era is that they really are from another time but are still highly effective. You don't see movies like that anymore and it succeeds at entertainment and mostly allows you to enter a forgotten world by plunging you into what seems to be a realistic journey into old time period dramas. With old style romance, it does the job. You never can escape the hairstyle cuts or 50's, 60's allure of the actors/ actresses and feel that those movies were made at that time, but as the same thing happens to actual modern movies, at least you have a feeling of authenticity while watching ancient period films like this one. I had the same sensation while watching other great movies such as The Barbarians (with lovely Helene Remy, who also starred in The Vampire and the Ballerina); The Queen of Sheba; Hercules (Steve Reeves and Koscina); of The giant of Metropolis for example. All those classic films seem ""out of this world"" and are great to watch for this reason. There really should be an interest at releasing all those peplums; sword and sandal or period dramas on blu ray, because we would really discover for the first time the powerful impact of their classic ""savoir-faire"".
