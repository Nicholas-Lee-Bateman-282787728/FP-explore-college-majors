8322424,5,B001MYIPZ0,This is a beautiful and well-done documentary of the worldwide efforts of THE HABITAT FOR HUMANITY to build housing for people who need it.  It so happens that President Jimmie Carter who is seen throughout the film has been influential in forwarding the work and even in his 80's he was in there banging and sawing and putting in long days doing the construction himself.  I loved the DVD because it shows the real heart of real people taking action to help each other make a better world.,1460160000,,490,4.556818181818182

Few non-profits have US-based and international projects.  Here you see the great work that Habitat does in Brazil, the Philippines, as well as New Orleans and New York.  Those receiving houses have to also work on houses, so this is not what conservatives can dismiss as ""getting a free ride.""
The work is diverse in terms of gender, class, and race.  I must admit that it had few young people.  I wonder if the unsafe work of house building is meant for adults only here.  Though my mother admires him greatly, many people in the 1970s thought Carter was a poor president.  I heard that more people watched Reagan's inauguration than they watched Obama's; that's a sign of Carter's unpopularity at the time.  This work does not touch his days in office; it focuses solely on his Habitat work.
I did wonder how they kept things safe.  There seemed to be a lot of dangerous tools around that I would only hand to skilled construction workers, not volunterrs no matter how dedicated.  This work didn't answer if Habitat had ever been sued by maimed volunteers or anything.
Again, I loved this documentary and seeing all the good that Habitat does.  But there will be some viewers that think it's too gushy and praises the former president far too much.",1240704000,,1465,4.75098814229249
