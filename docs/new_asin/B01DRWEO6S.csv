7723077,5,B01DRWEO6S,This is one of the best series PBS has had on TV. I anticipated every episode. My children got this set for me as a Christmas gift so I can watch it whenever I want. I will cherish it for a long time.,1477612800,8,200,3.6744186046511627
7723078,5,B01DRWEO6S,"With all these different versions of running times and edits. I am glad I waited for the series to end to purchase The Complete Series. I don't know what is missing or not.

I am enjoying this series. The discs play finethe first episode is over an hour each.around 9 minutes over. Not sure what the original running times werebut episodes run close to 50 minutes.

Enjoy Everyone if You had decided to purchase! Great price too!",1477267200,25,429,4.558441558441558
7723079,1,B01DRWEO6S,"I love the series, but having trouble finding the individual episodes. When the dvd boots up, it just shows season #1, no individual episodes are listed on the main screen, menu button does not work, the only way I can move on to new episodes is using the fast forward button, is this a defect??? None of the dvds in this set show individual episodes, like on Amazon Prime. I am going to start watching on amazon prime, I may return this set............",1477267200,37,453,4.469879518072289
7723080,2,B01DRWEO6S,Very disappointing. It leaves out the scenes that were unique to the PBS broadcasts and doesn't even have the deleted scenes that were included in earlier collections.,1477094400,55,167,5.222222222222222
7723081,2,B01DRWEO6S,"Being a devoted Downton Abbey fan, I'm turly disappointed to find out that this is the edited version. Scenes have been cut & deleted from some of the episodes! The running time is shorter than the recent rerun I've watched on WNED. Since this is the ""COMPLETE COLLECTION"", I expect to get the complete version of each episode which sadly not the case with this release. I'm just glad I haven't spend more money on the limited edition collector's set because it contains the same discs. If this is the original full length edition, I'll give it 5 stars & more!

A fellow viewer imformed me that the one I saw on WNED/PBS(The Downton Abbey Marathon) is an extended version. This set indeed contains the original UK edit(Please Note: EDIT) for UK broadcast which happens to be the shorter version. I stand corrected.

My question is why not release the full version for all the fans out there to enjoy?",1476835200,115,900,4.61875

This set contains ""over five hours of brand-new bonus video"" for a total of over 13 hours of extra material.  I started watching the 6th season today and haven't looked at the extras yet.

7723110,5,B01DRWEO6S,"I am sorry to see the I only have 4 episodes left to watch. I have thoroughly enjoyed this series  much to my surprise. The attitudes, respect, limits, keeping one's opinion to one's self, sometimes short yet sharp criticisms, clothing, protocol, expectations of maintaining control and ones' place in society, an interesting look into servitude, trust and friendship, courtship. I loved Carson, Mrs. Hughes, Mrs. Patmore, Anna, Daisy, Alfred, and James; all below-the-stairs employees. I also admire the very opaque Lady Mary. She feels no need to explain herself! The Dowager (played by Maggie Smith) has some fabulous lines, ""Vulgarity is never suitable a substitute for wit."" A great series! Enjoy!!!!",1530748800,,705,5.351351351351352

I just bought the complete series because I remembered hearing about this series constantly on TV and by celebrities. I am so glad I didn't have to wait years inbetween the seasons - I started watching episode one and couldn't stop. I didn't go anywhere and stopped only to sleep a bit now and then. It is lush, lovely, real, tragic, funny, and historical. Beauty of language and costumes and scenery. The characters are flawed but endearing. It is astounding in every way.  I am now coming out of its spell to present time, but left with a better appreciation for that period of time in a lovely country that tempered harsh divisions with principles, kindness, and manners.

7723150,2,B01DRWEO6S,"I've looked at other critical reviews, and they all seem to be based on the DVDs themselves.  I would like to complain about the CONTENT, endless melodrama, particularly with Bates and Anna, by which the promise of the beautiful first season is destroyed.

I saw it all more or less as it appeared on PBS.  Unless you have a more regular life than I do, watching TV each Sunday night is, however, rather catch as catch can.  But I managed to see it all, perhaps not always in order.  Subsequently, I saw more or less all of it again, although more chaotically.  Lately, I ran out of anything to watch and decided to have another go, starting at A and proceeding straight toward Zed with all the media in hand.  I already had Season One so I bought seasons two and three.  I was well aware that the charm of the thing faded for me as Julian Fellows and his team struggled to make fresh magic as the seasons progressed.  Particularly, I was thinking about Bates and Anna and how tiresome their business became.  PARTICULARLY, Bates's warped code of personal honor that always prevented him from doing anything much to save himself from the wretched schemes of others.

I thought maybe I could enjoy three seasons before Bates got me down.  I also knew that there was a sad point where the problem of dried up creative juices was addressed with a platoon of new characters.  What really surprised me was that I couldn't get past the first episode of the second season before the angst of Bates shadowy past again reared its ugly head, this time in the person of his wife.  Bates was an appealing character when he stuck to his knitting as Lord Grantham's valet, but even in the first season his melodrama was tiresome.  I am sure it reveals a flaw in my own character, but I get angry with the creators of something I care about when they make a mess of it.  I need to be more respectful of shows that close down in what seems like their prime.

The first season established such a great cast of characters with all of them animated by believable circumstances, all of them interesting and capable of being cared about.  They were so much creatures of their time and, in that sense, it was very educational about the human dynamics of the class system of the day.  It was quite noticeable, for example, how mean the servants were to each other, gladly being enforcers of the rigid system that kept them all down.  And the ugly competitiveness between Lady Mary and Lady Edith, who were both in need of a man, was brilliantly brought to life.  Sibling rivalry -- one of the oldest stories of all -- in a particular social context.  But the endless Bates melodrama is just rubbish.  I guess I will try to keep watching for a while, but I will make good use of my fast forward control and just pick and choose among the story lines that I wish to follow.  Funny how I was previously able to get though it all carried along on the momentum of Season One, but now -- having had a lot of time to let it all sink in -- I just can't bear the rubbish parts.  And the later part of the series is more rubbish than art.  I am shocked to realize how soon it goes south.",1523750400,,3154,4.367066895368782

The changes they see in the little- over 10-years of time this series covers.  The fun part is how you start off really disliking some of the characters (Thomas Barrow) and you see how they change into different people and you're rooting for them in the end.  Another aspect I enjoyed - they tied the series up beautifully in the last episode.

Those history making events didn't impact Downton Abbey in a head-on manner, but as both the upstairs family and downstairs servant played their roles in the household, they were touched by what was happening around the world.",1518652800,4,519,4.6923076923076925

7723213,1,B01DRWEO6S,"""Downton Abbey"" contain the thinnest pieces of writing and story ever, in my memory, to become as ""popular"" as it seems to have become.  Note that this popularity seems to come from female viewers, as they are politically, culturally, spiritually, artistically, and intellectually less equipped to discriminate between what is good and what is awful.  I know very few men who could tolerate this production.

What ""saves"" it (to the extent that it was salvageable) is the photography, the settings, and the costumes.  Photography, settings, and costumes are a dime a dozen in the media, so there is little left to make this production valuable after a viewing of one or two episodes.  Everything is repeated with different camera angles throughout the rest of the series.  This is an indirect confirmation of the female incapacity to discriminate the good and the bad, and enforces the idea that females can only see the surface of things, and can go no deeper.

""Downton Abbey"" is merely a production that is designed to produce enormous money for the makers of the series in that it caters to and appeals to everything that is now ""fashionable"" and ""politically correct"" to talk about.  If it did not adhere to this line as closely as it did, it would never have been allowed to go on the air.

The fashionable line is now for every bit of history in our Western Civilization that we know of which exalts great culture, art, spirituality, class structure, morals, and manners is now deemed by the ""progressives"" to have  been entirely wrong, i.e., classist, sexist, racist, etc., etc .  According to these progressives, everything in our past Western Civilization must be thrown out and replaced by a rebuilding of society based on what is fed to us by the progressives.

But it must be kept in mind that the progressive movement is engineered by people who are seeking to destroy every vestige of our past civilization and replacing it with their own ideas, in order to dominate every facet of our lives.  It is a drive for pure power, driven by a minority of people without art, spirituality, morals, and manners; an uncreative minority whose only true aim is the destruction of everything around them.  The label they have put on themselves as being progressive is the great delusion they have managed to convince everyone of that what they do is true and good.

In ""Downton Abbey,"" the beauty of England in its art, architecture, class system, spirituality, moral, and manners, is brought into ill repute and we are led through season after season of the characters coming to an ""awakening"" to the reality of every belief they have held has been wrong.  Like it or not, they must submit to the ""demands of history"" by changing their minds on everything they held dear and get ""in tune"" with the modern world.

We witness the fall of all that is good in England throughout the series, while the production keeps telling us that the changes are all for the good.  For instance, one of the female characters ""breaks away"" from the ""stuffiness"" of Downton Abbey and goes into London to establish a fashion magazine!  This is supposed to show her independence and freedom of thought.  What a cliche!  Everything on the screen and in books now, from the soap opera ""General Hospital"" to the movie ""50 Shades Darker"" all portray women finally achieving independence and strength by heading up a fashion magazine!  The writers of all this nonsense are really giving us the opposite of the message they thought they were sending, i.e., they are saying that women are only capable of getting along in the world by working for, or, preferably, being in charge of a fashion magazine!  (Never mind that the fashion magazines are really an excuse for the ""progressive"" Leftists to further their destructive views on every subject known to man.)

One of the most noticeable pieces of idiocy on the series is the raising of the servant class to those of tolerant, caring, law-abiding, common-sense people of good and pure heart, and contrast them with the un-caring, unscrupulous, intellectually fatuous ""snobs"" peopling the upper crust of Downton Abbey.  As the series progresses, we see the upper crust snobs coming to assimilate the values and ""true humanity"" of the servant class, and welcoming them into their world with open arms, realizing that the lower classes possessed the key to human kindness and experience all along, and the upper classes were in error in being so slow to accept that realization.

If you want the truth about servants, read some books about life in the 1700 and 1800s about upper class life, and, almost without exception, the people writing (all superior people in all aspects: intellectually, culturally, artistically, socially, etc.,) all assessed the servant class as being dishonest, conspiring against each other, defaming their masters, and stealing whenever and wherever they can.  In particular, the great writer Jonathan Swift said about his servants that they embezzle from him, they are lazy, they are drunk most of the time, they talk maliciously to their masters' neighbors and cause discord, and spread secrets of their masters' families to those who have no business knowing such secrets.

So much for the saintliness and godliness and true humanity and dignity of the servant class, the common man!  Read true history about how those people really were, and do not receive your history from blatantly commercial enterprises like ""Downton Abbey"" written by someone in the 21st century who knows nothing of what it was really like, but like most ""progressives"" imagines a fantasy world in which they wish the fantasy to be seen as reality.

In bringing this to a close, always bear in mind that ""progressives"" are all agents of the dark side of the world, the makers of lies, the destructive people who want to bring down all the greatness of Western Civilization and replace it with their own dark world, whose end, like cancer, eventually consumes the entire body and thus destroys itself in the process.  Their aim is the total destruction of all human life on the world, including themselves, leaving the earth a barren globe devoid of life hurtling through the ether through eternity.",1517270400,3,6227,4.924474187380497

 Epsisodes are marked on the DVD as split where the US version splits them, and calls them ""seasons"" instead of ""series"" but these are the shorter UK shows, rendering the markings on the DVDs incorrect.  Sound is muffled and leveled, too.

I have since watched it five times through. I found this set on Amazon after looking at all sets and prices available and I am glad I purchased this one. As far as the show goes, It is rare to find such and excellently acted, written, directed and visually, stunning show. I enjoy Masterpiece theater programs and this one is defiantly a favorite.

7723277,5,B01DRWEO6S,"I absolutely loved this series.  The acting was superb, and of course Maggie Smith and her fabulous one-liners throughout was a hoot.  I did some research after I watched it the first time and found accuracy at every turn.  The servant class, as well as the upper class, had their protocol and no one dared step across the line.  And the costumes...the second time I watched the whole series I noticed that never did I see them twice in the same outfit (except for the servants).  I may watch it the third time...yes, the whole thing from start to finish.  But first I would like to find another series as entertaining as this one.  If I don't I will watch it a third time...and then, well, who knows.  If you like period drama, superb acting, accuracy, and a job simply well done, this one's for you.",1505520000,,801,4.438356164383562

I couldn't finish that one even though I tried another DVD player. It kept getting stuck at the same places. This isn't what you would expect from new, unopened DVDs. I returned the first set and have purchased another so we'll see if the next one plays all the way through. The story is a good one although I wish it would leave out the love scenes and homosexuality. So far there's not a lot and it isn't very graphic but I personally don't prefer any.",1505347200,2,619,4.344827586206897

This is also a concern because how could it be returned if  all of the discs had not been seen  in a short month's  time?

The box set is well put together, and includes every episode. The only thing I wish they changed was there is no ""Play All"" feature on the menu. So you have to watch one episode at a time, and can't just hit play and let it go. But that shouldn't stop you from buying this set... love love love it.

Some of the dvds were 'free floating' in the back of the book and one of the bonus disks is scratched.  Since it's a bonus disk I am not too concerned about it.  I am however, a tad upset that the trays are broken.  This means that anytime I open or close the book the dvds sometimes fall off their tray or the trays slide around inside the book.  I will be contacting the seller to see what can be done.  I have not actually put the dvd's into my dvd player as yet but I am hoping that they all work.",1502496000,15,634,3.830769230769231

7723321,4,B01DRWEO6S,"It was a treat to see the history, manners, manors, and clothes on this show.  It could have rested on the pretty aesthetics as headstrong Lady Mary and her blue-blooded ilk slipped into sappy romance or silly soap.  Fortunately, the well-written characters and script take the audience on a marvelous journey from the last days of Edwardian England to the birth of the modern age.  Their stories feel fresh and relevant because they're struggling with the same issues - rapid social change, globalism, technology, female empowerment, etc., - we're grappling with today.  I also found surprising lessons on business and leadership as the castle is a precursor to the corporation, servants to staff, and kings to CEOs.  At times, Lord Crawley seems more ideal leader than realistic one like Brigitte Nyborg in Borgen. However, if Francis Urquhart (UK) / Underwood (US) in House of Cards is the reality of those in power than Downton Abbey is how those with power should be.",1500854400,,972,4.9753086419753085

7723364,5,B01DRWEO6S,"I was fortunate to be able to see part of this series during a recent PBS member drive.  I was engrossed in it immediately and finally found out what all the fuss was about.  I've liked Maggie Smith since I was a young girl.  Her character was a favorite in the Harry Potter series and likewise in this series.  I really loved the warmth between the John and Anne Bates characters.  It was nice to see Hugh Bonneville in a good guy role.  He was quite evil in Daniel Deronda and did that very well, but it's sometimes great to see that an actor can portray an opposite type of person.  I will say, though, that the cast as a whole was spectacular.  All of them together make this a hit.  I knew I would buy it as soon as I could afford to purchase it on Amazon.  I just finished watching the whole series and will view it again in a few months time.",1494547200,6,849,4.090909090909091

After I submitted my original review (issues with quality of DVDs), I replayed Season 5, Disc 3 and it now worked. I know this makes absolutely no sense. But I still suggest you binge watch to be sure quality of the DVDs is there.

Orig Review: Was fine until I got to Season 5, Disc 3. 'Play all' would only play the sponsor's advertisements, neither episode. I went to episode 8 directly, and this was very strange, but the scenes were out of sequence (I have regular Downton Abbey videos and have watched at least 5 times, plus it just wasn't making sense). Then, no matter what I tried I could not get into Episode 9. As far as the show, I have watched many things on Masterpiece Theater and there is nothing better than Downton. It is so well written, and the acting is superb. Lines that really aren't funny by themselves, ARE funny when said by this set of great actors. I just wish they would write a book that only focused on the beautiful clothes! Also, this set had some extras that were on PBS separate from the show (I think about Manners of Downton Abbey, and an extra on the house itself).",1490486400,,1170,4.36697247706422

7723582,2,B01DRWEO6S,"PBS did not solely create this series, they only were the U.S. network sponsor yet they pretend or give the impression because of it's success they were the only one's responsible.  I don't know why their imprint is all over it.  They seem to be the network of obstacles to get to the main show.  Also why can we get a clearly marked COMPLETE & UNCUT, NO COMMERCIALS, NO PBS INTRO version of this show?  There is some ambiguity about whether this set is truly uncut.  I will wait until a set is marketed that is a non-nonsense clearly stated version without all the PBS BS on it (might be a long wait). Why can't the UK producers simply release their own here (contractual obligation to PBS no doubt).  PBS can be their own worst enemy.",1481328000,7,736,4.375
7723583,5,B01DRWEO6S,"I fell head over heels in love with this powerful series.  Even though it is still available for viewing on Amazon Prime I decided it is extremely important that I own this complete six season set so that it is always available to me upon demand.  Anyone who loves period pieces will be hooked on this incredible series from the very first episode.  I know I was.  I subscribed to Amazon Prime, found the series and binge watched all six episodes in about five days.",1481241600,12,466,4.447058823529412

7723597,5,B01DRWEO6S,"To be clear, this is being written for the product number B01JNXXCM2, released  October 2016.
Of the hundreds of blurays I have purchased over the years, none took more research than this one.
Of the hundreds of blurays I have purchased over the years in no case was the anxiety over the purchase as bad
as this one.
Consider the purchase of any ""complete series"". Unless you are prepared to sit down and watch all the episodes, it will
be weeks/months before you find if you have purchased a defective product. In this case, much has been written about which version is the best and whether scenes were deleted.
In a variety of posts, it is stated that the UK version has scenes deleted because commercials had to be inserted.
To research the problem I called PBS itself, they assured me ,as I am assuring you that this UK version of the series
is intact. This is based on the viewing of the first two seasons ( from which deleted scenes were mentioned)
The quality of the product is fantastic.
Hope this helps someone else",1478908800,508,1024,4.535135135135135

It was so interesting to watch the lives between the upper crust and their servants as well as the history of time in England that this story portrays.,1535500800,,404,4.128205128205129
