8422465,5,B004987AVG,this package is slim packaging but very easy to handle.  i enjoyed the show very much.  the quality was fine and the price was best of all.  not sure what the checkpoint word means but besides that i have no complaints .  i would order from this company again with no problems.  this slim packaging is  done in clear sleeves  per year.  not much chance to scratch dvds that way.  take a chance i am glad i did.,1328832000,,410,4.153846153846154
