8520831,3,B007PXYVMI,"One of those movies that was less than it could have been. Despite the fine performances by the lead actors, the movie leaves one feeling that it is missing about 20 minutes of character development and story line. It seems as if the producers ran out of money and simply released the film with scenes not filmed.",1425686400,,313,4.508771929824562
8520832,5,B007PXYVMI,"This is one of the best movies I've ever watched.  IT's warm, it's real, and it's a little melancholy.  Gena Rowland is such a beautiful woman and a fine actor.  Same with Marisa Tomei.  I don't think it would appeal to people under 50 but should be a real winner with 50+.",1417651200,,273,4.1923076923076925
8520833,4,B007PXYVMI,I like it,1408147200,,9,2.3333333333333335
8520834,1,B007PXYVMI,Full of the  F word.  I didn't  even make it  through 20 minutes and was tired of the fowl language and turned it off.  Very disappointed in it.,1389657600,,144,4.0
8520835,5,B007PXYVMI,Great movie especially for older mom's and dad's who have other things to do with the rest of their lives besides baby sit.  We did that already.,1356912000,,145,4.37037037037037
8520836,5,B007PXYVMI,"Gena Rowlands and Mareisa Tomei lead a cast of fine actors in this story of a middle-aged widow who is at a turning point in her life. For movie lovers like me who do not think Meryl Streep is the greatest actress in the world, you will find Rowlands a joy to watch in another of her pitch perfect characterizations.",1355875200,3,316,4.283333333333333
