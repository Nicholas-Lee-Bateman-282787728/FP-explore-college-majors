1340731,5,B00004CR9T,"These movies are just hillarious.  Dana Carvey and Mike Meyers provide some of the great comic perfomances of the decade.  These are fabulous films, that launched Mike Meyers carreer of stardom.  A classic.

1340732,3,B00004CR9T,"i think these movies deserve 3 stars because there wasn't really a point to them. they were funny though, especially the 2 one. the first one was ok.",994982400,,149,4.357142857142857
1340733,5,B00004CR9T,"Aside from both films being very, very funny (and a rare case of the sequel being better than the first film), this is a great DVD package, with the 2 DVDs being cheaper as a set than bought individually, and some nice extras like director's commentary tracks for each, etc.",994896000,,274,4.5
1340734,5,B00004CR9T,ok everyone.. these movies are 2 classics.. some of the best works of comedy around.. mike myers is awsome.. funny as always.. and when has dana carvey ever not been funny??? I don't really know what more to say than buy this.. these movies are the greatest... Im not worthy..,994723200,,276,4.54
1340735,5,B00004CR9T,"Ok.  It may not be Shakespeare, but I'm betting the non-high brows out there will love these films. Mike Myers at this best.  To me the second of the two films is the best due to all of the puns of other  more ""serious"" movies. You must remember to get the brown M&M's or Ozzie won't go on stage...",994636800,,298,4.016949152542373
1340736,5,B00004CR9T,"These 2 movies are the best of Mike Myers at his funniest. Mulitple endings, good sense of humor, great music sound track. Sometomes its those movies who don't win the awards that are the best.",992995200,2,193,4.542857142857143
1340737,5,B00004CR9T,"The exuberant youthful anti-establishment rantings are great, plus superb singing and comic cameos, but of course it's Wayne and Garth - the well-developed characters from years of showing at SNL - who carry this great optimistic show. One question - why don't SNL produce a Wayne's World special containing all of the SNL Wayne's World spots (ideally on DVD)? It's long overdue, and due to the success of the movies would rake in a fortune. Go do it!....",989712000,4,455,4.846153846153846

The plot is weak, butt the first one was fresh as they were a hot skit from Saturday Night Live. The first one has the memorable tribute to Queen's song Bohemian Rhapsody sung by Wayne & crew in the car. The first movie has many funny scenes & still is funny after all these years. The second movie had a weak plot, but hey it's Wayne & Garth. The beauty of these 2 movies is it is clean humor with no nudity so you can feel safe having children watch.

1340832,5,B00004CR9T,"I have this ""double feature"" DVD & watch it every chance I get. Adapting minutes-long skits from SNL to the big screen is always a gamble (Anyone remember ""It's Pat""? Or the recent bomb ""MacGruber""?); some are simply better off in their short format instead of trying to expand them into an hour & a half film comedy. But ""Wayne's World"" (1992) defied (and surprised) those expecting it to fail spectacularly. Backed by Lorne Michaels as producer, the geeky team of Wayne & Garth shot Mike Myers & Dana Carvey (Myers, in particular) to movie stardom. Weaving an amiable tale of Wayne getting the girl of his dreams (Cassandra, a foxy rock goddess played by Tia Carrere), buying the guitar of his dreams (Excalibur!), while getting fast-talked by an impossibly good-looking but slimy producer (Rob Lowe, natch) who commercializes & therefore ruins the charm of the little show from Wayne's basement. The movie is jam-packed with satirical in-jokes, there's a cool head-banging-in-the-car homage to Queen's then-recently deceased frontman Freddie Mercury, and even Ed ""Al Bundy"" O'Neil has a scene stealing cameo as the deeply disturbed owner-manager of the local food hangout.
""Wayne's World 2"" (1993) continues the fun, getting more daffier at times in comic invention than its predecessor. Wayne is visited by Jim Morrison in his dreams, who tells Wayne it is his destiny to put on a concert. Thus, with friend Garth's help, and the aid of a legendary roadie burnout (who keeps retelling this insane story about getting a thousand brown M&M's at the corner sweet shoppe, ""or else, Ozzie wasn't going on stage that night""), ""Waynestock"" is born. A few subplots--Garth's ""fatal attraction"" fling with a real babe (Kim Basinger); Wayne meeting Cassandra's strict father (legendary Asian actor James Hong, with subtitles, no less); Wayne's struggles to book a major music act before showtime (explaining why Aerosmith appears); and a scheming producer/manager (Christopher Walken, who can really dance!) threatens to take Cassandra away from Wayne (leading to a spoof of ""The Graduate"")--hitch their wagons to the main plot. There's a delightful you-see-it-coming-but-it's-still-funny tribute to The Village People, a funny cameo from Charlton Heston, and the late Chris Farley steals his scenes as a lumbering, bumbling stage assistant.

1340854,5,B00004CR9T,"Well, here it is, kiddies, the Wayne's World epic. The story of Chicago-area rock-loving slackers, the charismatic Wayne Campbell and the geeky Garth Algar, that went from SNL sketch to '90s pop culture staple.

Wayne's World has become a classic in the fourteen years since its release (okay, now I feel old). Who can listen to Bohemian Rhapsody and  not think of the opening scene? Who can play street hockey and not say ""GAME ON!"" when the street is clear? Exactly. The movie also introduced many '90s slang words. Not! Scha-WING! That's what she said! Asphinctersayswhat? She/It will be mine. Oh yes. She/it will be mine. Party on! The movie never takes itself seriously, and is quotable from start to finish (SEEN SAH BEEN DO WAH!!!). This is the Caddyshack of the '90s.

Oh, yeah, and the sequel is very good as well. Christopher Walken shines as the sleazy record producer. ""You want me to say what. Like, I don't get it."" Not quite as good as the first, but still sweet, right down to the Graduate parody.

Bottom line: both movies are classics. They never take themselves seriously, they're funny as hell, you can quote them from start to finish, and they're both fun rides. For this price, there is no reason not to buy this set. None, whatsoever. Do you hear me? BUY IT. NOW. PARTY ON!",1159228800,,1296,4.646288209606987
1340855,5,B00004CR9T,"Based on a brilliant Saturday Night Live sketch, Wayne's World and Wayne's World 2 are both equally enjoyable films and great additions to anyones DVD libraries.

The Wayne's World movies both base around the lives of two  young men who do their own local cable access show in the town of Aurora, IL. Wayne Cambell (Mike Myers) is the smart, charming, witty leader of the duo who is into hot women and rock music. While his partner Garth (Dana Carvey) idolizes Wayne and makes for the perfect teammate . He is a little slow but is good with computers, machines and has a very innocent mind.

The films follow the adventures that Wayne and Garth get into with their friends as they put on their TV show from Wayne's Parents basement, while they try to pick up chicks and attend rock concerts and eat their donuts at the local hang out.

The first Wanye's World movie was very successful and for good reason, its a very wity and humor filled film that set the stage perfectly and carried on in the tradition of the SNL sketches that made them such well known house hold names. In the first movie Wayne and Garth get noticed by Benjamin Kayne (Rob Lowe) who works for a big company that wants to put Wayne and Garth's TV show onto regular TV along with a sponcer and all the perks of working for a regular TV studio. Along the way Wayne meets the love of his life, Cassandra Wong (Tia Carrere) who is an up and coming rock singer who takes an instant liking to him. Ben has more in store then just letting them have a taste of the big time. He seems to have the hots for Cassandra as well and will do any thing it takes to break up the two. And he does a good job of doing just that. Wayne loses his TV show, Cassandra and his best friend all due to Ben. Of course everything works out for Wayne when all is said and done, he gets a contract for his now girlfriend Cassandra, made the bad guy look like a fool and the great thing about a movie is if you don't like how a movie ends, you can always re do it.

Most memorable moments in this film include a hillarious moment when Wayne, Garth and 3 friends are in a little car singing Queen's ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" while banging their heads as they drive along the road. Many laughs fill the movie like when the two stars would take the camera along with them for a private convo that only we the viewer were in on. Or talk about how they don't sell out to any sponcer while they are busy drinking Pepsi and wearing Reebok gear. It has a great ending that really ends things on an upbeat note. There isn't any slow parts the film. It starts at a humor filled beat and stays that way the whole way through never taking the world they are engulfed in seriously even realizing they are in a movie at times and letting us in on the jokes. Another great moment is when they get back stage passes to Alice Cooper's concert and Alice starts to tell them about the history of the name Milwaukee. Many great sight gags and cameos fill the film. It's short enough to watch many times and the jokes don't get stale as the fun ends at just the right time before it gets to be too much. This movie alone is reason enough to buy the set.

The second film ""Wayne's World 2"" picks up a year after the first film, Wayne and Cassandra are still together and Wayne and Garth have moved into their own loft across town still doing their public access show. Cassandra now has a manager Bobby Cahn (Christopher Walken) who like Ben in the first film takes an instant liking to her and wants Wayne removed from the situation by getting her to move out of Aurora to Hollywood. If that wasn't all enough for Wayne to deal with, an almost naked indian approaches Wayne in a dream one night and when Wayne follows through the desert he meet up with Jim Morrison, the dead lead singer of the Doors. Jim tells Wayne that he has to put on a concert and book all the biggest bands. That will give him meaning to his life. Wayne decides that is exactly what he has to do and with the help of various people that Jim tells him about and friends in Aurora he puts together a potentialy huge concert he calls ""Waynestock"". Garth meanwhile has his first experiences with a girl Honey Hornee' (Kim Basinger) who seems to want more then just a relationship from him.

The most memorable moments from this movie include Wayne meeting Cassandra's father and the two of them fight it out in a mock Kung Fu film situation, with dubbed english and all. One of the funniest uses of a Village People reference that I ever saw in a movie. And the film itself has many cameo's and big name stars like Chris Farley, Drew Barrymore, Rip Taylor (ok maybe not all are big stars) and Aerosmith. The film is almost a mirror image of the first as it carries a lot of the same jokes and gags but is different enough to come off as something totaly new and funny. Its a great follow up to a great movie and a worthy sequel. Sometimes sequels can lose something that the original had. This goes about things in the same exact way keeping a lot of the same themes we loved from the first intact and that's probably what people would want anyway as well it worked.

You definitely won't be sorry adding this box set to your collection. Both movies are funny, witty and enjoyable for people of all ages and will be a great blast from the not too distant past that you and any family member or friend can watch on the fly.

After awhile you  too will start to chant: ""Wayne's World.. party time.. excellent!! WOO WOO WOO!!! """,1137456000,5,5507,4.286538461538462

Sure, some of the humor is more related to pop culture over a decade ago, but for some reason the movies seem almost as fresh as they were when they came out some 12 years back.

1340862,5,B00004CR9T,"Leave it to Mike Meyers and Dana Carvey to break the curse of ""Bad Saturday Night Live"" related films, and even better, actually make a GOOD sequel!

The first ""Waynes World"" is a classic of goofy rock & roll centered comedy as Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar are given the opportunity to take their rock & roll babe-a-licious cable TV show to the big time. However, trouble is afoot when Benjamin intends to use the show to serve his selfish ends (steal Wayne's girlfriend, make big $$$). Wayne and Garth save the day though as Wayne stands up and fights for his principles and wins back his beloved Cassandra (with some help from Garth's technological wizardry) and returns to his cable TV roots. Lots of great spoofery takes place (""Mission Impossible"" , TERMINATOR and the ""Grey Pupon"" ads of yore etc) as well as a particularly hilarious scene involving Alice Cooper's discourse about the history of local Indian tribes in Milwaukee WI.

WW 2 finds our heroes a year older and SLIGHTLY wiser, as well as living in their own warehouse loft. Here, Wayne attempts to find his calling in life, and through a series of visions involving Jim Morrison, some weird naked Indian and Sammy Davis Jr. (?????!!!!), Wayne, against CONSIDERABLE odds puts on his first big concert event, WAYNESTOCK. Along the way, a greedy, exploitive record producer AGAIN conspires to steal Wayne's girlfriend and make big $$$$. Wayne again goes to battle for his principles and his beloved Cassandra. The hilarity mounts as once again, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, THE GRADUATE, FATAL ATTRACTION, The 1966 BATMAN TV show, Bruce Lee movies, Kenny G, The Village People, Virgin Air and others are mercilessly satirized. With a little help from a grizzled veteran roadie (who keeps telling the same Ozzy Osborne/David Crosby story), Wayne saves the day and learns  some valuable life lessons.

All told, great fun for those of us who still have a bit of the 'ol rocker left in us!",1101686400,2,1944,4.86404833836858
1340863,5,B00004CR9T,"Wayne says it best. This film is by far the greatest comedy ever told. It has drama, suspense, laughter, and cheese. The films are golden and it really outshines anything Mike Myers does, even till today.
With rock and roll, the good stuff, taking a big chunk of the film, we follow the life of Wayne and Garth, Wayne primarily, as he goes from bringing his television show to fame, to starting a concert...in Aurora. Everyone wants to stay in Aurora, the City of Lights. But not the antagonists Rob Lowe and Christopher Walken, who, respectively try to bring the beloved Cassandra(Wayne's love interest), away from. With a story clouded in laughs and roars, you really can't fail.
Watching this now, it never really feels dated, and in fact, would love to see a third film. It'd be great to buy the Wayne's World trilogy and I think the time would be fine, still. Either way, and now awake from the dream world I was in, I recommend this DVD set. It's a must buy, it's not like mopping up soak suds and lung butter, it's like buying a totally, amazing, excellent discovery.

1340864,4,B00004CR9T,"This is totally amazingly eccellent! A boxed set of both of the Wayne's World movies. What more could someone who enjoyed the movies wish for?
Who doesn't know the story of Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers) and his trustworthy sidekick Garth Algar (Dana Carvey)? As hosts of their very own local tv show, they're highly popular with the youngsters and the girls (though neither of them has much experience on that topic).
In the first movie, they're approached by Benjamin, a sleazy TV executive (Rob Lowe), who is intent on exploiting the show ""Wayne's World"" to make a quick buck. Wayne is forced to deal with various issues, including being fired from his own show, losing his girlfriend Cassandra (The gorgeous Kia Terrere), and losing his best friend Garth. Will he and his group of friends manage to take back their own show and land Cassandra a record deal at the same time?
The second one is about Wayne being visited in a dream by Jim Morrison. Wayne is looking for a goal in his life, and Jim provides him with one: Wayne is to organise WayneStock, a rock festival. Again, Wayne has to deal with numerous issues to fight his way through.
To me, the real charm of the movie is by the countless amounts of famous stars making an appearance in the movie. From Alice Cooper and Aerosmith to Rob Lowe and Christopher Walken, from Tia Carrere to Ed O'Neill, from Chris Farley to Kim Basinger, the movies are packed with celebrities who were all to keen to help Myers out with this project.
Even though the movies will never be a fallback for countless one-liners like (for instance) the Naked Gun series, they still make up for great amusement and a hysterical laugh.
Myers and Carvey manage to make sure the movie doesn't fall apart, though (in my opinion) Carvey is the real talent here. He's pure comedy genius, and sort of makes Myers look like the sidekick.
The only dissappointment is the lack of extra's on the DVD. Come on. No one out there will think 'Widescreen, Dolby Digital, English subtitles, Interactive menus or Scene selection' are ""special features"" anymore. Those are standard. Interviews are nice, but the real appeal with DVDs as a medium are goodies like Behind-the-scenes and Deleted scenes. It would have been nice to get a bit more for the buck. Still, for the true fan? The combo is a nice buy.",1079827200,15,2318,4.669926650366748
1340865,5,B00004CR9T,"Released in 1991 and 1993, these are probably the two best ""Saturday Night Live"" - based films ever created. The humor is dry and witty, the acting is splendid and great music (a little ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", gentlemen?).
""Wayne's World"" is about two guys named Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers) and Garth (the too underrated Dana Carvey) who host their own cable access show in Aurora, Illinois and enjoy rocking out to their favorite tunes. While at a club, Wayne catches a glimpse of the babelicious Cassandra (Tia Carrere - schwing!). Wayne and Cassandra hook up. Soon, a slimy tv executive (played deliciously by Rob Lowe) offer the two headbangers $ 5,000 and their own cable tv show. (Exsqueeze me, a baking powder?). Things seem to be alright. Wayne and Cassandra are in item, he and Garth meet Alice Cooper (we're not worthy, their perrenial line). But things start to go awry. Cassandra and Wayne break up, they blow the show, and Garth and Wayne throw away their friendship. Can the day be saved? Just watch and find out. And be on the look out for cameos by Chris Farley, Donna Dixon, Robert Patrick, Alice Cooper, and a diabollically funny Ed O'Neil as a disturbed (albeit disturbing) donut shop employee.
1993's ""Wayne's World 2"" makes a valiant effort to recapture the magic from part one, and it succeeds. This one takes place one year after the first film. Wayne is wondering what to do with his life once his show ends. One night, Jim Morrison and a naked Indian come to him in a dream, telling him to invent a concert and book big names. Meanwhile, Cassandra signs a contract with a sleazy record producer (Christopher Walken, devilish as always), and Garth has the hots for Honey Hornee (that's Horn-ay, and she's played by an incredibly hot Kim Basinger). Once again, things soon go askew. None of the acts show up (except for Rip Taylor), and Wayne gets dumped. Once again, can the day be saved? Watch and you'll find out. Also, try and spot appearances by Chris Farley, Aerosmith, Ed O'Neil, Chris Farley, Kevin Pollack, Olivia D'Abo, Charlton Heston, and Drew Barrymore.

1340868,5,B00004CR9T,"This series has always been my favorite movie series ever. I have seen each of them about 1000 times and i still laugh at all the jokes. I guess its because i can relate to the characters in their music, humor and almost their lifestyles. If you are considering getting this series hesitate no more because i highly recommend this movie. GET IT.",1062028800,,345,4.492063492063492
1340869,5,B00004CR9T,"The Wayne's World movies have always been favorites of mine.  I grew up watching both of them.  Now I'm all grown up and love them even more on DVD because I actually get all of the jokes.  The first movie is obviously the better one, but the sequel is just about as good as the original.  Its alot of fun with the second movie because they get to play around alot more with their characters.  The DVD extras are pretty good.  The menu screen is pretty entertaining, as it looks like a tv guide menu. There is a short documentary on each movie.  Could have used some deleted scenes though.  All in all worth it!",1061078400,,611,4.252173913043478
1340870,5,B00004CR9T,"It would have been so good if Mike Myers would have continued with Waynes world as it's as funny as the austin powers series and even betters it in someways i mean what more could you ask for in a film when you see Wayne seeking spiritual guidance in a dream with Jim Morisson and a wierd naked Indian. Waynnes world 1 & 2 are about two airhead metal heads who (on waynes world 2) try to host waynes-stock a concert including loads of bands like Aerosmith etc.. And theres also the bit with Kim Basinger which always makes me laugh when shes trying to seduce Garth and he doesn't have a clue, without doubt two of the funniest films i've ever seen.",1059782400,,648,4.276422764227642
1340871,5,B00004CR9T,"This is one probably one of the most classic SNL movies ever made other than The ladies man. Mike Meyers(Wayne) and Dana Carvey(Garth) are just typical guys who want to party. In the first Waynes World, The Villan,(Rob Lowe) Buys thier show offering them 5,000$ and tries to steal Cassandra (Tia Carrere). After Wayne and Garths show is bought, Rob Lowe tries to sabotage it. ALL three endings are pretty funny, such as the scooby doo ending, Happy ending...ect. The second is actually just as good or even better...pretty hard to believe..but it is funny. This time Wayne has a vision in his dreams that he should put on a concert called ""WAynes Stock,"". But the Evil Christopher Walkin, (Cassandras Record Producer) tries to marry her and steal waynes girlfriend!! Like I said both are hysterical and there are many special guests in all of them...escpecially from the saturday night live members..Great movies...A must buy.!!!",1048982400,,929,5.0

Making fun of many movies, people, and world happenings, it is sure to make you laugh your pants off every time! I just received it as a Christmas gift and I have already seen it a million times.

Just two things. I wish for a commentary with Dana Carvey and Mike Myers in character a la Spinal Tap. Also, anyone notice the weird music changes? That isn't the same version of Dream Weaver...I wonder why. It mentions it on the case.
Other than that...it was very EXCELLENT!",1004227200,,386,4.5285714285714285
1340875,5,B00004CR9T,"Denouncing Wayne's World like that. It's shameful. This is an hilarious film which is very rewatchable; Myers and Carvey are great playing out the two teenage 'rockin' dudes', and you just gotta love the metal soundtrack.
It's not extremely deep and meaningful, but it is extremely funny, and the sequel holds up reasonably well against the first 'Wayne's World.'
It's excellent.",1000080000,4,379,5.229508196721311
1340876,5,B00004CR9T,"Two very funny movies. The DVD presentation is fantastic. A lot of effort here. The menu's look like a TV guide, you get glimpses of other DVD's (Ewww Solid Gold aerobics), each movie has a documentary with interviews (about 22 minutes each). The movie's themselves look great with anamorphic widescreen and DD5.1 sound.
The director's commentary from Penelope Spheeris is entertaining and informative. The commentary by Stephen Serjuk is boring and meandering.
A very worthwhile way to spend your money and enjoy a couple of hours of fun.",997228800,7,539,5.136363636363637
1340877,5,B00004CR9T,"Alright; so both of these movies rock.  They take one of the funniest SNL skits starring two of the funniest comedy actors of their time, and make them into a full length movie.  Unlike most other SNL lifts, like superstar, night at the roxbury, or any of the other trite and pointless comedies that have sprung from the now waning-SNL, Wayne's World is actually funny, and addictingly so.  From the first few moments of the original movie, joke after joke plows the audience.  Meyers and Carvey are genius in their roles as bumbling musicians trying to make it big while keeping it real; as Wayne and Garth, they flow through fame fortune, and ""CAsssandra"" (tia Carerra, in a knockout foxy role).  The second film isn't quite as good as the first, but lets be honest, how many sequels are even comparable to the first (the lost world to jurassic park, TMNT 2 to TMNT (tho vanilla ice rocked), the ounces of horror flick sequels).  It is still very entertaining, tho, so don't be dissuaded by the fact that its a sequel.  Seriously, a definite investment for anyone who needs a good laugh, or a few good movie lines to memorize.  And a must buy for any Meyers/Carvey fan (hey whatever did happen to Dana Carvey....he is so talented).  This reviewers final word: definitely buy",996364800,10,1276,4.660714285714286
