8526670,5,B008BUEWUK,"I have use this DVD information guide to build my 2 home use desktop gamer PC's. The information provided is up to date and accurate. Using the step by step lessons it's easy to understand the terminology,installation methods and settings for all the components in building a PC.
I looked at many other PC building sites, You-Tube videos claiming that was all you needed but I wasn't confident in their claims.
I selected HomePCBuilder because of the personal commitment from Michael to ensure total satisfaction.
Michael also offers forums to inquire your questions and comments to which he responds very promptly.

The fun starts when you get to select the parts you want for your personal custom build. From the style of your case, the internal components to the colors of your cooling fan lights it will all be as YOU want it!

Finally,I think the best part of building your own PC is the great feeling of accomplishment you get when you start up the PC for the first time knowing YOU made it all happen.
You will not be disappointed in the content and information provided on this DVD when building your own PC.  Fact!",1353628800,,1123,4.690355329949239
8526671,5,B008BUEWUK,"I know nothing about computer, I never even owned a computer. So 2009-2010 I found homepcbuilder watch the sample videos, it gave someone like me everything I need to know and more. My first build was one of there suggested ""part lists"" the workstation. I went great I followed two years later with the overClocking videos and still gave me everything I need to know to do it safe and smart. With there help I was able to overclock my i7-920 d.o. socket 1366 to 3.9mhz and my Ram 1868mhz. Today I have build 9 computer for me and others. It has saved me so much money in the long-run. I truly thing there prices are worth every penny. I think these video give you the right education for building and buying parts. This was the best money I ever spent. Hell I send everyone I know to this site. ""They should be pay me"" lol.. Joking aside its a great product. This gave me the confidence to go back to school for engineering at 30years old.",1353283200,2,939,4.3107344632768365
8526672,5,B008BUEWUK,"This DVD is superb.  It is even better than the 2010 DVD. Anyone can become knowledgeable with computer hardware and build their own system if they watch this DVD. Michael makes selecting your hardware simple. If you are into computing and would like to build your own system, instead of going out and buying one that really doesn't suit your taste, you should watch this DVD and build it yourself.",1352592000,,398,4.685714285714286
8526673,5,B008BUEWUK,"I have played with technology in one manner or another since the late sixties. Over the years I upgraded computers and other techi items and even have a degree in the field.  However, I never ventured into building a computer from 'scratch'.  The videos are well done and filled with insightful information even for those who swapped out hard drives, added RAM, or replaced power supplies.

It is well worth the money spent.",1352160000,,424,4.780821917808219
8526674,5,B008BUEWUK,"I have tried many video DVDs like this one and none of them came close to this Home PC Builder 2012 DVD. I even went to a  school to be a repair tech and the books and the videos that were given to me did not come close to this Home PC Builder 2012 DVD. This video is easy to understand with step by step instructions, many useful links and information( which is even beyond the scope of just building PCs) in it. This DVD is a great value for the price. Anything you may need about putting hardware and software together to build your own custom PC and the latest technology such as CrossFireX and SLI is in there. Thanks to the creator of this video because I found it very useful to build my first custom computer successfully. An excellent customer service via phone call or e-mail.",1341964800,,786,4.275167785234899
8526675,5,B008BUEWUK,"Rarely do I write reviews, unless some company really pisses me off. But this isn't one of those. Like many others I knew just enough about computers to screw things up. One night while looking for computer help online, I watched one of the demo video's. I learned a lot in that free 3 minute video. I applied what I had learned to my pc and it worked. I bought the video. With what I learned, I upgraded my computer. In time I built several computers for me, my family and friends. I've fixed computers for family, co-workers and friends. Most people are amazed when they see my pc's. Overclocked CPU's and Ram, ssd's, multiple monitors, & kvm to use one mouse and keyboard for two computers. And Michael actually answers the phone when you call. Real ""Personal"" help is hard to find. I even bought a video for my friend who can't afford a new computer, but given the right information he can maintain and upgrade what he has.",1341792000,,927,4.458823529411765
