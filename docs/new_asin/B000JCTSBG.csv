8149999,2,B000JCTSBG,"This is a DVD digitized from video that was originally on film. That means that the image is third generation and therefor not the best quality. The subject matter is interesting and the interviews with the sculptor are good too, if you can deal with the spooky acid trip music. Julius Kohanyi tried hard (and failed) to make the film artsy in it's own right. Extreme close ups of Henry's face are particularly disturbing. I love Henry Moore's work so it's still something that I will watch many times, but it's a crappy production.",1188777600,4,532,4.670212765957447
