8635675,5,B00HTH94FY,"""Julius Shulman: Desert Modern"" is a must for fans of mid-century architecture, and particularly the desert architecture of the Palm Springs area. This DVD is a wonderful retrospective of Shulman's astonishing 70-year career and focuses on his photos of truly iconic homes. Particularly noteworthy is the coverage of the Sinatra and Kaufmann houses, and the attention paid to the architecture of Richard Neutra and Albert Frey among others. The DVD is both entertaining and enlightening, and I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates modern architecture.

As a bonus, there are a series of lectures presented on Shulman (with Shulman himself in attendance at the age of 97), my favorite of which was the presentation by Michael Stern. I also recommend Stern's authoritative book, ""Julius Shulman: Palm Springs"" for those who wish to delve deeper into Shulman's influential body of work.",1510617600,,892,5.326241134751773
