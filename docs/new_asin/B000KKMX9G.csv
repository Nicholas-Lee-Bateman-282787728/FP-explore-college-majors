8157783,1,B000KKMX9G,"boring and messy screenplay with vague scenario, involving bunch of criminals against one another, an office woman and a geek. putting a bomb in an office on an office building's 17th floor to eliminate some evidences. long scenes and endless dialop in an elevator. lot of illogic garbage could not be explained well. need to use fast forward to go to the end. one of the most boring thrillers ever seen. stay away from this italian deadbeat as far as you could.",1182384000,,462,4.646341463414634
