7930313,5,B000053VCF,"This is a truly tough cardio mix. It is tough aerobic parts from some of my favorite Firm workouts,Firm Cardio,Firm Strength,Firm Fat Blaster. It really gets the heart pumping. This is not a video that would be good for a beginner but intermediate and advanced levels will enjoy this high energy workout. Pam Cauthen,Heidi Tanner,Lisa Kay,Allie Strickland,and Nancy Tucker are all leads in the workout. You will need an aerobic step 6-10 inches tall,A wooden dowell for balance(I would use a broom or mop handle)and a pair of dumbells 3-5 pounds. This is a killer workout. If you love cardio,you`ll love this workout.",1155254400,,617,5.0
7930314,4,B000053VCF,"...but it's lots of fun!  This is one of my favorite Firm parts videos.  It is about 45 minutes long and contains clips of Fat Blaster, Firm Cardio and Firm Strength.  The clips are all cardio of course, the majority of it from Fat Blaster (warmup, 5 step sections, 1 hi-lo impact section, 1 4-limb section, cooldown and stretch).  There are 2 step sections and one 4-limb section from Firm Cardio and one each hi-lo and 4 limb section from Firm Strength.  There are several different instructors leading the different sections, but as a long time Firm fan, I am used to this and it doesn't bother me at all.

What's nice about this video as others have said is that the first half of this video is all step, the hi-lo and 4-limb sections are after that.  I often use the step section as an add-on after my strength training so it is nice that it's all right there and you don't have to fast forward through clips to get the parts that you want.

I would rate this intermediate level, beginners could probably handle it though if they started out with no weights or very light weights and a low step.  The choreography isn't hard to follow which is something I always appreciated from the Firm, advanced exercisers will find this boring and not challenging at all, Super Cardio would be a better choice for advanced people.

But it you are looking for a fun cardio with some variety this is a good choice if you can find it, too bad it is out of print.  I hope this is released on DVD one day, I would definitely buy it.

Overall I give this 4 and a half stars.",1143936000,,1561,4.326460481099656
7930315,3,B000053VCF,"First I have to say, that although I like several of The Firm's fitness tapes, this is not a favorite of mine. One of the things I disliked most about the video is that it is cut and paste tape with parts being taken from several other previously released Firm tapes, and put together on this one tape, rather than being a completely new workout in itself. Also, the workout, although approximately 45 minutes in duration, did not get my heart rate up high enough to burn fat, and improve heart conditioning. The step routines are dull and repetitive, as are most Firm stepbox routines, and the floor aerobics is lacking when it comes to fun factor as well. If you insist on using The Firm for cardio...then I would recommend The Firm's Cardio Burn, as this is one of the few Firm tapes I have found that gets the heart rate up there, and works up a sweat. The Firm is great for scultping, but not for cardio, especially this tape.",1000684800,8,931,4.4186046511627906
7930316,3,B000053VCF,"This tape is compiled from three previous Firm Tapes. Firm Strength, Firm Cardio and Firm Total Body Fat Blaster. The segments are edited together well enough to make a smooth flowing workout. The workout consists of about 20 minutes of step aerobics followed by about 15 minutes of floor aerobics. Light weight are used in many of the segments to increase the intensity. The choreography is basic and very easy to follow. This is a great tape for a beginner to intermediate exerciser, although advanced exercisers probably won't find it very challengeing. The sets are brightly colored and the five different instructors give the workout variety.",978480000,9,647,5.113207547169812
