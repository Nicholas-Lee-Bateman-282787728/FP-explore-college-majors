8282708,3,B001BDYDHQ,"I am still trying to figure out how I feel about this film. It certainly had an impact.

The gritty portrayal of a fragmented society where 'family' exists merely in concept, and young men and women find identity within themselves, almost as if the traditional family has been substituted by a deeper friendship amongst peers is a sad indictment of society today.

Parents seems to be overwhelmed by their own lives, acutely aware that their conduct impacts on the lives of their children, but they are either incapable or unwilling to adapt to the needs of their children. They are mere shadows in the substance of their children's lives, having little, if any, positive influence. Instead children are wrenched from their innocence, and forced to participate in the misery that follows their parent's lives. Their response is to reach out to their friends, who in turn become flawed role models. A blind man cannot teach a blind man to see.

The violence is raw, unsettling and extreme. It is however, the truth and the audience is forced to watch, albeit removed a story which ultimately reflects on their own apathy. Like a silent gun, the film inflicts a mortal wound on your conscience, leaving you with a deep resonating pain and inability to change what you know to be your own demise. Apathy within a society that is both fragmenting and destroying itself, is inviting your own failure.",1278028800,,1395,4.852941176470588
8282709,5,B001BDYDHQ,"What I love about this movie is the beautiful portrayal of the relationships between Tano and his friends and family.  Each interaction is perfectly depicted in such a way that you can see clearly the love and betrayal between each of them.  The crime is honestly portrayed so that you feel clearly the sense of wrong, yet are compelled to watch on.  Moments of hope that Tano experiences are mercilessly snatched away from him, as the inevitability of his neighbourhood and circumstances play out",1264636800,,497,4.892857142857143
8282710,4,B001BDYDHQ,"I really enjoy this movie, love the acting & the story. But why is this movie be in the so called Gay DVD section!?!
Even the Photo on the DVD cover 'looks like' they're trying to market to the Gay Audience (Another Coming of Age Gay theme movie). a bit misleading, just as the DVD called 'Teenage Angst' I would both movie 'Oh so Dysfunctional Brotherly Love!' NOTHING GAY ABOUT THEM!
I recommend this movie definitely though, a very well produced 'Teenage Wake up Call' Theme with a lot of Violence. Kind of depressing at times but the story is well fimed.  OK the Boys are cute!",1247356800,7,581,4.429906542056075
8282711,2,B001BDYDHQ,"Why 7 Virgins as a title? It took three viewing for me to figure it out. (you r right, I am not very smart) it is the ""holy cards"" of the Virgin Mary that one cast members holds. But this has nothing to do with the film. Go figure!

Release from Juvenile jail for his brother's wedding he goes crazy but in the end supports his nervous brother.

I rate this a C or C+. Meaning, you really do not need to see this film.

Violence, brief nudity, no sex to speak of and disorganized.",1228003200,9,480,4.031578947368421

Although it is not the most uplifting film ever, it did have some delightful moments and kept my attention well.",1147392000,,241,4.738095238095238
