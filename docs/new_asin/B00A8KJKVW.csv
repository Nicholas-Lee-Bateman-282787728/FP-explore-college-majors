8548258,5,B00A8KJKVW,"Beloved, spurned, beset, pursuing, pursued, besotted: love casts poor, mightily confused Marc Maronnier every which way!  Taking Marc's role is Gaspard Proust (birth name Gasper Pust or Kasper Pst), a Slovenian-French comedian and actor whose work is very much worth following, if one's French is up to the challenge of most of his DVDs. Fortunately, ""L'Amour dure trois ans"" (""Love Lasts Three Years"" being the title in English) has subtitles both in French and in English, at least on the edition viewed (Seville/Entertainment-One 200445-DV), although others of his various DVDs lack English subtitles in the current editions available as listed in their entries on Amazon's various national WWW sites.

Proust is one of those peculiar-looking guys who is both seductively handsome, with at once a sweetly boyish appeal yet having a navely comical-looking face which together make him perfect for a role like that of Marc Maronnier. One thinks, in Hollywood terms, of someone like the young Woody Allen, except that Proust really is one obviously very beguiling good-looker. The motion picture which features him is an utterly entrancing sex farce, but one with a feather-light approach to its zaniness and abounding in deliciously delicate irony and parody that none but a few English and even fewer American films manage to achieve. By 2011, the date of this film's release, Proust attained his 35th year of age, but he still looks a bit like a cherubic ""twenty-something"" with the youthful bloom that a beautifully fresh complexion naturally enhances.

At the film's outset, Marc Maronnier confronts his wife Anne's insistence on a divorce, something that he very much does not want in the very least. However, Anne prevails, obtaining the divorce and leaving Marc with a black eye when he resists too ardently. Marc has made his living in journalism, renowned for his book reviews and entertainment (""night life"") column. Humiliated and (temporarily, as it turns out) cynical, he undertakes a book-length examination of real love as a merely temporary phenomenon. (It is the title of Marc's book that lends its name to the film.) No sooner does the publisher release the book than heaven-stormingly besotted love takes hold on him, when he falls for the wife, Alice (the lovely Louise Bourgoin), of his cousin, Antoine (Nicolas Bedos); this hits Marc like a thunder-bolt of love-at-first-sight for Marc, although there is need to wait some time for Marc to coax Alice from her husband; the two lovers start their illicit affair in the aftermath of the funeral of two men's grandmother.

Alice is unaware at first that Marc Maronnier is the real name of ""Fodor Belvdre"", the pseudonym that the author uses for his book, which attains almost instant best-seller status and, inevitably, renown for Marc, whose real identity a television feature about the book reveals, much to Marc's consternation, for Marc knows that Alice despises the book and everything for which it stands (and which Marc had believed only briefly, after all, to be true). Alice, seeing the TV show, falls into a monumental temper-tantrum and deserts Marc. It is up to the reader of this review to find out for himself how Marc and Alice reconcile, something that happens as the result of many absurd and delightful adventures along the way to their reunion.

There are various sub-plots that occur, mostly involving some of Marc's friends and relatives. The Afro-Gallic character, Jean-Georges (acted by Joey Starr) has perhaps the most amusing one. This womaniser suddenly falls in love with his male surfing instructor (Thomas Jouannet). The two men unite by means of a colourfully New-Age surf-themed gay wedding over which one very wacky guru, babbling gibberish, absurdly presides.

This film is endlessly inventive, spewing fun and froth at the entranced viewer in just about every unexpected way imaginable. Some music lovers will be pleased not only that Marc's favourite songwriter is Michel Legrand, but that Legrand actually makes an appearance in the movie, seen playing the piano and singing his own music. For some viewers, Anglophones who are too staid or stolid of temperament to enjoy this movie's antic revels, it may be ""just a bit too much"" for their taste, but for others ""L'Amour dure trois ans"" will be the comedy discovery of the year in which they encounter it!",1424131200,,4362,5.11938202247191
