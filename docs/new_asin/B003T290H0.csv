8404945,5,B003T290H0,"This series i just like hana yori dango. It was based on an anime but the live action series is 10 times much better!!!

You're Under Arrest chronicles the adventures of Bokuto Precinct's dynamic duo of Miyuki Kobayakawa and Natsumi Tsujimoto, as they go above and beyond the law to solve any criminal case and send the bad guys where they belong.
Whether it deals with a pair of bus-hijacking bank robbers, a case of mysterious wedding deaths, or an obsessive bomber, Miyuki and Natsumi are always on the job!

So bottom line if you want a funny and good series based on ridiculous police situations this is for you!",1305763200,2,617,4.6
