2223791,2,B0007OCG6K,"To say this film is poorly acted is an understatement. To say that the sasquatch cgi monsters are terrible is an understatement. Those B-grade 1970's bigfoot films like Creature From Black Lake and the Boggy Creek series are FAR better than this stinker -- a shame in this age of modern technology and film making. The movie's story isn't half-bad, but its execution was a disaster. This one is for bigfoot movie fans ONLY, and then only if you can get it cheap. Dog crap on a stick!",1126569600,5,483,4.5

2223793,1,B0007OCG6K,"This is the kind of trash that causes people to laugh at the Bigfoot/Sasquatch buffs and researchers and why no one will ever take the subject serious. As if the Jonas Quastel direceted/Lance Henrickson starring ""Sasquatch"" put out by Columbia Tri-star a couple of years ago wasn't bad enough, they(CTS)had to go and release another awful Sasquatch film. I know that there has been some ridiculously awful B movies made about the genre in the past, but, you would think in this day and age of technology and money that somebody could finally make a good realistic Bigfoot flick. But, this film is why no big name studio or director will take the chance. The plot is okay, I guess, I can buy the fact that a group of park rangers is hired to guide a couple of scientists into the deep woods looking for bones of an unknown species that had also been found by a couple of trappers many, many years ago, we learn this in the first few minutes of the film, but after that it goes WAY down hill. The acting is awful, I guess that is why it is called a ""B-Movie"" and you get what you pay for. They even had to throw in a steriotypical staple of all B-Movies, the big breasted blonde, who must take a bag shower every morning in a skimpy bikini showing all of her assets to the male park rangers. Then probably the worst thing of all in this film is the CGI created Sasquatches. The animation is terrible and at times the Sasquatches look more like cartoon characters than an unknown hairy bi-pedal primate. And then in the end, fleeing from a colony of actors dressed up in gorilla suites, our heroes end up finding shelter in an old cabin that was originally inhabited by the trappers we learned about in the beginning of the film. Oh, the irony. Anyway, I guess as a Bigfoot enthusiast I should be happy at the fact that some one at least took the time to make a film about the subject, but, I can't get get past being p*##%d off at the way they went about it. If you like low budget horror films you can get a laugh from, like most of the brain-less, responsibility-less teenagers today, then you will love this film. If you are a Bigfoot/Sasquatch enthusiast, don't waste your time, I already did.",1115856000,11,2195,4.395577395577396
2223794,4,B0007OCG6K,"I've been a fan of horror films and Sasquatch since I was kid. Was at Best Buy the other week and saw this movie on DVD. The cover of the DVD looked exactly like another Bigfoot movie that came out over a year ago or so, called just plain ""Sasquatch"", but I discovered it was indeed another new Bigfoot movie. I read the synopsis knowing nothing at all about it and bought it. Popped it in the player later that night and I must say it was the best Bigfoot/monster movie that's ever been made. Yeah, this is a monster movie, not some back to nature Bigfoot flick. I say it's about time someone showed Bigfoot picking up people and ripping them apart. LOL! We've seen him stick his hand in bathroom windows (Legend of Boggy Creek), drag airplane fuselages through the woods (Sasquatch) and comically destroy a families living room (Harry and the Henderson's). In this flick we see him pick a guy up by the legs and swing him like a log into a tree - KAPOW! This Bigfoot kicks major ass and doesn't like people at all. Yeah, in alot of scene's we're basically dealing with a guy in a fur suit (with a CGI face), but it's still fun stuff, like the old days of Creature Features. There is some total CGI moments of the creature, that although not the best, is still darn entertaining (this isn't Spielberg budget here, so give the film a break). It's a horror B-movie, so one should not expect too much. That's what horror B-movies are all about. So, suspend your disbelief, turn out the lights and creep out to a cool Sasquatch movie that shows the big hairy guy getting mad, crazy and busting human butt. I liked this flick. If you're a Sasquatch/monster flick kinda guy, buy this DVD. It's plain fun at it's best. Way better than ""Sasquatch"" with Lance Hedrickson (the worst Bigfoot movie ever - don't waste your time with this one at all - the Bigfoot looks more like SwampThing, and he's boring to boot).",1114560000,6,1905,4.43019943019943
2223795,1,B0007OCG6K,"I have watched most of the rare and dated Sasquatch movies that have been made since the sixties and this is probably the absolute worst.  Not only because the plot, acting, direction, and special effects are horrific, but because it is so unbelieveably unrealistic.  For example, there is a scene where one of the characters shoots a bigfoot with a 9mm round (one round!) and it kills one of the 8 foot tall, 500 lbs beasts.  The story of the film, according to the DVD jacket, says that it is supposed to take place in the American Northwest.  This movie looks like it was filmed in Texas!  If you do watch the movie you will see the trees and forest is very similar to west/central Texas, NOT Washington State!

The Bigfoot CGI is so cheesy that it looks much more like a cartoon than anything.  The ""roars"" of the beasts are clearly lion roars and NOT anything close to a real sasquatch.  This is not a scary movie, even though it tries to make itself such.  I almost turned it off after watching it for five minutes, but decided to tough it out and see how bad it really was.

Though what is more sad I think is that others here gave this incredibly aweful movie such good reviews.  These reviewers must be related to the director or in the movie itself to mindlessly praise such a poor film as this.  The information that this film presents of bigfoot is certainly not based on any real research or investigation.

Any real ""sasquatch hunters"" who actually take their research seriously will be extremely disappointed in this movie.  Not just because they make bigfoot out to be a mindless monster who can be killed with one 9mm round, but because it basically makes fun of the real research that true bigfoot investigators do throughout North America.

One last thing, the ""anthropologists"" in the movie and the rest of the ""hunters"" never know what the moster is that attacks them.  Only one time does someone casually mention the word ""Bigfoot"" (the word ""Sasquatch"" was never even used in the movie by the characters) and even after that all the people running for their lives still have no clue as to what ""IT"" is that is chasing them.  So at the end of the movie they are as ignorant about what the creature was as they were in the beginning.  THATS HOW BAD THIS MOVIE IS.",1114473600,5,2284,4.502427184466019
2223796,4,B0007OCG6K,"I thought the film was a fun monster B-movie with a decent plot and acting that I'd say was above average for a low budget film such as this.

For the sake of the review I did finish watching it.  Apparently, many other reviewers found something to like here, I was not able to find it.  Beyond the stale plot lines, sometimes funny dialog, and boring premise (you know, a bunch of campers go to the woods and get hacked up by a machete weilding maniac, oops, I mean a big hairy multi-clawed bipedal maniac), I just felt it was boring.",1281657600,,567,4.63
2223801,4,B0007OCG6K,"As a devoted lover of B-movies, I have seen more than my share of Bigfoot films, and despite being another low-budget Yeti flick, ""Sasquatch Hunters"" is not without its unique charms. It is far from the worst Bigfoot movie I have ever seen, and managed to keep my interest for 88 minutes.

The film opens with three buffoons hunting something in the woods with pistols, when they run afoul of Sasquatch, who is none too happy to see them. Bigfoot makes short work of them, and even had the good graces to kill the most annoying character first. After the title sequence we meet up with a group of students and professors who want to go into the woods to look for bones, and the group of forest rangers there to keep them safe, headed by former ranger and obvious hero Matt Lattimore. The cast includes brother and sister forest rangers (Spencer and Janet) who both have difficulties keeping their hormones under control to no avail. For a monster-in-the-woods movie there is amazing restraint on the romantic subplot front.

As the cast walks through the woods the tasteful score swells in the background to the point it's distracting. The music is actually well done (especially for a film on this kind of budget) but is overly loud and intrusive at times, and even more annoyingly frequently crescendos when absolutely nothing significant is happening; it seems to get better after the first half hour or so, but maybe I just adapted to it. For a film of this nature the script isn't bad, although there are some ridiculous lines (""Maybe it's one of those man-bear things!""), which is probably unavoidable given the subject matter. I was also quite amused by the discussion about how dense the forest was, despite the fact that there are veritable wide boulevards carved out of the foliage on the trails they're following.

The researchers stumble on the sacred Yeti cemetery (actually, ""Yeti Cemetery"" would be a great name for a movie, but I digress) and the academics are gleeful at the cornucopia of bones they have unearthed. Very shortly thereafter they discover a bear carcass in a tree and wonder how it got there. Without further ado, cast members start disappearing, mercifully starting with the hormonally-challenged Spencer and Janet. An interesting note here is that despite the presence of several lovely female cast members, most notably Lou (Juliana Dever), the director never resorts to nudity, although there is plenty of adult language and violence. I was genuinely surprised by that.

The real violence begins at night when the Bigfoot gets the cast split up in the woods and starts picking them off. Sometimes the Bigfoot appears to be all digital, and sometimes it is clearly a guy in a gorilla suit with a CGI face, but for a B-movie the effects are certainly passable. The Bigfoot is actually pretty scary, and can run much faster and more quietly than I would have expected. The cast finds an old trapper's shelter surrounded by bear traps and stay there during the evening's Bigfoot siege. At this point two things become clear: first, there is more than one Bigfoot in the woods, and second, the name of the movie is ""Sasquatch Hunters"" because the Sasquatch are hunting the humans, not named for the group of humans hunting the Sasquatch. I liked that subtlety, and I liked the fact that even the prettiest girl isn't immune from Bigfoot attack.

The nighttime Bigfoot stalking scenes are quite atmospheric, work well in context, and set up the grand finale for the next morning when the battered survivors hike to their jeep and are pursued by a whole pack of Bigfoots (Bigfeet?), barely escaping, while managing to kill several Sasquatch in the process. Fittingly the movie concludes back at the Yeti cemetery with a funeral for their fallen comrades, another touch I liked.

Don't misunderstand me: this film will never be confused with a big-budget science fiction theatrical release and the special effects budget was not large, but for entertainment purposes I found it to be rather enjoyable. The cast was generally likeable, the script had a concept of continuity, the acting was not bad (if a bit hammy on occasion), the cinematography was much better than the budget would imply, and the Sasquatch is adequately scary. There are many big-budget movies that aren't half this entertaining, and because the cast plays it completely straight, this works as an effective old fashioned lost-in-the-woods monster movie. It's less campy than I expected, but that's fine: it does what it set out to do.",1268006400,5,4533,4.888166449934981
2223802,5,B0007OCG6K,"When I say that this movie was enjoyable, let me make clear that ""enjoyable"" is pretty different from ""good."" This movie is so amazingly bad that I loved every second of it.

It begins with three streotypically redneckish guys stumbling around a forest, tossing some horrible fake redneckish accents around. These three don't really contribute to the story at all, although in a better movie they would probably ""set the stage"" for Bigfoot's rampage later on, or something.

The rest of the movie is a combination of several elements:

-Long, extended shots of trees, or trees with people walking through them, accompanied by 30 seconds of very 'Free Willy'/typical-epic-journey-ish music played on a loop for about 5 minutes.
-A scene between two female characters meant to show their sympathy towards each other in a time of despair, but which comes across as very sexually tense
-A token hot chick taking a shower, for no real purpose
-15 minutes of shots of talking heads around a campfire discussing the Bigfoot, which could have been condensed into about 15 seconds.
--Spectacular, incredible, blockbuster special effects are something of which this movie is completely devoid. They're downright funny.
-Lots of swears thrown in to compensate for the movie's lack of anything interesting
-Some actor named Matthew Tait running around in what looks like a big, black shag rug with a gorilla mask
-A final stand-off which several Sasquatch in which the heroine gets very realistically thrown about 500 feet, only to be caught deftly by the hero, who proceeds to shoot 3 previously-nearly-indestructable Sasquatch dead in their tracks, suddenly becoming an expert marksman after missing the 823 previous times.
-A last line of dialogue in which one of the leading characters calls the heroine, Helen, ""Debbie"" for no real reason. I was wondering about this line for a while; if the name ""Debbie"" had ever popped up in the movie before, that would have been one thing, but it hadn't.
-An eerie final shot of what must be Sasquatch burying their dead, although it just shows some dirt being tossed on another heap of dirt. I think the point is that the Sasquatch are laying in wait for 'Sasquatch Hunters II', but it's hard to be sure.

I could go on, but the point is, you need to buy this movie, invite over some friends, and watch it for yourself. I consider it a roaring success, although I doubt my opinion towards the movie is anything like what the directors would hope for.

This is one of my new favorite films.",1222560000,2,2521,4.880841121495327
2223803,3,B0007OCG6K,"Possibly the worst diologue in a ""B"" Bigfoot movie ever. I love the musical soundtrack which emulates Dances with Wolves at times. You get this big epic musical score put to treking through the forest with nothing happening. Typlifies the rest of the movie. If you are making a rated R bigfoot movie of this calibre, it really demands some gratuitous sexual content to get through the tough times which is 88 minutes worth. A few Violent scenes by big hairy CGI Monsters and using the F Bomb highlites this tale of a group of scientists searching for North American Ape Bones. Tagging along are a few forest rangers, (God only knows why) a girl with a huge rack that takes pictures and showers in the woods with her swim suit on. Next we have the standard Hero, Hunk, Stud Hunter that leads the team to their destination and does nothing but complain about his baby sitting job. Once there, things go bad pretty fast. Do I like this movie you ask? Hell Yes! Bad is Good in this case once again. How cool is it to have drive-in movies! Very! There are some good creepy moments and much of it is filmed in the dark which exagerates the tension and ""terror""!

2223804,3,B0007OCG6K,"Unlike most Cheap Movies i actually liked this one. I didn't just sit til the end i actually enjoyed it. The film is A Hundred time better tha Sasquatch or Sasquatch Mountain. The film is short however so the story is a lot simpler.

They make it to the cars with three of them left and high-tail it out in the jeep. They still have one of the bones. It ends with a roar in the forest and fades into the credits.

The Film lasts about 89 Minutes in total but holds plenty of fun scares and awesome Big-Foot action. The suits they used are the best i have seen yet that are not CGI creatures. They also have a Lot of Them. I counted at least 6 Big Foot Creatures.",1212364800,2,1279,4.174089068825911
2223805,4,B0007OCG6K,"""Sasquatch Hunters"" is a 2005 straight-to-video low-budget Bigfoot flick. To appreciate it one must realize this going in. Why do I mention this? Because of the heavy criticism  of many of the other reviewers. C'mon, it's a freakin' Grade-B Bigfoot flick, what did these grumblers expect -- ""Apocalypse Now""?

Let's face it, there aren't that many Bigfoot films out there. ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" (1972) is a bore; ""Sasquatch, the Legend of Bigfoot"" (1977) the so-called 'Holy Grail of Bigfoot films' is an okay psuedo-documentary from back then; ""Snowbeast"" (1977) is decent for a ""Jaws"" ripoff TV film of that era; ""Sasquatch"" aka ""The Untold"" (2002) is barely passable (as they overdid it with the annoying fade-to-black effect); lastly, ""Sasquatch Mountain"" and ""Abominable"" (both from 2006) are quite good even though I don't like the lack of realism regarding the creature in the latter film.

So what about ""Sasquatch Hunters""?

THE PLOT: A handful of scientists want to investigate the possibility of some strange gorilla bones and are joined by four rangers and a security guide. They hike for days into the forests and discover a burial ground of the gorilla bones. The problem is that the creatures still exist and don't like people messing with their ""sacred"" grave site.

WHAT WORKS: First of all, I like the fact that this is a serious film. There's no comedy, goofiness or camp to be found.

Secondly, the characters are likable, which is something another reviewer noted as well. This is important because if you like the characters you're more likely to care what happens to them.

Some criticize the acting, but I feel it generally comes off realistic. Let's keep in mind that many in the expedition are meeting each other for the first time. The characters fittingly act like a group of people awkwardly getting to know each other. The F-word is thrown around a few times but certainly no more than in real life; besides, when the creature attacks and the horrifying deaths start mounting up it's to be expected.

The cast features three highly likable women. Amy Shelton-White plays the scientist Dr. Helen, essentially the heroine of the tale. She may look like the girl next door but she's actually quite attractive. Then there's Lou, the sexy petite blond college girl who's documenting the expedition, played by the stunningly gorgeous Juliana Dever. And, yes, she has a brief shower scene at the creek (albeit in a bikini, so don't expect nudity). Lastly there's the naive, meek and kinda-cute young ranger woman, Janet, played by Stacey Branscombe. Janet comes off ultra-sweet, but doesn't seem like she even belongs in the forest like a real ranger.

Another positive is the location. The film was shot entirely at Topanga State Park in the Santa Monica Mountains in western Los Angeles (of all places), which is notable as the biggest wilderness area of any major city in the entire world. The forest foliage is just dense enough to give the proper wilderness impression while sparse enough for the viewer to see what's going on. I'm sure it made filming easier as well.

Some criticize that the score is too epic, melodramatic and LOUD. It's true that the ""epic"" part is too loud in the first half hour (as they're trekking trough the forest), but overall I appreciate it. Some parts are reminiscent of the original ""Planet of the Apes,"" which is a good thing as far as I'm concerned. The best and most surprising part of the score is played over the end credits, a potent and pleasant quasi-classical piece. Needless to say, I wasn't expecting this in a low-budget Bigfoot flick. It gives the film a touch of class, as if the filmmakers were at least trying for something greater than the limitations of a direct-to-video monster flick.

Some criticize the appearance of the creature(s). The film deviates from real-life accounts and other film depictions of Sasquatch in that the creature here is just a big shaggy gorilla, albeit really fast, almost like a super gorilla, which is reminiscent of the super wolves in ""Wolfen."" Some shots are obviously total CGI and you can tell, but other shots are of actors in gorilla suits with CGI faces. In any event, the creature looks fine for a straight-to-video flick. What were these complainers expecting -- ""Juassic Park"" quality? I like what they came up with.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK: There's an overlong and meandering night sequence that starts near the 45-minute mark and lasts a full half hour, which is about 1/3 of the runtime (88 minutes). Usually, the problem with night sequences like this is that it's too hard to see what's going on, but they did a pretty good job with the lighting here. Although this sequence is a negative it does add an air of horrific mystery and the last 7 minutes take place in a shack lighted well enough to see what's going on.

During this shack scene Helen looks at the pictures on the digital camera that she retrieved from the body of one of the group members. It turns out that this person got a picture of one of the creatures before the beast fatally attacked. Helen and the professor passingly look at the picture with barely any interest while the other guys don't care to view it at all. Just think, this is the first clear photo of Bigfoot ever taken or seen; and it's a terrifying shot. Don't you think they'd be more excited or interested in the photo, especially the scientists? Like, ""Whoa, so that's Sasquatch!"" ""That's the beast that's stalking and killing us!"" ""He really exists!"" I suppose one could argue that they're more concerned at this point with simply surviving and are likely in shock, but the simple fact is that the scene comes off unbelievable.

FINAL ANALYSIS: The film is called ""Sasquatch Hunters"" not because the people are hunting Sasquatch but rather because Sasquatch is hunting THEM. Bigfoot here is not a gentle giant, he's an angry monster killing machine. This is actually one of the better Bigfoot films out there. The material is taken seriously, the cast is likable and believable, the women are attractive, the locations are great, the score is surprisingly classy (albeit too loud/epic in a couple spots early on) and the adventure is fairly engaging.

Say what you want, but I'd pop in ""Sasquatch Hunters"" before any of the ""Jurassic Park"" flicks, even though the latter films are better on every technical level. ""Sasquatch Hunters"" is a picture filmed on spit, chewing gum and home-movie enthusiasm. It's may not be great but it must be given 4/5 Stars for its numerous positive qualities (or at least 3/5 Stars). Some would call it a guilty pleasure, others call it a piece of crap; I can't help but respect it.

Yeah,okay,the cgi was TOO cgi,but come,this is a movie about a big hairy,hungry sasquatch guys! If you 're thinking harry and the hendersons,well then,you WILL hate this movie! Here is good old fashion entertainment. I know other reviewers have bombed this movie,but I liked it. At certain points of the movie,when the expedition is walking through the forest,I got the feeling I'd seen the movie before.

What I want to know is,who had the idea that this was a documentary about bigfoot?!!!Come on mates,let's over look this,and enjoy the bloody movie! No one knows how sasquatch would react if it encountered us on his terms. I doubt,if it would be a warm and fuzzy feeling for us. From what I heard and read,the scream ALONE would make you run away from it...probably making US run away screaming like school girls!

One thing that has me a little confused with this film and other's of this type is when the the actors are in almost clear open ground with only a few trees and these big sasquatches can remain hidden only to appear from no where and the people didn't see the sasquatch coming and therefore they get their heads removed, maybe the director is adding a supernatural element to the move, then it makes sence. Having a big boobed blond in a movie is always a must...in every movie! ( SMILE )

For future sasquatch movies I would like the film makers to get out more and research the subject in greater detail, talk to people who have experienced the sasquatch and also search the web, there's plenty of information out there and use it, regardless of how strange the information may seem, this subject is after all very strange.

2223808,2,B0007OCG6K,"You know, low budget doesn't have to mean lousy.  Spending a Brinks truck-load of money never hurts when it comes to production values, but a little sense and decent writing would go a long way.

A group of scientists, forest rangers, and a blonde bombshell hanger-on march into the north woods to investigate the source of some big bones a museum uncovered.  It finds a Bigfoot burial ground, disturbs it (not knowing what it was), and thus kindles the wrath of the big, BIG apes.  But for pete's sake, the burial ground area is a plot about the size of my modest living room in between a few trees, with the ""mounds"" for these huge beasts being about 18 inches high.  Couldn't the movie makers have at least spent a couple of hours piling some dirt up?

The dialogue is very trite, but that's not necessarily a wholehearted criticism.  Most of us talk that way in everyday life.  But would you natter on about who's at fault and the need for self-credit while you sling your firearm over your shoulder in the middle of the night with shredded bodies piling up around you?  Or completely ignore the beastie who literally just seconds before turned the blonde babe into blonde hash so you can hug each other and express regrets?

The guns sound like wet ladyfinger firecrackers, the old cabin that what's left of the group takes shelter in looks about as sturdy as a cardboard box (and yet it's kept the sasquatches at bay for 90 years), and on and on.

Incidentally, the brunette scientist is both prettier than the blonde and has better legs.  It's the latter's huge bust that not only gets everyone to talking, but must also have made the sasquatches wonder what was wrong  with their own women.

2223810,2,B0007OCG6K,"Sasquatch Hunters

A group of researchers and forest rangers hike into the dense Pacific Northwest wilderness in search of bones of an unknown primate thought to inhabit the area in prehistoric times. They discover a burial ground and bones. Huge bones. They also discover that the prehistoric primates still exist, and they are steaming mad.

Complete with a paleontology professor who shares a resemblance to well known cryptozoologist Loren Coleman, and a token hottie along for the ride to document their findings, Sasquatch Hunters is overall not a bad movie, but the CG monster effects leave a lot to be desired. Very poor visual effects.

A better creature effect may have been produced with good old foam latex and traditional makeup effects techniques, even simple puppetry with a monster head may have worked better in some scenes. The monster didn't always fit in properly with the surroundings. In fact, the film might have been more effective if less monster was shown.

The characters were decent, and the acting was okay for the most part, but there were a few stiff moments and downright dopey exchanges between characters. Nice cinematography though; nice locations and scenery, including the blond.

There were some pretty decent action scequences too, except for the unnecessary roll-shoot-and-run stunt performed ineffectively by one of the characters as he ran from one of the creatures. It was moronic because the sole purpose for that kind of move is to avoid being hit by bullets, and Bigfoot don't carry guns!

The scoring worked well in some spots, particularly the suspenseful, creepy scenes, but I think it was mostly overdone and very campy at times. Not the best score. It actually detracted from the film.

Those who hold the Sasquatch phenomenon close at heart feel the creature was wrongly depicted as evil, and that this film gives real Bigfoot (if they exist) a bad reputation. They feel that cinemagoers and DVD renters will be misled into believing Bigfoot are bad creatures, when in fact most people don't even believe in them in the first place. Hey, it's a monster movie, and there is really no need to worry about about Bigfoot stereotyping.

In all not a bad idea, too bad they didn't have a bigger budget. At times Sasquatch Hunters was a bit boring, but I must say that there were moments in which I found myself being somewhat drawn in to the story, and some of the back stories. It was an okay movie but for the reasons cited above I wouldn't watch it again.

We need someone with a bigger budget to tackle the Sasquatch idea.",1166313600,,2572,4.867276887871854
2223811,2,B0007OCG6K,"Well, having seen most of the movies inspired by Bigfoot, I have to say this one in very sub-par. It starts out with poachers commenting on the size of a dung pile while drinking some cheap beer then getting trashed by big ugly. One guy is torn to shreds, one guy is chased down WHILE CARRYING A LOADED GUN THAT HE NEVER FIRES, and the last escapes. Later he sees the 2nd party of nosey bodies but is tackled by the creature and slammed into a tree before he calls for help. The creature roars in victory then spies the others WHO WERE ABOUT 40-50 FEET AWAY AND DID NOT HEAR ANY OF THIS OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOREST WHERE IT IS FAIRLY QUIET AND YOU COULD HEAR PETER GRIFFIN FART 2 MILES AWAY. Needless to say, most of the movie is full stupid moves, like when the sister of a missing Ranger goes off on her own to find out what that noise was she heard in the dark AFTER THEY HAD BEEN ATTACKED BY THE CREATURE, what an idiot, bad scenes, like when the idiot girl screams and the hero dude says ""Stay here."" but they all dispurse into 3 little groups after they hear the creature roar, and the dude that is the fly in the ointment constantly arguing with the hero WHEN HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE WATCHING FOR THE CREATURE THROUGH A WINDOW BUT TURNS HIS BACK ON THE OPEN WINDOW TIME AFTER TIME AND FINALLY IS SNATCHED BY ONE AND DRAGGED OUTSIDE TO MEET HIS DOOM. The night seen was played out about 15 minutes too long and could have saved me a little grief if it had just got to the point. The scariest part in the movie was expected with the babe of the movie using her digital cam to light her way by taking pictures to see where she was only to  photogragh one of the creatures before her most unwanted doom. The best looking chick in the whole movie and she is ripped to shreds, what a waste. Anyway, when they finally make it to the jeep the next day, thats when it got corny. The CGI creatures were horrible, the others in suits looked more like chimps than bigfoots, bigfeets.....other creatures. Gimme a break. I don't know the plural for bigfoot. All in all, I would not buy this movie, but I would watch it if I had a choice between it or watching ""The 700 Club"" but I would have to think real hard as to which was the most torture. I gave 2 stars because I have yet to see another movie worse than Battlefield Earth which is the only movie I have given 1 star.",1162512000,,2367,4.134490238611714
2223812,5,B0007OCG6K,"This is about some archaeologists who, guided by some forest rangers, hike back into the mountains to investigate some odd bones that they have in their museum.  The bones were brought in by some trappers who lived in the area many years ago.  Overall, these folks are a very likable bunch.  Some of the acting is a tad cheesy, and one guy is prone to speaking in a monotone, but I'm so used to watching low budget movies where I couldn't care less if everyone gets killed (half the time I'm cheering for them to die in some horrible way), that I was impressed that I actually cared about these folks and didn't want to see them get killed.

Once in the mountains, they discover some burial mounds and dig up the bones of, yup, you guessed it, Sasquatch!  Well, turns out the Sasquatch don't like people messing with their graveyard, and a night of terror ensues.  I really liked this part of the movie, all the cheesiness is gone and it gets very serious.  It's done quite well, with nice night photography in the forest, good theme music, good dialogue, and good performances from the actors.  I remember when I was in the Cub Scouts and the counselors told a scary story around the campfire, then somebody jumped out of the trees and we all scattered.  Being little kids, we fell for it hook line and sinker.  This part of the movie brought back memories of that.  Yes, the CGI Sasquatch do look pretty bad in certain scenes, but overall I'd say they look good.  It allows them to be very large and move quickly, a nice change from the usual guy in a suit that, because of the bulky suit, looks hilarious trying to keep up with his intended victims.

Overall, I'd definitely recommend this to lovers of low budget movies.  You even get a busty babe taking a shower in a bikini.",1152662400,10,1780,4.436923076923077

2223814,2,B0007OCG6K,"Beware of the fuzzy CGI creatures that lurk in the woods.
This movie could have been a little better if they would have fired the music composer.
The film soundtrack in this movie is so annoying and inappropriate that is just makes it worse. The film score sounds like it was written for scenes that would have Moses Parting the Red Sea but they use it when they show just a few people walking through the weeds.
Also, the music sounds like it was performed by some high school band from somewhere in Montana.
What this movie seriously needed was a few gallons of blood.  Why?, to just turn it into a splatter gore fest or slice and dice because what this film is, just doesnt work.
The acting is pathetic and just downright wrong.  Also,if you are going to make Bigfoot a violent monster, give us some good quality kills for goodness sake. Especially if its going straight to DVD. Lets have him rip someones head off or pound them into a bloody pulp. Get out the blood and gore make-up crew and have them turn it up a few notches!
Avoid this one and check out ""Saquatch-Triple feature DVD"" instead.",1139702400,2,1099,4.435643564356436

seems like a late 70's early 80's horror film,slow pace few people get killed off here there. Then it hits them everyone has to flee to survive.

2223816,3,B0007OCG6K,"On one fateful day, me and my friends decided to rent Sasquatch Hunters. There was nothing else mind you so we just stuck with that.

Now, we knew what we were in for. Stale acting, bad direction, your basic B-movie. Well lemme tell you, we got more than we bargain for.

First off, the story itself is pretty weak. I know this because i still don't know what its about. But what i can tell you is that there is a team of scientists and a team of rangers going into the woods.

The very first scene sold us on the movie. The sasquatch grabs a hunter by the legs and swings him into a tree. Now it may not sound stupid, but the special fx its done with make it all the more funny.

Speaking of special fx, the fx in the movie suck. A lot. They are to the point where its comical.

This movie has some of the worst acting i have seen. One guy has trouble acting dead. When he is killed by the sasquatch he is covered with a sheet. When we see the sheet covered body you can see the sheet rising and lowering because the actor is breathing.

Another guy is being stalked by the sasquatch. They guy doesn't know this of course but he still has his gun ready. The sasquatch pops out about 30 ft behind him and roars. So what does the guy do? He runs 5 feet, does a flip, gets up and fires his gun to the left of him into some trees. This scene is the best in the whole movie in my opinion.

The movie is quite boring though. Thre are parts where the movie drones on for too damn long. But when the action comes its well worth it.

Overall this movie is definitely a renter. The fact that all this is going on with actors with straight faces makes it too awesome to pass up.",1132617600,6,1668,4.018126888217522

8049499,4,B0007OCG6K,"In a world full of low-budget Bigfoot movies, Sasquatch Hunters stands pretty tall among its peers.  Some may complain about the special effects (a combination of CGI and costumes), but I thought they were pretty good.  More importantly, the acting is excellent and the script is quite good  and surprisingly serious.  Okay, the main characters background is mentioned but never explored, but theres very little cheesy dialogue and the characters continually react in believable ways to the frightening situations they find themselves in.  Also, unlike most Bigfoot movies, the story doesnt cram the whole Bigfoot thing down your throat.  Heck, three-fourths of the way through, the characters are still trying to figure out just what they're up against.  I only remember hearing the word Bigfoot once, and the films original title was Primeval rather than Sasquatch Hunters.  Of course, the latter title really poses the question as to just who is hunting whom here.

Apparently, it takes five rangers to escort three scientists deep into the woods in search of unusual bones or fossils.  The discovery of an unidentifiable, gorilla-like bone matching a decades-old sample in museum archives sends paleontologist Helen Gilbert (Amy Shelton-White), anthropologist Ethan Edwards (Gary Sturm), and a student photographer on a quest to find more evidence of the mysterious creature.  Former Ranger Roger Gordon (Matt Lattimore) joins his old boss and three young Rangers on the mission.  After a couple of days hiking, the group arrives at the investigation area, where they find a burial mound stocked with unusual big bones  possibly an undiscovered relative of Gigantopithecus, according to the anthropologist.  Unfortunately, something in the woods also discovers the party of humans  something big, dark, hairy, loud, and seriously pissed off.  The excitement of the scientific discovery soon turns to fear as these intelligent creatures begin to make their displeasure crystal clear.

The film is almost completely free of campiness, which is why the story plays so well.  I genuinely liked the characters and did not want to see any of them harmed.  Theres some harmless flirting early on, but theres no nudity or sexual overtones to distract from the story.  Theres not much in the way of gore, either  although a poacher does meet his end in a rather enjoyable way at the very beginning.  Most of the real action takes place at night.  The lighting is well done, allowing you to actually see what is going on while still preserving a strong were being hunted and picked off one by one by Bigfoot in the middle of the woods at night feel throughout.  I also liked the fact that no one really comes out and says its Bigfoot.  The whole subject matter is treated here with a level of seriousness you won't find in most films of this genre.
