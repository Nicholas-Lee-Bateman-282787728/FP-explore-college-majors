7797525,4,1572523549,"My Story is good apart from a rather annoying format and the use of a small size screen-within-the-screen for some rare fight footage. It includes a surprising section in which Jackie admits to having put his film career above his family and friendships. Like My Stunts, Jackies warmth as an individual shines through and the action footage (including out-takes where it went wrong) is consistently amazing.",1505347200,2,407,5.181818181818182

7797528,3,1572523549,"While I did enjoy watching the film, being an avid Jackie Chan fan I found that the information that I recieved in the film was not anything I did not know before.  I was also quite disapointed by the cheaply created opening and cut scenes.  The voice over for some of the injury videos was also quite appaling.

If you don't know much about Jackie Chan though it has some very interesting parts about his injuries and most dangerous stunts.

I would have liked him to go more indepth about his family life and  history in the Chinese Opera School though.
