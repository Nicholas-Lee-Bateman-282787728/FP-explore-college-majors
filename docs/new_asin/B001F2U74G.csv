8300755,5,B001F2U74G,this is good if you have played the game. because it is a much abridged version. it will make more sense if you have played the game.,1303776000,,133,3.962962962962963
8300756,3,B001F2U74G,i have to say tales of phantasia is one of my favorite games. Having said that i can't honestly recommend this anime to anyone who isn't a fan of the game. the story jumps around alot and it's hard to follow even for someone familiar with the game. If you're looking for something to watch that's anime there are better choices. If you're a hardcore fan of the game then perhaps you'll enjoy this.,1291680000,,397,4.378378378378378
8300757,4,B001F2U74G,"This DVD contains all the anime's episodes (which is only 4 of them). I had played the game on the GBA and had always wondered what the characters would sound like.

When I finally watched the anime, boy was I in for a surprise. True that some of the characters like Cress, Chester and Mint I could imagine them sounding like they did, but others like Arche and Claus surprised me (but in a good way).

Just a fair warning, it doesn't cover the whole game like one would think, and there seems to be a major gap between episode 1 and 2. But if you've played the game, you'll understand what's going on. If you're a fan of the game, buy it.",1247097600,,639,4.186991869918699
8300758,3,B001F2U74G,"When i first heard about the Tales of Phantasia OVA, I was pretty interested. But what I saw gave me a rather mixed reaction. The Animation and Music may be quite nice, but the compression of the story is where the problem with this anime lie. You see, this anime is based on an RPG game that was first released on the SNES, before getting remaked onto the PSX. So what clearly should have been at least 26 episodes in length, instead became 4. This resulted in major skipping around in the story, confussing those that have never played the video game it was based on.

While I must admit I did enjoy what we did get to see, I am afraid that I can only recommend it for fans of the game. Everyone else will probably not enjoy it, thanks to all of the skipping in the story. But if that sort of thing does not bother you, then go right ahead. But I would prefer to use my money elsewhere.

All in all, I give this anime a 3/5 stars.",1230422400,,932,4.115384615384615
