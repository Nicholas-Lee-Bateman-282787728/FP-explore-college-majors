1182560,5,B0000040EK,"On the one hand I want to say that I think ""A Night at the Opera"" is the greatest Marx Brothers comedy because their peculiar brand of lunacy works better when given a real world target such as Opera than in the fantasy land of Freedonia in ""Duck Soup.""  On the other hand I want to say that I think ""A Night at the Opera"" has more funny stuff in it than ""Duck Soup.""  I do not even want to begin to get into any consideration of what difference the retirement of Zeppo meant in all this.  I just want to laugh my head off.
Groucho is Otis P. Driftwood, too busy trying to fleece Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont) to waste time running an Opera Company.  Harpo is Tomasso, the much abused valet to the pompous tenor Rudolpho Lassparri (Walter Woolf King), while Chico is Fiorello, self-appointed agent for the unknown but talent young singer Ricardo Baroni (Allan Jones), who is in love with Rosa Castaldi (Kitty Carlisle).  When Groucho loses his job to stuffed shirt Herman Gottlieb (Sig Ruman), it is up to the Marx Brothers to restore order and sanity to the universe.
In terms of classic comic routines ""A Night at the Opera"" gives you (1) the Stateroom scene with all those people (and don't forget the hardboiled eggs); (2) Groucho and Chico discussing the clauses in a contract (including the Sanity Clause); (3) Chico and Harpo working ""Take Me Out to the Ballgame"" into the overture of the opera (get your peanuts); (4) a dinner date between Groucho and Margaret Dumont (looking at him is the price you have to pay); and (5) Chico the Russian aviator explaining how they flew across the Atlantic Ocean in a boat (always remember to take enough gas or else you will have to turn back).  There are more-you now Chico plays the piano, Harpo plays the harp, and Groucho deflates a pompous windbag at some point--but I want to talk about other things now.
I think the person who really helps sell this film is Kitty Carlisle.  In every Marx brother movie there are the boys, there is Margaret Dumont as the foil, and then there are the young boy and girl who sing their way into your hearts.  Carlisle and Jones (the only boy singer to appear in more than one Marx Brothers movie) are clearly the best pair to ever take on these thankless roles.  The boys clearly like her and take her seriously, which she does in return, giving ""A Night at the Opera"" a sense of heart.  This does not happen in Marx Brothers movies (compare it to the campy efforts of the young lovers in ""Animal Crackers"").  On top of all this, Carlisle and Jones can sing and their duet from the end of Il Travatore is much better than all the sappy songs that the lovers usually sing in these films.
""A Night at the Opera"" is directed by Sam Wood (who would later spend some time directing scenes on that ""Gone With the Wind"" film you hear so much about).  James Kevin McGuineess receives story credit but the key thing is that George S. Kaufman had a major hand in the script (until it ended up in the hands of the actors of course).
Notes:  Look for the father of the Marx brothers on the pier when the ship sets sail and please remember that it Leonard's stage name is pronounced ""Chick-o"" not ""Chico.""  Put an end to this Marxist reinterpretation nonsense.",969580800,14,3234,4.459322033898305
1182561,5,B0000040EK,"To me this is the very best Marx Brother's comedy, hands down. I love their antics as usual, but what they do to the opera ""Il Trovatore"" makes me laugh just as hard now as it did the very first time I saw this film. Being an opera fan makes this movie even funnier, although you don't need to like opera to love ""A Night at the Opera"". There are so many high points of this film that space would not permit. One of my other favorite moments occurs when the Marx Brothers are hiding in a small cabin aboard an oceanliner, I won't spoil it for you- it's precious! A masterpiece of comedy from my favorite trio.  FINALLY, all the Marx Brother comedies are available on DVD!!",967593600,6,672,4.25
1182562,5,B0000040EK,"This is the best of the marx's films. It has so many laughs you can fill ten movies. There is none better than this. Everything fits perfect.

1182563,5,B0000040EK,"A Marx Brothers' movie for me is never about the plot.  The plot is just the connective tissue used to get from one outrageous comedy piece to another.  It's the pieces themselves that carry the weight of the picture.  And my-oh-my are the pieces here astounding.
Everyone points to the  stateroom scene, and justifiably so.  It's the epitome of the Marx  Brothers' style: Chico's mischief, Harpo's innocence/devilishness, and  Groucho's bemused commentary.  For me, the funniest moment of the scene  occurs even before anyone enters the room, when Groucho tries to order room  service from the steward.  His joke about tipping (""Do you have two  fives?""  ""Yes sir.""  ""Good, then you won't need the ten  cents I was going to give you.""), and Chico and Harpo's desire for  hard-boiled eggs have me on the floor laughing every time.
There are many  such masterful moments here.  Of course, the ""sanity clause""  scene, which seems to go on forever, producing laugh after laugh after  laugh (""Bartender, two beers.""  ""I'll have two beers,  too."").  The opening scene when Groucho is late for dinner.  Harpo  falling down the spiral staircase, and continuing around even after he's  hit the bottom.  And the riotous demolition of the opera at the end (when  the orchestra plays 'Take Me Out to the Ballgame', I just lose it!).  It's  all madness, and it's all hilarious.
I, like many other Marx Brothers'  fans, loathe the musical numbers that break up the comedy.  Here we get a  generous dollop of that pap when the lovers sing to each other.  But the  saving grace, and a real surprise, is the scene where Chico and Harpo take  turns at the piano.  Chico's deft and subtle clowning is brilliant, and  offers a perfect contrast to Harpo's manic performance.  It is one of my  favourite scenes in the movie.",962496000,8,1803,4.821782178217822
1182564,5,B0000040EK,"The Marx Brothers have done their absolute best in this picture. I couldn't stop laughing! A couple of scenes I like is when Groucho is ordering food from the steward and he's telling him what to order, and  Chico is inside Groucho's room which is a porthole: ""..and two  hard-boiled eggs."" Harpo sounds his bicycle horn making a deep honking  sound. ""Make that three hard-boiled eggs."" Groucho replies. A  couple of scenes were boring, especially the ones with the opera singers. I  also like it when the director of the opera company and the police go after  the Groucho, Chico, Harpo, and an opera singer. Harpo is behind the curtain  swinging around on the ropes trying to get away from the police only to  make a real mess out of it. This movie will absolutely satisfy you with  laughs from one of the greatest comedy teams ever!",961632000,2,834,4.619047619047619

1182596,2,B0000040EK,"Theres reasons why the Marx Bros. were regarded as comedy gold at one point and Marx has some brilliant zany lines. So this low rating isn't meant to throw shade at this classic film. But this 20th century man that was raised on old Three Stooges and Gilligans Island re-runs and who still likes a dose of slapstick in his comedy found the fatuous humor in A Night At The Opera starring the Marx Brothers an exercise in tediousness. I started to get antsy for a scene on a steamer boat to pull through as people kept showing up to Grouchos stolen cabin and they all entered and shuffled around making a small room that much incredibly smaller. It was stupid. Now mind you Ive really enjoyed some stupid humor (see my review of season 1 of the Angie Tribeca TV series) so I cant place just what annoyed and irritated me (and my wife for that matter) so much as we watched this in growing pain. I used to love The Three Stooges (not so much now though) and I really wanted to like A Night At The Opera (my first Marx Bros. movie with my main experience of them being old Warner Bros. cartoons that parodied famous Hollywood celebs, including the Marx Bros.) but couldn't muster up the laughs. So as Groucho has said: I find television very educating. Every time somebody turns on the set, I go into the other room and read a book.",1487635200,,1328,4.358870967741935
1182597,5,B0000040EK,This is an all time classic which will never grow old and is the best of the Marx brothers.  I can still recall saying some of the lines back and forth with my brother when I was a pre teen.,1487116800,,190,3.75
1182608,5,B0000040EK,"For me, this is the greatest comedy film ever made, hands down.  I grew up watching the Marx Brothers and I don't think I have ever found a film that has consistently managed to make me laugh this much.  Though it is very old, I truly do believe that it manages to display truly timeless humor.  From the argument over the clauses in a contract that devolves into tearing said clauses out line by line (with the occasional pause to re-knock out a felled bully, makes sense in context), to the brilliant ocean liner room service ordering scene (and two hardboiled eggs), to the absolute absurdity that is the climax during a mid-performance Opera.

I'd also like to point out that this is one of the defining examples (for me anyway) of a film that manages to be 'for all ages'.  There are slapstick and pratfall jokes, visual gags, clever wordplay, musical segments (including brilliant piano and harp solo pieces by Chico and Harpo respectively), and even a pretty sound romance story.  It'd be hard to find someone who can't enjoy some aspect if this film.",1484179200,3,1058,4.661290322580645

1182646,4,B0000040EK,"I have heard about the Marx Brothers all my life, but have never made time to watch any of their films.  I recently had a chance to catch A Night at the Opera on TV, and I'm glad I took it.  This is a funny film well deserving of its classic label.

The plot revolves around a group of people trying to make money from an opera.  There's Otis Driftwood (Groucho Marx), who is making a living trying to get Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont) into high society (while milking her for a high salary along the way).  There's Fiorello (Chico Marx) who is starting out as a manager.  Tomasso (Harpo Marx) is an assistant to a spoiled star (Walter King).  Then there's the female lead Rosa (Kitty Carlisle) and her lover Ricardo (Allan Jones), a member of the chorus who want his big break so he can marry her.

When Rosa gets a job singing in America, Fiorello, Tomasso, and Ricardo stow away on the boat to try to get him a job big enough to he can marry her.  Naturally, they stow away in Otis' trunk, making him involved as well.  With wild and crazy high jinks along the way, it's anyone's guess how things will turn out.

Okay, so maybe the ending isn't that hard to figure out after all, but the ride along the way is so much fun.  My roommate watched it with me, and he describes it as one long one line movie.  That's not quite the case, but it is down right close.  Groucho Marx is the king of the one liner, and I couldn't stop laughing at him.  Harpo's antics are also quite funny even though he never once talks.  Chico is the most of a straight man of the three, although he gets his scenes as well, especially one involving contract negotiations.

The rest of the cast has the unenviable job of keeping up with the three stars, but they manage to do a decent job.  Allan Jones really has the most screen time from the rest of the cast, and he excels at everything he has to do.  Frankly, there wasn't a bad performance in the bunch.

And the laughs!  Not only do they come from Groucho's lines but also some pretty wild situations.  There's a scene where people crowd into a room on a ship that is as funny as advertised.  And then there's the climax, with one wild situation after another that kept me laughing from start to finish.

The movie has so much wit and so many laughs that I actually found the musical interludes a bit of a let down.  Yes, there are a couple of opera songs and a few other songs on the boat.  They were okay, but really felt like they slowed the pace down to me.

That's the only flaw in the movie, however.  It is funny pretty much from start to finish.  If you've missed this film, you are really missing out.  Make tonight A Night at the Opera.",1430784000,,2681,4.230769230769231

The most hilarious scene is when they are chased across the stage during Il Trovatore; I always fall over in tears of laughter at these scenes.

It contains the famous stateroom (ocean liner cabin) scene where Groucho's stateroom is packed with people.  But the best part of the movie is a one liner from Chico, who has made himself the agent for a young opera singer.  Chico does not know how to read or write but this does not deter him from negotiating a contract with Groucho, who wants to sign up a singer with the opera company.

The two of them keep removing contract terms from a standard contract until only one is left.  Groucho explains to Chico that the remaining clause is a sanity clause (the contract is void if any party is found to be mentally unsound).

Of course, things take a turn for chaos: the real tenor is a weasel, gets knocked out by his mute dresser (played by Harpo Marx), and Groucho is tricked into signing another tenor, an unknown singer represented by an illiterate piano player (played by Chico Marx).

What a lovely operatic-quality voice this man had!

Kitty Carlisle (Hart), however is another story. She seems even in her youth to exude an unapproachable upper class snobbery that really chills a viewer.

It sounds at times as if Leonard Maltin is reading from a script he has written, but his comments are always attentive to the smallest detail. He points out character actors (Billy Gilbert, Jonathan Hale, and others) who turn up for just a few seconds. He singles out a brief shot of extras during a musical number: ""Look at the photography of that shot"" (careful high-contrast lighting throwing a man's face in shadows, an example of MGM attention to detail). The thing I like best, I guess, is that Maltin loves the film without being blind to its schmaltzy, fake moments. He points them all out--the implausibilities of the subplot, etc.--and uses them to illustrate Irving Thalberg and MGM's approach of putting the Marxes in a context of greater plotting and structure than Paramount had previously done. His comments on the big finale are also strong: he mentions the wide shots of the big opera house set adding grandeur and the accelerated editing pace of the cross-cutting toward the end. He also singles out one scene that seems to be shot in natural sunlight, which seems visually out of place in a film otherwise photographed on sound stages.",1402790400,,1195,4.862745098039215

If you've never seen any of their movies, this is the perfect one to start with. This is because of the even pace and overall structure and flow. Although the other ones have the best of the comedy, this one had the director and producers to make this a comparatively more organized feel to it, as the others feel like a live Vaudeville show.

My top 5 rank of their movies:

Animal Crackers
Duck Soup
A Night at the Opera
At the Races
Horse Feathers

I rate even the sub-par ""The Big Store"" or ""A Night in Casablanca"" well above any Charlie Chaplin or Three Stooges in the stage of comedy, as the slapstick is not as fundamental as the witty humor and ridiculous circumstances are. I find the movies to even be congruent with the current insult-based trend of comedians such as Daniel Tosh, Anthony Jeselnik, or Jeff Ross - with the late 1920's cleanliness.

This movie is a classic for a reason, it is brilliantly hilarious and delightful. And it was nice to be able to see it in HD- though kind of disappointing that it exists in HD, yet they won't release it or any of the other Marx Brothers films on blu-ray. Maybe this is because it's just a very basic HD transfer, and no work has been done to actually restore or make them look better, or what have you- but even so, the ones that are available in HD nevertheless, look a little better, and if the world isn't going to bothers (which is a terrible shame) to restore the Marx Brothers films, they should at least put these ones on blu-ray as they are here.

That being said, A Night at the Opera is a hilarious and wonderful film, and was the first of theirs to have a more solid plot-line as well as grander production behind it. I personally think it far better than A Day at the Races, the other that received that same treatment.

The silly, romantic sob-plot between straights Alun Jones and Kitty Carlisle simply serves to string hilarious scenes of laugh-out-loud zaniness.  Groucho makes the most of his notorious talent for insult comedy, often self-deprecating, with lines like ""When I ask a woman to dine with me, I expect her to look me in the face -- that's the price she has to pay.""  Chico's goofiness shines in the contract routine and his bizarre piano antics, and Harpo wows with his insanely chaotic breakfast business and his stunningly funny schtick during the opera and its overture.  The tiny, over-stuffed stateroom on the ocean liner has to be the single most famous and hilarious comedy routine in cinematic history.  The hotel scene, in which the Boys play a nosy cop for a fool, provides continuous laughs between Groucho's wise-guy insults full of naughty double-entendres and his brothers' quick yet silent deceptions.

Groucho, Chico, and Harpo are at their humorous best as they deal with tiny staterooms on a cruise, poke fun at everyone around them, and make beautiful music. As much as many people think of them as ""only"" comedians, A Night at the Opera showcases their musical talents. Harpo is a wonderful harpist (and that's where his name comes from). He's also talented at the piano. Chico has good fingers on the piano as well.

Long before Titanic, the Marx brothers were playing up the differences between upper class and lower class on a cruise ship. Where the upper class is sitting quietly and elegant tables, the lower class is singing, dancing, and having a delightful time. They've got their Chianti-in-a-basket and mounds of spaghetti. Grocho and his crew clearly adore the down-to-earth Italians and poke fun at the black-suited opera goers in later scenes.

While there are two main female characters in the movie, they're really there to be either the ""silly rich woman"" or the ""innocent heroine"". They barely get to talk. But that's fairly typical for most movies of this age.

Many movies age and fade over time. The Marx Brothers show that good comedy can remain entertaining for decades. And it's a shame that legal contracts are, if anything, even far worse than they were in the times of the Marx Brothers! To think the jokes they would make about our MODERN contracts :).

In fact, to think that that state room scene is still a hoot almost 80 years later! Amazing!

It was the very first movie the brothers did after Zeppo has left the group. It was the first movie the brothers did for Warner Brothers after they were let go by Paramount Pictures and finally this movie would be the first of a long line story plots. In their first five pictures the Marx Brothers were just zany and would insult the good and the bad. Starting with A Night at the Opera till their final movie Love Happy the Marx Brothers would only insult the bad people and come to the rescue of the innocent. Lastly this is the first movie to feature the first of many fake Zeppos; at least that what film historians call them.

I am not got into the plot of the movie because I am sure that a few other reviewers gave away the whole story. The as a trio this would be the Marx Brothers finest and the only to come close to (performing as a trio) is A Day at the Races. After A Day at the Races the quality of the Marx Brothers goes down hill big time. A Night at the Opera is know for two main scenes; the stateroom and contract scenes.

1182789,5,B0000040EK,"This is a review for the VHS tape of the MGM film of A NIGHT AT THE OPERA (1935) dby Sam Wood starring the Three Marx Brothers, Kitty Carlysle, Allen Jones, Walter Woolf King, Sig Ruman, Margaret Dumont.

The Marx Brothers --Groucho, Chico, and Harpo star in their most successful and in some minds, their best film. Produced by the legendary Irving Thalberg whose touch of genius was to lay on the schmaltz as thickly as possible and keep the brothers three  under control as much  possible, except for the comedy.

And the comedy is the main reason most anyone would want to watch A NIGHT AT THE OPERA today. All three Marxes are at the top of their form with one famous scene after another, more than enough material to fill two movies for ""normal"" performers.
Each time one of the brothers takes center stage I decide that he is really the best.
The truth is all three were tops at what they did and in this film they had the likes of George S. Kaufman, Morrie Ryskin, Al Boasberg and even uncredited Buster Keaton, among others, building gags alongside the story for them.

In A NIGHT AT THE OPERA the brothers become secondary characters when romance rears its romantic head and that, more than anything, kind of bothers me.
Here's where we need Zeppo, to carry the torch of Marxian romance and desire, just for the neatness of keeping it all in the family and to avoid having the brothers slip into becoming even for a few minutes, just an element of an ensemble cast.

Another problem with A NIGHT AT THE OPERA is some of the scene transitions are kind of jerky if not downright abrupt, not what you'd expect from MGM. Maybe the powers that be made some last minute cuts in the film and did not have the time to do a smooth editing job. If that's true wouldn't be something to see those out takes?

And finally, for years I have actively disliked the music in A NIGHT AT THE OPERA. But now that I have aged just a slight bit, I find it kind of pleasant and portions of it somewhat interesting. Also, as the years have passed, I have been able to forget TV's ""To Tell The Truth"" or whatever quiz show Kitty Carlysle appeared on and now can appreciate her for the remarkable beauty and fine singer she really was. I wonder if Chico noticed.

So, in my opinion, A NIGHT AT THE OPERA, a five star film,  stands only slightly  behind DUCK SOUP in the chorus line of high stepping Marx Brothers classics, which ain't bad by anyone's standards."" With a Hey Non Nonny And a Hot Cha Cha.""",1266192000,,2487,4.398692810457517
1182790,5,B0000040EK,"""A Night at the Opera""(1935) is the first MGM film made by the Marx brothers after leaving Paramount, and it is the first Marx Brother's film without Zeppo. This was also a sort of comeback film for the Marx brothers after a poor response from their previous movie ""Duck Soup"". Interestingly enough this film later had about three minutes clipped from the beginning by the censors when it was shown for the soldiers during WWII because the intro mentioned that the setting was in Milan, Italy, which the U.S. was at war with. Evidently these three minutes have been lost forever.
This film featured some classic moments in comedy, like the Sanity Clause repartee between Groucho and Chico, where they rip a contract down to nothing except for a Sanity Clause. There is also the classic stateroom scene in Groucho's tiny ship quarters and the ensuing mayhem, as everybody from plummers, to waiters, to chamber maids, to the manicurist, to the other two Marx brothers, go about their business in the very tight confines of Groucho's room.
This is the Marx brothers at their best.",1258934400,,1077,4.827027027027027

The gags fly as well as the Marx Brothers!  Margaret Dumont uses Groucho to make her place in society when it is apparent to everyone that he is just using her money, he even states it.  What makes the movie so special isn't the two lovebirds or the story, but how the Marx Brothers work together and create gags.  It is very special.  Apparently Irving Thalberg was an MGM executive who understood them and allowed them to work.",1251763200,,599,4.3125

1182793,5,B0000040EK,"Watch the opening sequence of A Night at the Opera and you will see Groucho Marx at the height of his powers. A series of brilliant one-liners, all delivered with impeccable timing. Effortless comedy that was an influence on generations of comedians to come. Remember this was made in 1935!

This is certainly in the same league as Duck Soup and probably better than A Day at the Races. The elongated 'sanity clause' joke, the state room scene on the boat, the detective in the hotel and the set piece at the opera near the end are amongst the best things the Marx Brothers ever did.

Some of the musical numbers appear a little dated, but this was the era of Busby Berkley and so these were expected. It also gave the other to brothers a chance to show off their musical skills as well. But most of all it is Groucho who steals the show, and he is the main reason to watch the film, good as some of the supporting actors are.

This is now part of a great boxed set which is better value for money.",1233619200,,998,4.26984126984127

Zeppo, their surreal straight-man (who in my opinion was the hyper-real icing on the abstract cake) is gone. There is more of a linear plot and not just a gag-driven story. And the boys are more focused making their characters believable and less amoral in this outing. The brothers used to insult anyone and just turn any setting they were in into pure chaos. Here, they are helping out a deserving couple and abusing only the antagonists who deserve it. Harpo doesn't harass girls. Groucho isn't full of bitter one-liners. The group actually seem like friends in this one! The moments of non-comedy are great, in contrast to their previous films. The comedy isn't as fast-paced and inventive, but the structure of the film is WAY more satisfying. ""A Night at the Opera"" and ""Duck Soup"" are the boys at their best.

The film - filled with funny lines - has all the familiar MB trappings: good slapstick, good and bad jokes and routines, wild scenes, several musical numbers and general overall chaos.

The only thing not appealing to me in the film were some of the songs - not all, just some. Otherwise, it was all fun as Groucho, Chico and Harpo all share humorous lines and/or sight gags. This is the film with the famous scene involving a ton of people being stuffed into Groucho's small cabin room. It's more amazing than funny. My favorite scenes were when Groucho and Chico got into discussions and trade lines back-and-forth. I also laughed heartily at the finale with Harpo swinging like Tarzan at the opera house.

In all, a funny MB film, one of the boys' better efforts. I play it with the English subtitles so as not to miss any of the great lines of dialog in here. In fact, that's not a bad idea for any of the Marx Brothers films, because the jokes are delivered so fast, you might miss some of the hilarious comments.",1227398400,,1134,4.473429951690822
1182797,4,B0000040EK,"When the Marx Brothers came to MGM in 1935, boy wonder producer Irving Thalberg had the good commercial sense to package them in a genuine musical comedy. Their anarchic comedy may have been slightly better served in some earlier Paramount comedies but never were they better showcased than here, their most popular film because of the balance of entertainment on offer and the quality of the production values provided by MGM, the Rolls Royce of film studios at the time.

For those who know the Marx Brothers, there is little to say.  Furthermore, there are lots of excellent Amazon reviews which can fill you in. For young people who may not know the team, do yourself a favour and have a look. You may baulk at the love interest sub plot and the music but don't miss some of the very best comedy ever - the stateroom sequence is as hilarious today as it was when it first appeared. The Brothers were specialists at sending up pomposity and convention and setting them among the New York Opera set was a great idea.

This DVD is a comprehensive package. The weakest aspect is that typical of the MGM films which appear on DVD, it has not been restored and is grainy and dirty in parts. Also, there are clearly a few places where the film splicing is less than perfect with jumps in the continuity.

The extras, however, are excellent. Leonard Maltin provides a beautifully paced commentary, confining his comments to suitable background information and the sheer pleasure at the delights on view. It was particularly interesting to learn that the film was cut when it was reissued during World War 2 when every reference to Italy was removed. I have never understood why the film starts so abruptly and now I do. I can't help but hope that the cut footage may one day re-appear. An adequate documentary is included, the best of which has clips of Kitty Carlisle Hart who played the romantic lead. Ms Hart was a very elegant elderly woman with excellent memories of the film and its subsequent elevation to genuine classic - delightful. Dom Deluise appears too and he is embarassing. The DVD also includes a Robert Benchley short which is droll and amusing and an Oscar winner. The other short is a promotion for the Trocadero restaurant and it is worth seeing singer Connie Boswell but the rest is awful. Last of all, there is a portion of a TV interview with Groucho in which he tells my favourite Marx Brothers story. Don't miss it.

1182811,5,B0000040EK,"For those of you looking for a great introduction to the brilliant physical comedy (as well as one liners) from the late, great, and legendary Marx Brothers, this film is for you!  A NIGHT AT THE OPERA is nothing short of hilarious, as well as beautiful to listen to!  This features soprano Kitty Carlisle, as a young opera star, who runs into the Marx Brothers along the way--or, specifically Otis B. Driftwood (Groucho Marx), a ""hanger on"" who continues to pursue an elderly socialite, Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont).  He and his rowdy crew of accomplices--er, assistants--help to bring the beautiful opera singer together with her lover, as well as with critical acclaim.  What's more, some of the most beautiful and well-known opera arias are interspersed between the zany shenanigans (this includes ""The Anvil Chorus"" and ""Miserere"" from IL TROVATORE).

Some of the scenes from this film have often been replicated in films, as well as television, but no one does it quite as well as the Marx Brothers.  They truly put the physical comedians of today to shame.  There is a reason that A NIGHT AT THE OPERA has been the recipient of numerous honors on top film lists.  Be sure to see it.  I have no doubt that you will enjoy it!",1189468800,,1233,4.751173708920188
1182812,5,B0000040EK,"A Night At The Opera is indeed one of the greatest films starring The Marx Brothers. The plot moves along at a good pace; the acting is convincing and the gags are timed to perfection. The actors are well cast and the script shines. Harpo Marx even does his own stunts! Who could ask for anything more?

The action begins presumably in Italy or somewhere in Europe when Otis B. Driftwood (Groucho Marx) has increasing difficulty mooching off a wealthy older woman named Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont). Driftwood is supposed to introduce Mrs. Claypool to high society; but all he ever actually does is take his paycheck and stall Mrs. Claypool. Mrs. Claypool is running out of patience; she wants Driftwood to introduce her to high society now that her wealthy husband died and left her eight million dollars. (Why she does this four years after he died and not sooner is left unexplained.) Unfortunately, Otis Driftwood is great at cracking one liners at the expense of Mrs. Claypool--that is, until Mrs. Claypool meets Herbert Gottlieb (Sig Ruman). Eventually Mrs. Claypool is convinced to make a generous donation to an opera company also under the control of Herbert Gottlieb. They sail to New York with Gottlieb's promise to Mrs. Claypool that his star tenor Rodolfo Lassparri (Walter Woolf King) will be a huge financial success. Then Mrs. Claypool will finally look wonderful in the eyes of high society--and Gottlieb just might get his hands on Mrs. Claypool for her money.

But complications arise: Otis Driftwood and two of his peers (Harpo Marx and Chico Marx) tag along on the ocean voyage to America; ever hopeful to win Mrs. Claypool back from the snobby Herbert Gottlieb. Yet another stowaway comes along--Ricardo Baroni (Allan Jones) because he loves opera singer Rosa Castaldi (Kitty Carlisle) even though Rosa is loved and pursued by star tenor Rodolfo Lassparri himself.

What will happen next? Will they all get to America safely? Will the police have to be brought in? How will The Marx Brothers' characters and Ricardo try to convince or manipulate Gottlieb so that Ricardo can be in the opera starring alongside his sweetheart Rosa Castaldi? Will they succeed? No spoilers here, folks--you'll just have to watch the movie to find out!

Many reviewers have correctly pointed out the funniest scenes in this movie already; so I won't risk boring you with too many details of them. The choreography shines in the classic stateroom scene in which everyone crowds into Otis B. Driftwood's cabin onboard ship; and the cinematography exceeds my expectations with song and dance numbers including Cosi Cosa on the steamship to America.

The DVD comes with a commentary by Leonard Maltin; and Kitty Carlisle is one of several interesting people who add their own commentary in extra features. You also get Robert Benchley's comedy short entitled How To Sleep and there is another extra short called Sunday Night At The Trocadero with Connie Boswell and a brief cameo by Groucho.

If anybody tells you to skip this film, ignore their advice. A Night At The Opera shines as the very best example of The Marx Brothers doing comedy on film; and the performances by Kitty Carlisle, Sig Ruman and Walter Woolf King enhance the quality of the movie.

1182816,5,B0000040EK,"The first two Marx Brothers films, THE COCOANUTS and ANIMAL CRACKERS, were essentially filmed versions of their great successes on the New York stage.  MONKEY BUSINESS, HORSE FEATHERS and DUCK SOUP were specifically created for the screen on the soundstages of Paramount Studios--but when the latter proved a critical and box office fiasco the comedy team found their careers on very uneven ground.

Enter Irving Thalberg of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.  Thalberg was not known for his comedies and MGM, with its emphasis on prestige pictures and family fare, was an extremely unlikely venue for the brothers, but Thalberg was certain he could pinpoint the reason for their sudden and unexpected failure: DUCK SOUP, and to a certain extent all their previous films, lacked appeal for middle American audiences.  The Marx Brothers (without Zeppo, who retired from the act when they left Paramount) signed on the dotted line, Thalberg put the machinery of MGM behind them, and the result was A NIGHT AT THE OPERA.

What Thalberg did, essentially, was to place the anarchy of the Marx Brothers at the disposal of romantic subplot.  Otis B. Driftwood (Groucho) has promised to get Mrs. Claypool ""into society""--for a fee, of course--and has arranged for her finance a season at The New York Opera.  What Mrs. Claypool gets for her money is tenor Rodolfo Lassparri (Walter King), an unsavory man who is sweet on soprano Rosa Castaldi (Kitty Carlisle), who is in turn in love with tenor Ricardo Baroni (Allan Jones.) When Lassparri attempts to trump Baroni both on stage and in Rosa's affections, Baroni's friends Fiorella (Chico) and Tomasso (Harpo) enter the fray. Throw in an impressario (Sig Ruman), three famous aviators, a herd of New York police officers, and an opening night, and before you can sing a chorus of Figaro that special brand of Marx Brothers mania holds full sway.

Marx Brothers fans argue a great deal about which was better: the Paramount films or the MGM films?  I tend to come down on the side of the Paramount films, in which the humor tends to have a sharper edge, but there's no denying the charm of A NIGHT AT THE OPERA.  A list of the film's famous moments would require a catalogue, with the legendary ""stateroom scene"" merely one in a hilarious sequence.  The supporting cast is also quite fine; Margaret Dumont is, as always, excellent; Kitty Carlisle and Allan Jones are charming indeed.  It's all tremendous fun.

The DVD release, which is available on its own or in a package of the Marx Brother's MGM films, is more than respectable.  The film was cut during World War II and the edited scenes seem lost forever; it is therefore occasionally abrupt, but even so it all hangs together extremely well, and while the print has not been restored per se it is quite good.  The DVD bonus package includes a brief documentary and several vintage shorts, but the real prize is the audio commentary by Leonard Maltin, who is both amusing and informative in the way I wish all commentators would be.  If you are in the mood for outrageous farce, you couldn't make a better choice.

1182818,4,B0000040EK,"I personally feel this movie is a little overrated, but overrated in that while I don't think it's their greatest or funniest movie, I don't think it's their worst or unfunniest either (far from it, in fact).  This was their penultimate truly great film, though with their move to MGM and away from Paramount, you can see a plot is starting to take more precedence over crazy anarchic antics, along with supporting players starting to assume more of a role in the story, along with the dreaded romantic/musical subplot.  The brothers were slowly starting to lose their edge with this move to making movies that may have had more of a plot but half the laughs, as Irving Thalberg told them he wanted to do.  Although I know they regarded the first two they made at MGM, before he died, as the best they ever made, so it's not like they lost their edge or began their decline and loss of creative control overnight.  Although at least here the lovers involved in the subplot really belong there and are a full part of the plot, instead of feeling like boring pointless appendages slowing down an otherwise good movie.  And since they're both singers, the musical numbers don't seem superfluous like they do in too many of their other MGM films (although ""Cosi-Cosa"" is one I could easily skip ever hearing again).  Our sympathy with Rosa and Riccardo is established right away, so the viewer really cares for them instead of feeling annoyed whenever they're onscreen taking time away from the comedy.  Allan Jones was also the best pseudo-Zeppo they ever worked with by far, although I've read that the three of them really missed their baby brother while they were making this film and wished he'd stayed in the act and been able to make that film with them.  Unlike most of their later MGM films, too, here we really have a feeling that the bad guys are really bad and need to be defeated, not just boring generic villains you don't really get a feel for the true meanness of, of their need to be defeated and humiliated, wishing they'd never been born.  We know right from the first time we encounter him in the second scene that Rodolfo is cruel, mean, and evil (I can barely watch the scene where he's beating Harpo, first hitting him with a stick and then whipping him, and then a few scenes later roughs him up again), and deserves exactly what he gets at the end.

The extras are hit and miss; the mini-documentary is quite good, but could have been better-served being a bit longer and more in-depth.  The audio commentary is also nice; I'm not a big fan of audio commentaries, but they're interesting to listen to at least once, and can clear up confusion about a certain dated reference, shed some light on an in-joke, or just provide interesting tidbits about the movie you might not have found out anywhere else.  The mood of the commentary is very informal and friendly instead of overly serious and scholarly.  The rest of the extras are alright, but the shorts aren't really related to the movie apart from showing the kind of thing that might have been shown back in 1935 before the main feature began.",1122940800,4,3117,4.6046931407942235
1182819,5,B0000040EK,"This movie really amazed me.  It showed me how funny movies could be, even 70 years ago.  In fact, I can't remember a movie this funny being shown in any theater in recent times.  There probably hasn't been something this funny in theaters for at least six years.

Groucho is top notch in this one.  Although he's known for making joke after joke after joke in a very short amount of time, he puts tons of top quality jokes into his performance here.  After publicly thanking Mrs. Claypool for financing the opera, he tells the audience that he's sure the memories of a great performer will come back to them, just as sure as Mrs. Claypool's checks will come back in the morning.

Chico has a great scene in this film too.  He tells a phoney story about flying across the Atlantic.  He says that after two attempts, the plane ran out of gas, and on the third attempt, his crew got about halfway across the ocean and then realized they forgot the airplane.

The Marx Brothers somehow manage to get the opera's orchestra to play ""Take Me Out To The Ball Game"" which forces them to succumb to the irresistable temptation of yelling out ""Peanuts, Popcorn.""  They ruin the opera in several other ways as well, like dropping random backgrounds behind the actors while they are singing, with Harpo tearing up one of backgrounds too.

One of the best scenes is when they stow away in a boat, and end up in a very small room.  As if it weren't cramped enough, visitor after visitor arrives, and soon 20 more people shove their way in there.  It gets so crowded a sleeping Harpo is pushed onto a woman, and while he's lying on her, Groucho says to Chico something along the lines of, ""Hey, when I said work fast, I didn't mean your friend, I meant the maid.""

Groucho's deadbeat-type character never gets old.  He tries to give his hotel bill away, and he withdraws a healthy salary without doing anything.  When he's fired, he demands he gets his two-weeks salary pay.  When informed that he's overdrawn his salary for the next six months, he says he'll take one week's salary instead.

Highly recommended.  This movie will get you to really appreciate the genious of the Marx Brothers.",1120867200,2,2177,4.5475578406169666
1182820,4,B0000040EK,"After 70 years, ""A Night At The Opera"" is still considered one of the finest comedy films ever made, and is often called the funniest film the Marx Brothers ever made; there's also a handful of fans who consider ""A Day At The Races"" to be the funnier of the two. Die-hard fans already have them both in the five-disc box set; if you've only got room on your shelf for one Marx Brothers film, this review should help you decide between the two.

Both films were supervised by Hollywood genius Irving Thalberg, who realized that the Marx Brothers' raucous style of humor was not enough to sell tickets; it was his insistence on adding glamour and romance that made the films successful. Both films feature Allan Jones as the handsome singer who needs a break so he can marry his sweetheart. Both films feature Groucho and Chico as fast-talking con artists; Groucho swindles Margaret Dumont while Chico swindles Groucho. Both films feature Harpo as a mischevious mute who is sadistically whipped by the villain. Both films end in surrealist chaos, devilishly orchestrated by the brothers Marx. Of course, all is forgiven before the closing credits roll.

In ""Night"", Margaret Dumont can barely tolerate Groucho's incompetence; in ""Day"", she blindly ignores it because she's in love with him, allowing him to get away with a lot more comic mischief. In ""Night"", Allan Jones and Kitty Carlisle are both given ample time to sing, bringing the action to a halt; in ""Day"", Kitty is replaced by the non-singing Maureen O'Sullivan, a better actress who never wastes screen time with a sappy duet. In ""Day"", the Marxes get revenge on crooks who want to fix a horserace and build a casino, in ""Night"", they get revenge on a mean opera singer who wants to steal Allan's girl, making him less of a villain and more of a pest. The songs in ""Night"" are far more tolerable than the music in ""Day"", but let's face it - the only songs you need in a Marx Brothers movie are the ones played on piano and harp.

Extras on the ""Night"" disc include a witty essay on curing insomnia by humorist Robert Benchley, along with a Leonard Maltin commentary track. His remarks lack the spontaneity and informality of the commentary track for ""Day"", suggesting that it was scripted by Maltin or his research staff. At one point, he suggests that sharp-eyed viewers may be able to spot the father of the Marx Brothers twice in one scene: first on a pier and again on a ship. My research indicates that he could not have appeared in this 1935 film, as he had passed away two years earlier. Maltin may have confused this scene with a similiar one in ""Monkey Business"". There's also a rare talkie for star-gazers featuring cameos by dozens of MGM contract players, including one Julius Marx (aka Groucho sans moustache) but most of the dialogue is muffled or inaudible.

Although both films are highly enjoyable with a higher-than-average amount of laugh-out-loud moments, I'm giving ""Day"" a slight edge over ""Night"" on the basis of its comedy-to-music ratio. In addition, the dramatic final horserace in ""Day"" makes for a much more satisfying conclusion than the lovers' duet in ""Night"". Head for the races before you see the opera.",1114905600,,3196,4.7531531531531535
1182821,5,B0000040EK,"One of the greatest comedies of all time, A Night at the Opera is one of those films that just doesn't get stale. It's a movie that perfectly follows the Marx Brothers' recipe for their trademark mayhem: take a pompus, uptight institution--such as academia, medicine or politics--and trash it. In this case, it's the wild and wacky world of opera.

When opera singers Riccardo and Rosa are separated by the wicked Lassparri, it's up to Otis B. Driftwood, Fiorello and Tomasso to get them back together again, and help them become stars of the New York Opera Company. They do this by shredding a contract, stuffing fifteen people into a stateroom, shuffling beds around a hotel room, stealing the beards of three aviators, and turning an orchestra pit into a baseball diamond--among other inspired acts of lunacy. Does any of that really help? Maybe a little bit. But all you'll care about is that it's fun to watch!

There's a reason that, after seventy years, this film is still as popular as it is. All it takes is one screening to figure out what it is. Grab yourself some hard-boiled eggs and enjoy.

Groucho Marx (Otis Driftwood)tries to make a quick buck when he hears that a young tenor can be brought up for a extraordinary price. So him and his crazy friends Chico and Harpo tries to persuade the manager of the opera company to sign up a young talent. However this young talent is also so deeply in love with one of the operatic shows.

The film features two of their best bits:  The overcrowded stateroom, and Groucho explaining the Opera Contract to Chico and talking about the ""Sanity Clause"" prompting Chico to respond, ""Aww go on there ain't no Sanity Claus!""  Classic.

Groucho's one liners are probably the best comic lines on film, and Harpo's silent antics are a delight, while Chico is up to his same old tricks. The three work brilliantly while director Sam Wood and the writers work in some good musical acts and classic comedy bits.

However, the seeds of the Marxes' creative demise were planted in this particular film: the strong focus on music and romance; the gradual softening of the brothers' comedic personas; and the MGM studio gloss at odds with Marxian anarchy. Thanks to the guiding hand of producer Irving Thalberg, everything clicks in ""A Night at the Opera."" Groucho, in particular, is brilliant and razor-sharp. Harpo's freewheeling spirit has been toned down, yet he has some truly inspired moments.

1182837,5,B0000040EK,"""A Night at the Opera,"" the first movie the Marx Brothers made for MGM, is one of their best. Yes, it is more conventional that their earlier films, and the love story (while not as offensively bad as some make it out to be) is forgettable. Still, the comic moments (including the famous stateroom scene) remain very funny, and there are numerous one-liners (especially from Groucho).
The DVD, part of Warner Brothers' ""Marx Brothers Collection,"" is pretty good. The image is in its original 1.33:1 full-frame aspect ratio, and is relatively clear. The commentary by Leonard Maltin, while having a few gaps and providing little information on the Marx Brothers' earlier years, is fine. There is an entertaining (although somewhat unbeiievable) story from Groucho on a mid-sixites talk show. Also included are a trailer and (in an interesting move) some old shorts and cartoons from around the time this film was made.
The only real fault of the disc is in its thirty minute documentary, ""Remarks on Marx."" Most of the interviewees have little of interest to say (especially the always affordable Dom DeLuise, who actually tries to be funny), and the analysis of several classic scenes (especially the stateroom) is obvious at best and boring at worst. An interesting interview with romantic lead Kitty Carlisle is the saving grace.",1089158400,,1331,5.054545454545455
1182838,3,B0000040EK,"Many think this film the best or one of the best the Brothers Marx ever did.  It's probably a matter of taste (well, it's certainly a matter of taste), but I think the first MGM comedy by the Marx Brothers is scattershot.  Groucho, Chico and Harpo are in top form, and when they're on -- and allowed to dominate a scene -- the film is terrific.  The stateroom scene is still funny after 70 years, and the finale at the opera is Marxist anarchy at its finest.
But when they're off screen (at least a third of the movie), you're left with an embarrassing melodrama I'm sure the movegoing audiences of 1935 found as sappy as I did.  Bad enough the young Italian lovers sound like they're from New England section of Italy; worse are the musical interludes, which bring the film to a halt and destroy any comedic momentum the Marxes have created.  A scene where Chico, Harpo and Jones show off their musical prowess goes on far too long and completely stops the film.  Their earlier comedies had musical interludes, but they were woven into the films better.  The opening number in Duck Soup, for example, is a lengthy set-up to the first joke; ditto the ""We're Going to War"" number.  When the young lovers in A Night at the Opera sing ""Alone,"" there's nothing but the youngsters staring moonily at each other.  Their voices are fine, but the studios of the time were never short of movies with beautiful youngsters singing to each other.  It's unnecessary here, and it reminds you the Marx Brothers aren't on screen.
""A Night at the Opera"" was the Marxes' most successful comedy at the box office, and probably the most popular film they ever did.  But time has been kinder to their earlier Paramount productions.  Those films are stagebound, but they have a madcap energy the MGM films never recovered.
If you're a real fan of the Marx Brothers, you've probably already seen this; the rest of you should start with Duck Soup or Horse Feathers.  A Night at the Opera was, unfortunately, the beginning of the end for this legendary team.",1085961600,16,2033,4.598337950138504
1182839,4,B0000040EK,"Many have argued that A NIGHT AT THE OPERA is the Marx Brother's finest film, pointing out that it combined the best of the Brother's comedy with the biggest and boldest in MGM production values.  Personally, while I really like the film, I wouldn't quite put it in the top slot.  Any of the sequences containing the Marx Brothers themselves are gold, but I find that I'm not as enamored with the romantic subplot and singing as other reviewers have been (notably Leonard Maltin in this DVD's commentary).  Still, arguing about which one of the fine films is actually the best is a little pointless.  This is a great movie, regardless with how it compares to the others.
The biggest thing this film has going for it (outside of the wonderful Marx Brothers themselves, of course) is the big production values that MGM splashed out on.  I have mixed feelings about this.  On the one hand, it's nice to have some great big sets for the Brothers to clown around in (Harpo's stunt double swinging through the rafters is great), but all things considered, I think I prefer the tongue-in-cheek send-up of the big dance numbers (as done in DUCK SOUP) to the production dances which are played straight here.
Margaret Dumont is underused, which is a shame since her dignified outrage usually accounted for big laughs.  She gets a good scene at the beginning, and a handful of opportunities to look indignant later in the film, but she isn't the constant presence that she had been in other films.
Still, while I can pick out a few flaws here and there, this is overall a hilarious and fun movie.  Much of what is considered classic Marx Brothers material is from this film: the too-many-people-in-the-stateroom scene, the Marxian deconstruction of a legal contract (if anyone thinks that ""'The party of the first part' shall be known in this contract as 'the party of the first part'"" isn't realistic, then I can show you fine print I've received from credit card companies that are even more tautological than that), and, of course, the grand finale wherein the three brothers completely destroy an opera-in-progress.
The DVD also contains an all-new documentary, which features (among other people) co-star Kitty Carlisle, who is amazingly sharp for being in her 90s, and Dom DeLuise, who talks a lot about food and appears to have been interviewed in the middle of making breakfast (no, I'm not sure why he's here).  This is mostly a talking heads interview documentary and there's not a whole lot of brand new material or trivia, but it is nice to see some differing perspectives on things.  The story of how Groucho got his name contradicts the anecdote given on the commentary track, and Carlisle refutes the conventional wisdom that states that Margaret Dumont didn't get any of the jokes Groucho was bouncing off her.
A short except from a 1961 broadcast of ""The Hy Gardner Show"" (who?) reveals Groucho recounting the story of he and his brothers stripping naked and roasting potatoes in the office of Irving Thalberg after the famed producer kept them waiting once too long.  I trust you will enjoy the anecdote, because it's told a whopping three times during the course of these DVD extras.  Shockingly, none of the tellings blatantly contradict each other.
Two shorts have been included as extras, though I'm not sure I understand their relevance.  Robert Benchley's HOW TO SLEEP won the Academy Award in 1935 for Best Short Subject/Comedy, and it's certainly entertaining enough.  As for the other short, SUNDAY NIGHT AT THE TROCADERO, well, I'm baffled.  I can't make heads or tails of it.  Set in a nightclub, a Hollywood talent scout is visiting this ritzy affair.  Numerous song and dance people are attempting auditions, while the club's doorman is trying to impress by doing very bad celebrity impersonations (it didn't help that half the time I didn't recognize the name of the person he was impersonating or the name of the person people actually thought he was doing).  Cameos by stars of the day abound by having the camera cut to different tables and a voice over shouting, ""Hey, look!  It's Bob Has-been!"" (or whoever).  It isn't helped by the fact that most of the careers of these minor celebrities ended soon after the shoot, so for me I was watching cattle call of anonymous hotshots.  I couldn't figure out why these people were appearing as themselves.  Was the audience supposed to believe that these people really hang out at this fictional locale?  Groucho Marx (out of character and costume) has a three-second cameo where he looks as confused as I felt.
I'm wary of commentaries performed by people who weren't actually born when the film they're talking about was made, but Leonard Maltin does a fine job here.  He relates a lot of anecdotes about the Marx Brothers, points out how the script is layering the subplots, and relates a lot of trivia that I had never heard before (for example, the only surviving print is actually an edited version made during WWII when all references to Italy have been removed, which explains why the film bizarrely never tells you were the first scenes are set).  He even gets into the fun, shouting ""What a twit!"" when the evil opera singer refuses to sing on the cruise-liner for free.
Although the DVD of A NIGHT AT THE OPERA is included in ""The Marx Brothers Collection"" box set, it is also available for individual sale.  Although I slightly prefer A DAY AT THE RACES (also out on DVD now), I couldn't recommend anyone not pick up this film.  For Marx novices, there's a great movie.  For Marx aficionados, there's informational material that may be enjoyed.

I think the first 5 ""lost"" Marx Bros movies (I have them on DVD and treasure them, all but Duck Soup, with a screenplay by one of their song-writing teams) are (so far) their funniest.  Chaos, pandemonium, idiosyncrasies, personality.  Either I was despondent when I watched this flick or else the Marx Bros' antics had worn thin for me.

There were a few witty remarks, but those came from either Kaufman or Ryskind, not the Marx Bros.  And on that subject, I never (at least not before The Solid Gold Cadillac) thought I'd ever watch or read a Kaufman play and not think it was hilarious.  I did not think this was hilarious.  The opera they featured at the end was Verdi's Il Trovatore, I don't like that opera anyway, particularly the mezzo gypsy song, particularly all of it.  I thought the whole movie was watery, thin, dull and not the best of the Marxes, and not particularly funny.  I just opened Casablanca.  Tomorrow morning I'll take a crack at it, though I remember much of it now.

The main attraction is, of course, the patented zaniness of The Marx Brothers -- the acerbic Groucho, the mute Harpo, and the dim-witted Chico -- whose unique brand of comedy is often edgy, subversive, and even surreal and other-worldly.  Count me as one of those who thinks that such style of comedy loses some edge in A NIGHT AT THE OPERA, where the comic trio seem out of place in a methodical plot, realistic settings, and among ordinary people.  These mundane elements are also, surprisingly, engrossing enough to often upstage the comedians.  Groucho's usual anti-establishment stance also seems softened in order to give way to crowd-pleasing sentimentality.  The Marx Brothers, like Jacques Tati, are creators of their own comic universes, and that's where they need to inhabit, such as in the whimsical delight DUCK SOUP, the Brothers' previous film, where their presence is more dominant.  With that said, A NIGHT AT THE OPERA does have some of most memorable gags in the Brothers' history.  A verbal confusion with Santa Claus, a tiny room cramped with 15 people, mixing opera with baseball, and Harpo's stunts with the ropes are some of the highlights.

The new Warner DVD of A NIGHT AT THE OPERA is encoded for Region 1 and 4, and has a cleaner video transfer than I expected considering the age of the film.  Obviously, a video restoration has been done, as were the cases for many of recent Warner DVDs of old movies.  The original mono audio is fine, save for some age-related hisses in the background.  There are some jarring momentary losses of frames in a few places, such as in the scene of Groucho riding a carriage early in the movie.  However, I noticed these ""jumps"" in older video versions as well.  Both English subtitles and closed captioning are present for the film's dialogs.  The lyrics to the songs ""Alone"" and Cosi-Cosa"" are also captioned, but not subtitled.  During the Verdi opera sequence, the caption simply says ""[Singing in Italian].""  French and Spanish subtitles are also provided, but, of course, many of the wordplays are simply lost in translation (""C'est ce qu'on appelle une clause 'sanitaire'."") None of the supplements on the disc are subtitled or captioned, however.

Leonard Maltin provides an engaging and informative audio commentary for the film.  He points out that the film was cut for its 1948 re-release (the version used for this DVD) in order to remove all references to Italy, which fought against America in WWII.  The original opening was supposed to be a musical number showing people in Milan singing, thereby establishing the setting of the film.  Although wishing to avoid analyzing the film, Maltin does try to elucidate some of the ingenious touches in the comical gags.  In the famous stateroom scene, he points out the way Groucho talks at just the right moments and all the people seem oblivious to the situation are what make the scene funny.  He praises the great pantomimic skills of Harpo, and thoughtfully suggests that although he might have been a great silent film star, his talent really belongs in a sound world.  He gives his thoughts on Chico's patently fake Italian accent.  He also laments that in the age of political correctness, Marx Brothers' films may seem pass.  He says although there seems to be improvisations, the dialogs are often so intricately constructed that improvisations are often not possible.  He also recounts a few anecdotes, such as the Brothers' showing up naked in producer Irving Thalberg's office at one time.

The disc includes a typical half-hour making-of featurette ""Remarks on Marx, which is interesting, for me, mainly for the few minutes of appearance by Kitty Carlisle, who recalls how she was originally not allowed to sing with her voice.  A 20-minute musical short from 1937, ""Sunday Night at the Trocadero,"" is included, and it features performances by Connee Boswell, The Brian Sisters, George Hamilton and his ""Music Box Music"" Orchestra, and a cameo by Groucho.  The audio quality is so poor on this piece that I can only hear every other word.  An amusing ten-minute short ""How to Sleep"" from 1935, starring Robert Benchley, is also present, as well as the theatrical trailer for A NIGHT AT THE OPERA.  There is also a 5-minute TV appearance by Groucho in which he also recalls the naked incident in Thalberg's office.",1084060800,28,4576,4.950261780104712
1182843,5,B0000040EK,"When the Marx Brothers shifted from Paramount Pictures to MGM, they had been in decline at the box-office and they  were worried.  Their new producer, the boy-wonder and ueber-mogul, Irving Thalberg, told them that their next film, ""A Night at the Opera"", would have half as many laughs and make twice as much money.  He was right.

Fans of the Marx Brothers are split as to whether the carefully crafted ""A Night at the Opera"" is better than or inferior to the manic and chaotic Paramount features.  I find myself in full agreement with the two most knowledgeable Marx Brothers fans of them all, Groucho and Harpo.  Both say in print that ""A Night at the Opera"" is the best film they ever made.

The Marx Brothers spent the first half of their careers in small-time vaudeville.  In fact they never made it into the big-time vaudeville circuit with such mega-stars as W.C. Fields, Eddy Cantor and Fanny Brice.  Being the Marx Brothers, they made the wildly unlikely jump from vaudeville obscurity to Broadway hit with a show called (for no good reason that Groucho could ever recall) ""I'll Say She Is"".  Their next hit show was ""The Coconuts"", which Paramount filmed during the day in New Jersey while they performed at night on New York's Great White Way.

The Brothers never forgot or lost faith in their vaudeville roots.  They did not create their comedy, they forged it before live audiences, seeking shades of nuance or timing by direct experience.  In the expansive Hollywood of Thalberg's day, MGM not only understood the Brothers' ways, it put them on the road to test out their comic paces.  Many years ago, when this film first showed up on televison, my father told me that he had seen the Brothers do the stateroom scene at (I think) the Golden Gate Theater in San Francisco.  He remarked that the staged scene had been rather different from the filmed version.  Alas, I did not think to ask him what the differences were.  Ah, well, I was young and foolish then.

So much for the Marx Brothers, now to the opera part of ""A Night at the Opera"".  Believe it or not, much of the material in the movie is not all that exaggerated:

-  Lassparri, the tenor-villain is portrayed as a self-centered womanizer.  In our own time, a rather well-known tenor has certainly been accused of treating female choristers as though they were part of his harem.

-  Famous soprano A, not so many years ago, famously ejected slightly less famous soprano B from her assigned dressing room at the Metropolitan Opera because B's room was a few steps closer to the stage than A's.

-  The wonderful Margaret Dumont portrays Mrs. Claypool as a wealthy woman who turns her money into artistic clout and becomes the object of pursuit by both charlatan (Groucho) and impresario (Sig Ruman).  The old Metropolitan Opera House was originally built because the previous building did not have the requisite number of boxes to seat all the aspiring Mrs. Claypools in sufficient glory.

-  The misadventures of Sig Ruman's choleric impresario are not so very different from those of Giulio Gatti-Cazzaza, general manager of the Metropolitan Opera during the glory days of Caruso, McCormack and Ferrar.  The latter two, for example, were often profitably teamed by Gatti-Cazzaza as the doomed lovers in ""Carmen"", despite the inconvenient fact that they actively despised each other.  And Gatti-Cazzaza had it easy in comparison with the fabulously harried Colonel Mapleson, who spent years on the road with troupe after troupe of operatic misfits and oddballs.

Kitty Carlisle, who plays Rosa, was actually a star of middling magnitude at the Met.  As movie actors go, she sings extraordinarily well, although I would not have cast her as the formidable Leonora in ""Il trovatore"" [note the correct spelling and capitalization, you non-opera fans.]  Kitty Carlisle Hart is one of those wonderful creatures whose existence has made the world a better place.  When last I caught sight of her, she was as radiant as ever and had become in the real artistic life of New York what Mrs. Claypool had only aspired to.

Allan Jones (father of crooner Jack Jones) was a tenorish baritone or maybe a baritonal tenor whose real strength was in operetta.  He gets through what are, in fact, the relatively easy portions of the killer role of Manrico with considerable grace.

Some Amazon reviewers have indulged in hand-wringing about all the music introduced into the film at the expense of the Brothers.  Except for the operatic material, Kitty Carlisle's only song is a pleasant operetta-ish duet with Jones called ""Alone"".  Jones has just one more, ""Cosi Cosa"", a big song and dance production number filled with comic bits for the Brothers.

Finally, the opera:

""Il trovatore"" is recognized by opera buffs as simultaneously one of the most thrilling masterpieces ever composed and one of the silliest things ever to be put on stage--all this before the Marx Brothers ever took a hand.  Without the Marxist interpretation, the ""Il trovatore"" production shown on the screen would probably have been rated as pretty good with an adequate (but no more) soprano, excellent production values for the gypsy chorus scene and a crackling good tenor--not Jones but the villain, Lassparri.  I've never been able to find out who he was, but whoever dubbed in the singing voice of Lassparri was a  tenor of the first rank.  (Aureliano Pertile, maybe?)  I am always a little disappointed that when he storms back onto the stage to make a comeback, he is booed off before he gets out more than the words ""Mal reggendo--""

Thalberg knew his business.  The Marxes knew theirs.  This is their joint masterpiece and one of the greatest comedies ever made.

1182845,5,B0000040EK,"""A Night At The Opera"" is tied with ""Duck Soup"" at being the #1 best Marx brother movie! Otis B. Driftwood (Groucho) with Fiorello (Chico) and Tomasso (Harpo) try to get opera newcomer Ricardo Baroni (Alan Jones) to be the center of the New York Opera company instead of Rodolfo Lasparri. On the night debut of Lasparri in New York, Groucho makes a very funny speech before the opera starts. He concludes with, ""Let there be dancing in the streets, drinking in the saloons, and necking in the parlor. Play, Don."" The result: one hilarious evening complete with a baseball game skit, a scenery change during the opera, Lasparri's kidnapping, and Baroni becoming the star of the opera with Rosa (Kitty Carlisle) back in the biz. Excellent Marx Brothers masterpiece!",1043107200,3,763,4.876923076923077
1182846,5,B0000040EK,"If ""A Night At The Opera"" is more sentimental and romantic than its Zeppo-ized predecessors, it's also less of a photographed vaudeville sketch show also. Many of the Marx Brothers' comic routines were first tried out on the Broadway stage, and the funniest routines, or sketches, were what ended up in their movies. Their earlier films were just more sketch-driven; this one is more plot-driven. I appreciate the fact that the writers took the time to integrate a plausible book and plot (financing for the opera and the 'big break' for the 2 singers) into the insane antics of the 3 Marxes. Just because they were a support system for a romantic subplot doesn't mean they were any less broad, inventive, or hilarious. The crammed stateroom take and the wrecked opera are proof positive of this. I truly don't get all of the collective complaining about this one being too sentimental and music heavy. What film 'didn't' feature Chico (on piano) and Harpo (on harp) in at least one musical interlude? It's a smash hit at 90 minutes.",1032307200,,1033,4.808988764044944

1182848,5,B0000040EK,"The zany brothers create havoc in fashionable opera circles. There are few of the unfunny interludes which mar the latter Marx films, although the romantic interlude between Kitty Carlisle and Allan Jones provide the obligatory streak of sentiment. Groucho dominates the first half of the film, his eyebrows undulating as he insults Dumont at front, rear and everywhere - and requesting from a waiter a glass of milk from a milk-fed chicken (!). But when Harpo comes in to view with his faun-like leers and rather eccentric appetite (for tie-and-cigar sandwiches); he swings into command at the climax in the New York Opera House. This scene is unforgettable and brilliantly paced as it shows the Brothers disrupt a gala performance of IL TRAVATORE - it even includes some scalpel-sharp digs at American ""moeurs"". Classic bits: Groucho sells peanuts to an affronted first-night audience...Harpo and Chico toss a baseball over the heads of the Orchestra. Their cheekiness, their desire (and ability) to stultify bourgeois decorum, and the unparalleled combination of Groucho and Chico's linguistic wit with Harpo's almost demonic miming, ensure another victory for the Brothers Marx. The last vintage Marx Bros. film, this was produced by the legendary MGM mogul Irving Thalberg who died two years after this film was made, in 1937.",1018051200,,1331,5.253521126760563

1182850,5,B0000040EK,"Although I think ""Duck Soup"" is the funniest movie ever made, ""A Night at the Opera"" is probably each of the brothers at their best.  Groucho zings and sings to the dismay of anyone who is unlucky enough to provide him the opportunity.  But in this movie, his timing and air are perfectly tuned to insult yet keep just a hair away from the mean side.
Harpo gives the villains expert come-up-ingness and goes from angelic to demonic with unadorned glee.  He keeps the Grouch and Chic chemistry together seamlessly and of course plays  wonderfully as always.
Chico is the toughest clown for me to figure out since he goes from comic to straight man and back again and you never know which one you're going to get.  But in this movie his wit outshines them all, whether he's not going to believe in the ""Sanity Claus"" or if he's figuring out how to out-outwit Groucho in his take for being a manager.
All this and a story with some good singing by Kitty Carlyle and Allan Hale and Margaret Dumont dowages perfecly.

1182851,5,B0000040EK,"""A Night At the Opera"", the Marx Bros. sixth film, released in 1935, will make opera lovers very squimish indeed.  Groucho, playing Otis B. Driftwood, has been hired by Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont) to place her into society.  All he has done thus far is to draw a very handsome salary, which he later states, ""How many people are drawing a handsome salary these days""; a reference to the Depression Era.
In the opening scene, Groucho has arranged for Dumont to meet Herman Gottleib (Sig Ruman), the dirctor of the New York Opera Company, at a restaraunt in Milan.  Dumont sits alone at a table, waiting for Groucho, not knowing he is dining with a blonde directly behind her, which leads to Groucho's line, ""When I dine with a woman I expect her to look at my face - that's the price she has to pay"".
With the introduction of Mrs. Claypool and Gottlieb, it is off to the Opera to sign the leading opera tenor, Rodolfo Lassparri (Walter Woolf King).  Groucho, just in time to catch the last few minutes of the opera, scorns his carraige driver for not driving slower, and orders him to drive around the park once more.  ""On account of you, I nearly heard the opera"", he bellows to the driver.
Lassparri is to be paid a thousand dollars a night to sing for the New York Opera Company; and it is at this jucture Groucho sees his influence on Mrs. Claypool diminishing.  He needs a piece of the action, otherwise he will be left out cold.  Rushing to sign the tenor first he spots Lassparri, unaware of who he is, beating up on Hapro, who plays Lassparri's dresser.  ""Hey you big bully,"" Groucho says, ""stop beating up on that little bully"".  Harpo knocks the tenor out with a sandbag just as Chico enters.
The two begin a humorous dialogue with leads to Groucho signing the wrong tenor.  The contract to be signed is continually shredded by the two, as neither can come to an agreement to any of the stipulations.  The tail end comes as Chico asks what part of the contract this is.  ""That?  Oh, that just says if anyone is shown not to be in their right mind, the contract is null and void.""
Chico then reveals that Groucho has signed Ricardo Baroni (Allen Jones) to the contract, and not Lassparri; though, nothing has actually been signed; and Gottlieb ultamitely signs Lassparri first.
Lassparri and Baroni are in love with the same woman, Rosa (Kitty Carlisle), another opera singer.  She, at Lassparri's insistance has also been signed to the New York Opera Company, and are to take a cruise ship to the states.  She is in love with Baroni, but lacking money he will not marry her.
All are now aboard the cruise ship, including Chico, Harpo, and Baroni, who are there as stowaways.  Groucho discovers all three in his oversized trunk.  Gottlieb has personally picked out Groucho's  stateroom, which turns out to be smaller than a bathroom, leading to the classic scene where person after person is piled into the room until nor more can be held.
Starving, Chico, Hapro and Baroni slip away to get something to eat, putting themselves at risk for capture.  Chico says, ""If they catch us, they got to feed us.""  Chico and Hapro play their trademark instruments for the amusement of poor immigrants until Gottlieb discovers them and has the three put in the brig.
Three bearded aviators are also aboard, and the three stoways subdue them and don their clothes, as well as their beards, which allows them to slip off the ship when it docks in New York.  They are led to a podium where a large crowd of people have gathered to celebrate the feat of the aviators.  Groucho is the only one who knows they are imposters until Harpo, asked to give a speach, drinks glass after glass of water, wetting the fake beard and loosening it from his chin.
Detective Henderson (Robert O'connor) chases them all, and tracks them to Groucho's room.  Before getting there, the Marx Bros. enjoy one last meal, where Harpo dines on a hotcake sandwich, stuffed with Groucho's cigar and Chico's tie.  Henderson arrives, and Chico and Harpo flee, leaving Groucho to explain their whereabouts.  Henderson begins to look around, and is amazed to find that the adjacant room keeps changing, and furniture keeps disappearing.  ""There was one bed in here, now there's two"", Henderson says to Groucho,  ""Well, you know those things breed like rabbits.""
In the meantime, Lassparri makes one more attempt to attain Rosa's love, only to discover that Baroni is there too.  This is the final straw. he goes to Gottlieb with the news and he persuades Mrs. Claypool to fire Groucho.
With Groucho out of a job, and discovering that Lassparri has replaced Rosa with another singer, the stage is set for revenge against the opera company, its director, and overpaid tenor.
The Marx Bros. reek havoc at the opening of Il Trovatore, replacing the musical score with ""Take Me Out To The Ballgame"", and committing other offenses true opera lovers would surely find troubling and unnerving.

(Remember At The Circus?)  The songs are easily forgetable, but they are pleasant.
