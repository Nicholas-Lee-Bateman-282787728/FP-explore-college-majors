GREAT TO SEE THIS SCREEN GEM ON DVD WITH THE EXTRAS-

THANK YOU AND KEEP ON MAKING GREAT WORK!",1180569600,,157,3.875
8088341,5,B000BKJ77Q,"Well, it is a tossup between this one and SCORPIO RISING, (which I see as a kind of small opera). I find this one hilariously funny even after all these DECADES. the only other movie I could not live without seeing is IVAN THE TERRIBLE. To have seen these movies when they just came out in noisy odd NY places----I tell you, it was a window into a whole other world, and today I believe I live in that world, because I had the blueprints to build it.",1155427200,4,450,4.125
8088342,5,B000BKJ77Q,"i loved the music soundtrack throughout SOTF.

i loved the sets design.

liked the narration.

liked the acting.

lots of color and shadows and closeups

and camera angles.

you have to make an adjustment if you're only used to mainstream cinema.

you just slow everything down to the level of what mr. Kutcher had to work with back in those days.

once there, you can appreciate the simple beauty of what he put together.

and i rate highly the accompaning commentary Mike gives.

he's an entertaining informative guy.

this dvd comes with two additional shorter films.

""the craven sluck"" was as enjoyable as SOTF and as nice to watch in its black and white state as SOTF is to watch in all its glaring colors.

i'm very happy this is out on dvd. i look forward to any other delightful underground film to be unearthed.",1138752000,2,821,4.5793103448275865
8088343,5,B000BKJ77Q,"Silly and campy and yet aesthetically intriguing.  Sins of the Fleshapoids is one of the most important Avant-Garde films ever made.  No wonder filmmakers Ken Jacobs and Jonas Mekas originally praised their work back in the 50's for this is one of a kind.  As Mike Kuchar's first 16mm film (and most widely recognized) it was of pivotal inspiration for contemporaries such as John Waters and David Cronenberg.

Low budget filmmakers keep your pen and paper in hand while watching this one and thank your lucky stars that Craig Baldwin and Other Cinema decided to distribute this for the first time in legitimate, amazing quality home video.",1132790400,2,640,4.953271028037383
