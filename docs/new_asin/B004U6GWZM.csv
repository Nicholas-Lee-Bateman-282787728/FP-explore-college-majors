Each season has between four and six discs (20 DVDs in total), and the discs are stored inside five standard clear DVD-sized cases (one per season).  The five cases are stored inside a very thick and sturdy box.  Also included is a slipcover that wraps around the outer box.

Overall, this set is very high-quality box set that fans of the show will love.  However, in terms of actual DVD content, there is nothing exclusive to the complete series set.  So if you already own each season separately then there really is no reason to upgrade (unless you really like the outer box).",1325289600,10,1015,6.593984962406015
4466538,5,B004U6GWZM,I bought it on bestbuy.com for $24.99 (they have it mispriced as of this post). I already watched the first couple episodes and it's pretty good. For $5 a season I'm really happy!!!,1324339200,3,181,4.515151515151516
4466539,2,B004U6GWZM,"My low 2 Star rating is only for this Complete Set. I give the series as a whole 5 STARS. I wholeheartedly recommend owning the series, in either this form or individual seasons. But if you already own seasons one through four on dvd, don't bother with this set. There is nothing new going on here. Every extra is something that has already been seen on the individual season dvds. And according to the description here it may or may not contain the prequels from the season three set. You'd think we could have gotten some new commentary, or interviews with extended cast members, or audition footage, or bloopers, or gag reel, OR ANYTHING NEW. So if you don't own any Big Love yet, go right ahead a get this set. But if you already have others, just complete your collection with the individual sets. Wasted opportunity to really give a fitting farewell to an undervalued, excellent show that never really got the support and accolades it deserved.",1319932800,8,950,4.660714285714286
4466540,5,B004U6GWZM,I bought the boxed set out of curiousity about this show. I am so glad I did! It was interesting and exciting. I loved it! It is a very dynmaic show that teaches alot about the polygamist faith and history.,1484438400,,206,4.175
4466541,5,B004U6GWZM,"I originally started watching this show when aired on hbo. I became hooked and never missed a episode. But after line issues (I have over head power lines).

4466546,4,B004U6GWZM,"Very weird look inside of a polygamist family.  Great acting by Bill Paxton, Jean Tripplehorn, Chloe Sevigny and Ginnifer Goodwin with a good storyline.

4466549,3,B004U6GWZM,"I really enjoyed the first two seasons of this series for its novelty, but it then lost me by the third season. I felt that the writing took an unfortunate path of over-dramatization, wherein the real potential for the series was in detailing a more relatively mundane day-today existence of a polygamous independent fundamentalist Mormon family.

Instead, the plot became overly dramatic with too many murder and other criminal subplots that always arrived one on top of the other. Also, the family drama was overdone especially with Nicki's character who became insufferable. There was almost zero normalcy after the second season, with one exaggerated subplot after the other engaging the family with no time to breath. I enjoyed the tension of the intrigue brought on by the conflict with the compound and other fundamentalists but, again, it was overwritten.

For a subculture that needs support rather than persecution outside of dysfunctional compounds that exist precisely because their religion is technically illegal, this series really didn't do them any favors despite it being sometimes billed as tolerance advocacy. Would the LGBT community be happy if the first real fictional series about them portrayed them as a bunch of gangsters? Polygamy should have had their ""Will & Grace"" (in terms of messaging, not the style of show) before their ""Big Love"". One would think that the criminal subplots would be enough ham-fisted critique, but the writers also found time to slip in a hefty dose of social politicizing that is also currently counter to their beliefs. With friends like that, well...

I thought that Bill Paxton was great in his portrayal of the type of man that would succeed in successfully carrying such a family. I'd like to see a toned down series, with a similar Patriarch, that treats the subject matter a little less dramatically and which can resist biased  political messaging.",1436054400,,1911,5.135048231511254
4466550,4,B004U6GWZM,"The show is great but it still left me wanting more character development. I wasn't given as much entry into each character's true thoughts and feelings as I wanted. By the fifth season some of the drama became annoying and excessive. I would have loved more focus on some of the side stories of the smaller character parts. By Season 5, the character of Nikki was insufferable. As was Bill's. Some of the things that were said by some characters didn't warrant a realistic response. I can't imagine anyone letting so many verbal insults/behaviors slide in real life.  Overall though, I was on a ride with this family and did enjoy it. Wish there was a spin off.",1432166400,,662,4.610169491525424
4466551,5,B004U6GWZM,I love the series and enjoyed watching again .,1426982400,,46,4.222222222222222
4466552,5,B004U6GWZM,I love this show with amazing cast and great storyline. I'm so glad that I bought this complete set. Great packaging and arrived in timely manner!,1425168000,,146,4.653846153846154
4466553,3,B004U6GWZM,"the first two seasons were fresh and interesting; a new story for TV and good casting. I don't know if the writers ran out of ideas or if there was pressure to get ratings, but the plot gets ginned up to ridiculous levels by season 4. By then mainstream characters are choking, burning alive, dismembering, bombing, leading raids to Mexico, etc.. I was eager for it to end.",1424995200,,373,4.5
4466554,5,B004U6GWZM,"Loved the series, great buy!",1420675200,,28,4.8

4466559,5,B004U6GWZM,I fell in live with this show when it was originally on and just had to have it for my collection. Buying the complete series at once was nice because it saved a little money and you don't have to wait to start the next season.,1396224000,,227,3.9565217391304346
4466560,4,B004U6GWZM,Comes with everything except tons of extras.  You'd think after five years they would have had more material and interviews.  That honks me off.  But the show's all there.,1394755200,,171,4.827586206896552
4466561,4,B004U6GWZM,"I remember seeing previews for this show when it was on tv & had planned on watching an episode one day but never got around to it.  When I had the time to watch it was when I found out the show had gone off the air. That was the reason for purchasing it, & I'm glad I did. It was worth the purchase price and I'm sure I would have been a follower of the show when it was on tv.",1393286400,,378,3.6097560975609757
4466562,5,B004U6GWZM,Bill Paxton is a great actor and this series was top notch.  Has a great story.  Needed the fifth season and decided to buy the whole series.,1390953600,,141,4.185185185185185
4466563,3,B004U6GWZM,"this series is interesting but a glimpse of a small and odd sub - subculture in our American society; but I was not overly impressed with some of the acting and the story line seemed a bit odd and fragmented. on the other hand my uncle absolutely loved it, but then different strokes for different folks I guess. a bit slow moving.",1386374400,,331,4.354838709677419
4466564,5,B004U6GWZM,"Everyone comes away from movies, books and TV shows with a different take on it. The subject matter sparks some controversy by some so I'll skip that since if you are here you get what the basic premise is around! What some who haven't seen it don't get it the show is really about desire to achieve and growth, initially around Bill Henderson's character.....who we slowly come to find was kicked out on the streets at 14 and forced to do implied unsavory things to survive (though never told in detail). His legal wife survives cancer helped by Nikki, who we find becomes wife #2 and later their babysitter Margie becomes young wife #3. Bill owns a hardware/home improvement store and is just opening a second. His attempts to open a third are blocked by a shady character from --the compound-- who apparently lent him money to open the first and felt he was owed a piece of each store thereafter. Bill's thirst for being more and power goes on to owning a casino and later becoming a senator hoping to make polygamy recognized and legal.

Through much of the series it would seen his legal wife, Barb, just goes along...almost dragged along...for the ride but eventually finds her own voice and calling as do, in their own ways, his other 2 wives. The fifth and final season seems more to be a moral lesson in the fate of wanting more than one should and the consequences with the slow decline and eventual murder of him by a neighbor on hard times over something stupid. Meanwhile each of the three wives evolves immensely by season 5 with Barb going on to become a female minister/leader (or Mormon off-shoot equivalent), Nikki finding emotions and love and getting beyond the compound robotic programming she came with and Margie emerges from empty headed ditz to helping causes and the needy around the world. There's many twist and turns along the way but that is the basic deal and I think many miss this being side-tracked by the stigma of polygamy and Bill's initial control --we see him slowly losing throughout season five-- and ambitions.to prove, maybe more to himself than anyone, that he isn't throwaway trash as he was treated as a child. Don't misunderstand, Bill isn't a bad guy just someone that tends to be caught up in proving himself....sometimes with a conman-like rational. We find out in the first episode of season 5 exactly the breakdown in a scene between Bill and Barb whee he says a husband leads and his wives after consult follow in harmony and her response is less than agreeable.

It's an amazing journey even though, as other note, season 4 seems a bit dismal and lost focus in the writing and is somewhat out of step with where season three leaves off but season five more than gets back on track. While I am NOT a polygamist, I can see how lonely people with no one can gravitate to this lifestyle. Kudos to Tom Hanks for his part in making this show happen!",1384992000,5,2897,4.601547388781431
4466565,5,B004U6GWZM,"I loved this show from the first season, to the last. What he tried so hard for his family, whether it would be for one or all three. The three relationships all different but they loved the same. The ending got to me, but what a finale.",1373068800,,237,4.0638297872340425
4466566,5,B004U6GWZM,Funny series and fun to be able to catch up one right after another.  I have loaned this set to friends.,1372464000,,104,3.9523809523809526
4466567,5,B004U6GWZM,"I only got to watch a couple of episodes of the first season this series came out, then I got rid of cable/satellite TV in the house.  I always wondered how this show did over the 5 seasons it was on.  So I decided that I had to buy all the seasons and watch it and find out what happened!
I started watching these just as soon as they arrived.  I really enjoyed these and will watch them all over again. I loved the story line, it's so different and so well, kind of naughty, and the lives of these folks are hidden away and we get to see what they are like! It's so much fun to hate Nicki and love Barb and see what a baby Margene is sometimes.
Bill Henrickson and his three wives Barb, Nicki, and Margene provide so much good watching.  Then when you get around to the folks on the 'compound' and their issues and problems and how that is interwoven into the Henrickson's lives... great watching!
The ending is a real shocker, never in a million years did I expect that end!
This boxed set is perfect if you don't have any of the seasons as I didn't.  The packaging is good as well.  Happy happy happy with these.  :)",1371081600,,1120,4.1336405529953915

4466569,5,B004U6GWZM,"I am from Utah and used to be Mormon. The writing, acting and the script are right on. The characters are perfectly casted.
The story is real life Mormonism at it's finest. I love the look on Bill's face when he get's in problems with his 3 wife's, Why did he do this?. The CD packaging and quality are excellent, a little expensive but well worth it!",1365552000,,351,4.253731343283582
4466570,5,B004U6GWZM,Love this box set.  It is the same as buying each season seperately.  Inside the box each case is there just like you bought them one by one.,1359590400,2,141,4.0

4466572,5,B004U6GWZM,"I had oringally caught a couple episodes on HBO, the show hadintrigued me.  Now I can watchall the episodes from start to finish",1358208000,,128,4.565217391304348
4466573,5,B004U6GWZM,"I love this show, the boxed set contains the complete series, all 5 seasons and if you've never seen the show before because you weren't interested, didn't have the time, or didn't have HBO (like me), you should youtube clips and see that this show is awesome. Funny, dramatic, happy, chaotic and brings real life into a fictitious storyline. Mothers juggling work, school, children and a husband. Bickering couples and the ups and down we women face. Times of happiness, depression, questions of faith and the afterlife, religion. Politics, religion, and state where do they seperate and draw the line? It's a lovely chaotic crazy life, Big Love <3 I have lots of love for this show.",1357084800,7,684,4.854700854700854
4466574,4,B004U6GWZM,"Again, I really wish we could give half-star ratings, because I believe it deserves more than 4 stars but not quite 5. Overall, this series was excellent. I've watched it numerous times and it always stands up. This series takes true-life elements (Colorado City = Juniper Creek) and weaves them seamlessly into the fictional story of Bill Henrickson and his three wives. In the end, though, this story is really about Barb, his first wife, and how she reconciles the conflicts of her faith with her conscience and the genuine if conflicted love she has for her husband and her two sister-wives. The ending of the show, if you really pay attention to what's happening, is absolutely amazing.

I wish we got a little bit more of the extended family in the last season (where did Joey and Wanda go?), and I think there was more to explore here if the writers had been up to it. And it's always jarring when an actress or actor is replaced in the middle of a series (Teeny). Some of what happened in the fourth season was absurd. And I got really tired of a certain Yugoslavian character by the time she was done. However, those complaints aside, this series is fascinating, marvelously scripted, really funny at times, also really heartbreaking when you consider how much of it is based on reality.

This is one of those series that I like to go back to from time to time. My overall worldview is about 180 degrees opposed to the fictional Henricksons' and I probably could never be friends with them if they lived down the block, and yet I still feel like I'm visiting old friends when I watch this. It helps that this show is not shy with the irony but that it also explores really meaningful issues, particularly given how nearly a Mormon came to winning the election. (And yes, I know the Mormon Church officially denounced polygamy over 100 years ago. This show explores more than just that one issue.)

In fact, writing this review has made me think that maybe it's time to visit the Henricksons again...",1352592000,,2008,4.603351955307263
4466575,5,B004U6GWZM,"Ok, I accidentally got hooked on this show by a friend of mine a few years ago.  Ever since I saw the first episode, I was hooked.  This is a great series.  Very entertaining.  I also appreciate them giving life to a sample of American culture that is really not spoken about.",1350086400,,276,4.25
4466576,5,B004U6GWZM,"I don't know that much about Mormons and their history, so I don't know if this series accurately portrays the current religious and political situations. However, I really enjoyed the frank treatment of this unconventional life style. I think Chloe Sevigny did the most outstanding character portrayal a Nikki, as did Grace Zabriskie as Lois. Never been a Bill Paxton fan. Always seemed more of a ""beta"" male, but carried off his character well enough.

I had a few scratched disks, and twice an episode near its end would not play through. As is often the case, I purchase these shows months before I watch them. When I received this set I knew it may be a while before I watched it, so inspected the disks and saw the scratches. I played them through the menus and scenes and all items and scene skips worked ok so I did not attempt to return it. But you never really know until you watch all the way through ...",1342137600,2,915,4.479041916167665
