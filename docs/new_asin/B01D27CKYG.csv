7696122,5,B01D27CKYG,"This movie is fantastic.  I beautiful work of art, nestled withing a brilliant and touching story!

Be ready for the feels, because this movie will bring you to tears.  Focusing first on a little girl with a strict and high expectation, her neat and efficient world is turned upside-down with the appearance of the old aviator!  She sees him as frivolous at first, but when she reads a small portion of his ""story"", she begins to grow closer to him.  His story is the hidden gem of this movie, as he relates the tale of The Little Prince, the classic story brought to new life!

I recommend this movie to everyone, all ages!

It's not growing up that's the problem, it's forgetting!",1470355200,19,682,4.540983606557377
7696123,5,B01D27CKYG,"Amazing movie, hands down my favourite animated movie this year, beating out Finding Dory. I can't jidge the english or Cantonese voice acting, though the english voice actor cast has some serious star power. The French voice acting though was perfect to me. The animation is beautiful, especially for the book sections. Overall loyal to the book and an amazing message.",1469750400,,370,5.081967213114754
7696124,3,B01D27CKYG,"It's been a year looking for a fair price on the 3D version of this rare free adaptation of the Antoine De Saint-Exupery children book ""The Little Prince"". First I ordered 2 bluray at Amazon.com.mx(Mexico) at +/- $ 12.oo, but it was edited in French and Spanish only. I started to like it more than the first time I see with my wife. Absolutly as others reviewers put it a single frase: THE STORY INSIDE THE STORY. My point: Don't buy the 3D release because You don't have ANY pop out, neither see the layers of profundity...they simple let out go the chance to make a PLUS in a universal children book like The Little Prince. My Grandson who read the book(He's in the last week of his 3th Grade) already without the 3D glases invited meto play badmington as the sun goes down. So again: The Little Prince 3D is one of the worst attempts. Has non adventage over the DVD or Bluray.",1527724800,,880,4.371951219512195
7696125,5,B01D27CKYG,"""James Franco""? He voices the fox, a couple minutes of speaking time if that.
Somehow Amazon left off Jeff Bridges, as The Aviator who is the story teller, who is most of the film and just brilliant!
It really is lovely.",1527292800,,220,4.390243902439025
7696126,5,B01D27CKYG,"Brilliant film.  I showed it to my French students after we had read the original & they loved the graphics, quoted the book along with the movie & even cried at some parts (me too!)!!!  Sweet movie with some really good updates to the original story.",1526688000,,251,4.434782608695652

7696128,5,B01D27CKYG,"Enjoyable for all ages. Thoughtful and entertaining. Music, dialogue, characterization, animation, storyline and plot were all well done. My teen & college age kids especially like the messages since they are currently having to make choices about what is important in life.",1526256000,,274,5.5476190476190474
7696129,3,B01D27CKYG,I love the movie!  I'm disappointed that I've purchased two of them and the discs appear to be flimsy-as they have both cracked when gently trying ot remove from the case.,1524009600,,171,4.516129032258065
7696130,5,B01D27CKYG,A wonderful rendition.,1522022400,,22,6.666666666666667
7696131,1,B01D27CKYG,"The original story is engaging, of course, but I have a problem in this day and age with a girl (or boy) -of any age -going alone into a strange old man's camp and her mother, upon finding out, is upset only because her daughter lied and did not stick to her minute to minute life schedule. Problematic. This editorial is not about Saint-Exupery's work but this rendition by James Franco. Very problematic.
I recognize the movie presents the relationship as terribly innocent, not even a whiff of impropriety; but that's not the world we live in. If I had an young daughter I would read The Little Prince to her but would not let her see this movie lest she believe an old man's invitation to come into his home for childish amusement is perfectly innocent and acceptable.
The sad reality of the times we live in should not be ignored. I'm afraid this movie sends a dangerous message to naive, little children that a snake, obviously, is to be feared, but the strange man next door bearing toys and darling stories is just lovely. He is not.",1521849600,,1041,4.5132275132275135
7696132,5,B01D27CKYG,"Perfect condition and ultra quick shipping! This is an absolutely wonderful movie based on the Little Prince book, mind you, its an interpretation of the book, thus, not entirely a representation of what you would read.

I highly recommend this DVD and am looking forward to popping it into our dvd player ",1519776000,,306,4.865384615384615
7696133,5,B01D27CKYG,Absolutely phenomenal film. Just gorgeous imagery and wonderfully textured story. I enjoyed this as much as my 2 and 4 year old did. Ive give this as a gift and is one of my favorite animated films. Breathtaking.,1519171200,2,212,4.605263157894737

7696135,5,B01D27CKYG,"Great movie with a wonderful lesson about maintaining and cultivating curiosity, playfullness, and adventure at every stage of life.  Themes: find your unique call and talent, design your own life, happiness, relationships, friends, self knowledge.
Highly recommended for all ages. Adults and children will all take away important lessons. Also very artistically done!",1519171200,2,368,5.943396226415095

7696137,3,B01D27CKYG,The story and almost everything about the movie is wonderful. It would seem to me that the fact it is in French would be something that should be prominently displayed. I expected the English version with Jeff Bridges doing the aviator.,1517616000,,236,4.780487804878049
7696138,5,B01D27CKYG,Stumbled onto this movie on Netflix and decided to buy it. It's actually a pretty good movie.,1516838400,,93,4.529411764705882
7696139,5,B01D27CKYG,"The best Little Prince movie I saw! I love the book, and I really liked this movie version of the story. I wish it would be promoted better. Beautiful, engaging, thought provoking. It's good for all the family, and friends and neighbors. It's good for youth groups. The producers made Little Prince to grow up, but in the end he turns into a child again on his planet. It's a beautiful interpretation of the book. It's more like a story about the story, where the characters come alive in a different world. Small kids can follow the story line about the Prince more easily here. It made my kids to want to read the book. Of course you can't just show this movie, and tell that now you know the book. You will have to read the story before or after watching the movie.",1516406400,,768,4.340277777777778
7696140,5,B01D27CKYG,"Such a sweet, touching movie. My boyfriend and I cried at the end. The message of the movie would resonate with everyone I'm sure. Definitely a keepsake in our home!",1515715200,,165,4.533333333333333
7696141,5,B01D27CKYG,Our family's favorite! (but FYI that its NOT the same as the book if you're expecting that),1514246400,,91,4.411764705882353
7696142,5,B01D27CKYG,"I saw this film on Netflix and honestly wasn't expecting much. It was beautiful. It was moving in a way I rarely find many films today.  In the simplest of terms it's a story of a little girl trying to figure out who she is and will grow to be and how her new neighbor and the tale of The Little Prince alters her world. Above all I would say this is a tale about connections and partings. It's also about society's and parent's expectations, individuality, family, friends, and what growing up means.",1513468800,,501,4.387096774193548
7696143,5,B01D27CKYG,"The Little Prince is a fairytale for adults. Despite it's kid-like design, the move isn't flashy or fast paced enough to keep most children's attention. However, it's themes (those of death/loss, growing up, regret, losing oneself and moving on from relationships) are very much things that adults can relate to. And it doesn't help that the movie's animation is absolutely gorgeous and pulls you right into the story. I have never read the actual book the story-within-a-story is based on. I have no idea about it's accuracy. But I do know it's inclusion, a mixture of unique animation and whimsical child-like logic, only added onto the amazing story and themes of this movie.

I don't know how much a child would like it, but I would suggest a watch to any adult who has no problems watching an animated movie about an old man reading a story to a child. You might find the story is a lot more relatable than you think.",1513036800,,922,4.656441717791411
7696144,5,B01D27CKYG,Amazing movie,1509840000,,13,6.0

7696148,5,B01D27CKYG,We fell head over heels for this movie. It was captivating and lovely. The soundtrack was fun because it surged with quiet and loud noises. We loved all the magical imagery and scenes with the stars. We believe the moral of the story is that you are not a grown-up unless you choose to be. Everyone that loves to dream should watch it.,1505865600,,335,4.333333333333333
7696149,5,B01D27CKYG,"Why this gem never received an American Theatrical distribution is beyond my understanding.  I stumbled upon it by chance and was mesmerized at once.  This is one of those rare films that a child and adult can both watch, appreciating it on their level.  The metaphors abound and the pacing makes it a story you will want to watch again and again.  A tad bit long, it is still well worth bringing home as a family event.",1505779200,,420,4.415584415584416
7696150,3,B01D27CKYG,"This is a difficult movie to review, partly because it's three movies. The first is exceptional. Whether one approaches this film hopefully or skeptically, he cannot help but be impressed by the artistry of the first hour. And not only are these people artists, they get it. This is an inarguable ""5"".

But then at the one-hour mark comes the ""blackout"" sequence, and while one can understand the reasoning behind its inclusion -- the production team wants to show how the little girl processes all she's been exposed to regarding the themes of the book -- there are serious missteps here, particularly with regard to how the Prince is portrayed. Yes, children change as they become adults (one hopes they mature), but seriously? This is a ""1"".

Then after the blackout sequence, 31 minutes later, comes a rather surprising ending which is also something of a cheat. One would not expect a ""Hollywood ending"" from a French production but here it is. The Aviator, consistent with the book, says that when he goes, he must go alone. This is one of those ""well, yeah"" profundities which is missed by nearly everyone who is not involved in some way with end-of-life counseling. And it would have made such a bittersweet ending to the movie, particularly with the inclusion of the Aviator's and the Prince's laughter. But we had to have The Scene at the hospital, and while it may make everybody feel good, it is clear that making the audience feel good is the only reason for its inclusion. This deserves no more than a ""3"".

The easiest and simplest way around all this is to jump ahead at the 1:01 mark to 1:32 and skip the blackout section. It becomes a much better movie. Not as good as it might have been with an ending more in keeping with the book, but better. Much better. And no WTF running through one's mind.",1505347200,5,1815,4.630434782608695
7696151,1,B01D27CKYG,"If you like the classic ""Little Prince"" book, don't watch this movie. You will be disappointed. The last half ruined the original book and the character of Little Prince.",1503532800,,170,4.896551724137931

7696159,5,B01D27CKYG,My daughter loves this movie so much that she begged me for the movie on dvd. She has the book and the fox doll from the movie.

7696163,5,B01D27CKYG,"The older I get (I'm 40) and the more I experience of life's highs and lows (more low than high lately), the more I gravitate to movies and stories like this (didn't read the book until later in life, a few years ago).  The stories and characters just feel more real, human, and relateable than most Hollywood stuff.  Right up my alley.  Its like they opened up a new world to me and made me realize its ok to just be myself, not some ""normal"", soulless, successful, macho, ""alpha male"" cliche.  Flawed but basically good hearted people just trying to do their best, in their own messed up way, to make sense of and survive this Type A, capitalist, Trump-loving society and scary world of ""normal"" people and ""grown-ups"" ::shudder::.  Sign me up.  My kind of people.  No wonder America pulled this from theaters right before release :/  Guess this story's message is too much of a challenge for the status quo.

Related to the old man, Little Prince, and little girl protagonists equally (can definitely still relate to familial pressure to conform and be ""successful"").  Great movie about staying true to yourself and your ideals, young at heart, regardless of what others think.  Anyway, so if anyone out there (of all ages) has ever felt different from the herd, ever felt lost, alienated, or like they don't belong in this world, I'd definitely recommend this movie to you, my fellow misfit and kindred spirit :)  If you agree with my review at all, you can mostly find me these days at twitter dot com/ShyLivesMatter Peace :)",1494374400,2,1530,4.689138576779026

7696168,5,B01D27CKYG,Such a great movie. My son's favorite movie.  Such a good storyline and great lessons to learn to just be a kid sometimes instead of growing up so fast and there's so much more to people once you get to know them and their story.,1490918400,,229,4.088888888888889

7696174,3,B01D27CKYG,"I really enjoyed the movie, and the essence of the story is there (being a too-busy adult is sucky). However, the depiction of education as elitist and teachers as torturers sent me over the edge. My students who read the book before seeing the movie were appalled that the Little Prince became a loser and the taming process was a pretty insignificant event in the movie.",1489017600,2,372,4.651515151515151

That being said, I still think I prefer the musical version with Gene Wilder even with its corniness.  This animated version is very well done, and will appeal to a broad audience of kids who may never otherwise be exposed to this wonderful, timeless French classic.

7696192,4,B01D27CKYG,"First of all, the Amazon Marketplace seller, MechaNinja, could not be better.  Five stars plus for prompt delivery, effective packaging, and after sale support better than I would dare ask for.  The movie itself also deserves 5 stars.  My wife and I saw it at the Sedona Film Festival and loved it.  We could not understand why the US theater release was cancelled and the film sold to Netflix, but that is what happened.  One does have to get used to the lollipop proportions of the main characters, but that is a common trait in modern animations.  The use of a different animation technique for the scenes that are taken from text of The Little Prince is masterful.  It is a visually and spiritually rewarding film.  Everybody we have showed this DVD to loved it too.  Now, for the missing star ... that has to do with the packaging stating that there is an English subtitle feature.  As I have very poor hearing, this is a big deal to me. However, if the spoken English version of the movie is played (also French and Cantonese are offered), only Cantonese subtitles are available!  To get English subtitles, you have to watch the movie in French!  I would have preferred to have the US sound track, with Jeff Bridges as The Aviator, and the subtitles as well, but this is not a choice.  Never mind, I love this movie and will just watch it in French one day and by this means read the script!",1480982400,5,1397,4.474308300395257
7696193,4,B01D27CKYG,"French author, aviator, and national hero Antoine de Saint-Exupery's book, The Little Prince, has been adapted in just about every way imaginable all around the world. There's even a Japanese anime of the classic children's story, along with stage plays, radio broadcasts, and comics. But a major U.S. adaptation has been a tough nut to crack, largely because of melancholic tone, adult themes, and its heavily allegorical style, which really isn't the kind of animation we do here for the most part. Hopefully that will change with the irresistible, moving animated film available now on Netflix, a long-developing labor of love that serves as a wonderful allegory about the joys of childhood and remembering them as an adult.

A collaboration between American director Mark Osborne (Kung Fu Panda), screenwriters Irena Brignull (The Boxtrolls) and DreamWorks' Bob Persichetti, along with a good deal of French/Canadian cash, the film is a reflection of its international adoration. That said, this isn't a straight adaptation of the author's rather slim story, but an expansion partially set in modern times, effectively casting the familiar elements as a flashback. The narrative structure is weakened as a result, but the meshing of animation styles is seamless and enhances our overall joy, and the story of a little lost prince from a far-off asteroid will likely cause a few hearts to melt.

Boldly re-examining  Saint-Exupry's story in contemporary context, the film largely centers on a Little Girl (voiced by Mackenzie Foy) whose mother (Rachel McAdams) has planned out her life to an exacting degree. She's uprooted them into the perfect neighborhood and planned out a detailed daily routine right down to the minute in an effort to make this happen. Of course, the pressure is too much for the girl and she fumbles her way through an all-important interview at a prestigious Academy. An unexpected respite from reality arrives with her next door neighbor, The Aviator (Jeff Bridges), an eccentric old man who lives in a rundown carnival of a home with beat-up airplane in the backyard. The She finds some pages of artwork, telling the story of The Little Prince (Riley Osborne, yes the director's son) and how the Aviator met him in a desert. The Prince comes from a far away asteroid the size of a house, but here on Earth he's all alone, an odd, regal child with a flowing scarf and innocent sensibility just like the Aviator had as a boy. They become fast friends, and the Prince tells him of the many people he has met during his brief life: there's The Rose (Marion Cotillard), a vain flower that he has fallen in love with; the Snake (Benicio Del Toro), who is as devious as you might expect; the red Fox (James Franco), the Conceited Man (Ricky Gervais); the King (Bud Cort); and The Businessman (Albert Brooks), who buys up stars just for the sake of owning them.  The Aviator's stories jumpstart the Little Girl's imagination, but of course adults keep trying to make everything so darn serious.

The animation is polished and breath-taking in its detail, a real feat considering the vastly different styles used for each era. The Little Girl's tale is given the full Pixar CGI treatment, a purely American technique that most audiences here will be comfortable with and enjoy. But the Aviator's journeys with the Little Prince are told in a beautiful combination of stop-motion and traditional techniques, which seamlessly meld into their dream-like adventures. Saint-Exupery's core themes are never lost despite the contemporary context; rather they are enhanced by the Aviator's memories and the Little Girl's fresh experiences. These are ideas we as adults have all felt at one time, like the occasional yearning for the simplicity that comes with being a child. Saint-Exupery merely desired that we all remember what it was like before the pressures of adulthood mounted on us, and to not crush the spirit of those who have yet to succumb to it.

A somber tone is struck throughout similar to the novel yet it's never truly sad, with the exception of a revelation that comes near the midway point. It feels appropriate, which is why the third act is a let down as the modern narrative really asserts itself as a spirited yet silly comedy, which is totally opposite of what the film had been. The introduction of an older version of the Little Prince (voiced by Paul Rudd) is a mistake, especially since he's depicted as something of a dufus. It doesn't connect as anything genuine, but like someone was scared there weren't enough laughs. The Little Prince doesn't need to have humor forced upon it; it's already funny, just in measured doses. What it has in abundance is heart, charm, and meaning, the kind that lasts for generations, just as Saint-Exupery's novel has touched the lives of millions for generations.",1480723200,,4842,4.9716049382716045

My 10 year old who doesn't appreciate very much also really loved this movie and was sad when it was over.  He watched it again the next day!  He's also requested the book, which embarrassingly we've never read before.  Just a wonderful movie that many will enjoy!",1480464000,,388,4.632352941176471

As a huge fan of the novel, I had the HIGHEST expectations for this movie. In its attempt to honor the spirit of the story, instead of simply retell it, this movie does a fantastic job.

Even my toddlers (who never watch movies) sat through the whole thing and even requested to see it again later. This is wonderful. There some pretty deep topics, but younger kids may not pick up all of those themes and appreciate it for its face value. Older kids will definitely catch on to the topics and will probably ask lots of questions...something that I think is valuable and important. Brilliantly done!",1473897600,6,591,4.584905660377358

7696221,2,B01D27CKYG,"I knew it would be difficult to do this book justice, but I did not expect anyone to continue with almost half the movie length with added nonsense. This book can stand on its own with no ""heavy-handed slap up side the head"" of what one might draw from the book. I could not say how many times I have read the book. As a teacher I always screened my classes to be sure the students could handle its delicate hand.. Oh, but by all means go watch this cartoon and let yourself be thunked over the noggin' with weird, ugly caricatures of human nature at its worst... Or let the feminists show you that the all male cast (except the rose) needs a female to save the day because the wisest, most magical young prince has grown into a bumbling slapstick of a grown-up.

All the while the art work is bring praised? For what? big big eyes that brim with tears and look like Thumper... Big noses that loom across a face like an extra arm... distorted heads on gray bodies? I guess I hate French cartoons if these ugly humans are an example.

And the writers screwed with the future, the great unknown, the laughing stars, the rose, the planets... I imagine if he could the great St. Ex would fly back into our lives from his mysterious disappearance and stomp on all the extra garbage in this movie.

Why did I give this movie two stars? The story itself was true and sparkling when the cartoon bothered to stick to it. It was fun to see the Little Prince walk across the screen, to watch the well-known treasure rift across the screen in antiqued pages. That is one star there. The other is for that little fox. He rocked his part.

I hate it when the world tries to take something very unique and special, something it takes true heart to perceive... and tries to dumb it down with the Cliff notes, the HELLO, Cable Guy watchers... DO NOT MISS THIS S.U.B.T.L.E PLOT AND THEME....

Those of us who got the book probably did not like the movie. Hate is a strong word, but I really didn't like it... I am disappointed at the positive reviews, but many including Rotten Tomatoes have called it a satisfying story... This cartoon pulled open the curtain to try and leave viewers satisfied. How totally American of us... (aka Disney spinning The Hunchback, Pocahontas, or Greek myth as child's fare)  The book did its level best with ultimate success to leave the reader hungering for more, more? isn't there more? I could not wait for the cartoon to end while the book plays on in unlimited possibilities forever in my soul.",1471392000,10,2513,4.440347071583514

They won't ship direct, and also the film has a non-US region coding that requires a region free Blu-ray 3D player to run (theyre readily available). However, its a magnificent film, even if you're stuck watching it in 2D, and I highly recommend it. Apparently, despite the US one sheet advert that announced a 3D release in the states, it either didn't happen or was very limited. I suspect the money people in charge of distribution just didn't get it.
