3049686,1,B0010SB064,"For all folks who care about the importance of maintaining the original aspect ratios of films and television programs I urge you to avoid this set.  IMO, the cropping of the original 4:3 aspect ratio destroys this visual aesthetics in spite of using better source prints for picture transfers over the first boxed set.

Others may differ, but ignoring or overlooking the problem doesn't mean that there isn't one.  The visual damage from cropping the 4:3 image to fit a 16:9 screen without window-boxing combined with the packaging deception is at the very least tragic, and arguably criminal, since consumers are purchasing butchered product that distorts the artist's original intent; the franchise holder should be ashamed.  Note: The excuses I've read in respect to this botched effort don't inspire confidence that Infinity Entertainment Group will take responsibility and ameliorate the situation.

These should be returned to the vendor for a refund in the hope that the rights holder(s) will get the message and either correct the existing sets by a recall and replacement offer or at least release future seasons in the proper aspect ratio.  Another reason to consider returning the second set as defective is the fact that consumer outrage over the practice of ""tilt & scan"" may be the only means of insuring that other series avoid a similar fate.

The one star rating is given because it's important to clearly delineate an advocacy position on these issues.  Those who care about the BIG picture should say My Way or the Highway to Route 66.",1203033600,26,1555,5.023346303501945
3049687,4,B0010SB064,"Just an alert to those looking at the packaging for Season 1, Volume 2.  The back of the case advertises that the enclosed episodes feature guest stars such as Suzanne Pleshette, Lee Marvin, and Jack Warden.  WRONG.  Those guest stars appeared in the previously released Season 1, Volume 1.

3049688,2,B0010SB064,"Route 66, like all TV shows of its era, was filmed in a squarish 1.33:1 aspect ratio.  But for this ""Volume 2"" DVD set, the manufacturer has shamefully CROPPED the top and bottom of the image to about a 1.77:1 frame.  Essentially, you are missing part of the picture and it ruins the original photography.

Sure, it fills a ""widescreen"" TV, but at what expense? Tops of heads are frequently ""cut off"", and the cropping further deletes some of that wonderful Americana from 1960 that provided the mesmerizing backdrop of this classic series.  The packaging does not warn you of this image tampering, so buyer beware!

While I am personally thrilled that this series is finally out on DVD, I hope that the remaining part of the series release is edited for both video and audio in a much more thorough fashion.
Can't wait for Seasons 2 through 4 to come out, but overall quality does count. Seeing gasoline for 23 cents a gallon and premium tires for a whopping $45 a tire is as nostalgic and real as seeing America in the early 1960's.",1202688000,5,584,4.223214285714286
3049690,1,B0010SB064,"I would gladly give an intelligently produced release of Route 66 five stars. It ranks with the best American TV has to offer. Unfortunately, Kirk Hallam/Roxbury have chosen to disappoint AGAIN. The first 66 set featured mostly poor quality prints, as well as an edited episode. Mr. Hallam has subsequently explained that this was due to pre-Christmas release deadlines. OK, I'll buy that tale, but artificially altering the aspect ratio? Why??? How could a person who is involved in the creative process (Hallam is a film producer) approve such a bastardization of other people's artistic efforts? How would Hallam feel about someone doing that to one of HIS projects? Disgusting. Perhaps the next half- season can be colorized. Obviously Hallam has little/no appreciation for this series or it's historical context (witness the amateurish ""Drive-In Theater"" menu screens). I just wish Image had produced these sets.

The two stars is for Roxbury/Infinity's unaccountable botch job with the fake widescreen aspect ratio. Who thought that trimming the image at the top and bottom was a good idea? It's not: As with Warner's first-season set of ""Kung Fu,"" which was similarly mutilated, it's distracting and disrespectful and makes me regret that I bought the set.

If you haven't yet, consider renting it instead -- or better yet, complain to the company and maybe they'll fix it for a rerelease. Sheesh.",1202342400,24,566,4.885416666666667
3049693,3,B0010SB064,"Hands down, ""Route 66"" was one of the greatest dramas produced in television's golden age.  The acting, writing, and production values for this ""show-on-the-go"" were trend setting for its time and still resonate strongly with this viewer . . . . . surely a five star series if ever there was one.  And that's why it pains me to give this second release from Roxbury Entertainment and the Infinity Entertainment Group only three stars.

The good news is that the visual quality for the episodes contained in this second volume represents an improvement over those in volume 1, at least based upon my viewing of the first two episodes (a good two-parter titled ""Fly Away Home"" with the great Michael Rennie) and spot checking other episodes. The visuals aren't in the same eye-popping category as some other shows from the era that have been released on DVD like the ""The Untouchables"" or ""The Fugitive,"" but they still look pretty good to my eyes and represent an improvement over the vast majority of the episodes contained in volume 1.  The extra features contained in volume 2 follow the same format as the first volume, cast credits and episode clips (to help you identify the actors) and early 1960s era commercials on disc 4.

Now for the bad news, Roxbury and/or Infinity have matted the top and bottom of the episodes to give it a FAKE WIDESCREEN look. So in certain scenes, the tops of the actors' heads are missing. This might not be so readily apparent to viewers who have never seen the show, but after releasing the first 15 episodes in volume 1 in the correct, full-screen aspect ratio, it becomes glaringly apparent.  Even the bonus commercials on disc 4 are matted!  I don't have the slightest idea as to why Roxbury/Infinity decided to go with this format, but if anyone from either of these companies happen to read these reviews, please do not matte any further volumes . . . . . serious viewers of ""Route 66"" want to be able to watch this series in its original, full-screen aspect ratio as originally broadcast.  Had this second volume been released in its correct aspect ratio, without the matted effect, I would most certainly have given this release a full five stars.",1202256000,69,2191,4.717277486910994
3049694,5,B0010SB064,"First, the bad news. The initial ""official"" release by Roxbury of the first fifteen episodes of the brilliant 1960's drama Route 66 was pretty much an unmitigated disaster, unacceptable by any standards of a professional DVD TV series official rerelase. Picture quality of many episodes was inferior to that on tapes of Nickelodeon reruns, showing that absolutely no effort had been made to remaster the films. Worst of all, the episode ""A Fury Slinging Flame"" was an edited for syndication version, missing four and a half minutes of footage. It is patently obvious that the set was put out by an organization that didn't care about quality and was out to make a quick buck. All told, the first Roxbury set was no better than a bootleg. So any fan of the series must look forward to the second set with some trepedation.

On the bright side, the second fifteen episodes of season one of Route 66, in whatever form one is lucky enough to view them in, chronicles one of television's true unheralded classics in the period when it really begins to find its legs. The characters of Tod and Buz are really starting to take on depth, and scripts are becoming more and more character-driven as opposed to the straightforward action-adventure plots which marked the show's earliest efforts. Highlights include:
""Fly Away Home"", an epic two-parter in which Tod and Buz become involved in the life of a fatalistic Phoenix cropdusting pilot (played by Micheal Rennie) in an outstanding, moving and poignant story.
""Like a Motherless Child"", Tod and Buz split up after an argument and orphan Buz later becomes drawn into the life of a lonely elderly woman who previously gave up her own child.
""Most Vanquished Most Victorious"", in which Tod searches for his missing cousin in the slums of L.A. and must confront not only the squalor and cheapness of life there but also the darkness in his own heart.
""Incident on a Bridge"", the season finale, a most unusual love story set against the backdrop of blue-collar Cleveland, involving a physical freak and a mute, cowed servant girl.

The five stars are for the excellence of the classic series. Only time will tell, however, if Roxbury improves upon the horrendous quality of their first set.",1201824000,13,2230,4.850393700787402
3049695,5,B0010SB064,"This is the second half of the first season, comprising 30 episodes. The next 15 shows should include:

Episode 29 -- ""Welcome to Amity"" -- Tod and Buz meet a woman (Susan Oliver), who wants to bury her mother in a nearby cemetery. The people of Amity want to stop her.

Episode 30 - ""Incident on a Bridge"" --Tod and Buz board in a home with an abused, mute girl and her two jealous - and violent - suitors.

The five stars is for the show; I reserve less than 5 for the digital transfer. Do hope the digital transfer is cleaner and the sound better, although I can't hope for much from Roxbury/Infinity who have made this series posible on DVD.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Route-66-Season-1-Vol-1/dp/B000TV1SSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Route 66 - Season 1, Vol. 1</a>&nbsp;could have been better.",1197590400,27,2567,4.621145374449339

This DVD set contains the last half of the show's first season, originally broadcast on CBS from February 1961 to June 1961.

In this superb adventure/drama, Tod Stiles (Martin Milner) and Buz Murdock (George Maharis) are friends and young drifters who roam the country in Tod's Corvette.  They find odd jobs to work along their way, and are carefree at times yet searching at other times.  They encounter runaways and murders as well as many other varied life situations in the places they visit and people they meet--in some, Tod, Buz, and the people they encounter get into circumstances in which they have to deal with their pasts.

The episodes were filmed on location and many took place nowhere near the actual Route 66--some in the Southwestern states of Arizona in New Mexico, but others in places like Ohio, Nevada, and Northern California.  The viewer sees Squaw Valley Ski Resort, which had just hosted the Winter Olympics the year before, and the Santa Fe Plaza, as well as other intriguing spots around the country.

The scenery looks great even in black-and-white, and is even more stark in an era in which the country was much less sparsely populated.  One suspects that ""Route 66"" was such a hit in part because it was a much less affluent era in which most people had probably not traveled much, and the show shed light on customs in other parts of the country and provided something of a geography lesson to the many of a half-century ago who had not ventured far from home.

Viewers today know that society has undergone revolutionary changes since the early Sixties, but one wonders while watching these episodes whether fisticuffs and other violence were really as common as portrayed then, or if it was frequently included in the script for the sake of a television drama.  Tod and Buz say a thing or two that in 2013 would definitely not be considered politically correct.  Ironically, some of the characters in the series remark about how much the society of 1961 had changed from earlier times.

In addition to being a very good drama, ""Route 66"" gives the viewer an opportunity to see what cities like Los Angeles and Cleveland as well as smaller places like Fallon, Nevada and Youngstown, Ohio looked like a half-century ago.  Old road signs, business signs, hotels and motels, restaurants and bars, and even computers of the time provide snapshots of an America long gone.

Recognizable actors like Robert Duvall, Ed Asner, Walter Matthau, and Allan Melvin guest star, and the bonus feature on this DVD set contains about 20 minutes of period commercials that aired when the show was originally broadcast.  Those who love adventure, drama, and great scenery would definitely be glad that they added ""Route 66"" to their itinerary.",1372723200,,3129,5.083984375
3049702,4,B0010SB064,"I'm a bit puzzled by the many reviews that mentioned ""cropping"" problems.

I had always heard about it but it was only when the DVD was released I was able to see it.  The show is terrific.  It is very different from other shows.  It is probably closer to Naked City than other shows of the 60s.  Two young men from the Northeast decide to travel the country in their convertible.  Route 66 begins in the Southeast and travels to California.  The series begins with travel in Mississippi and the episodes I watched traveled to Arizona.

Possibly the 16X9 format seems ""movie"", big and important, rather than TV 4X5 format which screams TV and disposable.

I believe this is one of the few television programs ever filmed on actual locations - from Reno to Cleveland and beyond. Highly unusual for 1960 and highly unusual for 2008. The locations add a reality and a credibility to the series that filming solely in California or on a studio backlot lack. Yes, it's in black and white but who cares? Though the acting is a little dated, the writing is far better than most television these days. Tod and Buz find a variety of adventures through jobs, girls, bad people, and occasional fist fights. To my amazement, there's even an episode where they are really ticked off at each other, resulting in a fist fight. I would recommend both volumes.",1204761600,4,840,4.569536423841059

I was a guaranteed sale of this and future volumes, but you lost me with this bizarre move.

Sometimes I watch classic TV like Star Trek this way and it's fun. But that's my choice. I do not want that imposed on me, as Infinity, you are doing.",1203379200,38,776,4.272108843537415
3049724,5,B0010SB064,"Route 66 Vol 2 has better video but does have some cropping problems. But honestly, after watching the episodes on Vol 2, the video is very very good. And throughout most of each episode, you don't even notice the cropping problem. If your a true Route 66 lover and want to own this entire series, then don't just listen to others who are suggesting that you return Vol 2 to the manufacturer or to not buy it at all. That's a real disservice to many many viewers and you're only getting one side when someone tells you that.

Instead, better advice is to keep the set then go ahead and write and complain about the cropping, and hopefully the manufacturer won't do that again.

And for those who are super technical about every DVD they might own, that's fine, but here's another reason why returning or not buying Vol 2 is one sided advice: The manufacturer of Vol 2 is NOT going to re-release this set. And even if they do re-release Set 2, or someone else does, it will be years and years before that happens - judging by the past of the DVD industry.

So for now, I know I'm keeping my Vol 2 set. Later if these episodes are re-released in full video ratio, I'll replace this set. But there is no way I'm letting this set go. Come on reviewers, remember, it's the only game in town regarding Route 66. I say, true Route 66 lovers will want to purchase and keep this set, until something better comes along. Again, that's what I'm doing.

Anyway, it is still so much fun to see these Route 66 episodes and in good clear video condition. One of the early episodes in this set (Disk 1: ""Sleep on Four Pillows""), has a lot of footage filmed on the UCLA Campus - in 1961 no less. The beautiful old buildings look the same. Except in this episode, Buzz and Todd drive right up to some of the old UCLA buildings that are today off limits to cars (2008). In this episode Todd is taking a computer class and is standing next to a computer that's taller than him. And they call it a calculator. What a kick.

Also, on the same disk is a two part episode (""Fly Away Home"") that co-stars Dorothy Malone. I didn't even know she appeared in Route 66. This episode was filmed a couple of years before she starred in the wildly popular Payton Place TV Series in 1964. And here's a personal side note. When Mrs. Malone gave up on Hollywood back in the 1960's, she sold her beautiful home in Beverly Hills (that's still there), rented a trailer and drove all the way back to her home in Dallas, Texas - she actually had to drive on parts of Route 66 to get back home. I wonder if she got her kicks on Route 66 along that long long drive home. I certainly hope she did. She was a fun actress to watch.

In another episode, Dan Duryea is also a main star. Mr. Duryea was not only one of the great charater actors in movie history, but probably the best character actor in the Film Noir era 1940-1955.

Yeah, I'm keeping my DVD set and enjoying and loving it - enjoying it a heck of a lot better than the set of old VHS tapes of the entire Route 66 Series that I purchased years ago from someone who made the tapes from a copy of a copy of a copy. I couldn't even watch the tapes with their oh so grainy video. So....for now, I'm watching these new Route 66 DVD's.",1203292800,13,3247,4.22741935483871

3284183,1,B0010SB064,"For all folks who care about the importance of maintaining the original aspect ratios of films and television programs I urge you to avoid this set.  IMO, the cropping of the original 4:3 aspect ratio destroys this visual aesthetics in spite of using better source prints for picture transfers over the first boxed set.

Others may differ, but ignoring or overlooking the problem doesn't mean that there isn't one.  The visual damage from cropping the 4:3 image to fit a 16:9 screen without window-boxing combined with the packaging deception is at the very least tragic, and arguably criminal, since consumers are purchasing butchered product that distorts the artist's original intent; the franchise holder should be ashamed.  Note: The excuses I've read in respect to this botched effort don't inspire confidence that Infinity Entertainment Group will take responsibility and ameliorate the situation.

These should be returned to the vendor for a refund in the hope that the rights holder(s) will get the message and either correct the existing sets by a recall and replacement offer or at least release future seasons in the proper aspect ratio.  Another reason to consider returning the second set as defective is the fact that consumer outrage over the practice of ""tilt & scan"" may be the only means of insuring that other series avoid a similar fate.

The one star rating is given because it's important to clearly delineate an advocacy position on these issues.  Those who care about the BIG picture should say My Way or the Highway to Route 66.",1203033600,26,1555,5.023346303501945

3284190,3,B0010SB064,"Hands down, ""Route 66"" was one of the greatest dramas produced in television's golden age.  The acting, writing, and production values for this ""show-on-the-go"" were trend setting for its time and still resonate strongly with this viewer . . . . . surely a five star series if ever there was one.  And that's why it pains me to give this second release from Roxbury Entertainment and the Infinity Entertainment Group only three stars.

The good news is that the visual quality for the episodes contained in this second volume represents an improvement over those in volume 1, at least based upon my viewing of the first two episodes (a good two-parter titled ""Fly Away Home"" with the great Michael Rennie) and spot checking other episodes. The visuals aren't in the same eye-popping category as some other shows from the era that have been released on DVD like the ""The Untouchables"" or ""The Fugitive,"" but they still look pretty good to my eyes and represent an improvement over the vast majority of the episodes contained in volume 1.  The extra features contained in volume 2 follow the same format as the first volume, cast credits and episode clips (to help you identify the actors) and early 1960s era commercials on disc 4.

Now for the bad news, Roxbury and/or Infinity have matted the top and bottom of the episodes to give it a FAKE WIDESCREEN look. So in certain scenes, the tops of the actors' heads are missing. This might not be so readily apparent to viewers who have never seen the show, but after releasing the first 15 episodes in volume 1 in the correct, full-screen aspect ratio, it becomes glaringly apparent.  Even the bonus commercials on disc 4 are matted!  I don't have the slightest idea as to why Roxbury/Infinity decided to go with this format, but if anyone from either of these companies happen to read these reviews, please do not matte any further volumes . . . . . serious viewers of ""Route 66"" want to be able to watch this series in its original, full-screen aspect ratio as originally broadcast.  Had this second volume been released in its correct aspect ratio, without the matted effect, I would most certainly have given this release a full five stars.",1202256000,69,2191,4.717277486910994
3284191,5,B0010SB064,"First, the bad news. The initial ""official"" release by Roxbury of the first fifteen episodes of the brilliant 1960's drama Route 66 was pretty much an unmitigated disaster, unacceptable by any standards of a professional DVD TV series official rerelase. Picture quality of many episodes was inferior to that on tapes of Nickelodeon reruns, showing that absolutely no effort had been made to remaster the films. Worst of all, the episode ""A Fury Slinging Flame"" was an edited for syndication version, missing four and a half minutes of footage. It is patently obvious that the set was put out by an organization that didn't care about quality and was out to make a quick buck. All told, the first Roxbury set was no better than a bootleg. So any fan of the series must look forward to the second set with some trepedation.

On the bright side, the second fifteen episodes of season one of Route 66, in whatever form one is lucky enough to view them in, chronicles one of television's true unheralded classics in the period when it really begins to find its legs. The characters of Tod and Buz are really starting to take on depth, and scripts are becoming more and more character-driven as opposed to the straightforward action-adventure plots which marked the show's earliest efforts. Highlights include:
""Fly Away Home"", an epic two-parter in which Tod and Buz become involved in the life of a fatalistic Phoenix cropdusting pilot (played by Micheal Rennie) in an outstanding, moving and poignant story.
""Like a Motherless Child"", Tod and Buz split up after an argument and orphan Buz later becomes drawn into the life of a lonely elderly woman who previously gave up her own child.
""Most Vanquished Most Victorious"", in which Tod searches for his missing cousin in the slums of L.A. and must confront not only the squalor and cheapness of life there but also the darkness in his own heart.
""Incident on a Bridge"", the season finale, a most unusual love story set against the backdrop of blue-collar Cleveland, involving a physical freak and a mute, cowed servant girl.

This DVD set contains the last half of the show's first season, originally broadcast on CBS from February 1961 to June 1961.

In this superb adventure/drama, Tod Stiles (Martin Milner) and Buz Murdock (George Maharis) are friends and young drifters who roam the country in Tod's Corvette.  They find odd jobs to work along their way, and are carefree at times yet searching at other times.  They encounter runaways and murders as well as many other varied life situations in the places they visit and people they meet--in some, Tod, Buz, and the people they encounter get into circumstances in which they have to deal with their pasts.

The episodes were filmed on location and many took place nowhere near the actual Route 66--some in the Southwestern states of Arizona in New Mexico, but others in places like Ohio, Nevada, and Northern California.  The viewer sees Squaw Valley Ski Resort, which had just hosted the Winter Olympics the year before, and the Santa Fe Plaza, as well as other intriguing spots around the country.

The scenery looks great even in black-and-white, and is even more stark in an era in which the country was much less sparsely populated.  One suspects that ""Route 66"" was such a hit in part because it was a much less affluent era in which most people had probably not traveled much, and the show shed light on customs in other parts of the country and provided something of a geography lesson to the many of a half-century ago who had not ventured far from home.

Viewers today know that society has undergone revolutionary changes since the early Sixties, but one wonders while watching these episodes whether fisticuffs and other violence were really as common as portrayed then, or if it was frequently included in the script for the sake of a television drama.  Tod and Buz say a thing or two that in 2013 would definitely not be considered politically correct.  Ironically, some of the characters in the series remark about how much the society of 1961 had changed from earlier times.

In addition to being a very good drama, ""Route 66"" gives the viewer an opportunity to see what cities like Los Angeles and Cleveland as well as smaller places like Fallon, Nevada and Youngstown, Ohio looked like a half-century ago.  Old road signs, business signs, hotels and motels, restaurants and bars, and even computers of the time provide snapshots of an America long gone.

Recognizable actors like Robert Duvall, Ed Asner, Walter Matthau, and Allan Melvin guest star, and the bonus feature on this DVD set contains about 20 minutes of period commercials that aired when the show was originally broadcast.

They help people along the way, but trouble seems to find them. They don't always stay on Route 66, they like to go to a major city for a vacation too.
  Episodes are filmed in the actual town or city the story is about. That is something that television production companies rarely do these days as it is too costly now.

 Some episodes are in widescreen or full-screen because it was a 35mm film they used.
  All episodes are in crystal clear black & white as CBS had not converted to color yet.  Each episode is approx. 51 minutes long.

To get to Disc Two, the plastic disc holder will side over from right to left. Disc 4, the plastic disc holder will slide from left to right.

  Bonus Features: If their is an actor's face you recognize, but can't place the name, even if it's on the tip of your tongue, go to Cast Bios of that episode and you can find out the name of the actor and see a brief film clip and find out some of the other work the actor has done.
  Also separatly are 14 commercials total of automobiles, Bayer Aspirin and Milk of Magnesia.

  Maybe George Maharis could have been a good ""James Bond"" or been a character opposite Terry Thomas. I say that with a smile.

  The Route 66 theme was conducted by Nelson Riddle.

  The adventures continues in:

I never imagined at this time that a company reissuing an iconic tv series would even consider doing this, especially since Vol 1, is correctly formatted. The only indication of the reformat is in the fine print, and the reviews, which, unfortunately I didn't read. I would not have purchased this set if it had been clearly identified as reformatted. I think this information should be prominently displayed at the top of the page as part of the title, for example ""Route 66: Season 1, Vol. 2 (Reformatted).""",1222214400,2,584,4.792079207920792

3284209,1,B0010SB064,"Out of curiosity, I read the reviews of this set. Three years ago, I bought an import set of the entire series off of internet's favorite 'auction' site for a bit less than a hundred dollars. Now, I realize that I made a wise decision. Sad to think that people making these compilations have no clue as to what they are doing to classic media. Cutting the 4:3 into a letterbox to simulate widescreen for people with big screen tv's? And losing part of the picture? Are they crazy? Glad I have the 'old' set, monophonic soundtrack and all. Maybe it's got all the ticks and pops of old time TV, but that's what we're after, isn't it?",1219363200,7,631,4.3559322033898304

3284212,1,B0010SB064,"Okay, I know that there are a lot of clueless individuals putting out DVDs nowadays, but this Volume 2 release boggles the mind. The first volume was nicely done. Obviously, this series is going to be purchased by fans and collectors. Why would anyone, even if they for some demented reason desired a cropped 16:9 image, want the first volume one way and the second volume the other? This is absolutely nutso, but what steams me is that you have no warning until you put the first disk into your dvd player, see the widescreen video, and say, ""What the heck?!"" And so:

1. You are stuck with something you don't want because you can't return an opened DVD.

2. You can't stand the thing, so what do you do with it?

3. Your season one collection of Route 66 includes only the first half of the season, and you don't know if they'll ever release the second half in full screen, so you have a ridiculously incomplete collection.

4. Now I hear that these people are releasing the entire first season in one set. Will it be full screen or butchered? And if it is full screen, now they're telling me that I have to buy both halves twice!

3284213,1,B0010SB064,"I was looking forward to buying the new volume of season I, but after reading the majority of reviews on its release, I am not too sure.  The reviews basically said they were pleased with the better audio but are abhorred at the video.  Changing the format to a cheap lackluster version of letterbox for digital screens.  Ah, for your info.  Digital is coming next year and some people will get a converter or their cable will change them over to the new presentation.  This is as bad as T. Turner colorizing vintage films because his hatred of B/W films.  Let's have as it was, gents.  As the old saying goes, ""If it ain't busted, don't fix it.",1205280000,14,645,4.415254237288136
3284214,4,B0010SB064,"The Route 66 theme music always puts me into a semi trance. Sort of a blend of youth and freedom of the road, with some nostalgia for simpler times thrown in. This was a well made show, back when there were real stories to be told, and opportunities for a guest star to create a memorable character. The on the road location photography was always first class, especially considering the speedy production requirements of a weekly show. The accross the country settings are a time machine back to a more innocent America. The two leads are engaging. The Corvette looks like a future mobile compared to all the lumbering bloated sedans of that era. I have a giant TV (a gift), and the 16X9 format looks good on my screen, more the cinematic look which I like. Possibly the 16X9 format seems ""movie"", big and important, rather than TV 4X5 format which screams TV and disposable. And yes sometimes the framing of head closeups are framed too high or too low...but just a little and not really jarring...and really only occur just a few times during any particular show. Go ahead and enjoy this time machine, I have.",1205193600,2,1112,4.621212121212121
3284215,5,B0010SB064,"After buying the first volume of this set, I had to buy the second simply because I wanted to watch the further adventures of Tod, Buz and the Corvette. I believe this is one of the few television programs ever filmed on actual locations - from Reno to Cleveland and beyond. Highly unusual for 1960 and highly unusual for 2008. The locations add a reality and a credibility to the series that filming solely in California or on a studio backlot lack. Yes, it's in black and white but who cares? Though the acting is a little dated, the writing is far better than most television these days. Tod and Buz find a variety of adventures through jobs, girls, bad people, and occasional fist fights. To my amazement, there's even an episode where they are really ticked off at each other, resulting in a fist fight. I would recommend both volumes.",1204761600,4,840,4.569536423841059
3284216,4,B0010SB064,"Before I purchased this product from Amazon I hadn't seen any episode of
Route 66 since it was last shown on British television in the early 1960's. I have to say that I enjoyed watching the episodes of Route 66 again as it brought back so many wonderful memories for me. I am so thankful that a company like Amazon exists so that the classic tv series of the 50's and 60's can be enjoyed again by all us ""oldies"". Thank you Amazon.",1204675200,3,432,4.216867469879518

3284218,5,B0010SB064,"For a nostalgic look back at the USA circa 1960, you can't do any better than Route 66. Every episode is a look at a new location and the scenery, cars, buildings, dress, and people are like a living postcard from the era. Both Volume 1 & 2 are presented different than the 11 Classic episodes DVD released earlier in that there are no commercial interuptions. The commercials are combined into their own segment. I only hope the rest of the series is released soon, as those of us who loved the series can't get enough. Take a trip on Route 66!",1204243200,6,545,4.352941176470588
3284219,1,B0010SB064,"They've cropped the original picture for a fake widescreen effect, completely destroying the composition and cutting off heads, chins, feet, etc. This is a travesty. 4X3 material should be released in 4x3, these people don't know what they are doing.

There is nothing else to say; as the episodes are ruined. They didn't so this with the first volume, so hopefully they'll come to their senses and release future sets correctly.",1204070400,15,429,5.042253521126761
3284220,3,B0010SB064,"To Infinity Entertainment Group:
What were you thinking? I bought volume 1 and lived with the subpar  prints, now this 16x9 crap -- I mean crop? How does cropping to 16x9 help try to draw a bigger audience beyond the die-hards when the series is black and white to begin with? I was a guaranteed sale of this and future volumes, but you lost me with this bizarre move.

Leave it to viewers whether they want to watch the show in a 16x9 picture.
All decent HD sets have a zoom function to fill the screen for 4x3 pictures (avoiding stretch-fill), plus a way to adjust up and down to find the visual center (above true center.) Sometimes I watch classic TV like Star Trek this way and it's fun. But that's my choice. I do not want that imposed on me, as Infinity, you are doing.",1203379200,38,776,4.272108843537415
3284221,5,B0010SB064,"Route 66 Vol 2 has better video but does have some cropping problems. But honestly, after watching the episodes on Vol 2, the video is very very good. And throughout most of each episode, you don't even notice the cropping problem. If your a true Route 66 lover and want to own this entire series, then don't just listen to others who are suggesting that you return Vol 2 to the manufacturer or to not buy it at all. That's a real disservice to many many viewers and you're only getting one side when someone tells you that.

Instead, better advice is to keep the set then go ahead and write and complain about the cropping, and hopefully the manufacturer won't do that again.

And for those who are super technical about every DVD they might own, that's fine, but here's another reason why returning or not buying Vol 2 is one sided advice: The manufacturer of Vol 2 is NOT going to re-release this set. And even if they do re-release Set 2, or someone else does, it will be years and years before that happens - judging by the past of the DVD industry.

So for now, I know I'm keeping my Vol 2 set. Later if these episodes are re-released in full video ratio, I'll replace this set. But there is no way I'm letting this set go. Come on reviewers, remember, it's the only game in town regarding Route 66. I say, true Route 66 lovers will want to purchase and keep this set, until something better comes along. Again, that's what I'm doing.

Anyway, it is still so much fun to see these Route 66 episodes and in good clear video condition. One of the early episodes in this set (Disk 1: ""Sleep on Four Pillows""), has a lot of footage filmed on the UCLA Campus - in 1961 no less. The beautiful old buildings look the same. Except in this episode, Buzz and Todd drive right up to some of the old UCLA buildings that are today off limits to cars (2008). In this episode Todd is taking a computer class and is standing next to a computer that's taller than him. And they call it a calculator. What a kick.

Also, on the same disk is a two part episode (""Fly Away Home"") that co-stars Dorothy Malone. I didn't even know she appeared in Route 66. This episode was filmed a couple of years before she starred in the wildly popular Payton Place TV Series in 1964. And here's a personal side note. When Mrs. Malone gave up on Hollywood back in the 1960's, she sold her beautiful home in Beverly Hills (that's still there), rented a trailer and drove all the way back to her home in Dallas, Texas - she actually had to drive on parts of Route 66 to get back home. I wonder if she got her kicks on Route 66 along that long long drive home. I certainly hope she did. She was a fun actress to watch.

In another episode, Dan Duryea is also a main star. Mr. Duryea was not only one of the great charater actors in movie history, but probably the best character actor in the Film Noir era 1940-1955.

Yeah, I'm keeping my DVD set and enjoying and loving it - enjoying it a heck of a lot better than the set of old VHS tapes of the entire Route 66 Series that I purchased years ago from someone who made the tapes from a copy of a copy of a copy. I couldn't even watch the tapes with their oh so grainy video. So....for now, I'm watching these new Route 66 DVD's.",1203292800,13,3247,4.22741935483871
