2888352,5,B000SNUD1A,"My belief is that you should always learn Kung Fu or other Martial Arts from an excellent  teacher and then use the Books, DVDs and other resources as a tool to help remember principles and forms. Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming has refined his training material to the point that it is always easy to follow. He films his students wearing simple pants and tee shirts against a plain blue background and on a wooden floor. This makes it easy to see alignment, footwork and stepping patterns. Although I do love watching masters in open fields, high mountains and temple courtyards, when learning a new technique, it is easier to pick up when there are no background distractions.

Another feature that I find useful on these DVD's is the printed names, in both English and Chinese of all of the movements and hand positions. I live in a different state then Master Yang, and so, I study Xinyi, Bagua and Taiji under another Grandmaster. The printed words such as Pi meaning Chopping, add to my own understanding of other material. My experience has been that the really great teachers are not afraid to share information. To me it is also very useful when a teacher points out what is being done incorrectly, as well as the proper technique. There are parts where Dr. Yang tells the students to come up the center of the body more, not to the side so much, or to bring the stance lower. He also points out that the student should be aware of where he is open to attack and not always train to attack the opponent.

I enjoy Dr. Yang's way of describing things. At one point in the DVD he is talking about having to use power to train the proper technique. He says that it is no good just to tap or touch your opponent . You must wear protective gear and hit hard. He also says that you should train in sets of 10 minutes up to 30 minutes to gain that speed and power. Each 10 minute section brings you more power. My favorite part of this discussion was when he says that if you only tap an enemy, he will say, ""What is that supposed to do, that tap? I will kill you"" That's keeping it real.

As always, this is another great training DVD, use it to Practice, Practice and Practice some more.",1399075200,3,2180,4.388613861386139
2888353,5,B000SNUD1A,"Staff Fundamental Training is an excellent DVD for any martial artist who studies the Staff, regardless of style.  The techniques are explained clearly, with students performing the movements while Dr. Yang provides correction, allowing people to see their own mistakes being made by others and able to address them.  This dvd is a must have for any martial artist seriously interested in weapons and staff training.",1398470400,,416,5.287878787878788
2888354,5,B000SNUD1A,"When we approach any martial discipline from the stand-point of what is actually traditional, we must go back to when armies clashed with armed men on the battlefield, fighting each other in organized formations. Be it Western or Oriental warfare from Ancient to Medieval times, the primary weapons were spears and halberds, arrows and bows. The sword was transitioned to finish off the enemyusually already wounded from spear or arrow.

When we understand the contextual environment of such weapons used in this form of combat, we can better understand the two dimensional clash, with warriors using their spears, pikes and other haft-weaponry, three dimensionally. The powerful use of the weapon demanded getting ones full body behind every movement made with this staff-weapon.

Keeping this in mind, we see Dr. Yang explaining the basics of his staff work, as an art that has clearly evolved from this aforementioned martial (traditional) contexttwo dimensional clash with three-dimensional application of the weapon.

The video provides are detailed demonstration of the six primary groupings of motor skill movement that make up the traditional usage of the battlefield spear in its two-dimensional battlefield, three-dimensionally deployed.

The fundamental grouping of motor skills first shows the proper hand-hold manipulation of this extension weapon with sliding. From this hand-held manipulations, we observe the powerful stinging with the staff as though it was used as a spear, in its second grouping of sliding stinging. These are powerful actions, where the entire body is behind each application, along the three planes of orientation and movement: frontal, transverse and sagittal.

The third group is chopping, which is striking with the staff. If one were to imagine a halberd or glaive type weapon, we can understand the utility of power strikes using an extension weapon. Dr. Yang instructs that the staff is the fundamental weapon from which all other movements will arise, with slight variations.

The fourth grouping of motor skills with this staff is the coil stinging, which are very fast and deceptive whipping actions, which would be actions one would use to deflect anothers spear and proceed too riposte with a strike of our own. These actions are also very deceptive and can change directions quickly, feinting one way and striking on a different angle altogether. Throughout the video, which is indicative of Tai Chi/Shaolin movements, is the need for adhering and sticking to the enemy, while we repel and elude the enemys weapon, assisting our own movements with feints and body elusiveness.

The fifth group of skills includes: Advancing-retreating actions coupled with Circle-sealing. These are full body movements that show a powerful grace indicative of correct spear/pike work through this staff work. This is evasive body movement that allows one to avoid incoming attacks yet still adhere to the enemys movements to effectively counter strike and neutralize the enemys ability to counter.

The sixth and final grouping of fundamental motor skills is Four-corners Repel and Neutralizing, which involves utilizing the staff as a counter-offensive weapon against other staff-like weaponry, all along the three dimensional planes of movement. Defeat the attack by attacking the attack on an off-angle or feint or body evasiveness, sums up the basics, mastered.

The unique quality I appreciate with this video presentation is the true offensive and counteroffensive nature of this weapon, which remains true to its origins as the primary battlefield weapon: spear/glaive/pike/halberd, all of which were offensive/counteroffensive in their deployment.

The three students that we demonstrating these groups of actions showed varying levels of skills, to which Dr. Yang made the necessary corrections. I appreciate it when video producers allow different levels of skills being demonstrated. From these different skill levels, one gains a much more in-depth example of how the skills develop progressively.

Over all, I found this video presentation to offer a solid foundation of traditional staff work, which remains true to the actual offensive and counteroffensive nature of the principal battlefield weapon of yore. There are no theatrics or fancy twirling, whirling and flipping of the staff so common today in the highly competitive and entertaining sports karate tournaments. If one visualizes a spear point and a butt spike on the staff throughout the teachings, one gains a better understanding as to why we do this, this way. Dr. Yang remains true to the combative roots of this weapon from start to finish, with the solid basics that made this THE primary battlefield weapon (along with the bow and arrows) in Ancient and Medieval times.",1395878400,3,4785,5.418010752688172

2888356,2,B000SNUD1A,I have a lot of material from YMAA and this is the only piece that I need to give a bad review on.  The students that are demonstrating are not very good and it shows.  At one point the student has both hands off the stick and that is a definate no-no.  I just think for the cost of these dvd's that the people teaching them should be qualified.  I viewed the other staff dvd and that looks quite good; with senior students doing the demonstration.  [...],1232150400,10,455,4.183908045977011
2888357,2,B000SNUD1A,"This DVD has an excelent range of Bo Staff moves, all shown several time by different performers.

Unfortunately they are all shown at full speed. There is no instruction on HOW to do the move. Not a word or frame of ""place hands this way."" or ""while moving front hand, the back hand moves here."".  Not for an instant does the instructor take the time to slow it down so that the viewer can get a clue how to execute the moves.

If you enjoy watching guys swing a pole, you'll get plenty of that.  If you want to learn to use a Bo Staff, keep looking.",1229385600,23,551,4.121495327102804
2888358,4,B000SNUD1A,"This video has multiple views of each move, with detailed explanations, and a gradual walk-through from beginning to more complex moves. Quite useful and recommended.",1224028800,,166,5.68
2888359,5,B000SNUD1A,"The staff is a logical first choice for anyone interested in weapons training, as it teaches 70% of the skills needed for the majority of long weapons, as Master Yang explains at the beginning of this DVD.  This DVD is an excellent introduction to learning staff, as Master Yang does it right by teaching a very strong foundation to the student.  I have numerous tapes and DVDs that I purchased over the years that are nice to watch, as they show wonderful demonstrations of various staff and weapons forms.

However, the majority of these DVDs and tapes do not include any basic training, or if they do it is very minimal.  I dare say that although Master Yang is already known for providing good foundation training in all of his productions, this DVD is at the top of the list for teaching a very thorough and complete foundation prior to teaching any kind of form.
This DVD is made up of three sections, of which the first two sections were previously available on separate video tapes.  The first section of the DVD teaches 6 techniques, the second section 6 more techniques and the third section includes two man drills that cover numerous techniques as well as some free sparring at the end, with the participants wearing protective equipment.

Master Yang studied the staff while training in White Crane, Tiger, Long Fist and Taijiquan.  He talks about how each of these styles have various techniques and training methods to offer the student, yet each of them is also missing parts of the process.  Master Yang has taken the best of Shaolin and Taijiquan techniques and training methods and combined them with the soft style of White Crane staff.

SECTIONS ONE AND TWO (12 TECHNIQUES)

In the first two sections of this DVD, the techniques are demonstrated by three different students.  These demonstrations are done sequentially instead of simultaneously.  This offers the benefit of being able to focus on one demonstrator at a time.  Each of the students of Master Yang bring different skills to the demonstration, as well as different weaknesses. Master Yang can be heard giving corrections from off screen.

The techniques in the first two sections are demonstrated by each of the three students in a stationary  pose, while moving, with a normal grip and with a reverse grip.  At times the students make mistakes or seem to forget a move for a second or two.  However, as one student might be better from a technical point of view, another brings more intent to the moves.

The moves are learned fast, so that the student can feel the move and better be able to produce power.  Over time the moves can be done more slowly, while focusing on coordinating the breath and the movements.  This leads to more internal power.  The techniques taught are a nice blend of hard and soft, which is more effective than just using just hard techniques or just soft techniques.  The use and understanding of sticking, coiling, adhering and circling are taught with the techniques and can be found in Taijiquan push hands practice as well.

SECTION THREE (2 MAN DRILLS AND SPARRING)

In section three Master Yang is shown demonstrating all of the techniques.  He then either demonstrates their usage with another student in a two person drill, or he has two students demonstrate the two person drill for that particular technique, while wearing protective head, wrist and hand gear.  This section brings a better understanding of not only how the techniques actually work, but also demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques.

At the end of section three the students take turns in having two man free sparring with the staffs.  I was very happy to find this section, as in sections one and two Master Yang does not make much of an appearance, as he has his students do the majority of the demonstrations.  In section three Master Yang spends a great deal of time demonstrating techniques and is much more hands on with the process.

This DVD is valuable to all practitioners that are interested in learning weapons or enhancing their understanding of how to apply power, even without weapons usage.  The techniques used in staff fighting displayed on this DVD display many of the concepts and techniques that are so integral to Taijiquan.",1186185600,30,4840,4.951672862453532
8206084,5,B000SNUD1A,"This is one of the best videos for staff training. Its hard to find a school anywhere where I live at.. so, the best to get it is at the YMAA.

8206085,3,B000SNUD1A,"Although this is a very good video, on basic staff training. I felt there are a few things, that are sadly lacking! For one, unlike ""Dr. Yang's"", other weapons videos. There was no historical preface, no full elaboration on the formation and coming to be; of the ""Chinese Kung Fu Fighting Staff"". 'Dr. Yang', doesn't just jump into the training; per s&eacute;. But in my personal opinion, there is more to training; than just techniques and learning how to fight! There is education, as well! But regardless, anyone who wants to properly train with this weapon; get this video!!! Thank you",1515110400,,589,4.841584158415841

8206089,2,B000SNUD1A,Disappointing.  This is a poor instruction tape.  The techniques are done full speed with no instruction.  Dr. Yang you need to present each technique slowly with explanations.  This is supposed to be an instructional tape not solely a demo.,1431648000,2,241,5.102564102564102
8206090,5,B000SNUD1A,"This is a fine DVD for anyone into long staff training.

In empty hand training, we work on our stances, we drill our blocks, we drill our strikes, we drill our kicks. We create a solid foundation and develop the techniques which launch from that pedestal, this is key to success.

For long staff training, or really any weapon training, you will find that this DVD is an excellent collection of exercises to build strength, coordination, and good rooting. Static and moving drills are explained and then demonstrated, both by Dr. Yang and, for variety and as teaching examples, several of his students.

The intention seems to be to develop substance and content in the use of the staff, as opposed to learning pretty solo forms. (No forms/katas are taught in this DVD, but there are other DVDs available from YMAA which do teach staff forms. If you already practice a staff form, these exercises may add more substance to your practice.)

My background in Chinese internal martial arts includes Hsing Yi Chuan, and one thing I remember about the style was how simple and even boring it might appear (Hence the old Hsing Yi proverb: ""It is not pretty, but it works!""). I will compare staff  training from this DVD to what I did the most in Hsing Yi - drilling a few simple yet versatile techniques and strikes, drilling my footwork, drilling both together, and then, much later, eventually applying it in the solo and partner forms. (My teacher did not even show me ""Linking"" until I had been training in basics for about 18 months)

My point is that I was already gaining some competence in my art from doing nothing but basic training, and, by the same logic, these exercises would make anyones staff technique strong and coordinated, with or without practicing a form. The student will be comfortable swinging the staff, and strong and precise in striking and blocking with it. These are things you can apply to whatever style of long staff you may wish to practice, and will only enhance your abilities with any other weapons you may care to study.

8206091,3,B000SNUD1A,"Dr. Yang knows his stuff, for sure. I have a couple of his books and have seen other disks (i.e. his chin na disk) and they are excellent. But while this does clearly show beginning techniques, Dr. Yang demonstrates one, then lets several of his students practice them for prolonged periods. I don't want to watch students fumble through the moves, I want to watch the master do them properly! With disks, we can play the moves slowly and repeat as necessary. As my first teacher said when a student asked him about warmups before class, ""You can do push ups before class on your own. You guys aren't paying me to lead you through jumping jacks; you're paying me to show you kung fu.""",1422748800,2,684,4.48
8206092,3,B000SNUD1A,"I have always liked Dr Yang's history and explanations of why and how and what he is teaching, and it shows that he's got decades with different styles of Chinese martial arts.  That was the part I liked the most.

As it came to the different techniques, the tape was filmed as a series of demonstrations without Dr. Yang making any corrections to the demonstators' forms, movements, etc.  With my limited knowledge of Chinese martial arts, it's difficult for me to judge their proficiency, but it didn't look like the demonstrators were all the same level of proficiency.  Also, there was no discussion that went something like the following:  ""Kevin doesn't have as much flexibility as John, so his technique looks a bit different.""

Good but not great.",1408838400,,755,4.859375
8206093,4,B000SNUD1A,"If you are looking for training with the long staff (Bo) look no further than this video.

The long staff is found pretty much through out the martial arts spectrum. The use is pretty much the same in every style, with some signature moves inserted, here and there.  So, don't focus on the style what you really need is good instruction. And as always, Dr. Yang delivers!

Dr. Yangs commitment to providing the very best in video instruction is ever evident in each and every video he produces.  From production quality, to effectively communicating the demonstrated skill, he and his students always come through in conveying their intent to you, the video student.  STAFF Fundamental Training is no exception.

This video combines both beginner and intermediate levels of skills training.  Making it both thorough and quite the bargain (more bang for your hard earned dollars).  It takes you stem to stern through every step of the process effectively begin your training, as well as, establishing your proficiency with the staff.

As always Dr. Yang demonstrates a move.  Explains it very well and allows his students to demonstrate it also.  He corrects their mistakes, so that you may more easily notice and correct yours, as well.",1399334400,,1236,4.980487804878049
