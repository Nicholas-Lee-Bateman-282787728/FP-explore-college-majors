8031013,5,B0002S64M8,"Our kids, ages 5, 8, 9, and 11, as well as my wife & myself, have all enjoyed this series immensely. Each episode portrays touching life-lessons having to do with handicaps, honesty, prejudice, bullies, and much more. The actors are very engaging and the scripts are well written. Great family entertainment!

""The Adventures of Skippy"", Vol. 1, 2, and 3 are a great buy! Each disk has 13 episodes for a total 39 in all. Highly recommended!",1178755200,,440,4.714285714285714

8031015,5,B0002S64M8,"Skippy the Bush Kangaroo was a wonderful children's show from the 1970s. It was shown in most parts of the British Commonwealth. Sonny, his dad, and their pet kangaroo, Skippy, had many adventures.

Now, Sonny is grown, with twins of his own, Jerry and Lou. Sonny is a former Park Ranger who now helps run Habitat, a wildlife park.

The twins and Skippy continue the tradition, and children will love to join in their fun.",1125187200,4,422,4.613333333333333
