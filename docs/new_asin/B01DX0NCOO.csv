7725508,5,B01DX0NCOO,"Volume 36 of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" is a mixed bag of two movies made from failed TV series, and two theatrical films.  First up is Joel hosting a failed TV pilot re-titled ""Stranded In Space.""  Glenn Corbett stars as astronaut Neil Stryker, who lands on a planet named Terra, which is eerily similar to Earth.  The big brother form of government is called the Perfect Order.  Unfortunately, an astronaut from the planet Earth just doesn't fit in their society.  Cameron Mitchell turns in his finest performance since ""Space Mutiny,"" which was also featured on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000.""  After watching this movie, you may have to be taken to Ward E.  The bonus feature was a fascinating look at Film Ventures International and its founder Edward L. Montoro, who embezzled over one million dollars from the company when it was about to go bankrupt.  He vanished, and his whereabouts are unknown to this day.  Next up is a 1984 theatrical movie entitled ""City Limits,"" hosted by Joel.  It's a brainless biker movie set in a post-apocalyptic world.  You know it's a good film when Robby Benson plays an evil corporate mastermind, and James Earl Jones helps the rebel bikers.  A highlight of the host segments is when Mike Nelson plays the perpetually depressed singer/songwriter Morrissey.  Speaking of songs, Crow T. Robot sings a heartfelt ode to Kim Cattrall.  The bonus feature is an interview with Rae Dawn Chong, who played a character named Yogi in the movie.  Apparently, Robby Benson and James Earl Jones were unavailable for comment.

The third feature is the 1977 theatrical film ""The Incredible Melting Man,"" hosted by Mike.  Alex Rebar stars as Steve West, the only surviving astronaut from an ill-fated flight to Saturn.  This goofy, goopy, gelatinous mess of a movie will melt your heart.  Particularly amusing was an elderly, amorous married couple who encountered the melting man while trying to steal some lemons from a lemon grove.  The host segments involve the ongoing saga of Crow T. Robot's ""Earth vs. Soup"" screenplay being made into a movie, which was financed by Dr. Clayton Forrester and his mother Pearl.  In one segment, Dr. Forrester and Pearl actually appear on the Satellite of Love with Mike and the 'bots.  Bonus features include interviews with makeup artists Rick Baker and Greg Cannom, as well as writer/director William Sachs.  The fourth and final feature is ""Riding With Death.""  It's actually two episodes of the short-lived TV series ""Gemini Man,"" combined with scenes from the pilot episode.  Ben Murphy stars as secret agent Sam Casey.  He was involved in an explosion which exposed him to radiation that turned him invisible.  After an operation, he is able to turn himself invisible and then visible again by pushing the buttons on a digital wristwatch he wears.  His invisibility is used sparingly, and sometimes played for laughs.  You know you're in big trouble when singer/songwriter Jim Stafford plays Sam's best friend and accomplice Buffalo Bill Joe Hickens.  The bonus feature is an interview with ""Gemini Man"" creator and head writer Steven de Souza.  For ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" fanatics, ""Riding With Death"" is noteworthy for being Jim Mallon's final episode before leaving the series.",1470355200,8,3261,5.050561797752809
7725509,5,B01DX0NCOO,"Oh my goodness - where DO they drag these things from?  Another great set of completely unwatchable train wrecks save for the riffing of the SOL crew.  I cannot wait for set XXXVII (that is 37 for those of you who are roman numerally challenged).  : )

Lets get to it:

Stranded in Space: If only!  Somehow it made it to the SOL.  Which leaves us SOL.  But somewhere, someone, at one time, thought this was a good idea for a television series.  They were wrong.  It smacks and smells of the 70s.  When people pine for that period - show them this!

The bonus feature (as they all are) is informative and gives a lot of good back-story on these tragedies.

City Limits:  They had me at Robbie Benson!  But throw in Kim Cattrall, Rae Dawn Chong and for some inexplicable reason, James Earl Jones - and ring that bell - ding, ding, ding - we have a winner.  Motorcycles!  Post apocalyptic gangs!  If not for the SOL crew, again, this horrid mess would test even the strongest person's gag reflex.

The bonus feature with Rae dawn Chong was pretty cool.  She hasn't aged well.  And add to that, she openly stated she was staring at Mr. Jone's junk.  Try scrubbing THAT visual out of your brain!

The Incredible Melting Man:  Too bad they could not have melted the film stock that this was recorded on.  This will either convince you that we need to explore space more - in order to overcome the shock of this movie, and to provide more stock footage for even more films like this - OR that we just need to take care of the earth first, so that we can save ourselves from movies like this.

The bonus features were good - the make-up artists explained it all - and thank goodness - they were the only coherent things about this production.

And last, and least - Riding With Death:  Yet ANOTHER failed tv series cut into a ""movie.""  Poor Ben Murphy - I did like ""Alias Smith And Jones.""  At least that one made it to television.  But is it me, or is everything where he ""stars"" turn into a pile of stuff?  And throw in Jim Stafford - you have a perfect blend of 1970s horror entertainment.  Bad script?  Check.  Bad, stilted acting?  Check.  Bad dialogue (take that, turkey)?  Check.  Continuity problems?  Check.  Another reason to avoid about everything that came out of the 70s (where is the Carter Country movie?)?  Check!

The bonus feature was a good interview with the writer, Steven de Souza.

And as always, the SOL crew sections are just darn funny.",1470355200,5,2454,4.4058295964125564
7725510,5,B01DX0NCOO,"Just had this delivered today. All four episodes in this set are personal favorites. Really excited that The Incredible Melting Man is included here, though. That one makes me laugh so hard everytime I watch it.",1469491200,3,211,4.888888888888889
7725511,5,B01DX0NCOO,"This set features two episodes with show creator Joel Hodgson as host and two with head writer Mike Nelson as host. Three are from the Comedy Central era of the show and one is from the Sci-Fi Channel era.

305 - Stranded in Space
This 1973 TV movie starring Glen Corbett was originally called The Stranger. Corbett is an astronaut who lands on a (more) dystopian Earth, recovered from his latest space flight in an exact copy of America run by the Orwellian Perfect Order which seeks to crush all independent thought. They even have the same cars as regular America, but the planet has three moons. It's not brilliantly original stuff, but the great Lew Ayres (All Quiet On The Western Front) is in it as well as veteran actor and MSTie favorite Cameron Mitchell (Space Mutiny). The movie was a pilot for a proposed TV series where the astronaut would be looking to escape every week I suppose. Sally Fields' mom, Margaret Fields is also in it as well as Dean Jagger. One might suppose that the film is loosely based on Gerry Anderson's(!) Journey To The Far Side Of The Sun which is also about an astronaut landing on an exact copy of Earth. In any case, it's not terribly exciting, but the cast is decent. Joel and the 'bots give it the treatment it deserves. Highlights include Joel using Crow and Tom for a shooting gallery sketch!

403 - City Limits
A 1984 color film ""starring Jame Earl Jones at a low point in his career and Kim Cattrall at a high point in hers"", the main character in the film is played by then unknown actor Dean Devlin who would go on to produce blockbusters like Stargate, Independence Day and the first American Godzilla movie. Rae Dawn Chong also appears. In a future world where plague has wiped out most adults children have mostly raised themselves and joined violent motorcycle gangs where now rare and out of print comic books form the basis of their culture. It's like a dystopian Comic Con. Robbie Benson plays a villain and you'll never look at office furniture the same way again after seeing the final showdown between Devlin and Benson. This is at least a relatively fast paced film with some action scenes, especially compared to Stranded In Space and there's plenty of fun stuff to riff on like the silly masks and comic book culture. Highlights include sketches involving Crow singing ""Kim Cattrall"" and a conversation about superheroes. There's also a City Limits trivia game sketch. Really fun stuff.

704 - The Incredible Melting Man
A 1977 color film featuring the make-up effects of future award winner Rick Baker. An astronaut returns to Earth after orbiting Saturn, which for some reason causes him to melt and to want to eat people. It's that simple and that gross. Rick Baker's make-up effects are brilliantly disgusting, especially considering the film's extremely low budget. That is about the only positive thing, if it is a positive, one can say about this film. Unfortunately, Frank Conniff departed the show at the end of season six so the Deep 13 sketches feature Dr. Forrester (Trace Beaulieu) being harangued by his mother, Pearl Forrester (Mary Jo Pehl). I don't think it works as well as Frank and Forrester from previous seasons or as well as Pearl with Bobo and Brain Guy in future Sci-Fi Channel seasons. The cast was working with the knowledge they only had an order for six episodes that season and the fact that the show was canceled after six years of being the unofficial flagship show for Comedy Central. In spite of this, they still turn out a decent bit of fun here in this abbreviated seventh season. Sketches feature Crow's Earth Vs. Soup screenplay being made into a movie.

814 - Riding with Death
This 1976 TV movie is really two episodes of the TV series Gemini Man stitched together. It ""stars"" Ben Murphy and then music star Jim Stafford. The Gemini Man can turn invisible, or rather stop being invisible (his default condition after some radiation makes him invisible), by using a special wrist watch. This is sadly the state of science fiction on TV prior to the release of Star Wars the following year. There's very little of it and what is there is not terribly exciting. Highlights include Tom Servo singing about the 50s and 70s. Servo singing is always a highlight. Servo also acquires a buttless truck driver body. The ""movie"" itself is light, ridiculous fare and the riffing is quite good. An enjoyable episode all around.

7725518,5,B01DX0NCOO,"Obviously most of the more famous (or infamous) episodes of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" were released nearer to the beginning of the box sets, but just because not every movie is ""Manos"" doesn't mean there isn't plenty of comedic gold yet to mine. This installment has two each episodes from Joel and Mike, which I like, and the choice of material is excellent as well.

""Stranded in Space"" is basically a pilot for an abandoned television show in which an astronaut lands in a perfect copy of the US, but it is run by an evil Orwellian governmental apparatus that will do anything to control their citizens. A special treat is MST3K stalwart Cameron Mitchell (Space Mutiny) as a much younger man in a much less avuncular role. This one featured good riffing even if the underlying premise of escape from dystopia dragged a bit.

""City Limits"" is an episode I had forgotten about. Starring James Earl Jones in his long underwear (!) and Kim Cattrall, this is a fun, fast-paced episode about a world in which most of the adults are dead but rival groups of teens vie for power, often via ludicrously modified motorcycles. This is just a gem of an episode and was my second favorite of the set.

""The Incredible Melting Man"" is my least favorite episode of the set: it's very dark and a tad graphic by MST3K standards. An extremely bad actor playing an astronaut returns to Earth from Saturn and his journey results (for some reason) in him becoming a cannibal while his body decomposes. The interesting thing here is watching Rick Baker's makeup work; I also like the final scene involving the astronaut and the trash can. You don't see things like this every day. I also enjoyed the ""Earth vs. Soup"" sketch very much.

My favorite film of the set is easily ""Riding With Death"", a film made by splicing three episodes of a failed television show together into an alleged movie. I found the results hilarious. I particularly liked the truck driving drama with the highly explosive chemical onboard, but most of all I liked the casting of over-the-top singer-actor Jim Stafford, which results in no end of comic relief. As far as sketches, this is the episode Crow assumes the mantle of a new superhero: Turkey Volume Guessing Man, which always makes me laugh.

As with other Shout releases, this set has lots of great extras and is well worth the money. Highly recommended, for the ""Spiders and Snakes"" jokes if for no other reason!",1473465600,5,2433,4.7018779342723

8757074,4,B01DX0NCOO,"I love these selections of movies that MST3K chose to lampoon for volume 36...all these films were released no earlier than the early 1970's...I would rate them by watchability as follows:
1) The Incredible Melting Man, 2) City Limits,
3) Riding With Death, 4) Stranded on Space...
The Incredible Melting Man had great special effects makeup by academy award-winning makeup artist Greg Gannom (Mrs. Doubtfire) but a very derivative plot: man returns from outer space and transforms into a monster to terrorize his fellow earthlings. Great stunt works esp. by the nurse in the earlier scenes...
City Limits almost disappointed me. Almost an abysmal tale of a post-apocalyptic future had it not been for the presence of acting greats like James Earl Jones, Rae Dawn Ching, and Kim Miranda Catrell...I also sensed the bacony stench of Canada in this film...
Riding With Death is great for a film cobbled from two episodes of an action drama television show...it's as if two episodes of Happy Days were cobbled together to make one made-for-TV mega movie where Fonzie jumps over the shark way too soon...
Stranded In Space seems like one of those unwatchable movies they show on a so-called ""million dollar movie"" showcase on network TV...the only feature that interested me in this disc was the history of FVI and its legendary missing founder Eddie Montoro...I learned that this guy produced and distributed some of the greatest horror features like Grizzly, Beyond The Door, and my favorite gorefest PIECES...
These films at most entertained me had it not been for Mike/Joel and the bots...at least the added features were informative...",1505433600,2,1636,5.08550185873606
