8744997,5,B019EMB5DA,Watched on Crunchyroll and wanted a copy for home use.  If your a fan of Anime or enjoy watching Sports anime I would recommend giving this a try.  This includes the First season up to Grande Road and leaves you at a cliff hanger.  Looking forward to the release of season 2.,1457222400,6,275,4.25
8744998,5,B019EMB5DA,"They have done the series justice with this dvd release! I recommend this for anyone who has a love of sports anime, or eve if you just like anime. The story is fantastic, the characters (all of them) are fleshed out and grow substantially over the course of the series. This release includes all episodes for the first season, the second season being Grande Road, and hopefully that will also be released soon.
My only complaint is that they did not include any of the comedic shorts that are shown at the end of the episode: I believe they are called simulcasts. I jumped ahead to the final disc (I only just finished disc 2) but there are no extra features at all. A bit disappointing, but I am just happy that this series was released!",1455062400,9,739,4.4411764705882355
