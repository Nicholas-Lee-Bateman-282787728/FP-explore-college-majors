7814559,4,6301701879,"Its a great video to show 2nd and 3rd graders. I teach bicycle safety and the kids love it. We have used this video for years because it re-enforces what we teach in the classroom about bike safety. Its a classic, but still a goodie.",1127865600,2,233,4.2
7814560,5,6301701879,"The fact that I still know every song in this video after having seen it when I was six should tell you how *well* this thing teaches bicycle safety.
A must for anyone with children, anyone who baby-sits, or anyone who just needs to see eight-year-olds rapping on their bicycles.",1094774400,2,279,4.6
