William Hurt is fascinatingly creepy, Glenn Close is EXCELLENT (as usual) as Patty Hewes, and Rose Byrne is ever-evolving as Ellen Parsons.  (I'm really beginning to like her character.)  It's good, also, to see Marcia Gay Hardin in a gritty, ""do I like her or hate her?"" role and Timothy Olyphant in a ""do I trust him or not?"" role that's similar but softer than his ""Justified"" character.

I also really enjoy how, although they've moved onto a new ""case"", there is a carryover sub-plot going on from Season 1.  In a world where most shows are bland and predictable, this one stands out BIG TIME.

I've purchased all four years on DVD and am flying through them even though I wanted to draw out my viewing experience.  I'm sure I will watch them again and again.",1344902400,,869,4.597402597402597
