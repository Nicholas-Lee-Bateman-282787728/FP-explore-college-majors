8424912,5,B0014CACFQ,There is not much to be said. It is a look into Hitler's possible association with occult believes and how they could have shaped his accession to power and the shaping of the Reich's policies. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone interested in History.,1281830400,8,269,4.625
8424913,2,B0014CACFQ,"This is a difficult video to review because its premise is flawed from the get go: there is no occult associated with Hitler and there never was. The people chosen to be interviewed in this unintentionally amusing documentary are charletans of the first order. None are respected, noted or competent historians, they are pop writers who believe in errant nonsense. What types of nonsense, you ask? I shall tell you: they believe that when Hitler was a young man living in Vienna, he stumbled upon a spear located in a local museum. The spear infused the young artist with mythical and evil ""powers."" Yeah, right... and I was abucted yesterday by Martians and taken to outer space.
Only the most gullible cretins could believe anything in this childish video. Errors of the most fundamental nature abound: Hitler did not emigrate to Munich in 1912, but in 1913; Dietrich Eckart did not die in 1945, Hitler did not meet Eva Braun in 1933... the list is endless. As a laugh this might be useful, as history it is unreliable and puerile in the extreme.",1057968000,3,1048,4.73224043715847
