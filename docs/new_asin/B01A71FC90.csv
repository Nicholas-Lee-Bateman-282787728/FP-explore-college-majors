7588913,3,B01A71FC90,"2 1/2 strickly for cenematic detail and photography . Otherwise don't waist your time if your looking for originality . This Movie is a "" Full Remake "" of the film ( Man in the Wilderness ( 1971 ) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067388/ .
What no one has mentioned is that its a true story of  ( Some True Adventures in the Life of Hugh Glass, a Hunter and Trapper on the Missouri River  ) (1857) Kindle Edition http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0190QJE1A?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=nav_timeline_asin .
When i realized i had seen this all before ....verbatime ( as in almost a total remake of the old film ) and adding to the truth of the book by changing a few detail things ....i walked out , the story was a sham after you read the book .",1452384000,6,736,4.7421875
7588914,5,B01A71FC90,"This film transports you to the 1820's American wilderness where the mountain men carved out a living trapping for furs.  This movie has captured that time and place like no other I've ever seen including the 70's classic ""Jeremiah Johnson"".  You feel the fear as the arrows
from Indians pierce men's heads and bodies and a bear attack leaves Hugh Glass for dead. Blizzards, avalanches, and storms are common place, and men have little time for anything but survival in this cold, brutal hell they have found themselves.  The beauty of the untouched wilderness is breathtaking to behold and this film captures it like no other.  The language is rough as are the men here but so is the life
they are experiencing.  Eating raw, and often rotten meat was commonplace for these men back then.  It was just a game to stay alive...",1452384000,177,825,4.694444444444445
7588915,5,B01A71FC90,"This film is by itself a well rounded masterpiece, inch by inch. Based on a single story, but supported by an undeniable artistic ambition, dazzling visuals, frantic script, superb locations, first rate performances, doesn't leave aside any detail. It's built keeping in mind the legendary masters of the Western genre (Ford and Hawks). It's an epic journey, where the nature is a restless actor, always challenging this untamed will; who step by step reaches the redemption through this amazing experience.

But there's still more: I guess Leonardo Di Caprio really deserves the coveted Academy Award and Golden Globe as Best Actor, because I think this has been -until this date- the role of his lifetime. Tom Hardy should have been nominated as Best Supporting Actor in the Golden Globe Awards. But I guess the Academy Award won't ignore him.

And finally kudos for Alejandro Gonzalez Iarritu's unlimited talent. My bet is for Best Movie, Best Cinematography, and probably Best Director.

Don't even blink and go for it!",1452384000,13,1023,5.11377245508982
7588916,5,B01A71FC90,"What an incredible movie experience. Not only is this movie truly remarkable in its scope, but you have to hand it to the director and actors to be able to withstand the harsh conditions of the locations, weather, freezing water, etc...
Not only is this movie beautifully filmed, but the sheer savagery of the times is showcased to their most believable.
This movie will make you feel freezing cold in July, it is so masterfully shot.
Personally, this movie was much fuller, richer, and all around BETTER than the new Star Wars movie.
Simply speaking, this movie has Oscar written all over it! From best actor, much deserved, yet again, by Leonardo DiCaprio, and supporting actor, Tom Hardy. And Oscars for cinematography and screenplay are in order. I actually read the book, and the movie was actually BETTER! (Now, how often does that happen?)
I cannot wait to see and own this spectacular movie achievement.
Jeremiah Johnson movie has FINALLY been outdone in the 'Mountain man - Sheer survival' movie genre.",1452384000,13,1011,4.918128654970761

7588918,5,B01A71FC90,another wonderful movie by dicaprio I may have to watch it again. I just dint get why he didn't get an Oscar that's just a pain in the head. I guess I love it,1452297600,3,158,3.676470588235294
7588919,5,B01A71FC90,"For a movie about surviving against all odds in the wilderness after you've been incapacitated and torn apart, The Revenant delivers the goods and doesn't hold back on the gore and brutality, with DiCaprio giving a believable performance of the pain and agony he was going through as this character, where one disaster is followed by another, yet somehow he persists with what little strength he has, motivated by his son.
Nicely crafted survival movie and the scenery and natural sound effects were beautifully portrayed. The story unfolds at a slow but steady pace. Enjoyed it. The Revenant is not for the faint of heart. Or maybe it is, as repeated views can inspire courage and the drive to survive.",1452297600,4,703,4.866666666666666
7588920,4,B01A71FC90,"Simply put, The Revenant is a masterpiece. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (Gravity, Birdman) succeeded, once again, in creating a beautiful work of art. In my humble opinion, I believe he deserves his third Academy Award in a row.

The Revenant has been largely promoted as a revenge tale. However, it's more than just a revenge tale. It's a story about a father's love for his son, and his determination, through many intense hardships, to bring justice to his son's killer. It's not a happy tale, but it's still full of beauty. It certainly would not have had the same effect without the captivating performances of both Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy.

I don't think this movie appeals to everyone. It's long, dark, and slow at times. If you want happy endings and continuous action, you may not enjoy the film. However, if you are a stickler for great acting, cinematography, and story telling, do yourself a favor and watch this movie.

Parents Guide: As you should expect with an R-rating, The Revenant does contain some content that you may find offensive. There is a scene in which a captive woman is raped (no nudity), but the man is stopped mid-way through. DiCaprio is briefly seen nude in another scene (none sexual). Profanities include several uses of f***, n*****, as well as some mild swear words. Violence ranges from extreme to moderate depending on the sequence. Even I had to cringe at times.

All-in-all, the content is used realistically, and is not enhanced like in many Hollywood productions.",1452297600,164,1519,4.921875
7588921,5,B01A71FC90,This film has many excellent visuals and superb acting. The movie is 2 1/2 hours long and plods along. Music score and cinematography are superb. Highly recommend.,1452297600,4,163,5.074074074074074
7588922,5,B01A71FC90,"A group of American fur hunters who use Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) as their guide are attacked by Native Americans. A small group escape by boat, but they know they are being tracked. Unknown to the fur hunters the Native Americans are looking for the chief's daughter who was abducted. Glass devises a plan to throw off the trackers. Unfortunately he gets mauled by a grizzly in a very realistic scene of which the trailer only gives you a glimpse. Near death, Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) a crusty untrustworthy man, is left behind to tend to Glass and give him a proper burial when he dies. Events happen that turns Fitzgerald into the film's antagonist as Glass pulls out all the stops to survive in the dead of winter and seek justice.

This is not a lone man survivalist film as Glass meets people along the way. There is also a subplot involving Fitzgerald and his group that make it back to the fort. Very gritty film.

Guide: F-bomb, brief rape, brief Leonardo DiCaprio butt nudity.",1452211200,,989,4.645714285714286

7588925,1,B01A71FC90,"DISGUSTING Movie !!!
This sick and sickening movie wallows in the grossest implausibility and subhuman degeneracy.
Virtually no thinking, college-level individual would like this movie at all.

Leonardo Dicaprio portrayed a great many of the GROSSEST of implausibilities:
1) no hunter with the slightest common sense knowingly chooses to stop in the woods next to bear cubs; let alone choose to REST his rifle toward the bear cubs! And:
2) No one can survive plunging into an icy river in winter (let alone shortly after having been mauled by a mother grizzly and left for dead) - especially without having the means to quickly dry himself and warm himself!

And I could go on, and on, and -  about the implausibilities and historical inaccuracies of Leonardo Dicaprio's supposed portrayl of the experiences of the frontiersman: Hugh Glass.",1535846400,,840,5.116788321167883

7588934,3,B01A71FC90,"First,  this moving is about two and a half hours long.  There is a lot of filler in it that really is not needed.  Second,  the story of Glass may be true but even the early version of it seemed to be embellished.  This movie could not even stick with that,  they had to go give Glass a son,  have three guys stay behind instead of two,  etc.  If you know the story you will be put off by the inaccuracies and further embellishments.  If you do not know the story you will be bored because it is way too long.  I got the standard definition version and it worked OK,  but my advice is to wait until the movie is free,  then watch it.

7588972,2,B01A71FC90,"GRANTED, there are a few wonderful moments in this sadistic tale of vengeance, betrayal, mutilation, rape, etc ..... it's an accurate reflection of early nineteenth century 'pioneer' life ... but Award Worthy?  Eliminate, the extensive and laborious 'cringe-worthy' make-up ... and just what is left?
  Performances over the past decade or two seem to be solely rewarded for, err .... 'transformation' .... [""The Hours"" / nose; ""Monster"" / contacts, bad teeth and weight gain ... etc. etc.  I guess we have to blame Shelley Winters - ""Poseidon Adventure""] .... Rare ones like Spencer Tracy could actually act ....

However ...  we've seen this all before - Cate Blanchett's ""The Missing"" [graphic too - but better] .....  Here ... once more the Good Guy is betrayed by 'best friend' [who also bumps off the son]  .... Good Guy is almost mauled to death by a Bear Mama .... suffers through a hellish winter, oozing pus from slowly-healing  wounds [he MUST have an amazing immune system!] , is befriended by a soul-mate ... they share 'zen-like' moments .....

DiCaprio is just too young for this role and and still far too glam as well in the role  [perfect teeth, a very youthful body,  pristin ehands - impervious to the harsh elements, etc.]  Crowe would have been a better choice ... even Tommy Lee Jones [""The Missing""] broughts that weary, gnarled psyche to his performance.  IF anything - it was a 'Sympathy Award' - since he is so much better in other earlier movies - excluding 'Gatsby' ...

Tom Hardy?  NOW here's something of note -  a brilliant Oscar Worthy performance since he is totally unrecognisable - and creates a memorable 'bad dude' ......  Art Direction is stellar.  Costumes?  Perhaps more ageing - especially the soles of the boots ... far too 'new'.

It's an oddity ......and quite a long-long movie ...... if one's into pain and quasi-spiritual mumbo-jumbo  .. by all means ...",1531699200,,1902,4.859813084112149

7588975,4,B01A71FC90,"From what I can read in the other reviews, most people don't get out into wild spaces very often. When you are out in the woods, far from any city, things slow down. It gets very quiet, time seems to stand still and you are overcome with a sense of time and how nature moves in a rhythm all it's own. From that standpoint, I think the movie does very well. (This is written here mostly for the slack-jawed idiots on Amazon that think there ""were too many pretty tree/nature shots"" in the film.) The director is obviously setting a sense of place and a vast wilderness is that place.

Go into viewing this movie knowing that it's partially fiction. It will help you suspend disbelief when the main character survives a myriad of things that would kill most people. Starvation, hypothermia, bleeding out, infection, bear attack, falling off a cliff, drowning in a frozen river, knife wounds, gunshot wounds... it's a long list. I may have even missed a few.

If you can get over that, then sit back and enjoy a good revenge movie.  The acting is solid, the plot is believable, the cinematography is wonderful.

A few things that bothered me:

First, it's a historical film, more or less. So please set us up with some kind of text over the picture at the beginning that says ""Missouri Territory, 1823"" or whatever. Without that, we're left to think it's much later for a few reasons, the mention of Texas twice, being one. The only thing that clued me in was the fact that there were some Lakota Souix costumes and language used, so I figured ""middle of the country somewhere"" and the French still being here as trappers.

Steamy breath on the lens of the camera: Bad, shouldn't happen. As well, going to fisheye viewpoints twice killed the otherwise fine job of shooting. And WAAAAAYYYY too many ""selfie"" stick shots and far too close up into the faces and action in far too many scenes. That's headache inducing. Myself and the group I watched this with were all bothered by that. But hey, what do we know? That got an Oscar, right? Oh well.  It was like there were two or three people shooting this thing. Nature shots: one guy, Fight scenes, another guy and survival scenes, one more.

All in all, it was worth watching and I had been waiting a couple of years to do so. So, four stars. And by the way, great CGI bear.",1531612800,,2320,4.494061757719715

I was suspicious about the likelihood of surviving the injuries depicted, but that only exhibits my willingness to believe the other elements of the narrative.  The direction and cinematography is simply stunning.  It is unique.  There is one scene of violence towards a woman that I simply wish was cut.  Maybe it fills some role in the tale, but it moves the film into a category of depictions of evil that I am reluctant to embrace.  Still, the beauty of the rest of the camera work is amazing.

Also - for those of us who spend our summers in a tent deep in the backwoods of grizzly territory, there is a scene with a bear that will never leave your memory.  Tremendous film.",1528761600,,836,4.696551724137931

It's a trappers-and-Indians story, set in the 1820s out in Montana and Dakota. A nail-bitingly harrowing tale of survival and revenge in the dead of a brutal winter. And it's excellent in almost all respects. Gorgeously shot, well acted, well written. However, I'm angry that it includes ZERO extras. Not even director's commentary. How I would have liked to see something about how they shot this thing in extreme winter weather; I would have liked to see something about the actual historical events the movie was based on. That's why, without extras, it gets 4 not 5 stars. I bought the DVD, not the Blu or 4K, so they may have extras I didn't have.",1525392000,,767,4.647058823529412

And when you look at his body of work, this is definitely one of the weakest.  The film itself was weak.  Sure, it had lots of gore and guts, but the characters were shallow and the film seemed to drag on forever.  Especially since the outcome was so obvious from the first 30 minutes.  After that, I could barely get through it.  Worth a watch, perhaps.  But 3 stars is being generous.  I will probably never watch it again.",1518048000,,586,4.198198198198198

So the epic journey becomes not so much a battle against a beautiful  but merciless Nature as it is a battle against racism - the hero becomes the protector and vengeance-seeker  of minorities and the villain is - you guessed it - an evil murderous racist white guy with a southern accent. Maybe one day Hollywood will come up with an original  theme",1518048000,2,765,4.765151515151516

7589175,5,B01A71FC90,"The Revenant is a remarkable story in a film that crafts survival and adventure into a bleak season in North America. Leonardo DiCaprIo stars as the tough, frontiers man, Hugh Glass  -and along with a group of fur trappers of beaver, the story will challenge the trappers with the terrible forces of wild nature and hostile Indians to pursue their trade in harshness of landscape.

After a ferocious attack by a grizzly bear, and left for dead by a treacherous member of the team ( played by Tom Hardy, ) Hugh Glass will defy the forbidding odds to struggle to survive, and return home to take revenge ..the revenant is the man who comes back from the dead....

In many ways, the lengthy film prompts my thoughts to some very classy films  I keenly name them: 'The Black Robe' ; 'The New World' ( Colin Farrell ) ; The Russian film 'Andrei Rublev' ;  Akira Kurosawa's 'Dreams' ; and the beautiful and visual revenge western 'One Eyed Jacks' with Marlon Brando:. Although, maybe not as outstanding ( in comparison ), the film is very close as an epic: of a cinematic journey of a masterclass of film making?

The filming may not appeal to those who are reluctant to watch a snowbound wintry forest in slowness of motion in its character of nature -exquisitely slow, in thoughts and in masochism- but I found it to be exciting in a harrowing, but brutal, true tale to reveal the heart and spirit of mankind in survival, and to search for that wonderful compassion that will arise in sanction of mercy.

The film was directed by Alejandro G. Inamitu ( Birdman ), and cinematic vision by Emmanuel Lubezki .in blizzard white, I embrace winter's grace.....

In reality the French got along famously with the natives and intermarried with them so often that a new ethnic group was created: the Metiz. This director is blatantly bigoted.

The sun, sky, and snow are just stunning. There isn't a whole lot of plot. The main character (Glass) is a tracker and trapper who is leading a group of trappers away from the Ree tribe when he's attacked by a bear. Hopelessly mauled, they leave three trappers (one of whom is Glass's son) with him until he dies so that he can be buried. One of these guys doesn't want to hang around so he kills the son (whom he hates anyway because he's half Native) and leaves Glass for dead. Big mistake. The rest of the movie is about Glass's survival and quest for revenge.

7589245,1,B01A71FC90,"One of the worst movies, relative to hype, that I have Ever seen. Its not just that the movie is bad, I mean, yes it really sucks, but mostly it is just a criminal waste of resources for unclear aims. It fails at the narrative level, at the level of historical accuracy, fails on realism and the only level that it succeeds is with regards to its cinematography.

The most obvious criticism is the most glaring, namely that it takes its title, The Revenant, completely literally: I mean DiCaprio's character gets into recurring impossible situations and comes out alive. If this is some kind of narrative device, it fails utterly and just looks stupid. The worst of all is probably the Grizzly attack. Grizzlies are many times stronger than humans and the only defense against them at close range (short of a grenade launcher) is playing dead and praying like hell. But our idiot protagonist repeatedly fights back, gets repeatedly gets chomped on, and STILL comes out alive, kicking and jumping off cliffs while riding horses. Oddly, not a few personal acquaintances/friends pointed to this scene as an example of how ""realistic"" the movie was. It isn't.

And it is full of idiotic stock American tropes. I mean the French were among the only early settlers who intermarried with the natives and lived in relative peace and harmony (in modern Quebec). Every single British origin colonialist fought with or attacked the natives for Just being them, including the New Englanders. Yet here, the French are vile and terrible to them, and have No saving graces. In the real world, Dicaprio's character would be French, and dead, about 15 minutes into the movie, and 15 seconds after encountering the Grizzly.

All this to say, a total and utter waste of time. If you haven't already suffered this movie, Kudos! Ignore the positive reviews/Oscar and do something useful with two hours of your life (plus an hour of ranting to your friends and 15 minutes of writing this rant!).. Watch paint dry. Or dig a hole and fill it up. At least those activities are meditative and of Some value.",1504224000,2,2081,4.807262569832402

Audio Quality: 4.5/5

You are almost immediately plunged into the action, in a similar way to the opening of 'Saving Private Ryan', with a Native American attack on a group of fur trappers. DiCaprio even does that momentarily deaf thing that Tom Hanks does. Lots of bows and arrows and gore and excellent photography that is really immersive. Great opening scene.

There there's the scene where DiCaprio is mauled by a grizzly bear. Again, really believable, exciting and up front and personal - you can almost smell the bear's stinking breath. Brilliant.

And then there's ... well ... not much really. Photography and scenery are by and large excellent but you do get the feeling that better use could have been made of them. I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu often seems to chop scenes around for no particular reason, although you do get the occasional sense of the vast wilderness that comes over well on the big screen.

Dialogue is scarce. Most of it goes to Tom Hardy who tries to put on a Texan accent but succeeds in sounding as if he has a sock in his mouth (does he specialise in being inaudible? remember him as the mumbling Bane in 'The Dark Knight Rises'?).

Then there's the storyline. You know the ending, right? (Just look up the definition of 'revenant'.) Leo is up against it and he suffers a great deal. But you know he is going to survive. So when, to top everything, he falls off a cliff on his horse you realise he's actually become Mr Indestructible. And two and a half hours of crawling, grimacing and wincing does not a very entertaining film make.

There are also several non-credible plot twists. Like when Tom Hardy (a.k.a. The Mumbler) somehow cracks an impressive-looking safe and makes off with the garrison money and just two guys go after him, including the garrison commander. This nicely sets up the final confrontation between Mr Indestructible and The Mumbler .... but really?

We also develop little or no emotional connection with the main character. The silent dream scenes are a clich&eacute;d way of trying to do this and they don't work in my opinion - they're just puzzling and boring. Nor do we see much of the relationship between Leo and his son to set up the emotional links between them - just Leo being harsh and dishing out tough love a couple of times.

The pacing is also poor. Once you've passed the opening scene and the grizzly scene, feel free to go and refresh your popcorn - you won't miss much.

Overall, the film is self-consciously bleak and overdetermined and is unevenly paced. A better director might possibly have made this a good film but I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu is clearly not David Lean..

Question: Hugh Glass gets mauled not once, not twice, but three times, by a grizzly, dragged around and stomped on and then becomes the cushion for the 700 pound grizzly when they go over a ledge.  He loses lots of blood, apparently doesn't go into shock, and somehow gets patched up.  He gets tossed into a grave and he -- and all his open wounds -- get covered by dirt.  He lives.  Yet, in the opening scene, men are felled and killed by one arrow in the shoulder.  Also interesting from the opening scene, the accuracy of the arrows is amazing.  Fast forward to when the Indians are chasing Hugh on horseback.  Why can't anyone hit him?  What happened to their marksmanship?

I love most of I&ntilde;naritu's films, and rate him the top creative currently working in cinema at this moment in time, but this one I felt  wasn't really worth the time.  I understand that the film was made in such a way as to seriously challenge the standard film production methodology, and that stand by a director at the height of his artistic and creative powers makes sense (because he can).

7589315,5,B01A71FC90,"This was epic in terms of battle scenes, action, and man's battle with nature as well as between man and man. Glass, (DiCaprio) is the scout for fur trappers. Tom Hardy plays the main fur trapper Fitzgerald, who is obsessed with money to the exclusion of almost all else. His actions trigger war with the Indians,who are allied with the French. The perils are depicted very well and Glass barely seems able to catch a break as he seeks revenge for all that has been done to him. Some of the scenes are truly horrifying. The bear scene was appallingly real. Hats off to whomever created it, and the aftermath of what happened seems incredible were it not for the fact we know this is based on a true story. The real winner here is the scenery-spectacular. I am glad I saw it and I could say I enjoyed it, but it requires afair amount of endurance to watch DiCaprio go through living hell.

Almost nothing in the movie actually happened in real life.  In the real story there was no murdered son, he was just ditched by guys who truly thought he would die, and not maliciously like they make out in this movie.

7589404,4,B01A71FC90,"First ""Birdman"", and then ""The Revenant"".  Director Alejandra Inarritu gives his viewers some very specific and memorable scenes and characters that burn themselves into the cranium.  For my money ""Birdman"" is the better film being far more layered and multi-faceted.  ""The Revenant"" character story arcs are pretty standard revenge fare.  What makes this film stand out are the long, icy, rugged visuals and terrain and the sheer stark deathrattle survival of star Leonardo DiCaprio's character Hugh Glass, himself being the ""animated corpse"" of the title who tracks down Tom Hardy's cold blooded killer character, John Fitzgerald, who offed among others Glass' Native American son.  Fitzgerald himself is essentially a walking dead man so he too could be considered as another titular revenant; it's only a matter of time before Glass catches up with him and kills him, or seen another way it's only a matter of time before his sins catch up to and condemn and consign him to death (a dictionary definition of the word, which I was completely unfamiliar with, is: a visible ghost or animated corpse that is believed to have revived from death to haunt the living).

While ""Birdman"" was a feast for the senses in many ways ""The Revenant"" is mainly a feast for the eyes though it will likely make your heart race and perhaps your legs a little weak at moments.  For fans of westerns where much more is said without a word being spoken.  4.5 stars.",1491609600,,1447,4.901639344262295

7589443,3,B01A71FC90,"Let me start with the good: Dicaprio is fantastic, I think he did his finest acting in this movie.  He has said this was the most challenging role of his career, but he was up the task and portrayed a man of that era in the wilderness perfectly.  The scenery, which can often steal the show, almost does it here as well, the locations were perfect for the story.  The camera work, wow just so different, so new, really outside the box in the way it's done and it works here.  The close-ups, the camera following Dicaprio as he's chased across a field is amazing.

Now the bad: if the movie had simply followed the story in the book I would have gladly given it 5 stars, but the movie makes up entire story arcs and characters out of whole cloth.  I won't give away any spoilers here, but I'd just read this book about 7 weeks ago and was looking forward to seeing it portrayed on film, this wasn't it.  Much of the book is here, but entire sections are missing, important sections too.  And people are simply made up that aren't in the book at all, I've seen a character dropped or added before going from book to screen, but I don't recall the last time a movie has differed this much from the book it's based on.

My summary would be that the acting and camera work are incredible, well worth seeing just for the craft alone.  If you're a stickler for movies following the book this movie might irk you, but even so I'd encourage you to watch it and enjoy the movie making skill on display here.",1489968000,6,1497,4.276595744680851

That rubbed me wrong. Just typing it makes me want to drop it to 4 stars. Besides that it is a beautifully directed movie and all the actors did an amazing job!,1487462400,,338,4.059701492537314
7589520,2,B01A71FC90,"Tried to watch it.  But it is very bleak, very dull and very violent.  The bear attack was pretty ridiculous if you ask me.  But I could not watch it after that.  I don't know if it got any better after the first 30 minutes because I turned it off.  I am not sure what I was expecting.  But because the film got such positive reviews and a best picture nomination as well as best actor award for Leonardo DiCaprio - I thought I would watch it.  But I could not get past the first half hour and it was just too dark and gruesome from the get go.  And was it just me or was it difficult to understand the mumbling dialogue of the trappers?",1487462400,,637,4.0

And, there is what was not present that made it special too.  By this I mean blood was displayed for a purpose not just randomly.
Everything in this movie was purposeful.  Just when you think quality is in the distant past you are rewarded for going out on a limb
to trust the cast and crew to come through!  Another star may not have been as interesting to watch as Leo.  However, he really owned this role.
I loved the effects...the bear...over the cliff...down the rapids...removal of the organs...switching horse passengers...all was a unique experience.

I was going to send it back as my wife bought me the movie and didn't know I ordered it from Amazon, but I delayed beyond 30 days so I will give the movie to someone who probably won't read the book.  Movie was disappointing for one who has read the book, so if you've read The Revenant by Michael Punke, skip the movie as you, too, will be sorely disappointed.  deCaprio does a good job of acting, though.

7589557,5,B01A71FC90,"Talk about beautiful cinematography... JEEZE! Leonardo DiCaprio's acting in this movie was STELLAR, hes a great actor all around, but this is my favorite performance of his. Very dark, very gritty, this film reveals the cruel and relentless punishment that mother nature can dish out. The physical pain and suffering in this film feel very VERY real, I couldn't help but gasp and cringe at a number of scenes. The action scenes are very focused and harsh, and the struggle of survival is depicted in perfection. Not everyone will like it because its not brimming with action scenes, there is a decent amount of downtime where the film slows a bit and reels you in to the inclement environment, but for those of you who don't mind 2 and a half hours of great acting, breathtaking shots, and the harsh reality of nature, this is a MUST WATCH.
Fun Fact!: All of the shots in this film use NATURAL LIGHTING, thats right, no extra lights, spotlights, anything like that, just what the sun and the clouds gave the directors, and what they could create with actual fire and torches, nothing else.",1486598400,,1089,4.706806282722513

7589668,5,B01A71FC90,"Inarritu has plenty to say about our national origins and the resilience of the human spirit, but the ultimate appeal of this movie will be its astonishing visual and aural palette. The movie's slow pace gives Inarritu and his team ample opportunity to explore and savor the detail and ambience of every location and event. He does this not to create pretty images but to show that the human imagination--no matter how battered and assaulted--still retains the ability to wonder and ponder the staggering beauty of an otherwise indifferent environment.

A variety of devices--photographic, digital FX--are deployed with astonishing taste and judgment. I think it's great that ILM is doing more these days besides laser battles and superhero movies. Inarritu uses recurring images of trees, running water, falling snow--the usual art-house crap--but he invests them with fresh and personal meaning. I felt like I was watching something inspired and heart-felt during every frame of the movie.

Cynics might claim that Di Caprio has less than 100 lines during the whole movie. Nonetheless, his performance is excellent. He connects with the audience using body language, facial expressions, and the occasional grunt. Hardy is a very menacing presence. His frontier accent and speech rhythms are spot-on.

Isolation is perhaps the movie's ultimate theme. All of the characters do things they must do to survive while in the wilderness, and all then have to return to society to account for their actions. Di Caprio looks directly at the screen in the last shot. He seems like he's about to die or collapse, and his entreating stare seems like a plea for someone to understand his side of events before he's gone for good. The gap between who we are and how others see us remains unbridgeable.",1485648000,,1789,5.098976109215017

I now add The Revenant to that list. It looks better then any movie I've ever seen as far as camera angles and scenery. I've never really felt as much inside a movie as when I watched The Revenant. I didn't see it in 3D or in the theatre, just saw it on blu-ray on my old Vizio 46inch. I don't know if they used a new camera or technology for this movie but everything looks so clear and real. You almost feel like you're outside in the elements when you're watching it. The sound is really good and it has maybe the best score I've heard in years. The score speaks words through its music. Leonardo DiCaprio has greatly improved as an actor, I remember feeling he was outclassed by Daniel Day Lewis in Gangs of New York. The acting in The Revenant is very good but so is the story. The story is perfect for our time. It's what everything about: THE PELTS aka money.  Really the movie has everything: Story, Visuals, Sound, Acting. The Revenant is a master work of art that should be considered for all time. I don't say things like that much anymore.",1484697600,,1227,4.405286343612334

7589741,2,B01A71FC90,"I gave the movie 2 stars because it was so slow and really didn't go anywhere.  Maybe i missed the point but it seems that while it has moments of excitement and adventure, overall there wasn't much more to it. DeCaprio's character could have been played by any decent actor as there was no depth to him at all. It has some good CGI but it doesnt save it for me.  My main impression of a movie Comes from whether I'd really want to see it a second time. For this one it is take it or leave it. One of those you'd watch if nothing else was on.",1484697600,,542,3.963302752293578

The laws of hypothermia are also constantly defied.  Ask Bear Grills if a survivalist would wander into freezing streams out in the middle of nowhere without some plan for warming up.

Seriously? If you make a movie about survival, at least go beyond the comic books for advice.

7589876,5,B01A71FC90,"Excellent work, Leo. Can see why you won and Oscar for this role. This movie, which was out last year, maybe longer, is a must see. I recently decided to download HBO to catch up after the holidays with some binge watching. So happy this is one of a handful of movies I chose. Set in late 1800s upper west snow/wild animal country. Just when you think this character has had the worst of the worst done to him, to betray and kill him multiple times, it keeps getting worse, full of surprises right from the get-go. A true story of survival and lessons to be learned. The power of love for one's child and how far a parent will go in any generation to avenge their child's murder. I'm a lone survivor myself of multiple horrific events throughout my life but Leo's character really helps put things in perspective living in our digital world and EMT help at the push of a button compared to what men and women went through in the 1800s (and earlier) without medical attention for bullets, arrows, spears, getting buried alive, falling off mountains, drowning, staying alive and warm inside a dead horse, bear attacks, you name it. It was either live or die. Nature and the will to survive prevailed. Thanks Leo, cast and crew, for such an excellent, edge of my seat, nail biting, thrilling movie. Will watch multiple times.",1483574400,,1322,4.5588235294117645

Fantastic cinematography, the feeling that nature is bigger than all of us is never lost in this movie.  Inarritu delivers another fantastic job of directing (his ""Birdman"" won best picture).  He lays back and lets DiCaprio and the supporting cast steal the show, as a good director should. But only a great director can get these kind of performances from actors.  I majored in directing in my hat is off to this man.
Warning: this is brutal and extreme realism - not for people that want to watch feel-good ""Rom-Coms"" all night.  This is the real deal.",1483488000,,727,4.722222222222222

It does an excellent job of portraying life in the wilderness in the 1800's of men who trapped furs for a living and lived a very raw life just to survive. I honestly do not know how Leonardo DiCaprio ever managed to live through this movie while it was being made - I was frozen the whole time and felt like I was right there with him & the other trappers and Indians. Life back then was horrible and for the men that chose trapping in the wild during the time that Indians stalked everywhere; they really had a rough life. Eating raw fish & meat and even rotten food was just the way they had to take it sometimes, to survive. The Cinematographer Lubezki and the Director Alejandro certainly deserved awards for their skills and talents. I am going to look up the movie ""Man in the Wilderness"" with Richard Harris just to compare how the story was portrayed differently. This is an incredible movie, which certainly entertained me, even if it was hard to believe that the main character could survive so many unbelievable threats to his life!",1483488000,19,1179,4.408256880733945

The positives are the stunning natural scenery, and the depiction of knowledge and perseverance needed to survive in this environment despite both natural and human challenges.  The ebb and flow of the movie is pretty good, and the acting is solid.

The negatives are that the characters aren't well developed, and the story lacks richness and depth.  We don't learn much about the individuals and cultures depicted in the movie, despite wanting to, and I didn't come away from this movie with much to reflect on.

While I can recommend this movie, I would much more strongly recommend the movie ""Black Robe"", which has similar natural settings and a few similar themes, but is a much more expansive and profound movie.",1483401600,,865,4.771812080536913
7589927,5,B01A71FC90,"Even though Leonardo is a whacked out commie, he's still a decent actor. This is probably his best role yet. Love the movie, but if they actually spent that much time in the water in those temperatures in the Rocky Mountains they all would have died from hypothermia pretty quickly. It is great to see an old mountain man story on the big screen, albeit very Hollywood style. The real Hugh Glass story is a bit different and the ""ree"" or Arikara Indians never lived in the mountains. They tried to bring in some popular mountain man names like Colter and Bridger, but they don't fit in the real life context of Hugh Glass, but it's still an incredible movie.",1483401600,,658,4.491666666666666

7589977,5,B01A71FC90,"Well acted, magnificent scenery, but an underdeveloped script.  The original version of this, based on the same book, starring Richard Harris, was better in terms of script and plot development.  Richard Harris, however, was not Leonardo di Caprio.  Di Caprio proved himself an Oscar-worthy actor in this film.  I had never before been impressed by him, really considering him to be a bit of a lightweight and holding a backseat to better actors, like Brad Pitt.  I was wrong.  Di Caprio is a real heavyweight, and he proves it in great fashion.  A really good movie and well worth the time to watch.",1482969600,2,600,4.766990291262136

The cinematography beautifully captures the director's inspired stylistic staging of character development scenes, excellent acting and the gut-wrenching full-out action scenes.

It covers his entire life starting with his time as a merchant marine, being taken hostage by pirates, escaping and eventually finding his way to the Midwest where he was nearly killed, and then befriended, by Indians where he learned his survival skills.  The movie focuses entirely on is time shortly after being attacked by the grizzly bear, is short on dialogue (two hours of grunting and mumbling) and ends with his catching and killing the person who killed his Indian son.  He never had an Indian son nor did he kill either of the two who were charged with staying with him but instead left him for dead after the bear attack.

7590155,5,B01A71FC90,"I saw this in the theater.  I haven't watched the blu-ray yet.  This movie has a different feel from what you're used to.  They avoid switching cameras, which makes it feel more like you're really there, experiencing everything there live as it happens.  The movie has a lot of realism and brutality and violence.  But it's not the lame fake violence you see a lot where they just shoot things up for no reason.  This is more like things happen for good reasons, and there's a real plot to follow!  I felt like I was transported back in time and I was actually there experiencing what was going on. / Also check out Leonardo's documentary about climate change.

Also the changes made to the actual history were a bit over the top but they didn't hurt the film in any significant way.  In the end I think what killed the movie for me was the strange placement of sound effects that didn't match the scenes such as a running brook that played in the background over about 10 minutes of film featuring various scenes that had no running water in them while some woman whispered.  It felt like the sound director went and got one of those native american sounds CDs at a strip mall, popped it in his 90s boom box and let it play over half the movie.  I'm sure many found it to be artistic and meaningful but to me it just came off pretentious and distracting.  There were some visual shots that were confusing here and there as well.

7590228,4,B01A71FC90,"Not for the squeamish, but visually stunning. Based on a true (but embellished, according to historians) tale of survival, this film is truly the director's vision. The American West depicted here is unrelentingly bleak, treacherous, and brutal, as are the French coureur des bois, American fur trappers, and vengeful Indians who inhabit it. There is no romanticism here.

The camerawork and photography are sublime, with many haunting images. The opening Indian attack is a tour-de-force of swirling action and brutality. Ditto the mauling of DiCaprio's character by an angry momma grizzly.

At times the camera is uncomfortably intimate with the characters, moving and turning with them in closeup, dragging us into the story so much that you almost feel the cold and the pain.

A couple of quibbles: The Tom Hardy character is a one-dimensional villain whose accent sounds like a parody of Billy Bob Thornton in Slingblade. The changing landscape is jarring, considering the journey depicted is less than 200 miles, reflecting that the movie was shot in multiple locations on different continents to achieve the visuals the director wanted

He gets separated, without giving anything away, from his team and encounters everything man and nature can throw at you.  As history, it has a simple, genuine feel to it.  The characters aren't exaggerated and unbelievable.  The movie doesn't explain itself, with the same tone as Cohen Brothers' ""True Grit""...but it you look intently, you'll see that everything rings true.  LASTLY, the best part, is the photography.  I've travelled most of the nation during many different times of year, and am nonetheless STUNNED by the photography.  It's worth watching for that reason alone.

7590261,2,B01A71FC90,"Given all the hype, I expected this movie to be very engaging, exciting and, at least somewhat intellectually satisfying.  Unfortunately, I  had to wade through two hours of shallow plot, unnecessarily excessive visceral violence and undeveloped character lines before I finally felt engaged.  My girlfriend left the couch within the first 15 minutes but I felt obligated to get some value out of my eight dollar purchase.  The plot was shallow and formulaic. It had the requisite violence in all the gory detail that today's technology can create. It also had the predictable components of sexual misconduct, Indian exploitation and faces slopped with the blood of raw meat and organs. On top of that, the various challenges the main character endures were presented in fabulously unrealistic extreme.

I would have rated it a 1 if it turned me off to the point that I turned it off. It didn't quite take me that far down hill because the scenery, the supporting characters and the prospect of something more kept me on the couch...or maybe, it was my dog cuddled in my lap that kept me seated.",1479600000,2,1095,4.865591397849462

All of that would just amount to pretty pictures but there's so much more to it. Dicaprio and his fellow actors are so real, that the film delivers a visceral feeling of what it must have been like in those 19th century days of fur trading out in the unsettled west.

7590322,4,B01A71FC90,"I can't truly say I ""like"" this movie, but I admire it for just that reason: it doesn't want to be liked, it only wants to tell its story. Due to the film's stark bleakness and graphic violence, to ""like"" it would be the equal of liking a masterful painting of a child being skinned alive: though one can admire the artist's skill at painting, one cannot feel similarly about the subject the artist chose. What is admirable about the Revenant is at no point does it try to become more palatable to me or to anyone except maybe a sadist. I guess...I guess I admire the film's relentless pursuit of itself--in other words, the story knows where it is going and is only concerned with getting there.",1478304000,,696,4.4453125

7590335,2,B01A71FC90,"While the visuals were fairly well done, the theatrical trailer showed all the most impressive scenes. While the actors played their parts well, the writing was simply awful. The plot was thin, the historical accuracy dubious, the attempt to portray native americans in a sympathetic light (depending on the perspective they're both the heros and the villains) came across as colonialist and patronizing at best. The story (what there was of it) dragged on indefinitely - it was a movie that just wouldn't die. By the end I was rooting for anyone that tried to kill off the protagonist to get it over with sooner. If I could give it one and a half stars, I would. It merits that much only by virtue of the setting (the time period and impressive landscapes) and the casting, otherwise I'd have given it none at all.

I could only watch about 40 minutes of it at first because it was so depressing, but when I returned to viewing it, I found it just sluggish and boring. diCaprio did not have to do much acting, just a lot of grunting and face-making, and wearing lots of gruesome make-up, Tom Hardy was difficult to notice at first, so different from his appearance and acting in The Drop.

The only conclusion that I could come too for the poor ratings is that we have grown so used to movies that do not build the characters or the elements that formed them. In short anything requiring an extended attention span is boring.

Is the Movie long yes... However, it is a visual masterpiece that immerses you into the time, conditions and situations people faced at the time.

I really appreciate how this movie brought to life to the reality of the time. Providing an unapologetic view of how people thought to how people survived. We also get a beautiful glimpse of what our beautiful wilderness looked like before industrial pollution.",1477612800,,884,4.617834394904459

Typical Hollywood, except this time they scored a home-run in their plagaristic endeavors - it should be known that there was very little original about this movie it was so liberally borrowed from the aforementioned film (also based on a true story, probably the same one).
So Revenant was an ok movie, but don't get so excited, flowery and full of yourselves in describing its merits, technical prowess, story line, etc. - a masterpiece it ain't...and as to Oscar, well we all know what appeals to the average public, translated into Box Office, generally appeals to the Oscar Committee (though in all fairness not always).

7590481,5,B01A71FC90,"The Revenant film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Hugh Glass. The beginning of the film opens with Glass and other men around them fighting for their life. One of the reasons that is given in the movie why such a war broke out relates to one of the daughters named Powaqa (Melaw Nakekho) of an Arikawa leader named Elk Dog (Duane Howard)being kidnapped by someone andor some people affiliated with the French hunters. Hugh Glass, his son Hawk (Forest Goodluck) and other men are able to survive and get away. However, things take a tougher turn for Glasss character when he is attacked by a grizzly bear and his life is eventually left in the hands of John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) and Will Poulter (Jim Bridger). It is tempting to mention more details and characters mentioned in the film yet I must take care to keep details brief for other people who have yet to see Revenant. I also became interested in watching the Revenant after finding out that the author whose book this movie is based on also works a day job.

7590505,2,B01A71FC90,"It baffles me that this film won Oscars. Are the people giving out these awards totally clueless? If anything, Hardy should have gotten the prize. He's pretty much the only enjoyable part of the movie. I'm not saying Leo's performance is bad. It just seems like for 75 percent of the film, all he's doing is crawling around and grunting. This fits with the story, but Oscar-worthy? Hardly. I also found the bear attack very disappointing. This seems to be the scene everyone is talking about, but I just don't see it. The Edge, starring Anthony Hopkins, did it much better. And that film is about 20 years old. Practical effects trump CGI any day. Another thing I noticed was how stuff was always getting on the camera. If you're filming a water scene or something like that, it's understandable. But in this movie, it seems to happen every 10 minutes. Must have been a deliberate choice the director made. But it doesn't work. It takes you out of the film whenever it occurs. Ever think of just zooming in? Apparently not. Overall, it's probably not as bad as I'm making it sound. It's just that, with all the awards and hype, I expected much more. Keep your expectations low, and maybe you'll think it was better than I thought it was.",1475539200,,1237,4.576576576576577

7590613,5,B01A71FC90,"The Revenant is one of the best movies I've ever seen!  I'm totally serious.  I remember all the awards and attention it got earlier this year showing Leonardo DiCaprio alone in the wilderness and fighting for his life.  I wasn't sure at the time what he was fighting.  Looked like a very different role for Leonardo but let me tell you, it's a *very good* role and he should continue doing these kinds of movies in the future.

When Leonard DiCaprio's attacked by a bear, his hunting team carries him along the trails in 1823 America because he knows the trails very well whereas his team would be lost without him, however pretty soon Leonardo's health deteriorates to the point he becomes more of a hassle and inconvenience for the team.  Tom Hardy's character, who's the lying ruthless member of the hunting team, even thinks about shooting Leonardo on a couple occasions to end his misery, but Leonardo's son (played by Forrest Goodluck) intervenes and Forrest ends up stabbed and killed.  Let me tell you, this scene is VERY graphic.  Leonardo is forced to watch his son being stabbed and he's too injured and helpless to do anything about it.  You can see the anger and saliva dripping from Leonardo's mouth to express how much he wants to stop/kill Tom Hardy.

Leonardo's life is almost taken a second time when Tom Hardy tries to kill him yet again, but his partner (a young kid played by Will Poulter) intervenes to save Leonardo again.  So Tom drags Leonardo into a ditch and covers him with a little bit of dirt.  And these aren't even the most graphic scenes!  Let's talk about the actual bear attack.  Let's just say this is why I'm absolutely terrified of bears.  I fear bears for this very reason- they're unpredictable and attack without mercy.  The way they can tower over people very easily is another terrifying thing about these animals.

When a mother bear catches Leonardo by surprise, he turns around and tries to shoot but it's too late.  The bear is already attacking.  It's crazy that Leonardo was able to come up with a strategy to shoot the bear when she came back again, but despite his gun pointing directly at the bears head, somehow he misses the shot so it's round two of Leonardo getting chewed and beaten on.  This is when Leonardo's hunting team has to carry him around and eventually gets frustrated about it.  I've never seen a bear attack this graphic in all my life.  I imagine technology was used to make it look like the bear's attacking him, but isn't actually there.  I highly doubt the movie directors brought in a REAL bear and allowed it to pretend to attack Leonardo!

The Revenant is also not without several more violent moments.  Realistically violent perhaps I should say.  Since it takes place in 1823, you can probably guess it involves Americans invading the country and shooting/killing the Native American people.  Both sides are portrayed as violently as one could imagine.  While this isn't the ultimate movie that shows the British invading and taking over America (I'm still searching for the most accurate movie in that category) the first 20 minutes are truly violent, not to mention intense with the feeling of dread and uncertainty looming in the air.  It's a scene that shows Native Americans sneaking around and shooting Leonardo's hunting team one by one, and I must say their strategy was quite clever because for the longest time nobody could figure out where the arrows were coming from.

Also the French/Canadians are part of this movie. I actually didn't even stop to think they'd probably be a part of all this back in 1823.  Then again maybe not.  Not sure if any of the events taking place in the movie are accurate.  They're portrayed as ruthless rapists, liars and party animals.  Not sure if that's accurate or not.  The scene that shows a French/Canadian having sex with a woman behind a tree, and Leonardo sneaks up and grabs the man which enables the woman to break free and defend herself is a great moment of the story.

Basically the story is that Leonardo has to take revenge on Tom's character for not only killing his son, but leaving him for dead.  I don't think I remember if they stated why Leonardo's son is a Native American.  Then again thinking about the very final moment of the story, the constant female voices Leonardo hears throughout the movie while on his journey across the snowy mountains and lakes, and another scene earlier with a woman's voice expressing how when a thunderstorm moves in it looks like the branches aren't stable... I think I can put the pieces together and figure out why his son is Native American.

Tom Hardy does a tremendous job playing the villain, but I can't help but notice how much older he looks than he really is.  Some amazing make up was used to make him look *that* old!  And the same kind of amazement can be expressed for the way Leonardo DeCaprio looks.  He looks authentic like he was not only made for the role of a frontiersman who's acclimated to the mountains, but also the way he looks is just so different and yet so fitting for him!  Leonardo should do more movies like this!

I can't help but wonder if Leonardo's character was either the luckiest or unluckiest person on the planet.  How many times did he find himself in a life or death situation?  And how many times was he able to *escape* from a life or death situation?  That bear should have killed him and yet he survived.  However the fact he was attacked so aggressively is hard to watch.  Tom should have shot and killed Leonardo on at least two occasions, and yet the other hunting mates and/or his son just happened to be around to intervene and save his life.  Even leaving Leonardo for dead with snow falling on top of him, he's able to recover just enough to slowly get back on his feet and continue on.

Later on Leonardo's hiding behind rocks as Native Americans approach the mountaintop.  Though detected, Leonardo is able to get away just enough to swim the nearby river and barely avoid their gunshots... but it's unlucky that he had to ride the strong current down the river.  He should have been shot and killed when he approaches a Native American by a fire eating a dead animal who's also out for revenge looking for the ones who shot his family, and points a bow and arrow at Leonardo's head.  But... the man holds back.  He doesn't shoot.  These two become temporary partners by sharing animal meat and riding horses together.  Or when Leonardo wakes up to an arrow hitting the tree behind him- he quickly jumps on his horse, runs for a little while and jumps off a cliff and lands in a pine tree.  If he'd never fallen down that cliff, he would have been shot and killed (I think it was the French/Canadians doing the shooting in this scene- can't recall at the moment since it happened so quickly).  Just so many unlucky situations leading to luck playing a part in his escape!

You just want to see Tom Hardy get what's coming to him.  You know it's going to happen!  To think he went back to his fellow frontiersmen and lied saying that Leonardo was no longer alive and upon finding out that he is, Will Poulter's character gets the blame.  You're terrible Tom Hardy!  Overall, this movie's amazing.  The definition of revenant- someone who comes back from the dead.  Yup, knowing that pretty much describes what is not only the best movie in Leonardo's entire career, but one that has an extremely good story behind it to assure that even at 2 hours and 25 minutes, you won't be bored at all.  Really strong characters too, and most of them are fully developed which doesn't happen often in today's movies.  Awesome movie.",1474156800,,7655,4.612426035502959

I can't believe how it felt to watch this movie due to the realistic nature and total engagement.

The cinematography of this film is beautiful and the camera work is very visceral. The quality is so good, I felt as if I was physically present at many of the scenes. If you have a good surround sound system, I now believe films such as this are better experienced at home than in the cinema (even IMAX, which is way too loud for my liking), a true testament to the benefits of the UHD HDR technology. If you are wondering whether to invest in physical UHD media, my advice would be absolutely, as long as you appreciate high quality.

7590694,3,B01A71FC90,"Wow, this is a long film; it would benefit from having 30 minutes or so removed but since I am not a professional film-maker I can't tell you which 30 minutes or so, alas.

Afterwards I wondered what Leonardo had done to deserve the acting Oscar. At no stage did I get a sense of the depth of Glass' mental or physical pain although I did see when and how I was supposed to. Having found the list of nominees for best actor I can see why he won it (lack of competition or perhaps it was just his turn) but throughout the film I had the impression that he was a student actor 'doing' pain, rather than a character who was actually in pain. I think he has done better work in Wolf of Wall Street and The Aviator to name but two.

The imagery was great, reminiscent of The Big Country with wide and long shots, mountains and rivers. After a while though there was just a little bit too much of it - I was surprised to be slightly bored by yet another sunrise/sunset through trees from a low angle. One can have too much of a good thing and in the end I became satiated - even to the point of uncharitably thinking that in such great natural scenery one sometimes needn't aim the camera, just turn it on and wave it around because there are great vistas everywhere (a tribute to the director of photography and location scouts, presumably). The scene with the bear was quite excellent.

The main problem I have with the movie is the rapid accelerations in Glass' physical recovery. In a matter of minutes he went from a jibbering wreck to a wreck who could crawl many yards and perform other work; overnight he recovered from being down and out to being able to fight an able-bodied man. I couldn't help but suspect that there had been some telescoping of the original events but that together with my lack of buy-in to the character meant that for me the film was simply a photo-journal of facial expressions, grunts and great vistas.",1473120000,,1931,4.358333333333333

7590699,5,B01A71FC90,"The Revenant is savage, and gruesome, and somehow so very beautiful. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Hugh Glass in this genuine cinematic masterpiece that could easily be described as another revenge movie, but that's not doing it any justice. The Revenant is so much more. There is a deeper story about survival here, and at times it feels incredibly spiritual; with Native American Indians playing a big part, and the mystery of mother nature doing the rest.  There is a minimum of dialogue during much of The Revenant, but it never feels boring or dull, and the use of such stark silence only increases the visceral sense of awe and wonder when Glass is being confronted with nature at her most brutal. The  Revenant means one who comes back, and this is a film that you will want to return to.",1473120000,2,792,4.65

Yes, DiCaprio gives a remarkable performance and you do root for him.  But the ending is so anti-climactic that you can't help feeling a little dirty and cheated for wasting 2.5 hours on all of that gore and hopelessness.  I don't know about you, but I want a movie to restore my faith in humanity.  Might as well just watch the news or a period crime reenactment show.

7590823,5,B01A71FC90,"OMG!!!-this movie is one wild river rush of nail biting suspense, horror, desolation, heartbreak and dark beauty all in one. First, there is the story, and that is enough to make the movie, but then, the utter bleakness and fierce nature colliding with an unmistakable raw beauty, that pulls the movie into what I would call a true Masterpiece of Art. This really isn't just a film about revenge.

I have never been so aware of all of the human senses coming out of the movie and literally forcing the viewer to feel those same senses; Leo wading into ice cold water to catch a fish with his bare hands, then, biting into it. His sheer force of will to keep going, to get up that icy hill after eating the fish. It's a defining moment that says, by God, he WILL live!!!-and of course, if bows and arrows and ambush weren't enough to worry about, now there is a devil amongst the group, his name is Fitzpatrick(Tom Hardy). His wrath has no end.

I was reminded a bit, during the heartbreakingly beautiful forest and landscape scenes of Jim Jarmish's ""Dead Man"", with Johnny Depp. Of course only a bit of similarity.

When Glass's wife is killed and the bird flies out from her, is truly original and mezmerizing. And proof that love lives on in the spirit world. The church scene with his son spoke more than any sorrowful dialogue ever could.

Leonardo DiCaprio has truly accomplished something very few actors can ever lay claim to. This film cannot be eclipsed!!

You would be hard pressed to get worse conditions. I LOVE the aliveness of Nature and the Spirits. I felt the Native Americans true suffering was portrayed, as was their ability to survive insurmountable conditions.

The scene where the ""Tracking"" Native American says something like, What do I have to lose, you white men have already taken everything from us, is SO TRUE and shown in great clarity.

Whenever I think of this film, I will always remember Leo's remarkable grit and determination; the lone Warrior who helped him, and the best scene for me: his son returning to him one more time in the torn down church; the dreamscape that one finds amidst great suffering, if lucky, and one to holdfast to. Alejando's best movie by far. Mucho mucho Bello!!",1472428800,,2224,4.643765903307888

7590860,3,B01A71FC90,"It is a decent film, but I don't think it was worthy of an Oscar. The story seems compelling enough, but I couldn't get into it enough to really care about the character. Leo did a good enough job, as did the other main characters.
I do think that the over-the-top ludicrous things he endures end up taking away my interest...simply because he would not survive. The numerous times he walked, fell, floated in the icy mountain streams (including the time for several miles)...he would have had hypothermia in about 3 minutes in reality. Lying inside a dead horse would be warm for a few hours, then it would turn into a block of very cold meat/ice. And his clothes were wet and outside the horse so they would be ice as well. so many things in this movie would have been the end of him in reality. That just made it more difficult to watch IMO. I actually thought the other actors had more believable characters.
The true story, as near as anyone knows, is basically a guy who was mauled by a bear and left for dead by his fellow trappers. He somehow lived, and found his way back some 200 miles to the Fort, mainly by building a raft and floating downstream for 6 weeks.. There was no Pawnee wife or child. He was just a guy who wanted revenge for being left behind.",1472169600,7,1267,4.350210970464135

So if you have a 4K tv that is also capable of HDR then this is the disk to show much difference that high dynamic range makes. Other UHD disks are good but this one blew me away the most. In fact if you have the Xbox One S as your player you can see if your TV is good enough to show it off in a display feedback menu and then can actually turn off 4K or HDR and back on again to see the massive difference that especially HDR makes. For example the scene where there are just fire torches at night is completely black except for tthe bright lights swinging around. Amazing the deep blacks and bright light can be displayed without bleeding from the light. Massively impressed.",1472169600,,786,4.3108108108108105

The only scene I felt was a slightly bit over the top was the horse over the cliff ( I have ridden horses my whole life a horse WILL not just run off a clig) Plus the whole Skywalker sleep in a horse naked scene is a little tad ridiculous.

7590954,5,B01A71FC90,"ake the direction of Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu, combine it with the stunning cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki and toss in Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy for their acting charms and what do you get? An extraordinary and masterful film.

Fresh off of 'Birdman,' Irritu moved straight on to 'The Revenant,' a western-epic inspired by the true-life experiences of frontiersman Hugh Glass in the winter-struck landscape of 1820s America. The film gained some notoriety in mid-2015 for its production problems and has thus been regarded one of the most challenging film shoots in the history of cinema. Rightfully so. The film opens with the soothing sound of running water, thrusting the audience into an almost meditative state, and then it strikes, an action-packed sequence ensues with a near single sweeping take. Now this is a spoiler-free review, so I'll leave the pleasure of viewing that scene to you.

This film heavily evokes reactions from the audience and does so well, whether it's staring at the screen in awe or gasping at the visceral violence, if you face this film with the right attitude and expectations, it will be a thrill ride like no other. Lubezki has proved that he is one of the most fantastic cinematographers of modern cinema, and the extensive use of natural lighting over artificial supports that statement even further, the film is beyond stunning. Supporting this is the score from the relatively unknown composers, believe me, when the sudden orchestral boom strikes your eardrums, it's mesmerising.

The makeup, the direction, the editing, the visual aesthetics, and of course the performances from a hopefully soon-to-be Oscar winning DiCaprio, 'The Revenant' is a visual treat for those who appreciate cinema and for those who wish to just get absorbed by the immense landscapes and poetic justice Irritu has given it. This is, for me, a modern masterpiece.",1471305600,,1891,5.153094462540716

Tom Hardy was phenomenal and while I thought Leonardo DiCaprio was not the right guy for the part, he was great too.

The movie impressed me, but due to time restrictions (busy career), I watched it in three different sessions, having the opportunity to rerun some scenes.
I realized I could not see the movie at night. It was so realistic it could disturb my sleep. Nothing wrong with this, it just tells you how much the movie can pull you in.
I must say, I vow before this moviemaking prodigy for at least the following three reasons:
1) It is a masterpiece of innovation in photography, Emmanuel Lubezky to be thanked for. Channeling and thriving in the tradition of Mexican photographers such as Gabriel Figueroa.

Some of the single-camera, uncut shots were impressively choreographed and engaging. The bear attack--a central element to the story--was insanely realistic (I've never been attacked by a bear but this looked the closest to what I have dreaded and imagined when I've been camping in places where bears have been known to wander).

7591285,3,B01A71FC90,"My wife and I went into this movie exciting excitement, entertainment and, perhaps, amusement.  This is the epitome of drama.  If it isn't bad enought to be left for dead and return for revenge, the film makers felt it necessary to add components to the movie which really had no need being there.  Those being the voice of a non-existant wife and the sidebar story of a son which defies facts of Glass' life.

This is an incredibly long movie clocking in at nearly 150 minutes  You know how a movie speeds by when you're engrossed in it?  Don't expect that to happen here.  In fact, some of those minutes are painfully slow.  Don't expect witty banter between characters.  What dialog there is sounds as if the actors stuck a plug of chaw in their gobs before saying their lines.

7591353,5,B01A71FC90,"I agree with Archmaker...though the cinematography is beautiful and the acting so real it makes the viewer struggle with the combatants in the fight scenes, this movie isn't for everyone. It almost wasn't for me with its graphic portrayals but I managed to stick with it to see if Glass did indeed get his revenge.

The scenery is beautiful but cold and appropriately hostile and its beauty is juxtaposed with the violence going on in it, suggesting that to survive in this environment one must become brutal, cruel, vicious, and more than a little insane.  Though no mention is given as to where the trappers are, I've read the story is supposed to take place in Montana and South Dakota. It was filmed in Alberta, BC in apparently the dead of winter if the vapor released when dialogue is spoken is authentic.  There are a few scenes where people do things for no apparent reason, such as during the first attack when a trapper selects one horse out three and calmly shoots it...and the success of the chief's search for his daughter is suggested visually but never actually spoken. Her abduction isn't shown but apparently happened before the film began and it appeared to me that the men abducting her were the same one the chief was trading with...but then, all white trappers look alike...

I'm certain there will be comparisons between the scene in which Glass eviscerates his dead appaloosa and climbs inside to protect himself from the snow and a similar scene between Luke Skywalker and his dead tauntaun in The Empire Strikes Back...which copies which?

A good portion of the movie is without dialogue, other than harsh panting and the sounds of struggle, again emphasizing the isolation in which the trappers find themselves.

While I agree di Caprio deserved every award he got for this movie, and all the others commendations are well-earned, I didn't really like the movie. It was  too brutal and violent with no lessening of tension at all.  I also felt it was a little too long and could've been edited a bit to shorten it without harming the storyline. After the two hour-point, I found myself wondering when it would end. I managed to see it through to that ending, however, which was rather abrupt when it arrived.  I wouldn't call this story entertaining but rather a look into the past where life was cheap and the only way really to survive was to be as harsh and cruel as the environment in which one lived. It's definitely a monument to the will of Man to survive, however, and that revenge is a great motivating force.

This movie was viewed as a rental and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.",1469232000,,2643,4.701298701298701

7591364,4,B01A71FC90,"This is the film that landed Leonardo DiCaprio his first Oscar award.  He does an excellent job acting here.  The story revolves around true events in the life of early 19th century trapper Hugh Glass.  Glass is attacked by a bear and the other group of men leave him to die with two other men to watch him and give him a proper burial.  Glass is abandoned by the two men and then proceeds to begin his search for the men to take his revenge.

The movie was good.  The book was much better.  Others will probably disagree.  The movie changes several things including giving Glass a half Indian son who is murdered by one of the men who is to guard him till Glass dies.  I can see the point of adding the son for the revenge purposes but the book doesn't go like that.  Glass, in the book, does hunt down the men but he finds that revenge is best left in the hands of God.

Overall this movie is worth watching but the book is better.  I recommend reading the book and making your own judgment.",1469059200,2,993,4.195767195767195

What is hard for many to understand, is during that period in time, men were men and their fear and pain were replaced with callous. I remember my grandmother tell us kids how her father (my great granddad) broke his leg while hunting in the mountains of WV. He set the break himself, split it and hobbled on home as if it were nothing but a mild setback. Today's men request a nurse for a paper cut.  This character goes thru hell and back & the story does reveal how many men survived those harsh conditions  which fortunately none of us today will ever have to endure...if we're lucky. So sit back in your easy chair, throw another log on the fire and count your blessings wherever you are that you're safe, warm  and out of harms way.",1469059200,3,961,4.178378378378379

7591448,2,B01A71FC90,"In this film we have disjointed nonsense hung upon the framework of adventure, something like a drunken housewife hanging laundry all akimbo upon a clothesline. Rarely, expect in B-movies, have I seen so many improbabilities and inconsistencies.

Hugh Glass, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is a scout for a fur trading expedition that ostensibly is organized like a military unit, expect that whenever there is a crisis, anywhere in this film, good military discipline does not prevail. This coincides with left-wing belief systems about the uselessness and ineptitude of anything military, so this worldview is presented to the audience and is nonsense.

Here is an example - central to the plot is the conflict between Glass and his antagonist John Fitzgerald (played by Tom Hardy) in which Hardy essentially blames Glass with being a dangerously (even treasonously) incompetent scout. Of course, this charge has to be false to maintain the hero status of the protagonist. In fact Glass's job IS security (and scouting) for the fur trading expedition. While he is away (within hearing distance of a rifle shot) hunting meat for the expedition, the expedition is attacked, and the majority of the party is killed. Straight-forward enough except that in the attack it is clear that the Indians have infiltrated into the treetops the night before, so Glass really is culpable of incompetence (or at least negligence). Later, as Glass leads the survivors of the massacre on an escape route, one morning he again goes out to scout, this time alone, and is almost mortally wounded by a bear. Anybody with any knowledge at all of basic military procedure (or common sense) would understand that for the key leader of the party to be out scouting alone in hostile territory when they know they are being pursued be enemies is ridiculous or utter incompetency. Oh yes, men do get mauled by bears but it becomes a bit more difficult for the bear when there are two or three armed men in the group than one. So really, Glass is an incompetent scout, but in this film he is the hero, and Fitzgerald is the deranged, despicable cad.

Then there is the whole business in this film about white race relations with Indians. In this film, everything the white man does to the Indian is bad,, but everything the Indian does to the white man, no matter how barbaric, is neutral at worst, since the white man allegedly deserves what he gets. For this reason, it is ""understandable"" when blacks kill white cops in our society today, because at the end of the day the cops allegedly deserve it.

In short this film serves up a confused mish-mash of politically correct vignettes in the framework of backwoods adventure.

And by the way, apparently in the 1820's nobody lived beyond 40 because everyone in this film is 40 years old or younger, much younger, even the senior commanders of the fur trading expedition. This film was targeted at the millennial generation who actually believes the nonsense this film serves up.

I gave the film two stars instead of one because the scene where  Leonardo DiCaprio gets mauled by a bear is fairly realistic (well done).",1468800000,,3140,4.879924953095685

With this historical background  I was able to appreciate the movie more than I think I would have otherwise.  Another short historic account of Hugh Glass from 1902 provides additional background on the events in the movie:

One interesting character introduced in this movie is Jim Bridger who was a young man in the movie. It seems Jim Bridger was to later become one of the greatest mountain men and a noted explorer---as can be read in these historic accounts of Bridger:

7591512,2,B01A71FC90,"All atmosphere. All digitally-enhanced cinematography, bing-bam-boom quick-cut editing and post production---everything that $135 million will buy. But...
No story.
No character development. Zero.
I have great respect for DiCaprio's work but all he had to do on this one is show up in the morning for makeup and walk through the scenes.
 But, the movie did have a nice digital-faux bear attack and the scenery was impressive. So, there's that.

This movie is very loosely (and lamely) based on the story of mountain man Hugh Glass, which was told in a more straightforward, interesting and coherent way, with more relatable human drama and impressive scenery, in the film ""Man in the Wilderness.""  Starring Richard Harris and John Huston (1971).

You'll find yourself asking, ""How much punishment can one man absorb?"" watching this. The engine of this drama is the parental bond -- whether it is the grizzly mama who attacks DiCaprio when she perceives him as a threat to her cubs; the Arikara warrior chieftain who confuses DiCaprio's hunting party with a French group of trappers who have kidnapped his daughter; or DiCaprio himself, who is driven by the spirit of revenge.

The British actor, Tom Hardy, plays a convincing frontier bad guy, driven by ruthless expediency to commit acts of pure evil.

7591638,5,B01A71FC90,"This is an incredibly bleak film. You will not be happy after seeing it. However, you will be astonished, awe-struck, and sublimely impressed with every bit of craftsmanship that created this brilliantly artful tale of human tragedy and struggle. It is a work of art in every way: a visual experience that is both subversive and overt in its being man-made while illustrating deeply personal truths about being human. ""Amelie"" is one of the best films ever made and speaks of humanity's spirit, so is ""Mary Poppins,"" so too is ""The Revenant."" Why compare these films? Because they are all profoundly beautiful and it must be recognized that even painful beauty can be made into must see cinema.

Alejandro Inarritu is a movie-making-madman-genius. Forget ""Bird Man,"" that was only a test. His stunningly nuanced and seemingly effortless style of continuous camera motion through multiple scenes is a new mode of story telling. Somehow every flow works to convey more detail than cuts could ever accomplish. His technique seems made from the medium of dreams, memory, and to-the-second experience of the now: permanent yet always fleeting. Ignoring the amazing performances, story and writing, the setting's landscape is perhaps the star of the show. Every texture is felt, every shot a moving landscape painting full of ambiance, mood and power. Earth is the crucible from which we came and it has always been the confinement within which we play out our lives. It is grand, and within the scope of this film, largely impervious to even the worst of life's struggles.

This is one of the best films ever made and possibly one of the most bitter, however, it transcends that pain to leave one with a deeper sensation and understanding more akin to revelation.",1468281600,16,1758,4.996587030716723

Leonardo was freaking awesome in his role, although a couple of times I wanted to scream because of a few stupid decisions.

This movie is about a journey of a man who was left for dead. A journey about staying alive and getting revenge on so many levels.

7591655,4,B01A71FC90,"I will not reiterate what everyone who has posted a 5-star review has said about this movie already. They are absolutely correct! So why on 4 stars?

The main character, Glass, had far too little dialogue and emotion concerning the deaths of his family. Moaning constantly in physical pain doesn't convey emotion. Staring off into the ether with a tortured expression isn't grief. That isn't to denigrate Dicaprio's performance....I'm sure he did exactly what he was Directed to do. However, the point of acting is to connect with the audience on a level they can understand and relate to. And I had a great deal of trouble relating to Glass as a character and no sense of connection with his supposed emotional state. Even up to the final scene I had no sense that he was actually ""feeling"" anything. The final scene could have been shot with a character who was a stranger to Glass and he only a hired gun to hunt him down---and nothing would have changed for me. I'm sure this puts me in the far, far minority but having recently lost two close family members back to back, I couldn't relate to the way Glass' character.

Tom Hardy Stole this movie! If anyone deserved an award, he did, not Dicaprio.",1468195200,2,1203,4.616822429906542

Yes I gave it four stars but only because of how beautifully made the film was not for the story line. While I enjoyed the chase, and the story of revenge for the loss of his son but there was just something missing in the story line. Tom Hardy is great a the villiain in this movie, but Hardy has already proven he can pull of both a villain and a hero in a movie already.  I guess, in the end I expected more but was just no that impressed with the movie. I will say that if you are looking for something similar then Jeremiah Johnson with Robert Redford is still a great movie to watch.

I have yet to read the true biography of Hugh Glass, and am given to understand that the real-life version of his response to the one betrayer he finally met up was quite different that the one portrayed in this film and would have made the actual film even better and more relevant to the Christmas season, around which time I believe it originally aired in theaters (which makes the real story of Mr. Glass even more astounding).",1467849600,,650,4.612068965517241

One review stated this movie is completely immersive which is laughable.  Completely immersive films don't rely on captions.  This is just a movie about some illiterates dragging a injured guy thru the wilderness then him dragging himself.

It is laughable that an trapper would put an uncocked flintlock in another trapper's face and threaten him with it.

In one scene, the head guy at the fort pays the trappers who return even though they have no pelts.  In a later scene the same head guy tells the same trapper that no one gets paid until the pelts are retrieved.  Whoever wrote this seems to think trapping was like a job like cashier at 7-11.

Why does Mr Revenant make a fire and camp on a riverbank where anyone can see him?  Why does he do it, almost get caught and killed by the Sioux and then do it again?",1467504000,9,965,4.406779661016949

We missed it when it was in theaters, but got to see it on our 60"" big screen. What an amazing movie. Even more so after I saw the documentary about how it was made. Leonardo DiCaprio was totally believable, no ""no pretty boy"" in this movie. I usually wait for movies to show up after they are ""free"" to watch, but this time (and with its competitor ""Spotlight"") we made exceptions. Two of the best movies ever, but ""Revenant"" was the big winner in my book. Be sure to see it full length and uncut - DO NOT wait for it to show up on free TV (if it ever does) or else you will surely want to kick yourself. By the way - actor Tom Hardy plays the ""villain"" to DiCaprio's ""hero"" - an amazing performance.

7591820,4,B01A71FC90,"In a way it is a film for nothing, except an Oscar for the main actor.

We are in Pawnee country some time in the 18th century, at the divide where the French and the English more or less meet. With the Indians in-between, around, behind and in front, at times under (a couple of feet under) or even over (from their horsebacks).

The French are trying to play it commercial and buy pelts and other Indian natural products but they cant always have their terms and at times are obliged to give some horses, even when the season is advanced and the horses are the guarantee to survive. Some will die.

The English are more in burning the Indian villages and looting whats left and evenkilling the survivors, even when there are none. Kill them twice for bood busqiness.

Add to this the fact that some Indians, especially those who have managed to get horses can become a real permanent pressure and an arrow is silent, efficacious and reloading is easy. Think of an arrow sniper in the trees.

Then you have the unhealthy, sick, vicious, criminal minds on the European sides. On the French and English sides they may consider an Indian woman is like a pet you take away without asking for permission. And the film widely shows how the English with their forts are rotten from the inside by the thieves, the immoral beings who take advantage of the frontier to realize the worst trends in their personalities: they can kill, rape, steal and many other things as much as they want.

This film is the fight to the finish between two such English pioneers, one being on the sinning side and the other on the punishing side. They call that vengeance, and vengeance;, as is well known, is always on Gods side, and sure enough the assassin, murderer, thief and a few other things, among them rapist, will be finished by the Indians who will pass on their horses leaving the good one to die in the snow since he is wounded and his horse, if it is still there, has been left behind several miles of deep snow away.

No salvation, no real vengeance. Just violence for the sake of surviving and for the pleasure of shedding blood. That shows the resilience and the viciousness of human beings. They love destroying, killing and a few other things like that.

Really a film for nothing, except an Oscar for the main character, oops! Sorry actor.

7591853,2,B01A71FC90,"This film might be worth watching, but only if you have absolutely nothing else to do for about three (long) hours. I am glad I didn't pay to watch it at the theater with teens behind me kicking my seat and chatting and giggling all through it, but even in the somber oak woods of my home theater ambience, I was almost - almost - bored. It's not that it isn't a finely crafted film (the bear attack scene is pretty good if you can hack the kind of screams and squeals that only L.D. is capable of emitting) but it's so predictable. In fact, the entire film is predictable. It is a composite of better films like, ""Jeremiah Johnson"", ""Kill Them All and Come Back Alone"", ""The Patriot"", etc.  It's a formulaic screenplay that copies dozens of screenplay's before it, and they always - always - turn out the same.... Bad man kills good man's son. Good man needs to overcome overwhelming odds and obstacles to take revenge on bad man who killed good man's son... I'm actually boring myself as I write this. To sum up, 1) not a bad way to spend 3 hours if you've nothing better to do, 2) the CGI is unforgiveably noticeable - especially the bear attack scene, 3) if there is ANY good reason that I can think of for you to watch this movie, it's because of Tom Hardy. First of all, you will never, ever know that the antagonist, ""Fitz"", is Tom Hardy - this guy is a phenomenal actor - but the screenplay is at fault; it's perfectly predictable and though Hardy does an outstanding job (an I do mean, OUTSTANDING JOB) with what he has to work with, the role he plays is nothing special. In summary, think, good guy vs. bad guy - with a sort of half-way decent bear attack scene in the beginning...",1467244800,2,1691,4.317610062893082

7591882,5,B01A71FC90,"This is a dark and brutal movie, but beautifully shot. The cinematography is simply stunning. I live in Montana so the beautiful scenery and brutal winters resonates with me. The winters here are hard enough in the modern world, I can only imagine how harsh and unforgiving it must have been back in the hey day of the fur trapper. This movie does a good job of transporting you back to time of the mountain man; a time when the land was untamed and only the strong survived. You can feel the frigid temps, and the impending doom of an indian attack. Though Leo doesn't really have much dialogue, he gives a strong performance as Hugh Glass, a man who comes back from the precipice of death, fuelled by vengeance and freaky surreal dreams of his dead wife and son. Tom Hardy gives an equally great performance as the despicable Fitzgerald, who murders Hugh Glass's son, and leaves Glass for dead after he is mauled by a grizzly. The bear attack was well done and very intense, as is the beginning sequence where they attacked by indians. Suspension of disbelief is definitely needed to enjoy this movie however, because Leo goes lives through some scenarios that would have surely killed him (like floating down an icy river or riding a horse over a cliff), but that is just a trifle easy to overlook. Overall, I found the movie to be very good, and better than most of the crap Hollywood puts out these days.

Overall a very enjoyable film",1467158400,,1440,4.55984555984556

Also, don't pull out your big brain and try to figure it out. There's nothing to figure out. The message of the movie is stated within the first five minutes and, if you forget, is repeated in the last few seconds--- survive.  The rest is spectacle and imagery. Suck up every minute of it.

7591991,1,B01A71FC90,"If you're fond of history, this film is not for you.  Hollywood has taken some names from the mountain man era, combined them with a nearly imperceptible whiff of an historical event and crafted a dark, violent fantasy/adventure/ordeal story.  Of course if you prefer a fantasy/adventure film thats on the dark side of dark, complete with a massive overdose of subtitles, this movie might just be your tub of buttered theater popcorn.  The film deserves ZERO stars for historical accuracy, and Ill reluctantly elevate it to 2 stars as a fantasy/adventure tale, splitting the difference for my overall 1 star rating.

If you decide to watch this film, youll soon hate (or at the very least, greatly despise) trapper John Fitzgerald, played by English actor Tom Hardy.  In spite of the negative feelings Hardys despicable character invites from the audience, hes clearly the standout player, mastering a Yankee accent and employing it to deliver more dialogue than any other member of the cast.

A far better fantasy/adventure/ordeal motion picture is the Tom Hanks classic, CASTAWAY.  But don't stop there.  Another excellent but not as well known fantasy/adventure/ordeal film is THE SNOW WALKER, inspired by acclaimed Canadian writer Farley Mowat's short story of the same name, and directed by Charles Martin Smith.

7592013,3,B01A71FC90,"Exquisite cinematography and acting. What a painfully wonderful recreation of the life of Indian wars and loss, and the triumph of pathetic and brutally immoral white self-aggrandizement. Unfortunately the film's overall statement has been done many times and much more originally or informatively (Dead Man, Black Robe, Fargo, Clearcut, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, Little Big Man -- and in novels, especially Leslie Marmon Silko's ""Ceremony"" & James Welch's ""Fools Crow""), so this story really should have had something more and it would have been a triumphant film. The father (DiCaprio) lives the blending of the two cultures, the only sensible and moral way to deal with the cultural clash, but the one way that we know never happened due to the Andrew Jackson way to be white. There's a moving father and son love and loss scene that says it all. Otherwise, there is no character development really (purposefully, one could argue), and the plot is so predictable that it's flat boring. (We've been told that only God should take revenge & we know that the canteen will show up, etc.) Happily, the filming of the gorgeous expansive and powerful wilderness fills that content void for pure filmic pleasure (and a poignant reminder of what more might be lost) and if you just want to appreciate the top-notch acting of DiCaprio in slow motion, the film will satisfy. If you want to watch a painfully realistic mauling of a human by an angry mother bear, wow.",1466812800,,1463,4.903225806451613

7592142,5,B01A71FC90,"Remember Lawrence of Arabia? Well, imagine a fresh update of the grand sweeping classic for a new generation of filmgoers. Except this one doesnt take place in the hot deserts of Arabia, but the brisk forests of North America. Its not as much about the story of a single man standing up to an entire rival army, but a single man as he survives in the wilderness for the safety of his own home. Also, the lack of a Hays Production Code today means that further opportunities are made to present the cinematic experience in gritty realism that only the toughest of the tough can sit through.

The journey starts in 1820s North America, where a group of White tribesmen hunt after a defenseless deer, until they hear of their tribe getting terrorized by a rival tribe of Natives. The leader of the hunters, Hugh Glass, played expectantly by Leonardo DiCaprio, fights to get his son away from the chaos of flying arrows and bloodcurdling cries. From there, he and his clan of huntsmen are out alone in the forest, in need to get home. That is, until Glass is mauled almost to death by a grizzly bear, and later abandoned by his own men. From there, its just him in critical condition fighting against the little resources available in the wilderness. It doesnt help either that his son had been murdered, leaving his temptation for revenge against the murderer in strong demand.

Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu, did not create something as innovative or as imaginative as the impressive Birdman, but what he does succeed at this time around is immersive visual storytelling. His usual cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, takes all the right turns in transporting the story into us with subtle yet effective techniques. Water and blood gets sprayed onto the camera lens, entire scenes last one continuous take with no edit cuts, the lens gets breathed on, and every single frame is worth posting on Pinterest. You could practically smell the cedar in the forest without the use of Smell-O-Vision. Irritu proves his power as a director by commanding the greatest out of both the visuals on screen as well as the realism of the actors. Seriously, check out more of his past work.

Similar to Birdman, The Revenant proved to be an extraordinary risk that was well worth taking. Wish the same could be said about the screenplay. Unlike the bird movies satirical take on our entertainment industry, this newer feature brims an over told message about the reality of revenge: is pursuing somebody out of vengeance really worth it? While the best stories ever told may have taught us this valuable lesson that could prevent all of our worlds problems, The Revenant does not add anything different or unique about the concept of revenge.

Honestly, this entire movie should have just been about Hugh Glasss survival in the wilderness after getting mauled by a bear. The other subplots between the people back at his tribe were not anywhere near as engaging nor as powerfully told as Glasss.

Yet the lacking power of the story really was the only fatal flaw in this otherwise perfect feature. Not once in the near three hour run time did I see Leo DiCaprio trying yet again to wow everybody. Instead, I saw a wounded man wandering through the wilderness as he suffers ungodly agony on his way back home. Everything DiCaprio did, from launching a bullet to gnashing his teeth to sparking a fire to eating a live fish to grunting the few words of dialog he had, went way beyond simple acting. The amount of physical and mental preparation that Leo went through to pull this role off never screams, Hey Oscars, remember me? Im the one who told Rose not to let go! But rather, Being an actor is hell; the preparation it takes to make the role real for yourself and the audience.

Caution beware: Alejandro shows us all what he learned from attending the Mel Gibson school of movie violence, that is, enough gore to constitute an NC-17 rating. Arrows are seen flying into mens foreheads, a dead horse gets its inner organs ripped out, fingers get chopped off, deep flesh wounds are revealed, ears get bitten off, and the main protagonist gets his flesh ripped clean off the muscle by a bear. So prepare to constantly be covering your eyes and going, ooh!

The Revenant will last as a classic piece of cinema that those of any knowledge of film can find significant value in. The casual comic book fanatic will get a kick out of the gritty action and tale of survival, and the greatest of cinema artists will be spellbound by its majestic cinematography, poetic visual language, and the performance of the century by Mr. DiCaprio. This should very well be Lawrence of Arabia for the 21st century!

7592158,4,B01A71FC90,A good heavy drama movie but a bit long and strained in some aspects. I don't know how a mountain man when attacked by a bear doesn't reach for his knife right away -- unrealistic ??,1466467200,,182,4.083333333333333
7592159,5,B01A71FC90,"Although I am giving this movie five stars - and it fully deserves that rating - I don't think I could ever watch it again. In fact, I'm not even sure I could recommend watching it to others, because it's actually kind of traumatic - a description I don't think I've ever applied to a movie before. Every aspect of this movie is stunning, particularly the cinematography, which uses very, very long, uncut sequences that put you right into the setting. In short, I sort of ""became"" the main character, Hugh Glass, instead of simply observing him.

Therefore, I felt his pain - of which there is a tremendous amount. During the now-infamous bear attach (not a spoiler, as it occurs early and is in the movie synopsis), I felt as if I was getting mauled and clawed and chewed upon. That scene is like five minutes long, and I think I might have held my breath for most of it! This is not a movie that is big on special effects, but the effects that do exist are absolutely stunning. At no time did I think ""that bear is pretty good CGI"", I was thinking ""that's a real bear!""

DiCaprio's performance is everything it's been hailed as - positively stunning and one for the ages, and Hardy is just as good. This is not a feel-good movie by any means, but it's quite possibly the most impressive one I've ever seen.",1466467200,,1309,4.404958677685951

Leonardo DiCaprio really did a great job portraying such an extreme character; fighting for his life after being attacked by a Grizzly bear and being left behind by his comrades, then turning around to seek revenge. This is a very graphic movie, not for kids, there's a lot of violence and graphic fights between the characters with graphic realistic views of fingers being chopped off, ears bitten off etc. Not for kids....not that they would most likely have the attention span to sit through the 2.5 hours of it all to begin with, but in case they come in and out of the room, the entire movie has scenes constantly throughout that are too much for a child.

Leonardo DiCaprio has done a ton of really good work in films, so Im still not necessarily sure that this was the one that should have earned him the Oscar, but that in no way should cheapen his performance in this movie.  He and Tom Hardy really did a wonderful job of delivering their character experience to the masses. I give it 4 stars only because I wasn't biggest fan of the gore, but otherwise a worthwhile watch.",1466121600,,679,4.330708661417323

It doesn't try to be realistic or plausible at all, but that just adds to the fun of it, I mean if you're not into a horse being turned into a sleeping bag for example, than this isn't the movie for you. Also that someone can just push there way out of frozen solid meat was laughable. The movie also ignores (or doesn't show you some things) like how a guy who can't move his legs got down from a cliff top to the river below, so you've got to live with that. You could rate it lower for these sort of things, but ultimately if a movie (and especially a slow one) can keep you glued to the screen for two and a half hours, how can you not rate it five stars?",1466035200,,806,4.012422360248447

I live out West, so I didn't really know if this was going to be like the LIam Neeson movie, which I thought was ok, BUT this blows it away.
You cannot believe how fast this movie sucks you into the story, and how many of the stories in the movie are true. It is very violent as was the Fur Trade in Canada between French, Different Tribes, and English.  This is a movie that is time well spent. I don't do spoilers-",1465776000,,593,4.221238938053097

7592525,4,B01A71FC90,"The Reverent is based on the true story of  Hugh Glass, a trapper and frontiersman in the wilderness of what is now parts of Montana and South Dakota.  The setting is the vast wilderness of this beautiful area in 1823 where Glass was hired to lead his friend  Captain Henry and several trappers through the vast and dangerous wilderness.  Glass brought his half Indian son along with him which alone brings  a lot of tension in the camp.  Glass is mauled by a grizzly bear and manages to survive, but barely.  Rather than stay with the group, Captain Henry offers to pay anyone who will stay with Glass and give him a proper burial if he should die.  Fitzgerald and a young man who is rather gullible agree to stay.  Fitzgerald hates Glass's son because of his heritage and tries to kill Glass not long after the Captain leaves with the other men.  Glass's son, Hawk, tries to call for help and Fitzgerald kills him and hides his body.  The two men abandon Glass in the wilderness and set out for the Fort with Glass's gun and equipment.  When they arrive, they inform Captain Henry that Glass died and that they gave him a proper burial.  The story follows Glass as he makes his way alone in the wilderness.  His thoughts of revenge against those who killed his son and left him to die is all that keeps him going.

The movie does a great job of capturing the amazing scenery and Leonardo DiCaprio, as Glass, does an amazing job of acting in this movie. Although, it was very interesting there were times when it was difficult to hear what the actors were saying and the movie seemed to go on an on. I do recommend the movie, however, because the acting and the scenery were enough of a reason to watch!",1465516800,4,1704,4.416666666666667

7592544,5,B01A71FC90,"A powerful film that defies the ""old Western"" genre of cowboys and Indians, such as ""Shane"" or ""The Treasure of Sierra Madre."" Leonardo DiCaprio is outstanding in this film in his roll as trapper and fur trader Hugh Glass, a real explorer in the 1830s fur trapping years when hundreds of adventurous men sought out opportunities to trap beavers and trade pelts. There are a few disturbing scenes, most notable is the grizzly bear attack on Hugh Glass, who had inadvertently come between Mama grizzly and her cubs. Left for dead by his comrades, Glass suffered severe wounds to his head, back, arms, and most every part of his body was shredded. The Revenant is ultimately about vengeance as Glass stumbles his way back to the nearest fort on the Missouri River, encountering wandering tribes of Native Americans, some of whom helped heal the wounded trapper.  Overall, the movie depicts a time when opportunists flooded the Missouri River to hunt beaver, and for many it was survival of the fittest. The trapping years anticipated the gold rush in the late 1840s and early 1850s. Glass's real target is John Fitzgerald who is among those who leave Glass for dead. Fitzgerald had promised $70 for each trapper to stay by Glass, though virtually all of the assigned to watch Glass eventually gave up and started digging a grave for Glass. Glass literally rises from the dead, and motivated by his resurrection he returns to Fort Bridger to kill Fitzgerald and exact his revenge.",1465516800,2,1476,4.857142857142857
7592545,4,B01A71FC90,"I absolutely love the cinematography, the story, all the characters, the music, and the editing. If you loved it in theaters, then you'll love it again on Blu-Ray. But for me, what makes a movie worth buying is not only the movie itself but the bonus features where this movie lacks a lot.

So don't be looking for extra goodies. If you're ready to simply buy this movie based on how much you liked or loved it, then that's the way to choose if you'll buy this or not.",1465516800,,468,4.258426966292135

I grew up watching similar films from the '60s & '70s that made more sense. (ie: Jeremiah Johnson (1970)) I even researched the main characters lives and got more out of snippet bios than this movie tried/failed to portray. I could spot all kinds of errors (ie: Glass breaking his ankle more than once in the film with it healing in a few scenes; wild animals native to other continents in America; incorrect animal attacks with wrong injuries) Ultimately the film is self-consciously bleak and unevenly paced. I honestly cannot see how it won the awards it did, let alone finally give DiCaprio an Oscar.

The flashbacks/spirit encounters were cliche and weak ones at that. The plot was average and the one ""twist"" I saw coming several seconds ahead of time. The nature scapes were phenomenal but that's basically the only thing I cared for in this film.

Unfortunately, that simply never happened. While the performances were captivating enough, there simply wasn't enough of a story to warrant the nearly three hour run time, and I found myself growing bored.

7592715,3,B01A71FC90,"While I do enjoy the acting style of Leonardo Dicaprio, I'm surprised that out of all of his Masterpiece films, this is the one that he finally received an Oscar for. While the film is filled with adventure, most of the film depicts Dicaprio (Hugh Glass in the movie) sitting around and groaning in agony after being attacked by a bear. It gets a bit repetitive. Was his acting good? Yes. Did the movie need to be almost 3 hours? Probably not. Was it worth watching; it depends... do you have three hours to kill? To be completely honest, I expected a bit more from the movie. Maybe a bit more of Dicaprio and a little less of him whining around in agony. WE GET IT. You got attacked by a bear!

Parts of the film were downright unrealistic as well. I mean, once you look past the whole getting attacked by a grizzly bear and living, many of the characters (including Dicaprio himself) swim in the icy cold waters of the uncharted (at the time) Dakotas and never once dry off their clothes or sit near a fire to regain their warmth. In short, If this movie were actually taking place, Dicaprio would have died very early into the movie.

I get it. It's a movie. However, I can't pretend some of those things didn't bother me! I think I expected a bit more from this movie.",1465257600,,1272,4.340336134453781

I thought Quinten Tarentino and the cast of The Hateful Eight was stronger than Leo and Tom Hardy in Revenant!!!  all in all worth the $5.99 to rent it, for sure was done well behind the cameras and in front,  a must see for sure but a little short with all the hype!!!",1465171200,,439,4.141176470588236

I did find it to be rather hard to watch in places.  It is very graphic, lots of blood and gore.  The acting, directing, location, etc. simply are unbeatable.

7592769,3,B01A71FC90,"The movie is at best 'good', actually its an average story, very linear.

The cinematography was commendable, mostly no background music gives it a special feel, bear scene is the creme of the movie and not Leo's acting. Leo was good, but nothing special like Wolf, Shutter, Beach, Django. The Oscar was, in my opinion, obligatory.

Getting back to the movie, after watching Bridge of Spies, Spotlight, The Big Short, I was counting on this one to be equally good, after all it was nominated at the same scale. To my disappointment it was quite boring and unimpressive.

Maybe if you watch with low expectations, you'll like it.",1465171200,2,628,4.796296296296297

Also DiCaprio's performance was outstanding.  His acting obviously carried the movie. The only thing I thought that wasn't believable was the supposed amount of time DiCaprio's character spent in freezing water.  I suppose a mountain man of that era could certainly tolerate that much longer than us tenderfoots of today, but hypothermia I suspect knows not the limits of time.  But this is me nitpicking.

7592864,5,B01A71FC90,"After being attacked by Indians the surviving trappers make a break for it on their boat, however the Indians wanting
the pelts the trappers were able to salvage for trading purposes will pursue.
The surviving trappers acting upon the advice of 'Hugh Glass' (Leonardo DiCaprio) abandon the boat relying on 'Hugh' s'
knowledge of the territory to continue the long trek back to the fort on-foot.
During a hunt for game to feed them 'Hugh' is attacked and savaged by a Bear, his injuries are severe....his son 'Hawk' (Forrest
Goodluck) along with the ruthless 'John Fitzgerald' (Tom Hardy) and the naive 'Jim Bridger' (Will Poulter) are left to care for
the near-to-death trapper.
'Fitzgerald' believes that killing 'Hugh' would be an act of mercy however, instead following, a turn of events 'Hugh' is abandoned
and left for dead.
Winter is closing in on the territory, barely able to get to his feet 'Hugh' crawls away from the shallow grave 'Fitzgerald' had placed
him in, his chances of survival carrying the crippling injuries inflicted by the Bear are virtually non existent, the pursuing Indians
(The Arikara) a further threat to his plight.
'Hugh' has a desperate desire to survive against the odds needing to exact revenge and serve justice on the man who had killed his
son and left himto die.
A chance meeting with 'Pawnee' refugee 'Hikuc' (Arthur Redcloud) who realizes that the badly injured stranger was no threat, offers
his help, his crude attention to 'Hugh's' wounds will make the difference between life and death for the trapper.
When the treacherous 'Fitzgerald' learns of the possibility that the man he'd left for dead could well be alive he'll have to make plans
to escape justice....but, 'Hugh Glass' will surely pursue.
The film depicting an incredible survival is a tense and often brutal affair, worthy of it's acclaim with an outstanding performance from
'Leonardo DiCaprio' coupled with a backdrop of stunning scenery....quite simply an absorbing watch and a 'must-see'

7592879,2,B01A71FC90,"Irritu would probably make a very talented photographer. If only he were even remotely interested in story, character, pace, or theme, all things that are pretty important to a functioning director. He knows how to put together a gorgeous looking movie using natural light and natural landscapes. While I think this is an awful movie, nature buffs should check it out anyway just for some of the finest nature photography you'll see this decade. And, you know, there's some decently bleak violence in this that should appeal to the survivalists. Just don't come into this expecting anything more than some nice cinematography, because there's nothing else here. Most of the movie is a dull rehash of the same basic ""everything goes wrong, Leo gets bodily punished"" scenario played with the most minor variations you can imagine - at 90 minutes, this would be a potentially interesting minimalist Western; at 156, it verges on torture - that eventually ends with a whimper that manages to simultaneously neuter the ending of the book completely while also making no sense whatsoever.

There is one undeniably great thing about this movie, though: Tom Hardy and Will Poulter's trek together. Whenever Poulter or Hardy are on screen, suddenly the movie comes alive, turning a grim survival tale that looks like an art school student's take on SAW into a beautifully acted, character driven period drama. The two of them do so much to salvage the lackluster pace, the stiff performance from Leo, and the shoddy editing, it's just a shame the whole movie wasn't about them. And made by someone else.",1464998400,5,1594,4.992481203007519

Man in the Wilderness is a 1971 American Revisionist Western film about a scout for a group of mountain men who are traversing the Northwestern United States during the 1820s. The scout is mauled by a bear and left to die by his companions. He survives and recuperates sufficiently to track his former comrades, forcing a confrontation over his abandonment. The story is loosely based on the life of Hugh Glass. It stars Richard Harris as Zachary Bass and John Huston as Captain Henry.[1]
The expedition in the movie is notable for bringing a large boat with them, borne on wheels.

7592948,5,B01A71FC90,"Where are the 3D movie releases?? Why?? Why??

This is not a review of movie content, plots, twists and spoilers. This can be viewed as an open letter to studios as a lament of the marketing decision to shelve the 3D format. I have seen 4K content, and additionally, I own a fabulous SUHD 65 and a great upscaling blu ray, 3d player. No doubt there some great reasons to support 4K, although there are many tepid reviews of native 4K content. I will say, for my enjoyment, there is no equal to a good 3D experience, the depth of field, the sheer feeling of participation, the sense of presence that cannot be rivaled in a 2D format. There are many movies out there that clearly advertise 3D IMAX in theaters, but no longer appear as a home video option. Additionally I have no intention of upgrading, yet again, my library as I have done since the early days of home theater. 4K is an alternate choice, not an upgrade and lacks the immersive experience of 3D. Now, as you all must know, 2016 HD TVs no longer even offer 3D. What the.???
Not all movies, not even a close majority can be available as 3D. I get it. But I have laid out a tide little sum of high definition equipment and upscaling capabilities and I feel a bit betrayed but this decision clearly motivated by money ( isn't it always) with pretty much no regard to the consumer, who has funded your companys all these years, and this is the thanks we fans can now expect. My contribution goes back many years and many dollars. (who remembers laser disc special editions going for $100? Thats right, $100.!! Fox led that charge, Alien, Aliens. How about the Rocky Horror VHS price years ago. Thank you Fox! But looking forward, I do not advocate the demise or removal of 4K and know it is here to stay, thats fine, but please reconsider this decision 2D will always be 2d, no matter what. I personally would rather feel transported into a 3D realm of presence, and would sacrifice the option of seeing more pores on someones face or more fibers on a suit or how much shinier Iron Mans paint can be in a 2D world. My fellow consumers, please show your support and chime to studios and distributors as I have done to keep this format alive. Dont think your opinion has no value! UNITE!
Thank you for your consideration and support.",1464912000,2,2290,4.42654028436019

7592998,3,B01A71FC90,"I was soooo looking forward to seeing this movie the first time I saw the previews online.  I was blown away and thought to myself, this is going to be a kick butt movie.  The angles, the lighting, the sheer harshness of the environment.

Then I watched it.  I wouldn't classify it as a outstanding movie nor would I consider it a bad movie.  Leo doesn't talk much in the film.  There are great action shots and the camera angles are sweet.  The overall story isn't bad so I won't do any spoilers or anything like that.

What I took from the movie the most was that that environment that they were at was VERY harsh.  I can't even imagine living back then as it seemed like just the sheer treck/living situation was stacked against you in a very large way.  Our forefathers had it rough and this movie made it seem like that was very very true.

Why this film got Leo his award, I'm not sure.  I can name other movies he's done that I think are far superior to this movie in everyway as far as him acting.  Tom Hardy has more talking parts and in a way if I didn't know I would think he was the main character.

You should see this movie but deep down perhaps I made it bigger than what it should have been due to the previews I watched.  It didn't wow me like what the previews did.",1464739200,,1283,4.137651821862348

7593000,5,B01A71FC90,"If Leonardo did not win an award for the Revenant I would have personally started a revolt for him as this movie was beyond amazing. Leonardo Dicaprio plays an amazing part out among the crew, Native IndIan's and mother nature. They are all potential threats to Leo and his well being.

One of the coolest things about this movie is the use of natural lighting throughout which is very difficult and most movies cannot afford to do this.
In this tough to watch movie our main character Leo goes through some pretty horrific ordeals and some how pushes through but the question is does he make it through it all?",1464739200,,611,4.554545454545455

This is something you just don't see (maybe go back to Kubrick's Barry Lyndon).  The best part is there is almost no CGI with the exception of the bear, for which we understand and it doesn't last long.  This is the way movies should be made.

Dicarpio: This may be his BEST acting yet. Very deep and emotional. His expressions were extremely convincing. Tom Hardy did a very good job too, but nothing compared to Leo. The best part was the ferocious bear scene. Dicarpio was stunning. The scenery was beautiful. Majestic.

It was intense, gripping, and action packed.  We thoroughly enjoyed the acting, cinematography, storyline, and the sound.

Here's my (very) simplified synopsis:
You think the Natives are going to kill him.
You think the bear is going to kill him.
You think being left to freeze is going to kill him.
You think the river is going to kill him.
You think the French are going to kill him.
You think the fall is going to kill him.
You think the illness is going to kill him.
You think the guy killed him.
You think he's going to get revenge but let's someone else kill the guy.

Amazing story of unpredictable and unfathomable survival. Smile. Bravo!",1464739200,5,744,4.571428571428571

I could have done without the ""Extra"" documentary railing on fossil fuel and it being a major contributor of global warming/climate change. It took 5 years to make this film and they stated that they had to leave Canada during the winter as there was a lack of snow and finish filing in Argentina. All the while they show tons of vehicles (some massive to hold cameras, back ground panels for lights, special effects (Green screens), ATV's cars and I'm sure they flew cast & crew to these locations over the 5 year. I guess they don't consider making a movie contributes to this ""climate change""  nor enlarged their ""carbon footprint"". I would have much rather seen how the movie was made and how some of the special effects (Spoiler alert: Grizzly attack) was accomplished.

The acting was not bad but I found Tom Hardy to be a better actor than Leo. If you have a short attention span or get bored easily, avoid watching this movie as there's a lot of scenes with characters traveling, not talking, and not doing much of anything at all.  So if you get bored easily, don't watch this movie as you'll probably wind up turning it off.

The natural scenery in the film was beautiful and a pleasure to see.  If I was rating only the scenery and cinematography I would give it five stars.

If you are looking for the true life story of Hugh Glass, look elsewhere as this is a made up Hollywood story.  There are way too many plot holes, the plot of the film was extremely predictable, and overall the story of the film is lacking.  It would have been extremely helpful had there been dates or text that explained what year it was, and the location of where the film took place for viewers who are unfamiliar with Hugh Glass and his life.

Couldn't remember where I'd heard the name Hugh Glass or why I knew what was coming next till after the movie was over and I looked up the book.

The only good performance was that of the bear, who did a  great job mauling DiCaprio. I can understand giving the bear an Oscar, but DiCaprio?",1464566400,,434,4.746666666666667

I find it strange that Leonardo DiCaprio won't the Oscar for this movie because this performance was lacking compared to some of his other roles. He is a great actor don't get me wrong but his performances in The Departed, Django Unchained and The Wolof of Wall Street were well past his performance here.

7593232,4,B01A71FC90,"Kind of like ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" without the humor. Seriously, this is non-stop intense and brutal. When I say that it lacks in humor, I mean completely. I don't think there is a single scene in this film that is lighthearted or causes anyone to chuckle. The cinematography does an excellent job of depicting the stark, immense and lonely lanscape. Leonardo di Caprio does an outstanding, superb acting job. It may be one of his finest performances ever.

Basically this is a film about survival and brutality, both on an individual level and also on a group level. It's about revenge. And it's also about the idea of kindness versus cruelty. you could even substitute ""surviving"" for ""cruelty"" because the two things are blurred in this film. I thought it was a very solid movie overall (you have to be able to stomach a lot of gore and death to enjoy the film). The only thing I didn't like about it was it took the angle of mysticizing the Indian experience, which is totally fine, except that when white people do it (Hollywood), it invariably comes across as being patronizing.",1464566400,,1098,4.630769230769231

7593309,5,B01A71FC90,"This film is as near to perfect as filmmaking can get.  From the strong directing and acting that drives the realistic nature of its core elements, to the breathtaking cinematography that poetically reveals the frightening beauty of natural landscapes alongside gritty portrayal of man in his most humbled form.

  Winner of three Academy Awards (Best Director, Alejandro Inarritu; Best Actor, Leonardo DiCaprio; Best Cinematography, Immanuel Lubezki) and nominee for twelve (including Best Picture, Best Makeup Design, and Best Visual Effects), featuring the well-known one-take bear attack, inspirational cinematography that is customary of ""Chivo"" Lubezki (Children of Men, Gravity, and Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)), and an underlying theme of the will to survive even in the most trying of circumstances, this is a must-watch cinematic experience like no other.

  Though there are five stars in my rating, I must give warning: this film is graphic in its depiction of life in the rugged West of the early nineteenth century.  Though no visuals are extreme over-the-top violence (in other words, ""gratifyingly grisly""); instead, every disturbing image is shown in a realistic manner to express the depravity of man.  Also, some language is present (as a warning to those bothered thereby).  The nudity is brief and not sensual.  One brief disturbing [] scene, cut short by a rescuer.

On a percentage scale, a 94%.",1464393600,6,1438,5.370535714285714

And then just who was the DUMBA$$ that thinks having the actor fog up the camera lens with his breath is riveting and or getting the fake blood to splash onto the lens in another scene, all that does it make you remember ITS JUST A MOVIE. Movies are supposed to draw you in, suspend reality, The reality here: DO NOT WASTE THE $$ renting or buying this turd. But I should've known, I don't think I've ever seen an Academy Award winning movie that lived up to the hype and this certainly was no exception.

There are mountains in South Dakota but no where near the Missouri River. Bear skins, like the one Hugh/Leonardo wears were worn with the fur in to insulate and the skin out to keep out the rain and snow. Poor Hugh/Leonardo wears it inside out for this movie. The bear attack is CG but really well done with the exception that when a bear attacks it will go for the neck and break it first. Being between a female and cubs will surely get the bear's and your attention. The Fitzgerald protagonist is just nasty enough in demeanor and voice that he is a great villain in the story.

I'm not knocking subtitles and I do enjoy movies that have other languages but just be aware that you'll have to do a lot of reading when watching this movie!

Overall I felt the first half was more exciting than the second half. I heard different responses from people that I know before I watched this movie. A lot of people said it was a good but boring movie. I think overall it was good but there were some ""boring"" parts. It's a long movie but it's intense at times too. I think it's funny that there were a couple British actors in this movie that were sporting American accents. In all honesty (I might get downvoted for this) I liked Tom Hardy's accent better than Leo's accent. I'm surprised Tom Hardy didn't win an Oscar because I felt his acting was actually better than Leo's but that's just my personal opinion. With that being said though I think the acting was great and I still don't know how they did the animal carcass scene when Leo went inside it to take shelter. I don't know how that was staged so that's pretty amazing prop design.",1464307200,,1310,4.282258064516129

The Bear scene was the only exciting scene for the most part and one other rape scene. Other than that this was two hours of dreadful boredom that left me wanting less! Movie left me entirely unsatisfied. When you see Leo on a playbill you already know that there are going to be high expectations and this movie did not cut the mustard.

From all the reviews that I had read, I had thought it would be more brooding and violent akin to No Country for Old Men or Quentin Tarantino movie. I also don't think this was Leonardo DiCaprio or Tom Hardy's best work. Honestly, I thought there would be more conversations and more in-depth at Leo's relationship to his son and wife.

Visually the movie is stunning and well-crafted but acting and lack of action and anger left me feeling underwhelmed. Definitely a rental.",1464048000,,528,4.67741935483871

Mr. DiCaprio did an admirable job, but the movie is essentially a dog. Predictable plot twists - the few that there are. Long drawn out pauses to try and establish a premise. About halfway through I lost focus began to contemplate repainting the walls of my den. I imagine it lost something translating from book to screenplay.",1464048000,,460,4.691358024691358

7593558,3,B01A71FC90,"I'll start by saying that the cinematography is incredible in this film, and if we were going by visuals alone, I'd give it 5 stars. What I found hard to follow was the plot line. Lots of important information is introduced to the viewer with the assumption they'll know what's going on, or if they don't, they'll catch on eventually. And I guess you do, however, this film would have benefitted from either some narration or some fade ins/outs denoting how much time has passed in the story. I realize this was a stylistic choice, and I can respect that while still thinking it takes a little bit of depth away from the rich and incredible true-life-to-film story of Hugh Glass.

The violence in this film was shocking, I thought it was WAY gorier than Game of Thrones or other known-to-show-violence films. I suppose they wanted to depict how tough life was back then for trappers, and they do a great job of it. At times, you're left wondering how in the heck Hugh Glass survived the bear attack when you can see his shoulder bone (?!) after the attack. Surely that would get infected to the point of death? Then again, that's why this story stands the test of time. It's just crazy he survived.

One more thing...my guy and I were joking that this could alternately be titled ""Hugh Glass: Worst Wilderness Guide, Ever."" And while misfortune fell upon him time upon time in this film, you just gotta ask yourself, why did he sign up for a job he's clearly bad at? Awww.

I just didn't get it. I appreciated the movie in all it's cinematographic glory and great shots and all that hooplah. I just didn't see how this performance was ""Oscar-level"", you know?

The movie was fine anyway - for me, it wasn't the best and certainly not the worst. It's just not a movie that I want to watch again, there's no lingering desire that I need more or that I need to fill in where I might have missed something while I was dosing off on more than one occasion. I don't think I'll be talking about the movie by the end of the year (I mean, I didn't talk about it 48 hours after seeing it). I don't even know if I've had a real conversation with someone outside of my house about the movie - it just didn't have a WOW factor that movies have - that captivating moment or moments where you're glued in. I didn't get that here. I'm sure other people connect closer to the movie but it just wasn't my thing, I suppose.

***Spoiler*** - lets be honest, bear attack would have most definitely killed him.  If it didn't his party would have dumped him and moved on - look how they just left people when they were fleeing the Indians in the beginning.  Then he most assuredly would have gotten frost bit.  And watch how often they have no problems wading or going into the various rivers - arctic cold, yet they keep getting wet like it's nothing.  And they would have starved or frozen to death 10 times over.  You couldn't get a quad torch cigar lighter to light under the conditions they were in, but they were able to start a fire by hand......riiiiiiiiiiight.

Definitely not a feel-good movie.  Every bit worthy a viewing though, but pretty difficult to watch all the pain.

I am loving this way of shooting now where the camera is not only right in there, but it follows in places you never expect they can.  You may find yourself wondering how they got some of these shots.  The camera seems to flow right along with the actors and much like Birdman, many appear to be one continuous shot.  But unlike Birdman, this one is awesome.  It has a story, a plot, absolutely gorgeous scenery and a journey of what life was like for trappers in the early 1800s.  Incredible!

7593597,4,B01A71FC90,"I was not familiar with Hugo Glass and didn't realize until after watching this movie that this was loosely based on events with Glass in the 1800s.  The movie did interest me in learning more about the Glass story.  The movie is beautifully done with some breathtaking wilderness scenery.  The filmmakers really do a good job at portraying both the beauty and harshness of the Pacific Northwest with a realistic feel of what life as a fur trader would have been at the time.  Leonardo Dicaprio is very good in his portrayal as Glass but to me Tom Hardy is brilliant in his role as Fitzgerald.  The story, although maybe not historically accurate, is well done and entertaining.  The graphic scenes have a realistic feel to them, especially the bear attack scene, which was one of the most realistic looking animal attacks I have seen in a movie.  The movie is a bit long to me though at nearly 2 hours and 40 minutes and there are some moments that are a bit slow paced and a bit drawn out that could have been shortened a bit.  The excellent story and great character acting by the two main leads more than makes up for the extended length of the film.  It was definitely a worthwhile and entertaining movie to watch.

7593604,1,B01A71FC90,"This movie starts out with the most ridiculous and unrealistic Indian fight for a movie reported to be a cut above the rest.  Men getting killed by arrows from what must certainly be too far a distance, considering that the people being shot at couldn't even see their attackers.  At one point a guy climbing onto a boat gets killed by an arrow and when the camera turns toward the Indians, there was clearly no one close enough to have shot the arrow.  Another Indian gets shot down from high up in a tree.  How did he get up there?  Clearly by a ladder behind the scenes.  And right in the middle of the camp of trappers, too.  And no one noticed him climbing?  It was not a realistic climb anyway unless the climber had superhuman strength.  Junk so far.  I skipped this in the movies but bought the DVD on impulse.  I'm only about 13 minutes into this movie and hating it.  Story first (and plausible!), special effects and action second.

About 50 minutes to go.  They should have named this movie, The Passion of the DiCaprio.  If you're going to make a movie about a real person, at least do honor to the memory of the individual by telling his/her story as faithfully as possible.  This movie is nothing more than inspired by a real event, but the movie itself is pure fiction.  The true story is lost to history, but this doesn't even mirror too well the story that history records.  So change the names and make your movie.  That aside, one could appreciate the movie on its own merits... if it's good.  Is it any good?  The answer here is... no.  It's not that good.  All awards should be returned.  As for Leonardo, this is barely acting.  You want acting, you should see the pained look on my face as I watch this.  No wait, that's not acting.",1463875200,,1756,4.375776397515528

7593617,4,B01A71FC90,"The movie's strengths: the Man versus Nature theme and nature's cruel indifference, the beautiful nature shots, the incredible natural lighting videography, the amazing action scenes in which you feel completely immersed, the superb acting by the entire cast (Di Caprio' brilliance is very much expected but Will Poulter, Forrest Goodluck and Tom Hardy also leave a lasting impression).

The movie's weaknesses: The revenge plot is almost corny and the end somewhat predictable, including the climactic high-noon face to face combat between the protagonist and the villain, some themes seem to be borrowed and deja-vu, attempts at symbolism are sometimes too obvious and pretentious, and lack of emotional impact due to undeveloped themes (compare for example Braveheart's wife mirage apparition with Glass's). Also, the plot at times seems to stretch the plausibility boundary: Glass survives a brutal Grizzly attack, swimming in freezing waters and a waterfall, an attack by an Indian tribe, an attack by French trappers, a fall from a cliff, and of course, hand to hand combat with the movie's villain.

All in all however, this is a movie well worth watching, despite its weaknesses. I should also put the disclaimer that it is not for the faint of heart, there are scenes that will turn your stomach if you are sensitive to gore, but hey, this is nature at its best and worst!",1463875200,,1381,5.133333333333334

This is a horribly graphic movie, and INCREDIBLY SLOW movie.  It was terrible, how this movie won an Academy Award is beyond me.  I know the subject matter was dark to begin with, but there was so much unnecessary violence and gore, not to mention an absurd amount of time wasted on him walking, his dreams and fighting.  I knew there would be fighting, but by the last fight I got up and started cleaning, came back and my husband said they are still fighting, it was the last fight scene with 2 men, not an epic battle, 2 men for 15 minutes.  Wait for this to come out on HBO, don't waste your money.  If you think ""oh it's  woman thing, she doesn't like gore"" I am going to tell you my husband disliked it just as much.  And if you're expecting much acting from Leonardo, not happening,  He dreams, he fights, he walks, he shoots, he walks, he fights, he dreams,  he walks, he shoots, he walks, It just goes on and on.  I've reviewed 2 movies on here in all these years, despite having rented over a hundred.  This one was terrible, and David and Goliath was the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life.

7593637,3,B01A71FC90,"From a personal standpoint, I found the movie to be way too long, slow and often times boring. It was very hard for me to stay focused throughout this drawn out movie.

Without divulging too much about the movie, there really is no happy ending to this movie. This is not a ""cheer me up"" kind of movie. It's often times very dark and very brutal.

The acting in the movie was superb and the graphics were extremely realistic. The movie encompassed many new tactics in obtaining stunning new angles and action shots. Overall, I would say that the cinematography was simply amazing.

This movie encompasses brutal scenes in which this Veteran had a hard time watching from time to time. Language is pretty strong and frequent. I would not advise this movie being shown to children.

7593690,5,B01A71FC90,"Finally sat down to watch this Oscar winner the other night and was really impressed with it. I've mentioned in other reviews that if you are going to have a movie where there isn't much dialogue then there'd better be some compelling scenes to watch...this movie shows exactly how to do that. There are large portions of this film where not a word is uttered but you can't stop watching the on-going struggles. Then of course you have characters too that really make you feel something. Tom Hardy plays a man that I found myself on the border of hating, I felt he was selfish and self-serving...and he is, but he's also someone trying to survive and make a living for himself in a very harsh environment.

As for Dicaprio, I know many may not agree with me but I can see why he finally won an Oscar for this performance and I feel he deserved it. Yes, there were other really good movies out there (some nominated, some not) but I do feel he did an outstanding job given the story, character, environment....and lack of dialogue. You saw so much and he said so little, not all actors can do that.

Ok...you may have heard about the bear scene, it's a really tough scene to watch! I found myself cringing due to the reality of it so of course...there's violence in this movie. It's man against nature and man against man....that's going to have violence and language, so if you have little ones save this movie for when they aren't around.

7593713,1,B01A71FC90,"3 hours of Leo giving birth to himself.
There is very little to like about this film. A few well staged fight scenes, but even they feel forced and gimmicky.
I'm at a loss understanding why Leo won for this, maybe it was just finally his time (seems strange to say with someone still young)? He usually has a lot more to work with, but here he is playing himself - Leo on a Dream-quest. Seriously 1/4 of the movie was dreams and hallucinations and they were as pedestrian and rote as the rest of the movie.
This was so much better when it was called Jeremiah Johnson. Redford and Pollack and Milius did it so much better 44 years ago. And that's not just a film snob saying all movies in the 70s are better. If this was exciting or even visually beautiful or well acted or anything really. it's just so mediocre.
This movie brought nothing new, to an now ancient premise. The new camera they used added nothing, in fact this is one of the flattest, no-depth westerns I have ever seen. Could be the transfer, could be whatever they did to it in the Digital Intermediate stage, but this movie looks like Terry Gilliam shot it during a frightening bout with depression, everything is low and wide angle and blue, providing none of the staggering Malick-esque landscapes/nature you were expecting. And at $135m could they not afford film? Hateful Eight was $54m and shot on 65m film. That looked great, not world changing, but definitely leagues better than this. I know it's unfair to focus so much on the look, movies are not just the look, but this was being touted as some great visual masterpiece AND if there is little else to focus on with such dirth of story, acting and actual activity, it should at least be visually interesting. Malick understands this, if you make your images really beautiful, people will put up with all amounts of filmmaking indulgence in other departments. The whole movie was missing something in every department, so it was impossible to really get into the film. It wouldn't let me in, no matter how close the camera was.
Everything about this film is unrelenting and not in a good way. The suffering is so long and intense it becomes ineffective pretty much ten minutes after it starts, so the rest is a slog. You then begin expecting a payoff for your attention and there is none. It then becomes comical by the end and since there is zero humor, it almost dips into Mystery Science Theatre camp. I mean with the amount of abuse Glass survives he should be the hardest MF ever and you want all the characters to recognize this, you want his character to get some recognition, for people to pay for doing this to him, but there is none. If this were a Clint Eastwood movie, oh lord the payoff would have been biblical.
Acting - Leo is good, but he has been so much better, in fact his drug-induced-country-club-escape scene from Wolf of Wall Street is better than his entire performance in this film, in fact that scene would be a great parody of this film. Hardy is so annoying in this with his new mumbly-voice-for every-role-actorly-affectations, I don't even want to see what he does next. For me, he has yet to live up to the promise of his incredible performance in Bronson. Gleeson is terrible as the only voice of reason, not believable in any way. Why they keep putting this guy from and center in movies is beyond me. He nearly ruined Ex Machina. He knows all the beats, but has no rhythm. He is always opposite much better actors and he is given roles that are way out of his range. The rest of the cast is okay, but they are merely scenery for Hardy to chew.
There is some shoddy CGI fauna here and it doesn't gel. it looks like they didn't plan it well enough or just decided to fix it in post. The Edge did bear attacks better, much much better. Although this definitely tries to win the ""okay just stop"" award.
So again, everything here you've seen before, scene after scene, done better elsewhere. Empire Strikes Back, Rob Roy, The Edge, Jeremiah Johnson, The Duelists.
I'm sure I'll get hating comments, but from the talent involved I was expecting so much more.
I think The Grey or The Edge are great companion pieces to this, showing how to properly do brutal survival in the wild stories, and those had Liams Neesons, and Sir Anthony Hopkins at the top of their game in them.",1463529600,5,4328,4.5006353240152475

It brought out the senses of taste, smell, and touch.  It also shows the multi layered characters in a complicated time.  It is relevant for modern era life just as it was then.  Tribe vs. tribe, man vs. man, man vs. beast, kill or die.  As a child this was my favorite era of American history to read about.  Walking off into the mountains with primitive tools, and making it.  It's a much different thing to watch a film like this in contrast to the bite of the cold in your bones, the cold heat of a knife through flesh, and the taste of blood and death.

7593798,5,B01A71FC90,"""The Revenant"" is an epic frontier art adventure film, directed by Alejandro G. Inarritu (2014's Birdman) and it loosely retells the story of fur trapper ""Hugh Glass"" ( and when I mean loosely I mean like at least 1 or 2 percent of the film is truth and the rest is just added for the film.) This movie is not for the faint of heart, it is hands down one of the most brutal, blood soaked films I have seen in a long time. What I loved this most about this film is the sense of utter hopelessness you get once glass,s journey home begins. Its incredibly bleak, incredibly dark and I love every moment of it (mostly). Since this is from the director of birdman there will a lot of art house style imagery most of which works very well  and if you've seen birdman a certain image from that film that makes an appearance which made think what is the relevance of that image? This is an incredibly haunting  film experience and its amazing! SEE IT.",1463184000,,943,4.292134831460674

7593857,4,B01A71FC90,"THE REVENANT is truly amazing and mesmerizing on all levels but it is also unnerving and difficult to watch through much of the film. It's totally beautiful on one hand and brutally realistic on the other. One thing is clear. Leonardo DiCaprio is one of America's finest actors who gives it his all-both physically and emotionally-to any role he takes on.  The Oscars for best actor and best director (Alejandro G. Inarritu) were well-deserved.

Inarritu became famous for putting his actors through treacherous conditions for realism and it shows. I was never clear exactly where the film was set but the conditions are harsh in a barren snow-filled landscape. The scenery itself is worth viewing the film. I only wish I had seen it on the big screen.

The story is based on the true story of Hugh Glass who survives a vicious bear and is left for dead by his companions. DiCaprio plays Glass and in this version it seems reasonable that the fur trappers have to leave him for dead or put him out of his misery humanely. Clearly, they can't help him and he won't survive. He is dying and  will only slow them down as they try to evade an outraged band of Native Americans. Glass' son is killed so Glass has every reason to survive and seek revenge.

It's a painful story to watch as DiCaprio is attacked by a bear and brutalized by humans. The pain is clear in his face, voice and body movements. It can be difficult to watch and it gets slow at times as DiCaprio drags himself across the frozen wasteland. It is a story of revenge and redemption. It's brutally ugly at times yet always hypnotically beautiful. THE REVENANT is a fascinating journey into filmmaking. It's more about the story than astonishing visual effects that are so popular now. It's not a family film or for the squeamish but definitely a film to see.",1462924800,4,1823,4.596923076923077

The film could have been shorter and we get the point that he's a survivor.  The story could have been much tighter and clearer without the need for confusing dream sequences.

If you want to tote that the cinematography was defeated by ""Hateful Eight"" then I think you need to go watch some more film and give a more refined critique other than babbling about nonsense you know nothing about. The film is honestly meant to be a reflection of humanity and brutality. Most of the fact that Leo doesn't speak is because he did something most actors have a hard time with. Characterization is more than just words. Its in the yes and the way we crook our mouths when our wives chastise us for something we know we should've done. It the way we let out that heavy sigh of remorse and hopelessness when we come to find a character was terminated from a job he's held for the last 20 years. In acting its the little things that count and help us to remember the beautiful and or haunting things represented in film. This movie did it perfectly and the music was absolutely chilling and so atmospheric that I couldn't help but cry at some of the scenes with the character and his dead boy as he was lying with him.

7593922,4,B01A71FC90,"Released in late 2015, The Revenant stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Hugh Glass, a man who in real life survives a mauling by a grizzly bear and makes his way crawling and stumbling 200 miles to Fort Kiowa, in South Dakota, after being abandoned without supplies or weapons by fellow explorers and fur traders during General Ashley's expedition of 1823. Vengeful, Glass then sets out to confront his trapping partners who left him to die. The movie's loosely based on these events, but the locations are far removed from the Missouri River area of South Dakota, which makes for a more scenic experience in light of the locations being spectacular.

The story was first made into a movie as 1971s Man in the Wilderness starring Richard Harris and John Huston. Whereas that movie has the better story The Revenant has the better filmmaking. Its not just that its a more expensive production with outstanding location shooting and quality actors, but also the modern filmmaking technique is superlative. If you like wilderness survival/adventure movies then The Revenant is a must. While the film runs over two and a half hours it kept my attention throughout and didn't seem that long. Its thoroughly realistic except that its marred by Road Runner-like sequences (youll know what I mean).

The film runs 156 minutes and was shot in Alberta, British Columbia, Montana, Arizona, Mexico and Argentina.

7593956,5,B01A71FC90,"This has become one of my very favorite movies and I have watched it four times.  ""The Revenant"" disserved every Oscar it won and probably more. The story is based on the true story of Hugh Glass, who is 1823, went on an expedition into uncharted territory with a group of fur trappers and was actually mauled by a bear, but apparently not to the extent that DiCaprio was in the movie. The difference was that the real Glass was not left behind to die alone in the snow and cold of a northern winter.

The movie is a wonder of excellent acting, cinematography, sound, directing, and DiCaprio tells his story without saying a whole lot throughout the movie.  It is a story of revenge and survival that is told so well by the wrting, co-production and direction of Alejandro G. Inarritu.  The first inkling for making the movie first surfaced with Inarritu in 2001, so it took a long time to finally get it made.  This film is a work of art that plays out in snow-filled, icy and uninhabited beautiful but sometimes deadly land, with Indian raids happening and the poignant  story of a lost Indian daughter.

Tom Hardy did an excellent job of acting, also.  His accent in the movie made me laugh every time I heard it at first.  This is a movie that shouldn't be missed.",1462492800,6,1268,4.454545454545454

7593986,2,B01A71FC90,"I do like Westerns, Historical Movies, Movies based on True Stories, Fiction and Science Fiction. I do not quite know where to put The Revenant, though. The movie is quite violent, bloody and gory. There are a lot of cliches, too.

SPOILER ALERT:  DiCaprio's character is a scout with a Native American son. He witnesses his son being assassinated, whiles in a totally immobile state.  Apparently 'seeking revenge' is keeping  DiCaprio's character alive, although I do not feel it (or is it just me?) He oh so miraculously seems to heal a little more every time he goes through new challenges! Every other normal human would have died already after the bear attack! I think it would have even been very tough to survive that specific attack, even with our modern medicine, and having been airlifted to a hospital right away! So, after having been mauled by a bear and buried alive and left for dead, he crawls all the way through the woods to a cliff, and without revealing how he does it, next thing you know he is by the river down below. - He gets torn away through the white water as Indians chase him, and although the water must be just above freezing, he manages to drift and swim for what seems a way too long time not to die of hypothermia! - When he miraculously makes it to the shore and gets out of the water, ta-da he can walk again!

During the movie he repeatedly dreams of how he lost his Native American wife due to an attack on their village and how he saved his son from a fire. The dreams are always slightly different. I wonder, did the movie makers want to show how much his son meant to him and what his dead wife wants him to do, with this? And  justify his revenge, show him which way to go?

There is a also brutal tribe of Indians, who are in search of the Chief's daughter, who had been taken. They shoot and slaughter everybody they encounter in their way. - DiCaprio's character happens to find that lady just when she is being raped by a French Soldier, by a tree, right then and there where he is about to steal a horse. He helps her and they both get away.  Not before she takes ""bloody revenge"" on the Frenchman, though.

DiCaprio's Character meets an older Native American man, who is also lost his family. He happens to know a lot about herbal medicine too,  and submits DiCaprio's character into a ""herbal sauna"". And ta-da, when he emerges after spending the night in that miracle sauna, he seems to be nearly totally healed! Like finding the first aid kit in a video game! - Before that nice new Native American Buddy is killed by some evil racist bastards (who might have been those evil French dudes), he mentions to DiCaprio ""Revenge is in God's Hands"" somewhere in an earlier scene. - These words become like the ""final cliche words"" of the film. - To me that seems so ridiculous, as these words are definitely not new to us, are they? Romans 12:19 (I usually never recite the Bible!) Here I just had to make a relation to the Bible. Really? What is the point of this story? So it becomes all new and mythical when a Native American, close to earth Healer-man says it? ""Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord"", ""Do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good."" That was not the message of this movie either, so what was it?

Hardly anybody in this movie, but one of the commanding officers in charge played by Domhnall Gleeson, who hired DiCaprio's character and his son ""Hawk"" as scouts in the beginning of the story, and the nice Native American Buddy, are humane or trustworthy! It is a very ""cold, wet, muddy"" and dark movie, without a real purpose or plot, at least in my eyes!",1462406400,2,3641,4.419402985074627

ORIGINAL: I love the movie. Thought it was amazing. 5 stars. But the packaging...
It came in a well packaged, letter-size, paper holder. No complaints there!
My 4 star gripe comes from the fact that the disc case (the blue plastic bit) came without a sleeve. I know that's a dumb thing to get annoyed about, but the picture looks like the blu-ray should come with a case sleeve and it doesn't. I like my disc cases to look pretty and it doesn't. It looks naked. I mean if I didn't care about how it looked then I would buy the digital version of the movie or just stream it. I buy the blu-rays because I'm slightly old school and I like the discs. The case just looks funny without a sleeve.
So, if you want a case sleeve with this movie, buy it somewhere else. If you just want the disc inside the case, buy it here off Amazon.
Rant over.
Now that's said, I'm keeping the movie. Nothinng wrong with the disc or the case. Just doesn't look as nice as I would like it too.

7594057,5,B01A71FC90,"It seems to me lately that the best movies I've watched have been based on really great books. Such is the case with Director Alejandro G. Irritu's award winning film The Revenant. (Based on Michael Punke's book) I always try to read the book first and then watch the movie. The book was fantastic and I hoped the movie would be as well.

The Revenant on Blu-ray and Digital HD is newly released from Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment.

And my hopes that the movie would be good were met and far exceeded. Leonardo DiCaprio won an Academy and Oscar Award for Best Actor. The film won numerous other prizes.

DiCaprio portrays Hugh Glass, a frontiersman/tracker in 1823 America with a fur company, who is severely mauled by a bear. With both winter and hostile natives on their heels, the company commander assigns two men, Fitzpatrick and Bridger to stay with Glass until he dies, bury him and then catch up with the rest of the company. Also with Glass is his son Hawk, who is sure his father can survive. Seemingly close to death, everyone figures it won't be long 'til the end.

Fitzpatrick, played by Tom Hardy, decides that he doesn't want to wait around for Glass to die and instead chooses to leave him on his own. Hardy brilliantly interprets the despicable character of Fitzpatrick. I don't know how many times I yelled at the screen.

But it is Leo who steals the show. He has very little dialogue, but his physical acting and his facial expressions (especially his eyes) transmit so much more than words could have. His courage, grit, perseverance and determination to hunt down Fitzpatrick becomes the viewer's goal as well.

Not far behind Leo is the cinematography - the backdrops are simply spectacular - the choice of actual settings instead of green screens brings the wildness and wilderness of the time and place to life. Costuming and physical props are just as believable. The bear attack is also really believable. (and a bit hard to watch)

Irritu has changed some of the events from the book - most notably, Glass's reason for revenge. But it works. This reason is more personal and will have the audience even more invested in Glass's drive for revenge. With every tortured step and obstacle thrown in his way, I was urging him forward, just as determined that he have his retribution. Irritu has also changed the ending from the book. It wasn't what I expected and I watched it two or three times. In the end, it seemed right and fit with the 'extra' character(s) that he had brought to his version of the story.

Brutal and brilliant, The Revenant is a welcome addition to my film library.",1462147200,,2623,4.674620390455531

The movie's star [Leo] does... he got his profession's top award for his performance, here.
This film is BEST enjoyed on the big-screen... theatrically, or, on---at least---a home theater's 55""
screen [with a good surround-sound system].
My wife winced in all the right places. When she covered her face, during the bear attack, I told
her the CGI F/X was m-u-c-h better than that critter-flick Leo was in in the late '80s. I digress...
The film was excellent. If you feel that Global Warming is ""h-o-o-e-y', you'll want to skip the 45-
minute, bonus featurette, making-of----it's STILL snowing where I live, so----the fact this movie
had to be finished in Argentina due to a lack of snow is as interesting, to ME, as the 18-ski-lifts

On the plus side it is visually stunning with beautiful cinematography and Dicaprio is his usual excellent self.  That being said, there is much in this movie that defies all credibility so viewers really need to check their logic at the door to get through it.

For example, it's a good thing hypothermia and frostbite didn't exist back in the day with all the slogging around in ice water that goes on in this film.  Or, how falling off a hundred foot cliff doesn't even produce a single broken bone.

There are serious continuity lapses as well.  DiCaprio's right leg that he is dragging while crawling becomes his good leg when he begins to walk.  Oversights like this can really challenge a viewer's sensibilities.

Despite its flaws it's worth a look but know going in there are several reasons why this film didn't deserve or receive the Best Picture Oscar.",1462060800,,931,4.703703703703703

Pros
+Leo was the main character
+Nice film location
+Bear fight looked pretty real

Cons
-Way too long, for no reason. (Cut it by 60 minutes and would have been much better pacing)
-Tom Hardy (Seriously how does this guy keep getting film roles??!)
-Bear fight was filmed kinda like a rape scene, very strange (But then again, maybe thats how it is when you get attacked by a bear)
-No rewatch value
-Boring, very boring
-Bad Ending (The very last few seconds of the movie)

Long story short.....watch THE EDGE. Much better film, Real bear and real acting. Dont get me wrong, Leo is an amazing actor but in this film it required non of his talent.

Both were 'based on' the events in the life of Hugh Glass, so variations can be expected and are acceptable, but in the film there is far too much variation - the beginning, the middle and the end of the movie are completely different than the actual story. By giving Glass an Indian wife and son, both non-existent in the book, the whole impetus for his revenge is morphed as if being left helpless in winter without the very basic means for survival wasn't enough for him to seek revenge. I also found the made-up visitations by his dead wife in the movie to be eyerolling and very Hollywood; ditto his rapid healing from such grievous injuries in the movie belittles what he actually endured, such as crawling for a portion of 350 miles before reaching Fort Atkinson, and eliminated completely the life-saving medical help to heal infection given to him by one band of Indians, in the movie represented by a single Indian and some crumpled dry grass applied to his wounds.

The violence is right in your face, and the viewer gets an excellent look at what life may have been like during the early part of the 19th Century.  The beauty of the locations were breathtaking to behold.  It could make you forget just how unforgiving and grueling nature can sometimes be.

I'm not going into details about the story.  Everyone should pretty much know the premise of the movie by now.  I will say that Leonardo DiCaprio definitely deserved his Academy Award for his role.  Another actor who also gives a performance that's worthy of an Oscar is Tom Hardy.  Next time bury Leo deeper in the shallow grave and the Academy Award might be yours.

I have to mention that the sequence where Leo is attacked by a grizzly bear blew me away.  I haven't watched the Extras on the disc yet, but I have to assume most of the sequence was an intricately designed special effect with a green screen.

7594156,1,B01A71FC90,"Boring. Other than the opening few minutes, most of the movie was slow, very slow and boring and predictable. You keep waiting for the tension to build but it never does. The ending is anticlimactic. There are a lot of parts of the movie that simply do not make sense such as Glass being a supposed great tracker who cannot even find someone walking on fresh snow! There are more similar incidents.
Then there are the parts that require suspending any kind of reality, like nobody getting frostbite?
Then there are the background sounds which seriously detract from trying to follow the movie. Sounds like gunshots where there are none, whistling sounds for no reason and more.
Then there is the supposed father's love for his son which simply did not come across although there were obvious attempts to make it so.
Overall, not a very enjoyable movie and the three of us that watched this movie, concurred.",1461801600,3,907,4.746835443037975

I believe the movies are getting to be geared more the so called TRUE STORY gender....with a lot of fluff to keep us entertained, but this one is pretty close to the book and who knows how close that is?  It is an extreme story of endurance and physical and emotional pain....or emotional pain and extreme physical endurance.....hmmmm.....either way it is pretty good for those that like the underdog overcomes the devil and good always wins. or something like that......",1461801600,3,548,4.768421052631579

7594168,5,B01A71FC90,"The Blu Ray presentation of The Revenant is top notch. It may be somewhat light on extra features but the picture and sound are absolutely breathtaking.

When I saw the film in the theater, I sat a little too close to the screen due to our party arriving late so I wasn't really able to take in just how gorgeous the cinematography actually was. Watching this on Blu Ray now, the picture is pretty much pitch perfect, with the reproduction of the visuals a sight to behold. Say what you want about the film but you absolutely cannot knock the film for its looks. This is one beautifully shot film.

The DTS-HD MA 7.1 sound mix is equally impressive, foregoing a more gimmicky presentation for one of quiet, natural ambiance and intelligently employed surround usage. The speakers are constantly active and quite frequently, you'll hear sounds panning across the entire soundstage, with dialogue and effects circling repeatedly throughout your speakers. The sound mix is detailed and nuanced, with a lot going on most of the time but never feeling cheap.

There's a nice little behind the scene featurette detailing Inarritu's vision and reasons for making the film and a still gallery rounding out the disc. If you enjoyed the film, I can't see why you wouldn't appreciate this disc as it's a fine production.",1461801600,,1309,4.834821428571429

My expectations were out of line with the reality of this beautifully filmed, but an otherwise just awful film. It was also unrealistic, while apparently striving for plausibility. The survival of the DiCaprio character was impossible... Also found the deep south accent of the villain mostly so muddled that it was hard to understand what the hell he was saying (mumbling). For example, I was surprised too by the guns. The main character, on two occasions, fired an ancient single shot pistol with unreal accuracy and without re-loading!... There was no message either, other than perhaps a recognition from the viewer that life was cruel and miserable for everyone in this movie.

I only saw it on a small tablet on a long airplane flight , I can only imagine how much more majestic and beautiful the shots would appear on a large screen. High marks for the combination of visual beauty/cinematography, as well as character development. I have not read the book, but plan to do so after reading one of the reviews on Amazon.  It was apparently not close to the actual story line, but nevertheless the movie has great merit.",1461542400,,837,4.52317880794702

7594250,5,B01A71FC90,"The Revenant tells the (loosely) true story of Hugh Glass, a fur trapper who's life takes a tragic turn in the blistering winter of the 1820s.

Your best bet going in to this one is to go in blind from spoilers and with a true appreciation for film making. A slow and brutal rollercoaster of bleak and raw emotion, the mainstream crowd will most likely find The Revenant ""boring"". However, if you salivate at nearly impossibly grandiose shots, masterful performances that pick at your heart one scene at a time, a thunderous and moving score and basically every element that makes a film worth owning and watching for the rest of your life, then you'll LOVE this one.

Everyone does a wonderful job here, DiCaprio and Hardy taking center stage. The long takes with entirely NATURAL LIGHTING are awe inspiring. The struggle of man before merciless nature is thought provoking beyond recognition. Simply put, if you haven't seen The Revenant yet, do so immediately in the best quality available (blu-ray duh!) and on the biggest screen you're able to find. I guarantee that, even if it's a bit slow for some, you'll find many a thing to appreciate here. Quite possibly my favorite film of all time currently.",1461542400,2,1206,4.793269230769231

7594279,3,B01A71FC90,"Sound was excellent as was the transfer of the film footage.  I had pre-ordered it and was thrilled that it arrived on time.

My next comment is about the movie itself, which I had not seen before.  If you plan on watching this as a semi-documentary, you can give that up now. While it was an amazing and heartbreaking story, it was even more heartbreaking to learn that the important part of the story, his deceased wife and his son, was not part of the true story.  I was also disappointed that they did not go further into his life following this incident.  It also did not make the time frame clear as to how long it took him to get back to the fort.

I was also disappointed in the documentary that  came with it.  It was interesting and timely, but had nothing to do with the story and the movie.  It focused on how horribly native Americans have been treated and on how climate change is affecting our world.  It did not focus on the making of the movie including how they created the real life  attack by the bear or the other special effects.

If you have already seen the movie, in the theater, and have been eager to see it on DVD, the cost is reasonable, so go for it.

If you have not already seen the movie and are thinking of buying it, I suggest you wait, see it when it comes on tv, then if you want to purchase it maybe they will have extras in the next dvd issue.",1461456000,,1382,4.150375939849624

Apparently, the legend of Hugh Glass, a survivor of a grizzly bear attack who managed to survive in the wilderness driven by revenge against those who abandoned him, wasn't good enough for the filmmakers. They had to take it to extremes that were truly not believable. Native American portrayals were two-dimensional. There is so much to Native American culture than that which is depicted here; more ""cowboys and Indians,"" more ""good guys and bad guys.""

7594341,3,B01A71FC90,Great moments.  Breathtaking Cinematography.  Deviates from historical accuracy about 2/3 of the way through in the cause of storytelling which I can forgive but the story was... average.  (Spoiler). Grizzly bear attack was awesome.  Some explicitness (rape).,1461369600,,259,5.918918918918919

7594344,3,B01A71FC90,"I was excited to see this movie, knowing it was based on the same story that the 1971 version ""Man in the Wilderness"" depicted, which starred Richard Harris, the survival story of a fur trapper in the 1820's who was mauled by a bear and left for dead.  Adding to my excitement was Leonardo DiCaprio playing the lead role.  It was extremely disappointing, right from the first scene of the movie.

The opening scene was ridiculously unreal.  It showed two trappers hunting an elk in a forest with large trees flooded with water.  Anyone who lives in a mountainous forested area (like me) knows there is no such thing as a forest of big trees growing out of expansive clear water that's flowing like a river.  In addition, any hunter will tell you that elk would not hang out in such a place.  It was such a fake scene, it was laughable.  There was no such scene in the original.

My second disappointment was it's depiction of Native Americans as violent, brutal enemies, in comparison to the ""Man in the Wilderness"" where Richard Harris was given a blessing by an Indian Chief when he was discovered lying on the ground after the mauling, then given respect by that Indian Chief later in the movie after he saw that he survived the mauling and was doing well.

My last disappointment was that Leonardo's character was married to an Indian woman, and had a grown son by her.  In M in W, he left a white pregnant wife to spend months away trapping for furs.  The Revenant was an extremely violent film, and I stopped watching it 2/3 of the way through it.

This movie doesn't compare to the ""Man in the Wilderness"", a much more realistic survival story, one of my favorite classics even though it was a B-rated film.  If you are expecting The Revenant to be the same story as M in the W, you will be sorely disappointed.  The story line was totally different, and was very weak.  I don't know why it received any academy awards at all.",1461369600,,1933,4.464387464387465

He gets his horse to go charging off a cliff into this very huge tall tree & the horse is dead which he should be & not a scratch on DiCaprio, more magic. The last thing to say is the movie was way too artistic & not down to earth enough for me. Sitting home & watching a movie that should be two hours long not two & a half or more is one thing but sitting in a theater & watching all this s*** he is imagining is boring. I liked the original with Richard Harris. Shorter & more to the point. The revenant was beautifully shot & the action & acting was good.

I found it to be too dismally gloomy and the violence too chilling & unrelenting to be that enjoyable. Vicious attacks by nature, animal, and human-against-human are disturbing to those sensitive to it--such as children--so be warned. But the acting was indeed superb. Tom Hardy as the villain was my favorite - amazing - as he dances that line between evil, mercenary, and just plain 'I-been-in-these-here-mountains-too-long' craziness; a man who has forgotten his humanity and lives without remorse. Dicaprio didn't impress me as much, but he grinds through this long survival story to win his Oscar, at last. The movie was shot in natural light only, in winter, which colors everything an icy gray. Don't expect a happy story or a just one--or that it is exactly chronicling ""history"" either. This is the Old West at its most brutal in storytelling.

The problem with the movie is that is was so one dimensional and not very believable.  Let's face it a guy gets shot, mauled by a bear, beaten up constantly and falls of a cliff and like Energizer bunny on steroids just keeps going.  My wife stopped watching it about halfway through and was not happy for me for choosing to watch it.",1461283200,4,654,4.46218487394958

Many months and hundreds of miles later he came walking out of the woods so this script isn't that far fetched on that point.  The guy in this movie goes through Indian attacks, a bear mauling, surviving in the winter in the mountains with no weapon or supplies, a run in with some not so good French guys, and a final, bloody knife, hatchet, gun fight.  Whew, five men couldn't survive all that in real life.  The bear attack was well done and looked real to me so you be the judge if you have children as to whether they should watch this.  The acting is as good as it gets by everybody, not just DiCaprio.

The story is great, it's intense, the cinematography is fantastic and beautiful.  It's probably one of the best 'winter' movies I know of today.  Hardy is believable, as a 'bad guy' and his performance is so finely honed, you  forget it's Hardy.  Leonardo does a fantastic job capturing the emotion and tragedy he's endured then, and in his previous life.
The portrayal of the Native American's;  their life, and their love for family/tribe/culture was very well done as well.",1461283200,,703,4.721311475409836

The awards are fully justified, Dicaprio's acting was indeed excellent as was the direction. The scenery and  costumes were excellent and period correct. Some of the special effects were extraordinary, others just so so. My big issue with this movie was the Audio and Dialogue. Had it not been for the sub titles at the beginning, i would have had no clue what was happening to whom and why. When the subs dropped off, the English dialogue was at best awful, and at worst totally unintelligible. Whether or not this was by design or other reason, i do not know. In fairness, i did not go to a theater but rather bought the digital copy through Amazon. That being said, i watched on a 42"" 1080 p TV with an  above average 5.1 surround system. i estimate i missed almost 50% of the dialogue.

Finally something out of tinsel town that's just a plain old great movie that has a script, acting and directing and not a single explosion, no wise cracking characters that go from blowing up buildings to blowing ...Women that somehow manage to always have a gun with them even if she's wearing only a thong, or men treating women like dudes. There's good camera action not the kind that makes me nauseous and a good story line in a classic Redford or Eastwood westerns and I was impressed that there were a couple scenes that Hollywood usually makes a gory mess but this film knows adults can do the math of what a person would look like if a blah blah happened to him but it's not candyfied either.
I don't think I've Ever actually bought a movie but I'm glad I have it in my library now.",1461283200,6,821,4.337662337662338
7594562,1,B01A71FC90,"This movie had great cinematography but plot, fake horses, and political innuendos made it a long and hard movie to watch.... Yay for Leo but this isn't the movie I would've awarded him for.",1461283200,,190,4.617647058823529
7594563,5,B01A71FC90,"Inarritu's films are all great and I was looking forward to seeing what The Revenant would be like; with DiCaprio's presence it seemed it might promise to be more 'Hollywoody'. Amores Perros, Babel and Biutiful, for instance, are all strong films about today's culture, looking at how people fit in with the modern world, within whatever narrative Inarritu chooses (global themes). His films withstand analysis on many levels, symbolic, ethical, individual versus the world etc, and are always riveting, but not always easy to watch. I remember Amores Perros opening with its dog fights, I did feel like not watching the film, but those dog scenes at the beginning are critical to the films structure as dogs run throughout the film and it's interesting to later see how Inarritu uses dogs' 'characters' to link in with the human stories.

The Revenant is different in this respect, its 'depth' isn't in a complex narrative, and that is to the film's credit - it's rawer, more in-your-face. Where the other films looked at man in the modern world, this one goes back a bit, and due to what happens in the story, throws Leonardo into the wild - a chance to bear witness to Man's direct strugle with Nature. The result is a beautiful film that makes stark comment on life and what it means to be alive.

The film is deliberately brutal, but at the same time doesn't miss the beauty. It often feels apocalyptic in the sense of 'final destruction', and I guess with the Revenant title that destruction is what is being examined. To concentrate this in two hours of film is, in a way, unnatural, so for me it doesn't properly reflect Nature. I don't believe Nature is as unredemptive as the film pretends (it can also be eternal, dull, light / dark, perfect - it's many things). That said, the film is great in the way it enables you to question this point and possibly disagree with 'on est tous des sauvages'. In fact art is often an attempt to escape savagery, where others would counter art is artifice, I would suggest art signifies something very real . . .

Somebody mentioned in another review there is a lot of mumbling. That is true of the very beginning of the film - it's one of my pet hates that with certain films you can't hear the dialogue properly, it can ruin a film. Thankfully with this film it was OK. It might have been intentional to represent the chaos of battle - that you wouldn't necessarily hear / perceive every detail. It's also done in a later scene when there is some Pawnee prayer or poem (I think) in the background of a storm.",1461283200,,2556,4.588621444201313

Turn the movie on don't just watch it,but truly absorb the contents of this visual experience. You should not seek instant or rushed gratification; allow your self to become part of the experience and when you have allowed your self to escape your present day to day life happenings time willn't matter . When you are done absorbing the contents of this DVD (the feature film and extras), you should be left with a sense of sadness due to the things lost and what we are losing;consequently,there should also be a sense of shame, because of how we treat each other ,what we are allowing to happen to the only planet we have and the inhabitants on it.

But I have grown to learn that for many different reasons such as time constraints I have learned to be less critical.  We may never know the actual details of many tales coming from the old west gunfighters & especially tales of the reclusive mountain men.  This is because the more civilized east coast printing presses had a tendency to glorify the truth to sensationalism for sales reasons.  The tales of men like ""Jeremiah Johnson"", "" John Colter"" & "" Hugh Glass"" have been retold so many times that they come to us far removed from the few reclusive men who may have had a more accurate account of the truth!  That being said I just have to enjoy this wonderful period piece for what it offers.  I have seen very low reviews based on Hugh Glasses"" remarkable recovery saying that could never happen!!!  This is far from  the truth you cannot place your own mental & physical limitations on other humans.  I myself walked away from a car accident with a broken neck & my back broke in 2 places as well as both femur heads being fractured.  I have heard of another man who broke both legs & a Arm as well as having many superficial cuts climb out of a cave with nothing but a Bic Lighter!!!  Not only that but they never tell you precisely how long it took Hugh Glass to gain mobility!!!  The cinematography in this movie is spectacular as well as the sets & costume pieces right down to the language.  This movie is a thrill ride of action & adventure & a wonderful addition to anyone's movie library as there seems to be a lack of ""Mountain Man"" type movies.  As far as acting its great but Leonardo DiCaprio  certainly showcased is acting range & ability far better in ""The Aviator"" portraying the reclusive millionaire Howard Hugh's.

The (Oscar-nominated) costume design by Jacqueline West is brilliant. The (Oscar-nominated) make-up effects by Duncan Jarman & Sian Grigg is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by Mark Vanselow, Doug Coleman, Scott J. Ateah & Brian Machleit and fights coordinated by Adam Hart is brilliant. The special effects coordinated by Steve Riley, Stewart Bradley, Pau Costa, Eduardo Puga & P. David Benediktson and supervised by Ante Dugandzic, John Rosengrant & Cameron Waldbauer is brilliant. The creature effects supervised by Mark Rappaport are brilliant. The (Oscar-nominated) visual effects coordinated by Ashley Manning, Shandy Lashley, Tyler A.

7594626,2,B01A71FC90,"there are several reasons why i don't like this movie

1. it's a waste of a movie for about 2 and a half hours
when he has to put up with one of the most annoying actors that is in mad max, Tom hardy
  at least dicaprio could have done a lot better in this movie had he had been teamed with liam neeson
so that the audience would listen to neeson a lot more than the really annoying tom hardy
who to some degree, kinda sounds like a mix of the hogwarts student that tom felton plays in harry potter, draco malfoy
and that really annoying bro to thor in the marvel movies, loki, played by tom hiddleston

2. expectations

my expectations for this film were was that it should have been rated at least a PG-13
Cause most movies that leo usually gets involved are decent enough to be viewable
but this movie not only is disrespectful of the kinds of performances that he has done in the past that has earned this oscar , but he shouldn't have won the oscar in the first place, he could have just earned the oscar for some of his earlier movies and said ""dude, this current movie is not as good as like say ""titanic"" or ""the man with the iron mask"" those movies should have earned him a decent oscar
but this movie is in that same catagory as daniel day lewis's awful performance in there will be blood
the kind where it is totally unwatachable due to how bad the story is
at least if there had been good morals in there to teach viewers educational lessons , then it probably would have earned it a lower rating
but let me make this clear , This movie may be good to some, but others Do not like it, including me

this movie is 2 stars meaning i do not like this movie at all
and i just hope that he just waits in line behind other actors next time just so he can Earn correctly his oscar
and Not try to do the same moron mistakes like what happened when this movie and mad max tried to force the other oscar candidates including slyvester stallone's creed, which should have earned a oscar from the academy properly and not let these other oscar candidates Including mad max and the revenant try to cheat their way to get the oscar like it is some ridiculous political presidental campaign",1461024000,,2187,4.220095693779904

I do however find it a travesty that the film was screwed out of the Oscar for best picture to some piece of garbage about a bunch of boy banging priests, but then this just shows that some people have some really warped tastes in movies.

The only ""but"" I have is that I felt it used flashbacks poorly and tried to tell the story of the main characters past a little to ""ephemerally""... I get it, it was supposed to give depth to the character, but it slowed down the movie to the point that at times I would be pulled out of the experience to think... ""what time is it"" or ""geez, this thing is really long"".... and that is the sure sign that the director/editor need to ""tighten it up"" a little.

7594650,5,B01A71FC90,"The Revenant is set during the winter of 1823 on the Great Plains. This Alejandro Inarritu-directed film stars Leonardo Di Caprio as real-life Hugh Glass, a frontiersman hired as a scout to guide a team of fur trappers through harsh territory. The journey is plagued by Indians, bitter cold, and dangerous terrain. Glass keeps watch over his teenage son, Hawk (Forrest Goodluck), who is half Pawnee.

The movie chronicles the obstacles  from nature and man  faced by the trappers as they attempt to get back to Fort Kiowa. Tom Hardy co-stars as Fitzgerald, a particularly untrustworthy member of the party, and Domhnall Gleeson portrays Capt. Andrew Henry, their official leader.

A highlight of the movie is an attack on Glass by a bear rendered with computer imagery. The sequence is incredibly realistic as Glass is tossed about like a rag doll and clawed repeatedly. After the attack and his near-death experience, we focus on Glass struggle to survive alone in the wilderness.

Di Caprio dominates the film. With very little dialogue, he builds his performance on physical action, expression, and pantomime. The films violence reflects the harsh, unforgiving surroundings. The Revenant was filmed in Canada and Argentina under arduous conditions by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, who used only natural light, capturing spectacular images of pristine wilderness.

The only bonus extra on the Blu-ray release is the making-of documentary, A World Unseen. A digital HD copy is included.",1460851200,2,1491,5.296610169491525

The Indian tribes are fighting the Americans, but don't seem to be fighting the French.  The move was sad to me.  The last fight scene was more frightening to me than the fight with the animal shortly after movie began.  Lots of selfish bad guys---and---cannot imagine the men using the ""F"" word in ancient days.  IMO, that word was unnecessary.  Have never complained about the price of a film.

Guess hypothermia wasn't invented yet. This guy makes Superman look like Pee Wee Herman! The story is ridiculous, but well acted and visually satisfying. The antagonist is the bright spot.

in closing; I think it's time to put those old geezers who pick the Academy Awards, out to pasture. Politics (PC) should not trump art, in the movies.

I honestly couldn't understand the hype. Most movies I will pause when I get up to use the restroom. This one I did not. After a plate of nachos I expected to spend considerable time in there, and while I was not disappointed with my time management skills in this regard, I don't feel like I missed anything in the movie. I may have even enjoyed my respite more than the film itself. This is the movie equivalent of a scooter. You'll ride it but you don't want your friends to know....",1459900800,2,646,4.347107438016529

Tom hardy a unstable . Mentally ill fur trapper and Leonardo a guide for the fur traders  traveling with his native American adopted son.
Leonardo get attacked by a grizzly bear and is found by the crew, dragged halfway home and they leave him for dead offering hardy and a young man a bonus if they stick around and bury his body if he dies before help arrives. Well hardy has no intention of waiting around that long. . Long story short. They left him for dead after hardy mercilessly murders Leo's son . Blah blah Leo seeks revenge.

Some people say it is too violent but nothing like most violent movies, this is no more violent than a 1970's John Wayne movie with the exception of the beat attack.  There are some arrows being shot but you do not see close up vulgar visual details of people being killed, no high graphic violent scenes.  I would rate it pg 13 at the highest.
The scenic shots are wonderful, the native American Indians are true to what history tells us.
The best movie made in years.  You do not even recognize DeCaprio they did such an amazing job with makeup and costume and his performance is remarkable.  He will probably turn out to be one of the best time actors ever and I never liked him prior to a few years ago, not I have nothing but respect for his acting abilities.",1459641600,,910,4.355029585798817

Leo deserved the Best Actor Oscar for Blood Diamond and Wolf of Wallstreet so his finally winning for this is a prime example of why people dislike the Oscars, a long history of actors winning for the wrong films.

Revenge. Not quite sure how some people didn't realize that unless they fell asleep? As an avid outdoorsman I found myself smh alot at some of the far fetched scenes like the river scene. I personally thought the camera work was horrible. Close up were atrocious. It was okay. I think it could have been alot better.

Yes Leonardo did a good job but I think the screen play and directing was not as good. Too long and the extra time did not add to the movie or story line. The fog on the camera I'm sure was a debated choice, in my opinion it was a annoying. I can imagine the director arguing to keep it in as an artistic choice, he should have been reigned in. I book is so good, my best read of 2015, that I started reading other frontier books after it.

All the characters suck, none of them are believable, let alone interesting. They all have the intelligence of a wet mop, and not even the hero is the least bit likeable.

7594773,5,B01A71FC90,"""The Revenant"" is a powerful and honest testimony on what life was like in the American wilderness of the early 19th century, dealing not only with the Native tribes who were, understandably, not only trying to protect themselves and their way of life, but at times were at war with other tribes.
Leonardo DiCaprio has come light-years from the boyish charm he exhibited in ""Titanic"" or even the bright-eyed (and coked-up) hedge fund manager he portrayed in ""The Wolf of Wall Street."" Leo's Hugh Glass is the dictionary definition of a grizzled frontier guide. When he is mauled by a Grizzly bear and left for dead (not a spoiler as this is the frontispiece of the film's trailer) and left or dead by two of his party members who were supposed to be caring for him and tending his wounds, it begins the most epic journey of vengeance since Uma Thurman clawed her way out of a premature burial in the ""Kill Bill"" duology.
This film is very nearly perfect -- DiCaprio's performance doesn't outshine the film's antagonist, John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), nor that of the other characters, including Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Greeson), Bridger (Will Poulter) or the supporting cast. Perhaps this is due, at least in part, to the vast beauty and the sheer scale of the wild country in which it was set. The wilds of Alberta, standing in for the frontier
Ands that would become my adopted home of the Dakotas, are every bit as much one of the stars of this film as DiCaprio or Hardy. The snowcapped peaks and the roaring river, the vast dome of the sky studded with a million stars -- this film would have been utterly different without them. If I could, I'd give it SIX stars.",1459296000,,1673,4.636363636363637

7594789,5,B01A71FC90,"I truly became immersed in this movie. Knowing that it was all filmed on location and in natural light made it a cinematic masterpiece. Leonardo DiCaprio made this so visceral in that you felt all of that pain, etc. he was dealing with. He was truly devoted to this role and making it a one of a kind performance. Alejandro Inarritu is a cinematic genius and that's what made this film work so well. He knew what he wanted and settled for nothing less which turned into an Oscar for him (for the 2nd time) and Leonardo DiCaprio . I've seen it many times , and yes it is gory and bloody, but it is also very poetic. I know quite a few people didn't like it , as they expressed leaving the theater, However, I don't think they appreciated all of the beauty, cinematic effects,  great performances, and what these men had to endure to make this movie.",1459209600,14,848,4.333333333333333

7594934,5,B01A71FC90,"Excellent film, but it focuses too much violence. The cinematography is breathtaking... visuals, sound everything in that realm is perfect. I do feel strongly that there was way too much gore and that that element was overdone in several scenes- the same message and feelings could have been conveyed with a lot less blood and guts. This is especially true in the final scene where Hugh Glass(Leonardo di Caprio) finally achieves revenge for the death of his son Hawk(Forest Goodluck). How are these people  surviving after being stabbed & shot way too many times? In fact we are left wondering how Glass survives everything he does from being mauled by a grizzly bear defending her cubs to falling through rapids and off of cliffs. The only explanation other than artistic license & suspension of disbelief is that his will to survive is driven by his desire to seek revenge.

This is a story of great injustice on so many levels as well as of nature vs society, animals vs humans, native american vs europeans. It's a story of war of vengeance and of loss. In the last scene  Glass repeats a phrase Hikuc(Arthur Redcloud) a man who befriends and saves him on his journey back said: ""vengeance is in the hands of the creator, not mine"" He says this when his son's murderer John Fitzgerald(Tom Hardy) asks if he enjoyed his revenge since it won't bring his child back.  I have to agree that it won't bring his son back so I'm left wondering what was the real message of the film.

Does Glass absolve himself of the death of his son's murderer or does he realize it was all in vain and decide to let go? Glass says to captain Henry( Domhnall Gleeson): ""Fitzgerald took my boy and that was all I had"", this is our explanation for his driving force throughout the film. In the end Glass decides not to kill Fitzgerald with his own hands, he lets him float down the river to Elk Dog(Duane Howard) and his warriors who are seeking their own vengeance and who in turn let Glass live.

Things I would change about the film would be as stated above- less violence as well as more scenes of the past of Glass with his wife(Grace Dove) and family. I think when you overwhelm with excessive gore and brutality it takes away from the emotional content and from the character development.

The goal :  to make it alive to a French mission among the Huron in the depths of the wilderness.

7594945,3,B01A71FC90,"Much ado about very little. Basically, the movie is about bad whites being killed off for their bad deeds. In a way, it's reverse racism as this movie tries to convey that only good white man is a dead white man. The ones who play even so called ""good character"" whites are killed off - every one of them. DiCaprio's character, being not totally white, is allowed to live but must suffer horrifically. The telling moment that basically summarizers the core message of the movie is when an Indian who befriends and saves Leo (who of course suffers a gruesome death at the hands of the whites) tells him that vengeance is not the purview of men but God (or something similar to that effect). Guess who kills off the baddest white dude (played by Hardy) at the end - the INDIANS - who therefore are acting as messengers of God. Hardy basically embodies all the bad characteristics of the whites (as envisioned by the director) - the most prominent being the ability to rationalize all acts of evil. Forget the obvious revenge story about a man seeking justice for the murder of his son, that's totally besides the point. The main point is this director, using his recent acclaim, and using the glorious canvass of the wild (it is gloriously filmed) to stick his middle finger at the white establishment. White Hollywood joyously took his finger and stuck it up their...kneeling before him and honoring him for making them look stupid. Hey, the actors are really good and the cinematography is great but the best part is how white Hollywood got hoodwinked into loving this revenge film without realizing the revenge is on them.",1457568000,6,1623,4.698245614035088
7594946,3,B01A71FC90,"I would give The Revenant a solid 3.5 overall. It's an extremely good looking and well made movie. In my personal opinion, I think Tom Hardy stole the show. I'm by no means a fan of Leo but I don't have a problem with him either. I think he's okay in most movies, and in this, he is also just okay. Tom Hardy is almost unrecognizable. Leo is, well, just Leo. He is far from compelling. There was a lot of hype for his performance but honestly there's not much to go crazy for, aside from like I said, Tom Hardy.

Moving on I felt no attachment whatsoever to the story. You could tell they wanted to throw in all these subplots to spice things up but there's not much of interest going on and therefore nothing to get invested in. Characters come and go, events take place but there's nothing to really take away from these scenes that are supposed to be intense but ultimately lack depth and purpose. All of these subplots feel like padding so we aren't just watching Leo do his thing for 2 and half hours. But Leo fighting for survival is the only thing that could absolutely be paid interest because it appeals to the survival instinct of human nature. Aside from that, there's nothing. The time period is interesting and the fact that these men are fighting for survival and their way of life, but the actual drama going on with Leo's character and the emotional connection we are supposed to feel is just not there for me. Emotionally it's trying but ends up feeling empty. So to sum it up, there's stellar direction, cinematography, and some solid acting here, but not much going on with the story. Certainly worth watching, but it's also very undeserving of the hype.",1457568000,6,1673,4.467320261437909
7594947,2,B01A71FC90,"A beautiful and terrible movie.

I could almost leave it at that, but I suppose it does need more explanation.

First, though:
You know, I'm not going to complain about DiCaprio getting best actor for this. I think a role like this is probably pretty tough. And I don't just mean the rigorous conditions. I mean the not being able to use your voice. There's not a lot of talking in this one. DiCaprio did a more than adequate job of carrying the movie with his facial expressions and stumbling around, much better than Redmayne did last year, at any rate. However, I think Bale would have been the better choice for The Big Short. If he'd been nominated for best actor, that is. What's up with that?

And I don't particularly like Christian Bale.

The movie is beautiful. Even in its terror, it's beautiful. The cinematography is, in a word, amazing.

But, beyond that, the movie doesn't offer much. In that way, you can take ""terrible"" to mean whatever you want it to. What I can say is that, at the end of the movie, I wasn't left feeling anything. Maybe that's the way Inarritu intended it, but I don't want to watch a movie and then feel nothing. My actual thought when the screen went from DiCaprio's face to the credits was, ""Oh... That's it?"" There was no joy, no sadness, no nothing. No catharsis. There wasn't even anything to think about as there was at the end of Birdman. It was just over.

Now, this next thing is my own bias:
People talk about this movie as if it is just a revenge tale, but that's not true. It's not even mostly true. Mostly, it's a survival tale. I tend to not like fictional survival tales. They're just... too outrageous. Once you've decided your hero is going to survive, you can do anything you want to the character and, guess what, he survives! I have a hard time with Hugh Glass surviving the trials he went through. A real Hugh Glass, that is. Still, I was willing to go along with it for a while, even the trips in the freezing water, but [SPOILER ALERT!] going over the cliff on the horse was just too much for me. Okay, so was putting gun powder in his wound and igniting it. Clever but too much.

See, if you give me something like 127 Hours, I'm good. That really happened. The things Aron Ralston did to survive were amazing, but it's amazing because it's real. Nothing Hugh Glass did to survive or that he survived was amazing, because it was all a fiction. There's nothing triumphant and nothing to cheer. Then, there's the ending...

Also, there's Tom Hardy. I have nothing good to say about Hardy. Maybe if he takes a role that's more than guttural mumbling.",1457481600,8,2609,4.443514644351464

7594949,3,B01A71FC90,"Alejandro G. Irritu's film has Oscar nominations written all over it. The film begins with a bloody conflict between a group of fur trappers and a marauding bunch of native Indians; Emmanuel Lubezki's dazzling photography not only captures its bloodiness but sets it against the washed-out colors of a barren landscape, making us painfully aware of how the elements remain indifferent to human activity. The standards of cinematography are excellent throughout: Lubezki is particularly fond of the lengthy panning shot in which the human characters are depicted as mere specks on landscapes that almost seem to swallow them up.

And then there is the stellar central performance of Leonardo DiCaprio as Hugh Glass. He does not have many lines, but director Irritu concentrates on his sufferings as he quite literally rises from the dead on at least two occasions while trying his best to cope with the exigencies of a harsh winter. There are some memorable moments - for example, when Glass takes the guts out of a dead horse and crawls inside its corpse, thereby creating a cocoon to protect himself against the snow. In another sequence he manages to evade a posse of native Indians by concealing himself against a river bank, and then swimming out towards the rapids. Although buffeted by an apparently inexorable tide, he manages to cling on to some driftwood and thereby ensure his survival. We have to admire the actor's courage as he (or his stunt doubles) subject themselves to a series of almost unendurable tests of physical and mental courage. It is hardly surprising that DiCaprio won the Best Actor Oscar at the 2016 ceremonies.

But lush photography and stellar performances do not necessarily make a great movie. THE REVENANT is 156 minutes long; the plot unfolds at a leisurely (some might say almost a snail's) pace, with plenty of attention given to the central conflict between Glass and his arch-rival Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). The first half of the movie offers a convincing depiction of the trappers' existence, and how they struggle to survive while trying to make a buck. Unfortunately the second half turns into a rather hackneyed revenge thriller set on an unforgiving landscape. One can't help but remember that classics such as George Stevens's SHANE (1953) told the same story in a much more economical (and dramatically effective) way.

In the end we are left with the feeling that, while THE REVENANT has a historically convincing story to tell, director Irritu somehow missed the opportunity to do so.",1457395200,10,2531,5.035799522673031

The bear attack, while not the most violent thing I've ever seen, is certainly the scariest thing I've ever seen. It's realism is sublime.

their ""good tidings,"" as did John Muir.  For those who thought the film was too slow or too long, well that is what life
always is ... moments of frenzy followed by long periods of boredom. The Revenant captured that perfectly. For me,
it could have gone on for another two and a half hours. Too violent for you?  Life in those years and those places was
nothing if not all about survival. Even today, you can trek alone for a week across Alaska or even Yellowstone to get a sense of
what the wilderness is about.  Leo did it without GoreTex... as did all those mountain men 150 years ago. I cannot
imagine how any movie could do a better job of capturing that feeling of life in the mountains a couple centuries ago.
If you did not appreciate what the director, Lubezki, gave to you, go see a movie with car chases, zombies, outer space, etc.

At times it feels like Platoon, and other times it evokes the great David Lean. From the Indian attack to the bear mauling, Tension keeps building up until the very end, when Glass and Fitzgerald hack each other to pieces in the best directed sequence in Iarritu's career, evoking Robert Altman's McCabe & Mrs Miller and The Shinning.

7594958,4,B01A71FC90,"Oscar winner for best actor (Leonardo DiCaprio), best director (Alejandro G. I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu, and best cinematography (Emmanual Lubezki), THE REVENANT is an epic production and in truth Nature is the leading character. The film is a visual spectacle, the themes of survival and for love between a father and son are moving, but this is a long song and requires endurance on the part of the viewer for sitting through 156 minutes of repetitious gore and raw natural elements. The film is based in part on a novel by Michael Punke, and the screenplay is by Mark L Smith and Alejandro G. I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu.

The film may be excessively long but the story can be quickly summarized: While exploring the uncharted wilderness in 1823, legendary frontiersman Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) sustains injuries from a brutal bear attack. When his hunting team leaves him for dead, Glass must utilize his survival skills to find a way back home to his beloved family (his son Hawk - Forrest Goodluck  dies on the same trip). Grief-stricken and fueled by vengeance, Glass treks through the wintry terrain to track down John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), the former confidant who betrayed and abandoned him.

The hunting troops are well portrayed by Tom Hardy (very difficult to understand his mumbling accent), Domhnall Gleeson. Will Pouster (a very talented young actor), Forrest Goodluck et al. But the overwhelming power of the film is the depiction of man in Nature and the concept of survival against all odds. For that aspect alone the film is well worth seeing.

7594961,5,B01A71FC90,"Nine Things About the Film ""The Revenant""

1. In case your vocabulary is rusty, a ""revenant"" is a person who leaves for a long time, and then comes back. They may even come back from the dead.

2. This is a fictional story, but was inspired by a real man. The movie is about Hugh Glass, a tracker for a group of trappers and hunters in the 1800s. They get attacked by members of the Arikara Native American tribe, who are looking for the people that kidnapped one of their girls.

3. Shortly after that, the movie splits up into four different stories, which weave in and out of each other. The main pivot for these splits is a guy named John Fitzgerald, who is the very definition of ""every man for himself.""

4. It was directed by Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu. This is his sixth film. He's known for his ""Death Trilogy"" as well as 2014's Birdman. I've seen all of his films, and he's one of my favorite directors, because he has the rare talent to find beauty in the horror of life, and to find horror in the beauty of life. This movie illustrates that talent perfectly.

5. Leonardo diCaprio gives his most intense performance ever in this movie. It's even more impressive because he hardly ever talks. And Tom Hardy is one of the most versatile actors around (he was Mad Max, he was Bane. He was riveting in Locke, which was just him driving in a car for two hours. And here's a fun fact - Hardy and diCaprio first acted together in Inception). The two men serve as dual tentpoles around which the rest of this movie hangs.

6. The movie will become famous for it's bear attack scene. That scene required months of rehearsal, and Irritu watched footage from about 100 bear attacks in order to make it as realistic as possible.

7. Emmanuel Lubezki is the cinematographer here, and his work on this film is astonishing. The shots are lush and haunting. He's filmed Terrence Malik's last three movies (and his upcoming two), and some of Alfonso Cuarn's, such as Gravity.

8. The movie is respectful of Native Americans without making them look like the sanitized and helpless stereotypes that are commonly seen. Everybody contributed to the tensions of the time, and took resources wherever they could be found.

9. Despite some crazy action sequences, this is not an action movie. It's a three-hour exploration of human endurance and revenge. Some people will be captivated by this movie; others will find it to be too long and depressing. In either case, on a technical level this is a masterwork of film-making.",1457136000,8,2512,4.589285714285714
7594962,5,B01A71FC90,"Adapting the mostly true experiences of fur trapper Hugh Glass that took place in Montana and South Dakota in 1823, ""The Revenant"" is an amazing existential tale of survival and revenge that'll leave you feeling gutted and skinned, thanks to the remarkable vision and cinematic artistry of the great Alejandro G. Irritu, the director of last year's multi-Oscar-winning ""Birdman"", and who has just won his second Best Director Oscar for ""The Revenant"".  He was also the Mexican genius who gave us three narrative-juggling films of great humanism: ""Amores Perros"", ""21 Grams"" and ""Babel"", the latter I consider his masterpiece.

Forget the stories of its difficult production (being filmed in authentic remote and bitter cold locations), and how star Leonardo DiCaprio  actually suffered throughout by being immersed in freezing water, stuffed into a horse carcass or actually consuming a bison liver, what you'll bear witness to on the screen will pull you completely into its stark, ruthless, primal world and hold you there, thanks to DiCaprio's career-best performance as the film's protagonist which justifiably earned him his first Best Actor Oscar. The film is long (arguably too long) and unrelentingly slow, but few viewers will find themselves bored due to its calculated hypnotic pull, completely enwrapping viewers in its frozen world almost as much as Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia"" put us in the desert.  Above all, it has two sequences that will stay with you forever: the grizzly bear attack which occurs, as do many sequences, in one seemingly single long take -- but I found even more effective the first Indian assault.  That scene delivers such brutal realism I actually felt terrified as never before in a movie theater due to the scene's directorial staging of the trappers' panicking while the Indians' arrows frenetically strike the men's flesh with the force of stinging missiles.  This scene makes every other Indian attack I've ever seen in a film postured and artificial.

Irritu is a Mexican genius, born in 1963, who managed to build up an extensive amount of cultural experiences through early travels, beginning at age 17 by crossing the Atlantic on a cargo ship then working his way across Europe and Africa. After his journeys, he returned to Mexico City, majored in communication, then began a career as a radio station host interviewing rock stars and hosting live concerts while single-handedly building WFM into the number one station in Mexico.  All these experiences apparently became the source of his eclectic filmography, beginning with writing and directing a famous Mexican TV pilot, ""Behind the Money"", and making a few short films before beginning his feature career with ""Amores Perros"" in 2000.  His best work conveys a cinematic exuberance close to a Mahler symphony in its scope, forming a synthesis of despair and joyfulness in rendering the human experience.  ""The Revenant"" finds him at his most obsessive and committed during its long shoot in a way reminiscent of the epics of David Lean: an 80-day principal photographic schedule in the coldest weather at locations so remote it required more than nine months in unbearably torturous conditions, all due to Irritu's refusal to use computer-generated imagery (saving the few effects scenes that necessitated it).  The director's monomania for realism became so intolerable that many crew members walked off the project (or were fired), and Tom Hardy wound up attacking the director, nearly strangling him.  The efforts of Irritu (and his collaborators) can be seen in the final production.

Cinematographer Emmaunuel Lubezki (whose nickname is 'Chivo' which means 'goat' in Spanish) has an affinity with this director (he won an Oscar for Irritu's ""Birdman"" before winning one for ""The Revenant""). After tests on 35mm and 65mm film stock, Lubezki and director Irritu decided to shoot ""The Revenant"" on 6K high-resolution digital to be able to schedule one more hour of shooting time per day, almost exclusively in natural light for authenticity.  And since lensing Alfonso Cuarn's ""Children of Men"", Chivo has been justifiably famous for long unbroken takes (in fact, most of ""Birdman"" is constructed as if its entire drama is uninterrupted by a cut), and he continues that tradition, if in a less obvious fashion, with ""The Revenant"" in its Indian assault and grizzly bear attack..

Though the film ultimately does not attain formal perfection, I left the theater carrying a new life experience unlike anything I'd seen before, achieved through Irritu's singular vision conveying a quintessential portrait of the American wilderness with great cinematic poetry.

7594980,4,B01A71FC90,"Normally when stories of production woes emerge it spells inevitable doom, but twice in 2015 we've seen two of the year's best films emerge unscathed, if not better for having struggled to completion. One was George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road; the other is Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's unforgiving, poetic tale of reflection and icy revenge, The Revenant. As a follow-up to his upbeat and brisk Oscar-winner, Birdman, Inarritu couldn't have gone in a more stark direction. As wondrous to behold as it is punishing to endure, The Revenant is Inarritu staking his claim to the most unique movie of the year. Nothing else looks quite like it; no other film puts you through the emotional wringer quite like it, either.

Maybe it's the merciless weather Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, and much of the crew were put through, but everything about this film is brutal. The only thing more chilling than the raging blizzard are the chilling acts of barbarism in a world without mercy; where surviving is the only thing that can and ever will matter. DiCaprio, looking shaggier than ever in his career, plays Hugh Glass, a tracker and frontiersman in 1820 Wyoming, working for a fur company in the snowy Rocky Mountains. When a Native American tribe attacks, it's every man for himself...as long as he doesn't forget his bale of bear pelts. In fact, pelts are the only thing that seem to matter to the cruel John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), a nasty, racist piece of work who has a special dislike for Glass and his half-Pawnee son, Hawk (Forrest Goodluck). The crew barely survives the attack, which is captured in fluid chaos by DP Emmanuel Lubezki (winner of two Oscars for Gravity and Birdman), and it's up to Glass to navigate everyone home.

Cruelty on top of cruelty is heaped upon Glass, but it all begins when he's viciously mauled by a raging bear. The attack itself might be one of the grizzliest scenes captured on film. But for all of its ferocity, there's something beautiful about it, as well. The technical wizardry of it, as DiCaprio is literally battered from tree to tree, pummeled, bitten, and clawed, is remarkable. You'll spend the rest of the film wondering how they pulled it off. With Glass near death, the scrupulous captain (Domhnall Gleeson, who is in everything this season) figures they can't outrun the pursuing Natives and carry him along. So he offers up a ton of money to anyone that will stay behind with him until they can return with reinforcement. The opportunistic Fitzgerald agrees, along with Hawk and the innocent youngster, Jim Bridger (Will Poulter). But it isn't long after they are left alone that Fitzgerald commits a heartless act, captured right in front of the immobile Glass, which demands vengeance.

And vengeance is what he seeks; it boils in Glass's savage blood. This is a DiCaprio we've never seen before, feral and unwavering, agony and fury captured in his burning eyes. The level of commitment he brings to the role is extraordinary, but the same goes for Hardy who at this point can mumble villainy with the best of them. Both actors look like they have an extra layer of bark on their rugged skin. Not everyone could have endured the rigors Innaritu put them all through, shooting only a few hours a day to capture the most natural light he possibly could. Much of the crew quit; the delays stretched into weeks and months, but the results made it all worth it.

Admittedly, The Revenant sticks to such a grim note throughout that it may be tough for some to handle. It's an endurance test, for sure, but the darkness is broken up by Malick-ian dream sequences capturing the expansive vistas in which Glass makes his painful journey. These scenes are what drives him further than any man should be capable to go; to survive wounds that would fell a regular man, to move on despite starvation and freezing temperatures. They're key to the story even if they feel somewhat separated from the narrative.  DiCaprio gives this film its beating heart, while a surprisingly good Poulter provides the slim strand of goodness coursing through it.

The film ends exactly as it should, with the promise of more violence. The Revenant gives no quarter; it's a challenging, brilliant film that proves once again that Inarritu is unparalleled when at the top of his game, and fortunately for us he always is.",1455667200,5,4343,4.815013404825737

7594982,2,B01A71FC90,"This film was a disappointment for me because of the numerous historical inaccuracies, the old well worn formula of a person wronged seeking revenge, the lack of era definition and an almost complete absence of character development. Way too much time focusing on endless vistas which I can see for free either on PBS or not far from my burg. The stereotypes are all there geared for the masses including wise, mysterious indians, stupid bumbling trappers, hand and long muskets fired like semi-automatics, and the seemingly irresistible inclination by producers and directors today to inaccurately infuse 21st century dialogue and occasional perspectives either because they think the audience is too stupid to catch on or they themselves are too ignorant to understand the period piece they are dealing with. The bear attack scene was the highlight and reasonably well done but not perfect.

If one pushes all these complaints off the table and simply wants pure fantasy entertainment and don't mind that they're really paying for the boisterous soundtrack, special effects and visual violence then I gave it two stars to account for that. DiCaprio does a decent acting job as he usually does depicting the sheer intensity of his character's circumstances even though some of the character's actions are incomprehensible. The supporting cast ranges from lame to acceptable. If you want to see an improvement on this subject then the '71 film ""Man in the Wilderness"" does a much better job as does a close-to-topic mountain man film like ""Jeremiah Johnson"". Both do not have today's special effects nor are they completely historically accurate either but at least they have character development and a human interest story.",1455494400,7,1725,5.205035971223022

The rest was one hard to watch movie. Also, I felt they could have at least shaved 30-50 minutes off it off and not much would have been missing.

After being attacked and almost killed by a bear, an early peak as far as memorable scenes go, hes left injured for most of the movie. His constant grunting and sighing is what irks to the point of nearly ruining an otherwise thrilling adventure.

The cinematography and choreography of the first ten minutes or so, the Indian ambush, are particularly engaging. There are underlying themes of love and war; nostalgic endearment and bitter revenge are more like it; but The Revenant is mainly a tale of survival as protagonist Hugh Glass, left for dead in the cold and snowy wilderness, fights to survive.

I would describe this movie as a beautiful and violent.  Leonardo DiCaprio is awesome in the role and performs everything you see in the film.  He actually eats the liver and that is really him vomiting on film, the water scenes are also really him in that water.

My wife and I liked the movie,  one couple that are our friends felt it was long and boring and turned it off.  A second group of friends thought it was good but they didn't think it would be that violent.  So our friends have mixed reviews on this one.",1454803200,4,803,4.342281879194631
7594991,4,B01A71FC90,"The Good:
If you haven't heard by now, or if you've been living under a rock for the past decade, Leonardo DiCaprio is a phenomenal actor. His dedication to his roles can never be questioned seeing as though he actually did a lot of things to prepare for this film. (Click here to find out the crazy things he literally did.)  I also wouldn't be surprised if Tom Hardy didn't get some ""Best Supporting Male Actor"" nominations as well. He played a great antagonist to counter Leo.

Director Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu delivered captivating and suspenseful scenes throughout the film. Similar to how he did in Birdman, some of the most intense scenes were shot all in one entire take. Shooting in the natural elements really made the scenes appear that much more authentic. To top it all off, the action, hunting and gory survival sequences were intense to watch. (*Semi-Spoilerish* It even made some people walk out of some of the screenings.)

The Bad:
While the movie starts off with some really intense and suspenseful scenes, it slows down for quite a while afterwards. You almost feel like the movie is crawling at the same pace as Leo crawls along the ground. (It picks up during the end though)

So this can go either way, but this movie was pretty gory. I don't believe that it was senseless gore like in Hostel or Saw, for example. But I wouldn't be surprised if some people get turned off by it either.

The Reason:
Seriously, the Academy better give Leo an Oscar before he kills himself. If this performance doesn't earn him one, I don't know what else could possibly be done to get one. I don't think this is the type of film that everyone will flock to, but if you saw it, I don't think it would disappoint. Fans of Leo will definitely appreciate this film of ""man vs nature"" and revenge. I think this movie will make for a good matinee viewing on a weekend, or maybe even a decent watch at home.

The Rating: 8.5/10

7594992,5,B01A71FC90,"The Premise:
Hugh Glass and his son, Hawk, are fur trappers in the wilderness of the unsettled Louisiana Purchase working for the Rocky Mountain Fur Company under the command of Captain Andrew Henry. The enterprize disintegrates when the group meets hostility and violence from the local Native Americans. Having to abandon their goods, the survivors begin a perilous trip back. While scouting ahead, Glass is savagely mauled by a bear and barely survives. His companions patch his wounds and try to travel with him but find it impossible. They leave Glass behind in the hands of his son and his fellow hunters Jim Bridger and John Fitzgerald, to heal or be buried when he dies.
Fitzgerald, a self-centered racist of a man, kills Hawk and tricks Bridger into abandoning Glass to die in a shallow grave. They then proceed back to the fort. Glass, however, is not dead and has vengeance in mind. What follows is a harrowing tale of survival and revenge across the American wilderness.

The Short of It:
This is an intense movie, done with an artistic style and a sense of poignancy. The plot is interesting and captivating with a satisfying conclusion, carried by excellent performances by everyone involved, but none more so than Leonardo DiCaprio as Hugh Glass. It is not fun, and it is not packed with action. If you go into the film expecting that, then you might very well be bored. However, if you go in on the films terms and can handle violent imagery, it is highly entertaining. I recommend it.

7594994,2,B01A71FC90,"Saw it in a theater. After reading the promos and the critics, I expected a really exciting film and ended very disappointed. The story is so simple-minded that it fails to be a movie plot. Glass, hired as a guide for a fur-trappers' trek on the American-French Canadian border, clashes with Fitzgerald, a low-life trapper who has better ideas about the route, about avoiding the scalping Indians, about getting paid, etc, etc. You add to it Glass's half-caste son (hated by Fitzgerald) and his dead Indian wife (killed by a French soldier, but communicating regularly with Glass in his dreams and hallucinations), and you get the standard Holywood prescription of a drama for the masses. When Glass meets a grizzly and seems to be dying from the terrible wounds, Fitzgerald volunteers to stay with him until he either dies or help comes. Fitzgerald then kills Glass's son, buries Glass alive and goes back to the frontier town fort to get his reward. But Glass refuses to die. Fortified by his rage and thirst for revenge, he faces all the terrible dangers and trials that nature and man can throw his way. Eventually, he gets back to square the account with Fitzgerald in a High Noon fashion. On the cons side - the movie is too long, to slow, too melodramatic. In a word, it is darn boring and primitive in its script and direction. DiCaprio, a really great actor, is reduced to playing a role of a groaning and crawling coach. He does his coaching well, but it's very tedious nevertheless. The music is bad, too. On the pros side - some beatiful shots of a winter country in the north and a great sequence of the grizzly mauling DiCaprio. If you leave immediately after, you'll save yourself a couple of hours of boredom.",1454457600,17,1725,4.677631578947368

It's a story of greed, crime, violence, survival after an endless string of gruesome trials, and horrible revenge, full of suspense and with powerful emotions, but I think the real protagonist is Nature itself - beautiful snowy landscapes, virgin forests, icy cold rivers, snowstorms, days and nights, wild life in every form and in every size, from ants to horses. Indians are both evil and merciful at different times, and survival on the mountains in the coldest of the winter is pictured in fascinating detail.

First off, THE REVENANT is, of course, a remake of 1972's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Man-in-the-Wilderness/dp/B000NZX4JQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Man in the Wilderness</a>, so if you consider remakes bad by nature, you probably don't want to see this. Ive also noticed some complaints about its length (2.5 hours), and while it has its share of unexpected twists, if you want non-stop action with constant thrills and spills, you'll probably find it too draggy. Finally, while it's ""based on"" a true story, it does depart a great deal from historical fact and should be taken as fiction rather than docudrama.

All that being said, I was utterly entranced for the entire length of this long, sad, and starkly beautiful film and didn't want it to end. The action sequencesbear attack, attacks by hostile Indians, struggles with other natural elements, etctruly take the audience Right There with their ultra-realistic cinematography, costume design, and sound effects. Very good, often splendid acting by just about everyone, with special kudos going to Will Poulter as young Jim Bridger, and, of course, DiCaprio as protagonist Hugh Glass. Tom Hardy is also great as antagonist John Fitzgerald, a character who, no matter how much the bad guy he is, is still given a sprinkling of sympathetic qualities. The way that Glass and Fitzgerald resemble each other in both appearance and certain mannerisms is another interesting effect.

The main reason why I cant quite give it five full shiners is that its plot follows the same basic pattern of so many other western vengeance dramas, particularly in its rather predictable ending. Still, the unique details and twists keep this from really hurting the film. The sheer number of supporting characters makes it hard to place whos who; nevertheless, this was obviously hard to avoid and also leaves room for multiple viewingsIm sure many will be as eager as I am to watch it again. Finally, some of the script/dialogue is rather flat and does not convincingly evoke the 1820s; e.g., Yep, the Indians are always stealing our s__t!

Some other notable things about THE REVENANT:

--Wonderful use of parallels in details such as the bear cubs left motherless, the lone buffalo abandoned by the herd as its devoured by stalking wolves, and the old Indian left behind in the abandoned village.

--Amazing visuals of the Rocky Mountain setting and Glasss dream sequences.

--The fact that THE REVENANT is based upon a true story (taking many liberties, of course) and that most of its primary characters were actual people leaves room to read-up and dig a little deeper.",1454284800,5,2672,5.272941176470588
7594997,4,B01A71FC90,"I loved the cinematography in this movie. Beautiful yet dangerous country. Leo actually says very little but his story was still so interesting to watch. Tom Hardy was outstanding as the bad guy. I loved hating him. Every character felt true to form.
I only wish the director had delved into Glass's previous life just a bit more so you could feel the attachment he had for his son and loss of his wife. Also, a loose timeline (or a passing reference to time) would have been helpful. When he finally gets back to civilization, was he gone for
several weeks? Several months? We don't know.
As another reviewer said, don't be late when the movie starts and be ready to stay til the end. It is fast paced and the fight scenes are fairly realistic. The camera makes sure you are right in the scene with the actors.

7595000,3,B01A71FC90,"Saw this movie twice and liked it much better the second viewing. The bear scene is probably one of the coolest and most lifelike animal attack ever seen on film and for that it is a huge achievement. It really is more like a virtual reality bear attack experience than it is a scene in a movie and I couldn't wait to see it again. The first time I saw this I just really couldn't get over the seeming absurdity of Glass's survival in scene after scene of his death-defying experiences. I think the point was that as long as you are breathing, you will fight to stay alive no matter how dire the circumstances. However, there are some forces that no strong will to survive can topple. Hypothermia being one. How did he not freeze to death?? He is in the river in freezing temperatures and emerges soaking wet from water. How does he dry off in time or stay warm enough not to have his body temperature plunge from the ice and snow? A wet bearskin coat is not going to protect him. These small details bugged me the first time I saw it. The second time, I just accepted that he was stronger than the elements.  Another problem I had was how quickly his wounds healed. Why? One day he is lying in a ditch unable to move at all, and the next he is swimming like Michael Phelps in a raging river. And how is it that none of those nearly fatal wounds gets infected or seem to cause him much distress as he is climbing on horses and doing all kinds of stunts while fighting off Indians?  You really, really need to suspend your disbelief for a lot of it. As for the creepy voices that are continually haunting him (his wife?), I found these extremely odd and annoying. Why did she sound like the ghost from the Grudge? And why do they always portray Native Americans as having deeper wisdom than everybody else? It felt extremely forced and stereotypical that whenever the wind blows he hears her talking about strong roots etc. etc. Tom Hardy was a super bad guy, Leo was the hero you rooted for but overall I wanted something more emotional or heartwrenching.

Inspired by true events, THE REVENANT captures one man's epic adventure of survival and the extraordinary power of the human spirit. In an expedition of the uncharted American wilderness, legendary explorer Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) is brutally attacked by a bear and left for dead by members of his own hunting team. In a quest to survive, Glass endures unimaginable grief as well as the betrayal of his confidant John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). Guided by sheer will and the love of his family, Glass must navigate a vicious winter in a relentless pursuit to live and find redemption.

The Revenant is nothing less than a masterpiece, a hell of a way to start the new year, this is an emotional suspenseful thrill ride from beginning to end unlike any film we have had in a while, the story is great, everything looks authentic for the time its set, the costumes and locations are good, the music is great, the cast is stunning, im not the biggest Leonardo DiCaprio fan but the guy deserves an award for this movie, Tom Hardy as always shines too, two fantastic actors at the peak of their abilities once again, the movies support cast is good too, Domhnall Gleeson also stars, last seen in Star Wars The Force Awakens, for a 2 and a half hour film its paced out so well and keeps you drawn in the whole time, the movie is very violent and quite graphic at times, the infamous bear attack scene is very well done, long and very cringe worthy! This comes highly recommended to almost anyone really who loves watching something that's big on suspense and hugely dramatic, a very well crafted story of survival and revenge, this is one movie you can really dig your teeth into the realism, plus the fact its based on true events makes it even better.

It is distractingly directed by the gimmicky showman Inarritu, whose Birdman is possibly the least dramatically interesting movie ever to win an Oscar.

And while a movie does not need to have have likable characters, it should at least have interesting characters, and The Revenant has neither. DiCaprio certainly looks uncomfortable in the snow, but since there is nothing to his character but his affection for the young native--a relationship that does not last very long--most of the movie has a zero dimensional character struggling with the elements with elaborate, gimmicky, cg-enhanced set pieces. Despite being played by a talented actor, the lead is completely uninteresting and his quest for revenge dull.

This is the worst movie I've seen in the theater since the similarly humorless, monotonous, and self-important movie, Precious. The politics are very patronizing and simple minded and lacking any depth other than the typical ""we are all to blame"" rehash that so many guilty and self loathing people love, as exemplified by the ""you are to blame!"" and truly laughable final shot.

A feature length music video full of cg tricks, but wholly lacking in characters, drama, humor, heart, and depth. Self-congratulatory, egotistic garbage masquerading as important art that will unfortunately fool a lot of people.",1453680000,20,1457,5.409691629955947

Don't be late and don't be in the line to get popcorn when the film opens, and don't plan to take a restroom break once it starts. This movie rolls out like a freight train from scene one and doesn't slow down until the last scene fades to black.

The bear attack scene is better than you have heard. The fight scenes are intense and realistic and brutal. The portrayal of ruthlessness of the frontiersmen and the Native Americans is unparalleled in any film I have seen, here played out in graphic detail. Men are shown at their worst, and a few at their heroic best.

Once you see the film you won't be able to imagine anyone but Leonardo DiCaprio as the lead. Also of note is Domhnall Gleeson who is in Star Wars and Ex Machina, and quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. Of course Tom Hardy, who immortalized Bane in The Dark Knight Rises, once again plays the antagonist to a fault.

7595016,2,B01A71FC90,"The Revenant exists only as Oscar-bait, and I have no doubt that DiCaprio deserves the award for such a brutal role in tough conditions. However, the rest of the film serves absolutely zero purpose, has no deeper meaning, barely any story beyond the struggle for survival, and almost collapses under the weight of its own self-importance. This is not the first time that the story of Hugh Glass has been brought to life, but its certainly the most alienating and depressing.

We've seen this struggle done before. Tom Hanks in Cast Away is a lasting example of an actor putting their body through hell and going full-on cave man. Cast Away also dealt with the themes of loneliness, sanity, and the need for direction. In the Revenant I knew almost nothing of the inner workings of Glass or Fitzgerald (a rather over-rated Tom Hardy performance). Glass seems to cope just fine with being alone (the pretentious hallucinations of his family only puzzled me), but I have a feeling that this was not the intention. As for direction (within the movie, I mean) it is noble that all of it was shot on location but there is no sense of space or place. We never know where any of these characters are in relation to each other. Every new location looks different from the last but we never have any orientation or a grasp of the greater landscape. All it would have taken is a five second shot of a map with any random character saying ""here we are, and this is where we are going"".

Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu's pompous style of long, long takes is completely inappropriate for this material and it took me out of the movie every time he tried to pull it off. I don't want to believe I am watching a documentary. I want to be excited and feel tension. The bear attack scene was brutal, but I would have felt more fear and anxiety had it actually be edited than done in one long shot. This kind of direction is not the antidote to Michael Bay's 1000 cuts in a minute nonsense. It was a mistake to shoot the film like this. Totally unnecessary.

As for the cinematography, a lot of people are praising it but it left me unimpressed. I admire the fact that they fought to shoot it all under natural light but almost every shot was wide and flat, wide and flat, wide and flat, wide and flat. Not once was I in awe of any spectacle or breathtaking natural beauty. Attenborough documentaries are shot better than this and spend less time indulgent cutaways. Perhaps the grain and texture of 35mm could have fixed this.

If you want a one man against nature story of survival then watch Cast Away. If a grisly tale of genocide against a new world backdrop is what you are after then Apocalypto is much better. The Revenant bored me and I walked out of the cinema immensely disappointed.",1453420800,14,2769,4.50996015936255

Half a page, I could have wrapped this thing up.

Now, I know this movie will wind up with a zillion reviews, some of them exceedingly long, longer than the story, and that's fine. As for me, I come here for nuts and bolts and ZERO giveaways. HATE that! So, despite the petty haters slapping me with a ""no help"" review, I stick to my pelts, grizzlies and rifles.

7595018,3,B01A71FC90,"Multiple 100% fatal experiences prove to be as just annoying irritants for Di caprio and what MUST be his Kevlar epidermis.
Being attacked and mauled by a large Grizzly Bear seemingly requires only a 'bit of a camp'- before embarking on a 100 kilometer long journey in near freezing-point water- And in no ordinary river.
Di caprio variously floats past dangerous jagged rocks, viscous rapids, over Niagara falls and past the Sydney opera house. But at the end of his trip, a few hot breaths into the hands is all that required to revive a body core-temperature approaching a size 9 chook in the freezer section at Woolies.
Based on a true story- but only in as far as- there WAS a man, there ARE things called bears and there IS a river...the movie shortly then wanders totally into the minefield of plot device, fabrication and utter cow-plop.
Di caprio's part is that of a Glaswegian, Hugh Glass, a fur trapper mauled by a bear and thought to be dying. Two young men are left behind by the trapping party (one 18 and the other 20) to stay with Glass until he dies- and then to bury him.
However, after two days these men are frightened off by paroling Indians and so gradually make their way back to civilization. Glass does indeed then undertake the river journey, but on a makeshift raft.
He eventually recovers and later catches up with the two young men, but revenge is not undertaken and he even goes on further hunting trips with one of them.
But back to Di caprio's interpretation.
Utterly consumed by an incandescent desire for revenge on the two kids, for not taking on a platoon of Indians and having their scalps removed, or not humping his carcass over the Himalayas and back to some backwoods Barber/Surgeon- Di caprio pursues and then unleashes merciless Hell on these two poor buggers.
All I can say is, Hugh Glass is fortunate he didn't go hunting with a bunch of Australians.
They would have just worked out the logistics- and shot the turkey",1453420800,8,1962,4.624641833810888
7595019,5,B01A71FC90,"As long as you can still grab a breath, you fight. Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) is leading a group of fur trappers through treacherous territory with the help of his son. While out scouting he comes across a pair of bear cubs, then the mother finds him. When he is found he is barely alive. Not wanting to leave him behind the group attempts to carry him to their destination but the mountains prove to be a obstacle. Two men agree to stay behind with him, but for different reasons. John Fitzgeralds (Hardy) greed gets the better of him and he kills Glasss son and leaves him for dead. Glass fights back and is now on a quest for revenge. There is only one thing to say about this movie. WOW. Intense, nerve wracking, infuriating, hopeful and inspiring all at the same time. DiCaprio is just incredible in this. He is captivating even though he doesnt speak for a lot of it. This is a movie I could just go on and on about but this is a film that just needs to be viewed and not talked about. The only real negative thing I can say about this is I don't think I could watch it again, it is just really too intense for repeated viewings. When you watch it yourself you will see what I mean. Overall, One of the best movies of the year along with possibly the best performance of DiCaprios career. He has come a long way since Titanic. I give this an A.",1453420800,7,1345,4.217054263565892

7595023,5,B01A71FC90,"This is a remarkable and extraordinary film.  It raises the filmmaking art to a different level.  The direction, cinematography, editing, and sound are exceptional.  From the astonishing opening sequence and throughout Inarritu's direction is fluid, surprising and alternately grand and intimate.  Much has been made of the cinematography using only natural light, and rightly so.  It is stunningly beautiful, and the harsh majesty of the wintertime  Pacific Nothwest has never been captured like this.  The sound editing was completely immersive and had the sharp clarity and snap of frozen timber.  I didn't care that much for Birdman, although it too had some complex and mystifying sequences.  But what Innaritu has done here is an whole other experience.  Frankly, he and his crew deserve any and all accolades coming their way, even that bonfire of the vanities the Academy Awards. Yeah, he won the Oscar last year.  Tough.  Technically and artistically this film is peerless.

A simple story of survival and revenge told in straightforward terms with incredible attention to detail and authenticity, it is brutal and direct, just like life in the early 19th Century was brutal and direct.  Leonardo Dicaprio does a fine job, ably supported by an unrecognizable Tom Hardy, that brilliant chameleon who here has a different voice and a rural accent that feels exactly 1800's Americana.  Hardy goes so deep into character only Daniel Day Lewis could find him.

This movie won't be for everyone.  It is harsh and graphic and it is exactly what it purports to be: the story of a man mauled by a grizzly and left for dead who survives and makes his way back hundreds of miles to safety and to exact his revenge; and, how he does that and who and what he meets on the way.  Not a lot of story, transformed by the magic of Innaritu's camera moving from majestic long shots to closeups so intimately close they breathe on you.  It is grueling, agonizing and harrowing, and it takes its time.  Fine by me.

Interestingly, this story has been filmed before as Man in the Wilderness (1971), starring Richard Harris and John Huston.  That was a good film.  This one is sublime.",1453420800,295,2171,4.887671232876713
7595024,5,B01A71FC90,"Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu must be the most visionary and unappreciated enough by American public filmmaker of the past decade.  From Babel (2005)--to Butiful (2009)--to Birdman (2014)-- to The Revenant (2015) he has created a masterpiece after masterpiece.  He is truly a filmmaker of the highest artistic quality.  If I had to summarize The Revenant in only few words, I would ask one to picture:The Last of The Mohicans (1992) or The New World (2005) set in snowy wilderness with heavy Terrence Malick's undertones.  The Revenant closely resembles the plot of The Man in the Wilderness (1971).

Of course note worthy are the performances of Leonardo Di Caprio as the protagonist Hugh Glass and Tom Hardy as the antagonist Fitzgerald.  The film is based on authentic historical persona a trapper and frontiersman Hugh Glass (1780-1833).

I must say De Caprio must have went through some physically grueling filming repertoire...just watching him constantly crawling in snow, covered with freezing soil, and nearly drowning in ice cold rocky river stream---can make one catch pneumonia. My favorite scenes include the opening battle scene between Indians and fur trappers, the bear attack scene, the horse chase scene with DiCaprio landing in a snow covered gorge where he uses his survival skill set to stay warm (horse enthusiasts will not be happy viewing the scene) and the final fight scene between the two main characters, which reminded me of Gangs of New York (2002).  Two other scenes from the film-- reminded me of Rambo: First Blood (1982), namely the one with Glass using gun powder to heal his cut and the fall from cliff on-to-a pine tree.  Glass himself as a survivalist stuck in the deadly wilderness and woods is reminiscent of the cult--film character --- John Rambo.",1453334400,5,1787,5.092465753424658
7595025,3,B01A71FC90,"My wife and I just viewed this feature at the theater yesterday evening. I can tell many people are raving about this movie but all I can say is (for me) it was just ok. The movie was to long that it dragged and though his acting in the part is very good, this is not Dicaprio's best. Remember Arnie Grape ? In ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape""? I've seen no one beat it. Not even Tom Hanks in ""Forrest Gump"" or Sean Penn in ""I Am Sam"" which was pretty close. Both Great Movies and performances. Oh Man! and I'm sorry but you would think the special effects would have gotten better by now. If you can't do CGI animals any better than that don't do it. It might as well be an animated cartoon!. Remember Bart the Bear attacking Harold Perrineau as Stephen in The Edge? Wow!! now that was fantastic. Oh! and as far as arrows and Indians? I've still not seen anything better than Dances with Wolves. Sorry folks! but for this Native American (Chickasaw Proud) the Flick just didn't cut it.",1453334400,2,983,4.318918918918919
7595026,4,B01A71FC90,"This movie is without a doubt, one of Leo's finest performances to date, and just as with Tom Hanks in Cast Away, he has very little dialogue to carry his role as frontiersman/mountain man Hugh Glass, who was an actual historical person in those days. But this role doesn't require tons of talking for him to be fully immerse himself in it, as it's essentially a survival story with strong elements of revenge where he simply has to survive in the barren, brutal wilderness of the American frontier until he can exact his revenge. It's a very physical role, which is perfectly suited for the time period and background depicted. It could have easily been titled Man vs Nature: The Movie! Of course Leonardo DiCaprio is not the only actor in this film worth noting, Tom Hardy as the main villain Fitzgerald is just as memorable, despite being in many ways the polar opposite of Glass. Will Poulter also puts in a fine performance as a younger frontiersman, or boy, if you prefer, who also suffers from Fitzgerald's wrath and malice. The film itself it very raw and grim, with hardly any sunlight or warmth to be found in the desolate mountain wilderness. Some people call it ugly and dreary, and they may have a point, but just as the people that inhabit this time period, it's all works very well together. What I didn't like was how easily Glass seemed to survive every life-threatening situation he was put through, after being mauled by a giant grizzly bear, exposed to the elements for days as he recovered from being mauled, and if that wasn't bad enough he then got caught in a freezing cold river, was thrown off a cliff at one point, which succeeded in killing his horse but somehow not him, and was stabbed and had his bones broken numerous times, yet still survived it all. I understand he was a frontiersman and had been exposed to the wilderness for years beforehand, but still, that borders on superhuman. All in all though, a dark but well told tale of vengeance and betrayal.",1453248000,3,1990,4.624293785310734

7595028,5,B01A71FC90,"I've seen this movie twice
I'm not a fan of bloody violent movies but this one although it is one, and a very ""raw"" one feels different, perhaps because
every character has depth.

I can't change history and all it's cruel facts during it's time period (people being killed, Europe's insatiable demand for fur and all it's luxuries)  I know that the movie had to depict such cruelty and oh boy! did they do it, and how!

The movie doesn't feel like just some western revenge male movie, to me it felt very human, very real portraying
all the emotions a human being can feel; love, hope, jealousy, revenge, hate and compassion.

The cons I read is that the movie was too long, that's a matter of preference.
For me even the times Leonardo was alone were entertaining because there was so much going on around him, I feel if the movie had been shorter it would have been ruined completely. Why do people need action every minute?

--synchronicity--

After the movie I pondered on how ""something"" becomes what it is that makes people ""feel"" with so much force, how a painting makes people stare to it's beauty, how music makes us listen. It also makes me think about the ""golden ratio"", that perfect mathematical formula that all beautiful things have, then there's the math of music.

Well if it's difficult creating one perfect golden ratio painting, I can't imagine orchestrating (directing) a ""moving"" one! with music and actors; people so in tune with themselves and others that they create such amazing performances, while the exact music tone is playing at the right time, for the right amount of time, creating sounds that mix in with those of nature, while a camera appears to just be swirling around people.... wow.",1453248000,4,1722,4.72
7595029,4,B01A71FC90,"For the 1-2 stars reviews, yes there are some parts that drag in the movie, but when you're confronted w/ surviving some horrible event, time seems to slow down, esp if ur waiting either to be rescued, or getting to a place for refuge. So, in those respects, I think the movie conveyed that part of surviving correctly.  Overall, I enjoyed the movie, Decaprio will definitely get the Oscar, even though he doesn't speak much. But I knew Tom Hardy wud be great as the bad guy, I hope someday he'll get an Oscar. Also,  I love that the director didn't glamorize the conditions of the severe cold environment  & not making ppl look like models, esp the Indians. Everyone looked like they were trying to survive, but back in those frontier days, when there's was no Costco or Walmt,  hunting for a living wasn't easy. Whaling, fishing, crabbing, fur trade - all hard work! It was based on a book, but Glass has NO kid, Hollywood spruced it up to promote more sentiment. And that it did, ppl can understand revenge for a murdered child.  Revenge for his own life wasn't enough drama.",1453161600,3,1078,4.536082474226804
7595030,3,B01A71FC90,"This movie could have easily spared maybe 45 minutes and been vastly improved. As it stands, the film is generally great, though it suffers a bit from numerous slow and lethargic lulls.

The meditative tranquility in this film is beautiful. Shot in all natural light, the wintry outdoors has rarely looked so enchanting. A minimalist score and quieter tone all help to emphasize the loneliness of the heros journey through the harsh countryside. Yet oftentimes, the filmmakers become overindulgent in these shots, lingering far too long in an otherwise unimportant moment. The first few times are peaceful asides, but the lazy editing begins testing the viewers patience.

Understand that the plot is already as simple as can be, so to continuously tease the viewer away from the inevitable conclusion dilutes the characters power and motivation. Instead of focusing upon hard-charging revenge to drive the narratives emotion and action, the director has opted for the leisurely scenic route where vengeance waits to enjoy the view and watch snow melt.

Much has been made of lead Dicaprios acting. While it is certainly not bad, it is quite simple. The character mainly relies upon the same set of expressions of fear, suffering and rage, only growling a few lines of dialog throughout the film. Beyond one emotional scene, the actors repeated punishment in the frozen elements is more admirable than any bombastic display of theatrics. Far more impressive is Hardys rambling and shifty scoundrel. Once a few tin-earred logistical conversations pass in the beginning, the film settles into its groove of desperate men crossing a punishing wilderness.

The film ultimately misses the mark when trying to tread an odd line between quiet zen melancholy and fiery, bloodthirsty passion. The movie looks amazing with some nice flourishes of humanity and adventure, but the repeated losses of urgency and momentum from so many aimless asides diminish the storys overall power and heart.",1453161600,3,1981,5.239747634069401
7595031,2,B01A71FC90,"NOT based on a true story!  I read the real story in the ""Cowboys & Indians"" magazine and most of the stuff in this movie did NOT happen.

SPOILER ALERT

1. This movie crawls, the bear attack (fake looking as Hell CGI bear. Where was Bart the Bear from all the other movies? A living bear?)  does not come till almost an hour into the movie. Fellow trappers Fitzgerald and Bridge were picked(paid) to stay with the injured Glass. If Glass had a half-breed Indian son, he was not with Glass when he was injured, therefore Fitzgerald could not have killed him which he does in the movie!

2. Glass vowed to get even with them both and hunt them down. First of all he went several hundred miles in the OPPOSITE direction to a fort where he knew he'd be healed, then went several hundred more miles to the fort where he knew Fitzgerald and Bridger were. This would take a lot of time and the seasons would change. This stupid movie takes place all in one winter.

3. When Glass finally found Fitzgerald and Bridger, he'd had a change of mind and spared them. It's not the stupid fight-to-the-death cliche snoozer fight like in the end of this movie.

To be honest, I just kept looking at my watch praying for it to just be OVER!!  I gave it 2 stars simply for the cinematography that started to repeat itself less than half way through the film. Save your money.  But it'll win Best Picture, you'll see!",1453161600,9,1399,4.370656370656371
7595032,3,B01A71FC90,"The short version is, this movie tells an interesting (though historically inaccurate) story, but loses a lot in my eyes because of unrealistic details.

As most people will now know, this is based very loosely on the true story of Hugh Glass, who survived being attacked by a bear and being abandoned by his comrades. Those two points are about the limit of the similarity between the film and the real history.

It is a long movie, but I personally love long movies so that was fine with me.

I see the word ""beautiful"" pop up frequently in describing this movie. To my eye there was very little beauty... just one or two scenes where the sun came out, plus a few shots with large mountains in the background. For the most part this was the ugliest, dreariest looking movie I ever saw. Where there was bare ground it was mud; where there was snow the snow was dirty. Everywhere the ground looked filthy and worn, as if trampled by a herd of farm animals. I have not spent time in the region depicted by this movie, but in my experience the wilderness in general does not look this way.

Lots of other details in this movie seemed unrealistic to me as well, which was a distraction from enjoying the story of it. Some were minor, like a tree falling completely over after having its upper foliage burned off by a fire that lasted just a few minutes. Now why/how could that happen? Or the behavior of these experienced mountain men... they are constantly slogging through swamps and rivers, without making the slightest effort to keep their footwear or other clothing dry. I should think that in such long term exposure to cold, with no place to escape from it, keeping one's clothing dry would be of tremendous importance. Better to walk barefoot in the ice water but have your dry shoes to put on when you reach the other side. Granted, in one scene Glass has no choice but to plunge into an icy river to escape immediate death at the hands of hostile Indians. But he survives the episode far too easily. Even healthy, well-fed men will die of hypothermia after 20 or 30 minutes of such exposure, unless immediately given warmth and other care afterwards. Another thing that would have had real mountain men laughing themselves sick was how these people build fires. First they gather dry grass and other fast-burning tinder. Then they strike flint against steel to make sparks and create a flame. THEN they go off into the woods to look for sticks and logs to burn. Oh, then there is the unbound guy who not only stands still and knowingly lets an Indian cut off his testicles, but hardly lets out a peep during the process to boot. And the scene where Glass keeps warm by climbing inside the carcass of a horse that has already been dead for quite a while before he gutted it. I do not believe in any case that a gutted horse carcass is massive enough to retain useful heat for more than 2 or 3 hours under winter conditions... after that you end up not only cold but wet and disgusting as well. There was a clever twist near the end of the movie that initially caught me off guard. But really, it ain't going to work that way. It was a cute idea but ultimately only contributed further to the unrealistic ""city boy's fantasy"" aspect of the film.

As far as acting goes, Leonardo DiCaprio did not seem to be acting so much as just toughing things out. I guess that was all that was required. I did like Domhnall Gleeson's character, even if his behavior/judgement was incredibly bizarre. I thought Tom Hardy did an excellent job as the primary bad guy. His character had a logical selfishness that seemed quite realistic to me.",1453075200,3,3631,4.5121580547112465

Eventually left for dead and colder than a democrat in the upcoming 2016 election, DiCaprio's Hugh Glass nears death and is aided by his son Hawk (an ""adopted"" child from a Native American woman, who Glass raised into adulthood himself) as he is abandoned by the crew of trappers and hunters who have vowed to give him a rightful death when the time comes. But when something nasty happens to Glass's son, the iceman ultimately vows to take revenge, no matter how many dead animal carcasses he has to sleep inside of to keep warm along his way back into town...
Simple and tiresome revenge tale is elevated somewhat by the beautiful, washed out (and chilling) period scenery (shot in 2.35:1 aspect ratio by the talented Emmanuel Lubezki) which no doubt takes us deep within the world that the Glass character inhabits...but this is all terribly overlong and probably not a solid choice for a film to begin with! I did not see the movie ""Birdman"" with Michael Keaton (a picture with an idiotic premise) but I can clearly see that director Inarritu has his eyes on the Oscar gold and little else. I'll bet that when Leo was sinking on Cameron's Titanic that he didn't envision himself chomping on the bloody ass of a freshly killed buffalo (with a hungry Indian who throws him a bone) all these years later (he does spit up a bit after eating the thing, but humans simply don't have the guts to handle eating raw meat with it being cooked...but I'll bet that a few people back in these days did just what we see here in this movie). To call the film ambitious is correct, but it is far too much of an endurance test to count for much (in my opinion). The problem with these ""good"" movies is that after they win the coveted golden statue the pictures themselves are often forgotten (I'll be watching and enjoying B-movies long after pictures such as this one have fallen into the wastebasket of the public's short memory), and as a result all of the charm, humor, and interesting side stories of these tales are pushed aside so that viewers can enjoy watching the star suffer. Because suffering is all that this movie is about. I suppose Leo enjoys being tortured like this (he is an actor, after all), but the movies have become all about torture and suffering in the hope that they are creating what they hope is ""art""...but we all have to suffer when this kind of suffering takes precedence over everything else. And nobody knows about suffering more than today's movie reviewer. So while it is a pretty joyless and simple affair, it might be interesting to you if you like Westerns, but make no mistake in understanding that this movie will quickly be forgotten after the Oscar ceremony.

P. S. And know that the movie reviewer today must be discriminate. There are far too many offerings coming out today that are just waiting to burn holes in our sensitive little eyes, and I for one have difficulty taking it all in (and certainly in taking it all seriously).

7595043,5,B01A71FC90,"I have been looking forward to The Revenant since I first read about it in 2014. Tom Hardy(you are gonna love what I have to say about him) was going to play in this year's anticipated movie ""Suicide Squad"", but dropped out due to the fact that he was still filming The Revenant.

And truthfully, there is so much to say about The Revenant. I want to first applaud director Alejandro G. Irritu for making such a marvelous movie. What he has done here, is capture the beauty of nature in the 1800s in a very unique way. The way he is able to guide the actors through such a richly detailed landscape is definitely worthy of all the praise. There haven't been very many movies that make me appreciate nature and allow you to absorb the attention to detail the way The Revenant has. Quite simply, The Revenant has some of the best cinematography I've ever witnessed.

I am going to be honest, I am one of those people that has long wanted to see actor Leonardo DiCaprio win an Oscar. I had the pleasure of watching What's Eating Gilbert Grape for the first time last month, and after the movie was over I sat and thought about all the numerous films he has delivered unforgettable performances in.

  2016 may very well be the time for Leonardo DiCaprio to win that golden statue. Everything about The Revenant is memorable in my opinion, but Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is both intense and as wondrous as he as ever been. Make no mistake, you will not only remember The Revenant as a movie, you will DEFINITELY remember Leonardo DiCaprio's performance in The Revenant.

 And adding to his already impressive list of performances is Tom Hardy. If Leonardo DiCaprio does a fantastic job at being the guy to root for, Tom Hardy literally plays John Fitzgerald with a shameless tour de force. I am very glad to see that he is up for Best Supporting Actor at this year's Oscars, because his portrayal is just as impressive(if not more) to watch as Leonardo's. After this movie, I decided that every movie/tv show that Tom Hardy stars in, I will ALWAYS watch it.

Moreover, Will Poulter, Domhnall Gleeson, and Forrest Goodluck all do well in their supporting roles. Each character feels necessary to The Revenant's story. As beautiful as The Revenant is to watch, the story keeps you entertained thoroughly. It is not only a movie about survival, but it also explores the theme of revenge. And thanks to the performances, and the gorgeous scope captured by director Alejandro G. Irritu, it achieves what it sets out to accomplish as a movie.

I've only seen The Revenant once, and I am already ready to see it again. It is absolutely a Superb film.",1452988800,4,2644,4.62046908315565
7595044,4,B01A71FC90,"When I left the theater after watching this film, I knew that I had watched a masterpiece.  I gave it 4 out 5, because it did not make a perfect  grade for a few reasons.  I did enjoy the creative use of the camera, with the camera moving with the actors, and close up scenes on the actors, so you could see their facial expressions.  The film used natural lighting, which gave an intense realism to mother nature.  You can't have perfect sunshine every day. The realism was incredible, especially with the arrows striking the hunters during the attack scenes.  The clothing, weapons, and portrayal of the Indians was spectacular.
The plot was simple - a grizzly bear attack, a mother protecting her cubs, murder and abandonment, and then revenge, all wrapped up into the folds of wild and spectacular mother nature.
The theme was revenge, the tone was survival against all odds when the elements, Indians, and friends want to kill you in a heartbeat.
Many symbols were used in the flashbacks to Glass's wife and his young son.  These scenes gave him the courage to go on, when human nature is to take the path of least resistance. The trunk of the tree is greater than the branches, yet the branches, when piled together to make a shelter, saved his life.  The shelter was like a Yuwipi ceremony, where rocks are heated, and then steamed inside the shelter, so the spirits will appear. The rocks have spiritual power.  The religious themes cannot be ignored in this film and were very powerful. When Glass sees(vision) himself inside a broken down stone church, with the Savior clearly painted on the wall, one must look deeper into the meaning of the sacrifice of the Savior, and Glass's son Hawk.  Did Hawk sacrifice himself so Glass can ultimately seek revenge? How does sin play a role in this theme?  When Fitzgerald recounted the story about a man who believed that God was a squirrel, and then killed and ate the squirrel, are we seeing the face of evil, or the theme of absolute necessity to kill the good to survive in the evil wilderness? You be the judge....Also, when the Pawnee Indian saved Glass by giving him some Bison liver, he mentioned to Glass that revenge was the realm of the creator.  I believe this is a purely Christian concept, and not something that is purely a Native American belief system. These scenes were similar to the original movie, Man in The Wilderness, with Richard Harris and John Huston. In this movie, Glass is presented (flashbacks) with scenes of his wife and his child, and realizes the futility of revenge, and his epic survival effort rewards him with the gift of forgiveness. But this is not evident in The Revenant.  This movie is all about revenge.
I also like to look at other theater goers during the movie, and some people were absolutely bored about midway through the movie.  Then the movie picked it up in the end, and the rest is history.  Absolutely go see the movie, and it may take two tries, but it is, in the end, a true masterpiece.  Well done, my friend.",1452988800,3,3019,4.614953271028037

7595046,5,B01A71FC90,"If you've never hear the term ""art through adversity"", you'll have a clear understanding after watching this film. While there are for sure plenty of visual effects at play, the truly brutal environment and conditions that this film was shot in make for a very real and visceral feel to the story. It is  based off a true story out of history, of a man who kept on going when many of us regular folks would surely have long since given up.

It's not a movie for everyone, a good friend of mine really can't watch films that have a lot of violence, and this film does have its fair share. The most talked about scene is the bear attack, and it's both incredible and tough to watch. The effects work is very believable, as is DiCaprio's performance.

It did start to lose me a bit, when they show the main character that torn apart and barely able to do anything, then start to push through and then become very capable at not only moving on, but then going on the attack. Some people might see that as a great character break through, but it seemed a bit of a stretch to me

Overall, it's really an incredible film, and i do tend to be pretty critical. It's the kind of film that just draws you in and keeps you engaged (a bit like Castaway does).

I don't need to go into detail about what the movie is all about cuz I've read alot of descriptions here already. But I will say The Revanent was amazing! Leo was amazing as always, but it seems he went a step further (if that's possible lol) of impressing me. The Revanent is the first movie I've seen where the main character (Leo) says less than the supporting actor (Hardy), none the less Leo had me totally captivated for 2 and a half hours! His acting and facial expressions were so believable. I love how he is able to convey just what's needed without uttering a word. The relationship between he and his son really tugged at my heartstrings and definitely a highpoint of the movie:)) Leo is bound to win the Oscar this time around and its way past due. Definitely in my top 5 favorite actors. Tom hardy was outstanding as well. I've seen him in quite a few movies and I can tell that he's bound for an Oscar as well. I saw him in a movie recently called Locke where the whole movie is focused on him in a car for 2 hours. Such good acting I wasn't a bit bored, now that's some serious skills there! Finally the director Alejandro Inarritu. What can I say? I've loved him since Biutiful. He has an eye for for cinematography in a movie. It was shot so beautifully, that I felt I was there with them on the frontiers, with the bears and all lol. I can definitely see why this movie was nominated for 12 Oscars and when it comes out on DVD, I'll be sure to buy it.  Simply amazing....",1452902400,2,1555,4.235690235690235
7595049,4,B01A71FC90,"""The Revenant"" (2015 release; 156 min.) brings the story of Hugh Glass (played by Leonardo DiCaprio). The movie opens to a short introductory scene of an Indian tribe (only later will we understand what we were watching there), and then shifts to today (being the early 1800s), where Hugh Gals and his co-hunters and trappers are soon under attack by the native Indians, and barely can escape on their boat, albeit with heavy losses. It's not long thereafter that Glass, while on a morning stroll, gets savagely attacked by a grizzly bear, barely surviving. While the other trappers initially carry him on a stretcher, eventually they abandon him, believing he cannot survive. What will become of Hugh Glass? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the latest movie from writer-director Alejandro G. I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu, who just last year won the Best Director and Best Picture Oscar for ""Birdman"". With ""The Revenant"", he goes into something completely different, namely an epic survivor tale the likes of which we rarely haven't seen before. This ain't ""The New World"", let alone ""Pocahontas"". Instead, we get treated (if that's the right word) to a brutal but intriguing film that will glue you to your seat from start to finish. The grizzly bear attack scene must be seen to be believed (I read somewhere that I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu refused to use CGI for the film, making me wonder how in the world that scene was accomplished). But that is just one example. As he has done before, I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu frequently uses seemingly endless shots (the initial attack by the Indians looks to be shot in a single take lasting about 10 min. or so). The acting performances are top-notch, with Leonardo DiCaprio, surely this generation's leading actor, providing a tour-de-force (just hand him the Beast Actor Oscar already), but Tom Hardy (as the villain trapper) is equally impressive (he is nominated for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar). Add in the gorgeous photography and a wonderful orchestral score (from Japanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto), and what you end up with is one of the very best movies of the year, period. Beware: this movie is not for the faint of heart...

I finally saw the movie last night (Friday evening) here in Cincinnati and that particular screening was completely sold out down to the very last seat. I imagine that this movie will do great business on the basis of wonderful word of mouth and the expected coronation at the Oscars next month, and all very much deservedly so. This is big Hollywood at its very best, and the type of film that begs to be seen on the big screen to get its full intended effect. Bottom line: ""The Revenant"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1452902400,22,2804,4.92600422832981

The story line involves Harris being a guide for Huston, is attacked by a rogue bear and Huston considers Harris dying anyway and leaves Harris along with two other members of Huston's group to bury Harris after he dies.  However, both of the two members are spooked by an Indian raiding party and they leave Harris to the elements.  Harris does not die and in doing so, he survives with one desire; revenge against Huston for leaving him.

On one hand it is unbelievably well acted, a tour-de-force, by Leonardo DiCaprio. Despite special effects and stunt doubles, I cannot fathom how many of the scenes could possibly have been shot. Hugh Glass, the DiCaprio character, gets attacked and viciously mauled by a grizzly bear and this is not a man in a bear suit, but seems like the real thing.  It is shot in Wyoming, Argentina and California all in the pristine 1800's landscape winter in incredible snow cold , mud. An incredible achievement both acting and  technically. That having been said it is NOT for the faint of heart. There is very very graphic and gruesome killings. Hunters kill game for hides, hunters  kill Indians/ Native Americans. French trappers kill Indians. Indians kill French. Everybody, man and beast, slaughters everyone else with little forethought, etc .

7595053,2,B01A71FC90,"This is a rather average sort of film based on a second-rate book. Its main problem is that its about a third longer than it should be. Its secondary problem is that the novel it was based on is not very good.  Frederick Manfred wrote a better novel (Lord Grizzly) several decades ago. Why they didn't go to that book as the source material is a good question. Michael Punke's writing isn't great and his book can't help be derivative of the ground Manfred already covered.

The film gets alot wrong. Starting with the all the visuals. The historical story happened along the Missouri River in South Dakota. On the great plains. The film sets the story seeming on the tops of mountains in Argentina and Canada.

The problem in the film is that everything is ""amped up"". Rather than go for realism, they end up creating another one of those films where the conditions depicted are ""better than real"". You can kind of tell that nobody involved in the thing has spent much time outdoors or is familiar with the areas in question. Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography is seemingly based around making everything look like the worst trip ever taken in the history of the world. Every day is the worst and darkest day in human history. I suppose it works with those who have never been outside a city or who don't do much beyond video games, but for me the look of it was so absurd that it reduced it to something like a cartoon. The worst of it is that while they had a huge location budget and the director was constantly ranting about ""authenticity"", they picked locations (Canada, Argentina) that were not consistent with the actual story. The director often seemed more concerned with portraying cold than he did with accurately portraying the setting the story.

I have to give them some credit for the bear mauling scene. Both the acting, the construction of the scene and the special effects
were beyond anything I can remember seeing in a film.

The film plays fast and loose with the actual history. What should be a simple revenge story is overloaded with all sort of redundant stuff. The film ends up being perhaps an hour too long. The director was also trying way too hard to be Terrence Malick. The ending is as pointless and depressing as one would expect. The violence is as amped up as everything else.

As far as the acting, there was nothing spectacular. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance was uninspired. In this telling of the story, Tom Hardy's character is reduced to an archtype villian which doesn't give him much to play with in the role. The film isn't great, but it will give most people what they want today.",1452729600,13,2626,4.636559139784946

Depicting a bear mauling that in no way comes off as hokey or fake. Finally, capturing the feel of the Rocky mountains in the gloom and ferocity of winter.

WOW...  Way beyond my expectations. Other Amazon reviewers do an excellent job of describing the qualities of this film of which there are many so I will not be repetitive.
A word of advisement on this movie: the violence is very graphic and plentiful.
 More than some may expect. Example: before the lights dimmed in the theater, two teenage girls giggled as they walked down the aisle eagerly anticapating another movie starring that cute Leonardo DiCaprio... when the move was over they slowly walked up the aisle, very quiet and white as a sheet.

7595057,5,B01A71FC90,"Theatrical review.  I pretty much had my Top 10 movies of the year list ready, but wanted to see this late arrival which just opened locally.  Now Im going to have to make a few adjustments.  In fact, Im guessing you're going to see a few awards at the Oscars in February land in director Alejandro Inarritus lap.  Again.

Based on real events surrounding 1820s frontier guide, Hugh Glass (brilliantly played by Leonardo DiCaprio), the story finds Glass leading a band of trappers somewhere in present day South Dakota.  Dozens of frontiersmen under the command of Capt. Andrew Henry (ubiquitous Domhnall Gleeson) are confronted by native Arikaras resulting in most being killed.  The survivors attempt to reach Ft. Kiowa, with the tribe on their tail.

Getting attention from the opening scenes is the wondrous cinematography constructed by Emmanuel Lubezki.  It is truly breathtaking with the characters nearly frozen exhale fogging up the camera lens.  The vast openness of the wilderness is at times eerily silent and at other times enhanced by a wonderful musical score.

In the most talked about scene from the movie, Glass is hunting for game when he is attacked by a mama grizzly bear.  In a remarkable feat of filmmaking we see the bear toy with Glass, whipping him side to side like a rag doll.  Obviously film trickery is used here but damn, it sure looked real.  And credit to DiCaprio as well for playing the scene to the hilt.  For that matter, his performance will surely get him an Oscar nomination and most likely a win.

Speaking of acting, Ill point out a couple more credible performances, not counting the bear.  Gleeson until the last year or so, may be best known for the romantic comedy, About Time.  In the past year hes had major roles in 4 of the best films of 2015 including Ex Machina, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and Brooklyn in addition to this film.  His characters are hugely different in each case.  And while the attention for this film is rightly focused on DiCaprio, Tom Hardy (Mad Max: Fury Road) as the opportunistic John Fitzgerald is perfect.  Fitzgerald is a villainous foil for Glass and the subject of his revenge.  Glass, left for dead, crawls out of his shallow grave encouraged by the ghosts of his wife and son.

After seeing the movie, I was convinced the story seemed familiar.  And sure enough, Glasss story had been told before on the big screen.  In 1971, Richard Harris starred in a film called Man in the Wilderness.  I haven't seen the movie in decades.  My memory of such movies is that they were either good or not good and I remember it being good for whatever thats worth.

As far as The Revenant, it is technical perfection, with astounding performances in harsh weather and ecological conditions.  It is supported by visceral story-telling and a fine script (Inarritu and Mark Smith).  It is also one of the best movies of the year.  Highly recommended.",1452556800,7,2917,4.739562624254473

The series of near-death experiences the hero endures and miraculously survives are the formulaic stuff of action thrillers.  In this movie they are simply slowed down, strung out, masterfully filmed, and given a Frenchified title in the apparent hope of ascending to cinematic art.  Unfortunately it was a long, long climb that never made it to the top and left my entire viewing party, as well as surrounding viewers, tired and somewhat bored.

The plot is about as simple as it gets.  A bad man kills the hero's son, leaves the hero for dead in the snow-packed northern Rockies, and heads off to steal a few things to get himself to . . . Texas.  To his consternation, the hero survives and comes after him.  It does not end well for the bad man.  From this 10-minute story line is wrested a two-and-a-half-hour movie.

7595064,5,B01A71FC90,"The Revenant
 Writer, director, producer Alejandro Inarritu has made perhaps the most ambitiously artistic artistic film of 2015.  He also made the most ambitiously artistic film of 2014,"" Birdman"".  He brought home Oscars for ""Birdman"" for best director, best picture and best writer.  To top it off, ""Birdman"" also turned a very nice profit for the producers.  ""The Revenant"" cuts a new farrow and has nothing to compare it to ""Birdman"" except ambition, skillful work and in this case, wonder.
 It is a wonder that a movie filmed with such consistent gloom holds our attention throughout, and that a film which has as its center the grotesque suffering of Hugh Glass can hold us in thrall.  The buzz in Hollywood says that this will at least get a passel of nominations and the Leonardo DiCaprio may finally get his Academy Award after his four nominations.  I'd say that is a safe bet.
 DiCaprio plays mountain man/fur trapper Hugh Glass, living in the world far beyond the frontier in 1820-1830 era.  He has a Indian son and mourns the murder of his wife.  The tale of misfortune which befalls this poor tortured soul stretches our incredulity to the breaking point.  Only the magnificent performance by DiCaprio convinces us that any one could possibly survive his experiences.  Hard to believe, but the events draw from the true life horrors which befell the actual Hugh Glass.  DiCaprio manages to star in the two hour plus movie with perhaps three pages of dialog.  All the rest of his performance consists of close ups of his face as various terrible things happen to him.  Astonishing acting.
 Also outstanding is Tom Hardy as the despicable  frontiersman John Fitzgerald, the Nemesis to Glass.  Fitzgerald might be a coward, a liar and a murderer but he suffers for his sins, feeling (and Hardy showing) his turmoil making the great enemy more authentic than most Hollywood bad guys.  Young Will Poulter continues his career arc playing a young Jim Bridger, another historical personage who went on to great fame.
 Director Inarritu let not a single ray of sunshine to mar the mood of the film.  The winter skies of the Yellowstone country never show bright and blue.  Well, this is a film about just how much pain Glass can endure without giving up, so grey skies seem to be in order.  The film has one of the very best battle scenes ever.  In the first part of the film a large and angry band of Ree Indians (more commonly known as Arikara Indians) suddenly attack about 50 American fur trappers.  The carnage comes thick and fast but without any of the tricks directors often use-no slow-motion killing, no exploding heads or the like.  The fighting might be furious but it seems very very realistic to the time and place.  Inarritu carries this theme throughout the film.  Brutal reality filmed up close so we can see it plainly but not stage dressed for shock effect.  The simple brutality is quite enough.  The hard ""R"" rating comes with this movie for this reason, not for any sexual stuff at all.
 ""The Revenant"" runs for two horror filled hours and 31 minutes.  Box Office Mojo reports a budget of $135 million and box office receipts thus far of $60 million world wide.  Inarritu and his fellow producers should have a lovely reward for making this monumental movie.  The audience in the full theater with me could no more take their eyes from the screen that I could.
 Fun fact-in 1971 Richard Harris made another version of the Hugh Glass sage called ""Man in the Wilderness"".  It isn't as good.",1452384000,55,3517,4.734761120263592

8746630,2,B01A71FC90,"Before the end of this film, I stopped paying attention. Proved the saying "" if it weren't for bad luck, I wouldn't have any"". It just got so tedious. Sadly, I bought the film based on all the positive reviews. That won't happen again.",1536537600,,235,4.363636363636363
8746631,5,B01A71FC90,I think audience who likes marvel movies or that sort of movie should stick to that genre of movies otherwise one will not be able to appreciate the authenticity and rarity of this movie plus the superlative acting of Mr. Dicaprio.  I am neither a fan of Mr.  Dicaprio but I can say this is one or the best movie he has ever done.  I can also add that this is an intelligent movie if you are looking for something that will entertain you then this isn't for you.  Amen.,1536451200,,469,4.177777777777778

8746633,3,B01A71FC90,"I didn't realize the nature of the movie, so I didn't enjoy it as much. Parts of it were boring. If you like revenge type movies this is it.",1536364800,,140,3.8620689655172415
8746634,5,B01A71FC90,Another great movie,1536278400,,19,5.666666666666667
8746635,2,B01A71FC90,End of the movie didn't really do the whole of the movie justice. It could've been a lot better.,1536192000,,96,4.105263157894737
