I regretted purchasing this product and would not even use anymore valuable time to describe the experience.",1451779200,,265,4.911111111111111

8593202,1,B00DHHHSIK,"We bought this after after seeing it in a Christian bookstore. Based on the expensive looking cover art, you'd think it was a high dollar production - but this is anything but. I couldn't get through more than 20 minutes of it, it was that bad. The best way I can describe it is it seems like a megachurch saw a movie like Courageous and said ""We can do this too!"" However, they did not have the same expertise available to them. The production values are just a step up from a home video camera, the acting is so over dramatic that you'll cringe... I kept waiting for it to get better, but it didn't. If I could give it zero stars, I would, because that's what it deserves, in my opinion. It went in the garbage. There are much better choices out there for Christian entertainment.",1382745600,2,782,4.326530612244898
