6779052,5,B00OZLF3QQ,I have always heard from my parents and their friends that Bobby Byrd and Marva Whitney  performed at the show too ( I was very young when Dr. King was assassinated and have had to ask my parents about that time ) So I am happy to have this DVD of the show as I am a huge James Brown fan.,1428969600,,288,3.721311475409836

6779054,5,B00OZLF3QQ,"As others have noted, it was filmed in black and white and the sound quality is less than perfect, but the music is absolutely incredible.  An amazing moment in history was captured here.  The restoration work appears to have been executed with great care and though the vocals are distorted (based on interviews the sound crew was apparently afraid to use their good mics), the drums and instrumentation are quite clear and present.

Keep in mind, this was an impromptu live television event to help calm a community in pain, not a film session for a commercial recording, but we get a perfect digital copy of the surviving master.  Much better than what viewers would have seen and heard over the air back in the 60's I'm sure of that!

Others have gone into great detail about the songs included here. The big selling point is that this is an expanded version.  They didn't edit out the opening number (""If I Ruled The World"") or the supporting acts (Bobby Byrd, Marva Whitney and Maceo Parker's comedy act) like the previous release that is in the box set.  Finally, I can throw away the VHS bootleg I acquired many years ago!  I actually did an audit and this version contains everything the bootleg had and more.

There is still a fade out at the end, so technically we don't actually hear the full show.  Maybe in another few years they will ""recover"" another few minutes to release a 'definitive edition'?  Just kidding, sort of...  While mildly annoyed that they didn't just give us this version the first time, I'm just happy they got it right the second time.  Collectors of James Brown's music should not be without this classic concert.",1425081600,4,1649,4.664359861591696
6779055,5,B00OZLF3QQ,"This was a tariffic addition to our collection.
Being from Boston, I'd always heard about this concert and how James Brown helped to save the city from erupting into a night of racial violence.
Now I saw first how just how he did this.",1424217600,,235,4.363636363636363
6779056,5,B00OZLF3QQ,i have loved this and the story behind this concert since the late 60's. i knew the details because these are my formative years.  i never lived in boston but james saved the city with this show.  and this is the best representation of the full show so far.  watch dance and revel in mr brown's hold,1423353600,4,299,4.2105263157894735
6779057,3,B00OZLF3QQ,"It was in black and white, I was expecting to see it in color. The sound system was not the best. 1 was disappointed with this dvd.",1421452800,,131,3.888888888888889
6779058,5,B00OZLF3QQ,"extended? yes! not just the expected stuff padded out with worshipfull interviews...this is great for hardcore collectors & for the casual fan.

really great to now have the real song opener, IF I RULED THE WORLD, and songs by Soul Brother NUmber One and one Half and Soul Sister Number One! (yes, Byrd and Whitney!).

for the unitiated, get ready for spectacular versions of TRY ME, BEWILDERED, GET IT TOGETHER and the massive cherry-on-top: previously unused versions of IF I RULED THE WORLD and YOU GOT TO CHANGE YOUR MIND (duet with Bobby Byrd), plus (finally) the finale reprise of I GOT THE FEELING. there are some very touching moments when JB speaks directly to the in-house and home viewing crowd, also not seen apparently since 1968!

we know that James Brown played humanitarian *and* superstar that night > he kept Boston quiet (in the wake of Doctor King's violent death) and managed to give one of the best shows of his career > and it boggles the mind to realize , in a way, it was just *another* astonishing show!

buy this now. think of it as a Christmas present to yourself!",1420416000,5,1092,4.642487046632124

Now we FINALLY get the most complete version of the Boston Garden Show available, THE EXTENDED EDITION, over two hours with Bobby Byrd and Marva Whitney's performances! Better late than never, eh? (The true Brown fan will want the original set for the documentary and Apollo '68 show, and The T.A.M.I. show should be in everyone's collection!) The picture is excellent for a almost 50-year-old videotape, and while the sound was recorded on what is now ancient equipment, the excitement of the show makes one forget it's limitations.

James begins the show with his usual 1967-68 opener, ""If I Ruled The World,"" afterwards he expresses his thanks to his fans while also assuring them he remains a ""soul brother."" Brown then introduces Boston City Council member Tom Atkins, who after singing Brown's praises introduces Boston Mayor Kevin White who thanks Brown for his efforts to calm the populace. After the combo of ""That's Life"" and a driving ""Kansas City"" Brown introduces Bobby Byrd, who between covers of Sam & Dave and Wilson Pickett duets with James on his recent #47 R&B charter ""You've Got To Change Your Mind."" The Godfather returns with a crowd-pleasing (especially for the ladies) soulful ballad medley before turning the stage over to Emcee Maceo Parker. Maceo introduces current diva du jour Marva Whitney (wearing a wig-hat borrowed from Diana Ross) who powers through Etta James' recent hit ""Tell Mama,"" ditto Aretha's ""Chain of Fools"" and double-ditto Marvin's ""Grapevine."" Maceo returns with a mercifully short ""comedy routine"" before whipping the crowd to a frenzy for the return of Soul Brother No. 1. James powers through a double-time ""Get It Together"" which, after a honkin' baritone sax solo by St. Clair Pickney, morphs into a extended little o' groove-maker ""There Was A Time."" Near the end James taunts the crowd before finally breaking into the promised ""I Got The Feelin'"" a (finally) unedited rocket-fueled mic-stand whippin' Maceo soloin' funk dancin' extravaganza. The Godfather then stops on a dime to implore you to ""Try Me"" flanked by the sax men, which double-dimes into a Maceo callin' medley of ""Cold Sweat"" and Lee Dorsey's ""Ride Your Pony,"" showing off those famous dance moves during the breaks (listen closely for the nod to Sly Stone). I dare you to try to sit still. Not missing a beat (he'd have to fine himself if he did!) James brings it down a tiny bit with ""Maybe The Last Time"" when an excited crowd member jumps on the stage. A phalanx of police moves in, but James calmly defuses the situation.  Unfortunately after a super fast and quick but very funky ""I Got You (I Feel Good)"" a young man gets on the stage again during ""I Can't Stand It (When You Touch Me)."" When James invites him to stay, a large group begins to rush the stage. Things get hairy for a while, but Brown appeals to their better nature, imploring them to set a good example, again defusing a potentially disastrous situation. Sadly this is the last number of the concert, the two hours seem to fly right by, but you can do the same thing the public TV station and viewers did afterwards, run it and watch it again and again......

Although there aren't any band credits, it's probably basically the same group featured on ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SAY-IT-LIVE-AND-LOUD-Live-In-Dallas-08-26-68/dp/B000009QMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SAY IT LIVE AND LOUD: Live In Dallas 08.26.68</a>"" recorded only four months later:

Tim Drummond - bass
Jimmy Nolen & Alfonso ""Country"" Kellum - guitar
Nate Jones & Clyde Stubblefield - drums
Maceo Parker - tenor sax, emcee & ""comic relief""
Alfred ""Pee Wee"" Ellis - bandleader, alto sax & organ
St. Clair Pickney - baritone sax & tenor sax
Wayman Reed - trumpet
Richard ""Kush"" Griffith - trumpet
Fred Wesley - trombone
Levi Rasbury - valve trombone
Bobby Byrd - organ & vocals
Richard & Marilyn Jones, Sylvia Medford - violins

Now, SHOUT! Factory, how about FULL-LENGTH versions of the 1967 & '68 Paris shows at L'Olympia? The show with the Collins brothers (Phelps & Bootsy) is absolutely smokin'! There's also a great Italian concert by this band as well. All are on YouTube for free, but a remastered DVD/Blu-Ray, somewhere along the lines of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MUDDY-WATERS-Classic-Concerts/dp/B000BM7U82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MUDDY WATERS: Classic Concerts</a>&nbsp;release would be awesome.....!

WARNING: Avoid the ""Soul Session"" or ""Night Of Super Soul"" DVDs on Hudson Street/Immortal (or any other releases on these labels), both are bootlegs sourced form either VHS or LaserDisc. Originally broadcast as part of the old ""Cinemax Sessions"" series this show, featuring an all-star lineup (Aretha, Wilson Pickett (!), Joe Cocker, Robert Palmer, Maceo)  was one of Brown's very best and begs for a official remastered release......",1418256000,16,8627,5.862261146496815
