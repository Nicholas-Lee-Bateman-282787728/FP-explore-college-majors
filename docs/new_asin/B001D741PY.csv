8291974,5,B001D741PY,great video with a lot of good tips on bowling,1425427200,,46,3.7
8291975,2,B001D741PY,"The very basic sections of the video are good and would be useful to someone who knows nothing about bowling.

However, I found the narration of more technical topics to be poor.  For example, she goes into fairly detailed discussions like using arrows to aim and then adjusting your board position (an important topic), but her explanations are not clear and are not coordined with the visual shots. I have bowled dozens of times and found her narration confusing.

A recommendation: If you understand the basics and want detailed coaching on all phases of your approach, swing, grip, etc, get this little illustrated book:  From Gutterballs to Strikes, by Mike Durbin with Dan Herbst, 1998.",1315008000,3,692,4.991304347826087
8291976,4,B001D741PY,"I really only have bowled for a week now. I used to go every now and then when my wife would drag me there, but I have bowled a 189 within a week. I didn't really know anything, so this dvd explained a lot for me.",1299456000,,213,3.652173913043478
8291977,5,B001D741PY,"This is an extremely comprehensive instructional video for all bowlers. Beginners and advanced bowlers will gain additional skills quickly by studying and applying the principals from this DVD to their game. I plan on watching the DVD again and again to keep this info fresh before our next tournament, This being volume #! makes me look forward to locating ""volume 2"" in this series.",1266019200,5,384,5.015625
8291978,1,B001D741PY,"Even knowing that similar content could have been already seen in other instructional DVDs, I thought it was no harm to have another one.  But the execution was just not good.",1251763200,,175,4.645161290322581

It had been over 40 years since I was in a bowling league, but I recently joined one. The equipment of the '50s & 60s no longer exist (hard rubber ball and dry lanes).  I had to learn how to bowl in today world, learn the language, learn new techniques, learn the new equipment.  This DVD video really broke down what I need to know.  Type of material bowling balls are made of, equipment bowlers use and of course how to bowl.  The 4 step approach was new to me -- I had been using a random 6 to 7 step what-ever worked approach.  Lining up using the arrows and counting boards to adjust to lane conditions was also new.  I took what I could from this DVD Video and the book ""Bowling Fundamentals"" to completely revamp my bowling technique and get me into the modern era. It has taken awhile to put these new techniques in to ""muscle memory"". However, I find my league average moving up a pin or two every week.  Currently I have an average around 160, but have recently bowled many non-league games over 200.  I keep working the fundamentals, someday I won't have to think about them -- it will be natural to bowl correctly.
