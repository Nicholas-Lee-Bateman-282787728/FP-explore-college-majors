8373199,1,B002LPQIRQ,"I bought this to see the TV Series remake of the classic film with Spencer Tracy.  The DVD itself was total crap.  I tried 3 different DVD players including a region free player and a brand new one.  The dvd skipped, stalled and froze completely making it impossible to watch the episodes.  Not sure what process the manufacturer used but it obviously didn't work.  I even tried to play it on my computer DVD drive and the disk ejected immediately and would not read",1521936000,,466,4.5

I tried this one disk and would have ordered others if the quality level was better, but this one was enough to stop me.",1385337600,,270,3.9272727272727272
