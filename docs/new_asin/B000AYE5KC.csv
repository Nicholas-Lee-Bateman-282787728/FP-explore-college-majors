Dear Sirs:

I am writing this letter to urge you to release the 1982 NBC mini-series Marco Polo starring Ken Marshall on DVD. Although this excellent mini-series won two Emmys (Outstanding Limited Series and Outstanding Costume Design for a Limited Series or Special) and was nominated for at least five others (Film Sound Editing, Art Direction, Cinematography, Film Editing and Outstanding Individual Achievement - Creative Special Achievement), it has never been released on DVD or VHS for the North American market.
When you do decide to release this mini-series on DVD, please restore and re-master the original, un-cut, un-edited version that aired on NBC. I'd really appreciate it if you could include the original NBC promotional trailers as well.

Many thanks,

Your name and

The more letters that are sent, the sooner we will see this mini-series restored and re-mastered on DVD.
If it worked for ""North and South"", it can work for this mini-series as well.",1315785600,2,1574,5.436213991769547
8080646,4,B000AYE5KC,"This is one of the most beautiful series that I saw in the 80s, it is a classic.
I got this DVD from a Dutch distributor years ago because Amazon, Warner or NBC have not done anything about issuing this series back then and it cost me then 50 euros. Thus this DVD is European region 2 PAL DVD, therefore if you live in Canada or USA you have to download DVD Free Region to be able to play it in your PC. Quality is not great but you cannot get the VHS tapes nor tape the series because is not in TV or cable at least in Canada, thus believe me this is better than nothing and cheaper that what I paid years ago. I have already waited 20 years, do you want to wait another 20 years to see if they wake up and make it better; that it is your call. There is other version for Canada/USA also in Amazon: Marco Polo (473 Minutes. 3-DVD Box & Ken Marshall, Denholm Elliott, Anne Bancroft, Burt Lancaster) (1982). ASIN: B001190SGK. I do not know the quality, but according to the comments the quality is average like this one but once again better than nothing.
It is a shame that they are not bringing this into a better quality but at least we have it now. Welcome back Marco Polo.
Warner Home Video issued the DVD in 2009 in Italy but not in this continent, shame on them:

8080647,3,B000AYE5KC,"I recently purchased this item from an Asian source. While not state of the art it is certainly serviceable. ( From the reviews I've read I'm thankful I did not choose the European version.)  It comes in 3 discs and while the first disc has some minor ghosting in a night scene and some graininess in a few other spots, the other 2 discs look fine AND the price was right (24.99 on Ebay however I haven't seen it's availability lately.) The series itself appears to be complete so once you navigate  the asian menu (not difficult) you should enjoy it as much, if not more, than the initial NBC showing.",1183248000,,602,4.414414414414415
8080648,1,B000AYE5KC,"The one star is for this rendering, not the series itself.

First of all, yes.  This is the NBC mini-series that came out in, I think, 1982, with Ken Marshall in the leading role.  It also features smaller roles by the likes of Leonard Nimoy, Denholm Elliot, Anne Bancroft, John Gielgud, F. Murray Abraham, and others.

I immensely enjoyed this series when it first aired and have desperately been trying to find it on DVD (or even VHS) for years.  And now Amazon suddenly pops up with this.

Folks, don't buy it, as I did -- sight unseen.  I don't know when the series will be released in the States on DVD, but you should wait until then.  You'll be sorry if you jump the gun by buying this one.

On the bright side, you are indeed getting the show.  But that's about it:  certainly more than what you probably had before.

But the quality of the DVD is WORSE than video disks!  The dialogue is about a full second miscued to the images, the picture is cropped AND distorted, there are no subtitles save in Dutch, and the whole thing has a bleached and blighted look.

You would have to be truly desperate to settle for this trashy version.  Is it even legal?  Who gave permission for this to be issued?  Why only in the Netherlands?  Etc., etc.

You've been warned.

UPDATE:  One's finally come out that was given a somewhat better treatment, though people are still complaining about the transfer quality.  It's Amazon ASIN: B0019LZ19Y, but only on their UK website, which is where I had to buy it from.  You're still gonna groan, but it's worlds better than this Dutch one.",1168819200,9,1578,4.47887323943662
8080649,5,B000AYE5KC,"I loved this story when it was originally broadcast by NBC in 1982.  The costumes and sets were very nicely done, the location shots were breath taking, and the big name stars scattered throughout the program made it very enjoyable to watch.

I cannot understand why this has never been released in the U.S.A., in any format.

Recently I purchased this show from a Greek source. I don't know if that is different, except for the packaging, than the Netherlands release. It is in the PAL format, but a ""Progressive Scan"" DVD player will play the show on a US TV.  I'M DISAPPOINTED WITH THE TRANSFER!  THE QUALITY, VISUAL AND AUDIO, IS POOR. THE NBC NARRATION IS MISSING AT THE BEGINNING. THE NORMAL BREAKS FOR COMMERCIALS HAVE BEEN CUT OUT IN A VERY UNPROFESSIONAL MANNER.

HELLO? NBC, get your act together and offer this show to Region 1 in a high QUALITY manner!

From the images shown during the opening credits and elsewhere, it is obvious that much of the filmed story was not shown in the U.S. I have always wanted to see the parts that were left out. I assumed they were used for international versions of the program. I was wrong. The promotional scenes at the start of each broadcast are chopped out in the R 2 PAL set I recently purchased. Very sloppy work!

My only complaints about the show are 1) the music becomes tiresome with constant repetition; 2) the color key is off: it is too red / amber - reversal of Cyan.",1138579200,17,1429,4.4903474903474905
