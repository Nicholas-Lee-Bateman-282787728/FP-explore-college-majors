7997343,3,B0000AINNM,"I thought the movie perpetuates all the bad stereotypes of teen years rather than portrays a great message, but does tell the story of a Faustian bargain.",1412812800,,154,4.7407407407407405
7997344,5,B0000AINNM,It was greater than expected. I loved how informative it was. I cannot wait to reread this fascinating work again.,1361836800,,114,4.75
7997345,5,B0000AINNM,"Something about this movie just struck me as terribly awesome. The acting isn't top-tier. The story is a bit funny and directed mostly at teenagers with huge dreams. Though overall it just struck me as something I had to watch multiple times. Some scenes are pretty funny.
IF you like Cheesy movies that are good in a bad way, you'll enjoy this one.",1346889600,2,349,4.555555555555555
7997346,1,B0000AINNM,"In our media saturated environment the message of Faust is still timely--big promises, big price.  I like to use film clips to help my students understand archetypes and how they might recognize them in film and print. This film will not be one I can use, it bordered on just being silly.",1231200000,,288,4.538461538461538
7997347,5,B0000AINNM,"I REALLY LIKED THIS DVD,BECAUSE IT IS JUST SUCH A NICE INNOCENT PLOT,KEEPS YOU INTERESTED,NICE DRY COMEDY,ALSO FOR NOT VERY WELL KNOWN ACTORS I THINK THEY DID VERY WELL ACTING JOBS.I JUST WANTED TO KEEP WATCHING, NO SLOWNES TO THE MOVIE. WOULD BE A GREAT FAMILY MOVIE FOR ALL AGES. THE MOVIE IS ABOUT A YOUNG NERDY BOY THAT SO DESPERATLY WANTS TO BE POPULAR AND GET HIS DREAM GIRL TO NOTICE HIM AND DATE HIM,SO HE MADE A DEAL WITH THE DEVILS HELPER,AND AFTER THE DEAL HE IS POPULAR,BUT IT MIGHT NOT BE WHAT HE WANTED AFTER ALL. NO REAL VIOLENCE, IF YOU LIKE COMEDIC
INNOCENT FAMILY ORIENTED MOVIES BUY IT! BAM FROM SASKATCHEWAN,CANADA",1069113600,6,634,4.521739130434782
7997348,4,B0000AINNM,"I just watched this movie about a half hour ago. I thought it was a funny movie, a newish not very known comedy. The plot is simple and humorous. The actors are very good and overall I just plainly thought it was a good comedy to watch!!",1058140800,6,237,4.0638297872340425
