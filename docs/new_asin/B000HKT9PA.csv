8140227,5,B000HKT9PA,"Right now the current price of this 2 sided dvd offered by International Coffee And Books is $5,505.59.  Obviously this is a no brainer.  Pick it up!  This is two COMPLETE films on one dvd that you can view over and over again in the comfort of your own home!  Unbelievable!  Once you view one film you can flip the disc and view the other, and when that film is over you can flip the disc again and watch the first film and repeat as often as you like.  You can do this for the rest of your life if you wish!  That's a lifetime of creepy entertainment for ONLY $5,505.59!  What are you waiting for?  Stop reading and start spending!

UPDATE May 19th, 2014:Price: $7,131.27!!!  You shoulda bought it yesterday!!!  Still worth it.

UPDATE May 20th, 2014:Price: $9,329.36!!!  Only 2 left in stock!!!  Hurry up before they're gone!!!

UPDATE May 21st, 2014:Price: $10,000.00!!!  Raise the rent on your Boardwalk and Park Place properties and buy this dvd immediately!!!

UPDATE June 6th, 2014:Price dropped to $22.77.  I don't want it anymore.

UPDATE June 21st, 2014:Price now $149.20.  Sounds like these movies are getting stronger.  I regret not buying this dvd on May 21st when it was $10,000.00.  It must have been really good back then.  I'll check back in a few days to see if it gets any better.

UPDATE June 24th, 2014:Price has increased to $294.00.  I would like to see it hit at least $7,032.49 before the end of the month.  Until then I'm not even considering it.  I'm also concerned that this dvd is being offered by International Coffee & Books.  Can a seller that specializes in coffee and books successfully tap into the dvd business as well?  I guess time will tell.  I remember stopping at a gas station on a road trip one time and the attendant offered to sell me a soda.  ""No thanks, buddy, I'm just here for gas."", I told him, ""I'll get my soda up the road from the soda shop where they actually know how to sell the stuff.  And I'll make sure I pay a lot for it because I only buy the best.""  Strange world we live in.

UPDATE June 25th, 2014:Price has increased to $351.74.  Is this thing ever going to make it to $7,032.49?  C'mon, International Coffee And Books, learn how to sell a dvd!

UPDATE July 1st, 2014:Price increased to $1,197.29.  This is sounding a little more interesting to me, but I'm still not sure if it's worth it.  Has anybody tried the coffee or books from International Coffee And Books?  Maybe I should sample something they actually know how to sell before considering buying a dvd from them.  Last time I checked I didn't have to grind up a dvd and drink it or turn its pages to enjoy it.  I hope these fools don't expect me to grind up my coffee in my dvd player.

UPDATE July 15th, 2014: We're finally back up to TEN-THOUSAND DOLLARS!!!  I love this ish!",1400371200,5,2803,4.441814595660749
8140228,5,B000HKT9PA,"For all you Anthony Perkins fans out there who are trying to find a decent copy of ""How Awful About Allan"", you have found the right place!  I have bought 3 different issues of this movie and have found this particular one to be the best in picture and sound. You can't beat it for the price. It's nice to know that when a company states the DVD has been ""digitally remastered"", it really has been and you can notice a big difference!  How ironic that the best transfer of this movie can be obtained for the least amount of money. As an added bonus, there is another movie on the reverse of the disc, ""Murder Mansion"".",1346112000,3,618,4.273504273504273
8140229,5,B000HKT9PA,This is a two sided CD.  How about Allen was not so hot.  The acting in the Murder Mansion was a lot better.  of course as you role the years back things seem to be spookier than they are today.,1204243200,,194,3.8
