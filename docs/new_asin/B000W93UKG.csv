2963488,5,B000W93UKG,My neighbor here in Connecticut is William Larrabure - His credits on this movie are Producer & Director of Photography. The DVD was just a quick film transfer with no digital corrections --  It has the look of film including the dust and scratches. However after several minutes you can ignore them and enjoy the movie. I gave my copy of Black Fist to Mr Larrabure and will be ordering another. I purchased this version because the cover photo used on the jewel case was of the original movie poster.,1203984000,,501,4.566666666666666
2963489,3,B000W93UKG,"I watched this low budget ""blaxploitation"" movie from a DVD set that also included three other blaxploitation films. The story is that of a younger black man(Fisk) who lives in a dirty and dangerous part of town. One day, he is given an opportunity by Mr Logan(the local mob leader), to make a whole lot of cash by kicking some booty in street fighting contests. After becoming mildly successful, he is shaken down by Hienrick(a dirty cop). Already stressed by the business of fighting, once he discovers that his whino friend has been murdered, he decides that he wants out. Of course, that comes with a price. So one day, when his best friend is about to take Fisk's wife home, the car suddenly explodes and kills both of them. So now Fisk is after Mr. Logan, Hienrick, and whoever else he felt that was involved in the murdering of his wife and best friend. The movie is shot entirely on location(in the seedier areas of Los Angeles); so the ambiance of the movie feels gritty and realistic. Although a low budget flick, the acting is realistic and intense. I found the dialogue to be racially realistic. The movie, being a 70's low budget flick, looks and sounds grainy. The ending, I found, is quite disappointing. Overall an enjoyable movie experience if you can find the movie on DVD for under $10 dollars.

Update - This movie is available in other low-budget DVD packs. Try the Martial Arts 50 movie pack.",1117497600,2,1414,4.633466135458168

2963498,1,B000W93UKG,I also remember seeing the original movie back in the 70's and it was named Bogard and had an X-rating. I really liked the movie even though it was low budget. This movie was terrible on picture and sound quality. Not only was it dirty and grainy looking. The sound was awful and scratchy. Their also was a steamy part in the original movie where Lawson made love to a white woman (which i think why it was originally rated X) which was cut out. I didn't enjoy it at all and don't think they should have wasted their time putting this on a DVD. The editing was also terrible and with the non-rated version the curse words have been mute out frequently with no sound. I don't know if the R rating is any better but I don't want to risk it. I also don't know what equipment they used  to transfer this movie to DVD but it was poor. Seems like a VCR taped in the lowest quality mode. I will read these reviews from now on.,1362355200,3,919,4.134078212290503

8221806,2,B000W93UKG,"Leroy Fisk (Richard Lawson) goes to work as a street fighter for Logan (Robert Burr), back when the first rule of fight club was to let everybody know so they can pay to gamble. Leroy becomes successful and catches the eye of Policeman Heineken played by Dabney Coleman a character actor we love to hate (Franklin M. Hart Jr. ""9 to 5""). Heineken shakes him down for money. When Leroy can't get out, he fights back.

The acting was bad as was the restoration of my copy. Some good fist throwing, but not much plot.
