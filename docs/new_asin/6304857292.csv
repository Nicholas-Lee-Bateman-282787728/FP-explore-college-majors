7878262,4,6304857292,This movie is NOT AS STATED. The 1968 movie Golden Swallow by director Chang Cheh with Ceng Pei-Pei is a different film than this one which was actually made in 1988. It is a film worth watching and does star Cherie Chung but is not the 1968 movie I thought I was getting.,1255046400,2,272,4.150943396226415
7878263,5,6304857292,"While the theme of this movie is not new, I must say that this movie is a classic and stands on its own as it is Asian Movie Queen Ivy Ling Po's final movie before her retirement. Indeed she breaks out of her usual famous male impersonator roles to play an evil witch with great expertise surpassing the evil spirit in A Chinese Ghost Story. The female ghost as played by Cherie Chung flies around beautifully and is less of a wimp than the Joey Wong character in A Chinese Ghost Story. So, do give this movie a chance even though the familiar theme of scholar falling in love with female ghost has been put on celluloid since the 50s.",1202342400,2,635,4.3
7878264,2,6304857292,This show is similar to A chinese ghost story but the former is not as good as the latter. The story and fighting moves are very badly done. Strictly for Cherie Chung's fans.,1033084800,2,174,4.303030303030303
