It is very sad to know how corrupt the government is, how free speech within the United States media is just an illusion (you'll notice a reoccurring true life theme of how those journalists who exposed government corruption were always blackballed in their media careers and harassed by the government), AND have a close up into what some people would do to their own neighborhoods and families for money.

Not only do I highly recommend both the 1st and 2nd season DVDs but I would want every single American to view it. I WOULD REALLY URGE PARENTS TO VIEW THESE DVDs WITH THEIR CHILDREN (probably ages 13-17). These documentaries are that important!

3133186,4,B0014FAIV6,"American Gangster - Second Season - moves along with more stories
from modern America, that most peoplehave no idea about, never mind
those living in Europe. Here, we are dealing with criminology.

One of the episodes covers Rayful Edmonds III, suggesting he was a
kind of Mama's Boy, taking the lessons of his parents trafficking
diet pills mixed with heroin, but taking the ball the running with
it and creating his own empire. His business model involved
retailing crack in $25 doses across Washington, DC, sourced through
Grisela Blanco's son, Chiquito from Medellin, Colombia.

The story is one of impunity, and monumental levels of missing
scruples, not unlike Mount Everest, the outcome of which was over
400 homicides over a span of 10 years, with 100 being a special
number. There were 100 kg of cocaine per month and USD $100 million
in sales per week. The time period told is the mid-1980's to the
mid-1990's.

We all know of the strategic importance of the Panama Canal. Well.
comparably important, were the strip alley around Hanover Place,
used as escape routes from police operations. He overwhelmed
Cornell Jones' own modest retail  operations for high-end narcotics
consumers, with a general market approach, the outcome of which was
a skyrocketed rate of homelessness, home invasions, strawberries,
citizens inability in holding a job, etc.

Even more reprehensible is the flamboyance of the kingpin,
demonstrated by the largest chrome rims on his luxury Mercedes Benz
or SUV, gold jewelry, designer clothes, showing up at NBA games,
all the while having a finger in every pie, such as machine gun
driveby shootings, molotov cocktails thrown, deaths, turf wars,
etc.

Now under a WPP, Edmonds III rolled over, taking part in a
successive number  of sting operations. As a result, many if not
all his business associates are behind bars, with 10 or 20 year
sentences, with airtight cases, while a select few of his choice,
including himself are free as a bird.

Originally, wiretaps and video surveillance had not proven its
mettle. Today, 10% of Washington DC residents hold a judicial
record, many of those felons are attributable to Edmonds
operations.",1280620800,,2172,5.081460674157303
