OK to start Ms Gilbert should NOT be in the cover as she has like 3 minutes in the whole movie, besides that the whole movie is just plain awful I knew there where B movies but I would rate this one as a D or lower movie!",1268179200,2,371,3.7088607594936707

8181165,5,B0009VXMNM,"This movie is a lot of fun to watch.  Beautiful women every other moment with an interesting plot thrown in at no extra charge.  It provides many jabs at the go-go greed attitude of the 90's and shows the lengths people will go to succeed (heart ripping sacrifices, anyone).  It all ties up nicely with a great twist at the end.",1124150400,5,328,4.344262295081967
