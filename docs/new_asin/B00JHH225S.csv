6358534,3,B00JHH225S,"This is a very formulaic movie about a girl with big dreams for a career that suddenly makes it big one day, only to find out it may not be all it is cooked up to be. This particular movie was fairly well done with nice scenery, good actors and fairly watchable storyline. In this version of the tried and true tale, a number of characters who seem like they will be unlikable and cruel end up being decent people and hopeful models. The background for this story is an internet social media company and it seems to be set in a moderately sized east coast city. In spite of all of the good things about this movie, there was something about it that made me feel somewhat uncomfortable while watching it. I'm not quite sure what it was, but the movie left me feeling like I hadn't seen anything new or memorable. If you are looking for a tame feel-good story, you might like this movie. Just don't expect anything innovative.",1445644800,2,924,4.377906976744186

8650953,3,B00JHH225S,"Eh.  I've seen MUCH better movies than this made by Hallmark.  I'm not sure that I believe in the romance between the two main characters.  The guy, I absolutely believe that he's been in love with her their whole friendship and she's been totally oblivious.  But once it's finally brought to her attention..........she's literally never thought of him that way before.  Now, if it was the other way around, the girl in love with a guy, I could believe him changing his mind.  But I'm a woman, I know how we work.  The first time a woman meets a man, she considers all the possibilities of him as a potential partner and mate.  Even if she's not immediately attracted to him.  Sometimes the feelings do grow later if the woman hasn't completely thrown the idea out after knowing him for longer than an hour or two.  These two have been friends for YEARS and she's never even rolled the idea around in her brain before?  He's a young, smart, talented, attractive guy.  I think something is very wrong with her since she never considered him as relationship material before!  I'm good with this as a one time watch.  I didn't hate it but I didn't really like it much either.",1485907200,,1172,4.519047619047619
