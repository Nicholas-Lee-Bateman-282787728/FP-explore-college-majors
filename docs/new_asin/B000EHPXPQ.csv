8109726,2,B000EHPXPQ,"The ""gimics"" part of this DVD is the more interesting part, which actually tells you how real card shark cheat with gimics such as various types of card clips. But the sleights bit is a bit too common if you have background knowledge on manipulations such as the pass and differenet types of partial or full control false shuffle, false deal etc. Overall this worth 4 stars as a basic introduction, but 2 stars for those who have prior knowledge on card magic and manipulations.",1172102400,3,478,4.635294117647059
8109727,5,B000EHPXPQ,"For serious poker players, this is one product that is worth the money. So many players have no idea of the ways they can get taken advantage of.  Finally we are provided with a product that shows us what to look out for.  Any serious player would not blink an eye at the price tag, but consider it a necessary investment. After viewing the DVD I stratched my head and realized how easy it could be for someone to bust a move on the uneducated player. Not now!  Our wake up call is here.  Study this before you buy into another game!",1168387200,5,533,4.196078431372549
