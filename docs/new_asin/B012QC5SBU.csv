8726459,1,B012QC5SBU,I bought this for $9.96 and it is still a rip-off!  There's actually only one Chuck Connor movie in here and only 2 with Segal! There's one with Michelle Yeough who is a great martial arts fighter but there are at least 20 movies no one would ever care to see ever again! Don't buy it!!,1470096000,,286,4.107142857142857
8726460,1,B012QC5SBU,"Misleading title!! Looking at the cover, my first thought was it was a near complete collection of Stephen Seagal movies, right? No! Only one movie in this collection, RUSLAN, even has him in it. The Chuck Norris side only has 3 movies with him in it. The rest are all B, or made for tv movies that you probably never heard of. Thankfully, I picked this movie up out of the $5.00 bin at a truckstop, and used free points for that so I didn't waste any money on it.",1468108800,,464,4.166666666666667
8726461,1,B012QC5SBU,"Horrible. It says 25 movies featuring Steven Seagal and or Chuck Norris. Well, only 3 movies have Chuck Norris, and only 1 has Steven Seagal. So you end up with 4 sub-par movies and 21 no name movies. It's a sweetheart deal folks!

Also, don't pay too much. As of January 15, 2016 this movie set is in your local Walmart's $5 movie bin.",1453507200,,336,4.25
