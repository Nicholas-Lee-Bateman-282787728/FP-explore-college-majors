8589513,1,B00076YPMQ,"This was one of the worse instructional DVD or tapes I have ever bought, and I have at least 40. I thought I was getting a ""rock"" instructional tape and it was everything but. One lesson was a spanish melody in which he suggest it has rock sounds. It doesn't. I was waiting for some bull fight to take place! He does another little riff and says it's a Jimmi Hendrix sound. Ah, NO ITS NOT!! It's not a good instructional tape period!",1243987200,2,433,4.228915662650603
