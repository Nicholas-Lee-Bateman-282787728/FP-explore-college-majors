2835589,5,B000QCU51G,Great addition to my workout videos. I own several videos by Leslie Sansome.  Just started jogging and this is a great introduction!,1362960000,,132,5.0
2835590,5,B000QCU51G,"I thought I already reviewed this, but anyhow, I love this, if you only have 15-20 minutes and need a cardio work out pop this sucker in.  There's no frills or anything just running with a few circuits such as knee lifts, swinging legs side to side.  I love Leslie!  But be warned if you are use to her walking tapes do not attempt this unless you are really ready to run.  I wish she would make more jogging tapes like a 2 mile or 3 mile to build upon this routine.  I guess most of her fan base enjoy the walking, but Leslie you got girls out here that want to run too!  Oh I forgot there is another workout on here too I think it's toning your thighs or something with bands maybe?  I can't really review that because I never done it due to the fact it's a bit too old fashioned for me.",1344902400,9,789,3.9872611464968153
2835591,5,B000QCU51G,I think this is a great video.  The music is not so great but I use my Ipod with it.  This gets me sweating and feeling great.  I think you will enjoy this.,1297641600,,156,3.6666666666666665
2835592,4,B000QCU51G,"I have purchased several of Leslie Sansone's DVDS. I think she's great. However, I purchased this DVD and inside it said you would receive a free 6 month membership for her walk club. I was thrilled. Then I tried to type the website and go to the club. The link would not work, I tried a few times. Then I went to her website, found the link, only to have them ask me for a password....  I emailed the contact info and was given the response... ""Sorry, that offer has expired."" End of story.
There was no expiration date whatsoever.  So folks... Don't bother wasting your time trying to sign up.",1270944000,5,595,4.351351351351352
2835593,5,B000QCU51G,"I love all Leslie's work-outs. Indeed, I don't know how I would survive without them. This one, however, is great for those days when you feel you must do something even though you have an exceptionally busy day.  It has the feel of two miles.  Give it your all and you will work up quite a sweat and won't feel so darn guilty that you didn't find that time for the two or three mile.",1215129600,4,384,4.1066666666666665
2835594,5,B000QCU51G,I have several workout dvd's.  And this one is perfect for me.  It only takes 15 minutes out of your day and I feel great.,1211155200,,122,3.84
2835595,2,B000QCU51G,"I've used and enjoyed many of Leslie's tapes. I particularly like the one-mile tapes as I've found them to be a great way to work in some exercise -- either early or later in the day. The main problem with this tape, which Leslie does unaccompanied by other pros or amateurs, (no weights are used either) is that:

1) The ""music"" is really unpleasant; it is just fast noise. It really doesn't have a beat to which you can move naturally.

2) There is no adequate warm-up or cool-down.

3) The DVD is in a small fitted case, no bigger than the dvd, which makes it hard to store with other DVDs.

If you're looking for a good quick workout, I'd recommend the following two from her Walk Away the Pounds series: 1) Power Mile; 2) Get Up and Get Started (I have this on DVD with the two-mile High Calorie Burn).",1203984000,14,807,4.2894736842105265
2835596,5,B000QCU51G,"For those like me who just hate aerobics classes, Leslie Sansone's Walk Away the Pounds videos have been great.  Easy steps and a great work out for someone like me who is not yet slim and trim.  I really love the encouragement from Leslie along the way.  Some people don't but I do!  :)",1196640000,13,287,4.2592592592592595
8195719,1,B000QCU51G,Dvd would be great if it worked. When I opened up dvd it was all sticky. Disgusting and disappointing!!!,1487808000,,104,4.526315789473684
8195720,5,B000QCU51G,Love this video.  Love that there are many to chose from and you cant go wrong with Leslie!,1472947200,,91,4.055555555555555
8195721,3,B000QCU51G,I would have enjoyed doing more of the boosted walking/jogging in thi set. The walking one was too close to many other of hers that I have BUT. It is a good workout nonetheless.,1471132800,,177,4.235294117647059
8195722,5,B000QCU51G,Helps me to stay fit,1435795200,,20,3.2
8195723,4,B000QCU51G,"a little too much about the actual boosters - i felt like they were trying to market them thru this video, but in general i like Ms. Sansone's cheerful way of conducting the 1 Mile",1425340800,,180,4.171428571428572
8195724,5,B000QCU51G,I just received this DVD and used it already.  I really enjoyed it.  I love working out with Leslie Sansone.  Thank you!,1392508800,,120,4.363636363636363
8195725,5,B000QCU51G,"Workout is for anyone, regardless of fitness level!! Anyone can do it.  I have many Leslie Sansone workout DVD's.  This one just ads to my collection.",1379721600,,150,4.730769230769231
8195726,3,B000QCU51G,"I did like the Leslie jogging DVD although she did not have a cool off, only a warm up. It ended abruptly. The 2nd DVD in the (sealed) case was sticky on the back and did not play. Very unhappy with that.",1378857600,,204,3.880952380952381
8195727,3,B000QCU51G,"Don't get me wrong, I REALLY like Leslie Sansone's workouts. I really like this workout also, but I already have it. The mile jog is a repeat of a previous DVD she put out a few years ago. She has just attached it to a mile boosted walking tape. The workouts are solid, easy to follow and have worked for me. I'm just a bit disgruntled about her repackaging a mile jog workout without a heads up. I would have gotten one of her other workouts if I had known. I will probably resell this one. I don't need two of the same workout.",1377302400,3,529,4.096153846153846
8195728,5,B000QCU51G,"I've only done the 1-mile jog, not the walk.  The jog is definitely a work-out!  I'm sweating, winded, and beet-red by the end of it.  It's good for days when you're low on time but want to get some sort of cardio in.  Definitely not intense but it'll get you sweating and get your heart pumping!",1370736000,,296,4.232142857142857
