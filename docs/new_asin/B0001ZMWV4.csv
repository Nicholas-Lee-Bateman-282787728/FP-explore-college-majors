8018895,4,B0001ZMWV4,"I bought this serial not really expecting anything great. I was never a reader of the Smilin' Jack strip, but I'm a great fan of Keye Luke, Turhan Bey, Philip Ahn and Sidney Toler, so I figured a serial with all these actors in it can't be all bad. And it's not bad at all! The print is so-so, but better than I'd expected. Rose Hobart makes a really nasty villainess, while Turhan Bey couldn't be nasty if his life depended on it! Sidney Toler was his usual fake-Asian self. As for the real Asians, Keye Luke and Philip Ahn, I often wonder what went through their minds playing opposite Caucasians who were supposed to be Asian. Never mind. . .it was a fun serial. Too bad they didn't do more.",1422835200,,694,4.305343511450381
8018896,4,B0001ZMWV4,"""Adventures of Smilin' Jack"" is a 13-chapter Universal serial released in 1943, directed by Ray Taylor and Lewis D. Collins, based on the newspaper feature created by Zack Moseley.

The story takes place in 1941, and involves a secret route between China and India, vital to China's defense and known only to Mah Ling (Cyril Delevanti), governor of Mandon Province through which it passes.  ""Smilin' Jack"" Martin (Tom Brown), who has been helping his friend, Captain Wing (Keye Luke) in China's war with Japan, gets involved in obtaining Mah Ling's cooperation in revealing the route for China, and negotiating the release of another friend, Tommy Thompson (Edgar Barrier), imprisoned in Mandon while investigating the route for the Australian Secret Service.  Mah Ling wants guarantees from the countries involved that the road will be closed after the war, since his people value the peace of their isolated existence over the commerce such a road would bring.  The Japanese try to keep China from getting the secret, and Jack is soon battling agents of the Order of the Black Samurai, led by Kageyama (Turhan Bey) but whose orders come from Berlin, through Frulein von Teufel (Rose Hobart), posing as Gertrude Miller, a war correspondent and friend of Thompson's sister, Janet (Marjorie Lord).

Little was used from the original comic strip other than the title character, and it might have helped if Jack's flying skills had been suggested with a few air battles.  Still, the cast is fine, with good acting, by serial movie standards.  The main cast also includes Sidney Toler as the Chinese General Kai Ling, and Philip Ahn as Wu Tan, assisting Mah Ling.  In smaller roles are several familiar faces from 'B' movies and serials, including Grace Cunard, Nigel De Brulier, Wheeler Oakman, Edward Peil Sr., Stanley Blystone, William Forrest and James Craven.  While the need for Mah Ling to travel great distances to get yet another signature is a weak primary plot mover, the story is filled out with some imaginative subplots.  Less emphasis is placed on fist fights than on chase scenes, but there's plenty of action, and the musical score, under the direction of Hans J. Salter is a distinct improvement over what Universal had been using.  Unfortunately the special effects did not improve.  The parachuting against a rear-screen projection at the end of the first chapter is less convincing than the similar cliffhanger in the 1931 Mascot serial ""The Galloping Ghost,"" and in Chapter Seven the motionless model submarine getting rammed in a fish aquarium, first seen in ""Don Winslow of the Navy"" is made even worse by preceding it with stock footage of a real submarine, diving rapidly.  But these things are expected in Universal's serials, and part of the joys of watching them.

Most Universal serials from this era seem to exist only in poorly copied 16mm reduction prints.  Those for this serial may have been made for use during the war, and have the original Universal titles rather than being from a Filmcraft or other reissue, with sharpness and gray scale somewhat better than is often the case.

Alpha's DVD edition is in two volumes, #s ALP 4408D and ALP 4409D, or both shrinkwrapped as # 9531D.  The image is a little unsharp, especially noticed in the corners during the titles.  There are minor scratches and some dirt, possibly copied faithfully when the reduction print was made, and while grain and video noise are not much of a problem on a smaller screen they are quite evident when magnified.  Gray scale isn't as bad as might be feared, with only occasional momentary burn-out of highlights.  The chapters start abruptly with some roughness for the first few seconds of the titles, and as expected from a reduction print the cast list is a little too wide for the screen.  Chapter Eight is missing a 20-second piece that, on VCI's videotape, had the film slipping past the gate, probably due to sprocket-hole damage, though its omission causes only a minor plot disruption.  A video head switching glitch is seen near the bottom of the frame, cutting through the MPPDA certificate numbers and other small print of the titles.  The sound has only a small amount of noise, and while there is a little distortion in some of the dialogue, the words are easy enough to understand.  Alpha's logo doesn't appear during the credits since this is an older release, and while it remains a two-disc edition it will likely continue to be on normal ""pressed"" DVD's.

VCI's old VHS tape, # 1701 was from a different video master, but possibly the same film print, with picture and sound quality similar to Alpha's.  The framing is a little better, with the head-switch point below the small print in the credits, and some chapters are a little sharper, but there is more tendency for the highlights to burn out, enough to cause some blank faces.

Sinister Cinema has this serial, available through their website, on two single-layer DVD-R discs.  Chapter Eight has the 20-second piece that is missing from Alpha's DVD, and without the transfer problems in VCI's videotape.  The image is somewhat sharper than the others, with slightly better gray scale.  The only negatives, aside from the use of ""burned"" media, are a few minor video dropouts -- white horizontal lines that briefly appear through the picture -- and a ""logo,"" a small ""SC"" in the lower-right corner of the frame, for about the first three minutes of Chapter One.

The source prints are a little rough, but Alpha's picture and sound are better than many video releases of Universal's war-propaganda serials.  The weakness of the basic plot is too obvious if more than a couple chapters are watched without a break; the subplots and good performances of the cast are best enjoyed with a day or more between them.",1371513600,2,5793,4.90974358974359
8018897,5,B0001ZMWV4,"Except for technical advances in movie making and the dubious additions of sex and ""sophistication"", no James Bond or Indiana Jones has a thing on Smilin Jack. A WWII/Far East spy thriller it spans the globe, several changes in setting and types of action( planes, ships, subs, hotels, water front) giving freshness and suspense to each unfolding episode. Imagine Southeast Asia war zone without the WWII famed Burma Road, then imagine the highpriests of Nepal or Tibet( with a fictional name,) knowing the existence  of a real but secret version of such a road, then the obvious espianoge  from both  Japan and China( with Nazis male and female thrown in) and you have Smilin Jack's enemies. Throw in beautiful heroine and stout Brits and Ausies plus Charlie Chan and sons Chinese types as friends and you have the cast. The world's highest mountains, the China Clipper, Hong Kong and various warfs, luxury hotels, water front dives and bamboo houses give this epic serial all the old James Bond flavor. All this plus clean, family ok dialogue that tells the tale quite dramatically, thank you. And your kids will love the air planes and cars. all WWII vintage and just what is now meant by ""the greatest generation""",1319760000,,1217,4.869565217391305
8018898,4,B0001ZMWV4,"Movies, radio and especially comic books during World War II were not polite to the Germans or Japanese.  Members of the Axis powers were depicted as ""Krauts,"" ""Nips,"" and ""Japs.""  Somehow, Italians were not included.  American super heroes battled the Axis and won--every time.  The ""Japs"" wore round spectacles with thick lens, had buck teeth and lemon-yellow faces.  The ""Krauts"" oftn had monacles and clicked their bootheels a lot.

This serial is part of that peculiar ethos, although it wasn't possible to have Japanese with lemon-yellow skin in a black and white film.  As such, this isn't bad at all.  There's a great deal of piloting and war footage to lend some reality.  The plot is simple, as one might expect.  Jack gets into an impossible tight spot or two in every episode and manages to get out of them at the beginning of the next episode.  There are the usual fistfights, a nice looking young woman or so, and nasty villains who want to destroy everything that is goodness and light.  Even Charlie Chan and his number one son are along for the ride--but playing different characters.

I did enjoy this serial.  As serials go, it was one of the better ones.",1188864000,,1174,4.719211822660099
8018899,3,B0001ZMWV4,"If, like me and a devoted base of hardcore fans, you love the old movie serials of the 1930's and 40's,  you'll gladly overlook the mediocre sound and image quality displayed here for a chance to see the famous comic strip hero fly once again. Companies like Alpha Video (who released this and other classiscs like Radar Men on the Moon and the marvelous Phantom Creeps with Bela Lugosi) and VCI (Terry and the Pirates, Captain Midnight) have done fans like us a great service by preserving these otherwise lost treasures. Be warned though, that little care has been taken to improve decaying film quality; these are not the lush digital restorations we see in the Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto movies-- blemishes, cue blips, acid rot, sync discrepancies and poor sound are the norm here. If the content interests, you, it's worth the dough, but keep your expectaions low.",1173312000,2,868,4.786666666666667
8018900,1,B0001ZMWV4,"After collecting serials over the years, finally, I have found the absolute worst one I ever purchased.  Granted, Universal Pictures was certainly not famous for their serials...the exceptions being:  Tim Tyler's Luck and Radio Patrol, just to name two of probably six or seven standouts, but this is the rock bottom.  In the hands of a William Witney, this could have been a fantastic work of art.  With all of the possibilities in plot and scenery at their disposal, the directors have bogged us down with boring attempts at action, acting and serial music.... plus  holes in the plot. What happened to all the set-ups we should have been entertained by at the various exotic locales?  What happened to fast-moving adventure and action foundations in serials?  What a waste!

Alpha Video's digital DVD restoration is terrible.  I actually have better quality on some older VHS serials in my collection.

A thoroughly disappointing experience for almost five hours of waiting for it to get off the ground.  Forget it!",1139616000,6,1018,5.0
8018901,5,B0001ZMWV4,"This was from Zack Mosley's popular comic strip, one of many tuned into a serial, and long thought to be lost.  Jack Martin is a daredevil pilot who gets involved in Far Eastern intrigue just before Pearl Harbor.  As played by Tom Brown (1913-1990) Jack no longer has his pencil-thin moustache and seems younger, but Brown does a commendable job here.

This is a very good cast.  Perhaps the most interesting casting is Sidney Toler and the great Keye Luke (""Secret Agent X-9,"" 1945), who played Charlie Chan and his number One Son in numerous movies.  Toler was concurrently playing Chan while appearing in this film as General Kai Ling.  Luke plays Captain Wing, who assists the general and bails Smilin' Jack out of many predicaments.  Marjorie Lord, later known for her role on TV's ""Make Room For Daddy,"" also helps Jack in his endeavors as Janet Thompson.

Rose Hobart is excellent at playing the evil Fraulein von Teufel off against her alter ego Rose Franklin, whom no one suspects.  Just as convincing is her agent Kageyama, played by the ultra suave Turhan Bey.  The sniping between the German and the Japanese agent is rather humorous.  Cyril Delavant almost steals the show as Mah Ling, the Chinese provincial governor whom both sides are trying to entice into revealing a vital wartime secret.  He even plays a double role with a small segment as a Japanese agent who will pretend to be him.  Mah Ling's loyal servent Wu Tan is played by long-time Asian actor Philip Ahn, and his role grows in importance as the plot progresses.

The plot seems to be more intelligent and well thought-out than is the case with many serials.  There are some great and unexpected twists and turns, getting one more emotionally involved than normal with a serial.  There's some pretty good archival footage taken early in WWII.  I also like Universal's method of prefacing each chapter with one or two new scenes which let us know what's happening before repeating the ending that led up to the cliffhanger, instead of using a written summary as Republic did or an annoying narrator as Columbia did.

Universal's great director Ford Beebe was the producer of this one.  Directors Ray Taylor and Lewis Collins had a chance with this to learn how to put together a good WWII spy flick, which may be why their ""Secret Agent X-9"" (1945) was so good.  And like that one, it has the look and feel of a feature movie rather than just a serial.  About all that separates this from the best Republic serials is more fights and better cliffhangers.",1136505600,5,2532,4.722095671981776
8018902,5,B0001ZMWV4,"This serial movie, both disks, volumes 1 and 2, are absolutely entertaining and well worth watching.
  Smilin' Jack Martin is a barn storming, old style action aviator whose love of flying is only surpassed by his love of adventure. In 'The Adventures of Smilin' Jack', Jack Martin encounters a centuries old secret that could help defeat the Japanese takeover of China. The secret is a hidden mountain path connecting China and India that would allow the resupply of China from India. Jack's adversary in the race to discover the secret passage over the mountains is the ruthless Fraulein Von Teufel, a Nazi spymaster from Hitler's war machine. The secret pass would provide a safe trade route for the Chinese, but the ancient people that protect it are not willing to give up their secret so easily. To defeat Smilin' Jack, the bloodthirsty Fraulein Von Teufel dispatches her Black Samurai to murder him and seize the passage. The Black Samurai are trained killers, dedicated to their cause and relentless in their attacks, using tricks, torture, and cunning in their attempts to kill Jack and his plans for opening the secret route.
  Despite its dated and politically incorrect use of caucasians to play the parts of many asian characters, notably the performance by Sidney Toler (of Charlie Chan fame), this is an adventure with continuous action and a cliffhanger that caps every 22-24 minute episode of this thirteen chapter serial.",1090800000,11,1439,5.033613445378151
