5949145,5,B00EXAXZVY,"For Doors fans like myself, who has collected everything The Doors since 1967, you will be thrilled with the release of The Doors R-Evolution! What is shown here for pre-order, is the U.K. release of this fantastic Blu-ray Deluxe Edition Set. The North American release will be on January 21, 2014.

This fantastic Doors history of their television appearances is being released in 4 different formats in both Europe and North America. For the European market version, which is shown here- being released earlier than the North American versions- you can choose from a Deluxe Set in either Blu-ray or regular dvd. The Deluxe Set includes a fantastic 40 page book that features a scrap book style presentation of each track including the song lyrics, photos, background information and trivia. This Deluxe Book Set comes in your choice of the Blu-ray or dvd versions. There will also be just the Blu-ray or dvd R-Evolution without the book for less money.

I'm certain many Doors fans, like myself, have seen some of The Doors television appearances over the years- even The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour Television Show- Season 3 dvd includes a couple of The Doors appearances, but nothing like what is included here on this set. This is not a complete history, as you will notice not every television performance or film is included, as I immediately noticed The Doors second song on the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour- Wild Child is not included, nor the famous Light My Fire from The Ed Sullivan Show. This is a history of The Doors Evolution on film appearances, as the title states, and not a complete history. Just seeing the Evolution of The Doors on film is wonderful enough, but it's the Bonus Material that make this worth watching. Included in this set are some very rare television appearances of The Doors, such as the band's full performance on Shebang, a Dick Clark interview, the color version of the band's appearance on Malibu U- including never before seen outtakes, and from German tv- the complete color version of Hello, I Love You. Besides television appearances over the years, you will also get to enjoy The Doors Films from the 80's, including a rare director's cut of the 1985 L.A.Woman short film.

There are Bonus Features that are simply fantastic as well. A new edit by Murray Lerner from the 1970 Isle Of Wight Festival is included, as well as the extremely rare 1966 Ford Motor Company film with The Doors providing the sound track. All the audio, with the exception of the Ford Motor Company film, has been restored by Bruce Botnick- The Doors long time engineer and co-producer of the last L.A. Woman album. There are 19 total television appearances and short films included on this simply fantastic set. Not only are the audios restored by Bruce Botnick, but I heard the videos have been restored fantastically as well!

Having these television appearances of The Doors finally complete with great audio and video restorations is a wish come true. My only other wish is that someone restores the Jim Morrison Highway film as well as The Doors Feast Of Friends film. I've waited decades for a good copy of these great short films and I really hope someone will bring them to dvd and hopefully Blu-ray soon for all of us Doors and Jim Morrison fans to enjoy as much as these television appearances! For now, I have to give a million THANKS to Eagle Rock Studios for all their hard work in bringing us Doors fans these fabulous television appearances and rarities- these are all MUST-HAVES for us Doors and Jim Morrison Fans!

Here are all 19 appearances and films included, and of course, the 40 page book is only included in the Deluxe Version.

collection.",1400457600,,137,3.892857142857143
5949175,5,B00EXAXZVY,"This DVD R-Evolution has Great Doors footage of their songs, Some I have seen before some I did not. I liked it overall but I thought it was still too short and more footage could of been added. The Doors are my favorite Rock band because they had a unique sound like no other band of that time. When you listen to a Doors album all the songs are enjoyable from the harder upbeat songs to the slower and mellow and poetic songs all are excellent. This creative style is so good that the Doors are a timeless band, They sound as good today as they did in the 1960s. I am 54 years old and I enjoy the Doors music now as much as I did when I was 16 years old, A great band from a better time nothing like that exists today nor ever will.",1400284800,2,734,3.9662162162162162
5949176,5,B00EXAXZVY,"Nothing new as far as material goes, especially if you are a huge Doors fan and have everything...but I still like the book that came with it, and I would say if you like the Door's it's nice to have in your collection.",1398643200,,219,4.116279069767442
5949177,4,B00EXAXZVY,"Obviously, the footage is quite old and not widescreen so you can likely save some money and buy the DVD.  Lots of content though so a must have if you are a doors fan.",1398643200,2,168,3.9411764705882355
5949178,4,B00EXAXZVY,"I can't get wild over this DVD.  Yes it features the Doors in their early years on TV programs, but all of the performances are lip-synched.  One particular video from Malibu-U only has 3 Doors in it, Jim didn't make it to the filming, so they had Robbie's brother stand with his back to the camera and they insert Jim in later.  Some of the short films that the Doors had more of a hand in are better. But go into this one with your eyes open!",1397433600,4,444,4.080459770114943
5949179,4,B00EXAXZVY,"Great to see the Doors performing.  I wish they would have included more of their songs such as Riders on the Storm and Love Her Madly, but overall fun to watch.",1397088000,,161,4.193548387096774
5949180,5,B00EXAXZVY,I have been a Doors fan since the release of their first LP.This video collection is NOT a documentary about the band. It is a good collection of some of their music. I would recommend this good quality music collection to anyone who likes The Doors' music because it presents the band visually performing their music on some TV appearances along with some short films. The sound quality is surprisingly good considering the era in which these performances were recorded. Anyone that loves the music should be happy with this video presentation.,1395792000,,545,4.934782608695652
5949181,5,B00EXAXZVY,I love all about The Doors I wished the book was bigger but I love the story like going back in time !!! Amazing Jim ! Amazing all ! Thanks,1395619200,,139,3.6666666666666665
5949182,2,B00EXAXZVY,I bought this for a gift and was disapointed when I received the book. It looks like a larger book in the photo. The book is only 5 x 7 inches which is not what I expected. If it wasn't a gift I wouldn't have minded.,1395273600,,216,3.717391304347826
5949183,4,B00EXAXZVY,Material all sounds great. NOT for completists though. Quite a few videos missing from this set to make it complete but a couple on this set that can't be found anywhere else.,1394409600,,175,4.5
5949184,5,B00EXAXZVY,I'm glad these videos were preserved and not lost or destroyed. This is something that needs to be shared with future generations.,1394323200,,130,4.954545454545454
5949185,5,B00EXAXZVY,"I'll leave the detailed analysis to more knowledgeable reviewers, but I will say this disc sounds and looks GREAT!  I opted for the blu-ray deluxe edition, and I'm glad I did.  The book has all of the lyrics, a bit of background on each video clip, and a lot of great pictures I hadn't seen before.  I'm very pleased with it.",1393113600,2,325,4.295081967213115
5949186,4,B00EXAXZVY,"Was not sure what exactly to expect with this DVD, knowing the band didn't have many music videos per say. This is a very interesting item for die-hard Doors fans however, featuring many live TV performances and more. There are MANY videos that are, and with no offense to the band, brutally awkward (watch their Malibu U performance where Jim is wearing a white and blue striped sailors shirt). They literally had the band playing Light My Fire on a firetruck...WOW...

For die-hard fans only.",1393113600,6,494,4.811764705882353
5949187,5,B00EXAXZVY,"If you have just about every dvd that's come out of The Doors, you still need to get this one! Some of the videos that were previously only to be found on places like YouTube were included here. My only one complaint is that for whatever reason, the complete segment with Murray The K was not included, only part of it - and what a shame that is, because it's actually very funny in it's entirety. But I love this dvd, and if you are a new Doors fan, this one won't be the most comprehensive, like some of the others, but a good addition to your Doors collection.",1392681600,,563,4.174311926605505
5949188,5,B00EXAXZVY,"I Never understand - why the doors Won't (I didn't say 'Can't') release DVDs, CDs etc - that are Complete.
Missing from this set:
Ed Sullivan, People are strange & Light my fire.
Toronto (name of show??) The End (in color)

I forget the rest - I'll have to look at home. I do love the commentary - there is a little Ray did before he died. Has Robbie, John - Jac - I think Bruce.

There is a bonus video of a Ford salesmen training video - but I struggled to realize - the occasional background music is the doors (1966) - and apparently No vocals of Jim on this one.

There is more that myself and others - wonder IF and/or When - they will release. Like the audio of the doors at the London Fogg. - Still a great set and a must for Any doors collector - and so far the 1st time I've seen 'Malibu U' on ANY DVD!! Scott M.",1391126400,3,822,3.9397590361445785
5949189,5,B00EXAXZVY,"This new release of Doors music films spanning the height of their fame in the sixties is a must for any Doors enthusiast.  Besides the rarely seen music films, the DVD offers bonus features including a 2013 documentary with the surviving musicians.  The documentary is a refreshing look back at just how the Doors became known through radio and music films that were forerunners of today's music videos.  Overall an intelligent approach to understanding an often misunderstood rock and roll band.  Don't miss it!",1390780800,4,513,5.071428571428571
5949190,5,B00EXAXZVY,"If you are a Doors fan you must have this. Films I have seen in low quality are crystal clear. My only real
complaint is that they use 'Touch Me' from The Smothers bros. We have all seen this a million times before! The
should have included 'Wild Child' from the same program. BAD oversight. Light My Fire from the Jonathan Winters show is missing too. If this two film were included, I would have given 6 stars. Maybe they are preparing a R-Evolution part 2?",1390435200,12,459,4.348837209302325
5949191,4,B00EXAXZVY,"Being a fan of the Doors I had to get this. I am generally happy with the collection of songs included and the improved sound on many of the original film clips. There are also some rare footage never seen by Doors fans for over 40 years.
I have seen the bulk of these clips on DVDs such as the 30th Anniversary and even the recent LA woman Documentary BluRay which doubles up many songs already available.
What is great about this BluRay is the best of the doors is now available in a complete collection all on 1 disc in the best quality available for both image and sound.",1390089600,15,575,4.236363636363636
5949192,5,B00EXAXZVY,"Youve seen this entertainment through and through Jim Morrison, The Movie

No. you havent! Jim Cherry

The Doors R-Evolution  is a compilation of films and videos that follows The Doors from their earliest TV appearances in which they had little to no input of the content of the performance except for the song being performed, to where they gained the stature to release their own videos with full control of content culminating in the release of Ghost Song in 1995. Ive seen these videos quite a bit and have used them from Youtube postings for Doors Examiner articles. When I first heard of the idea behind The Doors R-Evolution I thought it was a boring idea, that weve seen all these clips before, but you have to see the full clips remastered and the complete performances. They look as good or better than the day they were broadcast, even the antique looking American Bandstand appearance in black and white looks fantastic! If you think you know these videos from Youtube and bootlegs, all you have to do is take one look to see them through new eyes.

As I mentioned the videos in R-Evolution are remastered and are crisp looking. A good example of this would be the Doors appearance on Shebang which has only been available on bootlegs and Youtube and those look as if they were taped straight off of TV or recorded from an earlier generation of video that wasn't up to speed and caused distortion and looked washed out. In R-Evolution it has been restored to full color and still packs the immediacy of the broadcast, although Jim doesnt seem like hes into it, obviously lip-syncing and missing cues.

The DVD moves smoothly from video to video with no introduction save a title card of the show appearance and date. If you do want to watch the videos with background information you can turn on the commentary track and hear anecdotes of the song, or the show from Robby Krieger, John Densmore, Ray Manzarek, Jac Holzman and Bruce Botnick.

While R-Evolution contains most of the videos from TV show appearances it isn't a complete set of the full TV appearances. For instance, the Jonathan Winters appearance is missing the Light My Fire segment and the Smothers Brothers clip doesnt include Wild Child (although in all fairness, on R-Evolution you have two other appearances of Light My Fire and Wild Child represented in another clip). But there is  one television appearance noticeably missing in R-Evolution, The Doors appearance on the PBS show Critique. Taped and broadcast in the aftermath of the Miami incident, Critique was the first sign the band was going to survive and the appearance puts The Doors best foot forward in presenting them in their own words in an interview segment, showcasing the music in a performance segment, and finally a panel discussion on the merits (or lack thereof) of the band. The inclusion of those first two segments would make for a good example of how The Doors learned to use the medium of film and TV as opposed to it using them.

Ive already mentioned the commentary track thats on the bonus features, but R-Evolution contains more than the usual amount of bonus tracks on a Doors DVD. Theres also the much sought after, and until now rarely seen video Love Thy Customer which is a training film for the Ford Motor Company that The Doors were commissioned to do the soundtrack for early on in their career (Robby thinks that they may not have even had a record contract at the time they recorded this). Love Thy Customer is a typical training film that does get long in the tooth but it is cool to hear The Doors playing on it, you can hear the distinctive notes of Ray Manzarek and Robby Krieger in it. No Doors songs were used on the training film so there is no Jim Morrison vocals on that video. The bonus features includes a nice documentary Breaking Through the Lens. Also included in the bonus features are a couple of outtakes showing them filming the Jim Morrison inserts for the Malibu U video (on the day of filming Jim didn't show up and so Robbys brother Ronnie stood in for Jim, making for some wonderful continuity errors on the hair length between Ronnie Krieger and Jim), as well as Break on Through from the Isle of Wight in 1970.

I don't usually mention packaging in a review but the packing of The Doors R-Evolution is unique and I wish they had thought of this packaging earlier. The packaging of the special edition is in the form of a book that not only includes the DVD but also blurbs and factoids about the song in each particular video. For instance, the night of The Doors appearance at Bill Grahams Winterland Ballroom was also the night their appearance on the Jonathan Winters Show was being broadcast, so in the middle of the Winterland appearance The Doors stopped the show, brought a TV onstage and sat and watched the TV appearance along with their audience! It would have been cool if The Doors had hit upon this way of packaging the DVDs before because it would have been nice to have a line of these little booklets on your DVD library shelf.",1388793600,3,5042,4.637178051511758
5949193,5,B00EXAXZVY,"Well I was initially disappointed when first opening this up.... there are so many legendary TV performances NOT included in this set. Obviously obtaining the rights from the companies that control them (many have been on other Doors DVDs) was problematic. What we have is a bit over an hour of clips .... and frankly of a mixed quality of film.  The only benefit of BR is likely the more recent interview footage and on screen commentary... all in HD.  The Bandstand footage is soft and washed out but cool to have. The Malibu U footage is quite interesting and of middling quality.  The majority of ""films"" are the ones the Doors cobbled together with old footage themselves in the 80's.  As I said (and from what I've described so far this is a sold 2-3 star release) the bonus footage pushes this up.  There is the option to view a commentary and this is picture in picture with Robby and John , and Jac Holzman from Elektra Records and Bruce Botnick... talking about the films. There is also an outstanding featurette of over a half hour about their life through the lens with all new interviews (Ray appears in what seem to be out takes from the exceptional film about LA Woman by Classic Albums). Along with a film from the Isle of Wight of Break on Through and an incredibly weird half hour bonus of a film by FORD Motor Company about Selling with the underscore music.... by the Doors.  The more footage of the members of this group talking about their music the better for me so I'm bumping my score up to 5 stars..... although of the Doors available on BR I rate this last behind the great documentary of ""LA Woman"" , The other exceptional Documentary ""When You're Strange"" and the Doors Live at the Hollywood Bowl. I'd include links but the new review format isn't giving me that option.  I picked up an import as another reviewer noted it is all region and he was right!!

5949194,5,B00EXAXZVY,"Excellent comp of rare tv appearances, some never before released, some were scattered over various vhs and dvd releases. The Dick Clark appearance is very good. It includes the entire appearance - the intro, 2 complete lip-sync songs, and a short interview with Dick and each band member.
The Blu-ray and dvd from Europe are NOT region 2 folks - they are region-free! Much cheaper to order these from Amazon UK right now.",1386633600,9,422,4.794520547945205
5949195,5,B00EXAXZVY,"This fantastic Doors history of their television appearances is being released in 4 different formats in both Europe and North America. For both the European market versions, which are being released earlier and the North American versions- you can choose from a Deluxe Set in either Blu-ray or regular dvd. Only the Deluxe Set includes a fantastic 40 page book that features a scrap book style presentation of each track including the song lyrics, photos, background information and trivia. This Deluxe Book Set comes in your choice of the Blu-ray or dvd versions. There will also be just the Blu-ray or dvd R-Evolution without the book for less money. The pre-order shown here is the Blu-ray North American U.S. version of just the Blu-ray. This is not the deluxe version with the extra 40 page book.

I'm certain many Doors fans, like myself, have seen some of The Doors television appearances over the years- even The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour Television Show- Season 3 dvd includes a couple of The Doors appearances, but nothing like what is included here on this set. This is not a complete history, as you will notice not every television performance or film is included, as I immediately noticed The Doors second song on the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour- Wild Child is not included, nor the famous Light My Fire from The Ed Sullivan Show. This is a history of The Doors Evolution on film appearances, as the title states, and not a complete history. Just seeing the Evolution of The Doors on film is wonderful enough, but it's the Bonus Material that make this worth watching. Included in this set are some very rare television appearances of The Doors, such as the band's full performance on Shebang, a Dick Clark interview, the color version of the band's appearance on Malibu U- including never before seen outtakes, and from German tv- the complete color version of Hello, I Love You. Besides television appearances over the years, you will also get to enjoy The Doors Films from the 80's, including a rare director's cut of the 1985 L.A.Woman short film.

There are Bonus Features that are simply fantastic as well. A new edit by Murray Lerner from the 1970 Isle Of Wight Festival is included, as well as the extremely rare 1966 Ford Motor Company film with The Doors providing the sound track. All the audio, with the exception of the Ford Motor Company film, has been restored by Bruce Botnick- The Doors long time engineer and co-producer of the last L.A. Woman album. There are 19 total television appearances and short films included on this simply fantastic set. Not only are the audios restored by Bruce Botnick, but I heard the videos have been restored fantastically as well!

Having these television appearances of The Doors finally complete with great audio and video restorations is a wish come true. My only other wish is that someone restores the Jim Morrison Highway film as well as The Doors Feast Of Friends film. I've waited decades for a good copy of these great short films and I really hope someone will bring them to dvd and hopefully Blu-ray soon for all of us Doors and Jim Morrison fans to enjoy as much as these television appearances! For now, I have to give a million THANKS to Eagle Rock Studios for all their hard work in bringing us Doors fans these fabulous television appearances and rarities- these are all MUST-HAVES for us Doors and Jim Morrison Fans!

8610168,4,B00EXAXZVY,Great collection of footage I'd never seen before... my favourite takes are the film on LIGHT MY FIRE on the beach with a firetruck and Barbie-like birds around the band and the first film of BREAK ON THROUGH. I love these four guys and the amazing music they did together. They each contributed something phenomenal to the collective. Really amazing. Only four stars because more footage should have been licensed and offered on this blu-ray.,1489449600,,443,4.92
8610169,4,B00EXAXZVY,"Absolutely love the Doors. Huge fan and collector. And as much as I do love all of these performances, I'm pretty dismayed by what is missing on here. Its incomplete and for an OCD guy like me, it's just annoying. Its hard to tell the complete story of the Doors in one narrative (in this case blu-ray release) when some of their TV performances are misplaced on other discs. Its sort of like removing a scene from a movie, and making it a bonus feature to another. As you will see, this is the case here. So what is missing?

MISSING (in no particular order):

1) People are Strange - The Ed Sullivan Show
Why is this missing? I interned at a stock film archive for a period of time, and they have this footage available ready to be licensed. So it is available, why is it not included? Too costly?

2) Light My Fire - The Ed Sullivan Show
Same issue as the above, and possibly the most important television performance they ever gave. I've seen this on DVD releases, but it has yet to make it to blu-ray, and here was the perfect opportunity.

3) Light My Fire - Jonathan Winters Show
This collection includes the most seen performance from this broadcast, Moonlight Drive, but is missing the Light My Fire performance. It IS available on the ""Live at the Bowl"" blu-ray, but it really belongs on this disc with the other TV performances. I'm sure excluding this title was because they didn't want to pay to license it again for another release, but they should have had the foresight when they did the ""Live at the Bowl"" release.

4) Light My Fire - Murray the K Show
Its exists, we've seen it. Why is it not here? It's one of the more bizarre television performances of the Doors, in fact, its more like a music video. Outtakes also exist for this and their People are Strange performance, which could have been a nice bonus feature. The stock archive I mentioned earlier also had all of this footage available for licensing.

4) Wild Child - The Smothers Brothers Show
This collection includes the incredibly common Touch Me performance, but is missing the Wild Child one. This IS on the ""Live at the Bowl"" blu-ray, but as said above, it should have really been included here.

5) The End - O'Keefe Centre
This was later released on the ""Feast of Friends"" blu-ray, but why was it not released on this collection?

6) PBS Performance
Available on VHS and DVD, but yet to make it on blu-ray. Would have been perfect for this release. Its a long show, but it should have been here

7) Post-Morrison performances
Many fans might not be too interested, but its still a part (although minor) of the legacy of the Doors.

Now its quite possible that these can be released on another compilation release, but whats the point if they're not all in chronicle order? I certainly believe that all of these could have fit onto a single disc. I highly doubt it will ever happen with all the licensing involved.",1476489600,16,2900,4.485768500948766
