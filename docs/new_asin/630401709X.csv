It is truly a joy to watch this DVD (VHS is now available in  widescreen as well) in the right format with all the extras.  But all that  aside, this is a towering, neglected masterpiece of American cinema that  virtually put director Sydney Pollack on the map and established Jane Fonda  as the premier American actress of the Sixties and Seventies.  Who else  could have captured the tragic essence of the bitter, beaten Gloria but  Fonda?  Watch her especially in the final elimination round as she  desperately (and literally) carries her ailing partner around the floor in  a final attempt to win the big prize and (symbolically) maybe give life one  more try.  Fonda never sentimalizes this great character as a lesser  actress would have been tempted to; no simple answers or easy forgiveness  will do for Gloria--she is too important to be trivialized.  Red Buttons,  Susannah York, and Gig Young are also superb in supporting roles; the  cinematography and music also deserve kudos.

The satire is dripping. The desperate contestant drags her corpse partner across the finish line so as not to be eliminated.  And although dance marathons have gone out of style, it a resonates today perfectly, as it did in the late 60's when it was made.  And the theme is not just man's inhumanity to man, but the purposelessness of life, as if to say we're all desperate in chasing some carrot that can't be reached. I really enjoyed this artful movie, but no one should see this if they are prone to depression or suicide.

763406,5,630401709X,"Review of They Shoot Horses, Don't They?
Hot Toasty Rag, September 28, 2017

During the Great Depression, participating in dance marathons was a very popular activity. Couples would enter and dance nonstop for hours, days, weeks, or months, and audiences would flock to watch and cheer on their favorite team. The winning couple would receive some prize money, and in the meantime, the contestants would be fed and sheltered for as long as they endured. If youve never heard of this, or you're not up on your 1930s history, you might want to read up on the horrors of the Great Depression before renting They Shoot Horses, Dont They?

If you don't really understand how desperate and hopeless these dance contestants felt, you might not be able to appreciate Robert E. Thompsons and James Poes screenplay. The characters in the film act like condemned gladiators who will do anything to entertain the crowd before getting thrown into the lions den. They stay on their feet no matter the cost, whether its their health or dignity. They sleep while dancing, leaning on their partners, and one woman enters the contest while pregnant because she has no other prospects.

They Shoot Horses, Dont They? is incredibly bleak. There are no happy parts to the story; this isn't a two-sided view of the famous walkathons of the Great Depression. The camera captures the up close and personal horrors the contestants experience, backstage and in front of the audience cheering in the stands. The audience is shown cheering when horrible things happen to the dancers; they treat them like animals in a horse race. Sydney Pollack directed the movie, and while it would have been easy to film it in a sensational, flashy manner, he chose a bleak approach. The colors are muted and dusty against the cheery faade of the event, and the sweaty and haggard faces show through the performance makeup.

Jane Fonda, Michael Sarrazin, Susannah York, Red Buttons, Bruce Dern, Robert Fields, and Bonnie Bedelia are the featured dance contestants, and Gig Young is the MC. Everyone gives a superb performance, and Fonda, York, and Young were honored at the 1970 Oscars. Sydney Pollack was also nominated for his outstanding direction, as were the costumes, art direction, adapted screenplay, music, and editing. Ive seen this film three times, but it isn't for everyone. Its extremely heavy and upsetting. But if you like movies that fall under the people are terrible mantra, like Network or The Great Gatsby, youll be in a good position to appreciate this well-crafted film.

Kiddy warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to some upsetting content, I wouldn't let my kids watch this movie.",1506556800,2,2700,4.977827050997782

763471,5,630401709X,"You may or may not agree with me on this, but I think our responses to art, no matter the art  painting and sculpture, music, the written word, theater, film  are inextricably entwined with two conditions at the time we experience the art: the times we live in and the mood were in at the time.  Our responses are colored, nuanced, by the state of the world at large, the state of our country, the state of our city or town, and our own life circumstances, our mood, within all of that.  All these statuses combine to affect our responses and in large part determine whether or not we love the art, hate the art, or have an exactly neutral opinion of it.  For example, Ive seen first-run movies that I hated because I was in a foul mood on the evening I saw them, then, upon a second viewing years later, loved.  It confused me, made me wonder what Id missed the first time around, when Id probably missed, basically, everything, my mind elsewhere for that hour and a half or two hours.  In other words, had I not seen THIS film until years after its release, in another time period altogether, in another mood, I may have responded to it very differently.  But I saw it when I saw it that first time, reacted to it as I did that first time, and the opinion created on that mild December night in 1969 has never since changed for a single day.  I was 16.  Im now 64.  Forty-eight years; my GOD, forty-eight years ago!  And no other film has knocked it off the pedestal I placed it on that night  as the most perfect film ever made.

They Shoot Horses, Dont They? was released on December 10, 1969.

To flip-flop Dickens, It was the worst of times, it was the best of times.

Specific to 1969, Vietnam, rather than grinding to a halt, had continued to escalate and still raged halfway around the world from where my mother, younger brothers and I lived in northern Delaware.  But the war raged here as well, both through the nightly news, the running ticker tape statistics for the days dead and wounded American soldiers, and through the countrys at-home pro-war and anti-war contingencies, the believers and non-believers of our involvement in Southeast Asia.  Vietnam was a different animal than WWII: Our involvement in WWII had been clear-cut, uniting the nation in a way not seen since the times of the American Revolution, whereas our reasons for the war in Vietnam were vague, murky.  We were only six years beyond the JFK assassination, and memories of his efforts to end the war were fresh.  Instead, under Johnson and Nixon, it had escalated, and half the country was outraged at the constant deployment of hundreds of thousands of American sons to the slaughterhouse of Vietnam.  Of the other half, half weren't sure what to think and half were so-called patriots, ready to defend the countrys leaders no matter their reasoning.  1968 had been a particularly divisive year: The massacre in My Lai had occurred in March, followed by the killings of Martin Luther King in April and Robert Kennedy in June.  In August 1969, flower children whod gone to the dark side emerged with the Manson family and the shock of the Tate/LaBianca murders.  The rift widened, hardened.  And worse times were yet to come.  We were six months out from the Kent State shootings, Americans killing Americans, and only a few short years out from the Watergate scandal and the single example in our history of the resignation of a President.  The country was in turmoil.

When I think back to that time period, though, especially if I expand it to the full decade of the 70s, it was a time of great growth and beauty, too.  With the exception of the Manson family, most of the flower children, the hippies, genuinely believed they could change the world with their philosophy of peace and love, and their placing of flowers into rifle barrels was an act to behold.  Even with Martin Luther King gone, the civil rights movement waged on, thank God, and was joined by other liberation movements, womens rights, gay rights, thank God, thank God.  The rebellion and revolution of ideas were being fought on the streets, for just causes.  People believed in things  considered them, studied them, discussed them, debated them, and were willing, even eager, to participate in the advancement of them.  A sense of liberalism entered the picture, an acceptance of differences; in fact, perhaps a purposeful seeking out of differences as a means to understand them and add them to ones own sphere of life.  In my life, I think it may have been the last most beautiful era for sheer humanity.

The growth, the beauty, extended to the arts as well.

The music industry alone was as rich and varied as it had ever been.  The old guard, people like Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, were continuing to hit the charts.  Motown and the British invasion were still exploding, as was the American rock of the 50s and the Beach Boys.  Elvis remained King.  But now we had psychedelic rock, too, and the newer folk artists like James Taylor, Joni Mitchell, and Laura Nyro.  Like it or not, disco entered the scene and started the world dancing in a new way  but at least dancing.  No matter ones tastes in music, it was out there, available.

And Hollywood jumped on the bandwagon of growth, beauty, and CHANGE, as well, with a proliferation of films that probably would never be made today, films of rebellion, revolution, irreverence; films of ideas; liberal films of adult themes, sexuality, commonplace nudity, and, something wed never see in todays multiplexes, even mainstream pornography.

Think about it: Deep Throat came out in 1972 and, though it was triple-X-rated and filled with graphic sex, it played in hometown theaters all across the country.  It played in the grand old theater on Main Street in my small college town.  People of all ages over 21 flocked to it.  Older college students saw it, middle-aged couples saw it, grandparents saw it.  Mothers, fathers, aunts and uncles saw it, as did the administrators of local school districts, store clerks, postal carriers, and the people who worked photo booths in shopping center parking lots.  Your doctors and dentists saw it.  Your butchers, bakers, and candlestick makers saw it.  Hell, though I was too young by two years to get into it, even I saw it by stuffing the shoulders of my jacket with washcloths to make me look older.  The WORLD saw Deep Throat.  If that doesnt describe the liberalism, the searching for answers, and the acceptance of those answers of that era, I don't know what does.

Ask yourselves this: When was the last time  and how often does this occur now  you saw a film and afterward thought about, discussed, and debated it at great length with someone else whod seen it?  Rarely?  Never?  The thing is, there were many standardly lightweight movies being made during that era, too, and there have been many great movies made since that time.  In general, though, since then, the liberalism has died and our culture has been dumbed down to want pure entertainment, action movies and superhero movies, movies of an extremely lightweight nature, no profound messages, please; and movies we forget five minutes after exiting the theater  as I call it, cinemanesia.  Anyone of an age to have lived through that last Golden Age of Hollywood likely knows what Im talking about, and likely agrees with me.

But let me return to December 10, 1969, midway through my junior year of high school.

In October/November, when seeing other movies and seeing the poster in the lobbies for They Shoot Horses, Dont They? (one of the all-time most perfect posters, too) and seeing the preview for it, I was intrigued, excited; I couldn't wait to see it.  Part of my anticipation rested in a love for Jane Fonda as an actress.  Yes, shed made a host of mediocre films by then, though Id enjoyed her strong performances in most of them, especially Walk on the Wild Side, which Id seen on television, and The Chase in 66 and Hurry Sundown in 67, which Id seen in theaters.  I was also attracted to the subject of the Depression-era dance marathons, which I knew nothing about whatsoever.  I was so anticipatory of the film, in fact, that I had to beg my cousin, six months older than I, to beg her even older boyfriend to see it so they could take me; I was still several months away from attaining my drivers license.  To make it a foursome, I invited a classmate of my cousins, Mary.  Mary and I had become close recently as costars rehearsing for that years major school play, David and Lisa.  Id suspected for years  known, really, since the age of 4  that I was gay, and yet I had the most delirious crush on Mary.  Had I not been gay, she shoulda-coulda-woulda been my soulmate, my wife, and I honestly believe wed be together now, as happy as always.

Because it made logistical sense, my cousin and her boyfriend picked up Mary before me, then the four of us headed to the theater.  Mary and I sat in the back seat, giddy to see each other, giddy to be going to a movie together.  Of course, I was the giddiest of us all, so happy to see it finally.  But I was in an odd mood, too, unsure what to do about my feelings for Mary.  And it was in that mood and in that degree of excitement that I first saw They Shoot Horses, Dont They?

I was stunned, overwhelmed on every level.  I was physically exhausted, emotionally drained, and intellectually inspired.  But I was reluctant to express any of this to Mary, my cousin, or her boyfriend, out of some sense of embarrassment to be experiencing such strong reactions.  On the ride home, all I said aloud was that I thought it was one of the best movies Id seen in a very long time.

The next day I asked another friend from the senior class, Elaine, to go with me again, not because she could drive but because I knew shed experience the same impact and be able to express it afterward.  Yes! she said, I really want to see it.  Except for her hair, which cascaded to her waist, Elaine bore a striking resemblance to Jane Fonda: the jut of her jaw, the determination of her mouth, the eyes that could twinkle or haunt.  When she picked me up in her faded pink Buick, which she called Pig, I felt privileged to be going again with her, with my own Jane Fonda.  Seeing it the second time in two evenings, the impact on me was even stronger; the impact on Elaine was exactly what Id hoped it would be.  Afterward, we sat in a coffee shop in our university town and talked about it for hours.  Later, when she parked in front of the apartment building where I lived, we got out of the car and decided to walk a derby around a section of the complex to see if we could do it, to see how it would feel.  One oclock in the morning, and she grabbed my belt and hung on as we went around the buildings three times, heel-toe, heel-toe, heel-toe.  Exhausting, even in the strength of our youth.

The two of us admittedly became obsessed with the film, seeing it again and again as it lasted in our area.  When its run eventually ended, we visited the university library to scour newspapers for movie listings in other reasonably reachable locales, sometimes driving three hours to see it again.  We drove from Delaware to Baltimore, MD, Scranton, PA, New York City, NY.  We were young, idealistic, fearless, and we both had liberal single parents who allowed us to pursue our dreams, our search for answers.  Oh, the miles we put on Pig chasing that movie.  By the time it finally ended its run on screens all across the country, wed seen it 50-some times and had memorized it frame-by-frame, line-by-line.

Through the advent of video, of course, Ive owned it in almost every format available, and Id estimate that Ive seen it approximately 200 times now.  Each and every time I watch it, I do so with the same excitement and anticipation beforehand, the same excitement and anticipation all through it.  Recently, when my Amazon recommendations listed the imminent release of a Special Edition Blu-ray in September 2017 (next month!), my excitement and anticipation skyrocketed once again and prompted me, all these years later, to write a review of Horses simply to give my two cents to the world, to hope that it motivates just one reader to rent or buy this perfect, classic film.  To see it, to experience it for the first time.

That said, as other reviewers have mentioned, it is, without doubt, one of the most unrelentingly depressing films ever made, too, and you should know that going into it.  If youve never seen it, however, accept the depression and see it, because you will never see a finer example of movie magic, all the pieces coming together in a single film, all the pieces coming together to create cinematic perfection.

So  Why do I still think, forty-eight years later, that They Shoot Horses, Dont They? is the most perfect film ever made?

First, there are the technical pieces.  The production design of the marathon dance hall sitting on the seaside pier is so fully realized in all its glitz and shabbiness that you are THERE almost from start to finish, claustrophobically  the massive hardwood dance floor, the bleachers and bandstand, the storage room, the emcees dark office, the dormitory areas, even the corridor through which garbage is delivered outside for pickup, one of the only parts of the set through which Robert  and we  almost makes it outside for a moment to the sunlight, the fresh air.  There is the cinematography, rich and vibrant with color, the camera panning the audiences in the bleachers and gliding through the dancing couples, slowing on this one, that one, before gliding again.  There are the costumes and makeup displaying the gradual wearing down of the continually more exhausted couples.  There is the music, the score, with every song used suited and fitting like a glove to its scene, commenting on its scene.  Your heart will be torn in two, for example, when the poor, pregnant character of Ruby agrees to sing The Best Things in Life Are Free for the audience in the bleachers, desperate for the few coins they might throw at her when she finishes.  And there is the editing, which is considered masterful to this day.  For the two grueling derby sequences, director Sydney Pollack donned roller skates and carried a hand-held camera so he could skate within the thick of the throngs, filming, and the editing of these sequences has never been matched.

The film was nominated for five technical Oscars: Art Direction, Costume Design, Film Editing, Adapted Score, and Adapted Screenplay.  It won none of these categories.  Three of the winners were equally deserving; I cant argue with their choice.  But Art Direction to Hello, Dolly and Film Editing to Z?  As my mother would have said, No way, theres no way.

Interesting note on the filming: Horses is one of a handful of movies shot almost entirely in sequence, first scene to last, so the physical effect of the marathon would be evident in the weight loss of the cast and the circles under their eyes even without the help of makeup.  And you DO see this.  Look at each of them during the first scene as they're registering for the marathon.  Look closely.  Then watch closely as the movie progresses.  Their decline isn't merely the result of costuming and makeup  its real.  For this reason alone, but for so many other reasons as well, what Pollack assembled for this film is one of the finest and most committed ensemble casts ever gathered.

Pollack was nominated for Director.  He lost to John Schlesinger for Midnight Cowboy and, though I believe Pollack should have won, Schlesinger also did a wonderful job with his direction.

With some minor quibbles about Michael Sarrazins portrayal of Robert, which fortunately does not degrade the movie in any appreciable way (its capable if lackluster compared to the rest of the cast), every other performance in this film, down to the most minor character, is flawless.  For example, pay attention to Allyn Ann McLerie as Shirley, Harrys partner, when her exhaustion becomes extreme enough to bring on hallucinations.  Shes riveting.  And to the girl whos eliminated during the first derby because her overweight partner falls and shes unable to get him up and running again.  In not much longer than thirty seconds, she drills into your soul.

Red Buttons as Harry is eye-opening.  He wasn't nominated in the Supporting Actor category but, while I cant fault the nominees, I probably would have replaced Elliott Gould for Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice with Red Buttons.  Moot point, actually, because no actor that year was going to beat out Gig Young as the marathons emcee, Rocky.  Deservedly, he took the Oscar and the Golden Globe for what was easily the greatest performance of his career.  Sadly, not quite ten years later, he shot and killed his fifth wife before turning the gun on himself.

Young British actress Susannah York as Alice, the Jean Harlow wannabe who deteriorates along with everyone else and descends, eventually, into madness, is frighteningly effective.  She also deserved her nomination for Supporting Actress and SHOULD HAVE WON.  Instead, Goldie Hawn won for Cactus Flower.  What?  WHAT?  Id also have removed Sylvia Miles for Midnight Cowboy and replaced her with Bonnie Bedelia, far more deserving of the nomination.

Which brings me to Fonda.

Shed made sixteen films prior to Horses.  Although several were full-blown dramas (the three mentioned earlier, in particular), and although Fonda was excellent in them, the roles themselves still bore the sex kitten image shed become known for and seemingly couldn't escape.  She sometimes didn't help matters: The year before Horses, in fact, for her then husband Roger Vadim, she made Barbarella, which furthered her image as a serious actress not a whit and probably set it back even further.  With her pedigree, her sheer intelligence, her burgeoning skills, she was primed for a breakthrough role, a role which would finally prove beyond all doubt that she was, indeed, an actress who could carry her weight and then some, a craftsman of the highest order.

In my very humble opinion, I still believe that her performance as Gloria Beatty, as unlikable as the character is, as unflinchingly cynical, depressing, self-destructive  and, in a way, precisely because of this  remains the single greatest performance by an actress ever captured on celluloid.  Others have come within a hairs breadth  Spacek in Carrie, Streep in Sophies Choice  but no one has yet toppled her in my mind.  Pick and choose a scene, any scene, and watch her.  Watch her eyes.  They are on fire with intelligence.  I could be wrong, but I think Fonda, with Pollack agreeing, chose intelligence as Glorias fatal flaw.  Not the cynicism, not the self-destructiveness  fierce intelligence.  Blended with a large dollop of self-awareness.  These are the only choices that make credible sense within the framework of Glorias arc within the framework of the story.  And these are the choices that enable an audience, no matter Glorias surface abrasiveness, to understand and sympathize with her, TO CARE ABOUT HER.  Brilliant; no other word for it.

Watch her especially during the second derby.  There is a moment when her eyes fill with terror at the prospect of losing, followed by a moment when the intelligence and remaining determination kick in.  You can see in her eyes, in the reset of her jaw, the exact moment when she decides to continue, and you can see in her eyes and the expression on her face, hear in her voice, the struggle to fight from then to the bitter end.  In itself, this second derby is surely one of the most brutal and painful-to-watch scenes in film history.  Not solely based on Fondas performance, but on that of the entire cast, the unparalleled ensemble, and the cinematography and split-second editing.  Watch Buttons; watch THAT moment.  Watch Dern, as strong and determined as Fonda as he pulls his pregnant wife around the laps, but wearing down and dying just a little.  Watch Bedelia, holding onto her husbands belt for dear life as, with her other hand, she holds onto her swollen belly, protecting her unborn child, her eyes in an oblivious state of delirium.  Watch York, as wasted away as any of them now, now not even knowing why shes going on, going on because she has no idea what else to do.  Watch Sarrazin going on with her, constantly looking back over his shoulder to see if Glorias failing or succeeding.

Fonda was nominated for Actress but lost to Maggie Smith for The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.  As much as I love Maggie Smith, I will always feel that Fonda was robbed.  Like many others, I suspect it had more to do with her anti-war protesting, her then nickname of Hanoi Jane.  Detractors accused her of being un-American, of treading the line of treason, never stopping to consider that at least half the country had been protesting and continued to protest Vietnam.  Of course, they couldn't put individual names to that percentage of the population, and Fonda provided that for them  an individual name, a single voice risen in protest.  She became their scapegoat, and it took her years to overcome that stigma.

So, a total of nine Academy Award nominations and only the single win for Gig Young.  Whats astonishing is that, with so many nominations, it was NOT nominated for Picture, a shameful oversight considering that Hello, Dolly was.  What?  WHAT?

Gladiators, professional fighters, ice skaters -- the public gathers to see the performers get hurt. Gig Young says it best when he says ""They just want to see a little misery out there.""

Perhaps the most fantastic scene is when Susannah York pulls Michael Sarrazin into a closet for something that seems like sex but really isn't. It's human contact she wants. ""Where were you born? Tell me about your brothers and sisters."" True, she is pulling the straps of her dress down, embracing him madly, but it's not sex she wants, it's human intimacy, a little bit of love. The scene gets them both in trouble.

A scene that puzzles me is when Jane Fonda fellates Gig Young for no apparent reason but to gain some sort of advantage.

More puzzling, even disappointing, is when Jane Fonda expresses shock and surprise when she learns she and Robert will be charged for expenses in the event they win. A girl as cynical as Fonda should have suspected this.

763569,4,630401709X,"They Shoot Horses Dont They? is based on the 1935 book of the same name and is a realistic look at those grueling dance marathons during the 30s broadcast on radio. Jane Fonda stars as an embittered biyatch and Michael Sarrazin as her nave partner. Other down-and-out contestants include Red Buttons, Susanna York, Bruce Dern and Bonnie Bedelia.

Gig Young stands out as the charismatic MC who justifies the marathon and constantly makes brutal exploitation sound like good fun. For instant, he constantly refers to the desperate contestants as ""kids"" when most of them are anything but.  To him its not really a contest, but rather a spectacle designed to make Depression-era viewers feel better about their own lives. No one wins in the truest sense since the winners expenses are taken out of their prize money and what they win after a couple of months of exhausting dancing (!) wouldnt amount to much or be proper compensation for their considerable time and energy. Thus the ""haves exploit the ""have-nots"" to keep the other ""have-nots"" placated. You could view the dance marathon as a microcosm of society: Life is a rigged game where those in power make the rules and the poor can't win for losing, no matter how hard they try or how closely they follow the rules.

However, theres another view that can be derived from the proceedings: The dance isn't really rigged because the winners  those who endure to the end and refuse to give up no matter what  DO win a prize even if their expenses are taken out. These expenses could be considered ""taxes"" withdrawn from the persons hard-earned income by ""Big Brother, liberals who ""take care"" of the proletariat without their approval. As such, they can still win and get ahead if you don't give up.

Regardless of how you interpret it, I like how the movie takes you back to the troubled times of 1932 and educates you on something you wouldnt otherwise know much about. Its a unique, realistic drama with a potent ending. I also appreciate the Southern Cal coastal locations. I was surprised at how good this movie is.

The film runs 129 minutes and was shot on the Santa Monica Pier, CA, and Burbank Studios.

763571,5,630401709X,"Its strange how you can know nothing about a movie and yet know everything about it at the same time.  I mean, I can know that They Shoot Horses, Dont They is about a dance marathon set during the great depression and that it stars Jane Fonda and Susannah York and yet, my preconceived notion about what this movie was actually about was so far off, SO FAR OFF.

I thought this was a comedy.

Well, I can assure you that there is nothing funny about this film.  In fact, there are fewer films that I can think of that are this bleak, this emotionally crippling.  When the film ends, in those final moments, all hope, all faith, all possibility of a happy future is lost.  I don't think Ive ever felt so empty at the climax of a film.  My wife even turned to look at me when it ended and asked, Why did you want to watch this, again?

We watched it because its brilliant.

The Shoot Horses, Dont They centers around a group of people at the end of their ropes, so-to-speak.  Gloria, Robert, Alice, Sailorremember these names, for youll remember their stories.  This group of distraught and lost souls enter a dance marathon with their eyes on the cash prize, but more immediately, they are just looking for food and shelter.  As the contestants grab their partners and their numbers, they crowd the dance floor, earnestly determined to outlast everyone else, patiently awaiting their rest breaks and supplied food.  While they dance, their ringmaster as it were, the emcee Rocky, pulls strings to create a chaotic and desperate atmosphere that pleases onlookers and creates entertainment out of misery, determined to stir the pot and make the exercise all the more worth it.

Its not worth it.

Im going to throw something out there, but hear me out before you disagree; They Shoot Horses, Dont They is kind of like an adult, more focused and literal version of The Hunger Games.  This is a story about people desperate for their own survival, cast about and hopeless, agreeing to participate in a game that will strain them, test them and in some cases kill them, all for the hopes of receiving a prize that could sustain their lives.  While they are participating in this competition, they are betted on, sponsored and cheered by wealthy spectators who take a fancy to their stories.  Theyre lives are made spectacle of; they are sold to the public through the lens of commercial marketability.  When things aren't progressing fast enough, they are poked and prodded, forced into a corner where they must exert themselves or bow out, or die.  When it is deemed fit, their personal lives are manipulated to make for better entertainment, going as far as to elicit tension and force relationships that may be budding into full-fledged affairs if itll gain more attention.

And then, when all is said and done, the winners don't really win at all.

For a film this desperate and this bleak, it really needed an anchor to make it palatable, and Sydney Pollack is remarkably perfect here.  The way he surveys the whole proceedings, coming in at the right moments to make the characters come to life for us, but knowing when to scale back and just give us enough to keep us at a distance is so smart and so effective.  He makes us feel for these people and he gives us an innate longing to plead for their happy endings.  They won't get them, but he forces us to pine for it in a way that feels genuine and never manipulative.  Films like this are important for they help us to understand a time we can never fully understand, and yet all too often that understanding is marred by a directors ambition.  Pollack knows how to balance to grit and honesty with the faade in a way that is remarkably poignant.

And that cast!  Jane Fonda has never been better, ever.  Her hard exterior masking her brittle state is so effective, so crushing.  Gig Young is the perfect foil, creating a tense atmosphere within his own brashness, but subtly exposing his own desperation.  Red Buttons delivers such a harrowing performance as Sailor, a man lost in his own struggle to remain relevant, clinging to a past and devoid of any real future.  But the star here is Susannah York.  WHAT A PERFORMANCE!  She bleeds such honesty, such raw emotional unraveling.  Every scene chips away at her soul until were left with a shell of a woman.  Its one of the bravest and most compelling performance Ive ever seen put to film; period.

No, They Shoot Horses, Dont They isn't a comedy.  In many ways this isn't even entertaining.  Its one of the hardest films to watch, and when it ended I felt dead inside.  Still, its perfect, a masterpiece of storytelling importance and a film that I wouldnt change a thing about.",1426809600,2,4687,4.598795180722892

That dancing room will become a microcosmos with myriads of different social sources but united by the same goal. To dance and dance without limit of time.

One of Sydney Pollack's first films, the film is shot on a gorgeous, huge sound stage.

763657,4,630401709X,"Dance marathons started in the 1920s and became especially popular during the '30s America's Great Depression. Jobs were scarce, millions were hungry and desperate (there were no social nets: no welfare, no unemployment checks, no medical services for the poor, etc.) These marathons dangled the false promise of rich rewards to the desperate: the one winning couple left standing, surviving after thousands of hours dancing/moving 40-60 days--(contestants danced 24/7 in 2 hour shifts interrupted by 10 minute breaks for sleep/rest/eats, and the big, big plus: being served 7 meals every 24 hours).

The reward promised (say $1,500) to the winning couple was enough to buy 2 new Ford or Chevvy cars (in 1934) with almost $400 left over. And even the losing participants got free meals and a place to stay--for as long as they continued dancing.

This film only indirectly captures the desperation flooding America at that time and which drove these marathon dancers to participate--and their spectators, many almost as strapped, who flocked to watch spectacles so very similar to those brutal, barbaric survival battles in the Coliseum in ancient Rome.

It DOES depict quite well the common, transient bouts of psychosis (getting ""squirrely"" in marathoners' parlance), the lugging around of sleeping partners by whichever partner was more awake, the drastic ""first aid"" measures used to keep dancers participating, and several behind the scenes' behaviors associated with these inhumane, torturous spectacles, etc.

And, the MANY ways the sponsors shaped their presentation to entertain their audiences, e.g.: spotlighting the talents of individual dancers, elimination derbies, secretly destroying a dancer's clothing to make a more pitiful scene, announcing that a popular dancer who collapsed was now recovering nicely in a hospital rather than the truth: he'd died from over-exertion in the marathon (since the truth would create bad publicity).

Also, this movie reveals the naked truth of these marathons: despite the hype, they were just scams run solely to enrich their promoters, designed to lure in both participants and (paying) audiences. The promoters always deducted from the winning couple's $1,500 ""prize"" their ""accrued bills"" for ALL their food, food prep, rooms, sleeping supplies, ""medical services,"" notifications, etc., to the point that even the ""winners"" ended up nearly as poor as when they started and very lucky that they received ANY reward at all.

Fonda's character from the beginning is so critical, so caustic, she's never likable (IMO). She'd obviously been previously hurt, abused, seriously emotionally scarred. Why and in what ways?--that we're entirely left to conjecture, and to me, that's the downside of this film; that narrative arc is left blank. The film's great upside is its poignant, rich portrayal of this unique slice of an American era.

Gig Young's Oscar for marathon ""ring master"" was well deserved; he was superb and his performance significantly gave this film its strength, quality and drive.

(June Havoc's book, ""Early Havoc,"" provides great detail about these from her several appearances as a horse in marathons.  Highly recommended.)",1315180800,,3193,5.447368421052632

763660,4,630401709X,"THEY SHOOT HORSES, DON'T THEY? was first released near the end of the 60's era of social revolt. The pre-revolutionary, Anti-War, Feminist ideals were co-opted  by a slick Liberalism. This atmosphere was well expressed in the witty, Norman Lear television concoctions like ""Maud,"" ""The Jeffersons"" and ""All in The Family."" These shows had their moments of high hilarity--and, more importantly, they helped usher in a more racially integrated & aware entertainment media. As good as they might be, there was an uncomfortable, unreality to the shows. The more they tried to tie in ""socially relevant"" themes, the more artificial they appeared. Viewing ""Maude"" today is a little embarrassing.

The world of cinema fares better in retrospection. It was the era of the European ""Art House"" film, and many of these movies have survied the test of time. The American THEY SHOOT HORSES is very much in that tradition--with a strong flavor of Hollywood, of course. Jane Fonda was riding a wave of popularity at the time, and taking the role of Gloria, the down-on-her-luck, hard times girl posed a challenge--one that she was up to taking on. Gloria is an anti-heroine. She has been beaten down so long her consistent negative view of reality is almost funny. When she finally realizes just how hopeless & really terrible her situation is, she just spits out ""Perfect.""

Gig Young received many positive reviews for his portrayal of the Machiavellian director of the Dance Marathon. There is complexity to his characterization. On one level he is just a manipulating pitch man, doing whatever it takes to stay afloat in the Depression era. But once in a while you see a slight tremble of sympathy for the losers he manipilates both in front of the stage lights & behind the scenes.

The real killer performance for me is song & dance man Red Buttons. He plays an aging ex-sailor, passed over for promotion, probably discharged without distinction. He still wears his sailor suit, probably as a sop for the audience in the peanut gallery who throw pennies at the dancers who strike their fancy. He is so pathetic in his willingness to do whatever he thinks it will take to stay in the game--both on & off stage. His performance is heart-breaking.

One of the more horrific scenes is when the dancers are forced to take part in a roller skating race. Bruce Dern & Bonnie Bedelia are a young married couple who are at the end of their rope financially like everybody else--except she is pregnant. During the skating race the camera does facial close-ups as the already exhausted players have to ratchet up the tension 100%. The faces of Bedilia and Red Buttons are portraits in agony. She looks like she's miscarrying & Buttons' character is, in fact, in the process of stroking out.

The audience, of course, represents a strata of society that for the most part is only a little better off than the dancers. Some are smug, others patronizing. They can be seen as the liberals of the 70's--wanting to appear in control & gracious, but whose inner realities were often murky, sometimes condescending, always needing the veneer of progressive ideals & social acceptance in order to mask less than altruistic motivations.

In California of 1932, the seaside Pacific Ballroom holds a dance marathon in which couples compete for a $1500 prize. After her partner is rejected for health reasons, tough-talking Gloria Beatty (Jane Fonda) reluctantly accepts Robert Syverton (Michael Sarrazin) as a replacement. Robert just happened to come in off the street and was conscripted by the marathon's business-minded emcee Rocky (Gig Young).

These days, dance marathons are charity events that last only a couple of days. But they were a popular form of entertainment in the 1920s and 1930s. These were not typical ballroom dancing contests. They were brutal endurance competitions for which the spectators paid good money to watch people suffer. Dancers got a 10-minute break every 2 hours, during which they slept, free food, but they had to eat it while standing and dancing, and the marathon went on for weeks for months. Last couple standing wins. They were especially popular during the Great Depression, because they offered free food and shelter, and a chance for unemployed Americans to win some money, as we see in the homeless couple James (Bruce Dern) and his pregnant wife Ruby (Bonnie Bedelia).

It's a fine ensemble cast, but at the emotional core are the equally cynical Gloria and Rocky, a young woman at the end of her rope and an older man who couldn't care less at this point in his life. Both strong characters but neither of them likable, because they treat others so poorly. It is a credit to the actors and director that this doesn't make them completely unsympathetic. Like them or not, we understand where Gloria and Rocky are coming from. That the monotony of the marathon and film's pessimistic tone are, themselves, unforgettable rather than stultifying is due to Pollack's skill. Like Rocky, he knows when to ratchet it up to keep the audience's attention.

When Horace McCoy's novel was published in France, it was embraced by the Existentialist school of thought as an absurdist perspective on the human condition. As it was written and takes place during the 1930s, it struck me as a leftist comment on the American rat race and perceived indifference of the capitalist economy to its human cost. The film is socio-political commentary, but its overwhelming theme is simply pessimism. The dance marathon is a microcosm of the human experience, and it is ugly. Losers and winners alike are chewed up. But the behavior is interesting, and that's what keeps the audience glued to the screen with our faces stuck in a grimace. The only bonus feature on the MGM  2004 DVD is a theatrical trailer (3 min). Subtitles are available in English, French, Spanish.",1250640000,,3005,4.968190854870775
763663,4,630401709X,"When I saw this movie in the theater about 40 years ago, I found it very interesting and one of those movies you don't forget about an hour after you leave the theater. This was a haunting type of story, especially when my folks, who went with me, informed me that these marathon type of dance contests really did happen. The characters might have been fictional, but not story of these awful contests.

Jane Fonda plays the central character, ""Gloria Beatty,"" an angry-at-the-world and profane woman who certainly has a cynical attitude. It almost echoed her real-life persona at the time, but I won't go there. I was more fascinated with Gig Young's performance in this film as the ruthless dance promoter - emcee ""Rocky."" To me - and Academy Award voters - his performance stands out among all the others, even though everyone does an outstanding job. That includes director Sydney Pollack, who had only made a few movies until this one.

This is a sad tale of desperate people in desperate times trying to make a few extra bucks during the Great Depression years. Dancing in pairs, they literally risked their health by trying to stay on their feet by dancing longer than every other couple. One became mentally exhausted just watching these poor people on screen trying to survive these ""marathons.""

763665,4,630401709X,"What a movie. That is what I can say about watching ""They Shoot Horses Don't They?"" earlier today. As you know the movie is set during the tail end of The Great Depression in 1934 but like what director Arthur Penn did to ""Bonnie and Clyde"", director Sidney Pollock (I still can't get over him dying) uses that time to express the paranoia that was going on in America during the years after the Kennedy assassination in the 60's-and in some regard what is going on now as the 2000's is about to end. The cast is great-Jane Fonda, Michael Sarrazin, Gig Young, Bruce Dern (who already co-stared with Jane's brother Peter with ""The Wild Angels"" and ""The Trip""), Red Buttons, Bonnie Belinda. But the real star definitely belong to Susannah York-who plays stage actress Alice. As you know she was noninated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for this film, and she lost to Goldie Hawn for ""Cactus Flower"". I saw Hawn's movie and I could only watch the first 30 minutes because it was shockingly over the top (in some regards a microcausm of the 60's ending in chaos) while York's performance in this movie is so good that I'm shocked the Academy didn't give it to her especially the scene in which she is crying over where her dress was. I think she's the only British actress from the 1960's that takes my breath away and it would of capped a fitting end to it having started with ""The Greengage Summer"" in 1961 and then of course with ""Tom Jones"" two years later. To add insult to injury Gig Young won the Oscar for this movie when it should of been her, York wouldn't be nominated again, and the big kicker: The movie that Goldie Hawn won the Oscar was for a comedy; which as you know the Academy (any wonder they put the word 'science' in it?) has a taboo track record for that genre. As you know the movie ends with (spoiler) Sarrazin's character killing Gloria (Fonda) with a bullet to the head from the gun that she took from Young's character. How ironic considering they let the audience remind them how John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King, and Robert Kennedy got killed during the 60's. And it ends with the dance marathon continuing on not revealing who wins the money; as it remind me of a cliche that I came up to decribe the movies during the 1960's: Nobody won.

763728,5,630401709X,"Sydney Pollack died today, and I have yet to see this movie mentioned in any of his obituaries.  This is criminal.  He produced, in this early film of his, an enduring masterpiece that is a must see for every lover of film, and for every person seeking to know Truth.

I first saw this movie on my way to my second tour in Vietnam.  It was the only movie showing at the post theater and I never would have gone to it otherwise.  I did not have the least interest in the subject matter and despised Jane Fonda.

The movie is a horrible, grueling experience.  You are wishing, hoping, that something will happen that will give some relief, but it just keeps going down.  This beautiful, but desperate young couple just tries and tries and tries, but by the end every hope is dashed, every dream has become a nightmare, and every possibility is crushed.  And then it gets worse.

No movie has ever made me so angry or so depressed.  As I walked out of the theater, I kept asking myself, ""What kind of sick mind would think they are entertaining people with this sad, and hopeless story?"" ""WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?""

Then it hit me.  This was the most realistic portrayal of the human experience I had ever seen or read.  This movie is each of our life's story (if there was no God).  This is how the world works.  This is how we are tricked all our lives to give our best performance, and this is really what we all get in the end.

Reviews that say it is a historical film about the depression era totally miss the depth of meaning.  The location, the music, the costumes etc. are secondary. The portrayal of Gig Young's seduction of these poor starving people, the raising of their hopes, the full measure of effort, the total exhaustion, the crushing of their dreams, and worse; it is the actors full measure you can't forget.

""They Shoot Horses Don't They"" is the most amazingly honest film I have ever seen in my life.  It has become my favorite because it takes away the curtain and reveals who we really are, the world we live in, and our destiny.  God Help Us.",1211760000,7,2066,4.38421052631579

The setting is an ocean front dance hall the viewer presumes is in Santa Monica or some other nearby beach town and many of the participants in the dance marathon held there are Hollywood hopefuls.  Aside from possibly catching the attention of a movie casting agent the dancers stay in the long grueling marathon for hope of winning a $1500 prize (split between the dancing partners) and free food and shelter during their short breaks when they are not swaying on the dance floor to entertain the ghoulish spectators who throw pennies at their favorite participants.

The movie has many capable actors and Gig Young is the most impressive in his role of Rocky the manipulative M.C. of the marathon.  Jane Fonda is very good as the bitter cynical Gloria though she gives Gloria way too much tenacity for life to make me believe that she would end up as the movie portrays.  Susannah York is also very good as a British Jean Harlow type who wants to make it big in Hollywood as is Red Buttons as ""the ancient mariner"" a fiftyish sailor who is much much older than the rest of the ""kids"" and whose amazing stamina can only hold up so long.  I had more trouble believing in Gloria's dance partner  ""Robbie"" as played by Michael Sarrazin who is the shooter of the title and who never came across as an authentic character to me.  Other famous names in the film include Bonnie Bedalia as the pregnant ""Okie"" Ruby,  Bruce Dern as Ruby's husband, Al Lewis from THE MUNSTERS as a worker at the dance hall and Michael Conrad of Hill Street Blues fame playing a marathon referee.

Dance Marathons were a way for the ""masses"" to relieve themselves of the VERY real pressures that The Depression brought to everyday existence.

The action on-screen is at times, so frenetic that I found myself exhausted at the end of the film! The process these people go through is laid bare for examination, and the change in social attitudes is evident in the cynicism shown by it's characters....most notably Jane Fonda's character.

There is desperation, as well. This is the underlying sod that gives rise to the actions taken by some of the contestants. Since this takes place in California (presumably in the Venice/Santa Monica area), the presence of starry-eyed dreamers wishing to become Movie Stars is almost required.

The Dance Contest is exposed for what it is, too late for some, but as I said, the desperation shown by the contestants forces them to do what they may have never even given thought to....if there were no depression.

This film is a little ""snowglobe"" of what it was like to live in a time when literally, you had to live by your wits......or starve.

At least the marathoners were doing it for three hots and a cot and not the promise of fame and fortune.  In both cases there are greedy impressarios(are you listening Mark Burnett?) who exploit the contestants dreams and aspirations.  Director Pollack stages the action almost exclusively in a California beach dancehall which gives one a sense of claustrophobia and ultimately prisonlike.  The few instances where a door opens to let in the light the effect is blinding.  The ensemble that Pollack has gathered here is uniformly superb.  Jane Fonda's work here as Gloria, a sullen actress, is probably what delivered her to the mainstream from the drek she was doing for her then husband Roger Vadim.  Gloria isn't a very sympathetic character but we cannot help but empathize with her deluded dream of winning the marathon.  The real star here is Gig Young as the vile impressario, Rocky.  Rocky is omniscient and knows how this dance of the damned will end but the show and the bucks must go on.  Young deservedly won the Oscar for his work here.

763767,4,630401709X,"Marathon dancing as a spectator sport during the Great Depression must have resonated with Vietnam War-era audiences who looked at the bloody carnage of that conflict on the network news every night. To a great degree, it still does today given the ceaseless appetite for reality TV. Just before his filmmaking career took off, Sydney Pollack helmed this powerful but relentlessly downbeat 1969 drama about one such marathon dance contest set in a decrepit dance hall on the Santa Monica Pier in 1932. Adapted by screenwriters James Poe and Robert E. Thompson, the movie takes the semi-famous 1935 Horace McCoy novel and highlights the microcosm that the author created to show how hopeless people felt during the depths of the Depression, none more so than Gloria Beatty, the embittered and failed wannabe actress desperate to win half the $1,500 grand prize.

In her breakthrough dramatic role, Jane Fonda brings an unmitigated feral quality to Gloria that must have been startling at the time since her previous two films were the lightweight ""Barefoot in the Park"" and the campy pin-up comic fantasy, ""Barbarella"". For all her outwardly aggressive behavior, Gloria could have been a completely detestable character, but Fonda makes her desperation and diminished self-worth palpable in surprisingly subtle ways. The other standouts in the cast are a very young Bonnie Bedelia as the extremely pregnant Ruby clinging in exhaustion to her husband, Susannah York as the unstable starlet Alice, Red Buttons as seen-it-all Sailor, and Gig Young who upturned his long-established light comedy image as the Machiavellian dance emcee Rocky.

You will likely recognize Al Lewis (Grandpa on ""The Munsters"") as Rocky's mercenary assistant Turkey and Michael Conrad (Sgt. Phil Esterhaus on ""Hill Street Blues"") as the cynical roller skating referee. The fly in the ointment is wide-eyed Michael Sarrazin, who plays the circumstantial protagonist Robert Syverton with an utter lack of depth. Pollack unfortunately uses a flash-forward technique with Robert which punctuates the story unnecessarily. However, when he sticks to the dance hall, he is quite masterful, especially in the two defining derby scenes where he fully captures the desperation of the contestants in a grueling, humiliating foot race. Harry Horner's period production and Philip H. Lathrop's darkly lit cinematography effectively evoke the sleaziness and claustrophobia within the hall in measured detail.

From the viewpoint of the Great Depression that's the essential leftist political viewpoint, which I don't share but can appreciate the thought. But unless the theme is ""bring on the Revolution, tear everything down and start over"", why make this movie?

I liked the main characters and just waited and waited for the storyline to have them do anything positive. They never do.

763771,5,630401709X,"In this age of ""Reality"" TV shows like ""Survivor"",  in which ""The Most Devious and Unscrupulous Person Wins"" for a grand prize of a million dollars, the grim reality of the Great Depression makes inconsequential dreck like this look like a walk in the park.  Sydney Pollack's ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"", based on the novella by Horace McCoy, is a harrowing heartbreaking , and unforgettable experience. Set in Southern California in 1932, ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"" is the tale of a marathon dance, and the desperate people who participate in it.  For those of you who don't know what a marathon dance was, couples had to dance for 2 hours, take a 10 minute break to sleep or eat, and then dance again....and again...and again. These grueling endurance contests went on for weeks, and the last remaining couple on the dance floor would win the Grand Prize...if they were still alive and/or still conscious enough to claim it....while spectators watched the whole grotesque show.

Jane Fonda (in the performance of her career, IMO) plays Gloria Beatty, an embittered young woman who has had more than her fair share of hard knocks. Her dance partner is the dreamy-eyed and nave country boy Robert Syverton (Michael Sarrazin), Among the other contestants are a flinty, middle-aged sailor (Red Buttons), aspiring actress Alice LeBlanc (Susannah York) and her partner  Joel (Robert Fields), and hayseed couple James and Ruby (Bruce Dern and Bonnie Bedelia). Presiding over the dance is the cynical emcee Rocky (Gig Young, in an Oscar-winning performance) The action of the film covers the weeks that transpire during the dance, and the physical, emotional, and mental toll that it takes on the contestants is, quite simply, horrifying. These people were struggling for their lives, when just the prospect of having a meal was a very precious thing, not to mention a job, a home, some self-respect. Dreams are shattered, someone dies during this hellish dance (Red Buttons' death scene, from a massive heart attack during ""The Derby"", a grueling track race, is unforgettable), and Alice LeBlanc, whose somewhat fragile grip on reality finally gives way, finally loses her mind. And there's still more to come, folks!

The performances are top-notch and disturbingly believable. Jane Fonda's performance isn't merely a performance...it's a fist in your face. Gig Young isn't merely smarmy, he's just someone who has seen it all, and who probably cant muster up any sorrow anymore. The supporting cast is great, including Allyn Mclerie ,  Michael Conrad, Al ""Grandpa Munster"" Lewis, Madge Kennedy, and Paul Mantee. Director Pollack wisely shot the film in sequence, and the actors look like they've been to Hell (and not necessarily back) by the film's end. The production and costumes are very accurate, (tho the men's hairstyles belie the year in which the film was made, 1969, they're not quite accurate for the 1930s), the music is not only correct, but the choice of songs is quite poignant indeed (""The Best Things in Life are Free"", ""I Found a Million Dollar Baby in a Five and Ten Cent Store"").

The picture and sound quality on the DVD are excellent, and the film is presented in its correct widescreen format. Sadly, there are no extras on the DVD, which is a pity.

This is a must-see film for people seeking to see true-to-life drama, and it is also a reminder of how fortunate we are these days. My parents lived through the Depression as children, and they were not easy times. This is definitely not a ""feel good"" film...but then, we can't always be happy idiots, can we?",1166745600,36,3591,4.951827242524917
763772,4,630401709X,"Well, this was the movie that in which Jane Fonda got serious and finally proved she could act.  At least, that's my memory of the hype that swirled about THEY SHOOT HORSES when it was released in 1969.  Of course, since her most recent project prior to this was BARBARELLA, almost anything would have seemed weighty by comparison. Jane had, as fans will tell you, done a few dramatic turns before, along with the romantic comedies she was perhaps best known for, but HORSES really did seem like a sea changer.  Emerging from her breakup with Roger Vadim, she was actively looking for ""serious"" projects, becoming newly politicized (if not yet radicalized) and beginning to identify herself with a 60s Zeitgeist that as a Hollywood (and Parisienne) starlet, was almost certainly alien (and therefore a little exotic) to her.

Some may find a certain irony in the fact that the first hint of her embracing that 60s ""Zeitgeist"" proved to be a film set in the 1930s--and based on a novel from that era to boot.  But BONNIE AND CLYDE had already proven that the Depression era could serve as some kind of distorted(?) mirror image for the turbulent 60s.  Whatever the difference in the nation's economic picture between the two eras, they were both times when the validity of the American Dream was called into question.

Very likely, the rapidly transforming Fonda identified with the anger and bitterness of her marathon dancing character Gloria.  What she apparently did not share, however, was her character's nihilism.  At this point in her life, Jane Fonda was embracing the possibility of personal fulfillment through political change, something her cynical character of 35 years previous would likely never have dreamed of.

That was the beauty of the 60s, however, one man's (or woman's) cry of existential despair was another's political statement.  And both views could be legitimate takes on this film.  I was all of 17 when I first saw HORSES, so I found myself veering between both interpretations myself--alternately seeing it as a cry of despair and a call to arms.

Nowadays, I lean more toward the former.  THEY SHOOT HORSES, DON'T THEY seems to function better as a bleak commentary on the human condition than as a political manifesto.  Yes, the brutal--literally deadly--dance marathon can be viewed as the ultimate expression of capitalism's cruelty and exploitativeness.  But it's also, more likely, a metaphor for the above cited human condition itself, one in which no political solution is possible.  The claustrophobic setting (we only leave the actual dancehall in a few flashbacks and flashforwards) suggests as much.  This is not just life in Depression Era America.  This is LIFE.

Take it or leave it.  Gloria ultimately opts for the latter.

****************************

I write this a few days after the death of one of Fonda's co-stars in this project.  Irnoically, while re-viewing this film last week, I found myself wondering if Red Buttons were still alive.  I just didn't know, even though I am usually pretty good at ""Dead or Alive"" quizzes.  His performance as an older participant in the marathon--initially full of spirit and then becming progressively more despairing--is a key element of the film.  Originally a comic actor, Buttons had already proven himself several times over as a dramatic one by this time (including an Oscar winning turn in SAYONARA).  Still, he was rarely better than he was in this film.  His was a heartbreaking performance, literally as well as figuratively.

And I would be remiss not to mention the rest of the cast as well--all of whom were remarkable in their ways, even those like Bonnie Bedelia and Bruce Dern, who did not merit much actual screentime.  And the film was something of a high point in the careers of Susannah York and, especially, Gig Young, who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as Rocky, the jaded, but not entirely heartless, Master of Ceremonies.

What a catchy sentence -
Yet, I decided to watch this movie with no real expectations.  The cynical side of me thought, ""Jane Fonda sweating on the dance floor - been there, done that, right?""  However, when I sat down and actually watched this film, I couldn't help but  become seduced by its ghastly, tortured - yet, haunting scenes that absolutely mesmerized one of the deepest corners of my heart.
(Okay, okay - I know it's a bit DRAMATIC but I'm just telling you how I feel.)

Nope -
I've never been in a dance contest.  In fact, I don't even know how to dance since I was blessed with two left feet.  But the determination, the desperation, and the perverse hollowness was something I personally somehow found all too familiar.

Don't get me wrong.
I'm not homeless or starving.
I was just in the fashion industry for too long.

Alexander McQueen staged a show based on this movie on one of his past collections.  I suppose one can find beauty in anything if they know how to interpret it right.

Anyway, Jane Fonda was amazing and Gig Young was fantastic.
In spite of his scandalous life (which I once read about) the man definately deserved his Oscar.

Last note -
You don't have to be in the ""fashion industry"" to relate to this movie.
Just watch it.

763774,5,630401709X,"The story opens at the height of the Depression in a seedy, boardwalk auditorium where a dance marathon is about to begin.  Couples who have neither money nor hope will compete for a prize of $1500 by dancing the longest - virtually non-stop.  We get to know and empathize with several couples as they dance for hours, days, and even weeks before a strange crowd of spectators who throw pennies and cheer for the ""show.""  Bitter and tired-of-life Gloria (Jane Fonda) is paired with Robert (Michael Sarrazin), a wide-eyed innocent from the country.  The marathon is incredibly grueling and dehumanizing, and that's just the way the manic host (Oscar winner Gig Young) likes it.

This is a fascinating look at the dance marathons that really took place during the Depression, when people were willing to risk their health (and their lives) for the meals that were provided and a chance at the money.  Each of the dancers we meet is unique, sympathetic, and believable.  Fonda gives a masterful performance as the hopeless Gloria.  At the end, she utters the wonderful and haunting title line.  Sarrazin is good, but doesn't quite have the star quality that Fonda does.

It's a sad film that brings to mind the days when bored Romans watched bloodied gladiators fight to the death.  The story is fittingly left unresolved,  just like the bleak lives of the contestants.  I recommend this outstanding film, directed by Sydney Pollack.

My favorite line: Gloria is assigned a new dance partner - a bad match at a bad time. She is sinking into delirium & muses about putting a pet out of its misery.

763836,5,630401709X,"This film is a unique experience.  It is a tale set during the Great Depression in the setting of a Dance Marathon where hope and perseverence are seemingly the only factors driving the contestants.  Eventually, after days and days, the contestants rise up and plod on more out of a sense of habit and expected exhaustion.  Near the end of the story it matters very little who will win but rather who is still dancing.  Each couple pushes themselves to the brink of collapse...and beyond.  This is a truly fascinating tale about living on through the worst of times even though the best of times is nowhere in sight.  As for the acting there are many standout performances, my particular favorites being Jane Fonda and Gig Young.  Jane Fonda plays a character cast in iron (in fact, she and her dance partner are sponsored at one point and forced to where jackets advertising ""Jonathan's Iron Tonic""), but as she progresses through the competition she slowly begins to break down.  Piece by piece is thrown aside; her staunchly moral character at the beginning of the story gradually unravels until she is an empty shell, devoid of hopeful emotions.  Gig Young's performance is no less mesmerizing as the Master of Ceremonies selling suffering to the spectators at two bits a head.  But just when you think you've pegged the villain of the story he shows that he too is a lost soul trapped on the ""merry-go-round"" of life and conveys compassion and understanding to those most in need.  His performance garnered him a well-deserved Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.  The actual filmmaking is edgy and spectacular.  With all the dancers struggling to stay upright during a portion of the Dance Marathon called the ""Derby"" the background music is light-hearted and frollicking while the contestants are gasping for breath, stumbling in pain, all for the sake of entertainment.  They are dancing and racing toward a cash prize, but their anguish is on display for all who pay to see it.  There are also some flash-forward scenes that are effectively shot on sound stages, with all the surrounding echo in the chamber as the main character speaks, adding to the reflective quality of his remembrance.  This film is crammed with many brilliant scenes that make it a remarkable experience to behold.  Highly recommended.  ""The Marathon goes on and on and on.""",1106006400,5,2352,4.8816120906801
763837,5,630401709X,"The Great Depression, always written with capital letters to denote the seriousness of the event, led to great problems far beyond our borders. One of the causes of the Second World War originated in a Germany plagued by economic problems far worse than what America went through. But things were bad here, too. Although far more people kept their jobs than ones who didn't, millions of Americans queued up in soup lines, wandered the country in search of work, and couldn't pay their bills. The New Deal, despite the fawning adoration these policies receive today, did little to alleviate economic woes in the long term. Some turned to crime to make ends meet, hence the rise of Dillinger and the other famous bank robbers, but some resorted to competing in particularly grotesque public spectacles referred to as dance marathons. A grinding trial of endurance for participants, dance marathons saw couples signing up to dance for extended periods of time, sometimes up to a month or longer with only short breaks for food and sleep, in order to win a bundle of money. Audiences showed up to watch, bet on, and cheer these unfortunate wretches. Fortunately, states eventually passed laws banning these scurrilous events.

""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"" is a cinematic adaptation of a Horace McCoy novella of the same name. The star of the picture is Gloria (Jane Fonda), a world-weary young lady who signs up for the latest contest because she has nothing left to live for. Needing a partner, she spies a shy young fellow named Robert (Michael Sarrazin) watching the proceedings from a distance and convinces him to join up as her dance mate. Competition looks fierce, though. Sailor (Red Buttons) and his partner Shirl (Allyn Ann McLerie) look like they might put out some effort despite their advanced age. So do James (Bruce Dern) and his wife Ruby (Bonnie Bedelia) who, although pregnant, helped her man win a contest in another state. One individual who definitely looks like she won't make it is glamour girl Alice (Susannah York), whose interest lies in dolling herself up like a movie star in order to draw attention from any potential talent agents in the audience. Presiding over this gladiatorial madness is the cynical emcee Rocky (Gig Young). He stands at a microphone on the stage belting out hour after hour of running commentary on the contestants, inventing wild stories about their backgrounds in order to pump up the audience. His sole purpose in life is to put on a good show, and he won't allow any of the dancers to do anything that jeopardizes that goal.

Once the contest begins, what follows is an experience that leaves the viewer as emotionally and physically drained as the contestants. Hours turn into days, days into weeks as the participants grind away on the dance floor. Couples start to slip away, either quitting and walking off voluntarily or collapsing in a heap on the floor. Tensions pull the dancers apart, with new couplings made, broken, and reformed as time goes by. When attendance starts to lag, Rocky and his cohorts, including Al Lewis and Michael Conrad as Turkey and Rollo respectively, institute a fun new game, the Derby. This barbaric ritual requires the surviving contenders to trot madly around the outer edge of the dance floor, with the woman holding on to the man's belt, in a heel and toe race of exhausting dimensions. It's a nifty way to fire up the crowds as well as pare down the number of couples. It's also one of the sickest things you're likely to see in a film. No wonder that Gloria begins to lose all hope of ever emerging from the hole that constitutes her existence. Her exchanges with Rocky take on unsavory aspects as she fervently attempts to stay in the game. It's almost as though she senses what her fate must be if she fails to win the prize. When she finally learns the truth behind the dance contest, she must make a decision of life and death importance for both her and Robert.

Every performer with significant screen time turns in a stellar performance. It's Hanoi Jane and Gig Young that steal the show, though. I hate to admit it considering her unofficial status as a traitor to the country that allowed her to live in comfort her entire life, but Fonda really drives it home with her portrayal of the exhausted Gloria. The bitterness in her eyes and her icy tones convincingly convey the impression of a human being dangling at the end of her shattered life. Just as good, if not better, is Gig Young. His is a more challenging part in that he must simultaneously express the mentality of a ruthless self-promoter while occasionally showing us his concern for the contestants, and even then you're never quite sure whether he provides comfort because of a kind heart or whether it's just another ploy to keep the show going. Whatever the case his scene with a delusional Alice ranks as among the best in a movie loaded with unforgettable moments. The talent aside, ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"" works so well because the film uses the cruelty of the dance marathon as a metaphor for the callous disregard people show for the less fortunate.

I'm slightly disappointed with the MGM DVD version. The only extra on the disc is a trailer, surprising considering how many Academy Awards this film won the year it came out. I've heard of an earlier Anchor Bay release with better audio and better extras, so hopefully that disc or a similar version will receive a reissue at some point in the future. I find it difficult to believe Hanoi Jane wouldn't want to do a commentary for the film, unless she's one of those people who refuse to comment about her work. I recommend both the film and McCoy's searing novella.",1105660800,3,5703,4.763397371081901
763838,4,630401709X,"Movie: ***** DVD Transfer: ***** DVD Extras: **

Impeccable performances distinguish this penetrating examination of Depression-era America in which a dance marathon acts as a microcosm of the world for the desperate contestants and the calculating producers of the event.  Jane Fonda's breakthrough performance as the cynical and embittered Gloria is the centerpiece of the film; the actress is nothing short of brilliant as she creates a character who is completely unsentimental and largely unsympathetic, but nonetheless humanly understandable.  Fonda's wrenching tour de force is ably supported by a great cast of professionals all performing at the peak of their abilities, including Susannah York as a would-be starlet desperate to be discovered (her final scene is gut-wrenching); Michael Sarrazin as the drifter who becomes Fonda's dancing partner through a twist of fate; Bonnie Bedelia and Bruce Dern as a hard-luck couple trying to beat the odds; Michael Conrad and Al (""Grandpa Munster"") Lewis as employees of the marathon; and especially, Gig Young in his Oscar-winning turn as the marathon's sardonic and manipulative emcee.

Also of note are the film's remarkable achievements in makeup and editing.  The majority of the action takes place in one location over a period of several weeks, with the characters slowly losing their vitality and letting their appearances go as exhaustion and numbness set in.  The makeup artists and wardrobe team did a fantastic job of providing visual continuity for the stars and many extras over the film's nearly two-hour running time; no small feat there!  And the razor-sharp editing contributes enormously to the film's pace, alternating lengthy stretches of dialogue and inaction with bravura, manic sequences in which rapid cuts create the impression of a society run amok.

The new MGM Home Video of this neglected gem offers clean, sharp video and crisp sound.  Viewed on a 57"" widescreen monitor, my copy looked and sounded perfect; especially effective were the scenes at the beginning of the film when a series of startling reports resembled the sound of a gun being fired.  The extras include only the Original Theatrical Trailer - which is a treat - but leaves the curious viewer wanting more.

Although she is somewhat repellent, her playing makes the audience feel empathy for her character: an affecting performance. The ultimately tragic Gig Young won his long awaited AA for his portrait of the crude barker; his pitches on the mike cheapen every human emotion, yet paradoxically, he's also sensitive and empathic. The director, Sydney Pollack, isn't exactly inventive, but he holds a tight rein over his actors; they work well for him, and he keeps the grisly situation going with energy and drive. Michael Sarrazin is memorable as the weak, puppy dog-eyed murderer, and the rest of the excellent cast is genuinely terrific: Bonnie Bedelia, Bruce Dern and Red Buttons.",1026432000,4,1029,5.39751552795031
763927,5,630401709X,"One of the most common motifs of the Middle Ages was that of the wheel of fortune. The apex being the best of luck, good fortune and plenty. The low point being misery or that of the dispossessed. The idea that one could at one time or another end up anywhere on the wheel must have been great solace to those who felt they were at the bottom.
In Sydney Pollack's 1969 film, `They Shoot Horses, Don't They?' we are given this idea of life in a microcosm. The film, set during the Great Depression is a perfect representation of the same kind of desperation felt during the Middle Ages (or any age, for that matter). This film looks at the Great Depression, and the gimick of a Dance Marathon as a depiction of times in history when the fear of utter loss is very acute. The people facing this challenge are represented in the film by the marathon dancers. The dancers are an ensemble cast including: Jane Fonda as Gloria Beatty, Michael Sarrazin as Robert Syverton, Susannah York as Alice LeBlanc, Red Buttons as `Sailor,' Bonnie Bedelia as Ruby, Bruce Dern as James, and other minor characters.
Of course, certain people have always seemed to be outside of the desperation of life. There are peoples whose fortunes seem set, and sometimes may even seem to be puppet-masters pulling the strings. This was represented in the film by the characters such as Gig Young as `Rocky,' and his partner Al Lewis (III) as `Turkey.' Even an audience members seemed to be one of the quasi-puppet-masters (the audience were people who paid to come see these grueling marathons as entertainment) most notably represented by Madge Kennedy as Mrs. Laydon. In this respect it reminded me of Greek Tragedy (mainly the Ilyad,) with the non-dancing cast as part of the pantheon of gods. Sometimes they are empathetic to the mortals (the cast on the dance floor). Just as in the Greek stories, the gods are pulling for their own personal favorite.
This film is an example of good acting. The acting is so critical to the enjoyment of an otherwise very depressing story. Each of the actors was completely believable in the part the played. No one's acting was `over the top.' I would note however, that Jane Fonda's character, Gloria, was a bit too void of emotion, other than bitterness, until the very end. Her story-telling scene with her second partner was delivered a little too flatly. On the positive side, it she is also in one of the best scenes in the film, which I will address in a minute.
It was the lesser characters that really brought the most credibility to the story and the film. Each of the folks were merely background and then, we are sucked into the film, just as though we were in the audience of the dance hall, they'd pass near... where we could almost hear their individual stories... just for a moment, and then they'd swirl, sway or stagger away... back into oblivion.
As we watched the film we can feel their desperation. In the scenes of the track, One might get the sense, `that's what I am doing. I am one of them... a hamster on the treadmill, all for the next silver dollar. For someone else's entertainment...'
The female character I liked the most was a difficult decision. The Mrs. Laydon character (fits the Greek Goddess Hera role, to continue my earlier analogy...) sat with her kerchief waving, her eyes full of compassion. Alice LeBlanc, the platinum coifed, her eyes hollow as she finally lost touch with the only thing she had to cling to... her hope for stardom extinguished in the shower, just before she is escorted out, `exit, stage right...' As touching and real as these two women played their parts, I felt that Rocky had it right when he told Gloria, `I may not know a winner when I see one, but I sure know a loser...' and Ruby was certainly not. Ruby was determined to give the baby she was carrying a fighting chance in life... even off screen, you could sense her determination. So, Ruby gets my vote for most convincing female role.
The male character that provided the best acting was tough, but the competition was not as stiff as competition between the women. Rocky played the Zeus role to a `T'. But it was the feisty determination and ultimate collapse of `Sailor' that won me over. His character was perhaps the most human of the men. He really wanted to win it, you could sense that. At the same time he was not above feeling for some of the people he was competing against, encouraging them.
I enjoyed the picture, and I found it relevant to today's marathon. The silicon-valley is full of folks all competing for that somewhat empty promise and the same dollar. One of the wisest scenes of the movie was the dialogue between Rocky and Gloria. She enters his office to ask him to change the rules. He's busy at something else. She asks what he's doing and he points out that he's been keeping tabs on everyone. The prize will be reconciled after the bills are exacted. This is life. Anyone who's had a run of misfortune could relate to that. I was reluctant to watch the film after all these years, especially with my aversion to Jane Fonda. Nevertheless, it was perhaps one of the best films of the late sixties/early seventies.",1021852800,6,5173,4.5995670995671

763929,1,630401709X,"Compared to Horace McCoy's great novel it's based upon, this movie is totally unconsistent... It's filled with mistakes, from the beginning to the ending. The movie is supposed to take place in Hollywood, but no movie star is introduced to the dancers in the audience. The movie is supposed to take place in a closed room, where passions should break out; but there is no fighting, not a single fight, as McCoy's novel is filled with them. The movie is supposed to take place in a dancing hall, but we can't see any public bar. The movie is supposed to take place in the 30's; but we don't see any cops or gangsters. The public wedding sequence has disappeared, and Gloria, played by very glamour Jane Fonda, loses a lot of her mystery; she never gives us the feeling that she wants to die, she only curses and groans and says things like 'I can't sleep, I'm too tired'; so in the end, when she asks Robert to shoot her in the head, it's more shocking than anything else and it doesn't make much sense.
Some other stupid stuff: in McCoy's novel, Mrs. Layden gets killed in the end. In the movie she's not, so we can wonder why she doesn't come to Robert and try to help him, during the trial. But the most enormous thing is that derby track that is rectangular, instead of being oval. It's totally ridiculous! Despite all those mistakes the movie works rather well, but I think it's quite overrated. When I saw it for the first time I was greatly disappointed. I expected to discover a great ""noir"" movie as good as the novel, maybe better, but I saw just an academic, overcolored, clean, well-thinking melodrama filled with nonsense, in the Hollywood style. Pollack's biggest mistake is to have taken a short novel and put all its strongest elements away (especially the sequence of the public wedding or the one showing Gloria facing the two women from the Mothers' League).

763989,5,630401709X,"If you're ever in the mood for a depressing movie, you would be hard pressed to do better than this one.  The film takes place in 1932 California & depicts one of the darkest hours of American history:  the great depression.
During this turbulant time, one of the most popular ways for jobless & homeless people to try (almost always in vain) to make a buck was to participate in a dancethon.  These were like a circus freak show, only much worse.  10s of couples would start the dancethon in hopes of being the ""last couple standing"" to win the prize money.  There was usually a 10 minute break every 2 hours, and a few hours of sleep @ night.  Other than that, they were in constant motion.  They even had to eat while standing up & dancing.
The film stars Jane Fonda and Bonnie Bedelia in their younger years.  However, it is Gig Young, playing the ruthless & sadistic club owner who steals the show.  Young's character is the exemplar of swindlers in the 1930s who generated a profit by marketing the old dictum that ""desperate times call for desperate measures.""
As I was watching this movie, it struck me that the prize money, for which the contestants on-screen were undergoing the most unimaginable and grueling agony, was actually worth less than the HDTV upon which I was watching the film.  Granted, $1,500 went a lot further in the 1930s than today.  Nevertheless, it was a humbling thought.
The scariest part about this movie is that it's not about something out of the middle ages.  Nor does it detail the austere rites of some distant, reclusive & primitive 3rd world country.  Rather, it is something that really happened IN THIS COUNTRY, and it occurred in the 20th century.  So many times we tend to think that we are way past the barbarisms and atrocities that we associate with our long ago ancestors.  This story makes crystal clear that fallacy of believing that.  As Mark Twain would say, the rumours of human cruelty's demise have been greatly exaggerated.
This is a film that depicts social Darwinism in its most austere and extreme manifistation.  The symbolism re: shooting lame horses when they can no longer run is incredibly trenchant.  If you view this movie, I guarantee you that it will be with you for the rest of your life.",1015113600,15,2258,4.630653266331659
763990,5,630401709X,"I've read a number of the customer reviews, agreed with them, and only wish I could think of more superlatives for this phenomenal achievement in filmmaking. You cannot come away from this film without being moved by its amazing, thought-provoking power. The world created by Pollack draws you in so completely (along with brilliant sets, cinematography, editing and, especially, the very well-chosen music) that you cannot help thinking ""There but for the grace of God, Go I"". What many don't realize is that this film is on the record books of the Academy for many reasons; no other film received as many Oscar nominations as this (9) without being nominated for Best Picture. Two artists who have made unforgettable marks upon the history of American film (Pollack and Fonda) received their first of many Oscar nominations. As I mentioned, there's not much more to say about this film experience that hasn't been said, though I will repeat: SEE THIS FILM. If you're any kind of a film fan, this is an essential addition to your library. The Widescreen version and DVD are 2.35:1, the ONLY way to view this film. With few exceptions, this film gives more attention to detail than any I can recall. I also realize that most people that might read this are aware of its brilliance. Sad to think this film is being missed by so many.",987292800,24,1332,4.770562770562771
763991,5,630401709X,"This movie was off-handedly mentioned to me by a friend -  I had never heard of it before.  I questioned others about it, and they couldn't tell me much, even those who had seen it.  I went to the video store, and the clerk had to pull it from the ""archive"" section... see a pattern?
It's sad when a movie this intricate doesn't get longstanding notice.  It did win awards and recognition, and even some notoriety, in its time, but it's certainly not discussed alongside other classics these days, and I plan do do my very little part to remedy this by simple word-of-mouth.  So buy/rent this movie and see how a Depression-era dance marathon encapsulates the game of life.  This is a top-notch story with great direction and acting and an interesting non-linear sequencing that will get your attention.  The movie will likely depress you overall, but life doesn't guarantee a happy ending.",974851200,5,890,4.740259740259741
763992,5,630401709X,"Sydney Pollack has given the world some of most memorable and engrossing films ever such as ""The Way We Were,"" ""Out of Africa,"" ""Tootsie"", and ""The Firm."" However, most seem to forget about this little masterpiece he helmed back in 1969, about a dance marathon that causes more disillusionment that being told your life is a worthless shame. Jane Fonda heads out the cast as a struggling actress who seeks out the dance marathon as a means of survival during the Great Depression. Marathons of this type were popular, luring in poor folks to see who would be willing to go so far to win a cash prize. Susannah York is another actress from Hollywood who has had her share of bad luck and it gets worse and worse as the marathon wears on. Red Buttons is a sailor who has seen his share of human loss and heartache but matters to almost nothing when he sees what this marathon will do to its contestants. Gig Young is well-cast as the scheming marathon promoter who loves to sit back and watch the people collapse and give up. He puts the show on soley for human spectacle and idiotic display. What he does to select contestants will have you loathing and seething with hatred for his character. He is so convincing in the role it won him the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Young, who was a major comedy star back in the 1940-50's, was sinking into deep melancholy over life and his work and the Oscar did little to nothing to help him. In 1978 he shot his wife and then himself, always convinced that he was the result of an accidental pregnancy. However, despite this pitiful knowledge, he has given the entertainment world some of the best work we've ever seen, including his own TV show in the 50's in which he went behind the scenes of movies in production.
This film was shot entirely in sequence and Pollack had his cast rehearse and dance for 12 straight hours before he put them in front of the camera, so you are basically seeing it as it was filmed. The editing makes it look more frenzied and more grueling to watch, especially those derby scenes. Human cruelty never looked more artistic or more disheartening. Dance marathons were eventually banned by law and this film shows just why that happened.
Nominated for nine Academy Awards---Best Director (Pollack), Actress (Fonda), Supporting Actor (Gig Young, who won the Oscar), Supporting Actress (York), Screenplay Adaptation from the novel by Horace McCoy, Art Direction, Costume Design, Music Score Adaptation, and Film Editing. It is a travesty that it was not nominated for Best Picture. This is one of those little known films from the dusk of Hollywood's Golden Age and should not be missed. It should be revived for a whole new generation to discover and be mesmerized by.",971740800,25,2742,4.667355371900826

763994,5,630401709X,"In George Eells, book "" Final Gig"" , he talks about Gig Young Finally getting that coveted Oscar for "" They Shoot Horses..Dont  They"" For a normal person this victory would have been a new episode  in a career. For Gig Young it was just a footnote.
The casting of Gig  Young in this film was a great break . The nuance he brought to the  character of Rocky had all the fatalistic ingredients.
The cast is  uniformly superb..and I think this is Jane Fonda,s best performance. She is  a totally cynical and self destructive person on her way to tragedy and  could care less. Her moments with Young are priceless. Their ineteractions  and facial close ups are devastating. Bruce Dern shows again another very  eccentric job in his role and Michael Sarrazin is fine as a free soul who  is wandering through life.
Staging and Cinematography have yet to be  matched in a film like this. The dance of life and the dancers plight are  bared to the audience culminating in both a shattering conclusion and an  unending shallow promise to the audience..for the continuation and lunacy  of life in that period ..Brilliant Film",967507200,3,1115,4.651282051282052

763996,5,630401709X,"To me Pollack & company perfectly realized Horace McCoy's saturnine vision. This is the most relentless, hard-knuckled, diabolically-paced piece of filmmaking ever. There is not a dishonest moment in the movie.  It's also the greatest example of ensemble acting I've ever seen on screen  as well. Everyone involved in the production gave every ounce of themselves  and it shows. It may have finished off Gig Young. His portrayal of the  ""Yowzer, Yowzering"" MC is the most cynical, world-weary  characterization ever expressed on celluloid. It doesn't surprise me that  he checked out in real life shortly after winning an Oscar for his  supporting role. Jane Fonda gives the performance of her life as Gloria.  She would have won an Oscar here if she hadn't recently received one for  Klute. There's no use in singling out anyone else, though Suzannah York  truly deserved her Oscar as well. Everyone in this movie deserved an Oscar.  I would have given one to the second-grip, if there were an award for that.
The soundtrack is absolutely first-rate. I owned it on vinyl, but can't  find it on CD unfortunately. If anyone out there is aware of a CD release,  would you please send me mail? I've never known another soundtrack that  served as such perfect accompaniment to the action on screen. Sometimes it  served as a great vehicle for irony (as if this film needed any more of  that!). The second ""Derby"" sequence is a great case-in-point. As  The Sailor (Red Buttons) is literally expiring from exhaustion, the band is  playing ""By the Sea, By the Sea, By the Beautiful Sea."" The  dancehall is situated on a pier above the Pacific. The metaphors come fast  and furious in this movie. It rewards repeated viewings. McCoy's novel is  pretty good too, along the lines of Nathaniel West's Day of the Locust.
For $14, you can't make a better investment if you are any kind of film  buff or just want a good kick in the emotional keister. Not for the  sentimental type. About as fierce and unflinching a look into the depths of  the human spirit as you are likely to come across. One of the finest movies  ever.",962064000,13,2110,4.746556473829201

763998,5,630401709X,"Not for the squeamish or those looking for ""a good time"" in movie entertainment. Set in depression era L.A. at an endless dance marathon, Jane Fonda and Michael Sarrazin play variations on  down-&-outers of the period. Jane's a would-be acrtress who's done a  little extra work & now wants more; Michael is just a farmboy cajoled  into the dance marathon by emcee Gig Young. Young gives a wonderful  performance as the sardonic, wicked emcee -- more vocal & abrasive than  any other character in the movie! Young won an Oscar for best supporting  actor for his job handling the mike & the dancers.  There isn't much  real dancing -- the characters are endlessly exhausted and weary from  staying on their feet trying to win measly prizes along the way &  wishing to win the big final prize. Big climactic scenes: the heal-and-toe  race to eliminate dancers & what drives Suzannah York's character over  the edge! Other standout performances are by Red Buttons, as an old-time  sailor who's tough as nails; Suzannah York, as a fey British high-society  actress who gets taken down quite a few notches; also, look for Al Lewis,  the grandfather from the ol' Munsters TV show, as assistant emcee at the  dance marathon. More actor trivia: the actor who played the Sargent on the  first years of Hill Street Blues is also a dance floor bouncer. Other  miniscule roles with big actors: Allyn Ann McClearie as Buttons's  girlfriend/partner; Bonnie Bedalia & Bruce Dern as the expectant couple  struggling to stay afoot against all odds. For serious trivia nuts, anyone  who knows who Paul Mantee is will recognize him as one of the other dance  floor bouncers!
The movie was made in 1969/70 and it's full of sixties  angst and morbid ideologies about the plight of man & ""man's  inhumanity to man"" (vis-a-vis the Vietnam War period). On its own,  ""Horses"" has stood the test of time & looks tough &  coarse today with outstanding performances all around. If you can take all  the heartache, you'll find a strong metaphorical film here! I remember how  controversial this movie was when it came out. It's still abrasive, but see  if our society has changed at all in it's view of the subject matter. This  is for people who don't mind a depressing dose of reality drama. Oh, almost  forgot: there's the film's theme song ""Easy Come & Easy Go""  which languishes around the background and adds eerie resonance to the  whole film! When will REM record this & crank up more sixties ennui!  Peace, brothers & sisters!",945043200,16,2505,4.775700934579439

Based on the Existentialist novel by American Horace McCoy, the film improves on the novel because of its brilliant cast. Gig Young and Jane Fonda -- up until this film, light-weights, good actors who mostly starred in froth -- are brilliant, along with Red Buttons (also in a serious role), Samantha York, the under-appreciated Bonnie Bedelia and Michael Sarrazin (SOMETIMES A GREAT NOTION). Even though Pollack was restricted as far as budget was concerned, and the film was made on a soundstage that's significantly smaller than he makes it look, the sense of place and time (the 1930s in west coast America), and the day-to-day life during the Great Depression are palpable. A pitch-perfect combination of great directing, great acting, great editing and great art direction make this one of the best American films of the 1970s -- itself one of the great decades of American film (at least the first half of it).",1510444800,,1118,4.858638743455497
