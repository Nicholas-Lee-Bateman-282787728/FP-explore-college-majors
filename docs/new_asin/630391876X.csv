7854624,1,630391876X,is it just me or was this the biggest load of crap I've ever seen? Ok they find this injured guy and they put him in a top secret place. This jackass lets him loose and thats it.  I only saw this movie because I am a fan of Giovanni Ribisi.  If you wanna be scared by a good horror film rent one of the texas chainsaw massacre movies or Friday the 13th movies. because all the monster is is a bald man with blue sweatpants who yells alot. The only scary thing here is the films budget.,1071360000,,485,3.938775510204082
7854625,3,630391876X,"I was extremely surprised at the high quality of this DTV (direct to video)horror flick. At first glance,I could almost guarantee myself I was not going to like it,especially having seen another similar awful film called The Fear recently. But then again,with a title that stupid,of course I was going to feel inclined to turn away. I mean it,what a stupid title,The Mind Ripper! Anyone who saw it with a title like that would instantly dismiss it as cheap pap. If they had given it the title The Outpost like over in America,I think a lot more people would have given this extremely pleasantly surprising little flick a chance. The story is original,well thought out,with characters you can really care about. It's amazing how much you end up feeling for the brother character,especially towards the end where he breaks down in tears while admitting his feelings to his sister. The monster is very impressive for the no doubt small budget the film had,and the running time is well adjusted at just over an hour and a half. If you come across this,please don't be put off by that stupid title,give it a chance,it's really worth seeing.",993081600,,1135,4.795918367346939
7854626,2,630391876X,"I found this film a bit boring to be honest and although Wes Craven had a little involvement, it was his son who produced this film. The whole thing was like ALIEN because of the environment and the acting was not all that  good except for Lance Henriksen who has starred in so many top movies. MIND  RIPPER is a film that I couldn't watch more than twice and a lot of people  may find it a complete bore, but still, the F/X/ are not too bad.",951609600,,442,4.057471264367816
