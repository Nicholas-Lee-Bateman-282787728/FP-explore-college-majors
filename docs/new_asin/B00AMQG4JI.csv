This story should be presented free of charge, to those who have fought and sacrificed for this country.  William F. Hancock Jr.  USN, Vietnam,1966-1970.",1433203200,,248,5.3076923076923075
8554267,5,B00AMQG4JI,"Dave Esposito's ""Captain"" is an amazing tale of war and remembrance that completely abolishes the notion that all of the good stories about World War II have already been told. This gripping story, as projected through former Vietnam War Marine Captain Richard Updaw, is one of tragedy and resurrection, of despair and hope, and of the iron-clad bonds of loyalty that exist among warriors.  As a former military officer and a patriot, I wish that every American kid could see this film.  It reminds us all of the Country we were born in, what it was for us, and what it can be for generations to come.",1358899200,,601,4.607476635514018
8554268,5,B00AMQG4JI,"The Captain

 I thought that this short film assimilated multiple compelling themes in a very engaging and entertaining way.

 "" The Captain"" ostensibly traces the story of a  former Marine and Viet Nam veteran (The Captain) seeking justice and honor for a fallen , semingly forgotten World War 2 fellow Marine.
  Following the Captain's inspiring quest for truth and justice we learn about loyalty, patriotism, history, and the value of being true to your beliefs. I was spellbound for the entire length of this short film and it is worth viewing multiple times.
  I think that it is perfect for a personal collection or as a historical and educational film for students or veterans. It would make a great gift for relatives who are former Marines or any type of Veteran.

Would highly recommend this film.",1358208000,,807,4.867647058823529
