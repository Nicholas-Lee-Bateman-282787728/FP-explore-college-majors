8508754,1,B00725A66E,"I was really looking forward to showing this DVD to my boys in preparation for our family vacation to the East Coast. We were all very disappointed. Jamestown had a history portion and a modern day portion. The history portion is essentially a slightly animated slide show with a modern child character talking to an historical adult character. It is accurate, but dry. We chose not to finish it and instead watched Drive Thru history, which was much longer, but more watchable.",1475107200,2,478,4.841463414634147
