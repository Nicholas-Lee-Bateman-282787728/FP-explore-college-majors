The two that are mentioned on the cover are some classic favorites and it also has the Santa and the three bears cartoon as one of the bonuses. I wish they would have added A Cosmic Christmas as a bonus also. The quality is a big issue with this dvd and would be the one detractor to it. The coloring on the Silent Night cartoon is a problem, namely the snow looks yellow, not kidding it looks like a giant must have relieved himself across the country side lol. And I know it is not supposed to look that way because I also own the vhs version and it is a pretty crisp picture for how old it is. But for now this is the only way to get that cartoon in particular on dvd so I would try it.",1443744000,,739,3.8684210526315788
8101360,5,B000CRFF3S,"I was not sure if this was the one I was looking for, but at the affordable price of $0.05.....what did I have to lose?  I was pleasantly surprised upon playing the disc that, yes!, this was the animated cheapy that used to be televised every Christmas season in the NYC area, usually afternoons about a day or two before Christmas Eve.  In spite of this being an obvious tape-to-DVD quickie, it still brought back warm memories of watching this as a kid.....the animation is very limited and stiff but seems to ""work"" with the tale being told....effective background music of Bach & good voice-overs makes this story of how the classic Carol was written...well, as we are told it was written, a mini-classic, not on a level of ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"", but, especially for people that grew up with this every year, a special Christmas memory nonetheless!
