8137770,5,B000H9BVUW,"I like the Dead Ball Era in modern baseball history (approximately 1900-1919).  Ken Burns devotes a lot of time to this era in his Baseball documentary.  Watch the Second Inning if you want to learn about the era before Babe Ruth and the lively ball and the home run.  This was back when games were low scoring and the emphasis was on bunting, hitting singles, doubles, triples, stealing bases, and getting an occasional inside-the-park home run.  It wasn't unusual for one ball to be used for an entire game.  The ball wasn't wound very tightly, so when it was hit, it didn't travel very far.  The ball was altered by pitchers in many ways in order to gain an advantage over hitters.  A lot of ballparks had huge dimensions.  Great pitchers ruled the game.  This was the era of Christy Mathewson, Walter Johnson, Cy Young, Grover Cleveland Alexander, and Babe Ruth.  It was also the era of great hitters like Ty Cobb, Honus Wagner, Sam Crawford, Nap Lajoie, ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson, Eddie Collins, Zack Wheat, and others.

If you didn't know much about baseball's Dead Ball Era, then this documentary will open your eyes.  It was a different era in the early twentieth century.  It wasn't wimpball, that's for sure.

Enjoy this DVD.",1302220800,3,1232,4.723004694835681
8137771,5,B000H9BVUW,"Like all the innings in the Ken Burns Baseball Series, it is fantastic. I have been a life-long baseball fan and every one of this DVDs prior to the 1970s makes me wish I could go back in time and see the game in those different stages of growth. Can you image paying 25 or 50 cents to sit in your favorite stadium now with five cent programs and 10 cent sodas.",1242518400,,361,4.027777777777778
