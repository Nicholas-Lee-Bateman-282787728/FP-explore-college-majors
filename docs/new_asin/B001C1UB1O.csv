8285647,5,B001C1UB1O,"""UR Pre-Approved"" is the brainchild of Mr. Dugdale and Mr. Smith and is a Randall Blaum film (director, producer). Production took almost two years to complete. Over 30 nationally recognized credit and debt experts were interviewed for the film, including Elizabeth Warren and Ed Mierzwinski, and what they have to say will shock most moviegoers who are upset or surprised at the nationally and globally recognized ""Occupy Wall Street"" protests and don't have a clue why people are rising up against financial extortion, bailouts, greed and corruption. Such is the lot of the uninformed, unthinking voter in America today who has been stolen from, legally, by Wall Street, government, and other players ""behind the scenes.""

The film's timeliness and relevance is reflected in the new round of Congressional hearings examining the massive amount of credit card debt that is consuming Americans (over $2 trillion dollars in available credit card credit, alone), skyrocketing interest rates (as much as 1095%), and the unintended, far-reaching effects of the controversial 2006 bankruptcy reform act which, ironically, makes it even more difficult for individual Americans and families to cope with and overcome debt.

San Diego film producer and director, Randall Blaum, a Hollywood veteran of over 25 years, gathered together the team for this project who, after UR PRE-APPROVED, worked with him on the now popular ""MONEY"" song by David Scotland, which is also all about corporate greed and corruption. David Scotland (screenwriter, producer), Joseph Panwitz (co-writer, cinematographer, editor), Patrick Wenk-wolff and others, decided to create a film people would enjoy no matter their age or financial literacy. Mr. Blaum was be at the World Premiere in San Diego to introduce the film.

""UR Pre-Approved"" is no ordinary film documentary but also offers numerous immediate solutions to help viewers understand and address their own debt challenges. And although the film speaks primarily to young people in college or just starting out in careers, the message is for audiences of all ages, including parents and people in credit card debt, and features several ironic and humorous elements and vignettes. OccupyWallStreet protestors will LOVE it -- a film before its time.

""UR Pre-Approved"" is an engaging, empowering, inspiring film for consumers who feel discounted and abused by the world of big business.",1318636800,,2412,5.424
