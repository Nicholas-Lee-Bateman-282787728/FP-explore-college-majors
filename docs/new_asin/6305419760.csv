8001854,5,6305419760,"This DVD was a blind purchase for me, having not seen it previously but being a huge fan of Habanos and Cuba in general.  It is amazing that we are only 90 miles away but know so little about the life and culture of these people, so as an interested person I purchased this DVD.  It was so good that I literally watched it all the way through two times when I first got it.  Far more than your typical documentary about sorting, rolling, and packaging cigars for export, this DVD explores the whole story of the Habano and how it is so tied in with cuban life and culture.  There are many memorable stories told by the people involved in the manufacture and sale of these cigars.  One that stands out for me was when one of the first spanish saw a Tainos indian smoking a huge bundle of rolled leaves, really the first cigar.  He took some tobacco home and repeated this procedure, and wound up in jail because the authorities suspected he was possessed by the devil--emitting smoke from his mouth and sparks from his eyes.  The soundtrack is great--it puts you right there in the vuelta abajo, and the salsa makes you want to dance.  The DVD ends with an interview with Vahe Gerard, maybe THE preeminent scholar of the habano (see my review of the book Havana Cigars), and I love how he tests, smells, and explains the different sizes as if each cigar were a small miracle.  My only complaint is that I wish the video was TWO hours long, because it is that good.  An absolute must for any cigar lover.",1085356800,14,1502,4.370503597122302
8001855,5,6305419760,"This video is a must for cigar aficianados everywhere.  A close, in-depth look at the history of the Cuban cigar - the viewer takes a an educated and  fantastic tour of the tobacco fields, and onto harvest time, into the  factory, and straight to the leather seat where a good brandy is waiting.  Simply the best cigar video ever released...the others don't compare.",940982400,5,366,4.761904761904762
