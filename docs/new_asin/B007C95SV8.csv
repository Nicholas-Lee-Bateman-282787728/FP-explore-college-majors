5077113,5,B007C95SV8,"This video should be watched and taken seriously! I don't know if I could build the generator, but someone out there could figure it out! Anybody who is serious about new clean and free energy should watch this. I think we are close to figuring out the true power of magnetic motors. It's such a clean and free energy. An awesome documentary and theory. Howard Johnson was amazing!",1332201600,5,381,4.617647058823529
5077114,1,B007C95SV8,Hard to believe that people are ignorant enough to buy into this type of B.S.  This is an indictment of our school system of the highest order.,1331856000,9,143,4.296296296296297
8514400,1,B007C95SV8,"Not what it claims. No real useable info / details on the HJ motor that you can read easily.
More of a pile of patent papers that are not that readable and some projects for wind generators.
I would not recommend if you are looking for clear details on HJ magnet motor.",1427328000,3,269,4.1923076923076925

8514402,3,B007C95SV8,Too complicated. Saving for possible use latter,1410825600,,47,5.857142857142857
8514403,3,B007C95SV8,"Way to technical for me to comprehend.  It was beyond my degree of knowledge.  If I attended an electrical engineering program, I have be able to decipher what he was saying.",1400630400,,174,4.580645161290323
8514404,1,B007C95SV8,"Dont buy this.  Few minutes of info.  Rest has nothing to do with topic.

This should not be sold on Amazon",1390867200,,107,4.0
8514405,1,B007C95SV8,Not very informative. No good explanations for the material that was presented. Anyone who is serious about this subject may want to look else where.,1374105600,6,149,5.0
8514406,1,B007C95SV8,the disk had very little to do with the hojo motor and alot to do BS not what I thought I was ordering A person could not build a motor with what was on this disk,1361836800,7,162,3.5277777777777777
8514407,1,B007C95SV8,Most of the content was how to build a wind generator that was a 16:9 format recorded in 4:3 format leaving gray bars on the side where one quarter of the written information should be. The rest of it was not much more than what you would get by going through google.,1356739200,4,267,4.153846153846154
8514408,1,B007C95SV8,"I was hoping for something much better than this.  This was a complete waste of time. It's a home job for sure.  There was only talking for the first 20 minutes of the video, then after than it showed drawings, etc. that can easily be found online.  Half the video is drawings on a wind generator--for no reason whatsoever.  Very lame indeed.",1354147200,3,342,4.467741935483871
8514409,1,B007C95SV8,Purchasing this item for the purpose of building a Johnson motor in your home workshop is not recommended.  This DVD is very boring to watch with 50% of it showing photos of patents by Howard Johnson.  This is not a 'how to' DVD.  You must be an experienced fabricator with access to a diverse collection of tools and supplies.  The average person cannot build this 'motor project' without professional assistance.  Don't waste your time an money with buying this DVD.  You will be disappointed!,1332979200,21,495,4.833333333333333
