7796803,5,1567301681,"Forget about brief nudity (so brief I always miss it).  Forget about this film being categorized as a downer and depressing.  This flick is really about redemption and the miracle of Christmas.  Sure, the plot is depressing, but so are the lives of many abused and disadvantaged people who are brutalized by poverty.  The acting is real, way real, the direction is great, the setting is real and the ending is miraculous.  Set in Provence, this is not your usual fun-in-the-South-of-France fantasy.  It's a take on the lives of many of the agricultural workers there who grow the food others eat with such gusto.  But what makes it so great is what happens on Christmas Eve and how the miracle of Christmas is really about hope, even for a pagan like me.  Get out of your jingoistic rut (OMG, it's a French movie!) and see something that will make you smile and cry and be thankful to be alive.",1376265600,2,894,4.578616352201258
7796804,1,1567301681,"I collect Christmas movies and what a huge disappointment this movie was.
Brief synopsis;
It's about a man who has a wife and family.
He also has a mistress and they have seven children whom he uses as slave labor.
The mistress and seven children live in the depths of poverty.
The man treats his mistress and seven children like worthless property.
The man makes incestuous advances towards his daughter.
It snows for the most depressing Christmas Eve ever.
Profanity from children.
A real downer in my opinion.",1310083200,,512,4.829545454545454
7796805,5,1567301681,"this is one of my life's top movies.

it relates to everybody everywhere.  The daylife of a non-official family, a mother and her 7 children, and the father that is also the boss...

a lesson in true love, beauty, and the important things of life. And also a portrait of the hypocrisy of our times.

a film that everyone should see.",1128384000,7,332,4.39344262295082
7796806,3,1567301681,"This is a nice enough movie and is enjoyable to watch.  It centers on the lives of a small town and its children during a period of hard time.  While there are a few topless scenes of one young girl, this movie should not be purchased for that reason.  If you like old time stories about families struggling to make ends meet and how the lack of money effects everyone then take a look at this movie.

As with all gatekeeper reviews, movies are reviewed solely for their nudity and violence content.  Do not buy this movie if you are looking for nudity, you will be disappointed.",1090886400,10,579,4.373831775700935
