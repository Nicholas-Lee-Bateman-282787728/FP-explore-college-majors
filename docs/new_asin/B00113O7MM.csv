3059275,5,B00113O7MM,"The lovely chipmunks, Simon, Theodore, and Alvin, enter Dave Seville's home and turn it and his life upside down. They turn it into a giant playground. They tear apart the food packages in his cabinets, and flood his home. Before long, his home is a disaster area. But he works out a deal with them to stay with him. They clean the place up.

His girlfriend, with whom he has had an off-and-on relationship, is puzzled by what turns out to be his chipmunk-hiding behavior and his crazy remarks about talking chipmunks. Not exactly an auspicious way to re-win her heart!

Imagine having an important poster presentation at work, only to find out, during the actual presentation, that the chipmunks had drawn crayon figures all over it? What a way for Dave to lose his job!

It takes some time for Dave to persuade others that the chipmunks can sing. Owing to stage fright, they fail to perform in front of Ian Hawke, his associate. But eventually they do, and Hawke thinks up of ways to use the chipmunks in accordance with his selfish desires. Yet, for a time, the chipmunks perform in front of audiences with Dave. Then it is Ian Hawke's turn.

This movie is about much more than chipmunk antics and performances. It is a testimony to the human condition. David Seville, though often annoyed by the chipmunks' disruption of his house and of his life, nevertheless cares about them. After one of the chipmunks has a nightmare, Dave comforts him. Not so with Ian Hawke, who scoffs at another case of a chipmunk with a nightmare and dismisses him from his bedroom. In fact, Hawke can think of only one thing--MONEY. He dreams up extensive and creative ways of getting rich off the chipmunks' performances, and comes up with a grueling schedule for them. All along, he has no regard for their needs or wishes. When they get exhausted, he simply keeps them going with a coffee-bearing drink. When a veterinarian confirms the severity of the exhaustion, Ian forces them to perform anyway--albeit without singing while the music is playing.

Before long, the chipmunks long to return to Dave. The feelings are mutual. So Ian tells them lies about Dave no longer wanting to have anything to with them, and of calling them rats. Ian tells Dave, over the phone, that the chipmunks have moved on and love it with him. Just to make sure, Ian posts guards to prevent Dave from ever coming to see them. Will they ever get free of the exploitative Ian and see their beloved Dave again?",1198972800,9,2471,4.658256880733945
3059276,4,B00113O7MM,"An interesting cross-section of people attended the film at the same time my husband and I did.  There was a group of college kids, parents with children, and Tony and I, who were going to see how faithfully a contemporary film translated a childhood cartoon hero.

From the laughter, booing, and general merriment, I can tell you we were all having an excellent time. This definitely was not a performance that someone who likes to view films in quiet would have enjoyed.

The story:  David Seville (Jason Lee) is an advertising exec with dreams of becoming a songwriter.  He's got an 'in' with old college chum, Ian (David Cross), who is an exec with Jett Records, but still can't produce anything that anyone would want to sing.

It looks like David's never going to be able to quit his day job until three chipmunks get their pine tree home chopped down and taken to the lobby of Jett Records office building. They stowaway in a basket of muffins David's swiped from Jett in a fit of pique.

A few hours later, David discovers he's got an infestation of talking chipmunks--and the rest is pretty inevitable.  He writes a song, they perform it, and become a true overnight success.

I won't spoil the rest of the story for you.  This is a lighthearted film that you can take your young kids to without much problem.

Those of you who grew up with the Chipmunks will be pleased with the treatment. The group sings some of the oldies, but they also strut their stuff on newer music as well.",1198195200,35,1491,4.546816479400749
3059277,4,B00113O7MM,"I have to say that this movie was very enjoyable for me, partially because I am a kid at heart but also because I am a long time fan of Alvin and the Chipmunks, first being exposed to them by the cartoon, of which I saw many episodes.  While your brain may not be overly stimulated by this movie, that may not be a reason to avoid it.  It is really a lot of fun, and the chipmunks are so cute.  It does seem geared for children primarily, but if you like anything about Alvin and the Chipmunks you should see it.  Four stars.",1197849600,,525,4.019230769230769
3059278,3,B00113O7MM,"""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" is a cute film, but it's also the cinematic equivalent of empty calories--light, airy, and sweet, with nothing of value except for maybe a few moments of enjoyment. After it's over, the experience is forgotten, and we're no better or worse than before we saw it. There really isn't much that can be analyzed, deconstructed, or even explained; this is one of those films that puts absolutely everything on the table, able to capture the attention of even the most inattentive five-year-old. I'm not saying that this is a bad movie, but I'd be lying if I said that I'm the right person to have seen it. This is for kids and kids alone, a bright, energetic, simple film unfettered of complexity and meaning.

Now that I've gotten all my adult-level jargon out of the way, let me summarize the plot for you. Dave Seville (Jason Lee) is a struggling songwriter, unable to impress anyone with his music, least of all Ian (David Cross), the executive of a record company. When he steals a basket of muffins out of spite, he discovers three small, furry, squeaky-voiced chipmunk stowaways: the troublemaking Alvin (voiced by Justin Long), the brainy Simon (voiced by Matthew Gray Gubler), and the meek overeater Theodore (voiced by Jesse McCartney). Dave soon discovers that the three are natural born singers, and thus negotiates an arrangement: they can stay in his home so long as they sing the songs he writes. The film begins at Christmastime, so naturally, Dave's first song with the chipmunks is ""The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late)."" You know--the one where Alvin wants a Hula Hoop.

This song soon brings Ian back into the game, and he immediately shows his true colors by tempting them away from Dave. He lavishes them with expensive gifts. He tells lies about how Dave feels about them. But most importantly, he turns them into full-blown music superstars, allowing them to live a carefree lifestyle of food, toys, and video games. These things sound juvenile, but as Simon explains, he, Alvin, and Theodore are only kids; their parents left them a week after their birth, which is supposedly the way it's done with chipmunks. Of course, if you actually care one way or another about where they came from, how old they are, or even why they're able to talk and sing, then this is definitely not the movie for you.

But I digress. As the chipmunks are lured deeper and deeper into the crazy world of pop music celebrity, Dave realizes that he misses them, despite the fact that they drove him crazy. They in turn feel the strain of constant performing, and even though they believe that Dave doesn't want them back, they still would like to go home. Ian, of course, finds this unacceptable; he sees the chipmunks as nothing but cute moneymakers, an excuse to manufacture and distribute a boatload of rodent-related merchandise. He repeatedly says that he never loses, and isn't that exactly what you'd expect the villain of a kid's movie to say? Anyway, in realizing that the chipmunks are about to launch a twelve-month world tour, Dave vows to save them, not only from Ian, but from fame, as well. Helping him is a press photographer named Claire (Cameron Richardson), and as you might have guessed, she and Dave have feelings for each other.

That's about as much of the plot as there is to summarize. If this doesn't fit the bill as pure child-friendly escapism, then I must have missed something along the way. Short of the direct to video Barbie films, ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" is about as fluffy and generally unimportant as they get. It's filled to the brim with sight gags, such as the chipmunks trashing Dave's house, ridiculous character quirks, and a scene in which Simon puts Theodore's accident into his mouth, convincing Dave that a raisin had somehow landed on the couch. There's also moment when Alvin inhales helium from a balloon; apparently, helium makes an already high-pitched voice sound deeper. Pretty much the only things saving this film from being too sickly sweet are the numerous pop culture references--songs such as ""Funkytown,"" ""Don't Cha,"" and ""Only You"" find their way into the film, as do a number of present day slang terms like, ""My bad."" Even chipmunks have to keep up with the times.

Or do they? This film adaptation of ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" definitely accomplishes what it set out to accomplish, but honestly, did it really have to be made? I know that kids will like this film, if for no other reason than the joy of seeing cute CG rodents on the big screen. I don't debate the fact that this is a good-looking film, and to some extent, it is fun--or rather, about as fun as simple films can be. But that doesn't mean that it was necessary, and I have no doubt that adults will feel the exact same way. I don't know what original ""Chipmunks"" creator Ross Bagdasarian would have to say about this film, but I suppose it doesn't really matter. At the very least, he would have been glad to hear Dave's trademark shout: ""Allllllviiiiiin!""",1197590400,12,5018,4.75

3059681,2,B00113O7MM,"**1/2

""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" is the 2007 movie version of the old cartoon series from the 1950s and 1960s, featuring a trio of squeaky-voiced, harmonizing rodents - Simon, Theodore and the irascible Alvin - and their songwriting partner Dave Seville.  In the movie version, only the chipmunks are animated, while the humans exist and operate in the real world - if by ""real world,"" one means a place where perfectly rational human beings barely bat an eye when confronted with anthropomorphic woodland creatures that sing and dance and make a generalized nuisance of themselves.

Little kids may find this film amusing and entertaining - and obviously that's its intended demographic - but for the adults in the audience, it turns out to be a pretty grueling affair overall.  I actually like the Chipmunks in small doses, but stretched out to a full-length feature - especially one as utilitarian, unimaginative and uncreative as this one is - it doesn't take long before they wear out their welcome.  Jason Lee is certainly good-natured and game, playing the human counterpart to the vocalizing chippies, and Justin Long,  Matthew Gray Gubler and Jesse McCartney do a nice job reproducing the chipmunk voices, but the workmanlike screenplay and dull characters eventually take their toll.",1319673600,,1293,5.133333333333334

Who would have thought it, but Dave's surprise house guests turn out to be the perfect accompaniment to his music writing, which has been pathetic and going nowhere. Life gets a little crazy when the singing trio achieve star status and face some of the challenges that go with it. Dave and the chipmunks bond and have ups and downs like a real family. The movie has a little romance in it too. David Cross (the voice of Remi in Ratatouille) is perfect as the jerk you love to despise.",1313020800,,778,4.335616438356165

3059695,3,B00113O7MM,"It should come as no surprise that an adult who dragged her best friend to see Ratatouille would add Alvin and the Chipmunks to her must see list.  Naturally my opinion would be biased based on my passion for cute, little, animated rodents whose furry appeal outweighs any fault of a movie script, still after reading some negative comments, I must post a review of my own.

While some critics attributed the young adult appeal to the 1980's cartoon version of the Chipmunks, they are overlooking the fact that the Chipmunks date back to the baby boomers, and their legendary fame rides on their yearly revived Christmas classic.  They are also undermining the effect of an identifying hit song and the fact that a high pitched tune, supposedly sung by animals is enough to bring adults back to the point where they once believed.  And since I haven't seen such comingling of humans and animation since Roger Rabbit, I'm inclined to think Simon, Theodore, and Alvin are real.

The film starts with these lovable critters fending for themselves in the forest until they get swept away with their Christmas tree that gets hauled into the office of Jett Records where Dave Seville is trying to sell his latest song.  No longer of interest to the company's top executive ""Uncle"" Ian, a discouraged Seville takes off after reclaiming a basket of muffins, where the chipmunks sought refuge after abandoning their tree.  Dave unknowingly takes them home, and the rest is history.

Naturally their rise to fame is not all fun and games because otherwise there wouldn't be a plot, which is at best predictable, and at worse, lame.  The unscrupulous Uncle Ian could have ended up penniless, since he would have been dragged into court by the record industry, animal rights activists, and the family court system, had this been a - do I dare say it - real story.  Likewise, Seville's love life could have been more developed, and the film could have offered some explanation as to why these chipmunks were blessed with the gift of voice.  But who would go to see a movie titled Alvin and the Chipmunks for the plot???

For one adult who was taken in by the main attraction, this movie made me a believer.  I actually thought the beginning of the movie was semi-biographical of Dave Seville's life.  Could he have been a songwriter who was told that no human would record his songs?  Could it have been rejection that inspired him to create the chipmunks?

The answer to both questions is ""No.""  Dave Seville, like Santa, is fictional, as it is a stage name for the Chipmunk's true creator Ross Bagasarian, for whom the movie was rightfully dedicated.  But it's the name ""Seville"" that comes to life with every shout of ""Alvin!""  And if we can accept that some reindeer fly, then why can't some chipmunks sing?",1285632000,,2798,4.731958762886598

3059699,4,B00113O7MM,"In my days as a child, I remember having Alvin and the Chipmunks on vinyl. For the younger generation that means a record.  I can see me now dancing and signing away. I loved every minute of it. My memories of them is what lead me to purchase this DVD in the beginning. Now I can share the same fun experience with our children. Yes, they to get up and dance to the Chipmunk beat.
I love the modern makeover from the classic Alvin to the hip character he has become. All three of the chipmunks were well cast in voices. The animation fit in perfectly with the surrounds of the film. All in all I will say I found it to be well written and fun to watch for all age groups.

Maybe it's not for a 4 year old (or younger) but honestly, I won't be letting them watch it when they are 5 or 6 even.

I recommend watching the DVD extras at the end. The history of Alvin and the Chipmunks was very interesting on how they were created. For example, in the movie Dave Seville's address is 1958 - well, thats the year that the Chipmunks were created.

3059711,2,B00113O7MM,"Dave Seville (Jason Lee - who stars in TV Sitcom My Name is Earl) plays the lead in a weak script that focuses on three rascal chipmunks.  The plot is so-so;  a hapless songwriter that has the good luck of running into singing chipmunks.  They are amazing and have great harmony.  However, as Dave realizes they are high maintenance, and cause much trouble. They like Dave very much, but he throws them out of the house.  Of course, an evil record executive sees a chance to make big money over the singing sensation.  The chipmunks become international stars, but are exhausted from the hectic schedule.  As all good stories go, they are reunited with Dave.  Young children should find this movie a laugh riot as the chipmunks mess up the house making toaster waffles, their favorite food.

The computer animated chipmunks are full of cute personality.  Older movie viewers may not find the story that engaging and the updated song styles are disappointing.  However, throughout the chipmunks are cute, precocious and funny",1258070400,,1024,4.895348837209302

3059719,4,B00113O7MM,"The biggest fad in movie making now along with the comic book films is 1980's cartoon shows. With so much success from Transformers and TMNT and with GI Joe on the way we almost forget about the light hearted fun cartoons. Alvin & The Chipmunks have been aroud before the 1980s, but the cartoon was a classic and I loved it to death. So, of course I am going to see the movie.

There was a lot of pesimistic thoughts towards it and the movie was not the best plot wise. Still a movie doesn't have to be perfect to be enjoyed by many. This movie was so adorable and fun to watch. The cartoon definitely had a huge basis around the character development and the songs played on the history of their singing career.

Say what you will, but this movie was fun. If you look hard enough there are even some lessons to be told about youth in the music industry. These past few years have showed us the hardships of some young talents and how they can be troubled by fame and the media spotlight. It's a movie that can be enjoyed by any age and now that I found out that the Chipettes will be playing a major role in the 'Squeakuel' I am ready to throw down another ten bucks and be there front row center.

All 3 have Sassy additudes,  Don't seem to mind giving Dave grief and trouble, are self centered and don't have that looking out for each other bond that made them endearing on TV.

That Night in His Home, Sad and Alone, He Meets The 3 Singing Chipmunks Alvin, Simon, and Theodore. After The Chipmunks Get Famous With Thier First Hit Song, ''The Chipkmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late)'', Jett Records Producer Ian Takes Invatege of The Chipmunk Trio and Takes Them Away By Telling a Lie Saying That Dave Dosn't Care One Bit About Them. The Chipmunks (Unfortunatly) Fall For It and Decide To Stay With Ian. Now It's Up To Dave To Get The Chipmunks Back Before It's Too Late.

I Was Surprised By How Eaisly Great and Fun The Film Was. It's A Kids Movie For Kids, But If Your an Adult Who's Grown Up With The Chipmunks I Recommend You Watch With Your Kids. I Would've Given The Film 5 Stars, But The reason I'm Giving It One Star Less Than I Expected To Give It, Was Mainly The Acting Choice of Jason Lee as Dave Seville. Jason Lee Dosn't Make a Very Realistic Dave Seville, He Just Seems Like About Every Carecter He's Played Just More Dramatic, But Most of The Time, It Dosn't Work. Maybe if Thay Got Ross Bagdasarian, Jr. To Play The Live-Action Dave Seville, I Think It Would Be More Dramatic and Comidical Than The Way Jason Lee Did It. The Actors Who Were Cosen To Play The Chipmunk Trio Were Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler, and Jesse McCartney, These 3 Do A Fantastic Job Voicing Them and Thay Make These 3 Singing Chipmunks Beliveable and Fun. The Visuals for The Singing Trio Very Belivable as Well.

SPECIAL FEATURES INCLUDE
-Chip-Chip Hooray A Chipmunk History
-Hitting The Harmony The Chipmunks Music
-Sneak Peek at Horton Hears A Who

The ''Chip-Chip Hooray'' Feature is The Best Feature on The DVD. I Always Wanted To Know How The Chipmunks Got Started and I Was Glad To Finally Known How. The ''Hitting The Harmony'' Feature is A Very Bad Behind-The-Music Feature. The ''Horton Hears A Who'' Sneak Peek Clip is One of The Best Parts in The Film.

Maybe it was the company or the season, but I really enjoyed it.

One of my favorite scenes is Dave decorating the tree with the Chipmunks helping out by passing ""ornaments"" from inside the basket.

3059742,5,B00113O7MM,"The latest incarnation of the late David Seville's fuzzy musical rodents is a definite winner.
  We are first introduced to the brothers, Simon (the smart one), Alvin (the ""awesomest""), and Theodore, (the sweet sensitive one) in their natural habitat, a mountainous area with pine trees as they struggle to store nuts while singing the cutest version of ""You Had a Bad Day"", harmonizing perfectly.
 Strangely, the humans about to cut down their tree don't notice their singing. But their adventure begins when their habitat is hauled away by truck with them inside, and their tree is decorated for display in the lobby of a recording studio where they have their first encounter  with Dave Seville (Jason Lee), an amature songwriter whose latest idea has just been rejected by college mate, Ian (David Cross) the head and CEO of Jett Records.
 Leaving behind their  tree, Alvin, Simon, and Theodore ( voiced by Justin Long, Matthew Gray Guber, and Jesse McCartney) stowaway in the basket of muffins a dejected Dave stole from Ian's office.
 Once in Dave's home, the trio initially get off on the wrong foot. But once Dave realizes they can sing, he lets them stay, and is inspired to continue pursuing a career as a songwriter.
 Childish missteps and faux pas from the trio--especially Alvin-- test Dave's patience, and in the meantime, he works to rekindle a romance with his ex-girlfriend, Claire (Cameron Richards).
  Soon, Ian gets wind of the trio's vocal abilities, and they rocket to fame. Dave is a careful and frugal surrogate parent to the critters he slowly comes to view as his children. But Ian seduces them away from Dave, and they end up spoiled, overworked, and mistreated. The scene where Baby Theodore realizes that Ian lacks the true affection Dave showed for him and his brothers might result in a charge of animal  cruelty in real life, and there is a wistful moment where we watch the little critter wander away hurt and disillusioned.
 But when they see how much Dave cares for them, the ending is predictable, and life for the musical, mischeivous, one-liner-filled ""Fab furs"" ends literally on a happy note.
 There is a bit of unnecessary crassness in this production, but 50 years after his singing chipmunks first became a sensation, David Seville can rest assured that his legacy is in very good hands.",1229904000,,2330,4.89821882951654

It was hilarious watching Jason Lee make their little costumes for them and try to teach them right from wrong. The tree the chipmunks lived in was cut down and hauled into a big city and the little guys had to hid out in Jason's basket to get out of building. When they saw how he was struggling to produce something new in the song industry, they had to help out. He had to teach them about keeping the home clean.

The movie had some really wonderful animation.  The chipmunks moving around in a real environment, and interacting with the humans was believable, and goes to show just how far technology in movie production has become in the last 10 years or so.

The movie told a really good story, but there were a couple problems I had.  One of them is that, I thought Alvin was supposed to be the chipmunk that constantly gets into trouble?  Well, you didn't really feel that while watching the movie.  Theodore and Simon misbehaved just as often.

Also, while I was laughing at many of the jokes, I felt it could have been even funnier, especially since the guy from My Name is Earl played Dave.

Besides that, the movie delivered with adventure, excitement and everything else that makes a great family movie.

This would make a really good Christmas present.  No, it's not just a Christmas movie- you can watch it over and over many times throughout the year.",1226707200,,1166,4.526315789473684

3059752,4,B00113O7MM,"Years ago every Christmas season there would be a hit holiday song that would be played everywhere. One year it was Alvin and the Chipmunks. Hollywood loves to recycle pop culture because most of its moguls lack even a modicum of creativity or originality so the long-ago Christmas chipmunks (the three of them) are unleashed again in this mindless movie.
 It seems like it's for kids, but the path toward success in the music business seems like an adult theme to me. It's a mixing of adult ambitions and themes with some cute animal characters. I think kids will enjoy it because the chipmunks are always creating a mess and mayhem in the movie, defying adult authority. But it seems to me that a real kids' movie should deal more with fantasy and less with a quest for materialistic success.
 I couldn't understand the words of the chipmunks years ago when they were singing the Christmas song, and I couldn't understand much of what they said in this movie. Either they were really talking chipmunk or else a foreign language; whatever it is, to me they are incomprehensible. I don't think it matters because the dialogue is inane anyway. Turn on you English subtitles to find out what they are saying--if you really care.
 Giving animals human traits, humanizing them (anthropomorphism) is as old as storytelling. This appeals to kids because then the animals can seem like friends, toys, or pets.
 I saw this DVD in Blue Ray, and the colors were gaudy and flamboyant, wildly way too colorful and bright. It gave everything a fake look, but maybe it gave it a fairy tale appearance.
 I believe kids will enjoy the movie, and it's harmless fun.",1225670400,,1648,4.7282229965156795

3059763,2,B00113O7MM,"I burned out on Alvin and the Chipmunks somewhere back around 1958. This may seem hard to believe, but they had a number one hit song. I felt sick every time I heard it on the radio. I just haven't been able to listen to Chipmunk music or view them since that  time. I tell you this as a matter of disclosure so you may understand my review better.

My wife likes animated cartoons and we watch them now and then, too often as far as I'm concerned. A few weeks ago, she purchased an ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" DVD. Groan. Of course, we'd have to view it. Well, last night we viewed it. It was interesting in that the movie was filmed in a conventional fashion and then the animated chipmunks were added to the film as if they had been live at the scenes. It's a clever animation technique, without question. The animated Chipmunks therefore appeared to be interacting with the filmed characters. I suppose it must be difficult to get everything synchronized and in perfect order. The directors didn't. In a lot of places, the chipmunk characters were not in the focus of the actors and you could clearly see the actors were performing on their own. I could cite other glitches, but that would probably be considered too picky.

In any case, I suppose I noticed such things because I found the animation rather interesting, but didn't find the movie itself all that interesting. The human acting seemed stiff and unnatural and the actors interfaced with the animated characters only poorly. The story line was weak and uninteresting. Three singing Chipmunks get discovered and work their way to the top of the charts. Yawn. There weren't many substantial laughs unless you like slapstick. In short, the movie was a waste of viewing  time. However, the animated chipmunks themselves were rather well done, if not a little too cutsiepoo.

I'm really burned out on Chipmunk music, especially that Christmas thing. However, some of the new songs in up-to-date styles with dance routines were mildly amusing. That's about it, folks. View it at your own discretion, it's your dime. I can't comprehend how adults could watch this, but I think that small kids (under six) might find it enjoyable. Did I mention that I'm really burned out on Alvin and the Chipmunks?

3059764,5,B00113O7MM,"The lackluster cover design on the DVD case in no way reflects the movie. It's true they pay people to design these covers, but I nearly always think they'd be better with actual stills, especially in the case of animation. Forget that bad marketing decision, and slip in the disc. Immediately you're transformed back to the whimsical sense of the original ""The Chipmunk Song"" which took radio by storm so many decades ago, and for those lucky enough to remember it, to the great '60s cartoon, ""The Alvin Show"". At the end of the film, the credits even include some of the sleeves for the singles and albums, including Chipmunk Punk, the album that spurred the Chipmunk revival and their eventual return to TV.

This film is a lot better than I expected, and the interview with Ross Bagdasarian explains why. He and Janice had the sense to try and make a family movie that wasn't dumbed down and stupefying. ABC Family, whose motto ought to be ""No Kind of Family"" could take a lesson here. Alvin has style and verve without trying to be Adult Swim. Jason Lee is dead on as Dave Seville, although the cartoon Dave yelled ""Alllvin!"" more often.

The Chipmunk Song arrives in a suitably ramped up version, but one wonders why Dave Bagdasarian's other early radio hit, ""The Witchdoctor"" was recast in a hip hop/ disco/ pop mash that manages to be both overdone and a snooze at the same time (like much radio pop). In the interview Janice B. says that they wanted to keep updating the Chipmunks to keep them fresh. That led to the addition of the Chipettes in the recast TV show. That show proved a popular comeback, but later efforts smoothed off so many rough edges that the later 'toon chipmunks could pass as Care Bears. This film brings back the curious trio's animal instincts (they are Chipmunks) while echoing their individual traits as developed in the cartoons.

What's missing from the mix, of course, is the '60s TV show. There's a tantalizing glimpse of it in an included featurette on the History of Chipmunkmania. This merely shows how great the modern, simple art of the '60s was compared to the later cartoons, not unlike classic ""pie-eyed"" Mickey Mouse compared to ghastly later versions as Disco Mickey. Disney had the sense to bring back the modern, retro Mickey, and hopefully the '60s The Alvin Show will also find its way onto DVD. The shows made a brief return as segments of Wienerville on Nick, which dropped the little orange Nick logo into the opening titles.

Hopefully the Monks don't go Garfield, and start appearing in every style of CGI and animation possible, but rather release their extensive back catalog, and as with this film, remain true to Dave Seville AKA Bagdasarian's original vision.",1220313600,,2723,4.738396624472574

 athogh everyone (including me) was epecting this movie to just be a live-action virsion of the chipmunk cartons, the movie's diffarant moods gave it more exitment, Storys whare the charicors have to solve problems and sort out difficulies are always more exiting than those that are just the same way all the way throgh, and sad, scary,and tence scenes make happy endings even more special.
 My favorite part, thogh is the old clasic chipmunk song ""Christmas, don't be late"" any time they sing it, I sing along and dance to it! I also like when dave finnally relizes he really does love the chipmunks, and considers them family.
 The ending, when the chipmunks are finnally reunited wirh Dave, and home agin is so sweet-and funny!
 I think they should make a sequel to this movie with the Girl chipmunks(Chipetts)in it, more songs and the old favorite chipmunk song ""Christmas, don't be late"" and another exiting story with lots of moods.",1217980800,,1187,4.6923076923076925

I Told The Witch Doctor You Didn't Love Me Nice""

(""Witch Doctor"")

Three CGI chipmunks carry this movie on their narrow little shoulders, and that's a very good thing, seeing that the plot is nothing special and neither are the performances of the human actors.

Unceremoniously expelled from their tree home, the chipmunks are having a very bad day, until they show their stuff to Dave (Jason Lee), a songwriter who's told to quit his day job.

What happens next is basically what you'd expect when you let three forest critters occupy your living space, as well as the inevitable series of misunderstandings that occur in mixed species family groups.

David Cross plays Ian Hawke, the hammy heavy. He's a music producer who sees dollar signs with each helium-inspired note, and has great plans for the talented trio which may or may not include dopey Dave.

The music will send adults down memory lane, with new Chipmunky versions of ""Witch Doctor"", ""Funkytown"", ""Only You"", and ""The Chipmunk Song"", and younger viewers will recognize Daniel Powter's ""Bad Day"".  There are also some new funky songs and stylin' choreography.

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. CGI chipmunks sing and dance
2. Rest of movie is the same old song and dance

For children - rated 4 stars
For adults - rated 3 stars (one for each chipmunk)

Recommended as a stocking stuffer for children of all ages, and fans of the TV series.

Please Christmas, don't be late.""

In the beginning Dave is reluctant to them to being in his house  but eventually they grow on him and they become like family. i love every thing about this movie , from the sound of Dave's voice to the voice of the sweet, sweet cute talking chipmunks  and the music is awesome , i especially love that song

The music is ok. My wife was looking for the subtitles about two minutes into the film. At the start of the movie the chipmunks are really hard to understand, but it gets better.

3059798,5,B00113O7MM,"Alvin & The Chipmunks is one of those shows that you remember with fondness from your childhood and thanks to corporate money grabbing, the movie executives decided it was a good idea to take your childhood and update it. I was skeptical at first, I thought this would just be another one of those movies that takes a classic cartoon series like Garfield or The Flintstones and makes a feature length movie using either Live action, CGI or both. Because of this I kept away from this film as long as I could but after resisting temptation for so long, I had to give in and at least give it a try, needless to say I wasn't disappointed. For this review I will discuss both the pros and cons of this movie to give you a fair and honest view of the film to give you an informed decision.

Pro: Jason Lee: Most people will know him from the hit comedy series My Name Is Earl and with these people that will have been the only reason they will have given this film a chance. He's a great comic actor and someone that you just look at and smile because of his natural charisma and ease at which he plays the beaten, yet optimistic Dave Seville. He is a bit cringeworthy when doing the whole ALVIN!!!! thing as, although it's a part of the classic series, in todays setting it just doesn't fit. Either way though Jason Lee was one of the primary reasons why I enjoyed the film like I did

Con: The CGI: I know if you wanted to make a live action version of Alvin and the Chipmunks the use of CGI would be inevitable. The problem I have with it though, is that the CGI animations are quite sub-par and by todays standards should have been much better. At times with the CGI being a bit unrealistic it took a big element out of the film and in a way destroyed the fantasy element of the whole thing.

Pro: The Music: Obviously the whole premise of Alvin and the Chipmunks being that they're singing Chipmunks, the introduction of music would be inevitable. From the get go we're introduced to the classic high pitched yet melodic singing of the gang and the voices just make you think that the whole thing is adorable. Being voiced by Justin Long, Jesse McCartney & Matthew Gray Gubler the singing is an even bigger surprise as it does present a feel of genuine harmony between the three.

Great movie that I personally think everybody should have a watch of.",1214006400,,2350,4.358447488584475

In the cartoon, Alvin & Co. are taken in by Dave, who knows their mother, after she dies.  And another question is... where are the Chipettes?!  I'll forgive both of those issues because this movie is just too damn cute and I laughed a lot throughout it.  Esp when Simon says that Theodore's turd is a ""raisin"" and puts it in his mouth to prove it to Dave...  Sorry, I just have no problem with potty humor.

3059871,4,B00113O7MM,"I recall my two youngest falling in love with these smart-aleck fuzzballs when they were children, in the 60's. I had purchased an LP (remember those?) of ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" for them to listen to, and they practically wore it out! All these years later, comes this film, of the Fuzzy Rodentia that entertained them! I had never seen the cartoon, so the film is my introduction to them.

Kids would have a blast with this film! It's combination of Animation and live action was done well, and the Chipmunks received an updating, to appeal to our modern youngsters. I realize the difficulties when meshing live action, to animation, and I give credit to Jason Lee, for his part in this film.

I found a couple of situations in the film to be a bit over some children's heads, but nothing to take away from them enjoying this film. Some have found the ""updating"" of the Chipmunks' songs, misguided, or otherwise objectionable. I did not see this. The lyrics are the same, no?

I wonder if Ross Bagdasarian had given thought to the longevity his creation would ultimately achieve? I'm personally glad that he brought his mischievous carpet bumps to such vivid life! Alvin, Simon and Theodore. May they live on for future generations to come!

3059913,5,B00113O7MM,"Dave Seville is a struggling songwriter in need of some special inspiration. Just when he is at the end of his rope, his house is invaded by three stowaways from a muffin basket that are just what the witch doctor ordered! Alvin, Simon, and Theodore, the three chipmunk brothers who now live with Dave and perform his songs, are just kids out to have some fun, but they rapidly become the biggest new singing group in the country. It's all good until music mogul Ian Hawke woos the boys away from Dave and his unintentionally parental influence. Pushing them into the fast lane that is the rock star lifestyle, ""Uncle Ian"" exploits and overworks the Chipmunks while Dave worries and wonders on how to get them back.

When the ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" movie poster started appearing in theaters featuring the three famous 'munks in hip hop threads and CGI quasi-realistic form, most longtime fans cringed. There was a lot of bias against this movie long before it ever came out, and I'd say most of this was the result of an unnecessarily misleading poster and trailer making us expect the boys to be unrecognizably urbanized, a new, realistic look and size that is nothing like the most recent and popular vision of the Chipmunks from the 1980's animated TV series and follow-up movies (1 bigscreen and at least 2 direct-to-video), the general distaste held by at least half of animation fans for live-action/CGI interpretations of their beloved characters, and a distaste from much of the public for family films in general. I'd say the reason the film rates so many stars on Amazon.com is because reviewers here actually saw the film before dissing it. Sure, you'll still have some nay-sayers, folks who can't get past the none-too original family-film plot points like the exploitative record producer and the guy learning to be a parental figure, but if you focus on everything else you will find this to be an excellent film that is great fun and just better and better with repeat viewings!

So, what's so great about this movie? Well, to first address the realistic look/size of the Chipmunks in this film and the less passive Dave than the '80's/'90's version: Jason Lee, cleverly cast as David Seville, is more reminiscent of the original Dave based on Ross Bagdasarian, Sr. (Chipmunks creator and original voice of Dave and the boys) than his '80's counterpart. Let's not forget that the Chipmunks originated in 1958, not in the '80's when their now popular redesigns came about as a result of Bagdasarian, Jr. and wife Janice Karman bringing them back. Keeping that in mind, the Chipmunks were music stars before they were ever animated, and on their early album covers they appeared looking very much like real chipmunks. So, the film versions of both Dave and the Chipmunks themselves are quite appropriate for a first live-action movie. It was probably a wise choice to go to the source material for inspiration rather than trying to adapt the '80's show to live-action (though we'd still hope to see some influence from the '80's in any likely sequels, such as the Chipmunks attending school and encountering the Chipettes). Also a very happy thing about the film is that the characters are not as ""street"" as they appear in the promotional material. In fact, their personalities and voices (despite being voiced by big celebs for some reason) are spot on, just as we've always known them. Yes, the movie is pretty predictable. Dave meets the Chipmunks and together they form a band and a family, with a record producer thrown in as a villain to make it a real feature film. David Cross is hilarious as usual as the slimy record producer, by the way. But it's all about the very fun ride and seeing the Chipmunk origin story told in a grand, modern, live-action scale. There are some nice moments to make it a Christmas fave, the performances are fine (remember that these live-action actors had to play against thin air), the CGI is great, and there's a lot of terrific humor in it too. The driving force though, naturally, is the wonderful Chipmunk music, which sounds better than ever! Flawlessly updated, the songs keep the mood lively and fun throughout the film. In the opening scene, the mood is set beautifully by the Chipmunks doing their own amazing version of ""Bad Day"", and we are also treated to a dazzling bit of Chipmunk ""Funky Town"", not to mention updated versions of beloved classics ""The Chipmunk Song"" (Christmas Don't Be Late) and ""Witch Doctor""! And there are many other fantastic tunes too! Even after you've watched the film repeatedly, you'll find yourself running the DVD over and over again just for the musical numbers!

The DVD itself is rather weak in the extras department. It's a double-sided disc (widescreen on one side, fullscreen on the other, the widescreen looking great), and there is one very nice bonus featurette on each side. Side A has a great featurette about the history of the Chipmunks up to today, and side B has a nice behind the scenes look at creating music for the Chipmunks. Unfortunately, the only other extras are previews for other stuff (there's a scene from Horton Hears a Who and a promo for the Alvin and the Chipmunks soundtrack among them). I can't come down too hard on them for so few extras though, because the featurettes, especially the retrospective, are very nice and I love the film. Still, one expects the theatrical trailer nowadays and a commentary is always great. Or maybe a classic cartoon could have been included (as was included with Underdog's live-action movie DVD). However, I did get this movie in a promotional gift set with little plush toys of Alvin, Simon, and Theodore, so that was really cool. Anyway, I highly recommend this film for fans of the Chipmunks who don't mind that it goes back to its roots, especially if you just love their freaky sound. I also recommend the following live-action cartoons: Josie and the Pussycats (with the heavenly Rachael Leigh Cook), Garfield and Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties (which are flawed in the way some of the characters are portrayed, but Garfield and Odie are well done and they're cute movies), Scooby-Doo and Scooby-Doo 2 (ya love these movies or ya hate 'em, but ya gotta have a sense of humor), the Flintstones and Flintstones Viva Rock Vegas (Viva Rock Vegas is far superior, as they screwed up some of the casting in the original), Popeye (outstanding, underrated film!), Annie (fantastic musical), Dick Tracy (a work of art!), Underdog (nothing too special here, but if you like Jason Lee and live-action cartoons...), Inspector Gadget and Inspector Gadget 2 (I preferred the sequel), George of the Jungle and George of the Jungle 2 (never saw part 2), Dudley Do-Right (don't remember this one well enough to comment), the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles films (classics!), Transformers (great action spectacular!), and I could mention more, but that's a good enough start. Of course, if you love Alvin and the Chipmunks, you have to see ""The Chipmunk Adventure"", ""Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet the Wolf Man"", and ""A Chipmunk Christmas"", all their best work outside of this new live-action feature!",1208995200,2,7154,4.847914963205233

3059925,4,B00113O7MM,"Growing up, one of my earliest memories is of listening to an ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" album that spoofed the ""Urban Cowboy"" soundtrack.  I have no idea what happened to that album, but I do remember that it hooked me on Alvin and company for good.  I watched the cartoon series that came out in the 80's and even saw a few of the old cartoons.  When I saw that Alvin and the gang were headed for the big screen, I had two thoughts:  a) This will be the single worst live action remake ever or b) It just might be fun.  Luckily for me and my daughter, ""b"" was the correct thought.  When this film came out in theaters, I took my daughter to see it and both of us laughed throughout the film.  Jason Lee does an amazing job as kind-hearted Dave Seville, and the voices for the chipmunks, Justin Long (Alvin), Matthew Gray Gubler (Simon), and Jesse McCartney (Theodore), have their respective characters penned perfectly.

The story revolves around Dave finding the chipmunks in his home at Christmas time and then finding out that they can not only talk, but can sing a mean tune as well.  Desperate for money-making song, Dave takes the chipmunks to his record-producer friend, Ian (David Cross in one of his best roles yet), who doesn't believe Dave at first.  Once he discovers the truth, Ian promotes the chipmunks to death in order to drain every dollar he can out of them.  Eventually the chipmunks turn on Dave, and run to the lap of luxury that Ian promises them.  In the end, though, this turns out to be a film about the strength of the family, no matter how different it might be.

The DVD comes with both the full and widescreen versions of the film, as well as some decent special features.  The best of those features is an in-depth look at the creation and creator of the chipmunks, Ross Bagdasarian, Sr.

I thought very hard on giving this film five stars.  It's just that good of a family film.  Sure, there's a little crude humor but the tale is strong enough that most will be able to look beyond that.  In the end, I have to give ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" a very, very sold four stars.  I highly recommend it to anybody with children or anyone who wants to recall some wonderful old memories.",1208736000,6,2212,4.417283950617284
3059926,5,B00113O7MM,"I think Alvin and the Chipmunks was an excellent movie. It has a lot to offer if you watch it properly and not just laugh and forget the little funnies. I think kids will learn a lot from it. I as an adult have learnt a lot from it. The Chipmunks, especially Theodore is the youngest and the cutest one. He is expresses his emotions very freely like any kid should. He is loving and very innocent. He is cared for and looked after by his brothers which kids will find very adorable. I think it teaches a little thing or two about being siblings and looking out for each other.
While the three are different, they show us that they are all alright as they are.
The scene where they give Dave Christmas presents was extremely touching. It shows that it is not the size or the price of the xmas gifts that matter, it is the thought put into it- Theodore shows Dave a little picture and makes a xmas card for him while Simon makes for him a paperclip compass.
I think Jason lee was really excellent in the role as well.

3059928,4,B00113O7MM,"I never would have dreamed that someone would decide to adapt the trio of singing chipmunks known as Alvin and the Chipmunks into a feature film. Yet, here we are, 50 years after their initial debut, getting to see a live-action version of the cute furry guys in action on the big screen. When I first saw the advertisements for ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" my expectations were rather low, mostly because the chipmunks had been removed from the realm of pop culture since the early to mid nineties, and the fact that I haven't been overly impressed with some of the other animated cartoons that have made the jump to the big screen as of late, most recently the below average adaptation of ""Underdog"". So, I thought that any attempt to bring the chipmunks to the big screen would result in a mixed bag of good CGI effects to bring the chipmunks to life, updated and/or butchered versions of some of their classic songs that fans love, and an overall too cute and kid friendly storyline that would be so insipid for any adult to actually tolerate sitting through. However, after renting the movie for my kids to watch, and I of course sat down to watch it with them out of curiosity, I am surprised to say that I was actually impressed by how good this modern adaptation of the classic cartoon turned out to be.

""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" is the story of three talented singing chipmunks named Alvin, Simon, and Theodore, as they rise to stardom in the music business thanks to their songwriter/mentor Dave Seville (Jason Lee). As their popularity increases, a greedy record producer (David Cross) double-crosses Dave and causes Alvin and the gang to mistrust him, thus taking control of the burgeoning career of the chipmunks and pushes the three loveable brothers to their limits and will not stop until he has milked them for all they're worth. Now, it's up to Dave to find a way to win back the trust of his beloved chipmunks, and bring them back to the only place they want to be... home.

As far as cartoon adaptations into feature films go, ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" is definitely one of the better ones in my opinion. I've seen the two `Garfield' films, which were cute, and then the ""Underdog"" movie, which didn't amount to much in terms of entertainment value, and ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"", is by far much more of an entertaining movie than any of those other ones. Director Tim Hill has done a very good job of mixing the modern song styles of today with the classic sounds of some of the chipmunks' famous songs, and he does so without compromising the appeal of those beloved songs. Tim Hill has improved his ability to adapt classic cartoon characters into a feature film when compared to his previous effort, the second film in the `Garfield' series, ""Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties"" which was an average movie at best. This time around he has better tools at his disposal, such as; much more polished CGI characters with the chipmunks, somewhat better actors, and the film's story is much more fulfilling for children and adults thus creating a better overall movie experience for the whole family.

The CGI created chipmunks were very good for 99% of the movie, they weren't completely photo-realistic due to more exaggerated and cartoonish facial features and expressions, and of course the fact that they could talk and sing, and wear clothes, but they fit in nicely in this movie. As good as the CGI was throughout the movie, there was one scene that stuck out to me as being not quite as polished as the others. The scene I am referring to is where Alvin is taking a shower in Dave's dishwasher, even though it was an extremely cute and funny scene, the Alvin character model looked way too stiff and jerky in his movements, having an almost stop-motion feel to him. I don't know if this was brought on by the mixing of CGI water, a wet animated character, and steam together or what; but, the scene definitely stood out to me, and left me feeling as if the visual effects crew could have spent a little more time to perfect that scene and the movie's effects would have been essentially flawless.

The actors all did a good job and thankfully chose not to ham it up too much on screen. Given the type of movie they were in, I'm sure the temptation was there, but they resisted much to the movie's benefit. Jason Lee was a good choice for Dave Seville, the chipmunks' songwriter/mentor/father-figure, but I do have one complaint about his performance. I don't believe that Jason really sold the yelling of Alvin's name during the Christmas song, and other various times throughout the movie. Each time he yelled ""ALVIN!"", I felt it was too forced and unnatural, which is a problem for me because that line is such an integral part of Dave's character and is something that fans of the animated series and songs know all too well. To have that aspect of the character not work perfectly comes off as a weak point in the movie for me, but I digress. Actor and comedian, David Cross was perfectly sniveling and obnoxious as the slimy record producer that wants to cash in on the chipmunk brand, bringing his signature sarcasm and wit to the character, even throwing in a few one-liners that would be funnier to adults than kids. The voice cast for the chipmunks were comprised of some of Hollywood's up-and-coming acting talents, such as; Justin Long (Alvin), Jesse McCartney (Theodore), and Matthew Gray Gubler (Simon). The choice to include decently recognizable names to voice these characters would have been a wise decision had their voices not been modified; however, due to the fact that their voices were recorded at half-speed and sped up to normal speed to create the chipmunk sound, having recognizable actors providing the voices seemed rather pointless. I mean there was no distinguishable quality to identify that Alvin's voice was that of `The Mac Guy' in the PC and Mac commercials from TV, so I don't understand the logic behind that decision to go with somewhat recognizable actors over unknowns, but I'm not the one that makes these decisions so maybe to some Hollywood suit this choice made sense, you've got me though.

""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" is one of those rare live-action movies aimed primarily at kids that adults can enjoy as well. The movie actually manages to avoid the pitfall of oversimplifying everything in the story for kids; instead, opting to create a heartwarming and updated re-telling of a classic animated series that successfully introduces the characters of Alvin, Simon, and Theodore to a whole new generation to enjoy, and gives those that are familiar with them already a nice walk down memory lane.

""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" is rated PG for mildly rude humor.",1208563200,,6726,4.72

3059932,4,B00113O7MM,"(please read this review in a pompous, snobbish tone) Alvin and the Chipmunks is one of those great pieces of cinematic bliss that causes the viewer to take one of two paths. The first is to follow the storyline for what it appears to be and the other is to see the story for what it really is.

What we see is a man who adopts three young chipmunks and begins a record career with them. What we're supposed to see, however, is a man, perhaps mid to late thirties, and his frantic, feeble cry for help.

Exhibit A: ""Dave"", if that is his real name, is the quintessential metro- male, possessing a lavish garden full of fresh flowers, an immaculate house that doesn't so much as show a hint of dust throughout, and a wardrobe that would make even the fastest trigger-tongued females pause out of respect for his delicate taste and touch. And yet, poor Dave can't catch a break. He's creepily overbearing with the ladies (and on a side note, there is enough eye-candy in this film to keep most men delightfully happy) and his entire demeanor screams one deft-defying truth as we psycho-analyze poor and pathetic Davey: that he is celibate, has been so for a VERY long time, and in an effort to proscribe the immensity of his innate desires, creates three fictitious ""chipmunks"" as a form of psychotic catharis. They are to him the elements that drive the demons away at night as he rocks himself to sleep in the fetal position, the saviors who keep his mind occupied when his hot neighbor walks by in a bouncy-bounce blousey-blouse. They are figments of poor Dave's baseless soul.

So our lesson is clear, kids. Celibacy is a good thing for a while, but not forever. 'Alvin and the Chipmunks' offers cathartic proof in what celibacy will do to you if you hold onto it too long.

sincerely,

the pompous, smug reviewer",1208131200,12,1815,4.5552147239263805
3059933,4,B00113O7MM,"i just saw this movie and i have to say i am both impressed and a little disappointed in it.
the film starts off with the three chipmunks in the woods storing nuts for winter,when their tree is chopped down by loggers and then taken to the big city and thus enters the life of dave seville who is a struggling music writer trying to make that one song that someone will want to sing and thus is unable to make.
so, enter the three chipmunks into his life and things begin to change for them all drastically.the voices were great for the three chipmunks and the movie had it's funny moments to it as well as it's serious messeage of nothing is more important in life then understanding the meaning of being a family.
now for the down sides to this movie, jason lee from that craptacular nbc show called earl plays dave seville which in my opinion was a huge mistake.he makes the character too shallow,arrogent and stupid about everything having to do with both dave's life and lost relationship with his ex girlfriend who is also his across from him neighbor as well.
secondly,the chipmunks singing of songs in this movie could have been better as they are no good at singing hip hop or anything like that.in my opinion this part of the movie could have been done better.
all in all this movie was botrh great and funny and both a little disappointing and could have been done better.
but thats just my opinion,check it out and see what you think.

3059934,5,B00113O7MM,"Why this is a good movie!

  I personally like the Alvin and the chipmunk movie because of its sarcastic humor and its characters. Alvin is the hard headed leader of the group & can't really say anything without being a jerk about it. Theodore is the cute but stupid one and is the one who eats the most so he is a little clubbier than the two. Simon is the smarter of the two siblings and is the backup singer for the band. In the movie the chipmunks are tired of the forest life and end up in a Christmas tree till they meet Dave the song writer for a big record company that just fired him for a stupid song about death. The boss of the record company is Ian who thinks that he found the chipmunks and wants to take them on a world tour but takes it a little too far but you have to figure that out when you see the movie. Alvin and the chipmunks have been around for a long time and this new addition to the almost best cartoon ever has proven that Alvin can get this century.",1207612800,4,980,4.015384615384615
3059935,4,B00113O7MM,"I was very, very against seeing this movie.  As a huge fan of `The Chipmunks' in my youth I was certain; positive even, that this movie was going to destroy them.  I found though, after being forced by family to watch this movie, that instead of `destroying' them they actually brought them to a wider audience.  In fact, `Alvin and the Chipmunks' was fun, fresh, spunky and pretty much everything I remember about those cute fuzzy little rodents in the first place.  I was pleasantly surprised with how well thought out this movie actually was.

The story follows Dave Seville, a down and out songwriter who is just trying to catch a break.  That break comes in a much unexpected place.  Dave meets three cute little chipmunks who just so happen to be able to talk.  Not only can they talk but they can sing.  Striking a deal that if they sing his songs he'll let them live with him, Dave and the Chipmunks form a musical team.  That team is threatened though when a greedy music executive Ian Hawke attempts to drive a wedge between Dave and the boys for his own selfish gain.

The very concept of `Alvin and the Chipmunks' has been modernized to appeal to today's youth but it never loses the charm and appeal that it's always had.  That's what I respect so much about this adaptation.  I was so certain they were going to ruin what remains such a wonderful childhood memory of mine, but I'm so happy to say that that couldn't be further from the truth.  In fact, thanks to `Alvin and the Chipmunks' I now have a nice way of passing along this wonderful and wholesome children's story onto my own children.

The acting is decent, although the CGI-Chipmunks do steal the whole show.  Jason Lee has never really had a good track record with film; he's more suited for television (as `My Name is Earl' has proven) but he manages to deal well with this performance.  David Cross plays the same character no matter what film he's in, and he does a decent job at it so who am I to knock it.  Cameron Richardson doesn't have to do much but be pretty, and she is.  Jane Lynch is fantastic in her very short cameo performance.  She is always hilarious and she captures everything I love so much about her without really having much to do.  Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler and Jesse McCartney play Alvin, Simon and Theodore, although you never no it with all the voice distorting going on.  I can't really say anything for their voice-over work because quite frankly it's not really them performing is it?

`Alvin and the Chipmunks' also manages to teach the viewer some important lessons about the reality of family.  It proves that a family is so much more than a mother, father, sons and daughters but can really come in any shape or size.  A family is a group of people (or animals in this case) who love and care for one another and who look out for one another and have each others best interests at heart.

I think it's obvious where I stand with this one.  I was floored with my final reaction to the film.  I'll most definitely see it again, most likely I'll own it, for it's such a fun and entertaining film that I'm sure my daughter will grow to love it, and it's something the whole family can enjoy wholeheartedly as apposed to merely tolerate begrudgingly.",1207526400,,3264,4.477157360406092
3059936,5,B00113O7MM,"For many of us our childhood was filled with the memory of three little voices singing in beautiful high pitched harmony. Granted those voices were sped up singers whose altered versions were representing three loveable rodents, but to us it didn't matter. Alvin and the Chipmunks were as real as anything else on TV. Now, Alvin and his brothers Simon and Theodore receive an update and it's not half bad.

David Seville (Jason Lee of MY NAME IS EARL) is a down on his luck songwriter whose songs are too cutesy for ex-friend and mega mogul record producer Ian (David Cross). But all that changes when he inadvertently comes across three singing chipmunks that turn his song about Christmas wishes into what is a potential blockbuster. Once Ian hears the song and realizes the potential, he comes across big time with a set up that will make the boys stars.

Dave, while trying to set boundaries up letting the three know that they are working together and nothing more, begins to grow attached to the little guys. He may be strict on a few items but he has their best interests at heart. Not so Ian.

Ian sees nothing more than dollar signs when he hears them singing. He begins a campaign to lure them away and make them the latest pop sensations of the world. His lavishing of gifts and wooing of the boys via their egos results in Dave being left behind while Alvin and his brothers live a life of luxury and non stop toys.

But all of this comes with a price as the chipmunks are worked non-stop. New records, merchandise and a worldwide concert tour take their toll and they reach a point of exhaustion. Too bad Ian sees them only as rodents that are there to do nothing more than increase the size of his wallet.

It's up to Dave and his old girlfriend to save the day and rescue Alvin, Simon and Theodore. But will they be too late? Will the boys finally realize that Dave was right all along? And will Ian be able to stop any attempt at rescue that is made?

Okay face it, you know the outcome of a movie like this. It's not the answer to that question that makes you watch. It's more about the interplay between the characters, even if three of them are computer generated. You still find yourselves attracted to the cute little guys and want the best for them.

The movie features over the top performances by all cast members, but that should be expected in a movie aimed at the elementary school level audience. They'll be more interested in the three main characters anyway and touched by scenes such as Theodore climbing into bed to sleep with Dave after having a nightmare.

At least two classic Chipmunk songs are featured here, one sounding much like the original while the second gets an update. A few scattered gastro intestinal jokes are offered for the new generation, but on the whole this is a movie that the entire family can watch together. That alone makes this movie a fun watch for everyone.",1207440000,5,2920,4.517045454545454
3059937,5,B00113O7MM,"My wife and I just bought this movie and after watching it, it proves that the T.V. and newspaper critics are wrong. But then again, that's what happens when you rely on an opinion. The best way to judge a movie is if it peaks your interest, go see it. If we see a commerical for a movie and it slightly peaks our interest then we wait for it to be released on DVD.

The story follows 3 chipmunks, Alvin and his brothers; Theodore (the one with the baby fat) and Simon (the intelligent one with the glasses). Remember the popular cartoon Alvin and the Chipmunks? Anyway, after their tree is cut down by man, they cross paths with Dave Saville (Jason Lee from My Name is Earl and A Guy Thing), who is a struggling music writer. Dave thinks hes found his big break (he gets an idea to create a Christmas song that most of us had heard on the radio during Christmas time) and tries to convince Ian (David Cross from Men in Black 2 and Scary Movie 2) who is the chairman of Jett Records. They get cold feet. At times the little fury cuties get on Dave's nerves as he hasn't fully accepted them in his house. When Alvin and the Chipmunks go to Ian to try to fix their relationship with Dave, they inadvertnly cause themselves harm. Ian sees visions of money...in his pockets. He cooks up a scheme to lure the chipmunks (who are just kids) away from Dave so he can put them through a grueling European concert tour and a whole lot more. Enriching himself at the expense of the chipmunks. Will Ian succeed? Will Dave be able to save them?

This movie was very cute. The chipmunks while they are a product of CGI animation, they were so adorable. The movie does take place right before Christmas so it seems like a holiday movie. The movie does have its funny parts, drama, and heart warming charm. I will admit that I was like,"" Awwwwwwww"", when Theordore had a nightmare and asked Dave if he can sleep in his bed that night. Dave reluctantly said yes and told him to sleep on the other side of the bed, however Theordore cuddled up on Dave's forehead and wrapped himself in a little ball. So cute! While the animated cartoon Alvin and the Chipmunks wasn't at the top of my list when it was on ( I liked Scooby Doo, The Jetsons, He-man, The Gobots, Heathcliff, Tom and Jerry, The Real Ghostbusters, The Ghostbusters, Woody Woodpecker, Space Ghost, Transformers, and the Hurculoids; just to name a few ;-), this movie was indeed very cute with some spirts of comedy. I will admit that I did watch the cartoon when it was on before I had to go to school.

Hardly any foul language. Just one minor possible issue. Watch out for the part when the chipmunks are singing, Ian says,"" Make love to the music."" Awkward moment alert! This is the only part that might make parents squirm but the scene moves very quickly so it will be unnoticed. I just happened to hear it, most times I'm oblivious, lol until I've watched a movie several times.

The movie has both fullscreen and Widescreen versions on one disc. Side A has fullscreen and side B is widescreen. The movie looked great on a LCD TV and playing it on a 1080p upconverting DVD (recordable) player showed an even beautiful picture. Some minor additions to the DVD include an extra about Alvin and the Chipmunks and a sampling of their music. Alvin and the Chipmunks is a great family addition to your DVD collection as well as anyone elses. Enjoy it!",1207353600,5,3394,4.40829346092504

In the 80's, I was a hardcore Alvin & The Chipmunks fan, I admit. I watched the cartoon show religiously every Saturday Morning. Sadly, Christmastime rolled around but I never was able to go see it. Not that I didn't want to, I did. Time wouldn't allow me to. Now, it's out on DVD and I finally made time to purchase and see this movie. I'm really glad I did. It's an endearing movie about a songwriter named Dave Seville who meets the 'munks when they're raiding his kitchen for food. Quickly, he boots them out. Yet, when he finds out that they can carry a tune, he quickly welcomes them back in & totes them off to a record executive who soon takes them away from Dave & exploits their talent for all it is worth. Dave spends the rest of the movie trying to save the boys from a showbusiness life they are too young for. Like everyone else, I would have loved the movie alot better if it would have shown alot more of the chipmunks...you know, like the cartoon does. It's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be, though. Course, Garfield's first movie didn't show him all that much either and it was just as awesome. When they make a 'munks sequel(and I'm sure they will), we'll probably see more of them.

Alvin and his companions Simon and Theodore learn these lessons from their surrogate father Dave and from the hard knocks they endure as they leave Dave and rise to recording stardom. Seldom have I seen such an entertaining film spell out such excellent values for young children. In terms of pure fun, the chipmunks are believable and so precious they can make you cry. Jason Lee is outstanding as the caring ""dad"", Dave. The music is wonderful: great remixes of ""Witch Doctor"" and the Chipmunks Christmas song. Don't listen to the critics on this one.

I have to say there was some fallout...I had to listen to Alvin and the Chipmunks sing Christmas songs until I was desperate for the next holiday!(Which didn't take long!) Enjoy this movie & have fun, which won't be too hard to do:)",1207008000,3,602,4.2894736842105265

3059946,5,B00113O7MM,"I really loved this movie.  It's not only geared for kids, but everyone can find this enjoyable.  The chipmunks are adorable and it's clever, cute and very entertaining.
Jason Lee plays Dave Seville who is a struggling songwriter.  When he finds the chipmunks in his kitchen (their tree got cut down to make a Christmas tree and they ended up in the city), he throws them out only to hear them singing later and begins to think that they could bring him success.  He lets them stay with him if they sing his songs.  There is Alvin who is voiced really well by Justin Long and the mischievous leader of the trio; brainy Simon and cute and chubby Theodore (I love the scene with them having a shower in Dave's dishwasher).  But Daves friend Ian wants to break up this happy group to exploit the chipmunks.
It's such a cute movie that is funny and so entertaining and even though it's not the kind of movie to watch over and over again, it's certainly worth buying to look at everynow and then.  I still crack up everytime I hear them singing in their cute little voices and watching them getting up to no good is always hillarious.

Sountrack is great, story is great, animation is great. I's say the lowest point, if tehre is such a thing in this film, are the human actors, overacting a little at times.

3059956,5,B00113O7MM,"My family - myself, my daughter, my parents, and my sister - watched the Chipmunks just before Christmas as part of a family outing. Ranging in age from 6 to 52, each of us laughed out loud - regularly - throughout the film (along with everyone else in the theater). I knew we had a winner when, as we exited the theater, I asked my daughter what she thought of the movie, and she simply replied, ""I want it."" She has never specifically asked me to buy ANY movie watched in the theater. And I admit, I want this movie too!

It was such a refreshing change from the animated movies released over the past couple of years. With those movies, we watched the previews and headed to the theater with great anticipation just to leave the theater disappointed because every one of the funniest moments was covered in the previews and honestly was funnier in the previews. With this movie however the trailers undoubtedly had us laughing; we played them over and over (we particularly enjoyed the dishwasher/shower scene). But during the movie, we not only laughed at all those same moments, but more importantly we laughed at many, many others.

I recommend this movie for everyone - kids and adults. I don't know how anyone could leave the theater without a smile and without at least one or two chuckles on the drive home. I'm looking forward to watching it again (and again), not only because it was laugh-out-loud funny and 100% enjoyable, but also because I want to see all the parts I laughed over - and thus missed - the first time around.",1203811200,4,1539,4.552346570397112
3059957,5,B00113O7MM,"I took both my three year old and my six year old to this movie, and they sat through the whole thing! They were mesmerized by the silly humor. For instance, in one scene Alvin pretends to eat Theodore's poop so Dave thinks it's a raisin and doesn't get mad.

The story starts with Dave, an unsuccessful song writer, who accidentally takes the chipmunks home. This is where all the fun starts. He wants them out, then finds out they can sing!  He says they can stay if they sing his music. The chipmunks grew up in a forrest with no parents, so they have NO manners. There are loads of funny scenes as they destroy his house and his social life. He is determined not to be their ""dad"", they're just friends.

Enter evil uncle Ian. He is Dave and the chipmunks manager, who of course, told Dave his music stunk before the chipmunks entered the scene. On Christmas, Dave had given the boys savings bonds, which granted, is a lame gift. But he meant well, and he was thinking about their future. Uncle Ian comes in with lots of toys, setting the scene for Dave is the serious one, and uncle Ian is the fun one.

Dave of course gets soft to the boys, and his desire that they have a normal childhood becomes apparent, whereas Ian just wants to make money. Ian eventually exploits the situation and the boys come to live with him. This is where the real drama comes in. You have to see the movie to find this part out. But don't worry, it has a happy ending with a nostalgic ""ALVIN!!!""

The music is absolutely great. There are songs I remember from growing up in the sixties, and then there are new ones that are more in keeping with today's music.

I pre-ordered this DVD as soon as I found out it was available, and my boys and I can't wait to get it!",1203379200,16,1749,4.268882175226586

I am not a fan of MY NAME IS EARL so I was skeptical about the ""human star"" too.  But we went, and along with the 200 or so kids, we had a fantastic time.  We both LOVED this movie.

I mean it's pretty funny that instead of sounding like a chipmunk when he sucks helium out of a balloon Alvin has a deep voice.

  I don't get it how Roger Ebert could recommend both Garfield movies but only give this **. Sure the end is anti-climatic but other than that it's pretty cute and harmless. Well harmless despite the one scene where Simon eats Theodore's poop making believe it's food so he won't get in trouble from Dave.

3293772,5,B00113O7MM,"The lovely chipmunks, Simon, Theodore, and Alvin, enter Dave Seville's home and turn it and his life upside down. They turn it into a giant playground. They tear apart the food packages in his cabinets, and flood his home. Before long, his home is a disaster area. But he works out a deal with them to stay with him. They clean the place up.

His girlfriend, with whom he has had an off-and-on relationship, is puzzled by what turns out to be his chipmunk-hiding behavior and his crazy remarks about talking chipmunks. Not exactly an auspicious way to re-win her heart!

Imagine having an important poster presentation at work, only to find out, during the actual presentation, that the chipmunks had drawn crayon figures all over it? What a way for Dave to lose his job!

It takes some time for Dave to persuade others that the chipmunks can sing. Owing to stage fright, they fail to perform in front of Ian Hawke, his associate. But eventually they do, and Hawke thinks up of ways to use the chipmunks in accordance with his selfish desires. Yet, for a time, the chipmunks perform in front of audiences with Dave. Then it is Ian Hawke's turn.

This movie is about much more than chipmunk antics and performances. It is a testimony to the human condition. David Seville, though often annoyed by the chipmunks' disruption of his house and of his life, nevertheless cares about them. After one of the chipmunks has a nightmare, Dave comforts him. Not so with Ian Hawke, who scoffs at another case of a chipmunk with a nightmare and dismisses him from his bedroom. In fact, Hawke can think of only one thing--MONEY. He dreams up extensive and creative ways of getting rich off the chipmunks' performances, and comes up with a grueling schedule for them. All along, he has no regard for their needs or wishes. When they get exhausted, he simply keeps them going with a coffee-bearing drink. When a veterinarian confirms the severity of the exhaustion, Ian forces them to perform anyway--albeit without singing while the music is playing.

Before long, the chipmunks long to return to Dave. The feelings are mutual. So Ian tells them lies about Dave no longer wanting to have anything to with them, and of calling them rats. Ian tells Dave, over the phone, that the chipmunks have moved on and love it with him. Just to make sure, Ian posts guards to prevent Dave from ever coming to see them. Will they ever get free of the exploitative Ian and see their beloved Dave again?",1198972800,9,2471,4.658256880733945
3293773,4,B00113O7MM,"An interesting cross-section of people attended the film at the same time my husband and I did.  There was a group of college kids, parents with children, and Tony and I, who were going to see how faithfully a contemporary film translated a childhood cartoon hero.

From the laughter, booing, and general merriment, I can tell you we were all having an excellent time. This definitely was not a performance that someone who likes to view films in quiet would have enjoyed.

The story:  David Seville (Jason Lee) is an advertising exec with dreams of becoming a songwriter.  He's got an 'in' with old college chum, Ian (David Cross), who is an exec with Jett Records, but still can't produce anything that anyone would want to sing.

It looks like David's never going to be able to quit his day job until three chipmunks get their pine tree home chopped down and taken to the lobby of Jett Records office building. They stowaway in a basket of muffins David's swiped from Jett in a fit of pique.

A few hours later, David discovers he's got an infestation of talking chipmunks--and the rest is pretty inevitable.  He writes a song, they perform it, and become a true overnight success.

I won't spoil the rest of the story for you.  This is a lighthearted film that you can take your young kids to without much problem.

Those of you who grew up with the Chipmunks will be pleased with the treatment. The group sings some of the oldies, but they also strut their stuff on newer music as well.",1198195200,35,1491,4.546816479400749

While your brain may not be overly stimulated by this movie, that may not be a reason to avoid it.  It is really a lot of fun, and the chipmunks are so cute.  It does seem geared for children primarily, but if you like anything about Alvin and the Chipmunks you should see it.  Four stars.",1197849600,,525,4.019230769230769
3293775,3,B00113O7MM,"""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" is a cute film, but it's also the cinematic equivalent of empty calories--light, airy, and sweet, with nothing of value except for maybe a few moments of enjoyment. After it's over, the experience is forgotten, and we're no better or worse than before we saw it. There really isn't much that can be analyzed, deconstructed, or even explained; this is one of those films that puts absolutely everything on the table, able to capture the attention of even the most inattentive five-year-old. I'm not saying that this is a bad movie, but I'd be lying if I said that I'm the right person to have seen it. This is for kids and kids alone, a bright, energetic, simple film unfettered of complexity and meaning.

Now that I've gotten all my adult-level jargon out of the way, let me summarize the plot for you. Dave Seville (Jason Lee) is a struggling songwriter, unable to impress anyone with his music, least of all Ian (David Cross), the executive of a record company. When he steals a basket of muffins out of spite, he discovers three small, furry, squeaky-voiced chipmunk stowaways: the troublemaking Alvin (voiced by Justin Long), the brainy Simon (voiced by Matthew Gray Gubler), and the meek overeater Theodore (voiced by Jesse McCartney). Dave soon discovers that the three are natural born singers, and thus negotiates an arrangement: they can stay in his home so long as they sing the songs he writes. The film begins at Christmastime, so naturally, Dave's first song with the chipmunks is ""The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late)."" You know--the one where Alvin wants a Hula Hoop.

This song soon brings Ian back into the game, and he immediately shows his true colors by tempting them away from Dave. He lavishes them with expensive gifts. He tells lies about how Dave feels about them. But most importantly, he turns them into full-blown music superstars, allowing them to live a carefree lifestyle of food, toys, and video games. These things sound juvenile, but as Simon explains, he, Alvin, and Theodore are only kids; their parents left them a week after their birth, which is supposedly the way it's done with chipmunks. Of course, if you actually care one way or another about where they came from, how old they are, or even why they're able to talk and sing, then this is definitely not the movie for you.

But I digress. As the chipmunks are lured deeper and deeper into the crazy world of pop music celebrity, Dave realizes that he misses them, despite the fact that they drove him crazy. They in turn feel the strain of constant performing, and even though they believe that Dave doesn't want them back, they still would like to go home. Ian, of course, finds this unacceptable; he sees the chipmunks as nothing but cute moneymakers, an excuse to manufacture and distribute a boatload of rodent-related merchandise. He repeatedly says that he never loses, and isn't that exactly what you'd expect the villain of a kid's movie to say? Anyway, in realizing that the chipmunks are about to launch a twelve-month world tour, Dave vows to save them, not only from Ian, but from fame, as well. Helping him is a press photographer named Claire (Cameron Richardson), and as you might have guessed, she and Dave have feelings for each other.

That's about as much of the plot as there is to summarize. If this doesn't fit the bill as pure child-friendly escapism, then I must have missed something along the way. Short of the direct to video Barbie films, ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" is about as fluffy and generally unimportant as they get. It's filled to the brim with sight gags, such as the chipmunks trashing Dave's house, ridiculous character quirks, and a scene in which Simon puts Theodore's accident into his mouth, convincing Dave that a raisin had somehow landed on the couch. There's also moment when Alvin inhales helium from a balloon; apparently, helium makes an already high-pitched voice sound deeper. Pretty much the only things saving this film from being too sickly sweet are the numerous pop culture references--songs such as ""Funkytown,"" ""Don't Cha,"" and ""Only You"" find their way into the film, as do a number of present day slang terms like, ""My bad."" Even chipmunks have to keep up with the times.

Or do they? This film adaptation of ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" definitely accomplishes what it set out to accomplish, but honestly, did it really have to be made? I know that kids will like this film, if for no other reason than the joy of seeing cute CG rodents on the big screen. I don't debate the fact that this is a good-looking film, and to some extent, it is fun--or rather, about as fun as simple films can be. But that doesn't mean that it was necessary, and I have no doubt that adults will feel the exact same way. I don't know what original ""Chipmunks"" creator Ross Bagdasarian would have to say about this film, but I suppose it doesn't really matter. At the very least, he would have been glad to hear Dave's trademark shout: ""Allllllviiiiiin!""",1197590400,12,5018,4.75

Dave goes from a man who's truly afraid of any type of relationship to one who'll do anything to get ""his boys back"". The chipmunks actually act like kids and chipmunks (they try to store cooked toaster waffles for winter). As a long time chipmunk fan, I was anxious to see where they put each song and was pleasantly surprised each time, especially ""Witch Doctor"". The beats are updated but the old songs kept intact, and there are some cool new ones as well. There's never a dull moment in this movie, and I highly recommend it for kids and parents alike.",1464652800,3,686,4.496

""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" is the 2007 movie version of the old cartoon series from the 1950s and 1960s, featuring a trio of squeaky-voiced, harmonizing rodents - Simon, Theodore and the irascible Alvin - and their songwriting partner Dave Seville.  In the movie version, only the chipmunks are animated, while the humans exist and operate in the real world - if by ""real world,"" one means a place where perfectly rational human beings barely bat an eye when confronted with anthropomorphic woodland creatures that sing and dance and make a generalized nuisance of themselves.

Little kids may find this film amusing and entertaining - and obviously that's its intended demographic - but for the adults in the audience, it turns out to be a pretty grueling affair overall.  I actually like the Chipmunks in small doses, but stretched out to a full-length feature - especially one as utilitarian, unimaginative and uncreative as this one is - it doesn't take long before they wear out their welcome.  Jason Lee is certainly good-natured and game, playing the human counterpart to the vocalizing chippies, and Justin Long,  Matthew Gray Gubler and Jesse McCartney do a nice job reproducing the chipmunk voices, but the workmanlike screenplay and dull characters eventually take their toll.",1319673600,,1293,5.133333333333334

Who would have thought it, but Dave's surprise house guests turn out to be the perfect accompaniment to his music writing, which has been pathetic and going nowhere. Life gets a little crazy when the singing trio achieve star status and face some of the challenges that go with it. Dave and the chipmunks bond and have ups and downs like a real family. The movie has a little romance in it too. David Cross (the voice of Remi in Ratatouille) is perfect as the jerk you love to despise.",1313020800,,778,4.335616438356165

3294192,3,B00113O7MM,"It should come as no surprise that an adult who dragged her best friend to see Ratatouille would add Alvin and the Chipmunks to her must see list.  Naturally my opinion would be biased based on my passion for cute, little, animated rodents whose furry appeal outweighs any fault of a movie script, still after reading some negative comments, I must post a review of my own.

While some critics attributed the young adult appeal to the 1980's cartoon version of the Chipmunks, they are overlooking the fact that the Chipmunks date back to the baby boomers, and their legendary fame rides on their yearly revived Christmas classic.  They are also undermining the effect of an identifying hit song and the fact that a high pitched tune, supposedly sung by animals is enough to bring adults back to the point where they once believed.  And since I haven't seen such comingling of humans and animation since Roger Rabbit, I'm inclined to think Simon, Theodore, and Alvin are real.

The film starts with these lovable critters fending for themselves in the forest until they get swept away with their Christmas tree that gets hauled into the office of Jett Records where Dave Seville is trying to sell his latest song.  No longer of interest to the company's top executive ""Uncle"" Ian, a discouraged Seville takes off after reclaiming a basket of muffins, where the chipmunks sought refuge after abandoning their tree.  Dave unknowingly takes them home, and the rest is history.

Naturally their rise to fame is not all fun and games because otherwise there wouldn't be a plot, which is at best predictable, and at worse, lame.  The unscrupulous Uncle Ian could have ended up penniless, since he would have been dragged into court by the record industry, animal rights activists, and the family court system, had this been a - do I dare say it - real story.  Likewise, Seville's love life could have been more developed, and the film could have offered some explanation as to why these chipmunks were blessed with the gift of voice.  But who would go to see a movie titled Alvin and the Chipmunks for the plot???

For one adult who was taken in by the main attraction, this movie made me a believer.  I actually thought the beginning of the movie was semi-biographical of Dave Seville's life.  Could he have been a songwriter who was told that no human would record his songs?  Could it have been rejection that inspired him to create the chipmunks?

The answer to both questions is ""No.""  Dave Seville, like Santa, is fictional, as it is a stage name for the Chipmunk's true creator Ross Bagasarian, for whom the movie was rightfully dedicated.  But it's the name ""Seville"" that comes to life with every shout of ""Alvin!""  And if we can accept that some reindeer fly, then why can't some chipmunks sing?",1285632000,,2798,4.731958762886598

With so much success from Transformers and TMNT and with GI Joe on the way we almost forget about the light hearted fun cartoons. Alvin & The Chipmunks have been aroud before the 1980s, but the cartoon was a classic and I loved it to death. So, of course I am going to see the movie.

There was a lot of pesimistic thoughts towards it and the movie was not the best plot wise. Still a movie doesn't have to be perfect to be enjoyed by many. This movie was so adorable and fun to watch. The cartoon definitely had a huge basis around the character development and the songs played on the history of their singing career.

Say what you will, but this movie was fun. If you look hard enough there are even some lessons to be told about youth in the music industry. These past few years have showed us the hardships of some young talents and how they can be troubled by fame and the media spotlight. It's a movie that can be enjoyed by any age and now that I found out that the Chipettes will be playing a major role in the 'Squeakuel' I am ready to throw down another ten bucks and be there front row center.

The Chipmunks (Unfortunatly) Fall For It and Decide To Stay With Ian. Now It's Up To Dave To Get The Chipmunks Back Before It's Too Late.

I Was Surprised By How Eaisly Great and Fun The Film Was. It's A Kids Movie For Kids, But If Your an Adult Who's Grown Up With The Chipmunks I Recommend You Watch With Your Kids. I Would've Given The Film 5 Stars, But The reason I'm Giving It One Star Less Than I Expected To Give It, Was Mainly The Acting Choice of Jason Lee as Dave Seville. Jason Lee Dosn't Make a Very Realistic Dave Seville, He Just Seems Like About Every Carecter He's Played Just More Dramatic, But Most of The Time, It Dosn't Work. Maybe if Thay Got Ross Bagdasarian, Jr. To Play The Live-Action Dave Seville, I Think It Would Be More Dramatic and Comidical Than The Way Jason Lee Did It. The Actors Who Were Cosen To Play The Chipmunk Trio Were Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler, and Jesse McCartney, These 3 Do A Fantastic Job Voicing Them and Thay Make These 3 Singing Chipmunks Beliveable and Fun. The Visuals for The Singing Trio Very Belivable as Well.

As others have said, given the harsh reviews (as well as being an adult, even though I was a Chipmunk fan as a child), it's unlikely I ever would have seen this film had I not been at my friends for the holidays. Maybe it was the company or the season, but I really enjoyed it.

One of my favorite scenes is Dave decorating the tree with the Chipmunks helping out by passing ""ornaments"" from inside the basket. The excited look on Alvin, Simon and Theodore's faces with the Christmas music playing on the piano in the background just stole my heart. Felt like a kid all over again.

I just wanted to make other customers aware before they purchase one that it does require a Blu-ray Disc player, Blu-ray Disc Computer Driver or a Playstation 3.

CGI is pretty good, casting is so so.  I still can't believe they put David Cross and Jason Lee in a kids movie with the foul stuff they've done in the past. I'm no prude, I think it's funny.  Not sure if Jason Lee was the best choice for this role, he doesn't scream ""ALVIN"" very well.  My son doesn't know that nor does he care.  He sings and dances along with the chipmunks and seeing him enjoy himself is worth the price.

3294239,5,B00113O7MM,"The latest incarnation of the late David Seville's fuzzy musical rodents is a definite winner.
  We are first introduced to the brothers, Simon (the smart one), Alvin (the ""awesomest""), and Theodore, (the sweet sensitive one) in their natural habitat, a mountainous area with pine trees as they struggle to store nuts while singing the cutest version of ""You Had a Bad Day"", harmonizing perfectly.
 Strangely, the humans about to cut down their tree don't notice their singing. But their adventure begins when their habitat is hauled away by truck with them inside, and their tree is decorated for display in the lobby of a recording studio where they have their first encounter  with Dave Seville (Jason Lee), an amature songwriter whose latest idea has just been rejected by college mate, Ian (David Cross) the head and CEO of Jett Records.
 Leaving behind their  tree, Alvin, Simon, and Theodore ( voiced by Justin Long, Matthew Gray Guber, and Jesse McCartney) stowaway in the basket of muffins a dejected Dave stole from Ian's office.
 Once in Dave's home, the trio initially get off on the wrong foot. But once Dave realizes they can sing, he lets them stay, and is inspired to continue pursuing a career as a songwriter.
 Childish missteps and faux pas from the trio--especially Alvin-- test Dave's patience, and in the meantime, he works to rekindle a romance with his ex-girlfriend, Claire (Cameron Richards).
  Soon, Ian gets wind of the trio's vocal abilities, and they rocket to fame. Dave is a careful and frugal surrogate parent to the critters he slowly comes to view as his children. But Ian seduces them away from Dave, and they end up spoiled, overworked, and mistreated. The scene where Baby Theodore realizes that Ian lacks the true affection Dave showed for him and his brothers might result in a charge of animal  cruelty in real life, and there is a wistful moment where we watch the little critter wander away hurt and disillusioned.
 But when they see how much Dave cares for them, the ending is predictable, and life for the musical, mischeivous, one-liner-filled ""Fab furs"" ends literally on a happy note.
 There is a bit of unnecessary crassness in this production, but 50 years after his singing chipmunks first became a sensation, David Seville can rest assured that his legacy is in very good hands.",1229904000,,2330,4.89821882951654

3294242,4,B00113O7MM,"""Alvin and the Chipmunks""was amazing. Adults and kids will both love this movie. The only problem was Jason Lee. He was not right for this part. Another actor would have made this movie so much better.",1228176000,,201,4.611111111111111
3294243,4,B00113O7MM,"The movie was funnier than I thought it would be. I loved hearing those little chipmunks sing and they looked so real that I began to think I could go out and get our own chipmunk that hangs out at front door to come in and sing too. It was hilarious watching Jason Lee make their little costumes for them and try to teach them right from wrong. The tree the chipmunks lived in was cut down and hauled into a big city and the little guys had to hid out in Jason's basket to get out of building. When they saw how he was struggling to produce something new in the song industry, they had to help out. He had to teach them about keeping the home clean. The messy little things wrecked his home in no time and he told them they would get, uh...rodents if they didn't keep it cleaner. Hey, they turned out to be great housekeepers!

3294246,3,B00113O7MM,"I was very skeptical about this film watching the trailers for it, but I must admit it's cute with a good message for kids. The Chipmunks steal the show and Jason Lee has the classic ""AAAAALVIN"" scream down pat! Hey let's faces it, Chipmunks talk funny and these animated critters are just so darn cute! It's a pretty basic story, but the cast and FX make this harmless movie fun. The kids should really like this one and I would bump the rating up a notch for them.",1226793600,,466,4.306818181818182
3294247,4,B00113O7MM,"Alvin and the Chipmunks was a favorite show of mine as a child of the 80's.  Just the way Alvin was always getting into trouble was appealing to me and the show quickly won me over.  The movie lived up to the hype.

The movie had some really wonderful animation.  The chipmunks moving around in a real environment, and interacting with the humans was believable, and goes to show just how far technology in movie production has become in the last 10 years or so.

The movie told a really good story, but there were a couple problems I had.  One of them is that, I thought Alvin was supposed to be the chipmunk that constantly gets into trouble?  Well, you didn't really feel that while watching the movie.  Theodore and Simon misbehaved just as often.

Also, while I was laughing at many of the jokes, I felt it could have been even funnier, especially since the guy from My Name is Earl played Dave.

Besides that, the movie delivered with adventure, excitement and everything else that makes a great family movie.

This would make a really good Christmas present.  No, it's not just a Christmas movie- you can watch it over and over many times throughout the year.",1226707200,,1166,4.526315789473684

3294249,4,B00113O7MM,"Years ago every Christmas season there would be a hit holiday song that would be played everywhere. One year it was Alvin and the Chipmunks. Hollywood loves to recycle pop culture because most of its moguls lack even a modicum of creativity or originality so the long-ago Christmas chipmunks (the three of them) are unleashed again in this mindless movie.
 It seems like it's for kids, but the path toward success in the music business seems like an adult theme to me. It's a mixing of adult ambitions and themes with some cute animal characters. I think kids will enjoy it because the chipmunks are always creating a mess and mayhem in the movie, defying adult authority. But it seems to me that a real kids' movie should deal more with fantasy and less with a quest for materialistic success.
 I couldn't understand the words of the chipmunks years ago when they were singing the Christmas song, and I couldn't understand much of what they said in this movie. Either they were really talking chipmunk or else a foreign language; whatever it is, to me they are incomprehensible. I don't think it matters because the dialogue is inane anyway. Turn on you English subtitles to find out what they are saying--if you really care.
 Giving animals human traits, humanizing them (anthropomorphism) is as old as storytelling. This appeals to kids because then the animals can seem like friends, toys, or pets.
 I saw this DVD in Blue Ray, and the colors were gaudy and flamboyant, wildly way too colorful and bright. It gave everything a fake look, but maybe it gave it a fairy tale appearance.
 I believe kids will enjoy the movie, and it's harmless fun.",1225670400,,1648,4.7282229965156795

3294260,2,B00113O7MM,"I burned out on Alvin and the Chipmunks somewhere back around 1958. This may seem hard to believe, but they had a number one hit song. I felt sick every time I heard it on the radio. I just haven't been able to listen to Chipmunk music or view them since that  time. I tell you this as a matter of disclosure so you may understand my review better.

My wife likes animated cartoons and we watch them now and then, too often as far as I'm concerned. A few weeks ago, she purchased an ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" DVD. Groan. Of course, we'd have to view it. Well, last night we viewed it. It was interesting in that the movie was filmed in a conventional fashion and then the animated chipmunks were added to the film as if they had been live at the scenes. It's a clever animation technique, without question. The animated Chipmunks therefore appeared to be interacting with the filmed characters. I suppose it must be difficult to get everything synchronized and in perfect order. The directors didn't. In a lot of places, the chipmunk characters were not in the focus of the actors and you could clearly see the actors were performing on their own. I could cite other glitches, but that would probably be considered too picky.

In any case, I suppose I noticed such things because I found the animation rather interesting, but didn't find the movie itself all that interesting. The human acting seemed stiff and unnatural and the actors interfaced with the animated characters only poorly. The story line was weak and uninteresting. Three singing Chipmunks get discovered and work their way to the top of the charts. Yawn. There weren't many substantial laughs unless you like slapstick. In short, the movie was a waste of viewing  time. However, the animated chipmunks themselves were rather well done, if not a little too cutsiepoo.

I'm really burned out on Chipmunk music, especially that Christmas thing. However, some of the new songs in up-to-date styles with dance routines were mildly amusing. That's about it, folks. View it at your own discretion, it's your dime. I can't comprehend how adults could watch this, but I think that small kids (under six) might find it enjoyable. Did I mention that I'm really burned out on Alvin and the Chipmunks?

3294261,5,B00113O7MM,"The lackluster cover design on the DVD case in no way reflects the movie. It's true they pay people to design these covers, but I nearly always think they'd be better with actual stills, especially in the case of animation. Forget that bad marketing decision, and slip in the disc. Immediately you're transformed back to the whimsical sense of the original ""The Chipmunk Song"" which took radio by storm so many decades ago, and for those lucky enough to remember it, to the great '60s cartoon, ""The Alvin Show"". At the end of the film, the credits even include some of the sleeves for the singles and albums, including Chipmunk Punk, the album that spurred the Chipmunk revival and their eventual return to TV.

This film is a lot better than I expected, and the interview with Ross Bagdasarian explains why. He and Janice had the sense to try and make a family movie that wasn't dumbed down and stupefying. ABC Family, whose motto ought to be ""No Kind of Family"" could take a lesson here. Alvin has style and verve without trying to be Adult Swim. Jason Lee is dead on as Dave Seville, although the cartoon Dave yelled ""Alllvin!"" more often.

The Chipmunk Song arrives in a suitably ramped up version, but one wonders why Dave Bagdasarian's other early radio hit, ""The Witchdoctor"" was recast in a hip hop/ disco/ pop mash that manages to be both overdone and a snooze at the same time (like much radio pop). In the interview Janice B. says that they wanted to keep updating the Chipmunks to keep them fresh. That led to the addition of the Chipettes in the recast TV show. That show proved a popular comeback, but later efforts smoothed off so many rough edges that the later 'toon chipmunks could pass as Care Bears. This film brings back the curious trio's animal instincts (they are Chipmunks) while echoing their individual traits as developed in the cartoons.

What's missing from the mix, of course, is the '60s TV show. There's a tantalizing glimpse of it in an included featurette on the History of Chipmunkmania. This merely shows how great the modern, simple art of the '60s was compared to the later cartoons, not unlike classic ""pie-eyed"" Mickey Mouse compared to ghastly later versions as Disco Mickey. Disney had the sense to bring back the modern, retro Mickey, and hopefully the '60s The Alvin Show will also find its way onto DVD. The shows made a brief return as segments of Wienerville on Nick, which dropped the little orange Nick logo into the opening titles.

Hopefully the Monks don't go Garfield, and start appearing in every style of CGI and animation possible, but rather release their extensive back catalog, and as with this film, remain true to Dave Seville AKA Bagdasarian's original vision.",1220313600,,2723,4.738396624472574

3294273,5,B00113O7MM,"Me and my best friend, Roger,have loved the chipmunks ever sence we were little and now they star in a hit movie musical. the story is a little differant from what any of us were execting, but I liked that, it is more exiting than I ever expected.
 athogh everyone (including me) was epecting this movie to just be a live-action virsion of the chipmunk cartons, the movie's diffarant moods gave it more exitment, Storys whare the charicors have to solve problems and sort out difficulies are always more exiting than those that are just the same way all the way throgh, and sad, scary,and tence scenes make happy endings even more special.
 My favorite part, thogh is the old clasic chipmunk song ""Christmas, don't be late"" any time they sing it, I sing along and dance to it! I also like when dave finnally relizes he really does love the chipmunks, and considers them family.
 The ending, when the chipmunks are finnally reunited wirh Dave, and home agin is so sweet-and funny!
 I think they should make a sequel to this movie with the Girl chipmunks(Chipetts)in it, more songs and the old favorite chipmunk song ""Christmas, don't be late"" and another exiting story with lots of moods.",1217980800,,1187,4.6923076923076925

It's a comedy and brings some laughs too! If you have kids then this is a perfect stocking stuffer or birthday present (if they haven't already seen it).

Dave, the father, yells at Alvin almost as much as he does in the old cartoon!! lol...

3294277,4,B00113O7MM,"""I Told The Witch Doctor You Didn't Love Me True
I Told The Witch Doctor You Didn't Love Me Nice""

(""Witch Doctor"")

Three CGI chipmunks carry this movie on their narrow little shoulders, and that's a very good thing, seeing that the plot is nothing special and neither are the performances of the human actors.

Unceremoniously expelled from their tree home, the chipmunks are having a very bad day, until they show their stuff to Dave (Jason Lee), a songwriter who's told to quit his day job.

What happens next is basically what you'd expect when you let three forest critters occupy your living space, as well as the inevitable series of misunderstandings that occur in mixed species family groups.

David Cross plays Ian Hawke, the hammy heavy. He's a music producer who sees dollar signs with each helium-inspired note, and has great plans for the talented trio which may or may not include dopey Dave.

The music will send adults down memory lane, with new Chipmunky versions of ""Witch Doctor"", ""Funkytown"", ""Only You"", and ""The Chipmunk Song"", and younger viewers will recognize Daniel Powter's ""Bad Day"".  There are also some new funky songs and stylin' choreography.

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. CGI chipmunks sing and dance
2. Rest of movie is the same old song and dance

For children - rated 4 stars
For adults - rated 3 stars (one for each chipmunk)

Recommended as a stocking stuffer for children of all ages, and fans of the TV series.

""We can hardly stand the wait
Please Christmas, don't be late.""

3294278,5,B00113O7MM,This was a great movie. Our family saw it in the theatres on Christmas Eve. It was great to share it with our girls in our home.,1216252800,,128,3.7777777777777777
3294279,5,B00113O7MM,"Thia is by far the cutest movie i 've ever seen , and it's wonderful fun and enjoyment , from the three cute talking Chipmunks finding thier way into the life of of Dave Seville , and singing  and dancing for him which is outrageously cute ,to the sly antics of"" Uncle Ian"" welcoming  them to jett records  and pulling a fast one on Dave.  In the beginning Dave is reluctant to them to being in his house  but eventually they grow on him and they become like family. i love every thing about this movie , from the sound of Dave's voice to the voice of the sweet, sweet cute talking chipmunks  and the music is awesome , i especially love that song
'"" the witchdoctor"" ,  in fact everyone in my house likes this movie so much that we all have our own copy ,  isent that something ? trust me this is one movie you don't wanna miss out on . it's great!",1216166400,,849,4.072289156626506
3294280,5,B00113O7MM,"""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" is a delightful tale of three singing kids who happen to be chipmunks.  Its entertaining story is woven into a commentary about the exploitation of child stars.  Whether you are an original Chipmunks fan, like me, or a new one, like my daughter, the Chipmunks' music and a delightful story will be a treat for anyone.",1215993600,,343,4.7
3294281,5,B00113O7MM,"Great movie, not just for kids, if your having a bad day check this out and it will make you smile.  Furry little guys have adorable smile you can't resist, music isn't bad either.",1215820800,,180,4.294117647058823
3294292,1,B00113O7MM,"Wow I must have missed something!  I don't normally review movies but this was just a completely hoeky movie. When I think Alvin and the Chipmunks I try to remember the cartoon version back in the day and to put it in this wannabe ""cute"" version.... it bombed in my opinion. Nice try but the movie is two thumbs.......way down.  I can see kids liking it.  So if you got them....go for it.  If you're old enough to remember the cartoon like I am....this movie is a disappointment.",1215734400,9,479,4.409090909090909
3294293,3,B00113O7MM,"The movie's plot is entirely predictable. The acting is ok. The most memorable acting moments are done by the CGI chipmunks, which is a little weird. Seville is ok but he has nothing to work with. Nothing is really done with the love interest. She is there to smooth over some plot points. There are some funny gags and some witty lines.  The music is ok. My wife was looking for the subtitles about two minutes into the film. At the start of the movie the chipmunks are really hard to understand, but it gets better.

In summary, I recommend this as a good family film, but nothing extraodinary. I would give this movie another 1/2 star for the humor and the music is memorable.",1214697600,,679,4.424
3294294,5,B00113O7MM,"Love this Alvin and the Chipmunks and hope they produce another one soon!! Recommend to anyone, great for kids and adults. Have watched it over and over - how many movies can you say that about?",1214092800,,194,4.416666666666667
3294295,5,B00113O7MM,"Alvin & The Chipmunks is one of those shows that you remember with fondness from your childhood and thanks to corporate money grabbing, the movie executives decided it was a good idea to take your childhood and update it. I was skeptical at first, I thought this would just be another one of those movies that takes a classic cartoon series like Garfield or The Flintstones and makes a feature length movie using either Live action, CGI or both. Because of this I kept away from this film as long as I could but after resisting temptation for so long, I had to give in and at least give it a try, needless to say I wasn't disappointed. For this review I will discuss both the pros and cons of this movie to give you a fair and honest view of the film to give you an informed decision.

Pro: Jason Lee: Most people will know him from the hit comedy series My Name Is Earl and with these people that will have been the only reason they will have given this film a chance. He's a great comic actor and someone that you just look at and smile because of his natural charisma and ease at which he plays the beaten, yet optimistic Dave Seville. He is a bit cringeworthy when doing the whole ALVIN!!!! thing as, although it's a part of the classic series, in todays setting it just doesn't fit. Either way though Jason Lee was one of the primary reasons why I enjoyed the film like I did

Con: The CGI: I know if you wanted to make a live action version of Alvin and the Chipmunks the use of CGI would be inevitable. The problem I have with it though, is that the CGI animations are quite sub-par and by todays standards should have been much better. At times with the CGI being a bit unrealistic it took a big element out of the film and in a way destroyed the fantasy element of the whole thing.

Pro: The Music: Obviously the whole premise of Alvin and the Chipmunks being that they're singing Chipmunks, the introduction of music would be inevitable. From the get go we're introduced to the classic high pitched yet melodic singing of the gang and the voices just make you think that the whole thing is adorable. Being voiced by Justin Long, Jesse McCartney & Matthew Gray Gubler the singing is an even bigger surprise as it does present a feel of genuine harmony between the three.

Great movie that I personally think everybody should have a watch of.",1214006400,,2350,4.358447488584475

3294299,5,B00113O7MM,"I loved this live version of the Alvin and the Chipmunks Movie and my older sister said that she loved it too. Me and my sisters loved watching the Cartoon of Alvin and The Chipmunks Show when we were kids in the 80's. In the movie the Chipmunks first lives in the tree in the forest and goes home with Dave Seville and Dave becomes their Manager when they became Super Popsingers and than they start living with this Music Producer name Ian Hawk who takes advantage of the chipmunks and at the end of the movie Alvin,Simon and Theodore go back to live with Dave again and reliaze that Dave loved and cared about them more than Ian did of them.

The plot was a little on the simple side, but I didn't mind that, as this was a bit of fun family escapism.",1213574400,,277,4.092592592592593

3294314,4,B00113O7MM,"I'm rating this 4 stars only because my kids love it.  I haven't actually sat through the whole thing.
While I was not thrilled with the potty humor and some of the songs (like ""Don't Cha"" - a bit mature for this audience) my girls (3 and 6) think potty talk is hilarious (they giggle at the movie's frequent use of the word ""butt"") and are too young to get the pop culture references.  They have have seen the movie twice and beg to see it again.  Like another reviewer mentioned of her child, my kids love to say ""Bow-chicka-wow-wow"" while shaking their buns - over and over.
Overall, it is a cute kiddie film that parents can tolerate.",1213142400,,638,4.34453781512605

This was great fun with Dave, Jason Lee ""My Name is Earl"", and the Chipmunks that harkens to the original music and cartoons. Great clean family fun that should please the whole household. Updated for current times we find Dave is having trouble making ends meet since he can't sell his music. Meanwhile the Chipmunks home is made into a Christmas tree in the lobby of the Record label that Dave is trying to sell songs. When Dave is shut out by the agent he picks up passengers he wasn't expecting, talking Chipmunks. Some fairly funny moments throughout. I recommend it.

3294325,5,B00113O7MM,"I love this movie!  The only thing I don't like so much is that how Alvin, Simon and Theodore come to live with Dave is different in the movie than it was in the cartoon.  In the cartoon, Alvin & Co. are taken in by Dave, who knows their mother, after she dies.  And another question is... where are the Chipettes?!  I'll forgive both of those issues because this movie is just too damn cute and I laughed a lot throughout it.  Esp when Simon says that Theodore's turd is a ""raisin"" and puts it in his mouth to prove it to Dave...  Sorry, I just have no problem with potty humor.
I just hope a sequel is in the works and that it includes the Chippettes.  Gotta love the female counterparts.  Either way this a great 80's flashback movie!",1212278400,,737,4.214285714285714

3294368,4,B00113O7MM,"I recall my two youngest falling in love with these smart-aleck fuzzballs when they were children, in the 60's. I had purchased an LP (remember those?) of ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" for them to listen to, and they practically wore it out! All these years later, comes this film, of the Fuzzy Rodentia that entertained them! I had never seen the cartoon, so the film is my introduction to them.

Kids would have a blast with this film! It's combination of Animation and live action was done well, and the Chipmunks received an updating, to appeal to our modern youngsters. I realize the difficulties when meshing live action, to animation, and I give credit to Jason Lee, for his part in this film.

I found a couple of situations in the film to be a bit over some children's heads, but nothing to take away from them enjoying this film. Some have found the ""updating"" of the Chipmunks' songs, misguided, or otherwise objectionable. I did not see this. The lyrics are the same, no?

I wonder if Ross Bagdasarian had given thought to the longevity his creation would ultimately achieve? I'm personally glad that he brought his mischievous carpet bumps to such vivid life! Alvin, Simon and Theodore. May they live on for future generations to come!

There is a history of the Chipmunks, as well as a music featurette, in the Special Features. I found the history of the Chipmunks to be informative, as well as entertaining.",1209859200,2,1419,4.709677419354839

Also, I'm not a fan of hearing my son do his Alvin impersonation of ""bow-chica-wow-wow, chica-wow-wow"" while thrusting his hips left and right.

3294410,5,B00113O7MM,"Dave Seville is a struggling songwriter in need of some special inspiration. Just when he is at the end of his rope, his house is invaded by three stowaways from a muffin basket that are just what the witch doctor ordered! Alvin, Simon, and Theodore, the three chipmunk brothers who now live with Dave and perform his songs, are just kids out to have some fun, but they rapidly become the biggest new singing group in the country. It's all good until music mogul Ian Hawke woos the boys away from Dave and his unintentionally parental influence. Pushing them into the fast lane that is the rock star lifestyle, ""Uncle Ian"" exploits and overworks the Chipmunks while Dave worries and wonders on how to get them back.

When the ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" movie poster started appearing in theaters featuring the three famous 'munks in hip hop threads and CGI quasi-realistic form, most longtime fans cringed. There was a lot of bias against this movie long before it ever came out, and I'd say most of this was the result of an unnecessarily misleading poster and trailer making us expect the boys to be unrecognizably urbanized, a new, realistic look and size that is nothing like the most recent and popular vision of the Chipmunks from the 1980's animated TV series and follow-up movies (1 bigscreen and at least 2 direct-to-video), the general distaste held by at least half of animation fans for live-action/CGI interpretations of their beloved characters, and a distaste from much of the public for family films in general. I'd say the reason the film rates so many stars on Amazon.com is because reviewers here actually saw the film before dissing it. Sure, you'll still have some nay-sayers, folks who can't get past the none-too original family-film plot points like the exploitative record producer and the guy learning to be a parental figure, but if you focus on everything else you will find this to be an excellent film that is great fun and just better and better with repeat viewings!

So, what's so great about this movie? Well, to first address the realistic look/size of the Chipmunks in this film and the less passive Dave than the '80's/'90's version: Jason Lee, cleverly cast as David Seville, is more reminiscent of the original Dave based on Ross Bagdasarian, Sr. (Chipmunks creator and original voice of Dave and the boys) than his '80's counterpart. Let's not forget that the Chipmunks originated in 1958, not in the '80's when their now popular redesigns came about as a result of Bagdasarian, Jr. and wife Janice Karman bringing them back. Keeping that in mind, the Chipmunks were music stars before they were ever animated, and on their early album covers they appeared looking very much like real chipmunks. So, the film versions of both Dave and the Chipmunks themselves are quite appropriate for a first live-action movie. It was probably a wise choice to go to the source material for inspiration rather than trying to adapt the '80's show to live-action (though we'd still hope to see some influence from the '80's in any likely sequels, such as the Chipmunks attending school and encountering the Chipettes). Also a very happy thing about the film is that the characters are not as ""street"" as they appear in the promotional material. In fact, their personalities and voices (despite being voiced by big celebs for some reason) are spot on, just as we've always known them. Yes, the movie is pretty predictable. Dave meets the Chipmunks and together they form a band and a family, with a record producer thrown in as a villain to make it a real feature film. David Cross is hilarious as usual as the slimy record producer, by the way. But it's all about the very fun ride and seeing the Chipmunk origin story told in a grand, modern, live-action scale. There are some nice moments to make it a Christmas fave, the performances are fine (remember that these live-action actors had to play against thin air), the CGI is great, and there's a lot of terrific humor in it too. The driving force though, naturally, is the wonderful Chipmunk music, which sounds better than ever! Flawlessly updated, the songs keep the mood lively and fun throughout the film. In the opening scene, the mood is set beautifully by the Chipmunks doing their own amazing version of ""Bad Day"", and we are also treated to a dazzling bit of Chipmunk ""Funky Town"", not to mention updated versions of beloved classics ""The Chipmunk Song"" (Christmas Don't Be Late) and ""Witch Doctor""! And there are many other fantastic tunes too! Even after you've watched the film repeatedly, you'll find yourself running the DVD over and over again just for the musical numbers!

The DVD itself is rather weak in the extras department. It's a double-sided disc (widescreen on one side, fullscreen on the other, the widescreen looking great), and there is one very nice bonus featurette on each side. Side A has a great featurette about the history of the Chipmunks up to today, and side B has a nice behind the scenes look at creating music for the Chipmunks. Unfortunately, the only other extras are previews for other stuff (there's a scene from Horton Hears a Who and a promo for the Alvin and the Chipmunks soundtrack among them). I can't come down too hard on them for so few extras though, because the featurettes, especially the retrospective, are very nice and I love the film. Still, one expects the theatrical trailer nowadays and a commentary is always great. Or maybe a classic cartoon could have been included (as was included with Underdog's live-action movie DVD). However, I did get this movie in a promotional gift set with little plush toys of Alvin, Simon, and Theodore, so that was really cool. Anyway, I highly recommend this film for fans of the Chipmunks who don't mind that it goes back to its roots, especially if you just love their freaky sound. I also recommend the following live-action cartoons: Josie and the Pussycats (with the heavenly Rachael Leigh Cook), Garfield and Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties (which are flawed in the way some of the characters are portrayed, but Garfield and Odie are well done and they're cute movies), Scooby-Doo and Scooby-Doo 2 (ya love these movies or ya hate 'em, but ya gotta have a sense of humor), the Flintstones and Flintstones Viva Rock Vegas (Viva Rock Vegas is far superior, as they screwed up some of the casting in the original), Popeye (outstanding, underrated film!), Annie (fantastic musical), Dick Tracy (a work of art!), Underdog (nothing too special here, but if you like Jason Lee and live-action cartoons...), Inspector Gadget and Inspector Gadget 2 (I preferred the sequel), George of the Jungle and George of the Jungle 2 (never saw part 2), Dudley Do-Right (don't remember this one well enough to comment), the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles films (classics!), Transformers (great action spectacular!), and I could mention more, but that's a good enough start. Of course, if you love Alvin and the Chipmunks, you have to see ""The Chipmunk Adventure"", ""Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet the Wolf Man"", and ""A Chipmunk Christmas"", all their best work outside of this new live-action feature!",1208995200,2,7154,4.847914963205233

3294422,4,B00113O7MM,"Growing up, one of my earliest memories is of listening to an ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" album that spoofed the ""Urban Cowboy"" soundtrack.  I have no idea what happened to that album, but I do remember that it hooked me on Alvin and company for good.  I watched the cartoon series that came out in the 80's and even saw a few of the old cartoons.  When I saw that Alvin and the gang were headed for the big screen, I had two thoughts:  a) This will be the single worst live action remake ever or b) It just might be fun.  Luckily for me and my daughter, ""b"" was the correct thought.  When this film came out in theaters, I took my daughter to see it and both of us laughed throughout the film.  Jason Lee does an amazing job as kind-hearted Dave Seville, and the voices for the chipmunks, Justin Long (Alvin), Matthew Gray Gubler (Simon), and Jesse McCartney (Theodore), have their respective characters penned perfectly.

The story revolves around Dave finding the chipmunks in his home at Christmas time and then finding out that they can not only talk, but can sing a mean tune as well.  Desperate for money-making song, Dave takes the chipmunks to his record-producer friend, Ian (David Cross in one of his best roles yet), who doesn't believe Dave at first.  Once he discovers the truth, Ian promotes the chipmunks to death in order to drain every dollar he can out of them.  Eventually the chipmunks turn on Dave, and run to the lap of luxury that Ian promises them.  In the end, though, this turns out to be a film about the strength of the family, no matter how different it might be.

The DVD comes with both the full and widescreen versions of the film, as well as some decent special features.  The best of those features is an in-depth look at the creation and creator of the chipmunks, Ross Bagdasarian, Sr.

I thought very hard on giving this film five stars.  It's just that good of a family film.  Sure, there's a little crude humor but the tale is strong enough that most will be able to look beyond that.  In the end, I have to give ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" a very, very sold four stars.  I highly recommend it to anybody with children or anyone who wants to recall some wonderful old memories.",1208736000,6,2212,4.417283950617284
3294423,5,B00113O7MM,"I think Alvin and the Chipmunks was an excellent movie. It has a lot to offer if you watch it properly and not just laugh and forget the little funnies. I think kids will learn a lot from it. I as an adult have learnt a lot from it. The Chipmunks, especially Theodore is the youngest and the cutest one. He is expresses his emotions very freely like any kid should. He is loving and very innocent. He is cared for and looked after by his brothers which kids will find very adorable. I think it teaches a little thing or two about being siblings and looking out for each other.
While the three are different, they show us that they are all alright as they are.
The scene where they give Dave Christmas presents was extremely touching. It shows that it is not the size or the price of the xmas gifts that matter, it is the thought put into it- Theodore shows Dave a little picture and makes a xmas card for him while Simon makes for him a paperclip compass.
I think Jason lee was really excellent in the role as well.

3294425,4,B00113O7MM,"I never would have dreamed that someone would decide to adapt the trio of singing chipmunks known as Alvin and the Chipmunks into a feature film. Yet, here we are, 50 years after their initial debut, getting to see a live-action version of the cute furry guys in action on the big screen. When I first saw the advertisements for ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" my expectations were rather low, mostly because the chipmunks had been removed from the realm of pop culture since the early to mid nineties, and the fact that I haven't been overly impressed with some of the other animated cartoons that have made the jump to the big screen as of late, most recently the below average adaptation of ""Underdog"". So, I thought that any attempt to bring the chipmunks to the big screen would result in a mixed bag of good CGI effects to bring the chipmunks to life, updated and/or butchered versions of some of their classic songs that fans love, and an overall too cute and kid friendly storyline that would be so insipid for any adult to actually tolerate sitting through. However, after renting the movie for my kids to watch, and I of course sat down to watch it with them out of curiosity, I am surprised to say that I was actually impressed by how good this modern adaptation of the classic cartoon turned out to be.

""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" is the story of three talented singing chipmunks named Alvin, Simon, and Theodore, as they rise to stardom in the music business thanks to their songwriter/mentor Dave Seville (Jason Lee). As their popularity increases, a greedy record producer (David Cross) double-crosses Dave and causes Alvin and the gang to mistrust him, thus taking control of the burgeoning career of the chipmunks and pushes the three loveable brothers to their limits and will not stop until he has milked them for all they're worth. Now, it's up to Dave to find a way to win back the trust of his beloved chipmunks, and bring them back to the only place they want to be... home.

As far as cartoon adaptations into feature films go, ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" is definitely one of the better ones in my opinion. I've seen the two `Garfield' films, which were cute, and then the ""Underdog"" movie, which didn't amount to much in terms of entertainment value, and ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"", is by far much more of an entertaining movie than any of those other ones. Director Tim Hill has done a very good job of mixing the modern song styles of today with the classic sounds of some of the chipmunks' famous songs, and he does so without compromising the appeal of those beloved songs. Tim Hill has improved his ability to adapt classic cartoon characters into a feature film when compared to his previous effort, the second film in the `Garfield' series, ""Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties"" which was an average movie at best. This time around he has better tools at his disposal, such as; much more polished CGI characters with the chipmunks, somewhat better actors, and the film's story is much more fulfilling for children and adults thus creating a better overall movie experience for the whole family.

The CGI created chipmunks were very good for 99% of the movie, they weren't completely photo-realistic due to more exaggerated and cartoonish facial features and expressions, and of course the fact that they could talk and sing, and wear clothes, but they fit in nicely in this movie. As good as the CGI was throughout the movie, there was one scene that stuck out to me as being not quite as polished as the others. The scene I am referring to is where Alvin is taking a shower in Dave's dishwasher, even though it was an extremely cute and funny scene, the Alvin character model looked way too stiff and jerky in his movements, having an almost stop-motion feel to him. I don't know if this was brought on by the mixing of CGI water, a wet animated character, and steam together or what; but, the scene definitely stood out to me, and left me feeling as if the visual effects crew could have spent a little more time to perfect that scene and the movie's effects would have been essentially flawless.

The actors all did a good job and thankfully chose not to ham it up too much on screen. Given the type of movie they were in, I'm sure the temptation was there, but they resisted much to the movie's benefit. Jason Lee was a good choice for Dave Seville, the chipmunks' songwriter/mentor/father-figure, but I do have one complaint about his performance. I don't believe that Jason really sold the yelling of Alvin's name during the Christmas song, and other various times throughout the movie. Each time he yelled ""ALVIN!"", I felt it was too forced and unnatural, which is a problem for me because that line is such an integral part of Dave's character and is something that fans of the animated series and songs know all too well. To have that aspect of the character not work perfectly comes off as a weak point in the movie for me, but I digress. Actor and comedian, David Cross was perfectly sniveling and obnoxious as the slimy record producer that wants to cash in on the chipmunk brand, bringing his signature sarcasm and wit to the character, even throwing in a few one-liners that would be funnier to adults than kids. The voice cast for the chipmunks were comprised of some of Hollywood's up-and-coming acting talents, such as; Justin Long (Alvin), Jesse McCartney (Theodore), and Matthew Gray Gubler (Simon). The choice to include decently recognizable names to voice these characters would have been a wise decision had their voices not been modified; however, due to the fact that their voices were recorded at half-speed and sped up to normal speed to create the chipmunk sound, having recognizable actors providing the voices seemed rather pointless. I mean there was no distinguishable quality to identify that Alvin's voice was that of `The Mac Guy' in the PC and Mac commercials from TV, so I don't understand the logic behind that decision to go with somewhat recognizable actors over unknowns, but I'm not the one that makes these decisions so maybe to some Hollywood suit this choice made sense, you've got me though.

""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" is one of those rare live-action movies aimed primarily at kids that adults can enjoy as well. The movie actually manages to avoid the pitfall of oversimplifying everything in the story for kids; instead, opting to create a heartwarming and updated re-telling of a classic animated series that successfully introduces the characters of Alvin, Simon, and Theodore to a whole new generation to enjoy, and gives those that are familiar with them already a nice walk down memory lane.

3294429,4,B00113O7MM,"(please read this review in a pompous, snobbish tone) Alvin and the Chipmunks is one of those great pieces of cinematic bliss that causes the viewer to take one of two paths. The first is to follow the storyline for what it appears to be and the other is to see the story for what it really is.

What we see is a man who adopts three young chipmunks and begins a record career with them. What we're supposed to see, however, is a man, perhaps mid to late thirties, and his frantic, feeble cry for help.

Exhibit A: ""Dave"", if that is his real name, is the quintessential metro- male, possessing a lavish garden full of fresh flowers, an immaculate house that doesn't so much as show a hint of dust throughout, and a wardrobe that would make even the fastest trigger-tongued females pause out of respect for his delicate taste and touch. And yet, poor Dave can't catch a break. He's creepily overbearing with the ladies (and on a side note, there is enough eye-candy in this film to keep most men delightfully happy) and his entire demeanor screams one deft-defying truth as we psycho-analyze poor and pathetic Davey: that he is celibate, has been so for a VERY long time, and in an effort to proscribe the immensity of his innate desires, creates three fictitious ""chipmunks"" as a form of psychotic catharis. They are to him the elements that drive the demons away at night as he rocks himself to sleep in the fetal position, the saviors who keep his mind occupied when his hot neighbor walks by in a bouncy-bounce blousey-blouse. They are figments of poor Dave's baseless soul.

So our lesson is clear, kids. Celibacy is a good thing for a while, but not forever. 'Alvin and the Chipmunks' offers cathartic proof in what celibacy will do to you if you hold onto it too long.

sincerely,

the pompous, smug reviewer",1208131200,12,1815,4.5552147239263805
3294430,4,B00113O7MM,"i just saw this movie and i have to say i am both impressed and a little disappointed in it.
the film starts off with the three chipmunks in the woods storing nuts for winter,when their tree is chopped down by loggers and then taken to the big city and thus enters the life of dave seville who is a struggling music writer trying to make that one song that someone will want to sing and thus is unable to make.
so, enter the three chipmunks into his life and things begin to change for them all drastically.the voices were great for the three chipmunks and the movie had it's funny moments to it as well as it's serious messeage of nothing is more important in life then understanding the meaning of being a family.
now for the down sides to this movie, jason lee from that craptacular nbc show called earl plays dave seville which in my opinion was a huge mistake.he makes the character too shallow,arrogent and stupid about everything having to do with both dave's life and lost relationship with his ex girlfriend who is also his across from him neighbor as well.
secondly,the chipmunks singing of songs in this movie could have been better as they are no good at singing hip hop or anything like that.in my opinion this part of the movie could have been done better.
all in all this movie was botrh great and funny and both a little disappointing and could have been done better.

In the movie the chipmunks are tired of the forest life and end up in a Christmas tree till they meet Dave the song writer for a big record company that just fired him for a stupid song about death. The boss of the record company is Ian who thinks that he found the chipmunks and wants to take them on a world tour but takes it a little too far but you have to figure that out when you see the movie.

I found though, after being forced by family to watch this movie, that instead of `destroying' them they actually brought them to a wider audience.  In fact, `Alvin and the Chipmunks' was fun, fresh, spunky and pretty much everything I remember about those cute fuzzy little rodents in the first place.  I was pleasantly surprised with how well thought out this movie actually was.

The story follows Dave Seville, a down and out songwriter who is just trying to catch a break.  That break comes in a much unexpected place.  Dave meets three cute little chipmunks who just so happen to be able to talk.  Not only can they talk but they can sing.  Striking a deal that if they sing his songs he'll let them live with him, Dave and the Chipmunks form a musical team.  That team is threatened though when a greedy music executive Ian Hawke attempts to drive a wedge between Dave and the boys for his own selfish gain.

The very concept of `Alvin and the Chipmunks' has been modernized to appeal to today's youth but it never loses the charm and appeal that it's always had.  That's what I respect so much about this adaptation.  I was so certain they were going to ruin what remains such a wonderful childhood memory of mine, but I'm so happy to say that that couldn't be further from the truth.  In fact, thanks to `Alvin and the Chipmunks' I now have a nice way of passing along this wonderful and wholesome children's story onto my own children.

The acting is decent, although the CGI-Chipmunks do steal the whole show.  Jason Lee has never really had a good track record with film; he's more suited for television (as `My Name is Earl' has proven) but he manages to deal well with this performance.  David Cross plays the same character no matter what film he's in, and he does a decent job at it so who am I to knock it.  Cameron Richardson doesn't have to do much but be pretty, and she is.  Jane Lynch is fantastic in her very short cameo performance.  She is always hilarious and she captures everything I love so much about her without really having much to do.  Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler and Jesse McCartney play Alvin, Simon and Theodore, although you never no it with all the voice distorting going on.  I can't really say anything for their voice-over work because quite frankly it's not really them performing is it?

`Alvin and the Chipmunks' also manages to teach the viewer some important lessons about the reality of family.  It proves that a family is so much more than a mother, father, sons and daughters but can really come in any shape or size.  A family is a group of people (or animals in this case) who love and care for one another and who look out for one another and have each others best interests at heart.

I think it's obvious where I stand with this one.  I was floored with my final reaction to the film.  I'll most definitely see it again, most likely I'll own it, for it's such a fun and entertaining film that I'm sure my daughter will grow to love it, and it's something the whole family can enjoy wholeheartedly as apposed to merely tolerate begrudgingly.",1207526400,,3264,4.477157360406092
3294433,5,B00113O7MM,"For many of us our childhood was filled with the memory of three little voices singing in beautiful high pitched harmony. Granted those voices were sped up singers whose altered versions were representing three loveable rodents, but to us it didn't matter. Alvin and the Chipmunks were as real as anything else on TV. Now, Alvin and his brothers Simon and Theodore receive an update and it's not half bad.

David Seville (Jason Lee of MY NAME IS EARL) is a down on his luck songwriter whose songs are too cutesy for ex-friend and mega mogul record producer Ian (David Cross). But all that changes when he inadvertently comes across three singing chipmunks that turn his song about Christmas wishes into what is a potential blockbuster. Once Ian hears the song and realizes the potential, he comes across big time with a set up that will make the boys stars.

Dave, while trying to set boundaries up letting the three know that they are working together and nothing more, begins to grow attached to the little guys. He may be strict on a few items but he has their best interests at heart. Not so Ian.

Ian sees nothing more than dollar signs when he hears them singing. He begins a campaign to lure them away and make them the latest pop sensations of the world. His lavishing of gifts and wooing of the boys via their egos results in Dave being left behind while Alvin and his brothers live a life of luxury and non stop toys.

But all of this comes with a price as the chipmunks are worked non-stop. New records, merchandise and a worldwide concert tour take their toll and they reach a point of exhaustion. Too bad Ian sees them only as rodents that are there to do nothing more than increase the size of his wallet.

It's up to Dave and his old girlfriend to save the day and rescue Alvin, Simon and Theodore. But will they be too late? Will the boys finally realize that Dave was right all along? And will Ian be able to stop any attempt at rescue that is made?

Okay face it, you know the outcome of a movie like this. It's not the answer to that question that makes you watch. It's more about the interplay between the characters, even if three of them are computer generated. You still find yourselves attracted to the cute little guys and want the best for them.

The movie features over the top performances by all cast members, but that should be expected in a movie aimed at the elementary school level audience. They'll be more interested in the three main characters anyway and touched by scenes such as Theodore climbing into bed to sleep with Dave after having a nightmare.

At least two classic Chipmunk songs are featured here, one sounding much like the original while the second gets an update. A few scattered gastro intestinal jokes are offered for the new generation, but on the whole this is a movie that the entire family can watch together. That alone makes this movie a fun watch for everyone.",1207440000,5,2920,4.517045454545454
3294434,5,B00113O7MM,"My wife and I just bought this movie and after watching it, it proves that the T.V. and newspaper critics are wrong. But then again, that's what happens when you rely on an opinion. The best way to judge a movie is if it peaks your interest, go see it. If we see a commerical for a movie and it slightly peaks our interest then we wait for it to be released on DVD.

The story follows 3 chipmunks, Alvin and his brothers; Theodore (the one with the baby fat) and Simon (the intelligent one with the glasses). Remember the popular cartoon Alvin and the Chipmunks? Anyway, after their tree is cut down by man, they cross paths with Dave Saville (Jason Lee from My Name is Earl and A Guy Thing), who is a struggling music writer. Dave thinks hes found his big break (he gets an idea to create a Christmas song that most of us had heard on the radio during Christmas time) and tries to convince Ian (David Cross from Men in Black 2 and Scary Movie 2) who is the chairman of Jett Records. They get cold feet. At times the little fury cuties get on Dave's nerves as he hasn't fully accepted them in his house. When Alvin and the Chipmunks go to Ian to try to fix their relationship with Dave, they inadvertnly cause themselves harm. Ian sees visions of money...in his pockets. He cooks up a scheme to lure the chipmunks (who are just kids) away from Dave so he can put them through a grueling European concert tour and a whole lot more. Enriching himself at the expense of the chipmunks. Will Ian succeed? Will Dave be able to save them?

This movie was very cute. The chipmunks while they are a product of CGI animation, they were so adorable. The movie does take place right before Christmas so it seems like a holiday movie. The movie does have its funny parts, drama, and heart warming charm. I will admit that I was like,"" Awwwwwwww"", when Theordore had a nightmare and asked Dave if he can sleep in his bed that night. Dave reluctantly said yes and told him to sleep on the other side of the bed, however Theordore cuddled up on Dave's forehead and wrapped himself in a little ball. So cute! While the animated cartoon Alvin and the Chipmunks wasn't at the top of my list when it was on ( I liked Scooby Doo, The Jetsons, He-man, The Gobots, Heathcliff, Tom and Jerry, The Real Ghostbusters, The Ghostbusters, Woody Woodpecker, Space Ghost, Transformers, and the Hurculoids; just to name a few ;-), this movie was indeed very cute with some spirts of comedy. I will admit that I did watch the cartoon when it was on before I had to go to school.

Hardly any foul language. Just one minor possible issue. Watch out for the part when the chipmunks are singing, Ian says,"" Make love to the music."" Awkward moment alert! This is the only part that might make parents squirm but the scene moves very quickly so it will be unnoticed. I just happened to hear it, most times I'm oblivious, lol until I've watched a movie several times.

The movie has both fullscreen and Widescreen versions on one disc. Side A has fullscreen and side B is widescreen. The movie looked great on a LCD TV and playing it on a 1080p upconverting DVD (recordable) player showed an even beautiful picture. Some minor additions to the DVD include an extra about Alvin and the Chipmunks and a sampling of their music. Alvin and the Chipmunks is a great family addition to your DVD collection as well as anyone elses. Enjoy it!",1207353600,5,3394,4.40829346092504

IT'S CUTE, HAS SOME FUNNY MOMENTS, AND MOST IMPORTANT, SHOWS RESPECT TO THE ORIGINAL IDEA OF THE CHIPMUNKS.  WHAT'S WRONG WITH COMING UP WITH A STORY LINE THAT COULD BE HOW IT ALL BEGAN??  AND A LOT OF PEOPLE LOVE THEIR CHRISTMAS SONG AFTER ALL

I WAS ALSO VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE ANIMATION OF THE CHIPMUNKS FOR THIS FILM.

NOT ALL FILMS HAVE TO BE DRAMATIC, BE A EMOTIONAL TEAR JERKER, OR HAVE A 'MOTIVATION'.

3294436,5,B00113O7MM,"I first saw mention of this movie when I went to the theater last summer to see ""Hairspray"". I was ecstatic to hear that it'd be showing around Christmastime. In the 80's, I was a hardcore Alvin & The Chipmunks fan, I admit. I watched the cartoon show religiously every Saturday Morning. Sadly, Christmastime rolled around but I never was able to go see it. Not that I didn't want to, I did. Time wouldn't allow me to. Now, it's out on DVD and I finally made time to purchase and see this movie. I'm really glad I did. It's an endearing movie about a songwriter named Dave Seville who meets the 'munks when they're raiding his kitchen for food. Quickly, he boots them out. Yet, when he finds out that they can carry a tune, he quickly welcomes them back in & totes them off to a record executive who soon takes them away from Dave & exploits their talent for all it is worth. Dave spends the rest of the movie trying to save the boys from a showbusiness life they are too young for. Like everyone else, I would have loved the movie alot better if it would have shown alot more of the chipmunks...you know, like the cartoon does. It's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be, though. Course, Garfield's first movie didn't show him all that much either and it was just as awesome. When they make a 'munks sequel(and I'm sure they will), we'll probably see more of them. At any rate, if you're looking for a good movie that the whole family can watch, look no further than Alvin and The Chipmunks. It's a humorous, fun movie. I loved it.",1207267200,3,1536,4.3
3294437,5,B00113O7MM,"This film teaches important lessons to children in a gentle and very entertaining way. Lesson One: Discipline is important to children. Lesson Two: Anything in excess, even fun, can ruin your life. Lesson Three: The entertainment industry, although glamorous, can be harmful. Stable family life is more important. And dads are important role models for young sons. Alvin and his companions Simon and Theodore learn these lessons from their surrogate father Dave and from the hard knocks they endure as they leave Dave and rise to recording stardom. Seldom have I seen such an entertaining film spell out such excellent values for young children. In terms of pure fun, the chipmunks are believable and so precious they can make you cry. Jason Lee is outstanding as the caring ""dad"", Dave. The music is wonderful: great remixes of ""Witch Doctor"" and the Chipmunks Christmas song. Don't listen to the critics on this one. It is amazing. See this with your little ones and talk to them about the lessons the chipmunks learn. Oh, and by the way, the movie makes everyone feel like a kid again!

The Movie is tailored more for kids, but if you grew up with the chipmunks you will appreciate this film. After having there tree cut down by loggers, Alvin and his buddies Simon and Theodore end up in Los Angeles where they meet a struggling musician named Dave. After turning Daves house upside down Dave throws them out only to discover their vocal talent. Realizing their potential, Dave introduces them to a record executive named Ian who turns the chipmunks in to an overnight sensation. After Ian takes the chipmunks under his wing and spoils them with toys and gifts, the chipmunks start to miss their home with Dave. Will the chipmunks let fame change them or will they go back to the life they had when they lived with Dave? This is a fun filled movie with the cool little trio many generations have grown up with. As for the Blu-ray high def release the picture is good, but not one of the best. The sound is also mediocre as is the lack of bonus material. I was very disappointed at fox for pulling the extra disc with the digital copy (lets you copy to your ipod) from this blu-ray release at the very last minute.

Jason Lee plays Dave Seville who is a struggling songwriter.  When he finds the chipmunks in his kitchen (their tree got cut down to make a Christmas tree and they ended up in the city), he throws them out only to hear them singing later and begins to think that they could bring him success.  He lets them stay with him if they sing his songs.  There is Alvin who is voiced really well by Justin Long and the mischievous leader of the trio; brainy Simon and cute and chubby Theodore (I love the scene with them having a shower in Dave's dishwasher).  But Daves friend Ian wants to break up this happy group to exploit the chipmunks.
It's such a cute movie that is funny and so entertaining and even though it's not the kind of movie to watch over and over again, it's certainly worth buying to look at everynow and then.

I knew we had a winner when, as we exited the theater, I asked my daughter what she thought of the movie, and she simply replied, ""I want it."" She has never specifically asked me to buy ANY movie watched in the theater. And I admit, I want this movie too!

It was such a refreshing change from the animated movies released over the past couple of years. With those movies, we watched the previews and headed to the theater with great anticipation just to leave the theater disappointed because every one of the funniest moments was covered in the previews and honestly was funnier in the previews. With this movie however the trailers undoubtedly had us laughing; we played them over and over (we particularly enjoyed the dishwasher/shower scene).

The story starts with Dave, an unsuccessful song writer, who accidentally takes the chipmunks home. This is where all the fun starts. He wants them out, then finds out they can sing!  He says they can stay if they sing his music. The chipmunks grew up in a forrest with no parents, so they have NO manners. There are loads of funny scenes as they destroy his house and his social life. He is determined not to be their ""dad"", they're just friends.

Enter evil uncle Ian. He is Dave and the chipmunks manager, who of course, told Dave his music stunk before the chipmunks entered the scene. On Christmas, Dave had given the boys savings bonds, which granted, is a lame gift. But he meant well, and he was thinking about their future. Uncle Ian comes in with lots of toys, setting the scene for Dave is the serious one, and uncle Ian is the fun one.

Dave of course gets soft to the boys, and his desire that they have a normal childhood becomes apparent, whereas Ian just wants to make money. Ian eventually exploits the situation and the boys come to live with him. This is where the real drama comes in. You have to see the movie to find this part out. But don't worry, it has a happy ending with a nostalgic ""ALVIN!!!""

The music is absolutely great. There are songs I remember from growing up in the sixties, and then there are new ones that are more in keeping with today's music.

  I don't get it how Roger Ebert could recommend both Garfield movies but only give this **. Sure the end is anti-climatic but other than that it's pretty cute and harmless. Well harmless despite the one scene where Simon eats Theodore's poop making believe it's food so he won't get in trouble from Dave. That was gross and un-needed although yes I did laugh but it's not something needed in a kids movie.",1199404800,17,837,4.387096774193548
