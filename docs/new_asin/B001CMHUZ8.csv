3514243,1,B001CMHUZ8,"I have to agree with Nicole on this one...

Currently amazon is selling How I Met Your Mother Seasons 1-3 for $107.99.

You can go to Walmart right now and buy all three seasons for $87.58 plus tax.

Not only is it cheaper, but you'll have them right away.",1224288000,7,256,4.183673469387755
3514244,1,B001CMHUZ8,"Amazon currently shows a preorder price of $89.99 for this 3-season collection.

They currently sell Season 1, Season 2, and a preorder of Season 3 for a combined price of $87.97

Why buy this 3-season box set when you could buy all three individually for cheaper?

Not cool, Amazon!!!",1216944000,27,285,4.775510204081633
3514245,5,B001CMHUZ8,"This show is great.  After watching most of the episodes on TV, I still had to have them to watch over and over.  My friends don't seem to be amused by my Barney Stinson catch phrases--simply cause they have not scene the show.",1244160000,,227,4.255813953488372
3514246,5,B001CMHUZ8,"I watch a little too much tv (in my own opinion) but do not generally collect tv-on-dvd for shows; I own 3, and two were gifts.  After seeing a few pivotal episodes of How I Met Your Mother, I fell madly in love (mostly with Barney/NPH) and bought all three seasons available on dvd.  I still feel it was one of the better decisions I made this semester, as the writing and acting are just incredible, and I never fail to laugh out loud, even upon repeat viewings.  I can't wait for season 4 to be released!!",1242864000,,508,4.216494845360825
3514247,5,B001CMHUZ8,"This is one of my favorite shows. I encourage everyone to check it out. This is a great way to get the whole set. I like that it's not a boxed set, so it won't look out of place once I buy the 4th season.",1239235200,,204,3.5555555555555554
3514248,5,B001CMHUZ8,"I love this TV show, so I was ecstatic to get all three seasons at once.  Great show, great price!  Can't complain!",1238457600,,115,4.181818181818182
3514249,5,B001CMHUZ8,"To sum up these 3 seasons into one word...all one can say is legendary. One of the best tv shows out there, yet not as media recognized as many of the others, this show keeps you laughing the whole time yet wraps you up in the story that is How I met your mother. Each character brings something different to the show; each one you'll love in a different way. This shows is definitely worth the buy! Just watch Amazon and make sure you don't pay more than 50ish dollars for all three together.",1237507200,,493,4.25531914893617
3514250,5,B001CMHUZ8,"This item (HIMYM season 1 to 3) is it the same like if I buy the 3 differents seasons separetely in 3 differents boxes ?
Or is it a special box with all the 3 seasons ?
Does the bonuses are included like in each season ?
Do we see new stuff which are not included in any of the 3 differents seasons bought separetely ?
Thanks for your answers",1237420800,,342,3.9
3514251,5,B001CMHUZ8,"This 3 season package was convenient, inexpensive, and it shipped very quickly. How I Met Your Mother is one of the best shows on television right now. Thank you Amazon! I'll be buying season 4 when it comes out.",1237161600,,212,4.461538461538462
3514252,5,B001CMHUZ8,"Haaave you seen a better show? I doubt it.
Hilarious show - NPH really recreated himself. And the bundle of 3 is perfect - you can't just watch one season!",1236729600,,155,4.2
3514253,5,B001CMHUZ8,I am suspect to give some feedback because I really love this TV show! The best ever! I strongly recommend for those that are HIMYM fans!,1236643200,,137,4.3076923076923075
3514254,2,B001CMHUZ8,"I bought this on the recommendation of my children. I was led to believe that it was as captivating, if not more so, than the FREINDS series (of which I am a very big fan). To tell you the truth it took me until after the 2nd season to get into it. The story line in promising; a father telling his children the story of how he met their mother in detail. His stories become the series and he grows from these experiences and it takes him onto the path to meet his better half. The characters are endearing but not too believeable. The married couple are authentic but often irritating. The one personality that is interesting is the eternal bachelor friend, who is pertified of commitment and the female version of this which becomes his girlfriend. I would recommend this to anyoune who is in for a very light comedy. As long as you are not looking for breakthrough in sitcom tv.",1236211200,,881,4.411042944785276
3514255,5,B001CMHUZ8,"Funniest Series ive seen in a while, definately worth buying it. And love the extra's expecially of Lilly and Marshals Honeymoon.",1235433600,,129,5.190476190476191
3514256,5,B001CMHUZ8,"I happened to watch a couple of episodes of this (4th) season on tv, and thought it was pretty funny; so when I saw that all 3 seasons were only 45 bucks I bought it immediately.  This is a great value; and the show is hilarious.  I highly recommend",1234483200,,249,4.061224489795919
3514257,5,B001CMHUZ8,"Great show... clever dialog... great combination of ""manly jokes"" and ""chick drama""... one of the better comedy series in long while. Highly recommend!",1234310400,,151,5.608695652173913
3514258,5,B001CMHUZ8,"I love this show, it is one of my favourites.
It has one of the best continuities of any show I have ever seen and I can't think of many times it has disappointed me, even little things in the background such as the photos get changed depending on when it is supposed to be set. It is things like that that make it more awesome.

The acting is quite good, it is amazing what Neil Patrick Harris what has done with Barney, who could be the most hated character ever in a lesser actors hands. The entire cast have an excellent chemistry and there seems to be a vibe that even they are having a good time.

The show to me seems very real, I could see my friends and I just sitting around a bar and making jokes and telling stories, what really makes it is that the others laugh! A rarity on any sitcom.

Worth every cent!
The special features are nice as well, what's not to love about two full length film clips from the ever wonderful Robin Sparkles?",1234051200,,949,4.174863387978142
3514259,5,B001CMHUZ8,Seasons 1-3 are great. This show is worth the money so you can watch it all the time. It never gets old. Super funny. Highly recommend it!,1233532800,,138,4.148148148148148
3514260,5,B001CMHUZ8,I love How I Met Your Mother and to get it so quickly and at such a great price! AWESOME! I've only had it a few weeks and already finished all of them:),1232236800,,153,3.6666666666666665
3514261,5,B001CMHUZ8,"I can't think of a better way to spend $45 than to get buy seasons 1-3 of HIMYM.  Each usually retails for about 25-30, so this is a steal!",1231632000,,139,3.793103448275862
3514262,5,B001CMHUZ8,"When this series first aired on t.v., I was a new mom and wasn't able to watch it. I started catching the show after ""The Big Bang Theory"" last year and I was hooked. I bought the first season for Christmas and decided to buy this set because the price was reduced and too good to pass up. This is currently one of the best comedies on t.v. right now. My other favorite comedies are ""The Office"", ""Scrubs"", and ""The Big Bang Theory"". This show is definitely one to have on DVD - everyone can relate to one of the characters and to some of the disastrous dating stories told on the show.

The entire cast is very funny and likeable. I also LOVE the character ""Barney"" (Neil Patrick Harris). I was never a fan of ""Doogie Howser"" but he is SO FUNNY in this series - his gestures even make me laugh! I am a fan of Alyson Hannigan from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" - it only took me a couple of episodes for me to not think of her as the ""Willow"" character anymore. I am just SO glad to have found this show in this current t.v. wasteland of reality shows...",1231200000,3,1051,4.151960784313726
3514263,5,B001CMHUZ8,"Regardless of the cost, this is an excellent show that is worth owning at home. I love rewatching these episodes and never get tired of them like other shows. I find something new in them every time. They are HILARIOUS and a staple with my husband and coworkers. Men and women alike can appreciate the humor in this show.",1230595200,7,321,4.4576271186440675
3514264,5,B001CMHUZ8,"First of all, squabble over a couple dollars is silly.  But if you wait a couple months, prices drop.  Why do you even bother buying this as soon as it is released if you are worried about a few bucks.....wait a couple months and prices drop.......you paid over $80 in Oct and I paid under $50 in Dec.  if you are worried about a couple bucks, then wait a couple months and you can save over $40.",1230422400,2,396,4.116883116883117

8288191,5,B001CMHUZ8,"This show is clever and entertaining, especially when you forget about the laugh track in the background.  The characters are interesting, especially Barney, who brings a good portion of the humor to the episodes.  There's nothing quite like starting a show with Bob Saget's voice.  More like a sitcom of old than other shows like The Office and 30 Rock, How I Met Your Mother is a show about friendships in NYC and trying to find love.",1274918400,,436,4.636363636363637

Feel free to watch it or in case of any doubts if you haven't saw it yet, just go for it. Just Legendary. xP",1252713600,,190,4.026315789473684

8288196,5,B001CMHUZ8,"I love this comedy, i have watched it over and over again. It's soo funny. Some of additional scenes are even more funnier than original used scenes.
3pack is really cheap.

Downside is some of additionals are interlaced.
I'd like to see next season's not interlaced. Because there is no good reason to use low vertikal resolution with sutch bitrate on nowadays HD TV-s.",1246492800,,370,4.78125
8288197,5,B001CMHUZ8,"Hello from Germany,
since a year now HIMYM has reached Germany and the series is one of the greatest I ever saw. The only problem is the German sychronization.
I wachted it in German TV and it was funny. Then I watched it in English and it was amazing. Thats the reason why I ordered it for 38,99$ plus packing. Thats a more than great price. In Germany I would have to pay this per season Oo...

So USA, thanks for reading my comment (please don't count my mistakes in this little text :) )

Have a nice day :)",1245715200,,511,4.1
8288198,4,B001CMHUZ8,"CBS has done it again..a fresh new comedy, and right out of the gate, the chemistry between all of the main characters feels settled in, like they have known each other as long as the story alludes to.

The premise: Ted's best friend has just gotten engaged, and at the age of 27, Ted is starting to feel that ""settle down"" kinda feeling. And it's his friends mission to help him find that perfect woman!! The voice of Bob Saget plays the ""future Ted"" who is telling his teenage children all about ""how I met your Mother""...and he does a great job of interjecting the humor, embarrassment, terror and ultimately, the pilot ending Surprise,in a kind of ""Wonder Years"" type format that suits this whole concept very well.

Josh Radnor plays Ted, and is a great comedic actor, with very good timing, and very believable as slightly bumbling yet definitely desirable man ready to start out a new life.

Neil Patrick Harris plays the lovable, yet obnoxious ""other"" best friend Barney...and his performance was great!! What a comedian he is!! I look forward to seeing more of him in this well written role!!

Alyson Hannigan plays Lily... for all you Buffy fans, you will appreciate and enjoy the new comedic talent that is coming to light in this great young actress.

Jason Segel plays Marshall..Ted's Best Friend..again, another good fresh comedian who has spot on timing, and just compliments this ensemble cast perfectly.

I haven't been this excited about a comedy since Friends...I hope that this does well..with the surprise ending that it had, I can see how they can possibly take this show into a fairly long run with lots of fun twist and turns. I hope they can come up with a lot of them!! I am definitely watching this one again!! Bravo CBS!!",1244332800,,1749,4.699346405228758
