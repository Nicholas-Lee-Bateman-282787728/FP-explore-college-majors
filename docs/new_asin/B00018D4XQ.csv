1976756,3,B00018D4XQ,"Only saw the first episode. Confusing, I guess Kino was talking to the motorbike. Also I don't know if subtitles translating texts would help.",1479600000,,142,4.958333333333333
1976757,5,B00018D4XQ,"Quiet, thoughtful.  A little melancholy.  It kind of reminds me of the Twilight Zone sometimes.  Great anime series.",1479513600,,116,5.333333333333333

1976763,5,B00018D4XQ,"Some things are hard to forgive, grainy quality video, bad over-voicing, and an initial premise that is more absurd. The mere artful writing and craftsmanship of Kino's Journey forgives all of these imperfections. Each episode is myriad of gedanken experiments with philosophical punches and exciting twists. One suggestion: This is for those like to think while they watch. It will only turn out better.",1475884800,,404,5.328125
1976764,5,B00018D4XQ,Very interesting concept. Enjoyed,1475625600,,33,7.5
1976765,4,B00018D4XQ,My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is the lack of a subtitled version. The show is longer on introspection than action but the story is interesting and the characters complex.,1475107200,,181,4.515151515151516
1976766,5,B00018D4XQ,a great bit of story telling,1474848000,,28,3.8333333333333335
1976767,3,B00018D4XQ,"It's hard to give KINO a neutral review of only 3 of 5 stars, but the story arc is, for me, tenuous at best. Also troubled by the prevailing sense that Kino is not affected by the wholesale slaughter nor by his own killing. Random butchery mingles with familial warmth, and romantic sweetness smells of cloying decadence. All at such subdued effect that interest flags and a sense of detachment amid gory murders burgeons.",1474848000,,422,4.716216216216216

1976783,5,B00018D4XQ,One of the few anime series that I actually own. Always loved the simplicity of storytelling with a quiet eye for details even in the midst of ambiguity. The atmosphere of a traveler that never commits to a single place but allows for the journey to tell the story. Music is great and animation is perfect for the genre.,1470787200,,320,4.440677966101695

1976792,5,B00018D4XQ,"What an awesome journey indeed. This series does an amazing job at providing clear symbolisms between the fictional societies kino visits and our own. All without drawing the viewer out of the experience, you will compare the different places, or ""countries"" to our own almost subconsciously. Though some of the characters are underdeveloped I can't say it really detracts from the experience. All in all a great show, my only wish is that it was longer.",1468108800,,454,4.9868421052631575

1976794,5,B00018D4XQ,Each country has its own twist. It's a nice anime with an Outer Limits flavor that doesn't feel the need to assault me with seizure mode graphics like a lot of others; not that there's not a place for that too,1467763200,,209,4.121951219512195

1976799,4,B00018D4XQ,This series starts out slow but picks up in the second episode and keeps you hooked with where the journey will take Kino and Hermes.,1466899200,,133,4.36
1976800,5,B00018D4XQ,"Enjoyed it for what it was.... didn't think much of it at first glance. Got bored one day and decided to give it a watch, glad I did human nature is a funny thing especially in this anime. I found it quite thought provoking, especially since its main character is a little girl who is both mentally and emotionally mature and physically capable of taking care of herself. I'm sure people who watch this will be like ""hey that's the world  I'm living in now"" or ""I always wondered what the world would be like with no secrets or no boundaries but I guess I never took that into consideration"" I guess having been in the Navy for quite sometime sort of made me feel in tune with this show. Being a traveller isn't any easier in real life, and having rules for yourself is always a must, especially in another country. Holding yourself back from certain situations that you shouldn't involve yourself is always hard, especially if wrong in your pov is the right to other people in their homeland.... self preservation wins out ( that's reality)",1466812800,,1041,4.537234042553192

1976806,4,B00018D4XQ,"Parable-driven adventure series; investigating the transient nature of societal and cultural values, across pre-globalization communities. Original, and thought provoking, if somewhat lacking in action.

1976819,5,B00018D4XQ,I  loved this anime. At first I wasn't so sure if I would. I  mean a talking motorcycle.  But I watched the first episode and was hooked. It touches on some deep subjects. But besides that. You get entranced in the show. After I watched the first episode I went ahead and download the rest of the season. I highly recommend this anime.,1462492800,,335,4.285714285714286

1976841,4,B00018D4XQ,The show has a very interesting style of narrative. It is very impressionistic and minimal; it's stories (that I've seen thus far) are much like a vignette. I look forward to watching more.,1453852800,,189,4.757575757575758

1976844,5,B00018D4XQ,Extremely...fascinating I think is the word I'd choose. Each episode is a sort of study-in-humanity. My only complaint is the total length and lack of real closure. Though I suppose the light novels it springs from are the solution to that.,1451001600,,240,4.878048780487805
1976845,4,B00018D4XQ,This is not your typical anime. This series of bite-sized and mostly unrelated stories follow a young girl and her sapient motorcycle on a journey visiting different countries and experiencing different cultures.  Each visit is an allegory for a particular socio-political topic.  The pacing is measured and is designed to make you think. I highly recommend this series.,1449792000,,370,5.362068965517241

1976847,3,B00018D4XQ,"This anime is pretty good. I like how it's really original and surprises around every turn. I'm not sure whether the English voice actor is bad or it's just Kino's character to be so monotone. The topics can be very thought provoking and the intro and outro are nice. The only thing that slightly haunts my nightmares are the [Music Playing] Sections every so often in one episode. The music that plays during that, is ..like that one song that you set as your alarm. You initially like it but then in a couple days it's just an alarm and every time you hear it even just on the radio or something you want to smash the radio apart because it means ""WAKE UP WAKE UP WAKE UP"" all in your ear. It'd be fine without the music during those little intermission parts. And I'm not sure what the deal is with the ""old tv"" filter on every episode is supposed to mean. It doesn't really bother me, but I'm just curious what it's supposed to mean. Also it kind of bothers me.

Probably what I like best about this anime is that the characters are smarter than I am, and it's thought provoking and very surprising!",1449100800,,1103,4.328502415458937
1976848,5,B00018D4XQ,Absolutely brilliant. The story is very surreal and one of a kind.,1448150400,,66,4.583333333333333

1976851,5,B00018D4XQ,"This is a great show. I'm almost finished with the first Season, the only season I could find, which is rather disappointing. I suppose it remains true that the Good Die Young. In any case, the show revolves around the sanyasi journey of Kino and her motorbike. Their relationship itself is a change of fate; as Kino, humanly in body, has the depth of a conscious boddhisatva while her motorrad, the inanimate object, seems to be the man-like voice of ego in her head that she must manage to fulfill her journey. At least that was my take. All in all this is a nice and peaceful show which has been great to me right before I fall asleep.",1447286400,,638,4.369747899159663
1976852,5,B00018D4XQ,This is one of my favorite series. It questions mans motives for doing what he does. The stories are vignettes of aspects of motivations and reactions and responses. The series is well drawn and the voices seem to fit the characters. This is a thinking persons series but there is still some real good action (gunplay).,1445558400,,319,4.714285714285714

1976854,5,B00018D4XQ,"Wow, just an awesome spiritual journey through Kino. This is about a sole traveler and a motorrad (talking motorbike) traveling from country to country while exploring each region's customers and idiosyncrasies. It's extremely profound and the only negative experience I had was it's too short at only 13 chapters long. There is no series 2. In fact, after wrapping up the series without so much as a cliffhanger, I was curious and wiki'd it. Apparently there's a mini cult following from Japan and this anime is based on a novel series with multiple editions. However, only one made the leap to TV. Good job nonetheless. I'm curious about the spin-offs, including movies and game materials now and might consider peeking at the US-English translated books. Shows that make you think, 5-stars, at least to this critic. Shows that numb the mind, not so much, so stay away if that's not your cup of tea. To each their own.",1444867200,,920,4.829113924050633

1976858,5,B00018D4XQ,"Kinos Journey conveys the emotions you feel on a long trip: wistfulness, pensiveness, uncertainty, melancholy, hope. Curiosity and dreaminess are added to the mix. The animation and design are very simple and childlike, though perhaps they fit the Buddhist sentiments. I rate this one up mostly on account of the strange stories, spirited vibe, and strong voice acting for the main character.",1443830400,,392,5.338709677419355

The episodic plot and tone feels a lot like Star trek tos. In that while the visuals and effects are poor, the story is thoughtful. Moreover  each episode, in star trek fashion involves an encounter with a new hypothetical society for the main characters to react to. A society that is like ours but with one weird aspect  that being said, like star trek the pacing is slow, and there isn't really any action so it's not for everyone.",1441843200,,562,4.3428571428571425

The main character manages to find beauty in a world full of senseless ugliness and painful societal mistakes.  The weirdly passive navigation of this story through the twists and turns of moral ambiguity gives it a sense of art and makes it worth watching.  Still, the pervasive darkness and the largely pessimistic view of humanity presented by the world in which this story takes place makes it the sort of place I am genuinely happy to leave, and I sincerely doubt I will ever watch this one again.",1438041600,,641,4.705357142857143

Seriously. In each episode someone will ask if they can ask a question about 5 times, and it gets really annoying. Maybe it has to do with a difficulty in translation, I don't know, but it sounds really bad. Nor do I like the casting of the english VO actor for Kino- she sounds way too old for the character. The series itself is rather plodding in pace, and somewhat depressing as tragedy is the theme of nearly every episode. The show is interesting in it's countries and characters, it's just not anything that special. A bit of a disappointment for me though I suspect I would have enjoyed it slightly more if it were available in Japanese with subtitles.",1432771200,,757,4.263888888888889

Now thats no reflection on the storyteller, it was me.  Everything you needed to know was perfectly laid out, but it took me some time to understand who and what Kino was.  Even after the episode of how Kino and Hermes first met, I still fought with the simple truth of what was going on.
So you know how at the end of something youve been struggling with comes together and that light bulb shines its brightest above your head?  Well thats what happened to me.  Again it wasn't that the story wasn't perfect, its just that I kept thinking, No, thats not who Kino is. Therefore, I kept getting hung up.
Now, for the reason I gave the story 5 stars.  Because it was really good, and the reason I felt I needed to write this review was because, its like when you find a good pizza place and you know others would like it if they only knew about it.
I know some might think its a bite slow, but to truly enjoy the life of a traveler, I think you have to take it slow.

1976897,4,B00018D4XQ,"I've watched a lot of anime in my day especially the deep story driven anime like Evangelion, Ghost in the Shell and Wolfs Rain and Kino's journey certainly deserves its place among these titles. It took me some time to get into it with a slow start and a deep philosophical story line. Kino is an interesting character and one that grew on me and I couldn't wait to see what happened too and her companion Hermes (the talking motorcycle) is an interesting idea that I think adds a certain steampunk element to the show. Kino's journey isn't the high action, things blowing up, kind of anime. It has many deep ideas and moral dilemmas woven into each story (represented by each country she visits) that made me think how I'd handle myself in that situation and if the way the people chose to live was right even though they'd had great results for them selves. I'll definerely be going back to this anime for years to come.  (As a parent this anime is pretty clean. No bad language That I recall, some violence but not gory, just a story driven philosophical anime for ages 12+)",1426636800,,1078,4.5

I enjoy bloody or gory Anime. I do love Dragon ball and Dragon Ball Z. Also I do enjoy Cowboy Bebop and neither are gory. Strong nudity in anime is a big turn off for me but I didn't notice any of that in Kino's Journey. Also it took me two or 3 episodes to figure out for sure what sex Kino even was.

1976922,5,B00018D4XQ,This story has put life into so many spot-on themes that I find it hard-pressed to not recommend the show,1401062400,,105,4.3
1976923,5,B00018D4XQ,"Full disclosure:  I was born during the Eisenhower administration, making me an anomaly as an anime fanboy.  My son got me into the genre through -- what else? -- Cowboy Bebop, then .hack//SIGN and others.  Not quite an otaku, I am on a constant search for interesting writing and beautiful imagery as an alternative to the manufactured crap that pervades broadcast television.

Enter Kino's Journey.  Wow.  Don't know quite what to say.  This modest, understated little series is kinda hard to quantify.  Some might find it boring.  I find it fascinating and full of possibilities.  It reminds me of the old ""traveler"" type series television from my childhood, where a hero would come into town and try to help those in need. But, no it's not quite that.  As noted by other reviewers, it's got a little bit of The Twilight Zone in it ... but no, it's not quite that, either.  Elements of the Little Prince?  Hmmm ... maybe.  An adventure story?  Definitely.  An exploration of humanity's frailty's and faults?  Yep.  A dream?  Maybe.

I dunno what it is, but I like it.

As to the specifics, you can read about them in the other excellent reviews. Love, death, war and peace, freedom and fate are all topics.  Heavy stuff for the original target audience (teens?) ... but not really.  What's that old adage, small minds talk about other people, average minds talk about events ... great minds talk about ideas.  This is as it should be.

The twelve year boy in me is interested in the scenario:  A young girl, trained and equipped to confront whatever life throws at her, riding a motorcycle across an amazing land filled with unique and distinct countries (more like city states) in search of adventure and answers.  With her large bore ""Persuader,"" the small bore ""Ranger"" ... knives stashed everywhere, she is nobody's victim, more the archetype ""competent man"" than adorable nymph.  Still, she is charming and witty and kind, when appropriate.

The old man in me loves the camaraderie and conversations.  Everywhere we follow there are odd and eccentric lifestyles and people, much like the world we live in.  Likewise, the discussions are varied and interesting.  Kino's unique companion adds to the story's humor:  the relationship between her and Hermes, the motorcycle (or ""motorrad"") reminds me of Harlan Ellison's A Boy and His Dog.  There's a scene where Kino is debating whether she should help some stranded travelers and says she would hope someone would do the same for her.  ""You mean it's like 'Vanity is not for the sake of others?'"" says Hermes.  Kino corrects him with ""You mean, Charity is not for the sake of others."" ""Yeah, that's what I said.""

Anywho, this precious thirteen episode collection is a treasure for the discerning viewer.  The writing is wonderful, with danger, suspense, deep questions and mystery.  My only complaint is that there are only thirteen episodes.  In my research I've found the original source material, a series of young adult novels titled Kino No Tabi - The Beautiful World.  A pleasant find, but still, it would be nice to see more on the big screen.

Like the old saying goes, ""It's better to have loved and lost than never loved at all.""  My disappointment is tempered with the fact that I've experienced a lovely and amazing little anime that is worth revisiting from time to time.

Enjoy!",1400371200,,3349,4.830687830687831
1976924,5,B00018D4XQ,"Kino's Journey is a series of stories about interesting people, places, and customs. Kino is an interloper, a unbiased traveler who spends a few days in each country she visit's. She is an able gunfighter who finds alternatives whenever she can. She travel's from country to country on her Motorad, a sentient 1930s' Brough Superior motorcycle.

In Kino's Journey, you are an observer. I feel that your enjoyment from the series is related to your ability to put what you observe together. If you are used to being baby-sat and being force-fed entertainment from a passive perspective, you might not like Kino's Journey, but if you can actively put into perspective what's happening, some of the stories will knock your socks off. (I say this as someone who has two books here on Amazon)

A vague spoiler follows: The series often feels tranquil, a little somber, sometimes dark, with just enough action to spice up the stories. As far as the stories, ""Land of Prophecies"" is one of the best Anime stories I have witnessed. ""Three Men Along the Rail"" is ironically delicious. Both ""Land of Adults"" and ""A Kind Land"" made me cry.",1400371200,,1128,4.809278350515464

1976928,5,B00018D4XQ,"I like Kino's Journey because it's a series of short stories.  Sometimes I find myself telling my friends, not about the anime, but the stories in the anime.  Kino's Journey is also a very quiet anime.  Although there is fighting in it; it is very peaceful. Because of the tone that is set, there's not a lot of sudden noises or loud music.  The main character, Kino, visits each country for a maximum of three days and observes the particular country's culture objectively.  Kino never gets ""involved.""

The talking motorad, Hermes, was the only thing that was a little off to me at first.  After the second episode, however, I really enjoyed the relationship between Kino and Hermes.  Hermes seems to fill the void that Kino's rather monotone personality leaves the audience wondering about.

I'd recommend this anime for anyone that likes to hear new, interesting, short stories with a twist, or that leave you thinking and wanting to to talk about.",1398211200,,952,4.827160493827161

1976942,4,B00018D4XQ,"I started to look for something new after completing Get Backers and Kino's Journey, for some odd reason, caught my eye. The premise behind the show is simple: Kino travels from city to city, country to country, and only stays three days each. What makes the show so fascinating is that each city/country/stop (whatever you want to call it) has its own unique view on life and what makes it worth living. Opposing themes are juxtaposed against each other in such an odd fashion that shouldn't work yet somehow do: Slavers who steal life yet want to live, a country in mourning, the freedom to work/live as one would want, fighting (literally) to be an upperclass person and so forth.

Each episode is self contained and previous knowledge isn't necessary.

But let's talk about Kino for a little bit. At first glance, one would assume that Kino is a young man. In reality, Kino is a young woman around the age of 15 or so and seems wise beyond her years as if she has seen the majority of it before (very little seems to phase her). She prefers to be recognized as a male and can sharp shoot better than most individuals. Her main flaw is that she second guesses her self when faced with difficult moral decisions. While it isn't in the foreground, I feel it helps make her a believable character and grounds her in the series.

Those looking for heavy action will be dissappointed. The narrative of the show is mostly on Kino and her experiences. While each episode is rather quick (it lasts less than 30 minutes), there is enough going on to leave someone to think about the themes of the episode. And then there's the appeal of the show: the tone tends to be quite serious and may not appeal to those looking for something to unwind to at the end of the day. This show is about digesting the themes of each episode and understanding where we fit with the values presented.",1386547200,,1875,4.508823529411765

She encounters cannibalism, evil, war, kindness. She's not above killing, if she feels the need for it. This isn't the kind of story I could sit and watch episode after episode; I needed some kind of light, palate-cleansing distractions in between, which is why I like it, but I probably wouldn't buy it.

good artwork and great storys.  Before I go I must say that I'm disappionted in how anime has changed over the years to play
 on hormore releasing teens, it just seems that there are countless numbers of rediculous animes out there that depend on sex

1976971,2,B00018D4XQ,"I'll be honest guys, I am new to ""slice of life"" type animes so this may be a bit more bias then most of the other reviews. Most of the 15-20 animes I have seen have been all in the same sort of genre (Gun X Sword, Claymore, Inuyasha, FMA, Outlaw Star, Trigun, Count of Monte Cristo, Gun Grave etc.) I will spare you from long details of how this anime goes. Safe to say it is a cool story that follows Kino around on her many journies to roughly 13 different places. The places are all extremely different and you rarely have the same thing happen.

The art work, music and plot are really good with one major flaw, no action and sad. I will not mention any spoliers but around 1/2 of the episodes end on a negative spin and some are just downright heartbreaking. To top it all off Kino seems to never want to get involved, this is part of the story as to why she is how she is. But it really leaves a ton to be desired, no fighting for what is right, no action, sad...it was a bit to much for me in terms of being so different. On top of all this it is slow but intresting, you don't find yourself chomping at the bit to see another episode. You sort of look at it as a well thought out anime that is intresting to watch. The series ends at 13 episodes so it is an easy watch, however don't expect a crazy good ending. Either it was cut off mid season without the writers knowing, or they planned to just have it end like every other episode which is uneventful. I didn't feel like I wasted my time, but I ended with a ""meh"" thought when processing it. No action, sad story, nothing to cheer for, but instresting and always different. 2 Stars does seem to harsh but 3 was to high so I will rate 2.5 stars C-.",1360108800,,1710,4.059171597633136

One thing that other reviews have hinted on, and I have to reiterate, this is a thinking person's anime.  The topics in the stories explore humanity in all it's beauty and hideousness.  Certainly one that is worth watching, and in my opinion worth owning.",1358553600,,545,4.474747474747475

Becoming captivated by each episode, you want to see where she will visit next, and who she will meet.  Some will cause you to come angry, others will cause to to become sad, or happy.  Each one will give you so many emotions.  I wasn't expecting to see many of the episodes, but the first one turned into a second, a third, a fourth, and so on.  I couldn't stop my self from watching the series.

Everyone will love this anime, as it touches you deeply, and is unexpected.

In one of the episodes, it shows how Kino became who she is now, and how she became the way she did.  In that episode, you learn that her name was that of a flower however, she had forgotten her own name.

1976974,5,B00018D4XQ,"The mysterious stranger coming to town is a trope that has been around for eons. Clint Eastwood's spaghetti westerns of the 1960's are a perfect example. The mysterious stranger comes to town, and nothing's the same again.

Kino is the mysterious stranger here, though she rarely changes the towns she enters. Kino travels from town to town on her talking motorcycle, Hermes, experiencing the different civilizations on her world. She stays three days and two nights, then leaves.  Kino is a mystery, even her gender is a mystery for the first few episodes. She doesn't act like a stereotypical boy, or a stereotypical girl, she's Kino, as she reminds people who call her ""little boy"" or ""little girl"" (she's around 15 in the books, and presumably around the same age here, but she's a small person regardless of her age). We're told something of her background, of how she fled her home town when another mysterious stranger gave his life for her, of how she was trained in martial arts and weapons by a mysterious figure known only as ""Master"", but Kino is an enigma. Why is she traveling? What does she hope to accomplish? Where is she going? We're never told, though we can guess reasons why she may be traveling based on clues in the series.

Kino is a bad-ass but not showy about it. She is a crack shot and also a collector of knives and to a certain extent embodies the ""small girl, big gun"" trope but rarely shoots except when absolutely necessary for survival, and most episodes never pulls her guns except to practice in the mirror or to clean them in her hotel room. She can be kind, she helps several people that she encounters in her travels, but she is also a dispassionate observer who rarely tries to intervene in anything big. Sometimes she does intervene, but her interventions are typically small -- there is none of the pyrotechnics of something like Eastwood's ""High Plains Drifter"" for the most part. Even the most action-filled episodes where she kills someone (there are three episodes out of thirteen where she kills someone), the killing is a shock simply because it is so out of the norm for this series.

The result is oddly touching. Kino can take care of herself, she is tough and resilient, but you want to give her a hug from time to time when she encounters things that are disturbing. Kino rarely displays any outward emotion when encountering disturbing things, and makes only occasional objections when she runs across true atrocities, but you the viewer are more likely to be disturbed than Kino. She accepts the world as it is, not as she may wish it to be, with a stoicism devoid of cynicism, and somehow that makes this series even more disturbing. You wonder how she was hurt to make her like that.

Definitely not easy viewing, it's a psychological series rather than an action series (there are some scenes of shocking violence, but they are few and far between, which is perhaps why they seem so shocking despite being tame by modern-day standards) and intended more to make you think and feel than as mindless entertainment. There's no fan service here and no big fighting robots or anything like that. No real plot -- for the most part Kino travels to a country, interacts with the citizens, learns disturbing things, moves on. No easy answers either -- each episode will raise questions, but you'll have to provide answers yourself. If there are any. Still, if you're in the right mindset, definitely a rewarding series to watch, and will leave you wanting more -- more backstory, more opportunities for growth on the part of Kino (note that the episodes are *not* in chronological order though they are in the correct order for the purposes of the original author), more of watching Kino interact with the world and trying to make sense of it, and maybe Kino eventually being able to answer for herself why she is travelling and what she hopes to accomplish. Alas, there's unlikely to ever be more. Oh well.",1354579200,,3956,4.710982658959537

A strange ritual, I know. Anyways, after picking up Kino's Journey once a while back, this tradition changed into franticly searching for more Kino dvds.

Kino's Journey is not like any other anime I've seen, which is quite refreshing. Each episode tells the story of a different fictional country, many of which deal with very deep subjects. It's a thinking man's anime, with twists and turns that'll make your brain commit suicide. Often times you'll find yourself screaming ""What the Hell!?!"" at your t.v. screen when the catch (and every country, has one) is revealed. This is especially true in the latter episodes.

This is a VERY laid back & slow paced anime with little action & no romance, but it's AWESOME. This is a relax-time anime that gives you the same squishy feeling as reading a book you're really into.

The only humor in the series is ""is Kino a boy or a girl/short woman?"" It took me almost 10 episodes to find out it was a tomboy. I should also mention that this anime is very well dubbed. I haven't finished the series yet, but I don't really want it to end!",1099958400,,562,4.017857142857143
1976980,5,B00018D4XQ,"""Kino's Journey"" is a fascinating, introspective show with a quality all its own.  The show as a whole spans four DVDs and has no plot; Kino just travels around, visiting one country or another and interacting with whoever lives there.  Sometimes Kino gets into trouble, and sometimes just watches.  The various lands have nothing in common except a vaguely fairytale European quality, and like the best fairy tales, these stories don't shy away from grim brutality -- as well as an 'existential' quality which some may find amoral or unsettling.  But through it all, Kino survives and heads on for the next land, the next adventure. For those who like their anime thoughtful, I don't see how this could be better.  I didn't notice the ""lines"" that some found distracting.  The backgrounds, skies and details are rendered in a watercolor style well suited to the stories' general mood. A fine show, well worth watching more than once.",1089936000,,934,4.917197452229299
1976981,4,B00018D4XQ,"Kino is a young girl who travels through different countries, never staying for longer than 3 days, because she is afraid that if she stays longer, she might settle down. Her only companion is her motorcycle, Hermes. Hermes has sentience and can speak to Kino and other people. Each episode is a different adventure as she encounters people of all types and countries, each with their own customs and problems.
This dvd has the first four episodes of Kino's Journey.
In ""Land of Visible Pain"", Kino and Hermes come upon a city that has no visible human inhabitants, only robots who wait on their every need. Where did all the people go? They will find out soon enough. The second episode is about Kino helping out 3 truckdrivers whose vehicle has become trapped in a blizzard and are starving to death. ""Land of Prophecies"", the 3rd episode concerns a country where the people believe that the next morning after Kino arrives will be the last day before the earth ends. In the last episode, we learn a little more about Kino in a flashback to her childhood in which we learn the origins of her wanderings and how she came to meet up with Hermes.
This was a great dvd and should appeal to those anime watchers who like a lot of story instead of giant robots fighting each other. It almost seems like a book, and actually, this anime is based on a series of books published in Japan. It is pretty hardhitting and philisophical and should appeal more to adults than to kids. There are scenes of some graphic violence, such as a man getting shot in the head and a stabbing. Great dvd.
No real extras except clean closings/openings, production sketches.",1089072000,,1648,4.608843537414966
1976982,5,B00018D4XQ,"There's something to be said for the use of quiet as a story-telling device.
I did not know what to expect when I first sat down to watch Kino's Journey, but I was quickly captivated by this series.
Kino is an impartial witness, traveling from one land to the next. Her constant companion is Hermes, a talking motorbike with a sarcastic bent.
Together, they explore various social situations, and their potential consequences. Is knowing the thoughts of those around you a blessing or a curse? Is it right to live at the expense of another? What are the consequences of prophecy? Can a society truly divest itself of all its traditions? What does it mean to be a reasonable adult?
We aren't always given answers to our questions, either. Kino is not a judge. She neither condones nor condemns those around her.
In the second episode, we do see Kino fight against a group of slave traders, but this is only after they threaten Kino's own life.
Despite some moments of graphic violence, this is a series that I would seriously consider sharing with children about ten or older.
Oft times thoughtful, it is the quiet moments when we see that which is truly beautiful in the world.
My sole complaint is that Kino's identity as a girl was supposed to be a surprise in the fourth episode, but the ADV english translation reveals it a bit early.
The art style is intruigingly complex and simplistic at the same time, with vivid detail for the backgrounds and mechanical devices, but with remarkably plain character designs. The colors use a great deal of earth tones, and it is nowhere as brightly colored as some anime. The musical score is both vivid and haunting. The voice cast for both Japanese and English dialogue are superb.
Personally, I wouldn't mind seeing a few more like this one.",1086220800,,1786,4.691082802547771
1976983,5,B00018D4XQ,"KIno's Journey is subtle and thought provoking, and it grows on you slowly. In my mind, it was somewhat reminiscent of earlier Miyazaki films, a la Totoro, for instance. The same dreamy, idle pace is the mood for these first four episodes, but each one has a slight twist to it, and a darker insight into the aspects of human nature.
Both the Japanese and the English language tracks have something to offer. Kino sounds more feminine in Japanese, but Hermes, the motorcycle, has a more ""machine-esque"" voice in English.
The graphics are well done and soothing, with intricate backgrounds to make up for the somewhat basic characters. Each country has it's own individual look, which is an asset in this easy-paced anime.
Kino's Journey is the anime zen. I love it, and I think that most people will too, unless you only crave action packed shoot em up, blood and gore flicks. (which have their own assests..) This is much more psychological. Highly reccomended.",1079308800,,962,4.836363636363636
1976984,5,B00018D4XQ,"I thought that anime was cool when I first saw it back in the mid-80's.  It had anything a twentyish guy likes:  pretty girls, monsters, spaceships, giant robots...
But that's not the COMPLETE description of what anime is.
I love Kino's Journey.  So much of anime is misunderstood and misunderstood by the American audience, but this one (volume one, Idle Adventurer) speaks to anyone with a clear and philosophical voice that gives the viewer an insight into a dark and mysterious world that seems to be mostly just around the corner.
One small criticism:  Kino's gender is left ambiguous (deliberately?) through most of volume 1.  If he's a guy, why would a guy want to marry him (episode 1, ""Land of Visible Pain"")?  But if she's females, why would she dress like a man, practice using guns and knives, and (most atypically for female anime characters) have a mid-to-low masculine voice?
Because it doesn't matter.
See this one-- you won't regret it.",1078790400,,953,4.851851851851852
1976985,5,B00018D4XQ,"Kino's Journey starts off with a simple premise - a young traveler visiting the countries of the world, staying no more than three days. And quickly evolves in to a more reveling look at human nature through the eyes of the traveler. The countries quickly become a back drop for the deeper meaning of the episode. Using the current surroundings and dialog the between the main character and the motorrad Hermes the viewer is invited to take a deeper look at the world around them. This anime is highly recommended for anyone seeking a more deeply rooted anime that leads to philosophical thought and discussion. However, it is best noted that the DVD carries a suggested age rating of 15+ due to some disturbing moments in episode 2 ""A Tale of Feeding Off Others"" and episode 4 ""Land of Adults"".",1078531200,,795,4.685714285714286
1976986,5,B00018D4XQ,"I have a slight warning to be prepared before you start watching Kino's journey.  In doing some checking to make sure it wasn't just my DVD, I found that the lines that are found throughout the anime were done intentionally and are not a defect.  Like watching a movie in widescreen, this might bother some people and they might not be able to deal with it.  For myself, I prefer widescreen and stopped noticing the lines through the video after the first few minutes.
As for the series itself, I have to say it's something of a marvel.  Kino and Hermes, Kino's motorrad (a talking motorcycle) travel the world, visiting no country for more than three days.  As Kino observes, it's enough time to get a feel for the region and then it's time to go because staying for more than three days means less time that he can stay in another country.  Kino is also truthful enough to also admit that this reasoning may be a lie and that he's just afraid of liking a region too much and setting down roots, which would mean he would no longer be a traveller.
Kino and Hermes spend a lot of time talking to one another, having philosophical discussions as they travel, about the places they're going to and what meets them when they get there.  Each country they travel through has their own set of laws and government and those who travel through them are not supposed to do anything to disturb their customs.  This manages to give us an interesting look at the world and see how things work and don't work.
The first country Kino visits seems devoid of humanity, with machines performing all the roles that humans usually fulfill.  Kino is greeted by a machine as he enters the town, is served food by machines and is even given a room by one.  It's not until later that Kino notices there are people living nearby, but they are all alone and far spread out, with no one living with anyone else.  It's as Kino is leaving that he finally speaks with someone and finds out why the town is like that and how their hope for a Utopian society had led to their downfall and isolation.
In the second episode, Kino doesn't actually visit a town but instead finds three men who are stuck in the snow and are near the point of starvation.  Kino stops to help them but even then questions his own motives in doing so, as he feels no paricular regard for them.  It's these ruminations that Kino and Hermes have throughout this episode that really intersted me.
In the third episode, Kino visits several towns, with several of the stories about the towns overlapping.  It's done in an interesting style, the way these stories weave together, without the point being hammered into your head.  I enjoyed the flow, especially with the first country, where the end of the world is being predicted the following day, so everyone gives Kino what he is shopping for for free.
I can't say much for the final episode because I wouldn't want to spoil anything for someone on their first viewing of it.  There is a twist here, which is about all I can safely say without giving it away.  Depending on whether you watch the anime in English or Japanese will also give you some clues as to what's going on.  I think the English version gave away some hints too early on, but maybe that's just me.  All in all, I recommend this show for anyone who likes to think.  It isn't all out action for those that just like fighting animes, but for those who like their anime to challenge their intellect a bit, I can highly recommend this show.",1077840000,,3499,4.463108320251178
1976987,5,B00018D4XQ,"Originating as a series of novels, Kino's Journey is the story of Kino, a young wanderer and Hermes, the intelligent, somewhat sarcastic motorrad (motorcycle) that serves as vehicle and companion.  Kino travels are less adventures than they are philosophical moments that dig away as the thin veneer of the superficial that is the casual traveler's fare.

Limiting each leg of the journey to three days, Kino and Hermes seek to find a momentary vision that reveals the heart of each country, often in uncomfortable terms.  The first episode, for instance turns into a reflection on the tragedy of a world where telepathy works, i.e., where nothing is secret.  Where the very thing that should bring people together makes any closeness impossible.

From a technical standpoint, the artwork is graceful and understated.  It acts as a setting for the frequent interplays of thought that Hermes and Kino share.  This is the most onusual of conversations, moving from Kino's desire for food and Hermes' frequent worrying to sudden remarkable turns of phrase.  Director Ryutaro Nakamura (best known for his work on Serial Experiments Lain) strives for a impact and affect as he works toward a different form of aesthetic experience.  ""The world is not beautiful, and therefore it is.""

Like Lain, Kino's Journey is a thinking person's type of anime.  The action often turns around intellectual reflections rather than external crises.  Objects frequently have unexpected symbolic contexts.  As such it will have a smaller but more dedicated audience than it's more active cousins.  If you like to be intrigued rather than blown away, you will find Kino's Journey most rewarding.",1076976000,,1672,5.190298507462686
1976988,5,B00018D4XQ,"Kino (whose sex in ambiguous, for a reason) is off on a journey...you will find out why soon enough, so don't ask until you get to that episode or it will ruin a lot for you. He/She has a talking motorcycle named Hermes. basically, thats all the plot I can tell you without ruining a lot.
In this anime Kino encounters a new world (contained within a new town) each episode. The viewer sees these towns and must take in each of their problems and decide what that problem means...there is war, loss, betrayal, cannibalism, mythical religion, the end of the world...within Kino's journey.
This anime reminds me a lot of Lain and the like..where all the questions are not answered, but that it becuase, in life, these kinds of questions aren't answered at all, either. I loved this anime, its about time a good ""thinking"" anime came out. Kino is it!",1076544000,,847,4.578947368421052

Its about a young man who is out on a journey, and he comes across a town that seems abandonded except for these robot workers there. He soon finds out that there are people living there, but they are all alone. As he leaves the town, he discovers that they all have telepathy, and are scared of each other because they know what each other is thinking.
