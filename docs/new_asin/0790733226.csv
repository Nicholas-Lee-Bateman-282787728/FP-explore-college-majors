92858,5,0790733226,"This is an excellent example of what the DVD format can offer film fanatics. ""Contact"" was one of the most visually impressive movies of 1997, though it may yield to ""Titanic"" in its visual effects. The DVD presentation includes three feature-length commentary tracks, in addition to appendices on the various specific scenes.
 Common to Robert Zemeckis' ""Forrest Gump,"" the film has the enticing/distracting presence of various television personalities including the morphed/edited/stood in for President Bill Clinton. ""Contact"" is not hurt by its leads: the driven, believable Jody Foster, or the moral cowboy/guru Matthew McConaughey. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
 Here's hoping ""Titanic"" gets the the same special presentation when it comes to DVD.  END",891820800,,753,5.646017699115045

It feels weird to be giving it one less star than many did, since I really did like the movie, but more in the 7.5 out of 10 scale, not 8 or 9.  The acting was excellent as was the story.  I don't think it provided any Insight into faith vs science, but to do so would in my view be ""above the pay grade""  of human beings, so i certainly don't give it any demerits on that score.  It did have good human drama.  I though Jodie Foster and James Woods did an excellent job, Mcconnaughey was pretty good too, but for someone portrayed as a philosopher of sorts he didn't seem to have anything profound to say.",1517616000,,656,4.125984251968504

92939,5,0790733226,"When people talk about how the book is better than the movie, I almost always agree. Here's the one instance in which I don't. As much as I loved Carl Sagan's books, and admire his life's work of getting science the respect it deserves, I like the film better here. First, the book and film diverge markedly. Taking a novel of that complexity and scope and realistically folding it into a watchable, marketable film would be impossible. So of course the movie has to make some hard choices. And I like them. Having just one character make the journey in the Machine worked for the film, whereas the concept of an entire group, as happens in the book, would be hard to portray cinematically with any quality.

Back in college, a girlfriend of mine told me she had seen the movie and did not care for it at all. It threatened her faith. Fair enough. I wouldn't have expected many students at my Southern Baptist college to appreciate Carl Sagan. Few certainly would have approved of any plot that features an atheist as the protagonist. But at its heart, the movie is about finding the truthno matter how painful it is or how much it shatters our preconceived notions of ourselves or the universe we live in.

Even now, whenever this movie comes on cable, I stop what I'm doing to watch it. Jodie Foster performed brilliantly, and whenever I go back to read the book, I picture her as Ellie Arroway.",1514592000,,1397,4.5396825396825395

But there are true and real science concepts and theories that are on display in a beautifully filmed movie with stellar (pun intended) performances by Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey. This is a story of exploring the question of - Are we alone in the universe? And if we are not, what will it look like to find that out? Who will be the individuasl tasked with exploring that idea and finding evidence, and what effect will it have on them and all of mankind? Sci-fi fans will love to geek out on the science side of the use of radio astronomy, wormholes, and star systems. Fans of well told stories that make you think will hit pause to really soak in the depth and breadth of the concepts and character connections in Contact. Watch it.

92945,5,0790733226,This is a very fine science fiction movie released in 1997.  The movie is based on a novel by Carl Sagan.  Jodie Foster stars in the movie and she is excellent.  The movie is about the possibility of life elsewhere than earth.  It includes related questions about a Supreme Being.  I found the movie to be a really enjoyable movie experience.  The movie has caused me to obtain the novel by Carl Sagan.  Thank You...,1511740800,,416,4.466666666666667
92946,5,0790733226,"One of my favorite movies of all time. Jodie Foster is compelling and believable. Matthew McConaughey is a bit...annoying. John Hurt is deliciously mischievous. ""Contact"" mixes science and religion/spirituality like few other movies have. Rather, it sees the original inseparability of those disciplines more clearly than most other movies. Its moments of beauty--of the physical realm, the personal connection between people, and the Mystery before us--are nothing short of ineffable.",1511654400,2,485,5.942857142857143

92966,1,0790733226,"The worst of the 90s. Did we really like this crap at the time? From the sappy music, the weepy-eyed emoting, onion-skin thin caricatures, to the lazy writing. The special effects are good for the time, but the writing is atrocious. These writers should be jailed. The acting is barely more substantive. And this include Matthew McConaughey at his most smirky, mumbly, annoying smuggiest. What the hell even was his character? And Bill Clinton should have been impeached for lending his face, voice, and office to this atrocity (I understand these were clips from other new events spliced in without prior authorization, but still, at least send the CIA in to terminate this garbage with extreme prejudice.) I like all of these actors generally, but this film defiles them.

Just consider the storyline. A super-advanced alien civilization sends out a message that contains code for building a, what, teleportation machine? mind meld? --that whisks our hero away at either superliminal speeds or through hyper-gravitational fields and experiences something like an hour's worth of a new planet or who knows what, yet on earth appeared to be gone but a second. That is precisely the opposite of what would happen (see Interstellar). Or maybe they just visited her in her mind, avoiding all the problems of physics. Or what? Ah, that is a technicality that we can ignore for the greater good of some emoting. And these supergeniuses go through all that effort to provide a single individual an experience that she cannot explain to anyone back home, or use to do anything other than keep listening for more signals. How about giving her something to take back? Like a picture? a book? some knowledge? ""Baby steps, blahblah""  I wanted to pull my eyes out and throw them at the screen. This script must have been written by a defective AI program or a collection of prisoners seeking vengeance on their keepers. Or maybe this is what a thousand monkeys on a thousand typewriters eventually produce before they get to shakespeare. But at that point they should have been shot. Maybe this is what killed Carl Sagan. I can't believe this is what he would have wanted, but I am not about to read his book for fear I might be wrong and have to experience this war-thought-crime again.

Watch Arrival instead, which at least evidences a thinking process. Which is what I tried to get but forget the title and got stuck with this garbage instead. I hate me.",1504396800,,2446,4.832935560859188

92993,4,0790733226,"Probably would come across as a bit slow and plodding to younger contemporary audiences given today's trend of ever-increasingly rapid frame changes and pace. Perhaps even a bit old fashioned and hokey, given the modern trend of making everything ""gritty"" and dark. Had never seen the film, but was blown away by Interstellar and read comparisons of the two films and their similarities (this is a much lighter-hearted film, for those keeping score).  Obviously the tech and special effects are a bit dated (Bill Clinton, anyone?), although I'm sure people marveled at the film's final sequence at the time in theaters, etc.

That said, it's a very friendly, relaxed, approachable, light sci-fi film. Very kid/family friendly. Well acted, James Woods killing it as a shady government type. Scenic footage is phenomenal and appropriately gives the film a very large feel.

- if the digital recorder only caught 18 hours of static , why don't they use a film camera - something not electrical, next time they send someone? After all the machine in Japan is still intact. Another idea is to send explorers with pencils and notebooks to record what they see. When the pod is captured after the drop, the camera and notebooks should be full of information.  Just logic.

93017,2,0790733226,"2 1/2 stars.  Not a terrible movie, but one that could have been a lot better if it was more focused and shorter.  The main story is good, and when Jodie does make the ""contact"", that scene is very good and quite beautiful, reminiscent of great sci-fi like Close Encounters.  But the film is so immersed in politics, celebrity cameos, and religion bashing that any good scenes are quickly undermined.  The religion aspects are inserted so arbitrarily they should have had a subtitle saying ""anti-religion preaching coming up"".  Characters in the movie just start talking about God without any rhyme or reason, and the ones who do believe in God are portrayed as crackpots.  There's a scene where a creepy as hell religious nut (played by Jake Busey) blows up one of the space modules designed to make the ""contact"".  Of course, there's no explanation how this religious nut managed to breach security, or why he wanted to destroy the module, other than he's a religious nut.  The film is surprisingly dated, as the makers of this movie must have cut a deal with CNN because practically every news anchor who worked there in 1997 has a cameo in the movie (including Bill Clinton's former press secretary, Dee Dee Myers).  And Zemeckis keeps cutting to CNN's coverage of what's going on, and I have no idea why he thought that was an interesting subplot.  Plus many on the space team keep watching CNN as if the network's opinion of their work is the most important thing.  The CNN footage must take up at least a half hour of the movie, which is ridiculous.  The film is supposed to be about contacting life in outer space, not how awesome CNN is.  Plus Bill Clinton himself appear in the movie.  His cameo completely takes you out of the movie, and it's distracting.  They could have easily cast anyone as the president.  The producers thought they were being clever.

Despite a very good cast, the acting has a tendency to be wooden and/or over the top. Only John Hurt gives a subtle performance.  Contact has good ideas, but this film is very disappointing.  It does move at a decent clip, despite being overlong, so it's never boring,  If you want to see a film that's a better take on intergalatic travel (and no cameos by former presidents or news anchors), watch Interstellar (also with McConaughey).",1499990400,,2306,4.689054726368159
93018,5,0790733226,"I feel the reason 95% of viewers are uncomfortable with this movie is that they assume science is incompatible with a belief in God. What? Like the creator of heaven and earth isn't the ultimate scientist? What's wrong with you people? Every tree, every starfish, the shark, the sapphires under the crust of the earth are the culmination of billions of years of scientific knowledge. That's"" who I am"" is, to coin a phrase,  What I do understand about scientists, is that they have had to put aside the fear of the overwhelming Presence in order to study it.  It seems logical to me that a loving God would want his creation studied, not idolized, not put on a pedestal, not worshipped, but studied. It has always been my belief that when they run into the Creator, a scientist will have something interesting to say to God. Possibly something he hasn't heard from a bunch of bowing and fawning ""forgive us our sins"" types. How do we know that isn't exactly what he wanted out of these last couple of centuries? Some decent conversation, about the nature of molecules and how atoms dance and how the hind legs of grasshoppers hinge to get the most spring out of a hop. Eh?",1499817600,2,1172,4.549763033175355

Then she transforms to an idiotic emotional monkey. It unnerves me that a scientist would be this cynical and yet not believe in a higher being.

Jodie Foster brings her folksy hyper acting presence into the character of a PhD that turned away from teaching at Harvard to listen for sounds from the stars living on grant money.  Matthew McConaughey's smooth homeboy God-grounded writer pops in everywhere from the jungles of Puerto Rico to the hallowed halls of US Congress and most any TV channel.  Tom Skerritt is his usual stilted self almost reading his dialogue but pulls the despicable boss act right out of himself.  William Fichtner is in rare form as a shut-out fellow scientist.  He does a particularly good job with a particularly manufactured character.  James Woods is absolutely convincing as James Woods.  Most everyone else in this star studded film is very good with the bit parts and walk-ons.  There are some big names with little parts sprinkled carefully and often enough to keep one watching just to see who turns up next.
The story, even written by one of the grandest cosmic minds that ever walked this planet, is trite and predictable for the most part.  That surprised me.  His personal understanding of the universe would lead me to believe the story would be at his level of understanding.  Most of us would not have understood a thing, but it would have been a fabulous excursion through his brain.  The effects are good but not noteworthy.  The message is uninspired: we are not alone.  But yet no one is as alone as the protagonist in the hot seat before a congressional committee as she wracks her consciousness for any sign of any shred of any evidence what happened to her was real.  And guess who pops into the gallery..
This is an almost love story, an almost time travel story, and an almost justification story.  In the end, even though the interstellar message from Vega was 'you are not alone', she found herself alone when she needed validation, alone in her struggle to claim her discovery, alone in asserting her qualifications for launch, alone in her capsule, alone right back where she started, and finally, alone on the edge of a canyon with nothing left but her memory of a trip she may have never taken.
This film is thought probing, in spite of itself, to those that can think on an interstellar level, and the social injustices will be all too common to those whose thoughts don't stray far from planet Earth.

The idea that's emphasized that religion and science can coexist is rather interesting. Personally I enjoyed the big twist at the VERY end and every bit up until that point you feel every thought and question you have, have some fulfillment that leaves you satisfied. For those who want an interesting insight on aliens without the stereotypical invasion of Earth or little green men, this is what you want to see as it takes a more rational approach to what a first contact might actually be. For those who also have seen Interstellar, you may also enjoy seeing Mathew again in addition another suspenseful feel in this movie akin to that of Interstellar.",1497744000,,824,4.769230769230769

This movie confronts the prejudice and mindless beliefs that we have been given over the last 70 years, since the enacting of the law that enabled truth to be buried under the guise of protecting national security in 1947.

93063,5,0790733226,"Contact is a 1997 science fiction drama, which is a film adaptation of the 1985 novel by the same name that was written by Carl Sagan. The story line of Contact centers around a brilliant young radio astronomer, who discovers the transmission of a repeating sequence of prime numbers from a distant star system named Vega. Embedded in this transmission are the three-dimensional schematics for constructing a technologically advanced vehicle designed for the interstellar transport of a single occupant from earth to Vega. The main character eventually makes this trip and returns, but her account of the experience is dismissed by all of the experts, due to a discrepancy in the elapsed time of her journey, which she is not able to adequately explain. Contact features a stellar ensemble cast, including such luminaries as Jodie Foster, Matthew McConaughey, David Morse, Tom Skerritt, James Woods, Max Martini, William Fichtner, John Hurt, Jake Busey, Rob Lowe, and Angela Bassett, to name a few. The writing, plot development, acting performances, and special effects in this film are all outstanding. Contact is an absolutely wonderful film, which is extremely engaging and entertaining, as well as decidedly uplifting and inspiring, and it certainly merits a five-star rating, along with a very enthusiastic recommendation.",1497398400,6,1328,5.389423076923077

93102,5,0790733226,"Contact is one of those movies I watch every year or so. At 20 years since release it's starting to seem a little dated in places but overall I think it holds up very well.

There aren't many more compelling questions than ""are we alone in the universe?"" and that's the subject of Contact. There have been lots of movies and television series that that take the ""first contact"" theme. Perhaps it resonates so well because it has so many parallels to the time when many times people would meet other people with seemingly magical technology. Trying to not give too much away, I think that's the role of the infamous ""machine"".

Jody Foster is fabulous as Eleanor Arroway and Matthew McConaughey, William Fichtner and Tom Skerritt all have notable performances. A small but critical role is S.R. Hadden played by John Hurt. The well selected cast of film veterans deliver a performance that holds together very well.

One of the the things that I particularly enjoy are the scenes at the Very Large Array (VLA) near Socorro, New Mexico where I spent a memorable week working on their computer systems in the early 1980's. I can understand why it shows up in TV and Movies (2010 A Space Odyssey, for example). It is a place and purpose that captures my imagination. The measurement of signal strength during these scenes refers to Janksys which related to the full name of the VLA: Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array and obviously the source of the measurement.

At the end of the movie I am always touched by the dedication ""For Carl"" which is clearly Carl Sagan, a movie co-producer and author of the book that is the basis for the movies. Sadly he died in 1996; the year before the release of the movie. In the movie the Sagan quote ""it would be a terrible waste of space"" is often repeated.

The story itself is well made. Good pacing and tempo keep things moving along. Production values are pretty good and good use of stock footage of then President Clinton where appropriate for the flow of the movie. It's not a bug-eyed-aliens movie, it's more conceptual and cerebral in nature but I think it does a good job bringing the less geeky viewer along with just a plain good story with all the essential elements.

Not a lot of movies get me to watch them more than once or twice, but this one does. I think by this point it should be obvious that I am a fan of the movies and I'm giving it 5 stars. If you have managed not to see Contact, give it a try and allow a little for the 20 years since its first release. I think you may be glad you did.",1495756800,15,2545,4.427350427350428
93103,5,0790733226,"Faith is the overarching theme throughout the movie. I myself believe it did an exceptional job of showing how one skeptic and non-believer learned the importance of faith.  The fact is, that even among the religious, skepticism/denial of the beliefs of other people is a very real thing. When Elle was presented with a non-quantifiable event she finally learned the importance of faith. I am not a religious person but I must say that this movie touched an empathetic nerve and for a moment allowed me to understand a little better how someone could be religious.

So for the people calling this an attack on faith please try and remember certain tenants of your respective faiths. Everyone is different. A movie is an opportunity to flex your empathetic muscle and walk in someone else's shoes. If you were on the same journey as I was then you must have felt a little excitement in Elle's discovery of belief! Or maybe you are not as tolerant to the beliefs of others as you would have the congregation believe every Sunday.",1495584000,,1027,4.731843575418995

The force behind this story was Dr. Carl Sagan, perhaps the most insightful and significant astro-physicist ever. One of his most famous quotes applies to this film and our quest to know... ""Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.""

[I once met Dr. Sagan on a plane, late in the evening, back in 1979 or 1980. There were few people on the TWA flight I took from Kansas City to Dayton, but he was already on the plane. After I noticed him, he glanced up and it struck me who he was. I greeted him and asked if he was Dr Sagan. He answered that he was and since there was no one else boarding the plane, we spoke for a few minutes. He had a lot of papers strewn over the seats next to him and he had been quite busy working. I thanked him for the conversation and begged him to return to his work as I sat down two rows behind him. We shook hands and bid each other well. When I departed the plane in Dayton, he glanced up, smiled and mentioned it was nice meeting me. I was taken aback, smiled back and that it was a pleasure meeting him.]",1495497600,3,1923,4.474285714285714

We see in this film, some of the reasons why Foster is often regarded as one of the most gifted actors of her generation.  Her intelligence, presence and emotional range in this story are truly exceptional.  It is easy to see why she has twice been nominated for Academy Awards and twice more received the award as ""Best Actress"".

One of the plot devices used here may make us smile even as we wonder how the producers managed to do it.  We encounter what appears to be story dialog involving several very public figures, including a US President.  The visual effects are also stunning, both in the desert of western America and in the spaces between galaxies.

The story itself is a bit long at two hours and 30 minutes, but it manages to keep us engaged the entire time.  We see acted out here, themes familiar from other science fiction -- particularly the deep conflict between belief founded upon scriptural faith versus the search for truth founded on science and observation.  Perhaps especially in 2017, a revisit of these themes may be timely.

93195,3,0790733226,"I don't know if Carl Sagan would have appreciated how weak Jodie Foster's character was made. In the book, she was a phenomenal force; independent, deeply spiritual, ambitious, bull-headed, but she was made very ""Hollywood"" for the movie. Also, the amount of male privilege that was splashed all over the movie was gross. I'm sure Robert Zemekis and the screenwriters thought it would be ""romantic"" for Palmer Joss to have not voted for Ellie to pilot the machine because he didn't want to lose her, but what it actually sounded like was Palmer preventing Ellie from living her dream - a dream she was willing to die for - all for his need for her. The book was so beautifully nuanced, subtle, and thoughtfully crafted, but I think the movie was just pure audience pandering. The 3rd star is for the effects, which were beautifully done, especially considering they are circa 1997 - very impressive.",1485129600,10,899,4.806451612903226

93223,5,0790733226,"Carl Sagan wrote a beautiful novel. Robert Zemeckis elevated that novel into a beautifully finished proof-of-concept.

Jodie Foster and Jena Malone make Ellie a fully realized, three dimensional character with texture and depth. Matthew McConnaughey delivers the first taste of what he is capable of as a serious actor (what we will later see proof of in A Time To Kill and True Detective). David Morse and William Hurt play, by turns, Ellie's iconic father and father figures without which she would never have had the strength to see things through. William Fichtner leads a cast of wonderful irregulars as Ellie's colleagues and compatriots.

What this movie offers from it's first shot - one of my favorite in ALL of film - is a sense of scale and beauty.

Scale by means of the sheer immensity of creation.

Beauty in the way that all that creation is filled from the macroscopic to the microscopic.

As a young boy, this movie helped me see what kind of a father I would want some day to be. It gave me the phrase often repeated to my own children - ""Small moves, Ellie. Small moves."" Mr. Sagan and Mr. Zemeckis both grasp the essence of wonder native to the human spirit and weave  the fabric of a film that, decades later, still maintains a timeless elegance and essential dignity.

Shooting at Arecibo in Puerto Rico and the Very Large Area in New Mexico lend the film scope and grandeur no soundstage or green screen ever could.

Ellie has become a role model. Life is hard. It takes will and a willingness to meet it both rigidly and openly. The trick is knowing the difference.

William Hurt as Hadden has been a role model of a different type. A reminder not to think flexibly without compromising one's core self, to forge new paths past impossibility, and never accept a thing just because others think it so - things like endings. The importance of playing on one's own terms.

Three generations have been effected by this film in my household. I trust that will extend over time.",1483660800,38,1996,4.644886363636363

I met Carl Sagan at a series of NASA sponsored conferences on artificial intelligence and have the greatest respect for his work.  The book is much more complex than the movie so the differences are understandable.  The movie is a must see if you are interested in SETI or radio astronomy.,1468454400,,552,4.525252525252525

This is a film made by liberals for liberals with the emphasis on bashing Christians. It also serves as an advertisement for the Clinton administration appearing as a serious group of people. In retrospect that was obviously a falsehood given what has come out them over the last 20 years.

Save yourself an hour and a half and just watch Dr. Arroway's  journey in the ""machine"". The graphics are excellent and the dialogue very eloquent.
The rest of the film is a lot of overwrought self-important liberal ideology that has all the finesse of a sledgehammer.

93459,5,0790733226,"I could watch this movie day after day and never tire of it.  Jodie Foster and the rest of the cast are spectacular in this story of first contact with non-earthlings that also explores questions related to faith, religion and its place in what is a global situation, and whether sacrifice of one's life is worth the biggest discovery ""in the history of history"".  Carl Sagan's book was wonderfully adapted to the screen and Jodie Foster is simply at her best in this story that somewhat pits science against religion while at the same time questioning why the two must be in conflict.",1456099200,,585,4.669902912621359

93493,5,0790733226,"Ultimately, despite initial appearances, Contact is not about the search for ET per se, but rather about the more fundamental human nature that drives such a search. They are played at odds in the story, but there are many intentional connections and similarities between the scientific and religious perspectives of characters. Whether we articulate it through faith in an ancient book and heavenly mysticism, or faith in the processes and methodology of contemporary thinkers, we all search for a higher truth, and a reassurance that we are not alone in this universe. It can be a very moving film.

Also, it's a technically well-made movie with quality writing, acting (especially from Jodie Foster, who really sells some key moments that could have very easily fallen flat with a lesser performer), and directing, all that good stuff. There are lots of snazzy shots from Robert Zemeckis; my favorite is during a more tragic scene when the camera does the whole tracking backwards while a character is running towards it thing, and then transitions smoothly into a bathroom cabinet mirror's reflection, as if we were watching that reflection the whole time.

A tiny gripe with the end of the story, avoiding particulars but still possibly with spoilers: Seriously, is that really the Occam's Razor explanation at the end? I don't know if it was meant to be ridiculous (especially given the following behind-the-scenes conversation), but, given the expert in front of you just informed you that your theory's founding premise is impossible, and the rest of it involves convoluted conspiracy, it seems that her alternate explanation - based not in pure speculation but memories of observations - was the one with the least assumptions.",1454198400,,1736,5.152482269503546

93546,5,0790733226,"Really and truly, this is probably my singular all-time favorite movie! I'm not a big fan of Jodie Foster, but her portrayal of Eleanor Arroway is quite well done -- the occasional liberal aside notwithstanding (Could the men with the guns wait outside... this is a civilian installation...) James Woods, Tom Skerritt, Matthew McConaughey, David Morse, William Fitchner, Jake Busey, John Hurt... just an amazing cast of supporting characters! John Hurt damn near steals the show more than once. ""Clever girl... lights!"" ""Oh, maybe not out, but certainly with your hat being handed to you..."" ""The first rule of public spending... why build one when you can build two at twice the price?!""
I think the real reason I love this movie so is because of the book's author: Carl Sagan. He wrote from such a pinnacle of real-life achievement in the field of cosmology. Luckily, CGI had developed to the point that it stands up even to contemporary film standards.
I hope you enjoy this immersive experience as much as I do!!!",1448236800,2,1017,4.884393063583815

Holds up really well.  ----  Just re-watched this tonight on Amazon Instant, for the first time since I first saw it around 1997 when it first came out.  ---- Frankly, I think it is an intriguing film for many reasons.  One, it gives a fairly realistic picture of how the world might respond to evidence of life trying to communicate with us from outer space.  And two,  though the technology is dated  --- old computers, computer monitors, that sort of thing --- the plot  is still entirely plausible for today's audience.  Of course it is very well written, directed, superbly cast, and beautifully photographed, too.  ----  This time around, I was much more sympathetic to the way the film ended, and much more intrigued by the ""contact"" that did apparently happen, and much more satisfied by the time the final credits rolled.

93772,5,0790733226,"The 1997 Movie, Contact: maybe one of the all time best amphibologisms ever created by any director (T. Jefferson's word). Robert Zemeckis prepared a eulogy to Carl Sagan, who died while the movie was in production. The movie was released seven days after the first Mars Rover, Pathfinder, landed on the next planet. Obviously Hollywood does not lose an opportunity for free promotion.

What flies right over the movie goers' heads is that the Alien Father in the movie is a mixture of the movie version of the father of Ellie Arroway, but also the complete sequence of Fathers over the last 40,000 years. Zemeckis places ""signs"" throughout the movie telling the viewer how to restore the Visions of the Ancestors. The star Vega is the alpha star in the constellation known as the Swan Song of the Eternal King.

Since the ""signs"" are meaningless to those that do not know our Ancient Ancestry and the consistent memorials to them that have been floating around the Earth for 40 millennia, an introduction is needed. I have put the required introduction on a web site. But, before viewing the Signs of the Ancients, buy the DVD and become familiar with the sings. the web site is at eyeofsiloam.com/Dresden/Contact.

93821,5,0790733226,"I read Carl Sagan's 1985 novel ""Contact"" the year he published it.  I understand he had originally intended it as a movie all along, but it wasn't to be until screenwriters James V. Hart and Michael Goldenberg and director Robert Zemeckis (""Back to the Future,"" ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"" ""Forrest Gump,"" ""The Polar Express"") used it as the basis for their own movie.  I thought at the time that the book was a fine, thought-provoking piece of science fiction, different from the usual action adventure we get in the genre, so when the film came out, it delighted me.

The fact is, despite the plethora of sci-fi movies that Hollywood has made over the past half century since the UFO craze spread in the late Forties, ""Contact"" is one of the few straight science-fiction works to come along.  That is, rather than rely on too much fantasy, this one concentrates on things that could really happen and things a lot of people like Willie believe may have already happened.  That's not too hard to understand when you remember that the late Dr. Sagan was himself an astronomer, a man who stuck to tried-and-true scientific theories instead of fanciful Tinseltown inventions.  For me, only a few other films can approach pure science fiction, among them ""Things to Come,"" ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" ""Fahrenheit 451,"" ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" ""A.I: Artificial Intelligence,"" and, of course, the greatest of them all, ""2001:  A Space Odyssey.""  That I can even think of ""Contact"" in the same context as these other sci-fi classics is my highest praise for the film.

Here's the thinking behind the story, which is hardly original with Sagan:  There are billions and billions of stars in our galaxy and billions and billions of galaxies.  The odds that our little star is the only one among countless gazillions to have a planet revolving around it are pretty slim.  Indeed, at the time Sagan and other scientists were suggesting there were planets elsewhere in the universe outside our own solar system, we hadn't even discovered any yet.  Today, astronomers find planets circling practically every star they study.  What's more, the odds of our planet among countless other planets being the only one capable of supporting intelligent life are equally slim.  So most scientists these days think the universe is swarming with intelligent life.

The problem is distance.  In the vast gulf of space, the distances between stars is so great that even at the speed of light (which we'll probably never achieve) we couldn't reach any of them in anything less than years, in most cases millions of years.  There is little hope of reaching distant planets unless we could do so through something like radio waves sent out into space.  Or unless we could somehow fold the fabric of time and space to reach them, the concept of ""wormholes"" theorized by some astronomers and so prized by sci-fi writers.

Accordingly, what if we sent enough signals into space that a civilization as advanced our own received them and responded?  And what if they were so advanced they could bend the time-space continuum to travel from one place to another in the universe in the blink of an eye?  And what if they wanted to share their technology for wormhole space travel with us?  That's the idea behind ""Contact,"" and it's not so far-fetched a theory as you might think, since a lot of today's scientists actually support it.

The main character in ""Contact"" is Dr. Eleanor Arroway (Jodie Foster), a dedicated astronomer who diligently believes in the notion of contacting other worlds through the use of giant radio telescopes.  I've read that Sagan modeled this character on two radio astronomers of the 1930s and 1940s, Grote Reber and John Kraus, and, more important, on SETI researcher Jill Tarter.  Obviously, Ms. Tarter is the primary model because she's the more-recent investigator and because she continues her work in the field as the Director of the Center for SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Research, holding the Bernard M. Oliver Chair at the SETI Institute.

Anyway, in the story, Arroway struggles to get her work recognized and funded, finally landing a private donor in the person of multibillionaire industrialist S.R. Hadden (John Hurt) to help her with the project.  Then she receives a signal from deep space, a set of instructions, and gets Hadden and the government to build a gigantic wormhole contraption for travel to distant stars.  From that point on, the movie gets a bit melodramatic, even philosophical, but it never strays too far from scientific reality.

After a brilliant opening sequence, we meet the main character.  Jodie Foster excels as Ellie Arroway, the actress throwing herself into the role with such enthusiasm and dedication, we can hardly resist her energy.  She elevates the film's tension, frustrations, and excitement to a level probably few other actresses could have achieved.

The supporting cast also bring their special presence to the film, although the weakest among them is the co-star, Matthew McConaughey, as Palmer Joss, a New Age minister and special religious consultant to the President.  He seems a bit lightweight in the part and tends to undo some of the film's hard edge.  On the other hand, John Hurt as the reclusive, Howard Hughes-like multibillionaire S.R. Hadden, brings a proper gravitas to his character; as do Tom Skerritt as Dr. David Drumlin, the hardheaded, overly pragmatic Presidential Science Advisor who thinks Ellie is wasting her time; and James Woods as Michael Kitz, the country's National Security Advisor, another of Woods's patented snake roles, his character immediately wanting to militarize Ellie's project.

The movie's climactic sequence will remind viewers of ""2001,"" a spectacular intergalactic light show made all the more dramatic in high-definition picture and sound.  It's quite thrilling, really.

Not that there aren't a few things distracting about ""Contact.""  For one, it's too long, as so many films are these days, challenging one's concentration, to say nothing of one's butt.  I guess that's why we buy movies on disc, though; we can take intermissions whenever we choose.  Second, while I understand the need for McConaughey's character in the story to help represent the conflict between science and religion--objective evidence vs. faith alone--I question the film's insistence on a romantic relationship between him and Arroway.  And then there are a few too many convenient coincidences, plus the fact that Jake Busey's character is able to get away with what he does.  Maybe the filmmakers just wanted to remind us this is a movie, after all.

Nevertheless, the film's shortcomings are trivial compared to its successes, and ""Contact"" remains one of the best straight sci-fi movies since ""2001,"" with high-definition Blu-ray making it better than ever.

Video:
The video engineers use a dual-layer BD50 and a VC-1 encode to reproduce the film in its native aspect ratio, 2.40:1.  The first thing you may notice is that the color palette is somewhat warm, a condition your TV could aggravate if it is already overly red or set to color modes like ""Movie"" or ""Game,"" which are often overly hot to begin with.  If you've calibrated or adjusted your TV for entirely neutral tones, you should enjoy the movie's intentional warmth.

You may also notice that the movie's detailing while good is not the most precise, and that there is a slightly soft quality about the image, although in an entirely realistic way.  Also, in one outdoor daylight scene, a broad expanse of sky over the Very Large Array, you may detect a small, almost imperceptible flicker.  I'm not sure what that's about.  Beyond these almost negligible irregularities, the video is quite easy on the eyes, a light, natural film grain providing the picture with a lifelike texture.

Audio:
The disc comes with lossless Dolby TrueHD 5.1 audio and with a regular Dolby Digital track for those viewers who can't play back the TrueHD.  In lossless, the sound could hardly be better.  There is some excellent surround activity right from the start.  Bass is deep and taut, front-channel dispersion is wide, and dynamic impact is strong.  You couldn't ask for much more.

Extras:
WB carry the Blu-ray extras over from their previous DVD release.  These include three audio commentaries, the first by star Jodie Foster, the second by director Robert Zemeckis and co-producer Steve Starkey, and the third by visual effects supervisors Ken Ralston and Stephen Rosenbaum.  After those are four special-effects featurettes, all in standard definition:  ""The Making of the Opening Shot,"" twenty minutes; ""The Making of the NASA Machine Destruction,"" six minutes; ""The Making of the Harrier Landing,"" nine minutes; and ""The High-Speed Compositing Reel,"" six minutes.  Next, there are three, brief animated sequences in SD:  ""Machine Fly-by,"" a minute and a half; ""Hadden's Plane,"" a half a minute; and ""NASA Control Room,"" a half a minute.

The extras wrap up with a music-only track; forty-two scene selections; two theatrical trailers; English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, and Portuguese spoken languages; French, Spanish, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Norwegian, Portuguese, and Swedish subtitles; and English, German, and Italian captions for the hearing impaired.

Parting Thoughts:
As I've said, ""Contact"" is one of the best pure science-fiction films since ""2001.""  With few exceptions, it's intelligent, thoughtful, and often stirring.  Moreover, Jodie Foster's performance is riveting, and the special effects are first rate.  It's exactly the kind of movie that makes high-definition reproduction so much fun.

93835,5,0790733226,"It's strange that I never had any interest to watch this. Maybe it's because Sagan had such a profoundly negative affect on the actual study of the UFO that are potentially all around us. I always suspected that he was on the payroll of those that were in ""the know"" and that he, like others, believed that mankind needed time to get used to the idea of ""aliens"" being real...before any major revelations took place.

Contact speaks to that issue and many others...it also attacks religion (not spirituality) in a very direct way. And not intelligent religious thought such as those put forth by the Catholic Church...but the sort of religion that fools believe in...and that was sort of nice to see. It also showcases all the reasons why you wouldn't want to disclose this sort of information to anyone at this time in history.

In any event, Foster was perfect for the role. And so was pretty much everyone else.

The good news is that you don't need a big dish to chat with Aliens. Just a Ham radio. So get cracking...they're waiting...",1432771200,,1039,4.635869565217392

93840,5,0790733226,"""Contact"" was a greatly under-appreciated movie.  The topic is an ancient one:  Are we alone in the Universe?  The word, ""Alone"" is a chilling word.  All human beings suffer from loneliness from the age of  ""Stranger Anxiety"" which appears at about nine months of age.  Infants see somebody other than their parents and realize that there is somebody in their world who may not care about them.  This is the second kind of anxiety that human beings experience.
Contact is about humanity not being alone in this vast Cosmos.  The Radio Astronomer Ellie Arroway, who lost her mother at childbirth and lost her father to an MI at a very young age, has spent her adult life scanning the skies suing radio telescopes.  She is finally assigned to the Very Large Array of Radio Telescope Dishes at Arecibo, New Mexico.  One night she starts to pick up signals that appear to be emanating from Vega, a star that is more than 24 light years from the Earth.  The first transmissions are the ""Prime numbers"", those numbers that are not divisible by any integer: 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc.  She finds in these transmissions coded instructions for building a large machine.  She guesses that this machine is some type of a transport system that will send the individual who is pictured message to the star Vega by some mysterious method.
The fact that intelligent life has started transmitting messages to the Earth sets off a frenzy of political and religious speculation.  The President of the United States at the time of this movie's production, Bill Clinton gives a cameo appearance in this movie, describing the enormous importance of this discovery.  Unfortunately this movie cam out at the same time as the Monica Lewinsky story broke and Impeachment Proceedings against President Clinton were begun in Congress.  This unfortunate timing is likely why the movie did not do very well.  Anything that had to do with William Jefferson Clinton was distasteful in the extreme.
 Eighteen years later historians have been giving the Clinton White House very high marks and this movie can be seen in the calm of retrospect as being a remarkably prescient movie.  As NASA prepare for the Mars Mission, my daughter was one of four ""Crew Members"" of the first ""Dry Run Mission To Mars"", we again are experiencing Mankind's desire to find ""Life Out There"".
With our appetite for finding any form of life in the Cosmos recovers, there ought to be renewed interest in this wonderful movie.",1431475200,9,2472,4.815165876777251

Jodie Foster is amazing in the role of  Eleanor Arroway, a scientist who has seemingly thrown away her career in the pursuit of extraterrestrial life.  Her decision is rewarded when signals from outer space are detected, and she gets a chance to confront challenges both professional and personal.

I love this film!  I've watched it several times and I'll watch it again and again.  This works on several levels; science versus religion, personal desire versus career choices, friendship and love.

The cast is terrific, starring Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey respectively as a SETI scientist and a renowned Christian philosopher.  Other notable roles are filled by solid ensemble of actors including: James Woods, John Hurt, Tom Skerritt, Angela Bassett, William Fichtner, David Morse, Jake Busey, Rob Lowe, Geoffrey Blake, and Max Martini.

The movie well-directed by Robert Zemeckis and works like a journey, which has its trials and tribulations, but also elements that excite, thrill, and even inspire.  Visually, it's terrific and the special effects (now almost 20 years ago) are intense and eye-popping,

94022,5,0790733226,"A wonderful & memorable science fiction-drama that is primarily & metaphorically a movie about faith & evidence. With the opening of the blockbuster ""Interstellar"" (soon to be out on video) also starring Matthew McConaughey, I ultimately think ""Contact"" is a better movie in terms of its emotional & dramatic effect. But perhaps ""Interstellar"" is better at the sci-fi portion. I compare the 2 because after seeing ""Interstellar"" I remembered this movie & wanted to see it again. I appreciate ""Contact"" so much more now and Carl Sagan's writting & ideas! Contact definitely has a slower build & less action, but it is overall a better movie than Interstellar... or ""Independence Day"". Contact starts & ends with emotion, including it throughout the movie, but Interstellar puts the whole ""power of love"" thing rudely right in the middle of the movie all the way toward the end, which totally threw me off (not in a good way). I don't feel like it set that up well...

 I believe ""Contact"" had the unfortunate timing of coming out about a year AFTER the movie ""Independence Day"" instead of before it. Although it did do fairly well at the box office, if it had opened before ""ID4"" I think it would have grossed much better. ID4 is more of a ""leave your brain at home & enjoy"" action movie than anything else. There's just a lot more thought & depth to Contact, and even the effects still stand strong today! The beginning of this movie still puts me in awe & I appreciate the bold choice! The actual alien contact makes sense to me since I believe this is something like what would happen if we reached a benevolent alien race (or rather they reached us).

If you like movies about alien discovery, I absolutely recommend this!!!",1421798400,,1727,4.711920529801325

94098,5,0790733226,"This is the film adaptation of how Carl Sagan thought events would ""go down"" if SETI ever received a signal of intelligent nature from light-years away. You can hear his exact words coming out of the mouths of the main characters, especially Jodie Foster, Matthew M. and especially the father-figure.

The dad AND ""Ellie"" AND Matt M all say, ""If we were alone, it'd be an awful waste of space.""
When Ellie's ""father"" speaks to her on her journey to ""Pensacola,"" Every word is what Carl would say to a visitor to OUR planet if WE had sent a message back, amplified, with instructions on how to visit us. (And the visitor was diff...but essentially ""human-like"")

Carl's portrayal of how the world reacts shows his deep understanding of the human condition; the wacko's, the media, religious extremists/terrorists, the US Gov't, The U.N. and his thinly-veiled, eccentric Howard Hughes character.

""I have many enemies, business interests, even governments who'd like to see me dead. I'll grant them there wish soon enough, but before I do, I wish to make one more contribution to the people who've given...from whom I've TAKEN so much...LIGHTS!""

""First rule of government spending. Why build one when you can have two at TWICE the price? Only this one can be kept secret, built by the Japanese [sys.integ] ...who have recently become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hadden Industries. They still want an American to go. Wanna take a ride?""

I wonder how well Carl and Howard knew each other sometimes.

The climax, Ellie with her ""father"" in ""Pensacola"" gets me every time. No scientist, philosopher, meta-physicist or spiritual/religious person can get through this movie w/o getting misty if not crying outright, as I usually do.

I miss Carl. Glad he never lived to see NASA's manned space exploration program and the shuttle program placed on hold indefinitely in 2011. It would've broken his heart. -Movie is in my top10. you should watch it, ... yes you.",1418688000,,2270,5.067024128686327

Both Jodie Foster and Matthew Mc Conaughey deliver strong performances and overall the movie did a good job honoring Carl Sagan's novel. The movie has a very nice shot of the Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico when main character, Elle, is doing her post-doc.

To anybody reading this who is minded to give it an unhelpful rating just because they disagree with my assessment, or because it does not overlap with their OWN views, then it is YOU who are being unhelpful to the Amazon reviewing process where all points of views, and the more widely gathered, the better, contribute to a useful resource on this website and shoppers. You probably think that comment is UNHELPFUL too.

When this man bubbling with enthusiasm for everything implied in a return to the 70mm standard of cinemascope, shot on real film not fake digital, a life long enthusiast for all things space exploration, related technology, sci fi and astro adventure, stemming back to the good old days of kids Saturday morning cinema when an imaginary visit to the Red Planet was or some other with moons and rings was regularly interspersed with the usual B-movie Western, was directed by Mark Kermode, the BBC's film critic to regard ""Interstellar"" (which he was reviewing and I was gawping about) as being closely related NOT to ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" but rather to ""Contact"", an entire fire station of warning bells, klaxons and sirens should have started to go off.* Perhaps flashing lights and a pole should have been at hand too.

Where does one start to unravel the cutesy incompetence of either ""Interstellar"" or ""Contact""?

Is there enough space on the whole of Amazon to tell people how bad these films are?

So I can only start with the dripping sentimentality of the scene setting earlier parts of both movies. But at least with Jodie Foster and the rest of the cast you can hear the dialogue and understand what is actually being said.

It is impossible to take the appearance of President Clinton on a conference podium, however skilfully interwoven into the narrative of the film, as one expects him to say ""I did not have sex with that woman!"" and the moment is completely destroyed. Am I alone in this? In space no one can hear you scream: ""I did not...""

Half way through the film a terrorist seems to have been included in the plot to spin (spin - yep, spin baby spin) out the plot and had a remarkable resemblance to Gary Busby, hair, face, teeth wise as well.

This also gives John Hurt the chance to make a second minor supporting role performance of the stereotypically mad multi billionaire meddler who allows private enterprise to at least get an honourable mention in a tale of tax dollar funded folly. The Tea Party in space - so close yet so far away reference Virgin. ""I am on MIR courtesy of the Soviets , the weightless environment is the only thing stopping the cancer from eating me alive"", ""Fancy a ride?""

In suiting and booting up for the mission Jodie/Ellie is handed a suicide pill/cyanide capsule. ""We have been giving these out for years."" It's just as well they were not enclosed with this DVD as the temptation to take the painless way out became ever pressing, especially at the point soon afterwards when space seems to have been fashioned up by a pair of oriental techs dressed by Philippe Stark with absurd uniforms and helmets that came straight from a 1990s Parisian fashion runway. One was reminded of the 100 year ageing process that the audience undergoes when watching Nolan's preposterous load of crap. Every minute of time spent in front of ""Interstellar"" representing 3 months of life in Leicester Square London.

Of course Interstellar and Contact do bare comparison and are closely related as being another exercise in science supplying an alternative religion - even a wise benevolent power, ""out there"", assisting the human race to a higher level of consciousness (virtue?) or just saving it from itself. As such they do not automatically enter the trash can - after all 2001 had a similar finale - but it is the way it is done, the superficiality of the vision, the neat comforting conclusions of the outcome and the mechanism by which one arrives there. Nothing in these two films is convincing.

As ""Contact"" is removed to an increasingly remote distance region of the space-time universe, unless of course we all end up back in the 1990s again via an ""Interstellar"" wormhole, the ludicrous plot, dialogue (""You have your mother's hands"" spoken by a true alien), obvious public placements of handy pieces of commercially available home audio equipment and electronics (Compaq, Philips, JBL ad nauseum) Jodie's complete unsuitability for any form of space mission (I wouldn't trust her get the weekly shop) the mortified forced expression of David Morse - a great actor with good material - progressing to the nirvana of end of contract and conclusion of shooting (who do I have to sleep with to get off this film?) one can only keep shouting and screaming along with Jodie ""Ready to go! Ready to go! Ready to go!""

I already did.

*Of course, ""2001"" and ""Interstellar"" can not be mentioned in the same breath, technically or artistically.",1417996800,3,4913,4.787485242030696

Skerritt's flunky cuts off the funding for Ellie's project to search for signals from alien civilizations using radio telescopes.  Ellie then secures a source of private funds. When Ellie finally detects a signal from an extraterrestrial civilization broadcasting from the vicinity of the star Vega, however, the flunky and his government cronies rush in to claim credit!",1408752000,,582,5.755813953488372

94210,5,0790733226,"Easily one of the best SF movies of all time, this one benefits from the fact that it was based on the novel of a real scientist, the late Carl Sagan.
  Few directors have a clue about science or believe they shouldn't use it for fear it will simply confuse the audience.  The ability to use science in a story, coupled with the ability to write a good story, can make for a great movie.  This movie is proof.
  This is the story of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) with radio telescopes.  We see the story through the eyes of a very dedicated young woman, Ellie Arroway.  After decades of waiting for a message from aliens, it arrives.  The heart of the story is how the world responds to  that message.
  The overall story is very good, interesting and easy to follow.  Overall the science is good, with a few exceptions, which, I believe, are better understood if you remember that this is a movie for the general public.
  In one scene young Ellie is waiting for her father to join her to view a meteor shower; she's looking through a telescope.  Telescopes have too small a field of view to see something like a meteor moving quickly across the sky:  it's like trying to watch a football game through a keyhole.  But the telescope cues the audience into the fact that astronomy is going on, and the scene says a lot about young Ellie.
  There's another scene in which the adult Ellie says that there are 400 billion stars in our galaxy (true enough) and if only 1 in a million had planets, 1 in a million of those had life, and 1 in a million had intelligent life, there would still be millions of planets with intelligent life.  Actually, that incredibly small number would pretty much mean that we're not here.  She should have said 1 in a hundred instead, but I believe the fact that 1 in a million sounds much more impressive won the day.
  There are many good things:  the playback of the earthly broadcast showing Hitler opening the Olympic Games in 1936 is based on the fact that we've been sending such signals into space for decades and by now they've reached lots of stars.
  Personally I liked the character of Kent Clark, the blind radio astronomer, whose ears are so keen he can pick out ""structure"" in the radio signal.  It's true that real SETI doesn't have humans listening for alien signals:  they have computers scanning as many radio bands as possible, trying to detect a signal that might be intelligent.  However, once such a signal is received and once the signal is processed so that it can be heard audibly, it is possible that someone with good ears might hear that there is more to the signal than the others realize.  Would it really work?  I don't know, but I loved the idea.
  I think the movie can be enjoyed by many, even by those who don't usually care for science.  The acting is very good; I loved the musical score.  Director Zemeckis chose to put in some nice little touches that, had they been left out would not have ruined the film, but certainly made it even more enjoyable, e.g. the memorable scene showing Ellie running for her father's medicine, the scene being reflected in a mirror.
  It's really a great movie.",1408492800,,3180,4.494755244755245

94231,4,0790733226,"Though I'm not too familiar with the original source material of the same name, by Carl Sagan, I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie since I saw it on the TCM Channel in 2013; moreover I'm all the more tempted now to find and read the original source material.

Without giving too much away, the movie does tackle a lot of subject in regards to the relationship between science and the various faces of the religions of humanity - though the primary focus is of that of the judeo-christianity. Eleanor Arroway (played by Jodie Foster), father Palmer Joss (played by Matthew McConaughey) as well as various other characters bring up arguments that somewhat challenges (though I use the word very loosely) the ideals and end results of science and faith.

How both are capable of indeed helping humanity, be it individually or collectively, and how both are (arguably) capable of regression due to its misuse; this is what I like and don't like about Contact however.
I like that it tries to walk the middle ground by showing that religion does not cause suffering - the person does, more specifically - the extreme literal interpretation of said religion; moreover that the film shows that science is not some contrived, grand conspiracy against ""God"";  instead it shows that science is nothing more than a voyage into the unknown and that without it progression and any understanding of the universe (or of ourselves for that matter) is impossible.
At the same time I don't like it because in pandering to both sides and trying to be, for lack of a better word, ""tame"", the arugments and theme in presents (for the most part) feel useless, unneeded.

All that being said though, I like the movie. It's well paced, decent narrative, and - on a personal note - it does leave you with a warm feeling. A feeling of hope; be it in the future, yourself, humanity and the earth as a whole, and most of all it leaves you with the one thing that most people lack in this day and age - humility.",1405123200,,1994,4.624293785310734

All aspects of this  excellent movie, (story, acting, special effects, etc) interleave with each other to create the synergy of  being greater than the whole of the parts.  And because of this the movie flows along effortlessly, never releasing its grip on our attention and at points reaching the hypnotic intensity  of an epic novel.

94248,4,0790733226,"I enjoyed watching this movie for its premise of finding extraterrestrial life, but I really felt that whoever wrote the storyline pretty much painted it into a corner by getting into a tug of war between science and spirituality. Jodie Foster played the part of Dr. Eleanor Arroway perfectly, but unfortunately when asked, it would have been off the crux of the story for Dr. Arroway to just deflect the questions about her own views on spirituality by having her answer ""I'm an astronomer, not a theologian""... in that respect, I felt that the movie was hitting its viewers over the head with the idea of questioning religion.

There is a secondary story about computing the digits of pi which did not appear in the movie - so you should read the book as well, because there is a very interesting discovery, independent (?) of the main theme.  The problems that the main character Elie faces - getting funding, administrative turf wars, lack of imagination on the part of congress and some of the public are probably pretty typical.  The highlight of the film for me was when The Signal first was received - it is done as an audio signal, which is not the way radio astronomers usually get data, but it is incredibly exciting.

94251,5,0790733226,"Contact has been on my list of favorite movies for a long time.  It has great cinematography, casting, and music, but its script is the real standout.  It's rare that *any* fictional film spends so much time on science, even other science fiction films, but this movie manages to touch upon a lot of the important dichotomies and other concepts in the field of science:  Basic science versus applied science, empirical data versus faith, openness versus control of information, the opposition of science and religion, the convenience and ubiquity of technology versus personal fulfillment, and even the role of sexism in a field where judgement on knowledge and merits is supposed to be the only thing that matters.  (The excellently cast and played Drummond spends pretty much all of his screen time alternately patronizing the main character and stealing credit for her work, even daring to justify his behavior by lecturing her about how the world is not a place where fairness matters, as if he were teaching her some kind of important lesson and she would thank him someday.)

This movie has held up extremely well since 1997, and anyone with a sense of curiosity and wonder would be well served to see it at least once.",1401148800,,1225,4.8701923076923075

These are just as plausible explanations as those supplied by science (fiction?) and technology are they not? Finally, I have to include a note about Jena Malone. Jodie Foster has stated that she based her movements and expressions as the adult Ellie on those of Jena Malone as the child Ellie.

Smaller parts include Jake Busey as the religeious fanatic who blows up the astrophysics project.  James Woods plays a government official who is skeptical about the results provided by the astrophysics project, but (spoiler alert) who eventually changes his mind.  Angela Bassett plays White House Chief of Staff to President Clinton, who provides routine assistance to Jodie Foster.

SUMMARY.  The film starts out with Jodie as a girl.  Her father trains her to monitor signals from space, using amateur electronics equipment.  One day, the father has a heart attack and croaks, leaving Jodie without a dad.  Eventually (fast forward), Jodie is a student at MIT acquiring a Ph. D. in astrophysics.  Years later, she tries to get funding to rent time on a radiotelescope in the desert to monitor signals from outer space.  Eventually, she is granted an audience with a funding agency, but she blows up in anger, because they are not sympathetic to her goals.  But an ""angel"" (angel is the technical term for a venture capitalist who funds projects on his own) steps in and funds her project.  With her project funded, Jodie continues to monitor signals from the radiotelescope in the desert.  John Hurt is one of her co-workers.  Eventually, the team discovers some strange signals that sound like washing machine sounds.  With the aid of computer processing (warning, another spoiler alert), the team discovers that the signals are really plans for building a huge machine.  The machine is an astrophysics gadget that enables the traveler to journey through a wormhole to meet her dead father.  The machine is built at Cape Canaveral.  Tom Skerritt, wanting to steal all of the credit from Jodie Foster, decides that he will be the first to use the machine.  But Jake Busey sneaks inside the facility, disguising himself as a technician, and blows up the whole thing, killing Tom Skerritt. Fortunately, (warning, another spoiler alert), a duplicate machine had been built on a remote island off of the coast of Japan.  Jodie Foster is allowed to take the journey in the machine in Japan.  She travels through space, journeys through a wormhole, and visits with her father on a beach.  When she returns, she is not able to convince anybody of what had happened, because the available evidence suggests that nothing had happened.  However, at the last minute in the movie, data demonstrated that what earthlings had perceived to take place in less than a second, actually represented a few hours of time for Jodie Foster.  The film ends with the the tantalizing realization that what Jodie had experienced had actually come to pass.

GREAT LINES.  The screenplay is noted for some great lines.  For example, when Jodie was a girl, her father told her that it would be a waste of space if there was no life out there in the stars.  Years later, during her love affair with Matthew McConaughey, Matthew spontaneously comes up with the same concept, and says the same thing (""it seems like an aweful waste of space"") that her father had said years earlier.  This greatly increases the affinity that Jodie has for Matthew, as one might expect, given Jodie's love for her deceased father.

At one point, Jodie is grilled by a large committee, where the issue is whether she should be allowed to journey in the machine.  Three people grill Jodie on the question, ""Do you believe in God?""  This was meant to be a provocative question, and to brand Jodie as an atheist and therefore not adequate to be the first passenger on the space gadget.  Jodie replies, ""I don't believe that there is data either way,"" referring to whether God exists or doesn't exist.  When pressed further on this point, Jodie replies, ""I believe, um, I believe that I've already answered that question.""  A similar dialogue occurs in GULLIVER'S TRAVELS with Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen, where Mary is asked if she believes the wild stories told by Ted Danson, who plays Gulliver.  Mary refrains from answering that she belives him, but instead answers, ""I belive in him.""

At an early point in the movie, Matthew opens up a box of Cracker Jack, and inside is a toy compass, and he gives this to Jodie as a momento.  This particular toy is kept by Jodie, through thick and thin, and it serves as a humble icon that is kept, just as Jodie keeps alive her affection for Matthew.  A toy compass in a Cracker Jack box also makes its appearance in the movie 1941, where actor Slim Pickens quickly swallows the compass so that the Japanese submariners will not be able to use it to find their way.  The common item (Cracker Jack compass) but totally different uses for this item, makes one of the more remarkable footnotes in the history of American cinema.

Another amazing part of the script, is where Jodie Foster takes Angela Bassett aside, in order to ask an important question.  But as it turns out, Jodie's question is, ""Where can I get a really great dress?""

CONCLUSION.  I liked every moment of this film.  There were no ""dead sequences"" in the middle, meant to use up time.  The film was full of twists and surprises.  The film ends with a few ambiguities, though these ambiguities were intentional.  More than most films, this movie calls for a sequel.",1397174400,2,5440,4.830270270270271

It is her dream to make contact with extraterrestrial intelligence. Despite facing obstacles including funding and skepticism from colleagues, Arroway and her team are successful and receive what appears to be a message from aliens. From there, the movie goes on to explore the ramifications of the event.

The special effects and the acting in this movie are impressive. It is inevitable that any movie based on a book must eliminate some things and simplify others, but I thought the movie was a good adaptation of the novel. A big part of this film is the always present science vs. religion debate and this is seen in the movie through the characters of Arroway and Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey).

If you are a scientist, you cannot believe in God and if you believe in God you cannot be a good scientist.  Isaac Newton, one of the greatest scientists believed in God.  Albert Einstein, again one of the greatest scientific thinkers believed in God.  How can this be?

Actually, 3.5 stars, not 3.

Jody Foster is a great actress. I felt that she portrayed her character well, particularly where she had to use her imagination in the scenes where she is experiencing and seeing things that are supposed to be indescribable. I thought she was masterful in expression of emotion.

The rest of the characters were predictable and cheesy, however. I did not appreciate how the religious figures, except for one, were portrayed as hick, berconservative obstructionists or fanatical, evil, and insane martyrs. Not very believable characters. I will say again, cheesy and predictable. The supporting actors were more believable (ex. president's secretary). Being LDS, I rolled my eyes at the reference to the fanatical preacher being from Utah. It was also a stretch in the plot to have a Howard W. Hughes figure in S.R. Hadden. His role in forwarding the plot was essential, but it was a bit silly to watch the Hughes eccentricity replicated.

This was just an interesting premise by Carl Sagan and it shows that scientists indeed must have creativity in their field. I'm glad that Sagan stuck with science and did not continue to write books. The movie is good for Foster's acting and good for pretty good entertainment. Pop the popcorn and watch it. Just ignore the cheese.",1395187200,,1357,4.991150442477876

As a Born Again Christian, I feel the sex scene and the obvious cuts at Christians were uncalled for.  The message of the film regarding religion seemed to be that you're not really truly a believer unless are an agnostic humanist that was once a believer but are too smart for that now...and you're now just trying to rationalize every aspect of faith.

Typical of hollywood, though, so I didn't penalize for this in my ratings.  Those are my personal feelings about the content.  The acting, story (for the most part), directing, etc. were exemplary.

When she finally does achieve contact, others try to manipulate her aside to take the credit.  But with behind the scenes assistance from a mysterious billionaire, she becomes the first person to make physical contact  with extra terrestrial beings.

Her struggles for financing and acknowledgement of her work are timeless and could apply to any field of work, and that grandstanding boss was so spot on, I'm sure each of us has worked for somebody like that. Yuk. And the depiction of the alien was spot on for me, because if they are that intelligent , they certainly don't have to look like green martians, unless of course they want to.

I love movies that are science fiction but try to stay within the boundaries of what ""might happen"".  However, this is not really a movie about little green men, space or even science it's a movie about faith.  Its probably one of the best spiritual movies ever made.

94414,5,0790733226,"Carl Sagan had the gift of making astronomy and cosmology understandable.  As an astrophysicist he realized that our first contact with an alien species might very likely occur by picking up radio signals from space.  That was the premise he used in his novel Contact.  But Contact is not about the science or even about alien races, it is about how mankind might react to such contact and the role belief plays in shaping our understanding and our reactions to the certain discovery that other intelligent life exists in the cosmos.  And belief is what this movie is really about as it portrays Science and Religion as both lovers and adversaries in the quest for understanding and truth.

Contact doesn't answer the ultimate questions of life, but it does present them in a dramatic, suspenseful and believable way and leaves us to ask ourselves what role our beliefs play in our own lives.",1391904000,,892,4.803921568627451

In spite of that, those not prejudiced by having read the book should still find the story line entertaining. particularly if you can relate to such scientific concepts as ""worm holes"" through time and space.",1391904000,,470,4.108695652173913

If this movie reflects the thinking of Carl Sagan then I do believe I've misjudge the man.  While he never embraced God as I, this movie implies he never, in an absolute sense, closed his mind and heart off to the possibilitites.

The conundrums and paradoxes used in this movies are marvelous.

Guess you could say I liked this movie and would highly recommend it!

94436,5,0790733226,"Not only was the story of this movie written by a visionary and a genius, this movie is about us.

This movie takes place in modern times and juxtaposes real life against the backdrop of intelligent life in outer space.  It's not about futuristic technologies or far out heros.  This movie is about real people.  Real humans.  It's a treatment about what would happen in our times if we made contact with extraterrestrials.  Like ET, this captures how someone's life would change with that contact.  Therefore, I think this is one of the most visionary science fiction tales of all time.  It's about everyday people in modern times, no one extraordinary, taking an unimaginable leap out into the galaxy, with a little help from friends in distant places.

I have seen this movie twice.  The first time when it came out, and I was young then, only 21 or so.  And, at that time, I wanted action and wiz bang.  It honestly didn't satisfy me at that point in my life.  Many years later, I adore this movie for its dream and it's humanity.",1391385600,,1034,4.554347826086956

The main premise that there are lots of other habitable planets must be correct.  If there are 17 billion planets similar in size to Earth in the Mily Way, and 1 in 1000 is at the right distance to have liquid water... then there are 17 million possible places for life, just in our galaxy.  And there are 500 billion galaxies.

But mostly really far away, even at light speed.  I guess, when someone or something does show up will be a surprise.  It is worrisome that greater technology does not seem to bring greater awareness, as is clear on Earth.

It shows how decent people, Scientists, get trampled on by Bully's and Politicians and how they use the Media to their advantage.

It's not about ""Making Contact"" as it is about Trust, God, Politics and pure human nature.

This film however, though solidly in the genre of science fiction, does not.

The character of Ellie Arroway does not say anything which I cannot imagine Carl Sagan himself uttering.

It's also a more personal story about loneliness, hope, and the growth of civilization. It's a beautiful and sweet story, but also serious and tense at times.

94614,4,0790733226,"What I love about Contact most, is the imagination.  Without giving anything away, let's just say that it's a ride containing different periods of struggle, persistence and success... even if that success is sometimes limited.  Also, if you're expecting ""little green men"" from this, you'll be sorely disappointed.  This is a look at one possibility for contact through educated and creative eyes.

Jodie Foster as Ellie is spot on for what I'd hope a passionate, atheist, scientist, protagonist would be.  She's stubborn at times when confronting McConaughey's religious character, making her both lovable and frustrating simultaneously.  In the end, regardless of her beliefs, you can't help but to admire her honesty... and the fact that despite having the opportunity to lie or sell-out multiple times, to get what she wants, she never does.

My dislike for the flaws (McConaughey's acting, the radical appearance of the religious zealot, Skerritt's frustratingly opportunistic/exploitative personality etc) are far outweighed by the imagination and excitement the movie contains.  In fact, I believe that a script/film of this scope & type could be a breeding ground for inaccuracies, annoyances and loose ends.  While it certainly has some amount of these, at least the latter was in the movie purposefully. The others aren't so heavy that I didn't enjoy the movie, I was able to ignore them and finish the story... I THINK most would be able to do the same.

You certainly have the opportunity to leave the movie with more questions than answers, something I view as increasingly rare for today's films (or maybe I'm just watching the wrong ones).  I'm a big fan of films making me think beyond the minute I leave the theatre, or turn off the TV, but even if you aren't... quite a journey.",1385510400,,1796,5.074829931972789

Personal opinions aside this movie does an excellent job at stirring up the right emotions as you find yourself willing the protagonist to continue trudging along in her quest.

The first five minutes of the movie, the first time you see it, should leave you in a wondering gaze as our insignificance and clearly forgettable impact as organisms on this tiny rock become frighteningly evident.",1385078400,,549,4.778947368421052

The main thing I didn't like about the movie was the sort of constant battle in it between supposed science and supposed religion; the movie doesn't lean one way or the other in the end (the protagonist for instance starts out very against pure faith, but ends up strongly in favor of it), but throughout it seems to be trying too hard to promote a tension between the two. There wasn't very much character conflict in the plot, I guess, so they had to create something for conflict, and it didn't go very well. The film is also longer than it needed to be, IMHO.

Overall, a good movie, and fun trip back to the 90s. I smiled seeing Clinton and CRT monitors everywhere :)",1384732800,,918,4.362573099415204
94622,4,0790733226,"Plot: We follow Foster as a little girl whose father pushes her intrigue and love of science, astrology and CB radios. Her father passes away shortly after her introduction in this movie, which further instills her scientific as opposed to religious view and approach to life. We then see Foster having made a career in the field of astronomy, particularly with interest in the search for extraterrestrial life. After getting private funding, Foster comes across a unique pattern of sounds that is later found to be a precise set of instructions to build a machine. With dreams of sharing contact Foster will do anything to see this through, despite all the religious and political turmoil along the way.
There is some excellent cinematography in the movie with some interesting special effects, but nothing that would completely ruin the film like a lot of CGI these days. The acting is good and is made to feel more natural with the use of real news clips and voice archives. The only thing that doesnt come across as natural is the relationship between Foster and McCauneughey. Other than that, if you enjoy anything fantasy related, thought provoking, or perhaps a little more sciencey less fictiony then this is the movie for you!",1384732800,,1235,4.913875598086125

I'd say Sagan succeeded in helping us see SETI from a more practical perspective while entertaining us at the same time. One of the practical considerations, of course, is that by the sheer weight of the numbers, if Darwinian evolution occurs spontaneously whenever and wherever conditions are right, there should be literally millions of worlds in the observable universe where it has (and/or is) happening, with many civilizations far more advanced than ours (per the somewhat controversial work of astronomer Frank Drake and others).

Unfortunately it was just as meh as I remember it being.  Rather than being used as a vehicle to debate philosophy the movie seems to try and cram the idea down the audience throats that science and religion (Christianity particularly) can be justified within a single equation.  I feel as though I am constantly told throughout the movie that ""science is great but don't loose your faith"".  This whole movie would be better served as the novel originally did not choosing a side and merely posing philosophical ideas that sometimes conflict and leaving the audience to debates these different ideas among themselves.  Aside from the overly preachy anthem of the movie it just isn't very interesting.

94680,4,0790733226,"I saw this film in the theater when it was relaased and this is the first time I've seen it since that time. It's well made, entertaining, and compelling. As a science fiction movie, Contact is OK, as long as you ignore it's lack of faithfulness to Carl Sagan's novel of the same name. It's really a political drama in which the sci-fi element is the MacGuffin.

As a time capsule of the late 1990's, it excels at using faked news media to make it seem real. The special effects are excellent. The cynicism in the way government operates, the manipulative abilities of the extremely wealthy, the fairly negative view of humanity, and the emphasis on spirituality and God deliver a conservative message that today's Evangelical Christians and Tea Party should find quite appealing.

Unfortunately, it's one of those movies where you really want the entire movie to be the first 15 minutes because what happens next is more interesting than the first two hours - especially if you're interested in it as a sci-fi film. (Which, of course, would have taken it even further away from Sagen's book.)

I must say that I kept wanting Jody Foster to give Matthew McConaughey a good swift kick in the gonads and send him packing, but she never did.

This film, while not a masterpiece, is a solid and entertaining film that will hold up well to the test of time. After writing this, I took a look at Roger Ebert's review. I usually find that he and I have similar taste and tend to rate films similarly - although it is often for very different reasons. Roger gave this film 5 stars and thinks it is, in fact, a masterpiece. So, do take a look at Contact and decide for yourself whether Roger Ebert got it right and I got it wrong.

94681,3,0790733226,It's good sci-fi. The woman portrayed in the movie by Jodie Foster gave up the search after 31 years of finding nothing. The universe is strangely silent without recognized contact with other intelligent species.,1381449600,,212,5.264705882352941
94682,3,0790733226,"If there was ever a film that cheapened science fiction, while promoting the sheer stupidity of Hollywood, Contact is it.

Despite the intriguing scenario of another sentient species acknowledging us, in this case via a television signal first broadcast from the Berlin Olympics sent back to us to get our attention, followed by information about the species involved. Allowing idiotic diatribes between politicians, religious maniacs and other assorted groups to become the common denominator in the script, totally ruined the film for me.

As for all of the constant scenes about America's various crackpots and their opinions on science, why did Hollywood think it would appeal to the rest of the world?",1381449600,,706,5.294642857142857

If you look at the ending, the main character has to emphatically admit that she feels in her gut that there is ""something out there bigger than all of us"".  I find the overall conclusion of the film a bit corny.  I really don't think that the main female character would have  had a romatic relationship with a religious man, no matter how modern or 'new age' he may seem to be.  Seriously?  This film feels very 1980's, despite being made in the late 90's. The concept of  life on other planets is still one that is being researched by scientists today.  In a time of international financial crisis, shouldn't we be spending time and effort on helping one another?  In an odd way, thinking that we can find another planet with life on it to point us towards new frontiers and solve our problems seems, ironically, egotistical--and well, very American.",1381017600,,1003,4.553072625698324

For those with eyes to see and ears to hear, this film is easily in their top 10 of all time.  This is pure cinema folks that entertains, teaches and forces us to feel about our existence.

What draws me back again and again is a portrayal of the Universe that can satisfy viewers who are religiously oriented as well as those who are not.

VIDEO....It just goes to show you that you don't need the highest Mbps rate to create a good transfer of the video to Blu Ray.  The Mbps rate varies from the high teens to low thirties depending upon the action's needs.  Forget all that, how does it look?  This is one of the very best transfers of video I have seen.  Absolutely no artifacting, no motion blurs which would have been real easy to see for many of the scenes in this movie and no false colors either.  The colors created in post production are simply beautiful to look at and skin tones are spot on.  There were a couple of scenes where the contrast was so good, it was almost like watching it in 3D.  Contrast throughout the entire film is excellent and I do believe this transfer could and should be used as a DEMO worthy disc.  I do not have this film on Standard Def DVD so this review is not a comparison and I can not say whether or how much they did any remastering but the video is just gorgeous.

AUDIO....The lossless PCM 5.1 audio shows how much audio editors can do when they put their minds to it.  There is a full usage of both the front and rear stages as well as many scenes of discreet channeling between the rears and front as well as pans of audio all around.  The very first scene will wake up your audio system and let it know it has some work to do.  The LFE channel is not called upon as often but it gets its own workout in many scenes. The dialogue is clean and very transient and transparent.  Audio levels are set properly so you will not have to roller coaster your remote's volume control.  If you know your chapters with this film, the audio is also, totally demo worthy.

Extras consisted of making of documentaries cut to individual chapters mostly focusing upon how they created the various composite scenes in the film for special fx.  Also included were two trailers and 3 different commentaries( a touch of overkill IMHO)  Also included was a music only audio track.

I bought this film on a lark, hadn't seen it in years but now am very glad I did.

All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.

Beside a plot that twists in fun directions, it brings up thoughtful ideas.  I tend not to watch films more than once, but this film was good to watch again after not too long.  Check it out, and think for a bit about the world beyond.  Think most everything is aleady known?  Well,just look up.  Greatest mystery ever is just above our heads- everyday.

The film starts slowly, portraying a typical labratory-like environment where each day is much like the next, but it builds in excitement.  By the end, the situation is getting really exciting.  Contact is fun to watch for the special effects but it has a plot equally as engaging.  The science vs. faith struggle is an added delight for the intellectual.",1369872000,,646,5.284313725490196

94801,5,0790733226,"Carl Sagan, the greatest science teacher in history writes a story of the epic battle between science and religion synthesizing the two into one. Science is the only way to reveal the true nature of the universe and religion is the manifestation of man's desire to know the ultimate truth without having to think at all. Both will completely fail to ever resolve the question of WHY even if science is able to explain in massive detail exactly HOW everything came to be and how it will end/begin. There is no greater entity to verify that why part. Clearly the tensions revolving around science and religion and the forces that seek to utilize one or the other to seek dominance was an issue when written and indeed remains a very serious problem almost 2 decades later. For whatever reason man seems to have to know the ultimate answers and will make them up when convenient. Despite the concept of the evil scientist, itself a product of fear and ignorance of science and what it reveals, the world has nothing to fear from science...it's not an ideology, just a method of proving things. However religion has been, and I'm afraid will always be, the greatest source of fear, hate, stupidity and violence affecting civilization that can ever be. That's why this movie is so damn good.

I saw this film years ago when it first came out; prior to evolving to meditation and to watch it again all these years later I was surprised and was like ""damn, that's just like when I meditate"". During meditation the 3rd eye visual of moving through space is very much like a light show as it was in the movie.

Everything works in this film building the characters and suspense to a climax that is interesting and satisfying.  I love the hopelessly driven scientist Foster plays, pursuing her vision in a quest that everyone tells her is pointless and the suspense that relentlessly builds as her vision comes true and then takes on a life of its own well beyond her control. Even the unfulfilled romance with Matthew McConaughey is fascinating with surprising chemistry between the actors and filled with the seductive philosophical conundrum of faith vs fact fueling the magnetic attraction and separation of the lovers.

That having been said, if you're a Christian be prepared to be portrayed as a slavering fanatic. I happen to know that Sagan had little respect for people of faith (Christians are by far the safest to criticize because we're not likely to cut someone's head off for doing so!) and I don't know if the book was more respectful than the movie but my skin is thick and other than that I thought it a pretty good movie. I found the Haddon character very intriguing. Too bad his part was so small. The circus that followed  the discovery of the message from the aliens was exactly what one would expect, and the posturing of the politicos is as laughable in the movie as it is in everyday life.",1368144000,,853,4.33125

Its so vast and amazing it boggles the human mind. Planet earth is a spec of dust within it all, yet we humans are so pompous we actually find it difficut to believe there is other life out there. But not Ellie(Jodie Foster). She had the faith to believe in such possibilites, and by sticking with her hope she discovers the greatest breakthrough in human history, and was then left to stand aside while goverment scrutiny and red tape made their own decisions and not for the best. In the end Ellie gets her chance to visit another world, and as the audience we get to experience a magical spectacle rarely seen in cinema. Contact represents one of the finest science fiction experiences that can be imagined. This is a solid motion picture masterpiece that I have personally seen several times and it takes my breath away just a little more with each viewing. This film often rises above the masterful sci-fi achievements of Kubricks 2001: A space oddesssey some 30 years later. Indeed a cinematic experience rarely achieved to this degree. Jodie Foster once again proves what a truly talented actress she really is. Along for the experience are some gifted actors like Tom Skerrit, James woods, Mathew McConaughey, and even Bill Clinton signed on to play him self in this truly epic motion picture. There is a sub story here that is truly interesting also. Should someone who doesnt believe in the existance of God be allowed to travel 20,000,000 light years into space to make contact with an alien existance? Though I believe in god, I don't think its an issue at all. This is truly a spectacular and powerful movie experience that represents the best in science fiction story telling.

The movie keeps your attention for the whole duration of the film and comes with a suprising ending.",1366156800,,319,4.213114754098361
94977,5,0790733226,"Contact has big ambitions and satisfies most of them and entertains the rest. To start it is based upon a novel by Carl Sagan and he is able to give the science fiction aspect of the film credibility from his own insight in the science community. The film depicts quite well the drive and determination the scientists must possess just to be able to work in their chosen fields and the way that politics comes into play to create hurdles and roadblocks. Interlaced within the science film is the human story of personal tragedy, discovery and betrayal. This is not explored to create in depth character studies but just enough to make the audience care about the characters. The one angle of the film that I find most compelling is the struggle between religious faith and scientific discovery. This is not so far-fetched, recall that Copernicus theory of the universe was banned by the church and that he delayed publication of his work until after his death for fear of excommunication and execution.
The casting and the acting were top notch Jodie Foster (Elle Arroway)carried the dedicated scientist role believably well in what would have been a male role in most movies. Elle is far from a perfect character she has faults and flaws aplenty, she has issues with closeness and being able to see anothers viewpoint. You can see here struggle for truth whatever it is from others and herself. Her life is dedicated to searching for evidence of the unknown and proving irrefutably the truth in it.  Matthew McConaughey (Palmer Joss)was perfect in the traditional female role of the would be love interest that just so happens to show up whenever a tender moment is required and who though drawn to Elle he is spiritually and philosophically her polar opposite. His life is driven by faith knowing that cannot be proven but he believes it with all his heart.
I think one of the things I like most about the film is that it asks more questions than it answers. There is no attempt to paint Elle as a perfect character that will save the day, or to say yes there are aliens and they are here to harvest us or give us better iPods. More so the film asks What if? And if so how would you react?",1366156800,,2191,4.603580562659847

94980,5,0790733226,"This is one of my favorite movies OF ALL TIME. It's a movie about science, religion, faith, love, first contact, fanaticism, politics, money, genius, and intolerance.  It's a thoughtful film that's not afraid to confront not only what it might feel like to communicate with an alien race, but whether we are mature enough to handle such an event.

I won't describe the plot--enough reviews have done that already. Here are, however, the reasons I think you will love this movie:

1) IT'S A THRILLING ADVENTURE STORY: There is tension present throughout this movie, some of it represented by the big questions below, but a lot of it is because of the excitement of discovery. When early on in the movie radio astronomer Ellie Arroway (Jodi Foster) receives the radio signal from outside our galaxy, the movie kicks into high gear. Not only are they hustling to clarify the message signal, but they also have to decode it to discover an amazing set of what appear to be BLUEPRINTS...but for what?

2) IT HAS A GREAT PEDIGREE: The original book is by scientist Carl Sagan, and it went through many changes in its almost decade-long development.  Directed by Robert Zemeckis (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flight/dp/B00BB8RKH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flight</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cast-Away/dp/B0026O475M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cast Away</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forrest-Gump/dp/B0035JRVBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forrest Gump</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gothika/dp/B001PSGF3C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gothika</a>), it has quite a cast: besides Foster, there's Matthew McConaughey, James Woods, Tom Skerritt, William Fichtner, John Hurt and Angela Bassett - all in top form.

3) IT ASKS BIG QUESTIONS: What will happen to individuals, the country, and the world, when we finally contact alien life?  Are we mature enough as a society not to go off the deep end? How will discovery of another intelligent species change our attitude about God, Heaven, and our place within His universe? How will our political system react to science issues concerning national security?

4) IT TAKES SCIENCE AND RELIGION SERIOUSLY: It's rare that a movie, or book, treats both of these subjects with care and sincerity. While the plot includes religious zealots who are definitely there to derail any somber efforts to follow the blueprints, McConaughey's Father Palmer is portrayed with genuine intelligence. This is NOT the McConaughey who so frequently plays the stoner dude in so many movies - no, this is the sober actor who once in a while gives us the potential he in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Time-to-Kill/dp/B001ARNNC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Time to Kill</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frailty/dp/B0088C2VWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frailty</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lincoln-Lawyer-HD/dp/B008Y73940/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lincoln Lawyer [HD</a>]. His Father Palmer is an advisor to the President, and it's a role that really lends gravity to the religious side of the discovery. I'm not especially religious, but I'm open enough to have movies portray religion at its best in order to increase the seriousness of the debate.

Note: As for drawbacks, the movie does run a little long, and there is one plot development late in the film - I won't spoil it here, but it involves a backup plan that comes out of nowhere - that defies credulity. But they're just tiny flaws in the masterpiece, as they say, and in no way hurt this terrific, wonderful, intellectual movie.",1365897600,,3838,6.3795761078998074

95080,5,0790733226,"One of the most important aspects of a movie, or a book for that matter, is 'replay' value. Can you watch a movie more than once and still get something out of it? Can you read a book more than once and get something from it?

""Contact"", the movie, seems to meet the criteria for replay value, at least for me. I have seen it possibly a dozen times, and I have enjoyed it every time.

There are criticisms that it isn't like the book by Carl Sagan. The same can be said of many movies. I haven't read the book yet, so I cannot address this.

What I can address is why I find this movie consistently entertaining and would recommend it.

Acting:

The actors are all pretty convincing and do a memorable job.

Jodi Foster carries the film as Ellie Arroway with believability and a great humanity. In the scene where she is about to launch in the ""machine"", she shows a considerable amount of nervousness and even fear. Given the character's situation, I'd say, YES! I'd be scared out of my mind! It wouldn't stop me, but I'd still be scared. She also shows vulnerability as her character gets tossed over by political rivals, especially the Tom Skerritt character.

Tom Skerritt delivers a fine performance as the smarmy intellectual uber scientist David Drumlin who seems to have made it is personal quest to defeat Jodi Foster's character at every turn. He is so unlikeable, just short of being a villain.

Matthew McConaughey plays Palmer Joss with excellent patience and sensitivity. His sexual interest in Arroway is obvious from the start, and when she basically abandons him early in the film, he doesn't really hold it against her. It does come as a surprise when during the selection hearings for who is to go visit the aliens, he sidewinds her. Fortunately, the script is sympathetic enough to have him explain his real motivations were selfish, he wants her to stay around as his love interest, even though she is often not there for him.

John Hurt as S.R. Hadden is a delight. He's confident and a real ""angel"" in the financial sense. He supports Ellie brilliantly throughout the film, and he has a cynicism that is fun to watch.

The other actors ( and there are many!) are also very good and deliver fine and believable performances.

The film is worth a look just for their acting craft.

Another plus in the movie is the musical score by Alan Silvestri. He really knows how to make the most of the simplest melodies, and his score is understated, gentle and just wonderful to hear.

Finally, the sets and graphics are very good to excellent. The design of the 'machine' is suitably pseudo scientific and looks serious enough, and the outer space scenes are top notch. In this movie, getting there really is half the fun!

For all these reasons, the film is very entertaining.

Now, as to the ""message"".

Yes, the movie does try to pit science against religion, or vice versa. It's an argument that is getting so old it is almost cliche. No one seems to ever try the middle of the road where the two can work together, religion reveals mystery, science attempts to explain mystery.

And it is because of the all black/white polarization that some of the plot and dialog miss the boat for me.

I like the line where Palmer asks Ellie, ""Did you love your father, prove it."" It is a valid argument because love is something that pure scientific inquiry cannot yet prove or measure or replicate. It is a mystery. That doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

There is a point in the film where during the selection process, they ask Ellie if she believes in God. Of course, she has to hem and haw and finally say she cannot prove God. So, of course, she is disqualified because ""95% of the population of the Earth do believe in God"".

If the film wasn't trying to make such an antagonistic argument between science and religion, it could have had Ellie respond in the most logical way. She could have responded: ""I personally do not because I cannot find proof to my satisfaction. However, as a representative of the people of Earth, I would tell the aliens that 95% of humanity does believe in a God. And as a scientist, I would ask them, what they believe."" The script doesn't allow this common sense response, and it was a bit disappointing.

The faith vs. evidence argument is played out again after Ellie has returned from her journey and cannot prove that she has been anywhere. The film only leaves us with a question about 18 hours of static on the video recording device. However, what happened to the science here?

If it seems like Ellie didn't go anywhere, and the 'machine' is still working just fine, why not send her or someone else on another trip? In other words, do what scientists are supposed to do, replicate the experiment. How they missed this is beyond me. It seemed so obvious!

Conclusion:

In spite of the muddy message of the movie, it is very well produced, well acted, has great sets and shows considerable restraint for a scifi movie. It is not an 'action thriller', it is thought provoking. It has great music and is an overall enjoyable experience. The 'message' and philosophical arguments are a bit too one dimensional to really hold weight, and the use of common sense would have made it a better script, but it wouldn't have the political and emotional tug that they got out of it. Still, its a movie I can watch over and over and still enjoy.

That to me, is the sign of a truly good film.",1362182400,,5428,4.553956834532374

95117,4,0790733226,"If you can imagine ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Armageddon/dp/B00000G3PA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Armageddon</a>"" without the action you'd have a pretty good idea of ""Contact."" Perhaps this is because they both hail from the late 90s (""Contact"" came out the summer of '97 and ""Armageddon"" a year later). Toss in some elements of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-The-Motion-Picture-The-Director-s-Cut-Two-Disc-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00005JKHP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek: The Motion Picture- The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)</a>"" and -- voila -- you have ""Contact."" Not that it doesn't possess its own uniqueness, of course.

The story has to do with an astronomer (Jodie Foster) finding conclusive radio evidence of extraterrestrial life. The intelligence -- whatever it is -- then sends data on how to meet, but only one person can go.

Foster's character is an atheistic scientist while her romantic interest in the story believes in God (Matthew McConaughey). The respectful tension of these two mindsets in the face of extraterrestrial contact is interesting and the filmmakers do a good job of maintaining a balance between the two, rather than advocating one above the other. Generally speaking, science and religion both pursue truth (the way it really is) but their methods differ, science stresses empirical evidence whereas religion looks to faith and love. Why can't we embrace both? (What a revolutionary idea!)

Both vantage points are portrayed by people who are genuine and honest about their pursuit of truth. Between them is the character of David Drumlin (played excellently by Tom Skerritt) who is driven by selfish ambition and therefore willing to put on airs to attain his goals. But corruption comes at a price.

The film is based on Carl Sagan's book of the same name. The balance in the film between fact and faith, atheism and belief can be attributed to Sagan's spiritual agnosticism. He rejected the arrogance of atheism and has stated: ""Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light-years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual."" Although I'm not a disciple of Sagan I appreciate his humility, genius and honest reflections on the awesomeness and beauty of the universe and all it's mysteries. The movie conveys this.

The film runs two and a half hours.

95214,4,0790733226,"I read some reviews here and elsewhere which warned that the image quality of Contact on Blu-ray is substandard. However, I do not find that to be the case. Since I now have both the Blu-ray and DVD, I can see just how bad the DVD print is, full of picture noise and compression artifacts. The color also doesn't look quite right in places. The Blu-ray image, while not reference quality, is a very good transfer which, while cleaning up the image considerably, also retains much of the natural graininess of the film. For the most part, colors are strikingly vibrant without looking over-saturated. The aspect ratio also seems correct (i.e., no vertical stretching). On a properly-calibrated TV, this looks vastly superior to the DVD print. And the sound is just fantastic.

Unfortunately, the bonus material leaves a lot to be desired. Although the short-and-small computer animation featurettes from the DVD are retained, they look terrible. Also, I didn't find the extensive text-only production notes from the Special Edition DVD on this Blu-ray.

A low price makes an upgrade from DVD more than worthwhile. Although this excellent movie deserves a better overall treatment, I find the quality of the movie itself on Blu-ray to be praiseworthy.",1358812800,3,1249,5.058252427184466

Jodie Foster's aural delivery is superb.  You can almost believe that such conversation actually happened, if a bit dramatised.  Several visual sequences are stunning, although I have no idea whether special effects broke any ground.  What I like best in visual effects are the rhythm and montage.  Several unforgettable cuts literally take my breath away.

The romance between the priest and Jodie's character is a bit artificial nearly from the beginning to the end, despite the excellent depiction of their conflict and resolution.  Although the narrative of the movie is not tied to this romance, a great deal of dialogues do derive from the relationship.  So this is a rather big defect.  The scene in the remote galaxy also feels forced and dry.  I'd rather it be shortened to allow development of her relationship.  Another weak story is the farce around ""International Selection Committee.""  There is nothing international in the committee, but lots of important drama have to come from that story.  Since the rest of ""flying machine"" story is so U.S. centric, it may as well show chauvinism all the way through.

95407,5,0790733226,"The film, Contact, spends nearly as much time debating faith versus science, and whether the two can co-exist, as it does in exploring the possibility of extraterrestrial life.  For this reason, not all science fiction fans will love the movie as much as I did.  Jodie Foster (as Ellie)turned in one of her typically stellar performances, and her transformation from a strict ""Just the facts, please"" scientist to a woman who accepts faith's role in the building of the universe was believable and moving, and it really resonated with me.  Matthew McConnaughey, on the other hand, was horribly miscast as Foster's religious and intellectual counterpart and as her sort-of love interest.  Fortunately, he kept his usual smarmy smirking acting technique to a minimum.

I love the opening of the film which portrays a gradual pullback from a point on Earth to a faraway point in the universe before the visual zooms back into the eye of Foster's character as a child.  I can watch this scene over and over.

Side note with a SPOILER:  I originally saw this film with two friends in the theater when it was released in 1997.  At the conclusion, both made comments about how bizarre it was that Ellie's father was on another planet.  Whaaaat???  I didn't understand how they could possibly have reached that conclusion, especially since the dialogue spoon feeds us the explanation for the alien's appearance.  I thought these two friends were the only people who could possibly have missed this, but in reading through some of the reviews and comments here, I see they were not alone!",1348444800,,1579,4.894736842105263

95410,5,0790733226,"Since I am a fan of science fiction as well as science fact this movie proved to be a great one for me. Jodie Foster is wonderful as the doctor who using SETI finds a signal from a distant galaxy. She finds herself ultimately building a machine that transports her to the source of the signal. On the planet she meets an alien who assumes the physical shape of her late father.

She realizes that of course it isn't her father, but has so many questions she wants answered, that she goes along with the created scene. Her time is limited and soon she is sent back to Earth only to find that in Earth time she has been gone mere seconds, not hours or days. A controversy erupts decrying her claim that she actually WAS where she said she was. For those who haven't seen the movie I won't spoil the ending.

What isn't mentioned anywhere in the film is that Carl Sagan and his wife were responsible for it's creation but he passed on before it was completed. During the film there are instances of a reverse letter ""C"" being formed by popcorn spilled on the floor, when Jodie's father dies. Then again in the grains of sand the alien holds when they meet. Again in the sky above the alien planet and at the end when Jodie sits on a cliff overlooking the canyon and sunset. What does it mean?

The reversed ""C"" shape in the movie is a representation of the constellation ""Corona Borealis"" it was Carl Sagan's favorite because it looks like a radio telescope dish! The end credit's say ""For Carl"" and indeed Carl has a presence throughout the film with the these references to his constellation.

Coupled with a wonderful score by Alan Silvestri this movie is a home run in my book.

On a purely technical note, in the film, Dr. Arroway (Foster), as a child, is an amateur radio operator as I am. It shows her using the radio and calling ""CQ"" a general call for anyone to answer. But then she keeps saying ""come back"".... this is slang used only by CB radio operators and is rarely if ever used by amateurs with any experience.",1347235200,,2023,4.384
95411,4,0790733226,"I liked the movie overall.  The one thing that I would like to discuss is the whole religion aspect.  I think this movie is more ""about"" religion vs science, than anything else.  Even extra-terrestrial contact and the ensuing politics comes a distant second.

Carl Sagan was supposedly an agnostic so I think that he was personified by the main character (Dr. Ellie Arroway), who seemed to doubt a supreme being herself.  Watching his series COSMOS, Carl iterates over an over that our civilization would have advanced much more than it did -- if it wasn't for the fact that, at every turn in our history, scientific progress and critical thinking has been stalled, halted, or even set back centuries by religious dunderheads too comfortable in their religious worldview to accept new information.

I wonder if he made the religious characters in this movie so unbearably annoying because he was, to a similar degree, personally annoyed with religion in the real, nonfiction world.  I'm not going to tell you my personal views or whether I agree or disagree with [what I perceive as] Carl's annoyance at religion... because this review is about my thoughts on Contact and it's author; not about me.

This movie has a strong undertone -- A theme that tries to remain subtle, but shines through clearly whether it was intended to or not by the director:  This undertone is all about the battle between (1) sound scientific reasoning and logic (and 2) the single-minded agenda of science deniers that defend their own beliefs, even against facts themselves.

The religious characters in this movie are depicted as naive and gullible characters that are too clouded in their own superstition to see reason.  I like this excerpt of dialog from the movie (little spoiler):

~~~~
Palmer Joss: Our job was to select someone to speak for everybody. And I just couldn't in good conscience vote for a person who doesn't believe in God. Someone who honestly thinks the other ninety five percent of us suffer from some form of mass delusion.
Ellie Arroway: I told the truth up there. And Drumlin told you exactly what you wanted to hear.
~~~~

Who is right or wrong?  I guess it depends on your own worldview.  When I was younger (years ago), I remember watching this movie and definitely agreeing with one of them; and now that I'm older I re-watched this same movie agree with the opposing character.  I liked the movie equally well when each viewing (separated by years of course), since the movie does a pretty good job of raising both sides arguments without sounding like it's definitively rooting for either.

****** Now, this next part has a bit of a spoiler so don't read it if you don't want to ruin the movie ******

In the end, the movie portrays a sense of balance -- that neither side is necessarily 100% right or 100% wrong when (1) the main religious figure (Palmer Joss), does in fact exhibit the redeeming quality of being open to the possibility that Ellie Arroway is telling the truth, and (2) the main secular figure (Ellie Arroway) ironically shows ""faith"" in that she truly believes (despite no empirical evidence) that her personal experiences were real and not a delusion; and she also bequests her opponents to have faith in her as well.

Finally, there is just one big plot hole in my mind (also a spoiler):

If nobody believed her, then why didn't someone else just go in the machine again and verify it?  Perhaps not using a WIRELESS camera this time...",1346976000,3,3469,4.7675585284280935

In this film adaptation (sort of), Carl Sagan imagines what first contact with an alien species would be like, given everything that was currently known about actual science and astronomy. Without giving too much away, the movie pulls it off magnificently, going through everything imaginable about the response to alien contact: decryption, mathematics, politics, military (US mostly) concern, religious fervor, some of the crazies, human brilliance and idiocy, and still manages to strike an emotional cord with the main characters. It doesn't attempt to guess what aliens would look like or their capability, leaving that unknown element as it should be: unknown.

It's not all perfect, there's some lack of elegance in some of the writing and dialogue, and the ending in the court room could have been tightened up around Ellie's experience, but overall it's imaginatively written without assuming anything, and makes great points about how human reaction and the value of ""non-practical"" fields of science, given the interconnectedness of all the different sectors.

Moving on. I can't analyze all the big theories and allegories this movie undoubtedly has. I'll leave that to people who claim to be experts in the fields of space stuff and God stuff. Or movie stuff. I can however say for the moderately inquisitive and curious readers and watchers of sci-fi, who hope that the center of the universe isn't our little marble, and maybe, just maybe, there's room for more people and maybe even a deity out there, that this was a pleasant movie if you can get past all that bile-raising stuff. Sagan wasn't so much as educating the uneducated as bashing and berating those who do not agree with him. I think he had the opposite effect, unless that was his sole intention, to seem small minded and angry. If I make a movie about space, hope, and the future I'll probably try to not degrade over half the people of my planet and fill it full of politics and hate.
It kind of makes me think if there were someone else out there they'd watch how we belittle each other (as per this movie) and pass right on by.

But it gets an ""A"" for effort. I'll take away this part of the movie (unless I made it up myself). The future could use more open minded and enthusiastic hopeful people.",1337644800,2,1277,4.316666666666666
95454,5,0790733226,"The story was written by Carl Sagan and his wife, and shows it. Deeply embedded in the story and the visual images and even certain lines of dialog is the spirit of Carl Sagan. He lives forever in the changes he brought about in his world.

Jodie Foster plays Dr. Ellie Arroway, who is passionately pursuing SETI - the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence. As you probably know, lots of people consider it a huge waste of time, and lots more consider it a security risk. Then there are those who consider it blasphemy. All these viewpoints are represented in the film, along with the courage of scientific research and liberal theology. The latter is represented by Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey, quite delicious), religious philosopher and writer, and Ellie's lover and number one fan.

Her number one financial backer is a mysterious billionaire named Dr. S.R.Haddon, a colorful figure to say the least, who made me think of Captain Nemo. He lives in an airplane, and seldom lands it. Her primary nemesis is Dr. David Drumlin, who first has her funding cut and then, when she finds unmistakably artificial signals, takes credit for the project and hogs the limelight.

I'm not going to spoil too much in telling you that the signal includes detailed plans to build some sort of machine, nobody is quite sure what it's supposed to do. But a great deal is made of the fact that it seems like a vehicle of some sort, and only room for one person. Who will represent the entire human race to some completely unknown aliens? The government sets up a commission to make the decision, and Palmer Joss, as a close friend of President Clinton's (who appears in the movie, presumably with carefully edited stock footage), is included in the commission. Does he pick Ellie to go, knowing she may well not survive, or not be able to come back, or come back something over 50 years later, not having aged appreciably while he becomes an old man? She wants to go so very much, but then so do quite a few other qualified scientists, and also Dr. David Drumlin, Mr. Limelight Hog.

The reasons for the commission's decision may depress the heck out of you; they did me. The stunning act of sabotage that threatens the whole mission is also depressingly realistic. In fact, good parts and bad, this movie is disturbingly realistic. But like Carl Sagan himself, the end result is optimism and faith in human reason.",1336867200,,2407,4.737470167064439

So when I gaze into the starry heavens at the countless suns of space, I marvel at how seemingly insignificant it would superficially appear that our planet is and yet just as this movie highlighted the important role that faith plays whether in regards to believing in a Higher Power or believing in the existence of alien beings far removed from our galactic proximity, I do have faith that our sphere (Urantia) is just as precisely administered and just as lovingly fostered as if it were the only inhabited world in all existence.",1330992000,3,1997,5.110091743119266
95527,5,0790733226,"I am always a fan of character-driven movies, and they are rare in the sci-fi/fantasy genres. This movie is really the best of both worlds.

The transformation of Jodie's character through the movie is subtle and heart-breaking. It's hard to imagine who else could have come close to pulling off this role as she did. Sci-Fi movies of course never win best actor/actress awards, but she was nominated for Golden Globe for this role.

There is an interesting article about this film on Wikipedia, that discusses the ""screen-writing hell"" the film ended up in for years. Multiple directors, a parade of writers that came and went... And the film is flawed, no doubt. (The main antagonist, played by the wonderfully slimy Tom Skerritt, dies half way through the film.) But the acting is wonderful all around.

I bought the movie on DVD, and watched the lengthy special mini-documentary about the making of the film. The vast majority of the special effects shots in the movie are not in the more sci-fi scenes, but in the normal, day-to-day scenes -- a crane shot of her house as a young child that zooms in and pushes right through the window into the room where shes sitting, for example (the window wasn't there, of course: the window, the trees reflecting in it and even the finger prints on it were all animated).

In my review I don't wish to say too many things about the technical aspects of the movie. I think that, style-wise, this is classic grand epic cinema, with large shots, larger music, a real treat in my eyes.

I wish to put another point of view into the discussion of the movie's portrayal of science versus religion. Many of the reviewers seem frustrated by the, what they consider, ambiguity the movie holds towards this question, which they feel is significantly different than the balance in the book. I have a very different opinion about this.

I am, I should say, completely atheist. I am also a social scientist. This movie, in my opinion is a one of a kind social science fiction movie. The contact with extraterrestrial beings is the premise, but the real story is that of human society and the reaction to the contact. Sagan, atheist himself, devoted much of his life to try to educate people about science, and about understanding religion from a social history perspective, not as a relevant tool to understand the material world today. In Cosmos, Sagan explores the reactions of human society and social structures to a possible contact. Unfortunately, we still live in a very backwards, religious society, and this is what the movie shows. The focus on religious dilemmas in light of the first contact is unfortunately very likely to happen in such case. The impossible position that Foster's character finds herself at the end does not leave the ""science vs religion"" debate open handed, as we learn that the evidence which proves her main argument (that she experienced 14 hours in what seemed like a fraction of a second), and shows how it is being hushed by the government.

In another book, Sagan wrote of the ""demon-haunted world"", and traced the struggles of scientists to stand by the evidence in a repressively religious environment. Contact, the book and the movie, puts forth an argument that today, in many ways, we still live in a demon-haunted world, in which the role and social power of religion is much too strong.",1328745600,,2068,4.84985835694051

95558,5,0790733226,"CONTACT is an excellent sci-fier based on a Carl Sagan story and directed by Bob Zemeckis that deftly considers not only the possibility of life elsewhere but also both sides of the eternal debate on whether there's a Divine Being.

It stars Jodie Foster as a scientist who tenaciously clings to her SETI explorations despite obstacles and resistance from her boss (Tom Skerritt). Just before the plug is pulled and Foster's Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence team is evicted from Socorro, NM's Very Large Array radio astronomy observatory, they get a hit. Monitored signals originating from the Vega constellation send a mix that includes a 1936 TV broadcast from Nazi Germany of the Berlin Olympics, the first high-powered signals of such a type. These apparently took 26 years to reach Vega, and 26 years to be bounced back.

Not as a criticism of the plot, but this raises a question in my mind. I know little of physics, so it'll probably sound as dumb as I am on the subject. If there's nothing in the universe that's perpetual, including energy, how can a radiowave, which is a sort of energy (yes?), travel billions of miles without dissipating?

Anyway, news of this discovery brings out the lunatic fringe, each group converging on Socorro, all with different agendas. Most amusing are the Chevy Vega car clubs; most frightening, some scruffy Neo-Nazis and a raving ""end-of-the-world"" proselytizer.

When sub-frequncies are unscrambled and a language decoded, scientists are able to construct a one-person craft (from instructions sent by an unknown ET) that will instantly transport a passenger across the universe. Unseen events occur and Jodie is the one selected to make this voyage.

A ""traveling through a wormhole"" sequence is terrific and quite scary. Jodie arrives safely on a planet somewhere in Vega. The next scene is so obviously foreshadowed early in the film the alert viewer is expecting it, and yet I found the experience to be very emotionally stimulating. In hindsight, it occurred to me that we were SUPPOSED to know what's coming. Not being caught off-guard is what makes the moment so satisfying.

Bottom line is: I love this movie. See it, by ALL means!

95561,5,0790733226,"I've viewed this film countless times. Each time I watch this movie, I'm left wondering how Contact is time and time again glossed over and seemingly forgotten. It's a true work of art; a beautiful, inspiring, self-affirming and hope filled tale of one woman's ambitious spiritual and scientific journey through the monumental discovery of alien life. This film does not pander to the blockbuster Michael Bay super-explosion loving crowd of ""aliens vs humans'' plotlines that seem to dominate sci-fi, it's much deeper than that. This film is about how little, insignificant and infantile we are as a species, and how there may be millions of advanced creatures out there willing and ready to guide us through our evolution as a species if only we can find a way past all the troubling and petty politics and be receptive to them. Contact also expertly intertwines the seemingly contradictory doctrines of science and faith, and in the end shows how having a little bit of both may be the answer to the human experience.

What makes this film is the incredible performance of Jodie Foster and the emotionally resonant plot that humanizes her weaknesses as explainable personal tragedies early in her life. The culmination of the long and powerful story is one of the most beautiful and artistically vibrant scenes in any film I've ever seen. Truly, it's moved me to tears. I can count the number of films that have done this on one hand.

I have NO IDEA why this film has received so little recognition, whether on top all-time Sci-Fi films or top movies in general. The great Carl Sagan's brilliant story is brought to life in a semi-realistic portrayal of what would happen if a message from an alien species was ever received in modern times.

95562,4,0790733226,"Fraught with controversies and lawsuits, misinformation, outright lies; it's a miracle of stubbornness that this film ever got made and has such a devoted (overprotective) following.  Personally, I don't know what to make of this film.  It frustrates and annoys me and yet I found it absolutely absorbing, something I couldn't turn away from, even at its lowest ebb.  At all times it is entertaining.  But it is also manipulative, filled with stock character types rather than genuine people, and a story that is obvious; nothing truly surprised me about this film.  And yet, I still liked it.  I'm trying to figure out why.
The opening sequence is magical in its simplicity and beauty.  It gives one pause to wonder.  Unfortunately, how and why we wonder is soon taken away from us by a story that literally maps out exactly what we should feel, when, and why.  Allowing us to arrive at our own conclusions was taken away, I find that galling and not a little insulting.  I was also put off by the heavy handed way in which religion was presented (making Christians either lunatics or self-righteous nitwits).  This was less a story about discovery and more about the politics that might surround such an incredible occurrence.  All the fringe ugliness dampened whatever enthusiasm would be inherent in such a life altering moment.  This is a great idea, mishandled.  Why the botched ""contact"" moment?  Why all the nastiness with James Woods maniacal character?  If you want to tarnish and kill an ending, that's the way to do it!
On the other hand....there is that magnificent performance by Jodie Foster (and Jena Malone) as Dr. Eleanor Arroway.  John Hurt was bizarre (in a good way) as the mysterious S.R. Hadden.  It was so nice to see David Morse play something other than a bad guy, the same goes for William Fichtner.
In the end, I find myself justifying why I liked this movie in spite of all its negative points (that would include Jake Busey & Rob Lowe).  I think that what I liked most was the notion that this could be possible, and wouldn't it be great if it was.  I think that for a film to inspire that (hope) is something special in itself.

I had read the book, and although obviously there had to be some changes, I thought in general it stayed faithful to the spirit of Carl Sagan. It's good to see a science-fiction movie in which battles with aliens isn't the main theme.

One thing surprises me. Although I haven't plowed through all the reviews, nobody seems to have commented on an allusion which I thought was fairly obvious (and is also in the book). Ellie encounters her 'father', who tells her that he has taken this form because it would make her feel more comfortable. He then goes on to say that it has always been done this way. Now, that seems to me to be very sensible; if you wanted to arrange to meet another type of life-form, the best way to do it without provoking alarm would be to adopt the same corporeal form as those whom you going to contact. The suggestion that it has 'always been done this way'.... well, maybe it has, except that it was on this planet. I'd find that logical and perhaps that was what the movie and Sagan were suggesting.

It would be far more logical for an advanced alien civilization to adopt that strategy than for an all-powerful deity to do so, wouldn't it?",1309996800,,1247,4.417391304347826

I'm sure she would not have come . . . but for Matthew Mcconaughey.  Well, we both loved it.  The story is great - it is a plot you can really immerse yourself in.  Passion, religion, science, deception - its all here. And it makes you think about the big questions.  What is out there?  Are we alone?  Is the universe just an awful waste of space?  It is not just a science film, but about much more.

I have seen this film many many times now, and it never loses it luster.  That is the mark of a good film to me. One that you find laying on a Saturday afternoon, and you watch it  . . again and again., even though you know it by heart.

Jodi Foster is excellent as usual as a frustrated scientist listening to signals coming to Earth from Space in hopes of possibly finding proof of intelligent life in outerspace. Matthew McConaughey plays a very liberal preacher who isn't such a believer in her work but seems to like her very much. She's all science, he's all religion, so there's friction for a sort of attraction as a subplot.
When a signal comes to her crew from outer space, she of course wants to follow the instructions in the message to build a device/portal to take her to the originators of the message. Add in government interference, a rich old eccentric man who supports her, and a crazy religious zealot who opposes science at any cost and you've got a good movie.

Contact is a difficult film to review. Based on Carl Sagan's serenade novel to the stars, the ambitious, and occasionally moving, story of Ellie Arroway taps into the romance of stargazing but fails to explore the larger implications of the Pandoras Box it opens. Like a black sheep family member, I really can't hate this film, but it is also so difficult to love it.

In many ways Contact is a concept film - a ""what if"" statement on a slice of Kubrick's 2001: A Spacey Odyssey. ""What if"" somebody made an entire film on somebody discovering the monolith from 2001? ""What if"" the monolith and signal is a radio transmission telling us how to construct an advanced piece of technology? ""What if"" we ditch the stark soundtrack of deep breathing sounds and add pulsing radio transmissions, romance and a sad story of a little girl losing her dad? This is the movie Contact is. On paper, it all sounds so interesting, but somehow it all goes very wrong.

Jodie Foster invests heavily in Ellie and so does the audience. She is stubborn, driven and also charismatic. What I am not persuaded by is the script's tacky father-daughter story laced so sloppily into the plot. What I feel, is there is a greater story to be mined here, but the father-daughter angle rings hollow. John Hurt is wasted as a Yoda inspired bald genius and every other character in the film seems recycled from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest institution staff. There are too many villains and the only supporting character with more than one dimension is Matthew McConaughey.  This is one of those movies where everybody is crazy and evil but Ellie.  Everybody knows better than Ellie - they know so much better, they do everything she says and in the end, still make her think she is crazy. Ellie discovers the sound, Ellie discovers the bomber, Ellie...well you get the idea.  All the males are paper cut out bastards and little old Ellie is the perpetual victim.  It is one of those movies where you are continually frustrated by the contrived characterizations and idiocy of the characters and writing rather than engaging into the story.  Yes it is one of those movies.

 The film is based largely on the idea and euphoria of discovery, but the film offers so little of it. Director Robert Zemeckis tries desperately to resolve questions about aliens and religion within the social conscious, but instead we are given long lectures, congressional testimonials and emotional schlock more fitting to the Young and the Restless. Like a bad episode to the TV series LOST, there are many exciting ideas in Contact but they end up flushed by filmmakers and writers who are afraid to take on these ideas, or even any of Carl Sagan's ingenuity or conjectures from the novel, with any seriousness or dedication. The filmmakers take the easy way out and play out melodrama instead of insight.  The novel's intricate plot is ditched for a ""are you kidding me?"" laugh-out-loud ""alien"" beach rendezvous and intelligent writing is ditched in favor of teary-eyed soliloquy to tug at your heart strings. The search for intelligent life in movies continues.

The finality doesn't do justice to Ellie Arroway any of the deep ideas proposed by the plot or ultimately to the intelligence of the audience. There is, however, one brief redemption. There is a moment in the film where Ellie is lying in the Plains of San Augustin under the VLA telescope listening to static. This is when the first pulse of the alien signal hits. Ellie's eyes grow large and so do ours. It is an incredible epoch. It is the only moment in the two and a half hour film where Contact actually makes some.",1294099200,3,3868,4.705621301775148

Supported by the mysterious multi-billionaire S.R. Hadden (John Hurt), will Ellie get her wish or is she a victim of Occam's razor.

Intriguing story based on a book by Carl Sagan; however, I never read the book to compare. The supposedly two-sided story that becomes two versions of the same argument is rather hokey and one-dimensional.

Occam's (or Ockham's) razor is a principle attributed to the 14th century logician and Franciscan friar William of Ockham.  Ockham was the village in the English county of Surrey where he was born.
The principle states ""Entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily.""

I have followed the film from the movies to Blu-ray and will probably watch it again when the re-master for 3D or whatever comes next.  However, the basic acting has not changed with any technical innovation.

95678,4,0790733226,"An exceptional looking Blu-ray, ""Contact"" tells the story of Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster)and the impact that her discovery of a message from an alien race impacts society. In essence ""Contact"" acts as both a literal title and a pun--the film is about contact between science and faith, between a woman who loses her family at a young age trying to reconnect in some little way with what's she lost and her unending faith that she will discover there IS life out there.

Working with authors Carl Sagan and Anne Druyan director Robert Zemeckis has refashioned the tale adding the character of David Drumlin (Tom Skerrit)as an adversary who dogs Ellie every step of the way pushing her further and further away from her opportunity to embrace her discovery. Featuring a terrific supporting cast ""Contact"" focuses more on the humanity rather than the hardware but deals with a number of complex themes in the process. Rather than focusing on a team that goes to meet the Vegans Zemeckis and screenwriters James V. Hart & Michael Goldberg elect to make one person go throwing the finale into question--again, it comes down to a matter of faith and Ellie believes.

The Blu-ray has all of the original extras that were on the 1997 DVD. While the transfer looks extremely good with nice detail, color and clarity. It appears to be digitally scrubbed though with a bit too much digital noise reduction used reducing the level of the detail in the process. Nevertheless, it does blow away the original DVD by leaps and bounds particularly the opening sequence as we look at the Earth following the radio waves as they leave our planet moving further and further away from our solar system.

""Contact"" is a very good if flawed film. The faith vs. science themes that were so prevelent in Sagan's book are still here but presented in a bit of a muddled fashion. There's zero chemistry on screen between Foster and McConaughey. David Morse brings a strong, quiet presence to his role as Ellie's father. The ending although it is touching and does provide a sense of closure (and while it does make sense in many respects) may feel like a cheat to some. I thought it worked quite well within the context of the film. Some of the story elements like the subplot involving a terrorist attack on the ""Machine"" and NASA are deftly handled--they could have been blown up (pardon the pun)into soap opera spectacle but Zemeckis plays it low-key. The other flaw is the time compression from discovery to execution; while it was essential to keeping the film moving forward it also makes everything seem as it it happens rather quickly.

Over all this is a exceptionally good looking Blu-ray and the fact that Warner has ported over all the DVD extras (something that many studios have chosen not to do)is a big plus as well. Highly recommended.",1256083200,3,2824,4.780737704918033

Post Script:- G'day to the two guys that left comments, Well I have my Blu-Ray, in nut shell it played well no problems, as you'd expect picture quality was totally acceptable, although I have watched some Blu-Ray movies that you can tell are really High Definition, sharp clean pictures where you can see the detail in the clothing the actors wear or the signs of age on an actors face, I didn't really pick that up with this release of Contact, don't get me wrong the Picture Quality was very good as was the sound, plenty of Base too, but I just felt the picture wasn't as sharp as I was kind of hoping, yet in some scenes you could tell an improvment in quality was evident, look...at the end of the day you're buying an improved version of this film, no doubt, and as a side note, I would love to see Zemeckis come up with a really good script in homage to Carl Sagan and come up with a story that follows on from where Contact finishes off....something that adventurous keeping special effects to a minimum, but a story that's scientifically as correct as possible thereby lending to being crediable, don't call it ""Contact II"" either, give the film a title thats different but at the same time clearly a follow on from Contact, and try to get Jodie Foster back too, I think that would be important.

There, that's my three cents worth...I loved Carl Sagan and his work his mind, this Film is an extention of all he was about!

This movie played well on a conventional TV, but did not hold up well on a LCD 52"" HDTV and upward compatible DVD player. If you really love this film the way I do, I would suggest definitely getting it in Blu Ray.

I can't say enough about what a fine job was done in making this film. Jodie Foster was able to perform in a totally synthetic environment while delivering (I think) one of her finest performances, delivering a breathless rapture suitable for the cosmic occasion presented. The computer graphics were the best and totally believable. Overall, the cast, direction, pacing, CGI were great and the special effects were meticulously done. The musical score and story were just great.

The film was dedicated to Carl Sagan who wrote the original book and helped with the screenplay and is a fine testimonial to the man.

I went to the single star reviews and found that this movie was rated as a stinker by a considerable number of people, some of which down rated it because of the compromises it made regarding the fact that Sagan was apparently a registered atheist! They appeared to be upset that this film made some kind of case for faith. It did not make a case for religion, however, and just implied that certain ""human experiences"" can never be proven to the satisfaction of a scientist.

The human condition of personal experience still exists, despite the condition described in the film as ""the self reinforcing delusion"". I started out in my early years as a strong faith based person, and now that I am a considerably older person find myself becoming more of an agnostic with time, despite the approach of mortality. I don't deny Hollywood the right to make a compromise between faith and evidence for marketing purposes, or whatever. I agree with the gist of the statement that Ellie made about her lack of belief in god. There is insufficient evidence for a scientist to prove either case.",1248307200,,1995,4.724137931034483

 The only thing I disliked about the movie was the scene where the two main characters were shoe-horned into the most tired and unenlightening discussion on science and religion ever -- the old ""We don't need God anymore, we've got science"" vs. ""Isn't it nicer to believe that there is a God?"" arguments.

95708,5,0790733226,"Now that I'm a LITTLE wiser, have come to realize this movie is absolutely profound.

Written by Carl Sagan, the great physicist of ""billions and billions"" fame, it is not only intelligent, but phenomenally so.

Reason? He addresses questions and issues within the movie that we don't realize are so important until we've been around a while and analyze our world's technological evolution.

ESPECIALLY our technological capacity and the implications and repurcussions.

Of course I could rave on about Jody Foster and Matthew McConaughey (never spell that right - sorry!)

Jody is totally lovable, likable, sympathetic and compelling. She is 100% convincing as a brilliant, uni-linearly focussed and isolated scientist. Her determination in the movie serves as model inspiration on how to succeed in the business world. She just won't give up.

Matthew is at his most magnetic. As he and Jody meet in a tropical cabana, you can feel the heat of his charm pop right through the screen. There's probably not a woman in the world who could have resisted in responding to him... except the wonderful character portrayed by Jody Foster.

It adds the perfect romantic tension.

Coupled with the extraordinary scenery, the absolutely soaring and magnificent musical score, CONTACT is one of the best movies ever made.

But, folks may not notice at first. So many thought-inspiring little things slip by, unnoticed. So, it's one of those movies that's gets better and better as we get older and wiser. The more we watch, the better it gets.

As a kid, we may have enjoyed it immensely. As an adult, it becomes a movie of great import and impact if you give yourself a chance to examine the science and forethought that went into the writing and making of this movie.

I wasn't quite sure about Carl Sagan, didn't know of him very well. But, now I can see he was one of those special geniuses who know so much more than one might have surmised. One of the world's truly great thinkers.

He wrote popular novels - perhaps that may have diminished his reputation as a world's great thinker type of scientist and pushed him into seeming  just another populistic author. He was also a television star with his own documentary.

Now I would like to see them... and have an opportunity to read his books.

In a separate review, I hope to address the final question posed within the latter parts of this movie. But here, I don't want to insert any spoilers.

The best way to watch this movie is from a clean start, and then watch again and again to get the full purported meanings.

95711,3,0790733226,"I think they definately should have stuck more closely to the source material. Ellie developing a sexual relationship with Palmer was really corny. I saw this movie once years ago, years before reading the book and I liked it alot then. But I just read the book a couple weeks ago, so I went back and bought this movie and realized how much they actually changed... for the worse.

The main thing that troubles me with this film is the theological aspects. I'm an atheist (I wasn't when I first watched the movie years ago, so I didn't catch all the religious overtones at first) and I felt kind of slighted at the treatment of the source material. The way they made Ellie seem like a bad person for being an atheist. Granted, in the real world that is likely how it would've played out, but I can't help but feel this movie had more of a pro-religion agenda.

The worst part of the film was definately the ending... If they had followed the book directly, the ending would've been much more dynamic. They also definately should've kept S.R. Hadden's ending. It was so cool, but instead in the book we just see S.R. Hadden's dead body being wrapped up. The book's ending was definately ten times more satisfying than the movie version's. All in all, I'd recommend this to others, but warning to those who have read the novel and loved it, you will be disappointed in this film, at least slightly.",1237766400,5,1396,4.513833992094861

Many other reviews have summed up the plot, so I see no reason to restate it here. What is so ghastly about the movies' conclusion is the premise that an intelligent, well-educated, experienced SCIENTIST; upon meeting an alien species is reduced to ""faith"" to explain what happened. I was almost physically ill. Faith is the ENEMY of science. It denies reason, ignores evidence, and accepts no criticism. To suggest that a scientist would throw away logic and reason in some sort of quasi-religious epiphany is not just stupid, it's insulting.
Do not buy this. Do not watch this.

95716,5,0790733226,"Looking back in time modern science fiction had one of its main scientists, writers, philosophers and visionaires in one name: Carl Sagan, the author of the novel in which is based the movie.

The making of the movie gives a very near and sub-realistic intent in the searching of ""green littles"", all right that maybe means ""live in Mars"", ""Aliens"" or just ""ET's"" but in a very intelligent secuence. Jodie Foster who interprets the scientist Eleanor Arroway and in along the movie is the principal character (since the beggining when she was a child), gives a very strong image to those scientists who believes in science and in themselves.

Another very strong mates in the movie are Matthew McConaughey as Palmer Josh, the religious adviser from the White House and the Arroway's semi-sentimental partner, but more impresive is how all the trama develops in a very realistic secuence and the world's looking for this kind of contact.

But seriously Carl Sagan let think us about a vision who can happen maybe in the future, all the elements are teorically logical and his arguments are facts that could impact forever in the human kingdom history. Too seriuos is the history that Robert Zemekis and crew recluted a lot of existent talents with their own live characters as like in first place the same President of the United States Bill Clinton, Larry King, Jay Leno, Geraldo Rivera, Geraldine Ferraro, Kathleen Kennedy and others who plays their role as the same real life.

But the rest of actors as Tom Skerritt, David Morse, James Woods, Rob Lowe, Angela Bassett (how you remembers me a lot to Mrs. Condoleeza Rice girl!) and John Hurt (impactant character for S.R. Hadden) gives more credibility to this genius and intrigant sci-fi state-of-art movie.

95717,1,0790733226,"Contact is avowed atheist Carl Sagan's glorious swan song, a brilliant treatment of the hypocrisy of religion and establishment. Jodie Foster is characteristically excellent as Dr. Ellie Arroway, the gifted astronomer whose discovery of an alien beacon sets off a frenzy for control of how the discovery should be handled.  Dr. Arroway is slapped down at every turn by those who do not appreciate her independent thinking. Her dilemma reflects the logical fallacy at the heart of all religion. When she will not accept on faith the ""truths"" imposed on her by religious zealots, she is denied the chance to be a part of a mission based on her research. Later, she is ridiculed for asking others to accept what she has seen with her own eyes.  Purists among us will quibble over some of the film's science, particularly in an early scene where Dr. Arroway, a brilliant mathemetician, miscalculates the odds of finding advanced civilizations in the universe by orders of magnitude. But the film has many worthy diversions. Matthew McConaughey, as Palmer Joss, is supposedly the good guy among the religious right. He is cunning and calculating, and like most religious fanatics, he is willing to do anything to get his way, especially if it includes a chance to punish nonbelievers. But Rob Lowe is priceless as Richard Rank, a thinly veiled version of Ralph Reed, a bigoted, hateful power monger who wields his flock as a sword to further his political interests.  Tom Skerritt's Dr. Drumlin lacks dimension, but is right on as the Machievellian politician exploiting Arroway's discovery. The supporting cast is sterling, including Angela Bassett, Jake Busey and David Morse, as Dr. Arroway's father. But the gem of the supporting cast is John Hurt. He is utterly magnificent as the ominous S. R. Hadden, the Howard Hughes-like scientist who lives on an airplane and funds the research that leads to the discovery of the alien signal.  Trivia note: one of Dr. Arroway's colleagues is Dr. Kent Clark, and I can't help but wonder what Sagan implies by that, aside from the obvious.  Far better than the typical Sci-Fi fare, Contact is a thoughtful and challenging look into the relationship between science and religion. It isn't hard, from watching the movie, to determine which side of the conflict Sagan came down on.",1224460800,10,2316,4.989637305699482

95719,2,0790733226,"For starters, it suffers from a common problem with modern movies: Carefully constructed political correctness. Most of the white males are over-reacting military men, not very bright political consultants, fundamentalist religious figures (some harmless except for being stupid, others terrorists), and scientists willing to take credit that rightly belongs to their female colleagues. Women and minorities, of course, are a different matter. The star is of course a brilliant female scientist. The most level-headed political advisor is a black female. The ""flight director"" for the machine is a black male.

But putting aside the political correctness, the element that really prevented me from enjoying this movie was Jodie Foster's performance. I guess it's really good acting. Her delivery is intense, passionate, and earnest. Really, really earnest. There are scenes where every muscle in her face is working overtime to express the -- well, earnestness of the character. Whether commanding her troops in the tracking station, dealing with less intelligent people in the multiple committee interrogation scenes, or repeating ""Okay to go"" over and over and over and over, she is -- really, really earnest. Watching her performance was literally fatiguing.

There was a minor character at the beginning of the movie, an Australian astronomer whom Foster's character contacts to confirm the signal they're tracking is real. He's much cooler and calmer than she is. I found myself thinking the movie would have been much easier to watch if he had been the main character.",1224374400,3,1574,5.44672131147541

I thought this was a very interesting movie and that it was made believable by the great performance of Jodi Foster. If another actress had tried to pull this off, it might not have worked.

This is not your usual ""contact with extraterrestrials"" movie. I think that's refreshing. In most movies with aliens, the aliens are either nice or evil but there is always the usual way the aliens meet us or us them. In this movie, Segan uses a different approach. We get some real science tossed in. Cosmos fans will undoubtedly recognize some of Sagan's lessons scattered here and there. So this is more like science probability than actual science fiction.

This is simply a movie that speculates about the events that will occur when humans discover that Earth is not the only planet with life in the cosmos and contact with that life is finally made.",1212364800,2,1018,4.582417582417582

Now, after purchasing this movie and having had the opportunity to sit and watch it again, I see that it truly is a work of art.

Jodie Foster does an amzing job in her role as the first person from our world to EVER make ""Contact.""  While many others shoot her thoughts, ideas, and hopes down throughout the movie, she never wavers once!  Standing firmly in her convictions as a scientist, she aims to make believers of us all.

Although I am not a big Matthew McConaughey fan, he does a solid job as Foster's polar opposite.  Another thing i liked is, although they are very opposite in opinions of the world, they can co-exhist and share one common thing: love.  Now, you may be thinking ""oh there's a love story here?""  Yes, but it never distracts from the overall story; and at a crucial part, even helps to enhance it further.

Very, very solid acting and storytelling in this one.  The directing is also some of the best I've seen.  Add this to the astounding special-effects used, and you have yourself a pretty good movie!

95760,5,0790733226,"Whenever I have a chance to look at the open clear skies at night, I always have a tingling sensation and wonder what do we have out there in this vastness, are there intelligent living things like us or even much superior than us out there.  It would be rather preposterous to presume that we're the only living thing existed in the whole universe.  As it is so well put in the movie that 'It would be such a waste, wouldn't it?'  This is why I am so fond of Jodie Foster's character in the movie; from a very young age, she is fascinated with the idea of receiving messages from intelligent living thing from outer space.  She has the support from her father but; unfortunately, he died when she is still very young. However, her interest remains unchanged and goes on to pursue her ambition and graduated with a doctorate in her desired field.  She has to go through adverse situations before she got her financial support from a prominent industrialist played by John Hurt.  She finally succeeded in receiving messages from a faraway place.  The messages she received is to build a machine but it is in code that no one can decipher.  Just as the hope of deciphering the blueprint is in vain, the industrialist summons her to his private plane and conveys the decoded chart to her.

You can imagine the discovery of this magnitude when made known to the world, what kind of commotion it would create.  From this climatic moment on there is no dull moment. You see the ambitious contest and opportunistic seizure by some scientist to gain recognition and the right to ride in the spacecraft, the wacky religious cultist and his bent on destruction, and all kinds of outlandish demonstrations of human irrational reactions.  In the end Jodie Foster gets to ride the spacecraft.

I don't want to spoil the fun of watching the movie yourselves, therefore, I'll leave it right here.  I guess I'm not the only one who got a kick out of the line 'Wanna take a ride' spoken by John Hurt in the movie.  There is one reviewer who put it as his title.

95763,5,0790733226,"Occasionally in sci-fi movie magazines, you'll see articles like ""Top 10 Women In Science Fiction,"" and it's always the predictable fan-fave list of hot babes kicking the butts of vampires, zombies, robots, etc.  You never see Jodie Foster in ""Contact"" on such lists, and that's a shame.  Why?  Because that would involve an actual WOMAN (an intelligent, mature woman of integrity and subtance, as opposed to a kung-fu sex object on steroids) in an actual SCIENCE FICTION movie (an intelligent, thought-provoking premise, as opposed to yet another action movie in space).

Robert Zemeckis made ""Contact"" as a follow-up to his record-breaking, critically acclaimed ""Forrest Gump,"" and the two make an oddly matched pair.  Both are epic stories centered around a single point-of-view character, one the simple man who takes us on a tour of our past, the other a complex woman who leads us into the future.  Foster's performance is easily the equal of Tom Hanks' Oscar-winning turn, but sadly this gem of a film didn't get quite the attention it should.  (Possibly because, like ""The Abyss,"" another classic, it was swallowed up in the midst of too many summer blockbusters.)

""Contact"" follows in the footsteps (and the high quality) of both ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" treating its subject of alien intelligence with serious thought: the most plausible aliens ever put on film are the ones we can't quite see.  This leaves us free to use our imaginations -- which far exceed Hollywood's abilities in any event -- but also keeps the focus on the story's most truly important aspect, ourselves and our reactions to the prospect that we are not alone in the universe.

Although the story may sound dry on paper -- there are no ray guns, bug-eyed monsters or flesh-eating mutants in this movie -- the pace is never dull, and there's plenty to keep audiences engrossed, including a large amount of sideshow silliness from the world media, some devious government politicking, a chillingly plausible subplot about religious extremists (with Jake Busey, a dead ringer for his dad Gary), and an exasperatingly funny convention of every UFO-loving nutjob in the western hemisphere.

The cast is uniformly impressive, with charismatic actors like Angela Bassett, David Morse, Tom Skerritt, and the always enjoyable James Woods.  Stealing the show (and giving us the pleasure of having 2 ""Alien"" veterans in the cast) is John Hurt as a manipulative Howard-Hughes-ish recluse whose scenes are few but played with ""Silence of the Lambs"" intensity and power.  Personally, I'm not a big Matthew McConaughey fan, but he serves well as the pseudo-love-interest who quietly challenges the beliefs of Foster's character and makes her (and us) reexamine her deepest motives.

Jodie Foster, however, carries the film's emotional center with aplomb, making herself both admirably resourceful and empathetically flawed in equal amounts.  Her emotionally wounded character is driven to delve into the heart of the universe through strictly scientific methods, yet resists any suggestion of religious faith, realizing only at the end that both are flipsides of the same coin.  Foster allows this conflict within herself to drive the story as much as the global events occurring around her.  (Note, incidentally, the recurring characteristic trait of curling into a protective fetal position while perched on the very edge of something -- a chair, a bed, a porch, a canyon -- and gazing upward and outward even while retreating inward.  Nice touch, Ms. Foster!)

The plot is well-developed, with a particularly wicked double-twist ending, and there is some insightful social and philosophical commentary in this movie.  But, for sheer thrills, it also boasts the most exciting climactic sequence I saw that entire year, as Foster's character makes the last walk to embark on the journey to end all journeys.  And frankly, for the summer of '97, that's saying something!

This is a fitting testament to Carl Sagan's optimistic point of view in regard to the cosmos. In his own way he was a religious man although one could argue the other way based on passages in the novel. Carl was just so darned meticulous with his thought processes and Dr Arroway represents an extreme of that process in this regard. She can't believe in God because of all the loss in her life so she sabotages her chances of going on the trip to Vega. The best she can muster is the weak, 'There's not enough data either way. ' and that's all the opening Drumlin needs to yank yet another thing away from her.

Even though ""Contact"" is Sagan's only novel, it's a very good one, with a firm basis in real-world science. Adapted to the screen, it loses a lot, but the story is compelling, and the cast does a very good job of making it work. The special effects are impressive, too. One day, we may actually receive an interstellar welcome. The scenario presented in ""Contact"" may not be all that far off the mark as to how and what that message may be and how we'll work on reading it.",1177891200,6,591,4.431192660550459

95793,3,0790733226,"""Contact"" is the filmed version of Carl Sagan's novel of the same name, and was completed after his early death.  I can imagine Carl having as mixed feelings about this movie as I do, but overall, I think he would've been generally pleased.  However, there are so many things, so many details, and extrapolations in this filmed version which were dealt with so much more satisfying and explanatory in the novel, that I wonder.

Generally, ""wonder"" and a sense of ""awe"" at the scope and size and meaning of the universe, and whether or not we are ""all alone"" (as far as technological, advanced, intelligent OTHER civilizations in the cosmos are concerned), or not, is at the heart of this movie.  And considering Hollywood's reluctance to tackle such weighty cosmic matters, overall, this film has to be considered a moderate success.

Unfortunately, crucial elements from the novel are simply ignored here or are given lip service at best, and the result is a film which is compelling and eye-candy in some parts, but in the end especially, lacks any solid ground and is overlong and in too many sections, insufficiently explained for the layman/average viewer.  Also, while the beginning of the film is one of the coolest major motion picture beginnings of all time, the payoff and end leave something to be desired.

Technically, the film is almost perfect, with great pace, acting, and a mostly intelligent screenplay.  The opening sequence, in which we travel from our own little noisy corner of the universe, zooming out towards our real, rather insignificant and silent place in the greater scheme of things, is amazing.  It's just too bad that the whole film couldn't have kept up that quality.  And the end, in various ways, seems to contradict and/or diminish the same.

Having read the novel long ago, I remembered an ending even more cosmic and mind-blowing than that which is exhibited here.  Perhaps, in retrospect, the ending of Sagan's novel, in which the whole question of ""religion"" and ""God"" and the ""cosmos"" is given as compelling an ending as the film's beginning, couldn't really have been ""filmed.""  Perhaps during the production, it was decided that the end of Sagan's novel, really couldn't be visualized with film, so while the movie as a whole is generally satisfying, the end is very disappointing.

""Religion"" and humankind's views of such and how they may or may not explain our being and place in the cosmos, play a significant part here, but a more undefined ""belief in a God"" is confused with ""terrestrial"" religious tenets and symbols here.  And the whole government/taxpayer supported SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) ""scientific"" project and ""mission"" is eventually revealed to be nothing much more than just another ""religious"" idea, explored with science and technology and MONEY, instead of meaningless ancient voodoo and superstition.

This leads to a confusion between ""faith"" and ""evidence"" which the movie never really addresses.  In a crucial scene, the question is asked, ""You loved your father?  Prove it.""  I'm sure Sagan could've and did (in the book) explain this, but in the film, this is left unanswered unnnecessarily.  As are so many questions and answers, up until the end.

Many parts of the film and premise, are just too simple-minded and too much a set-up for easy answers later on, when it all could have been so much more.  And yet, a lot of this I'm sure, will fly light years above most people's heads.  Still, as one who has studied both UFO/ET/Abduction evidence along with that of the continuing mission of SETI, I'd have to call it a draw so far.

In the end, the film comes nowhere near the truly mind-expanding conclusions and questions of the novel, but again, perhaps, this was just too much to be put in a Hollywood movie, and may even have been impossible to visualize with mere cinema.  The main problem here is that a very patronizing ending is tacked on where something more in keeping with the general spirit of the novel's original ending, would've been so much better.

We are told, in the end, that the traveler's journey and contact with real ET, can somehow be proved beyond faith, with science and human measurement instruments, but besides the temporal moments the traveler spent light years away, the only proof of such, could lay in a 1000 different explanations, including the first one that came to mind.  The traveler could've dreamed it all up, in a split second.  While observers (and human science) recorded it as something more.

This is an overall entertaining and intelligent movie, with some great special effects and wonderful music, but its basic premise, that of SETI itself, is flawed in my view, and is never fully and satisfyingly addressed within.  In the beginning, the young girl is told by her father, when asked if there was anyone else out there, ""if not, it would be an awful waste of space.""  Sadly, the end of the movie, refinforces this general idea, but it is as much a ""religious"" idea as is anything the movie preaches against.

Space and our universe is big, really, really big.  But size and numbers of planets do not posit some sort of religious idea that life, let alone intelligent life, is somehow ""common"" in the cosmos.  And really, if there were such advanced civilizations, I think a more likely explanation would be that they've already been here for eons, and that primitive ""radio"" signals we might someday receive from them, would've been discovered long ago.  Long before the ""UFO"" phenomenon, long before our technologies, and perhaps beyond the reach and imagination of SETI scientists and researchers, who after all, depend upon money and peer status, for everything they pursue and have the courage to pursue.

Now for the nitpicking...

--SPOILER WARNING--

I haven't read Sagan's book, but I'm guessing the story was altered to give it a wonderful sappy ending in which religion and science are ""both right"". Maybe they are both right, but this movie sure didn't show it. Because the ending has a monstrous gaping hole.

In their effort to teach Ellie (and us) a lesson about faith, the writers contrive an ending where Ellie is left with nothing but a memory to verify her wonderful experience. An angry congressional inquiry, led by the James Woods character, investigates, and comes up with an alternative explanation for everything that has happened -- that it's all been an elaborate hoax perpetrated by the eccentric genius Haddon. But this is ridiculous, for many reasons. For one thing, how did Haddon come up with radically new technology capable of generating lightning and tidal waves yet inside of which ""the weather's fine""? He's smart, but not that smart (he has self-sealing door metal technology that he never thought to sell?).

But more importantly, a signal from deep space could not be faked by a satellite, especially one that's been verified in Australia. And even if it could, THE SIGNAL WAS STILL THERE during the entire building of the machine. The aliens could not have known it was received at least until Ellie made her journey, so they would not have stopped transmitting. There was all the time in the world to verify that the signal was in fact coming from Vega. So there was clearly a message sent by aliens, and the public anger over wasted money makes no sense. So, the entire ending of the movie seemed stupid and manipulative to me. The message of this movie should have been ""science trumps human stupidity"", but that message wouldn't have been commercial.

95825,3,0790733226,"`Revision..Not Concision'..Too Busy Planning the Y2K/9-11 Demolitions  Part I

Originally, review of this movie found some fault with the short shrift given to the novel's breathtaking resolution.  Usually the movie based on a book should at least attempt to preserve that, but it was mathematical, not unlike the computer models so excellently done in the movie--so it's debatable there were other motivations to further dumb down the content.  Computer graphics are ok, just don't give people any ideas; and that's roughly the paranoid police state's continuing theme from movie to movie.  So paranoid in fact, former head of creativity for Walt Disney Company Eric Hazeltine headed up a Discover magazine round table with American mathematics leaders to discuss no longer teaching long division in the public schools (9/'02).  The point is, he was also a figure in the NSA meddling by some `association', thus we have a connected set of reciprocating facts surrounding what Sen. J. W. Fullbright called, ""The Pentagon Propaganda Machine"", largely channeled through the movies.

So it's all about this idea of using cybernetic controls to pose as an alien threat, or the ultimate hack into human consciousness or tool for propagating torture and psychological conditioning on the population called Quantum Information and Communications (many titles are in the university library).  And of course it has to have exclusive control over Artificial Intelligence, rumored to have begun development under DARPA way back in the 50s.  Noam Chomsky tries not to allude to it very much, unsuccessfully, in his book ""Language and Problems of Knowledge"".  The brain is sort of a language processor, so better look out for that character.  Thus, the public is condescended to in this film quite miserably; I was expecting less overacting and more science.  I guess any theater company's rendition of `Trouble in Tahiti' is going to disappoint some of the audience by a wide margin, or fail to capture many important elements of the story.  Certainly the effort to push Shakespearian English on the modern drama goes without question as the worst form of retro.  So when we go to the movies, expectations should consider anything possible.  I guess it wasn't so bad...except for the effort at incorporating docudrama...with news coverage and Clinton's Mars Rock tape.  That got off subject by confusing current events with a science fiction story.  Of course the San Diego cult's execution has nothing whatsoever to do with any of this, or that viewing technology misrepresented in ""Quantum Gravity"" by Lee Smolin, or that other industry promo by Spielberg in `Minority Report'.

What can be done?  Any book is going to drive the movie projector and production of the imagination about 10 times better than a movie ever will or ever could.  This is why motion picture propaganda is so easily filleted.  (Take for instance the continent hopping, double murder insurance scam in `Flight Plan'--and other unsophisticated macho pieces) Movies are a kind of opiate for the masses, they're literally feeding off their sponsor's desperate desires to condescend and intimidate, pride in playing everyone for a fool, and more importantly a serious propaganda problem of a warfare level of escalation, such as the movie `The Forgotten' which tries to blame missing persons (like the prior movie) and modern disasters on aliens.  Is extraterrestrial intelligence an important question for concern? It certainly is so far as the evasion of crime under such a ridiculous proxy to condition public passivity.  Does it lend itself to any practical context with the down to earth?  I doubt it.  And the reason is actually more curiously redirected to the question...it is comprising more offshoot entertainment themes that posit a different universe or a different consciousness than was expected...movies like `The Matrix', `CUBE', `THX', `Planet of the Apes' or allegorical time travel settings.  So who knows?  It doesn't interest as much as it used to, the bigger questions of course being the unceasing war on many levels between the various cultures of human beings, and not short of arriving in the American daily life.  Science fiction has always been a social prospectus or blueprint for great dreams of beyond even urban planning, as have terrorist political movements always envisioned since earlier in the 20th Century.  Then here we are right where it's thinking nothing of clearing the way, i.e. building demolitions and war spawned genocides.

Let's take a look at one thing that was brought up in the earlier review, that being the oddity of the crop circles and elaborate glyphs.  That certainly hints at a sign extraterrestrial presence maybe.  Because you know, science and technology are not a static thing.  In the 1950s diplomacy attempted to shake the earth in the South Pacific with hundred of enormous hydrogen bomb blasts, so called testing that was more a race of saber rattling...and of course its high aloft radioactive fallout disintegrated enough tri atomic oxygen to form the ozone hole...a fact that has to hide behind a courtesy screen in a book title like ""Ozone Diplomacy"".  The `official science' doesn't add up, contrasting the Northern polar region's allegedly intact ozone layer where all the industrial CFCs were produced after all, and by the way, all the ozone from tailpipes of millions of automobiles at the same time.

Cast:  Jodie Foster, Matthew McConaughey, Tom Skerritt, James Woods, Angela Bassett, John Hurt, David Morse, William Fichtner, Geoffrey Blake, Sami Chester, Timothy McNeil.

Running Time:  153 minutes

Rated PG for some intense action, mild language and a scene of sensuality.

All of the greatest work by the greatest scientists has been done while they were very young, when they were stupid enough to believe that two-plus-two-equals-five, and pursued it instead of listening to all of those who were much older and wiser who said Don't Waste Your Time. Einstein, it has been said, asked all of his important questions before the age of twenty-five, then spent the rest of his life working on them. ""Contact"", directed by Robert Zemeckis (""Forrest Gump"", ""Back to the Future""), is the story of a young scientist, Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster), who like Einstein and all the greats before her, has been asking questions and seeking answers since she was very young. And now, as a member of the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) team, she is able to pursue her obsession with the mysteries of the galaxies and the infinite universe that surrounds us. Her job is to sweep the skies, using the most sophisticated equipment available, for a signal from deepest space. It may be her job, but for Ellie it's a labor of love, for she is convinced that there is something, or someone, out there somewhere, because otherwise, she reasons, what a terrible waste of space it would be. Ellie may be a dreamer, but she knows in her heart that it is the dreamers who over the years have been responsible for making us evolve, making us learn and grow because they are the ones who take insane, foolish ideas and pursue them. And to her, two-plus-two will always be five.

Ellie loves her job and believes in what she is doing, but it's been a struggle over the years, as she and others have had to constantly fight for the funding necessary to keep the project alive, begging for dollars from short-sighted, unimaginative people with vision that goes only as far as the bottom line of their budget book. It's been a tough row to hoe, and she's had to swallow a lot of pride over the years, but then one day it all pays off, when in one magic moment she hears what she's been waiting for all her life: A signal from a distant end of the galaxy-- someone attempting to communicate, to make contact, with the people of the Earth.  Ellie and her team soon realize that, whomever it is, they are using the universal language of prime numbers in their attempts at making contact; and when Ellie deciphers the code, she discovers something monumental in the bargain. But it's a message of global importance, something much bigger than she and her team alone, and she soon find herself fighting to remain a part of the drama that is only beginning to unfold-- the first interaction between human beings and an alien life form. And it's only the beginning of the adventure and the wondrous places this film is about to take you.

Jodie Foster gives a performance here that demonstrates what a gifted, talented actor she is. Her Ellie is convincing and believable, and someone to whom you can genuinely relate, no matter who you are or where you're from, because there is something universal in Ellie's passion and longing to discover the truth and to see beyond the veil of our limited mortal capacities. There's a strength to Ellie, born of a combination of intelligence and innocence, as well as tenacity and faith, and Foster manifests all of these complexities of her character beautifully, with a performance that should've landed her an Oscar nomination. In this role, she is simply as good as it gets.  The supporting cast includes David Morse (Ted Arroway), Matthew McConaughey (Palmer), Geoffrey Blake (Fisher), William Fichtner (Kent), Tom Skerritt (David), James Woods (Kitz) and Angela Bassett (Rachel). Zemeckis did a brilliant job of bringing this film to fruition, especially in the way he allowed Foster the time to really develop her character, by giving her that extra moment at just the right time that ultimately meant so much in the final analysis. Too often it's those few minutes that wind up on the cutting room floor that make the difference between a good film and an exceptional one; and between Zemeckis and Foster, they took it to the edge by taking some chances to realize that combined vision, which in the end made this a great film. Thoroughly engrossing and entertaining, `Contact' will transport you to places you can only imagine, and it's all done with style and in a way that makes this a truly memorable cinematic journey. It's what the magic of the movies is all about.",1149638400,6,4729,4.804428044280443

Happily, ""Contact"" is that rare instance when the movie is better than the book. It is worth the price of the DVD just for the awe-inspiring visuals of the opening sequence. The clever use of media sources for exposition, & the manipulated image of president Clinton (from his ""Mar's rock"" speech I believe) make it noteworthy. I also enjoyed the remarks by Ellie's ""father"" at the movie's end, as well as her testimony. In my opinion, this is Jodie Foster's finest role. If you're looking for a space alien shoot-em-up get Starship Troopers because this movie will dissapoint you - which may explain why this movie is often overlooked & under-rated.

Well what would it be like if the ending has aliens showing Jodie Foster the secret of life the universe and everything and sent her home with a pat on the head? Apart from being quite beyond the capability of even Carl Sagans mind, by showing only the traces of aliens the sense of the unknown is kept. You're kept thinking ""Oh come on I wanted to see more! What were they really like?"" Sure you may be disappointed by being given only a little information but if it was all explained to you with nothing left to the imagination the sense of disappointment would be greater. The aliens are kept mysterious to keep you curious. Human beings like to wonder. In effect the viewer (and reader in the case of the book) is given a ""teaser"". If it gets you wondering about what's really out there, then I think Carl Sagan has accomplished what he really intended.

Overall I think the book is more thought provoking, but the movie does have good points in the visual effects area. In particular, the 3 minute opening scene showing the pan away from earth, moon, solar system, cometary cloud, nebuale, galaxy to other galaxies and beyond gives a real sense of scale to the universe, much more than simply words could desribe. It's one thing to say ""billions and billions"" but to *see* the universe visually is quite another. The scene where Jodie Foster floats down from the sky to the beach world is uncannily dreamlike too. And of course the movie soundtrack is very good too.

95852,4,0790733226,"While this movie is often held up as a science fiction story about first contact with beings from another world, that is only the framework for what the story of this movie is about (I have not read the book and do not know if the book is similar to the movie, but the Carl Sagan was involved in the screenplay).  Contact also refers to the human search for truth and what coming into contact with that is like.  This isn't a particularly subtle story, but it does have a strong point to make about the humility true seekers of truth have versus those who talk about truth, but distort and destroy as they advance some other agenda.

A mistaken view of the movie would be to see it as science versus religion or as reality versus faith.  Sagan is actually pointing out the similarity of scientific truth seeking and faith - a lesson that Eleanor Arroway (played by the great Jodie Foster) eventually learns as she is persecuted for the reality she experienced, but cannot prove.  She even refers to her experience as a vision in trying to describe it.  And her soulmate, the man of faith Palmer Joss (played quite well by Matthew McConaughey), supports her testimony and sees something in the search for truth through science that he had not suspected.

The bad guys in the film are on both sides and are portrayed a bit ham handedly, but are well acted by Jake Busey as Joseph, and James Woods as Michael Kitz.  Joseph is the wild eyed ""prophet"" whose vision of the truth leads him to reject anything that science has to say (except the making of explosives, apparently), and Michael Kitz is a cynical politician who ""investigates"" Arroway's experience, but who is really using her to try and advance his political career.  (Why they simply didn't have someone else go through the machine to verify what Arroway said one way or the other eludes me - maybe the story made up some ""reason"" to prevent that logical next step.)  So, this way the story pairs Arroway and Joss as true seekers who have humility and devotion to the truth, but who have different approaches.  Their love story shows them as soul mates not only in love, but also in their love of truth.  Then we have the idiot bad guys Joseph and Kitz who have other desires and only pretend to be seeking the truth.  They already ""know"" their truth and aren't seeking anything.

The other characters all help dress out this theme and add to an interesting story, but this is the main point of the story and makes for a pretty good film.  Just don't expect a terrific science fiction / alien film, because that is not what this really is.",1146614400,4,2597,4.519230769230769

95878,5,0790733226,"This is not your typical sci-fi movie, simply because the book on which this was based was written by the late Dr. Carl Sagan, Ph. D., a world-renowned professor of astronomy.

Don't expect green women seducing the captain of a starship, nor fist-fights with aliens (which is a bit ridiculous when you really think about it), nor aliens that are simply 'human in every way' except (for example): a) they have pointy ears and suppress their emotions, or b) they have a violent streak and have interesting foreheads, or c) they are short, have large ears, and are incredibly greedy.  Remove the ears, the unusual foreheads and the big ears and what do you have?  Just a variety of human beings -- those seeking emotional self-control and spiritual development, violent warrior-types and unethical, money-grubbing businessmen.

As much as I truly TRULY love other sci-fi series, virtually all the above aliens are bi-peds (two-legged) and are about as technologically advanced as humans are at that point in the future.

If another race of aliens were only a couple hundred years ahead of us militarily and technologically, they could blow humans out of the water if they chose to do so.  Why?  Because scientific knowledge increases exponentially and therefore with an ever-increasing increasing speed.  (Just look at what we human beings have learned in the last 50 years.)

Several people that I know that saw Contact did not understand beforehand that Carl Sagan was trying to depict how First Contact might REALLY happen with a far more advanced, non-violent species that wished to communicate with us, with as little trauma as possible.  Some of my acquaintances were disappointed that there were very little special effects.

The bottom line:  This is an absolutely wonderful movie for those who have the patience and intelligence to appreciate a believable, insightful film which: a) thoughtfully depicts the individual characters who make the discovery, and b) also explores how different groups of people throughout the world might react to a First Contact that the entire planet suddenly becomes aware of.

Expect outstanding, ""slower-paced-yet-fascinating!"", subtle, insightful writing and first-class acting.  Expect realism, not computer-generated aliens, nor an excessive reliance on special effects, nor a predictable, canned Hollywood script, nor a predictable Hollywood ending.

Human reality is rarely predictable and is often both 'tumultous and disappointing' on the one hand, but also 'amazing and beautiful beyond words' on the other.  Definitely 5 stars!!!",1140739200,2,2577,5.341584158415841

Along the way she meets Palmer (Matthew McConaughey), a man concerned with how scienctific discovery and technology affect human welfare and religion.  These two characters have very different religious viewpoints, and I feel like the differences were handled well.  The debate could have gone on endlessly, but that wasn't the point of the movie, and once it reached the fundamental divide between faith vs. proof they let it go.

The movie was well-acted by all the characters.  Jodi Foster plays a very convincing obsessed scientist, and Matthew McConaughey is a thoughtful counterpoint.  Personally, I think the downfall to a lot of science fiction movies is that the characters are too attractive and the movie gets wrapped up in their romantic relationships.  Contact kept the science on mainstage with brief cameos from other topics, which was great!

Contact brings the viewer in and forces you to think about really important issues and how you would react to the events that unfold.  Plus the space images were awesome!  Loved it!",1140307200,,1192,5.15625
95880,4,0790733226,"I liked CONTACT a lot when I originally saw it in the theater and my opinion hasn't changed despite numerous viewings since I got the DVD. Apparently I'm not alone. Other reviewers have brought up a number of good reasons for their enthusiasm. Reasons such as top-notch acting, a thoughtful and thought-provoking story, and dramatic moments like the initial appearance of the alien signal and the destruction of the alien device.

I'm on board with all of these observations. In particular, the intelligent treatment of the controversy that erupts over the human response is plausible. This is a more thoughtful scifi movie than most (not to take anything away from space operas), and that's a good thing. Beyond this, however, there are some things in CONTACT that are special for me that haven't been noted by others.

First, there's the opening sequence. It begins with a view of earth floating in space. From there the camera seemingly falls away at an accelerating pace, zooming past the other planets in our solar system, flying backward to a position looking back at the Milky Wat galaxy. It's a breath-taking sequence and the DVD is worth having just for that alone.

Then, there's the great scene when Jodie Foster's character enters the capsule and waits to go wherever she's going. ""Good to go"", she keeps repeating. ""I'm good to go."" I can never watch this part of CONTACT without reflecting on what a terrifying yet exhilarating moment that would be. Foster's character has no idea where she's going (if she goes at all) or what she'll find when she gets there. It's the moment she's waited her whole life for, but she's facing the ultimate unknown. The scene is, for me, an incredible one and I never tire of seeing it.

Finally, the trip Dr. Arroway finally goes on is visually gorgeous and emotionally satisfying. What happens is very much open to debate, but the journey is eye candy from beginning to end. The ""contact"" she makes is a nice culmination of her touching relationship with her father.

I hesitate to call CONTACT a great movie, but it's certainly a very good one. It's one I'm happy to own and I strongly recommend it to you. Further, as I write this, it's selling here for just $9.99. That's a bargain in my book. Don't pass it up.",1139788800,4,2263,4.733502538071066

95883,5,0790733226,"This is more of a personal response to this movie, since many other reviewers have detailed the plot, the actors, the strengths and (though few, in my opinion) the weakenesses.

To the dismay of my family, especially of my 14-year-old daughter, this is still one of my favorite movies, if not my most favorite.  (To be fair to said daughter, a few weeks ago she picked this one from a list of three, sat through the entire movie, and then wanted to discuss it afterward.  Yessss!)

I have dealt through my entire adult life with the issues of ""science vs. religion.""  No other Hollywood movie I'm familiar with addresses this nexus so well.  I grew up in a conservative religious environment, in which the short chronology of Earth was a given.  And by short I mean about 6,000 years, per the genealogical chronologies of the Hebrew Old Testament. (As you may know, the Greek Septuagint OT chronologies run a tad longer, say about 7,000.)

Graduate study in ancient Near Eastern history/achaeology and excursions into geology (including a three-week stint in the fossil forests of the Yellowstone) forced me to reconsider the ""given-ness"" of the short age of Earth, and to look more objectively at the nature of ""truth,"" of perception and epistmelogy, of ""myth"" (as an organizing stucture).  Without saying more, let me just say that this personal journey has left me closer to Ellie Arroway than to Joss Palmer.

I used to say that religion and science were two valid ways of looking at the universe.  Now I'm not even sure what such an assertion means.  I no longer think of myself as a two-part witness to reality (whatever that is).  Split epistemology like this no longer works for me.

Ellie and Joss wrestle with ""Ocham's Razor.""  In terms that would be entirely at home in the Evolution vs. Intelligent Design ""debate,"" this movie asks the hard question that few on the religious Right today seen to care for:  ""What is the evidence.""

Other reviewers have made the point, correctly, that this movie is appropriately ambiguous on the answers to the largest questions.  That said, good science still has the best approach to deriving trustworthy answers about the universe.  I will leave for others the question of the place of religion in this mix.",1135123200,68,2256,4.812987012987013

95885,5,0790733226,"`Contact' has evolved into one of those movies that people either seem to love or hate.  This reviewer loves it.

`Contact' is a fresh story, and is particularly great for those who enjoy their sci-fi light : science fiction movies that don't require laser guns and spaceships, etc.  Its subject is thought provoking, its characters are memorable and well portrayed, and its overall presentation is top-notch.

The events following the signal's detection are spot on, as director Robert Zemeckis captures brilliantly the reaction and events that would most likely follow an event of this magnitude.  I view what he presents not as a swipe at humanity, but as a snapshot of its current state.  Religious zealots to scam artists to a media feeding frenzy are presented here, not to mention rather accurately and believably.  The political, religious, social, and moral fallout of such an event are also presented here extremely well.

The movie's climax (Ellie's final destination) is not only satisfying, but also intentionally ambiguous, forcing the viewer to think about what they have just seen, and where she might actually have been.  For the sake of anyone who hasn't seen it, I'm being as vague as possible, so as not to ruin anything.

It's probably redundant to say that Jodie Foster was fantastic, but I'll say it anyway.  She is in a category by herself, in terms of acting talent, and she is supported by a great cast featuring Tom Skerritt, Matthew McConaughey, David Morse (a terrific actor in his own right), Angela Bassett, John Hurt, and James Woods, among others.  Also featured are many well-known media figures who had cameos in the movie, adding a level of authenticity to the film.

`Contact' definitely deserved more attention at Oscar time the year it was released, and why it didn't receive more, I can't say.  Suffice it to say that this is a movie that, no matter what you believe spiritually, has the ability to either force you to question that belief, or it will re-enforce your beliefs stronger than ever.",1129507200,6,2035,4.929618768328446

95917,2,0790733226,"A well done movie, but a huge and suspensful buildup with a fantastic machine to go....nowhere.

Like other reviewers who could see the big picture,the hugely paid writers of this film could come up with nothing better than toothpaste commercial-quality special effects of some lame Florida nightclub beach with a (very) low galaxy studded ceiling ??!!! And to have the dead dad deliver some mushy, useless speech that said NOTHING??!!!

Things I agree with other reviewers on:

Angela Bassett had to ACT! instead of just acting. She ate the scenery in each of her scenes. Quite annoying. James Woods did the same.

Whenever Matthew McCaugheny came into a scene, the movie stopped dead in its tracks and yes, don't hit us over the head with religion! If religion had its way, we'd all be still living in the middle ages. Science (the opposite of religion) has given us technology and all the comforts that go with it. Laughably ZERO chemistry between he and Jodie Foster.

Zemeckis teased us with the big build up to nowhere. Shame on him for not finding creative minds that would have provided the necessary pay-off to taking a ride in the Fantastic Machine. How dumb did he think his paying audience was? Pretty dumb.

Like I said, well made big budget movie worth watching IF you do not expect a pay-off which this one thoroughly promised but failed to deliver.",1126051200,2,1364,4.782978723404256

This film is a tremendous breakthrough in CG animation and the use of realistic news casts and video inserts to convey a sense that it really happened.  If it did happen, how would it unravel and the book is a masterly portrayal of how things could change.  The script also analyses the scientific method, Occam's Razor and the problems with truth and the bugbear of science and relgion - veering rightly in my view towards science against the dogmatic aspect of religion.

How accurately the film foretold the tragedies of suicide bombers.  How lovingly it showed the whole of a dessert community madly celebrate the message from outer space, in so diverse a fashion and hyperbole as only Americans could.

The best bits were views of our solar system and such extraordinary footage of young Ellie - rushing down a corridoor to open the medicine chest.

The best film of 1997 and perhaps the 90s sadly underated and comparable to other Zemeckis treats like Forest Gump.

95920,4,0790733226,"This film adaptation of Carl Sagan's novel ""Contact"" emphasizes the very few things wrong with the story, while skipping or bastardizing the elements that made it great. In order to fully understand the poverty of this film adaptation, one needs to know more than a little bit about Carl Sagan. Dr. Sagan was an astronomer with a well thought out and unwavering view of what NASA should be about. He lobbied for the terra-forming of Mars as early as 1972. Four 02 machines, and 25 years, would produce a noticeable atmosphere on the Red planet. Another quarter century would produce an environment still very hostile to humankind, but sophisticated ""space suits"" would enable the few colonists (Engineers, Scientists) working there, to prepare Mars for permanent inhabitants. Mars is rich in gympsum, and thus few tools would be needed to erect permanent structures from the strong yet malleable rock. By the year 2042 - a mere 75 years after the start date - Mars would be able to support human life fairly easily. No special gear or out-fitting would be needed. People could tolerate the atmosphere wearing nothing but ""street clothes"" for several hours a day. People would probably carry a small 02 unit to combat any shortness of breath. Mars would be Earth-like and able to support human life by 2070. Perhaps man will learn from our mistakes on Earth and not rape the planet, or make war.

Carl Sagan was also a politician. Genuine and enthusiastic, but not very effective. The scientific community tapped him to argue Evolution vs. Creationism with a team of debaters who trained in San Diego at the Creationism Institute. These debaters rehearsed with an IF-THEN approach to counter anything Sagan said. Sagan tried to bridge the gap between science and religion in a manner respectful to all points of view. He had underestimated the religous zealots, and thus, walked away from these public debates having appeared to be weak, ill-prepared, slow, confusing, and unconvincing. He made the same errors when testifying in front of Congress for additional funds for space exploration. His battles with NASA were highly publicized, and NASA looked as weak as him. He had a love/hate relationship with NASA in that he disagreed with their plans, but understood tha NASA was the only game in town. He died a slow agonizing death shortly before the film came out, and gave it a very tacid thumbs up. For all his love, all his work, he passed having realized none of his funding attempts and was ultimately one of the saddist people of the 20th c.

THE FILM: Ellie Arroway (""Sparks"") brought to life by Jodie Foster, never met her mother as she had died at Ellie's birth. Her father died when she was 9. Ellie raced through High School, College, and Graduate school, and turned down Fellowship after Fellowship to devote her life to SETI. There is a lot of poetry here: Ellie's mother dying from childbirth is visualized by the tunnel-like Black Holes she travels through during her personal space odyssey. Her fathers caution that she'll need to take small steps to realize her frontier. And small steps she took during her quest.

Ellie and her Research Assistants - one of whom is blind and thus able to hear nuances sighted people may miss - eventually receive radio signals that are sophistcated and repetitive. Not products of randomness. She had resorted to begging Billionaires for funds to continue her effort, and now it was paying off. They had made Contact. A message millions of pages long comes to NASA's computers in the form of unfinished diagrams, symbols of apparent mathematics, and endless blogs of HTML-like instructions. Nothing seems to fit together. A reclusive Billionarre tells Ellie to ""think like a Vegan."" She puts the pages together in a three dimensional format and finds the primer that enables her and the other scientists to read a message, get instructions, from another world.

Palmer Joss: this unnecessary token religous character seems to have been inserted itno the film only to provide gratuitous nudity. Played by handsome Matthew Mc Coughnehy, this man of the cloth character serves only to interrupt the seamlessness of the film while spouting profound revelations, and presenting Ellie with a dichotomous love interest. This character sucks.

After Congressional inquests during which Ellie is villified for being atheist; after a horrific act of terror by a religous zealot that kills the character nicely played by Tom Skerrit, Ellie becomes the traveler. Propelled through the universe by entering the fore-mentioned tunnels, Ellie meets a person who appears to be her father. The alien admits he has taken the appearence and persona of her father to make it easier on her.

What I like best about this film is that it addresses both sides of the Science versus Religion debate, and is equally respectful of both sides.  Jodie Foster's character is a woman of Science, not of God.  But by the story's end she has found her own kind of Faith, though it comes partially because she is unable to provide proof of something that her doubters know darn well does actually exist.

My only beef with the film is a minor one but it stuck out like a sore thumb to me:  Late in the film's first act she is explaining what Prime Numbers are to some government men.  She says that prime numbers are ""numbers that are only divisible by themselves and One.""  Thanks for the math lesson, dear screenwriters, but in truth Prime Numbers are only EVENLY divisible by themselves and One.  Yes, there is a difference.  That little error in semantics wasn't the issue for me, however.  The issue is that just a few years before ""Contact"" was made, Jodie Foster directed and starred in ""Little Man Tate"", a film about a young boy with above-average intelligence.  In a science and math contest, the young boy and some other bright kids are asked ""Which of these numbers are divisible by [some integer, like 3]?""  While the other kids think it out, Little Man Tate shouts out ""All of them"", which was technically correct.  The contest moderators were looking for the numbers EVENLY divisible by the integer, but they failed to make that distinction.  Tate caught the mistake and put the quizmasters to shame.  Jodie Foster, having directed that scene, SURELY should have remembered that distinction when delivering her lines in ""Contact"".  That Prime Numbers description goof should never have made it past the rehearsal stage.

Zemekis has captured the essence of the book but for those who hunger after more I highly recommend reading the book as there's so much more to the story and the science that couldn't be told in the movie, especially the trip through the wormhole (taken by several people, not just Ellie) and the sections about the number pi.

95946,5,0790733226,"There's finally a movie about aliens that isn't showing aliens blowing the crap out of buildings and bridges. It's quite a good movie cause there's a sense of pace and structure without it being too long or just spurts of goodness laced in with long boring stuff.

The film opens very impressively with a shot of Earth outside its atmosphere with multiple sounds going on at once like songs and famous quotes and we do what could possibly the longest zoom out in cinema as we leave the solar system with the sounds starting to fade until we have left the Milky Way and then we see dozens of galaxies popping up. They then combine together into one little shiny light in a girl's eye. Quite neat but onto the story.

The little girl is Ellie Arroway, a quite gifted child with an acute taste for science and math and she becomes someone of huge intelligence only to sit in a chair at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico looking for signs of alien life. Her thorn in her side is David Drumlin, her boss and head of the Science Division. She ends up having to move to New Mexico's observatory and there she finds an alien signal filled with stuff so the whole world is now focused on her discovery even though she feels she's not being fully thanked.

One of the coolest scenes undoubtedly is all the radio signal decoding turns out to be a machine, an incredibly expensive machine that will send one occupant into a large energy core. Seeing her travel in this thing is quite neat but what happens afterwards is good since it reinforces the theme of the movie which is belief although some people absolutely hate it(like Mr. Garrison on South Park for one).

I can only watch the film now and then, just one of those movies that I can't really re-watch a little while after just seeing it but when I do, it's still good.

How can we be intelligent enough to build all of these tools to use, and still have room for doubt about the why? What if humans on an insignificant planet in the Cosmos actually did pick up a signal or make 'Contact' from outer space? How brave would you actually be? The movie 'Contact' presents this loneliness with a gentle and loving manner. The movie presents the greatest challenge -- do we survive, despite ourselves here on this insignificant speck like a grain of sand in all the grains of sand in all the beaches of the planet we live on? It really is not thought that humans would end it all, being even made to feel smaller than previously before by receiving advanced technology from aliens meant to meet this 'Contact', or is it a weapon?

But then again, they are extremely more intelligent, and give us hope, and fear, about the why and the what and the who and the how, but where are we, as humans, really at within the Grand Scheme of It All? The movie shows that the answer these questions give leave all even smaller and less advanced then we previously thought and still leaves the possibility open with all the awe and wonder Carl Sagan sought to show when talking about the Cosmos. The movie presents all of this with all the technological wonder it can muster at this Time and in this Space called SpaceTime. But then again, perhaps Carl Sagan should be remembered most for his love of life, and his thoughtfullness on why we as humans ought to survive and not create a Nuclear Winter Scenario by having a Nuclear War, a Holocaust due to hate and stupidity on this Planet Earth, in the Sol System, in the Persus Arm of the Milky Way Galaxy, one of the local group of 50 galaxies traveling together through SpaceTime at around 33 miles/ second traveling towards the SuperCluster Cluster of Strings of Galaxies near the Virgo Constellation only reaching that part of SpaceTime in another 300-400 million years, and still will we survive or make 'Contact' in that SpaceTime while we all are traveling in this SpaceTime and still find that everything else has moved that was there before in that region of SpaceTime, but yet find the strength and courage needed to survive? Perhaps, that is religion, perhaps it may be common sense, perhaps many emotions, some of which we may not have even discovered yet. Perhaps........ we are not alone afterall!

95949,3,0790733226,"Contact is the story of Ellie (Jodi Foster), a tomboyish scientist out to prove that there REALLY is extra-terrestrial life out there. Mathew McConaughey stars as the unconvincing religious scholar Palmer Jones. I found Contact to be slow at first. Once the alien contact was made I found the novel much more interesting. I really enjoyed the slow buildup and the introduction of each new clue to the alien entity.

I was rather lukewarm about Palmer as a love interest. He seemed to lack conviction and faded in and out of Ellie's life with no apparent. reason. I also found the religious message to be rather heavy handed.  (Don't get me wrong, I don't mind religious characters, but I hate to be bludgeoned over the head with a message). The whole ""Woman Looks For Aliens and Finds her Faith Instead"" message I could really do without. Also, the meeting with the 'alien' was anticlimactic and  seemed more suited for an episode featuring the star trek holodeck than a big budget film.

Overall, I felt Contact was a rather tepid film, that started out great, but failed to deliver the goods. (Oh, and Ellie's hair stylist needs to be fired. The whole hair extension thing looked cheap and really, really fake!) I give this film 3 stars for the excellent promise. But I'm deducting 1 star for Palmer who was a rather weak and uninteresting love interest, and a half star each for the silly religion/science sideshow and the rather slow start.",1105056000,3,1444,4.741035856573705

Jodie Foster does an excellent job in the key character of this movie.  And a fine supporting cast do quite well working to make all the events seem plausibly quite real.

Of the negative reviews I see here, they seem to fall into three categories.  One is people who knew nothing of Carl Sagan's writings.  And think the movie should be juiced up.  One is people who read the book and don't like the changes made. And finally those who don't like the treatment of religion or the manner in which the science seemed at odds with religion as portrayed here.

If you aren't familiar with Carl Sagan, then you are possibly looking for the wrong thing from this movie.  It isn't a sci-fi thriller meant to mindlessly entertain for a short while.

If you don't like the changes from the book, well I think that a matter of taste.  I thought the changes didn't diminish too much the ideas from the book.  And some concessions have to be made when books become movies.

For those not liking the portrayal of science and the way it is sometimes at odds with religion I can only say it must have seemed that way to Carl Sagan.  And I think it often is at odds.  As we advance in science as a culture it will be more at odds in the future.  Some compromises or changes will have to occur.  This movie left that open ended.  As it must do to be honest.

95952,4,0790733226,"CONTACT poses the philosophical dilemma revolving around the existence of God..or a God.  Scientists are thought to believe only those things which can be proven...there has always been a battle between religion and science.  Carl Sagan's book and Robert Zemecki's movie are not afraid to approach this dilemma.  And it's ironic that in the end, the scientist faces a panel that asks for proof.  It's a difficult question, and no answers are given.

The movie itself is a panoramic visual delight from the awesome opening to Ellie's travel to a distant galaxy.  Although the movie is a little long in the tooth, Zemeckis coaches a dynamite performance from Jodie Foster.  In her role as Ellie, Foster embodies the soul of a woman who has spent her life searching for answers, wanting to believe that there's more to life than us and our planet.  Using her distinctive voice, those beautiful eyes, and her heart-felt performance, Foster brings life to a complex, yet innocent, woman.  Matthew McConaughey as the spiritual former priest, Palmer Joss, uses his star power to enliven an otherwise poorly developed character.  The supporting cast has some good performances from William Fichter, as Ellie's blind companion; James Wood as a slimy National Security director; Tom Skerritt as the underhanded scientist who mocks Ellie and then when something occurs, takes the glory, and Angela Bassett as an aide to the president.  Zemeckis uses his FORREST GUMP technique of inserting the then real President Clinton into the film to authenticate the action.

95955,5,0790733226,"One of my favorite subjects as I was growing up and into my early 20s, was backyard skywatching and astronomy.  I believe this movie accurately portrays the emotional aspects of science in general and astronomy in particular:  the sense of awe and beauty when confronted with infinity, and the sense of lonliness felt by everyone with an idealistic passion.
If you have ever read Carl Sagan's books, you'll see that this movie touches upon the usual staples of a Carl Sagan read:  the foundation of religion vs. the foundation of science, the mutual misunderstanding and struggle between those governed by curious optimism versus those governed by primal fear, and a demonstration of the dangers of a world that depends on science which is filled with so many people who do not understand it.
Some have argued that they find Contact to be ""preachy.""  I don't really see much of a foundation in that assessment of the movie.  Just like in real life, the ultimate philosophical answers are left wide open at the end of this movie, leaving it open to many different interpretations.  And I think it's refreshing to see a movie that doesn't follow the contemporary pattern of avoiding any serious discussion about morality and philosophy.  These are some of the conversations the human race will be forced to have with itself if we want to survive the coming centuries.  Recent events since this movie was released and Carl Sagan's death only accentuate the importance of facing this fact.
I love this movie.  From the beautiful computer-generated opening sequence, through the middle sequences detailing the main character's relentless and passionate quest for scientific knowledge and exploration, to the adventurous surreal climax, I felt that I had a personal connection with almost every aspect of this movie.",1089590400,6,1810,5.0673400673400675

Radio telescopes pick up a signal from space. The signal has many levels and originates from a system that has been too quiet. In the signal there appears to be the instructions for building some sort of machine. The machine is built and sabotaged. A second machine is activated and the movie's star has an experience unobserved from Earth.
It is common to shrink casts to make a book fit in a movie. In this case it lengthened it. By cutting the team down to one person there was suddenly a lot of politics about what single person could represent all of Earth. After the return it is one person's word, not a team's, against the evidence.
I was not a big fan of the book when it came out (the characters jumped to too many conclusions and I didn't like the ending). The film 2001: A Space Odyssey becomes the template for the journey with language lifted right from the novelization (of 2001, that is) thus weakening the story even further.
One way to think of it is that if this film mated with Independence Day then the offspring would be The Arrival. While The Arrival does the contact bit better Contact is still fun to watch.

The movie ultimately focuses on the concept that, whatever you want to call it, there is ""more"" out there.

The photography in ""Contact"" is very detailed. The shots that show the outer space and the natural beauties surrounding the research centers are proof of the high technical level of the team behind ""Contact"". The use of footage of popular characters (like Bill Clinton) look as real or even more real that the scenes in ""Forrest Gump"" (same technical team behind ""Contact"", but with more experience and more technology than where they did ""Forrest Gump"" in 1994). By the way, the music is also perfect for this film, the composer was Alan Silvestri.
2).- THE MOVIE HAS AN INTERESTING CAST: in ""Contact"", we can find popular actors like Jodie Foster, James Woods, John Hurt, Tom Skerritt, Rob Lowe and Matthew McConaughey.
3).- THE MOVIE WILL BE INTERESTING, PERHAPS WILL BE FASCINATING: and ""Contact"" isn't the exception to this rule. The human beings are always interested in the study of other planets and solar systems, and we are always wandering if there is life in other place besides the Earth.
Robert Zemeckis is a director capable of tell a story in his movies, he has a lot of tricks and resources, he is very creative and he is always surrounded by the right people in every movie that he makes.

This is a tough issue to ""sell"" to the public and a difficult message to convey through the genius of Sagan. However, the job gets done and done well.

95975,5,0790733226,"In 1985, Pulitzer-prize winning author and astronomer Carl Sagan (1934-1996) wrote a brilliant ""what-if"" scenario in his novel entitled ""Contact"".  In the novel, Carl Sagan created a scenario in which his protagonist, a radio astronomer named Dr. Eleanor Ann 'Ellie' Arroway, discovers an extraterrestrial radio transmission that is clearly from an intelligent alien source.  The discovery causes intense debate between the proponents of science, religion and government that eventually leads to some very compelling questions on the nature of faith itself.  In 1997, the novel was transformed into a film of the same name under the direction of the well-known director Robert Zemeckis, who had previously directed ""Forrest Gump"" (1994, for which Zemeckis won the Oscar for Best Director), ""Death Becomes Her"" (1992), ""Back to the Future"" (1985) and ""Romancing the Stone"" (1984).
Carl Sagan, with assistance from writers Ann Druyan, James V. Hart and Michael Goldenberg, slightly modified the original story by giving Dr. Arroway (played by Jodie Foster) a more personal adversary in another astronomer, Dr. David Drumlin (played by Tom Skerritt).  At the beginning of the film, a brief exploration of Dr. Arroway's childhood (played by Jena Malone) is provided that helps to establish her purely scientific perception of reality that resulted in part from the passing away of her father, Ted Arroway (David Morse), who had also encouraged her love of science, astronomy and radio communications.  As an astronomer, Dr. Arroway dedicated her work to the SETI project (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence), which Dr. Drumlin considers frivolous and potentially damaging to Dr. Arroway's credibility.  With her governmental funding cut, Dr. Arroway eventually gets private funding after she approaches one of the world's richest and most influential men, S. R. Hadden (John Hurt).  With funding secured, Dr. Arroway's search continues at the Very Large Array (VLA) near Socorro, New Mexico.  With her unorthodox method of personally listening to outer space static, Dr. Arroway suddenly and unexpectedly hears a bizarre set of sounds.  She immediately gets her team, which includes Kent Clark (William Fichtner), busy working on analyzing the signal, which likely comes from an extraterrestrial source.  Once verified, she announces her discovery to the world via the news media, to the disdain of governmental officials including Dr. Drumlin, National Security Advisor Michael Kitz (James Woods) and then President Bill Clinton (himself via archive footage).  It also gains explosive response from very religious individuals who don't necessarily share Dr. Arroway's enthusiasm, except for Father Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey), whom Dr. Arroway met in Puerto Rico in a more than casual sense.  The content of the message itself raises some very large questions.
What really brought Carl Sagan's vision to life in ""Contact"" was placing it within a contemporary timeframe.  This included the use of many real events, people and places that included CNN, the VLA, the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and many cameos from current politicians the television personalities (Jay Leno, Larry King, Geraldine A. Ferraro, Geraldo Rivera to name only a few).  Also, Robert Zemeckis placed actors within archival footage in much the same way as he did with the film ""Forrest Gump"" in 1994.  All of this, as well as superb acting from the principal actors (Jodie Foster, Tom Skerrit, Matthew McConaughey, John Hurt, William Fichtner and James Woods), great cinematography, wonderful sets and great special effects make this a brilliant film.  Other memorable characters include Rachel Constantine (Angela Bassett), Richard Rank (Rob Lowe), the NASA Mission Director (Tucker Smallwood) and Joseph (Jake Busey).  Some of the most memorable scenes in the film include Dr. Arroway hearing the message at the VLA, the public response, the political discussions, Dr. Arroway meeting S.R. Hadden, the machine, Dr. Arroway's relationship with Palmer, the pinnacle event and its aftermath.
Overall, I rate ""Contact"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  In my opinion, it portrays many very probable debates and reactions if astronomers ever actually do discover intelligent extraterrestrial communication signals.  I applaud Carl Sagan for his vision, as well as Robert Zemeckis and the many actors and other people involved with the making of this very engaging and compelling film.",1073779200,319,4473,5.5131578947368425

Contact, apparently her creative child, ought to pop whatever ""genius balloon"" the folks in Hollywood have tried to pin on her sleeve.  This movie is slow, overbearing, and not very interesting--quite an accomplishment for a movie involving inter-stellar travel and first contact with intelligent life outside of Earth.  All in all, Foster holds her own compared to the insufferable performance from Matthew McConaughey.  Simply put, he is awful, attempting to portray an intelligent representative of the religious point of view.  He simply isn't up to that task, and comes across as more of a dumb hick way out of his element.  (Has he ever been good in anything?  Not that I've seen.)
So Contact just drags on and on, preaching this, prattling on about that, spoon-feeding us the life story of this preeminent scientist (Foster), showing us stereotypical intrigue between those who want scientific progress and those who do not.  Added for good measure are some sophmoric attempts to engage in philosophizing about ""big"" issues (which end up being just plain dumb) and an ending that simply isn't worth the wait.  The long, long wait as Contact crawls to its anti-climactic conclusion.",1070064000,4,1355,5.085972850678733
95988,2,0790733226,"Considering the subject it tackles, I always felt that Carl Sagan's `Contact' was a little bit of a let-down. It would be unreasonable to look for something of the order of Childhood's End let alone of Stapledon, but Contact trivialises itself in too many ways. When the author presents us with the undeniable evidence (fictional of course) that a major civilisation is consciously trying to reach us, to base a lot of the story round the issue of trying to obtain funding is sheer bathos. Also, to a European reader the whole issue of science-vs-faith is a complete non-issue seemingly introduced to play to a certain kind of American gallery, and even from that standpoint it is hard not to find ridiculously implausible the status the book gives to vested religious interests, to say nothing of an auto-da-fe being made the qualifying criterion for participation in the project.
The film could have alleviated some of this, but the production elects not to and instead throws in a variety of gratuitous downers of its own. It should be said at this stage that the film abruptly hoists itself on to a higher level towards the end, from the point where the alien machine first appears. Until then the camera-work is dull and average, the situations are void beyond belief of imagination, (the romantic theme in particular seeming a blatant crowd-pleaser), the dialogue is as flat and artificial as could be, and the only remaining hope was that the acting might raise the level a bit. No such luck. McConaughey is downright awful, but Foster and the rest of them are very little better, and it took a machine to rescue the production. The thought crossed my mind that if I had been the alien intelligence I would have hit the off-switch and looked for a more promising culture on Betelgeuse, Algol, Polaris or in another galaxy altogether.
I'm a bit of a sucker for light-shows, and my level of interest and involvement rose sharply when the alien machine started up. The actual alien contact is notoriously vague and inconclusive. There is nothing basically wrong with the idea as far as I am concerned, but it should have been developed in some way. Instead we are brought back to earth with a bump and the focus shifts back to the less-than-gripping topic of congressional hearings, this one featuring some perfectly farcical conduct by the committee chairman.
The story has the basic makings of real greatness, the film has some undoubtedly gripping sequences - so could I honestly manage to award it a third star? Not really. Not with any integrity or fairness to other productions.",1067731200,4,2588,4.844243792325057

95990,4,0790733226,"Adapted with the help of famous astronomer Carl Sagan from his book of the same title, CONTACT brilliantly brings to life the fictional story of astro-physicist Ellie Arroway (Foster) whose passion for the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence is matched only by her resoursefulness. She is instilled with a sense of wonder about the universe by her adoring father, a widower raising her alone until his untimely death when Ellie is only 9. She finds no comfort in the words of the minister who advises that she must accept his death as God's will. As an adult, she chooses to eschew religion and devotes her energies to the pursuit of science. When she meets and is attracted to Palmer Joss (McConaughey), a religious scholar, there is a clash over issues of faith.
  The plot revolves around  contact with an intelligent civilization many light years away that transmits blueprints for a machine of unknown purpose. But the strength of the story is the very well developed central character and Jody Foster's emotional portrayal of her (and Jena Malone does a wonderful job as the young Ellie). The story's lofty contemplations on faith vs. science and the implications for our planet of the discovery of extra-terrestrial intelligence lift this film above most other sci-fi. It also contains one of my favorite examples of imaginative cinematography. In a scene in which 9 yr. old Ellie discovers her father unconscious on the 1st floor, she races upstairs to get his medicine from the bathroom. In one continuous shot the camera tracks just ahead of and looking back at Ellie, from the 1st floor, up the stairs, turns down a hallway and into the bathroom. When she reaches for the medicine cabinet, you see that you have been looking into the reflection of the cabinet mirror the whole time. But of course, there is no way you could literally see Ellie's reflection in that mirror from the start of the shot, which began at the bottom of the stairs.",1065398400,2,1957,4.870870870870871
95991,5,0790733226,"Form the majestic opening of silence to the meditative ending, this is a powerful portrait of human desire for knowledge. The intelligence of this film - especially compared to the garbage shown daily - is just stunning  Jodie Foster has said about the heroine that it was the closest any character had gotten in representing her spirit. That is an outstanding compliment considering the main character is based on a real-life scientist and the movie shows her as skeptic, searcher and explorer.
The movie and the book have been compared both favorably and unfavorably but that should not be the case.  Both are excellent representations of their particular genre. The best one can say about their relationship is that the movie effectively captured the spirit of the book - if not exactly following the storyline.
CONTACT has been called science-fiction for ""thinkers"" and it is void of much of what is seen in current films of this type - no action-packed space shootouts, no morphing monsters, no aliens using ESP or advanced technology.  No, it is instead a quiet demonstration, as the main character states, that we as a race are so small and so insignificant and so precious when viewed in the background of the Universe. It is continually surprising, the plot consistently logical, the characters always ""in character"".  It is one of the best portrayals of scientists and their work with all the bickering, fighting, jealousy and in the end, awe upon discovering Nature's secrets.
Philosophically, it asks many questions.  The book deals more forcefully with the role of superstition and religion as it relates to scientific ventures.  Indeed, both the book and movie go to great lengths to explain that science does not demand blind obedience and is constantly challenged and tested in its assumptions and theorems.  Whether or not one believes that other alien civilizations exist, this film makes one wish that it were true.
Added kudos to the cinemtography and music.",1064880000,6,1978,5.049079754601227
95992,3,0790733226,"Contact was a film that interested me from the get go.  I loved the idea, and I guess I still do: a chance to make contact with Alien life and making it come across as real.  There is no question that this film provides a realness, an authenticity of plot mixed in with good acting.  What Contact lacks however is some contact with originality and general audience appeal and satisfaction.  Now what in the world did I just say?  Well let's analyze this movie:
Arroway played by the supberb actress Jodie Foster is a scientist who goes out of her way to be the first to make contact with recent Alien life that eventually becomes national, meaning it becomes obvious to the public.  Now two good things here that I liked:
1. It pretty much avoided the cliche of the big ""government conspiracy"" that so many sci-fi films feel they must have (until the end).  The government and public are just as surprised by the sudden alien contact as any one else.
2. You don't get to see Aliens, they are left up to the viewers imagination.  Another words, you don't know what this out of space life is.  This maintains interest and suspense.
Now, here's where it lacks originality.  Arroway is not an original character.  She's a scientist, a believer in new life out there, explorer, etc.  This is the character ""we"" as the audience would expect to be the main character.  Although it may be what we expect, that doesn't make it original.  What makes Close Encounters of the Third Kind better is that the main characters were ordinary people, with no expertise, learning and changing and developing as the film progresses.  Arroway changes hardly at all, because practically the film is about everything changing for HER.  Everything opens up to her from opportunities to beliefs.  We don't sympathize with her because she doesn't grow, only the plot grows around her.  And it should be the other way around.
Another cliche is Skerritt's death.  I'm sorry, you knew that was going to happen.  You knew some accident was going to take place to keep him from going up so Arroway could go in his place.  This plot is good, but it is at the same time predictable.  And because it's predictable, some of suspense goes down the drain.
Now the worst of all worst cliches in the movie is when she makes actual ""contact"" with a being that's in the shape of her father.  How utterly stupid.  How many films have I seen now that have this?  Visited by an image of her father, a ghost like figure, so many films do this.  They have to ruin this film by making the ""contact"" turning out to be a relative of hers.  There is no satisfaction to this, all the suspense during the whole film of wanting to know WHAT is trying to make contact is answered by adaptation of her father?!  What a waste.
That costed it one star, the cliches and the wasted suspense of this movie.  What costed it another star was that I really did not like the political/religious bias and slams and cliches in this movie.  I'm sure Athiests love this movie, because religion is dissed big time in this.  Half this movie was not about the contact from another life form, but rather the struggle between theoretical differences (Athiests vs. Religion).  This did create drama and friction between characters such as between Arroway and Palmer (Matthew McC.).  However, it came across as if this film had another objective in mind.  As if it was on a mission to show up religions and make it appear as if ""religion is the doorstopper in progression.""
I'm not the only one who thinks this, who was a little offended by how someone who believes in God is represented.  Sorry, Palmer didn't make a very convincing religious person.  He basically shies away from Arroway when the topic comes up, as if ""he knows she's right.""  And naturally for villains, the director has it be these religious wackos.  Then when Arroway is being interviewed by world leaders, they make it appear as if she's being persecuted for not having a religious belief.
Again, these are all slams and cliches against religion, and some of us like to see better representation in movies if it's going to be an essential element of the movie.  Not that the issue has to be ignored in movies, but create a balance not a bias.  Otherwise, leave the subject alone if you can't accurately or fairly represent the other side.  Because quite clearly there was an anti-religious agenda in this movie and I felt it uncalled for.
Other than the biasness and the lack of originality in climax and character, this film has a good storyline.  It has great acting, it is a very believable film.  And if not for these blackmarks, I would've considered among my top favorite sci-fi films.  But the director made a classic mistake in dividing the audience by slamming a belief system rather than telling a story without the anti-spiritual agenda.

95993,5,0790733226,"""Each of us is bound by a different covenant.  Each of us seeks truth in our own way.  Each of us, scientist, priest, spiritualist, agnostic, looks for answers that define our existance.  It is the quest, the journey, that each of us shares with one another.""
Contact is the story of Eleanor Ann Arroway (Ellie, for short) and her individual, life-long quest to seek answers to the questions ""Who are we? Why are we here?""  She seeks answers as a radio-astronomer, heading up a division of S.E.T.I. ((The)Search (for) Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) at Aracebo, and later at the VLA (Very Large Array) in New Mexico.  Her search, which spans many years of her adult, professional life, lead her to the discovery of a radio signal from Vega, a star roughly 4 light-years from Earth.
What unfolds in this epic story, originally written by Carl Sagan, reaches far beyond the realm of an average science fiction film.  It is the story of a woman, whose faith in science leaves her with more questions then it answers.  It is the story of a man, torn between the love of a woman, and the faith of the religious covenant he has dedicated his life to.  It is the story of a government, at once skeptical and manipulative, attempting to dictate the actions of a discovery that really belongs to the world.  And, ultimately, it is the story of each of us; of anyone who has ever asked the big questions:  ""Who are we?  Why are we here?""
Directed by Robert Zemeckis, and starring Jodie Forster, Matthew McConaughey, Tom Skeritt, James Woods, Angela Bassett and John Hurt, and featuring an incredible soundtrack by Alan Silvestri, this movie, which runs a little over 2 hours is absolutely well worth the time.  It is a story of contact with extra-terrestrials, but also much more, it is a story of contact with ourselves, and the values, beliefs, and covenants we hold most dear.",1063843200,3,1869,4.699386503067485
95994,5,0790733226,"This is a movie for anyone who's spent a night gazing up at the stars in the sky and wondered if there is other intelligent life in the universe. Contact perfectly captures the awe and wonder of realizing just how small and insignificant we are on Earth in comparison to the rest of the universe.
Jodie Foster conveys an infectious enthusiasm for knowledge that is such a refreshing change from the usual scientist-type normally depicted in science fiction films. You can't help but get caught up in her quest for signs of intelligent life in the universe and sympathize with her frustrations from fellow colleagues and government types.
The supporting cast is also excellent -- in particular, William Fichtner as a blind scientist (based on a real person, btw) is a real stand-out. He normally plays psychos or bad guys in movies and so it is really great to see him cast completely against type as a gentle soul who is very loyal to Foster's character.
The DVD is quite good in quality -- although, the extras do tend to lean to the special effects aspects of the film, which gets a little dull after awhile. However, the film's three audio commentaries are all good listens -- especially Jodie Foster who talks about her own personal passion for the project.
Contact makes a great double bill with another film, October Sky, which is also another story about a character in love with gazing up into the stars. Both of these films are based on real stories and are very well made. Definitely worth a look.",1062720000,6,1507,4.690566037735849
96005,4,0790733226,"Though not a perfect adaptation of Sagan's book, this is fairly loyal and ends with an effect similar to the novel.
The cast is definitely on top of things. Jodie Foster makes an impeccable Ellie Arroway, Matthew McConaugheh an effective, if somewhat youthful Palmer Joss, a reverend and Ellie's intellectual equal; Ken Der Heer's role is significantly downsized, but for his part he does well; Tom Skerrit is a perfectly pompous Dave Drumlin; James Woods a properly militaristic Michael Kitz; and, perhaps in the film's best performance (though he certainly did not have as much work as Foster or McConaugheh), John Hurt is a KNOCKOUT as S.R. Hadden. Oh yeah, and Rob Lowe has a nice role as the Reverend Billy Joe Rankin.
The technical aspects are definitely all there; the opening shot is beautifully done, and the special effects are stunning throughout. Though at first I thought the idea of Ellie and Palmer getting together would ruin it, I found it did not have much ill effect. I like also how they chose not to dwell on the hypocrisies of Mr. Rankin.
What is missing, and I think fans of the novel will agree, are Ellie's traveling partners, particularly Vaygay. C'mon, Zemeckis, you should know by now that any movie of this sort needs a smart alecky Russian to carry it in the slow spots.
Still, the thought provoking story remains intact, and the film was dedicated to Sagan, whom I'm sure would have been pleased with the outcome. Well Done.",1062288000,,1455,4.777777777777778

The payoff comes fast and furious as a transmission from outer space quickly transforms the quirky character played by Jodie Foster into a world renowned scientist.  I don't know who plays the eccentric billionaire, but he steals the show.  James Woods is a very formidable antagonist and will not give in throughout this movie.  He has national security in mind and does not budge on any of his stances through the movie.  You really begin to hate Tom Skerrit's character until he gets his final desserts.
Carl Sagan is a famous atheist, but this movie, which has been adapted from his book of the same name, is strangely a search for faith and a god we can all relate to.  Ironic, huh?",1060041600,,781,4.542857142857143

After seeing it again, what I really liked is not the somewhat silly scifi part of the plot but rather the relationship between Jodie F and Mathew M and the nature of believing in something that you can't prove... like proving that your dad loved you or proving that god exists.  It is our beliefs in this that can not be proven that makes us human.
The story about the puzzle and the trip to another planet was just background for the rest of it, and that is why I have seen this movie several times and enjoy it more with each viewing.",1059177600,,738,4.153846153846154
96008,5,0790733226,"I really wasn't sure that Carl Sagan's novel would translate very well to the big screen; after all, Sagan and his book were grounded in science, some of the most hardware-intensive scenes were left rather vague in the novel, and Sagan's atheism threatened to somehow taint the story's interplay of science and religion.  This movie, though, despite the fact that it necessarily differs from Sagan's novel at times, works amazingly well, even resurrecting a powerful ending under conditions that could be criticized by some in the two words ""nothing happens.""  Indeed, something amazing does happen, and even if it had not, one theme that I read into this story is that the journey is often more important than the destination.
This motion picture is (pardon the pun) stellar in so many ways, reflecting a rare level of commitment on the part of everyone involved.  This really starts with the cast.  The role of Dr. Ellie Arroway was a crucial one that, in the hands of the wrong actress, could have doomed the whole project.  Any concerns along these lines, though, were dispensed with immediately upon the signing of Jodie Foster, the greatest female actress of this generation.  Matthew McConaughey gives a better than average performance as Palmer Joss (the religious guy), Tom Skerritt is as unlikable as always in his role as the President's Science Advisor and frequent Arroway nemesis, and the rest of the cast excels as well.  The injection of then-President Clinton and a number of CNN journalists into a number of scenes also brings a most welcome feel of reality to the profound events taking place here.  The special effects are just wonderful.  The opening scene is as beautiful and memorable as any scene you will find anywhere, the animation of the giant machine is extremely realistic, and the visual aspects of space travel are also a sight to behold.  Not only do these great scenes delight the eyes, they remain true to the nuts and bolts of science that Sagan wanted in the movie.  This movie may be long by some standards, coming in at almost two and a half hours, but there's not one wasted scene.
The story is, in a sense, not all that complicated.  Ellie Arroway (Foster) finally gets a chance to realize her dream of searching for signals from outer space, only to find herself and her project stripped of funding by an unimaginative (or possibly secretive) government.  She and her colleagues refuse to let the dream die, and on one remarkable day they pick up a signal.  Once the signal is verified and word gets out, the public begins to wig out in a number of ways (quite overblown, in my opinion) and the government, specifically the military, swoops in to get their hands on the project.  Ironically, yet very plausibly, part of the signal ends up showing a clip of Hitler opening the Munich Olympic Games (which was the first television signal broadcast over a sizable area).  Arroway manages to persevere in her work, and eventually a message is discerned among the data, yielding blueprints for some type of great machine.  After plenty of government haggling, the machine is built, and one person is chosen to travel in what the scientists now come to believe is some type of interstellar craft.  The movie does not end here, though, not by a long shot.
I find a few aspects about this movie and Sagan's novel interesting on a personal level.  Sagan was a long-time exponent of the search for extraterrestrial life, yet at a certain point in his career, he noticeably changed and became one of the most unobjective bulwarks of the movement to discredit any and all UFO sightings and encounters; some have speculated that he became a participant in the official government policy of disinformation and dismissal.  I believe he would know better than most how the government would frown upon news as profound as the discovery of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe, and this movie certainly does show some of the dangers inherent in the military takeover of extraterrestrial projects.  I am also somewhat surprised at just how effective the juxtaposition of science and religion is presented here, given Sagan's lifelong atheism.  The religious aspect of the film works more in a spiritual than a Biblical sense, yet work it does.  There is obviously a lot of Sagan himself in Dr. Arroway, and this story, in both novel and motion picture form, stands as a true testament to one of the most influential scientists of modern times.",1057449600,,4472,4.855263157894737

Based on the late Dr Carl Sagan's book by the same name, ""Contact"" is an eloquent exposition about the conflict of opinion regarding science and religion.  No where is this more evident than in the range of reviews listed here and how the reviewers felt about the movie's message.
This is a ""deep"" movie - meaning it will appeal to those who like to think about their movies, rather than just experience them.  If you are hoping for a Heinlein ""Starship Troops"" action flick, forget it.  There is some amazing eye-candy in form of the much touted Earth fly-away in the opening and the psychedelic trip to Vega, (an obvious nod to another ""deep"" sci-fi film by another accomplished sci-fi author), but on the whole, this is film that will keep you occupied well past its 150-minute run time.
Is there reality a conflict between Science and Religion? Or is one a form of the other?  Can anyone really claim to be purely scientific or purely religious?  Or perhaps these are mutually supporting methodologies where the human race decides what it knows and what it doesn't know, but believes.  A review is not meant to answer these question, but viewing the film is certainly going to make you think about them.
Jodie Foster was perfectly cast in the role of Dr. Eleanor Arroway, an orphan turned scientist who is about as close to the purely-rational intellectual as a human can get.  (Remember, Mr. Spock was only half human.)  It was no doubt a risky move for a popular actress to play an atheist protagonist to an almost wholly religious audience, but Ms. Foster, noted for her integrity in choosing roles, delivers a performance that should have earned her an Oscar (or perhaps that was the price?)

Though much of what we hear coming from the mouth of Dr. Arroway (Jodie Foster), as directed at Palmer Joss (McConaughey), is presented with such an attempt at persuasion as you'd find in the characters of an Ayn Rand novel, the basic story is that life is a precious possession, to be cherished for all it is at the present moment.  The relationship of Ellie to her father is one of profound loss, but she will not accept God's will as explanation:  ""I should have kept the medicine in the downstairs bathroom--then I could have gotten to him faster"".  We are really left wondering about just what the actual ""phenomenon"" is that we have witnessed, since evidence proves finally lacking for the rigorously-grounded scientist to follow.  Sagan's awareness of the kind of fringe groups that ""are out there"" is illustrated by the mass-celebration and -demonstration held outside the Very Large Array, even to include a chapter of the Chevy Vega collectors' association, in honor of the star that has finally heard our stray RF from the 1930's and sent back its reply.  The response of the Clinton administration (though I understand the clip of him giving a press conference was lifted from another context) in militarizing the project might even find support among the UFO conspiracy-types.  But Dr. Arroway does not care; she has taken up the banner of scientific inquiry and integrity, so she needs to tell ""everyone"".  The ""machine"" is exceptionally well-modeled for the screen, though we have to wonder about some of what is purported to go on when the capsule finally reaches the core.  We are given imagery to remind us of the transport in ""2001:  A Space Odyssey"", or as later seen in Neo's initiation via the Rabbit Hole in ""The Matrix"".

Fourth, depth.  It tries to touch on many points that it never probes any of them in depth.

Throughout the enitre film you will be cheering her on, as you quickly realize she is the ""outcast"" of the scientific world.

Undoubtedly the worst part of this awful remake of an excellent, thought proving book is at the end, where in big letters it comes up with the words ""For Carl"".
At that point I nearly threw something at the screen.
Carl Sagan was an atheist. Contact, the book, contains some intelligent, thought provoking, discussions between two of the main characters ; the atheist Arroway, and the Christian Joss. The ""extremist"" views on both sides are represented by Drumlin and Rankin. Rankin, as far as I can see, has been removed altogether. Most of the discussions between the two main characters have been rewritten so that the balance becomes blatantly pro-religion. For example, at one point, the Joss character asks Arroway ""Did you love your father - prove it"" which is the asinine kind of thing an asinine religious person would ask ; and absolutely not the kind of thing the Palmer Joss character in the book would ask.
Worse still is the end of the film. In the book, Arroway is basically paid off and hushed up. In the film, there is a big set piece investigation in which Arroway is asked ""questions"" - this is an unsubtle piece of propoganda in favour of religious faith.
Back to ""For Carl"". Carl Sagan ; the author I've read in Contact and various other books would have disowned this movie, and probably stopped it. Hence the title.

96030,4,0790733226,"Hollywood grinds out yet another movie about making contact with an alien. Ho-hum, right? Hold on. This one is grounded in the real world for a change, not the la-de-da what-if world of a fantasizer (although those can often be quite entertaining; it's just that this one is refreshing because of the perspective of writer/producer Carl Sagan).
We see the struggle of the modern scientist to be taken seriously, the single-mindedness that marks the great mind, the helplessness of losing control of one's ""baby,"" all in the setting of a visually unique experience that's as dazzling as anything I've seen on film.
Yet it's also Sagan's perspective that spoils the experience on one level. His evolution-based theories have always caused him to be singled out for opposition commentary by those who believe in Creation rather than his purist form of natural selection. Therefore his story includes snotty religionists (Rob Lowe in a bit of bizarre casting, thinly disguised as Jerry Falwell) and mindless fanatacism masquerading as religious fervor (stunning role by Jody Busey, son of Gary).  This smacks of possibly a ""strike back at them"" attitude in Sagan's heart, as he seems to see ALL Christians now as wild-eyed freaks and self-righteous hypocrites.
Sagan's idea of presenting a balanced perspective toward those with religious views is to include a near-priest who dropped out because he ""couldn't handle celibacy"" and hops into the sack with Foster right away, yet is our Godly hero. Puh-leeze. Have to have sex to sell tickets, I guess, but that's seriously left field. Likewise the government people and department heads are all one-dimensional bad guys.
I continue hope in vain that the movie industry at large can one day manage to lose its prejudice against us with a deep faith in God, and thereby present Christians as real three-dimensional people rather than one-note props to play off of and treat as idiots, yet there is no doubt that the story of ""Contact"" is moving and exciting, visually hypnotic and inventive. Obviously it does not commit the sin of boring the viewer; it's one you can debate after seeing it.
Further, major props to the makers for at least presenting the scientist herself even-handedly. She is not Ms. Perfect. That would have been unforgivable. It's a shame she's the only character in the entire story who really seems like a real person with complexities and a past. For a 2-1/2 hour film, you'd think at least one other character would have the hint of a personal history.

It also shows that although science can do wonders, it is not the answer to everything (by the way, my background is in the hard sciences).

96033,4,0790733226,"Having owned and seen many DVD's since getting my player in '98, I can now come back and say that this is one of the best. CONTACT is based on a book by Carl Sagan, and I approached it with caution but interest. It was a wonderful film to see on the big screen and of course lost some of that power in the transfer to your TV set. That aside, the transfer is GREAT and the sound-especially if you have DD 5.1 (I believe there is a DTS version as well) -is fantastic. The extras are actually interesting here; I really loved the explanation of the computer animated sequence for the opening of the picture. The other menu items are also interesting.
Knowing Sagan's proclivities, I figured there would be a strong 'bash on religious thought' undercurrent to the film. I was pleased to see that that was not the case. The monumental issues of faith and science were *generally* dealt with respectfully. I did find Matthew M's character (former man of the cloth Palmer Joss) to be an interesting foil for Jodie Foster, SETI scientist, answering her pointed questions with even more thought-provoking statements like ""Prove it."" I appreciated that because, in fact, the naturalist/rationalist is at the same pains to support their ideologies. But I digress... Perhaps the most interesting point to the entire film is the way in which Foster's doubting character is forced to defend herself in the face of evidence that she imagined the entire experience. This alone leads me to believe that the entire purpose of the film is to tell the story of one person's transformation from skeptic to surprised and berated believer. How interesting...
On the other hand, the preacher has no problem sleeping with Jodie Foster which was more than a bit strange, and the film's consistant portrayal of religious followers/leaders as morons and lunatics (Busey) grated on me after a while. Ugh. How tiring. How a number of reviewers can claim that this film was some sort of religious propaganda is *beyond* me.  Outside of 'Palmer Joss' the 'religious' characters are anything but likeable.  In the end, the film was still very good and well worth seeing despite these issues. It remains a powerful film with amazing originality.  The effects are wonderful, the displays of CNN crew and President Clinton effective at first, then a bit annoying.  Finally, to answer the question 'What was the point of having Jodie Foster travel all that way to meet her father?'  Uh, I think the reasons for that are obvious:
1)  To prove to some of the numbskull film audience out there that perhaps not everything in life is not tied up with a ribbon as nicely as we want it to be.
2)  The fact that perhaps this alien culture tailors these trips to the individual making them-and they knew that Foster's character had unfinished business with her father.
3)  Plus, rather than overloading Foster's character, they presented themselves in a pleasing form.  Makes sense to me.",1036540800,3,2944,4.8023715415019765

Rather than highbrow entertainment we are drawn to the characters and really feel the character Jodie Foster portrays.
My only criticism is the pseudo-religious character played by Matthew McConaughey which is a more sterilized version of presenting the religious element.  But the religious element is necessary to make the whole thing work or it becomes just another sci-fi flick.  Perhaps in places the movie is a bit over the top but in the end it works.
Visually the film is remarkable.  It is not overladen with special effect but the special effects that are present are dynamite.

96052,4,0790733226,"I too have seen the movie N many times and have even read the
book, and as a result, I too appreciate how much better the movie is than
the book, and here is why:
Here is Why the Movie 'Contact' improves on Sagan's original book IMHO:
1. it is not clear why there is no explanation in the SETI message of what the
  object of the trip is to be, i.e. why go?  In the  book the aliens evidently
  cant resist showing us the equivalent of  their hobby room, just like a nerdy
  earthling,  'hey come on over  and look at my widgets' (see pg 364 ""that's
  what we mainly do - engineering"")  But in the movie, there is zero technical
  presentation from the alien contact,  only a spiritual connection, so
  evidently the purely technical nature of  the original message was a trick or
  lure to fool a techie-obsessed culture into being directly shown by an
  'incredibly technologically advanced' civilisation that, 'hey, that's not
  where it's at, loving one another is where it's at'.
2. Removing the technical content from the actual contact experience  was a
  stroke of genius and greatly increased the power of the movie, and gave it a
  subtlety missing in Sagan's book.
3. Sagan's vision of the alien's interests are just extrapolations on his
  own.  He evidently would like to design galaxies.
  Also, the aliens are not motivated by a quest for knowledge, but out
  of boredom.  (pg 364: ""no new galaxies .. just the same old crowd.
  Everything's getting run down. It'll be boring."")
  (""Against boredom, the gods themselves struggle in vain."" - Nietzsche)
  In the movie, the aliens are evidently motivated out of love, there is
  no hint that they are bored.
  ""See, in all our searching, the only thing we've found that makes the
  emptiness bearable, is each other.""
  -Dad-prime
4. Sagan tries to make the case that a scientist's experience of the
  'numinous' in calculating pi to N-billion digits is on a par with the
  religious experience of the numinous.  He misses the point that one
  person's calculation makes another's irrelevant and redundant, whereas
  one person's religious experience of the numinous, does not make
  another's redundant.  This the message of Ellie after the return:
  'I wish everyone could have this experience'.  She is cast in the
  classic position of every earth mystic in history, rendered incapable
  of conveying the numinosity but yearning for everyone to participate.
  Yet both the book and movie fail in making the leap to the religious
  experience of the numinous as being valuable precisely because it is
  available to all and not dependent on a BIG EXPENSIVE MACHINE.
All this is not to denigrate Sagan's book which I enjoyed.  And I think he
might agree the movie improved on his original concept in ways he hadnt
thought of, and I am sure he would have delighted in the unforeseen
improvements, like a real scientist.
Rest In Bliss, Carl, we love ya :)

Everything in the movie seems to reflect a level of involvement that real life rarely offers, creating a tension which is so great that the best scene in the movie was cut because someone laughed at that point in the preview.

96073,5,0790733226,"A film very much in the league of such sci-fi giants as 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, and E.T., director Robert Zemeckis' 1997 film CONNTACT is one of the genre's most stunningly intelligent films of all time. Clearly having learned much about displaying a sense of cinematic wonder from his mentor Steven Spielberg, Zemeckis has fashioned a film that, like ""2001"", has elements of spiritualism, mysticism, and child-like awe.
Jodie Foster is Dr. Eleanor Arroway, an ambitious radio astronomer who, ever since she was a young girl, has been dreaming of making contact with other beings from outer space. As her ambitions grow, there is, of course, plenty of resistance from other corners of the scientific community to her search--especially from her mentor (Tom Skerritt), who sees this as wasteful, pie-in-the-sky stuff. But when Foster and her team at New Mexico's Very Large Array radio telescope field in New Mexico detect an actual alien signal (represented in prime numbers) eminating from the star Vega, some twenty-six light years away, all bets are off. Despite the somewhat ominous beginning to this (the signal is eventually found to have been in response to the first-ever TV transmission on Earth, which were the opening ceremonies to the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, presided over by Adolf Hitler), further research, funded by an eccentric engineer (John Hurt) reveals the desire on the part of the aliens for the human race to build a space pod that will hurl itself towards Vega at or near the speed of light.
Immediately, of course, there is a worldwide firestorm of controversy, and not just from the scientific community. The religious community, particularly America's religious right-wing, comes to attack Foster and her fellow scientists for wanting to contact aliens who might not believe in God (or their version of Him). Foster does, however, have one sympathetic friend in that community--Reverend Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey). When, during a test of the new pod, Skerritt is killed by a fanatic religious bomber, it is up to Foster to make that ultra-perilous journey to Vega.
When she does, she stunningly meets up with her father (David Morse), whom she lost at an early age. Her return to Earth and her story is met with unbridled incredulity and iron skepticism. But McConaughey chooses to take the high road in this case, stating that although the two of them operate under different covenants of thought, their goals are one and the same--the pursuit of truth.
Based on the only fictional novel written by the late Carl Sagan, creator of the legendary PBS-TV series ""Cosmos"", CONTACT is a very lengthy and extremely ambitious film that succeeds far more often than it slips (which is extremely rare here). As with any of the great science fiction movies, the special effects and the hardware are incredibly spectacular; but going hand in hand with all this are a highly credible story and some fine acting, particularly by Foster, whose performance here is as good as anything she has given us since THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.
With newsreel references to the religious cult murders that occurred in San Diego shortly before the film's release, as well as video cameos by Geraldo Rivera, Geraldine Ferraro, and president Bill Clinton (some of them admittedly resembling humorous asides more than they do advancements in the story), CONTACT is also topical. By having McConaughey's character display a genuine sympathy towards Foster's approach to things, the film does not balance science over religion; but it also does not fail to condemn certain segments of the religious community for trying to force their values onto others. In essence, CONTACT is a plea for understanding among all the world's people, and bravely suceeds in telling us that ours is not the only intelligence that God may have bought forth.

There is really so much to rave about, suffice to say the movie is perfect in my perception.  The inclusion of the cages, in such a fantastic glimpse (when she is in space en route to Vega and pausing, looking up), is merely evidence of the profundity of the entire film, and a very edgy creativeness, which surfaces just barely in these glimpses, to expose that the film's perfection is far more than air tight.  It is, in a way, not finished.  There are certain scenes, which move on, logically, naturally, but leave an open page.  And all of this done in such a subtle way.

96091,5,0790733226,"It may be understandable that ""Contact"" is well seen in Carl's adopted town of Ithaca, NY, where his wife, Ann, still lives. Ann has said that Carl would be proud and happy with this film.
For me ""Contact"" was able to nicely walk the tightrope between fantasy and fact. A good many of the characters you see are based on real people that Carl knew in the SETI community. While we can't know what will happen when - and I do say when - we discover other life in the universe, ""Contact"" gives us a good account of  the nobility that the human race will show when it happens (embodied largely in Ellie), the ignomy (embodied largely for me in the portrayal of the Government and David Drumlin), and the  misplaced but sincere concern we'll all feel (embodied in Palmer Joss).
In the end ""Contact"" is actually not about the aliens. It's not about the search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. It's not about the science or the technology. Carl Sagan, as he did so many times, wrote a story about US - the human race, the human condition as we will be when we take that final, humbling step on the road Copernicus put us on so many centuries ago when he ripped the Earth from the center of the universe and put it as one of so many planets in the Solar System.
As such, ""Contact"" doesn't have to be seen as a Science Fiction film if you don't want to see it as such. You'll love this film if you've ever felt passionate about anything in your life. You'll love this film if you've ever had that passion challenged.

As long as imminently talented people like Robert Zemekis and Jodie Foster nurture the visionaries like Carl Sagan, Issac Asimov and those who follow, we will continue to evolve and we will do it in style. I am certain that some of those future visionaries will be inspired by this movie. Jodie Foster gives a dynamic performance, as good as anything she has done before. The special effects and the musical score are incredible. I have owned the VHS version of ""Contact since it became available and it was one of the first movies I purchased on DVD the first week I had my new player.

96106,5,0790733226,"This was my first DVD purchase, and I couldn't be happier. This is definitely one of the top five SF films of all time. I personally would place it third after 2001 and 2010, but ahead of any Star Trek or Star Wars film, as much as I enjoy them. Its strong points are its evocation of ""sense of wonder"" and intelligent treatment of a core SF theme; if you prefer action and special effects you would rank it lower. There are a lot of nice special effects here but they don't dominate the movie as in Star Wars.
I don't know of any other film that gives such a balanced presentation of the conflict between science and religion. My only problem was the claim that ""95% of the world's people believe in some sort of God"", a figure which is preposterously high but goes unchallenged in the movie. Ellie (the protagonist) should have laughed at this claim rather than being cowed by it.
Things you should know:
-- This release is lean in extra features; there is no extra video included. The only substantial extras are annotated reconstruction of some special effects and three alternate audio-commentary sound tracks, one by Jodie Foster herself. For someone like me who would be entertained listening to her read a phone book, her audio commentary is a real bonus, like having her sitting there next to me explaining the movie(!)
-- On a standard TV the video shows in a relatively narrow band; it's in 2.35:1 format, which is as far as I know the narrowest presentation used for DVDs; it uses just slightly more than half your screen. You should not let this prevent you from buying the DVD; like me, you will *someday* get a widescreen TV, and it's still quite enjoyable on a standard TV.",995500800,,1689,4.540983606557377

Jodie Foster is a great actress and gives a touching and very sincere representation for Ellie, the main caracter in the story.
The extras on the DVD were not that great, I think they could have showed more about Carl Sagan and his legacy.

96113,5,0790733226,"All of the greatest work by the greatest scientists has been done while they were very young, when they were stupid enough to believe that two-plus-two-equals-five, and pursued it instead of listening to all of those who were much older and wiser who said Don't Waste Your Time.  Einstein, it has been said, asked all of his important questions before the age of twenty-five, then spent the rest of his life working on them.  ""Contact,"" directed by Robert Zemeckis, is the story of a young scientist, Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster), who like Einstein and all the greats before her, has been asking questions and seeking answers since she was very young.  And now, as a member of the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) team, she is able to pursue her obsession with the mysteries of the galaxies and the infinite universe that surrounds us.  Her job is to sweep the skies, using the most sophisticated equipment available, for a signal from deepest space.  It may be her job, but for Ellie it's a labor of love, for she is convinced that there is something, or someone, out there somewhere, because otherwise, she reasons, what a terrible waste of space it would be.  Ellie may be a dreamer, but she knows in her heart that it is the dreamers who over the years have been responsible for making us evolve, making us learn and grow because they are the ones who take insane, foolish ideas and pursue them.  And to her, two-plus-two will always be five.
 Ellie loves her job and believes in what she is doing, but it's been a struggle over the years, as she and others have had to constantly fight for the funding necessary to keep the project alive, begging for dollars from short-sighted, unimaginative people with vision that goes only as far as the bottom line of their budget book.  It's been a tough row to hoe, and she's had to swallow a lot of pride over the years, but then one day it all pays off, when in one magic moment she hears what she's been waiting for all her life:  A signal from a distant end of the galaxy-- someone attempting to communicate, to make contact, with the people of the Earth.
 Ellie and her team soon realize that, whomever it is, they are using the universal language of prime numbers in their attempts at making contact; and when Ellie deciphers the code, she discovers something monumental in the bargain.  But it's a message of global importance, something much bigger than she and her team alone, and she soon find herself fighting to remain a part of the drama that is only beginning to unfold-- the first interaction between human beings and an alien life form.  And it's only the beginning of the adventure and the wondrous places this film is about to take you.
 Jodie Foster gives a performance here that demonstrates what a gifted, talented actor she is.  Her Ellie is convincing and believable, and someone to whom you can genuinely relate, no matter who you are or where you're from, because there is something universal in Ellie's passion and longing to discover the truth and to see beyond the veil of our limited mortal capacities.  There's a strength to Ellie, born of a combination of intelligence and innocence, as well as tenacity and faith, and Foster manifests all of these complexities of her character beautifully, with a performance that should've landed her an Oscar nomination.  In this role, she is simply as good as it gets.
 As the young Ellie, Jenna Malone gives a terrific performance, also, which certainly captures the same spirit that we find in the adult Ellie.  And there's a maturity she brings to the character that far exceeds her years.  She was a perfect choice for the part, and if this is any indication of what she is capable of, Malone has a successful career ahead of her.
 The supporting cast includes David Morse (Ted Arroway), Matthew McConaughey (Palmer), Geoffrey Blake (Fisher), William Fichtner (Kent), Tom Skerritt (David), James Woods (Kitz) and Angela Bassett (Rachel).  Zemeckis did a brilliant job of bringing this film to fruition, especially in the way he allowed Foster the time to really develop her character, by giving her that extra moment at just the right time that ultimately meant so much in the final analysis.  Too often it's those few minutes that wind up on the cutting room floor that make the difference between  a good film and an exceptional one; and between Zemeckis and Foster, they took it to the edge by taking some chances to realize that combined vision, which in the end made this a great film.  Thoroughly engrossing and entertaining, ""Contact"" will transport you to places you can only imagine, and it's all done with style and in a way that makes this a truly memorable cinematic journey.  It's what the magic of the movies is all about.",993427200,3,4769,4.715662650602409

If God wants aliens, God'll have 'em. If the next minute God doesn't want aliens, there won't be none. Same goes for us. There is no common ground.

You don't have to imagine it, because we have the reality of ""Contact"".  I had a lot of problems with this movie, some of which I'll list later, but overall I enjoyed it a lot.
The science of the movie was fascinating (even though I'm not familiar with the source material, the late Carl Sagan probably deserves much credit here).  A rag-tag group of science misfits picks up a pulse from outer space, and slowly learns the message contained within.  There's a fine moment near the end of this sequence where a video representation of the message is revealed, and it is a truly stunning moment, that carries much drama.  The message contains plans to build a machine, which will send one person to a distant star, presumably for enlightenment.  The ""machine"" is gloriously realized.  It is both beautiful and believable, its power palpable and awesome (especially in one scene where things go horribly wrong).  Director Robert Zemeckis uses his considerable skill at special effects very wisely here, giving us enough to keep the imagination entertained but never overwhelming the story.
Unfortunately, the less technical aspects of the movie are handled quite sloppily.
First, the acting.  James Woods and John Hurt, two actors I admire, had a tough time fleshing out their two-dimensional characters.  Woods didn't do anything more than show narrow-mindedness and anger, while Hurt was stuck in eccentric billionaire mode.  Rob Lowe, also playing a two-dimensional character, was just painful to watch, affecting a hoarse voice and a beatific smile that did little to hide the fact that his character was no more than a fluffy device to introduce basic religious arguments.  Ditto Jake Busey, as an over the top zealot who carried the added detriment of an albino fright wig and ""evil"" white-eyes.  Tom Skerritt fared better, although he was miscast.  Skerritt is usually fine when playing the saintly father figure; here he's asked to be a slick, egotistical bureaucrat, and doesn't pull it off.  Which brings us to Matthew McConaughey.  I had no problem with his acting, but the character was completely implausible.  A man with a self-help book at number one on the bestseller list would not get this much time with the President, especially if his ideas were as lame as Matt's 'Palmer Joss'.  He represents a bigger problem with the movie, in that the fight between science and religion is handled in a very passionate, but utterly simple-minded way.  I suspect that some of the book's big ideas and arguments were dumbed down for a mass audience.  It's unfortunate, wasting an opportunity for intelligent mass discourse.
The lone bright spot in the cast is -- duh -- Jodie Foster.  I admit to being ambivalent about Foster in the past, but here she won me over.  Her Dr. Arroway is meant to have passion, drive, brains, desire, spunk, and innocence.  Foster pulls off all of these traits wonderfully.  There were some moments near the end, when Arroway takes flight (""They should have sent a poet,"" she cries when confronted by an ineffable view of space), that in the hands of a lesser actor would be hokey.  Foster gets them all right.
I get the impression that Zemeckis himself doesn't trust the weight of the ideas he's putting forth here, because he does several things that distract the audience from them.  First, the relationship between a young Arroway and her father was manipulation of the highest order.  It's pop psychology that anyone can understand on an emotional level, rather than the intellectual level, which should have been the movie's strength.  Also, he employs ""testimony"" from real-world media figures (it seemed like the entire staff of CNN appeared on screen at one point or another) to lend the ideas credibility.  In fact, the ideas were undermined because of this.  The same can be said for his liberal use of news footage of President Clinton, whose intentionally vague speeches are supposed to relate to the film's narrative, but rather prove distracting.
There is a lot of potential in ""Contact"".  I was gripped by the story, even though a lot of the times I felt like a machete-wielding explorer hacking my way through a jungle of debris to get to it (I have the sneaking suspicion that Zemeckis realizes this, for he includes a take-off of the line ""Dr. Livingstone, I presume"").

Where Sagan's work was an astonishingly thrilling and inspiring story of questions and searching,and the great wonder of everything we know and have yet to learn about what's way out there and deep inside,the film is simply an over-produced acting vehicle for Jodi Foster,who in my opinion was a poor choice to play the lead character in the first place(for some reason,I always though that Janeane Garafalo would have been ideal;she seems to me to embody both Ellie Arroway's tenacious contrarianism and her genuine passion for knowledge,plus she seems to more closely resemble Sagan's physical descripition of her).And the contrived romance between Foster and Matthew MacConaughey's Palmer Joss smacks of Hollywood interference;in the book the two characters never developed more than a grudging respect for each other.

96133,1,0790733226,"This is one of the many books that never survived the transition to film.  The director concentrated on special effects (which are impressive) but completely ignored the more important elements of character and message.
Jodie Foster does a respectable job, given the script, as Ellie Arroway.  The rest of the cast is entirely forgettable.  In the novel, the character S.I. Hadden is terribly important to the philosophical debate.  He is reduced in the film to a bit part, and a kook.
Sagan's novel is an elegant debate between Science and Religion.  Both are given the respect and skepticism the righly deserve. The novel is brilliant in its observations about the orthodoxy of both.  The novel's characters are rich and fully developed.  The film fails miserably.
The novel is less a sci-fi story than a rich debate of philosophy.  The film is nothing more than sci-fi special effects.  Several important characters from the novel are ""rolled into"" a single, rather pathetic, character of the film.
Perhaps the most egregious sin the film makes is creating a sexual relationship between Arroway (Jodie Foster) and Palmer Joss (Matthew MacChaughay).  This NEVER HAPPENED in the novel, and it completely destroys the intellectual content of the novel.
The film was originally supposed to be made by Franscis Coppola.  In the year or two prior to Sagan's death, there were some legal problems, and Coppola lost the rights to the film.  Instead, it was made by Robert Zemenkis.  Zemenkis destroyed the novel, and create a most mediocre film.  We can only wish that Coppola had the chance to make it.
Skip the film. Read the book.  The book is an elegant dialog between Science and Religion.  The film is just a movie. The only thing worse they could have done in the movie is cast Tom Hanks.",982972800,47,1790,4.897009966777409

Jodie Foster plays Dr. Ellie Arroway, who, from the time she was a small child, dreamt of one day making contact with someone or something in outer space. Her favorite activity: talking on the ham radio with her father until his untimely death, which further impacts Ellie's decision to one day achieve her dream of discovering new life in outer space. In her adult years, when all looks glum for her project, her array of radio telescopes receive a mysterious signal coming from the vicinity of the star Vega, and there is no scientific explanation for it. Further tracking of the signal leads to the discovery that the ""message"" contains blueprints of a costly yet collosal machine, which everyone wants to be a part of. Hypothesizing that the machine has been sent to them as a transportation device, Arroway wishes to be the one to commandeer the vessel, and gets her chance after a deadly explosion caused by a religious fanatic that sabatoges the first machine. But, the Americans always have a backup plan, and once Arroway is cast out into space, she will encounter something she never thought possible. But upon return, will they believe her?
The main contrasting viewpoints that the story conveys are the difference between how religious people view the creation of the universe and the way scientists interpret the origins of life and space. Once the signal is discovered, it does not take long before religious fanatics are crowding the entrances to galas and scientific laboratories, shouting verses from the Bible and slogans like ""God created man, not monekys."" Then there are the scientific opinions, all embodied within the character of Ellie Arroway, who firmly believes that she is correct in wanting facts to prove that there is such an entity as God. Like all scientists, she relies on fact-based data and equations to relate certain truths to herself as well as the world, so it is no surprise that her position regarding religion will keep her from being the first chosen candidate to embark on the journey.
The scene in which the first transport machine is given a test run is the centerpiece for how far religion will take some people when they feel a need to express their opinions. Throughout the movie, Ellie comes into eye contact with a man who is always surrounded by shouters and ""Bible thumpers,"" his eyes piercing into her in a way that forces her to look away. It is his actions that cause the catastrophe: disguising himself as a machine technician, he carries on his bodice powerful explosives that will destroy the machine and send his ""message"" to the world that he is only doing this ""for the sake of mankind.""
Perhaps the most empowering scene that will captivate those of us who have mixed feelings about the existence of God and the creation of all that surrounds us is the scene in which Ellie is transported to another world, a place she cannot put a name to with a person whom she has missed all her life. Her rendevous with this person is the embodiment of the one question that the movie leaves us with: did she really become transported to another world, or was it her imagination? Forced with the harsh facts of the second machine's operation, she is forced to look inside of herself, realizing that she, along with the religious folk, all base their ideas and beliefs on one thing alone: faith.
The entire movie is a movie about the beliefs of people who feel differently than others, while also keeping one thing very clear: faith is the basis for anyone's opinion, whether religion-based or scientific. What makes this movie so clear and understandable to me is that it is able to handle both sides of the argument without ever really taking a side. Even when we take that final trip with Ellie, because of what happens to her after returning, we as the audience do not know what to believe, and like the movie, confusion reigns. But once we hear her final arguments to the world, the realization is made clear for us, that we must look to our own beliefs in order to come to an understanding of what has happened to this woman. Did she really see her father? Was it all a delusion? You make the choice.
The story, which is based on the highly acclaimed novel by Carl Sagan, is a spectacular mirror to the novel. While the fact that the book and the movie do have a lot of differences in plot and structure (in the book, Ellie and Palmer Joss never get involved romantically), they work as two separate stories, really. The movie does a very credible job of bringing the social issues and emotion of the characters to life, keeping the important elements of the book while revamping others in order to make the script more impactful and exciting, which is not a bad thing in this case. The fact that Carl Sagan was also a producer for the movie before his death is an added plus, as he knew more about the material than others on the crew.
Acting and performance employed is superb, maintaining the highest standards of believability and emotion. Jodie Foster gives her best performance since that of Clarice Starling in ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" and is able to keep the movie going through her character's passion and will for scientific truths and discoveries. We share this journey with her, and from the very beginning, we find ourselves totally willing to take it. Matthew McConaughey portrays Palmer Joss, the ""man of the cloth, without the cloth,"" who has his own viewpoints and opinions about religion and science. His character is the side of society that is able to come to an understanding of both arguments and combine them together in his hypothesis. His part in intrical to this movie, as he will be the bridge between Ellie and religion, which she later turns to.
Visually stunning, emotionally captivating and relentlessly impacting, ""Contact"" is a movie for the ages, a film that leaves us with theories rather than facts and data. In a manner of speaking, the ending of the movie is a bit of a summary of the entire film as a whole: the search for facts and where it leads us to. Right from the beginning, we suspect the presence of alien life with the arrival of th signal, yet director Zemeckis and writer Sagan are able to dodge this avenue of storytelling and give us something that is altogether more magical, emotional and warming.",981417600,5,6715,4.7157446808510635

The two meet up later in Washington after Ellie discovers a pattern of prime numbers sent back from the Vega system.

The next conflict is, who gets to go...well, we know who it eventually turns out to be, and for all her doubts in a higher power, Arroway now faces the challenge of scrutiny when the time she has spent ""away"" from earth doesn't jive with the events experienced by everyone else. Interesting philosophical overtones, and the question of ""Are we alone in the universe"" are subtlely asked in this film.

The film contains two prominent themes: a conflict between science and religion, and the wonder and excitement of discovery.  It is slow-moving and deliberate, and yet contains some incredible special effects in the final act.  The result is an extremely absorbing and up-lifting experience.  Contact centers around a bravura performance by Jodie Foster as Dr. Elinor Arroway, an astronomer obsessed with the idea of life in other galaxies.  The Foster character is in virtually every scene of the movie, but is aided by terrific supporing characters.  In particular there is Ellie's father (David Morse), who motivates her as a child to pursue her dreams; Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey), theologian and love interest; and billionaire Hadden (John Hurt - almost unrecognizable), who provides the financial stability for Ellie at just the right moment of her life.  The discovery of a signal from outer space by Ellie triggers the beginning of the second act of the film, and I had great fun at this point watching the world come together, trying to figure out what to do next.  I won't reveal any more, since the key to the enjoyment of the movie is discovering at the same time as the characters. Definitely a must-own.",977961600,,1353,5.090497737556561

I can't think of any other reason that ""Contact"" wasn't resoundingly laughed out of bookstores, much less theaters. I know my friends and I were reduced to helpless tears halfway through.
The very notion that Jodie Foster is listening to the various frequencies that SETI is scanning for signs of extraterrestrial life is foolish enough, but then the flaws are compounded by repeated improbable meetings with priest Matthew McConaughey. Apparently, his character's dialogue with Foster's is supposed to be thought-provoking and challenging. Apparently, the screenwriters have never actually had a thought-provoking or challenging conversation.
The payoff to all this foolish mumbo-jumbo is a machine the alien message provides for communicating with them, followed by actual contact. Sagan boldly goes where few esteemed figures have gone before, and rips off John Varley's novel ""The Ophiuchi Hotline"" for the idea of the aliens giving out plans for an interstellar communication device. Then we get the note-for-note theft of the climax of ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Space turns out to be Heaven, where lonely little girls can meet aliens-shaped-like-Daddy. It was a foolish concept in ""2001"" and it doesn't smell any better second-hand.
I urge everyone dazzled by this film to pick up works by Arthur C. Clarke and John Varley. At the very least, you should be enjoying the (far superior) original source material, rather than regurgitated nonsense.",977356800,6,1580,5.324

Robert Zemeckis' movie cleverly takes a look at what would happen if we discovered evidence that we are not alone. It sets itself apart from blockbuster science fiction like ""Independence Day"" because of how realistic it is, how convincing and plausible. The screenplay by James V. Hart and Michael Goldenberg, based on the novel by Carl Sagan, is filled with interesting characters, but more with interesting ideas. We also appreciate how they add philosophical arguments into the mix. Most science fiction films don't really explore the debates about God and science, this movie does, by letting the two main characters debate about the issues. The movie is also entertaining on the dramatic angle and the special effects are wonderful to look at. The movie has style and realism mixed with science and deep philosophical issues. I have nothing against the ""cool"" stuff like ""ID4"" or ""Mars Attacks!"" but ""Contact"" is a breather for people looking for something smart and thoughtful.

Jodie Foster's performance as a slightly geeky (but secrety rather attractive) scientist is spot on, especially her cheeky rendition of Sagan's own goofy accent, but the remaining characters are cartoonish and a bit theme-functional: for once, the bimbo is a bloke - that Matthew McConaughey's hokey priest is Foster's love interest and intellectual adversary fits nicely with the battle of intellect vs. emotion which is waged throughout the film, but as a credible character he just doesn't stack up. The same is true of Tom Skerrit's Big Bad Boss Who's Only In It For The Glory.
For all that, you're certainly left mulling over the notion of contact, in all its manifestations (you know, with little green men, with other human beings, with your lost father, with your spiritual side etc.) throughout, and given that the author of the screenplay was a thoroughly scientific and sceptical chap, the final message is one of surprising humility and irony.
Ostensibly the conflict is between science (which needs to know The Truth, whatever the religious consequences) and blind faith. But when the arch-sceptic finally establishes (...or does she?) her argument, can she prove it to a sceptical public?  Quelle dilemma! Lesson learned!",976406400,2,1520,5.104417670682731

Before I forget, I want to recommend looking at ""Carl Sagan: A Life"" by Keay Davidson, or at ""Black Holes and Time Warps"" by Kip Thorne.  Both have some discussion of this movie -- Kip Thorne's discussion mostly has to do with Carl Sagan consulting him about the wormhole idea, but still.  Or, for more about the Drake Equation, look in your copy of Michael Crichton's ""Sphere"".
This movie captures the excitement of astronomy, and the feel of SETI-like programs, to a ""T"".  Jodie Foster is terrific -- I wonder if she considers this one of her better roles.  I hope so, because she blew me away.  Tom Skerrit plays a complete jerk, which is sort of a stretch for him, as he generally seems to get more solid, midwestern-American-values sorts of roles...  He does a good job though.  Rob Lowe has a minor but interesting part, as the movie's version of the real-life Ralph Reed -- look it up, seriously, that guy is worth knowing more about.  Also, Angela Bassett plays a powerful African American woman with her usual aplomb.  She brings a lot of intelligence and vividness to her part.  James Woods is pretty terrific too -- I would give a lot to hear his input on various scenes, he's no dummy, science-wise, as a real-life M.I.T. graduate.
The excitement of science is what you walk away from this movie feeling.  So often scientists in movies are ""mad scientists"", or maybe an action movie hero type with a slightly introspective streak.  Jodie Foster's character is an atheist, a scientist, and of course a woman, but she makes a great heroine.  Generally this movie just rocks, and rocks hard.

I can't remember any science-fiction film after 2001: A Space Odyssey to be this thought-provoking, and while Contact is not quite as profound a statement as the aforementioned opus, it still has quite a lot to say for itself. Jodie Foster plays an earnest scientist who spends her whole life searching for extra-terrestrial life and finds vindication when a message is received from outer space. Naturally, it throws the world into a huge frenzy, and despite the efforts of kitschy bad guy Tom Skerritt and military operations-head James Woods, she gets to go on a journey to the heart of the universe and see whether or not she can find the answers she's looking for.  Perhaps it's a little hokey, but I found myself totally captivated throughout the whole film, and the adventure Foster goes through in the last third of the picture is one of the most thrilling sequences in the films of 1997 (not the least because Foster, surrounded by all these new worlds she's viewing, can act the scene to pieces, which is amazing considering the fact that we know she really sat in front of a blue-screen for two weeks).

To me, the film brings a compelling  comparison of science and religion, emphasizing the importance of faith for  both ambitions.  Others feel the film contrasts science and religion, with  the former based on probabilities and the latter on faith. Whatever you  take from this film, it is guaranteed to occupy your thoughts well after  the credits roll.
I would have given this film 5 stars except for one  unneccesary and detracting scene.

This is what WE would transmit and do transmit because such signals cannot be mistaken for natural phenomena.  It's obvious that what we have here is intelligent science fiction.  The  general public may be surprised to learn-I know I was-that a significant  segment of the scientific community considers the Search for  Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) a pie in the sky waste of money and  human energy.  The prejudice is so great that until recently no  self-respecting astrophysicist would dare specialize in it for fear of  having no career.  Well, there are a few brave souls.  This is a movie  about one of them.
I didn't read the book-shame on me, but works of  fiction by scientists usually make me blush in embarrassment for their  authors.  But Carl Sagan was no ordinary scientist, nor was he an ordinary  writer.  Still I suspect that what made this an excellent movie was the  script by James V. Hart and Michael Goldenberg.  It is extraordinarily well  thought out and carefully crafted with deft turns of plot and a satisfying  conclusion, with no need for spaghetti code patches near the end, the bane  of most sci-fi and action/adventure flicks.  It is also emotionally  moving.
There is, however, just the slightest ""written by committee"" feel  to the movie.  Everything is a little too neat and too well explained.  It's a paradox of any art form that sometimes you can polish too much, you  can overwrite and lose some spontaneity in the production.  And yes, Palmer  Joss (Matthew McConaughey) is a little too good to be true, and Arroway  (Jodie Foster) really needs a serious fault or at least some kind of vice  to round her out.  Being a political innocent isn't enough.  And the media  and governmental reaction is a little too pat and cynical.
However all of  that is insignificant compared with the most difficult thing about writing  a futuristic or ""superior civilization"" story, namely coming up some  unknown technology or information to make it seem real.  The formula for  cold fusion would work, or the cure for cancer.  But how can you do THAT?  You can't (otherwise what you come up with would probably be more important  than your script).  It is fascinating to see how Sagan, Hart, Goldenberg  and Director Robert Zemeckis cleverly sidestep this pitfall.  Only those  who have tried it can know what a fine job was done here.  And incidentally  Zemeckis can be given credit for making ""Contact"" intelligible without any  dumbing down, no mean feat in itself.
As far as star Jodie Foster goes,  it's clear she inhaled and imbibed the persona of the modern woman of  science in preparation for this role, so well does she play the part of  astrophysicist Ellie Arroway.  They have her come out looking androgynous,  which is appropriate for two reasons, one, she lost her mother early and  had to identify with her father more than most (an explanation, if one were  needed, for how she became a scientist); and two, those little green beings  aren't going to be men or women, having given up our sort of primitive  sexuality long ago.  She is never glamorized; even when she dresses up, she  still looks like a normal woman in a gown.  And she is appropriately  unpolitical and naive and far too honest in front of the camera.

While that is part of the reason that I gave this movie 5 stars, I was even more  impressed by the director's ability to catch a glimpse of what can be the  dog-eat-dog world of scientific funding, credit and credibility.
Jodi  Foster plays a brilliant, budding young scientist who wants to pursue SETI  (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) work.  Her former mentor (Tom  Skerritt), now head of the National Science Foundation (the government's  primary funding agency for science), sees that work as professional  suicide.  He then does what he can to pull the rug out from under her and  her work.  In the meantime, Foster meets McConaughey, a handsome ex-priest  who seeks truth not via science, but through spirituality.
When Foster  recognizes that contact is taking place and she makes that information  public, Skerritt swoops in and attempts to take control of the project.
I  am extremely impressed by this movie's ability to tell a great story of a  possibility, presenting the premis of non-confrontational contact.  This is  no shoot-em up movie.  It does, however, have a healthy dose of special  effects, but those effects are not the heart of the show.
There are  interesting plot developments, instructive insights into the lengths that  some scientists may go to gain recognition among their professional peers,  and the conflict that some scientists face when they realize that there are  more ways to learn about who we are and why we are than via science.
I  encourage you to give this movie a look.  The combination of story, acting,  special effects, and implications of the story make for a great movie!

Sagan's vision,  so eloquently translated by Robert Zemeckis and brought to life by Jodie  Foster and Matthew McConaughey, is a realistic exploration of mankind's  reaction to first contact with extraterrestrial intelligence.  Skepticism,  hope, wonder, fear, distrust, and wide-eyed enthusiasm greet the  ""Message from Vega.""  Zemeckis stays true to Sagan and delivers a  thoughtful character study, a surprisingly even-handed debate on religion  and science, and a commentary on mankind's readiness for entry into the  Galactic milieu.
One of the finest and most scientifically (circa 1990's)  accurate sci-fi dramas of the past 10 years.

96180,5,0790733226,"I first read Carl Sagan's novel ""Contact"" as a teenager and was instantly hooked on the stories premise of intelligent beings sending us a coded message that held within it the blueprints to build a machine. It was a  book I just couldn't put down and one that sticks in my mind as a truly  great story. However I am always skeptical of films made from books, as  they never capture the true essence of the story. This one did not  disappoint though.
Jodie Foster plays Ellie Arroway, a radio astronomer,  desperately seeking signs of extraterrestrial life in the universe. This  sign eventually manifests itself in the form of the above-mentioned  message.  What follows is a thought provoking journey of love, betrayal and  political intrigue as she fights for the machine to be built and for her  place on the maiden voyage. Her performance is full of enthusiasm and  heartfelt emotion.
The DVD is positively brimming with extras including  insights on how certain special effects scenes where created as well as  three (yes THREE! ) audio commentaries from Jodie Foster, the director  Robert Zemeckis and the guys responsible for the special effects. Jodie's  commentary is informative and she puts herself across as a very intelligent  woman. As for picture and sound quality you cannot fault this DVD. The  picture is crisp and flawless while the sound is an audio treat for the  Home Cinema enthusiast. It will put your Dolby Digital amp to the test with  plenty of use of surround sound, especially during the scenes within the  machine. The opening scene with the camera pulling away from Earth will  leave you in awe.
In a nutshell this DVD is worth every penny and one  that I will return to again and again.
One to show your friends just how  good DVD can be.

96181,5,0790733226,"This film was very important for me to watch.  I don't know too much about Carl Sagan but I've listened to enough Art Bell that I am interested in SETI and the pursuit to find out the truth of life outside our  universe.
This movie focuses on several topics such as extra-terrestrial  life and also the battle between science and religion.  I for one am a  person who thinks scientifically but at the same time a God believing  person and for others they can't compare the two, both are at opposite ends  of the spectrum and this movie is really good at showing that.
Also,  the involvement of the US government.  Very interesting.  Also, the movie  uses a lot of major newscasters from CNN and President Bill Clinton.  Also,  very interesting.
This DVD is one of the best intelligent movies and the  whole story including the special effects are wonderful.  The video is nice  and clear and the use of many colors in the film are brilliant.  The sound  on digital 5.1 is also very nice.
As for the DVD extras, I have to give  Warner Bros. an applause for doing this movie justice by including three  feature length commentaries by Jodie Foster, the director and producer  Robert Zeickis and Steve Starkey and another group being Ken Ralston and  Stephen Rosebaum.  Also, it was nice to see the computer animation concepts  and tests, special effects designs and more.  I'm not sure if there were  many deleted or cut scenes but I wish they included them but I can't expect  much, they did a great job and by including three commentaries, that's  really awesome!
I'm sure some people will love or hate this film due to  the science vs. religion overtone but I know what my heart believes and I  can only say that this DVD is highly recommended!",960336000,2,1744,4.568181818181818
96182,5,0790733226,"Another masterpiece by Jodie Foster.  Foster can make the worst movie tolerable--e.g., Nell--or make a good movie into a great one--e.g., Silence of the Lambs.
Here, the movie starts out with a great plot and Foster  does not disappoint.  Foster plays a scientist obsessed by the search for  extra-territorial intelligence, the SETI project, at a time when government  cutbacks are shutting the project down.  Foster portrays the scientist  obsessed by her field but unable to make others understand how important  her interest is very well.  The scene in which Foster first hears an alien  message is particularly powerful and the subsequent search to understand  the alien message is very interesting.  Although I am not a scientist, the  task of decoding the message was easy to follow but, at the same time was  somehow complex and even suspenseful.  The scenes of contact are low key  and, in many ways similar to the analogous scenes in 2001.  I believe this  was intentional given the other similarities of this movie to 2001.  Most  obviously, the search for extraterrestrial life in both movies results in a  story more about the human condition than about our interaction with other  life forms.
A note of further interest:  there is a surprising,  although understated, scene at the end which seems to explain everything  but on further reflection, still leaves almost everything unresolved.
Finally, several reviewers have complained about the Matthew McConaughey  character, the modern man of faith. McConaughey plays a man struggling to  keep science within the bounds of morality, religious or otherwise.  Jodie  Foster's character and he clash since she is not only a scientist who  believes in knowledge without moral limits and does not believe in G-d.  Rather than take sides on this debate, the movie, instead, presents both  sides fairly and then proposes that the two views can co-exist peacefully  without either banishing G-d from our lives or putting irrational limits on  science.
I applaud Hollywood for dealing with this issue, even  superficially, since it is controversial and yields no easy solutions.  The  McConaughey character changes my review from a four star review (very good,  but not special) to a five star review for a rare movie which is both  entertaining and intelligent.",959644800,4,2316,5.173441734417344

This is one of those movies that really makes you think, at  least thats what i got out of it.
Aside from the excellent story, this  movie has some very good special effects. There was one scene in particular  where the machine ends up being destroyed. That was a great job, and in  this dvd there is a featurette showing how that whole scene was composited.  I was amazed at how much work and detail go into a scene like that.

96194,5,0790733226,"The best science-fiction film of 1997 and one of the best of all time. Based on the book by the late Carl Sagan, this film examines the possibility of life on other planets and the means to make ""contact"" with  them. There is however an even more profound question this film ponders. At  the forefront of one of history's oldest battles are the two contenders of  science and religion. The story begins with Eleanor Arroway (Jodie Foster  in one of the greatest female roles I have ever seen on film) as a young  girl. As an extraordinarily brilliant child, she shows the making of a  scientist at an early age. The death of her mother and later her father  (both at a very tender age) only push her to explore the limitless  boundaries of the life/faith dilemma. As the film progresses, the  intermingling of science and religion become more apparent. After Arroway  receives what is believed to be a signal of life in outer space, she is  determined to go into space (at risk of death) to explore the origin of the  alien life. What follows before the flight is a plethora of red tape enough  to frustrate God. The religious community, from liberal to fundamentalist,  is determined to make its voice known to the world by apprehending Arroway  and convincing her that it is a question of faith and not science that life  exists. Enter cynic philosopher and Minister Palmer Joss (Matthew  McConaughey). His close relations to Arroway and his visibility on the  world stage create a fabulous breeding ground for conflict and make the  audience think hard about the dual truths and ambiguities of both religion  and science. In fact, the line between science and faith almost seems to  disappear at times. In the end, we are left to our own conclusions about  what is what, but not without feeling that science and religion have both  been given a fair shake. If you are expecting laserbattles and  intergalactic dictators on mega-spaceships, then Contact will certainly  disappoint you. However, if you are expecting to dive deeply into the  thought process and see a Sci-fi film, which is more on the philosophical  side with, many questions left unanswered (like 2001: A Space Odyssey),  then you are in for a great voyage into the unknown. The best thing about  this film aside from the material it approaches is the handpicked cast.  Aside from Foster, James Woods is remarkable as a starchy-shirt, bureaucrat  who refuses to bend to what he cannot see, Angela Bassett is the  open-minded and contemporary believer in the science community who is more  willing to accept Foster's story than anybody else. John Hurt is the  eccentric billionaire who is Foster's only real ticket to the spaceflight.  On a less powerful note, McConaughey is unable to make his role interesting  or even the least bit appealing. The only thing he can convince us of is  that he cannot deliver such a powerful character as his is supposed to be.",959040000,3,2929,4.786

There are many constraints, primarily budgetary and temporal, to making a film from a book.  By reading it after seeing the  film one is not disappointed by the lacunae left from editing out  ""extraneous"" material in the interest of brevity, and the written  version allows the reader to enlarge on relationships and side plots.  This  instance was no exception.  Although I enjoyed the characters, and  certainly the actors chosen for the parts were perfect for them, I felt  they were a little ""flatter"" than in the book despite being real  people.  I also preferred the resolution of the father-daughter situation  in the book to that in the film.

96198,5,0790733226,"Contact is the most satisfying science fiction movie of the 1990s.  It avoids the pitfalls of being a shoot 'em up like Starship Troopers, or being coldly intellectual like 2001.  It is also one of those rare movies that gives the scientific aspect of the script proper respect, without  being pedantic or sacrificing character development.

For me, what makes  the movie work is the versimilitude with which the story is handled.  Using  CNN reporters, celebrities, and even President Clinton, the story comes off  as very realistic.  Certain details from the book would have made the ending a bit less ambiguous--e.g., the fact that sand was found in the pod seemed to  indicate in the novel that Ellie really did visit another world.  Apparently, the  producers wanted to keep the ending more ambiguous, which is  understandable, since one of the themes of the film is faith.  Ellie's lack  of faith in organized religion ironically comes back to haunt her when she  realizes that for people to believe her journey actually took place, they  must accept her statement--on faith.  (Incidentally, the book makes clear that Ellie is not an Atheist, but rather an open-minded Agnostic.)

This is one of the few films in this genre to have truly first class acting.  Foster does her usual excellent job, as do the supporting players, especially Tom Skeritt.

The visual effects in this film are in a class of their own, and they are placed at the service of the story, in contrast to the Star Wars movies.

This is one of the first DVDs I purchased, and for years it was my demo-disc.  Warner has simply packed it with extras, inclusing three commentary tracks and a French translation.  There are also extra materials explaining how the  visual effects were achieved and how the Machine was designed.  The Blu-ray has the same features.

This is a  DVD everyone should have!

UPDATE, June, 2010:

Contact has since been issued on Blu-ray.  I recommend that over the DVD for several reasons.  In addition to the obvious visual improvements, the old-style snap-case of the DVD was rather unwieldy.  The generous features on the Blu-ray are exactly the same as those on DVD, but the menu is easier to navigate.

Over the years, my opinions on the movie have changed somewhat - although I continue to rate it highly.  Since my original review in 2000, I have visited Puerto Rico twice and the Arecibo Observatory once.  Although the telescope itself is spectacularly presented in the film, the huts that Ellie and her co-workers live in couldn't be farther from a realistic portrayal.  Buildings in Puerto Rico (which is in a hurricane zone) are invariably made of cement.  The same can be said of the ""lechonera"" style restaurant where Ellie meets Palmer.  Arecibo is essentially a suburban town, not some third-world hovel.  In real life, Arecibo (like most of Puerto Rico) has been overrun by American fast-food restaurants.

The use of real-life footage of President Clinton is, in retrospect, a mistake.  It serves only to date the film.  In the novel, the President was an unnamed woman who was only referred to as ""Madame President"".  I feel the film would have been more successful if it had stayed closer to the book - Angela Bassett, who played the Chief of Staff, would have been a good choice as President.",956275200,2,3313,4.849731663685152

96202,4,0790733226,"I remember walking out of ""Contact"" struck by how unusual a film it was for a summer release. Not an action film, not a romance flick, not a comedy, ""Contact"" was a serious exploration of the roles faith  and science play in our daily lives, and it asks a good question of us- how  compassionate are we really? Do we accept the beliefs of others, or do we  stay to our own narrow beliefs? (Appropriately, I saw the movie in our  nation's capitol, just a block or two away from where numerous scenes take  place in the film.)
The short and sweet of the plot is this: Jodie Foster  plays an atheist scientist whose quest to find life on another world is  rewarded with a signal one day carrying instructions on how to construct a  machine capable of transporting a human being. I won't give away too much  else. Suffice to say I was impressed by how the film handled the message  and the response- it was not melodramatic and seems quite plausible. The  viewer gets the feeling that if mankind does ever make contact, this would  be how it was done. The question of whether there is extraterrestrial life  out there is a daunting one- to put it mildly it would be the greatest  discovery in the history of mankind and would fundamentally challenge  virtually all of the assumptions mankind has made about our place in the  universe.
Foster is quite good, but I found Matthew McConaughey's role as  Foster's love interest and a religious thinker to be a little hard to  swallow. He's a talented actor to be sure (he was terrific in ""A Time  to Kill""), but he was miscast here. James Woods and Tom Skerrit don't  impress as the film's two villains, but the story and Foster are strong  enough to carry the movie along despite some weak characters.
Does the  movie demonize religion? For the most part: no. The unfortunate casting  aside, McConaughey's character has an important role to play here in making  it abundantly clear that faith and reason need not conflict and that  mankind can believe in god and still be able to question the world around  ourselves. A good message, but one that the film only half-heartedly  makes.
In terms of technical execution, ""Contact"" has much  going for it. It all looks plausible, like we are watching a documentary  instead of a fiction film. The sequences involving CNN reporters and clips  of President Clinton (re-edited to make it appear like he was commenting on  events in the film) blur the line between fiction and fact.
On the  balance, well done. This is a film that will impress and make people think.  Good work.",953596800,13,2561,4.607538802660754

What  ""Contact"" is: a moderately thoughtful and carefully constructed  essay on possible first contact and problems therein. It's got some cheesy  mechanics in it (love-story, arbitrary ending), but, frankly, you expect  that.

Moreover, it presented a long time period with ingenious  connections, references and, of course, memories which could turn out as a  disadvantage for a film to grasp it all. However, Zemeckis' demiurgical  blend of Sagan's novel with conventional Hollywood approach makes this film  an experience to enjoy. What's so striking is that, the film and the book  almost enrich one another. For example, in order to visualize the Machine  (of course not fully, because it's a bit altered in the film) described in  the book, you have to see the film. On the other hand, if you want to touch  a deeper level of meaning & cross-references (through a magnificent  choice of quotes, flawlessly constructed storyline, and the unique  perspective of the universe & life itself that Sagan makes us witness)  you have to read the book. But beware: if you read the book 1st, then you  may find the film less satisfying. Because, after all, this is a Hollywood  production. It has to address the public taste with a pinch of a love  story, injustice & redemption sequences, and of course a  ""comprehensible"" finale.

It isn't the  aliens that draw you into the story, its the combat between science and  religion, and the realization that both need to fall back on a little thing  called faith.",947548800,6,519,4.741573033707865
96247,4,0790733226,"Bear with me.
A young girl is encouraged by her widower father to explore the world and beyond; soon left orphaned, she turns inward and relentlessly pursues the signs for intelligent life in the universe, only  to be thwarted at every turn by an evil nemesis and yet be assisted by a  mysterious shadowy figure with the power to make his machinations stick.  Add to this a love story between our driven scientist and a fallen yet  equally driven spiritualist and you have all the making of a mass of hokum  that in lesser hands would go downhill faster than a Radio Flyer on Mount  Everest.
However, we are in the hands of Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump,  Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Back To The Future) who masterfully weaves the  framework drafted by Carl Sagan into a marvelous tapestry.
Jodie Foster  is Ellie Arroway, the driven scientist who needs empirical evidence for  anything to exist in her world.  She's part of a SETI (Search for  Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) group about to have their funding pulled by  Dr. David Drumland (Tom Skeritt), who at the film's open is the director of  the National Science Foundation.  Arroway's childhood traumas and  fascinations have fused to turn her into this driven force; she is a woman  with a vision and she is not easily deterred.  Ellie briefly becomes  involved with Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey), a man who nearly became a  priest, but who admits that celebacy was a problem for him, which makes him  no less devout as a messenger for God's word.
What evolves is a story  that explores the relationship between society, science, and religion.  Its  characters, which could easily fall cartoonish in the wrong hands, are  well-drawn and expertly directed by Zemeckis, who had some prior experience  with 'toons and apparently was aware what to watch out for.
Lest you  think my opening was a criticism of Carl Sagan and Ann Dryan's screen  story, it was not.  Sagan and Dryan provided a good story structure for  screenwriters James Hart and Michael Goldenberg to build on.  Zemeckis,  aided by Alan Silvestri's music, keeps it all in tune and doesn't provide  us with pat answers, and yet keeps us interested.
One of the more  endearing qualities of this film is its true-to-life representation of what  would happen in America should what happens to Ellie happens to us.  From  beginning to end, every part of her experience rang true.
So, for a  thoughtful way to spend 2 hours, rent or purchase this film.  You'll enjoy  it.",947289600,2,2488,4.830952380952381

There are special effects galore; a broad, sweeping story concerning outer space and alien contact;  and lots of technology in between.  But at its heart is Jodie Foster.  What  a performance!  I never knew she could be so soulful.  She plays the  resourceful, plucky heroine again, but this time Ms. Foster opens up and  shows us so much more depth.  The scene in which she witnesses the cosmos  and cries, ""They should have sent a poet"" is breathtaking.
Now, the DVD is pretty cool too!  Ms. Foster's commentary channel is a  revelation.  And the step-by-step process of creating the digital effects  is interesting as well.  It is truly amazing what computers have done for  visual effects. I'm not sure I understand how some of the effects were done  even after watching the demo reels on the DVD!

SF - yes - but they make you believe it could happen exactly like this (and who knows - it  might...). One of the most interesting facets of this movie is the fact  that it has something that is rarely seen in Hollywood: a female heroine!  Jodie foster brilliantly portrais a woman who is strong, intelligent,  driven, courageous but also sensitive and emotional. Easily the strongest  female character since Sigourney Weaver in ""Alien"". The DVD is a  showcase in itself: the 5.1 digital sound is clearly the best in over 100  DVDs I've seen, extremely dynamic (if you have a subwoofer: tie it to the  floor for the ""liftoff"" and journey parts of the movie or else it  will bounce all across your living room), there are wonderful directional  effects aplenty, the dialogues are crisp and easy to understand and the  score is a beauty, too. For me the highlight are the full-length  commentaries of Jodie Foster and director Zemeckis. They offer interesting  and often humorous first hand insight into the making of this great movie.  You learn a great deal about filmmaking (much more than through any  ""making-of"" featurette), share toughts, feelings, even doubts of  the people who brought this masterpiece to you and even learn about some  memorable human episodes that happened during the shoot. Last but not least  the image quality is very good, the contrast is high, the tonal balance is  beautiful and the sharpness is way above what VHS could ever offer.

Clinton, and in light of the widespread graphics awareness of the public from the computer generated Mandelbrot Sets to extraterrestrial suggestive Crop Circle and Pictograms viewed on televisions and the internet the world over is nothing other than the most bald faced and inconceivably maladroit screw-up literary portrayal has ever evidenced in film making.
You know, I can not believe how many people have chimed in on this movie!  Get out-a-here!  What's the deal, we collectively feel that this was the one cinematic experience that would quantify all our extraterrestrial hopes and desires, bring on the enlightenment, persevere the salvation and reification, merge technological incubus with spiritual soundness...etc...etc?
Sing a poor song, and someone who speaks a different language than you will think you're a stereotyped religious bigot, then write a review flagging your title by immitation, then rage against their own construction of whom you are.  This movie reviewing cyber environ is all about the eternal battle for accurate emotional and contextual translation.  It would be an interesting statistic to know how many international designations relative to the US review movies here.  We who seldom travel know so little of the world.  Perhaps, it would seem, beyond us, it is a construction, a facade--like the US was in a bubble of Vonnegut dimensions, the Tralfalmadore equivelent of a supra-miserable shell of perception for miserable creatures, (""Slaughterhouse 5"", Kurt Vonnegut.)
  Anyway...I'm partial to filburts, I, like nuts, am permiable and afford a certain neo-brashness akin to merging words and finding out what's in them.  The tragedy of cinematographic revealation is that it so poorly renders the complexity of decoded language from the author's heart and mind.  Movies are far removed extractions and substitutes from the authors intentions or frame of mind...you will fare better by reading the book, if you want any kind of porthole into the psyche of the originator of an authored work, and perhaps a better road map to where they were always nudging you.  Books think, movies are infomercial distillations impoverished of brain food and lingering intellectual problematics that drive the mind.  Movies are fluff, pretty fluff, exciting fluff, but they are as popcorn to the nutritional value of the intellect as the popcorn you eat while watching them.

I fould the movie very thought provoking.  M. Scott Peck, M.D. an author  and Psychiatrist in his book ""The Road Less Traveled &  Beyond"" states that the best way to sell yourself on Christianity (and  Grace) is to have a very questioning attitude toward religion.  When you  decide YES, your faith is built on a solid foundation.  This movie puts  that philosophy to the test.  And for me comes down on the side of God.  The scene on the party balconey where the preacher asks Jodie Foster to  prove that her father loves her was a stunning revalation for me.  She  responded that she just knows, but can't prove it.  I find that to be one  of the strongest statements to support faith in God that I have ever heard.  I have used that ""prove XXXXX loves you"" to support my belief in  God on several occasions since the movie.  How can we PROVE God loves us  (or that he exists) any more than you can PROVE that your husband or  whoever loves you.  The movie was a religious experience for me.  I am  sorry other Christians don't see the value in the movie.  I suppose that  non-believers can support their positions with the movie too.  Maybe that  is the rub?

But I like this movie in spite of its shortcomings. It is a  rare combination of an interesting plot line and great special effects.  Jodie Foster gives a good performance.
But if you're on the fence about  buying this DVD, consider that it has great commentary tracks (by Foster,  Zemekis, et all) and some fascinating behind the scenes explanations of how  the special effects were constructed. One of the best packaged DVDs for the  money.

96274,5,0790733226,"""Contact"" is a fantastic movie intended to ask questions, and has a lot of fun doing it.

Some people seem to miss the point, in that they think they're being provided with answers.  This movie doesn't give  any answers.  It doesn't show ""the alien"", though it shows -a  representation- of an alien, from the main character's memory.  It says so  right in the dialog, but I guess that since ""Contact"" doesn't  come pre-chewed and digested, there are a lot of people who can't  understand it.  This movie is aimed at people who are willing to think.  Others need not apply.

What the movie -does- do is ask questions, and  really interesting questions at that.  An example: any answer to questions  like, ""are we all alone in the universe"" would be bogus, because  we don't know.  Instead, it asks, and shows an example, of how humans might  react to a ""first contact"" situation.  It asks questions relating  to science vs religion.  It speaks to us of ""the world as it is""  rather than ""the world as we'd like it to be"".  The only thing it  adds is ""the message"", whatever that really is.

I've read the book, and found that this movie is one of those rare examples where the movie is better than the book.

The DVD is  fantastic, because not only do you get the awsome movie, but you get all  the commentary which allows you to extract every iota of meaning from it.  I seriously recommend this movie.",935452800,7,1402,4.496

I  know that some people call it a genius ending, but I just don't get it.  I  felt like I was being ripped off.  Robert Zemeckis stole my money, made me  sit through two hours, expecting a smash ending, and... what do I get? A  lame ending.  Who needs that? There are plenty of movies with crappy  endings.

""Contact"" was completely entralling.  A wonderfully orchestrated  concept in addressing some of the most difficult philosophical questions  ever asked.

I will leave you with this; I love movies, in fact  there are only two films which I did not completely enjoy. ""Natural  Born killers"" was the other one. I do hope you will enjoy the show  because I cannot.",910828800,,665,4.681034482758621
96315,5,0790733226,"Sci-fi movies that actually provide you with issues for conversion after  the credits roll are few-and-far-between: Forbidden Planet; The Day the  Earth Stood Still; Colossus: The Forbin Project; 2001; just to name a few.  In this rarefied atmosphere belongs CONTACT.  The story by ""who wouda  thunk it"" Carl Sagon is very good.  Jodie Foster completely redeems  herself with regards to ""Silence of the Lambs.""  The supporting  cast is excellent. Finally, a modern couple who actually discuss deep  topics on the wide-screen instead of just having sex!?!
Query?  Why do  scientist always have to be ""driven"" in every sci-fi movie since  1980.  Can't they simply do what they do out of love for doing it - it must  be a Hollywood script requirement maybe.
The condescending explanation of  what a prime number is could really have been left out.  Even Homer  Simpson, on valium with a Guiness Stout chaser, knows what a prime  is.
Overall, this is one of the best science fiction movies to come  along, not perfect, but one of the best!!
The DVD version is  magnificent!!!  END",903744000,,1076,4.893854748603352
96316,3,0790733226,"The movie was very good. It was entertaining..err for the most part (there were a few dull moments). The characters seemed realistic, though the main character was too goody goody and nice. As for the story, it had somed great parts in it but was on average just good. One thing was that I was expecting a scifi-ish  movie. This was sorta more of a melodrama that  made comments about human nature. The story was somewhat fast near the end but the ending was totally disapointing!! They don't tell you anything what so ever. Don't get me wrong. I don't want everything explained to me..in fact i hate it sometimes, but this was just..lame. Personally, it was a good movie that got undeserved raves.  END",901929600,2,703,4.608
96317,5,0790733226,As someone who has spent their working years designing earth stations like you see in this film I was so impressed that the technical detail was so good. Small technical errors are forgiven in a great film overall. This film played out a scenario I have pondered over many times. Late at night in a earth staions during performance tests I have kicked the antenna off it test axis and looked around at the many carriers out there.... Jodie Foster played that role so well and I enjoyed every moment of a thinking persons film..a rare output from any studio.  END,899856000,,562,4.564356435643564
96318,5,0790733226,"In these days, the mainstream Hollywood movies seem to be using too much special effects and even defending on them without a good story telling. Contact is one of a few movies that combines a good story line and a great special effect (even though I think showing Mr. Clinton was a bit too much). We need more of this kind of movie.

My gosh, what a long movie and what a constant tease and promise of something significant happening... only for nothing much to happen.  Over and over again.  There were some great, profound ideas here but shaving about 20 minutes off of the running time with some better editing would have gone a long way towards getting at it without feeling so bored most of the time.",1524096000,,432,4.512820512820513
