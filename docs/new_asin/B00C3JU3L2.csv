5689776,3,B00C3JU3L2,"OH MY GOD......Sentai what the heck were you guys thinking. You FUBAR'd the English version of Great Piece of work. I waited for a long time to see the next set of stories to a wonderful beginning.....

OK let me back step here Horizon's season 1 English dub was fantastic. I never enjoyed an anime series as much as this one when I first started it(Please go see season 1 in the original or dub version). I bet you will love it as much as I do. The English VA(voice actors) were outstanding. I never felt that much emotion before until I watch season 1. I still go back and watch it. Then when season 2 came out I watched that in the English sub and WOW.....I mean WOW.....I thought I was watching the start of a phenom(I hear the light novels are that entrenched). So had been waiting on pins and needles for the continuation and get poop.

Now the poster before summed up this season in her remarks so I won't repeat the same. Good job

My issue is that Sentai screwed up big time. They changed the voice actors for most of the characters, the VA for the new characters are pitiful(example - the VA for Ben Johnson, one of England's Trumps, sounds like a retarded Jessie Jackson) there is little to no emotion in the English dub(unlike season 1). The timing of the scenes are off in a lot of places. Sentai what the hell what happen(god I hope Funimation gets season 3 if there is one after this debacle)?

I gave this review 3 stars would have gotten 2 however the English sub version is very enjoyable on a large Hidef tv....so that has save this product from being garbage.

If you are a fan of this series IMHO....Watch season 1 in either (dub/sub) and season 2 in the (sub) only.",1373587200,,1687,4.325949367088608
5689777,1,B00C3JU3L2,"this cartoon does not make any sense at all.

the setting is really just a devastated earth, and the only habitable place is (gasp!) Japan.

mix in some Bibilcal references, which I worry many may find disagreeable, women in tight-fitting clothes, and you get this.

Did I mention a lot of fighting and violence?

There is no sense and logic in all this. And definitely no educational value. Yet a second season has been made. A tragedy for kids of America in my view.

This cartoon is definitely banned from my home.",1373328000,,517,4.576086956521739
5689778,5,B00C3JU3L2,"Horizon In The Middle of Nowhere II is the next chapter in the extremely popular series. As someone who really enjoyed the first season, I was jumping with joy when I heard there was a second season airing.

the story is one of the strongest points in this anime. The historical references in this futuristic anime are quite amusing and interesting. Many battles from our real past are reenacted with an outcome that can be seen a mile away but it still manages to wow you by how it's all played out. Many people are turned off by the over the top ecchi and claim this to have no plot but I can assure you it has a great story. Now that I mentioned the ecchi, I should warn you that there is quite a bit of it. The supporting cast got a lot more screen time this go around and most episodes Tori had little to no interaction with anyone else. This really did develop the rest of the cast well and I believe strengthened the anime. Expect to see a lot of abnormally large bouncing boobs every few seconds. To me it is glorious but some can be easily turned off by that. The comedy is another strong point, Everyone would agree that the Battles are the strength and livelihood of Horizon.

Great care and detail is put into crafting every scene perfectly. Laugh worthy comedy, magnificently choreographed conflicts, beautifully integrated music, and compelling characters are thrown into a vast and detailed world to pursue their own goals. I enjoyed every second of it. Hoping season 3 will be announced soon and with 24 episodes, praying when that day comes",1368576000,9,1557,4.5177304964539005
5689789,5,B00C3JU3L2,Same high quality production as season 1. Fun series that seems to only be scratching the surface of the story. Too bad it doesn't look like they're going to continue production past this season.,1424822400,,195,4.764705882352941

5689795,5,B00C3JU3L2,"This second season turned what I called a good series into a great one. The battles are a great deal of fun to watch, but the characters are even better for comedy. The only problem this series suffers from is the fact that it tries to carry a ridiculously complex plot and background from a series of huge books (light novels, my ass.)
So it does unfortunately suffer from some distillation, nonetheless, it is a great series running on a insane premise that is surprisingly intricate. Just don't feel too bad if you don't understand what's going on in the first watch.",1375833600,5,570,4.598039215686274

5689797,4,B00C3JU3L2,"change over episodes from season one to season two were disappointments, for the rest they were good, only thing I found that took away from good show that should have din grate, was the one character ends up spending the season with nothing on, it should not have bin done.

8577047,4,B00C3JU3L2,"I found this part funnier then the first one. why, well Tori spends most of season two being naked and getting punched, kicked, or shot at. the shot at was for trying on all the girls cloths. Horizon sleeps a lot and makes a hide in her back for the pieces of the armor. it comes in handy in the thrown room scene when calaripcy falls out of the hide and they try to tell Queen Elizabeth that is a body pillow. Tenzo the ninja even falls in love. with Queen Mary, the older twin sister to Queen Elizabeth.",1509667200,,505,4.111111111111111
