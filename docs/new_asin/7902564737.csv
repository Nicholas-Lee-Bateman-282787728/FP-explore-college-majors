7900654,4,7902564737,"This is a very low impact aerobic video. Enough to get you to sweat and the heart rate up a bit, but it is not a hard work out.  For me it is perfect.......I have Fibromyalgia, so anyone with limitations or beginners, or elderly, or someone who's Dr. has prescribed low impact.....this is perfect.  The previous writer did speak truth in that they do not show the instructor enough.  After doing this video 4 times you should not need it.  However, to begin with....YOU NEED to see the instructor at all times.  The participants are not doing the moves right for the most part, and they have some ""comedy"" relief that STOPS the work out for at least 5 minutes! Big NO NO when doing aerobics....you NEED to keep moving.  The cool down stresses the muscles too much when you should be just cooling down.  However, I have fibro muscles so don't go by me on that one. So, other than those few things......it is a wonderful exercise video.  Exercising and praising God at the same time, good way to start any day!",1151884800,,1008,4.469945355191257
