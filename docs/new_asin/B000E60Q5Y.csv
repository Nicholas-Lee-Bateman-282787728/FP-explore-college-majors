8106316,5,B000E60Q5Y,"I'm a heterosexual woman, with husband and 3 kids, and 8 grandchildren.  And now, one great chandchild!!
That said, I can't tell you how profoundly moved and heartened I was to have come across this 2005 program on The Turtle Creek Chorale on my PBS station this evening.
I have watched many times, and weep every time, the 1992 documentary ""After Goodbye"".  Seeing this 2005 production made me SOOO happy to know that they have lived through that awful period to grow stronger through their grief to bring a message of love, acceptance, challenge and inclusion along with their beautiful music.
So I have just purchased this DVD to be able to know that smiles do come after tears and these beautiful people can still sing their profound message.
Thanks, Turtle Creek Chorale!! (And Ginny Martin, who made such a seamless film!)",1245628800,,828,4.823943661971831
8106317,5,B000E60Q5Y,"The Power Of Harmony is an honest, poingant ""documentary"" about the lives of individual men who are in the Turtle Creek Chorale. Among the stories that is told is the heartwarming story of a gay couple's journey to adopt a baby from another country and bring him home. Another is the heart wrenching story of a man who was rejected by his family years earlier. He decides to call his parents to wish them a Happy Anniversary. Then, asks them if he can come visit them after all these years.
In all stories, the men find friendship, help, condolence, and support from their fellow Chorale members.
Despite everything, they are able to have fun and make the audience laugh as they perform on stage together.",1222473600,,705,4.648

8106320,5,B000E60Q5Y,"I was channel surfing and came upon a channel with a male choir. The voices were beautiful...as I watched, I was blown away to realize that all the men were Gay. The stories of many of these men was being told over the singing. It was very enlightening to listen to each of their ""life experiences"" as a gay person. It was such an amazing and mind opening insight into the singers personal lives. I thought I had an open mind but this show opened my mind and heart even wider. I would recommend this for people of every age and gender.  I will show it to all my family and friends.

8106321,5,B000E60Q5Y,"Ginny Martin, the director of The Power of Harmony, is simply a genius. She has taken a variety of stories and weaved them together in a brilliant symphony of inspiration. This is likely to be another award-winning work by this talented documentarian.

Using the backdrop of The Turtle Creek Chorale, Martin has created an extremely entertaining and enlightening message. Using a mosaic of stories and music, the audience is challenged to look at this men's chorus as a metaphor for the journey that we all travel. The film looks at religion, parenting, family, acceptance and community through the eyes of the Chorale's members.

The Power of Harmony is a powerful piece of inspiration.",1149465600,12,687,5.070796460176991
