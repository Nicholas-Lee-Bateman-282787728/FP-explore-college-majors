8558628,2,B00AWXI700,"I'm not sure what was worst, the acting or the way the DVD was filmed. I love classic vaudeville routines, but this was not it.",1426982400,,127,4.12
8558629,5,B00AWXI700,Good mixture of the original clips from the guys and gals who did the original routines to  re-enactments of the most popular vaudeville skits with a touch of today's contemporary social aspects by present day actors and actresses. Everything is kept in black and white to keep the feel of those golden days of television. Acting and production values overall is good and the material is funny. Worth the price keeping in mind it is done by a local independent production company.,1358121600,,480,4.853658536585366
