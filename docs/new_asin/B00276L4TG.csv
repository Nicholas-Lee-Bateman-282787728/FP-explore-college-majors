3862202,4,B00276L4TG,"I won't give a synopsis since the external reviews at the IMDb website provide that (see [...]).  There is a line in the movie where the Conserver says ""You will need a while to understand"".  I couldn't agree more.  After watching this movie and looking for clues within the movie, I still can't tell you what the meaning of the ending is.

The movie is slow paced about young woman named Iris (Olga Kurylenko) who appears to be romance-starved.  After losing her job because of an injury, she finds a room at a hotel which she is told she must share with someone who works nights.  She asks ""With a man?"".  In another scene she is helped into a ferry by a man with whom she silently flirts as they travel.  After the ferry docks, she follows him into a park but loses track of him.  Now as a ""lost babe in the woods"" and at a crossroad, she hears a ""magic"" flute played by a young boy that entices her to an old boarding house.  There she accepts a job with another man who intrigues her.  What does he do?  He claims his role is to solve personal problems of people that come to him.  His work consists of preserving objects for people who really need it and can find the place blindfolded.  Later in the movie he says that the objects are not for nostalgic remembering, but for separation and closure.  She accepts the job and leaves for the day.

Shortly afterwards, she is seen unwrapping her injured ring finger and looking at it.  In the evening, she walks in the red light district and gazes at the ladies for sale in the storefronts.  What is she thinking?

In the morning, Iris's first phone call is from a client looking for the previous receptionist in order to ask her to dinner.  Iris tells the man that the girl doesn't work here any more and that he shouldn't call again.  The Conserver listens and tells her she does that very well.

The next morning she gets up and touches her roommate's clothes.  Later he is seen touching and smelling her clothes.  One evening when she comes back to the hotel, she observes him as he leaves the key with the clerk.  The two have a mild longing for each other throughout the movie.  Near the end he whispers something in French, but no subtitle is provided.

One day a woman comes in to preserve the sound of a score given to her by a former boyfriend.  The Conserver has it played to a small audience.  The melody is a haunting piano melody by Steve Nieve called Window#1 from his Windows CD.

Another day, the Conserver gives Iris a pair of shoes which she accepts.  He asks her to wear them all the time.  She silently agrees.  Do the shoes give him a possessive power over her?  Do they make her willing to remove her clothes for him?  In one scene she asks about her old shoes, he curiously backs away from her.

The boarding house, now laboratory, has two female guests left behind, a pianist and a telefonist.  There is also a young boy who mysteriously plays in the house.  There is an old photograph of the former residents, twenty girls and a man in a lab coat.  The man in the photo looks similar to the Conserver.  When Iris puzzling looks at that photo, there is an exchange of smiles between the Conserver and the old telefonist.

The movie has a haunting sound track by Beth Gibbons, a sensual tension between a sweaty Iris and the men she encounters.  The movie is worth watching and the expressive facial beauty of Iris helps.  But if you don't like movies that leave you wondering, find something else.  Who is the young boy?  Who is the young girl in the preserved photo who is wearing similar shoes?  Why does the old telefonist tell her that the previous receptionist ""disappeared""?  What is the meaning of the spilled Mah-Jong set, a set which represents the philosophy of the universe?  Where does Iris go in the end?",1260489600,22,3794,4.406926406926407
3862203,2,B00276L4TG,"The cinematography and the lead actress are beautiful but the movie itself, not so much.  This movie meanders at an awkward and slow pace.  I had to force myself to stay awake in spots, which is never a good sign.  It is a French film about an enigmatic young woman who finds work for a mysterious man who runs an odd laboratory.  This movie is a little too mysterious for its own good; or maybe, the lesson is that Asian works never translate well and are best experienced in their original form (the film is based on a Japanese story).

After cutting the tip of her ring finger off as a factory worker, a starving young woman is forced to look for work elsewhere.  While following a young man down a path, she runs across a huge building with a help wanted sign for laboratory work.  The doctor hires her on the spot to run his business of preserving whatever his clients wish.  He explains that they bring things to be preserved and then stored by him in order to obtain closure.  This was the best part of the movie and an interesting theme.

The scene where the woman wants to preserve the music written for her birthday by an ex-boyfriend was poignant.  There were several intriguing scenes but most just raised questions and that irritated me.  Why would a woman who didn't eat for at least two days follow a good looking man instead of looking for work?  I would think she had more pressing issues to attend before flirting.  What about the relationship with the sailor who she shared a room with but on different time schedules?  I could go on but I will not.

This movie moved really, REALLY slow in spots and left too many unanswered questions for me to recommend it. If the movie had dealt strictly with the reason behind the title it would have been a much better film.",1259452800,5,1782,4.420245398773006

Her breakthrough role was probably in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quantum-of-Solace/dp/B009A87Z6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quantum of Solace</a>&nbsp;(2008), but Kurylenko made her film debut in the French production, The Ring Finger (aka L'Annularie (2005)), an obscure tale, with few real world references.

Kurylenko's performance is impressive and very convincing, as she plays Iris, a 21 year old, who injured her ring finger while working in a factory.  Wandering in an unnamed seaside town, she finds lodging, and then gets a job, working at a strange laboratory, which processes and stores ""specimens"", brought in by clients.  The doctor that heads the operation (Marc Barbe) is a little odd, and taking an interest in Iris, he gives her a pair of beautiful red shoes, which fit her perfectly.  Soon, Iris is involved in a sexual relationship with her employer, who is kind of creepy, and has some other strange quirks.  Iris becomes intrigued with the laboratory, that only the doctor is allowed to enter, and after receiving some information and advice, she makes an abrupt decision.

Fluent in French, Olga Kurylenko seems very smooth and natural, when compared to some of her English speaking roles.  She has a wonderful innocence, even when featured often in the shower or in some tasteful sex scenes.  The Ring Finger is interesting and atmospheric, featuring some provocative concepts, unusual characters, and weird elements, with hints that something dark may be involved.  Deliberately leaving many questions unanswered, the film focuses on Iris's journey, and the choices she makes.  The open-ended story will not satisfy everyone, but the strong acting performances are still quite enjoyable.  If you are a Prime member, the film is certainly worth a look, while it is available for free.  Rating: 3.5 stars.",1377388800,4,2274,6.273311897106109

3862255,2,B00276L4TG,"This is the type of movie that is made for the viewer to interpret it's meaning and to draw your own conclusions as to what it was saying. It also wants you to figure out what the cast members were thinking, feeling, sensing and so on. I don't always do so well trying to figure out what the writer, director and the cast are trying to tell us. There is just to many people trying to say something a little different or more than the other and all you wind up with is noise. This also reminds me of an abstract painting where there is no right or wrong interpretation because it's all in the eyes of the beholder.

I think that my interpretation of this movie falls somewhere between nse160 and p.korduba's reviews. I found this movie/story to be very long and drawn out and was short on substance, but filled with one question after another after another.

I thought the young lady (Kurylenko) was sad, lonely, directionless and frightened after loosing the tip of her RING FINGER. The fork in the road was symbolic to see which path will she choose and what lies at it's end for her and her future. The movie is listed as a drama, but it seemed much more like a mystery to me in so many ways. Ha ha!

The whole job interview and job was creepy with the odd (to say the least) boss (Barb'e) and the bizarre requests made by some of their clients. Iris is more than a little uncomfortable around her boss and his sneaking around her not to mention his advances and shoe/foot fetish. She winds up sleeping with him anyway, but she has this fixation/fantasy on her sailor roommate that she only has a few passing glances at?

She is pretty and flirty with a few of the males she encounters during her travels to and from work so why the need for the affair with her creepy and unsettling boss?

The building that Iris works in seems to have ghosts and the women that still reside there worked  there as well. During a visit with one of the residents Iris is shown the group photo that shows all of them plus what appears to be Iris's boss? So here we have yet another mystery, has her boss been preserved and by some magical/evil means stayed the same age all those years?  During that visit the woman makes some gestures when Iris and her boss were all talking together that hints at something was going on. Then during another conversation with only Iris and the woman the woman remarks about the disapperances of the previous girls in her position and was given a warning more or less about her future? Iris's boss is talking about the history of the large bath/shower/pool room when he talks of when the girls would all shower together as if he was there to bear witness and participated in the activities. The building itself is weird and had no marking to identify it, find it and yet people were somehow drawn to the building to have their possessions preserved?

Then there was the shoe shine/client man that warns Iris about the hold the shoes have on her and for her to take them off because they were becoming a part of her a would never let her go? Was he talking about her boss and his hold on her or by giving Iris the shoes that her boss would have a hold on her?

We were also exposed to Iris checking out the red light district and giving the blond girl behind the window a long stare? Was she thinking about being with the blond girl or was she just saying that she was window shopping or in need of some??? Was the shoes making her think and feel that way?

It appears that everyone who was drawn to the building was going there after some type of tragic event including Iris to have something preserved as she winds up doing after another young lady has her facial burn preserved and is not seen again???? Iris is never allowed into the lab, but the burn victim was and it really peaks her intrest in whats going on down there and what has happened to the burn victim??

I won't tell you the ending if you make it that far, but I will tell you that the acting is very good and the direction for what it is is good as well. The majority of the movie is shot at either Iris's office or at her hotel locations so please do not to get your hopes up on seeing much of Paris's landscape.

I got some parts of this movie and not others for example I knew that Iris was lonely and sad and directionless with her career? and love life and that she was shaken up from her accident at the lemonade bottling plant. The parts of the story that were intentionally obscured included her new job , the building and it's occupants and at times the bizarre clientele requests for preserving weird items and her and her bosses relationship. This story is short on answers and long on questions and is what takes so much from this well acted story. As I mentioned earlier there is no right or wrong answer to what this story was about. Its what you were able to extract from it and only if you are able to intertpret it at least in part? Its not a total loss, but please beware it moves very slowly with very little payoff because of the way its written and directed. Unless this is your type of movie I'd look elsewhere for a French movie. I hope if you made it through my long winded rant that this will give you a good idea of what this movie is like. 2 stars.

3862272,3,B00276L4TG,"I like artsy, weird movies, but this was a little too ambiguous for me.  I have no idea what the film was really about, what happened at the end, and even if I like it or dislike it.  As others have said, it was indeed very ""French.""

The story itself is hard to describe, but I'll try.  The main character injures her finger in a factory accident, so she tries to find a new job.  She happens upon a huge house, gets a job as a receptionist with an older man that preserves very strange things, and that is about it.  I won't get into the shoes or the young guy she never really sees that is sharing her room, but I will say the two sex scenes in the movie were incredibly awkward, strange, and difficult-to-watch.  Olga is so pretty, and I felt sorry for her when she had to have an old man's squishy paunch rubbed all over her.  If you think that sounds gross, imagine having to watch it.

Anyway, as for the interpretation...  SPOILERS BELOW:

I tried to look up what it meant, and everybody seems to be pretty much as clueless as the next person.  However, I'm going to go with the ""it's all a dream"" theory because of the classic fairy tale elements--lost in the woods, follows haunting music, magical shoes--and the oddness of it all--people disappearing, preserving scars and music, and especially how the characters relate to one another.  It was like everybody was kind of in a trance, and real people don't socialize like that.  For example, you don't let your boss buy you shoes and rub your feet while he puts them on.  There was lots of staring, sudden (almost in defiance of physics) appearances, and everybody just seemed dazed.  When you are dreaming and everything is weird, you don't think anything of it because there is no logic in dreams.  However, when you wake up, you realize the way you talked to people and other elements of the dream were just weird and made no sense.

I think it's important to note that we, as the viewers, know absolutely nothing about the main character's life before she sustained her injury, so I think all of the weird things that went on after she fell asleep at the hospital are all a dream and a way for her to work out her issues, which we don't know anything about it.  I thought it was interesting and possibly significant that the young girl with the burn scar looked like a younger Olga.  Maybe she had formerly had a relationship with an older man, and the randomness of the objects brought in to be preserved were probably random things from her memories.  I think the ending was her waking up to reality and self-realization.

SPOILERS OVER

If you like artsy, vague films that do not really have any discernible meaning, then this is for you!  This is definitely one of the strangest films I have ever seen.  Also, I'd recommend La Fille sur la Pont (The Girl on the Bridge) if you like odd, French films.",1356825600,3,2869,4.4397705544933075

3862274,3,B00276L4TG,"I was looking for something a little different and the picture of Olga on the box intrigued me.

This movie is worth seeing for Olga. And you do see her. I should have taken note of the times where you can really see her, but I didn't do that.

But it is also a VERY slow movie. Not much happens. I'm not a big interpreter of films. I'm happy for what they say and if they happen to also possibly mean something else to somebody, that's great, so I can't add to some of the opinions as to the meaning of this film. But even if I did have some idea of what I thought some things meant I wouldn't want to do that for the sake of spoiling it for others.

I read what one of the other reviewers said (the one with a number in his name) and if you don't mind spoilers he had some good ideas.

I'll give this a 3. All for Olga.",1354147200,,821,3.869047619047619

3862276,3,B00276L4TG,"OK, yet another strange French film that implies supposedly deep concepts to the viewer, who unless they are truly savvy, just don't get the point.
  This clearly defines the movie `Ring Finger'.  A strange couple of days in the life of a poor little french girl who we follow through misadventures and fantasies for a few days.
  Kind of like David Lynch lite, if you know what I mean.  It is clearly a movie that is supposed to make the viewers sit back and say.. ""This is what I think that was all about...""
  Sadly though, I didn't see any reviews that attempted that.  So, for what it's worth.. here is my interpretation of what this movie is about.

  SPOILER ALERT's - and my stab at explaining this movie.

1.  Meet Iris (Olga Kurylenko), bored little French girl who hurts finger in boring factory job, goes to nurse and promptly passes out on couch.....
2.  Here is the catch... she drifts off to sleep.... And like with Mulholland Drive (David Lynch) .. she has a DREAM!!!
3. Weird dreams, sexual liaisons where her strange controlling new boss, takes advantage in saucy ways.
4. Strange boss gives her shoes, red pumps that she must where at all times.  Red pumps symbolizing her visits to this fantasy dream place.
5. Strange customer, warns her shoes are a trap, her feet will get lost.. as in, she will get lost in her fantasy dreams and won't be able to come back.
6. OK, you think I'm wrong?
  a. ... notice Iris is falling asleep and waking up a lot in this movie?
  b. She got the strange sexy shoes after her stroll past the prostitutes on display... lusting after excitment.
  c. Boring life, boring clothes.... in small hotel room, Fancy clothes in strange dream job...
  d. Terrified little girl who can't talk to her own mysterious roommate, as opposed to saucy vixen, who regularly plans sexual dalliances with her strange mysterious boss.

  OK, time to wrap it up...  the laboratory is her own memories, all kept in little bottles (just like her dull factory job.. duh) and she finally gets told one final time by strange man that her red shoes (fantasies) are a trap... she needs to get out.
  So...  she ditches her red shoes at the final scene... and hopefully goes and says Hello to her real life.

 There you have it.  My interpretation of this strange little movie. Olga is lovely, the film is well made.
 Not totally terrible when you think about it.
  Just basically, very , very ... French.",1342396800,77,2426,4.545243619489559
3862277,2,B00276L4TG,"If you are into subtleties and rare tantalization, this is for you. This is especially so if the central actress 'can do no wrong'. Unfortunately, in my case, the movie was a mystery. The story's purpose was unclear and the vague suggestions of sensuality were, let's just say, vague. Would I watch it again? I doubt it.",1285027200,,320,4.631578947368421
3862278,4,B00276L4TG,"Very pleasant to see Olga starring and carrying this film with her sometimes deadpan expressions and physical movement and beauty. The Conserver was really creepy and disgusting, discernible almost from the get-go. I did not see any hint of horror, other than wondering what might show up in the specimen collection and what future things might be considered for the collection. It is the story of a young woman trying to keep working, and finding herself in a very strange work environment. The relationship of her with her male shipyard roommate, with major degrees of separation, was very intriguing and kept the viewer wondering how it would play out. The relationship of her with her employer was rather predictable, sometimes shocking, and rather annoying. I agree with the previous reviews: the ending was a non-committal finish that left you wondering where things went afterwards. Although it was easy to suggest the most obvious progression, nobody will really know for certain what happened. There were holes in the plot line. But you will like and appreciate Olga's acting and presence considerably better after seeing this, following having seen her in Quantum of Solace.",1279497600,9,1184,5.171875
3862279,3,B00276L4TG,"***Warning Spoilers*** What can I say but that this film was a horror/soft core porn in the guise of an art film without the horror. This film seemed to have promise but about 3/4 of the way through seemed evident it was going nowhere. It would have been sad if it wasn't so funny. I spent the whole film watching, expecting some profound ending, only to get this silly oow oow oow music like it was suppose to be scary. I think the writers at one point were taking themselves seriously till they realized they were going nowhere and decided they might as well have a good laugh.

The total surprising thing is the ring finger she lost was never shown and never became a specimen. In fact everything about the lead was eventually a specimen but the actual finger itself.

This movie really could have gone somewhere but the vacuous lead really was more or less a dumb bunny, fitting for a campy horror theme but not an art film hoping to convey profundity.",1264982400,,956,4.457142857142857

8354203,2,B00276L4TG,"Convoluted story about a strange young girl who gets involved with a much older ""scientist."" in an old haunted house looking laboratory. Nothing makes any sense in the film. The scientist uses the girl sexually but there's not enough nakedness to make watching worthwhile. It's another forgettable chapter in French cinema. Let's face it. In 1972 with Coppola and Scorcese the film business moved to America. Obscure and dense boring and improbable stories just don't entertain moviegoers anymore whether they are in Paris or New York.
