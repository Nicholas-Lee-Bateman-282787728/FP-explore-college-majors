Bollywood is only one element of it. 2005 saw the release of SACHEIN, a Tamil romantic comedy. And since your eyebrow's raised, let me say this: Tamil cinema, featuring the Tamil language, is based out of Chennai, India. In 2009 SACHEIN was dubbed in Hindi and given a new working title, GHAMANDEE, thus availing itself to Bollywood viewers.

College student Shalini (Genelia D'Souza) is pretty as a Shimla apple, vibrant as a Diwali festival. Maybe her only flaw is that she exhibits atrocious skills on the basketball court. You can't blame a besotted Sachein (Vijay) for declaring his love for her, never mind that it takes him half the film to finally confess it so. But hold up. Shalini doesn't believe in impetuous romance. She posits that it takes time and time and time for a couple to know each other. Sachein, who is cool like the other side of the pillow, vows that in one month - the remaining span of this university season - she'll fall in love with him. A skeptical Shalini scoffs. But maybe she's underestimated Sachein's unflappable cool and big heart and knack for mastering any thuggish adversary in a kung fu brawl, never mind that the hero of any Tamil movie seems able to defy gravity and exercise the laws of bullet time physics. (THE MATRIX has much to answer for.)

In Indian cinema, Bollywood rolls out the slickest products. The Tamil film industry (or ""Kollywood"") tends to muster more modest production values; it has a more provincial feel. There's a palpable rawness, the cultural divide that much more palpable for western viewers. Westerners must be in the proper frame of mind to enjoy this film. SACHEIN has an exuberance about it, but also a wandering, leisurely pace, as well as a broad, obvious kind of goofiness that may turn off them sophisticates who crave a more subtle brand of levity. I do wonder how much gets lost in translation. The dialogue at times is couched in such an oblique or clunky turn of phrase. How accurate are the sub-titles in conveying the breadth and nuance of a culture half a world away?

Still, the familiar plot elements require no sussing out. There's even that last minute dash to the airport, a plot device so old hat even the Wright Brothers are embarassed. Bollywood actress Bipasha Basu makes her Tamil cinema debut, but she's only in to stir up a fleeting and very contrived romantic triangle, and then she's ghost. Genelia D'Souza once again channels her bubbly side and lights up the screen, even though I hesitate to call this her best performance. She's exuberant enough that Disney princesses are taking notes. A nice touch in the Hindi dubbing is a recurring nod towards her marvelous 2008 film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jaane-Tu-Ya-Jaane-Na-2-DVD-Set-Bollywood-Movie-Indian-Cinema-Hindi-Film/dp/B001IDMLPK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na (2 DVD Set) (Bollywood Movie / Indian Cinema / Hindi Film)</a>&nbsp;as this and that character end up briefly serenading her with lyrics from that film's hit track ""Kabhi Kabhi Aditi."" Toiling under the clunkiness of the screenplay, Vijay IS charismatic enough. He doesn't flaunt that conventional handsome hero look, but he flashes a charming smile, and everyone tends to be more favorable when you ooze confidence, and Vijay specializes in that. Check out his breaking the fourth wall as he looks us in the eye and states: ""There is some manufacturing defect. Keep watching. She will soon start loving me."" And this just after his crush had just ignominiously shot him down. So the two leads are the main reason to see this film. It's certainly not their fellow college students who look like they're on the mean side of 30.",1364601600,,3876,5.081632653061225
