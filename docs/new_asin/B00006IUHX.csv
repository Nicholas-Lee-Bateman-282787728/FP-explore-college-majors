8174405,4,B00006IUHX,"Presenters have good credibility.  It's like hearing from a good friend with experience, not talking to the doctor.  Film quality is good also.  The focus is on intimacy from different points of view.  It's very tasteful, but shots get out of sequence, so don't try to follow along while watching.  For couples who truly want to increase intimacy it's very helpful and worth watching.  It would have been nice to see people from different ethnic backgrounds, but overall worth watching.",1106870400,2,486,5.0125

He is also an excellent editor but I think he was kind of driven away by this project. It didn't have to do with the content of the program. It had to do with the computer he had to build the program on. It was a piece of crap. A really big one. It was something like this: edit, save, crash, restart, open project, edit save, edit save, edit, crash, on and on and on. One funny thing he would do since he was kind of clean cut was instead of swearing when he was frustrated, he would say the first letter of the word. It would be relatively quiet and then F!...F! S! You were left to guess what the letter stood for. Why didn't we get it fixed, you ask. That's interesting because we were sharing office space with a computer technition and we were paying him on a monthly basis to keep our computers up and running properly. I really want to give the name of his company but what would that do. That would just be ugly and mean so I won't trash on Mike O. That's not his company name, that's his personal name with the rest of his name omitted. Besides, what happens next never would have happened had Mike been doing his job. Scott often worked evenings as someone else needed the computer during the day. Well after several weeks of Scott dealing with the inoperative computer we come in to the office in the morning to find his script lying on the desk, Intimacy to Ectacy with Ectacy scratched off and Insanity in its place. Yeah, Scott's a real funny guy! So, yes, he quit editing and now he is a photographer in Michigan, burr! Some people are a glutton for punishment!
Well, everyone enjoy the program and Scott might feel a little warmer inside.

8174408,1,B00006IUHX,"The leading title of Kama Sutra is misleading, in no way does this DVD teach any kama sutra techniques. This dvd is more geared towards couples or indiviuals with little or no sexual clue. It's basic premise is to teach us that being an unselfish lover will enhance your sex life, anyone seeking to learn the ancient art of the kama sutra would know this already... skip this selction even if you're from another planet...",1045526400,10,422,4.64
