5790886,4,B00DCRE50O,"Nothing particularly innovative in this movie, but it is a tale well told. Solid performances and production values.  Atmosphere and plot remind me of something Hitchcock or Serling would have done in their TV series last century.

Think extreme male bonding, with echoes of An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge.  A suspense narrative quite effective.",1381104000,,348,5.290909090909091
5790887,4,B00DCRE50O,I am giving this movie 4 stars because it made you think and kind of jarred the emotions a bit.  I thought the acting was good. The plot... hmmmm... hmmm... still thinking about it.  My guest and I enjoyed this so 4 stars.,1380412800,,222,4.1395348837209305
5790888,4,B00DCRE50O,"Old friends Mitchell (Josh Duhamel) and Carter (Dan Fogler) take a ride cross country, or at least the desert. Carter is a ""fat unemployed writer"" while Mitchell is successful in finance with a wife and children. Carter pretends his vehicle is disabled (it's a Ford) so they can talk and get re-acquainted. The conversation turns nasty, and worse so when the Mitchell discovers the break down was staged...but then as fate would have it, the truck really breaks down.

Yes, it is a film about two guys in the desert talking about their lives going from exchanging blows to a bromance and back again and so on. There are some dark comedy moments. I wish Zach Galifianakis had played Carter, but then I always say that whenever a fat bearded role appears.

The film had an awkward ""Twilight Zone"" twist at the end which lacked decent development. Makes for a decent rental.

5790889,4,B00DCRE50O,"Two old friends whose lives have taken dramatically different courses find themselves stranded together out in the desert.

I rented SCENIC ROUTE mainly b/c of its high ratings on Amazon, and spent most of the first two-thirds wondering ""Why?"" as well as ""Where?"" all the rave reviews were coming from. Nevertheless, I'm VERY glad I stuck it out until the end. SCENIC ROUTE truly earns its last 15-20 minutes. The film realistically and unpretentiously raises questions about the big picture of life, the nature of reality, and many other things. Missed opportunities (by both protagonists and everyone else) and the chance to find them again is another central theme here. Really fine acting by both major players, but most particularly by Dan Fogler.

At the same time, SCENIC ROUTE is a slow-moving low-budget film with only two major characters and few significant changes in scenery. Therefore, it's easy to understand why it will probably NOT appeal to fans of conventional drama with layered structures, fast action and suspense, panoramic settings, multiple characters, etc. There are indeed some surprises in the latter portions of the film, as well as excellent dialogue throughout, but SCENIC ROUTE is driven far more by its various themes and character-situations than it is by plot or tension.",1380326400,,1306,5.184834123222749

5790893,4,B00DCRE50O,"""You stage a breakdown in the middle of the desert so we can talk?!"" Mitchell (Duhamel) and Carter (Fogler) are best friends we have started to drift apart when they decide to go for a ride. When the truck they are in breaks down in the middle of a desert they start to argue about the directions their lives have taken. The argument starts to escalate and their friendship is pushed to its limits. Before I start I have to admit that the plot doesn't seem exciting or interesting at all but this is a perfect example of you can't judge a book by it's cover. While the plot isn't all that intriguing the acting is so brilliant that it gives the movie a tenseness and excitement that the idea alone can not. You really begin to feel for the friends and are so invested in them that you find yourself living and dying with them with every passing minute. It's to talk to much about the events without giving something away because each event builds on the one before it but I will say that this was a pleasant surprise and I highly recommend this. Overall, one of the best ""under the radar"" movies I have seen in a long time and another movie that won't get the audience that it deserves. I give it an A-.",1376524800,6,1203,4.280701754385965
5790894,4,B00DCRE50O,"This film begins innocently enough then gradually goes from bad to awful for the characters.  This is a low-budget film, but since the money was spent almost exclusively at one location, the producers could make that single scene very hellish.  This is a psychological drama, where the focus is on the dialogue and character development, although there is some violence.  The movie keeps you interested throughout, and the conclusion feels about right.",1376006400,4,452,5.25
5790895,5,B00DCRE50O,"I enjoyed this movie. I hope it's a big commercial success because people need the message that it conveys, it seems to me. It's about friendship, anger (even murderous anger), betrayal, and survival. That's a lot for a cast of two to handle; the few others in the film played no significant role.

Two men, about thirty years old, find themselves stranded along an isolated stretch of desert road.  One of the men, Carter (Dan Fogler) decided to take this remote route as a way to spend some time with his long-time buddy, Mitchell (Josh Duhamel). Their friendship goes back many years, but in recent times the two have grown distant.

Carter's old pickup truck dies on them. It dies in the wrong place: the nearest town appears to be sixty miles away.  Lesson: stay on the main drag if you're driving through an area that looks like the surface of the moon.

It's very hot by day and bitter cold by night. They run out of water. It becomes an ordeal. And the two men begin to bicker, snapping at each other over unpleasant memories they share. They mock each other and blame each other. The conflict soon escalates, and, as we see in the opening shots, blood is spilled.

I can't say much more without spoiling it. Both actors turned in bravura performances. It was all very convincing.

I did find the ending somewhat strange, and wish the producers had kept what first appeared to be the conclusion. But I'll still give it a five. The powerful acting earned those stars.",1375833600,4,1474,4.581749049429658

5790907,5,B00DCRE50O,"I loved it.

My only complaint would be that some of the survival tactics, or lack thereof, were a little odd.  I don't understand why they didn't block off the road with a wall of rocks, or attempt other things to indicate they were there and in trouble.

But aside from that minor nitpicking, I liked it a lot.

UPDATED:  I watched it again and still love it!  Really great movie.  Perfect balance of many things like humor, terror, etc... Beautifully filmed and acted.  Totally hilarious when (spoiler) he's been drinking windshield washer fluid and tries to get into he old ladie's car with his chop-shop mohawk!  My nitpicks are all logical survival stuff, like blocking off the road... which I'd mark it down for if this was a survival instruction video, which it is not.  Great movie. I hope people get to see it and enjoy it!

I understand this probably isn't for everyone, though.  But if you're thinking about giving this 1 star.  Go watch ""Dark Web"" for a true one-star experience. A pretty blonde lead couldn't even remotely salvage that trash movie.

It's impressive these two guys carry the movie so well. I just keep wanting to say good things about it. I hope you watch it and enjoy it... there are some very funny moments that are done extremely gracefully and these two actors are great in this movie.",1466294400,,1319,4.605150214592275

Both of these men bond and brawl throughout most of the movie as the become stranded and fight to make their way out.

5790925,4,B00DCRE50O,"Scenic Route (Kevin and Michael Goetz, 2013)

Scenic Route was a movie I went into expecting to not like all that much. As far as I can tell, it was basically DTV after playing a few festivals, it showed up on the Popular on Netflix list on instant streaming (usually the things I add from that list show up in the bottom 10% of my queue when I sort by rating descending; Scenic Route was an exception, showing up about halfway down). It stars Josh Duhamel, who hasn't made a good picture since Turistas, and Dan Fogler, who hasn't made a good movie since... well, never. Directed by brothers turning in their first feature and written by a TV guy, though he has turned in one feature script beforefor the almost-legendary Jodie Foster-directed bomb The Beaver. (Yeah, the Mel Gibson hand puppet movie.) I figured I'd be hitting play on this one and, ninety minutes later, starting to write a review so legendarily bad I would be getting hate mail about it long into the next century. More fool me, because I have, as of this writing (Jan. 5, 2014), so far seen thirty pictures that were released in 2013, and I would put Scenic Route in the top five. All of these pieces that should not fit together in any way combined to make something special. [note: opening paragraph written before seeing Europa Report. Between these two movies, Dan Fogler bought a lot of years off his time in purgatory.]

Plot: Mitchell (Duhamel) and his childhood friend Carter (Fogler) are in the middle of a roadtrip when their truck breaks down in the middle of the desert. At the beginning of the ordeal, they seem to be friendly enough about it, but as time goes on and they realize they might be out there without food and water for an extended period of time, the needling gets sharper and more bitter. Will they get rescued before they end up killing each other?

I know the last sentence of that synopsis makes this movie seem like a comedy. It is, as long as you realize it is not only a comedy, and as long as you realize the comedy is about as black as they come; I'm not sure I've seen a more mean-spirited comedy since Very Bad Things. Stephen King described the kinds of arguments that punctuate this movie as arguments that go back and rip off all the old Band-Aids, making all the wounds fresh again. (It's somewhere in 'Salem's Lot if you want to go looking.) Mitchell and Carter have spent their entire lives telling each other all their secrets, as well as observing each other's bad choices, so there's a lot of ammo there.

In order to make it all work, though, putting aside an ambiguous, and quite wonderful, ending that is endlessly debated on the IMDB message boards, you have to have enough of an ear for dialogue that people who get involved in these kinds of arguments will listen to these characters and say yes, that's exactly how it goes. I did exactly that at least a dozen times during this movie. Who knew Killen should have been writing about arguments instead of hand puppets?

On the downside, it's a (mostly) two-person movie set (mostly) in the middle of the desert. That is exceptionally tough to pull off from a pacing standpoint. My Dinner with Carter this movie is not; there are places where the already-pedestrian pace flags even more, though in the movie's defense they are relatively short pieces and can be seen as the filmmakers trying to instill a minor sense of what the characters are feeling. If that interpretation is correct, it doesn't work. Still, that's a relatively small downside for a no-budget movie that came out of left field and smacked me upside the head; I liked this one something fierce. *** ",1395273600,7,3639,4.57361963190184

5790939,4,B00DCRE50O,"Two guys and a truck in the desert. Tough one to pull off but it's pretty good.

Here's the scoop. Two buddies, Mitch (Josh Duhamel) and Carter (Dan Folger) are on a remote stretch of highway in the desert. Carter's pick-up truck breaks down (sort of) and the time they now spend with one another uncovers the misgivings each has of the other's life choices. These misgivings give way to open hostility and the situation gets really intense.

This is all writing and acting and the level of both are very good. The story itself, for the most part, progresses logically. There was one significant plot point that I'm not sure I bought and the end pretty much ticked me off, but this moved along with great believability. I had some serious reservations about Duhamel's acting ability after seeing ""Fire with Fire"" but those were more than swept aside here. He turns in a very credible performance. Dan Folger was also really good. He WAS Carter. His hair, beard, dress and movements felt like someone I'd known in my life. These two played off each other well and there is little in the script that was odd. The things they talk about are things most people have experienced in their lives.

Almost entirely set on this little patch of road, the budget must have been very manageable. It was lensed well, cut well and has genuinely decent soundtrack.
