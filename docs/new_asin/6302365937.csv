456180,3,6302365937,"I bought this video because it appeared to be based on the book UP PERISCOPE writen by Robb White. I bought the book in about 1961 in grade school. I loved the book and read it several times. The movie has the same characters, Kenn Braden, Skipper Stevensen, Pat Malone, Si, etc. It roughly followed the book, except there was a big difference in one outcome. To be honest, I liked the book more, but I really enjoyed the movie. I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had not read that book and tried to follow the two plots. It was a good movie, but, like the one goat said to the other goat as they were eating the film from a movie ""I liked the book better!"" Robb White also wrote a book called SECRET SEA, which I enjoyed almost as much as UP PERISCOPE.",994032000,31,760,4.10738255033557
456181,5,6302365937,"It seemed that ever since the release of 1957's THE ENEMY BELOW, World War II submarine movies enjoyed great popularity during the late 50s. This is one of the better ones directed by Gordon Douglas with stalwart James Garner and cautious Edmond O'Brien. The scenes around the Japanese held island are suspenseful and well filmed by Carl Guthrie. Richard Landau's screenplay is pretty faithful to the novel by Robb White. It also features Edd Byrnes, Alan Hale Jr. and one of my favorite actors Warren Oates.",993081600,70,508,4.9186046511627906

Getting tired of being treated like crap as a customer. No rentals for the future for quite a while. Further, I rarely rent from Amazon since they raised their prices to 3.99 and 4.99 and even more for 50 year old films. Great way to price yourself out of a market.

456554,5,6302365937,"One of my favorites and not always easy to find.  The movie parallels the WW2 film ""Destination Tokyo"" but with more modern interpretation of how sailors & officers behaved.  When you view ""Destination Tokyo"", you see classic textbook ""Little House on the Prarie"" behavior.  When you view ""Up Periscope"" you see behavior like 'U-571"": no one is babied.  What I like about the film is the smooth movement of plot, start to finish, and the realistic portrayal of what the mission could accomplish.  Great acting, great actors and a movie, like ""Twister"" that is fun to watch over and over and over.  Love to play this when I am working and need background.  I think it rivals my enjoyment of ""Independence Day"" (ID4).  Easy to recommend.",1421193600,,735,4.777777777777778

However, as an ex-Navy Nuke who served on an attack boat and with familiarity of Navy Seal Special Ops, this is the most timid skipper I could even imagine.

The scenes of James Garner's character crawling through the bushes on the enemy-infested island reminded me of my friends and I as kids playing army, but it was fun anyway and as this is one of the earlier movies to cover specialty trained commandos in action, I guess they deserve some slack.

456831,4,6302365937,"James Garner and Alan Hale steal the show in this WWII submarine movie made in the late 50s. Edmund O'Brien does a fine job as the skipper of the submarine.

Like most war movies made up into the late 60s it sanitizes war a lot. One cannot have teenagers being drafted to go off to war realizing they might actually get killed or wounded. But, that is just the way movies were made back then.

Of course, most of the movie is not real plausible. It probably would be downright boring if it was.

This is mostly a story of how a submarine carries a navy frogman (Garner) to a Japanese held island so he can sneak in and photograph the code book being used at a radio station there.

The shots of Garner sneaking around in the jungle and slithering through the swamps are pretty good, especially for the time period it was made.

I got a kick out of Garner's character taking the code book out of an unlocked desk drawer in an unoccupied radio room to photograph it.

But, as movies go it was entertaining and fun to watch. It is often shown on cable TV around Memorial Day as it was this year. I DVRd it and watched it yesterday.",1372550400,,1128,4.247663551401869

456860,3,6302365937,"I can't bring myself to really pan this movie, despite its many flaws and shortcomings, because I must admit I was entertained by it. I bought the movie because I have fond memories of reading the book as a young boy back in the 60's. I must have read my Scholastic Book Club version of the novel at least ten times, and never tired of the dramatic story.

Sorry to say, only part of that drama remains in this film version. I can't fault the performances of the main actors, other than Sally Johnson (who in her defense was battling an unplayable script). The action scenes were OK (but nothing to write home about), and in any case I'm a sucker for WWII naval movies even when they're not great. But there are just too many flaws in this film to overlook.

1. James Garner swims to the enemy-held island using SCUBA gear - which wasn't invented until after the supposed time of this story.

2. He's supposed to be coming ashore on the lagoon side of a coral reef, but what he emerges from is painfully obviously the California coastline - complete with heavy surf, which you'd never find in a lagoon on such a windless, clear-weather day.

3. There are Jeeps among the vehicles on the enemy base. The Japanese didn't have Jeeps in WWII.

4. The island is rocky and mountainous. South Pacific coral islands are sandy and almost entirely at sea level or at best a few feet above it. Again, too obviously California. Same for the vegetation.

5. Wa-a-a-y too much disrespect for the captain and insubordination aboard the USS Barracuda. Such behavior would NEVER have been tolerated aboard a real US submarine in WWII. Heads would have rolled.

6. The totally unnecessary love-interest subplot between Garner and Johnson was wooden and completely unbelievable - besides adding nothing to the story line.

7. A flaw shared by nearly every other WWII submarine movie is the incredible interior spaciousness aboard the Barracuda, which in reality would have been cramped and claustrophobic.

But I must mention one really excellent feature of this 1959 film, which is the very human portrayal it gives of the Japanese. They are seen playing baseball, singing sentimental songs, bravely and efficiently responding to an emergency, and in general not behaving like sub-human monsters.",1364342400,3,2278,4.805626598465473

In Technicolor(though not three-strip), in contrasts of light/shadow; the colors are bright, vivid, sharp, life-like and detailed, reminiscent of a time when attention to these and true color meant something.

456916,4,6302365937,"As submarine movies go, UP PERISCOPE is one of the best.  I'd say in the top five.  Of course, RUN SILENT RUN DEEP is the very best of all submarine films and is the gold standards against all WWII films are measured against.  (At least in your reviewer's humble opinion)  Perhaps A BRIDGE TOO FAR is another
 James Garner stars in UP PERISCOPE and is fairly early in his film career.  He shows up and demonstrates that the man can act.  It is strangely quite winning to see Garner without his customary mugging at the camera.  Most of us love Garner's comic side in his film and television careers; but it seems in retrospect that we are missing out on Garner's ability to deliver great acting in drama.

As the story goes, interesting mission.  Certain parts and details in the plot (a real submariner served as advisor) give this film a verisimilitude above most WWII for the times.

My standard complaint against most WWII films is that many average GI Joes act as if they are having a day at the carnival while engaging the enemy.  I realize that during the war and quite a while afterward both filmmakers and the government didn't want the public at home to see how grim the circumstances were that their husbands, brothers and sons had to face; so actual battle scenes were toned down quite a bit--often times to the level of a complete lie.  The truth is the casualty rate on the front lines was profoundly high in the several divisions.  Those flyers in bombers over enemy territory and seaman in the silent service suffered horrific losses.  As far as sub movies go, submariners typically remark that if depth charges really came as close as they show in these films, it would be unlikely the submarine would survive the attack.  An equally standard objection is that it would be highly unlikely for a sub to run on the surface in daylight while in enemy waters.  UP PERICOPE avoids these errors more than most other sub films.  Simply turn off your usual critical B.S. detector you can get into a fine movie.

So, great film.  Great Garner.  I'd watch this on a lazy Sunday afternoon; maybe with my favorite brew or (surprise!) popcorn.  You'll love UP PERISCOPE, too.",1306800000,11,2179,4.605194805194805

456919,4,6302365937,"Pretty pedestrian as war-flicks go, but a nice way to spend a couple of hours.  Well acted, with good video scenery. This is the usual story about sneakiness, secrecy and stealth, with a twist of a little upheaval of authority and disunity of command.  The suspense comes it while Garner sneaks into enemy territory underwater and is delayed returning to the waiting submarine - a submarine commanded by a by-the-book skipper who has little tolerance for special operations and vowed to leave Garner behind if he isn't back at the sub on time.  Overall, a pretty enjoyable flick.",1268870400,,579,4.887755102040816

456922,3,6302365937,"This little-remembered submarine drama was one of Garner's first big movie-star roles.  Made by Warner Bros., the fact that Garner was then starring in ""Maverick"" on tv is prominently mentioned on the original poster artwork for the film that is featured on the dvd cover and the trailer for the film (introduced by the then- young James Garner.)
The bulk of the film is the submarine voyage taking Garner, an underwater demolitions expert and trained commando, to an island in Japanese territory where he is to retrieve some Japanese codebook. (Garner happens to speak Japanese as well.)  The suspense is not only whether Garner will get what he came for, but whether the submarine Commander, Edmond O'Brien, will wait for him.  To be honest the plot is fairly implausible.  First of all, this is Garner's first mission and the mission seems next to impossible, you would think that the Navy would find a more experienced commando for the job.  Secondly, submarine Commander O'Brien gives Garner a ridiculouly short amount of time to complete the mission.  The part of the film where Garner gets to the island and sets about retrieving the codebook is suspenseful, but goes on much too long.
Still this is a fairly well-done film with some good submarine action and nicely filmed in color.  Some other members of the crew include Edward Byrnes, soon to be Warner Bros. teen idol as Kookie on ""77 Sunset Strip,"" and New York Giant football star and future husband of Kathie Lee Gifford, Frank Gifford, as well as an unbilled Warren Oates.  Two other actors associated with being at sea also appear as part of the crew: Alan Hale, Jr., the skipper of ""Gilligan's Island"" and Henry Kulky, who 6 years later would become part of another submarine crew as Chief Curly Jones, the CPO of the Seaview on the first season of ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea."" (Kulky passed away of a heart attack midway through his first and only season of Voyage.)
If you have a couple hours to kill and want to relax through a fairly interesting W.W.II drama, you could do a lot worse than this film.",1262563200,15,2078,4.720994475138122
456923,3,6302365937,"James Garner plays the role of a demolition/diving expert sent on a secret mission in Japanese held territory during WWII.

The film has two main plots: one deals with Garner attempting to successfully complete his mission, and the other centres around how far the submarine commander is willing to go to assist Garner in completing his mission, without putting at risk the submarine and its crew.
