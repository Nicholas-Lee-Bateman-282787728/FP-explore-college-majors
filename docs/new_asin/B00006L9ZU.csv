1784875,5,B00006L9ZU,"Difficult to believe that this superb production is now twenty years old and that James Levine, its mastermind and conductor, looks so vigorous and healthy. While the years have taken their toll on the indomitable Maestro, his Rheingold is still a masterpiece. No need to compare this with what others did before him nor what he and others have done since, on its own, this version should continue to be among the prime selections for those who want Wagner's redoubtable music and song without the ever-more tedious baggage of his translation of human strength and frailty into the virtues and defects of mythological creations.
No doubt, without having read anything yet about the production, there are those who object to the apparent relationship this production bears to the hugely popular science fiction films of its era. I wouldn't argue the point, save to point out that even in the home of Wagnerian presentations, a need was being felt to try to induce an audience, not born to imbibe the Romantic excesses of some aspects of 19th century high culture, to see in Wagner, a still lively presence. While scientific fiction is not my cup of tea, still it was far better than the traditional straitjacket into which those magnificent voices I would hear, over the radio and on 78 RPM those many years ago, had to fit themselves
The scenic design is first rate, the orchestra, under Levine, at its best, a very, very good, best, the singers excellent, and the pacing, just right (for my taste),
Certainly, I would never say that having seen this production, one need not see any other; rather, see this and see the others as well, and, if each has attempted some variation upon those of Wagner's lifetime, you are likely to enjoy all of them",1271203200,,1746,4.78476821192053

THE VINTAGE FEEL OF THE COSTUMES, SETS AND PERFORMANCES TOOK ME BACK TO ANOTHER TIME.....CERTAINLY A MORE ARTISTICALLY REFINED PERIOD.  THIS IS WORTH THE VERY RESONABLE PRICE TO OWN THIS DVD OF DAS RHEINGOLD, THE FIRST OF THE FOUR WAGNER OPERAS OF ""THE RING"".",1241481600,,321,5.037735849056604

1784879,3,B00006L9ZU,"There's a lot good about this, but it doesn't quite gel.  James Morris has a great voice but he doesn't act well--throughout the negotiations with Loge and the giants he looks and sounds like he's faking it, and his expression of fear while being threatened by Alberich is comical.  Siegfried Jerusalem seems totally bored by his role from start to finish.  Ekkehard Wlaschiha has fine focus and a beautiful vocal top but I don't feel sorry for his Alberich, nor do I fear him.  Maybe he's doing this deliberately--some people think it's more faithful to Wagner to make Alberich purely disgusting, without going for sympathy or impressiveness--but here Wlaschiha is clearly trying to be funny.  His Alberich is meant to be laughed at, a big clown.  (Both Morris and Wlaschiha do much better acting in SIEGFRIED.)  The best acting here IMHO is done by Matti Salminen (Fafner), Heinz Zednik (Mime), Marianne Haggender (Freia) and Christa Ludwig (Fricka).  The worst is Jan Hedrik Rootering (Fasolt) who let's just say sounds like he might need some viagra to enjoy Freia if he ever got her.

Much better acting in the Boulez video if you can stand the funny ""industrial revolution"" setting and hilarious giants-on-wheels.",1226793600,2,1219,4.9950495049504955
1784880,5,B00006L9ZU,"I had this on VHS and decided one day to show it to my 5 year-old daughter.  She likes princesses and fantasy and what-not and I was wondering what she would make of Alberich and the Rhein Maidens.  Well, she LOVED them -- and this video became an instant hit.  So much so that we recently forked over considerable dough and purchased the full DVD Wagner set.

As to the criticism of the costuming, I can only say that I always liked it and that my princess-daughter thought it was 'just right'.  [Princesses' do know these things - lol.]

Five Stars.  Lovely production.  Great sound quality.  Some of Wagner's best stuff.  Das Rheingold also features a story line and music that children like.

Notes for Parents:  Opera is loaded with innuendo, violence, and other non-child friendly material.  Das Rheingold by opera standards is pretty tame, having only a little ""V"".",1160092800,7,872,4.733333333333333
1784881,5,B00006L9ZU,"First of all,let me put it out flat in a simple question:Do you want to watch a performance of DAS RHEINGOLD and of the whole tetralogy DER RING DES NIBELUNGEN which adheres quite verbatim

 as much as it is possible to do so to what the author/composer

 wrote? If the answer is no,you'll do well with the alternative

 video versions by Patrice Chereau,Harry Kupfer and Nikolaus Lehnhoff,also in the market. I'm not even gonna mention the newest Stuttgart one under Zagrosek because it really deserves no attention. You can read my full review of that poorly bleak interpretation of the cycle,perhaps written by a bunch of prankster kids in adults'clothings. That is definitely not what

 Wagner wanted. This MET cycle is not laid out in a naturalistic fashion...It is simply produced THE WAY THE COMPOSER WANTED IT

 PRODUCED...An that is more than good enough for me.

 Excellent singing by James Morris's Wotan paired up with veteran

 Christa Ludwig,one of the finest singers of the past century.

 A grouchy Alberich by Ekkehard Wlaschiha(who has made the role one of his specialties)and a great Mime brought about by viennese character tenor Hans Zednik.

 How much more into place falls the voice of bass Jan-Hendrik Rootering here as Fasolt compared to that shameful shot taken at

 Wotan in the Stuttgart cycle!(And I said I wasn't gonna talk about it...Sometimes anger management is a real need!)We also have an illustrious Fafner by finnish bass Matti Salminen,who will return as one of the most diabolical Hagens I've ever seen

 in GOTTERDAMMERUNG.

 Jerusalem's Loge is a real treat indeed. This fine Oberhausen-born german tenor who started his career as a bassoonist and later on as a baritone,finally becoming a full tenor portrays the trickster god with a natural approach which will also be repeated in his both Siegfrieds. We can't obviously compare with

 the ""ancient generation"",but what a luxury this great artist,who has already retired was! Wish we had a Jerusalem or a Peter Hofmann(another victim of that lousy Parkinson disease!)nowadays!

 Recap:Otto Schenk's stage production is the ONLY TRUE ONE to the musician's intentions. If you want to know exactly what he wanted to convey,well this is the ticket, and no other,I repeat

 NO OTHER video nor DVD will give you this.

 Need I talk about the MET's orchestra under Levine? Just draw your own conclusions...

 RATE:EXCELLENT-Compared to this one,no other video version exists,believe you me-I kid you not.

 There's also an excellent digital transfer to DVD to be acknowledged upon which I'm basing this humble opinion,although I also own the videotapes.

 Buy it without even stopping to think twice!",1090627200,18,2686,5.1036866359447
1784882,4,B00006L9ZU,"First and foremost...Jerusalem's Loge is the best out there.  The part is perfect for him.  He does very well in the Met's Siegfried as Siegfried, but it's a bit too heavy of a role for him at times (which is understandable of course...what a role!).  Loge suits him pefectly in manner and signing.
As for the rest, Morris is an excellent Wotan has all the command usually exhibited by great Wotans.  H does a wonderful job.  I was also impressed by whoever sang Fasolt, he just gave an extremely sturdy peformance.  Great tone and a very reasonable Riese (giant).
The first scene (Rhine Maiden's scene) was a bit awkward but to be honest, I've yet to see a production of that scene that I actually did like.  Maybe it's just an awkward scene in general.  Anyway, the next scene more than makes up for that as the stage becomes littered with talent and most of the characters of the opera show up.
The third scene down in Nibelheim is almost as good as the second scene except that I would've have liked to see more out of the other Nieblungs (besides Alberich and Mime) to give more of a sense of dread of Alberich's rule.
I'm not a huge fan of the fourth scene in general (I guess I find it kinda slow) but this is of course in keeping with the rest of the production an extremely admirable scene.  Espescially in the staging of Froh's rainbow bridge.  It is a fairly amaizing special effect for the opera stage.
To sum it all up, this production is certainly worth what you'll pay for it.  Levine's direction and the cast are almost impeccable so the distraction are minimized about as far as they could be.  You'll certaily enjoy the Ring at the Met.",1073088000,12,1654,4.440397350993377
1784883,5,B00006L9ZU,"There is more to like...and less to be somewhat
dissatisfied with...in this Metropolitan Opera
Television Production of -Das Rheingold-.  In the order
of my preferences, from best to lesser, are the
visual effects, the sets, the music and conducting,
the costumes, and some of the singing.  But even
the singing which is less pleasing is only unequal
in certain parts, such as parts of the opening
Rhine scene and with the giants and the gods
in their first encounter.  But this was a live
production, and the mircrophones were placed
as a distance, not right in front of the singers,
as they might be in a recorded version.  So some
of the singing by Alberich in the first scene
seems not quite loud and forceful enough, but
then he is clamboring over the rocks.  The
singing of the giants is also less than a bit
loud enough...and forceful.  But then, things
change...and Alberich's singing in Nibelheim
is very good.
  The visual effects are very captivating to me...
the mists...clouds...that rise from the blue
watery murkiness of the Rhine up to the god-
haven...as the camera pulls back, there is
a wondrous castle in the background...and Fricka
and Wotan are somewhat ""dwarfed"" by it as they
recline on a spiral, slanted set -- meant to represent
some sort of gigantic saucer-shaped rock or cliff
top...but which has wondrous similarity to a
textured, rough, rocky spiral galaxy. Then
there is the red mist...cloud...on the descent
into Nibelheim...and the passing shot in the
background of small dwarves at work in their
cave compartments with shining gleams cast off
here and there...the Nibelheim section is the
best part, as far as I am concerned...the
set is wondrous...a circular cave opening in
the back with the red background...it looks
like some eternal eye...or a gigantic worm-hole
into a fated eternity...
  Also what should be mentioned is the English
translation of the libretto which can be added
by clicking on the opening bars...the translation
is very tough...elemental...pagan...not poetic
or lyrical.  It gives a very real, ominous...compelling...
forceful...underpinning to the visuals and the
German singing going on in the visuals.
 The style of the production is of the Wagnerian
Romantic late 1800s style...the costumes have
that ""period"" look, but the sets are timeless
and elemental, not weirdly modern and anachronistic.
I much prefer the look of this production over the
descriptions given by some of the posters of
the Bayreuth production conducted by Boulez where
the opening Rhine scene, apparently, is set
under the shadow of a hydro-electric dam! And
the Rhine Maidens appear to be ""call girls.""
  The viewer should also consider several levels
of meaning and awareness as he or she watches
this production...and relates the meaning of what
is being said...thoughts about gold, and wealth,
and power, and greed, and revenge...and renouncing
love in order to gain power.  There is definite
social...and psychological critique going on here.
Alberich's critique of the pleasure lives of the
gods sounds as if it might be from the lips of
a Platonist contemplating the fate of the Atlanteans...
or of a 19th century socialist...or of a transcendental
critic/rebuker like Thoreau.  The giants' warnings
to Wotan about the sacredness of contracts and
the bond of one's word, sound like thoughts to think
about in relation to government and governing...
and law...their talk of how Wotan used the pledge-
power of his spear to wield their compliance, sounds
like something out of Thomas Hobbes, and the whole
idea of the social contract.  The more one watches
and listens...and lets several levels of possible
meaning come together, the richer and more
powerful and gripping the genius of bringing
so much myth/psychology/and inspired alienation
and passion together in a work of art, and drama,
and music becomes...
 If you think an opera can't be overwhelming
and stun you...watch the giant Fafner kill the
other giant Fasolt...and watch the stunned,
horrified looks on the gods' faces...and Wotan's
shocked, chastened, brooding look as he realizes
what is happening as a result of the ring's curse.
The scene is powerful...and gripping...
and moving in a profoundly deep and elemental
way... you are truly ""within the spell"" of
the cycle to come...and its relentless
unfolding possibilties...moving ever slowly
but enigmatically...and sadly... toward fatal
fated conclusion...",1051056000,31,4416,5.204513399153738
1784884,2,B00006L9ZU,"Wagner's masterful score is well-executed by Levine, if you can ignore the audience, which coughs like it has TB.  Visually, this production is atrocious.  The Rhine-daughters are about as graceful as three-legged cows and are costumed like cheap mermaid prositutes or fishy spokesmodels for a seafood place.  Loge looks like he's wearing Star Trek TNG latex.  As he climbs the rock to get the gold, Alberich makes the whole thing wobble like something put together by middle-schoolers for their first production of The Ring.  Bad stage direction all around.  The only part I think lived up to Wagner's vision was the cool rainbow bridge at the very end, but you can see that by looking at the DVD case.  Remind me not to attend the Met.  Sounds good but best to watch when blind.",1046476800,10,780,4.768656716417911
7971414,5,B00006L9ZU,"Interesting story of Rheine maidens teasing poor Alberich (Ekkehard Wlaschiha) while protecting gold that can be turned into a ring. The ring in return gives the bearer the world.

Mean while Wotan (James Morris) has had a fortress built by giants in exchange for his sister-in-law Freia. Evidently he was planning on getting out of the deal with the help of his friend Loge (Siegfried Jerusalem). So can Loge work something out and will it involve the ring?

This is the version I grew up with and have seen them when they came to town. I waited for a commercial release of this fine production. One of the added DVD extras is pictures of what now are hokum getups that the previous productions wore. Of course they were a product of their time.

Hopefully one day someone will make a movie of the story; until them this rendition has remain the best representation in costume and sound. I even have the sound recording for the car.",1505433600,,933,4.608433734939759

The conductor James Levine is at his usual best when conducting the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra.

7971421,5,B00006L9ZU,"Perhaps I lack the critical expertise of some of the other reviewers. So stipulated.

I found this performance thoroughly engrossing. I agree that the opening scene is a bit awkward. But it is somewhat the nature of that scene and I believe it plays out sufficiently well. A good job is done creating an illusion of water.

Now lets get to some serious stuff. The acting is excellent. Let's get real folks. Wagner is a very complex man and his operas are not mere recreations of Nordic/Germanic mythology. He's down in the psychology of humanity. Consider Wotan being chided by his wife for infidelity. Blush. Wagner certainly knew that subject. And let's not forget the central theme of forgoing love for power---Morris has some outright ungodlike moments as he appears to wrestle with these issues---brilliant. The giants are hardly benign. They too wrestle with this issue of love versus power and opt for power only to self-destruct. And Wotan at the end, tormented by the siren songs---guilt? Gilt? Geld? Hard to say.

And that last look by loge at the end...what's next???!!!!

Very, very well acted. This opera doesn't overpower Wagner's themes. If you allow yourself to think about the various themes, it will spin your head. This is a great show and a wonderful treatise of the triangle of love, power and eternal youth. There is also a sense of the decline of the gods. They just don't have the juice they used to.

Please give this a go. Even if you are not an opera fan, you'll love it.",1377388800,3,1498,4.724137931034483

Also where were the Harps in scene 4.  As for James Levine I have to be honest in my estimation that he is not a great Wagnerian Intterpreter  of Wagner. I did like the staging as it was more what Wagner had in mind, that ws good to see.
