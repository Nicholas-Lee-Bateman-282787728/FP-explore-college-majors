I've been a fan for about 15 years, and I'll never stop loving this series. This is what made me interested in Japanese Anime and Manga, along with Dragon Ball Z and Gundam.

3153123,5,B001675ZII,I bought this series for my 9 yr son for Christmas.  He watched all 24 episodes in like 2 days!  Then started them over again.  I guess that means it good to him.,1233705600,3,162,3.8484848484848486
3153124,1,B001675ZII,"I have been a Pokemon fan since I could even remember. This must be Do not buy this dvd. I was looking forward to this season. They story plot is great and the idea.

But Pokemon USA decided to hire cheap imitations which pretty much ruined the season and made fans really upset. The actors that made the show it is today are gone. I could not listen to my favorite character with that poor imitation a Ditto will make.  The characters are dull and boring, no emotions at all.  It's ashamed that Pokemon USA has to do that. This season had the potential of becoming the best season of the series.

Do not buy this and I would not recommend anyone to buy it. The shows quality went downhill because of Pokemon USA's action. Bring back the original quality back by rehiring the original voice actors.

Thank You",1224547200,16,809,4.402684563758389
