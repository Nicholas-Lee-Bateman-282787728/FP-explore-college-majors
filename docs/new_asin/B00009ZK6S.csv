1898344,2,B00009ZK6S,"If you're looking for a how-to on self defense this is not for you.  Much of the 58 minute DVD is taken up with Mr. Dalke's philosophy of self defense.  That is, it's better to avoid the situations all together by being aware of your surroundings and not making yourself a target.  I don't disagree at all with his approach but I expected this to be more of a practical approach, applying techniques learned in the dojo to real life situations.
Approximately 30 minutes are spent actually showing various techniques however the draw back is they are geared to defense someone using karate techniques.  That's always a real bug with me; it's not too often that you would be attacked in the street by someone doing a step-punch.  This DVD is not that bad, however I just expected more.
I'm not disappointed with the techniques presented.  Mr. Dalke showed several ways to escape choking and grasping holds but I guess you could say I just wanted more.  I could listen to his thoughts on any karate subject all day long but at the end of the DVD felt like I didn't get much for the money.  Basically I paid $30/hr and was left wanting more.  Much more.
I don't recommend this for someone actually wanting to learn a practical approach to self defense, its way to over priced for what you get.  However if you're a fan of Mr. Dalke's and want to round out your collections of his DVDs, go for it.",1075507200,10,1392,4.466403162055336
1898345,4,B00009ZK6S,"The DVD opens with a demonstration of an advanced kata by Mr. Dalke and then a few one-step sparing techniques.  Then the meat of the DVD begins with Mr. Dalke explaining the finer points of the katas after they are demonstrated by an assistant.  The points are not the basic ""this is how you do an upper block or reverse punch"", but more of what each kata is supposed to be teaching and one or two key points  The katas covered are Heians 1-5, Tekki Shodan, Bassai-Dai,Bassai-Sho, and Hangetsu
I first began my training in 1974 and have been doing these katas for almost 30 years but being no where near Mr. Dalke's level, I found the thoughts presented here are insightful and helpful.  There's always something new and different to learn about even the most ""basic"" techniques.  I'm looking forward to doing the katas now with these ideas in mind and would recommend this to anyone serious about studying karate.
The DVD itself is not the highest quality; it almost gives the impression that it was originally a VCR tape copied to DVD.  The titles and such are a little fuzzy and the sound is similar to one done on a home video recorder.  While neither the video or sound quality are what would be considered professional in the sense of a DVD movie you would buy, this in no way takes away from what you are seeing or hearing.  It is more than adequate for the purpose intended, learning more about karate.  One wish though is for the description to provide more information of what katas are covered in the DVD.  I bought this one wondering what would be on it.  I'm not disappointed however if someone were looking for training on a specific one they could be in for a surprise if its not included and could feel they wasted their money.  Total play time is approximately 60 minutes.
The information and instruction provided rate 5 stars but due to the title not being more descriptive as to what is covered and the somewhat degraded video and audio quality I would rate the DVD overall as 4 stars.  That said, I'm ordering another one!",1073779200,,2043,4.5340599455040875

7994512,4,B00009ZK6S,"Sensei Ray Dalke was very inspirational to me in
my brief study of Shotokan at the University of
California at Riverside.

His #1 student Edmund Otis was also inspirational.

I cannot speak highly enough of Dalke and Otis.
They ran one of the very top classes in the world
and everyone knew it.

There is certainly no substitute for in-person practice.

7994513,4,B00009ZK6S,Well I'm now on tape 3 and really enjoying the series.  The material is outstanding and I would recommend this series to anyone interested in Shotokan Karate,1131926400,,157,4.814814814814815
7994514,2,B00009ZK6S,"I can't give this DVD a high rating as the other reviewers have done.  However, Martial art students are usually loyal to instructors of their own style whether they are mediocre or even poor at performing and instructing their art.

The sound quality is poor.  The katas are performed only once by a black belt student.  The student's performance is not bad. But it does not rate 5 nor even 4 stars.  Ray Dalke appears extremely proud for a style of karate in which it's founder, Gichin Funakoshi, preached humility as a virtue.  Furthermore, this display of pride does not have the quality of instruction nor the demonstrated knowledge or skill to support it.  Ray Dalke waddles into a stance and seems to have difficulty as he lifts his leg 3 times to get it high enough to kick his student in the thigh.  He appears to be having a problem keeping his balance.  He pulls up on both pant legs of his uniform as though the pant legs are too long as he waddles to get ready to perform a front kick.  The student performs the katas.  But it is the instructor who seems to be having a difficult time catching his breath.  The fine points of performing the kata are not all that enlightening neither are some his explanations of the kata's bunkai or applications to self defense.  He explains the obvious moves; but not the moves which are not so obvious as to their function.

When I ordered this video DVD on Amazon, it took a month to receive it.

There are many good martial art instruction videos out there.  This is not one of them.  I recommend that you search around.  Kiyoshi Yamazaki performs the basics and the katas beautifully  with better performed demonstrations of applications.  You can do a search and find his DVDs which are also available on Amazon.  Joel Ertl and Anita Bendickson from Saint Paul, Minnesota have produced a series of videos which includes almost the entire series of Shotokan katas which are the best that I have seen for the purpose of learning.
 [...]

George Dillman's videos #1, #2, #3, #4, #6 have the best explanations of kata bunkai or applications kata moves for Pinan aka Heian and Naihanchi aka Tekki katas.  There are several things I don't like about George Dillman's videos.  Never the less, he has better explanations of bunkai applications to self defense than I have seen anywhere else.

Martial artists often seem too sensitive to criticism.  Buy this one by Ray Dalke if you want it.  I wish that I did not.",1110326400,15,2460,4.593103448275862
7994515,3,B00009ZK6S,"How the hell can you make a video that has the talent of Ray Dalke in front of the camera, and not make a great video? Well that's what's happened here I'm afraid. Too much talk and too little action. Dalke is a legend and rightly so, but the producers of this video did not do him justice. Can't reccomend.",1102809600,4,307,4.133333333333334
7994516,5,B00009ZK6S,"I had the good fortune of training under Mr. Dalke while a student at UC Riverside in 1989-91. While dubious ""grand masters"" and ""10th-degree black belts"" abound, Mr. Dalke is the real thing. Not only is he distinguished worldwide as an authentic and excellent karate practitioner, Mr. Dalke is also an enthusiastic and eloquent instructor.
Both sparring videos (Kumite #1 and #2) effectively distill the essential principles that Mr. Dalke has taught for many decades. The concepts of attitude, timing, and distance he emphasizes form the basis for highly effective competitive and self-defense strategies.
If you don't get the opportunity to train with Ray Dalke personally, these videos are the next best thing.",1089244800,5,714,5.327433628318584

learned a lot from this DVD. It showed me how to perform every kata exactly
how it should be done.",1089158400,,175,3.888888888888889
