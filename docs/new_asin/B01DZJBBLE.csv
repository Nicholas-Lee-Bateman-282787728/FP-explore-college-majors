8757406,1,B01DZJBBLE,"It is an imperfect product the start menu has a pirated vibe to it (like the ones you'd buy at a flea market), has inadequate instructions, a lack of a proper Eng. translation ( not even the option of Eng. subtitles), overall as a consumer I am incredibly dissatisfied with the purchase of this DVD Set.

The only good thing I have to say is that the Box was gorgeous.",1472342400,3,368,4.257142857142857
