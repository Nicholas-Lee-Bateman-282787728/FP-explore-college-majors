7966632,4,B00006AUJ3,"The New Method 20/20 Series: Precision Abs is forty-five minutes long and was released on DVD on September 12, 2002. The DVD is no different from the VHS version. Precision is divided into to segments with two different instructors.

Workout 1: Jennifer Kries

Jennifer starts out with some breathing exercises then switches to some arm stretches and then leg\knee bends. Her standing exercises appear in the following order: sun salutation, classical ballet moves, ton do and a few minutes later some leg lifts are incorporated into the exercise. After ten minutes of standing exercises, Jennifer does some floor exercises beginning with cat and cow and switching to active cat. When she is done with those two, the rest of the exercises that follow are: the mermaid, breathing exercises, the hundred, a few roll-ups, back to cat and cow, downward facing dog and finally knee bends.

Workout 2: Lisa Wheeler

Lisa begins with sun breaths then goes into knee bends and later knee bends with contractions. She does a second round, but the feet are wider apart. This is followed by a series of arm flowing exercises. After about five minutes of standing exercises, Lisa starts on floor exercises leading off with some curls that evolve into roll-ups. Lisa does the following order of exercises: the hundred with legs straight up, leg\hamstring stretches, clockwise and counter-clockwise leg circles on each leg, single leg, scissor, criss-cross, rolling ball, saw, cat and cow, knee push-ups and ends with the mermaid.

Workout one is in my opinion geared toward beginners while Workout two is geared toward beginner\intermediates. Both exercises are great for people starting out or trying to get back into exercising. The New Method 20/20 Series: Precision Abs gets a B+.

7966633,3,B00006AUJ3,"I saw this in the public library, and because I have been wanting to find a workout that will target my abs, thought it might be worth trying out. I don't think you will get any precision abs anytime soon with this one, frankly. I didn't feel very challenged at all, in the abs area. I did feel challenged to master stretching and breathing techniques, as well as some coordination. The DVD is heavily yoga & ballet, with some standard Pilates moves, and it is just taken for granted that you will think about trying to engage your abs as you do the moves that are not abs-focused. Try some other workout if you strictly want to target your abs. If you want a very nice low-impact workout that will allow you to practice a lot of good breathing and relaxation techniques, this one will serve that purpose quite well.",1186790400,,816,4.446666666666666
7966634,5,B00006AUJ3,"I picked this DVD up at a discounted price yesterday. At first when I previewed it at home I was thinking ""This is not my kind of thing"". However, in the past when I've felt this way about workouts and then actually tried them, I've ended up liking them more often than not so I've learned not to judge a workout until I've tried it.

 Anyway, I literally just walked off my mat to the computer to share my views of both 20 minute segments of this program.

 The first 20 minute routine is led by Jennifer Kries with several students practicing along with her. The set for both routines is really nice (the floor is a really cool Yin/Yang symbol) and the music is live African percussion.

  The routine is a combination of Yoga, Pilates and some Ballet movements. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it, even the ""ballet"" type moves.  Basically a lot of them were like gentle ""chair"" poses (which are  squatting type movements) and they actually warmed up my legs nicely without stressing out my knees. You are also moving your arms gently which I found interesting since it was different than the types of movements I've done in the past.

 If you are looking for a sweaty and intense workout this won't be what you are looking for. Also this first segment is not an ""Ab heavy"" routine (the title is a bit misleading because it sounds like both routines will be very Ab focused, still I enjoyed it), rather you engage your core throughout.

 The second routine one was much more challenging with a much more intense Abdominal focus using Pilates. Lisa Wheeler is the instructor and it has much of the Pilates ""Stomach Series"" (single leg stretch, double leg stretch, scissors, criss cross) which is preceded by the ""hundred"" and ""leg circles"" along with some ballet and Yoga stuff. She also does 10 pushups (knee pushups but certainly one can make them harder).

 So the first routine is more Yoga and Ballet with some Pilates moves where the second one is much more Pilates, some Yoga and Ballet.

 I enjoyed both routines a lot and I'm definitely happy to have purchased them. The irony is that I probably wouldn't have gotten it if I knew it was this type of fusion practice yet fortunately I didn't know because it ended up being something I can see myself really enjoying a lot! I will certainly be more open to other programs like this in the future.

 I can see using the first routine on low energy days as a way to open the body up or as a prelude to doing a more Core focused Yoga program like Baron Baptiste's ""Core Power"" or Bryan Kests ""6 Minute Abs"", the second one I can see using before doing a more intense Yoga routine with perhaps less of an Ab focus.

  Some other short programs I'd recommend that have a bit more of an intense Ab's focus are ""Quick Fix Pilates Abs"" or ""Liz Gillies Progressive Pilates Target Tone"" which has a great ""Abs"" section.

 Jennifer Kries earlier ""Precision Toning"" is a fantastic Pilates program (VERY challenging, a real serious and thorough Pilates mat workout!) that will certainly get your abs (and the rest of your body going). It's around 45 minutes so it may not be what you are looking for if you came to this 20/20 program looking for short self contained routines. But if you want a real ""Pilates Challenge"" that is the most challenging Pilates program I am aware of.",1149379200,9,3330,4.511666666666667
7966635,2,B00006AUJ3,"When I bought the DVD ""Precision Abs"" I thought the workout would concentrate on excercises for the abdominal muscles. However most of the time is spent with ballet- and pilates-like stretching (mostly for the legs) and some posture and breathing exercises which have only marginal effects on the abdominal muscles.
It is probably OK if you want to improve flexibility and posture, but not if you need some concentrated abs workout.
After trying some videos, I think the thing to do is get a good book on abdominal exercises, learn the proven routines, get some weights and resitance bands and do the boring reps each day with increasing resistance and number of repititions.
Sigh.",1053302400,11,681,4.982456140350878
7966636,4,B00006AUJ3,"Precision abs gets right to business using Yoga and Pilates moves with some ballet also. The background music fits to right into the Yoga attitude. I was impressed since I'm one that loses interest if the workout repeats too much or lacks challenge or is WAY, WAY, too long. This workout cuts to the chase and doesn't become boring.",1041120000,3,332,4.6440677966101696
