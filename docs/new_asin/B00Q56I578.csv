8690346,5,B00Q56I578,"As reviewer Daisy mentioned, this is actually a DVD-R, not a commercially-manufactured DVD.  Given that Indoor Cycling Videos is a (very) small business and this was arguably a trial balloon offering to gauge interest in a physical version of their downloadable workouts, the choice of format is perfectly understandable as a cost-control measure.  Having said that, the fact the item is a DVD-R should've been made explicit.  I, too, was less than thrilled when I obtained my copy (directly from Indoor Cycling Videos, when it was first released on November 2014) and realized it was a DVD-R.

In the grand scheme of things - and considering the price of commercially-manufactured indoor trainer workout like those from Spinervals, whose offerings are essentially old VHS workouts poorly transferred to DVDs - the fact this item is a DVD-R really doesn't matter.  (To be sure, it boasts significantly better quality and resolution than all of the Spinervals DVDs I've purchased!)  But it would have been nice to have that information at hand when deciding to make a purchase.

As for the workout itself, I can tell you the scenery is absolutely beautiful and the workout definitely worth the money.  It is essentially a POV video of a ride on country roads in Germany, with background music and some visual cues.  It is NOT a structured workout.  There is a ""Difficulty Bar"" at the bottom of the screen that roughly coincides with the terrain elevation and thus how hard Ms. de Vos considered that part of the ride.  You can use the different segments of the bar as cues to shift and change resistance, change your cadence, or both.  This actually allows you to do the workout one day as, for example, a medium-intensity workout, and as an easy recovery workout on another.  It's up to you, and that's part of the fun.  (Instructions on how to use the Difficulty Bar are included.)

In contrast to the experience of the aforementioned earlier reviewer, I have not encountered ANY issues with the display of the Difficulty Bar, either on a laptop, a 32"" HDTV or an iPad.

The bottom line:  If you're looking for a structured workout for your indoor trainer sessions, look elsewhere.  (May I suggest The Sufferfest?)  If you're looking for eye-candy suitable for easy spinning sessions or to use for recovery workouts, you won't be disappointed.",1454803200,,2344,4.903553299492386
8690347,3,B00Q56I578,"I bought this through Amazon.de - The scenery and music are very nice. However, I'd like to point out that this is not a proper DVD but a DVD-R (recordable media), which is not stated anywhere on Amazon's description of the item. Therefore, the image quality is not as good as I was hoping for. Secondly, the bottom of the screen shows a timer and also a graphic bar indicating the ""difficulty profile"" from start to end, however, the bottom half of this bar and timer are not showing on the TV screen, because the image doesn't quite fit in a 16:9 ratio (it's slightly too big). I tried other aspect ratios (including 14:9 and 4:3) but that bottom section is still not showing in it's entirety, therefore it is really useless on this DVD-R. When watching the same video on the creator's website, it all shows perfectly well, but not once it was transferred to the disc. If all of the above would have been correct and this was also an actual DVD, I would have given it 5 stars.",1428537600,,978,4.4088397790055245
