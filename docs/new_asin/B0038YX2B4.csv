4092371,5,B0038YX2B4,"I love this DVD.  I tried it on Exercise TV and knew immediately it was a keeper.  I really like the 40-minute total body workout with Marco Reed because it's really tough!  I normally do a boot camp and these are the kinds of exercises I'm used to doing.  He leads you through burpees, weighted jump squats, weighted jump ropes, plank rows, squats with military press, lunges, pushups and more.  The exercises are not complicated to learn, but they are certainly tough and you will sweat!

In Marco's workout, there are two 20-minute sets of exercises.  He does each exercise for 45 seconds and then you get a 15 second break while he demonstrates the next exercise.  Each set has 10 exercises; you go through them once and then repeat them in reverse.  There are only a couple of issues.  There's no warm-up or cool-down, so be sure to do your own.  And at the end of the workout, two exercises are skipped.  If you do the routine, it's easy to spot because you're doing the exercises in reverse and the last two are just left out.  It's not a big deal.  I just remember to do them on my own at the end, and then I do my own abs routine (or Steve Maresca's if I have an extra 20 minutes) and cool-down.

I've only does Steve Maresca's ab workout once but it was good.  I love Steve's energy and enthusiasm!

This is a fantastic workout for intermediate to advanced exercisers.",1284854400,4,1378,4.404761904761905
4092372,5,B0038YX2B4,"I love Steve and Marco's energy in this workout.  They do a great job keeping me motivated!! The moves in this DVD are also pretty straight forward and effective which keeps me coming back.  It's challenging, but not so hard that I don't want to do it.  I actually look forward to days when I get to do this DVD at home, and you can mix and match the workouts!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Body-By-Jake-Series/dp/B0038YX2B4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Body By Jake Series</a>",1270425600,,514,5.7368421052631575
4092373,4,B0038YX2B4,"I was looking for a challenging fitness DVD to work on my midsection and this one really fits the bill. This workout DVD is a great buy because it has variety! With a few different workouts varying in difficulty, it definitely proves to be worth the price.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Body-By-Jake-Series/dp/B0038YX2B4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Body By Jake Series</a>",1270425600,,416,6.867924528301887
8391836,4,B0038YX2B4,I saw results and found the exercises to be very beneficial,1434585600,,59,4.454545454545454
8391837,4,B0038YX2B4,The program is perfect for me. Challenging enough yet easy to modify. The problem is the video quality. Blurry.,1419984000,,111,4.894736842105263
8391838,5,B0038YX2B4,"This kicks butt!  Seriously! Marco Reed is amazing, and trust me, you'll feel it the next day.  It's 40 minutes of hard core working out!",1386633600,,137,4.44
8391839,5,B0038YX2B4,this workout is the real deal . Interval training with weight lifting while incorporating your body weight . there's no beating workouts like this ! effective and fast - burns a lot of calories and rips your core.,1375574400,,213,4.631578947368421
8391840,3,B0038YX2B4,"The exercises are good but it doesn't flow.  There are too many lulls, too much down time in between going to the next exercise and it seems random.  It was just 'eh""  was okay.  Not my favorite.",1369440000,,195,4.1891891891891895
8391841,5,B0038YX2B4,"I sued to do this when Exercise TV was around and glad I found it again on DVD.  Marco Reed is an excellent instructor and his workout is demanding and very rewarding to complete.

He does a set of 10 exercises and then the same 10 in reverse and that is about 20 minutes.  After that, 10 new exercises and in reverse again for 20 minutes as well. The exercises are combinations of weight training, cardio, isometrics, plyometrics; the whole gamut, which is what makes this a very challenging workout.

Love it and would highly recommend. It's a body changer workout for sure. DVD also comes with Steve maresca's ab workout, about a 20 minute workout on just abs that is also very good but I specifically bought this for Marco Reed's 40 minute total body workout.",1365033600,,763,4.547445255474453
8391842,5,B0038YX2B4,I really liked this workout when it was on exercise t.v. so now that it is not on demand anymore it was nice to be able to get it. It is a good workout and not like all the rest. I like the variety and that is pushes me.,1335139200,,220,3.510204081632653
8391843,5,B0038YX2B4,"Marco Reed is the best trainer I've ever came across. It is too bad that he has very few product available to purchase.
I  have most of Jillian and Bob's workout DVD, but nothing is harder than this one.
Marco doesn't waste alot of times on warming up and stretching, gets right into the workout.
I use two 10 lb weight for this workout, ( I think most girls uses 5 lb), many many moments I want to change to 5 lb.
It is most effective way to spend 40 min.",1329004800,,456,4.010989010989011
8391844,5,B0038YX2B4,"In 40 minutes this workout will have you feeling great.
It works all major muscle groups and it moves at a quick pace.
Marco is a great trainer.",1324944000,,144,4.178571428571429
8391845,2,B0038YX2B4,"Without Steve Maresca's full body workout, this video isn't worth it for me.  It does have his abs workout, and Marco Reed's full-body workout, but Steve Maresca's full body workout is the best of the series for me, and it's not on the video.  Therefore, I don't recommend it.",1297296000,6,276,4.612244897959184
