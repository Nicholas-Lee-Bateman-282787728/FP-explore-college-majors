8308884,1,B001HKRKAK,Worst introduction film I have had. I have had this for a few years now and so far it is pointless to show anyone and a waste of time and money. I do not recommend this to anyone.,1519084800,,179,3.736842105263158
8308885,4,B001HKRKAK,Overall an excellent catalog and demonstrations of Mantis Kung Fu.  There is a considerable amount of explanation and demonstration of this fascinating style.,1462579200,,158,5.869565217391305
8308886,1,B001HKRKAK,"doesnot represent northern preying mantis at all just made to make a quick buck wouldnot refer to anyone no applications,or footwork this is what americans refer to nothing but dance no substance even the title is a joke compared the the real system",1359849600,,249,4.813953488372093
8308887,2,B001HKRKAK,"I was initially surprised to find out that the first 5 to 10 minutes was a composite of a poor dialogue conducted in Chinese. The tape as a whole showed poor visual quality which included subtitles in Chinese characters and English. After the initial dialogue which is about the different types of Praying Mantis systems a two man demonstration was presented and the visual quality was a little better. However after the demonstrations continued with various change of venue the quality got increasingly worse. I believe the taping was conducted via various types of personal video tape recorders used by students and on lookers. The vocal quality throughout the tape was muffed and had extreme static.

If you know Chinese you might fair better. I studied Praying Mantis under the Plum Blossom and Seven Star systems and was familiar with the various techniques being employed and/or demonstrated. However, if you are looking for a good training tape, this is not it. It is at best a good demonstration tape showing some applications of the system as a whole.",1344297600,,1060,4.955056179775281
