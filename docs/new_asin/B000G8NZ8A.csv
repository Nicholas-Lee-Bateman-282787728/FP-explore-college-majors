8239680,2,B000G8NZ8A,"This is a B movie that I give a D to.  It was shot on a really cheap budget, the scene when the woman is attacked is  not that violent or exploitational.  The girl is basically ready and willing.  This movie might be worth a watch, but not a buy, I wish I could have found a way to rent it then I wouldn't have bought it.  Also it's in Italian with no subtitles.",1315094400,,362,3.8378378378378377
