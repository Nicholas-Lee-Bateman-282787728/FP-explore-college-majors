6406813,5,B00K856ENO,"Enjoyed, just wish I noticed it was on Netflix 1st.  Would have saved me a couple bucks.. lol

But I don't regret..

Although, I don' t like the trend of what used to be a bonus or a collectors version with bonus features is becoming an entirely new release ..

This behind the scenes pranks documentary is great tovwatch. I liked it better then the injected story of the actual original  movie.",1406851200,,395,4.430555555555555

6406817,1,B00K856ENO,Don't waste your money or time on this bad grandpa. 5 is not the movie that johnny Knoxville released in theaters thats why I'm giving it a zero star rating  it should have been a bonus disk  with regional dvd blu ray release  I for one will be geting rid of it and buying bad grandpa it's self,1405555200,,294,4.0344827586206895
6406818,4,B00K856ENO,"Good, but not as great as Bad Grandpa. What we have here is basically a glorified bonus feature that would have been more at home on the original Bad Grandpa Blu-ray release than as it's own standalone release. This is more of a feature-length ""making of"" documentary/retrospective which focuses on the early ideas and stunts/pranks that didn't make it into the final film. It is entertaining and fun, but don't go in expecting this to be a true film like Bad Grandpa was.",1405296000,,472,4.698795180722891
6406819,4,B00K856ENO,Damn funny! Disappointment did come as it thought it was entirely new not out takes and a making of. Needless to say I rarely watch tv or movies. It takes well... Jackass type stuff too keep me glued. Slapstick. A lost art and these people have no clue what's happening! It's candied camera on crack. Playing pranks on unsuspecting people. I had a grin damn near the whole movie. Lots of unseen footage. All of it really. Don't know what the reviewer that said it's not new is smoking. Must be good. :),1404777600,,502,4.408602150537634

6406821,1,B00K856ENO,"They said they had many clips not shown in the movie, not true.  I loved the movie, which is the main reason I rented this garbage.  It's basically a behind the scenes feature you'd get on the DVD.  DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS.  I did....and now a sour & salty individual.",1402876800,4,274,4.211538461538462
6406822,4,B00K856ENO,"While I love everything Jackass, Johnny Knoxville, and Jeff Tremaine, I have to warn you that .5 is a lackluster reflection of Bad Grandpa.  It is a behind the scenes documentary with funny outtakes and scenes that were left out of the movie for obvious reasons.  They just are not as funny as the ones knit into the first film's plot.

Still, you will get quite a few laughs and giggles out of Bad Grandpa .5--especially if you are a die hard fan of the original movie.  If you did not love Bad Grandpa, this doc is not for you.

This movie details how the gang shot scenes and gags, what went wrong, why things were left out of the theatrical release, etc.

Almost a 5 Star funny movie, but as hilarious and unpredictable as Knoxville and crew are, these scenes just are not THAT funny.  It is fun to see how they put together Bad Grandpa, though.  So this movie vacillates between the interesting and the funny quite a bit.

Worth renting.  Only buy if you are a long-time Jackass fan.",1402185600,18,988,4.3791208791208796

6406854,5,B00K856ENO,"Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa is a very funny movie with a heart. I loved this movie and found myself laughing out loud more than once. In case you are unfamiliar with the what Bad Grandpa is about; Bad Grandpa is a 2013 hidden camera comedy film written by Jeff Tremaine, Spike Jonze and Johnny Knoxville and directed by Jeff Tremaine. Bad Grandpa has a loose plot that connects the stunts and pranks together as opposed to the three original Jackass films which had no plot. The story follows 86-year-old Irving Zisman (Knoxville) takes a trip from Nebraska to North Carolina to take his 8 year-old grandson, Billy, back to his real father. I am glad I watched this movie and would definitely recommend it to others.

Thank you for reading my review.",1410220800,,752,4.696969696969697
