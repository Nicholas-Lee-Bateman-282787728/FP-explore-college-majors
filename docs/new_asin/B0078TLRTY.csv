5063365,3,B0078TLRTY,"James and his friends set out to interview an author who claims that the people of Madison County have been hiding a serial killer in their midst, but unfortunately for them, it's true! Director Eric England has unwittingly unlocked the secret to destroying suspense in his new film MADISON COUNTY. Moody atmosphere and creeping terror need not apply in this boring, generic Slasher. Instead, the kills are committed by a villain who literally walks up and stabs his victims in broad daylight, a villain who doesn't even give the audience the slightest bit of satisfaction by ripping off a few heads or tearing out his victims' throats. MADISON COUNTY is completely uninventive in every way, and England makes no attempt to hide the numerous genre influences that helped to shape the film. Horror fans will easily pick out the direct visual and audio references to THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, MOTEL HELL, THE DEVIL'S REJECTS, and many more. As if things were not bad enough, MADISON COUNTY is nauseating to watch thanks to the constantly-shaking camera. Not even the mediocre acting from the cookie cutter characters can save the film from falling into the sea of forgettable Slashers.

5063366,3,B0078TLRTY,"Interesting movie....Too much back-story hinted at but not explained.  This seems like  a good first movie, but there are no hints as to why the ""bad guy"" wears a pig head, how this whole thing got the tacit support of the town, etc.",1357171200,2,233,4.395348837209302
5063367,3,B0078TLRTY,"I decided to watch this on Netflix Streaming (available as of 11/17/12) and I was pleasantly surprised. Madison County follows a group of young college students as they travel to Madison County to interview the author of a book; that book tells of 33 grisly murders committed by local psychopath Damien. Madison County is a decent slasher flick.

Madison County's story really isn't anything special; it has your typical slasher clichs and characters. The characters also continue to follow the traditional horror format, as in, they continue to make bad decisions; somehow, every single character ends up foolishly splitting up in an area that may have a serial killer and immediately after they were threatened at knife point at the diner. However, Damien's character/costume design is creepy and unique. Damien runs around in a pig head, and his scenes are thrilling and intense; and his kills are brutal and violent, with mostly stabbings occurring. Damien has the potential of becoming a horror icon with a little more effort. Unfortunately, Damien's screen time is mostly limited to the second half of the film. With this, the film sends a Wrong Turn/Texas Chainsaw Massacre vibe to the audience, which is good. The music was good, and the acting was decent (for an independent horror film, at least). The ending was little unfulfilling (I'm guessing this was purposely done for potential sequels), yet chilling.

Madison County, is a decent slasher flick; it suffers from flaws a lot of modern horror films suffer from, but the sinister villain helps the film a bit. I recommend streaming or renting before purchasing, unless your a big fan of slashers.

Madison County has strong violence and gore, and some nudity. (no sex)",1353110400,3,1732,5.0701754385964914
5063368,1,B0078TLRTY,"Comparing a slasher film to another slasher film is common since the genre itself is both simplistic and repetitive, but for crying out loud I can't believe just how much this film ripped off the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The entire time watching it you can tell the filmmakers are amateur which is okay sometimes because if their story/characters are well written then the movie can still be good. But not this case, everything in this is recycled slasher cliches. Usually I don't care if I see a bad slasher film because it's common to run into one, especially if you've seen as many as I have, but it's been a long time since a slasher flick literally made me angry. This film made me so angry, not because of how bad it was, but because this film ripped of Chainsaw Massacre so much and it's so painfully unoriginal that regardless of that it still got a wide dvd release. This is quite possibly the weakest slasher film I've ever seen. I'd rather watch a dumb, mainstream, pretentious PG-13 horror film than watch this. I'm never watching it again, I'm throwing it away. If you want to watch something unforgettable and disturbing, go watch the original 1974 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.",1350950400,3,1196,4.7
5063369,1,B0078TLRTY,"Awful, awful movie. This is a horrible homemade slasher movie, and they throw in what seems like an adorable, granny who turns out to be nuts too. The killer is supposed to be disfigured, but you never see his face, all you see is the big pig mask he wears.
This movie is a cheesy imitation of Friday the 13th. I purchased this movie in February and am just watching it 8 months later. If I could request a refund I would.",1350777600,,422,4.158536585365853
5063370,3,B0078TLRTY,"A group of four college students travel to a small Ozark community to interview David Randall (Dayton Knoll) who claims the county has a serial killer who has never been caught and the town covers up. The five students are lead by James (Colley Bailey) and his friend Will (Matt Mercer). Will brings his girlfriend Brook (Joanna Sotomura). Her girlfriend Jenna (Natalie Scheetz) tags along because she likes James. Brook's unlikable brother Kyle (Ace Marrero) crashes the group because he doesn't like Will with his sister.

I think the opening pretty much gives you a fairly predictable plot. The movie has killing with the occasional blood squirt and close-up. It shakes the camera around to create excitement. The story ends without full closure, unless you read between the lines and even then it doesn't explain everything. It lines itself up for a sequel. The film needed some humor in the beginning and maybe create a running joke or some irony with the killing. It lacked good dialouge and Kyle was the only character that was built and that was only because he was a d-bag. Might work as a slasher rental. Don't spend too much.

5063371,3,B0078TLRTY,"I'm all for low-budget films. If you've read my reviews, you'd know I watch and purchase my share of them. For the most part, each one that I've bought has been worth the price I've paid. I don't know what to say about Madison County, though.

Madison County tells the story of a group of college kids who go to a small mountain town to interview a man about several grisly murders that happen there. Yet, when they get there, the man is nowhere to be found. The townsfolk act like they haven't seen the man in years, saying that the killer never existed and the murders never happened at all. When the kids start digging deeper for answers, they get alot more than they bargained for.

I won't lie to you. Madison County is a fun, competent slasher film. It held my interest til the very end(which is more than what I can say about some low-budget affairs I've seen).  However, Madison County isn't without some glaring flaws. First and foremost; It's, basically, your typical slasher film. There's nothing original about it. It does very little(if anything) to distinguish itself from other movies of this ilk. Second, the storyline is a tired one that's been used time and again. Why can't they come up with a better reason to go to Madison County? Third and last, it's abit too tame for my tastes. I would've loved to see some imaginative kills, you know? Course, I will say this for Director Eric England, he does know how to create atmosphere and tension in his films. It's pretty evident in this film. I think he has the potential to become a much better horror film director, to be honest.

As I said before, though, Madison County is a fun, competent slasher film even though it's your typical slasher film. It's a decent timewaster at the very least, if nothing else.",1344384000,,1777,4.561128526645768

5063376,2,B0078TLRTY,"I expected this to be utter garbage. You know, the kind thats been filmed in a backyard somewhere by a bunch of kids for a school project. The kind of movies that are taking over Redbox and Netflix.  Thankfully it wasn't nearly that bad, but it wasn't very good either.

It's the same sort of story we've all seen a million times in various other horror films. College kids drive to some town for some reason or another - for the purposes of this movie its to interview a man about his book which is on a local serial killer - and they end up getting involved with a family of killers. I needed MORE. Something ""special"" for this movie to stick out, and the killers costume wasn't enough - a guy in overalls with a pigs head for a mask.

The characters were alright, not a huge background story to them other then one of the girls and her brother. For some reason she's hiding that she's dating another guy in her group, and her brother has been sent to go with her to ""protect"" her from this guy. Its just stupid considering she's a college student.

There is some decent gore, and a little nudity. But that didn't really help it much. By the last 3rd of the movie I was kind of bored and just wanted it to be over with.

5063380,1,B0078TLRTY,"The trailer for this thing made it look like it might be good but the 'movie' itself is utterly boring and AWFUL (not even in a bad 'B-movie' sort of way). It takes over 45 minutes before anything happens and when it does it's such a letdown because you realize these people are basically insulting your intelligence! EVERY kill scene (there's maybe 5 at the most) are people getting stabbed (with the tired old machete in the gut trick) or hit over the head! Utterly BORING kill scenes, boring dialog, 'chase scenes' that look like a backyard amateur video on YouTube, complete with utterly STUPID scenes like a girl hiding behind a tree that's thinner than she is but the killer doesn't notice her even though he's looking right at her! These 'movie makers' weren't even trying. It seems all they concentrated on was tricking people with a promising trailer and the 'movie' itself was cobbled together as an afterthought.

5063385,3,B0078TLRTY,"Madison County's biggest fault as a horror film is not what it does but, what it doesn't do. And that is deviate at all from the backwoods horror sub-genre formula. The movie follows the clich' blueprint of getting five attractive twenty-somethings to a secluded rural area where they can be placed in proximity with the trademarked deranged locals. In this case they are going to research a book about a serial killer who may, or may not exist in secluded rustic Madison County. Director/writer Eric England seems to have seen enough of these films to put one together competently on a technical level. There is some nice production value for a flick reportedly made for around $70,000. The visuals are fine and creepy and he does create some nice atmosphere and some tension. His cast of young attractive characters are likable enough and there is some blood once things get going. But, England follows the formula so closely that there aren't many surprises. You know the locals are suspicious and strange for a reason and that there really is no question as to whether the killer really exists. His leads while likable are not overly interesting. The locals are generic creepy hillbillies and the villains are never given enough screen time to build their characters and thus aren't that frightening. They never rise above the clich' evil redneck stereotype and we just can't generate enough interest in them to care or be afraid. Even the pig masked killer, Damien Ewell, that is the main nut job, is very ho hum even when on the attack. It's as if England thought a pig mask was enough to create character and menace. And, as far as these films go, Madison County is bit too tame. In this case a little over the top would have been welcome as nothing grabs us, shocks us or horrifies us. There is blood but, it is basically some routine stabbings and ax wounds. And since we've waited till the last act to get to the good stuff, we feel a bit cheated by what little we get and how soon it's over. (With credits County is barely over 80 minutes.) If you are going to present a classic scenario like this, shake things up a bit (ex. Cabin In The Woods). Or at the very least, throw all the classic elements at us with a bit of good old fashioned ferocity. For a horror flick, Madison County is far too laid back. No, I don't think Eric England is a bad filmmaker, he can create tension and atmosphere and I've seen far worse then his Madison County but, he needs to learn that innovation is far more effective then imitation when it comes to the horror movies he obviously enjoys. And if you can't innovate, throw some blood and carnage in our faces to keep us awake. Madison County is still a mildly enjoyable horror but, I think England has the potential to deliver much more.",1336608000,3,2782,4.566
5063386,4,B0078TLRTY,"Madison County is a fun little backwoods slasher..
Nothing new here but like I always say,that's ok with me. I like My Slashers with this familiar formula.

Some kids go to Madison County to write a school paper on a Local serial killer and they find AGAIN,you should never stop at a raggedy looking cafe or gas station in the boonies.

The violence was high in volume but the gore was pretty tame,lots of blood but not much in the special effects department. What they did do was done well and I would rather see fewer effects done well than lot's of over the top cheesy effects.

It had some scary moments and the killer was creepy and fun to watch,I'm just mad that the hottest guy got slashed first..Of course,that's all up to taste so it's no spoiler.

There's also a creepy old lady that will make quite an impression on the viewer.
There was one line that bothered me and seemed juvenile and trite. One guy asks his girlfriend about her plans to go to college and her reply was 'Don't Be gay'..WTF does that even mean???????????
Otherwise it kept my attention and I would like to see a sequel..",1336435200,12,1101,4.435643564356436
5063387,2,B0078TLRTY,"Have you ever seen a movie where the production stills were more impressive than the movie itself? ""Madison County"" is a lot like that except it's not a complete waste of time either. The horror begins with a scene of a young girl in her underwear waking up in the back of a moving pickup truck. She jumps out, cries for help, and gets hit in the back of the head by the truck driver. Then we're introduced to James (Colley Bailey) and his friends taking a trip to ""Madison County"" to interview an author. James has been exchanging letters with David Randall, the author. The book is about a serial killer named Damien Yule who has killed over thirty people over a few decades, but nobody in ""Madison County"" has ever said a word about it. James wants to get the people's perspective for a thesis paper even when all signs point to him and his friends just packing up and heading back home.

I fully expected ""Madison County"" to be your typical B-grade horror movie. The concept art on the DVD box did look kind of promising. A guy in a pig mask killing college kids doesn't sound so bad. A bit ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre""-ish, but that's never a bad thing. The acting is much better than the movie lets on though. Nearly all of the college students have natural sounding dialogue and the townsfolk from ""Madison County"" are fairly creepy as they should be. It's really only ruined by the old woman at the diner named Erma (Adrienne Harrell). It's as if she starts off decent enough, but has the Nicolas Cage effect and begins to get more and more over the top the more screen time she has.

There's actually quite a bit of build up before any sort of killing takes place. There's drama amongst James and his friends, but they spend a lot of time searching for David Randall as Erma tells them he moved away long ago and that Damien Yule doesn't exist. The acting is the only real surprise here though other than the attempt at some character development and slow build to any sort of blood being seen. Everything else is pretty stereotypical. The pig faced Damien Yule takes several pages out of Leatherface's book minus the chainsaw. Every one of the college kids is a walking cliche; James is the brave one, his buddy Will (Matt Mercer) is the nerd, Brooke (Joanna Sotomura) is the really feminine girl who doesn't do anything but cry, her friend Jenna (Natalie Scheetz) is the tomboy who actually puts up a fight, and Brooke's brother Kyle (Ace Marrero) is the brooding tough guy.

It's as if everything the movie did have going for it is thrown out the window once Damien Yule shows up. Then it's basically just your below par serial killer horror movie. Leading up to that point though is kind of fun. Pay particular attention to movement in the background. There's always something going on back there. The ending is really bizarre, too. It obviously has to leave enough room for a sequel. All horror movies do that, but this leaves things open while wrapping up another character's storyline and ending with this really awkward shot of Damien Yule done with music video-like editing.

""Madison County"" shows potential early on. Its cast is surprisingly decent and their acting is a few steps higher than you're probably expecting. There's this constant ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Wrong Turn"" kind of vibe the entire time. I'd even say there's a little bit of ""Wolf Creek"" in there, as well. But things go downhill fast; characters become more and more overused and familiar to what you've seen in the past, dialogue gets more ridiculous, and events unfold in unsatisfying ways. It leaves several unanswered questions up in the air. ""Madison County"" only ends up being a partial wasted effort overall.

The unrated DVD includes audio commentary with writer/producer/director Eric England, producer Daniel F. Dunn, and actor/producer Ace Marrero, the official trailer, and a Q&A at Screamfest.

""Madison County"" will only be available as an unrated DVD starting Tuesday, May 8th. The film is presented in a 2.35:1 widescreen aspect ratio, is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, and is only 82 minutes in length.",1336435200,2,4134,4.726768377253814

I just really wish there was more of the killer and more gore, I would love to see a Madison County 2 with a higher budget. The movie didn't invent anything new but not all movies have to do that to be enjoyable, give me a cool looking killer with good gore and kill scenes with descent acting and im all in.

The acting overall isn't as bad as you'd expect for a poorly made horror flick but that's about the best I can do for this. However, as is now the law with these cheapo horror movies, people who worked on the film go into Amazon and IMDB and leave glowing reviews - this one at this moment, has 9 reviews, 8 are people with one review - this one - (including one guy who at least admits he was in the film and one guy who admits his relative was in the film). 2 reviews are exactly the same (saw this, can't wait to tell my friends...can't wait? We live in the communication age. Why can't you tell your friends now? Ever heard of email? Texting? Did you have to write the fake review first before telling all your friends or do your friends live in a cave where their only communication is in person?).  I would love to see one of these bad movies with honest reviews from people who worked on it (""I was in it. I'm here in Amazon leaving a glowing review because I'm hoping to convince people to buy this. Can't wait to tell my friends!"").

I would love for there to be a sequel, I want to see Damien kick some more ass, and be even more brutal.  Nice job, cast & crew.",1336003200,2,389,3.9615384615384617
5063391,3,B0078TLRTY,"""He killed 33 people over the course of 2 decades and the townspeople didn't tell anyone."" When a group of college kids travel to the small town called Madison County in order to interview the author of a book about a serial killer from there they are surprised when the first people the meet are hostel and have no idea what they are talking about. When they begin to investigate further into the town they realize that the stories were true. As many of you know by now I am positive that there are only 3 movies that they keep remaking over and over and while I watch 3-5 a week it is hard to surprise me anymore. This one is no exception. Group of kids...strange town...slow moving masked killer...yada yada yada. I will however say that this one did actually keep me interested enough to keep watching. The movie itself was actually pretty tense and there really wasn't that many over-the-top cheesy parts that made me laugh. This is still just another ""slasher"" movie but it is much better then some of the recent ones I have seen. Nothing to rush out and see, but not that bad either. Overall, a surprisingly decent slasher movie that is much better then the recent entries. I give it a B-.",1335398400,7,1196,4.465753424657534
5063392,5,B0078TLRTY,Very solid horror film.  The editing is great and adds greatly to the movie. Several plot twists.  You will become heavily invested in the characters.  Great job. Can't wait to show my friends May 8th,1334620800,3,200,4.6571428571428575

8512371,1,B0078TLRTY,"Boring. Thin plot.  Lousy ending. I wasn't expecting  a lot from this film and that's good, because it lived up to my own expectations. Others here have described the plot. I won't go into that again. Even though I often enjoy low budget horror/slasher flicks, this one get me shaking my head. You get some idea of the supposed back story. You don't get any lead as to how the community goes along with the killings. The ending  leaves you frustrated by another midday stabbing in the middle of a parking lot. I guess I just expect a little more from low budget movies.",1405728000,,569,4.451923076923077

8512373,3,B0078TLRTY,"Well, that was completely unoriginal and predictable from start to finish.

Sigh.

Once again, a group of college kids are going out of town in order to research an upcoming paper, and once again the subject of that paper is the truth behind some local legend or other in which many people were slaughtered, and once again the legend turns out to be less legend and more fact and once again they're warned off by the locals and once again they don't listen and once again everyone dies and once again they all make the same stupid mistakes like splitting up and having the killer down and out then leaving without making darn sure he's dead as a doornail and once again he comes back to finish what he started and once again the college kids freak out, reacting as if they hadn't expected him to get back up, after all they hit him over the head with a shovel, surely that should do the trick, right?  And once again, and once again, and once again.

Don't young filmmakers get tired of making the same movie over and over?  God knows I get tired of seeing it.  The only reason I keep watching them is because hope springs eternal and I'm just waiting for that one movie that changes things, that tells me yes there is still life left in this genre, and here's what else we can do with it.

So far, I'm still waiting.

This time it's writer/director Eric England who obviously loves the horror genre, but also obviously doesn't have an original bone in his body--hopefully I'm wrong about that and MADISON COUNTY is just a case of working out the kinks.  It is his third movie, though, so maybe not.

The stars actually aren't bad, and try to do the best with the material they were given.  Colley Bailey (DONNER PASS) as James, the one with the paper to write, delivers a decent ""good guy"" performance, even if I felt his character was actually a little too good to be true.  Matt Mercer (ALIEN ENCOUNTER) and Ace Marrero (""General Hospital"") as Will and Kyle (the nerd and the dumb hothead) bring nothing new to their roles, but they also don't make a mess of them either, while the token two girls to three guys, Joanna Sotomura (""Emma Approved"") and Natalie Scheetz (""Siberia"") as Brooke and Jenna are both pretty but, ultimately, useless when it comes to advancing what little plot there is or even providing any real tension.  Jenna's showdown with the killer, Damien, had one single grizzly moment, but was otherwise a waste of time.  Here's a hint: if you have the killer's ax in your hand and he is unarmed, you take him the heck out.  That means a chop to the skull, the neck, even the chest.  His arm isn't going to insure you make it out of there alive.

Honestly, the characters here are so dumb it's as if they're living in a world that has never seen a slasher movie.  I'm not saying I would survive in a similar situation, but there are certain obviously dumb moves that you just don't make.  Don't split up, don't offer to traipse off through the unfamiliar woods alone because ""it'll be faster"", don't drop the weapon and run toward the sound of screams, don't drop the weapon because the killer appears to be unconscious, and if the creepy townsfolk keep telling you there's nothing to see here, don't run back into the diner after watching one of your friends getting slaughtered in the woods and expect to get help.  This isn't just horror movie 101, it's Life 101, man.  This is basic stuff that shouldn't take a college education to figure out.  And if these idiots are the kind of brain trusts our American colleges are turning out, there's a LOT of parents out there who need to demand a refund on that tuition.

On the bright side, while the plot to MADISON COUNTY is entirely dumb and predictable, it's not a bad looking movie.  The quality of the film is good, the production quality seems high enough--considering imdb says the budget for this was only $70,000.  The killer was plenty creepy--if, again, not exactly original--and the cast actually looked like they could, in fact, be of college age, which is a welcome change.

MADISON COUNTY wasn't a bad movie, it just wasn't particularly good.  It simply was.  I can find movies just like it without even trying.  And unfortunately that's just not good enough, and  this movie contains not one single thing to make it stand out from the crowd of countless movies with the exact same plot.  If you've never seen a movie where a paper-writing college student goes in search of a backwoods killer legend, this is as good a place to start as any, but if you've already seen one, then you've probably already seen this one as well.",1384128000,,4608,4.522316043425814
8512374,1,B0078TLRTY,"I could get mad, I could rant about how this flick rips off every cliche and classic slasher, but there's no point. This movie doesn't seem to care, so why should I? I can at the very least say that the crew making this seemed that they wanted to make a solid fun flick, and I'm sure they had fun making it, but honestly, this movie offers nothing fresh or creative. You can make a fun horror film that is unoriginal or more specifically a throwback or love letter to older films, but there's doing that right, and doing it wrong. This film does it wrong. So how does this film do it wrong?

1. Characters: My point of view on lead characters is usually that the characters only work if they're likable or interesting, especially in the horror genre. If you have likable characters, then the viewer will care for them when something bad happens to them. If they are unlikable, they must at the very least be interesting or entertaining to watch, so that even though the viewer may not care for the characters, they will be invested in the characters and hopefully the story that surrounds the characters. I will give credit that Colley Bailey who plays the lead in ""Madison County"" actually does a decent job acting and playing a somewhat likable and charismatic character. Unfortunately, the rest of the characters (both protagonists and antagonists) are either very annoying, boring, dull, or rip offs of much better characters from much better horror films (sorry Damien, you don't match Leatherface).

2. Scares: Something that's so great about the horror genre is that there's so many ways to scare a viewer. After all, there are so many things that people fear, and sometimes, a movie that's scary enough can take something that a viewer didn't originally find scary but when the movie's over find absolutely terrifying. So what does this movie have? Well, a lot of it's location is in the woods...something we've seen countless times in horror films. With that said, you can still in today's age come up with creepy and scary things to do in such a location with isolated and somewhat haunting atmosphere. Well, ""Madison County"" just recycles what we've seen in ""Friday the 13th"", ""Sleepaway Camp"", and ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". So what about jump scares? Predictable. What about gore and violence? Honestly, not terrible for the most part, but nothing impressive. What about creepy or intimidating characters? Imagine the family in the first two ""Chainsaw Massacre"" films, only toned down, uninteresting, and not really that intimidating in any way shape or form.

3. Story telling: This review's gone longer than it should so I'll keep this short. The story for the most part has a three act structure, but many scenes drag on too long, you already know who will and won't survive, and certain scenes felt misplaced.

Now with all of that said, and even though I'm giving this movie only one star, I honestly wouldn't mind checking out any future projects this crew may make, because even though I didn't enjoy this film in the least bit, there was a tiny shred of potential, and that potential can just possibly be made into something decent. But for now, I say skip this one.",1376265600,,3187,4.768115942028985
