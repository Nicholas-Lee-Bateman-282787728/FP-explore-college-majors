5381692,3,B00A4Y62HM,"Abismo de Pasin (Abyss of Passion - 892 minutes)

Be prepared for a LOT of gunfire, murders, drownings, infidelities, seductions, poisonings and suicide. One woman is buried alive, one is drowned, several are knocked around and we see really bad-tempered individuals yelling at people they hate.

The lovers featured this time are Elisa (Angelique Boyer) and Damin (David Zepeda), she is the daughter of a woman found dead in a car with his father. Rumor has it that those two were eloping. Actually, the saintly woman was trying to talk the fellow into going back to his family instead of running off with her own slutty sister, Carmina (Sabine Moussier).

Because Elisa and Damin had been childhood sweethearts, she is looking forward to his return from college, but he comes home engaged to Florencia (Altair Jarabo) and is very distant. We soon realize that their childhood letters had been intercepted and destroyed. Those early bonds can't be denied however and our couple is soon back in love.

One of my favorite characters is Padre Guadalupe (Ren Casados) who serves as a father figure for our youngsters.

We have an eternal triangle/quadrangle because even as children, their best friend and playmate Gael (Mark Tacher) has carried an unrequited torch for Elisa, while a fourth playmate Paloma (Livia Brito) has admired Gael from afar.

We soon swing into the musical chairs of ""Who's your daddy?"" as the lovers are thwarted at every turn, people are murdered, families seek revenge and the pepper-growing business is one everyone wants a piece of. There are a number of lively sub-plots which keeps things moving.

It was fun to see David Zepeda playing a lover this time instead of a villain, and Sabine Moussier has the most fun as a really BAD girl. This one has scenes of torture (bury a woman alive, for example) that are too prolonged, and guns figure in very heavily. This one is not one of my favorites.",1377216000,,1923,4.862385321100917

5381696,3,B00A4Y62HM,"i watched this novela on tv when it was on and was so hooked on it i was determined to buy it on dvd the day it came out so i can watch it whenever i wanted to! its such an amazing story and its so beautiful because thats where my family is from and ive been to yucatan so many times ive seen most of the buildings that have came out in the novela and even the under water pools (cenotes). however, the dvd isn't complete which really sucks. i didn't see the novela in the beginning and was so excited to finally see it but i realized it skipped a lot of the parts. i thought maybe it was just liked that in the beginning to get to the point but when i finally got to the part where i started watching it i realized that it did skip a lot of parts and it kinda didn't let it make sense it was like wait what didn't this just happen how did that happen? not cool. theres 4 discs that come for the dvd so i expected it all to be there but no it wasnt. i mean over all i loved the novela but for someone who hasn't seen it, it might be confusing. i put everything together because i saw the ending and remembered the parts that weren't shown.",1362700800,7,1139,3.892703862660944

5381698,4,B00A4Y62HM,"Estoy ansioso por que llegue el 26 de Febrero para Comprar y Tener este DVD. Abismo de Pasion Es Una de las Mejores Producciones del 2012. Exelente Telenovela y Magistrales Actuaciones. Me Encanta!!!
Espero que el DVD valga la pena y este bien resumido.
Review: Me Gusto Muchisimo el DVD. Contiene un Resumen con las partes ms importantes de la Telenovela.
Le faltan algunas escenas pero en gral la Edicin Es Muy Buena. Tiene bastante de todos los personajes, de los protagonistas y de los secundarios, eso me encanto porque en la mayoria de los resumenes quitan todas las historias secundarias aunque tengan nexo con los personajes principales.
Lo que si note, no se si es en el Disco que me toco a mi o es en todos pero la Escena del Final de Ingrid esta 2 veces, se repite la misma escena.
Me hubiera gustado que dejaran las peleas de Elisa con Florencia, pero las quitaron todas, no las tiene y la pelea de Elisa con Carmina esta cortada, falta la parte siguiente, que la verdad me quede con muchas ganas de volver a verla.
Compren el DVD, les aseguro que no se van a arrepentir, es una Exelente Telenovela, con un Muy Buen Elenco e Increible Historia.",1357516800,4,1156,4.535885167464115

8546759,4,B00A4Y62HM,"The main character suffers the stigma that her mother was running away with another woman's husband when they were both killed in an accident. People in her village and her own father wonder if she's inherited her mother's  ""loose"" character.

Her evil, scheming aunt married her father soon after he was widowed. She hates her niece.

The aunt can't stay away from other men in spite of her love for her husband. She manipulates people and causes trouble throughout the soap.

One of her lovers is a really bad guy who resents not having been born to money and is always looking for an opportunity to seduce another woman, but he is capable of murder.

The main character has 2 men, childhood friends, that love her, and she has to choose between them. Her best friend is in love with one of these young men.

The father of one young man was the one who was running away with her mother when they died in the accident. His widow can't stand her rival's daughter and will do anything to keep her son away from her, including scheming with his ex to get him to marry her with fake pregnancy.

From the start of the soap, we learn that it was actually her aunt who was going to run away with the married man. Her mother met the man to tell him not to abandon his wife and son for her sister, and they died in a car wreck.

The aunt let everyone believe her sister was running away with another man. She always loved her brother in law, and she takes advantage of his grief and anger to convince him to marry her, though she fools around with other men.

There is a lot going on in this soap, and it is really entertaining. I recommend it.",1475625600,,1636,4.302931596091205
