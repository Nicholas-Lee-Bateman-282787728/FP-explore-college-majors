7983645,2,B00008G87X,"""The Lost Episodes"" is a misnomer. Nothing on this single disc collection was ever ""missing."" An annoying PLATINUM DISC CORPORATION logo stays on-screen almost constantly.

Video of the Dick Powell TV vehicle ""Four Star Playhouse"" is clean; audio lacks high end. Mr. Bronson is a supporting player in this half-hour drama which was directed by Robert Aldrich (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WHAT-EVER-HAPPENED-TO-BABY-JANE/dp/B000EU1Q4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE?</a>).

Colors of the feature film LOLA are slightly faded; picture is a tad dark. Sound is way overmodulated and distorts frequently.

Image on the U.S. MARSHAL episode could be sharper; audio is again TOO LOUD. The opening theme sounds terrible.

Audio on the two MAN WITH A CAMERA examples is muffled; video is acceptable.

I paid under a buck for this item; worth it for a chance to see 4 TV shows and a movie that are new to me. Due to poor sound and that watermark, don't spend much more than that.",1278460800,,1039,5.509433962264151
7983646,2,B00008G87X,"I bought this for the 2 TV episode that were Empire Theater, while it was nice to see early Bronson TV roles, I don't like the pop up label logo on the feature & I found that distracting.

Lola or Twinky as it's is else where seem to be the same sad copy that is on so many of these dvds.

2 stars because it's early Bronson that seems impossible to get else where.",1255651200,,365,3.918918918918919
7983647,4,B00008G87X,"This is a rare and wonderful collection of Charles Bronson's early T.V. appearances. Starting with Fourstar playhouse (1952) and two Man with a Camera episodes from 1958/59. There is an episode of U.S Marshal (1959)which isn't great but Bronson outshines every one and is convincing as the menacing convict on the run. The film is Lola, quality is poor and it's more a curio for fans and not that great a movie. Still worth a look.",1252022400,7,431,4.684210526315789
7983648,3,B00008G87X,"If you're a Bronson fan, then you might like seeing these older movies too.  They are not equal in my opinion to the DEATH WISH series, but they are worth watching and having in your collection.  July 2009.",1247184000,3,206,4.394736842105263
7983649,3,B00008G87X,"The 4 half hour TV shows are in black in white without the original commercials. Print quality for these is very good. They are:
US Marshall Pursuit. Bronson is an AWOL army private on the run.
Four Star Playhouse. He's a man on trial for a crime he didn't commit.
Man With A camera. 2 episodes. Missing, where he looks for a mans wife & String Of Pearls, where he helps stop a con man.
The movie is Lola. 1:66 aspect ratio (letterbox with thin lines top & bottom of screen) & in color. Bronson is a writer in England in love with a 16 year old girl. A good movie but a used film print with some scratches here & there. The color is good and so is the sound.
I bought the DVD in a computer/video store & was not disappointed with the video/sound quality or the contents. In other words is was worth the $6 I spent and is a title I will keep in my collection.",1083801600,19,858,4.052941176470588
