8674120,5,B00MQVSD4Q,"A minimalist piece which is utterly compelling. I'm going to watch it again. It is most definitely NOT a zombie movie, but rather a study in interpersonal dynamics. Very sparse, very pure, very ""low budget, though that doesn't detract from its appeal at all. The acting was flawless: not once was there a hint of 'playing to the audience/camera'. Color and the subtle (and not so subtle!) makeup suited the mood perfectly. Cinematography might have been a bit better had they not used the Handi-cam so much and had lingered on a scene a little longer, or composed and framed the scenes with a bit more artistry.",1527379200,,611,4.719626168224299
8674121,1,B00MQVSD4Q,"I read a play by jean-paul called HUIS CLOS about a group of people stuck in a room for eternity. the problem being that they all irritated each other completely.

I assume this film is based on the satre play.

the play is irredeemably bad.",1459382400,,241,4.333333333333333
8674122,4,B00MQVSD4Q,"Intelligent, thoughtful, super low budget post-apocalypse film. Yes it's a 'zombie' movie, in that turning into zombies seems to be what's happened to almost everyone in the world  maybe everyone besides our 3 characters. But it's far from a horror film. It's much more a study of a love triangle, of 3 human beings, two men and one woman, living under tremendous stress.

While the film's scope is very limited (we basically never leave the small house the three have barricaded themselves inside), it remains visually interesting, and the claustrophobic qualities of the story are put to good use. The acting is also very solid, key for a film that is ultimately all about behavior. And I really appreciated the lack of exposition. The writer/director trusts his audience to piece together what's happened to both the larger world and our characters, instead of laying it out in lengthy dialogue, or flashbacks. We're simply there with them as their relationships continue to evolve. The film also isn't afraid of quiet moments, letting us ""get"" things from actors' faces and body language, instead of always using words.

It never quite transcends from 'interesting and engaging' to 'great'. There's not enough emotional or intellectual power for that. But I was happy to take what this unique little Argentinean film had to offer.",1417046400,,1334,5.082191780821918
