7995717,3,B0000A4GA3,"Peach makes a lot of sexy DVDs, and PEACH UNDERGROUND: HAWAII is pretty hot too, but it's not one of their best ones. As usual, it's got a group of very hot ladies in it, some of them exceptionally so. Part one of the DVD, running 30 to 40 minutes, consists of six of the girls on a beach, seductively stripping completely nude as the waves wash over them. A little humor is thrown in here, too, since some waves almost knock them down. New Age-type music runs in the background for these scenes, but for me it would have added to the realism to hear the live ocean sounds instead. One nice feature in this beach segment is the two different camera angles you can choose, one very close and one further back. The camera-work and picture quality of this beach segment are very good.

The second part of the show runs about 30 minutes and is at a strip club called Pipeline Cafe, where the Peach girls are in a contest for hottest babe. This segment is not as well done, but still pretty sexy since the girls are enthusiastic and often caress and play with each other. As each girl is introduced, some clips of their beach filming is shown, which is a nice addition. However, they don't do full strip-tease acts, and it's all rather ad hoc. It's disappointing that they just strip down to topless, and some don't even go that far. Also, the lighting and camera-work are not great here. The stage they're dancing on is absurd, too, with bars obscuring the view of them at times, and just small areas for them to dance on. So, this club segment is OK, but should have been better planned. The fact that the girls are so sexy and enthusiastic is what saves this segment from being a total mess.

For the special features, a ""behind the scenes"" segment doesn't add much and is just about 5 minutes, but there's a decent photo gallery and also some trailers for other Peach films. In sum, I like the beach segment of PEACH UNDERGROUND: HAWAII quite a lot and would give it 4 stars, but since the strip club segment is poorly done I feel like the DVD overall does not deserve more than a 3.",1180224000,9,2082,4.36340206185567
