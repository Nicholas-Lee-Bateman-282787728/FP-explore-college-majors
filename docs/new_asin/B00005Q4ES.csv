1645401,3,B00005Q4ES,"(...). It's got hardcore matches and bra and panties matches, but they should have had more matches and less storylines. But for 5 bucks, what do you expect.",1136160000,,157,4.642857142857143
1645402,5,B00005Q4ES,"I watched parts of this dvd, its the first half of 2001. 2001 was what I considering wrestlings best year but quickly died off. Some of the subjects I really didn't care for; The hardcore section was great! The extra matches are very good and a few of them are title changes! For this dvd under 4 bucks used, its worth the price.",1108512000,3,329,4.238095238095238
1645403,3,B00005Q4ES,"Ok I'm gonna shoot with you on this. Parts of this video are well done, while others are poorly done.

Subjects:

Hardcore Title: some good matches and some funny spots. Pretty good.

Bra & Panties: ok, this would have better if we could finish the match without interference. But fubby.

Mr. McMahon/Trish Stratus love angle: This was good. Good clips, great action.

Stone Cold gone Bad: This was a low point in Austins career. You knew in your heart he wasn't into it. This also introduced the catchphrase ""WHAAT??"". Some good clips/

Invasion: ok we start the invasion bbut don't finish it, Some good matches and angles.

Spike/Molly love angle: This was a wonderfully done storyline. It made you remember the olden days.

All in all, a good video, But instead of Action! It should have been best of Raw and Smackdown 2001.",1103587200,5,827,4.734265734265734
1645404,5,B00005Q4ES,"At last count, I own 25 DVD's issued by World Wrestling Entertainment.  None of them is more enjoyable to view than WWF Action!  Some experts would consider 2001 a low-point in wrestling history, but fueled by the heel turn of Stone Cold Steve Austin, it was one of my favorite years as a wrestling fan.  (Although, note that my *favorite* year as a fan was 1995; so pass judgment with that statement in mind.)
The program itself only chronicled the first half of the year, but it is captured in such an entertaining manner that I watch the program more often than its extras, which is a rare statement for me to make about a WWE DVD (as many of you collectors would probably agree).
The selection of extra features is unique, and as satisfactory as any compilation of seven matches would be.  I was pleased that the producers opted to include a couple full-length interview segments as well.",1052524800,8,892,4.591194968553459
1645405,5,B00005Q4ES,I purchased this DVD late last year and I have to say it is the best highlight tape WWE has put out in a long time (counting the Best of Raw series). It has tons of extras which is alsways a plus. And if you look closely during the Perry Saturn segment there is a match with the Dudley's and Saturn and Malenko.....it was in my hometown! I was there! anyways.......the DVD is very good and i recommend it to any fan of the WWE........,1034899200,,434,4.117647058823529
1645406,4,B00005Q4ES,"Action is a 75 minute documentry presented by Jonathan Coachman which covers all the major storylines of the first half of 2001. There are many cool video packages and loads of footage from Raw and Smackdown episodes from January - August 2001. If you are lucky enough to have a DVD player, the DVD is well worth purchasing as it has nearly two hours of extra footage, a great treat for any wrestling fan. I will run through each chapter on the disc and also the extras:
Main Feature:
Hardcore Action - A music opening plays introducing everyone to Action, and then Coach goes straight into the first chapter. Lots of hardcore footage here, from matches like Tazz vs. Raven and coverage of Rhynos hardcore title wins. Good opening chapter.
Under Where? - A short chapter with two full bra and panties women matches. It has Ivory vs. Trish from a Smackdown episode and Trish vs. Terri from Raw. Not too strong of a chapter, but not bad.
One...Two...Many - Long chapter which is entertaining nevertheless. It has lots and lots of footage of Perry Saturn where he kept getting bumps on the head which was turning him looney. Lots of covereage including the famous ""get the muffins"" spot, the double date with Terri/Perry and Dean Malenko and another woman, and Perrys obsession with a mop. Long but good.
Stratus - Faction - Another lengthly chapter with a good video package with all the Vince McMahon/Trish Stratus love angle coverage. It also talks about Trishs feud with Stephanie, along with No Way Out footage of their match. Very good once more.
Love Birds - Weak chapter to be honest. It packs in a lot of footage of the Molly/Spike love angle into five minutes, including the family feud along with when Molly went through a table and when they finally got to kiss. This just did not intrest me much to be honest.
Turn...Turn...Turn - Awesome chapter which opens up with a excellent video package of Stone Cold turning heel at Wrestlemania. It has footage of the Vince/Austin/Angle alliance with was very funny, and has lots more footage too. Good stuff.
I'm Up... I'm Down - All about Vinces troublesome year, including footage of when Torrie Wilson tricked him, when he got slapped by Debra and lots of stuff involving Austin too. Another very decent chapter.
Invasion! - Fitting finish to a compelling watch as it has lots of good Invasion footage when WCW/ECW Invaded the WWE, along with Austin turning yet again on the WWE, and Kurt Angle getting revenge on Stone Cold and the Alliance by beating Booker T in a superb match to win the WCW title. Very entertaining indeed.
DVD Extras (only on DVD version):
Wheres Old Stone Cold? - Vince/Austin interview around the time of Invasion. Pretty boring.
Booker T vs. Kurt Angle - Superb battle with lots of false finishes and interference. ***1/2
Triple H vs. Jeff Hardy - Decent outing with a very shocking ending. Good extra. **1/2
Chris Jericho vs. Triple H - Excellent bout with lots of false finishes and excitement. ***1/4
Edge, Christian and Rhyno vs. The Dudley Boyz - Sloppy six man, but the finish is awesome and very brutal. *3/4
Kurt Angle vs. Stone Cold - Thrilling technical exibition with an awful ending unfortuneatly. Still excellent battle. ****
Reeking of Kingdom - Very funny interview where Edge is crowned 2001 King of the Ring. Very funny stuff here.
Steel Cage Match - Rock and Austin put on a short yet good match with some great psycology. Good finish as well. ***1/2
Stone Cold vs. Chris Jericho - Decent at best match which could of been better. Mick Foley is special troubleshooting ref. **1/2
Need a Hug? - Shoddy interview which gets very boring quickly. Not good.
Alliance prepeares for... - Lasts just under a minute which means this is too short to be that brilliant.
Overall, excellent DVD. The extras are good, the program is strong and overall just very, very good to watch. I did not give it the perfect score of five stars cos some of the extras are shoddy and there are a few glitches in the program, but overall this is well worth a look, and even buying.
Overall Score - Four Stars (****) Go and Buy!",1030579200,7,4097,4.668049792531121
1645407,3,B00005Q4ES,"I am a collector of WWF/ECW DVDs, so I purchased this DVD not really knowing what I was getting.  What I recieved was a review of the first-half of '01, and although it is good, it is lacking alot of storylines.  The storylines the DVD does cover are the Hardcore title, Bra and Panties, Perry Saturn and Moppy, Trish Stratus, Spike and Molly, Steve Austin's heel-turn, and the WCW Invasion.  The thing that makes this DVD worthwhile are the extra matches and they are as followed.
Booker T-Kurt Angle
Triple H-Jeff Hardy
Chris Jericho-Triple H
Dudley Boyz and Spike-Edge, Christian and Rhyno
Kurt Angle-Steve Austin
The Rock-Steve Austin(Steel Cage match)
Steve Austin-Chris Jericho
  All of the matches are pretty good from Raw is War and Smackdown.  During the main feature there are also clips from Hardcore matches, Bra and Panties matches, and the WCW Invasion.  I would recommend this DVD to any fan of the WWF, but if you already know everything that happened in '01 I suggest you pick up a different DVD unless you want the matches.",1019260800,,1041,4.782122905027933
1645408,4,B00005Q4ES,"First, it should be stated, that I go out of my way to purchass every WWF and ECW DVD's (Non-PPVs) that I can. I am a Sports Entertainment Fan, thus when these DVDs are released, I like to see all my favorite storylines played out on these disks, so I can keep them in my library for safe keeping. I was amazed at how COOL this DVD actually was. The box leads you to believe that it is a cheaply released video with nothing of interest inside, don't be fooled - This disk covers the best storylines from the first half of 2001. Over an hour of cool montages and matches that cover things like, the Harcore division, Bra and Panties matches and Even Austins Wrestlemania Heel-Turn. Great mid-card storylines are covered involving Perry Saturn and Moppy, the Spike/Molly relationship and even a in-depth look at Trish Stratus' relationship with Vince McMahon - classic TV! The best part of this DVD though, is the coverage of the WCW Invasion! Showing the story from the beginings where people like Booker T and Mike Awesome were coming in and raising hell! Funny coverage of the Austin/Angle team-up as well. Very Cool Disk, and a must have for WWF fans. Oh, I forgot to mention that there is about 2 hours of extra matched crammed in as an DVD extra!",1001462400,11,1250,4.511013215859031
7949838,4,B00005Q4ES,"2001 was the last real great year of wrestling from start to finish. Reliving the WCW/ECW invasion was classic! Regardless of what die hard fans say about not having big stars like: Sting, Goldberg or other marquee names, it was still great seeing rivalries like: Stone Cold vs RVD, Booker T. vs The Rock, etc. Way too many to name. WWF began being way too comical at this point with: Perry Saturn leaving Terri Runnels for a mop, Stone Cold & Kurt Angle trying to win Vince McMahons respect by hugging him but still very entertaining nevertheless.",1521763200,,548,4.65979381443299

7949844,5,B00005Q4ES,"this pretty much follows wwf in 2001 it was good dvd, could of had some more matches in it or maybe some more moments instead of just skimmin through the year",1361664000,,158,4.129032258064516
7949845,3,B00005Q4ES,"In 2001, the WWE (then WWF) had a lot of stuff going on. Beginning in late 2000 when Vince McMahon bought both ECW and WCW, this DVD shows footage of the things that were going on during that time. The documentary only focuses on the first half 2001 and is hosted by Johnathan Coachman.

The program documents several feuds, storylines, certain character development, and clips from matches at the time. The program starts off by showing footage from the Hardcore division and clips from certain matches dealing with the Hardcore title and the 24/7 rule. The bra and panties match which leads to the arrangement between Trish & Mr. McMahon. Perry Saturn's ""brain damage"" & his obsession with ""moppy"". Mr. McMahon's marriage to Linda McMahon. The whole relationship between Spike Dudley & Molly Holly. Stone Cold turning on the fans and his relationship with Mr. McMahon & Kurt Angle after Wrestlemania. Austin attacking Jim Ross on Smackdown and turning heel. Ends with the Invasion storyline. Kurt Angle winning the WCW title. Stone Cold Steve Austin turning on the WWF at the Invasion ppv. And the big anticipated return of The Rock.

The Extra's contain seven very good matches from both RAW and Smackdown which are the highlights of the DVD. The matches are not in chronological order.

Smackdown July '01
WCW Championship
Kurt Angle vs. Booker T
This match was hosting from Kurt's hometown in Pittsburg, PA and a week after the Invasion ppv. It had a couple of good spots. A nice brawl on the outside. But the only real highlight is Angle winning the WCW title in his hometown. 4/5

Smackdown Apr. '01
Intercontinental Championship
Jeff Hardy vs. Triple H
This match happened a week after Triple H won the title from Chris Jericho. Hardy put up a very good fight against the game. Hardy was going full blast with his high risk daredevil style offense. A couple of good counters from Triple H. Ends with the ultimate upset with Hardy defeating the game and winning his first Intercontinental title. 3.75/5

Smackdown Apr. '01
Intercontinental Championship
Triple H w/ Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley vs. Chris Jericho
Probably a forgotten match in Triple H's and Jericho's past. This match happened on the same week right after Wrestlemania. Definately one of their better matches. But nothing compared as to their Last Man Standing Match a year earlier. Both performed very well in the ring. A very good match up right here. 4.25/5

Smackdown Mar. '01
The Dudley Boyz vs. Edge, Christian, & Rhyno
Average six man tag match. Happened a week after both Spike and Rhyno made their WWF debuts. Pretty good six man tag. But nothing really that great. 3.5/5

RAW Jan. '01
WWF Championship
Kurt Angle vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin
This match took place 2 weeks after that huge six man Hell in a Cell match from Armageddon. The match was just like what you expected from Angle and Austin later in the year. A lot of brawling on the outside and good wrestling in the ring. A key thing too in this match that there is no commercial breaks during this match. You get to see all of this match. Triple H would come out & screw Austin which would lead to Austin screwing Triple H in his title match at the Royal Rumble later in the month. The post match brawl between Austin and Triple H certainly added more. A darn good title match from RAW. Very worthy being on ppv. 4.75/5

RAW Apr. '01
Steel Cage Match for the WWF Championship
Stone Cold Steve Austin w/ Mr. McMahon vs. The Rock
Many people forget about this match between The Rock and Stone Cold. It happened night after Wrestlemania. It starts out on the outside where it got wild with the Rock opening up Stone Cold. The match had the same intensity once in the ring as it did from Wrestlemania. The only problem is the time that was given. Triple H comes out and forms the 2 man Power Trip with Austin and McMahon. 4/5

RAW June '01
WWF Championship
Chris Jericho vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin
Mick Foley was the special enforcer in this match. This match happened 3 weeks after Triple H got injured where Austin and Triple H lost the tag belts to Benoit & Jericho. The match was very good. Austin was in full heel mode here. Even throwing Jericho into Foley on the outside. A couple of very good counters. Possibably even better then their match at No Way Out a couple of months later. A very good match. I enjoyed this match very much. 4.5/5

The Extra's also contain promos from RAW and Smackdown where Mr. McMahon begging Austin for the ""Old Stone Cold"" a week before the Invasion ppv. Edge being awarded the King of the Ring trophy after winning the KOTR tournament with Christian having a twinge of jealousy. Kurt Angle and Stone Cold having a ""hug fight"" over Mr. McMahon. And the preparation from both the WWF and the Alliance for the returning Rock.

Overall I was happy with this DVD even though I felt some things they could've gone without such as Perry Saturn and his ""moppy"" character. And a little less involvment with Trish. But the thing that I didn't like was that we didn't get nothing from the Undertaker, Kane, or Chris Benoit who were very popular at the time. But anyways, since this DVD is 7 years old, I was happy with the product and is very easily to get cheap here on Amazon. I got mine for less then 10 bucks and was happily satisfied so I recommend on getting this.",1229385600,3,5337,4.613277133825079
7949846,3,B00005Q4ES,"In a nutshell, this DVD is structured the same way as the other WWF DVD releases at that time where in that it's just a look back at WWF feuds, storylines, and character developments.  In this case, the focus is on the first half of 2001 & is hosted by Johnathan Coachman.

The documentry starts off by discussing the hardcore division with highlights from various hardcore matches such as Big Show, Chris Jericho, and Rhino all winning the title at various times along with a Raven vs. Taz match that got out of control with wrestlers such as Steve Blackman & Hardcore Holly looking to cash in on the 24/7 rule.  Trish Stratus relationship with Mr. McMahon is looked at from them being at a ""soup kitchen"" on Christmas to her conflict with Stephanie to her getting her revenge on Vince at WrestleMania.  Trish was also the focus of the bra & panties segment that featured hergoing against Ivory & Terri with special appearences by Chyna & Perry Saturn.  Speaking of Saturn, his character development revolving around getting hit in the head too much to ""Moppy"" was showcased as well.  The big ""Romeo & Juliet"" love story between Spike Dudley & Molly Holly was covered as well.  The evolution of Steve Austin after WrestleMania X-7 was showcased in how Austin turned heel, attacked Jim Ross, and started becoming more comedic & emotional towards Vince McMahon.  While we're on the subject of Vince McMahon, his relationship with Linda McMahon, buying WCW, and his relationship with both Angle & Austin is covered.  The documentry comes to a close on the beginning of the Invasion angle as ECW came on the scene & merged with WCW, Steve Austin jumping ship to the Alliance, both teams preparing for The Rock's return, and Kurt Angle winning the WCW Title from Booker T close the documentry out.

The real highlight of this DVD are the bonus matches (eventhough they're not in order) included on here such as:

WCW Champion Booker T vs. Kurt Angle - This is from SmackDown the week after the Invasion PPV & was a just an average match with the highlight being Kurt Angle winning the WCW Championship.

Intercontinental Champion Triple H vs. Jeff Hardy - This match happened on SmackDown in mid-April.  The match went non-stop as Hardy was just using his quick ""daredevil"" offense in the opening minutes while Triple H was real intense throughout the match as well with the suprize being that Jeff Hardy winning the Intercontinental Title.

Intercontinental Champion Chris Jericho vs. Triple H - This happened the week before the previous match on SmackDown.  Just like the previous match as well, this was non-stop action that never slowed down.  You got just about as good of a performance you would expect from both men & it was a match I heavily enjoyed over their later WrestleMania encounter.  The end result was Triple H winning the Intercontinental Championship.

Edge, Christian, Rhino vs. Dudley Boyz & Spike Dudley - This happened around 2 weeks before WrestleMania on SmackDown after both Spike Dudley & Rhino made their debut on RAW earlier in the week.  This was just a quick average six man tag match here.

WWF Champion Kurt Angle vs. Steve Austin - This match was from RAW in early Jan.  Just like any match involving Austin & Angle, you got exactly what you expected.  Wild opening minutes of the match with brawling on the outside & though in the crowd before settling in a good back & forth wrestling match in the ring.  The ending involving Triple H set up what would happen during Triple H's title match at the Royal Rumble later in the month.

Steel Cage Match: WWF Champion Steve Austin vs. The Rock - A ""forgotten"" match in their historic feud as this match happened the night after WrestleMania on RAW.  The match kicked off with a wild brawl outside the ring where Austin got busted open right off the bat.  When they got back into the ring, the match was just as you would expect from these two in the based off their previous encounters as well with the only downfall being that they didn't have as much time as their PPV matches.  In the end, Triple H & Vince McMahon got involved in beating down The Rock.

WWF Champion Steve Austin vs. Chris Jericho - This match happened in early June on RAW.  The match itself was real good & I enjoyed it better than their later No Way Out PPV match as Jericho & Austin put in a main event worthy performance.  The other story behind this match was Mick Foley making himself the special outside referee & he got involved various times leading to problems with him & Commissioner Regal towards the end of the match.

Other DVD extras include Vince begging for the ""old Stone Cold"" to lead Team WWF into the main event at the Invasion PPV, Edge awarded the King Of The Ring trophy with the continued tease of jealous by Christian, Austin & Angle having a ""hug fight"" with Vince McMahon, and a short 1 min. highlight of both the WWF & The Alliance preparing for The Rock's return on RAW.

In the end, I felt like the documentry could have left out some subjects (bra & panties, Perry Saturn) for others (nothing surrounding Undertaker, Triple H, Chris Benoit or lack of coverage for The Rock & Kurt Angle).  However, the matches save this from being something I wouldn't watch more than once every few months.  Since this DVD is over 6 years old, you can find it used for real cheap (I got it for less than $5) so on that basis, I recommend.",1206403200,6,5403,4.6054279749478075
7949847,4,B00005Q4ES,"For the people like me, watching WWE these days is disillusioning.  This DVD is a nice piece of nostalgia from early to mid 2001, the final days of the last great WWF storylines.

Like the ""Best of Raw vol 1+2"" collection, it's a video narrated by non-kayfabe Johnathan Coachman recounting the events from January to July 2001 in the WWF, from the continuing exploits of the Hardcore division, to the main eventers, to the antics of Vince McMahon and his relationships with Stephanie and Trish Stratus, all the way until the Invasion storyline.

The special features aren't too bad, but they aren't great.  Two of the features accidentally give you blatantly obvious instances of a move missing a wrestler, while the wrestler sells the blown move (example, a leg drop on The Rock completely misses his head--he sells.  A stomp on Chris Jericho slips and misses--he sells).

It's a pretty decent buy, but not for too much.",1181779200,2,921,4.834394904458598
