1362934,5,B00004W5TJ,"A different take on the story, not as ""cutsie"" as the one from the 1940's, which I dearly love, but this one has a darker take on how it feels to be a ghost and what descendants must do to release the spirit. I thoroughly enjoyed it, am always happy to see Patrick Stewart, a great actor. As it is a little on the dark side, parents might want to watch it first to determine if little ones should also watch it.",1487808000,2,411,4.024390243902439

1362970,5,B00004W5TJ,Great remake of a timeless classic..  The Omney's were a good touch in some great dry humor. Neve Campbell made a seasoned performance for a young actress.,1396396800,,155,4.7407407407407405
1362971,5,B00004W5TJ,"I love this re-make, Stewart makes a wonderful Sir Simon of Canterville, a lot of folks are purist and will assume any remake is awful. We will have to agree to disagree. I like that Sir Simon is no longer a weenie.. :)",1396051200,,219,4.116279069767442
1362972,5,B00004W5TJ,"I bought this movie primarily because Patrick Stewart (Star Trek Gen) was performing the Ghost part. Sir Patrick Steward is an excellent actor, not only in Star Trek but also on the stage for Hamlet, etc. Very versatile actor.",1394236800,,226,4.82051282051282

They're great, humor-wise as well as dramatically.  Come enjoy the fun and mild adventure -- it's for the entire family and well worth watching -- I've viewed it twice with two groups of friends, and had to quietly sit on my enthusiasm, so as not to give away any of the fun...",1390348800,,465,4.213483146067416
1362976,5,B00004W5TJ,"""Canterville Ghost"" is a wonderful, family-friendly movie.  Patrick Stewart and Neve Campbell are fantastic in their roles, as one would expect.  Based on a short story by Oscar Wilde, ""Canterville Ghost"" has had several adaptations.  This particular version is my favorite.  Sir Simon Canterville (Patrick Stewart) is a tormented soul.  He is also quite dead, trapped in Canterville Hall these past 300 years by a curse.  When an American family comes to stay, Sir Simon tries every ghostly trick in his arsenal to drive them away, but to no avail.  The children are the only ones who can actually see him, and the parents think Sir Simon's antics are actually childish pranks.  When Ginny (Neve Campbell) gets blamed for scaring her little brothers, she has had enough.  She stalks the secret passages in search of the real culprit.  Friendship blossoms between the troubled ghost and troubled teen, and the two set out to secure the redemption that will free Sir Simon from his ghostly prison.
""Canterville Ghost"" is a wonderful tale.  Sure, it can be a bit campy in the telling, but it is an ageless story of love and anger, loss and redemption.  This particular version captures equally the humor and the angst of Wild's story.  Patrick Stewart brings Sir Simon to life, while anyone who suffered the growing pains of the teenage years or had siblings will recognize a bit of themselves in Neve Campbell's Ginny.  It is well worth 92 minutes of your time.",1389398400,5,1460,4.8582995951417

1362979,1,B00004W5TJ,"I was really hoping for a good movie to watch with my students after we have read the short story by Oscar Wilde. What have they done to this great piece of art?? How can anyone turn such a cute story into THIS?
I was horrified!
I don't think that the acting is as bad as other reviewers have posted, but I was shocked about the storyline! I haven't seen anything that cheesy since a certain vampire movie - well, the Canterville Ghost is even worse!
Please don't watch it! Read the short story by Oscar Wilde- it's really good!",1385510400,,528,4.29

1362987,4,B00004W5TJ,"Obviously made for television, this movie is really a good, no frills, no cursing, no fear, family fare. A young teenage girl dragged to England far from her friends and pastimes struggles with the situation while her younger brother is quite fascinated by the knights' armor, the castle, and all the medieval accoutrements that surround them. The two quickly become allies when the ghost begins to visit and they are the only ones who can see him. But he's a tortured ghost, tired, lonely, and has much in common with the girl.

1362995,4,B00004W5TJ,"Based on a short story by Oscar Wilde which has been frequently adapted for stage and screen, this rendition from 1995 is reasonably faithful to the original. Neve Campbell ranks well against my favorite actress in the part (Alyssa Milano), but Patrick Stewart can't hold a candle to Sir John Gielgud (who played opposite Alyssa Milano). A 1944 version (starring Charles Laughton) has Allied soldiers bivouaced at the home and departs significantly from the original story. Other films are more or less faithful to the story. This movie is fun family entertainment as long as adults are present and willing to answer questions from younger viewers",1358899200,,647,5.113207547169812
1362996,5,B00004W5TJ,"The interweaving of Shakespeare's words (marvelously articulated by Patrick Stewart, who clearly shows his background in classic theater) and the situation of the ghost was wonderful.  And the kids loved it (despite being scary at first).",1358640000,,238,5.611111111111111

1363013,4,B00004W5TJ,"Very much a family movie, with a teenage girl in one of the two main roles. Neve Campbell plays Virginia (Ginny) Otis, an American girl who has come to England against her will because her physicist father has gotten an important position in a research institute there. He rented the ancient Canterville Hall because it was surprisingly cheap. Why? Because it is haunted, of course. But I can't see why that's a problem: it's haunted by Patrick Stewart playing Sir Simon de Canterville, although at one point he plays Hamlet's father.

As the story unfolds, we learn that Sir Simon was doomed to haunt, and never get any sleep, because he went mad with jealousy and drove his wife to suicide. But there's a prophecy which Virginia can fulfill.

Two sub-plots keep the interest up. Ginny's physicist father cannot believe in ghosts, and so assumes Ginny is playing tricks when Sir Simon does anything. I'm quite the skeptic myself, so I had sympathy for her father. But of course the story (which is, after all, an Oscar Wilde fiction) requires suspension of disbelief.

The other sub-plot is the young Francis, Duke of Cheshire (Daniel Betts), who lives next door. Of course he and Virginia are fated to fall in love.",1336694400,,1217,4.785714285714286
1363014,5,B00004W5TJ,I have loved Patrick Stewart forever. What ever he acts in he gives it a 100% as he does in this. He makes the ghost seem so real and the pain he feels you feel. This movie is a family movie for children 8 and older. Younger children may become scared in some sences. I would recommend it to everyone who loves ghostly movies but most of all those who cherish a good love story....,1333929600,,381,4.093333333333334

1363017,5,B00004W5TJ,"My husband and I viewed the Canterville Ghost during Christmas break. It is based on an Oscar Wilde story, and both of us like Oscar Wilde. We also quite liked Patrick Stewart as the ghost. Toward the middle and end of the movie as the young girl began to focus more on the ghost and his issues and less on herself and her self-made misery, the movie was much better. I must admit I had no sympathy for her self-imposed misery of not being able to see and be with her U.S. friends.",1328227200,,481,4.182795698924731
1363028,4,B00004W5TJ,Patrick Stewart and Neve Campbell star in this charming version of the Canterville Ghost.  Stewart is Simon de Canterville the resident ghost of this castle in England.  Neve Campbell is with her family who is leasing the castle when strange things happen.  Her father doubts that she actually sees the ghost.  Simon de Canterville makes his nightly haunting of the castle and makes people who stay in the castle leave.  his story is very sad and so he must make his hauntings nightly for his pentance.  Campbell helps the ghost and herself along the way.  This is the VERY BASIC plot for the story.  It is very family friendly and charming as well.  Highly Recommended!,1325548800,,670,4.756521739130434
1363029,5,B00004W5TJ,"This is my favorite screen adaptation of The Canterville Ghost, and I was so happy to share this lovely, heartwarming movie with my daughter. Part of what makes this adaptation work is the excellent casting. Patrick Stewart plays the tormented ghost, Sir Simon de Canterville, who is cursed to haunt his ancestral home due to a centuries' old sin. Neve Campbell is credible and convincing as teenager Ginny Otis who is initially reluctant and upset at her family's move from the US to England (due her scientist dad's work). When Ginny and her younger brothers see the ghost, her dad thinks Ginny is putting on an act to show her disapproval at having to move. Ginny's dad doesn't believe in ghosts, and attributes the strange occurrences in the family home to rational explanations.

Meanwhile, Sir Simon tries to scare the family into moving out of the home, but faces tough opponents in Ginny and the boys. The tale of how Ginny slowly gains the trust and confidence of Sir Simon and discovers his tragic past is well-told. There is humor in this story, as well as poignant scenes, and Patrick Stewart shines as the lonely, cursed ghost who longs for peace, forgiveness, and a long-deserved rest. This is a wonderful, family-friendly movie and the 'scary' scenes (depicting Sir Simon's attempts to scare the family members) are tastefully done and never truly scary or over the top. Highly recommended.",1310342400,2,1405,4.9033613445378155

1363031,5,B00004W5TJ,"I longed for a good ghost movie, there was the old version of the canterville ghost, but we needed something up to date for a new generation, this is it.

A delightful way to spend a stormy night. There are a lot of lightening flashes as an American family discovers what can happen in an old haunted castle on a dark and stormy night in the English countryside.

The Dad gets a job in England and the teenage daughter, Ginny, hates the idea of leaving friends and familiarity to travel to old England. Mom and her two younger brothers are enjoying themselves and trying to keep peace between Dad and Ginny.

They should have been forewarned, the owners were too eager to rent the castle and even warned them, but Dad doesn't believe in ghosts.

When Ginny starts experiencing strange occurrences in the old mansion she has something to do besides feel sorry for herself as she goes to explore and find out why this totured ghost cannot rest.

This is a Beautiful story of faith, love, family ties, and neighborliness as the neighbor boy tries to hide the fact that he is the Duke of Cheshire, he enters the mix and tries to comfort Ginny when her father won't believe her, thinking she is making this all up for her own benefit.

The ghost of Canterville too has his part to play in bringing the family closer together anf teaching Ginny that its alright to face your fears and open your heart.

Hope you enjoy this on Halloween night. Perfect for all ages, an excellent family movie.

1363035,5,B00004W5TJ,"It seems that any newer version of a movie will be measured against an older version; I suppose we do that without really thinking about it. Well I have done that with this movie and compared it to the 1944 version starring Charles Laughton. That version is the one that comes to mind when I hear the title.

I'm a real fan of Patrick Stewart and enjoy watching him work, but this version of the Canterville Ghost has to come in a close second to the Charles Laughton version in my opinion. I'm glad to have it and enjoyed watching it; if you have never seen the Charles Laughton version then you won't be spoiled by the memory.

In all fairness, I believe my memories of the II World War and the sacrifices and dedication of all Americans involved in the war effort greatly influence my perspective on the 1944 version. My wife and I watched this version of the movie last night and she commented that she thought this version was much better than the 1944 version.

This is a touching version and Patrick Stewart does a compelling job as Sir Simon de Canterville.",1271894400,5,1065,4.4512820512820515
1363036,4,B00004W5TJ,"Oscar Wilde's humorous novelette has been adapted to video a good half-dozen times, and while this is the only version I've seen so far, it seems like a good choice.  The Otis family--American physicist Hiram (Edward Wiley), his wife Lucille (Cherie Lunghi), teenage daughter Virginia (Neve Campbell), and sons Washington (Raymond Pickard) and Adam (Ciaran Fitzgerald)--move into Canterville Castle for a temporary stay while Hiram is in England on a research fellowship.  They soon discover that the Umneys, butler and housekeeper (Donald Sinden, Joan Sims), are hinting rather broadly about strange happenings in the house.  And when a strange man appears in Ginny's bedroom and puts his hand on her shoulder, the three youngsters, at least, begin to believe in it.  But Hiram, as you might expect a physicist to be, is a pragmatist who refuses to accept the possibility of a ghost, even when Lord Canterville (Leslie Phillips) supports the concept.  He even begins to blame the discontented Ginny, who didn't want to leave her friends and come to England, for the ghost's doings.  Unexpectedly Ginny actually confronts the ghost--Elizabethan relic Sir Simon deCanterville (Patrick Stewart)--and a strange friendship is formed.  Before long she undertakes to break the curse that has shackled him to the castle for 400 years--at risk of her own life and sanity.

The best part of this adaptation is Stewart, who, perhaps because of his stage background and 27 years with England's Royal Shakespeare Company, makes a very convincing Elizabethan ghost.  The script doesn't exactly follow the original--Wilde gave Ginny an *older* brother named Washington and younger twin ones, and described Otis as ""the American minister""--but it happily expands upon it by making Sir Simon's killing of his wife a tragic error rather than an act of chauvanistic rage, and by adding a sequence in which Ginny and Sir Simon attempt to win Hiram over to belief by enacting the rampart scene between Hamlet and his father's ghost.  Although there are a couple of scary bits, nothing in the movie (originally broadcast on TV in 1996) is too intense for grade-schoolers, and there's even a whisper of romance between Ginny and the young Duke of Cheshire (FRancis Betts), whose estate adjoins the Canterviklles'.

Neve Campbell is also good in her roll although her character (Virginia) is not very likable at first.  There is some cheese to be sure but overall is entertaining and has a good moral tone.  Probably not for die hard fans of Wilde and the original story but a good film to have.

Neve Campbell look sweet and innocent as Ginny the teenage girl from Indiana who sets him free and in this telling snags a neighboring Duke as a beau along the way.  The  supporting parts are believably cast and acted as well.  This is a beautiful production which appears to have been filmed on location in a British manor house.

It's just scary enough to give an appreciated shock or two, but not so much that you can't sit down with your 8-12 year old and have a family movie night.  My 18 and 19 year olds enjoyed it.
In the beginning when the ghost has decided he must rid the hall and himself of the ""Ameri-cans"", it seems a little silly the way he goes about it.  Later however, once he's come to accept the family and has begun to think of the daughter as a friend, the moments between them are touching.
The blossoming relationship between the girl and the young duke was tastfully done without the crap that usually accompanies scenes with young lovers.
The father's attitude toward the daughter was more like a step-relationship than an otherwise loving father who doesn't know haw to deal with his eldest child becoming a young woman.

So, after doing some searches on different versions of this movie, I decided on this particular version-- since Patrick Stewart is definitely one of my favorite actors.

He really doesn't disappoint here. He's excellent, as expected, and brings depth and empathy to the role of the Canterville Ghost.

However, everyone else in this production is more than bad. They are horrid.

Neve Campbell, in particular, can't act.  She's a one-note actress and I'm surprised that nobody has told her to go take some acting lessons.  She does this great tentative, unsure-of-herself, little girl smile thing, then she stops smiling (as if she's not sure a smile is appropriate), then she'll smile again-- just a bit.  UGH! Talk about annoying. Maybe this was a good thing for that character she played on the tv show, but it's not good in feature films and it's not good if that's all you see her do.  And, it is.  I've seen her in a few other films, and she plays every single role the same way. Have you ever seen her break into a wide grin? Give a hearty laugh (a guffaw, even?)? No-- because she can't act. She can only shyly smile, stop smiling, give a hint of another smile, lick her lips tentatively, and repeat.

So, because she has so much on-screen camera time, I can't give this film too many stars. And, because there are other people who also can't act in this film, I can't give the film too many stars.

The little brothers were alright- not too cute, but cute enough. They didn't have big roles, however.  The father was horrible!  If not exactly a one-note actor, he's a two note actor, maybe.  He wasn't given a great script, granted, but he delivered his lines fairly flatly. Yes, he was ""angry"" when he delivered the lines, but not with depth.  And, at one point, he had to kneel and cry into his wife's body. Oh, he didn't pull that off well, at all.

The script was terrible. Yes, Sir Canterville's dialogue was perfectly fine. But the story line for the rest of the film was asinine.  The kids can see the ghost. The parents can't and the dad thinks the daughter is making it all up so that they can leave England (she's just a sullen hormonal teen, I suppose).  So, the kids are being haunted and the father is increasingly angry at the daughter, unfairly.  Finally, the daughter has the 'ingenious' idea that will force her father to be able to see the ghost, too.  This works, but also has some consequences.  That's the story-- which would be okay, if they had some actors that could act.

That's what really bothered me about this movie.  There are so many actors out there who need jobs and can act. Why use these actors? Why use the dad and Neve Campbell when there are tons of good quality actors who would love to do these roles? It's not as if actors are in short supply!

Can Patrick Stewart carry the title role as well as or better than Charles Laughton or John Gielgud?

YES!

The role requires the Ghost to be a Shakespearean and Stewart is a natural as the ghost of Sir Simon de Canterville, and Elizabethan Lord caught in limbo, ever regretting the involuntary manslaughter of his beloved.

Of course, the ghost encounters a modern American tenant of his manor.  The daughter and her brothers discover that Sir Simon is more bluster than horror and set out to lift the curse.

Good supporting cast overcomes so-so production values.  Good on-site locale helps.

A great follow-on to this DVD would be the classic 1930's campy drama 'The Ghost Goes West,' where a US grocery magnate buys a Scottish castle--with ghost, of course.

We had downloaded the movie with a vague expectation of an updated version of the Charles Laughton original. Understanding that there'd be the inevitable changes to accommodate modern sensibilities I was nonetheless appalled at how bad it was. Truly the only life in this picture was with the ghost!

1363083,4,B00004W5TJ,"This is a classic story in true Oscar Wilde wit and flair.  It's both hautning and funny.  It's a fairy tale for all ages.  In this story a young American girl helps to free the tormented spirit that haunts an old English castle.  It's very well written and a beautiful tale for all ages.

Let me start by saying I LOVE Oscar Wilde. I LOVE his work. Love it. I've even pre-ordered the British DVD of Dorian Gray with Ben Barnes since it never had a US release and I trained my computer to be able to play region 2 DVDs. I know it's not very faithful to the books but it has to be better than the 2006 version that was badly acted and made Basil a woman and set it in the 1960s.

My two favourite works by Oscar Wilde are The Picture of Dorian Gray and the novella, The Canterville Ghost.

The plot of The Canterville Ghost is pretty straight forward. A very theatrical old ghost haunts a castle in rural England. Turns out he murdered his wife so he was starved to death and cursed. An American family moves into the castle and the story becomes a funny spoof of British propriety and American commercialism as the American family annoys the Hell out of the ghost trying to scare them away.
The ghost ends up befriending the teenage daughter of the family, fifteen-year-old, Virginia Otis. A prophecy is discovered:

'When a gentle girl can win
Prayer from out the lips of sin,
When a child gives up tears
And the barren almond bears,
When the silent chapel bell
Sounds the ghostly sinner's knell
Then shall the house be still
And peace shall come to Canterville.'

And needless to say Virginia helps the ghost, Sir Simon de Canterville, to move on. There's also a sweet little subplot where she ends up with the young duke whom lives near by. This subplot is expanded in the 1996 film adaptation. Many films leave it out all together. It's a simple story and very sweet though I do actually feel Patrick Stewart's version is a lot more sympathetic than his own book counter part whom at points didn't seem to regret killing his wife at all really and was a bit petty too. Though I do still love the book I ust feel Patrick Stewart added something to the character of Sir Simon de Cantervllle that originally wasn't there.",1188172800,2,2222,4.41320293398533

This is probably the best adaptation of the story you are liable to see.

My least favourite version of The Canterville Ghost is the 1940s movie version which made it about an American soldier having to prove his bravery by killing a Nazi. That had nothing, and I mean NOTHING, to do with the original story. Even the ghost's cause of death was drastically changed for this so-called comedy (it was the bleakest version I had ever seen). They had the poor ghost (when he was alive) walled up for refusing to fight in a duel that was originally intended for his brother but the brother was hurt and couldn't fight. Since the ghost 'died a coward' his American descendant had to 'prove his bravery' by killing a Nazi. The ghost even begs the father that killed him for this 'cowardice' for forgiveness. This is awful! I HATE that version of The Canterville Ghost. How is it the forties version of The Picture of Dorian Gray was so true to the novel but The Canterville Ghost had nothing to do with it's book? They even added a Shirley Temple style little girl. The Otis family and fifteen-year-old Virginia were not existent in this version. A seven or eight year old girl owns a castle ...for some reason and American soldiers are staying it. One soldier happens to be related to the 'cowardly' ghost and he has to prove himself against Nazi for the ghost to move on. I can't wrap my mind around why this ghost would need to be forgiven for being starved to death for refusing to fight in a duel that was not his own. What the Hell!? It was pretty much all World War 2 propaganda. Oscar Wilde would have been rolling over in his grave, especially considering his original novella was written decades before the first World War and had nothing to do with soldiers or Nazis. If this film had just been retitled with a new name for the ghost I would not have even guessed it was an adaptation of The Canterville Ghost by Oscar Wilde.

Now for my favourite film version of The Canterville Ghost:

My favourite adaptation of The Canterville Ghost is the 1996 movie with Neve Campbell as Virginia Otis and Patrick Stewart as the ghost. I actually like this incarnation of the ghost more than the version in the actual book though I LOATHE Virginia's obnoxious father in this film adaptation. His character was over the top annoying. This, in my opinion, is the best film version of The Canterville Ghost. If you haven't seen it, it sells for about six dollars on amazon or you can find it on youtube broken into six parts as Patrick Stewart as a ghost (with a subsequent number after each piece). This version is modernized but The Canterville Ghost lends itself well to modernization.

This is definitely the best version of The Canterville Ghost you are liable to see.",1188172800,3,4987,4.490066225165563

The story is very melodramatic at times, with more than just a touch of ""after school special"" feel about it in Virginia's clash with her father and step-mother.

1363099,5,B00004W5TJ,I belive this is a remake of an older movie of the same title and I think the story line may have been cahnged but it is well down and a I enjoyed it very much.,1168819200,3,160,3.4722222222222223

1363101,5,B00004W5TJ,This is extremly well done. the scenery shots are magnificent. The story is a wonderful variation on several old ghost/haunting stories combined with a new twist.  Great family film.,1168300800,18,182,5.275862068965517
1363102,5,B00004W5TJ,"I have seen a couple of other versions of The Canterville Ghost, but neither of the two can TOUCH this version with Patrick Stewart. As one who started in and loves Shakespearean acting, Patrick Stewart lends to the Ghost a sorrow-filled, yet hopeful mood... Choose this one of any version out there. You WON'T be disappointed!",1157673600,5,327,4.857142857142857
1363103,5,B00004W5TJ,Patrick Stewart's portrayal of the ghost was delightful and poignant and he wove into his role some Shakespeare which added depth.  Neve Campbell was also exceptional as the young child who believed and shed her tears for the ghost's release.,1048982400,15,242,5.05
1363104,5,B00004W5TJ,This movie is Wonderful! I love it! I am a huge Neve Campbell fan! She makes a great performance! It is a good film.,1013904000,5,116,3.875
1363105,5,B00004W5TJ,"This is the kind of movie that my mother likes to watch, so I assumed the usual- a cheesy family film that would have silly plots and poor acting, BUT this movie doesn't fit that mold. I was amazed at how much I enjoyed it. Sure, it still has the cheesy family-oriented subplots (I thought the whole ""rational explanation"" bit was a little overplayed), but overall it's a very cool story and the acting was VERY good. Patrick Stewart was excellent, projecting just the right amounts of kindness and woe (alongside his mischevious midnight hauntings), Neve Campbell was very good (as usual) and I am now a very big Daniel Betts fan (too bad he hasn't done very many movies). It's a feel-good story- I highly recommend this movie!",982195200,7,728,4.651162790697675
1363106,5,B00004W5TJ,"Patrick Stewart does his usual stellar job of taking what could otherwise be an indifferent film, with really kindof a sappy script, and turning it into pure art.  The breadth and depth of his talent amazes me ceaselessly, and in this vehicle he travels easily from the roar you could hear in the nosebleed seats at the back of the theatre, to moments of incredible intensity and intimacy.  It's a sweet story, once you get past the almost inevitable Hallmark family interaction formulae; truth be told, I found myself moved nearly to tears more than once, and all because of Patrick Stewart's performance.
See this movie if for no other reason; it's reason enough.",979171200,8,665,4.824561403508772

7924948,3,B00004W5TJ,"Cute story. I didn't read the novella, but I can't help but feel the movie portrayed the only ""villain"" as an unfair, angry scientist, who was also the only unbeliever in the whole story. I like to read between the lines for deeper messages and meanings when I watch movies. I can't really help it, and that's what this movie felt like for me. A story about the compassion of those with faith, and the emptiness and darkness of those who reject it. Perhaps the book is different, but I would not want my child to watch this movie and be taught people of science and unbelievers don't learn compassion and empathy without faith. There's mountains of evidence that show the contrary, actually.",1526169600,,691,4.626016260162602
7924949,4,B00004W5TJ,"Stewart was born for this role. Unfortunately, the time spent on Sir Simon's/Stewart's 15th century acting showcase took up so much time, the ending seemed rushed.",1525564800,,163,5.3076923076923075
7924950,5,B00004W5TJ,"I usually do not like or appreciate remakes but this one is different the story is timeless the casting was perfectly believable.  I am a fan of old time movies they made this in 1944 with Charles Laughton as the ghost and remember my father making a point to watch it whenever it came on TV.
I'm glad they remade it and did such a great  job at it.",1525305600,,349,4.043478260869565

7924954,3,B00004W5TJ,"A schlocky made for TV movie with average production and script..  The story is predicatable but cute and family oriented, and suitable if you're looking for some light, mindless entertainment.  It's hard to believe that Patrick Stewart is in this; He is wonderful and is the best part of the movie.",1524700800,,299,4.8431372549019605
7924955,4,B00004W5TJ,"The majority of the movie was rather good, and I enjoyed the plot as well as the acting. Then came the ""turning point"" of the movie and it was like they ran out of money or the script writer ran out of steam. Even the acting got super campy at that point. I am not sure what happened. Sad, really, because with just a few adjustment it could have been stellar. Still, it is worth a watch, if nothing else but to see Patrick Stewart speaking in Ye Olde English and quoting Shakespeare.",1524355200,,484,4.21505376344086
