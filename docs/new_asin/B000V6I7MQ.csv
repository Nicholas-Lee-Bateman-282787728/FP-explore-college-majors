8216701,4,B000V6I7MQ,"In the last 7 months, I have become a collector of Daddy Yankee material. I purchase the concert dvds because I will never get to see him in concert, in my area. I purchased this dvd with the hopes it would be a newer concert, but this concert was filmed in the Dominican Republic during the massive worldwide tour in 2005. I always enjoy his performances, and this time was no exception. He was electrifying and he had total command of his audience! Thoroughly enjoyable! The only problem with this dvd is the video could be better. The audio is okay, by  the video itself is kind of fuzzy. If you like Daddy Yankee and are a collector, get this.",1321228800,2,647,4.391666666666667
