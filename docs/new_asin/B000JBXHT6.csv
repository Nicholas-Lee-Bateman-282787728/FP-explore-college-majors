8149674,2,B000JBXHT6,"I wanted to like this movie, i really did. It has a wonderful story line and I like mira sorvino as an italinan-american actress. However, with bad lighting, bad audio, cheap film stock and terribly stiff acting this potentially great italian-american movie falls victim to a rock bottom low budget. The location filming is authentically wonderful but blurry and dark. Rose gregorio put forth the most believable of the characters and felt real. it's a good movie to watch once just for the story line if you can force your self to hang with it otherwise not worth bothering with. update 5/8/15: watched again and yes intresting and creative story. a youthfully beautiful mira, priceless footage. but still undeveloped. amature acting and low budget. can't help to think what mira would do with this today or what  if someone like nancy savoca had a hand in it. with how much italian culture has influanced america why can't we have a wealth of well financed, respected and well done italian american films instead of a handful of scraped together no budget ""art"" films.",1279756800,2,1070,4.8791208791208796
