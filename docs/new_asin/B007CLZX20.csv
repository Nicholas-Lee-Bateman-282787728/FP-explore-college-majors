5077686,5,B007CLZX20,"I had no expectations of this documentary, but I was blown away by it. Five parallel stories of different aspects and stages of love and the search for love, rendered elegantly and without sentimentality. Exquisite editing, beautiful cinematography, and profoundly moving but believable stories make this, for me, one of the best documentaries I've seen in a long time. I was impressed with the honesty of it, done without the slightest degree of moralizing. It really makes you think hard about all the love around you.",1338508800,4,520,5.058139534883721

Yay@the gay dad!
Awwe@the teenage couple",1378166400,,148,5.208333333333333
8514592,3,B007CLZX20,"I thought the movie was okay, but I was a little unsure about whether the single father's story was true or not.  He mentioned that he had never told anyone he loved them before--what about his wife of 14 years?  And why was he portrayed so poorly-as an alcoholic of sorts?  If his wife gave him custody when he drinks like that, then what does that say about her?

And why did the young couple even get married if they already had so many issues?  It seemed, perhaps, as if these stories may have been exaggerated a bit.",1365465600,,521,4.275510204081633

8514596,3,B007CLZX20,"Very well done. Just felt like the selected stories could've been slightly more compelling. My favorite was the single dad awaiting his twins, and the elderly couple. Very moving.",1357516800,,179,5.206896551724138
8514597,5,B007CLZX20,"Wow! What a wonderful treat. This docu showed the good, bad, and the reality of falling and staying in love.
