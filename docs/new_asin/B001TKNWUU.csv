3792314,5,B001TKNWUU,"This is arguably one of the best tv movies ever produced in the 80's. Sadly, they don't make movies like this anymore in hollywood now a days. The movie was actually released as a three-hour movie and not a miniseries in 1985. I still have a copy of this movie on VHS and it's great to get hold of this dvd version this time - much better quality. It's worth keeping this classic movie....from the production, to the music -- an outstanding film. Performance wise, I reckon Jaclyn Smith delivers her best performance in this film. She may not be in the same league like say Meryl Streep or Cate Blanchett but she's a very credible performer. I thought, she's really a standout during her quietest moments in the film. She just played it with grace and composure....

I'm giving this movie FIVE stars !!!",1251331200,18,803,4.537931034482758

3792316,4,B001TKNWUU,"I was dissapointed to read the other review of this movie because I really loved it. Granted, I am a nurse so I may have more invested than a non-nurse viewer....even so I thought Jacqueline Smith gave a heartfelt and noble portrayal of Florence. The movie itself showcased some of florences best moments...standing up to the male hierachy of the British Army to be allowed to care for the wounded soldiers. I defy anyone not to be moved by Florence's dedication and commitment to her patients. Way to go Jackie! Good job in bringing the ""Lady with the Lamp"" to life!""",1246665600,38,568,4.633663366336633
3792317,3,B001TKNWUU,"Interesting  story of Florence Nightingale's life and good for Jaclyn Smith fans. She of course looks great, although I thought was very stiff and unnatural, not very believable performance.  Timothy Dalton would be hard to turn down as a husband, but she did!

3792321,4,B001TKNWUU,"Prior to Florence Nightingale, nursing was seen as a very low social position at best, or a den of women of questionable backgrounds at its worst.  Florence Nightingale, due to her compassion for the ill, cast aside the comfortable livelihood her wealthy position afforded her, risked damaging her good reputation, and showed what it was to be both tough, yet compassionate.  As a person who is fascinated by her life and going through her writings, this film really intrigued me and kept me glued to my seat as I connected the parallels of what I knew and what the film portrayed.  It is a solid film that can inspire a heart.

CONTENT ISSUES:
Nothing to worry about.  Safe for the Family.

ABOUT THE FILM (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS):
I loved the story and the progression.  I love the details they put into it as well,  They really kept true to her tale.  The one thing to keep in mind is that this film is not like most biographical films where they keep the focus on a ""main/key moment"" in the subject's life with some flashbacks on their origins.  This film progresses through A LOT of her key historic and character influencing moments.  This means two things...one, that we get to see a wonderful overall growth of an extraordinary person, and two, we don't get to dwell in any particular part of her life and really milk, meditate, dwell on it.  That second point is a slight drawback as there were some points I really wanted them to tackle in more detail...but it is very minor issue.  Regardless, the tale as a whole is complete, cohesive, and inspiring.

In its portrayal of the character, I think they do a wonderful job.  It echoes much of what I've read of her works, and shows wonderfully how love and compassion can also be stern and still pure.  I was definitely satisfied with the acting as well.

EXTRA FEATURES:
Absolutely none except for some movie previews.

ALL IN ALL:
I believe that this is a film that is important especially for medical practitioners...but also for everyone as a whole.  Florence Nightingale brought new life to nursing which was, at the time, an ill-reputed profession.  And I believe that we need to remember the origins in order to remind us that Nursing was, at one time, not a profession sullied or obstructed by politics and agendas...and that we can still have that to this day.  But we need to remember.",1445904000,,2353,4.6352657004830915

3792326,5,B001TKNWUU,"Florence Nightingale is stirring TV movie from Emmy Award-winning that stars Jaclyn Smith in the title role together with Claire Bloom, Timothy Dalton and Jeremy Brett.

It is based on the life of Florence Nightingale, an aristocratic woman who defied Victorian society to reform hospital sanitation and to define the nursing profession as it is known today. After volunteering to travel to Scutari to care for the wounded soldiers of the Crimean War, she was scorned by her community and faced great opposition for her new way of thinking. However, through her selfless acts of caring, she quickly became known as ""The Lady with the Lamp,"" the caring nurse whose shadow softened those wounded.

Jaclyn Smith is a curious choice to play the title character in the made-for-TV biopic Florence Nightingale. This fact, however, never enters into the consciousness of the viewer, thanks to her excellent performance. The best scenes--and the most accurate--occur during the Crimean War sequences and during Nightingale's strenuous efforts to form the Red Cross. Though it was slow moving and it drags,this biopic about the 'mother of modern nursing' stays close enough to the facts to be worthwhile, and has production values rich enough to make the it come alive.",1433462400,,1260,5.171568627450981

3792338,5,B001TKNWUU,"Florence Nightengale was even more saintly than we knew.  She passed up a chance for marriage with a man devoted to helping her achieve her dream, but unfortunately she couldn't find a way to include him in it, and it almost broke her heart.  But she soldiered on, overcoming fatigue, discouragement, and rampant social and sexual prejudice.  The movie did allude to the crucial importance of the London Times in financing Ms. Nightengale, and their embedded correspondent in waking up the populace.  This was called the ""Breakfast War"", because thanks to the telegraph, the English populace learned from their newspaper about the ineptitude of the war ministry and the suffering of the soldiers.  Jaclyn Smith was totally believable and will send you to your history books to learn more.",1388620800,5,788,5.077519379844961

3792344,4,B001TKNWUU,"Being from the medical profession and having spent many years caring for the sick, I was very interested in seeing a film about this marvelous historical woman. I read her bio and found it enthralling so I sought out this movie. I did think that her role was played well but by a gorgeous actor who according to the pictures of Miss Nightingale bears no resemblance. Not that Florence was a homely girl by any sense of the word but she was nowhere near the image of the actor who portrayed her. I think Ms. Smith did a good job with this however and did the role justice as far as she could having to fill some very impressive shoes and a white cap of Florence Nightingale.

Her nurses were very good actors in their roles as were her parents and sister. The three men who fell in love with her were not in the bio so I think they were simply for effect as love interests but were not at all needed. It would have been best to stick with the real story of her accomplishments than to entangle her with men who were purely interested in sex and marriage when clearly she wasn't going in that direction. CLEARLY!

One of the only moments of fright I had for her life (in the movie) was at the hands of nurse Davies who appeared to be on the verge of killing her with scissors or bleeding her to death which is what bleeding did. It was of NO good to a patient's survival but, in fact, hastened their death and as you saw or read she did not employ that dreadful British medical practice in her art of healing and thank GOD! I felt this bit of drama unnecessary as it gave the movie a sinister feel and I HATED that!

All in all, it is worth the $7.00 I spent to get it.",1359417600,,1667,4.138888888888889

3792349,5,B001TKNWUU,"I understand that this movie may not follow exact history, but it does provide a feel for the time period and enables one to see the conditions of war.  It also allows one to experience the love involved in sacrifice and devotion to a task that does not serve oneself.  For this I give the movie 5 stars. Study the history, sure.  But, watch the movie and ask yourself ... what is my devotion?  how do I sacrifice for others, even unto risking my life and/or leaving behind comforts of the world?  Don't miss it.",1319846400,,512,4.347368421052631
3792350,5,B001TKNWUU,Excellent portrayal of Florence Nightingale leading up to and during the Crimean War.  Gives an overview of her determined character.  would love to see more.,1287360000,,158,5.28
3792351,4,B001TKNWUU,"This is a decent and nicely produced period piece.  The portrayal of Nightengale seems correct and perhap a little stiff, but this goes along with the feeling of the time.  The costumes and uniforms are all quite correct for the Crimean War period.  We even get a few Highlanders and Guards in bearskins!

Naturally a film like this is going to portray the Victorian British army as a crude male dominated organization.  The problem was that ineffiency was emblematic to all armies of this period.  The US was hardly in any better shape when our Civil War broke out a few years later and thousands were lost from bad care.  The French had a marginally better medical organization in the Crimea and by use of the Vivandiers, the lady Canteen carries, they had a least a built in element to use for helping the soldiers. The Russians were even worse off with hardly any medical care and their losses from this war will probably never be known.

 The British army suffered from an antiquated organization that had changed little  since the Napoleanic Wars.  The Duke of Wellington would have been quite at home with the army in 1854, as it was still his army in spirit.  The ineffiency however was something he would have corrected.  Unfortunately Lord Raglin did not have this ability, despite his long association with the Iron Duke.

Miss Nightengale certainly was a catalyst to address change.  Without her this would have happened anyway, as reforms throughout the army were due as a result of that first dreadful winter in the Crimea.  She certainly played her part to accomplish this noble end.  One notes that at Scutari Hospital the mortality rate was roughly 44% before she and the reforms instituted by Parliamentry Commissions were implimented.  Six months later it was reduced down to 2%.  Miss Nightengale and her staff, along with many dedicated army doctors deserve much credit for this.  The Crimean War was a first for many things.  Nursing was just one of them.

I enjoyed this film and thought it was well done.  There are not many dramas out there on the Crimean War, and for this reason alone I gave it a good rating.  I withheld 5 stars because its too bad the DVD package did not include a few extras such as a Bio on Miss Nightengale as well as some background for the general viewer on the war itself.  After all this is what DVDs are for.  Lacking those extras the production is not complete, but still a good movie none the less.",1276473600,12,2454,4.635730858468677
3792352,5,B001TKNWUU,"I ordered this item only because Jeremy Brett played the part of Florence Nightingale's father. His performance is excellent, as usual (if you want him to be awarded a posthumous Bafta, go to facebook:""posthumous BAFTA for Jeremy Brett"". But when I watched the movie, I found it extremely interessant and moving. Poor british soldiers! Florence Nightingale was really a generous woman, and a clever and very strong one too. I learned more when I watched this story, and in the most thrilling way. Excellent movie. I loved it.",1273017600,2,525,4.9772727272727275
3792353,3,B001TKNWUU,"Even if the movie wasn't made in Hollywood, our heroine is given the Hollywood treatment. It bothers me that she is portrayed by an actress who looks as plastic as a Barbie Doll. I only hope that the audience is motivated to find out more about the real person who is way more interesting than this character. The movie ends as Nightengale returns from the Crimean War. It makes no mention of the fact that at age 37 she became a recluse. She lived to age 90 but rarely left her room or even received visitors- not even her family. She did do alot of consulting and educating through letters she wrote. There is no mention of the fact that she had a genius for mathmatics and statistics.
I didn't hate the movie. I think it is well worth watching. It just doesn't do her justice.",1264204800,7,779,4.342465753424658
3792354,5,B001TKNWUU,"I just stumbled upon this film at Books-A-Million the other day and watched it with my Grandmother.  We were both intrigued.  The film centers around the internal conflict of Miss Nightingale pursuing her calling as a nurse versus adhering to the traditional society pattern of marrying well and foregoing any type of career.  While we as a society often think of nurses as a kind and gentle profession, this film really reveals to what lengths Miss Nightingale and her self-funded team of nurses went through to care for the soldiers that were being neglected by the British army.  They have to travel and defy British military tradition and hierarchy.  Miss Nightingale's flawless logic and adeptness with words is highlighted in the film.  And Jacklyn Smith gives a very sophisticated and classy portrayal of Miss Nightingale, the Lady With The Lamp.  Wonderful film.",1260316800,9,870,5.084507042253521

3792356,3,B001TKNWUU,"Sadly, the movie is not a really history. Now a days, we know that the job made by Florence wasn't enough good as the public believed, but her legend is standing from the job of others persons: Mary Seacole, an african-american from Jamaica, and the job maded by a british commision who ordered to clean the sewers that colaugh under the hospital of Scutari.
Sadly no one has made a film about Mary....perhaps for her origin, and apareance (very fat).
It is truth that Florence walked at night by the corridors, but the true reason was to control the sexual promiscuity of some nurses. Some of them had to be given back to England.
I don't judge a Jacklyn like an actress, nor the film as a very pretty film, but i think the public must know that the facts wasn't like the film.",1253059200,3,778,4.409722222222222

8341984,4,B001TKNWUU,"I just got finished watching Florence Nightingale and was pleasantly surprised by this made for TV film from 1985. I thought it was well done. Are there some negatives? Sure, but there are many more positives. I know some would quibble about Jaclyn Smith's poor British accent but I got used to it and was able to overlook it because there is a lot of beauty in the film, specifically, the beauty of sacrifice. I actually thought Smith did a fine acting job otherwise. Though I suspect that they have taken considerable license with her life story it still made for a good film which conveyed well the sacrifice that she made. It would have been so easy to remain comfortable in England, a well-to-do lady with a husband and a stately home of her own, but Florence's calling was for others. She fully believed she was called by God to help the sick. Whether she had to battle such temptation toward the married life I don't know but it sure made for stirring drama. It would be interesting to see a modern film made about her life. It's too bad that they can't make more films about heroes and heroines like Florence. They probably feel that they wouldn't make enough money from films like that, so they stick with making 57 Spider Man movies instead. I guess those of us who long for films about true heroes and not superheroes will have to make do with TV movies from the 80's. Of course, if they did make a modern film about her they would probably put a nude scene in it and riddle it with F bombs. Anyway, for the price this is a worthwhile film.",1514160000,,1551,4.407665505226481
