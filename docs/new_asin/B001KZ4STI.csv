8316555,4,B001KZ4STI,"This was a fine production.  Pornography is so widely available that it has lost a lot of stigma, which is frankly frightening.  I liked how the producers tried to offer many solutions to putting desperately needed controls and limits on the ease of access to pornography.
You will see the strange facial expressions on the woman from the 'entertainment' industry as she defends the rights of the industry.  I found it utterly telling of how the people involved in this have had to lie and justify to themselves about the consequences of this garbage.  Responsibility needs to be re-discovered and valued.
But the film has no follow-up.  It promises congressional action, hints at proposed bills, but I haven't heard or seen anything about the fabulous control that the producers came up with.
So what are we going to do next?  Are we just going to sit back and let the industry brain-wash us and our children?
I hope there's a Part-2 for this film because it needs one.",1297900800,5,970,4.744047619047619
