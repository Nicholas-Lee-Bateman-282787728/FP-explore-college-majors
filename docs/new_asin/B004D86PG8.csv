8424897,4,B004D86PG8,"I have rented similar series and DVDS on this subject; most were so-so at best.  When I rented this, I was prepared for disappointment, but it is actually really interesting!  It holds my interest, which is saying a lot, and puts forward a lot of accurate historical information I did not know before.  Too bad it is not available.",1382832000,2,331,4.576271186440678
8424898,2,B004D86PG8,"This four-volume DVD is too long (over ten hours), over-focuses on scenes of military battles, and provides little information about why its leaders failed to see what was happening, details about its army (total numbers, population size, and trends in their relationship, why army members were repeatedly able to get away with assassinations, their training, tactics, why the Roman army usually succeeded but surprisingly often was defeated,) the rise of Rome, or about life in Rome vs. other major cities at the time. As a result, it ends up being neither illuminating nor interesting, and impossible to distil any useful continuity from. Very disappointing - and I still have no real understanding of why Rome either rose or fell.",1374537600,,733,5.168067226890757
8424899,5,B004D86PG8,"I bought this as a gift for my husband and he loves it. There is new information in this set that he hadn't seen before. One complaint, it took 2 months to get to us.",1298332800,3,166,3.7714285714285714
