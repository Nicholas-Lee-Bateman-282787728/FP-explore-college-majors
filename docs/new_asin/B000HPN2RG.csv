8140747,2,B000HPN2RG,"Spokane, Washington... Somewhere Northeast of Twin Peaks. As the story opens, we find out that 10 years ago, ax murderer Dan Marcum killed his wife and their two children in a church. In the present, Marcum escapes from jail and gets hit by a car, and promptly dies (or does he)? Meanwhile, the former pastor of the church wants a family of four to move into the now-abandoned church (am I the only one who thinks this is a bad idea)? The family consists of the father, Ralph, who is unemployed; the mother Amy who works as a waitress in a dive; their pretty daughter Jeannie (this is the screen debut of Jennifer Salmi, daughter of actor Albert Salmi); and young son Stevie.

No sooner does the family move in, than strange things start to happen. The ax-wielding apparition of Marcus starts to show itself. Snakes appear in the jacuzzi-sized baptistery. When Jeannie goes to her room to find something nice to wear on a date, the word ""slut"" appears on her mirror, and chains materialize around her legs. It is a battle of wills. Who will win? The ghost who wants them out of there, or the family that is determined to stay? It brings up the question: ""How do you kill a ghost?"" Though the movie is hindered by a low budget and some cheesy special effects, it is nonetheless a good psychological thriller, and worth seeing.",1403654400,,1325,4.543933054393306
8140748,4,B000HPN2RG,"Pretty much verbatim opinion shared with prior reviewer; plenty of cheese, but I love the overall atmosphere; I watched a brand new copy just today, and I felt like I was 10 and staring at lewd and awesome vhs box art and daring to taste of the forbidden (overinflated content promise) fruit at my neighorhood grocery store.  And, on the subject of that new tape, Vista Media Sales is a fan-freaking-tastic vendor!  Brand new tape, they must have shipped it 3 minutes after I ordered; I recommend both this film and Vista Media Sales 100%.",1319155200,,539,4.663157894736842
