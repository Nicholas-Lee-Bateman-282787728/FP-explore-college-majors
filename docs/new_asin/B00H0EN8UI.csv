6125512,4,B00H0EN8UI,MY KID LOVES THIS MOVIE,1418169600,,23,3.8
6125513,3,B00H0EN8UI,"First of all let me start off by saying that I usually always buy anime movies in Blu-ray format if I know it's a movie I will watch consistently. This time around I went ahead and bought the DVD version at Walmart for $15 just in case I wanted to give it to a family member as a gift and then buy the Blu-ray for myself. Unfortunately, I don't think this movie is worth spending $40 for the Blu-ray version. I did enjoy the movie, but I can't say that I love it. The animation is pleasing but it is a slow-paced movie -more like something to watch when you want to relax or to have some noise in the house. The story is interesting but there were some aspects of it that I found to be kind of annoying. Younger children will appreciate this much more than anime-obsessed adults like myself. I certainly don't think this is worth $40, but that's just my opinion.",1417910400,2,862,4.2303030303030305
6125514,5,B00H0EN8UI,One of the best anime! The story and artwork is great. The story very heart warming. It's about a girl who lost her dad. Her and mom move to one of the outer island of Japan. It right up there with Summer War.,1417824000,,209,3.883720930232558
6125515,5,B00H0EN8UI,"Super sweet story, I really enjoyed it",1414800000,2,38,4.571428571428571
6125516,5,B00H0EN8UI,"I was fortunate to have the chance to watch the English dub of this film at the Kiggins Theatre in Vancouver. What a beautifully detailed and pleasant surprise it was. Not many animated films have been able to handle the topic of loss with such sincerity to the audience that may potentially connect with it. A Letter to Momo may feel too eager to charm (and pull off a fart joke - no, really), but that's because it knows its heart is always in the right place.

Likewise, there's almost no shortage of reasons why parents should watch this with their entire family. A Letter to Momo puts great emphasis on the complicated feeling of regret, and the idea that no one has to ever deal with it alone. Yes, the creatures that completely change Momo's life do look a bit creepy at first for little kids, but Director/Writer Hiroyuki Okiura is able to give them a natural humanizing thread to each of them. It's quite a shame how long it took for this movie to reach North America, but that makes it all the more valuable. If you've taken a look at the trailers or short previews online, then it might come as no surprise when I recommend you get the Blu-Ray copy (with both English and Japanese dub) that truly shows off its wonderful artistry.

The plot follows Momo and her mother, both dealing with her father's recent death and readjusting to a new lifestyle when they move to a quiet island. Iwa, Kawa, and Mame, the three odd-looking creatures (""goblins"" as they call them in the movie) that suddenly break Momo's monotonous new life, are guardians of sorts who have descended onto Earth to look after her and her mother. You'll have to see the movie to get the more touching reasons on why they're here in the first place, but Momo has to deal with the fact that others cannot see the goblins. It also doesn't help that they're quite riotous and constantly hungry (their attempt at snatching baby boars for lunch hilariously backfires). Although it is reliant on the supernatural to carry much of its plot forward, A Letter to Momo is quick to clarify that grief has no easy process for coping with it. This is especially the case when an argument between Momo and her mother leads to a boiling point, stripped of any sugar coating or film cliches. At the same time, the writers give a rather sweet and understanding account of their lives to great effect. Much like the main character's development towards the end, the film never feels afraid to take the big dive into open water.

A few details aren't explained as well as they should be, and that small feeling of concealment from the audience could very well be due to how inviting the whole movie is to its own intimate and honest world. One example is the fact that there is actually someone besides Momo who is able to see the goblins, and for some reason, that's either never fully explained, or we're supposed to assume that it's the same reason why Momo can see them. There's also a point in the movie where the goblins discuss their hesitation to break rules imposed from ""above"", even though it felt they broke quite a few with their own antics on the island already, so their whole discussion feels a bit redundant.

Despite all that I've just nitpicked, it's still hard to pose negativity at such a humorous and moving animated film. With its utter charm and friendliness, it's not only willing to impose difficult questions but it's also willing to suggest realistic answers. I hope history will eventually place this among the list of animated classics. The film's resolute need for emotion is masterfully paired with its childlike curiosity, a rarity for any film - animated or live-action - to accomplish so effortlessly. Of course, this is all not without its superb hand-drawn presentation. A Letter to Momo is quite simply, in itself, a lovingly animated letter written for the eyes, the ears, and the heart.",1411344000,52,3884,4.640988372093023

It covers topics like dealing with loss, family troubles, and making friends with its own form of anime charm. Fans of animation, particularly the works of Studio Ghibli will probably enjoy this film. Because of the monster designs, as well as the length of the film, this movie may not appeal to young children.",1481673600,,383,4.565217391304348

6125652,5,B00H0EN8UI,"Just finished watching ""A Letter To Momo"" released by Cinedigm Entertainment.
""A Letter To Momo"" is one of those rare and elusive anime movies that is willing to tackle the remorse and grief a young girl has after the tragic death of her father.
Momo feels she is responsible for her father's death.  She had planned a great surprise for him, but he got called away on a research ship - which he perished on.
Momo's mother decides that relocating to her childhood home on the remote island of Sho would give them a fresh new start on life.  Only three yokai - spirit guardians have been sent to watch over her and keep her safe at the behest of Momo's father, who is in Limbo until he can pass over to heaven and watch over Momo and her mother himself.
With great simplicity and heart, ""A Letter To Momo"" beautifully evokes the power of love's redemption and how we can move on when those we love have gone on ahead of us in the next world.
""A Letter To Momo"" celebrates acceptance of heartache and the willingness to let yourself move on.
Highly Recommended!
Five Stars!",1477785600,,1071,4.431472081218274

We love the movies of Hayao Miyazaki. and this movie seemed similar to the style of Hayao Miyazaki. The movie is long, about 2 hours, because it focuses on so many subtle and interesting details. The portrayal of the young girl was so excellent, it made me remember how I used to act/feel when I was young. I'd completely forgotten what it was like to have so many strong feelings as a young girl. It made me remember how I used to talk to my mother when I was that age. It made me more sympathetic to the feelings of my 14 year old daughter. The goblins are very funny. The animation is really beautiful. Highly recommended!",1457308800,,734,4.444444444444445

the animation was fluid and detailed.  the only negative was I had issues with the pacing and the tendency to flash back to opening scene more often than I thought was necessary.  yes, I understood this was the pivotal point which explains the leads motivation, but I felt the number of times it was shown took away from flow of the movie and underestimated the audience.

this is show for both adults and children, ..... well, children who won't fixate on the death of the dad.",1453248000,,581,4.5576923076923075

While trying to cope with this, she discovers three bumbling demons who are supposedly watching over her. She tries to deal with the demons to the best of her ability while also trying to figure out the meaning of a letter she found addressed to her.

This movie is a bit strange but even with that in mind, the movie is fun with likeable charecters. Momo is a very realistic teenager who is trying to understand life after her father's death and you can relate to her struggle. The demons offer mostly comic relief but when they do, it's hilarious. If you're a fan of anime movies, I cannot recommend this movie enough.",1450915200,,793,4.431506849315069

6126170,5,B00H0EN8UI,"I watched this with the intention of adding it to my binge watching of what I described as ""trashy animes."" I was not prepared for this. A Letter to Momo is absolutely extraordinary, I'm gonna go there, I'm gonna use that word. It's bittersweet but beautifully upbeat and hopeful. It may be animated, it may involve the afterlife and mythical creatures, but it's incredibly real. Momo is a wonderful character, a shy teenage girl dealing with the loss of her father and moving from a major city to a small town in the wake of this event. The relationship between Momo and her mother is honest, showing quite nicely the hardships they both face in such a situation. It sets off a potentially very dark mood with cheerful side characters and gratuitous kindness. It doesn't belittle the feelings of children and teenagers, and it shows a lot of emotion as well as some pretty humorous conflicts that are resolved instead of just forgotten. It's interesting and sweet and I cried more than once, but I smiled more. I watched this, actually, as an attempt to distract myself from my own recent loss. I can't give it enough compliments; its hopeful approach to death finally put my mood on an upswing.

Overall, A Letter to Momo is a gift to all ages. Beautiful animation, simple but delightful plot, and excellent characters with actual depth. Recommended to everyone.",1442102400,3,1364,4.779661016949152

6126226,4,B00H0EN8UI,"Quirky anime film that bears some resemblance to a Miyazaki/Ghibli film, but perhaps a little more bittersweet.  Setting-wise, it's almost a mashup of ""When Marnie Was There"" (girl goes to live with distant relatives although this time it's the mom with asthma), and ""Spirited Away"" (young apathetic girl relocating from big city to a more rural setting), but I think this film tries to be a bit funnier with the trio of yokai (folklore spirits) that accompany Momo.  They impart their own unique (and occasionally disturbing) personalities into the story, with decent comic effect, especially towards the climax of the movie.

I think it's safe to say that if you already like Ghibli-esque films or similar anime, you'll probably enjoy this one.  Newcomers to the genre may find it a little too bizarre to follow.  I would have preferred an original-language subtitled version, but this is probably a little more accessible to more people.",1438300800,,940,5.077922077922078

6126250,4,B00H0EN8UI,"I enjoy anime films and this one was no exception.  The storyline for A Letter to Momo was well written and the characters are very realistic and relatable.  One thing I loved about this film is that Momo is just an average preteen with the same angst and social issues we all deal with growing up.  I also loved how the relationship with her mother was expressed.  Even though they both are experiencing the same loss (Momo's father passed away after they had an argument) they feel it and live it differently.  Momo's mother is also a very hardworking and attentive parent, which I find more realistic then the airhead type parents in anime.  The youkai are hilarious and troublesome, and I love how Momo handles their interference in her life.  I would say that this movie is appropriate for preteens and older kids, as some of the jokes may be lost on the youngster crowd.  It is clean and without vulgarity and violence, and that makes it that more enjoyable.  I would definitely recommend this film to any anime fan and good story lover.",1435276800,,1043,4.594594594594595

6126266,5,B00H0EN8UI,"Letter To Momo caught my eye because I love Japanese film and culture. This is a story of a young girl named Momo whose life has been uprooted due to tragedy. It's not an overtly sad or depressing movie by any means despite the circumstances. There is a paranormal folklore twist but it's suitable for all ages. This story is simple yet quite engaging  and entertaining  there is no need for language, violence or adult innuendos that some of today's animated ""family"" films have.
The animation work is terrific.
I found myself rooting for the most unlikely characters.
As far as the characters I did get annoyed with the mother, but once that was explained, she was okay lol.

For younger minds queries on the matter of emotions surrounding parental death may arise, so you may want to be around to answer them as they do.  That said, it would be a wonderful shared experience to watch together or you may decide to watch first to see (1) whether they can handle it and (2) figure out how they may probe the matter of parental death and demise and prepare to share your own feelings.  Overall the film is genuine romp and adventure filled with and about new friends, unorthodox as some are, including over the top activities that can surely fill a child's imagination.

Their good intentions, however, are constantly derailed by their self-indulgent behavior. I love the way the island, which Momo initially and intensely dislikes, becomes the arena in which she discovers the answers to the self doubts raised by her father's death. Momo's slowly developing friendship with a boy her age and his chums adds another layer to the complex of influences that color her journey through this chapter in her life's story. The animation of the characters enhances the storytelling and I could watch the film just to view the glorious backgrounds.",1424390400,9,915,5.026315789473684

A tweenie suffers catatonic depression after her father suddenly dies after she bids him a spiteful goodbye.  Warning: catatonia is not very interesting. Her mother cheerfully ignores the problem.  The shattered girl's great aunt and uncle decide the best way comfort her is to introduce her to the concept of hideous soul-sucking goblins.  Shenanigans ensue.  The girl's ""guardians"" terrorize her, frame her for theft, encourage her to run away, and physically endanger her.  A local boy reaches out, but she blows him off.  She remains a schizoid doll in response to the friendly overtures of the boy and his friends.  She makes no effort to connect with the one other person who inexplicably can see the goblins.  The girl risks repeating her worst mistake with a spiteful goodbye to her mother, then seeks redemption by putting herself in mortal danger.  The goblins reason it is in their own best interest to help the girl.  Three stars for making me endure the slowness to find out what the inevitable message from Dad will say.",1423958400,,1061,4.971590909090909

Such a great story and for those who say that the 2 hour mark is too long, it's really not. It built up perfectly and ended incredibly well.",1422144000,2,419,4.384615384615385

I loved it.  My 11 year old daughter loved it. So did my 13 year old son.  I highly recommend it to anyone.  The reason for 4  starts instead of 5 is that although it's well made, I don't think it's for everyone.  I personally prefer something with more action and suspense like Princess Mononoke.  But nonetheless, it was an excellent movie.",1422057600,,512,4.43010752688172
6126559,5,B00H0EN8UI,"I watch a great deal of anime and this one would fall under the Slice of Life genre. The director wanted to depict a quiet life away from the city and he succeeded with the artwork, music as well as the general feel of the movie. This movie is not as well-known as the Studio Ghibli ones, but I was thoroughly entertained for two hours. The facial expressions were really realistic, the characters were lovable, even the aunt and the uncle, who only played supporting roles. If this could be available in Japanese with English subtitles, this would be awesome! Some things do get lost in translation, but I think the English version was pretty good, too.",1421798400,,654,4.598290598290598

It was sort of a gamble for me since I hadn't seen this movie before purchasing it, i only went of of the studio and director's previous work to guide my decision. Watching this film does require paying attention to the details since somethings can be easily missed. Also this animation style is not for everyone and i highly suggest looking at images before hand if you are somewhat particular about animation styles and designs. Something that I do like about this movie is that it must be rewatched in order to fully appreciate the story, characters, mythology and setting. Since my first time watching it there appeared to be infinite things occurring all at once, when in fact they were all very connected. Overall, a gamble i was happy about taking!",1421020800,,869,4.686274509803922
6126562,4,B00H0EN8UI,"I saw this title as a recommended movie to watch while I was scouring through Studio Ghibli movies to watch. After reading the synopsis it seemed like a pretty interesting film so I decided to give it a shot. After watching the film, I felt like it was a time well spent. This is my review of A Letter to Momo.

Artwork: The animation style of this film is a little bit different from other anime types of animation. Most anime characters resemble westerners where they have bigger eyes and other physical characteristics that depict westerners. I am happy to say that this film is a deviation from that and you can tell that the animators truly wanted to depict Japanese people in the films. It was a very nice authentic experience when it came to looking at character sprites.

The settings of the film art magnificently drawn and you can tell that the animators are no nonsense. Every single detail is drawn with the utmost precision and it was quite a joy to look at. If you want to see some nice artwork on landscapes, this might be a bonus.

Story: I will try to be as spoiler free as possible. The story is good, not amazingly great. It was entertaining but I did find myself to get slightly bored from time to time. You can definitely tell that it isn't targeted for adults but more for middle school to late elementary children. However, it was still a joy to watch through good storytelling.

I expected the movie to be somewhat depressing since the Japanese have a fondness for melodrama but I found it not to be the case. MOst of the film was pretty carefree and the concept of death was not targeted extensively on until near the end of the film. Instead, a great hunk of the film was targeted on Momo finding the Yokai and then dealing with their eccentric behaviors. I found one particular yokai to be extremely annoying though and he made my overall experience of the movie worse. I felt like his character was too annoying while the remaining two though mischievous, were a likely addition to the cast of characters. But when you do get to the very end be ready to be emotionally engaged. I am not a crier in most films but I did find myself tearing up in a certain scene.

Conclusion: A Letter to Momo was a lighthearted film that is both carefree and entertaining. It can even be classified as a coming off age story. It is not the best anime film out there, but it is still an enjoyable experience.",1420848000,6,2418,4.436936936936937
