526511,4,6302985315,"Glenn Ford is the producer of a television mystery series who attempts to protect his Broadway star wife (Debbie Reynolds) from a blackmailer--and decides to eliminate the blackmailer via a murder plot suggested by his own series.  The result is a comic chaos involving a couple of gansters, a peculiar pigeon, and the gazebo his wife is having built on their country property.
Based on the play of the same name, THE GAZEBO strives for a mix of broad farce, screwball comedy, and sprightly sophistocation--and by and large brings it off quite well.  I have never been a great fan of Glenn Ford, but he manages both the broad physical comedy and the clever dialogue of this film with equal ease.  Debbie Reynolds is also quite good in the role of the stage-star wife, and she and Ford have a surprisingly successful chemistry.  Although the humor is more smile-and-chuckle than laugh-out-loud, THE GAZEBO is a well made, well acted, and quite enjoyable.  Recommended.",1016496000,35,967,4.9079754601226995

526734,5,6302985315,"This has been one of my favorite movies since I first saw it on the big screen in the 1960's.  I waited and waited for it to become available on DVD only to be disappointed that it was through Warner Archives that it came on the market.  Well, shucks, I finally gave in and bought it as I really did love the movie.  As usual, with films from the Warner Archives,  there are no extras.  Just the nuts and bolts.

This is a comedy with a dark side.  Even in the darker situations, there are comedic undertones.  Glenn Ford was a marvel.  A solid actor, probably best known for western roles, his comedic skills and timing were superb and on fine display in this film along with those of Debbie Reynolds and John McGiver in particular.  McGiver's deadpan, straight faced pronunciation of the word ""GAZE-bo"" brought down the house every time he uttered it.

This is an entertaining movie that holds your attention throughout with excellent performances by the principals.  Sit back and enjoy anytime you need a good laugh.",1441411200,5,1019,4.6

526796,2,6302985315,"Sadly, this move does not stand the test of time - and may not have done so when it was released. It cannot decide whether to lean to comedy or mystery and the awkward mix is disastrous.

Glenn Ford can play detectives and cowboys but his range does not include comedy. His overacting is painful and seems an odd (and unsuccessful) effort to copy Jimmy Stewart.

There are frequent references to Hitchcock in the script - as if the director yearns to be like him. Clearly, he cannot pull this off. In fact, the director hold most of the responsibility for the failure of this film.

The one bright spot is Debbie Reynolds who manages to find the right notes against an off tune Ford.

It is too bad because the story line holds fine potential. But, it is hard to tell that amid this off-track production.",1424995200,,804,4.448979591836735

526833,5,6302985315,"How good to see three superior professionals, in the last days of the Old Hollywood, producing a nicely Old Fashioned comedy with a twist. George Marshall directs Glenn Ford and Debbie Reynolds in a comedy uncluttered by any higher meaning or social significance. Carl Reiner, who did begin life as a comedian and actor, does as well as he was allowed to, as the Best Friend, with John McGiver turning in one of his characteristically funny bits. Glenn Ford, one of the most reliable stars of the era beginning in the 40's, does particularly well as the harried TV writer-director, who is paying blackmail to keep early 'pictures' of his wife out of the papers, while Debbie Reynolds is as charming as ever, abetting his comedic efforts. Carl Reiner is kept in check so that we see little of what made him one of the memorable figures of early television as one of the Sid Caesar Club, but fits in well as the best friend, a County Prosecutor, who has to  question him over a missing blackmailer.
Happily, at least to these aging eyes, the film has lost little in more than sixty  years, in its capacity to entertain. I have no way of predicting how well it will be received by the younger crowd, but it should still be a good choice for those whose tastes were not formed solely in recent decades.",1404691200,,1298,4.542735042735043
526834,5,6302985315,"Glenn Ford is at his funniest playing a man who ""gets rid"" of a blackmailer who is threatening to reveal nude pictures of his wife, Debbie Reynolds.  But now that he has the pictures, what to do  with the body?  Why naturally, you bury it under the Gazebo!  Suddenly the Gazebo takes on mythic proportions as the murder becomes a botched project.  This movie is not to be missed as both Ford and Reynolds are at their comedic best! Comedy greats - Carl Reiner, John McGiver and Doro Merande add to the hilarious effort.",1403740800,,519,4.4787234042553195

If this were a Hitchcock movie it would have been serious. But instead it was a comedy. Seriously . . . a comedy about killing people, blackmail, prostitution, pornography, etc. And it was the worse kinda movie. It was the totally stupid 3 stooges comedy . . . ""slapstick"" stuff . . . not I Love Lucy slapstick . . . doors won't open . . . people fall down nonsense. But don't get too distracted. There is the beginnings of the Madonna . . . I can strip nude and stand in front of a highway if I want to and still be a feminist and ""serious artist"" because ""you can't judge me"" argument. Once again I couldn't relate to any of the characters. I cannot relate to a man who is married and invites a prostitute up to his hotel room while on a business trip. He even decides to trick his wife into selling the  house so he can pay off the blackmailers. I cannot relate to a wife who take pornographic pictures (she claims they were ""not that bad"") and gets blackmailed for it. I cannot even figure out the ""best friend"" cop, DA or whatever he was who seems to always be driving by, stopping by, and kissing the wife. None of these people are upstanding.

Glenn Ford and Debbie Reynolds work well together with Glenn's character believing he's in (albeit somewhat chaotic) control of the situation and Debbie's character ultimately showing she's been following his antics all along.  A nice comedy with some subtle twists and turns to keep the climax intact.  A nice Sunday afternoon or evening movie for the more refined among us.  Carl Reiner does his normal journeyman job and is a pleasure to watch although his character is somewhat tedious.  Certainly glad I bought it.

Everything which can go wrong for Ford's character hilariously does go wrong -- except, of course, for the comedic twist of fate, involving a pigeon he rescues, which provides a very funny happy ending.

Ford decides to employ a device from one of his shows and decides to dispose of the villain and bury him under an item of garden furniture -the Gazebo of thr title .Complications ensue when he kills the wrong man -or does he ?

This is the sort of movie that is fun without ever being outrageously funny .It only really becomes laugh out loud hilarious  when  the murder is being planned and throughout the picture I was smiling a lot without ever really laughing out loud .

Reynolds and Ford give likeable performances but the movie is stolen from under their noses by a parade of insouciant veterans like John McGiver,Dora Melende and Martin Landau .There is a pleasing musical interlude from Reynolds with the song Something Called Love and the experienced George Marshall directs with the appropriate lightness of touch for the material

I've usually had to turn to the Terry-Thomas, Peter Sellers, British movies of the 50s for that. But The Gazebo is an exception. It's an American comedy with that whacky, mad-in-a-sane-world British spirit.

Glenn Ford keeps up a frenetic pace as he tries to dispose of a dead body without letting his wife know what he's up to. He encounters one hilarious obstacle after another in simply trying to rid himself of the thing.

Debbie Reynolds doesn't know what to think when she asks Ford what happened to their shower curtain and he feverishly replies, ""Well, a man collecting for Hungarian Relief came to the door, and I gave it to him.""

You know any movie that contains the quizzical line, ""You donated our shower curtain to Hungarian Relief?"" - has GOT to be funny. This is a gem that deserves to be put into wider DVD distribution SOON!",1165536000,17,925,4.662576687116564

But the rest runs for you; it would be a sin to make another allusion around this sympathetic script supported by fine performances. Go for this and enjoy it over and over.",1139011200,3,384,4.408450704225352

7832923,4,6302985315,"This is a fun movie featuring the late Debbie Reynolds and Glenn Ford. A bit dated in the ideas, but a still clever and funny plotline of a writer working for (an unseen) Alfred Hitchcock while he thinks his Broadway star wife is being blackmailed. I hadn't seen it in a while, but memories were good enough that I wanted to add it to my DVD collection. Glad I did",1501459200,,364,4.214285714285714
