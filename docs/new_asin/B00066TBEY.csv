8039423,4,B00066TBEY,"When a small group of people and friends get together to create something they're all passionate about it always works.  This movie is not polished Hollywood but the people in it obviously worked hard to deliver a product that is useful and fun to watch.  There are two guys and two girls; the first guy is your laid back carpenter, tool guy and the other is your creative guy who does sound, lighting and builds the ambiance.  Of the girls one is dressed as a ""Gothic chic"" she keeps it fun and is very expressive. The second girl is colorfully dressed as a Halloween kitten like Penny from Big Bang Theory. The people bring a lot to the DVD as well as their ideas.

  The props are simple and explained well.  I've seen some over the top- Hollywood versions of house haunting and no matter how far they break down their steps or how many times they say $200 really isn't a lot to spend- I eventually click them off feeling that I could never achieve the same results.  This, thankfully, is not one of those DVDs.  You watch them make many of the props in under ten minutes and most of them consist of household goods.  The grander, large scale props, require only basic carpentry skills such as working with a circular saw, jig saw, drill...  There are some safety guidelines but it is mostly left up to the viewer to use common sense and caution when necessary. I liked this because they gave tips for specific props but did not overdo it on generic safety advise ie: don't run with scissors, wear a helmet, wear sunblock...
  IT COMES DOWN TO THIS: Are you a person of action or the eternal student?  Are you new at prop making or do you have some experience?
  This DVD is for beginner prop makers- people who will build these props one at a time until they've created their own haunt.  Eternal Students- or people who constantly buy new ideas, books, DVDs but never put what they learn into action my still enjoy this movie or they may find some of the props too simplistic.

The DVD I bought was used and very inexpensive.  It came in a block buster case and the DVD label had a sticker from a school but it still played perfectly- that goes without saying that it's good quality.  I'd give durability a 5 since you'd watch this DVD every time you planned to start a new prop so you could review the steps to build it.",1368144000,,2325,4.375291375291376
8039424,4,B00066TBEY,"I found this video to be extremely helpful.  particularly if you have not made a haunted house before.  all the props are easily doable, and he instructions are excellent.  I gave it four stars rather than five because I wished that it had been longer",1226620800,,251,4.533333333333333
8039425,4,B00066TBEY,"The people in this video create a haunted house and go through the steps for lighting, sound, creating props, etc.  They make a number of different props out of relatively inexpensive items that you may even have around the house.

The jokes are a little corny at times, but the people are very likeable.  They obviously enjoy what they are doing, and I have enjoyed watching the video a number of times.  I like the lighting, music, etc.  The video production has the right atmosphere and they capture that feeling of autumn and Halloween.  The DVD is well organized if you want to watch just one segment over again.

Their ideas range from the very basic to more complex props.  The video contains very traditional halloween props - graveyard, skeletons, coffin, etc., and a few different ideas like an electric chair and sparking chainsaw.

If you are really into Halloween, I think you will enjoy watching this video whether you make the haunted house or not.

Another reviewer recommended the Extreme Haunted House Makeover instead of this video.  The two videos are almost like two culturally different celebrations of halloween.  This video has the traditional spooky old-fashioned items.  On Halloween, the kids were lined up to come and see the house.  In the Extreme Haunted House Makeover, the house is like a set of a TV show or an amusement park.  They had electronics with dancing, rapping skeletons and electronics that are interesting to watch.  Although I also enjoyed the Extreme Haunted House Makeover video, the traditional Halloween decor is my personal preference.",1219536000,5,1586,4.973384030418251
8039426,2,B00066TBEY,"First off let me save you some money. I wish someone would have told me this. This DVD and the How to make a Haunted House DVD are the same DVD. The only difference is the title. I bought both thinking I was getting 2 different DVDs.

Now about the DVD. It is not all bad. But it is very very basic. If you have no idea what you are doing this may help you. But if you have ever done a haunted house before then this will be too basic for you.

Skip it and the other one.

A much better buy is Xtreme Haunted Home Make-Over. This is a good buy and cheap.",1199491200,11,554,3.8
8039427,4,B00066TBEY,"along with the projects in on this dvd the tip give my the guys are useful for building your own Haunted house

4 stars because more project would have been nice and a putting the plains on a web site instead of as still shots would have been preferred.",1189987200,4,253,4.163265306122449
8039428,4,B00066TBEY,"I just got this video two days ago and I have already watched at least three times. The guys and gals in this video do a great job of showing some basic, easy-to-create, creative prop ideas for a Haunted House. And, they look like they are having a great time doing it too, which after, is what it's all about, right? I only gave it four stars because I wish it could have been longer!",1172361600,12,385,4.1466666666666665
