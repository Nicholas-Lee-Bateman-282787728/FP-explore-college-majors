2654059,5,B000I8OFKA,"Each time I revisit this work, I grow more and more convinced that it is among Beethoven's most beautiful and profound.  In fact, I had never wept so much like an absolute baby prior to viewing this blessing of a DVD...

I won't say much except that this is the greatest production of Fidelio I have ever experienced.  It is beautifully traditional, the acting is especially moving, and Bernstein is at his most solemn and inspired.  It is infinitely suprior to the recent MET production, which is rather tasteless and shameful in comparison.

I would like to thank the Master Beethoven for leaving us with this work.",1170288000,22,617,4.728971962616822
2654060,5,B000I8OFKA,"I am a big fan of Fidelio; own a couple of dozen recordings (don't tell my family).  Why the love for this work?  First, it's Beethoven in symphonic glory; energy in every bar.  Second, the story is uplifting, both as a morality tale and as a struggle populated with decent folk who reach beyond themselves for one another.

This production is a gala affair; the sets are traditional (evocative of 18th-19th century Spain); the lighting is bright, so colors are good and one can see all of the action.  Singers are generally well chosen and perform admirably. However, at this point, slight reservations creep in; although Janowitz (Fidelio/Leonore) and Kollo (Florestan) look ""good"" and act well, the singing parts tax them a bit when pushed to the limit.  Most of the time that doesn't matter, and an argument can be made that a little vocal strain is in character with their dire plight.  Ideally, for me, Vickers as Florestan would have added extra vocal heft and more sensitive acting than Kollo.  (As an example, Kollo looks appropriately spent at the beginning of Act 2; but once rescued, he appears as energetic as any other character; seems to me he should still show some evidence of exhaustion throughout the scene.)  Similarly, Janowitz is sweet voiced, but in the ""big moments"" when she is called on for a more dramatic voice (a la Nilsson), she doesn't quite have it.  A final bit of performer carping (albeit minor):  Sotin's Pizarro is a bit anemic; a ""blacker"", fuller voice would have been preferable to my ears.  And, of course, there is Bernstein.  He leads an energetic performance (as usual); he includes the Leonore 3 overture between the dungeon scene and the finale.  As seems to be the norm in opera broadcasts, the camera is on Bernstein throughout most of the overture and Leonore 3; this obsession with the conductors and their manic behavior (Bernstein)or comic humming (Levine)can be distracting.  If you don't like it, close your eyes.  Actually, I kind of enjoy seeing Bernstein hop around like many of us laymen conducting in the privacy of our homes.  (One woman in the first row behind Bernstein suppresses a smile a couple of times.)

Overall, this is the best dvd of Fidelio out there.

Quick comparison to MET dvd since that's probably the most realistic competitor:  for the MET production the setting has been modernized with no loss in impact; Mattila and Heppner have a bit more ""chops"" than Janowitz and Kollo, but I prefer the latter overall as vocal actors.  Comparison of the other roles is a toss up for me.  Orchestras are about even, but I prefer Bernstein's more energetic treatment of the score and his inclusion of Leonora 3.",1170115200,33,2678,4.814004376367615
2654061,5,B000I8OFKA,"I'm a big fan of ""Fidelio"" and about a year ago I went looking for a decent DVD of it. I looked over what was commercially available and was less than impressed with the offerings. I eventually came across some 'bootleg' copies including this VSO performance (with Japanese subtitles)and found it to be terrific, even with that poor quality transfer.  When this commercial edition came out, with its superb audio and visual quality,(with subtitles available in multiple languages and only if wanted)I picked it up immediately!

The cast brings a surprizing amount of intensity to their performances, and Otto Schenk, the director, did a marvelous job, in my opinion, in getting some very detailed and moving performances out of them! The leads also sing well and look credible in their roles (a nice benefit when watching a film!) and the staging is intelligent and traditional.  L. Bernstein conducts with enthusiasim and insight and the Vienna Philharmonic (the VSO 'pit' orchestra!) responds with verve and beauty! (There is a CD recording with most of the the same cast out on DG label; that is a studio recording made several weeks after this performance was taped.) If you're a fan of ""Fidelio"", or even just interested in seeing how Beethoven met(and triumped over!)the unique challenges of the opera genre in his only operatic venture, then do check this DVD out!",1168473600,53,1371,5.004385964912281
2654062,5,B000I8OFKA,"I have not heard Fidelio in a long time, and watching/listening to this performance now was a revelation, mostly to Beethoven's music and style.  My major question has been for a while - why did he stop at writing just one opera, this one, and never composed another opera ever again?  I think I heard loudly some answers - in short, he was probably not happy to continue in a style universally approved and admired for the time, that is, of Mozart and soon Rossini;  yet his innovations, where he really shows that he is different, were severely criticized in this opera, as much as many parts of his Symphony No. 9.  His contemporaries criticism was aimed as such parts dear today as ""O namenlose Freude!"" - it was found nave, pompous and distasteful.  Thus, he found a limitation in himself since he could not outperform Mozart writing in his style, and for furthering his own style perhaps he lacked patience or courage or a devoted patron - something that Wagner will have 50 years later.

There is no doubt in my mind that if Beethoven had continued, we would not have Wagner as we know him - everything he had to say would have been said and expressed by a greater genius of Beethoven.  Maybe because Beethoven had just one opera, Wagner wrote only them, and never any symphonic music, as to avoid a direct competition - he certainly knew he had a lesser talent; and he mined profusely in Beethoven.  Let's see how the music evolves.

The opera starts very pleasantly; the beginning has no particular signature and reminds of the start  of Le Nozze with the dialog of two commoners, Marzelline and Rocco.  As it proceeds and the father narrates his down-to earth dreams about what a secure future should mean for his daughter in his aria `Hat man nicht auch Gold beineben"", we hear unmistakably ""Batti, batti, o bel Masetto"" from Don Giovanni - a song that Zerlina, also a commoner, sings to her groom Masetto.

This mood changes to Mozart's Requiem in the great Pizarro aria ""Ha! Welch ein Augenblink!"" - very fitting, since he is plotting to kill the prisoner, his enemy Florestan.

Next, we hear recitative and aria by Leonore ""Abscheulicher! Wo eilst du hin?""  and from here one might say, Wagner starts - it could be Senta, Isolde, Kundry - but the root is here, and it is not Mozart anymore, it could not be. What follows is the development of Beethoven's own music and style, and only in a very few moments there is any remaining trace of Mozart - perhaps in the moment in `Es schlagt der Rache Stunde"", a great quartet in Florestan prison cell; when the trumpet is heard the music suddenly reminds so of Il Commendatore arrival in Don Giovanni;  promptly, Pizarro leaves.

The following scenes are progressively filled with music of marriage of mighty sublime and pompous idealism, so very Symphony No. 9, divinely beautiful and at times so overbearing that grandeur starts dripping from sweating violins.  In this particular production, it was amazing how fast Bernstein made the orchestra playing; it was awesome but perhaps too Toscanini-like and the finale tempo was really extravagant; the chorus lost it once, but the Maestro was non-relenting, rushing it so as he was suddenly tired and bored of this whole affair and wanted to finish it ASAP; the ending felt as an operetta or a Rossini.  Perhaps as Beethoven wanted to outdo Mozart, Bernstein wanted to outshine Furtwangler.  I think Beethoven succeeded better.

Singing-wise it was a very good production;  I compare it with the old Furtwangler's recording with Kirsten Flagstad as Leonore, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf as Marzelline and Julius Patzak as Florestan.  While the voices in Bernstein version are also excellent, how much more thoughtful Furtwangler's Fidelio is.  There the music is given its due, with the conductor exploring its depths and beauty, bringing out  its magic, and serving to music itself, not to himself, while somehow this Bernstein performance seems to be one-man show;  he was so preoccupied with making it unique that at times it sounded as a vaudeville,  completely lacking of lyricism.  Yet, despite this obvious desire for Bernstein to be original in his interpretation of Fidelio, this Vienna performance  is still a great production.  It is strange to think that the greatest Boris Godunov existing on DVD was also staged in 1978 (in Bolshoi).

Concluding, looking back from our time, after many sounds that are called music today to a feverish accolades of the crowd, it is astonishing that this opera could have been so harshly criticized - to a modern listener it is a true masterpiece.  Just to imagine what Beethoven could have created as his 5th or 9th opera! - Mozart's Don Giovanni was not his first opera either.  It is a pity Ludwig gave up on the genre - since  1805, Fidelio's Premiere, he had many years to give us more!  Yet we are lucky to have one but one of the best operas ever.",1286150400,4,4901,4.767772511848341
2654063,5,B000I8OFKA,"I was a little apprehensive about buying this DVD since it filmed a 1978 production which, of course, raises concerns about the quality of the recording. Let us start this review by saying that those concerns were put to rest; the sound is excellent - simulating surround? - and the visual is very good. As regards the production, I cannot see how any other production can better this one, unless you tire of a traditional staging and prefer updating to a modern period. Even though all the principal cast members were up to the task of singing what is generally considered a difficult opera for them - Beethoven seems to have concentrated on the music without really considering the demands it would make on the human voice - what really makes this Fidelio stand out is the man in the pit - Leonard Bernstein. The camera is attracted to him and indeed, if I had been in the audience, I would have been too.  In fact, I would have to have been playing in the orchestra, since the camera had a privileged position in front of the conductor. In no other DVD opera that I can think of can you actually see the connection between the Conductor and Orchestra: this was definitely a memorable perfromance by both and you will feel like joining the Viennese audience in a long and sustained applause.",1285632000,6,1293,4.573275862068965
2654064,4,B000I8OFKA,"I note that of the 10 reviews submitted to date, there are 9 5-star reviews and only 1 3-star. I am giving it 4 stars (3 1/2 would have been more appropriate).

This is a 1978 performance from Vienna.  Like the Met the set is very extravagant.  Fortunately on a DVD with close-ups the problems with such a set are overcome.  It is only when the camera pulls back and we can see the stage the way the audience would that one can see how it overwhelms and diminishes the singer/actors.  Bernstein certainly knows how to wring out every last bit of emotion from the music, so that would have been a great compensation for the audience.

The reason I am only giving 4 stars  is because of Gundula Janowitz.  When I mentioned singer/actors, I did not intend to include her in that category.  She moves like a marionette -- stiff and jerky.  Her singing also leaves a great deal to be desired.  The stage and performance brightens considerably when Lucia Popp is on; and the reverse happens when Janowitz is on -- and it is not due to the music or the role.  She is an old style singer, stand and deliver; and alas, she hardly did that.

Other than that, this performance makes a good companion to the more modern and, to my mind, better Met production with Matilla, Welch-Babidge, Papp, Lloyd; and a Heppner who looks as though he ate the other prisoners in the  dungeon.",1259884800,5,1366,4.433734939759036
2654065,5,B000I8OFKA,"Beethoven's unique opera work is really a great musical and drama development of the stage art. In this case, one of the greatest moments of the german master is performed by a great cast of singers, actors and of course, the musical direction by one of the best american directors of the twenty century: maestro Leonard Berstein. This 1978 version is unique in all details. The stage production by Otto Schenk have the closest aproximation to Beethoven original ideas of the drama set in Seville, Spain rather than other modern and fancy productions. All the performance is full of great pasion and dramatic force, excellent singers like Gundula Janowitz and the beloved Lucia Pop have just gone at the highest point of the german vocal art. Maestro Berstein impressed us with his marvelous and carismatic way of conducting and keep us from the opening oberture up to the finale with any hesitation or boring whatsoever. Its really gorgeous! The Chorus and Viena State Opera Orchestra put the right complement of sublime beauty, pathos, joy and hope which caracterize the all escense of the Beethoven 's only opera. We highly recomend this version on dvd to all Beethoven music lovers and must be in the collection of all opera fan. Thanks Amazon for having this video on your records!",1242259200,3,1286,4.9036697247706424
2654066,5,B000I8OFKA,"This is a live performance and is not the same as the studio recording made with almost the same cast and issued on CD.  If offered a choice, I would get this video because it's a video, but I have the CD set too and wish to keep both.  It is one of Bernstein's best performances and features Gundula Janowitz as Leonore, Lucia Popp as Marzelline, and Rene Kollo as Florestan. Among the videos currently available, this would be my first choice.  Bernstein made a slight rearrangement for the Leonore overture No. 3 so that it is just a continuation of the vocal duet before it.  My only criticism is that the spoken dialogue was shortened too much, and especially I would have liked to hear the brief words of Florestan and Leonore just before the ""O namenlose Freude"" duet, where Florestan asks: O, meine Leonore, was hast du fuer mich getan? (Oh my Leonore, what have you done for me?) To which she replies ""Nichts, mein Florestan"" (Nothing, my Florestan).",1208217600,4,959,4.590643274853801
2654067,5,B000I8OFKA,"I've been a Fidelio nut ever since experiencing a wonderful performance at Tanglewood several years ago.

This Fidelio grabbed hold and wouldn't let go:  It held on fully and completely all the way through to the end.  For me that's really unusual.  Typically there's some element that breaks the emotional spell, some individual performance that doesn't ring true, or music that doesn't hold continuity of emotional intensity.  When this was all over I found myself clapping and Bravoing right along with the rest of the audience.

Reading other comments, it looks like Bernstein's antics don't hold well with some of the more diagnostic reviewers; but watch and you can see where Bernstein's emotions transfer beautifully to the very sole of the musicians which in turn transfers right to the heart of the listener.

I LOVED this performance.  And .. It looked and sounded great on my system.  The next version of this I buy will be when it comes out on Blu-Ray or HD-DVD where the audio will be in one of those much improved SACD like lossless formats (e.g. Dolby True HD).",1207699200,3,1076,4.836065573770492
2654068,5,B000I8OFKA,"This performance is far more than the sum of it's parts.  Several reviews have found valid things to complain about.  Janowitz has not got quite a big enough voice for Leonora,  yet she brings a humanity to the role that evaded Flagstad and Nilsson.  Benackova has the voice for Leonora, but is not visually credible.  Benackova is wonderful as the Bartered Bride.  If we accept the concept that Leonora is a real person who is an extension of the mythical Pamina in the Magic Flute, a smaller voiced Leonora becomes very credible. Read Zizek and Dolar- Opera's Second Death.  Janowitz was my favorite Pamina until I heard Hartelius.

Popp is possibly the greatest Marzelline ever,  making this DVD a great tribute to her tragically short life.  The men are very credible in their roles as well.  Audiophiles will find the sound a bit colored with a small degree of dynamic compression, but no distortion.  Most people I suspect will find nothing about the sound to complain about, as it is good sound even by more recent standards.  Only the chorus is muddy sounding in places.

Personally I feel that Bernstein and Furtwangler owned this opera.  Both Conductors made studio recordings of Fidelio.  Bernstein in the studio is more cautious, and of course all the minor flubbed notes have been replaced by retakes.  As good as the studio recording is, This live DVD has an electric atmosphere that no studio recording can create, even if we ignore the picture.  Picture quality is excellent, far better than my expectation.  Video directing is also very good.  There is no regietheater.  Marzelline uses a old fashion iron, which does not have a line cord.  Rocco does not take pictures with a ""one use"" flash camera.  There are no communist era uniforms either.  I for one enjoy some regietheater productions but have yet to find a regietheater version that holds a candle to this traditional production.

As one who attended many Bernstein concerts at the then Philharmonic Hall in New York, I cannot think of a better way to grasp the excitment he brought to music.  Highly recommended and long overdue DVD.",1177718400,22,2110,4.840336134453781
2654069,5,B000I8OFKA,"I am not the fan of an opera Fidelio, but for a long time wanted to buy this opera on DVD. I am very glad that I have bought this record! Fine scenery and suits,especially I was struck with a dry tree at a wall in 1 act, it as if speaks that in this prison there is no place to anything alive! And the bridge in the ending which opens towards to the sky, to the sun, freedom! Fine performance, not simple singing, and good works of actors. Leonore-Janowitz is the strong and resolute woman, little bit sad, but purposeful. Florestan-Kollo is humiliated,at him a sight of the torfured animal. For the greater expressiveness of an image of hero Rene Kollo even has offered of vocal, in the beginning 2 act he sings an aria hoarsely, it shakes! Don Pisarro-Sotin is the present vaniac, he is pleased blood and suffenings of prisoners. Lucia Popp is one of my favorite singers, at her is not present unsuccessful roles. Leonard Bernstein conducts ingeniously! It is fine performance, it can not leave indifferent anybody.",1174694400,9,1017,4.593406593406593
2654070,3,B000I8OFKA,"Hopes are slightly dashed for this Fidelio. It has

a great Otto Schenk production. Bernstein idiosyncratic,

but vivid, unique. There's an Overture right after ""O

Namenlose Freude.""

Janowitz as Leonore is

more involved than one might think. But she is not

overpowering the way Benackova and (especially) Mattila in

the scene where she saves her husband; in fact it is really

lukewarm here. Janowitz is not an actress. Vocally she is

stretched at both ends. Cool, classical sound, not the

ideal vibrancy for Leonore. Low notes are squawks, high

notes sometimes straighten out and sound yelly: the voice

cannot take much pressure at all. Neither can Rene Kollo's.

An over-vivid actor, he too sounds like his voice is

strangling him at times. Both his and Janowitz's voices

 completely dash themselves to pieces in ""O namenlose

Freude.""

I was disappointed to discover that Hans Sotin, so

wonderful as Sarastro in the FLUTE film, is here, a bass,

cast as PIZARRO, a baritone role. Sotin is ill at ease

vocally, forbidding physically. Manfred Jungwirth, the

Rocco: it sounds like he and Sotin should have switched

roles (voices only).

The only one who comes through shining like the proverbial

beacon is the wonderful Lucia Popp. So strong is her vocal

security, musical integrity and appeal of personality, she

really makes the leads look gauche and inadequate. That she

can do so with a scrappy role like Marzelline is really

telling.

It is for Popp alone that I will glance back at this.",1173052800,24,1513,4.959839357429719
2654071,5,B000I8OFKA,"It's not often that you find an opera on DVD that has it all---great singing, great conducting, great orchestral support, and a production that doesn't make you wince when you see it.  This recording of Fidelio---Beethoven's only opera---does have it all, and it's not only the best production of the work on DVD, but has to be among the best in terms of all opera on DVD that is available right now.

To start with, the singers are all top notch; Gundula Janowitz is in the title role, and while her voice does strain some (whose wouldn't singing Fidelio?), she sings with great technique, passion, pathos, and does it all while acting the role, too (something too often neglected).  She brings Fidelio/Leonora to life and shows the emotions of being so close to her near-dead husband in one of the best portayals I've seen on stage.  The rest of the cast shines, too; Rene Kollo lands his Act II aria with perfection and plays a great Florestan; Hans Sotin is a heavier Pizarro than some may be used to, but his voice soars through the house and he plays a perfect villain, if not somewhat more anxious than evil; Manfred Jungwirth as the old jailer Rocco provides a steady, firm presence on stage, and a young Lucia Popp as Marzelline sings beautifully as well.  It should also be mentioned that this opera is extremely difficult for all singers involved, and while it might have been easy for them to just give the stand and sing treatment, they don't--everyone acts well, and truly brings drama to what is both a harrowing and exciting story.

The production is a traditional one; for those looking at the Met production done a few years ago, this may be a major factor in deciding.  Both are extremely high in musical quality, and some people would prefer Karita Mattila as Fidelio to Gundula Janowitz, but the Met's is a modern production (although not a distasteful one---it is done very well).

Some of the other reviewers have noted that the real star of this DVD is Leonard Bernstein.  The camera finds him frequently, and as has been mentioned, during the Leonora Overture #3 (which is often not performed) the camera is almost exclusively on him and his bouncing around.  But that is what is great about this recording: there is unbridled energy.  I mean, there is a ridiculous amount of energy; Bernstein keeps things moving along, the orchestra play like gods, and you can feel the atmosphere from just watching it.  The crowd was treated to a perfect performance and they REALLY show their appreciation--Berstein had to turn around four times before the bravos would even think about stopping after Leonora #3.

Technically, Deutsche Grammophon comes through again.  The audio is great and the video is clear; there are optional subtitles in five languages, and a few extra features.

Overall, if you're looking for the best Fidelio out there right now, go with this one.  You'll love it.",1172188800,61,2904,4.766467065868263

I did note the slight misfires mentioned by a number of  writers but found them entirely forgivable given the effort involved.  Perfection is only for the Gods. The accompanying booklet gives Bernstein's explanation for including most of the Leonore Overture in an invented pause before the last scene. Who am I to question what ""Lenny"" (as Copland always referred to him) wanted...oh, well, was it really necessary?: Lucia Popp is the first singer on stage, there alater she does a fine job. Her father, the jailer is very good while the undoubted Star, Gundula Janowitz, admirably fills the role as is required of a Star. Incidentally, both she and Popp look like wives one would not mind having. Hans Kollo should be given due credit for handling so well the Evil man of the piece, Governor of the Prison compound within which all the action takes place. The rest of the cast mostly performed ably although I found the crowd scene and some of the singing in the final courtyard scene technically somewhat deficient in miking the performance. A minor point.
In sum, while I have not heard any other dvd version, I have one other on my shelf for listening in a week or two, and can make no comparison, this  disc is certainly quite a good presentation despite its age as measured in this world of rapidly changing technology.",1449878400,3,1415,4.720647773279352
8144480,4,B000I8OFKA,"A 1978 performance from the Vienna State Opera.
Leonard Bernstein sets his clear mark in the only opera of Beethoven, set with a dark theme that suits Bernstein's dramatic taste to a 'T'.
The conducting is exceptional, as evident from the darkly gripping and growling Overture.  As for the casting, it may puzzle some people with the choice of Gundula Janowitz as 'Fidelio' (Leonora). A truly great soprano, Janowitz manages to use all her available vocal resources to depict a heroine, but there are, honestly, better Leonoras (Christa Ludwig comes to mind). Janowtiz, however, is not a great actress. I wonder why Bernstein did not choose Hildegard Behrens, another soprano that recorded Fidelio for him (on CD) and who is great operatic actress as well as singer.
Rene Kollo is adequate as Florestan, though again, not necessarily the most impressive.  Both Kollo and Janowitz represent the type of impeccable vocalists, who, even in unsuitable roles, manage to pull off the performance without any hitch.
The real stars in this live performance are the minor role of Marcellina sung by Lucia Popp, and the major role of Rocco of Jungwirth.  Popp gives a shimmering performance of Marcellina's scant solo parts in the opening Act.  Jungwirth depicts a multi-faceted character as her father the jailer.
Hans Sotin is a bit underpowered as the villainous Pizzaro.
So here, you have a sterling live performance of Fidelio that is a bit on the uneven side both vocally and dramatically.",1420675200,4,1485,5.048979591836734

8144484,3,B000I8OFKA,"I am afraid I hold a dissenting view about this video.
I have seen Fidelio twice - once at the MET (with Jon Vickers) and once in Berlin (with Gladys Kutchta as Leonore and William Dooley as Pizarro).  I am familiar with the recordings of B&ouml;hm (2), Furtw&auml;ngler (2), Maazel, von Karajan, Klemperer, and Bernstein (the one made in conjunction with this production in Vienna).  I say this not to set myself up as an expert on the opera (I am not) but to let you know that I am fairly familiar with it.
I came to this video immediately after listening to the Bernstein performance on CD and watching the Hamburg video with Silja, Popp, Cassilly, Wohlfahrt, Wiemann, Adam and Sotin.
Compared with the Vienna video, there is a small degree of excitement missing from the Vienna studio recording, but everyone sings better in the studio recording and, of course, the instrumental mistakes are not there. The inadequate Don Fernando of the video, Hans Helm, is replaced by the much better Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau in the studio recording. Kollo is taxed vocally by Florestan, but that is not as evident in the studio recording and Janowitz's alarmingly wayward high notes are under better control in the studio.
Let me just come out and say it: Janowtiz is a wonderful singer for Mozart and Schubert.  Her recordings of Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos and Weber's Der Freischutz have few rivals. Leonore is a role which is a couple of sizes too large for her voice and the strain of trying to fill out the music shows all too clearly.  This was especially evident after watching the made-for-television production from Hamburg done in 1968 and only recently released.
Anja Silja has the voice to do Leonore's music justice and the acting skills to almost be convincing as a young man.
Lucia Popp's younger self is marginally better, but in either case she is just about perfect.
Erwin Wohlfahrt sings better than Adolf Dallapozza, but Dallapozza is fine, if a bit hard to hear sometimes in the video.  Dallapozza is petulant and Wohlfahrt is static.
Richard Cassilly's voice seems larger and sturdier that Kollo's and he's singing under better conditions.  In the video Kollo jumps around quite a bit for a man who is being starved to death.  Cassilly moves very little and always for a dramatic purpose.
Theo Adam as Pizarro tears up the scenery.  I have never really cared for the sound of his voice, especially when he is in ""Bayreuth bark"" mode, but he is a formidable, evil Pizarro.
Although the role of Pizarro may be a tad too high for Hans Sotin,  his stature and ""black"" voice help him carry it off.
There is nothing wrong with Manfred Jungwirth's Rocco, it's just that Ernst Wiemann's Rocco is as well sung but better characterized.  I THINK so, anyway; his ""gold"" aria, the trio ""Gut, Sohnchen, gut!"", half of the dungeon scene and a few smaller cuts make the role much shorter.  His acting, though, is just right and not at all the fatuous bumpkin of some other portrayals.
As Don Fernando, Has Sotin is dignified and he has the advantage of that wonderful voice.  Hans Helm's voice does not seem to be in very good shape, although the little bit of acting he has to do is convincing.
The Hamburg orchestra is not the Vienna Philharmonic and Leopold Ludwig is not Leonard Bernstein, but neither are deal breakers.  Ludwig and his Hamburg orchesta are accomplished musicians who bring the (truncated) score to life.  If you want Bernstein - and he provides an exhilarating ride - I suggest getting the audio recording.  For a video of Fidelio I recommend the Hamburg production or the superb (mostly complete) film from the Deutsche Oper Berlin with B&ouml;hm conducting Gwenyth Jones, James King, Josef Greindl, Marti Talvela and a truly menancing - both physically and vocally - Gustav Neidlinger.  It is one of the few opera videos that I can watch straight through without having to take an ""intermission"".",1346284800,13,3919,4.792284866468843
8144485,5,B000I8OFKA,"I never heard of Fidelio and did not even know one of my favorite composers even wrote one. I purchased it because it shows up on the top operas of all time and I am getting the whole ""best opera"" library. Quite simply this is one of the most uplifting and beautiful operas I have ever heard; and I love the normal speech in between arias. Triumphing over tyrany with beautiful melodic opera arias to tell the story does not get any better. And when all the prisoners are let loose to smell the fresh air and feel the sun you cannot help but stand up and cheer. This opera is pure joy.",1299542400,2,585,4.185840707964601
