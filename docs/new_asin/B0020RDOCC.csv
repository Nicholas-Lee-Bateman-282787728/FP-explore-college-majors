8348591,2,B0020RDOCC,"If you are buying this movie hoping to get a lot of detailed history on the true original Jamaican dub reggae scene and it's origins, you may end up really digging the first half hour and that's about it. While the first 1/3 of the movie surely does have some cool moments and great interviews with legends like Lee Perry, U Roy and Prince Jammy...at the end of the day this movie spends way more time letting a large amount of modern club DJ's and dance music artists attempt to be the ""teachers"" on the subject. So yeah, if you're a King Tubby, Lee perry, etc super-fan and are hoping for 2 hours of schooling on the true era of dub from people who actually lived it, just stick with youtube searches. However if you are more into modern electronic music that is inspired by dub and are curious to see what some of those types of artists have to say about it, then check it out, you'll enjoy it. The amazing 3-part BBC Documentary series ""The Story Of Jamaican Music"" is still the one to beat. If only it spent more time on dub specifically.....",1315612800,4,1047,4.346938775510204

8348593,5,B0020RDOCC,"Well done doco on the dub music movement from its origin to modern day. Chapters are divided well and chronicle the transitions of the genre and the effects it had on hip-hop, drum n' bass, and ambient electronica. As a dub musician (Starry Crown Sound System) I found this movie very useful. I haven't checked out the DVD extras yet, but already worth the money! Oh, and it won lots of film festival awards too...",1268352000,5,414,4.533333333333333
8348594,5,B0020RDOCC,"People often associate ""dub"" with ""reggae"" and don't give it much more thought than that.  Dub is actually a studio technique using electronic instruments to manipulate sound.  Dub is closely associated with reggae but ""dub"" style goes way beyond just reggae music.

In fact, as this documentary shows, because of the advent of dub, the course of musical history around the world has changed.  It has influenced everything from the birth of hip-hop to most electronic music heard today with its manipulation and emphasis on sounds and instruments often buried in a song.

It's a great documentary that pays homage to this innovation from Jamaica.  You may want to freshen up your patois just a bit.",1261267200,9,698,4.974137931034483
