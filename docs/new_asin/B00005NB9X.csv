1631498,5,B00005NB9X,"I rarely write reviews, but this one does not have enough!  =)  I don't know why I'd never heard of this movie before, but it is a classic.  FYI: there is male frontal nudity, and a topless woman scene, but it's very European-like and matter-of-fact.  Probably not appropriate for kids, though.

My husband and I can't remember the last time we laughed so hard!

1631499,4,B00005NB9X,"What a fun movie St. Ives is.  It reminds me of the type of film made during the 40's.  Classic story, rounded off by characters and a plot that is neither over dramatic nor overtly complicated.  In fact it isn't over anything.  Robert Lewis Stevenson's story - here adapted for the screen - reads like Jane Austen for men.  We do get a tale that has a romance at its heart, but there is plenty of fun too:  battle scenes (sort of), prison escapes, mistaken identities, swordplay, and the funniest line I've heard in years:  ""Only in Scotland would guests be announced by name at a masked ball.""  There is much hilarity, hardship, and not a little heartbreak as St. Ives tries to fight and find his way back to a family and life he barely knew.

The cast is absolutely stellar with the too infrequently seen Jean Marc Barr absolutely perfect in the title role.  Anna Friel is a refreshing delight as the resourceful Flora and Miranda Richardson nearly walks away with the movie as her worldly, seen-it-all Aunt Susan.  Richard Grant provides comic relief of the highest order.

This is not going to be the greatest movie anyone has ever seen, but it's charms are undeniable and the entire film fairly bristles with an energy that bursts with life.

1631500,5,B00005NB9X,"I saw this movie in a hotel in Inverary, Scotland and it took me three years to finally figure out what it actually was called.  I never forgot it and when I saw a preview on another movie I have, I immediatly ordered it.
St. Ives is an utterly delicious romp. It is charming, funny, and romantic, with momemtary lapses in humour that so many comedies these days seem to lack.  It follows the adventures of Jaques St. Ives (played with great skill by Jean-Marc Barr) one of Napolean's hussars.  St. Ives, after contriving to get himself demoted in order to escape a number of duels inadvertanly tumbles into a camp of British soldiers and ends up in Scotland as a prisoner of war.  There he meets charming Miss Flora and her wordly aunt (Anna Friel and Miranda Richardson) and comes across the uptight Major, played with hilarious British prudishness by Richard E Grant.  After a daring escape, a run in with his long lost brother, and a balloon ride, everything settles nicely down to a very happy, sweet ending.
The film is perfectly cast.  Jean-Marc Barr traipses through it with suave French heroicism, and Miranda Richardson sparkles as an interesting combination of proper British lady and worldly adventureous.  Anna Friel is fresh faced and innocent, her laugh is infectous and Richard E. Grant kept me laughing.  Jason Iasacs is also notable as St. Ives' brother.
It is a vividly shot film, with the colours bright and pure, and the soundtrack bounces along in perfect accordance to the light, humourous feel of the movie.  In essense, this movie is a miniature feast for the eyes, and the heart.",1087344000,18,1605,4.744604316546763
1631501,5,B00005NB9X,"I didn't know about this movie until I saw it in a video store and being a fan of literature adaptations, I rented it.  I was so pleasantly surprised to find it to be a fun, exciting romp with lots of great performances.  I waited for it to come out on video for sale and when it did I snapped it up. I suggest everyone do the same.",1044230400,,332,3.8676470588235294
1631502,2,B00005NB9X,"Among the few things this flick has going for it are pretty filming locales, lush costumes, warm saturated colors, and golden summer afternoon light.  A romp it is, but one that provides neither enough comic relief to be sufficiently entertaining, nor (lighthearted) substance to be engaging or even remotely memorable.  ""St. Ives"" is buffoonery galore.  Hints of period piece parody and sprinkles of mild witticisms simply aren't enough to elevate the movie above plain silliness.  It isn't an absolute bore per se but too incomplete and predictable to be valued and enjoyed.",1041552000,2,576,5.228260869565218
1631503,5,B00005NB9X,"I first rented this video on a whim, being the literary nut I am.  I found it very refreshing, with its blend of romance, adventure, and sheer naughtiness...and all combined and presented quite gracefully.  Excellent characters, superb scenery and cinematography, and, of course, thanks to Mr. Stevenson, an excellent plot.
Too bad more movies could not be more tastefully engaging and enlightening.",1024444800,,399,5.419354838709677
1631504,4,B00005NB9X,"I bought this film on a whim and will watch it more than once. The DVD version has been digitally mastered and is very beautiful--the blues and reds of the English and French uniforms, the greens of the countryside, the stunning blue of the hot air baloon, the white sand of the coast.
Robert Louis Stevenson, a 19th Century English writer whose illustrious compatriots include Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, and Jane Eyre wrote ST IVES--the book the film is based upon. This tale is somewhat reminiscent of a Jane Austen story with its lover's angst, but it lacks Austen's irony and amazing plot twists. Also, Janie did not include the blood and guts and sex depicted on the screen in ST IVES--but did Robinson? In some ways, ST IVES is more akin to the French tales of the Ancien regime (VALMONT) than the English tales of the Regency period, but unlike the French stories, this tale is relatively upbeat (there are some deaths).
Perhaps one might liken ST IVES to the Scarlet Pimpernel but the hero is a real Frenchman, not an English Aristocrat posing as one. St Ives is also fighting for Napoleon when he isn't dueling ""wanabees"" or chasing pretty women. One day, St Ives finds himself an English prisoner-of-war after back-slapping pal (his second at his numerous duels) unwittingly causes him to slide down an embankment into the waiting arms of British soldiers.
St Ives captors transport him to Scotland, where he is placed under the watchful eye and lock and key of Major Chevening who is a bit resentful of having been kept out of the fracas on the continent. Chevening has been ineffectively courting the delicious Flora, niece of Miss Gilcrist. In an amazing turn of events, Miss Gilchrist (who is extemely worldly) and St. Ives are soon both coaching Major Chevening concerning his courting strategies.
ST IVES is a hero, not the place with kits, cats, sacks and wives as I thought all these years, and the gentleman's name is pronounced ""Santeff"". Miranda Richardson is wonderful as Miss Gilcrist (she is related to the Redgraves and Natasha). Richard Grant is oh so funny as Major Chevening, and he and Miss Gilcrist have some very amusing scenes together. I had not heard of the two younger actors who play St Ives and his love interest, but they are also very good. The plotline of ST IVES is not as well developed as Austen's story PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, if it were it would be as well known, but it is as well developed as NORTHANGER ABBY. The characters are two-dimensional, but real enough that one cares what happens to them. The film's strengths include moments of sadness, humor, and above all lots of love-making.",1017878400,15,2636,4.75764192139738
1631505,5,B00005NB9X,"This movie is a textbook example of building a taut story through emotional conflict and fast-paced action.
At every turn the hero is faced with some new challenge that makes accomplishing his goal just a little more difficult. Along the way, he displays such charm, nobility, and courage you can't help but fall in love with him. This is a hero you would follow from bedroom to battlefield, palace to prison.
This story, and the overwhelming conflict, keeps the reader interested because Stevenson's protagonist has strong emotional appeal.  You find yourself rooting for St. Ives at every turn, groaning when he is captured, gasping when someone he trusts turns on him.
The actors are well cast, especially the delicious Jason Isaacs (Colonel Tavington in The Patriot) as the villain.
The humor is tongue-in-cheek.
A sure hit!",1015027200,6,828,5.088235294117647

1631517,4,B00005NB9X,"I got this film as part of an anthology set of eight British films. I had no idea what to expect other than the blurb, and knowing and liking some of the English actors (Miranda Richardson, Richard E. Grant, Anna Friel).

I was pleasantly surprised at how interesting and charming this film is. It has a fine balance of drama, romance and comedy. It is well-acted, has an captivating story, and the scenery is gorgeous (filmed in Northern Ireland, France and Germany).

It's well-worth seeing.",1364601600,,493,4.788235294117647
1631518,5,B00005NB9X,"I enjoy watching historical stories from time to time and I saw this one on Netflix and was pleasantly surprised.  It's a comedy with a romantic plot, taking place during the napoleonic war, surrounding the lives of a french soldier, a british soldier, and two women with whom they have a romantic interest. When I started watching it, I fully expected the rather dry british humor that typically is portrayed in this type of movie, but I was happy to find the humor was much more playful than what I expected.  The lines and situations proved humorous and a bit self-mocking of the characters, making this movie a delight to behold.",1364342400,,633,4.693693693693693
1631519,1,B00005NB9X,"This movie made absolutely no sense whatsoever, and I fast-forwarded through most of it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, and am not keeping it. No fault of seller, Amazon, etc., but the movie-maker. Awful!!!",1352246400,,210,5.0285714285714285
1631520,3,B00005NB9X,"This is a fair way to spend a couple of hours but not the serious movie I expected.  It is whimsical and cute rather than interesting and I found myself just waiting for it to end.  St. Ives is a French Cavalry officer who is challenged to duels by so many other officers in one day, that if he shows up for the duels he would miss his liaison with a lady.  Instead, he chooses to insult his own commander and is reduced in rank to a private soldier in the infantry, a rank unworthy of dueling with officers, but acceptable to the lady. He is captured by the British and finds his Scotish grandfather that he has never met before, but the grandfather dies after their first meeting and his title and estate is inherited by St. Ives' drunken cousin.  The cousin eventually dies and leaves St. Ives with the title and estates.  Very predictable.",1325203200,,843,4.378205128205129
1631521,4,B00005NB9X,"I love this movie.  The only reason I give it four stars is because some of the attempts at comedy were a bit lame.  But it was a classic love story and I love happy endings.  I think Miranda Richardson was fantastic!  The other actors as well.  I enjoyed the scenery and overall, the movie was done pretty well.  Sometimes simple is more satisfying.",1296172800,,350,4.390625
1631522,2,B00005NB9X,"This movie has a good enough cast, great locations and costumes but it is plagued by flashbacks, trite plot devices and excessive irony!  It can't decide if is a sexy Tom Jones wanna be, a serious BBC type drama or Monty Pythonesque so it goes all over the place and ends up leaving the viewer pretty unengaged in the outcome IMO. Hotty Jason Isaacs (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-State-Within/dp/B000KF0DVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The State Within</a>) is totally wasted here but he wears a great wig and is a proper villain for the brief time he is actually on screen.

1631523,5,B00005NB9X,"St. Ives tosses humor, adventure, romance, and beautiful scenery in France and England into a fanciful coming-of-age tale from the Napoleonic Wars era. As a cross between period history and romance, the story line is plausible and lighthearted.  The characters are pure fun.
Sight gags and word plays and romantic characters are all pure entertainment.

1631524,5,B00005NB9X,"I rented this movie several years ago and then forgot the title so it took me forever to find it.  It was so worth finding!  I love historical movies, but my husband does not.  Because of the humor and action in this one, he actually liked it.

The plot moves quickly from Napoleon Era France to Scotland and then back to France. The characters of Jacques, Flora, and Aunt Susan are portrayed well, but the best is Richard Grant as Major Farquar, who is clueless, yet, steadfast and honest.  He is the center of most of the comical scenes.  The movie includes comedy, romance, mystery, and action, a hard combination to find in period movies.  If your one who finds these types of movies `slow' and `boring', this one is definitely not.",1243641600,,736,4.53030303030303
1631525,3,B00005NB9X,"St. Ives is a pleasant,light hearted diversion.  I'm a big fan of costume /adventure drama,with lots of duelling.  This is well cast,with Anna Friel a lovely young actress I havn't seen a lot of in the past,and Richard E Grant stealing every scene,with his sly humour,and sending up his Scarlet Pimpernal image at every opportunity. Not much in the way of a serious duelling sequence to highlight the clash of the good guy/bad guy big finish,but Peter Diamond staged a couple of brief Skirmishs,and Jason Evers is always a seriously good bad guy, as anyone will know who saw "" The Patriot "".
