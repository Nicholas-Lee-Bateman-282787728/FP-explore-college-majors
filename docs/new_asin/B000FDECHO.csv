8120985,4,B000FDECHO,Yes indeed!  The two most compelling personalities in this unique German film are the assassin and the detective hard on his trail.  It becomes a complex story where the audience cannot help but to root for the criminal and hope his path does not end in either imprisonment or death.,1360540800,,283,4.64
8120986,1,B000FDECHO,it has been a month now - I have never waited this long on the Internet. i know they gave me the window until March 3rd. i kind of knew it then but was hoping they would not push it till the very last moment...,1235433600,,210,3.688888888888889
8120987,5,B000FDECHO,"This is one of the best films of 2008 and what delights me is it's not from the cookie cutter factory, that is Hollywood. Slick but with a plot that evokes emotions.
 I enjoy the way this director lets the story unfold beautifully and i also love the perfect sparks of chemistry between the talented actors. It's deep but not the kind that dozes you off. It's a story that will make you understand fully why some people just know how to do a particular job and nothing else.
 Words of caution though: Not for those who likes wham-bam action and lots of explosions. You know, those flicks that makes your senses turn deaf and soundless...",1225152000,,637,4.482758620689655
8120988,3,B000FDECHO,"SOUNDLESS, of Mennan Yapo, is an intellectual movie, of a

style that has been made popular with C.S.I on television,

for example. It brings to the forefront, the most

advanced forensics techniques used by police

investigations, to pursue,  arrest and prosecute the

most sophisticated professional contract killers in the

world.

Having many visually appealing elements, from an

outstanding photographic quality, and the many scenes filmed in

the outdoors, I would assume in Germany or Scandinavia, it

also prominently shows the photogenic actress, Nadja Uhl, who

interesting contributes a more human and very subtle dramatic

touch to the movie, that  (as said) is mostly intellectual

in its approach, and distasteful in the type of work the

main character does (contract deaths.)

That leading actor, Joachim Krol, does a fine job, of

putting forth the bizarre, almost unsustainable,

closed-universe lifestyle of a dealer of death, as the

contracts are handed over to him, by an arms dealer, who

himself, learned his trade in the Second World War, and must

go completed, in an untraceable manner.

The downside, of this picture, is the lack of realism. We

are expected to believe, that a blond bombshell, would

jump off a bridge, in despair of her one-night stand

having been killed in a contract, gets saved by the killer, and

then, as a form of gratitude, she follows him down the

path to Death, Despair and Destruction.

The audience will have a hard time accepting this as

minimally credible, and won't like the ending that seems

to condone this type of eccentric ""advanced civilization""

capitalism (taking out your opponents.)

On the other hand, the audience  will be entertained

by the numerous visually appealing aspects, the originality,

and very  subtle acting, and cool soundtrack, that combine to

deliver a good measure of suspense and thrill to viewers.",1169856000,2,1895,5.172757475083056
8120989,4,B000FDECHO,"LAUTLOS (Soundless) is yet another film by Director/writer Mennan Yapo (with writing assists form Lars-Olaf Beier) that takes on a story of a hit man on his last job and makes it into a fine psychological thriller.  The cinematography, lighting, music and pacing of this strangely dark film provide an excellent background for a superb cast of actors.

Viktor (Joachim Kr&oacute;l) is an aging hit man, a perfectionist whose reputation as a genius killer includes the fact that he works so well that he is soundless in his paid executions.  We are privy to his mind's working as he focuses on his last hit, a man with a lady in his room Nina (the very beautiful Nadja Uhl) whose life he spares in the hit, an act of emotional response to the beautiful woman but an act that causes his employer to set a mark on him for his failure.  Viktor saves Nina from suicide and the two become enchanted with each other.  Viktor has found love at the end of his career as a murderer: Nina wants to get to know Viktor better before committing to his advances.  Enter the police headed by the brilliant Lang (Christian Berkel) who is determined to capture Viktor by studying his patterns and mind tracings.  Viktor and Nina are on the run but with a goal - that they will join at the sea and leave the life of crime.  But before this can happen they must go through a literal wall of flames (a touch of Wagner, here).  How the cat and mouse chase comes into play and resolves is the satisfying end to this polished little thriller.

Kr&oacute;l, Uhl, and  Berkel (in addition to a fine supporting cast) make this tense drama intimate and penetrating and Yapo's direction keeps the pace breathless.  This is a fine little thriller in German with English subtitles.  Grady Harp, November 06",1164585600,4,1775,4.579113924050633

The plotting has some distinct similarities to the Princess and Warrior film, but stands nicely on it's own.
