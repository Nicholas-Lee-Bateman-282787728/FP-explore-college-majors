I like that it was as gross as many of the other Nicktoon, very family friendly, it does have its groaner moments though, and occasion spots where you go, could have done without that.",1454716800,,259,4.416666666666667

8176056,5,B000NA21WW,"My wife and I loved watching this series with our 17 year old daughter.  Ya it's kind of campy and corny in spots, but the characters are very engaging and I really like the moral lessons.

I strongly recommend watching the series in order as they build off of each other.

I heard that they were going to make a live action movie based on this.  I hope it happens!",1214870400,,365,4.171428571428572
8176057,5,B000NA21WW,"I'm not going to lie to you. This is my first ever review so if I mess up a little bit then please forgive me. First off, lemme say that Avatar: The Last Airbender is a great series for all ages! If you are into martial arts then it's perfect for you. Now to the nitty, gritty. This dvd is definitely one to add to you collection in the series. It's just my opinion of course. I don't like to tell much about shows and movies but I will tell you to watch the episode of when Team Avatar goes up against The Drill. That's the one that sold me. the fifth episode was great also. Just my opinion. You don't have to take my word for it. Just watch it and see for yourself.",1185062400,2,668,3.9555555555555557
