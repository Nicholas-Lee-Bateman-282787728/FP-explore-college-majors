5016421,5,B006TTC5J0,"IMPORTANT NOTE, ADDED JUNE 22, 2012: This review was originally posted to the Universal 100th Anniversary Classic Monsters DVD 4-pack that includes Dracula, Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein and Creature from the Black Lagoon. However, Amazon has seen fit (as they so often do) to ALSO post the reviews for this product on the listing for the SECOND Universal Monsters 4-pack, which comes out in the fall of 2012, and which does NOT contain these films, but four other classic monster films: WOLF MAN, INVISIBLE MAN, PHANTOM OF THE OPERA and THE MUMMY. Please don't think that I placed it there myself, if that's where you happen to be reading it. Thanks.

ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE, ADDED DEC. 31, 2012: Due to Amazon's inexplicable policy of porting reviews from one product listing to other listings (regardless of whether the products are the same!), I'm unable to properly review the SECOND ""Classic Monsters"" 4 disc collection under it's own listing as my review of the FIRST set already appears there, and Amazon does not allow ""multiple"" reviews on what it perceives to be the same product. As such, both the first AND second Classic Monsters collections have the same 38 reviews (as I write this), nearly all of which should ONLY be attached to the product listing for the first set. Thus I've no choice but to pad this review out a bit further to encompass BOTH sets, I've opted to include details about the bonus features for each of the four discs in the second set (THE MUMMY, THE WOLF MAN, THE INVISIBLE MAN and THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA) underneath the product details for the four discs in the first set, as outlined further down this review. Suffice it to say that the for those who've not seen these films (and let's face it, potential new fans are being born every day!) and those weary of emptying their wallets for the recently released deluxe Blu-ray Collection, the second DVD set is every bit as worthwhile as the first, and likewise repackages the four 1999 DVD releases, complete with copious special features.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

You'll probably read many reviews slagging this release for simply repackaging the original 1999 DVD releases of these films. That's exactly what they are, so for those of you who already own those excellent releases, or better yet, later upgraded to the more-inclusive ""Legacy Collections"" (with the originals and their many sequels in slick packaging) or the 75th Anniversary ultra-deluxe Legacy editions of DRACULA and FRANKENSTEIN, you're better off waiting for the Blu-ray editions, which were announced so late in 2011 that only a fool would think that this edition--which blatantly re-uses the sleeve artwork from the 1999 editions on its cover--somehow contained new hi-def remasters (or what have you) this soon after the announcement was made.

Universal's 100th Anniversary line is, in fact, almost entirely made up of repackaged OLD DISCS. Is it some insidious plot to slap movie fans (and especially Universal Monster movie fans) in the face? Of course not. Is it a way for a major media company to re-purpose old stock that was no longer selling? Of course it is, and I say more power to them, especially if it gets these four classic films into the hands of people who've never seen them before at a compelling price point that won't strain one's finances. I always find it puzzling that many supposed hardcore fans of these films, the ones who moan the loudest every time something is re-issued, seem to think that EVERYONE ELSE has seen all the great movies out there just like they have, when nothing could be farther from the truth; new movie buffs are born every day. In fact, a child born in 1999 would be 13 years old right now, the PERFECT AGE to take a crack at these old gems. I'm sure most kids today might scoff at them, but if even a handful come to appreciate them in the context in which they're presented on these special edition discs, and at a bargain price point, then the repackaging of these titles (and another four that are coming in Vol. 2 later in the year) will not have been in vain.

That said, you can safely assume--nay, expect--that this set will drop in price as the year progresses. I wouldn't be surprised at all if it hits the ten dollar mark at some point, perhaps even on Amazon, and that's for four discs that many of us happily shelled out twenty bucks a pop for back in 1999, many with drool pouring from our mouths because we were finally able to see them on such a technologically superior format to our old video tapes and laserdiscs. Well, subsequent, improved DVD editions (of some titles, anyways, but NOT all of them) have apparently spoiled people enough that they'll see fit to piss all over this release and steer everyone away from it. I can only hope if you haven't seen these films before, you'll ignore the unfairly negative reviews (after all , the CONTENT of these discs drew near-unanimous praise back in 1999, some of which still holds up today) and give this set a shot.

As I write this, neither the Amazon listing nor the other reviews gives you any idea of what's actually included in this set. So here's what you get:

DRACULA Bonus Features:
- The Road To Dracula, an original documentary
- Commentary by David J. Skal (which is excellent, by the way, as are all of the others)
- New score by Philip Glass and the Kronos Quartet

5016422,1,B006TTC5J0,"The films themselves deserve 5 stars across the board but this particular release should get no stars!  For anyone that owns these films on vhs, laserdisc or the previous dvd releases you can just skip this collection!!  I haven't purchased this myself....oh wait yes I have back in 2000...but I'm hearing that these discs are just printed (or left over stock) from the 1999 releases!  That's right you don't even get the 2004 Legacy editions nor the 75th anniversary editions (Dracula/Frankenstein only) with this release!  If you simply can't go without another Universal Monster release then wait for the Blu-rays to hit later this year, I'm told those prints are absolutely gorgeous!  Universal is the apparent master of repackaging a product!

If you have somehow just crawled out from under a rock (or maybe you are a younger demographic) and discovered the Universal Monsters then you may want to pick this up; I personally would advise to just look into the Legacy dvd collections though.  Again that is the Legacy dvd collections!

Each one is a classic that everyone should see at least once.  Can you imagine being an adolescent kid in 1931 or 1932 watching Dracula and Frankenstein in a darkened movie theater?  Can you imagine the screams from the audience?  Just imagining those things make these worth enjoying after all these years.,1437177600,,458,4.896103896103896

So this is a real treat to bring these 4 films together for a very good price. One little note for 'The Creature.' About a couple of years ago, I went to a midnight screening, But the real reason was that it was going to be shown in all it original 3D glory. This version hardly gets shown, but it is amazing to see how the 3D was woven into the story. I loved it. If you ever get a chance to see in 3D, go for it. It will show the difference between planning to use 3D as part of the story vs slapping it on just to charge $4 more.",1436572800,,689,3.964028776978417

The movies boot-up quickly and lack the promotional crap we usually get before the feature.
These movies were released in 1931 (Drac), 1931 (Frank), 1935 (Bride) and 1954(CFTBL).
Overall the films are very good in every category and enjoyable.
The production value and special effects are also very good.
They are not mind-blowing like Wizard of Oz, but still solidly impressive.

My kids and I enjoyed these a lot.
I am glad my kids can see these movies and compare them to modern films.

However, it needs to be noted these are NOT remastered copies and when you watch the movies you see a lot of grainy texture in the film and there are white dots coming across the screens during the movies.

5016556,5,B006TTC5J0,"These four are classics as anyone can guess. Universal always finds the right atmosphere in their classic movies and the black and white adds to the beauty of these classics. There are four DVDs with up to five movies in Dracula, Spanish Dracula, Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, and Creature from the Black Lagoon.

Dracula is very similar to Nosferatu only with the best Dracula possible in Bela Lugosi. Bela owns this role and really steals the show. There is also a bonus of the Spanish Dracula added onto the Dracula disc. Spanish Dracula is superior to the American version in every way except in who plays Dracula. Carlos isn't quite on Bela's level, but he's not bad. The extra dialogue and better camerawork keep Spanish Dracula as the definite Dracula film(despite the lack of Lugosi). Both are moody films with a dark romantic element to them. Frankenstein has awesome scenery and legendary sets. This story despite its simplicity resonates with anyone. Frankenstein is driven by great character work and like Dracula relatively short. Bride of Frankenstein is superior to the original Frankenstein. I would say it is a little more similar to the book in a way. The inclusion of a possible female Monster makes the film even better with different complexities. It also has a lot of the same scenery. Lastly, we have Creature from the Black Lagoon. This film looks gorgeous and tells the simple story of an unknown species.

All these films are classics that everyone in the family can enjoy. They all have unique sets and a dark atmosphere that is sure to entertain, and for 10-11 dollars you get four of the most classic movies ever.",1413331200,4,1649,4.864768683274021

Shame on you Universal. These types of old movies should look good no matter what format they are on, universal simply dropped the ball.

If you still have that VHS copy and a VHS player, you might as well pass. If you guys at Universal read this, nobody has CRT 4:3 TVs anymore, we view DVDs now on 16x9 TVs using HDMI Upscaling DVD players. You might need to invest in new equipment that isn't tuned towards things nobody owns. All you had to do was use the existing HD copy and transfer it to the DVD instead of making a whole new washed out version. I will not buy anymore of these collections until the quality surpasses that of my VHS copy. It's worse than that Echo Bridge garbage.",1395446400,,853,4.33125

5016631,4,B006TTC5J0,"The movies are good but the audio on some of the disks is messed up. With Frankenstein I had to turn the volume all the way up to be able to hear anything at all.

Also, it's a little bit deceptive to describe these as horror movies. For the life of me I can't figure out what's supposed to be scary about Frankenstein. And the only frightening scene in Bride of Frankenstein is one that the monster isn't in.",1395187200,,409,4.177215189873418

To show how strongly I feel about these, I already had the two Frankenstein movies, and I bought this just for Dracula and Creature from the Black Lagoon.  You can see how movie making has changed, by watching these. Pay close attention to the sound track in Bride of Frankenstein.  You'll notice some of the same music used in the old Flash Gordon series.",1392940800,2,527,4.811111111111111

5016637,3,B006TTC5J0,"Depending on your tastes, this package is 2 classic Frankenstein movies, 1 average and badly dated Dracula movie, and 1 ridiculous Creature from the Black Lagoon movie.  In the 2 Frankenstein movies I really enjoyed the bonus extras.  It was riveting to hear how both movies came about.  They interviewed Karloff's daughter and some of the surviving people from the production of it.  The original Frankenstein and the Bride of is so fantastic.  I had not seen Dracula in a long time, now I remember why.  Lugosi can not act at all. And the audio in Dracula is poor, and the pace of the movie tedious. The CFTBL is so absurd it's not even worth analyzing.  But, was this DVD package worth buying?  Sure.",1391299200,,703,4.612903225806452

5016642,5,B006TTC5J0,The collection and price for this DVD set is for lack of a better word remarkable. As a young Frankenstein lover I'm overwhelmed with the amount of bonus features and enhances on the videos.  Being an admirer of the black and white cinema and how they relied on acting to make the movie a hit rather than computerized special effects I'm impressed and constantly surprised no matter how many times the movie is played. An incredible price for unmistakably the most memorable characters to pave the way for cinema today! High recommend from this fan!,1388966400,2,549,4.778947368421052
5016643,5,B006TTC5J0,"The Dracula disk alone makes it worth it.  The video is either restored  or they found a real negative to copy.  And, it really shows the acting ability of Bela Lugosi.

And watching them makes me remember the old TV shows in Chicago always on a Friday night when they would play these films over and over.... My Favorite one is Bride of Frankenstien. I reminds me of another movie Gods and Monsters, where the same thing is said in both movies. Anyway if your young enough to remember these movies I give them a big A+ ... How often can you watch 4 movies in little time as 4 and half hours?  for the time they where made they are great.....",1383782400,2,641,4.128
5016673,5,B006TTC5J0,"Like a lot of people, I grew up seeing black and white horror movies. At that time you could see two movies plus several cartoon features for about 25 cents.  This fantastic collection has four classic movies and at a bargain price.  They include: Dracula, one of the first ones ever produced.  Frankenstein, which is the first original one made, as well as the classic The Bride of Frankenstein.  The last movie in this collection I recall seeing the first time in an old movie theater,  which is The Creature from the Black Lagoon.

I enjoyed viewing these movies again in this DVD.  Yes, it is true that these old films are sometimes a little unclear but that does not take away from the enjoyment of seeing these classic old movies in the DVD format.

In conclusion, if you are a horror movie buff, and enjoy seeing the early black and white versions of these old classics, you may want to check out this DVD collection.

5016699,4,B006TTC5J0,"Of the four movies, The Creature from the Black Lagoon does not really fit with the other 3 movies - one reason because it was from the 1950s, instead of the early 1930s like the other 3 (Dracula, Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein).  Better choices would have been either The Mummy or The Invisible Man from the same era.  I have not bought the other collection - the inclusion of Nelson Eddy in a musical version of The Phantom of the Opera is not appealing to me.  Apparently, the idea of Universal for these collections was 3 great movies, 1 not-so-great, instead of 4 great, classic horror films.",1371772800,,602,4.607476635514018

5016713,4,B006TTC5J0,"I'm a huge horror movie fan & no one can deny that these 4 are true classics. Horror films today are very different from what they used to be, it's nice to have a look back at the old ones & see the progression over the years.

The DVDs: Good condition, ideally they'd be BluRay, however, that'd cost a lot more money & they didn't have this exact set available on BluRay anyways. Unfortunately, I was so excited about the DVD set that I didn't realize they're all Full-Frame, I prefer Widescreen & from what other people have said, it seems most people do as well; this is why I rated it 4/5 instead of the full 5/5.

Packaging: They come in a standard DVD case, so it's nothing overly exciting, but I didn't need overly exciting to make me happy. I love how all 4 DVDs fit in the 1 case, this saves a lot of room on my DVD shelf.

Overall: For the price, it's a great addition to the collection. I could've paid $8.99 for Creature from the Black Lagoon alone, or for just a few dollars more add the rest of the monster crew, the choice was obvious. I recommend this, however, if you're a big spender, go for the BluRay collection which has a lot more movies, but again, it's about $90-$100 (depending where you buy) so it'll set you back a fair bit, but again, you get more movies. Being a fan of all 4 of these movies, I'm content with this set.",1369872000,4,1348,4.196911196911197

5016715,5,B006TTC5J0,"These are 4 great Universal films nicely packaged who may not be ready for Blu ray.  Well preserved in one collection.  Here are reviews of each film:

DRACULA (5.0 Stars)

The well-known tale stars Bela Lugosi in his most recognizable role. The Hungarian actor also played the character in the stage production from which much is adapted for this early talking picture. Some will snicker at the mannerisms and heightened theatrics more common in the theater. Even as a great admirer of the movie, I chuckle when I see a couple armadillos scurrying across Dracula's Transylvanian castle.

Lugosi, still struggling with English accentuates his dialog not only with an unusual cadence, enunciating each syllable but seemingly each letter. But Bela was a charmer, especially of the ladies which transformed the Count from the Dracula in Bram Stoker's novel and the first production on film, ""Nosferatu, a Symphony of Horror"" (1922). In F. W. Murnau's film, the Count (Orlok) was ugly, sinister and more in tune with what Stoker had in mind.

One of the things that always bothered me about the film was the lack of a musical score. The story has extended moments of silence, except for noise coming from old tape or DVD transfers. The cleaned up version here, eliminates almost all of the surface noise, and makes the silence even more...well silent. I much prefer the added Philip Glass score performed by The Kronos Quartet. I was fortunate to see Glass perform this live accompanying the film a few years ago in Dallas.

FRANKENSTEIN (4.5 Stars)

The best thing here is Boris Karloff, as Dr. Frankenstein's creation. Watch his near mute (he does grunt and growl) performance. Like many of the silent films a few years earlier, actors have to use their movement, their eyes and facial expression to communicate feelings. And Karloff is masterful in this performance. Can't say enough about him.

Troubled actor Colin Clive is also excellent as Frankenstein. Dwight Frey as Fritz and Edward Van Sloan return after their similar performances in ""Dracula."" The story of course is based on an early 19th century story by Mary Shelley. All of this wouldn't have happened of course but for some great direction from James Whale and masterful makeup from Jack Pierce. So what's wrong? Quibbles admittedly, but still.

First when the monster is on the loose on day of the doc's wedding to lovely Elizabeth (Mae Clarke), Frankenstein thinks he hears the monster inside the house. He gathers a search party of staffers and locks Elizabeth in her room ""to keep her safe."" Say what? Of course, the creature enters though an open window. Then there is the issue of the little Maria (Marilyn Harris) who is playfully tossed into the lake by her cottage by the creature. Fortunately this once censured scene was rightfully restored. Her father finds the girl (off camera) and marches into the village carrying her dead body claiming she had been murdered. Huh? Couldn't she just have drowned on her own? And why did he teach her how to swim anyway? Great sets, especially the flowing electricity in the laboratory, excellent acting and a timeless story overcome any shortcomings.

THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (5.0 Stars)

This true sequel to director James Whale's 1931 masterpiece is considered by most critics to be even superior. Certainly from a production standpoint, it is hard to argue against it. This movie actually continues the story originated by Mary Shelley in 1816. In fact, like ""Frankenstein,"" the movie opens with Mary (Elsa Lanchester), Lord Byron (Gavin Gordon) and Percy Shelley (Douglas Walton) once again in flashback, discussing Mary's horror novel during a thunderstorm. This was a scene Whale insisted on recreating.

Back to the present day, the story picks up where ""Frankenstein"" left off. The monster is trapped inside a burning windmill and Dr. Frankenstein is near death after being thrown off by the monster. He recovers, but is forced to help a strange former teacher, Dr. Pretorius (fey Ernest Thesiger). Pretorius had his own success with creating life. Whale and screenwriter William Hurlbut struggled with censors as the film hints at homosexuality, necrophilia and has numerous religious connotations.

Boris Karloff returns as the monster and once again is terrific, this time more sympathetic in spite of the fact he kills more people than he did in his first outing. Both he and Colin Clive, once again Henry Frankenstein, were injured before and during the movie causing additional complications for Whale. A 17 year old British actress, Valerie Hobson replaces Mae Clarke as Elizabeth, Henry's fiance. She has a couple meaty scenes and pulls them off nicely.

As a kid I mostly remembered Pretorius's little people which he created and housed in jars. A lightened moment in what was still a frightening film. The best scenes however are given to Lanchester who also portrays the ""Bride"" complete with herky-jerky head movements and the now iconic lightning bolt hairdo. Pretorius also utters a couple quips that become important to the future. When the lady monster comes alive, he calls her the Bride of Frankenstein not the Bride of the Monster. Is that how the monster became known by many as ""Frankenstein?"" He also announces the successful reanimation declaring ""gods and monsters,"" the name of a 1998 biopic about James Whale.

The movie is enhanced by some excellent photography (Stephen M. Katz), makeup (Jack Pierce returning), special effects (John P. Fulton) and an amazing musical score by Franz Waxman. Note how each main character has his/her own musical announcement. This is one of the great horror movies. Make that one of the great movies of all time.

CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON (4.5 Stars)

I remember my mother gathering my 2 brothers and me, decked in our PJs, into the family Plymouth and heading to the drive-in movie theater. I was a kid. It was a big deal. It was 3-D! Among others on the bill, was the ""Creature From The Black Lagoon."" The 3-D gimmick has come and gone a few times since then and appeared to have made a real comeback recently. Yet, checking out the Sunday ads in the paper (Best Buy, Fry's, Target, Tiger Direct), there was not one featuring a 3-D TV for sale. In any case, I watched this Blu ray disc in good old fashion 2-D and it looks better than ever.

The story centers on a group of scientists who find a large webbed hand and part of an arm in the Brazilian Amazon. Believed to be a water creature, scientists who are also scuba divers are recruited. Among them are David (Richard Carlson) and Mark, his boss (Richard Denning) both playing for the affections of statuesque Kay (Julie Adams). While the story is pretty much a straight forward beauty and the beast, director Jack Arnold and his team create an above average ""horror"" film.

The movie was essentially shot in two locations. One was the Universal Studios lot and some of the shots are well done, but others are limited to the technical capabilities of the time. All of the underwater filming was done in a Florida grotto and they are remarkably well done, especially when you remember that the film was shot in 3-D using the big and cumbersome cameras of the era. The creature, even with a rubber suit is plenty creepy given its human characteristics.

The most memorable scene (and yes, one I remember as a kid) is when Kay decides to go swimming in the lagoon in her white, and brief for the day, one piece suit. With the camera in the water shooting upward to the surface we see the shadowed silhouette of Kay gracefully swimming across the surface. Yeah, that got my attention, then and now...and more importantly, that of the creature. Director Steven Spielberg must have remembered that scene too (see ""Jaws""). This goes on for a while and the creature joins in, swimming upside down below Eve. Great swimming by Ricou Browning who played the creature in the underwater scenes.

While the creature manages to kill a few crew members, it was he who was attacked first and he doesn't seem to have menace in mind when it comes to Eve. Mostly we are sympathetic to his plight. He's lonely. He wants a friend. My only complaint with the film is that each time the creature is featured, we get a menacing, shrill brass section musical blast. It's very annoying and unnecessary given the otherwise excellent score.",1367193600,3,8358,4.879407616361072

These 2 DVD's are on sale for $150.00 at TCM, in one box, with the same exact films, but with additional features about the making of the films, interviews, and whatever they could throw in. This is a gift for my Dad, who watches a lot of late night television, so I know that he's either either already seen the additional information about these films, or would Never bother to watch the additional information on the DVD's (""Special Features"" is a swear word in our home). Paying @14.99 per DVD ($5 dollars cheaper than these individual DVD's on TCM as well) and saving me $120.00, makes me happy. My Dad gets the best 8 horror flicks of all times, and I get the happiness of giving him a gift I know he will use, in its entirety, not ignored, or tossed aside partially used. This is one of the best win-win presents I've ever given him.

I may have failed to mention that my Dad and I were watching an old movie on Turner Classic Movies and he was saying that it was too bad they never show the black and white Horror Flicks he grew up loving, his particular favorite being Creature from the Black Lagoon, when an ad came on for the $150.00 box set of all 8 of these films. He went on and on for awhile about the ridiculous price, and who needs those Bleeping Spec*$^ Featu$@& anyway. He watches a lot of the Biography Channel, so he pretty much saw all the interviews they'd include. He went on about how they're selling them instead of showing them, and oh, what a waste. I was so pleased to find that not only could I get this very nice gift for him, but I could get it at a much lower price. Which, if I told him about, he'd be very proud of me. As it is, I know there's no chance he'll open the Special Features portion anyway, so it'll be our little secret.",1355270400,6,2355,5.020460358056266

5016778,5,B006TTC5J0,"""Dracula"" (5) - The Count leaves his 3 wives behind in Transylvania and takes his coffins of native resting soil to Carfax Abbey, just outside of London, where he will have access to countless, supple feminine necks. . . .
Includes a Spanish version ( it is not a dubbed version).  Bonus Feature: ""The Road to Dracula"" is worth a watch.
Menu quirk:  You can not access the menu for Subtitles & Bonus Materials, until the movie begins playing.

""Frankenstein"" (5) - Frankenstein was proud of what he had created, until Dr. Waldman revealed that the brain, Frankenstein's assistant had stolen, was that of a criminal.  Frankenstein was soon to be horrified by what his new creation had done: the monster's first two murders were in self-defense, but the third ... was the death of innocence. . . .
Bonus Feature: ""The Frankenstein Films"" is also worth a watch.  Menu quirk: same.

""The Bride of Frankenstein"" (5+) - As it turns out, Henry Frankenstein was not the only one to create life;  Dr. Pretorius had created a collection of miniature human beings, but what he longed for was to create a new race;  what was needed was a woman, and with Frankenstein's help, they could create a mate for the monster ... to be fruitful and multiply. . . .
Menu quirk: same.

""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" (3) - A webbed, clawed hand is found sticking out of a riverbank.  A small group of scientists steam up an Amazon tributary to a lagoon to hunt for other prehistoric samples, but what they discover instead is that this species is not extinct, and now, it becomes a question of just who is hunting who. . . .
Overall: Slow paced; many bubbling scuba swimming scenes; the creature is quiet detailed, even the soles of its feet.

The product came in the mail today, and it arrived in great condition. It had 4 great movies for a great price. The movies included were, Dracula, Frankenstein, The Bride of Frankenstein, and Creature from the Black Lagoon. These are the 1999 DVD versions of the films, but the quality was pretty good for these older movies. I just watched Frankenstein on my Play Station 3, and it looked great. I know the picture is not as good as the Blu-ray set, but it still looked very impressive. I love all of these films, but Frankenstein and The Bride of Frankenstein still remain my favorites(Frankenstein is probably the first horror movie I ever saw).Dracula is another one of my favorites. Bela Lugosi is classic as Dracula. Creature from the Black Lagoon was good, but not great. Over all,the quality is great, and you could watch these over and over again. And what more would you ask than that?",1353369600,16,1186,5.706214689265536

5016809,5,B006TTC5J0,These four classics brought back great memories of my first monster movie experiences.  I ordered these films to watch them with my two daughters (ages 19 & 22) and we had a Halloween Monster Film Festival complete with popcorn and movie snacks.  I was surprised at how much they enjoyed the old films without today's modern special effects - they really appreciated the acting and classic portrayals.  My daughters agreed that Bela Lugosi's performance set the standard for modern vampires.,1352505600,,491,5.1125
