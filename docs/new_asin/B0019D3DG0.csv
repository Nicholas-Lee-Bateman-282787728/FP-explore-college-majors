8273600,4,B0019D3DG0,The King of the cage match is what you should focus on when watching this dvd.  The match has some crazy bumps and high flying by some heavyweights.,1484611200,,148,4.285714285714286
8273601,5,B0019D3DG0,"TNA Slammiversary 2008 was a great show. The main event was awesome. I had mixed feelings about it though as I wanted Booker T to win the belt. I think Booker T was a big signing and I think it was disappointing he was never given a title run even if brief. I would have liked him win then drop the belt back to Joe. But I agree Joe needed to have a strong run as champ as his time was long overdue. If Angle never came to TNA he would be champion long before. Robert Roode gained some great experience and he at the time long deserved to be in the main event. His feuds with Eric Young and Booker T were okay but he spent too much time feuding with them as he should be chasing the title. I was satisfied with Christian's run in TNA. I think it was a big loss when he left but he achieved all he could there. The main event delivered and it was a big match for a lot of wrestlers to gain experience, show they could still be in the hunt and Joe prove me to be a dominant champion.

  AJ Styles vs Kurt Angle was an awesome match. It was the match of the night but I liked The Joe match better as I was cheering for Booker T to win the belt. But Kurt and AJ never had a bad match together. Kurt Angle always gets the best match out of the wrestler he is wrestling and AJ is a great wrestler. I think AJ wrestled with a lot more passion as being pushed to the side with others being spotlighted he still wanted to prove he was The Franchise of TNA.

  The Lethal and So Val Cal Wedding was a lot of fun. Having legends like Jake The Snake and George The Animal Steele apart of the Wedding made it fun. I loved The Black Machismo gimmick. I thought Sonjay Dutt was a great wrestler and I was happy he would be put in a good storyline with Lethal. It was good fun.

  Awesome Kong Open Challenge this was good too as Kong is a great attraction and one of my favorite womens wrestlers one of the best in the recent years. My favorite Knockout will always be Gail Kim. But Kong on any card is great.

  LAX vs Team 3D was great. They are two good tag teams. Team 3D has to be one of the greatest tag teams of all time and rarely do they have a bad match. LAX was a great tag team and it showed in this match. Team 3D helped out these guys as LAX is still a young team learning. They haven't the accomplishments and years under their belt as Team 3D but they have done pretty well so far.

  Gail Kim, O.D.B., Roxxi vs. Angelina Love, Velvet Sky, Moose. This was a great match The Knockouts Division was pretty strong at this point and this match rocked. I love Gail Kim and her in any match delivers. All the other females wrestlers are great too. Fun fact check out Gail Kim in 'Ninja's Creed' a movie she stars in that she does a great job in.

  In the end this is one of the better TNA PPVS in history. It was strong with AJ and Kurt was 5 star match as always. The Joe match was awesome and my favorite. I believe it was great Joe finally got his title run. Though I was hoping Booker T would pull out a win. I think Booker T had been buried in WWE and wasted. He did get a title run there but he had a lot to offer a company as he did in WCW. But I think Booker T was getting older and TNA made their call in going with Joe which was the future. Very exciting and great PPV! Check it out!",1433376000,,3289,3.927710843373494

8273603,3,B0019D3DG0,"The Petey Williams-Kaz-X Division title match was a pretty good opener. The 6 woman tag team match was ok but forgettalbe. The L.A.X-Team 3D-TNA World tag team title match was a solid tag match at best. Awesome Kong's $25,000 Fan Challenge matches were mindless/one-sided fillers. The A.J. Styles-Kurt Angle match was a hard-hitting,smash-mouth,back-and-forth showstealer. The King of the Mountain match while not a bad brawl,it's pretty forgettable. I give this event a 5 out of 10.",1303084800,,483,5.368421052631579
8273604,2,B0019D3DG0,"Kaz VS Petey Williams: This was a great opening match. I thought Scott Steiner would screw up the match but Kaz fights him off, but he lands right into a Canadian destroyer. Abyss then comes back and takes out Steiner and company.

Gail Kim, O.D.B., Roxxi VS Angelina Love, Velvet Sky, Moose: Since i'm into TNA more, I should watch the knock out division. Well maybe one day but not today. I skipped over this one.

LAX VS Team 3-D: I have not really got much into LAX. This was a decent tag match and the ending was good but confusing. Was this a Texas tornado match?

Awesome Kong's Open Challenge: This is why it took me to get into TNA. This was a segement on Impact and they should have kept it that way. I can understand if a former WWE diva took the challenge but it was just a couple of unknown wrestlers. Then Eric Young brings in Elvis, yikes. Not what i'd like to see on a ppv.

Jay Lethal and So Cal wedding: Wow, this is bad. They bring back a bunch of wrestling ""legends"" including hall of famer, Koko B Ware! This was a basic way to advance a Jay Lethal and Sonjay Dutt feud. The legends get into it towards the end.

Kurt Angle VS AJ Styles: I saw Tomko and cringed. Luckily, the ref sends him to the back within the first five minutes of the match. The dvd lists the match as a grudge match but it was just a regular match. It was good but hardly a classic. Karen Angle hands her former husband a chair but she holds onto it and Styles hit his finisher and wins.

King of The Mountain with champion Samoa Joe VS Christian Cage VS Robert Roode VS Booker T VS Rhino: I like to think Rhino as a Big Show or Kane type of wrestler. There around and eventually he'll have something to do and people will remember why he was so good. I really only care for Cage and Joe in this match. Cage was the MVP of this match and he did some awesome spots. Now I prefer TNA, it's sad to know that Cage will be misused till he either leaves for TNA or retires. The match was excellent but hardly worth the price of the dvd.

Overall, a pretty bad PPV. I've seen 90% of TNA ppvs from 2005 to current and cannot recall one that features only one x-division match. This looked more like a WWE ppv line up then a TNA line up. It also looked more like a Impact epsiode rather then a PPV, despite a awesome main event. Too many interviews and skits make for a forgetable event. Get this dvd when Don West does the 2008 PPV deal, where you can get all the ppvs from 2008.",1239840000,,2464,4.11018711018711
8273605,5,B0019D3DG0,this is one of the slammiversary's ppv i saw if you like tna then you should get it.,1222992000,,84,3.7222222222222223
8273606,4,B0019D3DG0,"X Division Champion Petey Williams vs. Kaz - For the first time in two months, the X division gets a regular match instead of some type of caged cluster.  They didn't do anything heavily fast paced or ""spotty"" like the typical X division match but concidering how each person is not at 100% going into this (Kaz's arm & Petey's eye), this was a good solid encounter between the two that wasn't the sterotypical ""X division spotfest"" but the moment to look out for was Kaz being busted open & the aftermath when The Monster Abyss returned & got his hands on everyone in the ring...including Rhaka Khan.

Gail Kim, O.D.B., Roxxi vs. Angelina Love, Velvet Sky, Moose - Just like how the X division match was the first time in two months where they didn't just just cram everyone in the division into one match, the same goes for the knockouts here & you get the same result.  A solid match that was fun to watch with some nice storytelling & selling by The Beautiful People & Moose (again, please find better names for these girls) by working on Kim's injured knee throughout the match.

TNA Tag Team Champions L.A.X. vs. Team 3D - Instead of this match being a brawling style that you have seen time & time again from their matches in the past, this was more of a traditional tag team match that went back & forth between both teams with old school storytelling like Team 3D double teaming & cutting off the ring building towards Homicide to get the hot tag.  Another solid encounter.

Womens Champion Awesome Kong's Open Challenge - This is a gimmick similar to how Kurt Angle used to do his gold medal challenge back in WWE where a ""random fan"" is picked, gets a match against Kong, and if the fan wins...she gets $25,000.  Two girls were picked from the audience & Kong basically squashed them both & afterwards, did the same to Eric Young's special guest...Elvis.  Unless your a heavy fan of Kong being a female version of ""WCW's Vader"" & killing people in the ring, skip this.

The Jay Lethal/So Cal Val Wedding - Holy SummerSlam '91 Batman!  Seriously, this entire storyline has been done very similar to the Randy/Liz storyline from the proposal, ""Oh Yeah!"" acceptance by Val, and even Lethal dressing in the same type of outfit Savage did at the SummerSlam wedding.  However, anyone who watched TNA over the past couple of months (including those who edit the video packages together) knew what was coming when the best man Sonjay Dutt stopped the wedding & turned heel on Lethal before getting his own beating by the groomsmen.  The heel turn was great but for him to get laid out by the legends right afterwards killed it & turned this turned into a wrestlecrap segment. At least you got to see old school legends & names from the past like Kamala, Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts (complete with snake), Koko B. Ware, and George ""The Animal"" Steele who of course munched on his favorite snack...the turnbuckle.

A.J. Styles vs. Kurt Angle - This is without a doubt one of the best matches of this year as these two put on one hell of a wrestling match & their best PPV inring performance in months.  They worked a great mat based match which is where Kurt is at his best & what Styles is very underrated at as well.  Match of the night here & with everything that happened towards the end with Karen & Tomko afterwards, you will see a rematch & the feud will continue which nobody will mind one bit after seeing this match.  Match of the night, no questions asked.

King Of The Mountain Match: TNA Champion Samoa Joe vs. Christian Cage vs. Rhino vs. Robert Roode vs. Booker T w/Kevin Nash as the special enforcer - Before I get started, I have to note how good each video package & interview was with each competitor throughout the entire night that are worth checking out as it heavily put over the main event & put over each person as not only wanting to win the match & become champion but also having something to prove as well.
Now for those who never seen a the King Of The Mountain match before, it's a ladder match in reverse with alot of stipulations. To win the match, you have to use the ladder hang the belt instead of using the ladder to pull it down like a normal ladder match. However before you can hang the belt, you have to qualify to do it by scoring a pinfall/submission over one of the other competitors...and the person who loses that fall goes into a penality box for 2 mins. Yeah, sounds real gimmicky but when you watch it come together...it's a real easy match to follow.  Overall, this was more like a 5 way dance as oppossed to the previous KOTM matches that came off like a ladder match as there wasn't as many spots as the previous ones & there wasn't much of a story told here as everyone, with the exception of Booker T, qualified towards the end of the match before the finish happened with Samoa Joe becoming the first champion to retain his championship in the KOTM match.  This match was a solid performance but didn't feel like a main event & should have switched places with the Angle/Styles match.

In the end, this was TNA's best PPV in a very long time as they fixed some of the problems that were making their PPV's suffer in by using the mentality of QUAILTY OVER QUANITY which they forgot when booking Lockdown & Sacrifice.  Eventhough there was only 5 matches on here (6 if you want to count that Awesome Kong segment), they didn't overload the card by using the entire roster in bad pointless gimmick matches that just waste time & take time away from the other more important matches on the card which makes entire the PPV suffer as a whole.  In the end, this PPV is a straight 4 star event (no being nice & rounding the rating up) as there wasn't a bad match on here & each one was given enough time.  The Awesome Kong challenge & Wedding segments were the only real bad notes of this PPV so this is one event I do recommend for a viewing.",1213401600,2,5888,4.436515291936979
