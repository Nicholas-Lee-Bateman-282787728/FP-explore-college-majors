8657280,4,B00KB5UJZU,"I recently purchased this set from a living social deal. I have always tried insanity and p90x but seem to sputter out after a few weeks.  I cannot keep up and just get frustrated.  Gmax35 seems to have a mix of elements of p90x and insanity but is definitely more do-able.  35 minutes a day makes it more reasonable.  There are a lot of push ups in a few of the workouts which is difficult for me due to a previous broken wrist.  He uses a bench a bit, but shows alternate versions if you do not have a bench.  You need weights-- heavy, medium and light.  I just started the 12 week program last week and will update again when (if) I complete it.",1437350400,2,648,4.136
8657281,5,B00KB5UJZU,"50lbs overweight, I was dripping in sweat, this workout is exactly what I needed, kick in the pants.  The time driving to and from the gym I'm already done with this workout.  Having an office job I also really like all the stretching/yoga as I didn't realize how much my flexibility has decreased over the years.",1419724800,,313,4.571428571428571
8657282,5,B00KB5UJZU,Solid workout in 35 minutes and its paying off - already lost 2 inches.  Much less intimidating than P90X and some of those kickboxing workouts.  One big difference from other workout videos - Coach Steve actually completes the whole workout himself.  He doesnt just do a few reps and then walk around other people doing the exercises.  This is the real deal for a practical at home workout!,1419638400,,391,4.705882352941177
8657283,5,B00KB5UJZU,"Great workout video for the whole family! Very motivating, convenient for people with busy schedule.",1419292800,,100,5.733333333333333
8657284,5,B00KB5UJZU,"Pros : it's only 35 minutes, covers every part of your body ,different work out every time so you don't get bored and finally,it actually works.

Cons: haven't found anything yet.

Very satisfied buyer",1417910400,,201,4.882352941176471
8657285,5,B00KB5UJZU,"GETS YOU SWEATING! Currently 4 months pregnant this workout allows me to stay active (while still at home!) but allows me to chose the intensity and level I want to work at. I love how each day is a different series, I am never bored. I am feeling healthy and strong. Loving my Gmax35!",1417564800,,285,4.296296296296297
8657286,5,B00KB5UJZU,"This is a great workout. Its definitely challenging and pushes you. The work out is short enough to fit into my busy schedule but packs enough punch to give a great workout. I like that each disc is different and rotates through the muscle groups which allows you to workout almost everyday. I have never been a ""home"" workout person but i am loving this program.",1412726400,2,363,4.515151515151516
