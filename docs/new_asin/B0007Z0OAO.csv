2253320,1,B0007Z0OAO,I am an avid fan of Shirley Temple and when I placed the order I was under the impression that these were all her movies. However it was not since I do love old movies I did enjoy them but it really wasn't what  I expected.,1174780800,12,223,3.847826086956522
2253321,3,B0007Z0OAO,Not up to my expectations as I only enjoyed seveal of the selection.  Maybe I am now getting too fussy,1360540800,,102,4.1
2253322,5,B0007Z0OAO,"All the old favorites that I remember! Ha, there is random movie from the 80's. All in all a great buy!",1357516800,,103,3.9523809523809526
2253323,5,B0007Z0OAO,"My wife loves to show these to friends and relatives.  I've watched them, and enjoyed them.  I've seen many of them in the original movie, at the theater.",1353110400,,154,4.464285714285714
2253324,4,B0007Z0OAO,"All the movies in this collection are suitable for family viewing. You have some decent drama, action and a ton of comedy here for a pretty reasonable price. I wouldn't say that they are all ""Classics"" but they are all watchable and some are enjoyable enough to watch over and over again. I would actually rate this collection a 3.5 but I bumped it up to 4 stars because genuinely good family fare is tough to find. Here's a sample of what you get for your hard earned beans.

AFRICA SCREAMS: Abbott & Costello through a series of hijinx, are mistaken for African explorers and kidnapped by some goons and taken to Africa in search of some legendary lost diamonds. There is some funny slapstick here and appearances by Shemp Howard, lion tamer Clyde Beatty and a hilarious gorilla. The kids thought it was funny.

COACH OF THE YEAR: Robert Conrad plays a former Chicago Bear who is paralyzed during the Viet Nam War. He comes back to the states and decides to coach the football team at team at a juvenile correctional school. The kids lose their first game against a snooty prep school but once they accept Conrad the rally around him, work together and win the rematch. It's a well worn story for anyone over the age of 16 or so, but younger kids might find it inspirational.

 A CHRISTMAS WITHOUT SNOW: This is an old fashioned Christmas movie about a divorced woman who joins a choir and is pushed to her limits by a challenging choir master. It's about faith and family and soul and features John Houseman giving his usual outstanding performance this time in the role of  the demanding but understanding choir master.

THE MAGIC SWORD: A knight vows to rescue a princess from an evil wizard. You can't get more basic than that. It's a little corny and cheesy but also charming and kids will like it. It's also got Basil Rathbone who seems to enjoy his role as the evil wizard Lodac!

THE NEW ADVENTURES OF HEIDI:  Modern reworking of the Heidi story, here we have Heidi leaving the  beautiful mountains of Switzerland to live with her cranky pants Grandfather in New York City. It was a nice try guys, but no dice.

THE OVER THE HILL GANG: This is a decent diversion for fans of classic Westerns. A retired Texas Ranger and his three aging pals are hired to clean up a lawless town. It features classic Western character actors like Jack Elam, Chill Wills, Walter Brennan and Edgar Buchanan. It feels more like a TV episode than a movie, but it's good to see this bunch of actors together.

FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND: A young couple is having a baby and the parents and grandparents-to-be squabble about how to raise lil' Junior. It's been done over and over again  but Spencer Tracey makes it worthwhile.

INSPECTOR GENERAL: Through a series of wacky coincidences 3rd rate con artist Danny Kaye is mistaken for a high level government official. He's rolling in clover until the real Inspector General shows up. It's not Kaye's very best, but any Danny Kaye is plenty good.

JACK AND THE BEANSTALK: Abbott and Costello tell their version of the classic kid's fairy tale. It's a pretty lavish production and reasonably funny, although the whippersnappers I watched it with thought it was a bit slow.",1300752000,20,3203,4.636042402826855

8054390,5,B0007Z0OAO,"Adventure at Walnut Grove.  A lesson about Teasing

What a beautiful story and Illustrations. This little book is worth every dime it cost. It teaches kids about being teased, and how much it hurts. To me, it is for children who are three to seven years old.
It took me a few seconds before I noticed the book had won, ""Mom's Choice Awards Honoring Excellence."" I wish every child had this book as then we might not have so many bullies. Instead we might have kids who like each other for what they are, and not for what they look like.
I really, really love this story.
