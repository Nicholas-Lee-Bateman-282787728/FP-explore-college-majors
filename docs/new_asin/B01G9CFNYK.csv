Excellent acting and pacing plus the show has some heart to it.  Funny scenarios and overall a great series.  I subtracted a star for the Comedy Central idiots for not giving this a proper release.  Shows how they support their shows these days.  For those who don't know, Amazon sells this series on DVD-R discs which basically stands for a ripped self made DVD set with no extras on it.  But, if this is the only way you can see it, give it a go.  There is a episode where Channing Tatum stays at the house and Charlotte Newhouse's character fantasizes him as David Bowie's character from Labyrinth with Channing singing like him in full costume.  lol.",1467504000,,796,4.383561643835616

8762663,1,B01G9CFNYK,"I received this copy and wondered as i opened the disc to find a purple backing. It wasn't until i tried to watch it on my dvd player that i realized that this dvd was a burned copy. It was in no way a ""sanctioned"" disc. A sanctioned disc would work on my dvd players normally. I tried a dvd player, ps4, xbox and pc. Watch for pirated copies everyone.",1480032000,,352,4.042857142857143
