8352455,5,B0026B6WV2,Its About time we see a film based of facts.  well done Damian.,1422576000,,63,3.8461538461538463
8352456,1,B0026B6WV2,"I'm embarrassed to say that I've watched this 'movie'. Some low budget movies are entertaining, but this is a total waste of time. I got from the library for 50ct, so at least it didn't cost me much, other than my precious time. Bad acting all around; kid's been running for days in the forest running from nazi, but this clothes are still pristine as when he escaped; fake sideburns weren't glued properly and there was no effort in making them appear real. At least the main actor's accent was close enough Roman.",1405987200,,515,4.548387096774194
8352457,2,B0026B6WV2,"This movie was made by Amadeus Picutes. It is a straight to DVD/straight to direct TV/instant movie. I have watched two of their movies (Polanski Unauthorized and Bobby Fischer Live) and thought they were both ok. Neither is great but they explore and expand on much of the more tabloid parts
of these stories. This is pure exploitation cinema for sure. Some of the acting is not very good at all and some of it is ok. I rate the movie two
stars but it is a good 2 stars. For a 'straight to' movie you could do worse. Even the hyperbole, conjecture and b.s. is ok because it adds some
entertainment value.",1351728000,2,605,4.3628318584070795
