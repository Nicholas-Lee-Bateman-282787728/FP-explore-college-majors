8161621,3,B000LE16SK,This is fun but a little cheesy.  My 3 year old enjoyed it for a couple times but soon was bored with it.,1359849600,,105,3.5652173913043477

8161623,5,B000LE16SK,"Two movies for the price of one -- a great deal. Well, acutally, it's like EIGHT movies for the price of one because each DVD has four 24-minute episodes on it.

The first movie, ""Alphabet Power,"" is all about letter recognition and spelling words. It has one episode of ""Blue's Room"" (the puppet Blue that talks) and three episodes of regular ""Blue's Clues"" with Joe. (My 3-year-old thinks it's so cool that she learned how to spell ""BLUE"".)

The second movie, ""Beyond Your Wildest Dreams,"" has one episode of ""Blue's Room"" about imagination. It also has one ""Blue's Clues"" with Joe (play dates) and two ""Blue's Clues"" episodes with Steve (collections and opposites).",1200614400,2,668,4.902654867256637
8161624,1,B000LE16SK,"This item is listed in a confusing (and misleading) way. It's not Blue's Clues, it's Blue's Room. Nowhere on the box does it say Blue's Clues even though the Amazon title does say Blue's Clues. It's a different show than Blue's Clues, different format, and Steve does not appear in it.",1191974400,,285,4.607843137254902
8161625,5,B000LE16SK,I bought these DVD's for my 2 yr old nephew who is in LOVE with Blue's Clues.  They arrived very quickly and saved his mother's sanity!! :-),1173312000,,140,4.185185185185185
