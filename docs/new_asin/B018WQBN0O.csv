7559225,5,B018WQBN0O,"Just arrived ahead of estimated delivery date and I have watched the first two so far. Prints are OK but I'm not complaining. Pat Hingle is great as always. John Saxon, E.G.Marshall and David Hartman are terrific. The second episode with Tisha Sterling and Jason Evers is a much sharper print.
It's fantastic to have the complete series in a nice box set.",1461542400,,355,4.650793650793651
7559226,4,B018WQBN0O,"Ahead of its time! Excellent series...glad there are 43 episodes...wish there were more! As with previous Bold Ones Shout releases...episodes are edited and run about 46 mins instead of 51. Transfers are typical old syndicated versions with artifacts, grain and variable color...but picture quality remains rather sharp throughout. This is likely the best release we will see...get it and enjoy!",1459728000,3,395,5.6
7559227,4,B018WQBN0O,"I recall Shout Factory releasing The Bold Ones: The Lawyers (which I got for Christmas from my brother - thank you) and I guess there was enough interest to release The New Doctors.  I saw several episodes on COZI TV over the last couple of years, and this show was new to me.  Quite frankly, I didn't even recall that David Hartman was an actor (he played a doctor on this show, and I vaguely remember him as teacher Lucas Tanner) before he began a successful long term career as a host on Good Morning America..

Anyway, I enjoyed watching several of these episodes.  While It's cool to look at the old big cars and the large Cadillac, Pontiac, and Oldsmobile ambulances that were used in the day, It's also fun to recognize several actors as guest stars in their early days.  Richard Dreyfuss plays a young resident in one episode, Vic Tayback plays a husband whose wife is having surgery, Sheila Larken and I believe Stephanie Powers are in one episode together, and I really enjoyed the episode where Susan Howard plays a young resident struggling with which way to take her career options.  One episode on Sickle Cell Anemia features Lou Gossett, Jr. with hair, Jim Davis plays a grandfather who is helping his daughter-in-law raise her two sons, and Mike Farrell plays a doctor in one or two episodes as a doctor who gained valuable experience as a resident in Vietnam - and this was way before Farrell was on M*A*S*H*.

Not long ago, I read that the outside shots of the hospital used was the Sheraton Universal Hotel.  It was fixed up to show ""The Craig Institute of New Medicine"", and some of these outside shots were also used for Lang Memorial (no, not Saint John's, which was another hospital (and a real hospital for the outside shots) used on Marcus Welby, M.D.) on Marcus Welby, M.D.  I also recall as a kid taking the Universal Studios tour that some of the ballrooms of the hotel were set up as operating rooms, which I believe were used for quite a few Universal shows (i.e. The Bold Ones, Marcus Welby, M.D., Quincy, and Emergency!)  Today, I don't think the Sheraton could have been used for outside shots, not only because the hotel has been remodeled, but also the growth and new hotels that have been constructed within that proximity.

Like Medical Center, The Bold Ones:  The New Doctors focused quite a bit on stories of the times, and the frontiers of new medicine.  There was a good episode on amniocentesis, where the ethics, as well as the pros and cons were outlined (pros and cons and ethics were also outlined on an episode that involved an embryo transfer), there were at least two episodes detailing coronary bypass surgery (which came to light circa 1960s) where four candidates were followed (William Shatner plays one of them), and there was one episode where a physician assistant's training program was profiled.  Quite a few were medics returning from Vietnam, and the shortage of doctors was discussed (which was real in the 1960s and 1970s.)  There was also a good episode on hemophilia (Marcus Welby, M.D. also did an episode), since new clotting medications were becoming available, and there were two episodes that dealt tactfully with homosexuality, with one involving a former girlfriend of Dr. Martin Cohen.

I liked reading the credits, which highlighted that the technical subject that was dramatized in the episode was something a research team in the real world was working with to advance the care of medicine.  Much of the discussions in these episodes are medical procedures that today are done routinely at large hospitals across the country.  I recommend taking a step back 45 years and watching ""The Bold Ones: The New Doctors.""",1458950400,4,3688,4.753918495297806
7559228,5,B018WQBN0O,"I was so pleased when I heard this series was finally being released on DVD, and the actual package did not disappoint. I never missed an episode back in the day; to see the show again after 40-plus years is a real treat. It was far more groundbreaking than I realized at the time (I admit I was focused on the scrumptious David Hartman more than the theme). The David Craig Institute of New Medicine was indeed that! Procedures that were barely being investigated then are commonplace now (grafting veins in heart bypasses, for instance). The picture quality is fine, the scripts and acting are topnotch, and the variety of guest stars is impressive. For the price, I wish they had included some extras, but I'll take this as is, and be grateful. Now if they'd only release Lucas Tanner on DVD!",1458518400,5,795,4.605633802816901
7559229,4,B018WQBN0O,"The longest running of the rotating ""Bold Ones"" programs, ""The New Doctors"" was a medical series -- but not like so many others to be found on TV at the time. It not only focused on new & experimental approaches to medicine, it looked deeply at social & cultural issues surrounding them. Episodes dealing with mental health, for instance, examined all the controversies raging about medication, surgery, therapy in the mental health field, as well as the then-current issues regarding power, labels, what was considered mainstream & what wasn't. This approach extended to all of their stories, allowing the viewer to not only learn about new medical techniques, but to debate the moral & ethical issues involved -- and in the late 1960s/early 1970s, there were plenty of those!

But the stories were daring in more provocative ways, too. In ""Dark is the Rainbow, Loud the Silence"" Jack Klugman plays an important diplomat in the Nixon administration, one who is prone to sudden violent urges he can't control. In  one scene, he's in a hotel room talking with Nixon (portrayed by an actor with a barber's towel over his face), and he's suddenly overcome by those violent urges -- to the point where he's about to cut Nixon's throat. I doubt we'd see something like that on TV today, unless it was with a fictional president. It was a shocking scene then, and remains one even now.

In ""One Small Step for Man"" the story involves a black astronaut with medical problems that may keep him from a Moon-landing. Another program might have had the issue resolved here on Earth -- but this one uses NASA footage to depict the astronaut's medical crisis while circling the Moon, requiring a diagnosis & remedy via radio. Again, the series went an extra step & delivered exciting, well-written material that was both gripping & thoughtful.

The series dealt with such issues as the right to die, the choices that doctors must make between one patient & another receiving life-&-death procedures, the financial & emotional costs to the families of patients, and much more. The lead characters are portrayed as dedicated, but not saintly; they're capable of making errors of judgment. All in all, this was a strong, smart series that holds up very well decades later -- highly recommended!

Note: As with all ""Bold Ones"" releases, the image quality is probably variable, looking very much like any old TV show that's been re-run quite a few times. Once I've watched the entire set, I'll amend this review with specific comments.

Edit - 4/6/2016 - Having watched several episodes, I can confirm that the image quality is consistent with previous ""Bold Ones"" sets, certainly watchable but showing some signs of age. And the episodes do seem to be those cut for syndication ... but since these are likely to be the only versions we'll ever get, it's best enjoy to what we do have, I think. The stories themselves remain strong, both well-written & well-acted. And the tone of the times, both troubled & hopeful, with its sense of innate human decency generally edging out the lesser, self-centered qualities of all too many people, is a reminder of a better worldview than the more dispirited, rather nihilistic one that currently prevails -- still highly recommended!",1456963200,8,3255,4.898366606170599

8743219,2,B018WQBN0O,"NOPE.

4 stars for the show itself. It's often interesting, sometimes boring drama series. But 1 star for releasing only the syndicated (i.e. EDITED) versions rather than the full-length episodes. I have a ""bootleg"" copy of the one of the episodes and there are about 2.5 minutes extra in that version vs. the one released on this set. Too bad.",1466985600,2,344,4.733333333333333
