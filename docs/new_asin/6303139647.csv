7839236,5,6303139647,"I loved this swiss film, and I would like to see it released on dvd. In the meantime I might buy it in VHS format....

This film makes one realize how the society is forcing people to do things that they do not want to do, just to be able to continue to live and earn some money...

Even in developped and rich countries like Switzerland, this can be a very bad experience to go through...

This is a thing that this film teached me much more accurately than all the rethoric and philosophy on the subject.",1133654400,4,506,4.195876288659794
