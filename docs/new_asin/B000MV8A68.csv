8197841,5,B000MV8A68,"I have seen a lot film documentaries about WWII, so when I saw that this contained ""rare archival footage"" I began viewing with a wait and see attitude.  I am not sure that I have seen even as much as 5 minutes of what I saw in this two disc set ANYWHERE before.  The scenes where well edited, riveting,  and of very good quality.  I would strongly recommend this set to anyone wishing to learn more about World War II.",1393804800,,419,4.2
8197842,2,B000MV8A68,save your money. The world at War series or Nazis;A Warning from history are a much superior product. Conflict is more like a timeline of the war without going into depth of the war or the causes.,1296345600,2,196,4.324324324324325
8197843,2,B000MV8A68,"As the other review mentioned, this DVD set is available at Ross for 3 or 4 dollars. Even then it is not worth it. I'm a World War buff and the way this set glosses over important events with a sentence or two bothers me. To say things along the lines of ""Meanwhile, the fighting continued in North Africa"" does not cut it. Ethopia was summarized in two sentences and barely a mention of Midway. 3 hours would be enough perhaps to document France, but certainly not all of the war.

Do not pick this one up, it will put you to sleep.",1269302400,,533,4.174757281553398
8197844,1,B000MV8A68,"Once again the Timeless Media Group takes relatively old newsreels and calls them ""rare archival footage"" and attractively repackages this content to resemble documentaries into two DVDs for the unsuspecting history aficionado who, thinking he will be getting something truly unique, ends up with nothing more than old WWII news footage accompanied by bland and uninspiring narration.

Don't bother paying the Amazon price listed here, or even $4.99 at the Ross-Dress-for-Less where you can usually fine such sets.  You would be better served saving your money and investing in a far superior documentary series like the expertly assembled boxed set of the classic (and, in my opinion, the finest WWII documentary series ever made), Thames Television's ""The World at War"" or the more recent alternative, ""BBC History of WWII""--both remarkable in content and depth and far more engaging for the armchair historian or casual viewer.",1228694400,4,930,5.406896551724138
