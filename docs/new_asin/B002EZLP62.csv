It was a bit confusing because that particular disc was ""blank""...meaning that it had no title on it so we were not sure which side was the correct one. Once we played it we wondered if the 2nd movie would be next. so we were wondering where the 3rd movie was. Unsure what to do I flipped the disc thinking that I'd be risking playing the ""incorrect"" side but found the 3rd movie on that side.",1360195200,,526,4.27
