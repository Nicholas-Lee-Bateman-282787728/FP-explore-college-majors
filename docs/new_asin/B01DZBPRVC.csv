8757386,5,B01DZBPRVC,"Brian, Vectorer and Potential Others -- Actually I am not sure whether I love my Laser Media DVD #300 version of Morning Lake or not, because . . . well, see my discussion post . . . (Actually I am being a tad disingenuous because '71-'73 are the years of WR that I most loved, so it is ALWAYS a treat for me to find something new from that era, no matter how professionally -- or not in this particular/potential case -- it has been created . . . ).  In my view, buy the thing . . . just make sure you get the most complete version (assuming there is more than one of course).  :-)  Peace, Al in Durham, NC",1476057600,,607,3.959016393442623
8757387,4,B01DZBPRVC,"Don't judge this vid by it's cover.  This is NOT the edition of the band indicated by the cover pic above. No Jaco.  No Peter.  This B&W video tape depicts the Zawinul/Shorter/Gravatt/Vitous/um Romao era. The audio is remarkably sharp & clean considering this recorded was well over 40 years ago.  Professionally produced with multiple cameras. Too bad, there are no track titles or even chapter stops.  From an historical perspective this DVD gives great insight into WR's 1972-73 years.",1470700800,5,488,5.1265822784810124
8757388,3,B01DZBPRVC,"This DVD offers no frills, no liner notes, no menu, no song selection, nothing. It is not Dolby Digital as claimed, (seems none of these reissues are.) The best DVD to compare it to is the Beat Club show from 1971, made for German TV. That show is in color- this one, also made for TV in 1972 in front of a live audience, is in black and white. Not that there's anything wrong with that- it looks pretty cool. The material is very similar, as both shows come from the band's early ""free"" period. The lineup is the same on both discs.

The order of the tunes is listed incorrectly on this new DVD, and I suspect the first tune, which is pretty open, isn't called Firefish. Nor is the second tune something called Early Minor. I think they just made this stuff up. In fact, ironically, the title of this DVD is Waterfall, but that tune isn't on this disc! (It is however performed on the Beat Club disc.) Orange Lady (found on both discs,)  doesn't come last- it appears somewhere around 1/3 thru the set and like the 1971 show, doesn't include the ""ambient jungle"" section from the original album, but just goes completely out into furious WR jamming.  For those who care about such things, I think you get a more complete form of the actual composition on the 1971 set. Zawinul plays Rhodes augmented by effects throughout both sets, but on the so called Waterfall set, he briefly plays acoustic piano, a real treat.

Both sets are shot nicely, with the camera focusing where it should most of the time. Look for the late Dom Um Romao who is a blast to watch, on wooden women's shoes in a few spots. What a magnificent and wildly creative percussionist!

Both sets are about 45-50 minutes long. The playing on both sets is comparable, i.e. Weather Report at their most intuitive, risk taking and daring best. This is free and exciting music born from the wellspring of Miles' In a Silent Way, Bitches Brew and Big Fun etc. This is experimental music that often gives me the feeling of riding the rapids on a wild river, occasionally resting on a sunny beach or roaming an Amazonian rainforest only to plunge into the roiling depths again. It is as fascinating and fresh today as it was then. It is not only historic, but totally relevant and entirely entrancing.

In summary, it you don't own the 1971 BeatClub set, I would pick it up first. And if you're a big fan of this more open period in WR's development, this is a fine, energetic set to add to your collection.

Three and 1/2 stars for the DVD, because of mediocre sound, no menu, no song selection and no liner notes. Hey folks: that's just being lazy and cheap. I would expect that from a bootleg, but not from a commercial release. The music itself is 5 stars.",1468108800,13,2721,4.451807228915663
