8300514,5,B001F0TT4M,"This is simply made for graphic gore and nudity. It's an indoor film that takes place inside a mansion, and the scenery of the old place isn't bad but isn't really worth mentioning; If you're looking for something with good atmosphere, scenery that's worth mentioning and something that takes place outside, then it isn't recommended. It also isn't recommended if you're looking for a well made horror movie because of these things: the directing will probably range from very poor to OK depending on your taste; with the exception of the performances from some of the women which is OK, the acting is basically below average; none of the characters are interesting at all; the film generates no suspense, scares, and the simple plot is nothing special; and the entire thing is just these people in this mansion being slaughtered. Basically, you've got these women who seduce and then slaughter men when they transform into demons. There's plentiful full nudity and gore. The women all look really good, and the film is a nice and dirty exploitation flick. The gore effects consist of stuff like a guy vomiting his guts out, ripped flesh, intestines being yanked out and more; and thankfully, they didn't use CGI gore effects. I thought the film was pretty well scored, so this helps it to some extent, but many won't like the directing and other aspects of the film. If you just want an easy to follow trash movie with lots of full nudity and gore, then you might like it; If you're concerned with anything else, then get something else. The film isn't slow, but gore and nudity alone may be boring if you don't like anything else about the film. I personally really like these types of trashy films when you've got these women who turn into monsters and butcher men. I had a lot of fun with it.

There's trailers, a behind the scenes part and interviews for the extras. The Blu-ray has grain, but I still thought the quality was really good overall. However, my Blu-ray disc skipped and froze in some places. I bought it really cheap from a seller, so I didn't bother returning it. Shriek Show discs are known to have problems. If I returned it, my replacement copy would probably have been the same. I think it might depend on the Blu-ray player you're playing it on. The menu screen has animation and music. I got my new Blu-ray for like around $2.00 plus shipping, so I definitely thought it was worth it.
UPDATE
I tried it now on my Sony BDP S3700 Blu-ray player, and the problem is still there. Also, just like SHADOW DEAD RIOT, it has now gotten more defective. The disc is skipping more on both players now.",1405728000,,2616,4.625806451612903
8300515,2,B001F0TT4M,"I want to like this film.  It has a nice cover and the location is wonderful, but something doesn't work with it.

The story seems decent enough; a mansion which used to be a brothel owned by a wealthy man who wanted to delve as far as he could with power... even seeking an amulet which supposedly can control demons, or in this case succubus.  Nothing is really determined about his death, but many years later another wealthy man buys the property and hires some paranormal investigators to ""cleanse"" it..

Maybe it was the way the bland dialogue had too be rushed in order to make room for the Buckethead music videos.  It just seemed like there was a tug 'o war going on between dialogue sequences and artsy fartsy music video sequences.  But neither parts made a whole and the movie seemed to just lack an overall feel to it.  It covered up a lack of action in the deaths by doing stupid camera tricks and having the naked chicks with rubber masks on shaking their heads to Buckethead music while the camera man shook the camera... or maybe he was just nervous.  There is no struggle, no fighting back really - yet at the same time the people in the film didn't appear to be very mesmerized by the succubus either.

 It seems to me that there was so much missed opportunity here.  The location was gorgeous and even in bonus features it shows parts that weren't renovated and they looked fabulous and i just had to ask, ""WHY!?!?!?  Why didn't they use that area to film?""  If the writing were better, we could have maybe cared about the story more and maybe characters would be likable.  I also thought many scenes drug out too long like the dude wanting to steal jewelry and we get like 10 minutes of zombies just standing at the door watching him... this whole scene could have been 2 minutes long and been more effective.  Another scene of the succubi gathering around a pentagram on the floor with bodies to eat seemed like a dull music video and took way too long and moved too slow.  I don't think the music really complimented the film and in some parts seemed annoying.

 I did want to like this film, it had so much going for it but just failed to deliver.  So many films are done with so little money and having almost nothing for locations, but have a good flow - this seemed to have some money and an excellent location with a good effects team and failed to deliver.  Hell, even the movie cover art looks good.

 In the end, you just need to see it.  I would say it gets 2.5 stars, but i cannot say i like it.  I think if they tightened the script, got some stylized lighting and worked on atmosphere and camera work rather than shaking the camera/blurring it/washing it out/distressing it, that this title could have been something, as it is it just exists and fails to draw you in.",1404604800,,2802,4.396116504854369
