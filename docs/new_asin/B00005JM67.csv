1506131,3,B00005JM67,"I was not a viewer when Profiler was first run on network television but now I've seen the first season and I can see both strengths and weaknesses.
Things I liked:
1. Samantha's character and her relationship with her friend Angel in the first couple of episodes.  Ally Walker did a great job with this character.
2. Some of the cinematography-- the way the pilot was shot was very good.
3. The way Samantha's flashes of insight where dealt with in the story.
4. The sexual zing between Samantha and Coop, especially when they first met on the series.
Things I found distracting or unfortunate:
1. A lot of scenes are played out in the dark but with glints of light off eyeballs and teeth.  The watcher may not know what else is going on but is never in doubt as to where the eyeballs and teeth are in these scenes.
2.  Angel was shoved from an artist who created metal sculpture with a blow torch to a baby sitter-- ok, she was teaching art to inner city kids or something, but she was seen most of th time watching Samantha's kid.  Really a waste of a good character.
3.  Icky saliva sounds that went with all of the love scenes.
Just as a side note the commentaries from Ally Walker and Robert Davi on the pilot are unintentionally hilarious.  Unlike a lot of these tracks, these were recorded separately so there is no intereaction between the commentors.  Ally tells us things like Robert Davi's infatuation with hair spray and a stetson hat. Robert Davi seems really upset that the series didn't last longer or at least that they didn't do a made for TV movie spin off because NBC owned the whole package.
My final impression was that this was a good idea, that it had some good characters involved but all of the really good ideas were used early or muted down for one reason or another.",1067212800,13,1795,4.437689969604863
1506132,5,B00005JM67,"I'm so glad to find out this gem of a show is out on DVD (and season 2 is coming soon).  When this show premiered, I was only 13, but loved it...I really loved the way a woman was portrayed as not just a damsel in distress.  The 90s brought about great female characters like Dana Scully, Buffy, Xena, and Sam Waters...which were great role models for me as a pre teen.  Before shows like theirs, men ruled everything, and women were relegated to partners being raped or shot or mamed (like on Hunter), but these women started a new trend, that shows like Alias and Dark Angel took a page from.  Kudos for recognizing true genius in ground breaking shows like Profiler.",1066694400,8,669,4.414634146341464

1506134,3,B00005JM67,"As I become more experienced in boxed DVD sets, tipically 2 problems arise with many of these: irritating visuals and awful sound. This is an all too typical example of both. As all too many show, it is simply unwatchable in dayligh, unless you are in as sealedm dark room. And the sound, specifically dialogue, is all too often unintelligible. At least some DVDs compensate the second with subtitle/closed captiones options. This one does not. I find it frustrating that such good material cannot be presented better. Am I the only complainant here? As it is I will have to watch it only at nights, even in the weekends. And the 3 stars are only because this was a good, suspenseful program.",1059955200,20,692,4.680327868852459
1506135,5,B00005JM67,This is the show which made me look over my shoulder when taking the trash out at night! Even with episode 4 missing - it's worth it for the super cinematography and cool audio visual elements. A forerunner to '24'-style storytelling.,1059782400,6,234,4.7317073170731705
1506136,5,B00005JM67,Shame on A and E for not including episode #4.  Felicity just changed the music in order to relese the epiosde.

1506137,5,B00005JM67,"As I was watching the serial Profiler on TV in Belgium, I was wishing for a DVD release of it. Thanks God here it is at last!
I will order it soon, but though I undrestand English I'm a bit disappointed because of the fact that we won't find any French subtitles (or other languages subtitles) on this edition! It's a pity for all the foreigners that certainly wish to have it but will hasitate because they maybe don't understand English well enough! Please Mr. pubisher thing about that for next releases!",1052438400,7,507,4.521739130434782
1506138,5,B00005JM67,"Profiler is truly a magnificent series. Starring Ally Walker as Samantha Waters, a brilliant forensic psychologist with a unique gift for understanding the criminal mind, the show focuses on the Violent Crimes Task Force, an elite unit of the FBI that investigates the most violent of crimes, including those perpetrated by the infamous serial killer, Jack of All Trades.
The storylines in this show constantly surprise and delight and the on-going cat and mouse game between Sam and Jack is handled with great aplomb. The first season finale, 'Venom', is perhaps one of the show's best episodes, with an intriguing storyline and a shocking cliffhanger.
The cast always turns in stellar performances. Ally is superb and flawless in her portrayal of the tormented but strong Sam. Julian McMahon and Robert Davi are equally good, but mention must be made of the fantastic Peter Frechette and Roma Maffia, who may not be featured as much in the spotlight, but turn in some wonderful performances each week, anyway.
I'm really looking forward to picking up this set, as I've only ever seen ""Into the Abyss"" and ""Venom"", the last few episodes of season one. I also really look forward to season two.
The cover art for this set is gorgeous, and keeps very much in with the dark nature of the show.
Highly recommended. You won't be disappointed.",1049760000,17,1338,4.924778761061947

1506261,2,B00005JM67,"Profiler is good enough to warrant a rental, but this is the kind of series where you'll watch an episode, be thoroughly entertained while watching it, but have no desire to see it a second time. In other words, while these shows are above-average, the replayability factor for this box set isn't very high.

But if you're a fan of the program, you should be mostly happy with this DVD set, whose biggest flaws are the lack of a few more extras and that missing episode.",1391904000,,470,4.465116279069767

1506267,4,B00005JM67,"Ally Walker plays a forensic psychologist who is a criminal profiler working for the FBI.  Her character's husband was murdered by a serial killer who haunts and stalks her as she and the team solve the hardest cases.

I like Profiler, a crime drama.  I think that Ally Walker was perfectly cast (despite what some of the management said after her leaving the show in Season IV).  She comes across as intelligent, moody, beautiful, and vulnerable, creating a perfect combination for the character.  The show also has some good supporting actors/actresses.",1310083200,,555,5.054945054945055

1506347,5,B00005JM67,"This series was so unique and difference. I love to watched. The thing the I like most is that this serie have a story behind the story. First, it's the crimes cases stories that the main character, Sam Waters, try to resolve and second, her own personal tragic story. That was the emotional situation that the audience related. I think, for me, that's the diference between the TV series today. CSI,WITHOUT TRACE,etc. are good but don't have the emotional part on it. They have a lot of features and technology, but they just resolve a case brilliantly but when they resolved, the episodes ended and pass to another. The characters just have a brief emotions situations with not much enthusiasm. Profiler is dark, mysteries and thriller. Sam Waters is the main character and like others said she is a Profiler's soul. Her style, her attitude and her storyline was so strange and unusual that make this a hit. Season 1 to Season 3, are the best. She was in a few episodes of Season 4 until she was replace for another profiler.  The good thing is that she stay long enough to complete her journey and we, sadly but with satisfaction, watched the closure of her story. Season 4 without Sam Waters wouldn't the same. This is not about if her replacement was good or bad. It's about that Sam Waters' story and her style is what make audience captivated. She is the star of the serie, and we live through her all her tragic moments and when was finish is like the serie finish with her. For me, Season 4 was a test that the producers do it to prove that Ally Walker(Sam Water's actress) was not necessary for the TV series but in the end they have to admit that they were wrong. Even so, its a great TV series, one of the best and for the people who loves 90's series this one is good for you; recommended 100%.",1293321600,,1807,4.442771084337349

1506349,3,B00005JM67,"The profiler is definatly a darker series then most would like, although I really enjoyed it. Most of the reviews i've read say they don't like the ""Jack"" sub-plot but I think it make's it more darker. It's like in Silence of the Lambs with Hannibal Lector. This season is the best place to start if you decide to watch this series. Being as though I say this the first time a round I may be biased. The first three seasons of this show are what made this series but the forth revamped the whole series and went down in flames. Ally Walker and Robert Davi flow so well as though they know what to do without direction.",1247529600,,618,4.245762711864407

1506425,4,B00005JM67,"Before the current hit series, MEDIUM, NBC had PROFILER, Which ran for four seasons, and is a credible forerunner to the more sophisticated MEDIUM.  A stronger female lead in the role of Sam Waters may have enhanced the show's effectiveness, but to give Ally Walker credit, she tried hard to bring us the angst of the show's heroine, but annoying habits such as the endless pulling her hair behind her ears and a weak sense of physical characteristics often made her performances less than perfect.  Robert Davi as her macho yet sensitive boss, NIP AND TUCK's Julian McMahon as the sensitive partner, and Roma Maffia as the medical examiner fared better.  In the first season there seemed to be a lot of redundance in the scenes involving Sam and her young daughter, and her roommate's role (Erica Gimpel) seemed almost superfluous.  The show had some good episodes with innovative plots, and although the continuing presence of Jack the serial killer could have become monotonous, the writers were smart enough to give us tidbits of his actions that continue into the second season.

At the time of the show's debut, it was considered highly innovative, and it is a dark and chilling series, which seemed to get better as it found its focus in Season 2.",1167350400,4,1254,4.813953488372093
1506426,4,B00005JM67,"Profiler was a show way before its time. Atmospheric, well acted, stylish and yes, sometimes so edgy it was downright scary....many an episode will leave you with that uneasy feeling long after it is over. A great cast led by the incomparable Ally Walker, Robert Davi, Julian McMahon and Roma Maffia ( the latter two went on to star together in another edgy drama-Nip/Tuck)pulls down some serious dramatic performances....this is a cast ensemble you grow to really care for. The story revolves around Samantha Waters (Walker) a very strong profiler for the FBI's Violent Crime Task Force, who has taken a sabbatical from work after a serial killer known as Jack Of All Trades has fixated on her to the point of stalking her family and killing her husband, Tom, leaving her and her young daughter Chloe alone and vulnerable. Now living with her best friend, Angel, sam is called back into action when the latest MO on a serial killing spree matches Jack. The Jack story becomes a common thread throughout each weekly episode. As far as the boxed set is concerned, the sets are pricey although not much pricier than half of the HBO shows on the market today. In sett One, episode four is missing due to licensing issues over a song that could not be replaced since the story was closely connected to it. Some have found flaws such as picture and sound....I did not find this on mine. The picture is recorded dark and was so in its original run on NBC. I found the sound to be very crisp and clear on my stereo system, in fact louder than most and had to be turnedd down which is unusual with TV productions. not much for extras here...there are commentaries by Ally Walker and Robert davi on the pilot, an A & E episode of American Justice called Profiles of Evil as well as cast bios and stills. i enjoyed the set but bought it at substantial savings through an Amazon seller. Great set worth the purchase! I only gave it four stars because of the missing episode and high purchase price. If you can afford it, it is definitely worth every penny! I enjoyed it even more on DVD than I appreciated it on television! Excellent!",1167264000,6,2123,4.560209424083769
1506427,4,B00005JM67,"Sam Waters, a profiler working for the FBI, helps on a series of cases where her uncanny ability to envision the crime helps immensely in solving the case.  But there's a demented serial killer who's completely fixated on her and always one step ahead who keeps making trouble for her.

Profiler is a very atmospheric show and is a cut above the rest as it skips the usual light hearted approach and completely discards humorous aspects.  It's very serious in tone and that's it's biggest appeal.

There are some standout episodes on season 1 and they all concern Jack of All Trades, the serial killer who's obsessed with Sam.  He's a genuinely frightening character and that makes viewers want to continue with the series.

Actors are good, especially Ally Walker and Robert Davi deliver first rate performances every show.  Others aren't as noticable but very capable and do their jobs well.

But one thing; what's with the price tag on this series?  Mediocre full screen transfers at best, basic sound mix and very few extras.  Are they tripping???  No way I'd buy these sets at these prices.",1159833600,,1095,4.802139037433155

When most TV DVD sets are retailing for $50 to $60 they expect people to cough up $100 (Amazon does try to help with the discount) for an incomplete season.
I'll wait for A&E to get it right or not bother.
The show was fairly descent back when it aired but eventually it will be released correctly and at $100 I have time to wait.

Follow up:
When I originally wrote this review in Jan 2005 this DVD actually was $100.
Now that it's down to $25 it seems more reasonable, but I've moved on to better shows.",1106179200,22,639,4.195121951219512

What I got was an almost but not there.  I mean Robert Davi in a cowboy hat flying in on hrlicopters...What is that?  Stupid miscasts like that will defifitely cause a show to shark-jump.

1506431,5,B00005JM67,"I have to take issue with Amazon's Editorial reviewer Jeff Shannon, and his review of Profiler Season I.
Mr. Shannon attempts to review not the DVD itself, but what he *thinks* are the behind-the-scenes truths of the Profiler production. One, he refers to the DVD commentary of Ally Walker - suggesting that she is in fact giving the reason why she left after only ""two"" seasons. (Psssst, Jeff... it was after THREE seasons - not to mention she headlines the opener of the fourth season).
Then he gives more of his ""insight"" when he suggests that NBC was troubled by the ""miscasting"" of Ally Walker. Well, not that I believe Mr. Shannon has any reliable inside information, but what does that have to do with reviewing this DVD? I tend to think that Shannon was insinuating his own feelings about Walker, and trying to use the NBC network - based on rumor - as a way to reinforce them. A more candid review would have read, ""I wasn't terribly impressed with Walker, and felt she was miscast in the role.""
But that probably wouldn't have held-up against the enormous fan-following of Walker on this show (or as Shannon understated in his review, ""growing popularity""), nor would it have stood up well against the fact that after Walker left and was replaced by Jamie Luner, the ratings pretty much tanked.
Make no mistake about it: this is a GREAT show. You will esecially enjoy this Season I DVD. The isolated, episodic stories are each fantastic in their own right, and the Jack thread is very addictive. Ally Walker's performance is compelling, and she leads a solid cast - notably Robert Davi, Peter Frechette, Julian McMahon, and Roma Maffia.
