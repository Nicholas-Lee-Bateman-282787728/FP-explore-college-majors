380927,4,6301945298,The thing I liked the most about this movie was the in the end where Goodman got some serious payback in the most creative way. It really reminded of an Alfred Hitchcock thriller. The beauty of the whole movie for me was that Clint Goodman didn't even keep the money his wife and the doctor thought they killed him over. That was classic how he buried them both in a coffin with the money they wanted so badly. That's irony and poetic justice!,1250121600,,443,4.349397590361446
380928,4,6301945298,"I do not fancy myself as a movie critic.  I don't get paid by the number of useless words I write/spew; I won't use a lot of words and say nothing.  The idea of killing someone with poison from a fish is not a bad idea.  If this were to happen in a restaurant, a law suit would bring forth lots of money.  However, doing it at home to your husband, you have to very careful and not be greedy about the money, don't spare the final expenses.  Forty-five minutes into the movie, the climax, the best line in the movie is spoken, ""Honey, I'm home"".",1249689600,,545,4.10377358490566

380935,2,6301945298,"Director Frank Darabont has more skill at non-exploitive treatment than casting in this horror TVM. The teleplay by Mark Patrick Carducci based on a story by David A. Davies is thin, reading more like an anthology episode, with Jennifer Jason Leigh and her lover William Atherton planning the murder of Leigh's husband Tim Matheson. Darabont establishes the gothic terror of the title predicament, even if the act of revenge fails to duplicate the same level of dread.
The narrative has convenient plot contrivances - the haste of the burial bypassing the  embalming procedure and cheap choise of coffin, rain allowing for a ""resurrection"" from a shallow grave, and especially the climactic house reconstruction - though Matheson's dog disliking JJL is an acceptable touch. The idea of JJL and Atherton fighting amongst themselves is meant to present them as disloyal characters though thankfully they have the sense to see it also weakens their position against a common foe.
JJL's femme fatale may have no subtlety - she has a bad dye job and is a chain smoker - but at least she has some honest moments. Matheson's earnestness cannot bring him tube empathy, and his Frankenstein-like coffin-wear scores a titter. And although Atherton is hardly the romantic type, he at least can deliver funny lines in ""It never woulda worked darlin'. Too much of a slob"" (funnier in the context), and ""We got Jason upstairs and Cujo in the frontyard"".",1004572800,3,1439,5.02092050209205

Jennifer Jason Leigh and William Atherton also do their jobs very well---you really can't stand 'em, they're a smarmy, despicable pair who belong in a low-budget movie...they're good at being bad--and you can only hope there'll be some kind of comeuppance, as unlikely as that may be.
