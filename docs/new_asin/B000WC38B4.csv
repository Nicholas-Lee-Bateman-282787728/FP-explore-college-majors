2964361,5,B000WC38B4,"This may sound corny but this DVD changed my life! I am 42 years old, I have tried many different ways to exercise. I have a lot of joint pain and I just never felt great after a workout of running, spinning, weights, etc. I got tendonitis in my elbow recently and was told to not to lift weights. I tried yoga because my aunt in Florida loves it. I bought this DVD at a grocery store and I have done it every day for 15 days so far! I even brought it on a trip and watched it on my computer. I am a different person. It is amazing that the first time I tried this I was so tight I could hardly bend forward! I tried Yoga years ago and I was amazed at how easy this DVD was to follow. I can bend further every time I watch it and I use the breathing many during the day to just calm myself. I also have tried to lose 5 pounds over the last year and I have already lost 3 pounds. I am calmer, more flexible, happier and I feel leaner. I feel like I have tapped into something so great. I really want to go further with more poses and with the breathing so I am looking forward to a second DVD. I wish I lived in New York so I could meet Elena Brower. I love her soft, gentle, empowering teaching style. I have never felt better. Thank you so much, Lisa Corwin from Iowa

When I saw it, I was pleasantly surprised. I would say this is for the intermediate person. Some of the poses were a little complex for a beginner.",1200355200,,292,4.051724137931035
2964363,3,B000WC38B4,"While this certainly is a beautifully produced tape, to say it is for beginners is misleading.  I certainly cannot twist and turn like this and modifications are left up to you to figure out.

If I were more flexible and stronger, I would rate this DVD with 5 stars because its really Yoga for Intermediate People.

Now my all time favorite real beginner's DVD is Pilates Complete for Inflexible People by Maggie Rhoades. You don't get the Hawaiian scenery but you should be able to tackle most of the exercises. Also the Rhoades DVD combines both Pilates and Yoga and actually shows beginner modifications using a chair, a strap and a pillow.",1199750400,11,643,4.723214285714286

I also have a certification as a fitness instructor, so I am well qualified to rate the quality of the instructors and workouts on the dvds I try.  Element Yoga for Beginners provides the highest quality Yoga instruction I have found to date.  Elena Brower's delivery is clear, concise, and precise in guiding the 'participant' through a Yoga routine that is at once easy to follow for beginners...yet stimulating and challenging enough for Yoga practitioners to do.  It's no wonder that Elena's New York studio attracts both newcomers and Hollywood celebrities.  If you're a ""newbie"" to Yoga, by all means get this beautiful beginner workout, and watch it first all the way through to get familiar with the movements before you do it.  If you're already a Yoga-phile, pop the dvd in your dvd player and start working out with Elena right away.  You'll love it!",1198022400,12,1101,5.676829268292683
2964365,3,B000WC38B4,"While this is not a bad DVD, it is far too strenuous and, in places, complex  for real beginners. Only try this if you have at least some experience in a yoga class.",1197504000,38,165,4.0
2964404,2,B000WC38B4,"This is not yoga for beginners, unless you are already in fairly sound physical condition with no major issues with your body, joints, and movement. I have ankylosing spondylitis and despite my on regular workouts, I have movement restrictions that are very slow to loosen up, much like someone who is simply inflexible do to physical inactivity.
I've really been trying to like yoga and got this because its supposed to be for beginners. Within 10 minutes of the video, it feels just like most other so called beginner yoga, as if there is a race to do as many postures as possible in the alloted amount of time. Not much time to adjust yourself and get to know the position before she starts racing you into the next pose using ""yoga speak"" as if you already know what she means by many of the phrases.
I've been a personal trainer for 10 years and I can't even begin to imagine bringing in a new client in the physical condition of a beginner and then racing them through lifts quickly with language I'm familiar with and they are not, and not bothering to slow down and explain what I mean. I also wonder why so many western yoga practicioners fail to realize that most people here can't sit cross legged for long very easily because we don't sit on the floor cross legged most of our life like they do in places where yoga  has its roots.  The amount of stress placed on the hip capsule for those with previous injuries, inflammation and arthritic conditons such as mine and movement restrictions is unnecessary and it would be much better to work through internal and external rotational movements before going right into a cross legged position as the first move.

Worse, as with the yoga classes I've attended, the instructor does the nice perfect looking version of the pose and at best gives you a quick minor adjustment to make if you are having difficulty with the move. For many of the moves, the adjustment isn't helpful in overcoming the challenges to the movement and you are  left either guessing at how to adjust the move yourself or just breathing and waiting for her to get back into something within your range.  While I was able to do the DVD, it felt like a fight with my own body because of the pace and lack of clear explanations and  modifications. I can't imagine someone who hasn't been working out regularly trying to complete this if they have movement restrictions and problems with their joints.

The pros, she has a very calming and gentle voice and the scenery is relaxing. The con, its really an intermediate yoga DVD and should clearly be labeled as such. I wish I read read the reviews and realized most of the people not happy with this feel it is too advanced for a beginner.",1471824000,,2714,4.549180327868853

Since I've been doing yoga on and off for years, it's perfect for getting me back into it. However, if you're looking for a true beginner's DVD, then I would try the Tara Lee series as it teaches you slowly how to do poses. If you're looking for a longer, slightly more difficult beginner's practice that really stretches you out, then Elena Brower's practice is perfect!",1443571200,,475,4.734939759036145

This video is very energizing and has some great stretches in it, but it is definitely not for very basic beginners. There are not many modifications shown for the minimally flexible, and many poses are mentioned by name and not described or broken down how to get there. I have done enough yoga to know what she means when she calls out certain poses, like downward facing dog and pigeon, but if you are very new to yoga, this one might take watching her a few times before getting the hang of it.
All in all, I do really like this video, but buyer beware that it is not for the novice.",1442275200,,684,4.1893939393939394

I've been in a yoga class for the past 8 weeks and thought it would be nice to have a DVD for home use.  I was sucked in by the ""for beginners"" statement.  This is yoga for beginners like synchronized  swimming is for beginning swimmers or the female lead of Swan Lake is for beginner ballerinas!  Terrible, terrible disappointment.  In addition, there is little if any explanation of the postures.  If I'd never been to a yoga class and picked up this DVD thinking I could learn/practice yoga myself at home, at the end of the DVD I'd have thrown it in the trash feeling completely discouraged and never would have tried yoga again.

2964476,5,B000WC38B4,"What an amazing yoga dvd.  I started off doing yoga from Elena Brower's AM PM Yoga several years ago -- and then moved into Kundalini DVDs, but I just got this one a week or two ago and it is my new favorite!! I know there was a lot of discussion in other reviews about whether this was a 'beginner' dvd. It IS very challenging but the positions are all doable from a beginning perspective - and yet still leave room to grow along with the dvd.  As much as I love Kundalini yoga, this dvd really brought me back to the mental serenity and the smooth transition between positions that make it feel almost like a dance. After having done this routine 4 or 5 times, I can clearly feel the areas that are pleasantly (but not cruelly) sore from the exercises even having done other routines regularly. This just really helps me feel good about myself and where I am now. So glad I found this one.

I have now been doing this DVD for almost two months, and I can't praise it enough. Even though it is for beginners, one should not expect it to be easy at first.  One of the things that has helped me build up to better poses is to leave the heel flat on some of the balances for more stability. You should always listen to your body and not push yourself too far when first acclimating to a dvd.  Sometimes I think of my own variations to make certain poses more accessible for this fifty something gal.  By giving myself permission to not be perfect like her, I am also giving myself permission to be where I am -- and to improve. And I have seen big improvement in the two months.  This is my absolute favorite Yoga dvd. I feel powerful, strong and at peace -- even if only for that fify minutes a day.  I wish she would put out more dvds!",1428537600,2,1735,4.1891891891891895
2964477,3,B000WC38B4,"I'd probably give this video at least one more star if it weren't called ""Yoga for Beginners"". I wouldn't recommend it as a starting point for yoga as the poses aren't explained as well as they could be. Also, the workout itself is definitely beyond the just starting out level. I would say it is for those at an intermediate to advanced beginner exercise level. Also, I wouldn't recommend it for those who are very inflexible. The instructor gets into a deep lunge at one point that would be likely to scare inflexible people well away from yoga. I'm not saying this is a bad video. I just would not recommend it unless you are already in decent shape, have knowledge of basic yoga poses and don't think you would be intimidated by seeing a really flexible instructor go deep into some of the poses.",1427328000,,800,4.524137931034483

I hate beginner yoga DVD's that are all floor stretching or that move so slow that you don't feel like you get anything out of it.

I have a little experience with yoga, but I am still a beginner. I am about 50 pounds over weight, and very out of shape. I had no problem keeping up with the instructor. I read reviews that she didn't remind about breathing, and I thought she did, quite often. I think people need to remember that they are probably (hopefully) going to be using this dvd over and over, so they are going to get really, really sick of it if every 30 seconds she is telling you how to breath! She reminded the viewer when to inhale and exhale, and she did it often enough to be helpful, without getting annoying. I also read that people were upset that she didn't say enough when you couldn't see the instructor, I felt she explained things well, and maybe a good solution to those who are having trouble understanding what to do when you are in a pose where you can't look at the tv is for these users to watch this dvd a few times through before using.

2964512,3,B000WC38B4,"First of all, I want to make it clear I have never done yoga before.  I'm not in very good shape, either.  I got this DVD in a package set with two others, hoping that to slowly work my way through all of them as I improved and got into better shape.  I've been doing cardio and weights at the gym, but wanted something to focus on flexibility and my core.  Today, I popped this DVD into the player and got started, assuming that the poses would be fairly simple and we would be moving slowly.  It's supposed to be for beginners, right?

Maybe I am just too out of shape to do yoga, and should come back to it after losing some weight and building some muscle.  I made it through several of the poses, at least kind of.  It moves kind of fast, and there are not enough reminders to breathe properly and considering she says at the start to focus more on breathing than getting a really deep position, I was expecting more instruction on how and when to breathe in and out.  But I was sort of keeping up.  Then she reached a pose that I could tell would have caused me actual injury to do.  I stopped in my tracks.  Now I have it playing through and I am kind of watching it, trying to scope out what poses I can do without hurting myself.  Again, if it is marketed for beginners, it should be for beginners.  This is more like maintenance if you are already flexible, or if you are in good shape and just want to explore what yoga is like.  If that's you, you'll probably enjoy it.

The scenery is gorgeous.  Her voice is very soothing and calming.  I do have to say that I feel more open and ""alive,"" even after only doing part of it.  I feel like more oxygen is getting into my extremities.  I like how I feel.  I think what I will do now is watch the whole thing a couple of times, and try it again, doing the poses I am comfortable doing and stretching through the others.

Every time I complete the exercises, I feel very relaxed and calm, and my body feels wonderfully stretched and lengthened. I am probably flexible than most, but I will say that some of the poses are challenging, and require an initial flexibility from the user, most notably the pigeon pose, and the pose that follows it. If you have had no experience in yoga, dancing, or pilates, I think the exercises will be difficult for you, and I would recommend a different start-up DVD.

My only complaint is that the moves are somewhat repetitive (down-dog to [insert pose here], then inhale to open the back, exhale to open the chest), oddly, it got less so the more times I did the routine.
An important note: this is not power yoga. Anyone who prefers flow or Ten Minute Solutions yoga will probably not like these long, deep stretches (I personally enjoy both, although this is the sort of thing I would do before going to bed.) Elena's voice while not soft (like Sara Ivanhoe) is pleasant and does not interfere at all the the calming atmosphere. I like how accessible she makes yoga: first she'll tell you how to position yourself in a pose, then give the English, then the Sanskrit name.",1291507200,,983,4.590909090909091

I viewed the video three times: first just to view it, the second time trying to follow along, and the third time following along after having reading up on the poses on the internet.

2964620,5,B000WC38B4,"Elena Brower practices and teaches Anusara yoga, a school of hatha yoga which, as far as I can tell from her videos, tends to focus slightly more on the spiritual side of ourselves than other yogas I have tried.  That is not to say she preaches or even approaches anything religious, but that she reminds you throughout the practice to be grateful to yourself and to your motivation for practicing yoga.  She also focuses a great deal on deep breathing, even using your inhalations and exhalations to guide you deeper into the poses, and appears to approach her yoga with an almost meditative mindset.  I find it all quite healing on a mental level, a very grounding and fulfilling addition to doing yoga.  One thing I find unique to her methods is that she also reminds you to give a small smile here and there throughout the video, which is in itself healing and gratifying.  It's amazing to me what a small smile can do to help you relax further into a pose, and to keep you from straining yourself.

That said, she appears to be incredibly flexible (as she should be with 15 years of yoga under her belt), and though her poses are not necessarily difficult, at times she does move through them somewhat quickly--not in a hasty sense, but more as collective parts of one fluid movement.  She offers various creative and very deep stretches I have not seen in any other yoga programs, and while she verbally instructs ways to modify the pose if needed, perhaps less flexible viewers would benefit from having another practitioner on screen to display modifications.  I think that for someone completely new to yoga, it may prove a bit challenging to keep up.  At the very least, watch the video all the way through before trying it.  I would also recommend her AM/PM yoga program to anyone looking for a more basic introduction to yoga.  The segments are only around 30 minutes, and I found exactly what I would hope for from each;  AM was very awakening and energizing, and PM was relaxing and de-stressing.

To anyone with previous exposure and even mild experience with yoga, however, I think it this a great video with much to offer a very satisfying opportunity for growth!  I felt nothing but great on all counts after my first practice, and I'm excited to work this into my daily activities.

As a last note, something about her voice is very soothing and calming to me, and her mere presence on screen feels serene and respectful--a quality which, in my experience, is not entirely common among other yoga instructors.",1262390400,13,2528,4.6749435665914225

I would give this yoga DVD 5 stars, but I don't think it should be considered beginners.  I have taken yoga classes easier than this.

If you have taken yoga classes and wish to continue at home on your own time then I recommend this DVD.  However, if this is your first time with yoga try to take a beginners class first so you have a better understanding of how the poses should feel and look.

Just remember, the most important aspect of yoga is not how flexible you are but your focus on relaxed breathing and bettering the connection between your mind and body.  I like to think of it as active meditation.  Namaste",1253750400,2,892,4.331325301204819

2964664,5,B000WC38B4,"I just tried it for the first time today and was pleased.  I think some common sense can come in handy when trying this at first.  For example, not every pose is going to look the way it does on the dvd, at first or probably ever for some people (like me).  Elena Brower does mention this over and over again during some of the more taxing poses, offering small modifications if you can't do the full pose.

I do think Brower does a great job of explaining the poses.  They were confusing at first and I kept having to look up at the screen but I kind of expected that.  The first time, I did about 20 minutes of the DVD and was tired so stopped there.  The second time, I was able to do most of the 20 minutes without looking at the screen because it seemed to have sunk in.  I was able to make it through the rest of the DVD!

If you want total hand holding and lots of explanation about how to modify each pose I wouldn't recommend this DVD.  I for one appreciated Brower's example of how each pose should look; it was inspiring and I hope to reach that point.  She also offers words of encouragement that don't sound trite and she adds a light spiritual element to the instruction without being overbearing.",1247184000,,1211,4.199134199134199

The production value is amazing - for such a reasonable price.  I would have expected to pay twice the price for such a beautifully made workout DVD.

I also introduced my inflexible boyfriend to this DVD.  I started him off with Yoga for Inflexible people but he found the experience to be dull and offputting.

2964668,3,B000WC38B4,"I would describe myself as an ""advanced beginner"" yogi, as I've taken some classes and do a fairly regular home practice with videos or my own sequences. I am familiar with almost all of the poses Brower covers in this video, yet I found the practice frustrating and dissatisfying. Her focus on breathing is excellent, and one of the most important elements of a yoga practice. However, there was far too little discussion of alignment for each of the poses, which raises the risk of injury, especially in beginners. Where was the reminder to drop and relax the shoulders when arms are stretched overhead, or any mention of the ""sitting bones"" which are so crucially rooted downwards in seated poses? Brower's emphasis seemed to be on arm and hand positioning, where pelvis, hips, and legs were somewhat neglected. We need to check in with every part of our bodies in a yoga pose, and by the time I was able to do this, Brower was on to the next pose. A really good beginner yoga video can be vigorous and challenging, as this is, but it should still remind the practitioner to find and honor his or her ""edge"", the limit of ability and flexibilty at that particular moment, which this video does not do adequately. A few modifications of the more challenging poses would have been appreciated.

""Element: Yoga for Beginners"" is probably best suited to very strong beginners who have enough experience with yoga to provide their own alignment checks and who know how to modify poses to prevent strain and injury. I was able to follow along with occasional difficulty, but if I had tried to do this series of asanas as a complete beginner, I probably would have given it up in favor of a gentler practice and much more precise instruction.",1232928000,9,1738,4.6797385620915035

I was excited to get started, and popped the video in as soon as I got home.  The first 20 minutes went ok. I struggled a bit, but hey, I'm new! I'll get used to this! The the positions started to get tough, and I began to notice there really wasn't enough explanation on how to do the poses. I felt like I needed to pause and rewind quite often to make sure I didn't miss anything and to make sure I was doing it correctly. The biggest problem is that as a person new to yoga, it was often hard or impossible to actually do some of the poses. I realize as a newbie, I need to adjust and over time it will come easier, but I just felt left out! A beginner left out of a beginner video! Perhaps if you have ever participate in yoga before this is a way to get back into it, but its certainly not for someone who has never done it before.

I even took a class in college some years ago. But this video has really ignited a passion in me for yoga. I love the way she narrates. Her voice is soft and pleasant and her reminders to breathe or strengthen a particular muscle come at the perfect time. Her narrations also include imagery to 'see' your inner body through, which adds to the meditative aspect.

I'd start out with easy beginners yoga first to gain some basics - live classes are the best for this.  Then get into this DVD and as in any yoga practice, use it at your own pace, practice with your own pace.  It's a lifelong practice so don't expect to be all bendy and flexible as the instructors.

It's a mildly challenging workout with a good vinayasa sequence and focuses on lots of hip opening poses.  Beginners should just go at their own pace.  For example, I've been doing Yoga for about three months now and Chaturranga is still a very challenging pose for me.  I still have to do the modified version with knees on the floor.  Nearly all beginner video's show it in the unmodified form but I just go at my pace and remember that someday I will be able to do the full version.

There are two poses that I found difficult, one was a variation on the pigeon pose and the other a deep hip opening lunge variation.  The pigeon pose was especially challenging but if you go at your own pace, don't sink down to the floor but stay up on your arms and rest if you need to, it's accessible to even beginners.  I found that by conciously relaxing and using my breath I was able to get my elbows to the floor the first time I tried it.  The lunge variation was easier although more awkward at first.  I had to repeat it several times in a row before I felt comfortable with it.  It really does make your hips feel great and challenges your balance with the side twist.

The rest of the video is done at a challenging pace but still good for beginners and the poses are pretty basic.  I've done this video three times now and I have a feeling it will continue to be one of my favorites.  It's got beautiful scenery, a nice combination of poses, and the instructor is great.

I do get some shaky legs while trying to do some of the more intense stretches and I even wobble a bit on the standing poses - but, that's par for the course for me, so maybe that's why I don't notice it being ""advanced.""

Elena Browers has a gentle, soothing voice. I appreciate that she reminds us how to hold our gaze, breathe and even ""slightly smile"" (this becomes a thing - it's kinda cute). The music is very soft and New Age sounding.

The main menu has two choices - Play and Chapters. The submenu for Chapters has these parts:

Breathing and Warmup
Standing Poses/Sun Salutes
Twists/Hip Openers
Backbends
Forward Bends/Stretch

So one can certainly do the the disc in sections, but it's plain this is intended as an entire workout.

The postures are straightforward enough, but I admit being surprised the DVD is marketed for beginners. I have a hard time imagining a yoga novice would be able to follow along. One is expected to know what many of the postures are without discussion, and things move strongly and quickly. The only real rests are downward dogs until the backbending section (which finally provides a few crocodiles).

While Elena shows a mastery of graceful pose transitions, the choice of pigeon pose and the forward half split are odd beginner choices. Someone who is not very strong will need to create rests a few times, even though none of the poses are complicated. A strong, more advanced beginner will enjoy this DVD, however. I will add this to my rotation for a good basic yoga conditioning.

certain celebrity because of it. However, her presence on-screen
is bland and a bit distant. The pace of her instruction and the poses
are not always easy to follow and a complete beginner with whom I
shared this CD was totally befuddled.

It is a very nice to follow along practice, but you should know something about alignment beforehand. Start with some centering/breathing, then quite a bit of standing poses. I love Anusara because they don't overdo sun salutations. You just do 2 sun s's, then move on to the standard triangle, warrior 2, etc (and not too fast). A very soothing ending on the floor (and you can even replace backbend with the 2nd round of bridge...although she doesn't mention it).

To be totally fair, nobody should EVER learn yoga just from dvds and books.  One should attend classes and use these aids on the side or after having passed a certain level.

There are elements of this yoga video that I absolutely love; there are also elements that I do not like at all.

The Highs:
The scenery is absolutely gorgeous and the music is perfect for both the activity and the setting.
The beginning of the DVD is relaxing; with the breathing and the stretching it does wonders for your tension and stress.
The ending of the DVD is the same as the beginning.  Very relaxing, both the breathing and the stretching are as relaxing as it is invigorating.

The Lows:
The middle of the DVD she gets into some Yoga positioning and really doesn't take the time for the newbie to follow along.  Also she switches positions and what not without telling you so if you are not watching the TV screen the whole time you miss some very vital stuff.

I am not a beginner at Yoga, but most of my Yoga experience has been integrated with a Pilates based workout.  I watched the DVD twice before actually doing the exercises as when I do Yoga there are times I like to have my eyes closed.  That's next to impossible to do on the majority of the middle of the DVD.  A lot of the time you have to move fast and watch the whole time; I didn't like that at all. I prefer to listen to the voice guide me through the exercises.

The good definitely outweighs the bad, but I can already tell it's not going to be one of my favorite exercise DVD's.

I like how the lesson flows and how I feel afterwards. I highly recommend that you add this DVD to your collection.",1206835200,,457,4.159090909090909
2964763,4,B000WC38B4,"I don't know if I am the ideal person to write this review, because I have practiced yoga on and off for 10 years.  If you take the time to study the poses--perhaps just watch the DVD the first time through--I think this could be excellent beginner material.  Just keep in mind that you get to the final poses through practice, and you can take intermediate positions if you are not sufficiently flexible at first.

That being said, I imagine that this routine would get pretty old after the first three times.  However, $3.33 per yoga class is not a bad way to get a good grounding in the essentials, and you can always move on from there.",1206576000,,640,4.398305084745763
2964764,3,B000WC38B4,"I am someone who has done some Yoga postures on and off over the years, but never in a sustained, intensive way.  I am also quite familiar with most Eastern spiritual and health techniques, having done a lot of meditation and some Tai Chi and Chi Gong as well.

I found this DVD to be quite well produced and the workout well structured.  However, everything is done to conform to standard New Age style and expectations.  The logos and intro look like every other similar DVD, and the music is straight out of every New Age massage session.  In other words, never annoying, but also quite conventional.

Overall, the Yoga program itself is suited for someone who has been to at least one or two Yoga classes at the local park or school.  Not only is there no preliminary explanation of what we are doing and why, but also no general explanation of Yoga concepts and how postures fit into that.

So, if you have done a few Yoga classes, know what it is about, and simply want a good Yoga program for home practice, this is fine, but if you are wondering ""What is this Yoga thing people are doing?"", then this is not the right DVD for you.",1206057600,3,1138,4.385714285714286

I highly recommend this DVD for something who is brand new to the world of Yoga and wants an easy introduction.  But it does stay very easy and you will definately outgrow it within about a month.

2964766,3,B000WC38B4,"Having had prior Yoga experience, I really enjoyed this DVD, the setting is beautiful, extremely relaxing, the instructor a very calming voice but it's really a shame that she chose to title this Yoga for Beginners. Ive done yoga in a studio and own a few other Yoga DVD's that I really enjoy so I already know the poses and know what to expect and my other DVD's have instructors that cater to all levels; one DVD I own has three instructor each dressed in a different color and they tell you at the beginning that the instructor in blue is for a beginner and red is for an intermediate and green for the expert so you can watch the person who's level you are at and as you have more experience you don't need to run out and buy another DVD, you just watch the instructor on the next level. Another video I own gives you suggested modifications depending on your level and flexibility. Yoga for Beginners does none of these things. So, what I meant when I said it was a shame that this DVD was not properly titled is that it is a great DVD for someone who already has experience doing yoga NOT the beginner and I feel that a lot of people who have no experience with yoga are going to be unhappy with their purchase. What I love about yoga is it's the type of discipline where you should always go at your own pace but that being said what is lacking on this DVD is suggested ways to modify a pose to meet a physical limitation or just getting the basic poses down you. So, I think that an absolute beginner is going to get pretty frustrated pretty quickly and most likely never pick it up again. The title is very misleading, I would not recommend this for a true beginner.",1205971200,9,1675,4.270440251572327

Lengthy for the beginner
What causes a problem here is that the session is rather lengthy for the beginner.  There needs to be levels to work up to if it is to be called a beginner's session.  How do you keep up... skip this....try this....?  Do a minute of this, that,  skip......too hard here, etc., etc.  It becomes too difficult to keep up with if you are truly a beginner,  stiff and not able to stretch.

Not sufficient instruction
I have done some Yoga through a few videotapes, and I have compared beginner's instruction and noted that this is void of sufficient instruction for the beginner it targets.

Poses
You may have difficulty getting to keep up with these poses, don't be discouraged and what may happen is when you can't keep up, you give up!

Beautiful Scenery
Yes, the scenery is beautiful!!  Music is soothing.  If you are very new to Yoga, and not young and flexible, this will be difficult.....Rizzo",1205884800,3,1126,4.717948717948718
2964768,5,B000WC38B4,"There are countless options for products geared towards Yoga for beginners, but this is the first DVD I watched that has all the elements that I think should be present in a product like this. In many other cases, I have found that the asanas are too elementary, and after a month of following the lessons you are ready to move to something else. This DVD has a very nice flow, starting with a few minutes of breathing exercises and then moving on to your typical Yoga 101 asanas, setting up the next step. The pace starts to increase a little and there are some slightly more difficult poses, transforming this into a yoga flow practice, with poses that will challenge you for a while.

For the absolute beginner, there is a very brief intro before the practice starts, mentioning the benefits of Yoga and the way in which it should be practiced. The only fault I found is that there is no mention to the fact that you should not eat in the couple of hours before a session (unless it is a very light snack). And then, there is the setting! The spirituality of yoga is partly lost when you get a DVD with people practicing in a bland studio. In this case the beautiful scenery definitely helps with the mood. As does the fact that instead of talking and demonstrating the poses simultaneously, the instructor is just focusing on the practice and we get her voice-over with the commentary.

The advice on how to do the postures right is clear and to the point, and even though some beginners may be challenged as the DVD progresses, I think that in a couple of weeks you should be able to follow the flow of the lesson with no major problems. This is an excellent choice to get into yoga, especially if you are looking to increase your overall well-being, as well as your tone and flexibility.

2964771,4,B000WC38B4,"I'm still not up to snuff on yoga, but I have been taking classes locally.  In our classes, we use bricks and straps to help with our poses, for those of us not limber enough to do them without.  Unfortunately this DVD doesn't even make the suggestion to use props; the woman performing does all the poses without props.  If you needed, but didn't know already how, to add the props to a routine, this DVD would probably dissuade you from doing yoga.

The scenery is good and the instructor doesn't change poses too quickly.  Since I do have my props I'm able to adjust the poses accordingly and thus this is a perfectly acceptable DVD (although not as good as a real class).

2964823,4,B000WC38B4,"In ""Yoga for Beginners,"" a 50 minute DVD , Elena Brower takes one though the paces of a beginner workout in a relaxed and casual setting.

Her approach is in a true yoga fashion: low-keyed with full explanations of how one gets into the various yoga positions; explanations of what one should feel at first and what one will eventually feel in each position; and, the right-way, and wrong-way, one can do a position.

For almost a year I have been attending a twice-a-week Pilates class that is supplemented with yoga.  It is taught by four instructors, all who have a similar, yet, sometimes unique, approach to their class.  All are excellent.

With Ms. Brower's DVD, I found the consistent approach that comes with the use of a DVD comforting and predictable, especially for a beginner.

Ms. Brower does a great job in developing the beginning yoga disciple.  I found the DVD approach is MUST because without it, I tend to get off-track and do what I find enjoyable, instead of doing everything as it was intended.

I would recommend this DVD to anyone considering yoga.  It is excellent!  If you find yoga fits your bill, I would suggest that you get a book that shows the positions.  That way you can look at them at your leisure to make sure you are doing them correctly.

As with my Pilates class, Ms. Brower stresses that you should not over extend yourself, or do anything that you feel is hurting your body.

BTW, I mentioned about the benefits of yoga.  For years, I had some lower back aches that erupted into a serious problem for me this past year.  After going to the orthopedic surgeon several times and getting mixed results, I began doing Pilates because I had heard of its benefit for the back muscles. Within a month, I began to notice that my problem was less after my Pilates, and yoga, sessions.  My doctor told me that most lower back pain comes from not stretching out the hamstring muscles.  Knock on wood, it's been almost two months since I've had those pains.  While my situation may have been unique to me, in hindsight, I would recommend to anyone in their 20's and 30's to learn some yoga or Pilates and how to stretch their muscles.  Don't wait until you are in your 40's or 50's and you have to learn to live with pain.",1203552000,3,2253,4.518518518518518

2964825,4,B000WC38B4,"This is a beautifully filmed, high quality DVD, with a gorgeous setting, a skilled model, and a calming voice walking you through the breathing/movements.

As pretty much a total beginner, I found this DVD a bit long.  Also, the instructor gives very specific directions regarding breathing and positioning, and I dearly wanted feedback about whether I was actually doing what I was supposed to.

The pacing also seemed slow to me.  Granted, I may be a bit ADD, but 45 minutes is more than I can spare for a regular exercise routine at this point in my life.

I guess it depends on what you want from a yoga DVD.  This particular DVD seems like a very serious introduction to learning and practicing yoga, as opposed to a yoga DVD that might less orthodox.  My favorite yoga DVD is Stress Relief Yoga, which keeps my attention by moving at a rapid pace (20 minutes), and completely relaxes me.  I have fallen asleep on the floor after doing that DVD!!  That DVD, however, has many reviews criticizing it for moving too quickly and not holding poses long enough.

So I'd recommend this DVD for anyone who has a yoga instructor and wants to work on poses and stretches at home, for anyone who wants to undertake a serious study of yoga (but then I'd recommend an instructor!), or for anyone who wants a 45 minute yoga regime and is confident they understand positioning and breathing.",1203552000,,1382,4.627049180327869

I was thinking as I was looking at the lowest star reviews (I always read the lowest ones first) and thinking that in this case some people might have mistaken Beginning Yoga for Yoga for the Not Yet Fit.  While Ms Brower addresses the possibility that a viewer may not be in condition to perform some of the poses, she does assume a minimum amount of flexibility and strength in the student.

The production values on this DVD are very good.  The background is serene and beautiful and Ms. Brower's voice is pleasantly calm.  In fact, I have to admit that the first time I veiwed this I fell asleep-- but it was at the end of a very tiring, stressful week.  Since then I have found that this can provide a pleasant interlude when life and/or work are too demanding.

2964827,5,B000WC38B4,"This DVD has quite a good introduction to what is usually known as Yoga. The mind and body elements are very well represented in the description of the moves, as well as the narrative of the DVD ""Class"".The audio and visual elements that supplement the class are well crafted. Staying with the voice of the teacher was a good move, since
she has a very good tone of voice, key in the teaching of any of the schools, as well as being superbly photogenic.

I have done a variety of classes since the 1970s ( as a student), and the traditionalist schools are rarely as accessible as depicted in this DVD. Most of the teaching of YOGA ( YUKTA) can either aim for physical union with God ( not simply healthy responses) or good relaxation techniques that allow one to follow certain paths to access God.

Whilst the state aim of ""Build Strength,Increase flexibility, calm your mind and revitalise your body"" is a necessary by-product of most advanced teaching in YOGA, the basic forms in the original Sanskrit are very difficult. What we have here is a very westernised form of the Traditional Yoga. As several of my teachers taught me, you get
from the class what you take to it: if you want this to be a starting point it can be. You can try easing gently into some of the moves, but if it is too much for you, then freeze the DVD frame, and see how you can modify the move so that you still keep the ""beat"" but also keep the ability to develop. Its a very good Disc... if you can't do
any of the moves, I can definitely recommend it as a meditation guide; what you do is see your ""inner self""  doing the moves... you might be surprised just how fulfilling this can be.",1203465600,2,1666,4.35048231511254
2964828,4,B000WC38B4,"This is a beautiful DVD, the setting is stunning, the music and narration are balanced well so neither overwhelms the other.  For the most part the camera manages to capture the various poses well enough for a beginning student to follow.

The instruction beginnings slowly with a series of breathing excercises, moving on through standing and then stretching poses closing with more breathing/relaxation.  The poses didn't seem too complicated when I was just watching but when I tried to follow along my perception changed.  I have no experience with yoga, which makes me a true beginner.  I lasted just over ten minutes the first time through which lead me to my first problem.  Should I pause the dvd, rest and then resume?, stop and try to get further the next time? skip to the final section?  There really was very little support for the true beginner which leads me to think that this DVD would be better suited to someone who has had at least some yoga instruction before attempting this.

The instructor did mention modifying some poses, particularly towards the end of the session but some of these instructions were only mentioned, not demonstrated.  For example the instructor stated that it was very important to flex the foot while executing one pose but did not explain exactly what she meant by that direction.  It would have been helpful if there had been a close-up of her foot at that point so the student could have seen what was meant.

Overall though this is a good excercise DVD, one that has introduced at least this couch potato to a new way to excercise despite inclement weather or a busy schedule.",1203465600,2,1626,4.771428571428571
2964829,5,B000WC38B4,"This is the very first time I have ever tried yoga. My doctor suggested yoga as a good way to reduce my stress and improve my health. Just to let you know upfront, I'm pretty out of shape and I haven't exercised regularly for months so I was not able to do a lot of the positions right away. I know it will take some practice and improvement on my part before I can. I like that the instructor reaffirmed several times that it is ok to go at your own pace.

I was impressed with the quality of this production and I felt it soothing just to watch the instructor perform in the beautiful seaside location. The scenery was beautiful, the background music was calming and unobtrusive, and the instructor was knowledgeable and easy to follow. So many exercise video instructors get carried away with trying to be dynamic on camera that they come across as phony. This was not the case on the DVD. I found Elena Brower to be calming and genuine in her approach.

I also liked that there were not extra pieces needed for this workout. She did suggest to use a yoga mat if you had one but it wasn't a requirement. All you need is the DVD and your very own self.

After reading other reviews, I was aware that the poses were not as easy as they looked.  So it came as no surprise that the routine was difficult for me.  What was surprising was the calm I felt after stumbling my way through it.  As a rank beginner, I had no idea of the inner peace and satisfaction that would be mine.

I'll keep after it, and I am certain that in my own time I'll get there, physically as well as mentally and spiritually.

2964832,4,B000WC38B4,"What is nicely beginner-y about this video is that, although she's obviously a pro, the teacher doesn't show off and doesn't make us feel hopelessly inadequate. Whereas many yoga videos show a teacher bending like a rubber pretzel, this one doesn't. She'll say ""reach to the floor, or your shins"" and instead of slapping her hands all the way down on the floor, which would hurt most of us and make us want to give up, she touches her shins. Hey--I can do that too. She tells you to move in a certain way, ""possibly coming down on to your elbows and, someday, even your forehead."" Someday is good.
Nice videography: she's outdoors, on a small platform surrounded by green grass and flowers, with a bright blue-sky and water in the distance. It's a nice balance of open and contained (not austere). Better used in the daytime; using this video at night feels out of whack, because it's such a sunny daytime on the set.
The narration is done by voiceover (i.e. she's not talking while she's practicing yoga). The presentation is basic, not overly platitudinous. Her voice is smooth and grounded, though first-timers might find she moves a bit quickly (just a bit). After five minutes I reverted to just watching it all the way through once without playing along. (Anyway it's a little hard to do downward dog and watch a video at the same time. Watch it once first and you won't need to look at the screen as often.)
A true beginner is not going to be able to do everything the teacher does and make it look like she does. If you aren't already doing some stretching exercise, this will quickly make you realize how inflexible you are.
The whole video, especially its first half, is heavy on downward dog and related poses. Occasionally she'll refer to ""downward-facing dog"" or ""warrior 1"" or other poses without explaining those terms, but if you're watching you'll understand. Actually it's nice not to have to hear a dictionary lecture. This is all action; the talk is secondary.
The whole is five chapters but if you just ""Play"" you get one unbroken stream of video, with no indication of where any ""chapters"" are. Choosing a chapter from the main menu just transports you to a certain spot in the video.
The 50 minutes goes by fairly quickly. There's a 5- or 10-minute warm-down at the end.
No props are used except a yoga mat. No people appear in the video except the teacher.",1203120000,8,2380,4.615566037735849

I was surprised by how challenging it was! I had thought yoga was basically just stretching, but it's amazing how much of a workout I got. Many of the poses require you to work hard on your balance, which gives you a great core workout. Being a newbie, I have a long way to go and I think this video will last me for a while.

Brower starts the workout off slow, with breathing exercises and gentle seated twists.  After that, she picks up the pace, with a series of sun salutations, standing poses, hip openers, and backbends.  As a result, a true beginner to yoga may have to view the workout a few times to understand the names and forms of the various poses.  Brower does not go into detail on positioning, but the workout has been filmed well and gives good visual cues.  The overall workout is fairly brief but provides a good introductory survey of many classic yoga poses. Brower doesn't stint on time in a given position, so some of the poses will feel intense to a beginner.  Viewers who are more experienced in yoga may find the routine a pleasant one to use on low-key days.  I liked the balance between flow from pose to pose and time in each pose as well as the emphasis on the breath.  These elements may make the routine challenging for some beginners, but they result in a program that feels more true to the goals of yoga than many other beginner routines.",1202947200,,1309,4.616379310344827

While I can see why they might think that, I have to disagree.  As Elena Brower states in the beginning, viewers need to take things at their own pace and only do the movements to where they are comfortable.

As a practitioner of Bickram yoga, I found this to be a more soothing and less intense alternative.  Elena's soothing voice guides you through a very complete workout and with her perfect posing in a lush environment, it is a pleasure and inspiration to watch and workout to.

Other reviewers have done a good job dissecting the disc so I won't go there.  Let me simply state that this is a yoga DVD that I will open revisit when I want to have a less taxing yoga session than what Bickram's routine offers.

With that in mind, I've been looking into various books and videos, and finding them generally either too physically demanding or too involved in the spiritual side of yoga practice.  I'm sorry to say that ""Yoga for Beginners"" is no exception, in spite of the name.  In fact it might be more properly titled ""Yoga for Beginners Who are Otherwise Quite Strong and Flexible.""

In an approximately 50 minute workout, Elena Brower demonstrates a beautiful, flowing workout which looks like it must feel wonderful, if you can manage to follow it.  Unfortunately I have neither the strength nor the flexibility to do so.  I'm guessing that most of my friends don't either, so it does seem to me that it might be a good idea to offer hints for modifications of the poses to suit older, heavier or simply out-of-shape students.  But Brower offers very little in the way of such modifications.  I'd guess that about two-thirds of the workout is simply not do-able for me without substantial modification.

At the same time, the poses themselves look quite wonderful, and if you've ever done stretching and/or deep breathing exercises, the pleasure of these poses will be almost palpable to you.  Brower's voice is calming.  She doesn't rush you through the poses, but at the same time she doesn't spend a lot of time explaining them.  Because the practice is slow and deliberate, this isn't as big a problem as it might be during an aerobics video, but as a beginner, I'd have appreciated a bit more information.

Right at the beginning, Brower suggests that the deep breathing is far more important than a deep pose.  I think it would be helpful if she reiterated that during the actual workout.

Over all, it's a pretty, calming video as long as you don't allow yourself to get too torqued if you can't do the moves, or you fall out of them frequently.  If you can make the necessary modifications for your own fitness level, you may well get something out of this video.  Otherwise, keep looking for a good beginning yoga workout.  There must be one out there.",1202688000,32,2129,4.708108108108108

I have a lot of joint pain and I just never felt great after a workout of running, spinning, weights, etc. I got tendonitis in my elbow recently and was told to not to lift weights. I tried yoga because my aunt in Florida loves it. I bought this DVD at a grocery store and I have done it every day for 15 days so far! I even brought it on a trip and watched it on my computer. I am a different person. It is amazing that the first time I tried this I was so tight I could hardly bend forward! I tried Yoga years ago and I was amazed at how easy this DVD was to follow. I can bend further every time I watch it and I use the breathing many during the day to just calm myself. I also have tried to lose 5 pounds over the last year and I have already lost 3 pounds. I am calmer, more flexible, happier and I feel leaner. I feel like I have tapped into something so great. I really want to go further with more poses and with the breathing so I am looking forward to a second DVD. I wish I lived in New York so I could meet Elena Brower. I love her soft, gentle, empowering teaching style. I have never felt better. Thank you so much, Lisa Corwin from Iowa

Now my all time favorite real beginner's DVD is Pilates Complete for Inflexible People by Maggie Rhoades. You don't get the Hawaiian scenery but you should be able to tackle most of the exercises.

Elena Brower's delivery is clear, concise, and precise in guiding the 'participant' through a Yoga routine that is at once easy to follow for beginners...yet stimulating and challenging enough for Yoga practitioners to do.  It's no wonder that Elena's New York studio attracts both newcomers and Hollywood celebrities.  If you're a ""newbie"" to Yoga, by all means get this beautiful beginner workout, and watch it first all the way through to get familiar with the movements before you do it.

3198901,2,B000WC38B4,"This is not yoga for beginners, unless you are already in fairly sound physical condition with no major issues with your body, joints, and movement. I have ankylosing spondylitis and despite my on regular workouts, I have movement restrictions that are very slow to loosen up, much like someone who is simply inflexible do to physical inactivity.
I've really been trying to like yoga and got this because its supposed to be for beginners. Within 10 minutes of the video, it feels just like most other so called beginner yoga, as if there is a race to do as many postures as possible in the alloted amount of time. Not much time to adjust yourself and get to know the position before she starts racing you into the next pose using ""yoga speak"" as if you already know what she means by many of the phrases.
I've been a personal trainer for 10 years and I can't even begin to imagine bringing in a new client in the physical condition of a beginner and then racing them through lifts quickly with language I'm familiar with and they are not, and not bothering to slow down and explain what I mean. I also wonder why so many western yoga practicioners fail to realize that most people here can't sit cross legged for long very easily because we don't sit on the floor cross legged most of our life like they do in places where yoga  has its roots.  The amount of stress placed on the hip capsule for those with previous injuries, inflammation and arthritic conditons such as mine and movement restrictions is unnecessary and it would be much better to work through internal and external rotational movements before going right into a cross legged position as the first move.

Worse, as with the yoga classes I've attended, the instructor does the nice perfect looking version of the pose and at best gives you a quick minor adjustment to make if you are having difficulty with the move. For many of the moves, the adjustment isn't helpful in overcoming the challenges to the movement and you are  left either guessing at how to adjust the move yourself or just breathing and waiting for her to get back into something within your range.  While I was able to do the DVD, it felt like a fight with my own body because of the pace and lack of clear explanations and  modifications. I can't imagine someone who hasn't been working out regularly trying to complete this if they have movement restrictions and problems with their joints.

The pros, she has a very calming and gentle voice and the scenery is relaxing. The con, its really an intermediate yoga DVD and should clearly be labeled as such.

I started off doing yoga from Elena Brower's AM PM Yoga several years ago -- and then moved into Kundalini DVDs, but I just got this one a week or two ago and it is my new favorite!! I know there was a lot of discussion in other reviews about whether this was a 'beginner' dvd. It IS very challenging but the positions are all doable from a beginning perspective - and yet still leave room to grow along with the dvd.  As much as I love Kundalini yoga, this dvd really brought me back to the mental serenity and the smooth transition between positions that make it feel almost like a dance. After having done this routine 4 or 5 times, I can clearly feel the areas that are pleasantly (but not cruelly) sore from the exercises even having done other routines regularly. This just really helps me feel good about myself and where I am now. So glad I found this one.

I have now been doing this DVD for almost two months, and I can't praise it enough. Even though it is for beginners, one should not expect it to be easy at first.  One of the things that has helped me build up to better poses is to leave the heel flat on some of the balances for more stability. You should always listen to your body and not push yourself too far when first acclimating to a dvd.  Sometimes I think of my own variations to make certain poses more accessible for this fifty something gal.  By giving myself permission to not be perfect like her, I am also giving myself permission to be where I am -- and to improve. And I have seen big improvement in the two months.  This is my absolute favorite Yoga dvd. I feel powerful, strong and at peace -- even if only for that fify minutes a day.  I wish she would put out more dvds!",1428537600,2,1735,4.1891891891891895

I would say it is for those at an intermediate to advanced beginner exercise level. Also, I wouldn't recommend it for those who are very inflexible.

I got this DVD in a package set with two others, hoping that to slowly work my way through all of them as I improved and got into better shape.  I've been doing cardio and weights at the gym, but wanted something to focus on flexibility and my core.  Today, I popped this DVD into the player and got started, assuming that the poses would be fairly simple and we would be moving slowly.  It's supposed to be for beginners, right?

Maybe I am just too out of shape to do yoga, and should come back to it after losing some weight and building some muscle.  I made it through several of the poses, at least kind of.  It moves kind of fast, and there are not enough reminders to breathe properly and considering she says at the start to focus more on breathing than getting a really deep position, I was expecting more instruction on how and when to breathe in and out.  But I was sort of keeping up.  Then she reached a pose that I could tell would have caused me actual injury to do.  I stopped in my tracks.  Now I have it playing through and I am kind of watching it, trying to scope out what poses I can do without hurting myself.  Again, if it is marketed for beginners, it should be for beginners.  This is more like maintenance if you are already flexible, or if you are in good shape and just want to explore what yoga is like.  If that's you, you'll probably enjoy it.

The scenery is gorgeous.  Her voice is very soothing and calming.  I do have to say that I feel more open and ""alive,"" even after only doing part of it.  I feel like more oxygen is getting into my extremities.  I like how I feel.  I think what I will do now is watch the whole thing a couple of times, and try it again, doing the poses I am comfortable doing and stretching through the others.

My only complaint is that the moves are somewhat repetitive (down-dog to [insert pose here], then inhale to open the back, exhale to open the chest), oddly, it got less so the more times I did the routine.
An important note: this is not power yoga. Anyone who prefers flow or Ten Minute Solutions yoga will probably not like these long, deep stretches (I personally enjoy both, although this is the sort of thing I would do before going to bed.)

I viewed the video three times: first just to view it, the second time trying to follow along, and the third time following along after having reading up on the poses on the internet.

3199117,5,B000WC38B4,"Elena Brower practices and teaches Anusara yoga, a school of hatha yoga which, as far as I can tell from her videos, tends to focus slightly more on the spiritual side of ourselves than other yogas I have tried.  That is not to say she preaches or even approaches anything religious, but that she reminds you throughout the practice to be grateful to yourself and to your motivation for practicing yoga.  She also focuses a great deal on deep breathing, even using your inhalations and exhalations to guide you deeper into the poses, and appears to approach her yoga with an almost meditative mindset.  I find it all quite healing on a mental level, a very grounding and fulfilling addition to doing yoga.  One thing I find unique to her methods is that she also reminds you to give a small smile here and there throughout the video, which is in itself healing and gratifying.  It's amazing to me what a small smile can do to help you relax further into a pose, and to keep you from straining yourself.

That said, she appears to be incredibly flexible (as she should be with 15 years of yoga under her belt), and though her poses are not necessarily difficult, at times she does move through them somewhat quickly--not in a hasty sense, but more as collective parts of one fluid movement.  She offers various creative and very deep stretches I have not seen in any other yoga programs, and while she verbally instructs ways to modify the pose if needed, perhaps less flexible viewers would benefit from having another practitioner on screen to display modifications.  I think that for someone completely new to yoga, it may prove a bit challenging to keep up.  At the very least, watch the video all the way through before trying it.  I would also recommend her AM/PM yoga program to anyone looking for a more basic introduction to yoga.  The segments are only around 30 minutes, and I found exactly what I would hope for from each;  AM was very awakening and energizing, and PM was relaxing and de-stressing.

To anyone with previous exposure and even mild experience with yoga, however, I think it this a great video with much to offer a very satisfying opportunity for growth!  I felt nothing but great on all counts after my first practice, and I'm excited to work this into my daily activities.

As a last note, something about her voice is very soothing and calming to me, and her mere presence on screen feels serene and respectful--a quality which, in my experience, is not entirely common among other yoga instructors.",1262390400,13,2528,4.6749435665914225

I would give this yoga DVD 5 stars, but I don't think it should be considered beginners.  I have taken yoga classes easier than this.

If you have taken yoga classes and wish to continue at home on your own time then I recommend this DVD.  However, if this is your first time with yoga try to take a beginners class first so you have a better understanding of how the poses should feel and look.

Just remember, the most important aspect of yoga is not how flexible you are but your focus on relaxed breathing and bettering the connection between your mind and body.  I like to think of it as active meditation.  Namaste",1253750400,2,892,4.331325301204819

3199161,5,B000WC38B4,"I just tried it for the first time today and was pleased.  I think some common sense can come in handy when trying this at first.  For example, not every pose is going to look the way it does on the dvd, at first or probably ever for some people (like me).  Elena Brower does mention this over and over again during some of the more taxing poses, offering small modifications if you can't do the full pose.

I do think Brower does a great job of explaining the poses.  They were confusing at first and I kept having to look up at the screen but I kind of expected that.  The first time, I did about 20 minutes of the DVD and was tired so stopped there.  The second time, I was able to do most of the 20 minutes without looking at the screen because it seemed to have sunk in.  I was able to make it through the rest of the DVD!

If you want total hand holding and lots of explanation about how to modify each pose I wouldn't recommend this DVD.  I for one appreciated Brower's example of how each pose should look; it was inspiring and I hope to reach that point.  She also offers words of encouragement that don't sound trite and she adds a light spiritual element to the instruction without being overbearing.",1247184000,,1211,4.199134199134199

The instructor is a little late on the cuing - but if you watch it a couple of times - you can get a sense of the timing.  But aside from that, I love the element series.  The production value is amazing - for such a reasonable price.  I would have expected to pay twice the price for such a beautifully made workout DVD.

I also introduced my inflexible boyfriend to this DVD.  I started him off with Yoga for Inflexible people but he found the experience to be dull and offputting.

I am familiar with almost all of the poses Brower covers in this video, yet I found the practice frustrating and dissatisfying. Her focus on breathing is excellent, and one of the most important elements of a yoga practice. However, there was far too little discussion of alignment for each of the poses, which raises the risk of injury, especially in beginners. Where was the reminder to drop and relax the shoulders when arms are stretched overhead, or any mention of the ""sitting bones"" which are so crucially rooted downwards in seated poses? Brower's emphasis seemed to be on arm and hand positioning, where pelvis, hips, and legs were somewhat neglected. We need to check in with every part of our bodies in a yoga pose, and by the time I was able to do this, Brower was on to the next pose. A really good beginner yoga video can be vigorous and challenging, as this is, but it should still remind the practitioner to find and honor his or her ""edge"", the limit of ability and flexibilty at that particular moment, which this video does not do adequately. A few modifications of the more challenging poses would have been appreciated.

""Element: Yoga for Beginners"" is probably best suited to very strong beginners who have enough experience with yoga to provide their own alignment checks and who know how to modify poses to prevent strain and injury. I was able to follow along with occasional difficulty, but if I had tried to do this series of asanas as a complete beginner, I probably would have given it up in favor of a gentler practice and much more precise instruction.",1232928000,9,1738,4.6797385620915035

I was excited to get started, and popped the video in as soon as I got home.  The first 20 minutes went ok. I struggled a bit, but hey, I'm new! I'll get used to this! The the positions started to get tough, and I began to notice there really wasn't enough explanation on how to do the poses. I felt like I needed to pause and rewind quite often to make sure I didn't miss anything and to make sure I was doing it correctly. The biggest problem is that as a person new to yoga, it was often hard or impossible to actually do some of the poses. I realize as a newbie, I need to adjust and over time it will come easier, but I just felt left out! A beginner left out of a beginner video! Perhaps if you have ever participate in yoga before this is a way to get back into it, but its certainly not for someone who has never done it before.

I even took a class in college some years ago. But this video has really ignited a passion in me for yoga. I love the way she narrates. Her voice is soft and pleasant and her reminders to breathe or strengthen a particular muscle come at the perfect time. Her narrations also include imagery to 'see' your inner body through, which adds to the meditative aspect.

I'd start out with easy beginners yoga first to gain some basics - live classes are the best for this.  Then get into this DVD and as in any yoga practice, use it at your own pace, practice with your own pace.  It's a lifelong practice so don't expect to be all bendy and flexible as the instructors.

It's a mildly challenging workout with a good vinayasa sequence and focuses on lots of hip opening poses.  Beginners should just go at their own pace.  For example, I've been doing Yoga for about three months now and Chaturranga is still a very challenging pose for me.  I still have to do the modified version with knees on the floor.  Nearly all beginner video's show it in the unmodified form but I just go at my pace and remember that someday I will be able to do the full version.

There are two poses that I found difficult, one was a variation on the pigeon pose and the other a deep hip opening lunge variation.  The pigeon pose was especially challenging but if you go at your own pace, don't sink down to the floor but stay up on your arms and rest if you need to, it's accessible to even beginners.  I found that by conciously relaxing and using my breath I was able to get my elbows to the floor the first time I tried it.  The lunge variation was easier although more awkward at first.  I had to repeat it several times in a row before I felt comfortable with it.  It really does make your hips feel great and challenges your balance with the side twist.

The rest of the video is done at a challenging pace but still good for beginners and the poses are pretty basic.  I've done this video three times now and I have a feeling it will continue to be one of my favorites.  It's got beautiful scenery, a nice combination of poses, and the instructor is great.

The scenery and music is beautiful and I love her little spoken ""gems"" here and there (Honor your effort of coming to your practice today).

I do get some shaky legs while trying to do some of the more intense stretches and I even wobble a bit on the standing poses - but, that's par for the course for me, so maybe that's why I don't notice it being ""advanced.""

Elena Browers has a gentle, soothing voice. I appreciate that she reminds us how to hold our gaze, breathe and even ""slightly smile"" (this becomes a thing - it's kinda cute). The music is very soft and New Age sounding.

The main menu has two choices - Play and Chapters. The submenu for Chapters has these parts:

Breathing and Warmup
Standing Poses/Sun Salutes
Twists/Hip Openers
Backbends
Forward Bends/Stretch

So one can certainly do the the disc in sections, but it's plain this is intended as an entire workout.

The postures are straightforward enough, but I admit being surprised the DVD is marketed for beginners. I have a hard time imagining a yoga novice would be able to follow along. One is expected to know what many of the postures are without discussion, and things move strongly and quickly. The only real rests are downward dogs until the backbending section (which finally provides a few crocodiles).

While Elena shows a mastery of graceful pose transitions, the choice of pigeon pose and the forward half split are odd beginner choices. Someone who is not very strong will need to create rests a few times, even though none of the poses are complicated. A strong, more advanced beginner will enjoy this DVD, however. I will add this to my rotation for a good basic yoga conditioning.

certain celebrity because of it. However, her presence on-screen
is bland and a bit distant. The pace of her instruction and the poses
are not always easy to follow and a complete beginner with whom I
shared this CD was totally befuddled.

It is a very nice to follow along practice, but you should know something about alignment beforehand. Start with some centering/breathing, then quite a bit of standing poses. I love Anusara because they don't overdo sun salutations. You just do 2 sun s's, then move on to the standard triangle, warrior 2, etc (and not too fast). A very soothing ending on the floor (and you can even replace backbend with the 2nd round of bridge...although she doesn't mention it).

To be totally fair, nobody should EVER learn yoga just from dvds and books.  One should attend classes and use these aids on the side or after having passed a certain level.

The beginning of the DVD is relaxing; with the breathing and the stretching it does wonders for your tension and stress.
The ending of the DVD is the same as the beginning.  Very relaxing, both the breathing and the stretching are as relaxing as it is invigorating.

The Lows:
The middle of the DVD she gets into some Yoga positioning and really doesn't take the time for the newbie to follow along.  Also she switches positions and what not without telling you so if you are not watching the TV screen the whole time you miss some very vital stuff.

I am not a beginner at Yoga, but most of my Yoga experience has been integrated with a Pilates based workout.  I watched the DVD twice before actually doing the exercises as when I do Yoga there are times I like to have my eyes closed.  That's next to impossible to do on the majority of the middle of the DVD.  A lot of the time you have to move fast and watch the whole time; I didn't like that at all. I prefer to listen to the voice guide me through the exercises.

The good definitely outweighs the bad, but I can already tell it's not going to be one of my favorite exercise DVD's.

What if you can't do a pose right away, how do you start slowly and safely until you accomplish the correct and full pose? I am a beginner and I am not sure how to do it. But I do agree with the others, once you get better you probably won't get bored, it will still be a good workout.",1207094400,2,461,4.25

But I know what I like and what I am looking for . . . slow, deep stretches, holding, and breathing into the postures.  I don't like bouncing around in my yoga or doing calisthenics or any other goofy thing.  Elena Brower is calm, steady, and reassuring in her voice over.  I like how the lesson flows and how I feel afterwards. I highly recommend that you add this DVD to your collection.",1206835200,,457,4.159090909090909

If you take the time to study the poses--perhaps just watch the DVD the first time through--I think this could be excellent beginner material.  Just keep in mind that you get to the final poses through practice, and you can take intermediate positions if you are not sufficiently flexible at first.

That being said, I imagine that this routine would get pretty old after the first three times.  However, $3.33 per yoga class is not a bad way to get a good grounding in the essentials, and you can always move on from there.",1206576000,,640,4.398305084745763
3199261,3,B000WC38B4,"I am someone who has done some Yoga postures on and off over the years, but never in a sustained, intensive way.  I am also quite familiar with most Eastern spiritual and health techniques, having done a lot of meditation and some Tai Chi and Chi Gong as well.

I found this DVD to be quite well produced and the workout well structured.  However, everything is done to conform to standard New Age style and expectations.  The logos and intro look like every other similar DVD, and the music is straight out of every New Age massage session.  In other words, never annoying, but also quite conventional.

Overall, the Yoga program itself is suited for someone who has been to at least one or two Yoga classes at the local park or school.  Not only is there no preliminary explanation of what we are doing and why, but also no general explanation of Yoga concepts and how postures fit into that.

So, if you have done a few Yoga classes, know what it is about, and simply want a good Yoga program for home practice, this is fine, but if you are wondering ""What is this Yoga thing people are doing?"", then this is not the right DVD for you.",1206057600,3,1138,4.385714285714286
3199262,5,B000WC38B4,"I had never before done Yoga in my life and this was a very good introduction.  The first 20 minutes is all about stance and breathing and slowly it progresses into some mildly hard terriritory.

I highly recommend this DVD for something who is brand new to the world of Yoga and wants an easy introduction.  But it does stay very easy and you will definately outgrow it within about a month.

Obviously, this is for beginningers, and not anyone who has some basic yoga knowledge.",1205971200,,480,4.546511627906977
3199263,3,B000WC38B4,"Having had prior Yoga experience, I really enjoyed this DVD, the setting is beautiful, extremely relaxing, the instructor a very calming voice but it's really a shame that she chose to title this Yoga for Beginners. Ive done yoga in a studio and own a few other Yoga DVD's that I really enjoy so I already know the poses and know what to expect and my other DVD's have instructors that cater to all levels; one DVD I own has three instructor each dressed in a different color and they tell you at the beginning that the instructor in blue is for a beginner and red is for an intermediate and green for the expert so you can watch the person who's level you are at and as you have more experience you don't need to run out and buy another DVD, you just watch the instructor on the next level. Another video I own gives you suggested modifications depending on your level and flexibility. Yoga for Beginners does none of these things. So, what I meant when I said it was a shame that this DVD was not properly titled is that it is a great DVD for someone who already has experience doing yoga NOT the beginner and I feel that a lot of people who have no experience with yoga are going to be unhappy with their purchase. What I love about yoga is it's the type of discipline where you should always go at your own pace but that being said what is lacking on this DVD is suggested ways to modify a pose to meet a physical limitation or just getting the basic poses down you. So, I think that an absolute beginner is going to get pretty frustrated pretty quickly and most likely never pick it up again. The title is very misleading, I would not recommend this for a true beginner.",1205971200,9,1675,4.270440251572327
3199264,4,B000WC38B4,"Although the instructor professes to have practiced and taught Yoga for years, it doesn't necessarily apply to be able to TEACH the beginner, and here the instruction is geared to the absolute beginner.

Lengthy for the beginner
What causes a problem here is that the session is rather lengthy for the beginner.  There needs to be levels to work up to if it is to be called a beginner's session.  How do you keep up... skip this....try this....?  Do a minute of this, that,  skip......too hard here, etc., etc.  It becomes too difficult to keep up with if you are truly a beginner,  stiff and not able to stretch.

Not sufficient instruction
I have done some Yoga through a few videotapes, and I have compared beginner's instruction and noted that this is void of sufficient instruction for the beginner it targets.

Poses
You may have difficulty getting to keep up with these poses, don't be discouraged and what may happen is when you can't keep up, you give up!

Beautiful Scenery
Yes, the scenery is beautiful!!  Music is soothing.  If you are very new to Yoga, and not young and flexible, this will be difficult.....Rizzo",1205884800,3,1126,4.717948717948718
3199265,5,B000WC38B4,"There are countless options for products geared towards Yoga for beginners, but this is the first DVD I watched that has all the elements that I think should be present in a product like this. In many other cases, I have found that the asanas are too elementary, and after a month of following the lessons you are ready to move to something else. This DVD has a very nice flow, starting with a few minutes of breathing exercises and then moving on to your typical Yoga 101 asanas, setting up the next step. The pace starts to increase a little and there are some slightly more difficult poses, transforming this into a yoga flow practice, with poses that will challenge you for a while.

For the absolute beginner, there is a very brief intro before the practice starts, mentioning the benefits of Yoga and the way in which it should be practiced. The only fault I found is that there is no mention to the fact that you should not eat in the couple of hours before a session (unless it is a very light snack). And then, there is the setting! The spirituality of yoga is partly lost when you get a DVD with people practicing in a bland studio. In this case the beautiful scenery definitely helps with the mood. As does the fact that instead of talking and demonstrating the poses simultaneously, the instructor is just focusing on the practice and we get her voice-over with the commentary.

The advice on how to do the postures right is clear and to the point, and even though some beginners may be challenged as the DVD progresses, I think that in a couple of weeks you should be able to follow the flow of the lesson with no major problems. This is an excellent choice to get into yoga, especially if you are looking to increase your overall well-being, as well as your tone and flexibility.

I would prefer something a bit more advanced on a regular basis but this will do for my at-home, in-a-pinch yoga workout!",1204502400,,385,4.12
3199268,4,B000WC38B4,"I'm still not up to snuff on yoga, but I have been taking classes locally.  In our classes, we use bricks and straps to help with our poses, for those of us not limber enough to do them without.  Unfortunately this DVD doesn't even make the suggestion to use props; the woman performing does all the poses without props.  If you needed, but didn't know already how, to add the props to a routine, this DVD would probably dissuade you from doing yoga.

The scenery is good and the instructor doesn't change poses too quickly.  Since I do have my props I'm able to adjust the poses accordingly and thus this is a perfectly acceptable DVD (although not as good as a real class).

3199320,4,B000WC38B4,"In ""Yoga for Beginners,"" a 50 minute DVD , Elena Brower takes one though the paces of a beginner workout in a relaxed and casual setting.

Her approach is in a true yoga fashion: low-keyed with full explanations of how one gets into the various yoga positions; explanations of what one should feel at first and what one will eventually feel in each position; and, the right-way, and wrong-way, one can do a position.

For almost a year I have been attending a twice-a-week Pilates class that is supplemented with yoga.  It is taught by four instructors, all who have a similar, yet, sometimes unique, approach to their class.  All are excellent.

With Ms. Brower's DVD, I found the consistent approach that comes with the use of a DVD comforting and predictable, especially for a beginner.

Ms. Brower does a great job in developing the beginning yoga disciple.  I found the DVD approach is MUST because without it, I tend to get off-track and do what I find enjoyable, instead of doing everything as it was intended.

I would recommend this DVD to anyone considering yoga.  It is excellent!  If you find yoga fits your bill, I would suggest that you get a book that shows the positions.  That way you can look at them at your leisure to make sure you are doing them correctly.

As with my Pilates class, Ms. Brower stresses that you should not over extend yourself, or do anything that you feel is hurting your body.

BTW, I mentioned about the benefits of yoga.  For years, I had some lower back aches that erupted into a serious problem for me this past year.  After going to the orthopedic surgeon several times and getting mixed results, I began doing Pilates because I had heard of its benefit for the back muscles. Within a month, I began to notice that my problem was less after my Pilates, and yoga, sessions.  My doctor told me that most lower back pain comes from not stretching out the hamstring muscles.  Knock on wood, it's been almost two months since I've had those pains.  While my situation may have been unique to me, in hindsight, I would recommend to anyone in their 20's and 30's to learn some yoga or Pilates and how to stretch their muscles.  Don't wait until you are in your 40's or 50's and you have to learn to live with pain.",1203552000,3,2253,4.518518518518518
3199321,4,B000WC38B4,"For those who are just starting, restarting or easing into yoga, this is a terrific DVD intro.

3199322,4,B000WC38B4,"This is a beautifully filmed, high quality DVD, with a gorgeous setting, a skilled model, and a calming voice walking you through the breathing/movements.

As pretty much a total beginner, I found this DVD a bit long.  Also, the instructor gives very specific directions regarding breathing and positioning, and I dearly wanted feedback about whether I was actually doing what I was supposed to.

The pacing also seemed slow to me.  Granted, I may be a bit ADD, but 45 minutes is more than I can spare for a regular exercise routine at this point in my life.

I guess it depends on what you want from a yoga DVD.  This particular DVD seems like a very serious introduction to learning and practicing yoga, as opposed to a yoga DVD that might less orthodox.  My favorite yoga DVD is Stress Relief Yoga, which keeps my attention by moving at a rapid pace (20 minutes), and completely relaxes me.  I have fallen asleep on the floor after doing that DVD!!  That DVD, however, has many reviews criticizing it for moving too quickly and not holding poses long enough.

So I'd recommend this DVD for anyone who has a yoga instructor and wants to work on poses and stretches at home, for anyone who wants to undertake a serious study of yoga (but then I'd recommend an instructor!), or for anyone who wants a 45 minute yoga regime and is confident they understand positioning and breathing.",1203552000,,1382,4.627049180327869

I was thinking as I was looking at the lowest star reviews (I always read the lowest ones first) and thinking that in this case some people might have mistaken Beginning Yoga for Yoga for the Not Yet Fit.  While Ms Brower addresses the possibility that a viewer may not be in condition to perform some of the poses, she does assume a minimum amount of flexibility and strength in the student.

The production values on this DVD are very good.  The background is serene and beautiful and Ms. Brower's voice is pleasantly calm.  In fact, I have to admit that the first time I veiwed this I fell asleep-- but it was at the end of a very tiring, stressful week.  Since then I have found that this can provide a pleasant interlude when life and/or work are too demanding.  I'm not particularly concerned about the spiritual side of Yoga so there are benefits for those who want to participate on every level.",1203552000,,979,4.441340782122905
3199324,5,B000WC38B4,"This DVD has quite a good introduction to what is usually known as Yoga. The mind and body elements are very well represented in the description of the moves, as well as the narrative of the DVD ""Class"".The audio and visual elements that supplement the class are well crafted. Staying with the voice of the teacher was a good move, since
she has a very good tone of voice, key in the teaching of any of the schools, as well as being superbly photogenic.

I have done a variety of classes since the 1970s ( as a student), and the traditionalist schools are rarely as accessible as depicted in this DVD. Most of the teaching of YOGA ( YUKTA) can either aim for physical union with God ( not simply healthy responses) or good relaxation techniques that allow one to follow certain paths to access God.

Whilst the state aim of ""Build Strength,Increase flexibility, calm your mind and revitalise your body"" is a necessary by-product of most advanced teaching in YOGA, the basic forms in the original Sanskrit are very difficult. What we have here is a very westernised form of the Traditional Yoga. As several of my teachers taught me, you get
from the class what you take to it: if you want this to be a starting point it can be. You can try easing gently into some of the moves, but if it is too much for you, then freeze the DVD frame, and see how you can modify the move so that you still keep the ""beat"" but also keep the ability to develop. Its a very good Disc... if you can't do
any of the moves, I can definitely recommend it as a meditation guide; what you do is see your ""inner self""  doing the moves... you might be surprised just how fulfilling this can be.",1203465600,2,1666,4.35048231511254
3199325,4,B000WC38B4,"This is a beautiful DVD, the setting is stunning, the music and narration are balanced well so neither overwhelms the other.  For the most part the camera manages to capture the various poses well enough for a beginning student to follow.

The instruction beginnings slowly with a series of breathing excercises, moving on through standing and then stretching poses closing with more breathing/relaxation.  The poses didn't seem too complicated when I was just watching but when I tried to follow along my perception changed.  I have no experience with yoga, which makes me a true beginner.  I lasted just over ten minutes the first time through which lead me to my first problem.  Should I pause the dvd, rest and then resume?, stop and try to get further the next time? skip to the final section?  There really was very little support for the true beginner which leads me to think that this DVD would be better suited to someone who has had at least some yoga instruction before attempting this.

The instructor did mention modifying some poses, particularly towards the end of the session but some of these instructions were only mentioned, not demonstrated.  For example the instructor stated that it was very important to flex the foot while executing one pose but did not explain exactly what she meant by that direction.  It would have been helpful if there had been a close-up of her foot at that point so the student could have seen what was meant.

Overall though this is a good excercise DVD, one that has introduced at least this couch potato to a new way to excercise despite inclement weather or a busy schedule.",1203465600,2,1626,4.771428571428571
3199326,5,B000WC38B4,"This is the very first time I have ever tried yoga. My doctor suggested yoga as a good way to reduce my stress and improve my health. Just to let you know upfront, I'm pretty out of shape and I haven't exercised regularly for months so I was not able to do a lot of the positions right away. I know it will take some practice and improvement on my part before I can. I like that the instructor reaffirmed several times that it is ok to go at your own pace.

I was impressed with the quality of this production and I felt it soothing just to watch the instructor perform in the beautiful seaside location. The scenery was beautiful, the background music was calming and unobtrusive, and the instructor was knowledgeable and easy to follow. So many exercise video instructors get carried away with trying to be dynamic on camera that they come across as phony. This was not the case on the DVD. I found Elena Brower to be calming and genuine in her approach.

I also liked that there were not extra pieces needed for this workout. She did suggest to use a yoga mat if you had one but it wasn't a requirement. All you need is the DVD and your very own self.

After reading other reviews, I was aware that the poses were not as easy as they looked.  So it came as no surprise that the routine was difficult for me.  What was surprising was the calm I felt after stumbling my way through it.  As a rank beginner, I had no idea of the inner peace and satisfaction that would be mine.

I'll keep after it, and I am certain that in my own time I'll get there, physically as well as mentally and spiritually.

3199329,4,B000WC38B4,"What is nicely beginner-y about this video is that, although she's obviously a pro, the teacher doesn't show off and doesn't make us feel hopelessly inadequate. Whereas many yoga videos show a teacher bending like a rubber pretzel, this one doesn't. She'll say ""reach to the floor, or your shins"" and instead of slapping her hands all the way down on the floor, which would hurt most of us and make us want to give up, she touches her shins. Hey--I can do that too. She tells you to move in a certain way, ""possibly coming down on to your elbows and, someday, even your forehead."" Someday is good.
Nice videography: she's outdoors, on a small platform surrounded by green grass and flowers, with a bright blue-sky and water in the distance. It's a nice balance of open and contained (not austere). Better used in the daytime; using this video at night feels out of whack, because it's such a sunny daytime on the set.
The narration is done by voiceover (i.e. she's not talking while she's practicing yoga). The presentation is basic, not overly platitudinous. Her voice is smooth and grounded, though first-timers might find she moves a bit quickly (just a bit). After five minutes I reverted to just watching it all the way through once without playing along. (Anyway it's a little hard to do downward dog and watch a video at the same time. Watch it once first and you won't need to look at the screen as often.)
A true beginner is not going to be able to do everything the teacher does and make it look like she does. If you aren't already doing some stretching exercise, this will quickly make you realize how inflexible you are.
The whole video, especially its first half, is heavy on downward dog and related poses. Occasionally she'll refer to ""downward-facing dog"" or ""warrior 1"" or other poses without explaining those terms, but if you're watching you'll understand. Actually it's nice not to have to hear a dictionary lecture. This is all action; the talk is secondary.
The whole is five chapters but if you just ""Play"" you get one unbroken stream of video, with no indication of where any ""chapters"" are. Choosing a chapter from the main menu just transports you to a certain spot in the video.
The 50 minutes goes by fairly quickly. There's a 5- or 10-minute warm-down at the end.
No props are used except a yoga mat. No people appear in the video except the teacher.",1203120000,8,2380,4.615566037735849

I was surprised by how challenging it was! I had thought yoga was basically just stretching, but it's amazing how much of a workout I got. Many of the poses require you to work hard on your balance, which gives you a great core workout. Being a newbie, I have a long way to go and I think this video will last me for a while.

Brower starts the workout off slow, with breathing exercises and gentle seated twists.  After that, she picks up the pace, with a series of sun salutations, standing poses, hip openers, and backbends.  As a result, a true beginner to yoga may have to view the workout a few times to understand the names and forms of the various poses.  Brower does not go into detail on positioning, but the workout has been filmed well and gives good visual cues.  The overall workout is fairly brief but provides a good introductory survey of many classic yoga poses. Brower doesn't stint on time in a given position, so some of the poses will feel intense to a beginner.  Viewers who are more experienced in yoga may find the routine a pleasant one to use on low-key days.  I liked the balance between flow from pose to pose and time in each pose as well as the emphasis on the breath.  These elements may make the routine challenging for some beginners, but they result in a program that feels more true to the goals of yoga than many other beginner routines.",1202947200,,1309,4.616379310344827

As a practitioner of Bickram yoga, I found this to be a more soothing and less intense alternative.  Elena's soothing voice guides you through a very complete workout and with her perfect posing in a lush environment, it is a pleasure and inspiration to watch and workout to.

Other reviewers have done a good job dissecting the disc so I won't go there.  Let me simply state that this is a yoga DVD that I will open revisit when I want to have a less taxing yoga session than what Bickram's routine offers.  Even my kids mimic the poses while I work out so it is enjoyable for the whole family.

Recommended. A more intense DVD to compliment this one is Rodney Yee's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Power-Yoga-Total-Body-Workout/dp/B0000A2ZQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Power Yoga - Total Body Workout</a>.",1202774400,10,1535,5.639130434782609
3199367,3,B000WC38B4,"For a while now, a friend has been urging me to consider practicing yoga.  With that in mind, I've been looking into various books and videos, and finding them generally either too physically demanding or too involved in the spiritual side of yoga practice.  I'm sorry to say that ""Yoga for Beginners"" is no exception, in spite of the name.  In fact it might be more properly titled ""Yoga for Beginners Who are Otherwise Quite Strong and Flexible.""

In an approximately 50 minute workout, Elena Brower demonstrates a beautiful, flowing workout which looks like it must feel wonderful, if you can manage to follow it.  Unfortunately I have neither the strength nor the flexibility to do so.  I'm guessing that most of my friends don't either, so it does seem to me that it might be a good idea to offer hints for modifications of the poses to suit older, heavier or simply out-of-shape students.  But Brower offers very little in the way of such modifications.  I'd guess that about two-thirds of the workout is simply not do-able for me without substantial modification.

At the same time, the poses themselves look quite wonderful, and if you've ever done stretching and/or deep breathing exercises, the pleasure of these poses will be almost palpable to you.  Brower's voice is calming.  She doesn't rush you through the poses, but at the same time she doesn't spend a lot of time explaining them.  Because the practice is slow and deliberate, this isn't as big a problem as it might be during an aerobics video, but as a beginner, I'd have appreciated a bit more information.

Right at the beginning, Brower suggests that the deep breathing is far more important than a deep pose.  I think it would be helpful if she reiterated that during the actual workout.

Over all, it's a pretty, calming video as long as you don't allow yourself to get too torqued if you can't do the moves, or you fall out of them frequently.  If you can make the necessary modifications for your own fitness level, you may well get something out of this video.  Otherwise, keep looking for a good beginning yoga workout.  There must be one out there.",1202688000,32,2129,4.708108108108108
3199368,5,B000WC38B4,"This is a wonderful yoga DVD, but not really for beginners.  Much better suited to those who have studied for awhile with a qualified teacher and want to practice on their own.  The instructions are clear, especially about breathing during the practice, and the ambiance is warm and inviting.  It exemplifies the spirit of Anusara Yoga as a unified and heart-opening practice.  Well sequenced and paced.  Enjoy!",1202515200,,411,5.074626865671642
3199369,3,B000WC38B4,"That's the question this DVD back cover should have answered.  I wish I had known there was one for 'absolute' beginners.  I was looking for something to teach me the poses, but this one asks that you already know them, and she doesn't hold them and then coax you into correct stance, but just keeps moving.  You better know some yoga before doing this.  My search for the perfect beginning DVD is still on. Or - I should just take a class...",1201824000,4,442,4.353658536585366

8222207,3,B000WC38B4,"I haven't actually done this one yet, but beginners beware! It is not what I would call for ""beginners."" It was WAY harder than Alanna Zabel's Beginner Level Yoga. The instructor doesn't give you alternative moves if you're not ready to do what she's doing, and she doesn't walk you through how to get into the poses in a clear and easy to follow/understand way. It's just not what I was looking for. If you have never practiced yoga, and know little to nothing about it I wouldn't get this one. If you are brand new to yoga, I'd recommend the DVD I mentioned earlier (Element: Beginner Level Yoga with Alanna Zabel). It has 2 yoga programs: one that is a foundations program that takes you through the most common and popular poses, and one that is called ""Slow Flow"" that adds some poses that she went through in the foundations program and others that flow together, offering a little more of a ""workout."" There's also a 10 minute intro to meditation that is good too.
If you are more familiar with yoga and have taken classes before (or found your own DVD that introduced you to yoga), then this will be good for you. I decided to keep it for when I'm ready to move on from the Alanna Zabel DVD.",1484870400,4,1199,4.405405405405405

I'm not yet in shape and stiff. I'm doing them slight as my body lets me in.  I use to be really into yoga when I was younger. This is a good start! I also like the dvd by Erick Shiffman and Alley Mcgraw. I think that one's by Warner Brothers. This dvd is up there with that one. Now I have two to chose from:)))
