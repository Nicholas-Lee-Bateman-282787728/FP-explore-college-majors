8627194,5,B0042WVENY,"Season of the Bear - Vol. 3  True Bear Stories  by Kate Marshall Graphics, Inc.

Entertaining and enlightening stories as told by people who've been fortunate enough to have the opportunity to deal with black bears on a first hand basis. Their experiences with bears over the years show how intelligent, resourceful, compassionate and resilient these wild creatures can be! It also demonstrates the amazing lengths people will go to help bears in difficult situations.
As I watched these experts share their stories I kept hoping that there would be yet another and another endearing tale to hear... all of them were interesting and informative. Several of my very favorite ""True Bear Stories"" are: The Bridge Bear, The Bottle Bear, Ivy, The Bear in the Sea, Miracle Bear and The Wayward Cub.

In their traditional style, Kate Marshall Graphics has again captured hours of outstanding close up bear videography winning them well deserved awards. I highly recommend all three volumes of Season of the Bear.  Ann F. Carter - Marquette. MI",1343174400,,1036,5.035087719298246
