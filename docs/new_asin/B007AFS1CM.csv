5071928,4,B007AFS1CM,"""You got a choice to make. You can finish this job and go to jail and your kid will get the best care any kid could have, or you cannot finish this job, you still go to jail and your kid will die. What are you gonna do?"" Scott Kane (Fuller) is a reformed criminal who is trying to live his life straight for once. After his seven year old son has a heart attack and Kane has no way to pay for the transplant on his own he decides to do one last job. After being double crossed he risks everything to save his son. Based on the preview I honestly expected this to be OK but a type of made for TV movie. While it did have the feel of a glorified made for TV movie this was very, very good. I loved ""John Q"" and I would call this one a more intense action version of that movie. Unlike most low-budget action movies this one really sucks you in and makes you root for the ""bad guy"". Being a father I can see where Kane is coming from and found myself really pulling for him throughout. Overall, not quite as good as ""John Q."" but this came as close as you can. I give it an A-.",1334102400,,1074,3.8863636363636362

8513359,4,B007AFS1CM,"Much better than I thought it was going to be. When I read what the story was about, I thought, AGAIN! We have seen this so many times. I think what I liked so much about this was Drew Fuller's  performance. He was at times maddening, riveting, sincere, loving....he got it all down well. there were some surprises here and there which was good for me. I think the support cast made that possible too. Ethan Embry, sinister, William Devane, funny but dogmatic, William Atherton, he does the dirtbag so well. But the star here is Drew Fuller and his talent, I just wonder weh he will be recognized for it.",1442188800,,604,4.441441441441442

8513361,5,B007AFS1CM,"This movie made me angry. It made me angry because there's so much dark truth in it about America's health care system. Indeed, I think the premise of this movie is an indictment of our health care system, a system that would allow a 6-year-old boy to die because his family can't pay for his treatment. Out health care system is nothing but a g.d.' business. No money, no TV. No money, no car. No money, no medical treatment. Scott Kane would not have had to resort to such drastic measures if we took care of our own in this country.

But, if we had a decent health care system this movie would not have been made. The plot was superb, and the directing inspired. The actors were splendid. Even the cinematography was excellent. This is a great flick and should have had a wider audience.",1427241600,,790,4.410958904109589

Remember John Q? You know a desperate father (Denzel Washington) takes hospital staff hostage when his HMO'refuses to pay for his son's life changing surgery.
Well, this is that type of story, except the father is a reformed hit man.
Scott Kane (Drew Fuller) made a promise to his fiancee Anna (Whitney Able) that if she would marry him he would leave his checkered past behind. She said yes. He left everything behind. The two had a son, who is now seven, and been diagnosed, after a heart attack, with having to have a transplant. They are barely getting by and have no insurance.
Out of options Scott goes to his old boss, Daniel Morgan (William Atherton), who says he'll take care of all the boy's expenses if Scott will kill an adversary. Scott agrees. Anna says she'll leave him if he goes through with it, but eventually caves in.
Of course, Morgan doublecrosses Scott and he winds up in prison. Morgan has the local sheriff, Jace Olsen (Ethan Embry) on the payroll and has him put a hit out on Scott from the inside.
FBI agent James Thompson (William Devane) wants Scott to turn evidence so they can convict Morgan, but our anti-hero has other plans.
He manages to escape with plans to save his son and kill his foes. A tough order when the real police, FBI, crooked sheriff and mob all want you.
This is one of the best sleeper movies out there.",1336521600,,1411,4.533333333333333
8513366,3,B007AFS1CM,"A crisis causes a man with a shadowy past to return to a life of crime, in The Kane Files (2010) an overdramatic tale of crime written and directed by Benjamin Gourley (Moving McAllister).  Mild spoilers follow.

Ex-soldier Scott Kane (Drew Fuller) discovers that his son needs a heart transplant.  With no money and no insurance, Kane turns to loan shark Daniel Morgan (William Atherton), who promises to take care of the situation if Kane will murder someone for him.  Kane's wife Anna (Whitney Able,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monsters/dp/B004BZ5AN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monsters</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-the-Boys-Love-Mandy-Lane/dp/B001563I5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All the Boys Love Mandy Lane</a>) is concerned about his return to the dark side, but there seems to be no other options.  Kane is double crossed by Morgan, and ends up in prison, but manages to breakout in the most unlikely manner, with Sherriff Jace Olsen (Ethan Embry) and FBI man James Thompson (William Devane) both on his tail.

Loaded with clichs, and with some murky subplots, The Kane Files isn't at all believable, but it is mildly entertaining.  Told in nonlinear fashion, it takes a while for the story to unfold and the gunfire erupts.  Devane and Atherton are a good fit playing stock characters, and Whitney Able is also good in her limited screen time.  The dialog isn't a strong point, but Drew Fuller (Army Wives) does a pretty decent job of acting, and handling the action scenes.  Shot in Utah, The Kane Files plays out like the pilot for a series which apparently didn't happen.  It's worth a watch if you see it on Lifetime's schedule, where it has just premiered.",1336262400,,1767,5.630188679245283
