1255752,4,B00002ND7Y,"I just obtained Live in Concert-Natalie Merchant on DVD and it is a great showcase for Natalie. It truly captures the feel of her live show, which you must attend for real if you get the chance.  The reason I didn't give  it 5 stars was for the fact that there is nothing extra on the DVD, which I  found rather disappointing. It is a shame when this wonderful media is not  used to it fullest potential.  The only benefit is that you are able to  skip the fan interviews and go right to the concert. This title would be  just fine purchased on VHS.",943747200,4,549,4.171428571428572
1255753,1,B00002ND7Y,"The video and audio quality of this production was very poor compared to other DVD music videos I've seen. It seemed like a poor VHS production rather than DVD! A great talent deserves a better quality production than  this.  Also, extra footage was very disappointing. Pre and post concert  interviews were fan comments outside of the concert hall and a brief video  of Natalie signing autographs. No in depth interview with Natalie Merchant  or other interesting back stage video. Other DVD Music Concerts I've seen  offer much more.",943660800,5,535,5.0227272727272725
1255754,5,B00002ND7Y,"I love it, I think that it is the best any one could possibly hope for. I love the songs SHE CHOSE.  I love HER CHOICE to sing an extended version of These Are Days.  She is beautiful and strong-minded and strong-willed. I am  very glad she has a video out of the songs that she obviously felt needed  exposure on video. Having seen her in concert increased the experience, I'm  sure, but I know that I will forever be happy with what SHE CHOOSES to give  to us as her fans.  She has nothing but us in mind.  p.s. Oh, yes, and  I hardly think pointing out the un/atractiveness of others is an  appropriate way to rate the video.  ;)",943056000,5,632,4.140495867768595
1255755,4,B00002ND7Y,"This video will please diehard Natalie Merchant fans, but probably won't win her any new converts. The video was shot during Natalie's series of shows on Broadway last June and contains a mix of originals and covers.  Highlights include Natalie's beautiful performance of Katell Keineg's  ""The Gulf of Araby,"" as well as a spontaneous rendition of  ""Senor Don Gato,"" which perfectly captures the spirit of a  Natalie Merchant concert. The video also includes a cover of David Bowie's  ""Space Oddity,"" along with an extended version of the 10,000  Maniacs hit ""These Are Days,"" plus several songs from her  Tigerlily album. The biggest disappointment is the omission of some of  Natalie's most outstanding songs, such as ""My Skin"" and  ""Seven Years."" Maybe we'll have to wait for Natalie Merchant Live  in Concert--Volume 2.",942364800,7,823,5.166666666666667
1255756,2,B00002ND7Y,"I was a a very big fan of 10,000 Maniacs when Natalie was the lead singer and because of that I purchased Natalie's debut solo lp.  It was very good.  ""Ophelia"" IMO was not as good.  Too many slow and dreary songs.  I found many of the songs on the DVD boring and it wasn't helped by the sub-par audio recording.  I never liked the song ""Ophelia"" and found it to be a poor choice for the opening song.  Her version of ""Wonder"" was, you guessed it, boring.  There were definitely better songs she could have included, live, such as ""Life is Sweet"" instead of a partial recording of it.  Also, what about the single ""Kind and Generous"".  The CD of the concert with different song selections was much better and not boring.  I probably am more of a fan of 10,000 Maniacs than Natalie's solo CD's.  The so-called documentary (if you can call it that) was mis-leading as it was less than 5 minutes and not really a documentary.",1010275200,4,922,4.364705882352941
1255757,5,B00002ND7Y,"I am an even BIGGER fan after seeing this DVD.  I want to go see her in concert right NOW!  I've only seen one of her shows years ago but I couldn't hear her and I don't think she put on this much of a production back then.  She is AWESOME!  Her effortless singing, kooky/funlovin' dancing, and lovable personality will make anyone sit up and want to sing/dance along.  I am definitely glad I bought this because I rarely get to see her shows.  A must have for fans!  Great filming!",1008201600,,482,4.230769230769231
1255758,5,B00002ND7Y,"Natalie has always had a spectacular voice, but it has gotten even better over the years.  She has amazing talent.  She writes many of her songs, and plays the piano.  She has a wonderful personality and she's really funny.  You will be mezmerized by her voice.  I highly recommend this DVD (it also comes in video)and I also recommend really anything by Natalie.  You will not be dissapointed.  But, her live performances are extra special.",1002153600,2,441,4.8
1255759,5,B00002ND7Y,"I purchased this DVD about eight months ago, shortly after I bought my first DVD player....and I must say it has more than passed the test of time. I have been a Natalie fan since back in the 10,000 Maniacs days and all I can say about this DVD is WOW! Granted the ""special features"" aren't all that special...but the FEELING of actually being at this concert is a joy. For all the true fans...This DVD was recorded on June 12th 1999; this was one day before her CD of the same title was recorded. That alone is pretty cool. The people that have complained about the ""quality"" of the lighting and such on this DVD are NOT taking into account that this was filmed at a LIVE concert! Go watch Pink Ployd's Pulse, and lets see you make the same complaint. This is totally worth the money for the great visuals and audio of Natalie Merchant's wonderfull abilities in a wonderfull setting. Can you say ""live in a hall on DVD""? Have Fun!",996105600,,931,4.35632183908046
1255760,1,B00002ND7Y,"While I do enjoy Natalie Merchant's music, I was extremely disappointed with the concert on DVD.  Video quality was marginal and the audio mixing was terrible.  Some instruments are barely audible while others are grossly overpowering (as is her vocals in several occasions).  The lack of traditional ""additional material"" on DVDs is also glaring.  This one pales in comparison to any concert on DVD or VHS.",992908800,7,407,5.121212121212121
1255761,5,B00002ND7Y,"I was amazed when I popped the Natalie Merchant DVD into my player.  Since I have never seen Natalie live, I now know why people rave about her performances.  Natalie's voice is beautiful, warm and expressive and her lyrics seep right into your soul.  Natalie goofs around with the audience, revealing that she is a down-to-earth and sweet woman.  Any Natalie Merchant fan would love this!",970012800,3,389,4.848484848484849
1255762,5,B00002ND7Y,"I was NOT a Natalie Merchant fan since 10,000 Maniacs, BUT she is awesome now! The DVD was solid with great recording and video with an entertaining preview and behind the scenes footage. I liked it so much and impressed by her voice and concert footage, I went and purchased Tiger Lily and Ophelia on CD.  The sound quality of the recording made me feel like I was really  there. Great job and a must buy and guide for other groups to follow in  bringing their concerts to DVD...",957225600,,480,4.370786516853933
1255763,4,B00002ND7Y,"I cannot understand the reviewer who said that she was a prude and was rude to the audience. Maybe that person didn't realize she was joking. The audience certainly understood it. That's why they are laughing.
OK. Off  my soapbox.
It's great to watch Natalie live. The expressiveness she has  with her voice is accentuated by seeing her perform. She's a singer who can  make you really feel the emotion of what she's communicating. My only  complaint was mentioned by previous reviewers, and that is that it was  short. In her defence though, some of the song choices were different than  the CD. So together, you get a fuller idea of what the show is like.",950227200,,657,4.620689655172414
1255764,3,B00002ND7Y,"I like the fact that I can jump from song to song instantly that the DVD allows. I also like the fact that it is in 5.1 audio. Although only very limited times could you tell. The main thing is I wish it was longer. It's  just over an hour long. I also was disapointed they didn't have more DVD  exclusives with it. They could have really given us something good, however  they chose not to. I hope they make Time Capsul in DVD with 5.1. That would  be a must! All in all though, I believe it is an okay disc. After all it's  just a few dollars more then the CD and you do get the video.",948844800,,587,3.899159663865546
1255765,2,B00002ND7Y,"Natalie could have been a little more nicer to the audience instead of being a prude like she always was. You hardly could hear her voice, she looks like a farmer girl in These are days and really she doesn't show a  sense of appreciation to anyone. Her band is too loud....
Not a great  video, especially to a die-hard Merchant fan.",946425600,2,333,4.354838709677419

7916032,5,B00002ND7Y,Wonderful concert which I attended two of her four shows at the Neil Simon Theater in NYC!,1448150400,,90,4.352941176470588

7916034,5,B00002ND7Y,"This concert DVD is no longer being manufactured (out of print, as it were), and that is a terrible shame. This video captures Natalie Merchant at what I consider to be her prime. Filmed in a broadway theatre in NYC, the concert is wonderfully shot. No silly effects or odd camera angles - just a great edit of a nicely filmed and beautifully performed show.

This film captures Ms. Merchant in great voice, with the full catalog of her best work at her disposal. Her personality onstage comes shining through as well. She is very interactive with her audience and her sincerity as a person and performer is evident. Today's self-proclaimed ""divas"" should watch this concert film to get an idea what genuine talent looks and sounds like.

This needs to be re-issued! Perhaps on Blu-ray with some additional footage, etc.",1285632000,3,820,4.808510638297872
7916035,4,B00002ND7Y,"Natalie is unique.  She's wonderful, extremely feminine, utterly poised, completely natural, brilliant, with a rare and beautiful voice.  Her lyrics shine as gems of insight.  She's a treasure to be near.

The pre-show interviews on this dvd show her to be more popular with women than she is with men.  What I think is going on is that her fans adore her without aching to go to bed with her.  Her appeal isn't sex appeal, as it is with almost every other lead singer or actor.  She's not as cheap as that.  She's not like that idiot Brittany Spears dressing like a whore.

In fact, Natalie is covered up almost as much as an Arab.  You can see her face, and her lower legs, but not a whole lot else.  She's just fine that way.  She sways and dances, she smiles and shares her wonderful personality, and you really don't need to see her cleavage.  There's no way in hell you're getting a peak at that.

Think about the lyrics of most popular songs.  They are usually about either sex or an insincere phony version of moon-june boy-band romance for pre-teens.  Natalie is one antidote to that garbage.  But she is awfully sweet medicine.

She's smart and completely without ego on stage.  She's deep too.  For those of you knowledgeable about astrology, she's a Scorpio, like Neil Young.  There's another brilliant songwriter who doesn't play ""star"" onstage, doesn't play celebrity, doesn't show ego.

Natalie's band on this dvd is very good, as she herself comments late in the show.

I was happy to hear her sing Beloved Wife, one of my favorite of her songs.  Who else but Natalie would write a song about an elderly couple's love for each other, the aged husband wondering if he should commit suicide to be with the beloved wife he has just lost to illness.  The lyrics of this song are priceless, and always reminded me of my own parents, when my mom was suffering with illness and my father was the caregiver.

Who else could have written that song?  The only people I could think of are Simon and Garfunkel, for their song Old Friends.  So you can see what level Natalie is on.  She's writing with the intelligence and sensitivity of Simon and Garfunkel.  There aren't too many on that high level.

I'm glad Natalie is in our artistic world.  With so much unoriginal garbage around, we're lucky to have her.",1137801600,4,2314,4.568292682926829
7916036,5,B00002ND7Y,This one is great!  Personal stories about song writing and wonderful performances.  Many extras and music only too just for listening pleasure.  Highly recommend!,1128816000,,163,5.708333333333333
7916037,4,B00002ND7Y,"1) The concert clocks in at only 60 minutes. Why were so many songs cut? This is a DVD! Give us at least 90 minutes worth of material.

2) It claims to also contain a documentary. It doesn't. It has a few minutes of clips of fans. That isn't a documentary.

Other than the above it is great. It should be like a $9.99 DVD given its insufficiant usage of the space provided.",1095897600,19,373,4.095890410958904
7916038,5,B00002ND7Y,"Natalie is a happy, joyful person beaming with life and energy as she entertains her crowd. The painful and annoying slow motions shots of her dancing and spinning can be easily overlooked by these truely awesome performances, a brilliant and beautiful performer with and amazing voice. A great show! I can't wait to actually see her live now.",1055808000,8,343,4.931034482758621
7916039,5,B00002ND7Y,"Natalie's music as a solo artist has always been a thought provoking look to human condition.  Most of the times it is presented in a very haunting and gloomy perspective but it is meant to be that way so that we could relate to her how she feels about certain things.
In this concert, she was able to perfectly deliver to her audience all the emotions her songs contain.  I must warn you though, most of it are not in a light mood.
My favorite is her cover of Katell Keineg's ""Gulf of Araby"", I cried when I first heard it as it is a very powerful performance and the message it says is so real especially of the current state of the world.  The song, as a piece of poetry, is already an amazing material but together with the music, it is just devastating.  Everytime I listen to this song, it still gives me goosebumps.
Other songs such as ""Beloved Wife"", sounded better in the concert than on the CD.  Her yearning voice for a loss of a beloved is just so real and haunting.  It makes me feel what it is like to lose a loved one.
Ophelia, contrary to the comments of the others here, is a great choice as an opening song.  A haunting and moving song about the many things that a woman could be.
These are days, is a good version but I found it dry compared to her performance in MTV unplugged.
Space Oddity is another favorite, Break Your Heart, though a good song did not live up to my expectations as a live performance.  I found it dry too.
Overall, the concert is worth the watch for people who appreciates and loves life.  You must be in a reflecting and open mind mood when you watch it, if you are a non-Natalie fan.",1027987200,6,1627,4.205787781350482
7916040,4,B00002ND7Y,"A new fan of Miss Merchant and her spellbinding voice, I find myself putting the ""Natalie Merchant Live in Concert"" disc in my player more than any other concert in my extensive music DVD collection.  Even my husband....a die-hard SRV fan if that gives you a clue....will sneak a viewing of the FANTASTIC rendition of ""These are Days"" when he thinks no one is watching.  The experience is magical and liberating, mysterious but oddly comforting. With the exception of a couple fairly slow and dreary ballads - this is an essential music DVD for fans of all types of music.",1017964800,7,572,4.71
