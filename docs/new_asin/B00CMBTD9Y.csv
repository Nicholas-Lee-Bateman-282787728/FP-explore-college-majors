8583267,5,B00CMBTD9Y,"This review is of the original movie but this remastered version is the same with some additional Special Features.
This Documentary movie is a riot.  I bought it many years ago, still have it, and watch it from time-to-time.  It is true life, a real filming of a radio station contest in Texas where about 12 contestants must keep their hands on a new ""hard body"" Nissan truck.  The last person to have their hands on the truck wins the truck.  There are several contestants who are ""characters""; one is bordering on not normal.  It is interesting to see some of the people who loose the contest when they forget that they are suppose to keep their hands on the truck.  The camera is right there when this happens.  One of those slip-ups is almost not caught but we, the viewers, see it.  You almost want to stand up and shout ""Look. Look. He let go!""  It is a most interesting contest.  I'm sure the documentary people did not know they were going to be so lucky in the make up of the contestants.",1505865600,,999,4.380434782608695
8583268,4,B00CMBTD9Y,"This is a fascinating glimpse into an endurance contest, where people's hopes of winning a truck are pitted against their physical limits.  If the filmmakers had spent more time with the participants it would have been even better, but it's very watchable as is.",1452988800,,262,4.954545454545454
8583269,4,B00CMBTD9Y,"The movie is well mastered overall. Unfortunately, I received a scratched DVD. The good news is the seller shipped me a new DVD without any issues.",1421193600,,147,4.6923076923076925

8583271,5,B00CMBTD9Y,"Just saw the musical for this and wanted to see the documentary.  It's a real story about real people and their individual needs -- why they want to spend hours on their feet, in the heat, to win a truck.  If you have an opportunity to see the musical -- under the same name -- you will enjoy it.  The music is awesome and the stories about the individuals are unbelievable!",1411603200,,374,4.23943661971831
8583272,5,B00CMBTD9Y,"This is, as one of the principle players says, ""A human drama kind of thing.""  It's a kind of Texas-style contest involving a pickup truck and endurance.  It's also kind of like being naked for days in a goldfish bowl.  Enormously entertaining.  Ultimately, I think, even inspiring.  Whatever it costs, it's worth every penny.
