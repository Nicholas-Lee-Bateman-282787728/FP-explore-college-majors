8088992,5,B000BMASWC,"Though many of these classic cartoons can be seen in other collections, this DVD has a varied assortment from several studios and ranging from 1926 through 1949. All are in good condition as far as definition is concerned considering their age, and only a few show substantial color deterioration. One of the best is also the most unique, ""You Can't Shoe a Horsefly,"" starring Hunky and Spunky. I have not seen this episode before, and it is one of the best of the Hunky and Spunky series. Total running time is 65 minutes, and it is a mix of 4 and 5 star episodes. The list is:

1: ""Yankee Doodle Daffy,"" 1943, directed by Isadore Freleng, animated by Richard Bickenbach, with music by Carl Stalling for the Schlesinger Studios. Daffy Duck is a pushy talent agent, trying to get Porky Pig to hire his client, the very unwilling Sleepy Lagoof, who is more interested in his lollipop. Daffy sings ""I'm Just Wild About Harry,"" does a banjo solo, and imitates Carmen Miranda with ""Boom-Chicky-Boom."" 5*

2: ""Molly Moo Cow and Rip Van Winkle,"" 1935, directed by Burt Gillett and Tom Palmer, for the Van Beuren Studios. Molly makes the mistake of not listening to her ""good angel,"" and drinks Van Winkle's sleep inducing brew. This episode is a bit lame. 4*

3: ""Gold Rush Daze,"" 1939, directed by Ben Hardaway and Cal Dolton, animated by Gil Turner, for the Schlesinger Studios. The City Slicker goes West to dig for gold, and gets the scoop from the Old Prospector. 4*

4: ""Slick Sleuths,"" directed by Bud Fisher, with music by Jerry Bradford and Gerard Carbonara, for Jefferson/Bud Fisher Films. A silent cartoon with sound effects, this was originally in b&w, but is shown here in its colorized version. Mutt and Jeff try to catch the evil ""Phantom,"" who is a master of disguises (one is a Charlie Chaplin caricature). This isn't a very imaginative episode, but a great part of cartoon history, as Mutt and Jeff were such long lasting characters (1913-1982). 4*

5: ""You Can't Shoe a Horsefly"" (incorrectly labeled on the DVD box as ""You Can't Shoe a Shoefly""), 1940, directed by Dave Fleischer, animated by Myron Waldman, music by Sammy Timberg for Fleischer Studios. Beautifully drawn and scored, this is an adorable Hunky and Spunky episode, as Hunky helps Spunky with his pesky fly problem. 5*

6: ""The Lost Dream,"" 1949, directed by Bill Tytla, animated by George Germanetti and Harvey Patterson, with music by Winston Sharples for the Famous Studios. Little Audrey meets a Lost Dream, and they have some terrific adventures in Dreamland. This is one of the best Little Audrey episodes, and though this print is a little dark, is still good viewing. 5*

7: ""Confusions of a Nutzi Spy,"" 1943, directed by Norman McCabe, animated by Izzy Ellis. Bloodhound Eggbert helps Porky Pig track down the ""Missing Lynx,"" a spy who is a master of disguises. This episode has substantial color deterioration, and is in sepia tones. 4*

8: ""Wolf Wolf,"" 1944, directed by Mannie Davis, music by Phil Scheib, for Terrytoon Cartoons. Features Mighty Mouse, who saves the Little Lambs from being dinner for a pack of hungry wolves. This is probably the best cartoon in this collection from many aspects, including excellent color/definition quality. 5*

9: ""Robin Hood Makes Good,"" 1939, directed by Chuck Jones, animated by Bill McKimson, with music by Carl Stalling for the Schlesinger Studios. Squirrels act out the Robin Hood story, when a fox deceives them by pretending to be Maid Marion. 4*

10: ""Ding Dog Daddy,"" directed by Isadore Freleng, animated by Gerry Chinquy, with music by Carl Stalling for the Schlesinger Studios. Shy Dog falls in love with Daisy Dog, who he later mistakes as a statue. When the statue gets melted down for the war effort, the results are explosive. Stylish animation in the bomb factory, set to Beethoven's 5th Symphony. 5*",1139702400,3,3846,4.840182648401827
