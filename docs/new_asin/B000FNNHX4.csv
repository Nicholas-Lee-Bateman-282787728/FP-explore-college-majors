2577244,5,B000FNNHX4,"I am very satisfied by this DVD set.  It contains numerous interviews with veterans of the campaign. It also interviews numerous historians to get their perspective.  It makes good use of color film whenever possible.

It is a 3 dvd set and 5.5 hours in length.  A world war II buff won't be disappointed with this set.  It has segments on the prelude to Iwo Jima, and a brief hour on the aftermath of Iwo Jima and the Okinawa invasion.  The main documentary (2.5 hours) is direct coverage of the Iwo Jima invasion.  It is all color film.  There is a great scene of an observation aircraft filming a flame-thrower tank. The veteran interviews are moving and eye-opening.  I finished watching with an uneasy and sad set of emotions.  The documentary is that good.

Did you know that the Japanese used rocket-propelled, human-piloted bombs dropped from twin engine planes as one form of Kamikaze attack?
Did you know that American pilots on Iwo Jima were attacked in their camps by lingering Japanese that had been thought to have been mopped up?
Did you know that the Japanese were taking refuge up to 5-stories deep in the island?

Just some of the many things I learned.

I have found the Timeless Media Group to produce some excellent DVD box  sets.  I hope they continue to live up to this level of quality.",1159056000,21,1310,4.6103896103896105

8124860,5,B000FNNHX4,"This documentary film was very informative on how the individual combatant experienced his role in the operation! I am glad to see this was filmed with the living vets!! These men are not to long with us before they will be gone!!
I served in Vietnam, and I am in my sixties. I feel akin to these men!!  Thank you AMAZON for having such a priceless documentary film!!",1428019200,,367,4.397058823529412
8124861,4,B000FNNHX4,"The main Iwo Jima documentary is contained on disc #1. Disc #2 contains a brief summary of the Pacific War, an episode on the B-29, and a short piece on Iwo Jima memorials. Disc #3 has decent coverage of the Okinawa battle, a short piece on kamikazes, and a short piece on Japan's surrender.

There was mention that USA trade with China and the USA's objections to Japan's early expansion into Indochina were reasons why the USA went to war with Japan. However, that is not true. Pearl Harbor was the reason; the other items were peripheral.

Also, the documentary showed maps of the Pacific and said Japan planned to conquer coastal countries plus many of the surrounding islands. They made it sound like that was Japan's only intent. However, Japan's goal was world dominance.

Disc #1 is the best due to the footage, narration, and veteran interviews about Iwo Jima. 29 veterans are named in the credits.

8124862,5,B000FNNHX4,"There are two versions of this DVD. One is 2 hours and 12 minutes, the other is 1 hour and 54 minutes. The shorter one has more talking by survivors. The longer has more about the battle. Anyone who is interested in the bloodiest battle in Marine history, has to watch this movie. I was a Sargent in the Corps in Viet Nam, with three Purple Hearts and still can't imagine what Iwo was like. I knew one Marine who was there ,and he refused to talk about it. And that man was my Father.",1364256000,3,484,4.105263157894737
8124863,5,B000FNNHX4,"Timeless Media do a great job at producing detailed documentaries that not only contain great footage but excellent interviews with the men that experienced the hell that is war. Iwo Jima 36 Days of Hell is no exception and portrays the battle in an unfiltered way that has an emotional impact on the viewer and hopefully better understanding as to the brutality and sacrifice that was made.
  I have so much sympathy for the poor souls that had to endure this horrific event and still suffer from its after effects to this day.
  My only beef is that the Timeless Media blurays aspect ratios are boxed on both sides and do not format to wide screen.",1358812800,,650,4.577586206896552
8124864,5,B000FNNHX4,"For all historians, this is great to add to your library.  Much of the footage has not been released in other productions, but footage is authenic and real.  Recommend this to the serious at heart history guys.",1297036800,5,210,4.648648648648648

8124866,4,B000FNNHX4,"First the good - This documentary contains almost exclusively excellent color footage from Iwo and several other battles, a rarity even in the best WWII documentaries, and well worth the price of admission for WWII buffs.  The actual story is well told, if incompletely.  The interviews with the veterans of the battle are good, and are sure to become more valuable historically as the old heros pass away.  They remind me of some of the stories I heard growing up as a boomer in a neighborhood populated mostly by South Pacific veterans, who were the dads of my friends.

Now the bad - My problem with this story is mostly with the ""Prologue"" section, which attempts to present the U.S. and Japan as competing nations who went to war basically to win trading rights with China.  China at this time was an insignificant trading partner with the U.S., and the U.S. would have never gone to war for this reason.  This a typical modern attempt to shift blame for the war to the U.S.  The documentary goes on to state that Japan's expansion would have been complete once it controlled the South Pacific - more pure fantasy.  Japanese doctrine clearly states that rule ""of the four corners of the earth"" was the Emporer's devine right, and the conquest of the United States was the last phase of world domination, as layed out in the Tanaka Memorial.  General Yamamoto himself stated several days after Pearl Harbor that he would march his armies into Washington D.C. and dictate terms of surrender to the president.  Japan and Germany both openly stated repeatedly that they would conquer the the world, and set about doing just that.  To state Japan would be satisfied once they conquered the Pacific is not only historical folly, it demeans the U.S. as just a competing nation for world dominance.  The truth is the U.S. was a reluctant participant in WWII and went to war only after attacked.  When the U.S. finished liberating half the world at a terrible price in blood and capital, for the most part they went home like the true heroes these men were, and still are.",1185840000,14,2068,4.695290858725762
