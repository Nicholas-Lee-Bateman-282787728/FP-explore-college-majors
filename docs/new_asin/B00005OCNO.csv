7948679,5,B00005OCNO,"A great primer on the seven basic machine tools in the modern machine shop.  VHS resolution is typical of 2001, designed to display on CRT's but the information is great to have for anyone interested in machine shop manufacturing methods.  I first saw this in 2004 on the History Channel and thought the website price was too high to buy.  I regretted that decision later especially when the History Channel was sold but was thrilled to find a new copy in 2015.",1434585600,,461,4.597560975609756

He likes this so much, he ordered the VHS because he lost the DVD he had and it was no longer available.",1392076800,,245,4.444444444444445
