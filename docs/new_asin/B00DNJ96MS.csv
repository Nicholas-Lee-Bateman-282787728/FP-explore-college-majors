Much like the olde to the grind house that was the Disco Exorcist or the 50's sci-fi drive-in which was Atomic Brain Invasion they have chosen the early 80's slasher films with Murder University. MU is about a young man named Josh who just lost his father and is attending college for the first time. Unfortunately he has chosen a school were the student body is constantly shrinking due to the machninations of the Greensboro Devil. This masked killer seems bent on wiping out the entire student body. Josh aligns himself with washed up detective Ray Forrester and his daughter to try and stop this killer before it's too late. Expertly acted with Jamie Dufault as Josh, Michael Thurber as Det. Forrester and Sammie Accampora as Meg his daughter. The film boasts a great cast from the New England theater district and great effects with a truly 80's soundtrack. This film has everything that was great about the first run slasher films like The Prowler and Prom Night. If you are a fan of this genre then you have to check the film out.",1372896000,10,1125,4.63

8595017,1,B00DNJ96MS,"All over this DVD cover there are these glowing tributes....who got paid and how much! I can usually find something good even in a bad movie somewhere, I call them ""good bad movies"" This train wreck is not among them. This is a Very bad bad movie. The real horror here is the actors, the actresses, the directing, the effects and worst of all the dialog. I get when you start a film career you get your friends to be in it but all these people are extra heavy and not too attractive and they are painting them as sexy people. Should have found another way. I threw myself on this grenade for you.....I sacrificed myself.....DON'T DO IT!",1405296000,,636,4.398305084745763
8595018,5,B00DNJ96MS,"At first I was a bit hesitant about purchasing this dvd because it seemed to come out of no where but I still took rolled the dice and purchased it.  It was without a doubt a very welcome surprise.  It had numerous great kills (a lot of which were be-headings!).  The blood and guts were reminicent of old school 80's and early 90's special effects, like friday the 13th, sleepaway camp, the burning, etc.  As far as I could tell, there was NO CGI in this film...and that was great.  I would recommend this to any fan of old school horror or for people who are tired of watching the new horror nowadays like zombies or endless movies with the word ""Paranormal"" in the title.",1403913600,4,674,4.36

Murder University is a low budget film that succeeds in its attempt to make you feel like you're watching an 80s slasher flick. Everything works to perfection such as the acting,the great musical score and the gory over the top kills.

It had me laughing out loud a few times due to some of the clever and hilarious dialogue,it reminded me somewhat of John Waters earlier work. The Kills are great for the budget and we are treated to several decapitations,stabbings ,ax murders a Maniac-esque scalping and more! I was very very impressed with these on a dime effects even though a couple of them were CGI.

The story is nothing new or exciting but that's ok because everything else that's great makes up for it's lack of originality.

There are some highly entertaining characters like resident DJ (Juicy K Thunder),(Loco Larry) and quite a few others,the kills during the sex scenes really bump it up that extra notch to 80s Slasher heaven. I'll  surely  be looking for more films from Robert Griffin in the future.",1388880000,4,1079,4.774193548387097
8595020,4,B00DNJ96MS,"The film opens with multiple murders inside the house of Charles Green, the founder of the conservative Greensboro University of Greensboro, Mass. The students inside the house claim their university founder was a murderer before they die.

After an interesting, original and well done title song (""We're Going to Murder U), Josh Green (Jamie Dufault) is headed off as a freshman to said university only to be bullied by an odd group of characters...for instance he is threatened by Loco Larry (Nick Apostolides) for looking at his girlfriend. She was in a wet t-shirt contest as a way to end the exploitation of women.

As the murders pile up around Josh, he is determined to find the killers and is aided by Detective Forrester (Michael Thurber) and his daughter Meg (Samantha Acampora).  Like any good 80's slasher, the plot comes full circle as all the loose ends are tired up as if we care.

This is an extreme low budget film. The blood squirts and body parts are comical. What I liked about the film was the writing, the characters, and the campy dialog. For instance the McCarthyite drama teacher was Mrs. Bachmann (Mary Paolino). There is a 50's girl (Dana Haley) having sex saying ""I like Ike"" to bring her to climax. Josh's mother (Lee Rush) was also a fun character.

There are no beautiful silicon stars in this film. It was shot in Rhode Island which is why they made the setting rival Massachusetts.

If you love 80's style campy films, this one is worth watching.
