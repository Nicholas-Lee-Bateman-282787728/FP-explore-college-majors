1813548,4,B00007GZRV,"The cartoons are from the 1980's Hello Kitty tv series ""Hello Kitty's Furry Tale Theater,"" which are variations on popular fairy tales/movies. They feature Hello Kitty, My Melody, Tuxedo Sam, Chip, Catnip & Grinder, who are actors in the theatre.

Each DVD contains 5 fairy tales, and each fairy tale is about 10 minutes long and has its own unique take on the familiar stories.  They are also changed to be less violent, nicer and more suited for children (water balloon fights instead of guns).

The quality of the DVD's are more like TV broadcast quality and this is the reason I've given it 4 stars instead of 5. I think they could've enhanced the quality before putting it onto DVD.  It is also not recorded in stereo sound.  I already owned the 2 Furry Tale Theater VHS's (Kitty and the Beast, The Wizard of Paws), so I already knew what to expect.

I'm an adult Sanrio collector and I loved seeing these episodes, and I would feel good about letting my children see these too.

The following is the list of the episodes in this DVD:

""Hello Kitty Saves the Day"" contains Grinder Genie and the Magic Lamp, Peter Penguin, Tar-Sam of the Jungle, Paws of the Round Table, and Crocodile Penguin.",1119398400,6,1197,4.586854460093897

7976872,4,B00007GZRV,"Five episodes from the Hello Kitty Furry Tale Theater which was broadcast during 1987. This disc contains: Peter Penguin; Tar-Sam of the Jungle; Paws of the Round Table; and, Crocodile Penguin.

The target audience is 3 - 6 years and the younger ages will not comprehend some jokes but the bold colors will keep pre-schoolers mesmerized. These would be spectacular if the sound was better mixed, however it is very good when played through my $3000 speakers. I am not saying the sound is bad but rather that it sounds excellent only on excellent speakers as opposed to my 22-inch flat-screen with self-contained DVD player and little speakers.

I disagree with other reviewers about credits and insults. I doubt any child will miss the opening and closing credits. And, I doubt this program is going to corrupt young children as I am sure they hear more and worse insults at home or if they attend pre-school or school they are already exposed to such. Moreover, the few insults are almost inconsequential and certainly far from horrific or startling.

In an ideal world children would not hear insults but only a naive parent would think or believe young children are going to attend school without hearing insults or rude remarks. Children mimic parents and fifty-percent of America is semi-literate and speaks vulgar English. Vulgarities and obscenities are part and parcel of common English for most Americans. And if you doubt me, just listen to most contemporary rock or rap music.

I disagree with another reviewer who says the episodes do not have any moral or educational value. Each episode has a message oriented script and very clearly stated message at the end. Considering the price for used discs, this is a bargain and should be bought. I think these episodes are more appropriate for 5 year old children rather than 3 year olds.",1261440000,,1845,4.903846153846154

--------------------------------------------------

For those who don't already know, contained on this DVD are stories from the 1987 Saturday morning series ""Hello Kitty's Furry Tale Theater"".  You wouldn't know that by watching the disc because there are NO SERIES OPENING TITLES and NO SERIES END CREDITS!!!  Yes, you read that correctly.  They left out one of the most significant parts of a television series.  Remember the catchy theme song?  Well, all you'll have are your memories because that theme won't be found here.  There's a credits block on the back of the case that lists the voice actors and major crew, but it doesn't list the minor crew members.  Pity all of the poor animators whose work on the series now goes uncredited.

The series consists of 13 half-hour episodes with 2 stories per episode (26 stories total).  Yet only 25 of the 26 stories appear on these five discs.  Keep in mind that's only 5 stories per each 10.00 disc (that's the original price).  They could have easily fit the entire series onto two dual-layer discs for 20.00.  So not only are you missing a story, and NOT getting the episodes in their original 2-story pairs with the original series opening titles and end credits, but you're being bilked for what little you DO get!

The previous VHS releases in the late 1990s (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wizard-of-Paws-VHS/dp/0792838394/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wizard of Paws VHS</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kitty-The-Beast-VHS/dp/0792838386/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kitty & The Beast VHS</a>) were MUCH better than these five DVDs.  Sure they only included four stories each, but they included the series opening titles and end credits, which makes them a vast improvement over these DVDs.  I can only hope that someone at MGM wakes up and re-releases this series as a proper ""complete series"" set, but I doubt that that will ever happen.",1223683200,,3862,7.4298245614035086
7976874,1,B00007GZRV,"We have many Hello Kitty products and I was under the impression that the cute little kitty which can be found everywhere from McDonald's to Scholastic book orders was sweet and innocent.  This was the first movie I had ever purchased.  There is too much violence in the movie and a lot of name calling (""dummy"", ""idiot"").  I totally agree with the above review from (Mom2MySophia?) .... she's got it all right, it's just inappropriate.",1200096000,4,436,4.786666666666667
