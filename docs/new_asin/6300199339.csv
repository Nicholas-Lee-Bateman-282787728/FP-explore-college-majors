228884,1,6300199339,"I bought this tape for my parents for Christmas based on the previous reviewer's comments, and I'm afraid that we all strongly disagree. First of all, 80-90% of the tape has nothing to do with the Honeymooners show; there are instead clips from Jackie Gleason's variety show. Second, these are not ""bloopers"" such as props falling or the cast members making funny slip ups or anything like that. As the clips are shown there is a narrator trying to explain what is going on, but it is not very funny at all. I say watch the original shows instead.",978134400,4,547,4.5353535353535355
228885,5,6300199339,"The Honeymooners Christmas Special is one of my favorites.  After watching it on the Honeymooners Marathon I was glad to see it available.  It had me laughing -- Ed Norton is too funny -- and it had me in tears.  It's a  classic to own. I never watched this I Love Lucy Christmas special.  I was  surprised to see flashbacks of a few other episodes -- especially the one  when Ricky finds out Lucy is expecting.  I liked the ending and was  surprised to see where the thought came from -- an earlier episode made  that was never shown until this video. As a person who's always loved the  Holiday Season, the Honeymooners and I Love Lucy, I am very happy to own  this video.",932688000,29,674,4.304

7805339,5,6300199339,"I love the Lucy & Honeymooners Christmas VHS. It was a replacement for an old one, that my husband had for a long time.",1372032000,,119,4.0
7805340,5,6300199339,"The key episode here is Better Living through TV which I consider in the top 3 of all time for a comedy performance by a particular comedian. Jackie Gleason shows his comedic genius when it's time to go on the air. To say more would spoil it for those who have never seen the episode. One comedy episode which would be in the same ball park as this one is the I Love Lucy episode in which Lucille Ball becomes drunk while making a TV commercial. Ironically Better Living Through TV provides the same TV commercial venue. Again, all children, teenagers, adults and elderly people should see this episode. It's timeless - people will still be laughing at it 100 years from now!",1300665600,,675,4.495934959349594
7805341,5,6300199339,"I loved this.  OK, I admit being a former member of R.A.L.P.H. but still, you can't find these episodes easily these days on cable or satellite tv.  To here ""ohhh it can core a apple"" is to bring a smile to your face at the antics of these two poor schleps trying to make it in life.  Carney and Gleason were the only comedy duo to closely imitate Laurel & Hardy and that is high praise from a SONS member.",1249084800,,406,4.05
7805342,5,6300199339,"the price was right, the delivery was quick and the episode of the honeymooners was funny and heart warming.  It brought back good T V from the past.  very enjoyable",1229731200,,165,4.466666666666667
7805343,4,6300199339,"Recorded in SP mode and hifi sound, MPIs HONEYBLOOPERS offers decent quality clips of vintage 16mm films. The audio on these is somewhat muffled compared to the voiceovers, but still clear with a good sound system. Total running time: 45 minutes. (This program is not available on DVD.)

What are here characterized as ""bloopers"" are more precisely actors adjusting to unforseen events. Considering the nature of live broadcast, the folks here acquit themselves quite well.

The program opens with a Gleason monologue that's disrupted by backstage clamor. Then, Jackie rambles (it's called ""stretching"") about Leroy Anderson while a dance number set is made ready. In a live ""Beat the Clock"" Honeymooners sketch, Audrey Meadows forgets her lines and Jackie covers for her.

In other vignettes, Gleason has problems with a skittish horse, he drops a steamer trunk on a fence and it falls over, and in an embarrassing moment, Jackie turns his back to zip up his fly during a Honeymooners segment from his variety show. Next, he stalls for time by dancing and doing impressions. Cast members slip and fall during a hectic pie fight skit.

The finale to the ""Beat the Clock"" episode doesn't seem to have any errors, but in another live Honeymooners sketch entitled ""Game Called on Account of Marriage,"" Gleason deftly changes the plot when a building facade won't support the weight of him on a ladder.

Transferred from Jackie Gleason's personal collection, there are currently six editions of the HONEYMOONERS LOST EPISODES series.

7805344,5,6300199339,"This is a classic episode from 1955. This is one of the all time best Honeymooners episodes ever. In my opinion, it is the best episode ever. It is very well written and acted and at the end of the episode the actors come out and greet the audience. In addition, it has lots of holiday spirit.",1106956800,5,293,4.157894736842105
7805345,4,6300199339,"""Mind Your Own Business"" originally aired on 5/26/56. This is the episode where, in part on Ralph's advice, Ed gets fired from his job in the sewer and starts selling irons door-to-door. It does not work out, but he eventually gets his old job back. There is some suspense in the episode as Ed tells Ralph that he is very successful in selling the irons when in reality he is not.",1106956800,,380,4.366197183098592
7805346,5,6300199339,"""Letter To The Boss,"" which was first performed live on ""The Jackie Gleason Show"" on November 14, 1953, was one of the first long ""Honeymooners"" skits.  It was so well received by people that more and more of these long skits were done, thus allowing the characters to build and the situations to become more realistic.  There are actually three skits on this tape, but the only one I will focus on will be ""Letter To The Boss.""  This is an episode which features the usual Ralph Kramden bits like jumping to conclusions, allowing his mouth to get him into trouble, and just about anything else you can name!  I don't want to give away the whole show if you haven't seen it, but believe me, this is one show that all fans will enjoy.  It is fun to look at the shows now, and realize that they were performed within the context of an hour variety show.  Yet these ""lost"" ""Honeymooners"" shows are so strong that they can stand alone almost 50 years after the were first done.",991267200,11,973,4.407821229050279
