8009181,5,B0001A7V0G,"I agree with all the other reviewers.
The picture quality needs to be digitally restored.
Over all 6 stars out of 5 for this movie.
I got both part one and two under the title
Wolfen Ninja & Wolfen Ninja 2
They don't have it at Amazon.com",1308182400,,238,4.085106382978723
8009182,4,B0001A7V0G,VERY IMPRESSIVE SWORDPLAY. GOOD ACTING AND GOOD DUBBING AND SOME FUNNY PARTS THROWN IN FOR GOOD MEASURE. I THOUGHT THE VIDEO QUALITY WAS PRETTY GOOD CONSIDERING ITS A OLD SCHOOL WUXIA FLICK. I MEAN ITS NOT DIGITALLY REMASTERED OR ANYTHING. NOT ONLY IS IT WATCHABLE BUT ITS WORTH EVERY PENNY U SPEND ON IT IF YOUR ABLE TO GET A COPY...,1229472000,3,334,4.491803278688525
8009183,3,B0001A7V0G,"this movie is good, but the rating is for the movie quality.  the production company should have released a cleaner version IMO.  On the plus side there is Chang Ling...need i say more and fei meng is also in here although his role is kinda crappy.  I remember this film ever since i was a child so i will be purchasing me a version in a short while so if you love classic kung fu flick this should be in your library.",1208908800,,418,4.073170731707317
8009184,5,B0001A7V0G,PICK THIS UP! U WONT REGRET IT! ITS THE BEST FROM THE MANTIS COLLECTION. AGAIN PICK THIS UP! FROM KUNG FU COLLECT,1164240000,,113,4.181818181818182
