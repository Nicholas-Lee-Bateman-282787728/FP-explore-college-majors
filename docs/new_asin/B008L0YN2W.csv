5169038,1,B008L0YN2W,"Low quality photography, too much talking by park rangers, low quality sound, not lively at all, no way to compare with a similar BBC documentary.  Unsuitable even for children and teens.",1360108800,10,187,5.032258064516129
5169039,5,B008L0YN2W,Color and images are absolutely beautiful. Makes you feel like you've been there. And the commentary is very educational and interesting. :) We are planning to visit most of these national parks one day so these blu rays are a great intro-definately has us excited about our future vacation options.,1359417600,12,299,5.0
5169040,4,B008L0YN2W,Great information.  sometimes a bit long.  More of a national geographic special than travel info. All in all informative information,1357862400,4,133,5.6
5169041,4,B008L0YN2W,"This series gives a good overview of some of our national parks.
I purchased this series since my wife has difficulty walking, and wouldn't be able to tour these parks with me.
This became my only option for seeing the parks.
The photography is excellent, and I am happy overall with purchasing these.
The interviews with rangers and others tend to be lengthy, which is why I did not rae this EXCELLENT.
I would also like to have closed captioning, as my hearing is not the best and I use hearing aids.",1356480000,6,502,4.467391304347826
5169042,1,B008L0YN2W,"6 disc Bluray set, individually packaged (for clarification, since there seems to be some confusion.)

Note: This set has nothing to do with the BBC Yellowstone mini-series (currently on Netflix Instant).

Shot at 30 frames per second on what looks like a first gen HD camera (think evening news quality). The graphics/interface/titles/animations look like they were done by high school students.

Super disappointing. Return request for sure.",1355788800,18,443,5.582089552238806
5169043,4,B008L0YN2W,"To us it gave us the possibility to recall the trips we have made through the years to all these parks, complementing the
photographic mementos that we were able to capture. These videos have helped to add the real beauty of the parks with a depth that a a typical 'tourist' drive will never achieve.",1355443200,,300,4.472727272727273
5169044,5,B008L0YN2W,"You may have seen  these National Parks before, but this version is different  and  not rerun of other recordings.
I think the Great Smoky Mountain dvd was the weakest one.  The others, are like being there.  If your television is
high definition and you have a blu ray player  that can reproduce  what these dvd offer, you may feel like dodging
the water at the water falls.  The video quality is unbelievable.  Jaw dropping.  Great arm chair entertainment.
These park video are great the second time around.  Not saying the picture quality of The Great Smoky Mountains was
poor, but the content was not as good.  Until seeing this version of the Grand Canyon, I did not realize just how
Grand.  The ancient cave art, was presented the best I had seen.  Beating National Geographic and History channel
presentations.

5169045,3,B008L0YN2W,"The video quality is great.  I purchased this 4 dvd set at Walmart for ten dollars.  Went back to Walmart to buy more of them to give as gifts. They were sold out.  I saw this Nation Parks Exploration Series at Amazon.  The price was 19.98.  I  ordered 3 sets for gifting, thinking I was getting a 6 dvd set.  The ten dollar
set has 2 dvd with recording on both sides.  I thought the doubled price set would have only one side of each dvd
recorded on.  That turns out to not be the case.  This 19.98 boxed set is the same as the box set that i paid
ten dollars for at Walmart.  The quality of the picture and sound may be 5 star, but I dislike paying that much
for the same set I had bought for ten dollars.  I have other dvd  and  blu ray dvd  of these same parks.  This brand
beats the National Geographic versions  that  I  have  seen.  This brand of these same parks in blu ray come boxed
one dvd to a case  and  only one side of the dvd recorded on. I have the blu ray version from Amazon.  Had this set been one side recorded, I  think 5-star.

5169055,5,B008L0YN2W,At my age (81) it is too late for much traveling.  This series of films provides what I will miss at my age in life.  You get close-up views such as are not even possible in a personal visit.,1388707200,3,191,3.871794871794872

5169060,1,B008L0YN2W,"There have been a few really beautiful programs done by National Geographic and others, and I expected these to be something like those, but they're not even close.

This series was made by some guy with a camera to sell and make money.

The photography is ok but not great and a lot of times I asked myself why they included some of the shots and why did they hold them so long?  Boring.  Why is the scenery so many times obscured behind tourists?

The announcer in most of these is just irritating to listen to.  He has perfect pronunciation and talks slowly because of it, not natural at all.  Dull.
And most of the information you get comes from lengthy speeches given by park rangers or a few ""experts"" sitting in their cluttered back yards!  Boring and dumb.

The guys that made these spent as little money as possible, almost nothing, and it shows.  They took a camera to these parks and took the tours and shot some pictures and filmed the rangers giving their tour lectures.

I'm checking to see if I can still get my money back, it's not worth twenty bucks.",1365206400,11,1067,4.420512820512821

5169064,3,B008L0YN2W,"Has some good stuff, some boring stuff.  I have been to many of these places and I think the video could have been spiced up a bit.  It was more like sitting through a high school class film.",1360368000,4,191,4.0
