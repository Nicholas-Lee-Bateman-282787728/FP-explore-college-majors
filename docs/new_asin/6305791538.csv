8577540,4,6305791538,"The fifth volume in the HULK HOGAN's ROCK n' WRESTLING cartoons is surprisingly enjoyable. I loved Volumes 1,2,and 3. Volume 4, I was very disappointed in, but 5 is very good. This contains the episodes ""MUSCLE MADNESS"" where Wendi Richter and the Fabulous Moolah are entered into a Muscle and Weight Lifting Competition to determine who the strongest lady of Wrestling is. Uh oh! Looks like Roddy and the Gang will have some nasty tricks up their sleeves again! In the hilarious ""BIG JOHN'S CAR LOT"" Rowdy Roddy Piper, The Iron Sheik, Big John Studd, and Nikolai Volkoff take over Big John Studd, Sr.'s Car Lot to sell used (VERY USED!) cars to any sucker willing to pay 20 bucks. Not bad for a 1957 Convertible, even if it is a klunker. GREAT EPISODE! In ""THE FOSTER WRESTLER"" food supplies are mysteriously disappearing from an Indian Village, and it's our Wrestlers to the rescue. The funniest moment in this is at the beginning where Captain Lou orders a bowl of Hot Chicken Curry for 5 cents - to receive a FLAMING HOT SURPRISE that water by contrast costs 10 dollars a glass! Recommended for WWF fans. It will look good with your collection, especially for circa 1984/1985 nostalgia.",984528000,6,1190,4.725961538461538
