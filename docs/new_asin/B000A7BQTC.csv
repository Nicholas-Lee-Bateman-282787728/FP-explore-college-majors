2377657,5,B000A7BQTC,"I found this documentary extremely interesting, and had to watch it twice to feel I had absorbed the information as fully as possible.  It seems to parallel an extremely interesting book I am in the process of reading entitled ""The Secret In The Bible"" by Tony Bushby.  I highly recommend BOTH!! 10/9/05",1128816000,10,303,4.8076923076923075
8075438,3,B000A7BQTC,"This is okay if you're a fan of this author's books but there's not a lot of meaningful information here.
Basically common knowledge.

Video quality is very good, upscales to 4K well enough.",1513296000,,190,4.757575757575758

8075440,3,B000A7BQTC,"Good DVD to watch. Brought out lots of questions regarding the history of the
Roman Catholic Church, although no proof of theory. Interesting read.",1429920000,,147,5.166666666666667
8075441,1,B000A7BQTC,"This video starts off with a comparison between Brown's book and the truth about the Vatican. Eventually, when discussing the Illuminati and the Freemasons, many FACTS are ABSENT and opinions are prolific. A 33 degree mason interviewed tries to convince the audience of no secrecy in the secluded circles of the Freemasons and the promtions of community service of the Freemasons throughout the world. I have yet to see 'Freemasons' helping in communities hit hard by natural disasters and such. This film is misleading and very inaccurate.",1264550400,3,540,5.218390804597701
8075442,1,B000A7BQTC,"This video tries to ""correct"" Dan Brown's novel. Unfortunately, based on history and the Bible both are inaccurate. If you're really interested what's behind the secret societies read ""Rule by Secrecy"" by Jimm Marrs. From a Biblical perspective read ""The Dark Side of Freemasonry."" If want free info. there is a good lecture by Prof. Walter Veith on ""Secret Societies"" available on youtube or amazingdiscoveries dot org.",1227312000,,420,5.2835820895522385
8075443,5,B000A7BQTC,"In comparison to the other DVD documentaries about the background information of Angels and Demons this one falls flat, but the section regarding Fremasonry is quite interesting.
 Either the Mason's are extremely stupid or extremely scary.
  Like Dan Brown, I understand it to be the latter! The spokesman defending the
masons from conspiracy theories,
(and oddly enough protecting some political big wigs) happens to be the nefarious
 James Wasserman, do a google on this guy, he is a member of OTO, and a follower of Aleister Crowley, a satanist(claimed Lucifer was his guardian angel) and a man who was thrown out of Italy for sacrificing, orphaned boys.
  The other defender of Freemasonry happens to be (like the antagonist in the novel), an Arab, and a government proponent of neoconservative ideology to Arab nations.......uhm, like do the math",1189382400,2,851,5.175182481751825
8075444,5,B000A7BQTC,"Wow, this is a great DVD if you want to know what forces were really fighting, and still are, the forces of power and darkness in the world!!! Just couldn't be better history in such a short movie!!  Makes you still hope that justice and truth can prevail in this ole world and bring us better in touch with the truths of the higher dimensions!!!  And how we can each be instrumental by our own exemplary and  moral lives in intending these more peaceful, respectful and illumined values.  Sheds alot of light on the confusion that's been perpetuated between the Illuminati and the Freemasons.  Highly recommended for greater understanding. . .",1187049600,,644,4.7657657657657655
8075445,3,B000A7BQTC,"This DVD is divided into 2 parts:
The first part of this DVD is based on ""Dan Brown"" book ""Secrets of ""angles and Demons"""".  Although I did not read the books/novels of ""Dan Brown"" before however, his character is very obvious from the way of analyzing the events according to the first part of this DVD; he simply sees things that we see NORMALLY from a different side of view.  For example, Galileo Galilei, a well-known physicist and astronomer burnt by catholic church because of his scientific proof that is the earth revolves around the sun i.e a claim that contradicts the bible, was trying to destroy the catholic church at that time!(i.e Galileo had a hidden plot to destroy the power of the church using science, according to Dan Brown!!!!)  Another example, the famous drawings of Leonardo Davinci that summarize the ""Genesis"" and show god touch the first human being(Adam) with his finger to impart him the life.  According to Dan Brown explanation, If you replaced the picture of THE god with human brain(i.e Leonardo was very familiar with human anatomy), you will find exact matching.  This means Davinci was sending us a cryptic message, that is, although the ""Genesis"" states that God created Adam, but in reality man mind who created God!!!  The hidden assumption here is "" Davinci"" was under the threaten of the church power when he was drawing!!!!
The second part of this DVD focuses mainly on what is known as Free- Masons; a secrete organization, based on the movie, controls the events of our world and has roots dating to ancient Egyptians/the time of building the Solomon temple.  This part of the movie tries to link all world events and even the foundation of USA to that secret organization.  If you are believing in the conspiracy theory, this movie will be very interesting for you.  If you are believing in reality and distinguishing between what is ""Myth"" and ""real"", you will dislike this DVD as I do!.  3 stars for the music background, the vivid pictures, and the commentators' effort to convince the audience.",1169942400,7,2045,4.817142857142857
8075446,2,B000A7BQTC,"This is a break down of Dan Brown's novel Angels & Demons with part II on Freemasonry. Aaah not so hot, a basic rehash of all conspiracies linked to religion, secret societies (illuminati), artists (Bruzinsky?Rome?) and scientists (Galileo). But could be used as foreplay for his knew movie Da Vinci Code now playing in theaters.",1149379200,3,329,5.0
8075447,5,B000A7BQTC,"It won't matter much if you're a Dan Brown thriller fan or not... Secrets of Angels, Demons and Masons explores two secret societies that exist(ed) with or without the novels. I personally found the second part of this video, the part focusing on the Masons, extremely interesting, one that ought to be watched by everyone. Imagine this... WHY is the Mason all-knowing eye on our money? That alone should drive your interest...",1140393600,7,427,4.944444444444445
