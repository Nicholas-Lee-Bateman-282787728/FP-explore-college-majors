1731088,4,B0000694WG,"When a couple and child are stranded in a small desert town, they find the place suddenly plagued by rabid-fire deaths and the mysterious disappearance of the local children...a coven of senior citizen satanists plotting to use the children as the young bodies for their life of renewed service to the lord of darkness.

1731090,3,B0000694WG,"Audiences' fascination with the occult, along with relaxed production codes, led to a slew of Satanic themed films produced in the late 1960s thru the 1970s, including such movies as Rosemary's Baby (1968), Satan's Skin (1971) aka The Blood on Satan's Claw, The Exorcist (1973), Race with the Devil (1975), The Devil's Rain (1975), The Omen (1976), and this early entry titled The Brotherhood of Satan (1971), featuring L.Q. Jones (Major Dundee, Hang 'Em High, The Wild Bunch), who shared writing and producing credits.  Directed by Bernard McEveety, who worked on any number of television series including ""Rawhide"", ""Branded"", and ""Hawaii Five-O"" to name a few, the film also features Strother Martin (Cool Hand Luke, The Wild Bunch, Slap Shot), Alvy Moore (""Green Acres""), who co-produced with Jones, Charles Bateman (""Manhunt""), Ahna Capri (The Girls on the Beach), Charles Robinson (Sugar Hill), and Geri Reischl (I Dismember Mama), probably best known for replacing Eve Plumb as her character Jan Brady on the spin-off series ""The Brady Bunch Hour"" (1977).

As the film begins we witness (sort of) a family in a car being crushed by a tank, followed by a children's birthday party.  After this we see three people, a man, woman, and a little girl, having a picnic, one that's effectively spoiled once it starts raining (I don't know what they're freaking out about, especially since they're all wearing bathing suits).  Anyway, the man, named Ben (Bateman), his daughter K.T. (Reischl), and his girlfriend Nicky (Capri), whose got some of the biggest fake eyelashes I've ever seen, make a beeline for the car leading to a ridiculously lengthy driving sequence.  As the trio approaches a nearby town, they see the crushed car from the beginning of the film (and its bloody contents), rush into town for help, only to find much craziness (the townsfolk don't seem all that receptive to outsiders).  They take off, and soon after Ben crashes the car, forcing the trio to hoof it back to Nuttyville, only to discover some nastiness in the form of a pair of recently murdered people in a farmhouse.  Ben eventually finds help in the form of the local sheriff (Jones) and his goober deputy Tobey (Moore) and discovers the town is essentially cut off, meaning few get in, and no one gets out (alive, that is).  As the film progresses we learn the town has, in fact, been invaded by a coven of elderly witches with some sort of agenda that involves killing parents and stealing children...for what purpose?  Well, you'll just have to watch to find that out.  Anyway, some more children are taken (including K.T.), the witches deal with one of their own who has strayed (seems the `Master' isn't very forgiving...go figure), and those not yet dead by some odd fashion struggle to comprehend just what exactly is going on...things eventually come to a head as the witches perform a black mass ceremony as Ben, Nicky, the sheriff, Tobey, and the local minister begin to unravel the sinister plot which has taken hold of the small town.

While I did enjoy this film, it does have a few serious flaws, the main one being for the first twenty minutes or so there doesn't seem to be much of a story as we spend the time witnessing a series of seemingly unrelated events (I've watched this film twice now, and it makes a hell of a lot more sense the 2nd time around).  Things do clear up at some later point in the movie, but by that time I suspect a number of viewers will have probably lost some amount of interest.  Another aspect I thought lacking was the presence of a true lead character.  I thought the character of Ben was meant to fill this position, but he never really stepped up as either Charles Bateman just wasn't leading man material, or the role wasn't written in such a way to make his character stand out (I'm leaning more towards the latter).  As a result, we're left to glom onto the various recognizable performers, namely Jones, Martin, and Moore, to fill the void, which they do somewhat, but it just felt odd given they were all supporting characters (I will say this movie's worth seeing for Strother Martin's over the top performance).  About a third of the way through the film I figured out most of what was going on (the proverbial beans are spilt) in terms of the children, so it was kind of downhill after that point as there weren't any real shocking surprises left.  I would have preferred the story to have been structured slightly differently as to have saved some of the juice for the end, but there you go (the ending is of the downbeat type as was common throughout the late 1960s into the 1970s)...there were some interesting attempts at the surreal, one of which included a children's birthday party with a Satanic twist (I've never seen a cake with black frosting before...it doesn't look all that tasty), some of which worked, some of which didn't, but all were entertaining regardless.  There are some uneasy sequences (the use of the children's toys as tools of murder, the various rituals, the robed acolytes, etc.) that defiantly added a creepy, sinister, and slightly funky tone to the film, but given the viewer has to sort of fill gaps numerous times throughout the film, any momentum derived from these parts sort of dribbles away.  There was a good amount of violence in the film, but much of it isn't shown, probably due to budgetary constraints.  I did feel there was a real effort put forth by most involved in the film, and while the end product might be lacking, I still found it entertaining and worth a look, especially if you enjoy oddball, offbeat, unconventional horror features from the 1970s (I know I do).

The picture quality on this DVD release, presented in widescreen (2.35:1) anamorphic, looks surprisingly sharp and clean, and the audio, available in Dolby Digital 2.0 mono, comes through very well.  As far as extras, there's not a lot except for subtitles in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, and Thai, along with a few trailers including a Creature Features promo, Hollow Man (2000), and The Craft (1996).

1731091,5,B0000694WG,"Brotherhood is a lesser known atmospheric chiller of the early 1970s. A family becomes stranded in a small town populated by some decidedly different inhabitants. Similarly themed to ""Race With The Devil"" sort of. What really makes this film work is the excellent cinematagraphy and attention to detail plus a dynamite ending. Sure, the cult almost seems laughable at times but by the end, you won't find them so amusing.

PHIBES, and top it off with one  truly kick-ass evil performance from the late Strother Martin and you have  an instant cult classic. It veers into cheesiness at times, but redeems  itself with beautifully creepy atmosphere. A perfect companion film to both  the previously mentioned ROSEMARY'S BABY as well as the Chuck Heston  classic OMEGA MAN. Too bad it's not on DVD yet. The picture and sound could  use a good remastering, but it's still very much worth seeing on VHS.One of  my personal favorites.",965174400,7,613,4.893203883495145

It's use of close up on toys as threatening portents of things to come is very effective. Some of the satanic ritual scenes are rather hokey and feel like they belong to a different film, but it all contributes to an effective and diabolical sense of mystery.

They gonna transfer their geezer souls into the bodies of these baby children! Well, it's up to our hero, some guy with a girlfriend and a baby daughter of his own, to stop them.  He along with a sheriff, a dopey deputy, a priest, and a retired doctor who is actually the leader of the witches coven.
So it all makes for a lot of fun as kids' toys are used to kill people: a tank runs over a car full of people, a baby doll kills another couple somehow, a knight on a horse kills some guy. Precious memories.

1731103,5,B0000694WG,"I first saw this film when it was first released.  The movie theater gave out packages of Satan seeds as a promo  which had grown into some cool looking wildflowers which I still have to this day in my backyard.  Out of all the films on the subject of Witchcraft and the Occult which sprouted out of the major studios and low budget filmmakers in the late sixties and early seventies, this is the one which chilled me to the bone and I still think its the best of its type to this day.  The subject of soul transference was dealt with here and there throughout horror film history probably reaching its apex with Paul Wendko's 'THE MEPHISTO WALTZ' but this chiller dealt with it through the possession of children. To this day, I have never seen a film which has the classic paranoia of the original 'INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS' but this film comes close. No one can be trusted as slowly we see that each member of the town is involved with the coven of satanists.  The films motif of a married couple who are allowed to enter the town because they have a child and not allowed to leave builds to a chilling climax and the ending is a true stunner.  Old western stalwarts Strother Martin and LQ Jones are included in the mix giving Martin one of his best over the top rolls.  I do not want to spoil it for first time viewers but showing the meetings of the coven and the rituals they perform  are extremely impressive and  director Bernard McEvetty gives the films set pieces just the right amount of atmosphere lacking even in the high tech direct to video dreck being released to this day. All moviegoers interested in horror films owe it to themselves to purchase this gem. 'THE BROTHERHOOD OF SATAN'  is the best film on the occult ever made ,  and as I said way back in the seventies, its a sleeper classic ready to be discovered.",1281484800,4,1839,4.3952802359882
1731114,4,B0000694WG,"The coven scenes--featuring a bunch of cowl-wearing senior citizens--are a little ridiculous, but that's always the case in this kind of movie.  The film really stands out, though, in its superb camerawork and slightly meandering exposition, which conveys uncertainty and dread quite effectively.  A cut above most other satan-cult movies.",1277424000,,339,5.76
1731115,4,B0000694WG,"I can't say I remember this flick from 1971, and it surprises me because I ate this kind of thing up with both hands back then, but I'm glad I found it. This is one nifty piece of film making.

A young couple with his daughter (by a previously deceased wife) are driving through the American South West when they come upon a town. Things are not right here and as the story progresses you find out why. No one else has been able to either leave or enter the town, and a bunch of kids have gone missing. I won't divulge any spoilers here so let's leave it at that.

This movie gets your curiosity up right from the get go. All these weird things happen at the beginning of the film and it all just seems.....weird. But as the story progresses all that weirdness starts to come together and make total (or near total) sense.

This is not at all a lazy movie. There are a lot of things to draw your attention. It's very tight with no real filler added. There is also outstanding use of leitmotif. Tiny things repeat throughout but often with subtle changes.

This movie has more going for it than most in this genre. The main sufferings are due mostly to budget. The director has tons of TV credits under his belt and only a few feature length films but he does more than a decent job here with a decidedly limited budget. The actors are all OK but of course Strother Martin and L.Q. Jones stand out. Ahna Capri is also a step above average and real easy on the eyes to boot.

If they would have had a few more dollars and a few more days this would take on a real gleam. But as it is it's a great view.",1273449600,6,1600,4.148387096774194
1731116,3,B0000694WG,"OK, I have just viewed this movie and for a campy 70's Satanic Horror movie, it is not bad.  A simple yet entertaining plot, ok acting and a wicked ending.  For a movie which is plotted on the worship of Satan, there is no nudity for a change, cool design sets, and Strother Martin portrays the Devilish high priest and his coven of witches and warlocks hang on his every word, which in some instances is quite articulate.  The plot is just like most plots, family get lost in some backwoods town and then get caught up in all the action, but in this movie the protagonist does not come out unscathed.  The sherrif, priest and deputy seem lost in space when trying to solve the mystery which provides some comic relief.  The ending is excellent so I will not spill the beans in that regard.  Not digitally remastered and the imperfections of the film are evident, but not a bad movie for the price.",1260576000,,898,4.412121212121212
1731117,5,B0000694WG,"""The Brotherhood of Satan"" reminded me of why I enjoy watching horror movies from the seventies.  This strange outing has a suspenseful, creepy plot without the gratuitous gore, foul language and sex that plagues today's theatres.  Think ""Village of the Damned"" meets ""Rosemary's Baby.""  Instead of aliens, it is a coven of Satan worshippers that are terrorizing a small, southwestern town.  For three days, it has been isolated from the rest of the world.  No one has been able to get in or out.  It's like an episode of Rod Serling's ""The Twilight Zone.""  Entire families are being murdered and their children whisked away to a secret location.  The Satanists use war toys, dolls, and other seemingly harmless objects to slaughter parents before luring their children away for their own hellish purposes.  One couple, with their little girl, manages to enter the town.  Will they be able to stop the Satan worshippers' diabolical scheme before it is too late?

  Strother Martin gives a realistic, disturbing performance as the evil, two-faced Doc Duncan.  (He also played a mad professor in the successful science fiction horror film ""Sssssss""; he was transforming his young lab assistants into cobras.)  The ending is wonderfully downbeat and left open for the imagination - the type of ending that will haunt and chill you long after the credits have finished.

  If you like occult classics such as ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""Race with the Devil,"" and ""The Devil's Rain,"" then you will want to add ""The Brotherhood of Satan"" to your collection.  It is highly recommended for fans of classic horror.  Also, if you enjoyed the modern ""Skeleton Key,"" starring Kate Hudson and Gena Rowlands, you will want to see ""The Brotherhood of Satan.""  Both films involve body snatching through witchcraft.

  It is a shame that, at the time of this writing, ""The Brotherhood of Satan"" is no longer in print.  Perhaps Sony will reissue it in a two-disc collector's edition with commentary.",1235520000,10,1973,5.015432098765432

1731121,1,B0000694WG,"Piece of crap is the best way to describe this 70's flick. The film had the right ideal, but horrible delivery. The movie pretty much lost me from the begining, with its 5 minute sequence where our lead faimly is driving in a car, with absolutely no dialogue and the worst elevator music possibly imaginably playing in the background. Then we witness a strange and confusing tank death that seems to come out of nowhere and essentially offer no real point other than a less than average death sequence. As I said before, the idea behind the movie sounded promising, a vacationing faimly gets stranded near a small town where all the children seem to be under the influence of a dark power,leading all the adults to react frantically to outsiders and the law. I like the whole idea about a town going all evil and murderous, but the pacing and confusing and long sequences really ruined the experience for me. There are some scenes that seem to just drag on and on. Like this pointless dream sequence that seemed to have no significance other than to confuse the audience. Then towards the end we get another strange and mind boggling climax that makes you scratch your head and shrug your shoulders, before you realize that you just wasted an hour and a half of your life. Overall an intresting idea that failed due to horrible directing, slow pacing ,and pointless and confusing sequences. Don't bother!",1147046400,6,1404,4.711382113821138

The purpose of this entrapment isn't cause the old folks are lonely and want somebody to talk to No! they want the children so they can take over their bodies and be young again.  Not a bad idea.

The sheriff (played by Peckinpah favorite L. Q. Jones) is getting sick and tired of being stuck in this smelly ol town so him and his posse start investigating where all the kids have disappeared to.  Will they find them before it's too late?

Very interesting story, but the direction by veteran TV director Bernard McEveety comes off kinda stale, almost like a made for TV movie.  I did get the creeps a few times (especially at the doll scene - yikes!), but I think that the lack of violence and the improper director kept THE BROTHERHOOD OF SATAN from reaching its full potential.  Still very much worth watching.

It looks like it was made yesterday, except of course for the early 70's vehicles used in it.  Brotherhood of Satan accomplishes what most horror films don't -- truly spooky atmospherics that creep into most of the moments of tension building.  The cult itself is humorous with ""I have nothing which isn't thine"" over and over, but the unintended humor only adds to the enjoyment of the film.  The DVD is a bit pricey but worth it for the movie itself which is beautifully photographed.

7965300,4,B0000694WG,"I vividly remember the first time I saw this hidden gem.  This movie was at the height of its obscurity in the early '90s, when a friend and I rented the VHS tape (along with a fifth of whiskey) for some amusement on a random autumn night. I've always loved long lost, forgotten old movies with a dark edge. Back then, there was no internetz, and no easily obtainable reviews for rare movies like this, so you had to judge if unknown movies  would be good or not mostly based on the cover art and description on the back, and of course if you saw any familiar names. By the time we'd gotten around to watching it, we were already tired and didn't make it through to the end, although I woke up just in time to witness the bizarre psychedelic dream of Nicky (girlfriend of the protagonist), which I had been semi-dreaming about myself while drifting in and out of sleep LOL.  The dream sequence was clearly influenced by Rosemary's Baby.  I also fell asleep again right before the awesome twist ending, and was completely at a loss for what had happened when I saw the final scene.  It's a very clever and memorable downbeat ending which makes the movie, so I'm not going to describe it here (get your copy!).  We rewound it far enough to understand the ending, and both agreed this movie should have been much more well known than it is.  A typical ""all is well now"" happy ending would have ruined it.

The ultimate goal of the witches is the most diabolical thing I've ever heard.  And the fact that seemingly ordinary locals had bought into the coven made it that much creepier. They look and sound like your grandparents, but they aren't like your grandparents!! Another thing that struck me upon recent viewings is how child-like the child actors were back then.  These were real kids. They were genuinely innocent, unlike the jaded multi-millionaire child stars of today, who have often already been exposed to the worst of the world at an early age. The world was also losing its innocence back then, with the beginning of the decline of traditional values, and opening up to much darker territory. Satanism and the occult were of extreme interest in movies, books and the more underground types of music in the '70s through the mid to late '80s before fading away.  People were really questioning many things that they had formerly taken for granted, and although few had a genuine interest in practicing Satanism, there was an overwhelming morbid curiosity about the whole concept.  Jimmy Page is a good example of that.  It wouldn't be possible to make this movie as effectively today, since that real societal change already happened long ago, although I wish they would have had a somewhat larger budget back then---but not TOO much!! Also, today you wouldn't have the great performance of Strother Martin, who made the movie.  Love the innocent yet creepy choral music, too!  With some extra help, this could have been a top tier '70s classic mentioned alongside such titles as The Omen, The Exorcist, etc.  The potential for the storyline is that strong.....",1477785600,,3071,4.690875232774674
