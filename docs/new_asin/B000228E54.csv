8020339,5,B000228E54,"An older Nature program, with a great overview of the cow!  The section on how religious beliefs and the practical uses of cows converge to create the sacred cow in India are a great teaching tool in my Sociology of Food seminar.",1457136000,,229,4.4523809523809526

8020343,4,B000228E54,"Very interesting if you have an interest in agriculture or how people, around the world, view cattle. Good for a classroom from 5th grade to HS.",1377475200,,144,4.576923076923077
8020344,5,B000228E54,"My husband and I saw this on TV and watched it sort of as a joke -- but we were both hooked and ended up watching the whole show. Now I'm buying the DVD to have a copy to share with friends (and their kids). I will never look at a cow in the same way now!  Includes a good explanation of how cows are part of human cultures around the world (and why), and how our ways of interacting with cows (dairy cows and cattle) has changed so radically over the past two generations (and how it might well change back, at least partially). You won't believe how interesting a show about our bovine buddies can be!  GREAT for homeschool groups, too (that's why I'm buying it).",1187740800,,665,4.1875
