8200703,5,B000RH1CM6,"This is a good mid-level senior workout.  What I mean by that is this:  It is a level ABOVE those workouts that have you sitting in a chair and waving your arms & legs around.  (I own a few of those, and they're ok for days that my arthritis is acting up).  This video is a level above that, however, it is not an INTENSE cardio workout.  Sadly, the description is vague, so allow me to fill in some of the blanks.  In order to do the entire 45 minute workout, you will need: (1) A sturdy chair with arms, such as that which you might have  in your dining room or kitchen.  It is important that the chair have arms because there are two or three exercises that cannot be done without the arms.  In one exercise, you sit in the chair and raise and lower yourself while holding on to the chair's arms. (2) a mat, such as a yoga mat, because there is a short ""floor"" segment at the end.
The instructor is encouraging and pleasant to listen to and work with.  No annoying music in the background.  I'm happy with my purchase.",1463788800,,1021,4.158163265306122

8200706,5,B000RH1CM6,"Being a Senior kayaker I suffer from various ailments, the least being sore muscles (and failing eyesight).  I find that when my wife & I go kayaking every inch of body aches even BEFORE we start!  This video is a welcome addition to my collection since it provides excellent stretching techniques.  Although some of the moves are difficult at my age (definitely over 40!), with my wife's assistance I manage to eek them out. If you kayak or fish or participate in any other outdoor activity and need that little extra UMPH! this is the video for you.",980640000,2,551,4.6020408163265305
