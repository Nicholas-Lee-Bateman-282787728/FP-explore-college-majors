7997316,5,B0000AINLV,Got this item for my wife and she and all five of my daughters LOVE it!  They had a 'Chick Flick' marathon and absolutely had a ball with all the movies!  I highly recommend The Ultimate Chick Flick collection to all!,1356307200,,217,4.2682926829268295
7997317,4,B0000AINLV,"I don't actually own the box set, but i know enough about the movies. Combined, they do make a semi good set, but i imagine it would be hard to find someone who doesn't own a single one of these movies already, so i kinda find the box set useless unless theres more to it then they reveal.
'The Banger Sisters' 2 out of 5 stars - I saw it, it was okay, but i don't really want to see it again so i wouldn't buy it. It is one of the 2 movies in this set that i DON'T own, and it would stop me from buying this set. I think A Walk In The Clouds would have been a much better 6th disc.
'Ever After' 5/5 - I love this movie, it's sweet, romantic and takes a good take on a classic. It's great acting, it sticks to Cinderella in many ways, but makes it more interesting then most versions. (including the Disney animated version which i also love)
'Moulin Rouge' 5/5 - My second fav movie of all time. It's great, it's unique in many many ways, and it's just all around brillant. The only problem here is that the box set says it's 6 disc, so i'm asuming that it is not the special edition of Moulin Rouge, which if you are a fan of the movie is worth the extra money.
'Say Anything' 5/5 - Classic love story, possibly one of the best romantic comedy high school flick ever. And the DVD is jammed pack full of enough extras that it almost makes up for the single disk version of Moulin Rouge for most people (not including me)
'Someone Like You' 5/5 - This one is pretty good, it's cute, it's funny, and the way it's told is great. Ashley Judd is brillant in it, and Hugh Jackman is so cute. And the ending is way better then the ending to the book (Animal Husbandry by Laura Zigman) tho the book is really good.
'Where The Heart is' 4/5 - I don't have this one DVD yet, but it is on my list, and i do own the VHS tape. It's cute, a lil slow at parts tho. (Just a update, i do own it on DVD now)
Anyhow, if i didn't own 4 out of the 6 already, with #5 on my list to buy, i still wouldn't buy this based on the above stated about The Banger Sisters and Moulin Rouge. But it is a fairly well put together box set that would be a good present or a gift to ones self.",1069200000,13,2158,3.9068181818181817
