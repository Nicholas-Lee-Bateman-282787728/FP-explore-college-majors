2828670,5,B000PY52E0,"This DVD set is perfect for a Chiefs fan! I had seen other teams get their history made into this type of set and I hoped eventually they would do the same for the Chiefs. NFL films has done a great job of using old footage from the AFL back to the Dallas Texans days all the way up to the 1st Herm Edwards year. The interviews are very insightful and the quality lives up to the excellence we have come to expect from NFL Films.

The years between 1977 and 1989 are not dwelled upon nor should they, due to the fact that the Chiefs were not a good team except for 1986 and no Chiefs fan would want to relive it. They do mention in the ""Ring of Honor"" bonus material the outstanding players from that era (Bill Kenney, Joe Delaney, Stephoine Paige, Christian Okoye, Carlos Carson, Lloyd Burruss, etc.) In response to an earlier review, they don't say it was all those years until they got back to the playoffs, they say it was that long till they got back to the AFC Championship game. Why dwell on the years that were wasted by poor management and drafts? The purpose of a package like this is to make you feel good about your team.

There is wonderful footage from old Municipal Stadium all the way up to the most recent training camps. I have been a Chiefs fan my whole life as my parents moved us to the KC area in 1963, the same year that the Chiefs moved from Dallas. I could not be more pleased with a product and I could not recommend a product more! If you are a true Chiefs fan, you will watch this DVD over & over again.",1189036800,2,1531,4.151515151515151
2828671,3,B000PY52E0,"For the most part, this Chiefs history isn't bad.  But, it's NOT COMPLETE.  NFL films as chosen the COMPLETLY ignore KC Chiefs history from 1975 to 1988.  What?  How can a COMPLETE history NOT include those years?  In the 1980's the Chiefs had players such as Bill Maas DL, Bill Kenney QB, Todd Blackledge (QB class of '83), Deron Cherry FS, Carlos Carson WR, Stephone Page WR, Nick Lowery K, Art Still DE, Keven Ross CB and many others.  How could NFL films COMPLETLY ignore these fine players?  I guess a COMPLETE history is only COMPLETE if the team is winning.

Here's an example of how NFL films COMPLETELY skips over the late 70's and 80's Chiefs.  Their narrator claims that from 1975, ""It would be 18 years before they won another division title, or had a shot at a Super Bowl"".  That isn't COMPLETLY correct.  What about the 1986 KC Chiefs squad NFL films?  They went 10-6 and made it to the Playoffs on the strength of their special teams and defense while displaying a tremendous amount of guts and determination.  But I guess because they lost the Wild Card playoff game to the NY Jets 35-15, that doesn't count as Chiefs history.

I've added the 1986 Game of the Week, Week 16 between the Chiefs and the Steelers to my KC Chiefs history.  It's the last GOTW to feature Harry Kalas, and it shows highlights of their 24 - 19 victory (all points coming on Special Teams, classic) which clinched a playoff spot for them.  I picked up a copy at the NFL films web site, and upgraded my DVD case of the Chiefs History to include this.  Now my History of the Chiefs is Complete...",1186790400,21,1585,4.447916666666667
2828672,5,B000PY52E0,"Really good buy! Covers a lot of history and has some good highlights, loved the Marty ball era, that guy deserves a trophy, he knows our pain! Lol",1390867200,,147,4.285714285714286
2828673,5,B000PY52E0,"Chief fans will really enjoy this DVD, which covers their long history going back to the time when they started off as the Dallas Texans in 1960.  There is, of course, a big focus on the 1960-74 era of coach Hank Stram, which included five years of playoff appearances, three AFL Championships, and a Super Bowl Championship in January 1970.  It is a joy to experience the highlights of those great teams.  People who have watched the ""America's Game"" DVD on the Chiefs' 1969 World Championship season will notice that for the period of the late 1960s, it contains some of the same commentary from quarterback Len Dawson and linebackers Willie Lanier and Jim Lynch.  Although the 1971 double overtime loss to Miami in the 1971 playoffs was a heartbreak, it is still a passionate event for Chiefs fans because so many Chiefs played heroically.  People dream of what might have been for that team, recognized as truly great in this DVD.

The remainder focuses on the Marty Schottenheimer and Dick Vermeil eras. Under Schottenheimer, the Chiefs returned to winning in earnest in 1990, helped by general manager Carl Peterson and new stars such as Derrick Thomas.  There is an interesting special focus on Joe Montana's two years with the Chiefs (1993-94), but for whatever reason they show only the playoff victories but not the eventual losses.  As for the exchange in previous comments on this board concerning the absence of material from 1975 to 1988, I will take the position that something more should have been included.  Marv Levy returned the Chiefs to respectability in his second year, and John Mackovic did manage to get them into the playoffs in 1986.

The lengthy extras of Disk 1 are just as good if not better than the regular program.  The separate ""Ring of Honor"" sections for both offense and defense cover the great players of all eras very thoroughly, including 1975-1988, with loads of great clips.  Plus, this is truly a ""wired for sound"" DVD for the coaches.  Stram became the progenitor of this concept when he agreed to be wired in Super Bowl IV.  Ed Sabol of NFL Films knew that Stram's colorful personality would produce an entertaining result.  The Disk 1 extras contain five sections for ""wired"" comments in many contexts for all the coaches, and Disk 2 continues with separate profiles on Schottenheimer and Vermeil titled ""In Their Own Words.""

Go Chiefs!  This is a 5-star DVD for both scope (and 345 minutes length) and quality.  Highly recommended.",1373673600,,2480,4.850356294536817
2828674,5,B000PY52E0,I have to say it made me cry this is a wonderful vidieo im so pleased with it and i miss D.T.,1362355200,,93,3.272727272727273

2828678,5,B000PY52E0,"This video is a must have for any Chiefs fan as it covers the first days of the Chiefs through the Dick Vermeil era.  I saw the local Walmart playing the video on their display TVs and needed one for myself.  If you've been a Chiefs fan since the beginning like I was (ever heard of the Chiefs Huddle Club?), you will find this video packed with many great memories and ""oh yeah"" moments.",1326931200,,388,4.22972972972973
2828679,5,B000PY52E0,"For a Chiefs fan, or even just a football fan, this is well worth the few dollars it costs.  If you buy it, don't ignore the bonus material which is also very good.  Features on Joe Delaney and Christian Okoye acknowledge players from the eras not covered in the incomplete history.

Contains Hank Stram ""Wired for Sound"", a feature on Tony Gonzalez, and a good one about ""Big Charlie's,"" a Chiefs' fan bar in south Philadelphia, plus several others.

The only problem with any of the material is that the sound tracks contain too much of the standard NFL Films marches and faux Peter Gunn music.",1297555200,,596,4.59433962264151
2828680,5,B000PY52E0,"Having played for the Texans/Chiefs eight years 60-67, it was not only a nostalgic video review but one that captured the era.  Very well done!  Chris Burford",1284854400,8,158,4.814814814814815
2828681,5,B000PY52E0,"I'm a huge Chiefs fan, and this helped get me caught up on their long and storied history.

I've seen other reviews that say it's not complete because it doesn't mention the Todd Blacklidge Era.
Statistically speaking, Blacklidge was the single worst Chiefs QB to ever play.
They didn't cover that period because the Chiefs lost a lot and had pretty much no highlights in that period.
It isn't, however, unmentioned, they spend about 14 seconds saying ""The Chiefs struggled from the late 70's until the late 80's.""

The history this DVD spans if from the beginning as the Dallas Texans up until the 2006 NFL season (which was a good place to stop- that was the last time the Chiefs had a winning season).",1282176000,,704,4.624

8193797,5,B000PY52E0,"Back in June I put a halt to all review writing on this account, retiring the account altogether.  One more for the road...

Chiefs - The Complete History is a two-DVD set that explores the history of this franchise that has its roots in the AFL and won Super Bowl IV over the Minnesota Vikings in 1970.  Many bonus features are included, such as Chiefs Hall-Of-Famers, the coaches, star defensive and offensive players over the years, the 1969 Chiefs Highlights Film, plus many more features and in-depth profiles on individual players and coaches.  This is a very entertaining set that is just as good as the three other complete history DVDs I have (Raiders, Jets, and Browns).  I figured I'd briefly un-retire this account and write a review of this set as well.  Overall, I highly recommend this set.

On behalf of all parties involved over the years, I have the honor of once again retiring this account, just as I did in June.  RE-retiring this account.  So long...........AMAZON.",1506643200,,987,4.792899408284024
