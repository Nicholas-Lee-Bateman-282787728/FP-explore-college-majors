8237776,4,B0010DCWKM,"I love this series.  The music is great and the images are fun.  My 20 month old loves this movie.  I, myself, think it's a little too repetitive to be enjoyed by the adults in the room -- but I am not the target audience!",1416873600,,222,3.888888888888889
8237777,5,B0010DCWKM,"My toddler absolutely loves all of the Brainy Baby IQ DVD series. Although there are not any words being spoken, the classical music and high quality images are great. The Baby IQ series encourages my toddler son to talk more. He says a lot of words when he's watching like colors, numbers, shapes, or just plain words. I also talk about on screen images when watching the DVD too. The DVDs encourages curiosity from my son and he's constantly asking ""What is that?"" while watching. Often times he's giggling and pointing to the TV while entranced with this DVD. This is such a great educational buy and I wish that I'd found it during his infancy. Excellent buy and I highly recommend this to those who have babies and toddlers!",1358121600,,729,4.615384615384615

8237779,5,B0010DCWKM,"My 4 and 1/2 month old daughter, has become completely captivated by these DVDs. She has been listening to classical music for some time now. We even purchased the belly audio system, when she was in the womb. Over the past weeks, she does not wake up crying. It took about 2 or 3 weeks of rotation, now she is hooked, while rocking in her Zen swing or jumperoo. We rotate between calling out the colors, but it seems she much calmer now and is just taking it all in.",1311724800,,467,4.2
