8528693,1,B008KM5LAY,"My young daughter loves this show and was disappointed when it was canceled by Netflix. Both she and I were delighted to find it on DVD and then very disappointed when the DVD arrived in California and would not play. We thought it was defective and returned it to the seller. We were only credited the purchase price (not shipping) and told that the disc was not defective. It is apparently coded to only work in ""Region 2"" --- i.e. Europe. The description NOW states that in small print, however, it did NOT at the time of purchase. Even with the updated description, it is still not clear. The item title needs to be updated to include ""Region 2"" or ""European"" DVD. Obviously I am not the only one who has had this problem. I believe it is bad business for OxfordshireEngland to ship this DVD to a region where they know it will not play. I am now out both the original shipping and my return shipping fees and my daughter is very disappointed. Worst Amazon purchase ever!",1400457600,,975,4.4525139664804465
