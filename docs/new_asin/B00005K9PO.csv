1616231,3,B00005K9PO,This is only the second Yoga Zone video I've tried and I really didn't like it.  I'm fairly new to yoga and I take a class once a week.  This video was almost too easy for me.  I am fairly flexible but I felt as if I didn't get anything out of this video.  There were a few poses that I'll probably incorporate in my weekly routine but that's about it.,1058313600,10,352,3.915492957746479
1616232,4,B00005K9PO,I had a back ache when I first played the dvd.  I did the first session and wow I felt a lot better.  I would recomend for any one who sufferce from back problems.,1056499200,13,163,3.764705882352941
1616233,5,B00005K9PO,"I've had this DVD for a really long time, but I just tried it for the first time today. To my surprise, the workout was challenging yet relaxing at the same time. The instructors were really thorough and informative about stretching, breathing, positions, etc. I especially like how they used the mirror approach, which is where the viewer can just easily mirror the person's movement (or what seems to be the movement they want from us) on the screen.
The scenery was also great. It was pretty dim in my room and just watching them on the beaches of Jamaica made me feel as if I was there. I know it sounds corny, but I felt as if they were personally teaching ME how to do yoga. In a sense they were, but yeah, this Yoga workout rules! Forty minutes, baby!",1044662400,18,758,4.382978723404255
1616234,5,B00005K9PO,"I bought this video after suffering from chronic back pain due to an injury. The movements are well explained and fairly easy to perform. In fact, I couldn't imagine I was really working my back. The next day, though, my pain was gone.

1616271,2,B00005K9PO,I wanted to like this video...it was recommended to me by a friend. The first portion of the video with two female instructors was fine...a bit stiff but the second section with Douglas as instructor was so annoying I could hardly stand it!!! He speaks in a whiny voice and tells Suzanne - That's Niiiiiiice and That's beautiful Suzanne too many times. It honestly ruined the entire video for me - I will NOT recommend this video to anyone...I also bought the Yoga Zone Ultimate set which i have not tried yet but really hope that Douglas is not a part of those videos!,1317772800,,569,4.480769230769231
1616272,5,B00005K9PO,"I have had this tape for a number of years now. Because of my herniated disc I am pain most of the time and this tape really opens up the back and makes me able to function in a normal manner. Douglas, the instructor explains each move in a simple manner, yet always gets his point across...definitely a 5 star tape.",1316908800,3,316,4.19672131147541
1616273,5,B00005K9PO,"I have a very bad upper back and neck, and most routines for the back include too many strength moves. I can't do them on a regular basis or the flare-ups are horrible. These two routines do strengthen, but the emphasis is on stretching. It helps my back tremendously. Thank you, Yoga Zone! I can finally get the blood flowing in those joints without much pain on a regular basis.",1316390400,4,380,4.442857142857143
1616274,4,B00005K9PO,"Yoga Zone Yoga for a Strong and Healthy Back contains two programs that could easily be done one right after the other for a longer workout. The instructions are calm, clear and understandable, but the instructors keep talking directly to the other person on the DVD. I found this distracting. I prefer DVDs where the instructor talks directly to the person watching the DVD, the audience, per se. The instructors demonstate and illustrate the poses very well making it easy to follow along. The workouts themselves are appropriate for beginners and perhaps those progressing from beginner level to intermediate. I consider myself intermediate and find the workouts a little too easy. The DVD is excellent for its purpose, focusing on the back. It lengthens, relaxes, and stengthens the back muscles.",1313712000,2,800,5.161538461538462
1616275,5,B00005K9PO,"I own the entire set, and I enjoy all of them. This one is my favorite.  I like the way they show modifications to make the stretches more comfortable for older less flexible individuals.  Great pill free stress reliever!",1306108800,2,221,4.641025641025641
1616286,5,B00005K9PO,"Of the 8 Yoga Zone DVDs I own, the Back one is my favorite. With bad knees (5 surgeries) and 3 herniated cervical discs (I am 53), the back session has helped me tremendously; it has helped me loosen up my hips and strengthen my back. I use it before lifting weights or riding my bike. I have not had to go to the chiropractor in over 2 years since using Yoga Zone. I cannot do complicated positions because of my injuries (it took me a long time searching for DVDs I could actually use), so Yoga Zone has been perfect for me. Now my son and daughter use them (they also have bad backs).",1295654400,5,587,4.113043478260869
1616287,5,B00005K9PO,I'm new to yoga but have found that these stretches really help to loosen the tightness in my back. It doesn't feel like you are doing anything strenuous while doing the exercises but the next day I feel like I am looser and have more energy. I'm glad I bought it and the short sessions are not too hard to work into a busy schedule.,1272067200,2,333,4.138461538461539
1616288,5,B00005K9PO,"I have this DVD for couple of years now.  Once I got the routine, however, I put it in back of my collection and forgot about it.  One day, while bending down to pick up a basket at the grocery store, I felt a sharp pain in my lower back.  It was so painful that even a drive home was a torture.  The next day, I took out this DVD and started the exercise again.  In the beginning, every movement was stiff and painful.  Gradually, in the space of couple of days, my back pain was gone.  I now incorporate this Yoga program into my regular routine as a warm-up.  It is easy and incorporates a lot of gentle bending and twisting.  This DVD is broken into two parts.  If you do the whole thing, it'll take 36 minutes from beginning to end.  Great exercise for your spine and lower back!",1270857600,3,784,4.125827814569536
1616289,3,B00005K9PO,"I couldn't get through five minutes of the DVD, though I will give it another chance.  My initial impression was that it was horribly cheesy, and then when it brought you to the main DVD menu, it only had begin work-out.  You couldn't choose to only do a shorter workout if you wanted--it would just play the full 40 minute DVD.
Also, if it's focusing on back pain, I would like to start off slow, maybe on the floor, before I get into the standing postures.
However, it was filmed in a nice, setting as opposed to other DVDs with a simple, white background and a mat.  Also, even though cheesy, the instructors seemed nice and competent.",1266624000,,638,4.435897435897436
1616290,1,B00005K9PO,"I am disappointed with this DVD.  I have other Yoga Zone DVD which you can really use to exercise and get benefit from it, but this one will just show you yoga poses and then you're on your own.  Don't expect to sweat on this one.",1238889600,2,230,3.9782608695652173
1616291,5,B00005K9PO,"I suffer from chronic pain in my upper back and someone suggested I should try yoga. Our local library had this DVD so I checked it to give it a try. Well, after the first time doing the two short sessions on this DVD my back pain was completely gone. Now I can get out of bed in the morning with no stiffness and my back is completely free of pain. The yoga positions are pretty basic, probable beginner level positions but never the less they are effective for getting the kinks out and helping to relax the muscles. The setting as one reviewer already mentioned is beautiful. Both instructors are very effective at describing each of the poses in their routines.",1228694400,2,665,4.459016393442623
1616292,5,B00005K9PO,"The short and quick version --

PROS

1. Always releases tension, stress and pain in the back ( at least for me).

2. Lots of cues and reminders to breath, and good visualizations and explanation techniques that really help put you in the correct form.

3. Two short sessions of 20 minutes each makes it easy to fit into a regular work out schedule.  Could be a good 'stretch' for after aerobic work outs.

4. The instructors are not overly perky, nor pushy on the spiritual aspect that some yoga tapes offer.

CONS -

1.  Pretty simple poses; not much challenge or room to grow if you are at anything more than beginners status.

2. For some, frequent cues could be annoying. Such as those with more yoga experience.

3. DVD itself is short overall compared to most yoga dvds.  Which could be a downside for some.  But for the price tag, I still think its worth it.

My longer review with a little more detail-

I first took a yoga class to fulfill a required health course credit in college.  I enjoyed it so much that I have dabbled in it for years  Never as steady as I would like, but some classes here and there, and several videos.

I have always had some back issues.  I have horrible posture, and slight scoliosis.  This often leads to back pain.  Yoga had always helped somewhat, but I wondered if there was specific DVDs for the back, like there were for arms and abs and such. I found the Yoga Zone Yoga for a Strong and Healthy Back DVD.

When I first tried the DVD out, I was a bit disappointed.  It seemed like there wasn't a lot of variety, and I had hoped for more poses, and it didn't seem at all challenging.  However, I noticed that whenever I was having back pain - usually after killing it with some pilates or aerobics and not keeping correct form - that doing this video always eased the pain.  That in itself is enough to make me love this video.

I also like the frequent cue-ing on the breathing.  When I have stepped away from Yoga for awhile, its nice to have frequent cues to remind me to breath.  I also like the two 20 minute sessions which allows me to fit it into my workout schedule much easier considering I have two young kids at home. I also really like to do one session after an aerobics work out to stretch my back and other muscles.

 Although, those frequent cues and the short sessions could be cons for those who are well into yoga at this point. Maybe another 20 minute session with more focus on strength of the back would have been nice.

I would actually probably be more likely to rate this 4.5 stars than 5, but 4.5 isn't and option, so I went with the five considering what a wonderful effect it has on my back pain and the great job that is done with cues and explanations.

All in all, if you have back pain, its worth it to try this out!",1219363200,4,2792,4.259047619047619
1616293,5,B00005K9PO,"Excellent!  I have been suffering for over eight years with a back that has almost left me disabled.

I bought this dvd with high doubts. I mean, I've been seeing docters and chircopractors for such a long time with such puny results.. what could this do for me, right???

I started doing it only a couple of times a week, and now I'm up to three times a week.  I had never done yoga before in my life, but I definately see results.  I feel as though my back is getting stronger and I am feeling better.  Not overnight, of course... but I'm getting there.

I would definately recommend this dvd to anyone who has just about given up!",1207440000,3,633,4.26890756302521
1616294,3,B00005K9PO,"This video and instructions are good but it is way too short, 20 minutes.  I like the fact that one can choose to listen to the music without the verbal instructions.",1207353600,2,166,4.354838709677419
1616295,5,B00005K9PO,"My back feels always amazing after this DVD, no matter what I've done to it that day (running, weights, driving to work, etc.)  This poses are simple and easy for this beginner and they feel very good.  I've started doing this every night as a stretching routine and I've been waking up in the mornings without the back/abs pain I used to have after only doing the DVD 4-5x/week for the past 4 weeks or so.

The DVD is divided into two sections, both with various twists, stretches and lengthening poses.  The first section features more in the way of twists while the second more lengthening and even a few breathes of boat pose thrown in to strengthen the abs.

The DVD is filmed in Jamaica on the grounds of the Grand Lido Sans Souci and on the beach.  The music is subtle with a little bit of a reggae feel to it.  I am ready to book my flight and spend all day doing yoga.

As, Douglas, one of the instructors in the DVD would say, ""that's niiice"" and so is this DVD.",1203465600,4,972,4.244565217391305
1616311,4,B00005K9PO,"Only had two basic classes in yoga. Found this fairly easy to follow.
Purchased this because of bulging disc. Better purchased before injury.",1203206400,,141,5.173913043478261
1616312,3,B00005K9PO,"I'm really flexible and my chiropractor suggested doing exercises to build up my back muscles specifically. I've been practicing yoga off and on for the last 5 years and was not challenged by this video. The instruction is great, and it's a great warm-down for me, but it's very beginner level. This would make a great first buy if you're looking to start yoga. It would probably be a great DVD for someone who may be a bit overweight but still able to move around. There are no super difficult poses if you can do a kneeling lunge without toppling over. BONUS: there is an index of poses on the DVD. Great for beginners to learn the names and postures of various poses.",1202860800,4,670,4.455284552845528
1616313,2,B00005K9PO,Misleading title...If you suffer low back pain and need help strengthening those muscles this is NOT the dvd for you. If you have problems rotating at the mid back or suffer muscle spasms in the lat area this will cause problems as it did for me. If you want an upper/mid back mild stretch then by all means buy it because it is definately good for that. If you need to gain strength in the core to aleviate low back pain NOT due to injury but due to inactivity then I would suggest Back In Action Total Fitness For Your Core by Jon Mello. This will give you the exercise foundation you need.,1186185600,12,592,4.247787610619469
1616314,3,B00005K9PO,"I have a L5 herniation in my back along with desiccation of the disc. Needless to say I was looking for some relief after continual ""back attacks"". I got myself an inversion table an after 1 month about 80% of the pain was gone. Looking for the final 20% eventually led me to Yoga.

Reading the reviews on Yoga Zone convinced me that this was the best instruction video for lower back pain. Never having done Yoga I was a bit nervous after reading about the difficulty and soreness that many were experiencing.

To my surprise, I found this not to be the case. In fact, I believe the exercises are a bit too easy and don't target the back as much as I had hoped. In my experience exercises such as the ""Superman"" pose and other stretches seem to do a better job for me. Having said that, perhaps your experience will be different as every back ailment IS different.

The video itself is topshelf in terms of production values; with gorgeous scenery and pleasant instructors. More importantly it focuses on the task at hand and spares us New Age hokum.",1176076800,9,1051,4.463541666666667
1616315,5,B00005K9PO,"After too many strenuous days of skiing, I got hit by lower back spasms, which shocked me because I thought I was in fairly good shape.  I go to the gym and work with weights, I ski in winter, bike in summer.  I do frequent stretch routines.  So my sudden back problem threw me for a loop!  My chriopractor helped, and as it turned out, he's very into Yoga and suggested some yoga poses which helped a lot.  This led me to search for yoga DVD's that are back specific and I figured at this point in my life (I'm 57), Yoga might be a good addition to the mix of exercise.  Since there weren't many back specific DVDs, I got this one and found that I like it a lot.  The two sessions are only 20 min. each, which allows me to sneak in a session here and there whereas a longer, more involved program would be less easy to make routine.  None of the exercises were extreme for a beginner, and were done with 2 people, one of which would often point out things and modifications on the other one as the pose was being done.  Directions were easy and clear....after watching this a couple of times I think you would then remember and be able to follow directions without keeping an eye on the TV constantly.  After the pose was explained, comments on how you could modify the pose to be easier were given.  Douglas, on the 2nd session, has a very clear, calming voice and his explanations and comments were very good and to the point, very useful and clarifying.

The Jamaica ocean beach setting on the 2nd session was especially wonderful, and I could almost imagine myself there doing yoga on the beach as well.  I found the whole DVD was low key and quite relaxing.  Oddly, I don't recall a thing about the music...so I'd say at least it wasn't distracting.  Maybe I was enjoying the beach scene too much to notice the music.

The key with this or any other such DVD is to be regular with it and give it a chance to work.  And if you are new to Yoga, follow the instructor comments about how to do the various poses.  As I said, none of them are anything that requires expertise or a high level of fitness or yoga experience, but that certainly doesn't mean they don't have an effect.  The harder ones can easily be modified in the beginning as necessary.

One thing many people complain about is that yoga DVDs are often slow and boring.  I used to think that too, but now I'm finding this slow pace quite relaxing and enjoyable.  I plan to take a little trip to the Jamaica beach and do this DVD every day and I'll report back about how successful it is in rehabbing my back.  So far so good.",1173571200,12,2592,4.266393442622951
1616316,5,B00005K9PO,"This dvd is great for someone who doesnt have 1 full hour to do yoga, it has two 15 minute sessions and since I have been doing it, my back pain has been greatly relieved! Easy to do poses and great for someone with chronic back pain.",1172016000,6,234,4.0
1616317,4,B00005K9PO,"The pace and poses are good with a level of effort ranging from beginner to intermediate.  However, the DVD is short on content.  There are only two sessions (about 20min each) and there should be at least four.  Unfortunately, there seems to be no other DVDs targeting the lower back, so by default, this is the best shot.",1171843200,2,323,4.5344827586206895
1616318,3,B00005K9PO,"As someone who has been doing yoga for about a year and a half, I am an advanced beginner.  I also have had chronic back problems my whole life.  I felt I should write a review of this DVD because it was surprisingly challenging to me.

Other reviewers have written to ""take it easy"" with this DVD.  I would also caution that.  But I would go even further: if you are NOT young and in good shape, this may not be the best yoga practice for your ""bad back"".

I think it also moves a bit too quickly for those who have back backs.  I have hurt myself repeatedly in yoga, even though I am quite flexible, when poses move quickly.  Having enough time to really be in touch with ones' body, I think, is essential when one is dealing with a pain issue.

This DVD is well presented and because of that I give it 3 stars.  If it was NOT billed as ""Yoga for a Strong and Healthy Back"" I may have given it 5 stars.  But I think that it's title is a bit of a misnomer.

If you are young and in good shape, I think it will help prevent back problems, but if you are dealing already with back problems and don't already have a strong yoga practice, I'd stay away from it.

Again, as I've written in other reviews, my opinion, is highly subjective (and the same goes for all reviewers).",1171584000,28,1272,4.101214574898785

Fortunately I purchased Healing Yoga For Aches & Pains and that Yoga DVD is working much better for me. I find it's much easier and so much more comfortable to do the positions in the Healing Yoga than in the Yoga For A Strong & Healthy Back. However, I do feel that if it weren't for my chronic health problems using this DVD would be very beneficial. The moves aren't ""pretzel"" moves and I've convinced my sister to give it a try.

I have no previous experience with yoga.  I have one slightly compressed disk in my low back.  When physical therapy didn't help enough with the pain, my doctor suggested yoga.  I began watching Yoga Zone on TV and found significant improvement, so I bought the Healthy Back DVD.  I'm quite happy with it.  I still do my physical therapy exercises, I still have some pain, but I am back to martial arts training 4 times a week.  I plan to purchase more of Yoga Zone's DVDs.  I found the exercises very easy to follow. By the 3rd time, I didn't have to keep stopping to watch the demonstrators.

One note on the DVD - it's not really indexed.  To get back & forth between the 2 sessions, just hit the next/prev buttons a few times.

I saw one reviewer didn't like the 2nd teacher, Douglas.  He does say ""nice"" a lot, but I thought it was kind of cute/quirky.  Don't know what else might have been troubling.",1154217600,7,1052,4.457894736842105

This is my first time doing yoga. I'm 52 and admittedly out of shape. Almost all the exercises were easy for me to do as long as I followed the instructors' admonition not to strain.

1616349,4,B00005K9PO,"If you have ever had back pain, check with your doctor before using Yoga for a Strong and Healthy Back.

The instructor presents the basics of postures and yoga breathing with no nonsense, and no jargon. Using this program takes about 20-minutes of workout time per day.

The instructor focuses on the lower back, often neglected in general exercise videos. There is also plenty of work for the upper back, too. Viewers learn poses that utilize the lower back, such as the warrior pose.

The video contains two complete, 20-minute workouts, one for beginners -- featuring Jennifer and Jeanne -- and one for survivors of the first -- featuring Douglas and Suzanne. The second workout contains more advanced poses, and stretches that keep your back supple and happy.

Have your doctor review both workouts if he or she is unfamiliar with them. Users of either level can improve back flexibility without getting frustrated with impossible poses.

The video was made in Jamaica, known for its beautiful, white-sand beaches and breathtaking scenery. The Grand Lido Sans Souci Resort in Ochos Rios hosted the taping of the original video.

The video features original music which greatly enhances the experience, it is an easy-to-listen-to sound that seems to move between Salsa and Reggae.

All Yoga Zone videos are created with guidance from Yoga Master Alan Finger, founder of The Yoga Zone in Manhattan in 1992. A second generation Yoga Master, Alan has practiced yoga for over 35 years. After opening up modest yoga studios in the New York metropolitan area, The Yoga Zone became well-known, and opened a studio in Old Brookville, on Long Island, New York, which accepts students for private lessons. Interested viewers can learn more about The Yoga Zone at [...] Information about The Yoga Zone on TV is also available there.

Aside from the general benefits of yoga -- relaxation and refreshment -- this video can help keep your back flexible, strong and healthy.

The DVD is probably a better value than the tape, since one need not rewind or fast forward with the DVD.",1142035200,8,2071,4.96242774566474
1616350,5,B00005K9PO,"I herniated a disk in my back last year and was told by my doctor that I would need surgery.  I was determined to go the less-invasive route and used chiropractic, acupuncture, physical therapy and the yoga on this DVD.  I did a complete turn-around, after having been bed-ridden for 2 months.  Now, whenever I start feeling that warning tightness in my back, I know I need to step up my use of this video.  I just recently had a little bit of a set-back but, doing this video twice was enough to loosen the spasming muscles in my back.  Afterwards, I applied moist heat and the improvement was enormous.  When I do this video on a regular basis, it keeps my back moving and feeling flexible.  It's only when I lapse in my discipline that I notice that I am having problems.  True to the advice of the instructors, you must only do as much as you are able to do without hurting yourself.  I love this DVD and swear by the benefits I have received from it.",1139097600,25,955,4.290502793296089
1616361,4,B00005K9PO,"This is a great DVD for stretching your spine and back muscles in a multitude of directions, but I would not rate it highly on strengthening.  I am only basing this on my experience with other yoga DVD's and videos.  I will use this along with Wai Lana, which I have used (and absolutely loved) for years.",1138492800,,305,4.333333333333333
1616362,4,B00005K9PO,"I don't have back problems, but my back and shoulders often feel sore after long hours of sitting in front of a computer at work.  I found that the two practices on Yoga Zone's Yoga for a Strong and Healthy Back DVD provided gentle stretches which helped to both elongate and relax my spine.  Each program is billed as being 20 minutes long, although I clocked them both at closer to 18 minutes.

The first practice is led by Jennifer Monness with Jeanne assisting, and it is filmed it a grassy wooded setting.  This session focuses mainly on twisting postures, mostly performed in a standing position.  After grounding you in mountain pose, Jennifer leads you through gentle twists in chair and then a series of other twisting standing poses, including pyramid, revolved prayer twist, twisting fan pose (wide-legged forward bend), and a deeper chair twist.  After about 15 minutes, she moves to the floor for several minutes of work in bound angle (cobbler's pose), ending the practice iwht seated meditation.

The second practice is led by Douglas Stewart with Suzanne assisting; this time it's an oceanfront setting.  Although this practice includes twists as well, the focus is more on spinal undulations and extensions, with the majority of the postures being performed on the floor.  Douglas starts the practice in a seated position, performing a simple seated twist and then moving to hands and knees for cat spinal rolls.  He then moves to just a few standing postures, including down dog, twisting chair, and fan pose.  The practice returns to the floor for a sequence which includes potted palm (with spinal undulations), boat, bridge, and reclined poses; again, the practice ends with a seated meditation.

Both Jennifer and Douglas instruct well.  Although they do frequently suggest modifications, they don't offer much specific information on form or alignment; therefore, I wouldn't recommend this video for those who are brand-new to yoga.  I have been practicing yoga for several years now and consider myself to be about at an intermediate level, so I found these practices to be quite gentle.  However, my back still felt as if it got a good stretch, and those newer to yoga are likely to find this video to be a bit more of a challenge.",1135900800,14,2256,4.931216931216931

1616364,5,B00005K9PO,"The first few times you use this video you will feel sore so take it easy until your flexibility increases. I have a somewhat bad back and am in my 30s. (my weight is normal/underweight) The Yoga Zone video was easy to follow, good paced, they explained the manuvers well. The twisting and stretches are targeted to mainly your back so do not expect a full body stretch. I can't say the poses totally cured my back problem but I am much more flexible and the excercises leave me feeling great afterward. Neck/shoulder tension were also a huge problem and that has improved immensely!  I'm sticking with this one! I'm trying Yoga Zone for Stretching and Flexibility next.

UPDATE: I have been using the poses from this video and Stretching for Flexibility for 2 years and have had just amazing results! I have noticed health improvements in areas that had nothing to do with my back. Migrain headaches for instance are completely gone. Also frequent indigestion cramps are gone and just a whole list of problems have basically disappeared. These videos have been about the best thing I have spent money on! I even have my husband using a few of the poses on his lower back pain and he has quit going to the chiropractor, the yoga fixes it every time!",1121731200,18,1249,4.621621621621622
1616365,5,B00005K9PO,"Yoga Zone's ""Yoga for a Strong & Healthy Back"" is a must-have for anyone suffering from back pain (especially those yoga enthusiasts with sore backs!).

The DVD features two 20-minute workouts, each with a different set of instructors, in which you work through a number of useful stretches, twists, and poses to help make your back stronger and more flexible.  The poses are relatively simple, so more advanced yoga practitioners might not find the workouts challenging enough - but they're perfect for beginners and intermediates.  I'd even recommend this to someone who's never done yoga before - the instructors explain and demonstrate everything very succinctly, and transitions between poses are slow enough that you should be able to keep up, even if you're unfamiliar with the exercises.

As an added perk, each 20-minute workout is further divided into four separate segments, so you can easily select which exercises you'd like to perform, and even craft your own customized workout.",1117670400,16,993,5.226415094339623

I've never done yoga before and I don't consider myself to be flexible in the least (I can't even reach my toes without bending my knees) but I was more than capable of doing this workout. I find it has not only been very  benefical for my back which is often sore in the morning, it is very calming and relaxing.",1115683200,7,472,4.303370786516854

So, when I attempted it a 2nd time I did the 2nd program and loved it! Douglas leads the 2nd program and does a variety like boat and fan pose..just overall a very nice workout.

1616370,4,B00005K9PO,"I have had a bad back for the past five or six years, and nothing I've ever tried has really worked on it. I thought perhaps that ""Yoga Zone - Yoga for a Strong and Healthy Back"" could help me. I'll just say upfront that I'm not an exerciser. I sit on my butt all day at work, and while I do common household chores, I get terribly bored with workouts and so I rarely do organized routines. I also had never tried yoga, although it seemed a lot more interesting than many workout styles I have looked at.
The instructors were quite clear and the setting beautiful. My back was also hurting pretty bad that first night because I overdid it without realizing it. I cannot stress enough that unless you are some kind of yoga master you must TAKE IT EASY when you are starting on this program. No matter how easy their movements seem, just be a lot more careful than you think you need to. After I experienced that terrible soreness, I continued doing the program but was much, much more careful. Now, after a couple of weeks, my back feels overall feels better and stronger, and the after-workout soreness has lessened considerably.",1086220800,100,1129,4.458937198067633

I can't say for sure, but I think having a strong and healthy back helped with all three of my labors, which were relatively quick and problem-free.",1499644800,,479,4.274725274725275

Each segment is only 20 minutes long, so a workout easy to fit into a busy schedule, and the poses are easy to modify to suit one's flexibility.

The sequences are short and sweet, video has two sessions of about 18 minutes each, and my hubby does one a day (he usually does the second one because he like the music and thinks the blond girl Susanne is cute.. hey, you gotta find what motivates you..! ;-) ) It's so nice to see loved ones get results from something so simple.
