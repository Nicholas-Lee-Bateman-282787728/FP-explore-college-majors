8426590,5,B004EB7KJU,"these are expensive, but well worth it. i purchased these because i really like the ""Haunted"" series on History channel, but cannot be in front of the tv everytime it comes on. i am glad i made the purchase.  it sets you back, all told, about $75.00 or so depending on the set you buy.  i bought the full set.  i love these. anytime i want to see one i just pop it in and enjoy.  there are some i haven't seen as of yet, but i am sure they will be as good as the rest.",1297209600,,468,3.7938144329896906
