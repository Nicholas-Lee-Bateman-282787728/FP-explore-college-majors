4331836,5,B004DAS3AW,"Dalziel and Pascoe is a very good detective series. Dalziel, the old Yorkshire Scot, teamed with the university trained Pascoe. Great chemistry as Pascoe trails behind Dalziel, sweeping up Dalziel's politically incorrect comments and old time techniques. Well worth buying...This is buddy-buddy now. Pascoe's wife divorced Pascoe and moved to the States to simmer in the academic community.",1407715200,3,390,5.741379310344827
4331837,5,B004DAS3AW,This series just gets better and better. Very well written and the acting is wonderful. The programs keep you on the edge of your seat. I enjoy detective stories and these are top notch. This release has more minutes than some of the others over 500.,1406246400,3,250,4.456521739130435
4331838,5,B004DAS3AW,"I have been ordering and watching Dalziel&Pascoe since I ordered the season 1........I have so enjoyed watching both characters start off and grow in their roles......They also go back and forth with each other but you know they care greatly for each other as friends and partners......There episodes are all full of twist and turns and if you do not listen and pay attention you will miss something.....I have been fooled many times trying to figure them out.....I know this series will end at some point but will hate to see that!!!!!!!!!!  DL sometimes just makes you shake you head but then turns around and shows his better side, Pascoe has grown and wish he had better luck with the ladies!!!!!!!!!!!!  Try it, I feel you will enjoy this series and get where you order all that comes out !!!!!!!!!!!!",1406160000,5,806,4.75
4331839,5,B004DAS3AW,"Dalziel and Pascoe from 2006, consist of DS Andy Dalziel, pronounced Day-el, (Warren Clarke) and DI Peter Pascoe (Colin Buchanan) is much more new-school and systematic in sleuthing approach. Quite unlike grouchy Dalziel. Clarke has developed the recognizable cop character to the extreme, and placed a capitol C on Curmudgeon. Yorkshire cops teaming to uncover criminals. The characters, but no longer the plots since 2002, are based on novels by Reginald Hill. Dalziel & Pascoe conflicting natures has become expected to true fans.
WPC `Posh' Spicer (Jennifer James) begins a 20 episode run in the series. Wayne Perrey returns as DC Lateef.
Excellent writing involving multiple crimes that tend to merge into a final ending makes this show one of the great Brit TV views.  The show ran from 1996 to 2007.

No subtitles other than Dutch ones.
Otherwise good quality.",1338595200,5,217,5.055555555555555

Pascoe is his somber unfriendly business-like character without all of the idiotic dramatic mooning and whining.  These are the best stories this production group has made in ten years.  great job, keep up the good work.",1412121600,5,393,5.0
