8163744,3,B000LQN1IG,"These two BBC series, 1997 and 1999, seem rather mediocre;  none of the intertwined story lines grabbed my interest which is unusual because Jimmy McGovern had done some excellent work.  There was a lot of sex; plenty of bad language; and, courtesy of Downton's  Mr Mosley, very gory violence.
The disc format was good:  the 'play all' option and over three hours per disc; but having to turn off the subtitles at the star seemed odd for a region 2 dvd.
This is not a bad series - it's just not very good.",1426550400,,505,4.397849462365591
8163745,5,B000LQN1IG,"One of the best TV series I have ever seen. This is the kind of show that grips you and doesn't let go. I watched the first season all through the night one day and still talk about this show 6 years later.

The second season is not as heart-pounding nor are the characters as relateable and as sympathetic as in the first season, but spending more time with their stories is definitely worth it.

This is what good British TV is made of -- character stories that stay with you long after the talented actors have moved on to other projects.",1415059200,,541,4.294117647058823

8163747,5,B000LQN1IG,"A meaningless existence of commoners -of ""a mob""-has been presented expertly by producers and actors of a tale depicting routine copulating, lack of moral and bleak gambling-addicted welfare-reliant actuality in  idyllic Northern England.

Is it this place where incest was so common in the past historically? It is, perhaps, the only issue not being touched by the movie-makers.",1361145600,3,379,5.517241379310345
8163748,5,B000LQN1IG,"This is a truly gripping drama, set in the Lake District of England and covering the intertwined stories of a group of people of various ages in a small rural community.

John Simm takes the lead role as Danny Kavanagh, a young compulsive gambler escaping his dreary life in Liverpool, yet stumbling onto an even more complicated and tortuous one in the Lakes.
The story develops to cover such areas as addiction, prejudices, tragic accidents, faith, infidelity, murder and love, all set against a complex background of drinking, sex and religion. All this is achieved in a way that does not seem cliched or hackneyed.

The writing and directing of the series is superb and the acting of all cast members, truly showing British acting at its best. In addition to an early star performance by John Simm, the portrayals of Paul Copley, Mary Jo Randle, as Peter and Bernie Quinlan; Kevin Doyle, as John Fisher and Robert Pugh as Father Matthew, are particularly poignant.

The series is just about the right length, leaving the viewer very satisfied, and so different from many series which seem to drag on simply to cynically keep a franchise going.

Highly recommended.

8163749,5,B000LQN1IG,"The Lake District, 1997: Fleeing a life of familial confrontation and welfare drudgery in Liverpool, pathological gambler, Danny Kavanagh (John Simm) flees to Northern England's picturesque lake district. Danny soon finds work as a kitchen porter in a hotel and solace in the arms of local girl, Emma Quinlan (Emma Cunniffe) and it seems, for a short time, some sense of peace. However, life in an insular village is very different prospect to life in Liverpool and before long Danny begins to experience first-hand the darker side of life in the picturesque landscape which inspired Wordsworth...

""The Lakes"" caused massive controversy during it's original run in the UK - largely due to its unflinching depiction of sex, violence and social and moral bankruptcy in a rural community.  Unsurprisingly, it is the work of Liverpudlian screenwriter, Jimmy McGovern, who had previously struck pay-dirt with the similarly controversial&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Priest/dp/6305428093/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Priest</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cracker-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B001JXPC4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cracker: The Complete Collection</a>&nbsp;- the former being a play which unflinching dissected the life of a Catholic priest (played by Linus Roache) attempting to come to terms with his homosexuality, and the latter being a magnificent, ground-breaking series which chronicled the adventures of a flawed but brilliant forensic profiler played by Robbie Coltrane. Those familiar with McGovern's work can observe the progression from one work to another; if ""Cracker"" is about broken people, then ""The Lakes"" is about the environment that breaks them. As a piece of social fiction, it does nothing less than examine the minutiae of events and circumstances which culminate in several tragic episodes in the life of a small village; to somewhat painfully labour the water metaphor, in a way that the writer never does, McGovern takes the viewer beneath the surface of parochial village respectability to expose the festering resentments, animosities, anguish and unrequited dreams and passions that run through the very heart of a community.

The acting and writing throughout both series is brilliant, nuanced and understated. Praise must go to the young Simm who makes a character that could have been turned into an amoral bad-boy clich into a deeply sympathetic - if hopelessly flawed - everyman. Simm is supported by a superb ensemble cast that includes Mary Jo Randle, Robert Pugh and Paul Copley - whose characters make up three sides of one of the most painfully poignant love triangles ever to be realised on the small screen.

This is a restrained, gritty, brilliantly acted drama that doesn't pull any punches, and I defy you to watch the first episode of the first series and then not watch the rest almost immediately afterwards",1268179200,9,2964,5.854166666666667
