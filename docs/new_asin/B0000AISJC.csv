1908161,5,B0000AISJC,This dvd is wonderful.  The seller is very helpful and very nice to deal with.  The service was quick.,1244937600,,102,4.315789473684211
1908162,5,B0000AISJC,"David Attenborough peregrinates the globe in search of exotic, and not-so-exotic, plants and their ingenious survival strategies. I cannot imagine a better host for this journey than Mr. Attenborough. Nor can i imagine a subject that is less familiar and that holds as many surprises. You'll never look at your cactus the same way again.",1243382400,,337,5.1454545454545455
1908163,5,B0000AISJC,"This is the 5th entry in the David Attenborough Life series following Life in the Freezer. The groundbreaking first series Life on Earth was based on evolution and started with bacteria making its way up to modern humans over the course of 13 episodes. The Living Planet was 12 episodes long and dealt mainly with adaptation over a wide range of environments that also incorporated more Earth science along with the life science in terms of geology and environments. The Trials of Life was 12 episodes long and all about animal behaviour. Life in the freezer was 6 episodes long and specialized on the Antarctic.

Following Attenborough new move to specialize instead of following the 12-13 episode discipline that started with Clark's Civilisations and Bronowski's The Ascent of Man and birthed other great series like Sagan's Cosmos, Attenborough sticks with the shorter episode format of his previous non-life series such as The Tribal Eye, The First Eden and Lost Worlds, Vanished Lives for 6 instalments on another expert theme, Attenborough concentrates on one animal kingdom, the plants, and not only introduces what could be one of his most elaborate commentaries to date but brings us startling technical achievements in computer generates imagery for biological pathways and revolutionary time-lapsed photography techniques that even moves with the subject matter. This may be his best outing since Life on Earth.

While Life in the Freezer being the first of the shorter life series might have been low in the amount of diversity, The Private Life of Plants is at the other end of the spectrum, with so many variations from microbe-sized plants, seaweeds, mosses, flowers and trees the show ranges from the atom size to the monstrous, each with maybe more information than several Attenborough shows put together, this series blows you away from the opening sequence to the last where Attenborough stresses that we are doomed if we destroy it all, you have never seen an Attenborough Life presentation like it. The time-lapsed photography is incredible as we see plants moving in ways that you would never have thought possible, paying special detail to how they can climb by coiling or using tension to move, some plants are even meat eating predators that respond almost instantly when trapping an insect or secrete glue like chemicals to stick them to it. We see plants growing inside rocks in extreme environments such as the Antarctic and above the clouds on mountainous plateaus where they exist nowhere else, trees also bigger than blue whales and some thousands of years old. There are lots of symbiotic relationships to birds and insects but more importantly to fungi. While fungi aren't plants, Attenborough still devotes a large segment of one episode to them because they are so important. Major themes include how plants travel, how they grow, how they flower, how they compete with each other, how they live together and how they survive rough conditions. The sheer scope and volume of work packed into 6 episodes makes this quite simply one of the best documentaries ever made.",1231372800,4,3103,5.08235294117647
1908164,5,B0000AISJC,"I was going to school in Ireland when this came out and I remember watching in on television at that time. Never would I have imagined I could be that mesmerized by the plant world! David Attenborough draws you in and doesn't let go. You, literally, won't believe your eyes. I am so disappointed that this isn't available for DVD players this side of the pond. I still vividly remember this from watching it nearly 15 years ago and it is something I had wanted to share with my children. I hope that it will eventually be something people can enjoy on a more widespread basis in the US because it is spectacular!",1209340800,3,612,4.424778761061947
1908165,5,B0000AISJC,This is a fantastic series that I would love to own.  David Attenborough is at his best!!  PLEASE put this on a US or Canada [Region 1]DVD!!,1191369600,9,140,4.148148148148148
1908166,5,B0000AISJC,This is by far the best documentary on plants that I have ever seen. It is one of my all time favourite David Attenborough documentary films.  I've watched it several times and I'll look forwards to watching it many more times. The filming is beyond amazing. There are a lot of time lapse camera scenes which will give you a totally different perspective on how plant live and behave. This documentary will give you a whole new way of looking at nature. This documentary is a classic and a must have. It is one of those documentaries that you'll pull off the shelve every now and then to watch and still be amazed by it.,1184371200,,620,4.391304347826087
1908167,5,B0000AISJC,"The first time I came across this documentary on VHS, I watched it twice because it was so remarkable. From there after, I would frequently talk about this documentary to my friends and have them watch it too.  Already a botanist at heart, this series reeled me deeper into the remarkable world of plants and I am undeniably hooked. David Attenborough does an excellent job at explaining how things work in the plant world, with his charming wit and lightheartedness his documentary has the ability to reach out to a diverse group of audiences and is sure to marvel many.",1180224000,11,571,4.71
1908168,5,B0000AISJC,"The quality of this series is truly remarkable and its title is not misleading: It reveals the private life of plants in a breathtakingly new way. It shows how varied the strategies of plants are in the struggle for survival and it sheds light on the intricate ways in which plants and animals have adapted to each other. The quality of the time-lapse photography in this six-part series is truly amazing. Camera movements, focus shifts and perfect lighting create dramatic time-lapse sequences with a quality unmatched by anything else that has been shown on TV. It's simply a class of its own. See how plants crawl, fight, and devour other plants and animals. The series also demonstrates how plants and animals live together, a relationship forged by half a billion years of co-evolution, and how plants often exploit animals - not the other way around. You'll never see plants in the same way as before.",1165276800,16,907,4.858064516129033
1908169,5,B0000AISJC,"I remember watching this on TV when it aired back in 95, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that it completely changed my perspective at how I looked at the world. Using Time-lapse photography, The series shows how the plant world is as Darwinian and ruthless as the animal world, it just happen too slow for Human beings to perceive.",1150761600,21,335,4.508196721311475
1908190,5,B0000AISJC,This is a must have product.  We have watched it several times and shared with other family members.  REALLY OUTSTANDING,1393891200,,120,4.95
1908191,5,B0000AISJC,"Had part of the series in VHS many years ago and was delighted to find a used version available on DVD.

Attenborough's programmes are superb and well worth investing the money. TV today is not worth watching but to be able to relax and watch such an excellent program is a joy.",1393632000,,278,4.346153846153846
1908192,3,B0000AISJC,"The Private Life of Plants isn't as spectacular as David Attenborough's later foray into the kingdom of Plantae and Fungi, Kingdom of Plants 3D, but that's mostly a function of the camera technology. Otherwise, all the bizarre stuff is here: 500 year old strangler figs, the Venus fly trap, the pitcher plant, the giant water lily, or the perfectly ordinary bramble  ordinary, that is, until you film it with time-lapse photography, revealing that the bramble bush is about as aggressive as an expansive human empire

Somehow, I got even more paranoid about the houseplants surrounding me as we speak, after watching clips from this six-part series! As a kid, I assumed that plants were boring and somehow girlie, but it seems they are just as cool as sharks or mountain lions, ha ha.",1389484800,2,784,4.887218045112782
1908193,5,B0000AISJC,Excellent presentation and structured knowledge. Very informative about the various strategies of plants presented with a refined technique. Highly recommended,1384992000,,159,7.0
1908194,5,B0000AISJC,"I'm a collector of BBC nature programs narrated by David Attenborough.  I have a separate, USB plug in DVD player set for Zone 2 for so that it doesn't mess with my computer's settings.  My understanding is if you just stick this DVD into your computer it will play it (it will first notify you that it is of a different configuration/zone) but after doing so 3-4 times it will automatically stay (possibly permanently) configured to that Zone setting.  I don't know why the BBC doesn't make these available in Zone 1 - they're missing out on a large market.  I hope this input has helped.",1379289600,,589,4.528301886792453
1908195,4,B0000AISJC,"Although it is a Region 2 DVD, it will play on my PC using VLC player.  I show it in my Biology class using my projector.",1369008000,,121,3.6538461538461537
1908196,5,B0000AISJC,"I have used this series for over a decade in the classroom in a course on ecology and religion.  It is the best visual evidence of plant sentience I have ever seen and an incredible educational experience.  It makes the viewer see plantlife as separate and animate, even conscious and aware, in a way written material cannot.  I agree 100% with other reviewers that BBC needs to put this series in DVD region 1 format for North American viewers because there is no other program out there that does what Attenborough's Private Life of Plants does.  But in the meantime, there are companies that can transfer vhs and non-region 1 dvds to region 1 format dvds at a modest fee for home/non-commercial viewing.  This program is worth it--nothing else comes close.",1366588800,,759,4.763358778625954
1908197,4,B0000AISJC,I ordered this video for my Attenboro collection. It is very cool and used in the class room while students study ecology.,1364256000,,122,4.590909090909091
1908198,5,B0000AISJC,"A COLLECTOR'S PICK!!
Before any computer animation these guys have made one piece of art...They developed new techniques for many shots. The photography is marvelous. And David Attenborough is a guaranty, as always, for an enriched narrative.
For me the Best Plants Documentary ever

Keep it and save it for the posterity.",1362700800,,322,5.1923076923076925
1908199,5,B0000AISJC,I've seen enough clips of this to be absolutely heartbroken that it can not be played on American DVD players! BBC PLEASE release a Region 1 version? I know others are waiting with just as much frustration as I to buy this amazing show on DVD!!,1362009600,,244,4.326086956521739
1908210,5,B0000AISJC,"If only it was available on a DVD that could be played in the US. We still have our old video tapes. The photographic work amazes, and David Attenborough it top-notch as the narrator.",1354924800,,183,4.411764705882353
1908211,5,B0000AISJC,"This is a fantastic nature series. My old VHS is worn out. I converted them to mpg, but now the latest drivers do not play mpg well. So I will have to wait for DVD. I miss these episodes already.",1343088000,2,195,3.9
1908212,5,B0000AISJC,"This is probably my favorite of the David Attenborough documentaries.  Anyone who is curious about or loves plants should see this.
I do hope they make a USA compatible release soon. Consider this a plea.",1330387200,,204,4.828571428571428
1908213,5,B0000AISJC,"What a great series!  We're using this for supplementing our Science curriculum in home schooling.  But it's quite entertaining and so amazing how the Creator has intricately designed the plant world and their symbiotic relationship with insects, animals, and each other.  This set really highlights some of those amazing activities going on all around us, but in ways we just don't notice until a DVD like this brings it to your attention.  Just breath-taking.  Keep in mind this is a region 2 dvd set (not U.S.).  We're using it in a multi-region player overseas.  Love it.",1325808000,,575,4.927083333333333
1908214,5,B0000AISJC,"This documentary has amazing footage that makes plant's life show up in all its dynamic glory. Attenborough's characteristic enthusiasm and knowledge is contagious and one ends up regretting only one thing: that the film must end.

I suggest this documentary to anyone interested in plants, insects or, in general, life on our planet.",1316304000,,334,5.30188679245283
1908215,1,B0000AISJC,"We were unaware when we bought this what the exact meaning of ""Region 2"" meant.  Thus, we were unable to play this on standard ""American"" DVD playing equipment.  I believe that there should have been a better CAUTIONARY STATEMENT on the pitch for this item.",1314921600,3,257,4.688888888888889
1908216,4,B0000AISJC,"I can't be sure how this product was sold in the past but Amazon currently clearly warns that a Region 2 player is required in bold black and red print. Computer DVD players should be able to play these disks but may require a firmware change to Region 2. Normal stand-alone Region 1 NTSC DVD players will not be able to play these disks. My solution was to allow the computer DVD player to change itself over to Region 2 in order to play these disks. The computer had no trouble with the PAL format. The firmware will need to be changed back to Region 1 again to play Region 1 disks and the firmware can only be changed a handful of times so this could be a problem if someone planed to go back and forth between regions. An internal DVD player/burner for a computer can be purchased for under $20 online so it would be pretty cheap to dedicate a separate DVD drive for each region.

By comparison the Region 2 DVDs are quite a bargain (@ under $20) even with the Region 2/PAL complications.

Plenty of the other reviewers have done an excellent job describing the wonderful content of the DVDs so I'll not repeat their words.

Minus one star for video quality (1995 era) which is passable but is not up to modern DVD standards, and for the difficulties that Region 2/PAL causes people in the USA. A NTSC Region 1 DVD would be better for the US market, if one were available.

Since I was warned in advance that the disks are Region 2 and since the production year is clearly stated to be 1995 I'm completely satisfied with the purchase.",1293926400,4,2023,5.121212121212121
1908217,5,B0000AISJC,"Although the video quality of this series is not the best (it was made years ago for television), all in all it is classic Attenborough: beautiful, fascinating, and amazing. From the first few minutes right through to the last, this series will keep you very interested. Be advised that it is Region 2. If your DVD player won't play it, I would advise getting one of the many free file converter programs on the net and converting it to an avi file, which will be quite watchable.",1281830400,,480,4.528735632183908

1908219,1,B0000AISJC,"After receiving what I thought would be a *great* deal -

I found that ""[Region 2]"" means PAL format DVD which is for European use only.  At least Now I Know what [Region 2] means.
