813425,5,6304240554,"This is a review for Dawn Of The Dead (1978 / Special Divimax Edition).

If you're like me and too broke to afford the hundred and fifty dollar  Dawn of the Dead - Ultimate Edition, this is a great option.

Every time I would look for this movie at my local stores, all I could find was the Zack Snyder remake.

I set out to find this movie online, but all I could find was the Dawn Of The Dead (TV Edit) and Dawn Of The Dead Ultimate Edition.

One was sissy sauce and the other was half the price of a current generation game console.

Eventually I found this single DVD; no frills; movie, and it's awesome.

The Special Divimax Edition of Dawn of The Dead is well edited; long enough to fit all of the story; and even includes a few tracks from Goblin.

All in all, five stars all the way.

On a side note, if this DVD is sold out, find the Italian version, it goes be the name Zombie.

It's just as good and the sound track is a little better.",1509840000,2,946,4.037634408602151

Specifically, the box set is in excellent condition with no scratches or abrasion on the box  containing the set or the DVD's themselves. Moreover, the commemorative Dawn of the Dead comic book and production still inserts were in almost pristine condition.  Most importantly, I purchased this box set in very good condition; for, a fraction of a new box set. the price.  With respect to the film ""Dawn of the Dead"" this 1978 version is a worthy successor to Night of the Living Dead; thereby,  vastly  surpassing its predecessor in the areas of script, direction, production values, artistic merit, and commercial success.

813794,4,6304240554,"This has got be one of the WILDEST movies ever made.  It's got everything.  It's a great horror film, yes.  But it is also very, very funny and politically satirical.  Some of it is particularly cartoonish; other times I found myself jumping and feeling utterly stupid the filmmakers were able to pull a fast one on me!  It works on so many levels.

I have to admit: I only recently just saw this film a couple weeks ago.  I never bothered to watch it because I saw the 2005 remake upon release and felt that was sufficient.  Well, don't make the same mistake I did!  Romero's 1978 version is far superior to the 2005 version.  Sure, the special fx (the blood looks like red melted crayons!) and the acting isn't quite as good as the 2005 movie.  I will freely admit this.  But this film is much more creative in its use of the mall as a setting than the remake.

The remake used the shopping mall as a claustrophobic space most of the time, the survivors locked away, stuck, under the security gates.  In this version they really utilize the space of the mall.  They're on the roof, the air ducts, all the stores, the basement/broiler area, the parking lot.  There's even an epic fight against other humans for control of the mall, complete with motorcycles and cars racing down the lanes of the food court.  The survivors even create their own apartment--a zombie-free shangri-la--in an office near the roof and live there comfortably for months on end.

I'll leave you with a little quote from Roger Ebert, who gave the film 4 stars:
""If you can see beyond the immediate impact of Romero's imagery, if you can experience the film as being more than just its violent extremes, a most unsettling thought may occur to you: The zombies in ""Dawn of the Dead"" are not the ones who are depraved. They are only acting according to their natures, and, gore dripping from their jaws, are blameless.  The depravity is in the healthy survivors, and the true immorality comes as two bands of human survivors fight each other for the shopping center: Now look who's fighting over the bones! But ""Dawn"" is even more complicated than that, because the survivors have courage, too, and a certain nobility at times, and a sense of humor, and loneliness and dread, and are not altogether unlike ourselves. A-ha.""",1440633600,3,2296,4.610837438423645

813877,4,6304240554,"Perhaps my favorite zombie movie of all time, this gory, often funny, occasionally brutal film features credibly flawed characters that we can get behind and a believable story of a zombie apocalypse.

In 1968 George Romero revolutionized the movie zombie concept by delivering the contagious, flesh-eating zombie (in lieu of risen corpses of vengeance via Voodoo).  Zombies eating people was a notion that had not before been realized on film.  Needless to say, in the next 10 years flesh-eating zombies became a celebrated theme in horror.  After numerous copycats followed Night of the Living Dead (1968), Romero finally made his highly anticipated sequel.  After various delays, eventually Dario Argento flew Romero to Italy, where Romero penned the script.  Romero had complete creative freedom and, in exchange, Argento got to make his own cut however he wishedand he did so with none of the humor.  I am quite curious to see this cut, but I doubt it would be as entertaining.

In Dawn of the Dead (1978), we find ourselves looking at the world now that the zombie apocalypse is well under way and a fact of life.  In equal doses of satire and realism, hunting and gun enthusiasts (i.e., proud rednecks) rally together and form base camps to hunt the zombies, draining beer coolers as they heckle each others marksmanship over lunch.  Very funny, yet very believably delivered with perhaps a somewhat straight face.

We focus on four survivors who find their way to a shopping mall (back when malls were a relatively new thing) in the spirit of consumerism.  Shortly after their arrival, they observe waves of zombies being drawn to the mallas if it was their instinct to go there to find what they needflesh, in this case.  National Guardsmen Peter (Ken Foree) and Roger join Stephen and Francine in realizing that their residence in this mall may last longer than they anticipated.

This was definitely the most fun movie in Romeros initial zombie trilogy.  Theres a playfulness to it.  And why not?  A lone zombie poses little threat to an able-bodied, wary person like a National Guardsman.  We see Roger and Peter running around the mall having fun, like two bros playfully running football drills, as they collect groceries and equipment.  Roger slides down the escalator rails, they taunt and herd zombies where they want them or knock off their zombie hats, they sprint through department storesall the things we would get yelled at for doing when we were kids.

We get some great zombie kills in this film, my favorite of which being when the helicopter chops off the zombies headthe top of it anyway.  Just watching the zombies wander the mall offers its own form of entertainment.  Romero never gave clear direction to the zombie actors.  He wanted them to do whatever they wanted and some of their facial expressions are priceless.  That gave us todays zombies.  My favorite zombie had to be the Hare-Krishna.

Of course, the tedium of their mall-inhabiting lifestyle wears on our protagonists.  Theres a strong sense of irony when we find Peter playing racquetball on the roof as the zombie apocalypse presses on.  Eventually they develop a desire to move elsewhere and find other survivors.  This is where some tension builds.

Despite being so gorily loaded with rubber guts and torn flesh, this film has a good sense of humor to it until the end, which closes on a dark note when a paramilitary biker gang overtake the mall and all chaos breaks out.  This long segment of the movie is a tolling dose of reality and human nature.

Some may criticize the inconsistency of Romeros zombies, sometimes moving fast and sometimes slow.  But heres something to consider:  Zombies, like any movie antagonist, are a dangerous as they need to be in any given scene.  Theyre as fast or dangerous or scary as the scene merits.  Thats the difference between reality and filmmaking, life and drama.  Whenever a protagonist martial artist character faces a single bad guy, you get one fight that endures exchanging countless blows lasting 5-10 minutes of screen time.  However, when that same martial artist encounters 20 bad guys, each bad guy is dispatched with one or two quick, easily delivered techniques.

Another curiosity is why a bite (however minor it may be) will cause a victim to die within days and become a zombie, whereas getting zombie blood splattered in Rogers face (e.g., the truck recon scene) is no worry at all for contracting zombiismconsider what happens to Brendan Gleeson in 28 Days Later.  To this end, I say chill out.  This was Romeros second movie and he invented the zombie you have come to know and love.  The zombie rules were still being written right in front of us and, in Romeros zombiverse, this was the first time it happened.  He was just making a movie, people.  Blood splatters are exciting and manifest urgency.  Dont overthink it.  Romero hadnt even identified the zombiism definitively as a curse, virus or anythingwe just get hints.

Speaking of those hints, a news clip from Night of the Living Dead (1968) suggested the possible cause of zombiism was radioactive contamination from a space probe from Venus crash-landing on Earth.  Perhaps there were radioactive bacteria on the probe that were ingested by patient zero, and the reason only a bite will cause zombiism is because the affliction lies in the intestinal bacteriofauna (or gut flora) in the infected zombies.  Why might a scratch infect you?  Because the zombies sloppily eat with their hands, which are now covered with this alien bacteria.  There!  Blood splatter controversy solved.  LOL.

We embark on a rollercoaster of emotion as this gory film was loads of fun and managed to make us wince in the utterly brutal opening scenes, laugh in the middle, and grow tense at the end.  The characters expressed various credible human responses to pressure and danger, bravery and cowardice, control and chaos.  The story was solid and the dilemmas faced made sense.  Night of the Living Dead will remain Romeros most important film and the most significant zombie film perhaps ever to be made.  But I find Dawn of the Dead to be his best film.",1435708800,2,6158,4.894685990338164

813879,4,6304240554,"I never really saw the original Dawn of the Dead until now. Saw the remake but the original is better than that remake of Dawn of the Dead. It starts off at a TV station showing how the zombies are slowly attacking. Also The Goblins, the band used for the Dawn of the Dead, I first heard they're music from Hell of the Living Dead when the Cinema Snob reviewed it. Dawn of the Dead also looks good in color especially in High Definition. Then at the TV studio a girl and a guy try to leave the studio while some SWAT guys do a raid on some building. When the shootout happens its kind of terrible seeing the living kill the living in these movies. Zombies are also at the building where the SWAT team is and they try and kill them. The makeup I think is okay for the movie and in color, so was the Walking Dead too. A black guy and a white guy from the SWAT team try to talk, bond, and escape the SWAT team. The guy and girl meet the SWAT guys at a police station where they take a helicopter. When going around in the helicopter they see the activity on the ground of the living trying to kill the zombies. They go to refuel and when the guy gets in trouble the girl doesnt seem to help. Theres also a scene where a zombie gets his part of head cut off from one of the helicopter blades too. Also black guy kills some zombie kids as well. They then discover a mall where they decide to live there. Also they lure and contain the dead so the place can be safe inside. Theres also some subtext about mall shoppers as well in the movie. Even though mall are kind of dying today with all this online shopping now. They seem to enjoy the place and most of the movie I think is this. They also find out the girl is pregnant even though theres scenes of her smoking and drinking still. Then some bikers come by and try to raid the mall and Tom Savinis one of them too. The gore in this movie isn't too over the top like in Day of the Dead and Im kind of glad. Then the guy, I think his name is Steve, gets shot, then bitten by the zombies. Black guy and girl then finish him off to save him from a fate worse than death when they get inside. The end I can say is a bit on the lighter note then in Night of the Living Dead I can tell you that. I also heard they did the movie at night when the mall was closed. Which would seem kind of hard if you think about it. Anyway this is a great movie and a classic regardless of the zombie craze. give it a watch if you can or not as scared easily.",1434067200,2,2483,3.9580838323353293

The four DVD set is called Dawn of The Dead Ultimate Edition.  This is not bad, the picture is very good but it is not the four DVD set with all the extras.

By the way to all the negative reviewers who are psychoanalyzing this movie, boy are you all THICK, you don't have a clue.

This movie was designed for teenage boys and girls of the SEVENTIES to watch on a Saturday night with just enough shock for the girl to feel compelled to grab the boy and cover her eyes with his shoulder a few times during the movie.  The culture back then was different; it was the days of disco, fine Corinthian leather, the Rockford Files and NO PC'S AND SMART PHONES.  That audience didn't want to see nightmarishly real zombies eating one another in graphic detail, they wanted a diversion, they wanted to have some fun and in that light, this movie is five star fantastic.  It's silly, it's quant, and at times it's downright disgusting. It's not about the zombies, it's not about fine actors giving stellar performances in fantastically gory makeup, it's about regular people making the best out of what they have, and rolling with the changes life throws at them, and oh by the way, also there are zombies trying to kill them.",1414540800,8,1359,4.416

It utilizes the same dynamic as the first film, strand a small group of people in one location, cut them off from the outside world, and surround them with zombies.  Of course, being in a mall, they do have more fun than the first group of people did in that crappy house in the middle of nowhere.  And with this group, less arguing, more shopping.  They find time to have fun between skirmishes with persistent zombies and then a band of bikers show up.  Naturally, they want what the others have.  It isn't a matter of sharing.
Possibly, because of the carnival atmosphere (pie throwing et cetera), this entry is far less bleak than the first film was.
Lots of gore, loads of miscellaneous violence, the plight of younger zombies is finally addressed.

A small group of 4 tries to escape a horde of flesh eating zombies by hiding in a shopping mall.  One memorable line that dates the film is when they arrive outside the mall and someone says what is that?  At the time this movie was made in 1979 the malls we know today were not that common.  The film is extremely gory, but moves at a slow pace that made me start to loose interest.  I like Night of the Living Dead much better. The zombies makeup often appears to be blue or green, but the makeup artist for this film, Tom Savini said in an interview that the only color used was grey.  The lighting sometimes made it appear a different color.

814409,5,6304240554,"If you enjoy The Walking Dead, horror films, zombies or just slow moving zombies in general then this is a MUST OWN for you. George Romero makes one of the all time greatest horror movies and defines what a zombie film should be with this movie. If you even think about watching the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead before watching this then you are really missing out and doing yourself an injustice.
Some of the special effects may seem dated or not up to par when you consider today's films and even the television show The Walking Dead, but the story of exactly what happens to society when the world ends and the dead rise is the main draw here. The main difference between this film and the 2004 remake is EVERYONE returns from the dead. If you get bit by a zombie you turn, but if you just die in general you turn. That means anyone who dies in their sleep, commits suicide without destroying the brain, has a heart attack, a brain aneurysm, etc will return from the grave. The sheer amount of undead you would face would be unbelievable and that, in my opinion, is far scarier than undead that can sprint like marathon runners and make noises that resemble Raptor's from Jurassic Park.
If you're looking for a great, old school, classic horror film that will make you think then check this out. You will not be disappointed. There would be no ""Walking Dead"" and no zombie genre without this film and George Romero. Do yourself a favor and watch this classic.",1385424000,,1465,4.470149253731344

When I opened the box, much of the plastic case and plastic hubs (which hold the DVDs in place) were shattered.  There was broken plastic shards and loose DVDs all over the place.  In addition, the DVDs were scratched all to heck.  Finally, because they were sent by a seller other than Amazon, Amazon could not send me a replacement....only a refund.  That made me mad because the DVD set was on sale for $15.00.  Now the price has gone up to $45.00!!  I love Amazon, but I try not to buy box sets from them anymore because they are just to heavy and bulky for the flimsy DVD envelopes that Amazon uses.

That said, it's important to see this original in the proper light--limited budget and a 70s audience with lower expectations--much lower apparently.  The pacing and the editing of this film was hard to follow at times, with the characters moving on without much explanation. The oddest thing about this film was the inappropriate levity--the characters were actually having too much fun throughout which was just plain weird. I hated the biker scenes--too much road warrior and ZERO character development.  They added plot-line tension, but I hate the insinuation that, when faced with devastation, people are going to turn into barbarians.  Stupid--and it's a cheap right-wing lie so many of us buy into (consider the gun crazies of our society).  We have countless examples of people banding together and helping one another in times of crisis.

814470,3,6304240554,"With one of the coolest taglines ever, Dawn of the Dead has a massive following in the horror community. Many people see Romero as a type of God, especially considering their adoration for the three zombie movies that made him so famous. In case you don't know and are brain dead yourself, Night of the living dead is the original, Dawn of the dead is the sequel, and Day of the Dead is the finale. Well, until land of the dead anyway, but that's a different story.
 We start with the world being overrun by rabid zombies looking to tear people to pieces. The viewer is greeted with some sickening shit, especially considering how fakish orange the blood looks. Four survivors consisting of two SWAT team members, a traffic reporter and his pregnant girlfriend, all come together and run like hell to salvation. They come up with the idea of camping out in the mall and blocking all the undead fiends on the outside. Their plan would have worked wonders if the bikers from hell hadn't shown up to crash the party.

The plot itself is genius. A mall you say? Great atmosphere. Romero used this to his advantage, wanting to cash in a commentary about how America is obsessed with consumerism. It's made clear throughout what he was aiming for, but the whole thing isn't completely serious. There's some morbid humor behind a few corners, classic Romero style.

On the good side of things, there's plenty of suspense. Just because these bad boys don't run doesn't mean they don't freak me out. The most suspenseful part of the movie is when that stupid idiot gets his arm bitten...was that not being so cocky it was his fault or what?? I was about to die watching that scene. Men, please stop letting machismo rule over common sense. I about had a heart attack. The more heart pounding scene...of the entire series!

The acting is also very convincing. Ken Foree stands out and slides into his role with ease.  David Emge as Stephen hits all the right notes and prevails. Scott Reiniger (Roger) was born for the role, and Gaylen Ross plays the solo female remarkably well. The directing is tight and heightens suspense, and the score is pretty nifty, especially for the time period.

On the bad side of things, and yes - gulp - I said bad, some of the effects weren't to my liking. I despised the blood; hate that look. It ruined most of the death scenes for me, and in horror if the death scenes are ruined, well...that just bites. The pacing was developed well but I felt was more sluggish than it had to be at times. When the credits rolled I just sat there, let down. I think maybe I took too long to see this movie; all those years of hype slaughtered it. I enjoyed it but was expecting much more. Instead it came across campy, cheesy, and not as frightening as I would have liked. I enjoyed the acting, the characters, but not too deeply.

Yell at me, shoot me, and put me out of my misery, but Dawn of the Dead was just an average horror flick in my eyes. Regarded by many as a ruler of the genre, I just don't get the magic. Perhaps if I had seen it in another decade, when I was younger, or if I hadn't heard all the hype first....Irregardless, it is what it is, and it's not bad, ...but it's not amazing either.",1379635200,,3218,4.444067796610169

Buy the Ultimate Edition DVD. Region 2 got a 3-disc Blu-Ray release and we get a one-disc Blu-Ray release. They could have just ported over the European content and added some new supplements. Ultimately, we get a limited Blu-Ray release in the US so Dead fans may want to pick up the Ultimate Edition DVD instead.

814476,5,6304240554,"Where do I begin? The 70s had already shown a couple of good reasons for why they would be a well-known decade in horror history. ""Black Christmas"", ""The Exorcist"", ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Jaws"", and ""Halloween"". A little over ten years had passed since George A. Romero shocked the world with ""Night of the Living Dead"". In films, it's rare for lightning to strike twice. For Romero, however, this wasn't just another great bolt of lightning: it was a perfect storm of a movie. A perfect follow-up to an already great film, ""Dawn of the Dead"" was nothing short of greatness in itself. The writing and characters were fantastic. Something that was definitely lost through time was having likable characters (I'm looking at you ""Cabin Fever""). The suspense and dread were just perfect and never overwhelmed the fun of the whole thing. Speaking of which, it might not be safe or smart, but come on: having a whole mall to yourself while waiting out the zombie apocalypse? That sounds amazing! Finally, the gore. Yeah, compared to something you'd see now, it might be nothing. But it's jaw-dropping for me. It just proves that Tom Savini was the master of his craft back then. If you're a zombie movie fan and you haven't seen this movie, you're missing out on a huge piece of zombie film history.",1376611200,,1302,4.765486725663717

814586,5,6304240554,"Who wants to go shopping?  Dawn of the Dead. The original. It's pretty simple really.  If Night of the Living Dead (1968) is A New Hope. Then Dawn of the Dead (1978) is the Empire Strikes Back of zombie flicks.  In other words, it's a classic sequel that trumps the first installment. This rarely happens in films. When it does it's important to take note. Judging by the current zombie trend in pop culture, the world did not miss this one. A strong argument could be made that Dawn of the Dead is the best and most dynamic zombie film ever made. It really has classic written all over it. It was directed by classic zombie aficionado George Romero in 1978. He was at the absolute top of his game and the zombie culture needed a figure head. Dawn of the Dead provided zombie legend with a philosophical foundation.  This film essentially planted the seeds for everything zombie oriented that would come later. Tom Savini, also in top form, was in charge of the gore and special effects. It all worked then, and it still works now. Arguably, more then ever.  The main reason for this film's longevity is rooted in the subtext. Zombie apocalypse survivors barricade themselves into a shopping mall. For the duration of the film, the survivors are stuck in a mall surrounded by zombies. Sound familiar? Some call it genius others call it disgusting.  For the bold philosophical statements this film makes alone, I'll put it at the top of any list, zombies or whatever. Overall, Dawn of the Dead is a statement about humanity.  What the hell are they? They are us. Thats all.",1369526400,,1572,4.612903225806452

814681,3,6304240554,"I have to say although I do actually like the movie for the most part, by all the trailers & given the tagline, the film is misrepresented as a serious dramatic horror-type film. I like a comedy to be a comedy & a horror film to be straight horror. This is why I don't like Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It may be highly popular to a particular cult audience, but that doesn't mean it's all that good. I am strictly a fan of 70s horror films (so no unwarranted comments of how I don't or can't appreciate the classics/genre) which I wouldn't consider this one in that category exactly. I'd consider this more of an offbeat dark comedy with shades of drama figuring in to the mix.

There was a good amount of attempted humor in Dawn of The Dead. I say attempted because I didn't find the blend of comedy amusing or necessary. I enjoyed the actors in the film with the exception of Scott Reiniger's character. I loved the shopping mall theme, etc...

Again, I enjoyed the film for the most part & am pleased to have it in my DVD archives. I just wish it minimized the dark humor a bit. The bikers driving through the mall was a bit silly & over-the-top.

Overall, this is not a horror film by any means. If you want horror, watch the original Night of the Living Dead. To compare a classic like that to something like this is laughable. Apples & oranges.

I love spooks & chills & on that level Dawn of the Dead failed miserably. Certain reviewers has said the film is intended as a comedy. They must not have seen the tv spots & trailers like the rest of us did. That said, I didn't love it as I wanted to, however, it's still a good film which I did like. I just really wanted a horror film as was represented in the original movie ad, trailers, tv & radio spots.",1363392000,,1758,4.254491017964072

814755,4,6304240554,"After watching the Blu-Ray version of Dawn of the Dead, all I can say is it is a cornucopia of 70's cultural artifacts as well as a brilliant example of good B-Movie production.  This is an important distinction to make, since much of the legacy of the horror genre was laid by filmmakers who had very tight budgets and therefore had to deliver their shocks and screams through creative use of editing, makeup, and unvarnished dialogue.

In theaters this movie was among the most shocking, and gory films I'd ever seen.  Mind you, a middle-school student in '78 would have been very hard-pressed to find anything so gory, but in Blu-Ray the special FX show in bloody detail the limits of what latex flesh, rubber limbs, pig intestines, and colored dye packs can do.  For an aspiring film student, the very evident reveals of these limitation fills the mind with how any creative teen could cobble together a workable film with similar story, set, and effect elements.

However, in my opinion what really makes this film shine are the cultural overtones which make it very obvious how our world has changed in the time since the original theatrical release.  Keep in mind, in 1978 the modern enclosed indoor shopping mall was a relatively new creation.  The idea that four survivors of the zombie apocalypse would hold out in a shopping-mall, where food, clothing, in fact nearly all necessities of life are readily available was in itself a stroke of writing genius.  When one of the characters states after wondering aloud why the zombies were congregating around the mall says, ""They're after the place. They don't know why; they just remember. Remember that they want to be in here"", we can see an early observation and possible indictment of our growing ""consumer economy"" based on conspicuous consumption - it was so important to the living that even the dead come back.  Walking Dead holes up in a prison, Dawn of the Dead holes up in a Mall.  Both are makeshift ""fortresses"" that are well provisioned and defensible, but Dawn of the Dead allows us to explore our id-driven impulses of looting and survivalism in one place!

There are other great examples, such as the line heard from an off-screen Television an expert/pundit says, ""This isn't the Republicans versus the Democrats, where we're in a hole economically or... or we're in another war. This is more crucial than that. This is down to the line, folks, this is down to the line. There can be no more divisions among the living!""  Wow, fast forward to 2012, and it's comforting to know the current problems in Washington DC were alive and well (over similar issues) 34 years ago!

And let's not forget the soundtrack!  Cheesy synthesizers that could have easily been lifted from Tom Baker-era Doctor Who episodes!  People forget that back then it was a very ""modern"" sound, used throughout TV and film of that period rather than the more expensive orchestral scoring that preceded it.  The musical score is another prime example of why film students and movie aficionados will enjoy watching this film.

It's also amazing to see the ugly design standards of the late-70's on full display.  One can tune in to ""That 70's Show"" on one TV and flip back and forth between the two and the authenticity of the sitcom is obvious, from the hair and makeup to the furniture and fashions.  The cultural DNA of that decade is everywhere and is both laughable and nostalgic at the same time.

And without giving any spoilers away, the final scene with Peter making his last ditch effort to escape - and the final lines of fluff dialogue - again classic

The special features are less than stunning: we get a fan-video of the Monroeville Mall, some trailers, a couple of ""behind-the scenes"" videos of the monster FX, etc.  Buyers can therefore consider the purchase/rental of the downloaded/cloud-based version of the Blu-Ray, but in the opinion of this reviewer - ownership has it's own special pleasures, and no self-respecting fan of the zombie/horror genre should be without one!",1356739200,,4036,4.827285921625545
814832,4,6304240554,"This sequel to Night of the Living Dead by George A. Romero has probably solidified him as the father of the modern zombie movie. If all western philosophy is footnotes to Plato, then all modern zombie movies are footnotes to Romero's first three zombie films (Day of the Dead is the third). They've all been remade and countless spin-offs and imitations are out there.

The movie follows a few survivors in the midst of the zombie apocalypse (though they don't call it that). The action begins in Philadelphia, where a television station is trying to stay on air as long as it can to give people the information they need (and max out their ratings). Even if the information they have is becoming hopelessly out of date. The air-traffic reporter takes his girlfriend (one of the producers at the station) in his helicopter to find safety somewhere else, like maybe Canada.

Meanwhile, the military is trying to round up people and get them to safe locations. This effort is not going well since some people are resisting. The racist members of the military use the situation as an excuse to open up on minorities. This part of the film is probably the most jarring and seems like social commentary thrown in for its own sake rather than for narrative coherence. Eventually a couple of soldiers join up with the TV station staff in the helicopter and head out looking for safety.

As they fly from fuel point to fuel point, the foursome wind up at an isolated suburban mall that still has electricity. No one is around but the zombies. The survivors speculate that the zombies have some residual memories of being at the mall and it being a happy place. Realizing that the mall has everything they could ever need, they decide to clear out the zombies, secure the entrances, and set up a good life for themselves. Naturally plans don't go according to plan (otherwise, where would the drama be?) and their heavenly haven slowly becomes overrun with problems.

The film's best part is the mall sequence, though it takes a good 40 minutes or so to get there. After they've cleaned up the place, they try to live the good life like there's nothing going on outside. Eventually television broadcasts stop so no information is available, furthering their fantasy of isolated security. They try to live happily with all the jewelry, clothes, and electronics they could ever want. The emptiness of consumerism eventually hits them but too late, because new zombies and a biker gang are on their way. Romero is merciless in mocking the low ambitions of all the characters. The drama and the satire are well blended if over the top at times. During the final battle with the zombies, an extended sequence goes comic with, among other gags, the humans throwing pies in the faces of the zombies. I know it sounds like I'm making it up, but I swear I am not! A good five minutes of slap-stick precede the more horrific situation when the zombies get the upper hand and begin to take back the mall and pick apart the living humans (yes, I do mean that literally).

The gore is very extreme. I'm not really a fan of gore though I can take it if the story is interesting enough or the characters engage me. So I did make it to the end of this film, but just barely. The social satire is surprisingly fresh though Romero is a little too pessimistic for my tastes.

Another thing to note--several different versions of this film exist. The American theatrical release is different from the international release (Italian horror master Dario Argento made that cut of the film, apparently with less humor and more music) which is different from the ""extended"" edition which has another 12 minutes that was reinserted by someone other than Romero and Argento. I'm not sure which cut I saw though judging by the humor and lack of music it was the American cut. I watched on BBC's iPlayer, so maybe it is the Argento cut. I don't think I'll watch it again to find out.",1354147200,,3946,4.654232424677188

814838,4,6304240554,"The dead are walking the earth and eating the living. Stephen and his girlfriend Francine work at a TV station, where they decided to steal the station's helicopter to find someplace safe form the zombie menace. Roger and Peter are SWAT team operatives that are forced to kill the dead that a group of people decided to store in their apartment's basement instead of taking them to the authorities to be disposed of. Together, these two groups of people escape Philadelphia and stop at a shopping mall because it seems like a fortified, safe place to hide out for a while. Who knows how long the mall will remain a relatively safe place or how long it will take other people to discover it.

Dawn of the Dead is an interesting and important film in modern zombie history. There are things I love about and things I don't love about it. Let's start with what I like. It was made on a really small budget, but the effects and sets look pretty amazing. The zombie makeup ended up looking more blue than gray, but the blood and gore effects plus a lot of the stunts look really good. It's a pretty gory film compared to Night of the Living Dead and, thanks to the genius and ingenuity of Tom Savini, most of the effects look top notch. Many of them were improvised and some even use animal organs to create an authentic look. They also filmed on location in a mall in Monroeville that you can still visit today. The mall looks really creepy with no one in it but zombies. The mannequins look ominous and it just seems oppressive and overpowering.

I also really like the conflicting tones and the strong message within the film. One on hand, there are some really funny and lighthearted scenes with Roger and Peter messing with the zombies or all of them taking advantage of the luxuries in the mall. There are also scary and depressing scenes like the SWAT team raid in the beginning. Those people in the apartment building just wanted their dead to have some dignity and it backfired on them, getting them killed by their departed loved ones and the SWAT team. The difference in tone puts me a little off balance and feels different than zombie films today. Zombie films categorized as comedy tend to have some serious moments, but stay away from the truly depressing stuff. The commentary is biting and direct in its criticism of our society. The scene where zombies aimlessly mill around while the PA system tells them of deals is an obvious stab at the consumerism of our society and how it makes us no better than those brainless zombies. The four main characters aren't heroes, but are simply survivors. They don't really make an effort to save others and they use the mall as a way of escaping horrific reality in their moments of hedonism. They also tend to make their decisions based on emotion rather than logic, which proves never to be a good idea in a zombie apocalypse.

I did not like some aspects of this film. The pacing feels odd and there are definite plot holes. The acting leaves something to be desired, but it's kind of part of its cheesy charm. I really didn't like the woman or the way she was treated in the film. She, like Barbara from Night of the Living Dead, is completely useless and incapacitated by emotion to the point of literally doing nothing as a zombie comes near her. It's just frustrating to watch her not even move out of the way. She was left out of a lot of the action scenes because she stays behind, by herself usually with no weapons. I guess it's better than Barbara's constant hysterics, but it still irked me. The only intelligent thing she did was have her boyfriend teach her how to operate the helicopter in case something happened it him. There is a tiny scene that annoyed me because it didn't need to be there and the implications are troubling. Peter asks Stephen if he wants to abort Francine's baby. I thought it was weird and basically saying that these men are in control of her body. It's nice that the topic of abortion was brought up because Roe vs. Wade had happened not too long before that. However, the subject really wasn't explored or developed at all and this teeny tiny mention was just more problematic than it was worth.

This film and the original Night of the Living Dead set up many of the conventions and tropes we see even today in the zombie genre, both the good and the bad. So many of the zombie movies today have homages or responses to this film. I'm glad I watched it and it's important in the scope of the history of the modern zombie, but it wasn't my favorite film of the genre.",1348531200,,4563,4.487364620938628

814841,5,6304240554,"Filmmaker George Romero may not be able to claim that he created the ""zombie"",but it can almost be said that he created the ""zombie movie"",taking it away from its Haitian Creole roots and,borrowing from Richard Matheson's ""I Am Legend"",created a surreal tale of a race of hellish monsters emerging to prey upon late 20th-century America in his 1968 film ""Night Of The Living Dead"".Then,just ten years later,he re-invented his own creation in his ""Dawn Of The Dead"",combining an abundance of unabashed violent bloodshed,still a rarity in American cinema at the time,with on-target satire of the modern consumer culture. Needless to say,this movie quickly became an icon of horror movies.

It was opening night for the film at the moore theater in The Seattle Film Festival. I remember going berserk along with the rest of the crowd - it was like a party! Well, here it is, 2012, and I'm 53 (sigh) - I just bought the boxed edition of this and friends, after 33 years this film still KICKS ASS! Get past some of the Disco Clothes and Hair, and you're in for the ride of your life! The film works on so many levels that I don't think thar the word GENIUS is overused here at all. It's got Gore, laughs, satire, a terriffic score, great acting, and is stuffed throughout with little goodies like the actual military, bikers riding through a shopping mall, some of the goriest special effects you'll ever see, but most of all, a great script, story, and acting. It's a solid film from the inside out and does not depend upon the effects to make it work. It also gives you 4 likeable characters that you want to survive, you care about them from the beginning. I'm turned off by most horror because they seem to be about and aimed at a teenage perspective. Not this one.

814936,5,6304240554,"George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead is an unlikely masterpiece.  It had a very modest budget and only a couple months to complete.  Since they filmed in a real mall, they could only shoot late at night; making it tough for all personnel.  If that isn't bad enough, there wasn't enough money for any big name actors or actresses.  With so many odds against it, somehow the film found a path to success.  Word-of-mouth clearly had a lot of impact, because the film finally quenched horror fans thirst for gore. The prior success of Night of the Living Dead also had an affect on the success of Dawn of the Dead.  The film works well in many genres and it has a great script.  Dawn of the Dead is a spellbinding masterpiece that visually shows the labor of love and all the blood, sweat and tears that went into the film..

Multiple genres used in the film creates a broader fan base.  Dawn of the Dead uses horror and fantasy as a foundation.  Essentially, zombies are very eerie.  Unlike vampires, zombies have a very authentic notion to them.  The fact that they contain no ridiculous characteristics, fabricates a rational fear.  In essence, George A. Romero invented the ""flesh eating"" zombie (inspired by I Am Legend), which is a scarier idea than the typical mind controlled-voodoo zombies in earlier films.  Dawn of the Dead is brilliant because it uses themes of science and religious conviction as devices of horror.  It's never confirmed whether if it's a virus like in Resident Evil, or if it's the end times suggested by a character in the film named Peter, who said ""When there's no more room in Hell, the dead will walk the earth.""  Behind the dreadfulness, a luxurious fantasy is at hand.  Once you let go of the idea that zombies look like people, the film fabricates a fun proposal; survive by any means necessary.  It provides a fantasy that people can actually use guns to survive, as opposed to plainly murder in cold blood.  In the film, a bunch of rednecks and military soldiers use the scenario as a zombie hunting game, but the main characters find a fantasy of their own.  Imagine going to the mall and getting everything for free. Is it worth risking your life fighting through the hordes of zombies?

The film has a really smart script. All the characters are relatable and dynamic. Stephen is a soldier.  He has a quick wit, bubbly personality, and gets along with everybody.  At the beginning of the film he's very rational, but when he gets too comfortable with the situation, that's when he takes a dynamic change for the worst.  His foolish actions got him bitten; eventually he died.  Peter is an African American soldier.  He is even-tempered, reserved, and looked upon as knowing the answers.  He is probably the least dynamic character; however, his friendship with Roger is dynamic.  Francine is the only female among this particular group of survivors.  At the beginning of the film, she's very overlooked; by the end of the film, her importance was vital.  Roger is the most dynamic character, and the most important character.  He's Francine's boyfriend, and Stephen's best friend.  He's also the only one who knows how to navigate a helicopter.  Eventually, he teaches Francine.  As far as him being dynamic; he was perceived as the weakest character.  His change was so gradual, that as an viewer, we realized it after he turned into a zombie.  Unlike George A. Romero's other films in the Dead series, this one had an emotional attachment to the characters.  It's also attention-grabbing that an African American was portrayed as the lead character.  Besides the script containing interesting character, it also contains an interesting plot delivery system.  The characters didn't really have any plans, apart from surviving.  Instead of characters following a certain predictable plot, the plot followed the characters.  That's very effective when it comes to keeping the viewers' interest.

It's safe to say that Dawn of the Dead is George A. Romero's magnum opus. It's like Apocalypse Now, but in a urban setting and with zombies.  I'm a critic about everything, and there's nothing I say to criticize this film.  With a modest budget, and limited resources, this is the best film is could possibly be.  As far as the zombie genre is concerned, only a few films have inhaled the tour de force ""aroma"" of Dawn of the Dead.  Films such as 28 Days Later, Planet Terror and the Dawn of the Dead remake.  But George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, made in 1978, still sets high standards for films in any genre.",1332633600,3,4548,4.757033248081841

The bodies of the recently deceased are returning to life and their only resolve is to feast on the warm flesh of the living.

Is it any good?

With great merit writer/director George A. Romero has been branded ""Godfather of all Zombies"". This sequel to 1968's 'Night of the Living Dead' is saturated in gross-out gore, consumerism and plenty of laughs. An epic in the zombie genre and a must have for all horror fans!

814939,2,6304240554,"The 2 star rating is not for this classic film itself, which is arguably the greatest zombie movie ever made. It easily warrants 5 stars as far as I'm concerned.

This is just regarding this Blu-ray release. With the 4 disc Ultimate Edition(and believe me, it lives up to that title) available, this Blu-ray release is in many ways inferior right out of the gate due to it being just the theatrical cut of the film and some of the bonus features ported over from the Ultimate Edition with absolutely nothing new thrown in the mix. Naturally the movie does look better on Blu-ray in native 1080p, but frankly the DVD version looks damn good upconverted through a Blu-ray player anyway. Not to mention there's not much else you can do to improve the picture quality on 30+ year old low budget horror movie like this. It's hardly going to be a tech demo for high definition video like a newer 200 million dollar CGI action fest will be. Frankly, this is the problem with a lot of these Blu-ray releases of catalog films. Often they look so good on a DVD upcoverted through a Blu-ray player there's little incentive to upgrade to the Blu-ray release. The ""Beyond High Definition"" blurb on the case is laughable.

More effort needs to be put forth here to warrant a purchase. See the Blu-ray release of Lucio Fulci's ""Zombie"" to see how it's done. They went back to the original camera negative and painstakingly digitally restored the movie to create a Blu-ray release that would truly blow your mind. Oh, and they produced a crap ton of new quality bonus material to boot. That's Blu-ray catalog film done right.

In short, if you don't already own the Ultimate Edition, get that one instead of this half-assed Blu-ray release. The slight improvement in picture quality just isn't worth it when the massive 4-disc DVD version offers soooo much more.",1325894400,19,1846,4.673846153846154

815032,5,6304240554,"George A Romero's Dawn of The Dead is without a doubt the definitive zombie film it is my favorite of the series. It has believable Characters with good personalities. The Zombkies are the most believable I have seen. The Gore Effects by Tom SAVINI are the  best he is the master of gore. Unlike the last one Night of the Living dead where it takes place in a house this movie takes place in a Shopping mall whats not to love about that? I like the fact that Romero didn't kill off all the cast like in the last film. I understand that people need too die in horror films but there has too be at least one surviver. This film gos one step further then the last film in terms of gore its pretty Believable. I was so impressed by it this film is so creepy and scary at times but I can relate too the cast with them trying too survive it all cause its basically Survival of the fitest in this film. if you don't watch  your back the zombies will get you!!!!!!!!This movie is such a rollercoaster ride I was intrigued by this film its one of my altime favorite horror films and one not too be missed.

  This film is so unflinching in its realism its insane I love it. The perfect film too see with your buddies that like this genre. There are some Laughs too be had but for the most part George A Romero is pretty seriuos when it comes down too the Horror Genre. My favorite Part of this film was when the Zombies ate some of the biker Gang. The biker gang had it coming cause all they cared about in the mall was the things they didn't care about the people one bit.

  Zombies come in all shapes and sizes in this film. I can imagine the amount of Controversy this movie must have had when it came out cause it just doesnt let up in terms of the Gore!!!!!! If you have a weak stomach this isn't the film for you but if you can  handle it this film is definately a must buy not a rental. At a little over 2 hours this film is the longest of Romero's Zombie films. This is a movie that I will watch untill the day I die its that good. Gearge Romero has definetely come a long way since he first started making movies and this film is definetly withoubt a doubt his best work yet. I found this movie too be Spectacular a must own.

  The actors in this film were really good and did an exellent job portraying there characters I felt like this is something that was real because of how effective the gore effects of Tom Savini are that just shows that he knows how too make you question what you see.

But it is their efforts which guide them and still, they are dramatically left to pursue whatever life has left for them as livelihood. Unfortunately, there are others who want to create their own superflous banter and hedonism which spoil their plans. What would you fight for?

There are many emotions and concepts and thoughts this movie invokes:  the childish ""what if I were the only person left on earth and I could shopping-spree the mall!?"" and the ideas about humanity feeding on itself, Romero's theme of consumerism and greed that had consumed America in the 70's and 80's, suvival, relationships, friendships, you name it. This movie kicks butt.

Ken Foree is amazing as Peter. His delivery was outstanding as the badass muscle that ends up being full of humanity and courage.  David Emgee as ""Flyboy"" Stephen, awesome.  Gaylen Ross did a tremendous job conveying a sense of sadness, emptiness, and loss amidst trying to continue her relationship pregnant and in a world of despair.  Roger, played by Scott H. Reiniger was probably my favorite character.

The best dialogue of the whole film?

""Francine Parker: They're still here.
Stephen: They're after us. They know we're still in here.
Peter: They're after the place. They don't know why, they just remember. Remember that they want to be in here.
Francine Parker: What the hell are they?
Peter: They're us, that's all, when there's no more room in hell.
Stephen: What?
Peter: Something my granddad used to tell us. You know Macumba? Voodoo. My granddad was a priest in Trinidad. He used to tell us, ""When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.""

I love the character studies of the Dead Trilogy, how humanity comes together or falls to pieces in a crisis and how much actual humanity is retained. Good stuff!

If anybody tells you these zombie flicks are just blood and guts, they're nuts.

815113,4,6304240554,"I like this film very much. I think it`s an classic film. I think the zombies look good for the most part. I like the
story, acting, characters and music.

Picture quality: 4/5

Since 2003 i believe, i only saw it on the Dutch filmworks DVDs. which only had the Extended Cut and Argento
Cut. It had pretty poor picture and sound quality, which lacked any good details, and had very washed out
colours. I saw the Theatrical Cut for the first time today, on Blu-ray and the BD crushes it completely, in terms of
the picture quality.

I think the colours look very good and strong with detailed scenes at times. Ok, the red paint blood looks
better now, but i still think it looks like red paint. I think the close ups looked best, in terms of details. I think
the black levels looks pretty good, in the dark scenes and the black jackets to some of the people look good.

There is one problem, the HD master Arrow Video used, which was intended to be used on the previous DVD
versions has DNR baked into it. There is not so much film grain left in the film, that i could see from my sitting
position.

Even though it has DNR, i could still see details and such. Too bad the DNR was baked into the master. It would
have had more details if the DNR wasn`t used. I would have given it 5 out of 5, if there was more visible grain
in the picture.

Audio quality: 3.5/5

The Dutch filmworks DVDs only had only a simple, original Mono sound, which i didn`t think very much of. The
DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, which i used was an improvment over the Mono soundtrack. The music has a bit of
problems. Circa half the times when we hear the music, it sounds fine with some good bass.

The other times it sounds muffled, a bit boxy sounded. You know like someone holds a blanket of your speakers
and it sounds lifeless. The quality varies from song to song. Sometimes it sounds fine, sometimes it does
not. The dialog at times sounds tinny and have that boxy quality. It is also mixed too low compared to the rest
of the soundtrack.

The gunshot effects hardly have any bass except from some of the rifles and the M16 guns i believe. They have
some fine bass. The rear speakers are mostly used for music, bullets and some helicopters. In one scene,
they are used for very good effect when a gun is fired inside a room, and the bullets ricochets from left to right
rear speaker.

The rear speakers could have been used a bit more, but i guess they could have used it less, if they wanted to.
As i said before, my Subwoofer was mostly used for music and some gunshots that have fine bass. The few
explosions in this film sounds lousy and lack even a hint of bass. Too bad it wasn`t remixed better to sound

815115,3,6304240554,"This film was an interesting view into consumerism interwoven with horror and humor.  It shows how people have a belief that if we have material means met, our lives would be better.  The original Dawn of the Dead delivered on this idea.  People found this movie popular because of the fantasy of ""owning"" a mall. The film went further to show that even with mall ownership, the characters were still flawed and bored with having everything (all except the character Fly Boy Stephan).  The premise of the movie was totally excellent.
  Many people cite the fact that the ""blue-face-zombie"" look was not scary enough.  That may be true but the major flaw of the film was the use of the same zombies in multiple scenes (another continuity problem or lack of money to pay more people.)  For example, the lead zombies (the nurse, the guy holding the gun, etc.) showed up when Fran, Stephan, Roger and Peter got to the mall.  They were in the scene when the main protagonists pulled the trucks up to the mall doors (those zombies were outside.)  When our heros drove around the mall in the Volkswagon to secure and lock it down, those zombies were inside.  When the bikers opened the mall to looting at the end, those same zombies were there.  That didn't make sense because the main characters ""went on a hunt"" inside the mall after locking it down thus destroying those zombies earlier. The viewer is left to wonder if the zombies were twins because they showed up with Stephan after he became a zombie at the end.
  Most people forgive much of this because it was a low budget film. I still consider this a good film because of its humor and overall message.  People who watch George Romero films look to his films for the message AND the guts.",1301184000,,1742,4.574193548387097

whipping up zombie effects.

Another great extra is a tour of the mall where the film was shot. Ken Foree, who played one of the SWAT team

815117,5,6304240554,"The original Dawn of the Dead didn't make a big splash when it was released over 30 years ago, but over time society found out its true value. This 4 disc special edition is really the only one to get when it comes to this film. Featuring all 3 versions of the film plus a loaded documentary disc, this is one fans should NOT be without. For those who don't know, DOTD is about a world where zombies have overrun society, and while there are a slew of survivors all over the world, the point has come where life as we know it will come to an end. While the original Night of the Living Dead that was released in 1968 featured a world where zombies were the minority, this film picks up years later where zombies have taken over the majority of society, and whoever is left must fend for themselves. The movie focuses on 4 survivors who take refuge in a shopping mall and try to make a new life there, meanwhile later in the film tensions spikes as they know they cannot be comfortable forever and must fend off invaders.
Aside from great effects, fantastic over the top (for its time) gore, and an underlying statement about our zombified society, what really makes DOTD shine is its characterization. All 4 main characters are built up throughout the film and you begin to really care about them; the life they start to make in the shopping mall makes one wonder if they would do the same. George Romero has always had a touch for building good characters and this film is no exception. Critically acclaimed and arguably the GREATEST horror movie ever made (in my personal opinion, it absolutely is), this is one that no fan should be without and no avid horror fan should pass up.

Disc 1 includes the U.S. Theatrical version, which actually is George Romero's preferred version, running at 127 minutes you'll get the most well-balanced version of the film available. Includes all the gore and blood that was meant to be in theaters, as well as the genius soundtrack.

Disc 2 is the full extended version of the film which adds 12 minutes to the original length, running at 139 minutes. While the soundtrack to this version is the same, the movie features extra scenes but at times can just feel a tad too long; still though, because the movie itself is so great one wouldn't mind sitting in an extra 12 minutes. For me personally this is MY preferred version, but contrary to popular opinion, this is NOT the version George Romero himself prefers.

Disc 3 is the European cut of the film, and seems to be mostly everyone's LEAST cared for version of the film. And for good cause. The movie runs 118 minutes long and the soundtrack is greatly reworked for the European audience, featuring somewhat stranger ideas in terms of musical tension that comes in the form of funny synth sounds that while still workable, still takes away greatly from the original soundtrack which featured zombies walking and moaning to goofy ""carnival-like"" music that really made George Romero's ""zombie nation"" statement applicable and note-worthy. Furthermore, in this version, the ending is simply a black screen with credits, whereas in the other versions, credits were atop more zombie ""pranks"" with the same carnival type of music, that while on the surface sounds goofy, it still gave the film a pretty creepy touch that gets you smirking on the outside, while feeling a bit uncomfy on the inside.
The European version of this film is basically cut to make this more of a straight out action film rather than a psychological spine tingler that the other versions were so good at being. Classic director Dario Argento remade this version to appeal to European audiences, and while it does the job, more art-film enthusiasts may be turned off by it's almost complete lack of psychological creepiness.

Disc 4 features 4 different documentaries that fans of this film will absolutely pine over. 2 features are over an hour long each in length, and contain FULL cast and production team interviews all these years later, therefore it's VERY fun to see where all these actors are and how they've aged (may I say that the female protagonist of this film, Gaylen Ross, still looks just as gorgeous as she did 30 years ago! Wow!), including George Romero himself. Plus 2 shorter features that are home video shot, one featuring some cast members and zombies (the actors from way back when) going to the actual mall where the film was shot, as well as home videos made during the production of this film. All in all, the documentary feature gives fans a greatly detailed influx of info on this grand horror masterpiece.

At this price, it's an easy decision, if you're already a fan of the film, you owe it to yourself to add this to your cart IMMEDIATELY. And for those who have never seen the film, for the price listed this is one buy that will absolutely not let you down.",1296950400,9,4854,4.652680652680653

I had never seen this movie before and my wife and I are fans of zombie movies, so we threw this in with a bunch of movies we bought for the Halloween weekend. We didn't really know what to expect from it, other than we knew it is a cult classic. During the opening scenes, there were two things that were evident. One, the movie looks like it was filmed last week! Beautiful! The other, we thought maybe we had made a mistake because of the way the movie opens with a bunch of hectic scenes. Those fears soon subsided as the story starts to get going and we learn who the characters are that we are supposed to care about. Other than the odd opening, I'd have to say that this is my all-time favorite zombie movie, by far. But it's the quality of the remaster that really impressed me. The only movies I've seen that look this good for their age are the frame-by-frame remasters of the James Bond series. It was really hard to believe that this was a movie from 1978. It's about as close as you can get to going back in time. If you like zombie movies and haven't seen this one, you need to see it.

815224,5,6304240554,"Dawn Of The Dead (1978) is one of the great zombie movies ever made.  Now I'm talking about the original, of course.  George Romero once again delivers a great zombie movie.  It stars David Emge, Ken Foree, Scott H. Reiniger, Gaylen Ross, and Tom Savini.

Basically the movie is about some unknown pandemic that causes flesh-eating zombies to emerge.  This phenomena spreads throughout the U.S.  Four survivors hide in a shopping mall and find themselves fighting the zombies.  The movie is extremely gorey.  Extremely bloody.  It has great special gore effects by special effects guru Tom Savini, who also appears in the movie.  You'll see blood splatter everywhere.  Lots of gunfire.  Lots of violence.

The zombies are very basic looking.  The vast majority of them just have their faces painted with grey or blueish-grey makeup.  Since the movie had a budget of only about $650,000 and there were SO MANY zombies, this basic makeup had to do.  Besides that, there was no such thing as CGI back in 1978.  Had there been CGI, the zombies would have looked more realistic, but I'm not a fan of CGI for the most part.

This DVD has some good special features.  It's in widescreen format and is remastered in 5.1 DTS & Dolby Digital Surround Sound.  It also has audio commentary from writer and director George Romero, assistant director Chris Romero, special makeup effects artist Tom Savini, and is moderated by Perry Martin.  Also included are the theatrical trailers, TV spots, radio spots, poster and advertising gallery, a bio on George Romero, and a comic book preview.

If you like extremely violent zombie movies, then this George Romero classic should entertain you.  It's not a Halloween-ish kind of zombie movie, but it's highly entertaining nevertheless.",1286409600,,1766,4.972602739726027

I'm giving it two stars pretty much on Romero's name alone, as an innovator in the zombie genre. NOT because it's high cinema, which I really DON'T think it is.

To be frank, the movie seems anachronistic and rather tame by today's standards. Sure it was made in the 70's and for the time it was considered to be pushing the envelope. Today, well, it just doesn't hold up against modern zombie movies.

I mean, the zombies are just people in blue makeup. Terrifying, I know! (Not so much...) They shamble... Slowly. Like you could get away from them with a brisk walk! (Horrifying!) There was no tension. There was no foreboding terror. Not even a little good-natured shiver going down my spine. Really it was a few hours of boredom. I think at one point I even checked how much longer the movie had left to run (about 1/2 an hour), that how bored I was. I was waiting all movie for some serious zombie munching and was disappointed at its overall absence outside of the last 1/2 hour (and even that was fairly tame and movie-esque, in my opinion; though perhaps forgivable given the era of cinema it was released in).

I kept wanting the people to stop being dumb arses and go on a zombie killing spree. I mean, the zombies are slow. They have NO evasion skills. They have no ""strategery"" skills (yes, I know, I mean strategy, geez!). The humans have access to a gun store and about all the ammo they can possibly use. The reason they couldn't simply walk around methodically (and briskly!) decapitating zombies or blasting them in the skull with shot guns was WHAT now? I mean, if your first thought is survival isn't the object to eliminate the walking dead so they don't sneak up on you while you're using the can? But no, they just let the zombies go about their business for the first third of the movie.

This movie didn't frighten me. It didn't disturb me (unlike 28 Days Later, which was rather disturbing insofar as the ""infected"" kept vomiting blood and stuff all over the place). There was maybe one scene of a guy getting ripped apart for being a dumb arse and sticking his arm into a blood pressure monitoring machine's arm strap in the middle of an ongoing zombie invasion. Frankly he deserved what he got and I had zero sympathy for him. That and he was part of a roving band of marauders, so I had double the zero sympathy for him (what's two times zero?)...

Yeah, it may have been considered pioneering at the time, but today it's just a piece of tame, anachronistic tripe.

I have no problem whatsoever with zombie movies. I've watched and enjoyed many of them. Dawn of the Dead is a horrible movie. One of the worst I have ever seen.

The dialog is ludicrous. The actors are utterly unconvincing. The plot is absurd. The special effects are laughable (even for its time).

The makeup was the high spot and it wasn't all that great.

There were way too many shots of the dead wandering around. Cut them out, and this movie would be better (and 30 merciful minutes shorter).

I don't think I've ever seen a review less than 3 stars for this movie, and Roger Ebert, who is usually pretty rough on horror films, gave it a lot of praise.  Don't forget, he's the guy who along with his co-host the late Gene Siskel, devoted an hour long TV special to talking about how slasher films were undermining the moral character of America and were examples of cinema at it's worst.

Now that I've seen Dawn of the Dead I'm somewhat surprised.  It really is a terrible movie.  It's not scary, funny, disturbing or entertaining in any way.  It's just a big bore.  It has none of the elements that fans of horror films usually seem to go for: no good looking women, not much gore, not much comic relief, and not even any campy bad acting.  The acting is bad, but not in an amusing or entertaining way.  There are no known actors in this, and they have no acting talent at all.  They sound like they are just reading lines - no expression in their voices and body language is way off.  There's not even any nudity.

The gore and special effects are laughable.  The zombies are not even very gruesome-looking (some of the non-zombies are actually uglier) and the blood (what little there is of it) just looks like bright red paint.  This is just a total disaster in ever conceivable way.  It is not worth anyone's time to watch it.  I don't know how anyone who was involved in making this film ever had a career after this.  What I really don't get is why so many people like this movie so much.  This has had multiple DVD releases while so many other great horror movies have never even been released on VHS.

I'm just glad that I got this at my local library instead of buying or even renting it.  If I'd laid out any money at all to see this, I'd feel cheated.  It has to be one of the most overrated movies ever, even more than Titanic, The Exorcist, The French Connection, and Risky Business.

Though it does have the feel of 1978 (feels long at times), I still find it very entertaining. The flow and sound are masterful. It starts in total chaos and panic but soon creeps into a heart-pounding, grim mood that is just wrong!

815417,5,6304240554,"This ""Ultimate Edition"" is a fitting homage to the 1979 release of George Romero's second zombie film, Dawn of the Dead, a film which ""expands upon"" rather than supersedes his previous effort, Night of the Living Dead. In this pre-digital film, we are treated to the latest analog gore. I remember first seeing it at its first release, sinking into my seat and cringing at the gore. At the same time, the deadpan humor and heavy irony keep the brain cells alive.

What I notice now is the dramatically different style Romero uses in DD compared to NLD. Eschewing the documentary style of NLD, DD is much more conventional in its cinematography. However, as noted in the generous commentaries, Romero was developing his ideas through fast ""cutting"" (the old montage approach). NLD is, in my opinion, spookier, while DD is more of an ""in your face"" experience.

So, no digital effects, no outrageously flying bodies or weapons, no bodily transformations...just old-fashioned ""down-to-earth"" gore. The commentaries -- by Romero, producers, and actors -- are fun and informative. In the end, this DVD release provides a rich context to appreciating DD as an important juncture in film history and, perhaps, as an important cultural event.",1233273600,,1234,5.073891625615763

815520,5,6304240554,"George A. Romero discovered a universal truth: Zombies rock. What's not to love? Shambling, animated corpses with a taste for living flesh? Desperate survivors with trigger happy fingers decapitating said zombies with rusty machetes or well-aimed head shots? Zombies piling up like chords of wood? And the screaming!

It's like Christmas at the organ donor shop.

Romero's original ""Dawn of the Dead"" made in 1978 is a lot of things: horrifying, taboo-shattering, gory, and disturbing. It's also horror camp at its finest - skewering the mass consumer culture of the United States in our most shallow of decades: the 1970s.

Romero has a gleefully good time with his pack of survivors holed up in an indoor shopping mall. The slow-moving zombies that bang into the display cases or stumble up the escalators aren't so far removed from normal everyday mall shoppers - at least according to Romero.

Why do the zombies congregate at the mall? ""Some kind of instinct. Memory, of what they used to do. This was an important place in their lives,"" one of the characters informs us.

Yeah, even dead we like buying stuff at the mall.

But one thing the Romero film is not? Scary.

That's one reason why we're also fans of the much maligned 2004 remake by director Zack Snyder. That's a sacrilege in many quarters, but for pure fright - Snyder tops Romero. That's the truth. Romero's low-budget wonder is a classic - no doubt. It can be uncomfortable to watch, but there is more dark humor than actual chills. Romero focused his film on his wicked wit: satire instead of terror.

Snyder isn't interested in delivering a sardonic message. He wants to scare you. And damn it if he doesn't. His zombies - like the times we live in - are fast. There's no shambling here - but straight out sprinting.

The gem of Snyder's movie is the opening 10 minutes. It may be the most frightening sequence of any horror movie made over the last 20 years. It has a disjointed, sour flavor as if the orange juice you drink every morning has been spiked with cyanide.

Sarah Polley plays a nurse named Ana. She's at the end of a difficult shift at the hospital. All she wants to do is go home. Traveling home over washed out streets in a bland suburban tract, she arrives home for ""date night"" with her husband. They make love in their messy, little bed in their messy, little house.

Then it all goes to hell.

The little girl next door wonders in and lo and behold the lower half of her face has been chewed off. She creeps into the bedroom and Ana's husband jumps up concerned. But before he can react, she takes a bite of flesh out of his neck.

Ana locks the little girl out of the bedroom and then has a grueling life and death struggle as her husband dies and then reanimates as a zombie. It's bone rattling violence and by the time Ana gets into her car - her neighborhood, her world is in chaos.

It's absolutely chilling.

While the overall Snyder's film doesn't quite live up to the original (and the characters make some ridiculous decisions - especially at the end), Snyder delivers a zombie movie that belongs on the list of greatest undead flicks ever made - with Romero's original and the superb ""28 Days Later.""

The two movies follow the same premise - but are very different movies. That's why you can enjoy them both: turn to Romero for the horrifying satire (you can often overlook the rather awkward acting) and then lean on Snyder for some in-your-face terror (and for using Johnny Cash's ""Man Comes Around"" as an opening number).

Either way -- it's a great two for one.

Modern day critics have blasted the '70's soundtrack, FX, and shambling, seemingly harmless Zombies.  As to the '70's, it was made in the '70's, which was a seminal time for Horror.  Those slow moving Zombies may seem harmless, but they are relentless-Let your guard down for a second, You're toast.  I think Romero was deliberate in this, as in some scenes, after the Mall is secured, you forget all about them, yet they are still outside, mindlessly and patiently waiting for their chance to get back in.  Fast moving Zombies will never have the same menace.

The script is a good one, with fine performances by it's four lead actors, but Ken Foree is the heart and soul of the film.  The scene where he confronts Stephen (Flyboy) with a loaded weapon is simply brilliant, as is  the nightmarish scene in the basement of the Tenement where he dispatches the undead.

The gore-Yes it shows it's age, but it's still painfully cringe-inducing.

The Humour-Bikers versus Zombies in a pie fight.  Ludicrous, yet it cuts the unbelievably tense atsmophere, sort of like Craven did in ""Last house on the Left"".  A welcome respite.

Overall, very strong writing, direction, and acting.  The relationships the protagonist develop are quite believable and complex, and when two of them meet their demise, it is very emotional.

- Sure 'Dawn Of The Dead (2004) Remake' is a good action-packed film, I can't deny that, probably the best (and only) good Horror Film remake of this time out there.

-  Sure 'Shawn Of The Dead (2004)' is funny as hell, maybe the most clever horror comedy since ""Return OF The Living Dead""

- But more than sure 'Dawn Of The Dead (1978)' Is the best zombie movie so far, as a fan of the outtathagravewalkingcorpes flicks, having seen most of them, and owning all the above mentioned, there's no argue George A. Romero was at is peak here: Clever setting, interesting characters, cool effects (for the time, of course), and what it's most pretentios but yet so awesome: intelligent and believable plot that works both as an slowpaced action gory film and a criticism on society consumist and violence nature set in the apocalypse.

PROS: Anchor Bay has done an excellent job giving the movie what it deserves: Excelent package, 2 full lenght documentaries (you won't need anything else), interesting commentary tracks, a printed comicbook preview, all the versions of the film with audio variations including original mono, and some other minor but good extras for completist such as posters, trailer, on-screens promo material & bios, etc.

CONS: The only flaw I can see here is the lack of subtitle tracks, not only in languages such as spanish, french among others, but even not an english track is a great miss.

815628,4,6304240554,"After watching Night of the Living Dead, I decided to give Dawn of the Dead a shot. Right from the get go, I was hooked on the film. The movie follows Stephen, Roger, Peter, and Francine, who are trying to escape to Canada, away from the zombie epidemic plaguing the cities. Along the way, the group finds a shopping mall, and decides to make a stand in the mall.

I personally think the mall idea is brilliant. Honestly though, whenever I think of zombie epidemic, I think of malls. Malls in America are one of the most well stocked facilities capable of sustaining a small group for months with food, clothing, and all sort of entertainment.

The next cool thing about the movie is the fact that the mall they filmed in is an actually mall that exists in America. If I remember right, Romero shot at Monroeville Mall which is interesting for many reasons. One is that you'll see a lot of brand name companies which wouldn't be used in modern times and the fact that nearly every store somehow contributed to the efforts of the movie. For example, the characters went into Penny's for supplies, or a gun store, and even more surprising a bank. I think the fact that Romero was able to pull off shooting at an actual mall is a feat all by itself and I liked the movie all the better because of it.

The thing that separates Dawn of the Dead from other zombie films is that you grow attached to the characters in a small way. Throughout the film, I was rooting for many of the folks and by the end, I was sadden by the fact that they had to give up their mall due to looters and zombies overrunning the mall.

While waiting for the film in the mail, I decided to read over various sites. I was a bit surprised by the amount of articles outlining the fact that Dawn of the Dead is some sort of satire about America's consumerism. After watching the film though, I believe that it is a good zombie film and nothing else. I mean I guess you could make the connection that zombies, malls, and people are somehow connected, but in my opinion, who would give up a mall if there is a zombie epidemic? And not only that, the characters were careful to note that looters would most likely come to mall and they made necessary precautions but failed in the end.

Overall the movie is good. Personally I recommend buying all the Divimax Dead series as they are all good in picture and sound quality.

First off, the transfers.  They look good, the colors are bright and vibrant.
Sound: It gets an ""A"" from me.  I don't have a 5.1, so take that into consideration, but it still sounds good to me.
You get the theatrical version released earlier as a single disc, then the ""director's cut"" that had been released a few years back, the ""Argento cut"" AKA European edition AND Roy Frumkes' Document of the Dead.  Special features abound, interviews, multiple commentaries (one per movie, just to clarify) and featurettes.

Set in Philadelphia, this tells of four SWAT-team members that hide out in a mall from the living dead, while taking advantage of the mall and getting kicks outta it, too.
That alone should let you know that this movie is awesome. Imagine what it would be like to shoot down the flesh-eating undead in a massive mall! This movie has everything from the zombie horror of blood-splattering and flesh-eating to thrilling action to slapstick comedy. The movie goes from scary to funny to sociopolitical all in its two-hour run.
""Dawn of the Dead"" is, in case I didn't state it enough, an extraordinary movie. What other zombie flick offers shooting zombies down in an open field at the break of dawn, a blue-skinned Hare Krsna zombie and makeup artist legend Tom Savini in a leather-clad biker gang riding their motorcycles in the dead of night?
Yep, this movie goes from the slaying of the undead to genuinely ironically funny moments, such as slapping a whipped cream pie in a zombie's face, or the scene where two of the guys take the money from a register and smile for the security camera (that one's a good laugh!).
And just to prove that this zombie movie doesn't disappoint, there's plenty of the red stuff getting splattered from zombies and victims alike, alongside their consumption of flesh! And yeah, I'm sure you're aware of the social commentaries on the buyer's consumption at the mall. George A. Romero's good at the double-entendres in the plot like that, he's quite an intelligent film-maker.
""Dawn of the Dead"" is definitely a special movie, and isn't necessarily one of those movies that you'd pop in every week or so. It's an experiece, and a stunning one at that, both visually and at times intellectually. So kudos to Mr. Romero, who knew what he was doing and never sold out, you made a great movie!

Night Of The Living Dead deserves this honor even if
technically it isn't quite true.

But it wasn't until almost ten years later Romero
really put the zombie in pop-culture with the much
heralded Dawn Of The Dead in 1978. This film took
the trapped survivor scenerio of NOTLD up a notch by
putting in the more modern day setting of a typical
American pleasure, the indoor shopping mall. DOTD,
while offering pretty much the same living character
design, this time made the zombies more in number,
appearance, and graphic actions. It was this film with
instead of it's shades of gray now bursting in bloody
color that put the Zombies on the map permanently.
It's a great film that not only fleshes out the characters
at a good pace (though at times it does seem a little
too detailed in that department), but truly shown that
zombism has no cultural bounds. Not only did the Americans
just eat up this new genre, but on the opposite side of the world, Europeans did so even more, especially the film-making members of Italy.

When Romero wanted his film to be presented over there,
he enlisted the help of Italian filmaker Dario Argento to
re-edit it for Italian audiences. Argento slimed down bits
of comedy & slower dialouge, gave it a faster soundtrack, and
changed it's name to Zombi. This may have been one of the
most important effects this film ever could of have. Not only was the film an even bigger success overseas, but it inspired many
Italian filmmakers to continue what Romero started. Before
Romero even thought of his 1985 third installment Day Of The Dead, Italian director Lucio Fulci brought a year later his unofficial (yet honored by Romero himself) sequel called Zombi 2. This film showed what the worldwide Zombie outbreak was doing half a world away from that mall. But this time the zombies were far more graphic and the gore and pacing were turned up by leaps & bounds. It was this film along with Dawn that gaveway for the Italian Zombie craze of the 1980's. Like how the Italians created their own successful version of the classic American Western ten years earlier, they once again did it but with our Zombies. What followed was a barrage of great Zombie films that never seemed to be carbon copies of Romero's then two classics, but new ways of defining the genre. Unfortunately by '85 with Day Of The Dead, Romero seemed to be beaten at his own game by them with Day's lackluster audience response (though over time, it in itself has become the classic it deserves). But all of this couldn't of happened without Romero & his original update of Dawn Of The Dead. It was that film that launched a thousand ships filled with the living dead.

...And now a review of the 2004 DVD Ultimate Edition Anchor Bay release:

Without a doubt, this is one of the most exhaustive releases any one film has ever received, and it's completely deserved. The film that started the Zombie craze that still lives to this day, gets an amazing FOUR disc set that shows you every little piece of it's history and formations. With this set you get THREE different versions of the film: the US theatrical, the extended Directors Cut, and the rare Dario Argento European cut known as Zombi. Each version has it's own merit and differences that never, ever feels like release overkill. All has been fully remastered to the hilt, with different commentaries for each equally entertaining (though it would have been nice to have an Argento one for the European cut). No lack of movie presentation here, you get it all.

Extras? Wow, you got them! Documentaries, commercials, trailers, stills, photos, home movies, easter eggs, Jeez this thing is packed! In fact, I couldn't even think of what it's missing. All enclosed in a great box-set with wonderful artwork and an errie front cover to boot. C'mon, it even comes with a comic book, for cryin' out loud! Now I know Anchor Bay/Starz is known for double-dipping their audience, but it has never been as necessary as this one. If you own any of their previous releases, sell them and add it to the pot to get this. Something of this quality to me has only been seen for a franchise, not a single film release, so you can tell just how impressive this set is. So if you're a fan of any level to the original Dawn Of The Dead, or the genre of Zombies itself, your collection is NOT complete till you own this. I personally have never given a DVD release a full 10 before, and I feel once you get this you might do the same.",1207440000,,5055,4.58121546961326

this again last night.  I love this movie true the zombies look fake
especially when compared to Fulci's classic ZOMBIE but WHO CARES!!!
We have a story with characters that I found myself caring about
a great script and find directing. Sir Romero has always been great at
adding humor to his HORROR and D.O.T.D. is no exception from the beginning
we have chaos for the entire United States is being plagued by zombies
and the few humans that are alive must leave but to where???
Our four heroes steal a helicopter and find a abandon shopping mall.
We are already 20 min. into the movie but this is where it starts for
me for this is where I found myself caring about the four stars and hoping they all make it alive(which is unusual for your buddy Clint
for normally I say LET THEM DIE!) When two of our heroes GET IT
so to speak I was angry!  The way this movie builds up and ends
was funtastic(sic) and I am truly glad to have in my HORROR COLL.
If you are not big on GORE(shame on you) than please stay away
however if you can handle heads chopped off by helicopter,limbs
being eaten and children being blown away by a machine gun than
by all means watch DAWN of the DEAD for it is ONE of our greatest
HORROR films especially for 78(the awesome HALLOWEEN and INVASION of the
BODY SNATCHERS also came out this year) the ultimate edition is the
only way to go on this flick for it has in depth views on the making
and of course all three versions of the film(I prefer the extended
version myself Romero's dir.cut is 2nd and you can have the awful
Dario Argento cut LOVE YA DARIO STILL) anyway if you love HORROR

815668,5,6304240554,"DAWN OF THE DEAD is a classic horror film although only a short time has passed since it was released. With a remake in the works it's important to go back and take a look at the original. And it's a horror film that loses nothing with time.

The story picks up where the original left off, a world where flesh eating zombies are roaming the countryside in search of fresh kill. This plague, which is never explained as to how it began, has multiplied and now the ratio of zombies to live humans is about equal.

Enter a pair of S.W.A.T. members (Ken Foree and Scott Reiniger) who have tired of hunting down these zombies. Reiniger plans on escaping the city with a friend and his girlfriend (David Emgee and Gaylen Ross), a pilot and a producer for the local TV station.
They four set off to find a safe haven and discover a world gone mad along the way, with order destroyed and hunting parties roaming the countryside.

As they fly, they come across an abandoned mall and land on the roof. Noticing the obvious pluses of taking the mall over, blocking the entranceways and staying put, they make their play. But taking out a mall filled with these creatures is not an easy task.

Blocking the doors with trucks from a nearby freight company and then dispensing of the zombies within, the four find it a home away from home. One casualty in their conquest leaves the other three enjoying the spoils of war and soon finding themselves bored.

The three reinvigorate their will to live, as Ross learns to fly the helicopter and they monitor the radio in the hopes that there are other survivors. When a call comes in they almost invite the callers, but then discover that it's only a band of marauding bikers on the move, raiding any and everything in their path. A battle ensues in which not only the bikers but the zombies reinvade the mall as well.

What has been most talked about with this film is the fact that it is more than a straight on piece of gore filled horror. Director George Romero has used the mall and the creatures as a metaphor for the mindless zombie like shoppers seen everywhere in this country, evident in today's malls as much as it was in 1978 when this film was made.  Go to any mall in the land today and walk around looking at the shoppers after seeing this flick and you will be sure to see one or more characters come to life before your eyes.

While a horror movie doesn't have to rely on gore, this movie was one of the first to utilize it, garnering it an X rating had it actually been submitted. Relegated to midnight showing across the country and no newspaper advertising, it still gathered a cult following that included the likes of Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel.

The movie takes the day to day spots that we all go to each week and turns them into the most horrific of locations. With this in mind, we are put upon not in a castle or haunted house, but a shopping center that contains all that we feel we need or want. It is a well lit and mundane location, a spot where we are offered muzak and water fountains, only to have it tainted by the horrors of these creatures.
We are taken into a world filled with fear of the unknown, of a future that may not exist. And we are given a chance to look at ourselves in a different light. And at the same time, we scared to death by both what we may be and by what may happen.",1205366400,,3359,4.319047619047619
815669,5,6304240554,"One of the greatest horror films of all time, director George A. Romero's masterpiece gets the high def treatment.  Anchor bay has given the film every other kind of treatment as well, maybe not as much as the Evil dead series though.  For a film like this I really don't mind double dipping.  If your looking for extra features I'd go with the Ultimate edition which contains the U.S theatrical version, extended version, European version, and a ton of extras.  If you want the most pristine transfer go with this blu ray version.  I'd suggest both, and this blu ray title is reasonably priced when compared to other titles.
Another thing I've found with blu ray titles is to buy them online via Amazon or other sites, the prices in the store are even more ridiculous.
Most are familiar with the story's plot, zombies are taking over and we follow four survivors in there helicopter to the mall where they try to adapt and make a life for themselves.  Besides being a freaky horror film with real scares and gore it's writer/director George A. Romero using satire to make a statement in 1978 about American consumerism, people die , turn into zombies and are drawn to the mall to subconsciously walk with there zombie strut with their blank facial expressions, ready to ""consume"".",1204588800,,1281,4.721973094170403
815670,5,6304240554,"I have heard this referred to as ""the ultimate zombie movie"", and cannot disagree. It's got everything you could ask for in a horror movie: great acting, a surprisingly complex plot for a movie of its type, wonderful sardonic humor, top-notch gore effects, and perhaps the greatest location ever for a horror movie.

The mall where this movie was filmed, Monroeville Mall (just outside of Pittsburgh), is a few minutes from where I live and has been sort of a ""focal point"" of my life, like the zombies in the film (sad). It was a great delight watching a movie made in a place I am so familiar with. I was a kid when the movie was made and I had a great time strolling down memory lane with the zombies. I saw the candy store and fountain I loved as a kid, and delighted to see the indoor skating rink I one took lessons at covered with shuffling zombies. The courtyard surrounding the big white clock I loved as a kid was now littered with dead bodies. Bikers, the undead, and our heroes roared and wandered over the tile floor that I was so familiar with, and both the heroes and the marauding bikers go on a ""shopping spree"" through the department store that has been there since the early 1970s. What fun to watch and remember! On the commentary, which is very enjoyable, George Romero stated that he knew the people who owned Monroeville Mall and when he toured it for the first time, he thought that one could hole up in the mall indefinitely, as everything you needed was there. That, he said, was the inspiration for this movie, which has deservedly become a classic. (I have also read that this was the first totally enclosed shopping mall, though I don't know if this is true). There have been so many zombie movies made that it's become its own subgenre of horror, but I've never seen any quite like this one.

Tom Savini, also a Pittsburgher, is also on the commentary and tells us that this is the film that made him the king of gore. In the commentary track, he described how many of the effects were done. As I said previously, the kills are imaginative and top-notch. One zombie gets a screwdriver through the ear, a biker gets his intestines pulled out and eaten, and there are many ""head shots"", or people literally getting their heads blown off. Savini also plays a biker and a stuntman in the film.

Romero does an excellent job at satirizing the shopping or ""me"" culture that we were entering at the end of the 1970s. Materialism and consumerism are very strong undercurrents in the film, and are done very well. The sight of zombies shuffling around a mall in time to happy, perky Muzak, trying on hats, and generally shuffling around the stores moaning in delight is simply hilarious.

Would I have liked this movie so much if I weren't so familiar with the location? Maybe not quite as much, but it's still very enjoyable. I think it cements Romero's reputation as King of the Zombie Movies.",1203638400,,2916,4.517045454545454
815671,5,6304240554,"There are a lot of things I love about this movie. I love the dialogue about the zombies including ""When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth."" I love all the gore scenes; like toward the end there is an awesome gore scene where the zombies are ripping some guy apart and showing his guts. It even has the classic look of the 70's! Not long after the original, the zombies are still coming back to life and feeding on the flesh of the living. A group of friends named Stephen, Peter, Roger, and Francine leave Philadelphia in a helicopter and see that the epidemic is worldwide. They soon take refuge in a huge mall and make themselves at home. Soon, more zombies get inside the mall and they must fight for their lives.

After the events of ""Night of the Living Dead"", the zombies have taken over every city in the country causing chaos and mayhem among the living. A elite SWAT team led by Peter (Ken Foree) with his crew Roger, Fran and Stephen seek shelter at a mall somewhere in Pennslyvania to find refugee from the walking dead. They also end up having to fight for their lives from the zombies that are also inside the mall, So they decide to get whatever they can from inside the stores of the mall to stay alive especially food and weapons, Little do they know that an army of bikers are coming to pay them a little unfriendly visit, Not only do they have zombies to deal with but now they have to battle the biker gang for control of the mall.

The all time greatest zombie movie next to ""Night of the Living Dead"" ( 1968)! George A. Romero has wrote and direct a stunning sequel to his classic zombie movie and has been considered to be even better then it's precessor by some fans. The movie combines gruesome violence, gore and social satire with some average acting by the cast, this motion picture was originally given an ""X"" by MPAA but fortunately it was released unrated into theaters and was the first time in years that a movie was released without a rating but with a warning that said ""No one under 17 will be admitted"". The movie was a minor success in theaters and drive-ins with flavorable reviews especially by Roger Ebert whom admired this movie and called it ""An American Horror Classic"", the movie has became one of the most often imitated but never equaled horror movies of all time! no words could describe how great this movie is, you have see it for youself,  if you haven't seen it go to your video store to and pick up the original classic ""Dawn of the Dead"", the remake was good but can't surpass the original.

The ultimate 4-Disc edition contains the U.S. theatrical cut, the director's cut, the Argento-produced Euro cut, and a documentary with audio commentaries by the cast and crew, publicity materials, Poster-and-still galleries, interviews, Easter Eggs, and biographies. The soundtrack by Goblin is a funky and fun rock music score mainly in the Euro and Director's cuts and a more somber one in the U.S. cut, this is a a must have soundtrack and perfect for halloween parties.",1199664000,2,2367,4.5754716981132075

815753,5,6304240554,"Picking up after the events of ""Night of the Living Dead,"" in which unknown forces caused the bodies of the recently deceased to return to life in search of live, human prey, ""Dawn of the Dead"" instantly slams us into a world crumbling in confusion, panic, and desperate violence. As people break their ties and scatter to survive, one band of four, a helicopter pilot, his pregnant girlfriend, and two swat team members, take refuge in a shopping mall surrounded by the flesh-eating dead. Perhaps they can take control of the already infested mall, but what then?

In 1968, George A. Romero shocked the world with his apocalyptic vision, ""Night of the Living Dead."" The black and white, low-budget film became a phenomenon that spawned remakes, countless copycats, and 3 excellent sequels, the first of which came eleven years later. That first sequel was ""Dawn of the Dead,"" and it would seem that most zombie fans consider it to be the best film of its kind. Loaded with satire and comic-book violence, some, Romero himself for example, do not even consider it a true ""horror"" film. Its extreme action and over-the-top look and style make it far more fun than scary to many, but I'd count myself among those who feel that there are definitely some genuinely horrific moments and themes throughout. But, whether you're watching it for fun or fright, this is a movie that is more than it seems, and the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" definitely deserves a place among the greatest films ever made. If you're a zombie fan, you know this is a must own. If you're not, and especially if you haven't even experienced the genre, make sure you give this one a look before committing yourself against it. Be prepared for some wild and gory stuff, yes, but try to look beyond it as well.

Dawn was followed in 1985 by a sequel that is good as part of the series, but far less enjoyable (in my opinion), ""Day of the Dead."" Day was followed by the most recent sequel, ""Land of the Dead,"" in 2005. Land was an excellent installment in the series. One year before that, a remake of Dawn was released without the involvement of Romero. It's an excellent film in its own right, but definitely tailored to modern sensibilities. All action and very little substance, and I'm not a fan of its fast-moving, purely disease-infected zombies. With the new wave of zombie and zombie-like films that have been coming out recently, the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" has yet to be topped. Though, I have to give special points to ""Shaun of the Dead."" It comes highly recommended as well.

There is truly no better way to own ""Dawn of the Dead"" than in the 4-disc ""Ultimate Edition"" from Anchor Bay. You get three beautiful, widescreen versions of the film, each on its own disc with a different commentary track and extras, and a disc full of documentaries as well. Disc One is Romero's true cut, the U.S. Theatrical version, along with a great commentary by Director George Romero, the legendary make-up/effects man Tom Savini, and Assistant Director Chris Romero (George's wife). Also on Disc One are TV Spots and Theatrical Trailers, Radio Spots, a Poster and Advertising Gallery, a George Romero bio, and a comic book preview. Disc Two offers up the Extended Version. This is coupled with an audio commentary by Producer Richard P. Rubinstein. Most interesting is the very dated Monroeville Mall commercial which is also included along with a Behind-the-Scenes photo gallery, a memorabilia gallery, and production stills. Disc Three presents the European Version of the film. This is a more straightforward horror cut of the film from the hands of Dario Argento. Disc Three also includes one of those always fun cast commentaries, and we are lucky enough to get all four of the brilliant lead actors together here for this one! We also get a Dario Argento bio, a home video and soundtrack art gallery, an international poster and advertising gallery, an international pressbook gallery, U.K. TV Spots, international theatrical trailers, and an international lobby card gallery. Disc Four is where the documentaries are at, and here we are treated to: The Dead Will Walk, a great new documentary including interviews with just about everyone you'd hope to hear from; Roy Frumkes' Documentary of the Dead, a fascinating documentary actually filmed during the making of the film; On-Set Home Movies from a most appreciated zombie extra, Robert Langer; And a great tour of the Monroeville Mall with one of the stars, Ken Foree. There's also a bizarre little Easter Egg on the disc. At least, I think it was on Disc Four. After watching so much material on 4 different discs, it can be hard to keep track!

The DVD set comes in sturdy, fold-open cardboard packaging with a slip case, DVD guide with mall map, and a neat little comic book teaser that illustrates the first part of the film (ending right when they arrive at the mall).

815761,5,6304240554,"I first watched Dawn of the Dead years ago when I bought the VHS version with the extended version and extras, a two VHS set. About a few years ago I bought the Dawn of the Dead dvd version, but found out this was the American release and not the full extended version. It was missing the entire police station looters scene, which I felt was a critical point in the movie.

Very happy to finally own the full dvd set and see the extended version as it was in dvd quality. The other versions included with the set are great as well, especially the dvd showing the making of the movie with the cast.

For the movie, I still feel this is one of the rare zombie theme movies that dwells on the people more than the zombies. Not to give away any spoilers for anyone who has not seen the movie, the movie starts out like any other zombie film, there's a unknown outbreak of a virus returning the dead back to life.

Shortly into the movie we meet all of the main characters and they make a final break to freedom from the zombies. They find a safe haven, a new at the time indoor shopping mall. What takes place next is a twist from typical zombie movies. The movie starts to heavily focus on the people, who are now somewhat trapped in the mall. It's covered with all of the items they need but at the same time, it's also their prison.

We start to realized that even with all of the material items, without freedom, there is little happiness. During the end of the movie this is covered again, where a problem occurs when Steve fights for the mall since ""we took it, it's ours"" from other intruders.

As a side note, the characters in this movie feel like real everyday people rather than in most zombie movies such as Day of the Dead, where everyone is not friendly nor have any emotion. Dawn of the Dead is one of my favorite horror films for this reason.

On the topic about gore and fx, for 1970's horror it's actually pretty well done, hats off to Tom Savini. For people new to the movie, it's going to look very cheesy, with melted crayon looking blood and gray faced zombies. Also the acting is not great at times, in the extras dvd it was mentioned that the casts was largely new to acting.

Overall it's a great horror movie that has deeper meaning than a typical zombie or horror film. The story and plot is great, at times feels really slow but also has some good action as well. For gore fans there's some brutal scenes, nothing that can over top the current gore but still gets me cringing. The crayon blood looks bad but I heard it was done to make the movie feel like a comic book which bright blood instead of a natural darker colored blood.",1192579200,,2655,4.276892430278885

815859,3,6304240554,"Okay people, call me stupid, call me crazy, call me whatever you want, but to be completely honest I don't think this movie is anywhere near as good as Romero's other Living Dead films, and that includes Land of the Dead (Unrated Edition) and there are a few reasons for that.

Night of the Living Dead (Millennium Edition) is better because it captures the racial tensions of the time much more effectively than Dawn of the Dead. In Night, the black and white characters fight with each other constantly, ending up bringing about the destruction of both parties. The acting in Night was far better than what we got in Dawn, and the films time was used more effectively, and by that I mean there wasn't any filler in it.

Day of the Dead [Blu-ray] is better because it is easily the scariest of the four, has the best effects, and really shows in a chilling way the way people collapse without any outside authority and order to keep them in check. It explores the zombie virus much more than Night and Dawn and sheds some light on just how bad the situation is for the survivors. The underground setting is very chilling. The lighting, the enclosed halls, the chained up zombies in every other room just gives you an overall sense of dread. Dawn of the Dead was mostly in the open in a familiar setting (a shopping mall) and with the lights always being on. Plus the zombies were hardly scary with their blue face paint and their swaying back and forth.

Land of the Dead (Unrated Edition) is better because out of the four its probably the darkest and creepiest one of all. it shows the world of the undead in a very depressing and hopeless way and how the few survivors left take advantage of each other in order to enhance their own standard of living.

Dawn of the Dead, although good, is not a great movie. As a pure horror movie, it fails to deliver enough scars and frights to keep modern horror fans interested (and before you go off on me, know that i found Night of the Living Dead very scary). The setting is too bright and wide open, very few times are our characters actually caught in an enclosed and dark place, and even when they are it's normally one or maybe two zombies chasing them. As a social commentary, Night of the Living Dead blows it completely out of the water. Race is hardly an issue in this movie, and although I understand it's about consumerism, consumerism just isn't that big of a deal anymore so it dates the movie considerably. Where this movie really shines is in its hummer. Ironically the movie that so many call scary is funnier than it is frightening. Zombies being hit in the face with pies and beer bottles is funny no matter who you are. As all three put together, horror movie, social commentary, and comedy, it's a pretty decent movie with its good and bad moments. it may not be great, but it is a must see for any zombie fan. if you've read this review, please leave a comment.

This is IMO the finest horror film of the 20th Century, and I've watched a lot of them, believe me.  Also the finest George Romero has ever done.  If you have a strong stomach and an active mind, this movie is for you.  The only complaint I'd have is I've watched an unabridged version and seen a couple moments edited out of this one.  On the + side, there are a lot of interviews etc. on this version that are definite additions.

For those interested in a more literary sense, it's really an allegory comparable to Orwell's ""Animal Farm,""  a story about American society and corruption resulting from greed.  It's also a period piece, inasmuch as its setting is the lone survivors of a plague take refuge in a shoppng mall, back when shopping malls were a new thing (imagine that!).

But if you don't care bout that literary mumbo-jumbo, the movie is still horrific and full of classic horror moments.  There is not a movie like this out there now, and not likely to be again, AFAIK.

--There is only one detractor to this DVD version worth mentioning, and it's a big one.  If possible you should definitely get the uncut version, ro perhaps an ""editor's version"" of this, since the ""American Theatrical Release"" version had small but significant parts censored.  They were mostly little parts portraying the government in a bad light, imagine that.",1190764800,,1449,4.653543307086614
815861,5,6304240554,"George Romero can rest assured that his zombie classic will not become dated over time, despite advances in special effects, cinematography, and makeup because Dawn of the Dead is in a league of its own in terms of story, characterization, themes, and overall ambience.

The success of Romero's ""Dead"" films lies in an often duplicated trait of horror films: isolation.  It's something that Romero has mastered to a tee.  While seemingly simple, the concept of keeping the characters in an abandoned shopping mall with a bunch of zombies creates a slight fear among its viewers, whether your watching it at home or in a theater.  It's been repeated time and again, but Romero's ability to isolate his characters is a hallmark of his films.

Romero's characters are also more complex than those in a basic horror film.  While traditional horror films have characters suffer from pure stupidity, Romero is more interested in human instincts and characters succumbing to their own vices or even their own primal urges.  This is found in the way the survivors decide to not only explore, but get more than they need in the shopping mall.

Besides being a wonderful horror film, however, it's so much more, as other viewers have noted.  I think no other horror film addresses the concept of consumerism, down to the point of comparing shoppers to zombies.  The film's finale is riddled with irony - and you might even be granted a smirk here and there.

As for its timelessness, beyond the film's themes, Romero has created a film that, even if effects don't date well (and they actually do pretty well, especially for the time, gotta love Savini),  feels terrifying.  I think being trapped in a store is one of those nightmares everyone has.  This film may be the reason why.",1190592000,,1771,4.840531561461794

FOr one, the film is very dated, making it hard for us to take the zombies seriously. But that's alright. I understand it is 30 years old. What I don't tolerate is Romeros social satire. It might be because everybody talks about it, but it seems about as subtle as a zombie in a strip club. We get already. Zombies want to come to the mall. Zombies are mindless. Humans are like zombies. That means... wait for it... We are a mindless consumerist culture. Wow. Thanks for the insight. In spite of this the film is interesting and well made. It just seems like Geore sacrificed the brooding, oppresive tone for a more comical one. I understand that bad stuff goes on and there is some great, shocking gore, but, overall, it just seems like people give the move a bit too much credit.

It is also spine-chillingly funny, making blunt comparisons between the dead-eyed, gore-loving zombies and vapid American consumers. (Next time you're at a mall, the impression will be hard to shake.) But for all its satirical wit, ""Dead"" also features riveting action sequences, culminating in the final showdown involving soldiers, bikers, and endless waves of the undead. Tom Savani's ghoulish effects are not for the faint of heart, so be sure you're in the mood for explicit slaughter.",1183420800,,640,5.41
815934,4,6304240554,"I wasn't going to write about this movie, because I'm not sure that I really have anything to say about it that hasn't been said by 40 million other people. But as I was creating this site I noticed that nearly every horror review I wrote mentioned it in some way, and I thought I should make some comment on it. I also realized that I would then have to update the links on all those horror reviews. Drat!

The movie opens with chaos at a television station. A talk show is being interrupted as the cameramen and studio people shout at the man being interviewed. This scene, while cleverly delivering crucial exposition, also effectively conveys the panic and disorder overtaking society. There is just something that says ""society is falling apart"" about a television show, normally so scripted and controlled, devolving into chaos, and behind-the-camera people, whose entire profession depends on being quiet and staying off camera, shouting and disrupting a broadcast.

Even this scene abounds in small details that seem disturbingly true-to-life and while also helping to fill in the backdrop of the world this film is positing. The station manager is broadcasting the locations of rescue stations that he knows have closed, likely sending people to their deaths, because he wants to be seen as purveying hope. One of the cameramen says to Francine [Gaylen Ross] that she should go ahead and leave. He just stands there calmly, and one wonders: why has he given up on himself so easily?

The movie then switches to a housing project overrun with zombies. It begins to focus on a prejudiced cop who is beginning to lose his grip in the face of the rising zombie threat. This sequence is poignant in showing a man who is trying use his own prejudices about another racial group as a way of holding on to reality! Strange, unsettling, but also uncomfortably true-to-life.

You'll just have to get used to the fact that this is all happening accompanied by significant gore.

The four main characters soon assemble in their helicopter and take off. Their aerial perspective allows the film to serve up a lot of exposition about the general state of the country as the zombies take over. In this case we have a bunch of rural folk who seem to be treating the entire thing as some sort of hunting party, having a picnic, kids running around, passing around drinks, and occasionally stopping to shoot a zombie. They are soon joined by a bunch of jovial National Guard folks who essentially do the same. These scenes, including the ones in the television station and housing project, go very far to establish the different ways that the country is responding to the crisis. Compare this to Zack Snyder's 2004 remake, which stayed in the perspective of the main characters from the start and never wavered, thus losing the wider context of the world the main characters are struggling to survive in.

After a brief interlude at a fueling station, our quartet arrive at the shopping mall. Quickly realizing that they could hole up here for a nearly indefinite amount of time in relative safety, they decide to stay. There are a number of survival tableaus and schemes in which the characters essentially ""shop,"" but what interests me most here is the character development.

As they fight zombies to furnish their home in the upper floors of the mall, certain tensions between the characters develop. Stephen [David Enmgee], the helicopter pilot, seems to be jealous that he isn't as cool as the other two guys, and wants to be able to use guns and be cool like them. Scotty [Scott Reiniger] eventually becomes a bit of a daredevil, wanting to show off his skills, which leads him to make some rash decisions that put himself and others in danger. Near the end he becomes more and more mentally unstable and unable to recognize how hyped-up and volatile he is. Meanwhile, Peter [Ken Foree] stays collected, while Francine [Gaylen Ross] slowly becomes more focused and able to handle and protect herself. Romero's zombie movies have always had the distinction of really taking the situation seriously, and providing a lot of attention to the psychological effects the zombie takeover would have on his characters, which make his films richer in both depth and emotional heft, as these characters all have flaws and weaknesses. Some of them overcome them, while some do not. To me, these characters and the way they develop are what set this film apart, and make it truly fascinating. Compare this with the characters in the 2004 remake and how it is shown that they deal with the reality of the collapse of society; they make a game of shooting the zombies that look like celebrities. Whereas the characters in Romero's original bring their neuroses with them into the mall, and he gets a lot of tension and resonance out of how these petty tendencies endure even in the face of the end of the world. The characters in the remake simply get used to their situation and try to pass time. The remake is a great thriller, but just doesn't have the resonance of the original.

A lot of people hate what they consider to be the slapstick comedy that occurs when the bikers invade the mall at the end-particularly the pie-in-the-face scene. It doesn't bother me. In fact, I thought it was a successful continuation of the theme, as it follows the line of degrees of obliviousness to the real threat. We, the audience, by that time, have learned not to underestimate the zombies, and I found it affecting to watch the foolish bikers do silly things like the pie in the face and the blood pressure machine, as it shows the downside to their casual and mocking attitude toward life, and how people with that attitude can really screw things up for others. It also provides a good contrast with the main characters, who may engage in small and petty interests, but in general work together and for a longer-term goal, as opposed to the bikers, who seem to unknowingly risk everything just for an immediate thrill. I find this moving and vital to the film, but I guess to many people a pie in the face can never be anything but slapstick.

The movie ends without much of a resolution-only that the characters must keep moving, trying to survive-but what has come before is so involving, moving, and true-to-life that what sticks in the mind afterward are the characters, their struggles, and the hopelessness that they have fought against, rather than the gore or exploding heads, and that goes a long way toward explaining why this movie is as enduring and resonant as it is.",1182470400,4,6559,4.766725352112676

815937,3,6304240554,"I love zombie movies.  Movies like Night of the Living Dead (and the remake), Dead Alive, and Return of the Living Dead are among my favorite movies.  They're an adrenaline rush, they can be funny, they can be scary, but they're almost always entertaining.  I would not, however, call the original Dawn of the Dead an entertaining movie.  For the most part, I thought it was a boring movie.

I really am baffled by the good reviews of this movie from both critics and fans alike.  The Rottentomatoes website has it as the second highest rated Zombie film (after the original Night of the Living Dead).  And I have some theories on why that is: the acting is, while not always impressive, certainly solid.  The story was original (It was, I believe, only the second zombie movie ever made).  For those reasons I gave it 3 stars because I felt that it deserved it.

But something about this movie just didn't click with me and I suspect it's not going to click with many other people my age (I'm 23).  I also have my theories about why that may be:

The music?

Something about it didn't feel right for a horror film.  It was unique and it certainly had a 70s feel to it but...ehh... I give up.  I'm not someone good at critiquing music.  It just didn't work.

The fact that the zombies are walking the streets when the movie starts?

Half of the fun with zombie films seems to be watching the world go from a civil society to virtual anarchy as the zombies become more numerous.  But in this movie the zombies have the upperhand from the start.  So where's the fun?

I know this is a sequel but I guess that's the downside to being a zombie sequel.

No central character?

There's a black man that is perhaps the unofficial leader.  There's a young white man with the personality of a cowboy.  There's a sort of insecure helicopter pilot and his pregnant girlfriend.

Between these four characters, there are no conflicts and little or no romance.  There is no truly central character and in zombie movies (or any horror film) I like it when they focus primarily on one character so that we feel like we experienced the zombies from someone's perspective.  I never felt like I got to know any of the characters.  And this is a typical flaw in horror movies:  we have to first know the characters before we can care about them and worry about their safety.

Between the two Dawn of the Dead movies I prefer the remake.  I used to think that this may be because I saw the remake before I saw the original so that I would have a bias towards it.  But, more and more, I'm beginning to doubt that that is why I prefer the 2004 remake for the reasons listed above.

I know I may offend many people out there for saying this, but I think that this is the most overrated zombie movie.  My two cents.",1181088000,2,2790,4.3828125

815939,5,6304240554,"Although I must give cudos to the remade version of this film, better production values and such, the original trilogy is essential horror fare. In 1968, a space probe returns from orbiting venus, and some kind of mutated radiation has infected Earth's atmosphere. The recently deceased are affected. Any dead body not already buried or incinerated, is reanimated, something has affected the decedent's brain, and it now exists in a primal, non-social way. It's not cannibalism, per se, as a cannibal will stalk and eat their own kind. They leave one another alone, but only want to devour the living. They aren't actually hungry, but the search for and consumption of fresh food, is one of our most basic instincts.

""Dawn Of The Dead"" picks up in 1978, ten years after the original outbreak (""Night Of The Living Dead""). The living have been overrun by the walking dead, Martial Law is now in effect, and all cities are in chaos. The military and police originally thought they could bring this contageon under control, but they were apparently wrong. After the opening sequence, at a TV station, we see SWAT teams storming a housing project, and one man's vendetta against the minorities living there. Walking dead have been seen there, and the tenants must be driven out. They see it as a raid, and a blood-bath ensues. Tear gas cannisters, gunfire, screams, and devouring of humans happen here, and it is what things would really be like, if such a horrific thing could happen. The script narrows the cast down to four main characters, who now must find a place to live until things settle down, flying in a helicopter over the Pennsylvanian countryside, settling down, and setting up camp at the Monroeville Mall, near Pittsburgh. I get a kick out of watching this, because I live near the places these movies were filmed, and have been to the mall shown here, as well as the cemetary where they filmed ""Night...""

The film slows down here, but it's perfectly in line, because it's supposed to portray the isolation and boredom these people must face if they are to survive. Even though they have all the comforts of home, all the merchandise in the mall, at their disposal, they are isolated, and must try to ignore the zombies, the lower class, always looking for a way to get in, and infiltrate their little kingdom. This is Romero's social commentary, about classes of people, but if you read too much into it, you may not enjoy the film as much. It's just a sideline.

Their way of life , after however many months, is spoiled, when a large biker gang discovers their little set-up, and they force their way in, and nothing positive ensues. The carnage is unbelievable.

(spoiler)

With only two of the four core cast members left, they must now leave this place, the only home they've known since leaving society to start over, very little fuel in the helicopter, no food, no water, and no direction. How many of us have experienced this in life, a total, unexpected uprooting, and how many times? The way this entire sequence is presented, it looks bleak, desolate, and cold, and is very effective. And as they fly away, into the dawn, so to speak, one wonders what they will encounter. Leaving the ending open like this, actually makes one think about it; where would you go, and even if you had the first idea, would you make it?

This is a very well-made movie. Simple story-line, but full of twists and turns, and gut-churning special effects for fans of on-screen gore. Good films are timeless.",1179446400,,3512,4.730392156862745

I had either heard of it somewhere or remembered the plotline from my video review guide (which was my own personal ""Bible"").  When I saw it on the shelf, my jaw dropped. Obviously, this was going to be a cathartic moment in my life. Unfortunately, I had to wait until the next day (Sat).  I remember barely being able to sleep, full of the anticipation that only happens when you are 13.
  I popped the dusty VHS in the VCR.  The picture quality was less-than-perfect which hardly mattered.  For the next 2 hours, I was transfixed. Sure, the gore was more extreme than I had ever seen before and would end up giving me nightmares for about the next 6 months.

1. The quasi-documentary feel which is much amplified by the lack of over-acting by the cast.

2. The soundtrack which is easily one of the most scary and eerie soundtracks in film.  It is also one of the most memorable.

3. The over-the-top gore emphasizing the violence used by the living to thwart the advance of the dead. Yeah, it is nowhere near realistic but does show the comic-book appeal of the movie.

4.  The humanity of the characters (both living and dead) adds to the pesudo-realism and makes you care about the characters.

Four people arm themselves to the teeth with guns and other gear in order to survive the onslaught of lurching zombies. They take refuge in a shopping mall, which provides just about everything they need. They work together as a team and bond in the process of learning they need one another to endure. The walking dead are motivated by hunger alone and don't bring much in the way of strategy. It would be like shooting fish in a barrel if they weren't so tenacious. The four know they need to hurry out of there because there is talk on the TV of bombing areas of high zombie concentration. They have hope this epidemic is limited in area and that they will be able to find refuge among the living elsewhere. What does fate have in store for them? ""The Night of the Living Dead"" took place, obviously, at night and in the dark, which provided a much more frightening backdrop. It was also in black and white, which masked the deficiencies of the inexpensive zombie make-up. This is not the case with ""Dawn of the Dead,"" which is in color and takes place during daylight. The ""zombies"" are people dressed as they normally would, but with their faces painted grey. The result is anything but scary. Tom Savini's effects are hit and miss, though always disgusting. Nonetheless, this is a decent film that features some above-par acting and a decent script. The Anchor Bay Divimax DVD is also noteworthy, with a clean transfer and DTS sound mix. An extra  star for the effort.",1162166400,7,1884,4.5905044510385755

816041,4,6304240554,"I just saw Dawn of the Dead for the first time. I actually saw the remake first, which I liked. And, of course, I've seen the terrifying Night of the Living Dead many, many times and will probably see it again this Halloween. So going in, Dawn of the Dead was a little behind the eight ball, so to speak. But considering the large number of preconceived notions I had regarding the film, I did enjoy it and would recommend it. A con and a pro:

CON: I truly believe that the greatest horror films are black and white. Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, Diabolique, Psycho and, of course, Night of the Living Dead, to me, are masterpieces that just wouldn't be the same if shot in color. The shadows are darker, deeper and more sinister. Danger and menace seem to lurk around every corner. And night seems to fall over the proceedings like a shroud, waiting to swallow up everything. Perhaps it was part of director George Romero's satire of the consumer culture that prompted him to shoot the film in bright colors. However, I kept thinking of the spooky quality of the grainy black and white photography of the first film and Dawn of the Dead suffered a little bit in comparison. The color was especially jarring when blood was shown. Romero wanted a bright, unrealistic quality to the blood -- sort of like a comic book. However, the effect of this is to make the blood look like a spilled raspberry smoothie. The film is very scary, but might have been more so had Romero shot it in black and white.

However, Romero wisely stuck to the philosophy of the original when it came to casting. Probably because of budgetary constraints, he cast unknowns from the Pittsburgh area in the film. The remake of Dawn of the Dead released in 2003 was good, but it was a big studio film with recognizable actors like Ving Rhames. When the actors are people the audience knows, there is a separation that takes place. I thought several times during the remake, for example, that there was no way Ving Rhames could be killed off early in the film as he was the most recognizable star (I was right). Part of what made Night of the Living Dead so terrifying was that we didn't know the actors. Anyone could be killed at any time. Nothing was sacred (Johnny gets killed off immediately, Tom and Judy burn to death and become zombie food, Karen dies and kills her mother, etc.). Romero continues this tradition in Dawn of the Dead. We have no history with these actors, so it becomes easier to think of them as their characters. Most of us have no safety net of knowing the actors from previous work, so we have no idea who is going to live and who is going to die. It adds a level to the horror that is missing in the remake.

Overall, Dawn of the Dead is a worthy follow-up to Night of the Living Dead. Like most sequels, it doesn't quite match up, but unlike most sequels, the drop-off isn't that much. Romero has jazzed up the formula with satire and dark humor, but he still manages to scare the hell out of the audience.",1160524800,4,3009,4.447463768115942

816126,5,6304240554,"I first saw this when I was 19, in 1980 when Dawn was only a couple of years old, and I was catatonic all night!  I'm 45 now, and I STILL, at least once or twice a year, have Zombie nightmares!: usually I'm climbing a tree, or a roof, or even flying, and the zombies are reaching up and grabbing at me, and sometimes actually touch me!  I wake up gasping!  This movie is THAT scary!  I'm a Christian, so I know that it couldn't really ever happen, but it's still fun to play ""What If?"" !  I HATED the zombies in 2004's remake; I mean, get real, zombies can't run!! They're DEAD! The zombies in THIS movie are just what they should be-slow, stupid, mean & HUNGRY!!  And TERRIFYING!!! The black zombie at the beginning, EATS his wife's neck and arm, and it's SO realistic and horrifying-looking and sounding! YIKES!!That's the hardest scene to watch. Steven, toward the end, made the BEST zombie I've ever seen!!! The way he dragged his foot, and the way he instinctively remembered where the upstairs room was, and the way he gnawed at the wall, was both hilarious AND terrifying!! I really hated what happened to Roger; he was the second-best Zombie defense they had, but he let his cocky-ness get the best of him, and he paid dearly for it.  But it was cool, the way he really did try not to come back, just like he told Peter. You could see him trying not to sit up! Also I LOVED the elevator zombie trying to crawl in, the baseball-player zombie that fell in love with Fran, the Hari-krishna zombie-all of them, I give them all 1000-thumbs up!  Even the Smurfette-looking zombie in the makeup department!!  LOVE IT-LOVE IT-LOVE IT!!!!!! The theme song when it's going off is classic!",1158278400,6,1686,4.465798045602606
816127,4,6304240554,This is a great film.  The subject of widespread societal panic and the potential for anarchy among the masses has always been attractive to me and this movie delivers (think New Orleans).  the film is scary and gory and over the top but it is also a biting social critique.  Brainless Zombies wandering around the mall beacuse it makes them feel safe. It sounds like the mall near my house!  It's great.  It reminds me of Grand Theft Auto.  You go into the mall and can pretty much murder the public at will.  A rifle shot to the head being the most gratifying.  The shear bliss of having the entire mall and all of if its treaures to yourself.  Looting and killing.  It's so liberating.,1156723200,2,688,4.432
816128,5,6304240554,"I was raised on this movie, much to my mothers chagrin. Every single weekend I had to rent it. I loved Night of the Living dead so much, that when saw this one at my local video store I went nuts. George Romero is a genius; even my 9 year old mind could see that. The whole plotline where the dead suddenly rise and want to eat the living and a group of survivor's hole up in a mall couldn't have made me happier, a whole entire mall as your house? what? YES! The makeup and special effects were sub par, blue tint and Hare Krishna's, but I still wouldn't have wanted them near me. I understand now as an adult the social commentary Romero was making, but beyond all of that his movies are just plain fun. No one has ever been able to touch his writing ability, his characters, his locations, and his zombies. No One. I even picked up the soundtrack featuring The Goblins, I still hum the music when I go to the mall. My favorite Zombie in this movie has to be the Nurse, she actually was spoken to by Romero for being ""too over the top"" with her flailing and facial expressions, just watching her Zomb-out cracks me up. My favorite character is ""Fly Boy"" the pilot, in his suave jacket, slick hair. Throughout the movie he is just a wimp, he cannot shoot, he isn't reliable to his pregnant girlfriend, he does the wrong thing at every turn BUT when he finally is eaten in the elevator he turns into the biggest badest nastiest zombie who has retained important knowledge and who is given the best makeup treatment to boost the importance of his change. Fly-zombie twitches, and bends his neck, and lurches around gathering the other clueless corpses upward and onwards to the secret hiding place of his hopeful buffet, the ending is classic romero and everyone who loves him will know what i mean. I only watch this maybe once a month now, I will pop it in when I am cleaning , or when I am home sick and need comforting. I realize that my warped mind has now equalized zombies to chicken soup but I give no apologies for it. SO buy this movie, relish it, eat it up, forgive it for being outdated a bit and cheesy at times, see it for what it is, THE single greatest zombie movie of all time.",1156464000,4,2193,4.286746987951807

These things should not occur in a horror movie, but here they do, and this ruins the movie. The acting is so bad, that I would gladly watch a Steven Seagal movie after watching this. The zombies were so idiotic and not scary at all. The dialogue was even worse, though there are a FEW good quotes.

If not for Romero, Horror movies would not be what they are today.
""Night of the Living Dead"" was the true grounbreaker in horror,
but ""Dawn"" actually paved the way for today's horror flick.
It was the blood and guts and gore, and all in wonderful technicolor!!!!
True enough, there are cheesy looking things in the movie, like the blood in some scenes looks UNMISTAKENLY like red paint,
But if you focus on the STORY and not it's minor defects, It is one hell of a movie!

To me there is nothing scarier than the walking dead! I also loved the idea (and still do today) of the survivors living upstairs in this HUGE mall,in very nice living quarters, and everything they could possibly want or need in the mall below, right at thier fingertips!
  then the irony that without a civilization of people, all these material things, and money are......useless !!

""Dawn of the Dead"" is just a great horror flick, with a GREAT storyline, and in my opinion, the acting was good, too.
The movie surely is not boring as some have suggested, in fact, quite the contrary. It held my attention RAPTLY for the entire film. I only wish they would have made a part 2 to this with the same characters!
It would have been nice to see what became of Fran and Peter,Fran's baby...They could have easily did a part 2, The possibilities were endless!

A particularly unsavory member of the group gets his intestines torn out by a zombie while getting his blood pressure checked, and it looks utterly real and not at all fake or cheesy. When one of the group is bitten on a 'truck raid' and turns into a zombie underneath a blanket in their hideout, he slowly pulls it from his face and the effect is really stomach churning and frightening. this is not just for horror fanatics, but anyone who loves an entertaining yet substantive film.

It's a comic book and those things don't matter when you're engrossed in the idea of the story. In the remake, people seek refuge inside a mall from the zombie scourge. In the original, people conquer the mall because of the zombies. These people don't want to leave the mall, they're forced to leave by a bunch of biker hooligans who mess their utopian land of consumerism. Throughout their journey from lows to highs to lows again, we're treated to a zombie who's partially beheaded by helicopter blades, a few great zombie bites were chunks of meat are taken out of a few arms, legs, and necks, and one groovy shot gun blast to the head of one poor unsuspecting public housing resident.

I can remember laughing out loud and couldn't believe how wild the movie was.  However, I did find myself getting a hold of a copy on VHS.  Then a few years later, I bought the film on DVD.  The more I watched the movie, the more I began to develop an appreciation of how this movie was created.

George Romero had to wait until this mall was closed, so he could shoot his movie in the evening.  Then once all the production was done, the crew would have to clean up so the mall could be used again for business hours.  Then once the mall would close, the process would begin all over.

Another element I do like about this movie is the characters of Peter and Roger.  I love the way these two guys play off one and other.  I feel this is the main reason why I give a damn when I watch this movie.  Another funny aspect of this movie is the bootleg zombies.  For instance, there are scenes where certain zombies resemble celebrities.  Such as Jim Carey, Brad Pitt, Richard Pryor, and Trent Reznor (this only listing a few).  I must also add, one must watch this movie a million times to catch them.  In addition, they need to watch the director's cut to see all of them as well.

Anchor Bay has done an amazing job with this release.  Three versions of the movie, plenty of documentaries and tons of extras.  The picture and sound quality are great.  The original Dawn of the Dead, is probably the best zombie movie of all time.  Yes, Romero's Night of the Living Dead is a classic, but there is just something about Dawn of the Dead.  Perhaps it is the characters or the under lying social aspects the film displays.

816273,5,6304240554,"DAWN OF THE DEAD...it just oozes with fright and serious zombie innovation. This sequel to NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD really lives up to its predecessor in ways that most horror film sequels do not. The best part, that there are true hints of comedy thrown into the mix of gore, terror, scares, and what is the most blatant poke at 'consumerism'.

'DAWN' picks up apparently where the first 'DEAD' left off, with a band of survivors trying to escape the wrath of the all the mindless zombies that have infested the country (and probably the rest of the world). They head to a shopping mall where, to their dismay, they find more flesh-eating zombies waiting for them. In the beginning of the movie, there is a segment that will make you cringe as some officials reach the basement level of a complex and find a horde of zombies feasting on flesh. The survivors inside the mall find they must now band together what they need and rely on each other to survive, and unfortunately not all of them do survive, but this is where the blatant poke at 'consumerism' really comes into full effect. It's very funny, very obvious, but also a thread in the spool of the movie. It's an integral part of DAWN OF THE DEAD, but so are the horde of zombies. My favorite part is the segment where a zombie comes walking towards Roger while he gases up the helicopter, and instead of actually making it that far, his head gets cut off by the copter blades because he walks way too close to them. That is a comical moment, but also a scary reminder that there aren't enough bullets in the world to kill off all the zombies.

DAWN OF THE DEAD is another masterpiece from the wicked mind of George A. Romero, and while DAY OF THE DEAD would follow a slightly different path, DAWN OF THE DEAD is another reminder that horror really had plenty of genius left in its twisted little world. (Make sure you get the rare but find-able 137 minute unrated director's cut of this version, you'll be glad you did)",1129593600,,1978,4.461325966850829
816274,5,6304240554,"When George A. Romero first shocked moviegoers back in 1968, it was with ""Night of the Living Dead"", a dark, brutal zombie film saturated with atmospheric black and white cinematography and unflinching gore, which was quite unheard of at the time.

So audiences may have been somewhat suprised when they saw Romero's follow-up, ""Dawn of the Dead"" in 1978. The suspense factor has been turned down considerably, the eerie atmosphere (largely due to the gorgeous B&W cinematography) is all but gone, and the cynical commentary on human nature has been replaced with a rather different, though still somewhat cynical explication of mankind, which I'll get to later.

First, the story. ""Dawn"" supposedly takes place right after the events of ""Night"", even though Romero has made no effort to hide the progression of fashion from the '60s to the '70s. The film centers around four people: Francine (Ross), a headstrong woman trying to prove her worth; Stephen (Emge), a helicopter pilot and also Francine's boyfriend; Peter (Foree), a laid-back SWAT team member; and Roger (Reiniger), a rowdy and at times juvenile SWAT team member. After Francine and Stephen escape a chaotic TV studio and Peter and Roger survive a brutal raid, the four of them take to the sky in a chopper to find some kind of refuge from the ever-growing zombie epidemic that is engulfing the planet. What they find is a sprawling shopping mall that has been abandoned by everyone except a substantial amount of undead denizens. They land, grab some supplies, and, eventually, make the mall their home.

As I said earlier, ""Night"" featured some very cynical social commentary on human nature, but Romero has moved on to what's bugging him now: modern consumerism. The zombies in the mall are meant to represent the raving masses as they flock to shopping centers to buy things they don't need. This is made rather obvious at many points in the film, especially during this exchange:

-Francine: ""What are they [the zombies] doing? Why do they come here [the mall]?""

-Stephen: ""Some kind of instinct, memory of what they used to do. This was an important place in their lives.""

Is there even any doubt as to what Romero was trying to say?

But don't worry, horror fans, for while Romero was layering in all his clever little metaphors and commentaries, he didn't forget the one important little element that makes ""Dawn of the Dead"" so infamous: gore. ""Night"" was nothing compared to this. We're talking graphic, unrelenting, envelope-destroying zombie carnage, complete with beheadings, disembowlings, and more than enough head-shots to go around, including one particularly memorable scene where a zombie loses his entire head due to a shotgun blast. While the blood itself looks extremely fake, Tom Savini's groundbreaking make-up effects more than make up for it. In fact, the candy-colored blood actually adds a certain indefinable something to the film, as it tends to focus more on macabre humor than actual horror and suspense.

The acting is cheesy and rather poor, but this IS a 1970s zombie film. The dialogue is at times decent and at times laughable (in a good way, sort of). The Goblin's score is, like the acting and dialogue, cheesy, but still manages to create a certain appeal. It grows on you, trust me. The direction is quite good most of the time and maintains a very cohesive visual feel throughout the 127 minute running time (or 139 if you're watching the extended version, or 119 if you're watching Dario Argento's cut). But the flaws I mentioned are minor and can most certainly be overlooked due to the film's good qualities, which are staggeringly high.

The recent surge of zombie films has yielded some good (28 Days Later) and some bad (Dawn of the Dead (2004)) results, but no modern film full of sprinting undead will ever surpass ""Dawn of the Dead"", a true classic and the quintessential zombie film that will reign supreme for years upon years to come.

IMAGE:

The Anamorphic widescreen picture looks quite good. Color is excellent and detail is reasonably good for a low-budget picture of this type. The main defect is excessive edge enchancement ringing that's particularly noticeable in the outdoor sequences. Black levels are solid and little other artifacting is evident.

SOUND:

Not one, but four English tracks are provided, including the original mono, which sounds quite serviceable. The best of the other tracks is the DTS track, which has a broad and expansive soundstage, though not much in the way of surround effects. LFE is fairly light, and the sound is a bit piercing and shrill in all version. There are obvious source material limitations here, but the audio is free of significant noise and hiss and thus quite acceptable for its time. The european cut lacks the DTS audio track and the extended version only carries the origianl mono, but they're all of comparable quality to their theatrical cut equivalents.

816376,5,6304240554,"PLOT: The film begins at a Pennsylvania news station a couple of weeks after the events in ""Night Of The Living Dead."" The zombie plague hasn't died down at all, it's getting worse. The station is sending out information about rescue stations as well as the probable causes of the zombie plague and what to do about it. Two people working there are Fran (Gaylen Ross) and her boyfriend Stephen (David Emge), the news station's helicopter pilot. The two decide to escape from the chaos by stealing the station's helicopter along with two SWAT team members, Peter (Ken Foree) and Roger (Scott H. Reiniger). They keep flying over the countryside until they can find a safe place to stay away from the zombies. They soon find out that there are zombies everywhere, even in rural areas. They finally find a large shopping mall and decide to land on the roof. The outside is crawling with zombies. There are also about 50 zombies within the mall. They almost take off, but decide to stay when they notice a way into the attic, which has no zombies inside. The group soon realizes that they are sitting on a gold mine. If they could just sneak down into the mall, kill all of the zombies and lock the doors to prevent more from getting in, then they could have the whole mall to themselves. It's a perfect shelter. It has everything they could ever need. It could be their own personal paradise, just as long as nobody goes and screws it up...

COMMENTS: This spectacular sequel to George A. Romero's ""Night Of The Living Dead"" is ofen considered the best entry in his ""Dead"" series. Some feel that it is the greatest zombie film ever made. The film has a multi-genre feel: it has elements of horror, action-adventure, comedy, and drama. Romero continues to show how humans are just as bad as the zombies. The main theme of this film, however, is that consumerism has turned our society into zombies. The zombies don't keep coming to the mall for food, they keep coming to the mall because their instinct tells them that they want to be there. The mall was an important place when they were alive. This film also marks one of Romero's first collaborations with EFX wizard Tom Savini (who couldn't provide the make-up for ""Night"" because he was drafted to Vietnam at the last moment.) The gore is a lot more graffic in this film than in its predecessor. At the time, this was the goriest film anyone had ever seen. The film was later remade in 2004 by director Zack Snyder. The remake is a great film, however it is an extremely unfaithful remake. The only things that it has in common with the original is that it is about people hiding in a mall during a zombie plague; that's about it. The remake is not a sequel to the remake of ""Night"".  Romero followed up this film with the sequels ""Day Of The Dead"" (1985) and ""Land Of The Dead"" (2005). Italian horror director Dario Argento agreed to fund half of the budget in exchange for the rights to recut and distribute the film in Europe. In Europe, it was simply titled ""Zombi"". Italian horror maestro Lucio Fulci made an unofficial sequel to ""Zombi"" with his film ""Zombi 2"" (1979) [called ""Zombie"" in the U.S.] Zombi 2 even ""out-gored"" Dawn Of The Dead, and was followed by two Italian sequels. ""Dawn"" was also paradied by British filmmaker Edgar Wright in 2004's ""Shaun Of The Dead"" starring Simon Pegg. No zombie fan should be without this fine film. The Ultimate Edition is an awesome DVD collection. It contains 4 discs which include the Theatrical version, the Extended Version (which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival), and Dario Argento's European version (Zombi). The collection also contains several special features including two documentaries entitled ""The Dead Will Walk"" and ""Document Of The Dead"", a tour of the Monroeville Mall, theatrical trailers, and more.",1127347200,2,3821,4.684523809523809
816377,5,6304240554,"Well, every person who's in for cinema knows that ""Dawn of the Dead"" is a milestone picture. So it's obvious that you'd like to buy this one. And I won't tell about film itself - just a couple of words about this edition. I'd call it ""All You Ever Wanted To Know About 'Dawn...'"". Because here you have everything you could possibly desire. Commentaries, documentaries, galleries, trailers etc. EVERYTHING on 4 discs. The edition has three versions of the film - U.S. theatrical, extended and European. Extended is rather longer and has some bonus scenes but U.S. theatrical is what was prefered by George Romero himself so it's the one what this film was supposed to be from the very beginning. The European one was edited by Dario Argento and is slightly shorter than the others but it's not because Argento just shortened it - he cut out some footage but he inserted some more - some gory stuff. So it's not like this version is cut, don't be confused, it has some footage not available in other versions so it's interesting to watch anyway. They say there is some German version which is the extended plus Argento's footage but it was not possible to edit all this in potable way so this version is a total mess and is not necessary to watch. Anyway you have all that's needed here.
I don't think there will ever be some edition to top this one so buy it without any doubts. It is definately worth the money.",1127001600,2,1412,4.51953125
816378,5,6304240554,"Set after the events of ""Night of the Living Dead"", the nation is still in chaos with the dead rising from their graves and attacking the living.

Reiniger and David Emge) hide out in a shopping mall for shelter armed with weapons, try to radio someone for help and battle out with the undead as they must try to survive as well as trying to fight out some biker thugs.

This is one of the greatest horror movies of all time and an awesome sequel to George Romero's 1968 masterpiece ""Night of the Living Dead""! what makes this movie work besides the classic gore and make-up by Tom Savini or the music by Dario Argento & Goblin is the interesting social satire in this movie that it presents. The acting can be amateruish but there is plenty of action and violent scenes in this movie that also helps out in making this one of the greatest horror movies ever made, often imitated ( mostly by Europeans) but never eqauled.

This 4-Disc Ultimate Edition DVD set is just as awesome as the movie itself with excellent Divamax digital picture & sound remastering, audio commentaries, trailers, TV Spots, radio spots, Poster and Still galleries, easter eggs, interviews, featurettes, documentarys, and three versions: Original theatrical version, Director's Cut and Euro cut.

Why do we NEED three versions of the film? I bought the Divimax version which is almost 1/4 the price and I don't feel ripped off. I rented the 4 disc set and was disappointed. A lot of the extras were ridiculous and boring wastes of time. Does anyone REALLY want to walk around Monroeville mall with a group of fans who give you flashbacks to the Elvis groupies trotting through Graceland?

The makeup by Tom Savini is great and the zombies look real. Savini also appears as one of the bikers who the four humans must fight to keep the mall intact. Romero's direction is sort of cartoonish in this film but it fits. A not really all scares film but still a really good movie with some touching and funny moments as well.

816444,5,6304240554,"This is George A. Romero's best film. His original Night of the Living Dead is a fine horror film as well as being a scathing attack on racism. His Martin is wonderfully weird and its protagonist strangely sympathetic. Here, though, he combines all of his talents into a movie that is both a terrific horror film (one of the bloodiest ever created) and that is a senstitive and insightful satire of the budding ""Me"" generation that had commandeered the social conscience of the 1960s and turned it into something sick and disgusting. It is fitting that the end of this film has the audience rooting for the angry bikers and mindless zombies over the pathetic and greedy protagonists.

Not really a sequel to Romero's 1968 splatter-fest, this is more an extrapolation of the events in the earlier film. For some reason, the dead were returning to life and eating the living, creating a plague of zombies that threatened to take over the world. At the end of the original, it seemed somewhat heartening to see that the forces of humanity had figured out how to destroy the zombies and were on the verge of triumph. This sequel picks up some time later, when the qualified victory has fallen apart. Society is on the verge of collapse, and the government is powerless to fight the throngs of zombies. A television reporter named Francine (Gaylen Ross) and a helicopter pilot named Steven (David Emge), accompanied by two National Guardsmen, Peter and Roger (Ken Foree and Scott Reiniger), flee the destroyed studio and escape to a deserted mega-mall. After gung-ho soldier Reiniger is killed, the three others hole up in the mall, ridding it of zombies and fortifying their new Utopia against the masses. They live a life of luxury, taking what they need from the various stores and confirming suspicions that one could, if necessary, live forever in one of those places.

Quickly, though, the structure of the outside society that was collapsing re-establishes itself. Steven and Francine become lovers, then become distant. Peter, a black man, finds himself waiting on the two white people. They all become disgusted by the fact that they have everything they could ever need. Eventually, their upper-class nightmare of plenty is disrupted by a gang of bikers who tear into the mall, letting in the zombies and having a good old time slicing off heads and throwing pies. The protagonists have to flee yet again, and the movie ends on one of the most uninspiring uplifting notes I can remember.

There's an obvious class issue here. The staggering zombies (lower classes) are trying to get into the shopping mall, that apex of Western culture, which is defended by the white protagonists (upper classes) and their valet. The rich people are unhappy, because, as we all know (wink wink), money doesn't buy happiness and the lives of the rich aren't as great as one would think. Finally, the bikers (more lower classes) wreck the party by attempting to take part in the riches. Marx would have been proud.

The makeup effects were done by the genius Tom Savini, who apparently got a lot of his ideas from the horrors he witnessed in Vietnam. He has a cameo as a biker who is eaten most gruesomely. There's a lot of great sight gags, such as zombie Hare Krishnas and zombie nuns. The film was co-written by the Italian king of horror, Dario Argento, who is strangely incapable of injecting any humor at all into his own films.",1122508800,,3421,4.803056027164686

This sequel continues the story of the Earth and it's little problem.  Dead people are coming back to life and eating living human flesh.  If a person is bitten, their process to being turned into a zombie is drasticly sped up.  4 people manage to escape a populated city (VERY SMART IDEA) and take refuge in a deserted mall, well, deserted by all living beings.  This is drama in it's highest form, accompanied by horror, which is equally great.  I still prefer the awsomness of Night of the Living dead to this, and the gore in Day of the Dead (but not the rest of the movie) but people are right when they say this is the best movie in the series, I just don't agree.  I advise everyone to see this, and the makeup is from 1978, so shut up.  I must say though, avoid the Dawn of the Dead remake AT ALL COSTS!

But let's skip that, as I don't know anything about the 70s.

This, as so many other people have said, is an excellent movie.  It is far better than the previous Dead movie, Night of the Living Dead, which was an excellent movie as well.  The entire movie has a terrifyingly Apocalyptic feel to it, which really adds a lot to what the movie's all about.

Now, I wasn't alive in the 1970s, but I'm damn sure the gore in this movie disturbed a good many people.

One thing I really admired about this movie is how accurately humans would probably behave in a situation like this.  That alone made the movie feel real.

There's nothing wrong with the movie, but the DVD extras arn't much to get excited about.  Trailers, TV and radio spots...no deleted scenes or anything.  Ah well.

This review will mostly refer to the dvd, i don't have to explain what a cult classic this horror movie is. This is deff. the landmark of all zombie flicks. you zombie fans know that!! Enough said, the moment I popped in the first disc i was blown away by the transfer. The Dts. 5.1 surround sound really gives the movie a great boost. From every zombie moan to every bullet being fired, my speakers turn my room into a mall! (Slight exaggeration) There is very little grain even the night shots are pretty decent. As for the second disc (directors cut), which iv been waiting for years to see is simply amazing. Although the director's cut is only a 2.0 surround sound it still is stunning to see the 139 minute master piece. The special features on the first and second disc are weak but hey thats what the BONUS DISC is for right? On the director's cut there are some actual commericials from the Monroeville mall in the late 70's in case your interested. The commentary is pretty solid too, with DVD producers Richard P. Rubinstein and Perry Martin. I personlly like the commentary on the first disc with Make up master Tom Savini and the King of horror himself George A. Romero. You also get a comic book preview. Now for disc three, (European version) You get the cast commentary with Ken Foree, Scott H. Reiniger, and Gaylen Ross. The sound presented in this European version has good quality, 5.1 surround sound, 2.0 dolby surround, or the simple original mono. Picture wise, the transfer is decent. The special features are good too, you get all the international tv. spots, trailers, artwork, ect. You get the idea... Now for disc four, The Dead will walk Documentary is quite stunning, you get amazing interviews with just about everyone involved on the set of Dawn of the dead, on top of that you get the original documentary, you also get to look at home movies from zombie extra Robert Langer, the best part on the 4th disc is deff. the Monroeville Mall tour by the big man himself Ken Foree, Ken Foree makes the tour entertaining and keeps it brief.

The story in itself really is a suspenseful gore fanatic's dream where humor and entertainment jump out when least expected.  It is within the unexpected where Romero succeeds in generating a horror film that does not only frighten, but also creates much room for contemplation and reflection.  The combination of fear and existential philosophy develops an interesting opportunity for the audience to look at themselves in the mirror while light satire emerges through the reflection of American society.

In Philadelphia exhausted employees of a TV station feebly try to convey what is happening on the streets.  An invited expert unveils the truth, but the interviewer deems it implausible that the streets are full of zombies devouring human flesh.  Despite the interviewer's doubtfulness he continues to question the expert while several employees begin to leave their posts.  In the middle of this chaos Francine (Gaylen Ross) tries to do her best in helping, but when her boyfriend Stephen (David Emge) arrives he tells her to meet him on the roof at 9PM.  She realizes it is high time to get out of the city before it is too late.

At a different location in the city the police force has joined up with the National Guard in order to get control of the problem, but without much luck.  In one of the poor housing projects Roger (Scott H. Reiniger) bumps into Peter (Ken Foree).  They are two likeminded characters and realize that they might need each other in order to survive.  Roger invites Peter to come along, as his friend Stephen has a helicopter and they are leaving tonight.  Peter takes his chance with Roger and they leave the city of Philadelphia to its destiny with the living dead, as four of them fly out of the city.

During their flight they stop for fuel and encounter more zombies, which forces them to reconsider their plan.  When they by chance fly by a shopping mall they take their chance to check out the place and if they can get some food.  After some exploration of the mall they realize that they have stumbled on what they think is heaven on earth.  Sure, they are fortunate, but it comes with a price, a very costly price.  At the same time, an interesting allegorical perspective of the societal values appear with death everywhere around them.  The value of items seems futile when they find out that Francine is pregnant, which makes them think about the future.  Those who have read Everyman can draw parallels between the Medieval morality play and the film.  For example, there is a scene where they find an abundance of money, but what is money when death is knocking on the door?  Riches do not matter, beauty does not matter, friends are about to run out, no kin exists, and the only thing that is left is the action they take and how they could affect the future - a possible hope.

Another interesting aspect in the film is how they barrier themselves from zombies, but also possible visitors.  Here Romero touches on the basic idea of a government building, which is built on the idea of protecting one's territory.  This provides strong suggestions that humans are territorial, which is true when studying a world map.  The simplicity in which Romero applies this notion into an intriguing situation where fear is the constant that keeps them alive and what they have could help keep them alive for the time being.

The film has some years on its neck, which means that the special effects are not up to the standards of 2005.  However, it still has its desired effect, and nothing of the story is lost due to the technical aspects of the film.  Besides the technical aspects Romero intendeds this film to be a sequel to his Night of the Living Dead (1968) and he surpasses the initial film by light years in both horror and wisdom.  The conclusive verdict of the film is that Dawn of the Dead offers a truly remarkable cinematic experience that offers high level suspense in an insightful horror film.",1119657600,,4084,4.711267605633803

George Romero is that special kind of person. It doesn't take long for you to get to know and relate with the characters in this movie. You quickly grow sympathetic for them and actually care if something happens to them. You don't see that alot in movies these days. In some ways, if you try really hard, you can even picture how you would react in the character's situations and you may even notice that the way you react and the way the characters react are about the same.

816451,5,6304240554,"I'm not much of a horror or gore fan, but there are two films from that genre which stand out for me.  One is John Carpenter's version of ""The Thing"", and the other is George Romero's ""Dawn Of The Dead"".  This set includes the original U.S. theatrical cut, Dario Argento's European cut, and an extended cut (previously billed as the ""Director's Edition"", which is a misnomer -- in fact, Romero prefers the U.S. theatrical cut).  The extended cut is longer (no kidding), and replaces much of the music from the Italian group ""Goblin"" with stock music.

This is a film that can still, even after years and repeated viewings, creep me out a bit.  The makeup effects are crude by today's standards, but the real scare here is psychological.  This was a film with which I would always ask ""What would *I* do in this situation?""  Great characters in a great story with some underlying themes (not just a dump, gore flick), ""Dawn Of The Dead"" is a fantastic film, and my favorite of Romero's ""Dead"" series (though I haven't seen the soon-to-be-released ""Land Of The Dead"").

The 3 versions in this set each include a commentary track (the U.S. cut with Romero and wife, the Argento cut with producer Richard Rubenstein, and the extended cut with the main cast).  A fourth disk includes some documentary and behind-the-scenes material.  The packaging is also very well done.

If you are a fan of this film, you will love this set.  If you haven't seen the film and think you might like it, I'd suggest a rental of the U.S. cut.",1119312000,,1519,4.605947955390334

what if the world was over? what about all those things we made? ever wanted to drive a car through a mall? ever wanted to take all those clothes you wanted to buy but never had the cash?

all these nutty things that would get you arrested in real life are explored in dawn of the dead

though as you will see material possessions can overwhealm us and distract us from what is important

many people I have showed this to have always payed attention to the make-up and special effects, though afterwards thats not what they remember most. It has an effect on people

it makes them think, makes them question, makes them dream!

When there is no more room in hell..... The dead will walk the earth. The quote that has stuck in the horror community and will continue to be known well into the future.

This movie is easily in my top 5 favorite movies of all time. It has gore, violence; sadness, GREAT STORY, and it give you real sense of desolation and struggle.

You can really connect to the characters and feel their pain. (Well at least I did)

Its bad ass because after all the trouble they had with the clearing out the mall of all its zombie loungers, and loosing a man (which still makes me sad watching it to this day) ""Roger.... I salute you"". They than have to battle a group of biker looters.

And the special effects lord ""Tom Savini"" makes a cameo as the biker leader.

I mean this movie is bad. There's conflict between the main character, ""differences in plans etc."" battles with hordes of the undead, and fighting human enemies.

This film also shows classic scenes. For example: when a zombie stands on a box at the airport and gets the top of his head slice off by the groups helicopter blades. Or when Willy ""swat cop"" opens an apartment door and blows off ""a normal man"" a poor black buys head with a shotgun.

Anyway apart from having a great story, it has relatively good acting, great effects, has a really cool music score and just a great all out movie.

Romero is truly a great writer and director.",1119139200,,1670,4.276190476190476

816613,5,6304240554,"""Shop 'til you drop"" takes on literal form in ""Dawn of the Dead"", Splattermeister George Romero's 1978 magnum opus of the flesh-eating Living Dead. ""Dawn"" rightly deserves its title as the 'Mount Everest of Zombie Movies'.

The Zombie Apocalypse is all George Romero's fault! And if Grandmaster Romero let the Walking Dead out of their tombs with the groundbreaking ""Night of the Living Dead"", he gave the zombies the keys to the kingdom in this flick, which laid down all the rules for a Zombie Apocalypse and how to survive It---and, interestingly, managed to break many of them.

Rule #1: AIM FOR THE HEAD!: When ""Dawn"" opens up, Philadelphia is in its death throes, though the city doesn't know it yet.

The plague of flesh-eating monsters rising from their graves to devour the living has spread from the countryside to the big cities like a firestorm. The slightest scratch or bite causes infection, the infected die horribly, and then return to Life, hungry for the flesh of the living, a mindless Zombie.

Rule #2: THE CAVALRY AIN'T COMING. Things go down and go down hard in the housing project: faster than you can say ""tastes like Chicken"", SWAT troopers Peter (the great Ken Foree) and Roger (the underrated Scott Reiniger) get outta Dodge with traffic reporter/helicopter pilot Stephen (David Emge, hereafter known as ""Flyboy"") and Flyboy's girlfriend, Fran (Gaylen Ross).

When the Going gets Tough, the Tough go Shopping.

Rule #3:HE WHO GOES ""YEEHAWW"" HAS A HALF-LIFE MEASURED IN NANOSECONDS. Romero moves at a taut, brisk pace, letting the feeling of impending doom sink in, the sense of increasing wrongness, all underscored by the brooding, thudding, unearthly pulsing of the Goblin soundtrack.

What's interesting about ""Dawn of the Dead"" is just how much of a collaborative effort it really was: ""Dawn"" reprised the team that had helmed ""Martin"": Mike Gornick on the camera, Romero calling the shots, John Amplas (who played the young vampire Martin) running casting (and who gets gunned down as a rooftop gangsta in a quick cameo), and special spatter effects guru Tom Savini finally strutting his stuff (and getting in some quality screen time with a machete, to boot).

Some have criticized Romero & Crew for lacking artistry in their cinematography, but think about it: ""Dawn"" was still a low-budget family affair, and Romero's best work has always had an edgy, guerilla feel. But the new print is gorgeous, and clear up any questions about Romero's genius: there is some beautiful stuff here.

Take the scene with the helicopter lifting off against a dying Philadelphia skyline---with the lights in the floors of one skyscraper winking off, bottom to top, floor by floor. Or the nerve-jangling cat & mouse game between Flyboy and a zombie in a darkened engineering room. Or the sere beauty of a Mall parking lot overrun with the Dead hankering for that Blue-light special on human flesh, Aisle 9---all of this lends a brooding, sick, rotten atmosphere to ""Dawn"". It works in spades, and it's gorgeous, too.

Rule #4: THEY'RE DEAD, THEY'RE ALL MESSED UP. Yes, Romero laid down the ""Rules"" of the Zombie apocalypse. They move at a lumbering crawl, you put `em down with a blow or bullet to the head, they don't use tools, they're deadly but stupid, they can't learn. Purists judge a remake, or any Zombie flick, according to the rules of the Romero canon.

But take a look at ""Dawn"" and you'll find something interesting: Romero proceeds to violate---or toy with---nearly every rule about the Living Dead he put forth. You think turbo-zombies first showed up in ""28 Days Later""? Not so: zombie kids in an abandoned airport charthouse charge at Ken Foree like they've got a Delorean in their tushses. Zombies can't use tools? Seems one of them finds a wrench very handy in breaking a truck window to take a chomp at Roger.

Rule #5: NO GUTS, NO GLORY. If you love ""Dawn of the Dead"", you *must* pick up Anchor Bay's lovingly assembled ""Ultimate Edition"". First off, the print is gloriously restored: the colors are so intense and the picture so clear that ""Dawn"" looks like it could have been shot yesterday---long gone are the days of cheapo full-screen VHS copies that made early versions of ""Dawn"" look like porn.

There are four DVDs, tricked out in red and black and handsomely mounted in a glossy package crammed with goodies (including the shot-for-shot comic---nothing special in itself, but a nice addition). You get commentaries with everyone, the original 'Making of' Documentary, a brand-new documentary made especially for this edition, even a creepy commercial for the Monroeville Mall.

The real treasure trove here is the ability to watch all three versions of the movie: the original US theatrical cut (the best, in terms of pacing and atmosphere), the Extended version (featuring a tense and effective stand-off at the Phillie docks), and the shorter European version. It's intriguing to compare how editing and music can radically alter a film: in the Euro version, we have much more of Goblin's soundtrack---but everything feels off, not nearly packing as much punch.

Rule #6:DON'T GET TRAPPED IN THE BASEMENT. Time has been kind to ""Dawn of the Dead"" and George Romero; justly so. ""Dawn"" is a deliciously wicked little jewel of a movie, one I can watch over and over again. The consumerist angle, done to death my movie critics, is a little much: Romero filmed the flick in the Monroeville Mall because it was cheap, not because he was making a scathing commentary about American consumerism.

Then again, maybe it is a movie about the extremes of Consumerism: the Zombies have risen again as the ultimate consumers, after all.

They now consume our Flesh.

Yes, it's easy to take on the zombies in the middle of the movie.  It's MORE CRUEL to make you believe the characters can make it before pulling the rug back from under your expectations again (most movies are just low to high or vice versa; this one is low then high then back to low again).

old. Back when I was young, I didn't view this as a

scary movie at all. I'd actually would go outside

and pretend I was the leading role guy Ken Fortee

killing the zombies. Now, I have a different view

and realize just what it would be like for some

thing like this to really happen. The acting is

really realistic and more natural which could

almost make you forget that this can't happen.

The music comes in at the right times that help

pull you into the movie. It's high in gore, but

no over the top that it isn't believeable. The

zombies look alot outdated... ESP the clothes

they wear. But hey, it was 26 years ago and what

can you really expect? I do think the movie drags

alittle bit at a latter part of the movie, but

that doesn't pull the movie down overall.

The characters bring different things to the table...

Ken is is the take charge kind of guy that is the

toughest... Scott is kind of cocky and at times

forgets the seriousness of the situation and also

sometimes borders on being insane... Flyboy is the

guy that handles the planes and is probably the

smartest of the four. Gaylen brings most of the

emotional feelings that the other 3 don't provide

very often.

My favorite character is Ken because he is strong,

aware, and has most of the common sense. He's just

the type you want to lead your team. The one I dis-

liked most was Flyboy... He just seems out of place

at some spots and is sort of on the soft side and

he really lacked charisma . But in a way, his death

seemed to effect me more than the others.

Overall, I'd say this is one of the best horror movies

to come out. If you are picky about movies that look

dated this might turn you off. But if you are open

minded and like horror/zombie movies you are most

likely going to like this movie.

My favorite parts are when they are at the hangers,

Ken and Scott first going down into the mall, watching

them get all the weapons and the ending. I think people

816620,4,6304240554,"George Romero returns to his zombie horror series which began with Night of the Living Dead and later would be concluded with Day of the Dead.  The zombie epidemic has continued to spread and survivors are banning together.  Frightened and generally well armed groups try to combat this plague.  The apocalypse is here and for most part the ""every man for him self rule"" applies.  The strong rule the weak and civilized society has officially collapsed.  Romero directs this sequel with a similar style.  There of course are moments of gore and running away from zombies, but the focus of the movie is the character development and their interaction with each other and other groups of survivors.  Where Romero stirs things up a bit in this one is by making it compensate for the lack of ""action"" by making the characters a little bit well sort of funny and sometimes crazy.

The basic setting for this one is a group of survivors that have holed up in a shopping mall.  Unfortunately the zombies are drawn to the shopping mall based on a primal memory of their former lives and the places they used to spend there time.  Other bans of survivors are also drawn to the mall as well, some for good and some for not.

The original Night of the Living Dead had the characters wound up really tight and worried, in this movie the characters seem to have had time to learn to cope with their situation and thus try to enjoy them selves every now and then.  The movie also goes into the long term stress that this sort of a situation can cause.  There are moments were the characters display the fact that they really are at any time on the breaking point of the line between sanity and insanity.

If, like me, you're an older fan who was lucky enough to see it in theaters upon its release you may even have one of the ancient HBO Video VHS versions tucked away somewhere.

Since then the film has been released and re-released in various versions on VHS, Laser Disc, and DVD countless times. Many die-hard fans have probably bought multiple incarnations of ""Dawn"" over the years for new documentaries here or new commentaries there.

Get ready to open your wallet again because, cost consciousness aside, this ""Ultimate Edition"" falls squarely into the ""must buy"" column.

If you've never seen the original ""Dawn"", let's begin with a synopsis.  In 1978, George Romero released the second film in what would later come to be called the ""Dead Trilogy."" ""Dawn of the Dead"" isn't a sequel to ""Night of the Living Dead"" as much as it is another view of world being overrun by flesh-eating, reanimated corpses.

While ""Night of the Living Dead"" ended bleakly it also suggested that humans were successfully repelling the zombie onslaught. ""Dawn"" opens with the zombies clearly gaining the upper hand.

Two Philadelphia Police SWAT Team members, a female television news producer, and the station's news chopper pilot steal a helicopter and flee the city. They seek a brief respite by landing atop a rural indoor shopping mall that, like everywhere else, is thick with zombies.

The SWAT officers quickly devise a ""hit and run"" plan to loot needed supplies while eluding the walking dead. When that plan succeeds with only minor hitches, the band decides to extend their stay. What follows is a series of brilliantly executed action sequences wherein the four use cleverness and weapons looted from the mall's gun shop to eliminate the zombies and take control of the mall.

As a straight horror film, ""Dawn"" doesn't quite work. Part of the problem lies in the film's setting. A brightly-lit shopping mall doesn't evoke the same sense of terror and dread as the night-time rural farm house setting of ""Night of the Living Dead."" Nevertheless, the film fires on all cylinders as action-adventure piece that never relents.

Key to its success is strong performances by the quartet of then-unknown actors in the leads. Especially notable are Gaylen Ross as Francine and Ken Foree as SWAT officer Peter. Foree's role is especially significant since it marks the second time in the ""Dead"" series that Romero cast an African-American in a strong lead role.

Foree's Peter quickly establishes himself, and is accepted, as the leader of the group. When one considers that this was more than 10 years before Will Smith proved audiences would line up to see a Black man save the world in ""Independence Day"", you realize that this was a pretty revolutionary move for Romero to take in 1978.

In terms of onscreen violence and gore the film set a new benchmark.  One could argue that if ""Night"" pushed the envelope in this regard, ""Dawn"" shredded it and then set the pieces on fire.

At the time of its release it was left un-rated due to its excessive violence and gore. Starlog Magazine described it as ""quite possibly the most violent film ever made."" By today's standards, the violence actually seems relatively tame. One could argue that more recent mainstream films like ""Braveheart"" outdo ""Dawn"" on both violence and gore. Much of the action has a slap-stick quality that suggests a ""Roadrunner"" cartoon albeit with several gallons of blood.

This is not to say that the film is a comedy though. In fact, many critics interpreted it as a biting commentary on the rampant consumerism that would ultimately overtake the country in the 1980s. With its shopping mall setting, zombies mindlessly trying to enter stores, and the heroes' growing infatuation with their ""kid in a candy store"" environment, it's hard not to see a message here.

But as the heroes quickly abandon any thought of finding people elsewhere for a life of insulated comfort and free home appliances, they are oblivious to how their actions might ultimately doom them. At the same time, Romero's insertion of television news commentators describing a society that is quickly falling apart is chilling in its realism.

I won't reveal the ending but will say that ""Dawn"" more than earns its status a classic that is at least as good as ""Night."" And while the first film was clearly the scarier, ""Dawn"" has emerged as, by far, the more influential.

It spawned countless imitators, mainly directed by Italians like Lucio(""Zombie"") Fulci whose apparent appettite for zombie flicks can only be matched by the French's passion for Jerry Lewis movies.  It's influence can also be seen in scores of comic books and video games like ""Doom,"" ""Resident Evil,"" and ""House Of The Dead."" Hell, even Michael Jackson's award-winning ""Thriller"" video probably never would've been made if Romero's film hadn't sparked Jacko's already-tweaked imagination.

What is notable about this collection is that it presents no less than three versions of the film:  The Original U.S. Theatrical Release, The Extended Version, and the European Version.

Each version gets a separate commentary track but my favorite is the cast commentary on the European Version which reunites stars Foree, Ross, David Emge, and Scott Reininger.  The actors clearly had a ball getting back together to record the commentary.  Their observations and memories are insightful and often hilarious.

Of the three versions, the U.S. version however remains the superior cut.  The extended version, while offering previously unseen footage(see everything that happened at the docks when Steven and Fran first met up with Peter and Roger), frankly drags in spots.  The European version ups the ante with more gore but comes in with a shorter running time.  Unfortunately, it accomplishes this by excising some classic scenes.

As for the extras, this set contains more than you can shake a severed limb at.  Best among them are two documentaries, including the feature-length ""Document of the Dead"" which had previously been available only as a separate, stand-alone DVD.

There is no fluff here and devoted fans will literally want to comb through every poster gallery and TV spot.  Easter egg alert!  These discs also contain hidden bonus interviews.

As we know, Romero would ultimately go on to direct a third ""Dead"" film, the solid but less than great ""Day of the Dead,"" and executive produce a superfluous remake of ""Night"" in 1990.

With Romero himself, having acknowledged that ""Day"" fell short, he's long talked about a fourth installment that would bring the series to a suitably fitting end.

During one of Disc Four's documentaries he talks about that movie, ""Dead Reckoning,"" which recent media reports suggest is now in production albeit with a new and, unfortunately dopier title ""Land of the Dead.""

The timing certainly seems right given that Zombie and Zombie-esque film have undergone a bit of a Renaissance.  Films like ""28 Days Later,""  ""Shaun of the Dead,"" and the ""Resident Evil"" films have all hit theaters and enjoyed considerable success.  And of course there's this year's ""Dawn"" remake which some would say equals or maybe even surpasses Romero's original.

But there's no getting around the fact that the original ""Dawn"" is not only a classic but also a masterpiece.  Those who remember seeing it in theaters knew that afterwards nothing would ever be the same.

Buy this collection and see why for yourself.",1104364800,6,7809,5.013168086754454
816673,5,6304240554,"Dawn of the Dead is one of the best horror films ever and it is even better to have the Ultimate Edition of the amazing film out.  I will be reviewing this based on the dvd itself and everything about it. Dawn of the Dead has a great post-Apocolyptic plot on 4 characters who fight there way into survinging a nightmare.  The characters don't really show any compassion but it still doesn't ruin the joy of this amazing film.  It has a great plot, the actors are top notch and the gore effects are absolutley incredible.  This film didn't have very realistic nor very well made zombies but they stillacted and felt like zombies...sort of.

Now that I got that overwith lemmi get to the dvd itself.  The picture quality is A+, Divimax did an awesome job with everything, the sound, picture quality ect.  The extras in this film are just tons and tons of fun to watch and I won't get into to much detail since you can read the other reviews that tell you about it.  The Ultimate Edition has got to be one of the best DVD sets ever!  It's 4 discs.

Disc 1

The thearitical Cut with loads of extras

Disc 2

The Extended Cut with loads of extras!!

Disc 3

Ugh this one I didn't enjoy...the Dario Argento Cut/European cut if you wanna call it with...yup you guessed it..Loads of extras inculding commentary by all the main actors of this film

Disc 4

It's pretty much documents and stuff with Tom Savani and some de tour of the mall with one of the actors(who also plays as Kenens dad in Kenen and Kel)

The Dvd Set is overall A+ and so is the movie.  The movie did change some peoples life when it first hit theaters, It didn't change myn but it sure did make me love zombie films.  It is possibly THE best zombie film ever.  I didn't think the film was overrated at all.  It had great actors, a great plot and great effects by Tom Savani.  The film is also the best in the Dead Trilogy well in my opinion it is.  The zombies in this film are some what cheesy looking but are still a beauty to look at.  They don't look as good or as scary as Luci Fulci's Zombi but still these zombies can BITE!

Dawn of the Dead had some really great moments like the infamous Zombie buffet scene with the biker gangs and of course some of the more gentle parts of the film like the humor which is very enjoyable and is a shame the Argento cut had most of it taken out so it can be more ""Serious"" which is now were I'm going to head my review to...

The Dario Argento cut is just plain awful.  The music is in the most ""wrong places"" and the scenes are mixed up in different orders like the infamous buffet scene is now at a different part of the film which kind of got frusraiting for me.  But the Commentary makes up for this mess.

Overall Dawn of the Dead is screaming genious and is overall an incredible horror film and this DVD set makes it even better with tons of extras, great commentary and perfect picture quality, not to mention 3 versions of the film including an extra 4th disc with loads of documents and other extras that'll make you drool for more.  In the end I give this film and DVD set a perfect

5 out of 5 stars.

Well done AnchorBay..well done

816676,5,6304240554,"Dawn is truly one of the great films of the 70's.  Dawn of the Dead was the long awaited sequel to 1968's Night of the Living Dead and is one of the few examples where a sequel is as good as or even better than the predecessor.  It is a strange mixture of horror and satire.

Romero's story is a clever one.  Four people hide in a suburbian shopping mall from a canabalistic Zombie Apocolypse.  At first they believe they are living in a shelter of paradise, but as time goes by thier lives become more and more empty.  The film climax's with a battle between the film's heroes, a renegade motorcycle gang, and of course the zombies!!!  The film contains gore at a level never seen before on the big screen.  The audience becomes almost immune to it by the end of the film.  Infact, the violence becomes one of the film's many charms.  Romero is able to combine humor with horror and makes a point about society's obbession over commercial items.  Though the film may not be appreciated with its first viewing, it is truly a horror masterpiece.  Dawn is a film that has grown in popularity over the decades, and will continue to do so.",1102636800,,1135,4.403846153846154

It has the original theatrical release. You don't get however many extra minutes from the director's cut, but to me that's alright, I'm usually happy when the movie ends. If it was any longer, I don't know that I could sit through it. Not that it's too gory or super boring, it's just a bit slow. Not much really happens. It's great to watch the people interact, and I don't need any extra footage to get the point.

The extras are decent. Commentary with Romero and his wife and Savini. Radio spots. Enough for anyone who just needs the movie, not all the details.

816678,5,6304240554,"This film has been neglected long enough....Romero fans , our time has come!  Past DVD versions have come devoid of any special features, sans trailers.  Now we get everything one could hope for in one package.  The film speaks for itself, a isolationist end of the world fantasy drenched in cartoonish gore.  As many of you have pointed out, this is not so much a horror film as it is a vision of one society breaking down and another rising up, and how fundamentaly they are not that different.

  The great thing about this incarnation of the late 70's classic is how much extra we get.  All the main actors and Romero give incredibly entertaining commentary tracks (you'll laugh out loud at the actors' track), everyone is present and accounted for in the feature length doc which takes you through every section of the film, and you'll be fascinated to watch the differences in each of the three versions of the film presented here.  My favorite is of course the extended edition, but I digress.  There is even a tour of the Monroeville Mall conducted by actor Ken Foree that also features other cast members from the film.  The most surprising feature is a short commercial for the Monroeville Mall, circa 1977-78 that is just about as creepy as the feature film.

  If you're on the fence about this one, get off and buy it already!  There is about three days worth of viewing material on here if you take it one disk at a time..its worth every penny.  This is the real Dawn of the Dead, except no imitations OR remakes!",1102118400,,1527,4.5588235294117645

816744,5,6304240554,"I have been a horro movie fan for over 20 years.  I have seen all types of horror movies and have always been totally ""in love"" with any movie meant to scare a person.  I always find something to appreciate in a horror movie.

That being said, I would like to state that this is BY FAR, the BEST horror movie ever made.  I'm a little different than most ""Dawn of the Dead"" fans.  I just saw the movie this year(2004) for the first time and actually saw the re-make(also excellent, but in a different sense) first.  In fact, I liked the re-make so much, that I went out and bought the original immediatly.

This movie is great for so many reasons, I can hardly even begin.

First, this movie contains some of the finest acting you will EVER see in a horror movie.  All of our characters are played by ""no-name"" actors, but they are far from bad and actually really good at making the viewer feel what the characters themselves are actually feeling.

Second, the plot is absolutly fantastic.  ""Night of the Living Dead"" was great.  I've seen it a million and a half times, since I was about five.  The movie contains a basic plot and it would have been very easy for Romero simply to continue that story, but with a different set of characters.  Oh no, not Romero.  He does give us a new set of characters(mainly because the originals die in ""Night"") and he does pick up the story close to when ""Night"" ends, BUT now we have some pretty comlpex side-plots going on.  We have a pregnant women; a black man, who is not wanted with the group at first and who also just killed another cop for barging into a project and shooting innocent people.  We have a ""hot-shot"" who feels he is ""untouchable"".  Basically, we have the world shortly after the zombie attacks have taken place.  We have people on TV, trying to explain why this is happening, when the funny thing is, who would be watching TV at a time like that????? But that is the effect that Romero is getting at.  He touches on issues similiar throughout the movie.

The gore in this movie is fantastic for the time it was shot.  Nowadays, it would be considered ""cheesy"" and I actually read another person's review here at amazon, stating that he found it cheesy.  GET A CLUE.  That same person also recommends watching ""The Exorcist"" or ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" because this was not scary enough.  GIVE ME A BREAK, what in the world is scarier that the possiblilty of being secluded with 3 strangers in a world that has been taken over by zombies???

I love a ""Nightmare on Elm Street"", but please don't compare this movie to that.

Seriously, and not to sound too cliche, the worst part about this movie is that it ends.  I wish it were like 7 hours longs, because it is so much fun to watch.

In conclusion, I know this review is probably very rambled and out-of-order, but when it comes to this movie, I am just get way too excited and can't stop talking.  There are so many more things I would like to say about this movie, but just can't think of.  All in all, if you are going to see or buy only 1 horror movie, buy this one!",1100044800,,3086,4.3426573426573425
816745,5,6304240554,"Picking up three weeks after the events in ""Night Of The Living Dead,"" the sequel ""Dawn Of The Dead"" has the undead now overpopulating normal civilization. The military has ran out of ideas and every man seems to have a different idea about what to do and where to go. Throughout all this chaos, two S.W.A.T. team members (played by Scott H. Reiniger and the great Ken Foree) meet up with two television station employees (Gaylen Ross and David Emgee) and take shelter in a nearby shopping mall. Despite an incredible amount of the undead population flocking to the mall at an alarming rate, the foursome find salvation in a top-level storage space, and turn what was originally supposed to be a resting stop, into a long-term stay. However, like all societies sooner or later, the one created above the mall full of zombies begins to crumble piece by piece as the movie forges on. All four actors play their roles perfectly, and the characters conflict and compliment each other very well. Director George Romero (""Night Of The Living Dead"") is very subtle and lets the story play out naturally. Although his message of anti-consumerism is a bit dated, he still manages to make the movie and the story timeless. Despite the undead being very slow, there is still a thick amount of dread and suspense piled on. There is a reason why Romero is the grandfather of zombie flicks. The zombies aren't the scary part of this movie. What is scary are the people, and how they react to the situation they are faced with, and how quickly society begins to crumble. But it doesn't hurt that special effects master Tom Savini (who, incidentally directed the remake of ""Night Of The Living Dead"") piles on healthy servings of gore at all the right moments (also, look out for him as the leader of the gang that breaks into the mall). The original ""Dawn Of The Dead"" is easily one of the best horror movies ever made, and is the rare case of a sequel being just as good as the original. It also works so that if you haven't seen ""N.O.T.L.D."" you can still watch this and know what's going on. The remake is good, but nothing will ever top this one. This is a movie that will stay in your head for days, and will never ever leave your subconcious. If you're looking for an intelligent and brave horror flick, go to the mall.

816750,5,6304240554,"Before discussing the film, as though I need to waste time outlining the plot and meaning of such an epochal horror film as ""Dawn of the Dead,"" I would like to make a few comments about the DVDs. Personally, I have watched this film several times over the years and by this point have little idea of which versions I have seen or enjoyed the most. I am a viewer who always likes to see the uncut, unedited version of any movie because I do not enjoy the idea of someone else deciding what I can or cannot see. How many versions of this film exist? At least four, I think, although I'm sure there are more.  O.K., censors will do what censors do and we can do little about it except shake our heads and look for an uncut foreign version. But let's acknowledge something important about the numerous versions of this film and the movie's central theme. Romero used this installment of his zombie franchise to critique the rampant consumerism in American society, right? Isn't it more than a bit ironic there are so many versions of this film? In other words, a movie excoriating uncontrolled materialism requires fans to continually go out and buy the latest updated version. I'd laugh if it weren't so ridiculous.

Anyway, here we go. The mysterious plague, event, or whatever it is that caused the dead to rise in the first film has now become global in its implications. Mass chaos breaks out across the United States and presumably the world. Television stations broadcast emergency information that usually results in more harm than help, and the police and military services fight a losing battle in areas loaded with the shambling dead. A tense series of showdowns in an infested apartment complex show the seriousness of the problem. Not only do you have flesh-seeking zombies to worry about, citizens going nuts and shooting at the cops become a real problem as well. It's obvious civilization teeters on the brink of utter collapse, so media personality Fran (Gayleen Ross), her boyfriend and chopper pilot Stephen (David Emge), and two police officers involved in the failed raid on the apartment building, Roger (Scott Reinger) and Peter (Ken Foree), decide to fly the friendly skies to anywhere but the city. They run into a few problems along the way, such as a pitched battle with a bunch of zombies near a refueling depot out in the countryside, but the quartet eventually achieves some sense of safety when they hole up in a huge shopping mall out in the sticks.

As the four set up shop in the mall, they have to go about a series of housecleaning chores. Romero treats us to lengthy scenes of Scott and Peter loping around the mall making sure the place is safe. We see the two cops running through stores, avoiding zombies all the way, to gather supplies. They discover a storage room tucked away in the rear of the mall and work to turn it into a base of operations. Scott and Peter even risk life and limb (pun intended) to drive huge big rigs up to the doors of the mall, thus effectively blocking the shambling dead from entering the building. Then the bloodletting begins as the group raids a gun shop and promptly exterminates every flesh eater in the mall. These scenes, while lengthy and seemingly mundane in the context of the larger picture, actually serve an important purpose. By showing our heroes setting up shop in the mall, Romero helps give the film a sense of civilization attempting to rebuild itself. And with the resumption of civilization, apparently, comes the greedy materialism inherent in modern life. Fran, Stephen, Scott, and Peter soon spend most of their time shopping and enjoying the exquisite goods available in the various shops. By the time a motley motorcycle gang appears on the scene to plunder the mall (led by Tom Savini!), a three way battle erupts between our heroes, the thugs, and the zombies now allowed to once again roam through the mall.

Romero's second installment of his famed Dead Trilogy is such a wonder to behold due to several important factors. The materialism theme steals most of the attention because, frankly, it's great to see someone add such depth to a nihilistic horror film. I appreciated the gore that, although infrequent, really makes an impact when it pops up. You've got zombies munching on victuals in gluey close up, a grotesque tete a tete (heh!) with helicopter blades, lots of exploding heads, and a bunch of motorcycle pirates coming apart at the seams. Even more amazing is the black humor infusing this fantastic film. For instance, have you ever seen a pie fight involving reanimated, decaying corpses? You will here. ""Dawn of the Dead"" can't get any better, right? Wrong. That's Goblin you hear performing the score for the film. Yep, Romero got the group responsible for so many of Dario Argento's creepy film scores to do the soundtrack for ""Dawn of the Dead."" In fact, Dario helped out with this film. Simply amazing. Fans couldn't put together a dream lineup like this if they tried.

I'm not going to mention extras except to say each of the different versions contains different stuff. I see there is now an ""Ultimate Edition"" set that contains so many extras as to boggle the mind. I'm wondering if I should just buy the ultimate collection and be done with it because I've avoided buying any version. Frankly, I don't appreciate the greed involved in the distribution of this film. Romero followed this film up with the awesomely gory ""Day of the Dead,"" another must see classic in the horror canon. Enjoy!",1096675200,3,5513,4.744525547445256
816751,5,6304240554,"This DVD marks the 186th release of DOTD on home video. But seriously, it's THE one you cannot be without, a fan of the movie or not.

George A. Romero's HUGE-scale sequel to Night of the Living Dead takes his simple, but scary, idea and expands from an isolated farmhouse to the whole planet. The zombies are EVERYWHERE and there is no escape. Resistance is futile. A couple of SWAT team members quickly figure this out and skip on their evacuation duties to just get out of the city in their own quicker way. Hooking up with a couple of traffic reporters in a chopper they take off in search of a safe haven. Along the way they see the world below react to the oncoming Armageddon and end of civilization.

After spotting a deserted shopping mall below the quartet land on the roof and barricade themselves inside as the world very quickly crumbles. Hope is rapidly running out and much time passes with no word from what remains of the world.

While not as scary as the remake, this film does make up by having a sick sense of humor and a larger story to tell. I won't pass off cheeky subtext as my own discovery (every other review here does) but it is quite intelligent (if a bit dated in the present day). There's a lot of depth to Dawn of the Dead and it's all well thought out and planned rather than being generic and unoriginal like so many other modern horror movies.

There characters (especially Ken Foree) are all strong and believable and react with logic and sense rather than annoying panic. It's interesting to see how normal people take on facing the end of civilization (if not the end of the world...just humans) with just simple tools and the bare minimum at their reach.

The opinions over the original and remake are pretty much split. I think that both are very strong efforts at true horror and instead of regarding them as original/remake I think it's wiser to consider them as two separate stories both happening at the same time.

Each film has their weaknesses and strengths. The zombies in the original are a bit too comical to be truly threatening. While in the remake they'd be on you, ripping your throat out before you can even say 'What the..?' And the actual 'DAWN' of the dead was more emphasized in the remake. Though the original has more of a true epic feel to it.

This release features 3 different versions of the film. The 126 minute American cut, the 117 minute European Cut and the Extended 139 minute version. The German 156 cut does not get a mention. Extra features are plentiful and, for once, they're for a film where extras make sense, not the fluff we get usually. Two big documentaries 'The Dead Will Walk' and 'Document of the Dead' are included as well as loads of commentaries, interviews, clips, trailers etc. Even a mini version of the first issue of the DOTD comic book. The American and European versions are Divimax which means an excellent 1.85:1 anamorphic picture and Dolby 6.1/DTS sound. The extended cut is plain old anamorphic and Mono.

This is definitely a horror classic, far above Psycho and Silence of the Lambs. True greatness and not only an important film but a true labor of love. Everyone involved made it because they love the genre and were not just trying to pay this weeks rent cheque. An important element missing from 99.99% of horror films made these days. Keep a lookout for Jason make-up man Tom Savini (who is always the highlight of any movie) as Blade an remember Ken Foree's chilling prophecy...'When there is no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth'",1096675200,5,3552,4.565149136577708

816803,2,6304240554,"There may have been arguments over watching this movie and I lost miserably. I'd already seen the remake, didn't particularly care that much about seeing the original, but seemed like an appropriate movie to watch in the dark with plenty of alcohol. (And I still needed more) I wanted to watch The Mummy Returns, but I just watched it when I got home. I managed most of this movie, I did close my eyes a couple of times, cos it was really getting that boring. (A trick I perfected during Evil Dead 2, except I kept my eyes closed longer)

What didn't I like about this movie? Two main things that spring to mind. The ""zombies"" for one. Almost every ""zombie"" movie portrays them as almost robotic. Some imagination could be used. Sure, they're the undead, but they're all pretty similar. It's not like Beetlejuice, where this person drowned, or this person got cut in half, or this person smoked too much. The ""zombies"" are just splattered with random bits of blood. I'd rather something like Beetlejuice, or where they seem normal until the very last minute. That would be more original.

My second problem was the characters. I'm sorry but I did not feel any sympathy for them! Unless you're a very special birthday boy, or Mekhi Phifer, then you don't get any sympathy from me. Sorry characters.

The special effects were quite good, considering this was made in the seventies. (Another thing, I rarely like seventies movies apart from Grease, and a couple of others. Give me Halloween and I'll throw it baack in your face) The blood looked slightly dodgy at times, but that's to be expected.

I've noticed reading a few of the other reviews, they're done by men. I'm female (I can give you someone who can vouch for that). Maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it as much?

Watch the remake or Shaun of the Dead. Much, much better.",1095811200,9,1828,4.612307692307692

Three versions (the US theatrical edit, the ""extended"" version and the ""European"" edit), plus TV and radio spots, bios, audio commentary (including one by the film's four stars), theatrical trailers and a DVD full of documentaries. Everything a Romero/Zombie fan could ask for.

The discs have been mastered into glorious ""living"" color, and the sound quality is great.

On of my two complaints is that some of the ""bonus"" features on Disc 2 don't work on my DVD player, but play perfectly on my Macintosh computer's SuperDrive (If you have a similar problem, try watching the disc on your computer if it's DVD compatable).

My other complaint is the unecessary additions to Roy Frumkes' otherwise excellent documentary ""Document of the Dead"". Roy, I saw your film at the School of Visual Arts in NYC and thought it was great. Did you HAVE to tack on all that updated material at the end of the film? I believe that a seperate update, akin to a ""Return of Document of the Dead""  would have been more appropriate.

Still, if you are a DOTD fan, Romero worshipper, Zombie freak, or someone who drove all the way out to Monroeville, Pennsylvania just to see the shopping mall where it was filmed, this is for you.

The fourth disk has a couple of documentaries (including Roy Frumkes ""Document of the Dead""). Why does this collection rock? Well, if only for the European Cut which contains none of the library music that Romero used. Instead we get the complete Goblin score. I don't know why George used library music, but it doesn't compare to Goblin's tracks. I prefer the European version over all the others just because it is tighter and has the superior soundtrack. There's really only one gore effect missing and that's the chopper beheading. The US theatrical version is the same that was released earlier this year. The extended version is interesting and contains more mall footage and some slightly extended scenes. All in all, a great collection, but really only for true fans.

Ok I know that some of the make-up fx and dialouge are a bit dated but the overall integrity all around is solid.
The documentries and poster and image galleries and not to mention the crisp quality of the picture and sound are rich and fascinating to watch.
I have only watched the extended version there are two others one edited by Dario Argento and the other is Romeros original theatrical version.
This is zombie geek-dom at its finest!!!!

816810,5,6304240554,"Anchor Bay have outdone themselves with this one.  This has to be the most complete package they've ever assembled.  It's only for the hardcore Romero fan though, so I'd stick with the theatrical dvd that came out a few months back if you're just a casual fan.  4 discs on this baby:  The first one is the theatrical version we've all seen many times.  The second is the extended version which some of us have seen.  It's about 10+ minutes longer and includes some extra dialogue, extra gore, more biker footage and more shopping footage and newsroom footage as well.  It also has a scene that explains how the ""Have you got any cigarettes?"" cop appears out of nowhere.  Disc 3 is Dario Argento's European cut.  This is interesting.  It runs about ten minutes shorter than the theatrical version  yet contains snippets-usually a few seconds-of footage not seen in either the theatrical or extended versions!  You're probably asking why bother including a third disc?  Why not take the ""new"" footage from Argento's version and put it in the Extended version to make one long cut of the film?  Well, in Argento's version, there are some snippets removed from the film as well.  This kinda takes from the humor and character development, but Argento's interested in pacing here.  He edits these scenes and rearranges the music on the soundtrack so the ""action"" music plays in totally different scenes, making the movie move at a totally different pace.  In fact, the first half hour just zooms by in this version.  They're at the mall 30 minutes into it which isn't the case with the other versions.  It slows down when necessary, but Argento keeps the movie going.  In fact, he edits it so it looks like a Dario Argento film.  Whether you love his version or hate it is up to your personal taste.  It's not better or worse, just different.  A huge hit in Europe as well.  Disc 4 is the extra goodies.  It has a retrospective 75 minute documentary that talks to all the stars in front and behind the camera.  Very cool.  It also has Roy Frumkes' Document of the Dead, a hour and a half documentary made while Romero was filming Dawn.  I saw this years ago and it's very fun to watch.  There's also a tour of the mall with Ken Foree and other cast memebers, as well as other documentary footage.  All four discs come with the trailers and still galleries as you'd expect.  The first three discs all have commentaries by different people.  Basically this set will keep you busy for awhile.  If you're a huge fan of this film, I'm sure you know this set is out now, and I can tell you that it's worth every penny, so snatch it as soon as you can.  Fantastic movie(all 3).

It has the original US theatrical version (which was also released in March by Anchor Bay), the extended ""Director's Cut"" and my personal favorite, the European version. I saw this version in Germany when it first came out. George is a great director, but Dario Argento edited the version for non-english speaking countries and came up with a tighter, sometimes more aggresive version. And how can you not like the extra music by Goblin. The extras alone on this ultimate edition are worth the cost, from the 92 minute new documentary to Roy Frumkes ""Document of the Dead"" and all the theatrical trailers from around the world to the different audio commentary on each edition.

I looked forward to seeing the sequel Dawn of the Dead and when I finally did I was horrified at how bad it was. It turned a frightening atmospheric and tense situation into a cheesy, laughable almost unwatchable film. The story is paper thin, the relationships between the characters that was the heart and soul of the NOTLD are gone in this one to make room for sequences that run on too long or have no reason for being. The zombies in the apartment scene are the only ones that convey any tension, once you enter the mall everything is lost and comical. The music and look of the film reminds me of some public service film I would watch on an old reel in school only having to do with funny looking zombies. With all its flaws though I was able to stay with the film up until the biker gang broke into the mall. This was completely out of left field and made no sense at all to the plot. It was like they had used up all their ideas so they came up with a biker gang. Pointless and useless and it is this very plot turn that sinks any hope of salvation for this movie. After this you know that no ending could save it. The exact same thing was done with 28 Days Later but instead of a biker gang it was some army guys. It sunk that movie too. With Dawn being so bad on its own I have no idea why someone would want a set with 3 versions of this movie, each differing by only slight edits or having a different soundtrack, or being a bit longer. It's still the same terrible movie and ultimately one of the worst ever. Therefore, I have no choice but to label this the worst DVD set ever.

Sure, it may not have CGI Effects, like most film today, but that's what makes it so cool.  In my opinion, the best scary movies came from the days when it all had to be done with your bare hands (so to speak).

This Ultimate Edition should not be missed by true fans of Romero and/or the DEAD films.  Get ready!  DAWN OF THE DEAD is back on DVD, with a vengeance!",1093996800,,684,4.271317829457364
816953,1,6304240554,"I'm not trying to desecrate any opinions or start any fights, but there have been several reviews bashing this film, and I truly have to agree w/them.  The film is certainly not a ""horror classic,"" as it has been called, and it's much more hyped up than it deserves to be.

We can start w/the good things about this film:  the tagline is great, the music decent, and the idea is truly horrifying, but the feeling I get from this film is that Romero doesn't always know what direction he wants to take.  The acting and the writing are so unbelievably bad, the film provides many more laughs than scares, so at first, you're under the impression that Romero is trying to make a comedy.  Then, at the most random times, he makes the decision to throw some of the goriest and most disturbing scenes at you, as though he's saying, ""This entire film you haven't been taking me seriously.  Well...take me seriously NOW!""  Whether he's trying to provide viewers w/a funny film or a scary film, Romero fails miserably.

Then, there's the make-up effects:  this is where we must give Night of the Living Dead its points.  Despite the fact that it was created during an earlier age, the zombies actually look like zombies.  Dawn of the Dead, which was released in 1978, ten years after its predecessor, has had a good while to progress in the field of make-up...this is not evident.  The blood is pink, and the zombies look like (and probably are) just a group of extras that have had their faces splashed with gray paint, and you can actually see the lines on their necks where the make-up ends, and on top of that, the zombies are slow, stupid, and completely non-menacing.  The film is much longer than it needs to be, offers no character development, and is boring in every aspect.  Night of the Living Dead definitely has its corny moments, but after seeing it, you definitely feel the need to look behind you every once in while.  After seeing Dawn, you'll find yourself feeling sleepy.

We now move on to the most important aspect of the film.  The previews, posters, and pretty much all forms of publicity use the phrase, ""When there is no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.""  Despite this fact, it is never once explained in the film that this is the reason why the dead are returning to life.  In fact, we receive no explanation at all for this ""phenomenon"" (for lack of a better term).  There is actually plenty of unexplained material and activity in this film.  The beginning makes no sense, whatsoever, and neither does the biker scene that serves as the climactic end.  For example, during the ""biker"" raid, one thug, despite the fact that he's surrounded by several hungry zombies, randomly decides to give himself a blood pressure test.  Naturally, he's devoured w/in a matter of seconds.

Finally, there seems to be some sort of idea that this is Romero's take on social commentary.  He has denied this on several occasions.

In conclusion, I would say completely avoid the original.  The remake is a huge improvement, offering greater acting, writing, character development, and zombies that can definitely be defined as ""NASTY.""",1093910400,7,3151,4.681818181818182
816954,1,6304240554,"This is a piece of crap. What the hell is everybody thinking? The zombies all look the same. The special effects aren't very special. The acting is terrible. Romero fails to tackle consumerism. How can this be a classic?

Now the start of the movie is just boring and pointless. Dozens of people in a news studio are just yelling and screaming endlessly. People are turning into zombies all around the world, and one man cares about nothing but his ratings. Just stupid.

It seems to me that the zombies in the movie were the worst done in any movie. The moved incredibly slow. Slower than Night, Resident Evil, and Day. They were uninteresting. They do not scare the audience. In fact, the viewers laugh at them through the entire movie. This movie is nothing more than a terrible comedy.

I didn't realize this movie had gore. I know it had pink liquid, but not gore. Then it had this stupid thing where the zombies were afraid of fire. ZOMBIES WOUlD NOT BE AFRAID OF FIRE!!! Romero just can't think of things that make sence. Whoever scored the movie did a terrible job. It was ridiculous.

Let's ask god to strike Romero down before he finishes his fourth dead film. His first three were crap and complete failures that hardly made money. What makes him think his fourth one will do good?",1093564800,7,1292,4.556034482758621

Then, one of my buddies invites me to go see it (I'm 11 at the time)  ""The movie takes place in a mall, and we're gonna see it at the new mall, Twelve Oaks!""  Okay, to be honest, I didn't make it through it the first time (It scared the crap out of me!)  I finally watched it again in High School, and it has since become one of my favorite movies.  I think it made such a lasting impression on me due to the fact that I saw it in a shopping mall.  This is the pinacle of 1970's horror.  (The remake isn't half bad, but this is the original)  This film has everything working for it...Director, story, music, mood and acting.

DISC 1: The origian unrated director's cut.  NOT THE EXTENDED EDITION, which is not truly Romero's director's cut.  This disc includes commentary with George Romero, Tom Savini, and Chris Romero along with Theatrical trailers and radio spots.

DISC 2: The extended edition, often mistaken for a 'director's cut.'  This disc includes an additional 12 minutes of glorious footage.  Also includes commentary by producer Richard Rubinstein, who also helmed the recent Dawn of the Dead remake. The disc has a commercial for the Monroville Mall and a memorabilia gallery.

DISC 3: The Dario Argento cut.  This version of the film has less humor and more drama, released in Europe with additional music from Goblin.  This version includes commentary by all four stars of the film.

DISC 4: This disc contains several documentaries including the all new THE DEAD WALK (75 min) and the classic DOCUMENT OF THE DEAD; a feature-length documentary shot during the making of Dawn of the Dead.  This disc also includes home movies from the set and a tour of the Monroeville Mall with actor Ken Foree.

Buy this DVD set, you won't be sorry.  Even if you haven't seen the film, for any zombie fan, this is a must own.",1093046400,141,1378,4.783898305084746

I did like the remake,but not as much as the orginal. The Monroville mall was much better then the one they used in the remake. And what was up with those stores in the remake?!That was an odd mall in the remake. The Mall in the orginal film was more like the mall's I go to. Well I will get this set. But how miny more times do I need to buy this movie?I have the old Thorn EMI video. I have 2 Directors cut of this movie on Laserdisc,1 CAV,1 CLV,and The Divimax DVD.And I guess a few years down the road when HD DVD comes out Anchor Bay will do an HD Dawn of The Dead. That would be a cool thing to see Dawn in HD!I heard George is making another Dead film ""Land of the Dead"" I guess there's a city that's ignoring the problem,and I think the survivors in the movie has put a wall around the city to keep the Zombies from coming into the city. Well that's what I heard about the new movie. If you ask me I think he should bring Peter and Fran back?I alway wonder what became of them after they flew away at the end of Dawn?",1092528000,7,1168,3.932489451476793
816958,5,6304240554,"One thing about George Romero, he's not shy about milking his creations for all their worth.  God knows how many editions of Night of the Living Dead there are available in various collections or editions.

First, lets just call it as it is.  Dawn of the Dead..the original is the greatest Zombie movie ever and one of the scariest movies ever.  Picking up after NOTLD, by now the Zombies have run rampant and people are fleeing wherever they can.

A small group of four including two SWAT team members a TV reporter, and her helicopter pilot boyfriend flee the city, finally setting down on the roof of a large, suburban shopping mall.

The soon realize that the mall has everything they need to sustain them including shelter, food, water, even a bank loaded with cash just in case man survives.  But first, they must clean the mall of hundreds of zombies who roam the halls because the mall was an important place in their life.

The four go on a hunt and destroy mission to first seal the doors to the mall and block them with large semi-trucks.  Then they kill off all the zombies in the mall and our living a life of relative ease when a rogue group of bikers led by make-up guru Tom Savini comes storming into the mall to loot it.

With the mall now filled with zombies again the four have to fight off the zombies and bikers.

Savini is at the top of his game giving us incredible and incredibly gory effects like the face exploding from the shotgun, the top of a zombie head being sheared off by a chopper blade, and various scenes of entrails being torn out from still living victims and eaten by the zombies.

To some extent, now 25 years later or so the effect look a bit dated.  The blood in parts looks more like red paint but still this is one great movie and the one which all other zombie movies must compare to.

It is far better than the recent remake and superior to the sequel ""Day of the Dead"".  Again, while we have no big name actors, those we do do a comendable job and do not seem as amateurish as in the Night or Day.

The ultimate edition will have 3 cuts of the movie.  The theatrical release, the Directors cut and the European cut.  Each of these will have separate audio commentary tracks.

The 4th disk is filled with extras including documentaries, interviews, stills, and more.  It really is the Ultimate edition!",1092355200,11,2348,4.416279069767442
816959,3,6304240554,"DAWN OF THE DEAD follows the story that began in NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Dead people are coming back to life as flesh eating zombies and no one really has any idea why. A small group of survivors, including a mall cop and a couple of news reporters, finds a refuge from the terror by boarding themselves up in a shopping mall. Zombies begin flocking to the mall in droves, but have no way of entering. Giving in to their every whim and desire, the group settles down to a fairly comfortable existence until a roving motorcycle gang finds out they have a helicopter. The motor gang has no desire to move in and live in the safety of the mall, but wants everything for their own. Their invasion of the mall brings about the film's climatic finish.

Though the movie is fairly graphic and is a zombie flick, it's actually more of a commentary on materialism and consumerism and how it affects and infects all of us. As a commentary, the film is almost brilliant. As a zombie movie, DAWN OF THE DEAD set the bar for almost every other zombie movie to come. However, DAWN OF THE DEAD is also a movie and as a movie, it has a lot of faults. Like a Charles Dicken's novel, just about everything interesting or worthwhile that happens, occurs near the beginning and end of the movie. The middle, which should be the meat of the movie, doesn't contain much substance and the long commentary on our culture goes on too long. Nevertheless, even though the film isn't for the squeemish, DAWN OF THE DEAD is worth watching if your a fan of zombie or horror movies. Also, it's a movie that film buffs should watch just because there are very few horror films that are made that have a social context as deep as a Romero film and DAWN OF THE DEAD is one of the best.",1092096000,,1753,4.344512195121951

This 1979 cult classic gore fest is definitely worthy of ownership if your a fan of the horror genre and not squeamish. The second installment in George A. Romero's Zombie trilogy sees the undead zombies seeking out live flesh once again. Once again Tom Savini the special effects genius and gore wizard pulls it all off with the right amount of blood and gore. Considering that ""Dawn of the Dead"" was very controversial at the time of its release, it seems tame by today's standards.

Anchor Bay has gone all out for this release. The picture and sound for this special Divimax Edition is dynamic to say the least. The picture is crisp and clear and sound options range from mono to 5.1 Dolby Digital and DTS. This version is like nothing I've ever seen or heard before. The first time I saw this movie was at the drive-in, so the picture was average and the sound was crappy at best. Some people believe this movie was terribly bad, but yet it inspired dozen's of zombie films and it and continues to shock even today.

There are extra features and commentaries included and I found them to be quite informative and interesting. This incredible follow-up to Romero's classic ""Night of the Living Dead"" will continue to pull at your flesh. While trying to outwit the flesh eating Zombies, four people find refuge and lock themselves inside a shopping mall to get away from the undead.

Will the mall provide the protection from the gathering masses of Zombies or will they become the Zombies next meal?

817023,5,6304240554,"A four disc edition? Who can ask for more? Obviously we saw it coming... the remake was there... the Divimax edition early this year... everybody was saying a big multi-disc edition was coming... and here it is!
To start analyzing this film we must take a look at NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. This film was a landmark as it introduced the zombies as we know today. Now, DAWN OF THE DEAD set a new landmark. In it, the zombies were a mature (sub)genre in modern cinema.
What makes this film so important? Everything! First it is the brilliant screenplay. The story... you already know: as the zombie population increases more and more, four people barricate themselves inside a big shopping mall, where they endulge themselves with all consumering desires they can think of.
Sounds simple? It is, but there is more than meets the eye: as the zombies try to get in (you'll have to wonder why) the four heroes inside discover their paradise makes them more empty than they would have thought it would... and slowly, life start making no sense.
DAWN OF THE DEAD is the kind of film that has been changing as the decades pass. Its violence seems to have softened if we think of all the action and horror films who came in the decades that followed (just like it happened with other horror landmarks like THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, FRIDAY THE 13TH, HALLOWEEN and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD). Its makeup is not comparable to the vast majority of horror films that came after (who had bigger makeup budgets)... but on the other hand, elements like tension, drama, character development and social critique have all grown more powerful then in all of the films that followed.
In other words, audiences who see this film today, many times discover the fact that its weight is changing fields... from graphic horror to social horror. And this kind of horror is no less potent and much more rare.
Mr. Romero is one of those rare horror screenwriter/directors who do have a strong critic point of view (and we can see it as he continues to deliver so in his later third zombie film - the sadly underated gem - DAY OF THE DEAD).
Clearly, this is a multi-layered film that demands multiple levels of reading. You must be aware of all the issues put inside this film. Otherwise, if you're in just for the cheap thrills, gore and violence, you'll probably be disappointed.
As a product of the late seventies, this is a production triumph because it manages to deliver a lot with minimum budget. The remake released early this year made a great update on this basic premisse.
I loved them both.
This edition seems to be more than we've all asked for (now that the simpler Divimax edition made all the money it could...). Here, you'll find all the versions and lots of extras.
But again... DAWN OF THE DEAD is a film that I am sure will be seen and celebrated for years to come. See it with an open mind and you too will discover why.",1090108800,10,2912,4.559160305343512
817024,5,6304240554,"I must be honest, I almost got tricked into buying the DiviMax edition aswell, but after taking a look at what features it had on it and hearing rumours about this four-disc edition, I decided not to bother. All in all by looking at the cover art and reading about what will be on it, I believe that this edition will be a great buy for the month of September and for any Dead fan out there and, hopefully it will be the last edition for this particular movie. I can just see it now, six months from now, brand new ""SIX DISC"" Special Edition, that would be quite a sight .",1089590400,3,572,4.116071428571429
817025,4,6304240554,"Going into this movie, I had high hopes, and all in all it filled them. I ended up watching the first half with some friends, who are not ones who usually would pick this type of movie. As you would have guessed, they didn't take to the film to well and we ended up stopping it after the white army dude stabbed a zombie in the ear and the bright pink blood poured out. They said it was to fake. We did get a share of laughs out of it though. For example when they are raiding the apartment building and the fat guy busts down a door and shoots one of the occupants causing his head to explode. Good stuff!
I myself believe the introduction that uses the television station could have been cut a little shorter, but hey I can't change it so Ill just fast forward.
The gore effects in this movie are extreme for its time. The biting and the shooting is all the gore you get until you get into the meat of the film. The best gore through out the film has got to be the part where the zombies tear the stomachs open of a couple of the bikers, intense. They actually show the intestines spilling out and the bikers faces as they scream in agony.

By not stating what I thought was funny, I'll just allow the viewer to pick out his or her own comedic parts with in the movie. Believe me, you will find at the very least one part in this film funny. If not a laugh out loud then a slight chuckle.
If I may I would like to say to J. from Montclair that did the review that is one star and long, dude you are reading way to into this man. This is not totally a serious horror movie. Your dissecting it from every angle possible, you can't do that with this movie or it will suck. Once again, it's not totally serious.

Well this DVD has some nice extras like posters, radio and TV spots, trailers, different sound settings, and more. It's worth it if you are a horror/gore movie fan.",1089244800,3,1875,4.120218579234972

First the original, then another version of the original, then the director's cut, then the DiviMax Special Edition...now this. Just like the Evil Dead series, they just keep on cranking out these ""new limited edition""-style DVDs.
I don't mean to bash this DVD, I'm sure it will be good, but I question the companies that release new DVD versions of films every other month. It's usually low-budget horror flicks with huge cult followings.
Anyway...I paid $17.99 on the DiviMax edition and although I'm interested in buying this one, frankly, I feel a bit ripped off. I know I'm probably not alone when I say: STOP RELEASING MULTIPLE EDITIONS. Get it right the first time. Two versions, tops. Not five, six, seven, etc.",1089072000,26,813,4.856115107913669
817027,1,6304240554,"Yet again, another zombie flick I considered OUTRAGEOUSLY overrated. The two others I'd seen were ""Day of the Dead"" and ""Dead Alive"", two films, like this, I thought were very boring, and asked myself ""what's the big deal?"" all throught. Atleast ""Dead Alive"" was more of a horror film than this and ""Day of the Dead"". ""Dawn of the Dead"", somewhat like ""Dead Alive"", is very much an action film. Actually, im not sure you could even call that, becuase nothing really happens thorought the whole thing. The un-likeable charectors steal some stuff from the stores, and shoot zombies. It also has annoying comedy that takes away the any possible fear you could get from it. Theres barely any charector development, tho theres plenty of time for it. ""Dawn of the Dead"" is also one of those annoying know-it-all films that are sopposued to saterize on the way people live. Maybe the writer was so foucused on this aspect, that he forget to fill in any scares? To me, this was a complete waste of two hours. I definetely don't reccomend this, unless you have to see every popular movie ever made.",1089072000,2,1089,4.677083333333333
817125,1,6304240554,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Followed closely behind by Night of the Living Dead. The zombies all look like crap. They grey skin makes a very unrealistic zombie. The boring movement of the zombies forces the viewer to fall asleep before they even get to the mall.
I think the characters overreact a little. Steven walks straight up to the zombie and gets ready to shoot. Turns out he waisted all his bullets shooting at nothing. That's right. NOTHING. Once he realizes this, he throws his hands in the air and runs off like a scared little girl running for him mommy. Why not just knock the zombie down? It's not like it's going to run at him.
""Martinez! We think what you're up to is more important than this zombie problem. Come out now, or we'll go in there and let one of our guys go crazy."" Martinez was evil. Worst than the plague of zombies.
Another thing. Where was the military in all this. This is something they would get involved with. I was happy to see the military was doing something to stop this zombie plague during the New Dawn. Not like Romero's movie. Why wasn't the military doing anything in Romero's movie? Because they can handle a bunch of slow, boring zombies.
People say that the new Dawn does not have an explanation for the zombies. Neither did this movie. In Night of the Living Dead they thought it was radiation from a sattelite that caused the mutations. They didn't confirm that. In Dawn of the Dead (1978) the people on the Emergency Broadcasting System said they were looking for the answer in the terms of a viral outbreak. That was not confirmed. That means Romero never told the answer. He just gave suggestions, just tlike the New Dawn. Dawn of the Dead (2004) suggested that a virus might be the reason. So people can't use that against the new Dawn.
The acting was just terrible. Roger was the idiot of the group. The guy everyone couldn't wait to get killed. Not only was he trying to get himself killed. He was trying to get Peter killed. What a f*****. Hey Rog. ""There are only about ten zombies around you. Why not shoot them all in the head, then get in Peter's truck? Maybe you won't get bit.""
The biggest problem the movies has is the incredible amount of boredom it brings. George tried to make it scary. He did a poor job. George Romero isn't some great director who makes perfect movies. His movies sucked as much as House of the Dead did.
If Romero's fourth dead film is not as good as the remake of Dawn, then everyone can shut up about Romero being some kind of great director. Romero sucks.
George Romero comes out of no where with a 35mm camera, does zombies in his own style, and tells everyone that zombies must be done like this from now on. What a jerk. How dare he try to tell people what to do. I can do zombies the way I want to. Get out of my way George.
I don't know what Romero's trying to say with this movie, but it doesn't get through to the viewer who is already sleeping because of the boredom. What good would millions of dollars do a gang of bikers in the middle of a world where everyone is dead. They got the money, but now they have nothing to spend it on. Everyone's a zombie because the military didn't take action. Stupid military. Why didn't they do anything about this?
The news man with an eye-patch claims that zombies are motorized instinct. If that's true, then why do they use tools. Your instincts don't tell you to grab coins out of the fountain. They don't tell you to wave a hockey stick around. Why do they do it?
Now the biggest question of all. WHY ARE ZOMBIES AFRAID OF FIRE? ZOMBIES ARE AFRAIDE OF FIRE, BUT THEY ARN'T AFRAID OF A GUN POINTED STRAIGHT AT THEIR HEADS. ZOMBIES KNOW WHAT FIRE WILL DO TO THEM, BUT THEY DON""T KNOW WHAT A GUN WILL DO TO THEM. Sounds to me like Romero just needed to find an answer. Romero never told anyone why zombies are afraid of fire. Just like they never told why zombies don't eat dogs in the new Dawn.
People say that the fast-moving zombies arn't intimidating. Neither are the slow ones. Maybe the character in the movie was afraid of a zombie 100 feet away from him, but I wasn't scared at all. I was bored.
WHY DO ZOMBIES HAVE SUCH STRONG ARMS BUT SUCH WEAK LEGS. ROMERO HAS ESTABLISHED THE FACT THAT ZOMBIES CAN FORCE A PERSON TO A WALL. IS HE TRYING TO TELL US THAT SLOW MOVING ZOMBIES ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO FORCE SOMEONE ON THE GROUND? They can pin people to a wall, but they can't run. They say god doesn't give you two hands and they were right. Got the upper body strength, but no the lower boddy strength. That's hard to believe.
Anyone who tells you that this movie is better than the remake is full of sh**. The remake beats this movie in every way possible. What good is character developement when the idiots are the ones to die. The two make it out alive. Nice ending Romero. Dawn of the Dead (2004) had the best ending to a movie ever. They all died. That's great. Hardly anyone is brave enough to do that in a movie. It's more realistic than Romero's ending, where they flyi away and you don't know what happens to them.
I give this movie 0/5 stars 0/10 stars 0/15 stars 0/100 stars 1/1000 stars.

The movie had good special effects and a great story line. This movie and the other Night and Day will remain classics throughout history. Overall i give this movie 5/5. The story is a group of swat officers take refuge in a shopping mall during a zombie epidemic. The differnece is in this one from the new one is they could leave at will. They had a helicopter and everything! I'd be in paradise if i was them. I won't ruin the rest but it was a good movie, now here are the special features.

817127,2,6304240554,"When i found out that there was a remake of George A Romero's classic , Dawn of the Dead being produced in America i was very excited about seeing it , because i am a number 1 fan of the whole concept of ''the dead walking the earth '' and giving us horror buffs a really meaty series of deaths to gag on .
  The first time i ever saw DoD i knew ther would be no horror to ever match the intensity and the blackness of what the human world had found its self in after the dead had taken over.
  I enjoyed the fact that allthough every live human was going to get it in the neck sooner or later, there was some balance, as the dead could not move as fast, and could not use tools, in effect,they were DEAD.
  The 2004 version was always going to have the flash new special effects but the Production Crew did not even take advantage of that very creativley.
  The Dead do not run. They are Dead.
  The film spent too much time dealing with emotions and personal conflict.
  There should have been more time devoted with edge of the seat drama of how the ''virus'' started spreading and of the killing of people who did not know what was going on.
  The children in the bus scene was quite disturbing and if the film had given us more of this type of horror instead of the cat & mouse senario then i would have been worthy of the title of DoD remake.
 The make up was quite good and there were some memorable moments but it fell flat. I had been looking forward to a remake for many years and have even contemplated writing a screenplay myself dealing with the post Day of the Dead world, Maby someday i will , but i was rather hoping sombody else would take up the challenge who is more qualified than me to produce a truly horrific movie in this genere that G.A Romero created. I'm just a dumb Screenprinter.
  If the producers really want to redeem themselves they should finish the job and do a Day of the Dead remake style of movie with no running dead and truly horriffic death scenes , some hope for the human race and with an intelligent ending , any ideas?, i have many.

817128,3,6304240554,"I have to agree with Stu (below) on this one.  I'm a huge horror movie fan, even a zombie movie fan (I really liked 21 Days Later), but I honestly don't see why this movie is considered by so many to be one of the greatest of the genre.
1) The special effects are not so special--in some cases you can actually see where the blue zombie makeup ends at the actors' necks!
2) The acting is bad--really, porno movie bad, particularly in the first half of the film (though I admit it does get better in the second half).
3) I get the social commentary (the zombies can't stay away from the shopping mall), but it only goes so far.
All that being said, I don't think this movie is horrible.  There are some decidedly scary scenes, and I think the story develops at a reasonable (albeit leisurely) pace.  I just don't think it deserves ""classic"" status.
I know this is not the popular viewpoint, but there it is.",1087948800,,906,4.317647058823529

4 Stars for the DVD release (DiviMax)
Yes, this is a great DVD considering that, for years, Romero fans have had to put up with awful quality VHS versions, and even when they were good (Thorn-EMI's VHS of ""Dawn of the Dead"" was by far the most complete version of Romero's U.S. theatrical cut of the film) the films still suffered... not from image quality necessarily (DVD lends itself to a general cleanup of the image, and the copy is usually struck from master negatives or interpositives of the film direct from the vault), but from lack of things like... drumroll please: extra features.  Sure, VHS was not a format for such things, but then that format seems wickedly prehistoric nowadays.
For those that can wait-- and I totally urge this, because I think the practice of releasing DVDs without many extras as a run-up to a second ""expanded edition"" release to be tantamount to highway robbery -- there is indeed a full-blown multi-disc set coming out in September from Anchor Bay... it will be a bit more expensive, but what the heck... if you're a fan, and this film seems to be made for fans (of Romero's previous work and the horror/splatter genre in general) then it's worth the wait and the added dollars spent.

817197,2,6304240554,"Yeah I saw this film right before the remake came out.  To sum this film up I would say it's like Shaft vs. the Zombies.  There is no horror in this film.  It's not scary.  It's funny if nothing else.  The zombies are very pathetic; George Romero doesn't even hide this.  Now I'm not saying you can't put horror with comedy (evil dead 2).  But the enemy isn't threatening.  There are only one or two really gory parts in the entire movie.  The zombies in the remake are much more dangerous.  This film is pathetic simply put.  But that's not to say I didn't enjoy it.  In fact I've made it sound much worse then it really is.  And I also enjoyed ""Night"".  I've seen much worse and if you have a few hours to kill; check out this little late 70's classic.
I'll add this statement, due to the person below me (Jeremy Boettcher) saying that if one thought it was cheesy than they think that i know what you did last summer should win an acadamy award.  So to clear things up, i HATE WITH PASSION films like Scream and ""Summer"".  My favorite Horror film is the Orginal Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Just because everyone praises a film like dawn dosn't make it good.  Break down the structure/acting/events of the film and you would realize that there is nothing special about this film.",1086048000,4,1279,4.3931623931623935

When the world is being overrun by zombies 4 people hide out in a shopping mall, and horror ensues. Recommended highly! everyone did a good job on this from the acting to the direction to the music. i have not seen the remake yet and i am sure it will not be as good as this!

817199,5,6304240554,"After finishing this movie, I was filled with mixed emotions.  I did not see the first or the third, but now that this has captured my attention I will inevitably see them both.  The plot gets you so into the lives of the  characters without actually telling the story of their lives, if that makes any sense.  It may just be me but i think that during the movie, i felt connected with them, trapped in that mall with them, it was a pretty cool experience.  Get this movie, you shouldn't need to read this to convince you, it just gives off an aura of excellence when you see it.  Not for everyone however; if you don't like violence, even if it is 70's effects, don't buy it, rent it and see it with a boyfriend or girlfriend.

Much more intense and bloody than its predecessor film (Night of the Living Dead), DOTD drags the viewer into a nightmare world inhabited by living corpses who feed on the living and the dwindling number of humans who fight them.  The plot follows four people (two TV station employees and two SWAT team members) who take a helicopter and make a run out of a zombie-infested city to try to find somewhere safe.  They do find what is utopia:  A shopping mall loaded with everything needed for survival.  However, it too is overrun by the living dead who show no signs of leaving voluntarily.
Although some of the effects are dated, this film is NOT for the squeamish.  For the horror film buff or zombie fanatic, this film is a must-see.",1085443200,,813,4.496598639455782

From this chaos a few escape by helicopter, a couple of SWAT guys (one black of course!), a wimpy nerd who oozes fear, his feeble girlfriend, and you know the rest.....So these people take over a shopping mall and have a blast living in free luxury until the zombies figure out a way into their secure compound.

817204,5,6304240554,"Silly me.  I rushed out to buy this movie because a) I love Dawn, and b) it's been criminally out of print on DVD for years, and the older sets sell for a lot of $ on ebay.  However, Anchor Bay has announced that they're selling a deluxe version of the film in late 2004, so looks like I'll have to buy it...again.
The next version will likely be a double disc set with two different cuts of the film.  Dawn exists in several different cuts, and the names are not helpful.  The actual 'Director's Cut' is not George Romero's definitive version of the film.  The version Romero considers his 'director's cut' is the American Theatrical version.  I believe the Director's Cut is similar to the cut that Dario Argento prepared for the European release, and is titled 'Zombie' for the continent (which is why Fulci's unofficial 'prequel' is called 'Zombie 2'.)  There is also a German cut of the film that is the longest (over 140 minutes, I believe) and is commonly sold on ebay.  I'm sure various bits and pieces were cut depending on where it was released (for instance, in the past the UK version omitted an exploding head and a couple of flesh-tearing close-ups.)
The version on this disc is only slighly different than the VHS of the American Theatrical version I have.  This version omits part of the scene on the police dock between Steven and Fran and the cops who are running.  It doesn't really matter though, the film is not upset by this change.  The blood and gore is fully intact here, though.  This DVD looks and sounds amazing--this is the best looking Dawn I've ever seen.  The colors are brighter, the print is cleaner, it's top notch.
There is now a commentary track by no less than four people including Romero, his wife, and Tom Savini.  Then there's a 'moderator', which is laughable, to be honest.  I don't really like 'moderators' for this type of thing, and the guy is totally unnecessary.  You can tell he's fawning over Romero, and sometimes he tries to get in his canned questions (as if reading from a pad) while the rest of the crew are yukking it up, recalling the making of the film.  I would rather hear honest, straightforward commentary than some pining stooge sucking up to Romero and Savini, but hey, this is better than nothing.
There are also trailers, TV spots, and other goodies on this disc.  All in all, a very welcome package by Anchor Bay, a company dedicated to horror fans, it would seem.  However, for the Dawn addict, I would say wait until late '04 to buy the deluxe edition, guaranteed to have more good stuff (check out Anchor Bay's web page.)
As for the film, I won't say much, except that it's probably one of the best horror films ever, at least American horror films.  The theme is basically timeless, though the 2004 remake was quite good and turned the story into an action film, which worked well.  The film has some shortcomings, sure (acting at times, effects), but the overall atmosphere is very strong, and the bright, comic-book look is perfect.  This is a highly recommended film, and a great DVD.",1083024000,4,3059,4.584558823529412
817205,5,6304240554,"This movie was made in the late 70's but it's still a great movie.

I know; who am I to tell George Romero what a zombie movie should or should not be?  This is probably the quintessential movie of the genre.  Well, I just don't like it very much.  It's not that entertaining.  I liked the first of the series.  The third is enjoyable in its own way.  But this one just drags on and on.
I do like the allegory.  Zombies at a mall makes for good satircal social commentary.  But this only goes so far.  Some people will admit that the effects aren't that good.  Well, that is an understatement.  They are pretty bad.  I don't know exactly what their budget was, but I am surprised Tom Savini didn't do a better job.
I don't think I really get Romero.  I have seen many of his critically acclaimed films and I really just don't think they are all that good.  I think he is over-rated, and so is his biggest film.",1082851200,,1096,4.222222222222222
817256,5,6304240554,"Dawn of the Dead is a extraordinarily odd movie, which has very little in common with the earlier film, Night of the Living Dead.  However, simply recreating the oppressive atmosphere and dread of the original would likely have been near impossible and a bit redundant even if he had succeeded, so it's good that he moved it in a new direction.  Fortunately, despite the many differences, NotLD and DotD are similarly excellent.
Although they are very different, the basic plots to the first 2 films of Romero's trilogy are more or less the same: there's a zombie apocalypse, which forces small group of survivors to hideout in and barricade a building in hopes of simply waiting it out.  Now, however, the small farmhouse is replaced with a huge mall, and we are given an even smaller group of 4 survivors.  Overall the acting is pretty good, especially considering the budget it had.  The characters are generally fairly appealing, so long as they are intended to be, and they have a realistic ordinariness to them, much like they did in NotLD.  Despite the emphasis on violence and action through out the film they're some fairly powerful scenes just between the main characters.  There's a great scene of them hanging out in their nicely furnished apartment, listening to some sad Spanish/classical sounding guitar while they kill time by gambling with their worthless money.  It gives a great sense of desolation.  There's also an even somewhat touching scene involving the one character visiting someone's grave.(In fact, I think pretty much all the scenes involving that characters death are very effective, though I won't go into that so as not to give too much away.)  It's effective, as are pretty much all the best conventionally dramatic scenes in the film, because it's so simple and un-theatrical.
In my review of NotLD I urged new viewers to discard their expectations form modern horror films.  This is perhaps even more necessary for Dawn of the Dead.  Frankly, it mainly classifies as a horror film out of convenience, as it blends and shifts from horror to action to adventure to satire to straight drama.(It's rather reminiscent of the much newer and equally excellent 28 Days Later in this way.)  As for the classic complaint to all horror films, ""It's not scary."" well, this one isn't even trying to be scary, for the most part. (And if you doubt this assertion, just listen to the commentary.  Romero pretty much says this is the case.) Still, it does have a few remarkably powerful and eerie scenes.  The raid on the projects is genuinely horrific, (if not scary in the conventional sense), particularly the slow extermination of the zombies in the basement.  There are some good scenes in the mall too, particularly when the guys go off to clear it out, and one zombie just stares at Fran through the glass and later, when the mall has been cleared out, but they all still hear the zombies rubbing and scratching against the glass, trying to get in.  These scenes are particularly effective as they come towards the middle, where it becomes more action/adventure/satire oriented, so they provide good contrast.
Much is made of the violence in this film,(done by gore legend Tom Savini) and not without good reason.  Despite the fact that it was released about 25 years ago, the sheer volume of gore shown in this film outdoes anything I've seen released by a major studio up to this day.(Kill Bill Vol. 1 is the only one that comes close that I've seen) Admittedly most of it is fairly dated, largely because of the blood (which is too orange and the texture doesn't seem right) but it still has a pretty strong impact a lot of the time.  There are something like 70 graphically portrayed gunshot wounds in the film along with plenty of melee violence and the requisite cannibalism.  The scenes of flesh eating are always pretty gross, particularly the zombie-man taking chunks out of his still living wife and the montage of mutilation and gut-eating towards the end.  It's also got a very nice and very sudden shotgun-induced head explosion. (If you really want gore, though, you need to check out the sequel, Day of the Dead. Actually, you should check that out either way)
Obviously, if you are disturbed or offended by graphic violence you oughta pass this up, though you probably already knew that.
Much is made of the satire in humor in this film, and while it is pretty effective, it isn't the emphasis of the film the some people would like to pretend it is.  That is to say, the film isn't simply a vehicle for Romero's thoughts on modern society and consumerism and whatnot.  That element certainly is there, but as a whole he mostly wanted to make an enjoyable film. (Once again, if you doubt this listen to Romero in the commentary.) Still, the satire is very important in that it provides a great contrast to the other elements of the picture.  This matters because these bizarre tone changes are one of the main things that make the film so good.
There seem to be some conflicting opinions about the conclusion where the film kinda tears apart, with an invasion of weird bikers and particularly graphic violence mixed with some odd physical comedy.  Personally, I think it works, and the humor and violence aren't just mixed randomly; it starts out more weird and lighthearted and steadily becomes more dark and gruesome.
This is a pretty bare-bones DVD, but it looks and sounds excellent.  Apparently there's gonna be a special addition later this year with a different cut (which is NOT a directors cut, by the way, just an earlier, formative one.) as well, and it'll presumably have more extra features.  So if you care about that sort of stuff you oughta hold off til then.(I think it's coming out in October.)  If you haven't seen it, check this version out.",1082764800,,5803,4.781781781781782
817257,2,6304240554,"This is an absolute CLASSIC of the genre. What is it about zombies and the End of the World that fires the human imagination so? Is it the desire to strip modern life of all the detritus that encumbers it? (Phone bills, parking tickets, dead-end jobs, spam e-mail, etc. etc.) Or is it just the testosterone-fueled desire to blast away at anything that moves without consequences?
  Unfortunately, while the film is great, this DVD version is seriously lacking. Odd omissions show it to be a rush job. Example: There are no subtitles. How are deaf people to enjoy the cannibalistic orgy of flesh-eating fun without subtitles? More heinous example: I COULD NOT find a copy of the disk that was not defective! I tried five copies. NONE would play without major skipping and data errors. (It's not my player either. I have a top-of-the-line machine and over 100 other disks that play perfectly.

The only difference is its taking place in the U.S. (take note of the various cameos of some of the original cast members)So in my humble opinion, the original is by far worth your money. The premise: A traffic Reporter along with his girlfriend and two cops fly a helicopter out of Philly and land on a zombie infested suburban Pittsburgh mall. They clear it out and live it up a while (who wouldnt) living out every Americans fantasy. Then some bikers come and crash the party and they have to defend their claim. A classic examination of Americas' love of out of control consumerism, at the same time taking note of how savage mankind can be in a time of peril (the apartment raid in the beginning is a prime example. Basic human rights and dignity is non-existent, primarily to the government and law enforcement)This film also captures the horror and mass confusion of the situation and effectively conveys this throughout the beginning of the film. Although the zombies are kind of a second rate nuisance more or less (slow, bumbling etc.) they are still a force to be reckond with. decent acting all around, a must see Romero film that still holds up to this day.",1081987200,2,1300,4.632034632034632
817259,5,6304240554,"Ok forget about my lame choice of topics for a moment, this movie is absolutely amazing. I waited with writing my review up until the point when I was able to see the new Dawn of the Dead playing in theaters right now, even though the new remake was good, it doesn't even begin to stack up with the original. Sure the new version has all sorts of flashy new effects and sure it'll scare you from time to time but nothing even comes close to the terror that this DVD will instill upon you. If the thought of being utterly alone in the world, and having a bunch of zombies wanting to come eat you isn't terrifying to you I don't know what would scare you. George A. Romero does an amazing job with this story, you actually feel for the characters after the first half hour, something I felt was lacking in the remake. If you liked 28 Days later, Day of the Dead or even Night of the Living Dead then this is one movie that should not be excluded from your DVD collection. The DVD itself does not have as much special features as you would like (or maybe I am just spoiled) but the commentary added by director George A. Romero and Special Effects Creator Tom Savini is insightful and downright amusing at time, these men were true pioneers. Both the sound and video are very good, especially considering how old the movie is. The special features are good but like I said before nothing really to get too excited about. I heard that there was plan to release a three-disc DVD set for this movie but until that is a reality I can safely say that this is the best version of the movie you can get. Gore, frights, occasional humor, this is truly one of the best zombie movies you can get anywhere, I can safely recommend it to anyone.",1081814400,,1729,4.290519877675841

The actors were good too.  One seen with a bunch of little kids grabbing on to the cop dude was funny as hell!  Gearg A. Romero is a great film director and I absolutly want him to make DEAD RECKINING.  THIS MOVIE RULES

Effects and gore are awesome but dated.  They were top notch when the film was released but will be laughable to younger viewers.
Acting is good.  Not great but good.  A little over the top at times and a little too mellow at other times.
The setting is awesome.  Nearly all of the movie was shot inside of an actual shopping mall in the late 1970's.  For some of us, it takes us back to the way things looked and felt like back then, and for the youngsters who are into the retro craze, they will get a kick out of it.
The music is awesome.  It's funny, it's moody, it's eerie and it conveys a sense of dread.
The writing, directing and editing are all top notch but whar else would one expect form a Romero flick?
If you like The Omega Man or The Evil Dead series, you will love this movie.  It's gory, suspenseful and it's funny!  Go get it.",1081382400,,1121,4.196261682242991

This new Divimax edition is a wonder to behold with superb DTS sound and amazing picture quality(it looks and sounds much better than when I saw it at the theater when it first hit the big screen). It's now presented in Romeros' preferred running time of 127 minutes. I have the now out of print 137 minute Original Director's Edition which has footage that adds nothing to the story(even though it's great as well), but I much prefer this new edition. Still one of the greatest horror films ever made, this one should not be missed. One final note: for those of you who think this film has another ending, it doesn't.

The movie is very slow paced there is no real tension of the zombies because they are so slow you can out run them. And the acting is really bad is it intentional or not?  The movie just dragged, later on they introduce the biker gang and it felt almost comical to see these guys attack the zombies. The zombies are not at all scary when you can slap them and throw pies in their faces the zombies are patethic monsters the gore is pretty good with a few scenes that stand out but nothing i haven't seen done better elsewhere. I saw the new remake of this flick and i prefer it 100 times better over this flaming turd of a movie if slumbering dead people terrify you go ahead look at it i prefer my zombies running at me! This movie looks like it was made by film students with a decent budget.  Bottom line this movie is good if your a fan of Romero's work, and if you want to see where todays zombie movie get their inspiration from. but nothing more. Critics give him to much credit for this movie, zombies as consumers, oh ok i get it...lame.  Tom savini did some great gore effects but the make up effects on this were lame. I'm going to sell my copy of this movie and wait for a really good nail biter... the dawn of the dead remake.

817336,4,6304240554,"It doesn't bother me that this 1 disk edition will soon be replaced by a 3 DVD collector's set. It's good marketing, and the wait simply means the box is going to be that much better. Granted, we've been waiting a good long time for Anchor Bay to release their end-all-to-end-all box set, but if we get everything available, it should be worth the wait.
This is the 128 minute US Theatrical cut of the film, featuring what Romero felt was the best runtime, a good ballance between the gore, comedy, and character development, with the 'complete' score by The Goblins. The 139 min. version was rushed together to play at the Cannes Festival in 1978, and as such, is simply an extended rough cut. I'm personally glad that Romero can honestly state he likes a tighter, shorter version of his own film. If only most others could do the same, we wouldn't have to own each of their movies 10 times over - but, so is the game of ""Director's Cuts"". Remember, 'longer' doesn't always mean 'better', though it certainly can.
I'm personally hoping that the 3 DVD set coming in the fall will include Argento's ""Zombi"" cut, the Theatrical cut, and a whole lot of extras (Document of the Dead, maybe? I don't think Synapse has it anymore.), making it work with the single DVD rather than against it, but we'll just have to see.
I don't know what I can say about the film that hasn't been said before; excellent film, funny and action packed, holds it's own against the current dreck like Resident Evil and House of the Dead without even trying. The new Dawn, while not a total thrashing of the original (like, say, the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre), simply isn't half as good. Go with the original. You'll thank me for it if you ever get suckered in to watching the new one after viewing the original.
Anyhow, the DVD itself is great; Stunningly gorgeous 16:9 transfer, suprisingly good DTS audio, a brand new comentary, I think if fans didn't already know the box set was coming, they'd be on their knees thanking Anchor Bay for this marvelous DVD. But, for those of you who don't want to have to buy it twice, wait and see what the box brings. I have a feeling I'll own them both.
Romero's masterpiece deserves no less. Now, if only that new set would contain the 150 min. German composite print...
And, by the way. There is no alternate ending. It was written in the script that everyone dies, but never filmed for various reasons. If you want to see how much Romero's ""Dead"" films often veer off from how they were written, find the original screenplay for 'Day of the Dead'. It's barely recognizable compared to the finished film.
Getting 4 stars, only because we're sure to get a lot more fun when the box set comes out this Fall.",1080518400,2,2721,4.52129817444219

The movie went downhill from there.  Zombies move fast in the remake, and that's just WRONG!!

817339,5,6304240554,"Few filmmakers now how to do a zombie movie and get it right; I hate to think what the zombie movie genre would be without George Romero.  1968's Night of the Living Dead is still the archetype of zombie films, in my opinion, featuring a virtually perfect ending.  1979's follow-up, Dawn of the Dead, is another true classic, featuring scenes so shocking that absolutely no one under 17 could be admitted to theaters to see it.  By today's standards, the film is hardly shocking at all, but Romero's up close and personal look at a nihilistic world simply crawling with the undead is the kind of movie that makes horror lovers stand up and cheer.  The level of violence in this film is delightfully high; sure, it all looks pretty fake now, but in its day Dawn of the Dead helped lay the groundwork for later gorefests full of blood and guts.
I don't, as a general rule, care for zombies or zombie movies.  Zombies are ugly and stupid - they basically just wander around in a clumsy manner, only reacting to the nearness of human life fresh for the taking (and eating).  That's about all they do here, as well, but at least they turn out in huge numbers for this George Romero classic.  We don't know what started the trouble; as the movie opens, the world is already in a heap of a mess.  There are cops and soldiers killing zombies by the dozens, but it's obviously just a few bloods drops in the proverbial bucket.
TV news coverage features experts saying how bad everything is and how we should have taken action sooner, demanding people leave their self-barricaded homes and come together in a dwindling number of central locations.  Roger DeMarco (Scott H. Reiniger) flies his girlfriend Francine (Gaylen Ross) and friend Stephen Andrews (David Emge) out of town in a helicopter - Stephen's sharp-shooting buddy Peter Washington (Ken Foree) also comes along for the ride.  Low on gas and unsure of what they should do, the gang lands on the roof of a large shopping mall and eventually decides to hole up there for a while.  Isolating themselves upstairs, our would-be survivors then begin making forays inside the mall for necessary supplies.  The place is crawling with pasty-faced zombies, so they put together a plan that will, or so they hope, keep additional zombies from gaining access to the site; once that is done, it's just a matter of killing all of the zombies already stumbling around inside.  Of course, as we all know, people are stupid, so this prolonged stay inside the mall faces its share of challenges and dangers.  Along the way, countless numbers of zombies are shot, bludgeoned, and taken out with whatever deadly instruments one happens to find handy.  Never fear, there is some zombie feeding as well, although once again I have to express my disappointment that no brains were ever eaten (zombies are supposed to eat brains - that's my personal zombie philosophy).  One question hovers near the front of your mind throughout this film: how will it end?  The world has basically come to an end, making for some long odds for our heroes' survival.  While the ending is not completely satisfying, I do believe it makes for a right and fitting conclusion to this most extraordinary of horror classics.
Let me speak to the violence portrayed here.  However shocking it was upon the movie's release, it really isn't shocking at all in this day and age; the quantity of violence, though still impresses.  Plenty of zombies fall over the course of these two hours plus, but few of the ""deaths"" are what I would call gory.  In many cases, a zombie takes a shot between the eyes and falls down; in some cases there is blood, especially when zombies get a chance to do a little feeding, but you certainly won't see anybody lying in a pool of blood.  In many cases, a zombie gets taken out with no blood at all - certainly, the amount of gore you would expect from shotgun blasts to the head just doesn't exist here.  The blood, I might also mention, doesn't even look like blood - unless red corpuscles changed to orange corpuscles without anyone telling me.
In the end, it comes down to this: Dawn of the Dead is one of the best zombie films ever made - more than that, it's one of the best horror films ever made.  It cemented George Romero's name in the hallowed shrines of horror; it crossed the Rubicon (or perhaps I should say the river Styx) and dared to give viewers the quantity of senseless violence so many of us crave.  There is also a sociological slant to the movie that many feel compelled to comment on (I personally think it's something of a stretch to classify four desperate, would-be survivors as some type of bourgeoisie enjoying the luxury the shopping mall affords them while the nameless hordes of plebeian zombies mill around aimlessly).  However you want to interpret it, Dawn of the Dead is horror at its very best, up close and in your face.",1080432000,,4891,4.638470451911935
817340,5,6304240554,"Dawn of the Dead is truly a great film.  Granted, it was low budget.  Granted, the techniques for gore and make-up were not as advanced as they are now.  None of that matters--in fact, it almost adds to the feel of the film.  This is one of the most important horror films of all time, and is THE quintessential zombie film.  Though not as widely known as Night of the Living Dead...Dawn delivered what people have come to expect from zombie movies--gore, human survival, creepy atmosphere, and that little blend of comedy.  The chance to own it on DVD again is not something to be missed.  If you don't already own a copy, I'd say get this one...but EVERYONE who is a fan of this movie should get the 2 or 3 disc set that is being planned for September.

817341,5,6304240554,"George A. Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" is legendary, a shocking, thrilling masterpiece of horror that continues to wow us over twenty years later.  The second in Romero's Zombie Trilogy (the first was ""Night of the Living Dead""), the film is set immediately after NOTLD, and involves a group of four strangers who find themselves trapped in a shopping mall full of the living dead.  Romero knows how to make a horror film; his trilogy is arguably the greatest horror series ever made.  ""Dawn of the Dead"" isn't horridly scary - in fact, it's not very scary at all; it is, however, suspenseful, thrilling, exciting, absorbing, immensely entertaining, and - more than once - gross.  It has a very creepy feeling to it, and Romero makes us believe more than anyone else that this could really be happening.  There is also a classic score by Goblin (a.k.a. The Goblins) that helps add to the film's already horrific mood.  All in all, ""Dawn of the Dead"" is quite possibly the greatest horror film ever made, raising the bar to a level still not reached twenty-five years later.

Like most zombie movies there is no real beginning and no real ending. The movie starts off with normal people fighting zombies, and ends with an escape on a helicopter to no where. But the bulk of this film is inside a shopping mall. A motley crew has barricaded themselves in a mall and after killing all the zombies inside, fight against the ones outside. The tractor trailer driving sequence is awesome and a thumbs up to the directing of this difficult set of shots.
The zombies are frightening, and can be a source of black humor that I'm sure was intentional. An good example is the lifeless zombies piling up on the esculator.
For a good time and to get the appreciation for good horror without modern day hocus-pocus effects, Dawn of the Dead cannot be beat. I have not seen the remake yet, but I know I'll walk away from it liking the original better (I usually do).",1080172800,,1113,4.407766990291262
817343,4,6304240554,"The latest edition of George Romero's classic film Dawn of the Dead is a visual treat to the newly intiated, or the long time fan.  The transfer onto dvd for this nearly 30 year horror film is nothing short but incredible.  The resolution is crystal clear, and the sound is excellent.  The creepy soundtrack alone is enough to raise the hair on your arms let alone the grim visage on the screen as the story unfolds before you.
  The story is pretty simple, and Romeros camera work lets it unfold like a long lunch.  From the long pans of the gased up hunter picking off zombies as if they were empty beer cans to the panaramic shots of the deserted suburban shopping mall where the film takes place.  Our four survivors hold up in a pittsbugh shopping mall and slowly make the place their own in stylish late 70's chic.
  The characters while never really going overboard with background quickly become endearing to the viewer, and to this day still represent classic ""Movie Heroes"".  Make-up artist Tom Savini makes a memorable cameo as a biker leading an army of malcontents intent on taking the mall away from our heroes.  Well one thing leads to another and before too long zombies are ripping bodies apart in graphic all to familiar form.  The special effects of the New Dawn don't seem to be as ""In Your Face Like A Hammer"" as the original, and even i was getting a little sqeamish during one particularly horrific scene involving a prone biker, and a pack of very hungry zombies.  The scene still dusturbs me even after all these years.
  The extras are nice but do seem a little sparse for such a cult classic, but its been nearly 30 years.  any ""lost"" footage or Bonus scenes are most likely nearly disintegrated with age.  The price is very nice for such classic, well put together Horror classic.
  I can solidly reccommend this for the not so faint at heart.  After watching this you'll never look at shopping malls the same again.",1079913600,2,1944,4.563583815028902
817394,4,6304240554,"The 1978 ""Dawn of the Dead"" should have been left alone.  If they wanted new audiences to see it, they should have re-released it in theaters instead of re-make it.  The 2004 ""Dawn of the Dead"" just doesn't cut it.  It starts really promising and goes downhill after about thirty minutes into the movie.  First, whether the film wants to be or not, it is a continuation after ""Night"", but doesn't really acknowledge that.  In the opening scenes characters are talking about getting the weekend off from work as if they are completely oblivious to the massive epidemic effecting the entire world.  Basically, it should have started like the original -- right in your face.  But nonetheless its opening scenes are still solid, but not realistic at all in the sense of the situation.  I don't think I'd give a crap if I get the weekend off from work because the harsh reality of the situation is if such an epidemic was actually occuring the enitire world would be aware in a few short hours.  Second, you only get one brief glimpse of a zombie eating a victim during the early scenes when they are in the mall.  That's all you get.  All the other zombie attack scenes are them biting their victims to death.  You might be led to believe that is all the zombies do -- bite you until you die and join them, not eat you.  You have to survive the bite to be one of them and die later from the infection.  Zombies don't care if you join them or not, but they do want to eat you.  Third, in ""Night of the Living Dead"" it was established that the zombies will eat animals.  The scene where the dog carries food across the parking lot unmolested contradicts that.  Fourth, the main character's (I forget her name) husband dies at the beginning of the movie and attacks her immediately.  Later on we see her tending to the wound of a bite victim who dies.  She gets way too close as if she completely forgot what happened to her husband.  The movie tries to cover this flaw by covering it with a scene later on where the charcter is asked if she's sure bite wounds are incurable and if the victim will join the undead.  It's a good try, but still the character just looks stupid getting that close because she should already have that information.  Fifth, the zombies run damn fast.  Zombies don't run -- this isn't one of those stupid ""Return of the Living Dead"" movies, but that one flaw alone cuts it too close.  I realize in a remake they have to change things otherwise there is no point of remaking it.  But what this movie ultimately turns out to be is a re-make of the recent ""28 Days Later"".  That's really all it is.  This movie shouldn't have even been billed as a ""Dawn"" remake.  All they'd have to do is lose the shopping mall, don't barricade themselves in a farm house, and don't hide underground and volia! there you have it, a much better ""28 Days Later"" and that is all I can give this movie credit for -- a better ""28 Days Later"".  So the remake gets ** while the recent ""Dawn of the Dead"" DVD re-release gets ****.

817396,5,6304240554,"Dawn of the Dead (George Romero, 1979)
I can't believe I haven't already written a review of this, given the number of times I've seen it. But I watched it again last night since the remake is coming out soon, so...
Dawn of the Dead begins an unspecified time after the closing of Night of the Living Dead. The zombies have reached at least as far east as Philadelphia, where two workers at a TV station decide to steal the weather chopper and head for Canada. They're taking a friend along with them, who brings another guy. The four of them are the core of the movie, aborting the Canada idea when they run out of fuel, stopping on the outskirts of Pittsburgh to take up residence in a shopping mall.
There are simply not enough good things to be said about this movie. While it didn't completely redefine the genre the way Night of the Living Dead did, Romero pushed the American envelope (as he is so fond of doing), incorporating giallo-style violence that Americans were completely unfamiliar with at the time while all the while pursuing the same sociopolitical commentary that makes Night of the Living Dead so rewatchable even thirty-five years later. Romero is a master at getting his point across without being too preachy about it; ninety-nine percent of the movie's hundred twenty-eight minutes (in the American version) keeps the commentary below the radar (all save one brief scene that's a little on the heavy-handed side).
For an ultra-low-budget flick, the acting is tremendous. All four main characters do their jobs capably, and they're surrounded with a supporting cast whose lack of acting resumes since is criminal. Special note should be given to Richard France, a member of the Romero ""inner circle"" since There's Always Vanilla, as an overly pragmatic television commentator who's just a joy to watch every time he comes onscreen.
The pacing is excellent, the effects not completely overdone (though, honestly, they did get better in Day of the Dead), the mix of humor and disgust perfect. There is very little to be said wrong about this brilliant movie. Don't expect to be scared, but expect to enjoy yourself tremendously. **** ",1079654400,,2157,4.861413043478261

Dawn of the Dead is nothing short of epic with great, taut performances and Tom Savini's landmark gut ripping gore effects, plus the satirical stab at consumer culture that made the film a hit with critics.  The film still manages to be shocking to this day, and it has aged quite gracefully.  Anchor Bay finally decided to re-release Dawn of the Dead on DVD, and it features a fantastic commentary by Romero, Savini, and crew.  Other than that, the extras are a bit lacking, even though a deluxe edition is supposedly due out later this year.  All in all, if you've ever called yourself a horror fan, than Dawn of the Dead deserves a place in your film library.",1079481600,,1026,4.579234972677596
817399,5,6304240554,"Hard to believe that it's been a quarter of a century since George A. Romero unleased DAWN OF THE DEAD on unsuspecting moviegoers! Even to this day, DAWN OF THE DEAD is one of the scariest horror movies of all time, and in some respects even better than NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD! I just love the way that this film opens, in pure chaos! We are thrown right into the action and never look back; it's all gone to Hell when the dead are walkin' the Earth! Too bad the critics (and some fans) fail to recognize the full force of Romero's satire of consumerism, a trend which sadly continues to this day. The satire isn't as subtle as those critcs would lead you to believe, in fact Romero knocks consumerism and the influence of shopping malls on society front and center; the dehumanization of the four survivors who hide out in the mall by consumerism makes the living dead seem normal by comparison, and that's precisely the point that Romero makes here.
George A. Romero is my favorite horror movie director. His approach to horror in modern society is amazing! Every horror movie he does, particularly NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, THE CRAZIES, MARTIN, DAWN and DAY OF THE DEAD, and CREEPSHOW is a sign of the times disguised as some truly terrifying horror and disarray. Romero also manages to take on authority, and the Military in particular (THE CRAZIES and DAY OF THE DEAD), presenting a paranoid vision that those in positions of power are the real bad guys. That Romero can find and present terrifying stories in even the smallest details of everyday life (see his newest film BRUISER, a take on Kafka) is a testament to Romero's longevity in the horror genre!
But what I found to be most enjoyable about DAWN was the involvement of Dario Argento! After getting into Argento's movies (SUSPIRIA, INFERNO, TWO EVIL EYES, DEEP RED, and TENEBRE), I began to appreciate DAWN more than I did when I first saw it. Argento put up the money for DAWN, served as script consultant, and provided the awesome music he did with his favorite band Goblin. The music is amazing and really drives home the terror of the story! The other thing that I love about DAWN is how shocking Tom Savini's makeup effects are even today, especially towards the end! DAWN OF THE DEAD is one of the reasons why the 1970's was a great decade for horror!
I just had to get this new edition just to see what the Silver Anniversary set coming out this fall will be like. And I'm glad that I did! The new hi-def transfer and widescreen framing is a revelation, light years beyond any other presentation of this movie over the years! The 5.1 surround tracks add new life to Goblin's score and the soundtrack itself! Plus, you have got to hear the commentary by George and his wife Chris, Tom Savini, and DVD producer Perry Martin; it's an enlightening and funny commentary not to be missed! If you're a major fan of DAWN OF THE DEAD or need to understand the movie before you see the remake that's coming shortly, you can't go wrong with this disc, presented in its US Theatrical version. For all DAWN fans, this is the perfect way to see the incredible job Anchor Bay will do with DAWN OF THE DEAD later this year!",1079481600,2,3181,4.524305555555555

817401,4,6304240554,"1978's DAWN OF THE DEAD is the second entry in George Romero's ""DEAD"" trilogy, though it isn't as scary or as groundbreaking as his first, the classic NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968).  Still, for a low-budget sequel, it is an interesting and entertaining film, an unusual mix of action, drama, comedy, and horror that actually functions on two levels: One, it is a stomach-churning study of the depths to which people will sink in order to ensure their survival; and two, it is a dark satire that takes several pokes at Western consumerism.
The plot of DAWN OF THE DEAD builds on the premise of its predecessor.  The world is now becoming overrun with the flesh-eating zombies, and in the United States, martial law has been declared and all survivors are required to go to state-run ""rescue stations"" for shelter and protection.  The manager of a TV station and her helicopter-pilot boyfriend decide to defy authorities and seek out their own save haven, and two police officers--friends of the helicopter pilot--decide to abandon their duties and go along with the couple.  The group eventually arrives at an abandoned shopping mall, and when they realize that the stores within contain all they need to survive--food, clothing, and weapons & ammunition--they seal off the building, dispose of most of the zombies inside, and take up residence.  But when their claim on the mall and its goods is challenged by a band of motorcycle-riding marauders, the quartet is soon fighting for survival against not only the zombies, but also against their own kind.
Although the audience has been made to sympathize with the film's four protagonists, there is no true heroism in this world of Romero's making.  Instead, there are only different levels of self-interest and narcissism.  After the four move into their new home and start living off the ""fat of the mall,"" they quickly develop a sort of bourgeois attitude towards the comforts they now enjoy.  Of course, that is exactly the Western attitude that Romero is ridiculing--that sense of security and satisfaction one feels after amassing material goods.  And when the group's right to possession is violently challenged by outsiders, Romero clearly demonstrates just how tenuous a security based on personal possessions really is.
Romero is a master storyteller who knows how to manipulate the emotions of his audience.  In this film, he creates a relentless sense of unease by juxtaposing the repulsive and grotesque with the lighthearted and humorous.  For example, when the quartet of protagonists first occupies the mall, they turn on the mall-wide Muzak system to mask from the zombies the noises they make while looting the stores.  So for several scenes there is this macabre contrast between bloody, pasty-faced zombies and syrupy instrumental music.  Uncomfortably comical and humorously disturbing.
Creepy, bloody (FX by Tom Savini), boisterous, and constantly full of surprises, DAWN OF THE DEAD is easily one of the most entertaining zombie movies ever made.  True, it does have an underlying anti-materialism message that is none too subtle, but that doesn't detract in the least from the enjoyment of being playfully spooked and repulsed by all the zombie grotesquerie.  All in all, horror fans will have a good time watching this minor Romero masterpiece.
The Divimax Edition DVD from Anchor Bay offers an excellent digital transfer of the U.S. theatrical cut (often considered superior even to the director's cut), and there are lots of cool extras, too, not the least of which is a feature commentary with writer/director Romero and FX man Savini.  A worthy addition to the film collections of serious horror fans, and well worth amazon.com's very reasonable asking price.",1079308800,3,3739,5.125
817402,3,6304240554,"From National Film Critics to us humble Amazon posters, this movie is treated like the ""Citizen Kane"" of horror films.  It isn't, though it is pretty good.  The not so subtle message of all Americans in our consumer society being zombies is hammered home ad nauseum at the expense of suspense.  Romero's decision to eject most of the terrific score by Dario Argento regulars ""Goblin"" and subsitute bland public doman ""muzak"" is no help either.  Pluses for this film are solid acting, good make-up and a sense of humor.  Minuses, in addition to those previously mentioned, are slack pacing and awkward diologue.
NOTE: This film was re-edited by Argento (one of the producers of Dawn) under the title ""Zombies"" (not to be Lucio Fulci's ""Zombie"").  That version also has most of the Goblin score cut out of this version and, happily, is also available on DVD.  Though missing Romero's humor, this version is the preferable one to get and rates four stars in my book>",1079308800,,963,4.8

  As for the commentary I greatly enjoyed it,finding it insightful, funny, and somewhat educational. Romero despite his successes still made this film using guerrilla moviemaking tactics. The other extras, mostly trailers,t.v. spots, and something you don't always see..radiospots are all well reproduced. If you don't have a copy of this film then I highly recommend this cut,if you have one you may want to hold out until the ""alleged"" rerelease of a heavier loaded edition this Oct.",1079308800,2,777,4.834586466165414
817477,5,6304240554,"Written and directed by horror master George A. Romero, Dawn of the Dead was the nightmarish follow up to the hugely successful, low budget 1968 film, Night of the Living Dead, a film that forever changed the horror genre and influenced many posing the possibility in realistic fashion that few had seen before of the dead rising from the grave and feeding on the flesh of the living.
Dawn of the Dead Picks up sometime after Night of the Living Dead, and we see a television studio in pandemonium as the zombie plague spreads and various commentators argue about a course of action.  It's here we meet two of the main characters of the film, who are romantically involved, in Francine Parker (Gaylen Ross) and Peter Washington (Ken Foree).  Francine works in the studio, and Peter is a helicopter pilot.  Peter speaks of a plan to leave the city and fly to Canada using the helicopter.  We then cut to a SWAT team getting ready to enter a tenement where it is thought local residents are harboring a group of family members who are now of the undead variety, unable to let go of hope that they may be helped in some way.  Here we get our first look at the zombies and some particularly violent and brutal scenes involving the munching of flesh and the popping of heads with various small arms weapons.  One of the SWAT members, Stephan Andrews (David Emge) is in on the plan to leave the city in the helicopter, and confides this information to another member, Roger DeMarco (Scott H. Reiniger) who both soon departs to meet with Peter and Francine.
Flying in the helicopter, they come across a shopping mall, land with the hopes of getting supplies, and find that this might not be a bad place to hole up for awhile.  They begin to clear the mall of the undead, and fortify their position by blocking the entrances into the building, keeping the zombies at bay.  Things seem to be going pretty well until a roving gang of bikers/mercenaries crash the party, allowing for the zombies to re-enter the building.  This sets up some pretty funny scenes with the bikers racing around stealing now useless articles and beating up on zombies.
A few things set this movie apart from the original Night of the Living Dead (1968).  Obviously this film being color is a huge difference, allowing us to see the visceral gore in all its Technicolor brilliance whereas the original was in stark black and white.  Another point is the inclusion of comedy.  Some of it ironic, some subtle, and some being slapsticky (a pie fight with zombies?  Yep, it's here).  The elements I appreciated most were seeing the zombies walking around the pinnacle of western consumerism, the shopping mall, and hearing the pre-recorded announcements playing (""For each five dollar purchase, customers will receive a complimentary one pound bag of hard candy"")  A final point I found different from the original was the scale of that film compared to Dawn of the Dead.  Night of the Living Dead was a much smaller production, relying on a small number of settings to tell that highly effective tale.  Here we are treated to a number of large sets, and most of the film takes place within a shopping mall with a cast of hundreds, many being zombies.  This really served well in displaying the extent of the problem, in that it seemed no matter how many zombies you dispatched, there were always more to take their place.
It's interesting to see how well the more violent scenes hold up in this movie, eliciting revulsion from this viewer, despite a number of previous viewings.  I'll never get used to seeing a zombie take a chunk out of someone's neck, blood spurting, flesh tearing...I'm serious, if you have a weak stomach, this film should be avoided.  The realistic portrayal of the violence is not toned down one bit, but certainly doesn't go as far as some of the European horror/splatter films of the late 70's/early 80's.  Tom Savini really set a standard here with his mastery of special effects.
I really appreciate Anchor Bay for re-releasing this original theatrical version on DVD again.  Their first release sold out quickly and now commands a much higher price from third party sellers than I was willing to pay.  Along with a beautiful print of the film, we get a commentary by Romero and effects master Savini, trailers, TV spots, promotional materials, a preview of the comic book, and exhaustive liner notes.  This film is followed up by Day of the Dead (1985), also written and directed by Romero.  I had heard Romero was working on a fourth film, tentatively titled Dead Reckoning, but given his sporadic output and his seemingly continual difficulties with financing and creative control, I would be surprised if that project ever saw the light of day.  One can always dream...

817478,5,6304240554,"The re-make ambles into theatres and this disc gets released amid swirls of rumors later in March (?) a DVD DIRECTOR'S CUT will be released as well.  This is the US Theatrical Cut - coming in at 127 minutes.  It features a new DTS soundtrack, anamorphic treatment, and a new commentary from Romero and Savini (with some other guests).  It's low priced, and certainly the best the film has ever looked!  The commentary is great, but there is little else in the special features.  Mainly you get previews, posters, trailers, and radio spots.  But it's worth every penny!  And in a way it is the true director's cut.
The edit with 20 minutes added was a rushed job Romero did to preview the film in CANNES.  When he and Dario Argento revisited the movie they decided it needed to be tighter (less talk more ACTION), and two cuts emerged.  One was Romero's US VERSION which hit theatres and remains his true director's cut; meanwhile, you also have a 6 minute shorter slightly more gory less humor Dario Argento ITALIAN CUT.  To muddy waters even more ... when CREEPSHOW was released an R-rated studio cut appeared at drive-ins as part of a double bill!  So there are many cuts out there.
But what makes the film survive and even get remade?  Pure and simple it's a monster movie where humans are the ultimate monsters.  And it's not always the zombies that do the awful stuff -- infact, it's surprising how human they appear in contrast to the inhumane looters that appear in the climax.  Shopper zombies trapped in a mall?  That's the obvious satire.  But the film has so many layers!  Racism, sexism, consumerism, religion, the media, the government, scientific thought -- it all gets eaten alive here.  Sure it's dated and slower than most horror movies these days.  The remake will speed up the zombies ala 28 DAYS LATER!  But this one remains what it is -- an intelligent masterful excercise in horror.  ""A movie that not only goes for the jugular, but rips it out and eats it for good measure!""",1079308800,,1997,4.6164772727272725

I've always been a big fan of 'Day of the Dead' and 'Night Of the Living Dead, not to mention the trilogy of 'Return of the Living Dead', but this film is pretty wonderful. I love how it's in the shopping mall and the whole story with the characters and the Zombie effects. I can't describe in words how cool this film is, you'll just have to see it for yourself.

Now I've read a few reviews going on (negatively) about how  this is the theatrical version of the film and that the Director's Cut is better.  Well, it's only better if you like a bunch of excess, and to me, really boring dialog.  When I brought the video tape of it (the Director's Cut), I was expecting to see an extra 20 minutes of gore, but except for just one cool scene, it was all dialog.  Dialog, that in my opinion, that didn't add a thing to it.  In fact, this twenty minutes reminds of the outtakes from Jaws.  I was glad they were taken out.
George Romero has said that the Theatrical Cut of the film is his favorite.  And I'm glad it's the one on this DVD.",1079049600,2,867,4.088757396449704

817483,4,6304240554,"It was great timing to re-release the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" before the ""new"" version comes out in theaters.  Before purchasing this DVD, I hadn't seen the original in nearly 20 years.  ""DOTD"" is as disturbing as any horror film ever made.  It mixes black humor in horror in such a way that many other films have attempted to copy with little success.  The acting may be a bit stlited at times, and the storytelling might be a tad rough around the edges, but horror films don't get much more realistic (or brutal) than this.  It also appears (at least from the previews) that the new theatrical version is going to be a far different movie from this one.
The DVD, however, is a bit of disappointment in one repsect.  Other than commentary from Director George Romero, there isn't much in the way of special features.",1078876800,,821,4.551020408163265
817484,4,6304240554,"I awaited this release of this DVD(3-9-04)with much excitement, as I've been an enthusiastic (one might even say 'zombie-like') follower of Romero's 'Dead' trilogy since childhood. And for the most part, it was worth the wait.
The print is beautifully clean, vivid, and the audio remastering to 5.1 surround is something to behold (experiencing this DVD after years of VHS is almost like watching it for the first time). The technical merits of those who put this DVD together cannot be disputed, and the film AND the DVD deliver the goods on almost every level.
The audio commentary (Romero, his wife/assistant dir. Chris Romero, FX man Tom Savini, and Peter Martin) is great fun, mostly informative (with a lot of laughing and reminiscing, which is a treat!)...Like partying with the filmmakers.
But the extras are a bit sparse if you aren't keen on sitting through ten variations of the same ad (for the television and radio spots, it's tough to find differences, other than length). The two theatrical trailers are nice, especially the first U.S. trailer... I remembered seeing this trailer originally, at age 11, and just the TRAILER scared me silly! It's nice to have that on disc.
The jacket of the DVD mentions a 'sneak peek' at the new comic book version of DOTD coming this Fall, but it's only a quick look at the cover of an issue, then you hit 'more' and it gives a short paragraph that is just an advertisement for the comic. So no substance there, it comes off silly to hype such a miniscule 'peek'.
This is not the fullest treatment of the film on DVD, but wait...
Apparently there will be a multi-disc, far more in-depth DVD set of this film coming in September, and THAT will definitely be worth it. But even as sparse as this current version is (not the full director's cut, few extras, etc.) it's a GREAT way to have this classic film in your library until the BIG set comes along. At under $15, for the horror fan and followers of Romero, it won't disappoint much, if at all, and it's a great teaser for the full set to come.",1078876800,4,2045,4.6208791208791204
817485,3,6304240554,"I was eagerly awaiting this DVD, and I finally got to pick it up yesterday (on the release date).  When you watch the movie, you instantly notice the great new transfer (if you've been watching it on video all these years, as I have).  That's about where the fun ends, but at least you get this awesome flick on DVD.
First off, I know this DVD is the ""regular"" one without all the nifty special features.  The ""special"" DVD comes out later this year.  That stated, this is basically a barebones DVD (not counting the commentary), and the extras are the usual TV spots, radio spots, galleries, and so on, but what I was looking forward to was the ""new collector's booklet"" and the ""exclusive preview of the upcoming comic.""  Both were throwaway features offering very little to the 'Dawn of the Dead' fans.
The included booklet has a little sort of ""review"" type thing saying how Dawn was influential, and lists the chapters on the back.  Amazon.com says the book has four pages, but that actually means the front, the back, and the other sides of each.  So it's really one piece of paper, folded in half that's being called four pages.  The ""exclusive preview"" of the new comic is a picture of the cover and the weblink for the publishers where you can find the same information they give you on the DVD, basically.  Disappointing, if you were looking forward to these features.
In the end, was it worth the 15 dollars?  Yes, yes it was.  I've been waiting for this DVD for some time, and while the couple of extras I was most waiting on let me down, I'm not going to complain and claim that the disk is horrible, because it's not horrible.  I finally get to add this classic to my collection for a very reasonable price, and what a great transfer.  Plus, what I call the Super Special Edition of 'Dawn of the Dead' is supposed to be released before Halloween this year.  That will certainly be a time to celebrate for Dawn fans like myself.
If you are a fan (keyword: fan) waiting for the Super Special Edition, you may as well pick this up for the new transfer, if nothing else (besides, it's dirt cheap).  If you could care less about special features, but you like the flick, it would make more sense pick this one up (the Super Special Edition will be much more expensive).  I just have to plug the transfer once more before this review is over.  The transfer is great, I honestly get excited when i see how clear the picture is.  Okay, that's done.

While the movie itself and the extras are fantastic, this may not be the best edition to buy, read on to find out why....
The movie itself needs no introduction to any horror fan, as this is widely considered to be one of the best horror movies ever made, and by far the best zombie picture. I will skip right to the qualities of the DVD itself, to save boredom for anyone who already knows the plot (which I imagine is everybody reading this). The most notable feature on the Divimax DVD is the commentary from George Romero and Tom Savini, with Perry Martin doing the moderating. Similar to the commentary on ""Day of the Dead"", both Savini and Romero are lively and enthusiastic about this movie, which is surprising considering that the movie is more than 25 years old. The anecdotes and back stories will definitely give fans some insight, as well as plenty of trivia knowledge. This is probably the best Romero commentary so far. The only other extras are an extensive photo gallery (with some great shots), and some promotional material that most people have seen already. If the extras seem sparse, there is a reason for that: rumor has it that Anchor Bay is planning a larger, more extensive Special Edition later in 2004. Like the ""Lord of the Rings"" DVDs, the first release might be just a taster.
Before moving onto the less positive aspects, it should be noted that this is perhaps the video transfer released so far. While previous editions were fragmented, grainy, and muddy looking, this one is clear, having scrubbed 25 years worth of wear and tear on the master. This beats all previous editions, hands down.
My gripes with the new ""Dawn of the Dead"" DVD are nothing to do with what was included, but what was not included. This version runs 127 minutes, while as any fan knows, the original prints ran 142 minutes. The previous ""Director's Cut"" released on DVD was 137 minutes long (the only time I have seen the full 142 released was on an import laserdisc), so why couldn't they have included the longer cut here? For fans waiting for a new release, this is a bit of a letdown. Also noticeable is the lack of any documentaries or other supplements beyond the commentary. This is understandable if this release is only a taster, however, so I will be waiting in hopes that the new edition solves this problem.
Overall, horror fans could not ask for a better movie to have on DVD, even if completists like me are unhappy with the shorter cut. The remastering alone makes this worth the price tag alone, while the commentary is a welcome addition to the movie.",1078272000,3,2847,4.584313725490196
817579,5,6304240554,"What can be said that hasn't been already.  This is the continuation of a genre setting, cinematic vision created by George Romero.  The non-voodoo walking dead did not exist (Plan 9 excepted) like this before George Romero made these movies.  Also please remember, these are independent films, Hollywood had no input.  Technically speaking Day of the Dead is better but this one is the fan favorite and rightly so.  Even through the cheesy blue make-up Romero's direction of the Undead extras sells this movie.  Admittedly after years of watching I catch myself chuckling at the ""zombie blue"" but am soon immersed in their believability and wince everytime Roger is hotwiring a vehicle and the undead are lurking around grasping for his flesh.  I always root for Fran, Peter, Roger and even brain dead Steven although I know the outcome.  I feel Peter's pain and conflict in the end and would have accepted either of his solutions, even if Fran would have been worse off if he chose the other.

817652,5,6304240554,"Dawn of the Dead is the best zombie film ever made. I cannot imagine anything else that influenced the zombie genre/cult more than the dead trilogy.
There is something interesting about being trapped and having nowhere to go or not knowing where to go next. That is the essence and horror of George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead. The characters have to deal with what they have left in a world that has become chaotic and very much unpredictable. What they only have left is self-preservation--to seek for safety and refuge away from the walking dead. The characters finally find their refuge in a shopping mall and for a while the shopping mall seemed like a perfect haven until the characters begin to feel that what they have is basically a prison in itself. The shopping mall with all its materials, money, food, and entertainment is ultimately nothing in the end.
The dead walks surrounding the shopping mall: ""They're us...they remember what they use to do"". There is a hidden intelligence in Dawn of the Dead. Romero is commenting on America's consumerism. As consumers, (or zombies, or sheep) we try to fill up the unconscious that hovers us like a cloud--that is boredom and emptiness; therefore, we need to fill up this emptiness and the easiest way is to buy and have materials. The materials are in itself nothing, which is what the characters ultimately find themselves in.
Well enough of my crazy analysis and interpretation. The point is that this film rocks! This is an intelligent horror film that is serious and sometimes funny. The actors are believable and flawless when compared to other horror films. Although Dawn of the Dead is already considered a classic, as decades pass it will definitely receive more consideration and respect.
However, I strongly disapprove of the remake. A Dawn of the Dead remake, which is superfluous, is either made as an appreciation of a classic or for a hollywood cash bomb. I would like to think the former but I know that is not true.",1077753600,,1989,4.784883720930233

817657,5,6304240554,"Zombie movies.  Lots of ""serious"" types look down on them.  That's a shame, because some of them are really first-rate films.  Dawn of the Dead, the middle film of George Romero's ""dead"" trilogy, is a case in point.  You want zombies, we got your zombies RIGHT HERE!  You want blood?  Guts?  Flesh eating?  Oh boy, does Dawn of the Dead ever deliver!
And then it does something really unique - it also delivers drama, engaging characters with realistic delimmas, a smartly crafted story, and a heavy dose of dead-on social satire.  And did I mention that it's just flat-out scary as hell, too?
There is one scene in particular, toward the beginning, that still haunts me - twenty some-odd years after I first saw it.  The National Guard has been called in to clear a tenament building.  In the basement, they find a cage where the dead have been locked away.  The simple, unsettling music of Goblin rises on the soundtrack, underscored by a heartbeat-like bass drum.  There are the zombies, many in death shrouds, feasting on body parts.  Guardsman Peter Washington (Ken Foree) steps into the nightmare with a pistol to dispatch the zombies with bullets to their heads.  The whole thing takes on a surreal, hellish texture, like a Bosch painting.  Foree's performance is striking - he is truly IN THE MOMENT, as they say, without a hint of the winking self-awareness we see in other genre flicks.  If the dead really started coming back to feed on the living, this is exactly what it be like.  This is the toll it would exact on people trying to grapple with the situation.
Yet, in a way, Dawn of the Dead IS self-aware.  It knows when to step back, too, and admit that it's playing with you.  Another scene, of this sort, occurs when we see a group of rednecks hunting the shambling corpses as though they were deer.  They sip coffee from thermoses, pass sandwiches around, and banter about their accuracy with their rifles.  It's a very funny bit, in part because it's so deadpan.
Those are just two favorite examples.  There is much, much more to this film, and almost all of it works beautifully.  Even the sometimes obviously low budget and gleeful use of library stock music doesn't hurt.  Romero turns these limitations to his advantage, by making them serve as searing comments on mass media, consumerism, and pop culture.
Performances by David Emge, Scott Reiniger, and Gaylen Ross are worthy of mention, too.  They play real people in an extraordinary situation, rather than two-dimensional horror-movie characters.
Dawn of the Dead schlock as high art - complex, funny, scary, and engaging.  And thank goodness it's coming back to DVD, because it's one worth watching over and over again.",1076976000,139,2699,4.785714285714286
817658,5,6304240554,"This movie truly terrified me the first time I saw it. Something about the whole concept of the dead returning to life to hunt the living is very frightening. Yes, the movie may be corny considering how small of a budget it had and since it's 25 years old, but the point gets across. It's based around a sort of end of the world phenomenon involving thousands of the dead returning to life and walking the earth. As the world plunges into chaos, four survivors barricade themselves into a shopping mall surrounded by hundreds of the living dead. At first all is good, but things begin to grow wrong which results in a very scary and absolutely grusome finale.

817744,5,6304240554,"An intense and overlooked horror classic, George A. Romero's ""Dawn Of The Dead"", the second and most popular in his Dead trilogy, is probably his most epic tale to date. Regarded by many, including Roger Ebert, as the ultimiate definition in horror films, ""Dawn"" is truly the thinking man's horror movie. Its horror is far more subtle than that of in-your-face suspense films like ""Halloween"" or ""Exorcist"" or for that matter, Romero's first Dead film, ""Night"". Where most slasher films provide those quick thrills that make us jump but dissapear from our memory almost as quickly as they appeared, ""Dawn"" creeps into our fears and shows us a view of our downfall as a civilazation.
""Dawn"" centers around four survivors, two Philadelphia S.W.A.T. members and a couple from a newstation, who are trying to escape a zombie plague that has engulfed the country. The film opens with chaos ensuing as a handful of newscasters attempt unsuccesfully to put together an emergency broadcast. We move forward to a project house where the tenants are protecting the undead because as one of the central characters explains, ""They still believe there is honor in being dead"". Guns blaze as seemingly more humans are taken down than actual zombies courtesy of a SWAT team bigit who goes buckwild but ends up getting his before the smoke clears.
As the violence in the city seems to be piling up, our four characters use the local news chopper to escape to the country side where the situation isn't any less of a problem though a handful of trigger-happy rednecks seem to be having a great time with their beers and shotguns. After a brief touchdown at said location where the group runs into a few problems with both the zombies and each other while gassing up their helicopter, they head back up into the sky and eventually land at a shopping center, the film's cental location.
Placing the story at a mall makes for not only a unique and creative backdrop but also allows for Romero to provide an intriguing social commentary on the madness of consumerism that seemed to sweep the late 70's. The zombies who try to break into the center are portrayed as people who loved shopping there so much in life that all they want to do is be there after death.
Romero and make-up effects wizard, Tom Savini are at the most sadistic during the concluding act of this film as our heroes do battle with another band of survivors, a motorcycle gang who shows up and tries to take over the mall for themselves. The zombies, who prior to this were pretty much an afterthought regain their power because their human counterparts are far too busy with each other to notice that they are regaining control of the place. Savini's graphic make-up effects really make for a great finale.
""Dawn Of The Dead"" is very much a different film from ""Night Of The Living Dead"". ""Dawn"" takes a far different approach to the ""dead taking over the world"" concept that George helped create in ""Night"". The mall setting is far less clostrophobic than the farmhouse in the original but it is the nightmare outside that our characters must deal with. In ""Night"", it was all about getting past the problem that lie in front of them and it's smooth sailing. In ""Dawn"", the problem is almost reversed. They are safe inside their location, though their safety is an illusion, and it is the outside world that is coming in. They don't want to get away. The outside world is falling apart and the mall is almost a false symbol of protection.
""Dawn"" probably will not be an instant overnight favorite. I, myself, was expecting a much different movie than the one I watched. Having caughts bits and pieces of ""Day"" before I actually sat down to watch it, I was expecting it to have more of the look and feel that I associated with that movie. I honestly didn't know what to make of the weird clothing, the Smurf-blue make-up effects, and the strange Goblins music that popped up through out the film. Within two weeks of watching it, it had become one of my favorite films. All these weird visuals that I found strange actually kept dragging me in over and over again. Though the film is over 25 years old, I can still honestly say that there are very few films of any genre that resemble it.",1073088000,4,4238,4.65954606141522
817745,5,6304240554,"Trying to put my finger on exactly what it is I like so much about a vision of a ruined world where your only sanction comes from hording the remains of a consumer America that i find so damn appealing is extremely difficult. Is it my general distaste of humans that drives me into a frantic fantasy of being the only one left? Do i long for adventure on such a grand scale that it would end in me fighting off my own friends and family, undead, blue and bloated? Or do I secretly just fear going to the mall unless it involves killing hordes of zombies (the romero type, not the ones at the GAP)?
One thing is for damn sure: Romero is the luckiest guy in the world. To sculpt a film that embodies everyone of our deepest darkest fears or fantasies, and he does it in such a way that has kept us from losing touch with this gem since the 70's.
Something that has kept us coming back i think is the idea that Romero, like many of you reading this, wasn't really known to the studios with the money. He just knew a lot of people with money not intended for young independent horror movies. Those people took a million and a half dollar risk on Romero, and from what I hear most of the investors were people who'd known Romero since the Night of the living dead days. They didn't know what was brewing in his head, but they knew it would probably work. Seeing this thing get made must have been the happiest accomplishment in his career.
So why do we, the avid horror buffs, keep coming back to this campy genre flick with shuffling smurf-like white guys with afros? Well, as a technical accomplishments go, this one succeeds with very little to work from. Getting the kind of shots that Romero wanted on the budget he had must have seemed like quite the joke to the cast and crew, so he had an awful lot of things to consider. For starters, if he was going to succeed in making us believe the whole world came to an end, he was going to have to think of clever ways to accomplish this, unlike a certain remake which just went the full nine and really destroyed a big section of Toronto. Romero garnered together as many people around his beloved Pennsylvania, and he managed to get as many as possible into the movie. The morale of the lesson is make many friends and your movie will get made with their help.
So i guess in conclusion, I should tell the uninitiated why they should get up right now and go get a copy of this. For one, the acting is excellent, probably the best of any of Romero's movies. The cast was very green and had a lot to portray given the supposed situation, and they handle it very well. Most of the extras (Zombies) look very nice, but a few will make you wonder what  was going on in the seventies that got some people so much screen time (I think it was massive quantites of drugs, personally, but not on Romero's part) like that stupid bald tamborine zombie, some sort of irony in a peace-lover-by-life and a flesheater-by-death kinda thing. Oh, and there is a few white guys with afro's which will make you giggle, and bellbottoms abound, but if you look past that, this is a rather timeless movie.
The effects are excellent for there time, and still hold up to todays gore standards quite well. Savini himself admits now that the blood recipe he used was a few shades off, coming off more as red tempre paint than blood, but aside from that, it all looks pretty convincing.
I wouldn't recommend buying any of the DVD's floating around at really outragous prices anymore now that a DIVIMAX version by Anchor Bay is out around March or april of 2004, with a super-deluxe version (between 3-5 discs worth, if you can believe that) so don't blow $40 for an oldie here, just wait.
I strongly recomend the other films in the Living Dead series, Night of the living dead and Day of the dead. Day is a bit talky, but has great zombies, probably the best, and Night has all the same perks as Dawn but much more gritty. Go check 'em out.",1072656000,2,3957,4.33288409703504
817746,5,6304240554,"I seem unable to leave this one alone; this will be my third review for ""Dawn of the Dead."" As people who have read my reviews probably know, I used to despise this film. I rented it on the strength of a Roger Ebert review that pointed it out to be one of the most apocalyptic yet satirically relevant horror films ever made. I expected something more along the lines of Paul Anderson's ""Resident Evil,"" I think. Pure action horror from beginning to end. What I got was something I initially didn't understand as a sophomore in high school. The horror was remarkably subdued, and not really as a result of the zombies themselves, but more from what they symbolize. Of course, I didn't know that at the time.
This was best summed up 11 years after completion of ""Dawn,"" when George Romero, director of this film, rewrote his original masterpiece, ""Night of the Living Dead."" Under the direction of makeup effects artist Tom Savini, Romero added a nice little line of dialogue that reverts back to all his previous work: ""They're us. We're them, and they're us."" Thus lies the truly psychological horror of ""Dawn of the Dead."" This film is not terrifying, but what it implies is. Who are the real monsters? The zombies? Grey people ambling about in search of food? They are acting on instinct, all traces of civility erased. In essence, they are blameless. Toward the end of ""Dawn of the Dead,"" we get a glimpse of a band of surviving bikers who loot the shopping mall in a sloppy heist. These people still have minds of their own and act on much more than instinct. As they make sport of killing the zombies in a variety of wholesale ways, all the while stopping to indulge their curiosity with the blood pressure monitor at Penney's, the (other) bloodthirsty humans turn on each other. And for what? To save money on jewelry? I doubt the cashier cares. He's the one behind the bushes in the food court with his throat torn open. No, not him, the other guy with the funny hat. There you go.
Now, I suppose here is where I had my initial trouble with the film back in 1998 when I first watched it. As all this chaos ensues on screen (humans versus human, human versus former human), there's a jubilation to the tone. Only when a swarm of zombies encroaches on a biker or an elevator door unleashes a half dozen of the ghouls does the music stop and the tone become one of complete terror. I didn't know what to make of this conflict of emotions then. Five years later, older and wiser, I understand it now. I see the satire in every bit of film and not just the two seconds of frame that show a zombie clobbering down the up escalator. This entire film was meant to be fun. The idea behind George Romero's ""Living Dead"" series is that human beings are screwy. Throughout his trilogy, we were given all three tones of this: Paranoia (""Night""), dark comedy (""Dawn""), and psychological thriller (""Day""). ""Dawn"" remains the fan favorite to this day. The other ""recluses"", as Romero calls us, prefer ""Day of the Dead"" (don't be fooled; it's his favorite of the three).
Anyway, I wrote yet another review for ""Dawn"" for the reason of personal rebuttal. I claimed in my last review that, although I was beginning to like ""Dawn of the Dead,"" I doubted I would ever include it on a list of my favorite films. Well, I was wrong. ""Dawn"" is one of my favorite films, and although it does not succeed on the horrific nor technological level that ""Day of the Dead"" does, it is still a masterpiece in a class of its own, and for the sake of James Gunn (writer of the Zach Snyder-directed remake coming in March 2004... and, oh yeah, ""Scooby-Doo"") I hope he keeps in mind that you can't recapture greatness, you can only try and re-envision it.
This goes for you, too, Michael Bay, and your stupid idea of remaking John Carpenter's ""Halloween."" Do me a personal favor: Pull your lip over your head and swallow. Regurgitate. Repeat. Thanks.",1070668800,9,3921,4.531734837799718

This is not only an extremely bad horror flick, it's just an incredibly, excrutiatingly horrible movie!  I'm not sure how this can even be classified as a horror when it doesn't even come close to raising a single hair on my head.  The directing was ludicrous and the acting was just gawd awful (even for a horror flick)!  Acting and directing that poorly should really be a crime.  And as for the script...hmm... I don't think they wrote one but rather just improvised because it has to take some sorta effort and thinking to write up a script doesn't it??
About the movie:
Four of the stupidest characters are having the time of their lives in a shopping mall full of zombies.  Sounds scary?  Not at all.  These characters end up going on a shopping spree and when they are surrounded by a dozen or so zombies, they simply push the zombies aside.!*&%??  If they get too annoyed by the zombies then they would just punch the lights out of the zombies and continue on.  This is pretty much the entire movie.  And as ineffective as these zombies seem to be at killing, 2 main characters were actually dumb enough to allow themselves to get bitten by the zombies.  And there's one ridiculous part where a biker gang enters the mall and starts a shoot-out with the main characters.
ABSOLUTELY P-R-E-P-O-S-T-E-R-O-U-S!
Hilight of the film? :

Yes there were alot of gore, but if being grossed out is all you're looking forward to, then maybe there's a slim chance you might actually enjoy this movie.  However, the gory parts appeared very fake and unrealistic.  The zombies LITERALLY looked just like normal human beings except for the paleness.  I don't see how a person who's been painted lightly blue can look scary. lol
This film bears no logic or intellgence.  It was so bad that I wouldn't even consider it to be a movie.  It's simply a complete INSULT and DISGRACE to the film industry and to sanitary human beings.
I would prefer not to give this movie a star but that was the minimum rating I could give it.  In fact even 0 stars would be a huge compliment to this movie and an over-rating.  This movie (or so called movie) really deserves -4 stars......... actually, I give it -5 stars for being so damn long!

But in its own way, it is just as comically satiric as the first film in its take on contemporary values. This time, we follow the fortunes of four people who lock themselves inside a shopping mall to get away from the marauding dead and who then immerse themselves in unabashed consumerism, taking what they want from an array of clothing and jewelry shops, making gourmet meals, etc. It's great.

Picking up a little bit after Night of the Living Dead left off, the dead are rising and crave living human flesh for food. Two SWAT team officers and two TV station employees steal a traffic helicopter and flee the carnage, eventually taking refuge in a massive mall which is filled to the brim with zombies yet offers great potential as a shelter.
Although ultimately a horror film, Dawn serves equally well as an action piece. The survivors don't only fight the zombies but other survivors, making for some explosively gory shootouts. The film conveys a good message about consumerism too; as the zombies mindlessly drone about the mall that they remember from their past lives, it's almost the same as watching living people.
It may be a tad bit dated, but Dawn of the Dead holds up as a great horror and action movie, and even as a satire on human nature and consumerism.

Dawn of the Dead starts without a beginning, there is no introduction to the setting, the story, or the characters. It is so confusing that I had to go back to see if I missed a chapter.

I began watch more of the Romero's films, all of his ""Dead"" films, and branched out to the Rubinstein spin-offs, ""Return of the Living Dead."" I'm not obsessed with the zombie movies, but since I was 12 years old I was trapped at a drive-in with my brother for a dusk to dawn movie run for Halloween where among other films, director Lucio Fulci's ""Zombie"" was playing, it changed the way I slept at night forever.
With Romero at the helm, the zombie's are characters rather than background and the stories are strong. When I found this version of the DVD (I have the 2 disc set) I jumped to purchase it. Unfortunately since I live in the U.S. I didn't have a DVD player that ran Region 2 movies. Once I upgraded my DVD player I wasn't disappointed by the movie. I have both versions of the film on the 2-disc set and the director's cut is by far the best film in the ""Dead"" series.

At times it is hillarious, other times quite frightening, but most of the time it is just good fun. Dawn is kind of dated, but its dated in that way where you can just laugh at that embarassing 70s quasi hip that makes most of us cringe when looking photos of ourselves in that era. The performances are great, even when dealing with some extremely bad dialog (which actually adds to the film overall in a weird sort of way).
The story is simple but inspired; locating most of the action in a mall allows the film to be simultaneously apocalyptic and utopian.
The music is also great, beginning with the opening credits scene. The opening scene brilliantly establishes the mood of the film from the get go, without being obvious or giving away too much. Its refreshing that this film doesn't try to explain things, it just goes with the flow.
The Makeup is at times incredible, but its not over done.

The filmmakers don't let you know right away what's happening but let's you know that thing's are going south. Fran argue's over rescue stations and the studio tries ,in vain, to conduct an interview. It becomes apparent that compleat caos has begun.

817936,5,6304240554,"Dawn of the Dead, the second fragment of the Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead trilogy, offers up a glimpse of the flesh-devouring world of the walking dead through the eyes of not one, but two of horrors premiere architects. Here, the meshing of Romero/Argento mindset commences, birthing something that taps both the veins of humor and horror in the same breath. Although it isn't a harbinger of horror that the third installment is, there are some mutilations toward the end that are commendable, plus a few bites here and there and a drove of headshots that keep the stage smeared with blood.
To Note: Depending on which version of the movie you obtain, you either have a more purely based horror movie on your hands with music befitting that theme (U.S. theatrical version), or you have a more complete picture with thirteen minutes of additional footage and an odd variety of quickly cut music that, for some reason, appeals to heavily to me (Director's Cut). This is all a matter of opinion, however, because Dawn of the Dead is unlike many movies that come with a director's cut edition. Both are lovely in their own rights and both are different creations, so you might want to judge this for yourself.
The movie begins shortly after Night of the Living Dead, with the land of opportunity running thick with speculation as to what is motivating sudden rash of ""cannibal killings."" People debate the rhymes, reasons, and even the perpetrators of these ghastly events as the names of outdated rescue station blaze across the airwaves, sending people to their prospective dooms in the name of ratings. All the while people are huddled together in apartment buildings for their protection, forced from private residences because of their vulnerability, and teams of both army and localized militia hunt the horrors that seem intent on stalking the living.
  Amidst this chaos, some find themselves both fearful of the order being installed and the way the hammer of justice pounds away freely. Accordingly, they decide to become criminals themselves and flee, thinking they can find their own way in this chaotically shifting world. Enter our four main characters, two armed with some impressive small arms and skilled in the use of deadly force, one that's able to fly a helicopter he's commandeered from the local news station but is lacking in the way of the gun, and a seemingly predictable female that isn't as helpless as the movie first makes her out to be.
Their plan: to take the helicopter, land it outside the outstretched hands of law enforcement wherever there happens to be gas, to keep to the skies, and fly to Canada.
Their problems: they only have one pilot, little in the way of refueling stations, no real plan of action, a world full of zombie and human enemies, and no place to rest their weary heads.
Their salvation: A shopping mall of epic proportions, complete with a helipad and a fully stocked cupboard of guns, ammunition, food, and anything else the consumer bent on escapism desires.
The Complication: The mall is awash with the walking dead, all drawn here for some unknown reason that calls them back from beyond, with more waiting outside to fill its two-story coffers whenever something tasty becomes available.
Besides being a piece rich with characterization and understandable dilemmas, Dawn of the Dead also takes many a satirical poke at the valleys of consumerism and the mindsets of acquisition. By showing you the length to which some people would go to hold onto the shiny baubles they've hoarded and the effect it has even on the shambling Hare Krishna, I feel it effectively takes a few jabs without overwhelming perusing it, having fun while lightly coating it with a point.

The picture quality of this DVD version isn't bad...especially considering the age of the film.  Very little in the way of color artifacting and interference.  The VHS version can't compare, although the sound seems to shift from quiet to loud in certain scenes which is a little odd.
I must say the one disappointing aspect of this DVD version has to be the much touted extras.  The Monroeville Mall clip is nothing but a 15 second 1970's-era commercial.  From what the packaging said, I figured it was some sort of short documentary detailing the location and reasoning as to why this particular location was used.  Sadly, that was not the case and I felt a bit mislead.  Also, the ""extra"" scenes from the European release Zombi are again rather lacking and misleading.  Only two alternate scenes are shown and even then, the differences are VERY small such as some extra dialog thrown in on the scene when the group is in their safehouse area in the mall and the engagement ring dinner scene is slightly different.  The film quality is REALLY bad in these extra scenes and isn't what I was expecting.

817995,5,6304240554,"George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead is, from where I stand, the most ambitious, creative, best horror film ever made; or at least the best horror film in the twentieth century.
It holds all the facets for a great character study piece- and it is somewhere inside a perfectly crafted zombie movie in creating a uniqye suspense and excitement alongside the gory and cartoonish carnage.  It also works as a satire, and having such a reach into other genres like that for a budget of this caliber is always a reasurring sign to me that movies like this are still around.
There is evidence, a good amount, to support the adulation.  The script itself gets praise in the terms of telling a coherent story.  And the script delivers such effectiveness in showcasing a parallel dimension deadland it could be on the basis of that alone to be one of the most original.
Not to say the ideas and themes on characters are the most original.  In Romero's first picture, Night of the Living Dead (Dawn's predecessor in a ""dead Trilogy"" with the third the mediocre Day of the Dead) displayed many of the key trademarks to be expected- characters getting tenser and a lot of internal combustion not only from getting crazed in a chillingly forboding precense, but as well the cannibalistic-instinct driven corpses.  The first debut of zombies in such a way was a smash in horro cult cultrue (deservedly so) and made Mr. Romero's reputation on sight.
The original part, however, comes in the form of transferrance- the key elements from ""Night"" are brought to an apocalyptic timewarp where muzak is a big chunk of the score.  Making the message of zombies encompassing a shopping mall isn't tough to connect to reality, but with its cleverness there's a place for endless opportunities for so many gags, drama-bits and shock for any writer and director to latch onto.
George grasps on to all of them.
Acting goes farther than expected, the score outside and sometimes inside the mall from the Goblins (and in the director's cut by Romero himself) is indeed impressive in heightening tension, and so on.  The one complaint here is in the DVD itself.  It has the essentials, the director's cut (superior to the 128 minute version) in widescreen and trailers, but there should've been more for a ""Collectors Edition"".  Romero commented on the ""Night"" special edition DVD and doesn't here, nor are included any of the deleted footage that was shown in the German footage.  The Monroeville commercial spot on the other Dawn DVD isn't here either.
But those are feebles for the spoiled at DVD buyer heart; immortal moviemaking and acting all around, Dawn of the Dead is the plum of all plums in the horror world.",1022284800,2,2688,4.773706896551724

Still, this is highly recommended material, thanks to the numerous carnage-filled action sequences (particularly the beginning and the finale)(and I swear, you'll never see a movie with more bloody gunshots to the head!), the mostly effective satire and emphasis on characterization, and a terrific lead performance from Ken Foree.",1019174400,3,630,5.552083333333333

Good charactorization, plot values are the same as the original ,but sometimes differ. In Night they made the zombies are a nightmareish blood eating monsters, Dawn mades the zombies almost lifike and almost a man without a soul. In dawn there are no easy way outs, its down to the bone. Gratatudes to George A. Romero for this zombie classic. I'm telling you this movie should not be watched once. see it 10 times if you have to. The more times you see it the movie,the more times you will appreciate it. I love the charactors in this movie.

Secondly the makeup (zombies) looked like assembly line makeup meaning the zombie in my opinion weren't that scarey, well there's one.
Now to the positive parts of the movie, the idea is fascinating! I mean what worries would we have except staying alive? complete anarchy (good or bad). The storyline is very good some of the gore happens inside a run down tenement where the SWAT team moves in on, and yes its full of zombies.. (and some dopey live people)
I won't get into detail about the gory scenes but there are some real graphic ones, also some silly scenes too with idiotic music

818064,4,6304240554,"If you're a horror fan, chances are you've already seen this movie.  So I'll not be redundent and get into what most of the other reviewers have already said by issuing the much deserved platitudes.
  If you haven't seen this movie, do NOT run and rent it.  Contrary to what you may have already read, this movie is not for everyone.  For those of us who are horror fans and especially for those of us- even smaller in number- who are attracted to the sub-genre of zombie films this movie is the be-all-end-all of all reanimated-deceased cinema.  However, because this movie has made its way into the horror film canon, we've overlooked some of it shortcomings that might turn off people who just enjoy the occasional scary movie.  For example, it hasn't aged as well as most of would have liked.  I mean, most of the zombies are creepy, but a good number of them wear only the most splotchiest of blue (?) pancake.  The pacing is VERY slow by today's (or any day's really) standards.  Sure, we can say Romero was building tension, at times even making us forget that the Zombies even exist... But do we REALLY need to see Francine slather herself in make-up and make kissy faces at herself in a mirror with a colt .45?
  And yes, I agree that the acting is superb- but the characterization is not always consistent.  Is there really any indication that either Steven or Fran is in love with each other? Think about it.
  But I digress.  I wanted to express my disappointment with the actual DVD.  The digital technology is great; I couldn't live without DVD's, but sometimes the clean, digital picture disrupts the feel of the film.  Just like the ""cleaning up"" of Night Of The Living Dead removed the atmospheric, documentary-like graininess of that film, the digitization detracts from the quality of Dawn. (It's no fun when you can see the squibs before they go off.)
  The added scenes are lame.  They really don't add much to the picture-except to possibly augment the already mundane ""anyone got a cigarette?"" joke.
  But most disappointing are the extra features.  The trailer is ok, but for the most part standard with all DVD's.  The Monroeville Mall commercial is clever and oddly eerie.  But the dropped scenes blow.  They're weakness is magnified by the preface describing that overseas scenes were removed because they were too gory and then we get scenes of dialogue!  Dialogue is fine, but don't mislead us with that lousy introduction. We already bought the damn thing at that point, so what are you trying to sell?
  There are certainly DVD's out there with weaker bonus features than Dawn, but is that an excuse? So much more could have been done. When are we going to be able to see the fabled dual-suicide alternate ending? And would a commentary hurt?  You can't tell me that David Emge (or any of the other stars for that matter) is too busy to sit down for two hours and talk about his film.
  Please understand that the majority of this criticism of this particular DVD stems from my true appreciation for the movie.  I want to see more.  And I'm sure there is plenty more to show somewhere but I'm not sure why it is not available to the fans.  Unless, of course, the decision makers at Anchor Bay are pulling a George Lucas and plan to re-release a ""very special limited edition"" with about four minutes of tacked on extra-material every 6 months for us to buy.",1011744000,8,3388,4.607023411371237

818068,3,6304240554,"The first time I watched ""Dawn of the Dead,"" I was a freshman in high school. The only reason I rented it was because good old Roger Ebert had praised the film so highly as to call it one of the best horror films ever made, along with a nice little 4-star-with-comment plug on the box. I watched the film in the confines of my little up-north trailer, the images flooding my head. By the end, I came to a simple conclusion: I hated this movie with every part of my being. I was expecting something utterly catastrophic; something so grueling and unforgettable it would make ""The Evil Dead"" look like Levar Burton reading The Three Little Pigs on Reading Rainbow. I didn't get what I expected. I hung on every word of dialogue, hoping and praying for a smashing conclusion that would make me forget the first hour and a half of the film, forgiving the director's ills. After all, this man made ""Night of the Living Dead,"" one of the truly ultimate horror films of the past 50 years. I felt cheated when it was over and I went to bed with visions of severed heads and plodding zombies dancing in my head like sugarplums are supposed to. The years past, and something weird kept happening: I couldn't get the damn movie out of my mind. It kept creeping around in my memory whenever discussions of horror films came up. I could still envision a lot of the sequences exactly as they happened, and I could hear that one dude saying the infamous ""When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth"" quote that taglines the front of every video. This pointed to a truth I didn't want to face: ""Dawn of the Dead"" was a memorable, affecting film that got under my skin despite my undying hatred for it. So I decided to ante up and use a free Blockbuster coupon (I don't gamble with cash on movies I hated) to rent it once again, with fresh eyes and a developed appreciation for filmmaking. I watched it over the span of three days (Day One: I was tired, Day Two: I was busy, Day Three: I finally had an hour or two to spare), and guess what, I liked it. It got me thinking about a Spielberg on Kubrick interview I saw, where he admits that he didn't like ""The Shining"" when he first saw it (heh, neither did I), but now he's seen it 25 times: one of his favorite films. I doubt this film will ever rank in that distinction, but I'll probably rent it again in another month or so, when I'm not tired or busy, and can pay full attention.
Anywho, to the review part: ""Dawn of the Dead"" is not terrifying at all in the traditional sense. It's got an underlying feeling of horror to it that makes it very unique. The tension isn't really building so much as it remains steady, mostly between our characters, not so much the zombies. But the movie isn't about the zombies. It's about us, the people who are left to battle them in our quest for survival, and how, even in the gravest of situations, we still desperately seek material comfort in the midst of chaos. And more than anything (this is the most terrifying truth of all, which leads to a great sequence involving a band of looters) we will do anything to ""protect our stuff."" George Romero is excellent with satire. His most recent film, ""Bruiser,"" is an excellent example of this, but you can definitely see him stretching his muscles to the limit with this film, which gets under our skin on a weird level and makes us sort of afraid of ourselves. In essence, it's us that are uncivilized; the monsters. The zombies, simply acting on instinct with nothing but the primal jelly of their deadened brains to keep them going, are blameless. It's a different way of looking at this genre of horror film, and while I rate this at the same level as Lucio Fulci's gore-soaked ""Zombie,"" which was released the same year in Italy, ""Dawn of the Dead"" is actually a much better film because of that skewed perspective. This film isn't terrifying because of its plentiful gore or the savagery of the zombies: It's terrifying because it's so brutally truthful and horrifically satirical that you can't get it out of your head for a long time after. This is one for film classes to discuss.",1005177600,,4133,4.425196850393701
818069,5,6304240554,"Dawn of the Dead is not just another zombie flick...it's a diagnostic on materialism that was growing up in the eighties (and that is always growing up!). The film sets in a world that is being invaded with zombies...They are everywhere, and the only way to destroy them is to shoot them in the head. Some humans even have fun killing the zombies and play stupid games involving money for the one who takes the less bullets to kill a zombie. Maybe you think it's stupid, but I'm sure a lot of people would do that in a near situation. Two guys from the SWAT team fly away with two lovers who worked for a TV station. They don't accept to live with zombies. So, the perfect place they find is a shopping mall. But the shopping mall is full of zombies too, and they'll have to get rid of them if they want to live in peace in the mall. It's weird, because, when I was young, I dreamed of becoming a movie director...I'm still dreaming about that, by the way...and I thought about the scenario of a horror movie where the heroes are prisonners of a shopping center...and I didn't know that Dawn of The Dead did it...So, when I watched it, it was like watching a movie I made...and you don't know how much fun I had watching this. We all dreamed one day of living in a mall, where we can take everything we want for free...Well, this film is the closest thing to our dream...The music is very good, it's made by The Goblins, an Italian band who worked a couple of times with Dario Argento...The special effects from Tom Savini are pretty amazing too, even though they are not as good as the ones in Day of The Dead.

818070,5,6304240554,"[...] This is essentially the print released during the original 1978 release; the only difference is some additional material added during the police dock scene.  The Cannes cut and the so-called ""Director's Edition"" are interesting, but not what Romero intended for domestic audiences.
That being said, ""Dawn"" is no ordinary horror film!  So many reviewers completely miss the point. DOTD, in my view, does NOT suffer from anachronism.  Indeed, this brilliant satire of consumerism is very appropriately set during the 1970s. The excess, the self-absorption of the ""me"" decade is a perfect backdrop. The special effects are indeed cartoonish and not particularly scary. This is perfectly appropriate for the satirical nature of a film that some interpret as a very dark sarcastic tragedy.
The film is a continuation of the scenario of ""Night of the Living Dead"".  The recently dead have risen and are attacking the living.  ""Dawn"" starts 3 weeks after ""Night"", and the living dead have begun to get the upper-hand over humanity.  To make matters worse, many of the human survivors refuse to acknowledge the situation, in some cases inciting rioting, looting, and violence among the remaining human population.  Four survivors from diverse backgrounds take to the skies in a traffic helicopter to find refuge, and they land in a shopping mall in an area overrun by the living dead.  The quartet manage to wall themselves within the mall and set up a small survivor colony.  The nearly limitless supply of goods and diversions in their shopping mall citadel appeals to their natural consumerism, and they spend the next several months in a fog of denial and overconsumption.  Of course, such a short-sighted society will eventually feed upon itself and collapse...
Those viewers wanting brutality and violence by themselves (without the interference of Romero's subtext) will not especially enjoy this film.  Alternative films directe by  Fulci, HG Lewis, etc. should satisfy this audience.  There had never been a film like this up until 1978, and it's unfair to compare DOTD with its successors.
Technical details are average across the board, note that details about the aspect ration can be found on IMDB and elsewhere.  Extras are sparse; this film cries out for at least a directors commentary and digital cleanup.  There are rumors of a future Anchor Bay edition containing much more than this package offers; in the meantime, this edition will occupy a needed place in a thinking person's horror collection.

818118,5,6304240554,"This is without a doubt the greatest horror film of all time. Scary, horrifying, funny, intelligent, humorous and atmospheric, George A. Romero pulled out all the stops and created a sequel that well and truly rises above its predecessor ""Night of the Living Dead"". I first saw this in 1988, and it was the first film I ever saw that not only made me want to see the sequels and prequels, but find out everything about the people who made it and how they went about it. In short, in started my love of film-making, as opposed to movies, but anyway back to the film...
A co-production with Dario Argento, ""Dawn"" picks up the story where ""NOTLD"" left off, depicting the collapse of society as imminent and establishing the four main characters (Two SWAT troopers, and two television employees) who decide to flee the city and wind up holing up in a large shopping mall beseiged with the living dead.
Watching the zombies staggering around the aisles and escalators is pretty obvious symbolism, but is still pretty potent viewing. Particularly when combined with Tom Savini's splatter FX and Goblin's superlative score (one of the best soundtrack's of all time in my opinion). The acting is realistic and the production values astounding for $1.5 million or so.
Unlike most reviews I have seen here, I totally disagree with the comments about this 127 minute version. This is the version that Romero wished to release, THIS IS THE DIRECTOR'S CUT, and he fought the MPAA tooth and nail to get it! The 140 MINUTE VERSION IS A ROUGH CUT and while it does have extra gore and extrapolation scenes in it, none of them add that much with the possible exception of one shot of Peter riding a trolley through the empty mall. In addition to which, that edition being an unfinished version misses out on much of the Goblin music that adds so greatly to the atmosphere of the film. It is certainly worth seeing and even owning, but I would not say it is any better than this version.
The extras are not fantastic I agree. The other Anchor Bay version (140 min) has two trailers on it, instead of just the one we get here. The bits from the Argento version are interesting, but nothing special (although it's interesting that Argento version has slightly less gore, a lot less humour and more talking!!), I liked the Monroeville Mall ad it was pretty kitch and funny. Extra scenes would have been great (but then Anchor Bay can't sell two versions), A featurette would have been cool (but you'll have to dig up ""Document of the Dead"" for that), a commentary would have been the best (but I guess Elite had the rights and George couldn't be bothered again), I think 5.1 would have really added to the film, but the Mono is clear and is all I've ever heard, so I'm not going to let it annoy me too much. I have seen this film in the cinema (both 127min and 140min) and both were matted at 1:66:1 like this, so that's cool with me as well. As far as I'm concerned this is the best film Mr Romero has ever done (surpassing NOTLD, Creephshow, Knightriders, Monkey Shines and Martin), and was and is and probably will always be THE BEST HORROR FILM EVER CREATED. Much respect to George A. Romero and thank you for the only film I have seen over 100 times and still find fresh.",993945600,23,3255,4.537414965986395

The transfer quality as amazing, especially if you've ever seen it on VHS. In the beginning, Romero has the ability to actually feel bad for the zombies, for instance, when the police raid the apartment building and find that the tennants are hiding their ""undead"" family members inside, I really felt bad for the woman who did didn't want the police to shoot her zombie husband. But then again, he did take I big chunk out of her neck, didn't he? And,seeing a young Ken Foree from TCM III was awesome.

And if you want real haunt-your-nightmares zombie chills, nothing has ever come remotely close to the original ""Night of the Living Dead"".
But ""Dawn"" is worth watching for its great premise and skillful direction, even though it's half an hour too long (the condition now known as ""Tarantino-itis"") and undercuts its effectiveness with silliness like having bikers attack the zombies with cream pies.

This is a savage satiric attack on American consumerism that is even more meaningful today than it was in 1979.

But for all the films (splatter, cannibal, zombie, whatever label you care to attach to) that this movie inspired or just plain ripped off (we're talking close to a hundred films, folks), not ONE film comes close to Romero's take of the reliance of society's commercialism and the ultimate downfall of our dependency for it. These issues usually don't pop up in horror films.
It also has one of the best and influencial soundtracks ever utilized in a horror movie. A full score written for the movie by the soundtrack specialist group Goblin and tracks from the DeWolfe Music Library edited together as only George Romero can make a perfect match to what is on the screen. There are no punches pulled here.
Unfortunately, Anchor Bay's 20 Anniversary Edition DVD is a letdown. The picture and sound quality is the best I've ever seen and heard, but it's a full frame picture with some information lost in the 1.66:1 letterboxing.
The DVD supplements are truly disappointing. A theatrical trailer, a Monroeville Mall commercial spot, and a few alternate scenes used from Dario Argento's European version (another story in itself). Ironically, these scenes are presented in the correct 1.85:1 matting. Weird. At the very least there should have been an audio commentary from George Romero, makeup effects artist/actor Tom Savini, or even from a film historian, say Tim Lucas; this would do the film justice.

818172,4,6304240554,"11 long years after his highly successful directorial debut ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968), cinematic horror maestro George Romero unleashed its first sequel, ""Dawn of the Dead"", one of those rare continuations that not only equals its predecessor, but even manages to surpass it.
The film basically picks up where ""Night"" left off.  By now the plague of man-eating zombies has all but engulfed the nation and a small band of rebels have managed to fortify themselves inside a Pennsylvanian shopping mall.  However, they are not alone in the mall as they only occupy a small upstairs storage room unknown to the multitude of zombies shuffling through the myriad of department stores below them.
That's all I'm going to say about this movie because its such a great film and I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't yet had a chance to view it.
I will say this however, ""Dawn of the Dead"" is certainly not for the sqeamish and those who do not particularly care for horror films.  The amount of gore in the film is often very excessive and the atmosphere maintained in the film is one that is highly unsettling.  True fans of the genre who have not seen this film yet, though, should make a point to see it as soon as possible.
If there are any questions or doubts going through your mind as to this film's level of actual ""horror"", let me just say this.  Personally, I do not scare easily and very rarely do I ever see a film that actually frightens me or makes me feel uneasy.  However, to date, I have had atleast 2 or 3 nightmares brought about as a result from having viewed Romero's ""Dead"" trilogy. Both ""Night"" and ""Dawn"" are very well made and scary motion pictures, while the third entry, ""Day of the Dead"", even though not a bad film, lacks the crucial elements that made the first two films the horror classics they have become.
A possible fourth entry in Romero's series of Zombie films has been hinted at for years, but George has stated that it will probably never come to be.  His fans can only wait and hope.",987033600,8,2031,4.502717391304348

818174,4,6304240554,"One reviewer stated that because this film is a comment on consumerism (especially for the late 70's when this was made) and because this film has alot of gore doesn't make it a good movie.  True.  These are just a few things in this movie people delight in (really, I don't know why) and these are not the things that make this a good or bad movie.
Overall this movie is meant to do one thing: Scare you and make you have fun while it scares you.  And if you let it (like you should let any movie do what it tries to do...suspension of disbelief folks, it's a wonderful thing) you will be scared.  And yes, you will have fun with it.
Many shots and scenes here have fear in them.  ie: zombies pouring into the elevator with their hands stretched to the camera; Flyboy caught in a zombie game of hide and seek in the boiler room; a harrycaritina(sp?) zombie coming for a lone and unarmed Fran, etc.  But there is a deeper sense of fear at work here.  One that really makes people remember this movie as a good fright fest.  In this (as well as Romero's 2 other zombie flicks) the dead do not crawl from their coffins and up through 6 feet of dirt, there are no skeletons among them, and the only way to kill them is to destroy their re-animated brains.  Truely, IF zombies were to rise and take the earth (but of course they won't) I'm positive that it would be just as Romero visioned it.  Also, with these movies the theme of surival horror is at it's peak.  This isn't the vampire story where you must kill the master to restore everything, this isn't Evil Dead where you must only survive the night.  In this world, no matter where you run, no matter how many you kill, and no matter how long you survive, you will NEVER be free from the zombies.  One last thing, Romero's three movies give their own reason why it's happening, and NO ONE can shake a stick at these reasons.  Radiation from space for example, we don't even know everything about earth let alone from space.  Of course I don't believe such a thing will happen, but like I said, No one can say for a FACT that this CAN'T happen...
People say this film is full of bad editing...not true, Romero likes his audience to experience the shot rather than see it.  That is why there are alot of quick and odd timed cuts that give this film a strange sense of pace.  Movies of today don't do this.  Which is why someone may consider the editing of this film bad.  But it's not true.
And the campiness of this film is not to be denied!  How can we hold camp AGAINST a movie when it sets out to find camp in the first place?!

When I rented ""Dawn of the Dead,"" I expected a horror masterpiece of epic proportions; one that I would be talking about for years to come, like all of the critics whose reviews I had read, which detailed a film so violent and ahead of its time that it would deeply affect anyone who actually could stomach the film's running time. The film started out interesting enough. There was a roller coaster ride of violence that began with a police raid on a building that was infilterated by zombies. Heads exploded from shotgun shells, necks were bitten, chunks of flesh torn away from limbs... All well and good. The make-up effects looked acceptable, and I was interested in the characters. But then the film lost me. The survivors in this film head for the mall, and they attempt to seek shelter from this supposedly unstoppable force of zombies. Now, I can understand why dozens of these things coming at you would be a threat, but in this movie they look like grey people and nothing more. They plod around aimlessly and rarely seem to have any objective. We see them destroyed wholesale in all sorts of ways, but yet they never seem to illustrate any threat until they have one person cornered. I wasn't scared by them at all, yet I persevered in watching this movie because I was expecting some sort of terrifying pay off that made all of this so-called sophisticated satire and gore worthwhile. I never got it. The pay off didn't come, and I turned off the TV feeling cheated. ""Dawn of the Dead"" could've been something magnificent if only George Romero had bumped up the pace at which the zombies attack, shortened the movie by about twenty minutes, and didn't so blatantly try and hit us over the head with the satire stick. A little subtlety would've helped too. ""Dawn"" missed so many opportunities it could've capitalized on that, to me anyway, it's nothing more than a series of misthrown darts that struck so far away from the bull's eye you'd need an RV and a ten day supply of food and water to retrieve them. Now, I know that many people who have seen this movie think of it as a masterpiece of the genre, and how dare I sully the good name of such a good director, but I just didn't see what this movie had to offer in the entertainment category. Sure, there are some laughs and some moments of genuine tension, but they don't make up for an overlong script, stretches of silence that have no point, mediocre acting, and hundreds of grey people that do nothing more than wander up the down escalator, which is why I give the film 2 stars. Seriously, if these zombies can rip open a man's abdomen and rip his intestines out like they were tearing through plastic wrap, why can't a whole group of them break through a window?

But otherwise, this is lacking in both wit and actual fear.  It's a trashy type of film you see at around 2 in the morning with a pizza in your hand.  Just because it claims to be a satire on consumerism doesn't make it a good movie.  Just because it had gore doesn't make it a good movie.

818229,4,6304240554,"I have to say that seeing ""Dawn of the Dead"" after 20 years have passed has taken a bit of the shock appeal away from this film. As a 9-year old kid, I thought it was the epitome of gore & horror. But having grown older and wiser, it's not really an all-out gorefest zombie doomsday film. It's really a dark-humored social slap at a materialistic society. But it's a great film beyond any shock value.
If you're looking for rotting, disgusting, worm-filled zombies, you'll be let down. Other than a handful of particularly gruesome corpses, the  majority of zombies look like stagehands who were beaten with effects supervisor Tom Savini's grandmother's powder puff kit. For the most part, they hardly look menacing. The real engine that drives this film is the storyline.
Right at the outset, we are shown a society that is overrun by the living dead. An assault team gets their ranks decimated by zombies in a battle at a housing project, and two of the men end up in a news helicopter with a reporter and her pilot. They travel to an airport to refuel, battle more zombies, and finally make it a suburban shopping mall. This is where all of the plot elements come together and really shine. Our four main characters set up shop inside the mall, clearing it of all the walking dead and making a nice little pad for themselves. They loot, pillage, rob, and live the good life in their new-found haven. But in the end, greed and materialism costs them dearly. It's well-done black humor.
""Dawn"" has all the classic elements of the zombie genre: sharpshooters impaling zombies between the eyes; dashing and darting around hordes of the slow-moving monsters; entrails being ripped out and eaten; chunks of flesh being ripped out of arms,legs, and necks; and those unfortunate enough to be bitten by the creeps turning into cannibalistic undead themselves; even an annoying Hare Krishna zombie! Romero takes a broad slap at a greedy society, pompous scientists, grating reporters, trouble-making lowlifes, and a general public who, even in undeath, flock to the shopping mall like so many sheep. Very clever undertones to the storyline.
While I can't agree that ""Dawn"" is the ultimate horror film(that mantle, IMHO, belongs to John Carpenter's brilliant masterpiece ""The Thing""), it is a true classic in it's own right. Do yourself a favor and get the director's cut, and follow it up with ""Day of the Dead"" & ""Return of the Living Dead"", the next two outstanding films in the series. From the original ""Night of the Living Dead"", up through ""Return of the Living Dead"", the series truly is the strongest in the zombie genre.",981158400,,2622,4.800884955752212

Even though a few of the Zombie gore scenes are missing the atmosphere is still much stronger. I would recomend any true fan to have both US versions of the film.  The previous Anchor Bay two sided version has its advantages too. Its the longest unrated version available and the sound recording and picture are slightly better (still mono though). This 138 minute version is no longer available unfortunately but you will find plenty of them up for grabs on ebay.com. Thats how I got mine.  Down to the theatrical DVD. The extras aren't very impressive for a start. Id like to have seen more of the Argento scenes as I still haven't seen ZOMBI (European version). Also I would have liked a commentary or at least an interview of some sort. Elite entertainment always deliver great versions of classic films but Anchor bay are slacking a bit at the mo.  The second very dissapointing aspect of this disk is the sound. It is recorded in a very linear mono track. Allot of the time the music goes low then high again. Also during the final Zombie battle at the end, you will notice mistakes in the sound recording. It Skips ever so slightly. You will have to listen carefully to notice these errors though so don't get too worried. Still I have got over these problems now and I worship this DVD and film. I would recommend this to any Dawn of the Dead fan.  Ive heard rumours of a special edition but this won't be until 2002. No way could I wait that long.

Mall haven+ undead hourdes= our heroes are in for a fright filled, combat frenzied, kill or be undead classic. If you are new to this series then take heart that there are others out there that also provide the basic zombie filled situations and fun. But this is the best of the best in my opinion. The crowning gem in Romero's crown. Run, hide, pray, but that's all going to amount to nothing because the undead is out there and they're hungry for the living. Fun for the horror lover in all of all us.",975369600,,865,4.248484848484848
818235,5,6304240554,"The Living Dead are back and this time they're going shopping, for live human flesh!  Four survivors of the mass hysteria that ensues from the original Night of the Living Dead hole up in a Mall, feeling safe and secure (with everything they could possibly need there for the taking).  Of course those pesky zombies are attracted to the living (their sustenance) and the four must contend with the slow moving hordes of the undead.  George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead is arguably as good, if not better than Night of the Living Dead, depending on who you ask.  Much more graphic, and this time in living color, the zombies are even more relentless and vicious.  But in this post apocalyptic nightmare it's not just the zombies that are the threat, but bands of anarchistic survivors as well.  It's every man for himself as our quartet battle to save their new home from the dead and the living.  A great social satire on the materialistic American ideal that in any given catastrophe could literally become a deathtrap.  Violent, funny, and excruciatingly frightening, Dawn of the Dead is a must have for any Horror fan's collection.  Followed by Day of the Dead and a 1990 remake of Night of the Living Dead (directed by special effects wizard Tom Savini, who was responsible for the zombie effects).

There lust for human flesh is made all too clear with the superb special makeup effects by Tom Savini. While we watch the characters try to survive and keep themselves from being torned apart we also are drawned into all the gore that this film throws at us. Just imagine what it would be like if the dead really did rise. Forget nuclear war. Maybe that was George A.Romero was asking himself while making this sequel.

But violence not the only thing needed to make a  good horror movie. The make up is really bad. The zombies and the blood  look obviously fake. And there is a very important point I want to say and  this point makes me laugh while seeing Dawn of the Dead, not frightened.  How can anybody play, laugh and looks happy while fighting dead people,  zombies, something you have never seen in your live?  This is very bad  point in this movie. Do you know why?  Because you can't get scared if you  watched people surrounded by zombies and they don't look scared.

The ending was terrible, unrealistic, and poorly acted.  The  special f/x were the only thing good about the film, but it was still too  gory for a 1970's movie.  I felt I was watching a ""Faces of  Death"" film, with a little bit of comedy in the mix.  Please do not  eat while watching this film.  I saw this movie for the first time a few  months ago on Cinemax.  I wanted to see what all of the talk was about on  this film.  Two and a half hours later I found out.  The film was so corny,  that I taped it and brought it to my cousin the same day to watch and  suffer through.  He felt the same way as I do, and was angry that I  suckered him into watching a movie like that. I guess that because I was  bitter about the movie, I had to take my anger out on someone else.  Unfortunately, it was my innocent by-stander cousin.  It was definately 2  1/2 hours of our lives that we wanted back.  I can't believe production  companies would even consider coming out with a special edition, director's  cut of this film.  If you have not seen this film, and have heard all of  the talk about how good it is, please be my guest and watch it, and form  your own opinion.  Hopefully you will feel the same way I do, and be really  bitter about the time you wasted watching the movie.  If not, then i'm  wondering what is happening to the world.

818285,5,6304240554,"This is a brilliant horror film.  If you like horror films and haven't seen this one, you're in for quite a treat.  By far the best and most fun of George Romero's ""Dead"" triology, this is also, in my opinion,  the best horror film ever made.
Four survivors of a world-wide  yawning-grave zombie plague hole up in an abandoned shopping mall and fend  off the mindless swarm of zombies that pose a threat to their continued  existence.
Romero does a terrific job of constructing an equally creepy  and adventurous atmosphere.  Being a child of the seventies, some of my  earliest memories are of wandering around large shopping malls in tow of my  mom.  Place has always been an important thing for me, and this movie is  definitely a movie with a spirit of ""place"".  This movie touched  something deep in me the first time I saw it when I was about 14, and I've  loved it ever since.  There's plenty of wonder, adventure, fun, and humor  to balance the film's apocolyptic creepiness and bright-red comic book  gore.  I also love the love-of-film-making which makes itself so evident in  the film's camera angles, editing, choice of music, and montage shots.
It  would doubtlessly be terrifying to truly be one of the last few people left  on the face of the earth with warm blood flowing through your veins, but  there's something about imagining banding together with a couple of friends  and taking on a world of zombies that seems so...well, so fun.  ""Dawn  of the Dead"" makes it seem like it might just be the time of your  life.
An excellent film, maybe not perfect in all technical senses, but  clearly making up for any flaws with an abundance of style, mood, and  substance.
I just hope George Romero decides to release another version  of this DVD including a commentary track, as he did with the recent DVD  relases of his other great films ""Knightriders"" and  ""Martin"".  Of course, I also hope his name will be returning to  the big screen sometime soon.",964828800,,1965,4.649122807017544
818286,4,6304240554,"The reviews previous to this are pretty much accurate.  Romero's follow is probably one of the 10 best Horror movies of the 1970's.  However, while other (such as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre) trys to grab you by pushing the  limits with shock, Georgie boy goes the other way by getting you to think  just a touch.
This movie is not really a sequel to Night of the Living  Dead (one of the top 10 of the 1960's), but can be seen as related (set 1~2  years after).  Man is in dire danger, as the dead have come back to life.  Civilization is breaking down and choas is helping the Zombie's win.  Four  survivors take off in a helicopter and are forced to land on the roof of a  shopping mall, surrounded by Zombies.
The movie paints broad strokes,  the characters are just not really developed enough.  The movie is about  materialism and greed, and how our current society is based more on  emptiness (using the shopping mall as a mecca as an example) rather than  any sound foundation.
The DVD is bare, with a few features (the  funniest being an advertisement for the mall, where the movie was shot).  There is no audio commentary and the soundtrack was in Mono.  However, if  you like horror movies to be alittle less about T&A and Gore, try out  the Dawn of the Dead.....Before there is no more room in hell....Rating: B.",964656000,2,1324,4.456066945606694

How can everyone be so in love with  such utterly terrible acting, writing, and special effects?  From  everything I'd heard about Dawn and from seeing its wonderful predecessor,  I was expecting a terrifying and socially relevant movie about humans  struggling against the living dead; what I got was a completely awful film  with annoying characters running around slapping zombies and throwing pies  in their undead faces to the background accompaniment of ridiculous,  inappropriate Pac-Man music.

818391,4,6304240554,"Aaaaah, kids these days whose idea of 'horror' is a guy in a funny mask and a machete have got it all wrong. THIS is the real stuff of late night shivers. This low-budget sequel to 'Night of the Living Dead' was a staple  of Midnight Movie showings of the mid-eighties, and anyone who grew up  during that period should know it well. Others here have covered the  details of the plot, so I'll spare you that and simply give a few personal  impressions.
  I confess the notion of unending hordes of mindless,  decaying monsters who's only goal is to tear me into tiny pieces and  consume me alive has given me far more nightmares over the years than any  other movie I can think of. One of the features that makes these films so  unsettling is that just as soon as the viewers and film characters have  achieved some sense of safety and security behind thick walls and locked  doors, one small mistake or unavoidable event throws everything into  violent dissaray, collapsing this safe world like a house of cards.  Overall the film is an enjoyable mixture of action, drama, horror, and yes,  a little comedy. The characters come off as sympathetic for the most part.  You admire the resoursefulness and bravery of this small group of people  surviving such a horrific world.  Though at times you can see their  resolve, and even their grasp on sanity begin to crumble around the edges.  A nice touch in my opinion.(Let's see Shwartzenegger show a little remorse  next time HE blows away a room full of badguys in his next film!) The  overall cheap look of the production, much like other effective horror  films like The Blair Witch Project, simply adds to the nightmarish  atmosphere.  The action seemed realistic for the most part. I think  perhaps Romero tried to make up for the small film budget by making the  action onscreen as real as possible. Weapon damage seems realistic for the  most part, (thanks to the always-outstanding talents of Tom Savini) and  guns don't give off the overdone jets of flame that modern filmmakers seem  to prefer nowadays. The decayed zombies are appropriately terrifying,  although some may find the blue-green makeup hastily applied to most of the  extra a bit silly.  Here's a tip for those who love bloopers and have  a VCR with a good Freeze Frame. During the scene where Roger is using his  Semi to run down Zombies, watch for the shot directly following the one  where one leaves a splot of blood on the windshield. There's an external  shot of the body being tossed aside. In the first few frames you can see  the tiny trampoline the stuntman uses just before the truck roars past the  camera!  Overall an enjoyable, but disturbing film, best watched during  daylight hours.",957139200,3,2720,4.690021231422505

The acting is brilliant. The actors really bring they're characters  to life, and you easily become attached to them. George A. Romero's  direction is  wonderful.

There is no  suspense with the exception of the climax but that is just not enough.  The  zombies are apropriatly human-like but rather goofy with there blue skin.  Did they all die of hypothermia or something?  The characters are likeable  but overall, bland and flat.  The atmosphere of the whole flick was wrong.  It was not at all moody or scary like the original Night of the Living  Dead.  Even the gore effects were not that well done.  All in all, this  movie bears all of the hallmarks of a movie done by a guy who just wanted  to preach about how awful soceity is and did not really care about making a  good movie.

818452,4,6304240554,"""Dawn of the Dead"" is the only movie that I have seen in recent years which genuinely frightened me. My brother and I rented it on a Friday and started it late at night. We decided to watch the rest of it the next  day. But, I won't forget watching the first part: the fear that thousands  of zombies are going to rush out of somewhere and outnumber the heroes. Or  that a ton of zombies will leap out from around a corner. The story  concerns two SWAT cops, a TV news producer, and her boyfriend -- the TV  station's news helicopter pilot -- getting out of Philadelphia when dead  bodies turn into zombies and start killing the living. This film is  atmospheric and claustrophobic. And Romero's idea of using a shopping mall  as the setting of the core of the story was a true stroke of genius --  where better to confront the human condition of materialism, selfishness,  and a whole ton of nasty zombies? The film was made in the late 1970's for  a slim $1.5 million. But, it was put to good use -- showing that Romero  knew how to stretch a dollar, making it go a long way. My only complaint  about the movie is the gore, which is actually what the film is most famous  for. These scenes come at the beginning and end of the film. (The end is  where the zombies feasting on live humans kicks into SERIOUS overload)  These scenes show too much and go on far too long, but I guess Romero  wanted to show just how threatening the zombies could really be. Too bad  he's not doing that ""Resident Evil"" movie. But, that's okay.  Stick with this film. It's the real thing (no pun intended).",949017600,6,1587,4.31864406779661
818453,3,6304240554,"Elite's reissue of Dawn of the Dead on VHS a couple of years ago is, to me, the definitive version of this movie -- tight, horrific, and organic, with a macabre rhythm all its own.  On this DVD edition, the film lost  nearly 10 minutes, resulting in a more jarring sense of editing and overall  a less effective cut than the 138-minute one.
This is one DVD that could  have used more bonus material, for example from the George A. Romero  documentary, behind-the-scenes footage (if such footage exists), outtakes,  and so on.  Comments have already been made about the Monroeville Mall  commercial and they are more or less correct -- amusing, but too short.  The ""alternate scenes from Zombi"" are even worse -- there are  only two scenes, and that's pretty scant.  Firstly they aren't as  indicative of Dario Argento's hand in Zombi as they should be:  Argento  reputedly used more of the Goblin score, and neither of these scenes is  heavily scored; Argento veers towards imagery, but these scenes are  dramatic, shot in loose basic coverage; Argento crafted the Zombi cut for  European audiences, and neither of the extra scenes shows any difference in  the European sensibility.  The biggest gripe is that they simply didn't  include enough of the different scenes.
There are no cast bios, no  articles, no interviews, and there's only one theatrical trailer which,  though well done, pales in comparison to the endlessly fascinating European  trailers (some German, some English) included in the earlier VHS reissue  from Elite.
I'm disappointed in the release and hope to see a more  complete one of the complete 138-minute cut in the future on DVD.",948672000,34,1655,4.930909090909091

818455,5,6304240554,"George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead is a true horror epic classic if ever there was one. Horror genre fanatics and detrators know of the obvious artistic defects and omissions always inherantly found in 95 percent of all  horror offerings.  Yet, when George A Romero's Night of the Living Dead  became an unimaginable horror movie milestone back in 1969. Heads began to  roll both in awe and in complete disgust of this overwhelmingly bleak black  and white cheaply made account of a zombie apocalypse taking place in rural  Pennslyvania. The film's low budget in fact enhanced the film dreary  surrealistic intensity which re-defined the horror genre the same way  Hitchcock's Psycho had done nine years earlier.  Dawn of the Dead was  Romero's official sequal to that movie masterpiece, and he did have some  very large expectations to live up to.  Filmed in 1978, the film takes  the anxieties and paranoia about human transgressions, materialism,  self-preservation, and greed and builds upon these fine foundations. Then  Romero craftily created an awe inspiring cinematic orgy of gore, gunfire,  entrails, decapitations, body explosions galore, make-up special effects,  human disenbowelment, and an un-godly display of stage blood to create the  70's ultimate movie gore fest, and now Romero was filming his canvas in  color!  Suprisingly beyond this seemingly intolerable barage of gore,  Romero had create a tour de force presentation of how brutal huanity is  willing to extend itself for self-preservation.  The un-believable reality  that Romero had fabricated such a remarkable amount of intelligent critical  analysis upon the the American Commercial or Materialstic culture through  the forum of a horror movie is the greatest shock of them all.  If you  can handle this unbelieveable gore attack upon your senses you will find an  unapprecated horror film masterpiece that deserves to be cherished. Dawn's  philosophical, religious, and moral implicatons  are just as thrillingly  enjoyable as all the film's other more obvious contents. Dawn of the Dead  is the ultimate artistic intellectual horror film that mightbe more real  than you can handle. P.S. Watch through thecredits.",947289600,2,2197,5.364705882352941
818456,4,6304240554,"George A. Romero's first follow-up to his classic Night of the Living Dead is both suspenseful and funny, as we follow four heavily armed refugees who seek shelter above a shopping mall as hordes of zombies close in on them.  Once they've found relative security on top of the mall, they decide  there's no place better than where they're at, so they go shopping!  What  the hell, they need lighter fluid anyway, right?  So they go charging  through the mall, knocking off zombie after zombie in graphic fashion.  Sooner or later, you know they will have to pay a price for this type of  greed, but you never know when one of the humans is gonna get it, and it  gets quite claustrophobic as you wait for the inevitable to occur.  Watch  the zombie body count rise in often new and creative ways; this movie  always makes me laugh!  Not for the squeamish, however.",945993600,,863,4.525974025974026

A horror movie like this that goes beyond the graphic violence  (don't get me wrong though, there is plenty) and actually gets the viewer  in to the story is one in a million.  You care for the characters, you want  them to survive.  You become attatched to this movie, which is why it's so  great.

818547,5,6304240554,"This coming from a tough critic. DAWN OF THE DEAD is an epic horror, and no other zombie film in exisitence, or ANY horror film has been able to out-do this masterpiece.
This film in Romero's dead trilogy takes place a  few weeks after Night of the Living Dead. Society is going to hell...people  are rioting, killing each other, and destroying everything...and isn't that  funny? Most of the problems are not caused by the zombies THEMSELVES...but  by the humans. A very accurate statement on the human race. However, a TV  traffic reporter decides that he and his girlfriend, along with a couple of  SWAT officers, should ""borrow"" the station helicopter and get the  hell out of Dodge. They do so, and find themselves landing on a large  shopping mall after a series of close calls. The longer they hole up in the  mall, however, the more they become ambitious. They then decide to take  over the mall, and shut out the dead....they live in a paradise that  quickly eats them away...but they have a trouble headed towards them worse  than any zombies.
This movie has it all, awesome music by GOBLIN,  adventure, action, horror, and comedy. You really love the characters, who  develop quite nicely throughout the movie. In my humble opinion, this film  has one of (if not the best) endings in horror history. No, don't expect  any twists...it's just one of the best, and represents a sour victory  perfectly.

818613,5,6304240554,"Well done to Anchor Bay for this latest release that presents the Zombie Masters' classic on a single side of a DVD (though more would have been nice!!).  The film has never looked or sounded better.  A minor gripe - in  the early SWOT team raid, skin colours did tend to merge with the green of  the tear gas, making even the police occasionally look like zombies!
Over  hear in England, I was first introduced to this ground breaking horror  movie as Zombies: Dawn of the Dead - and therefore saw the Dario Argento  (slightly shorter) cut.  Recently though, the wonderful BBC broadcast the  'US Cinema cut' - apparently unmolested.  This edition of the DVD also  purports to be the US Cinema cut but I did notice some differences -  noteably, the clear-up scene in the basement of the 'projects' building and  the biker attack on the mall.  The BBC cut showed our hero popping bullets  through the sheet covered heads of several bodies in the basement, then  lots of sniper rifle close ups of heads going pop in the biker attack.  These 'gory' extras seemed missing on the DVD.  Does anybody know the score  on these differences??
Another gripe is with the extras on this disk -  it's good to see the Dario Argento 'talking' scenes, but what about the  extra gore scenes they actually mention in the on screen text??  The  slapstick gore is what makes this movie stand out and extras on this front  are surely what the majority want to see?  The mall advert is intesting for  about as long as it's duration (a minute) and there's no supplemental  behind the scenes footage.  What about an interview with the filmaker?  Or  one with Argento on why the differences for Europe?  And who hasn't  wondered 'where are they now?' about their favourite cast member - ideal  fodder for an anniversary extra!?!

Two SWAT team members and two employees from a TV station are living during a nightmarish zombie apocalypse. They find food and shelter in a shopping mall. They even turn the shopping mall into their new home. Zack Synder directed a remake in 2004. The violence in Dawn of the Dead is shocking and extreme. A head gets blown off by a shotgun, zombie children get shot with bullets, a biker is eaten alive by zombies, etc. There are more light-hearted moments such as zombies getting hit by cream pies or zombies losing their balance on an escalator. Tom Savini not only did the special effects for the film, but he plays one of the bikers in the film. There's themes of greed and consumerism in the story. The Italian film Zombie(1979) was hyped as a sequel to this film. The Italian and Japanese versions of Dawn of the Dead were recut to add/delete material. There's also a creepy music score by Goblin.

7865525,5,6304240554,"I know how much everybody here HATES horror, so certainly this will fall upon deaf ears and a repulsed crowd, but...

...this is my jam...

...so shazam.

I've been watching ALL THE DISCS in this set and loving it very much. I'm digging on the final DVD which includes two feature-length making-of and interview documentaries. It's kind of amazing how similar things I'm seeing here are to things I've seen on other sets, ways in which they've tried to make things work, methods used to juice things up.

The thing I'm saving for last is watching Dario Argento's cut. And then I will slide the box back onto my media shelves with a soft ""thank you"" whispered.

I can't recommend it enough.

Worth the price.",1512691200,,707,4.616
