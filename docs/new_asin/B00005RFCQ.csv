7952298,1,B00005RFCQ,"The only reason this video gets 1 star from me is because 0 stars is not an option.  This was absolutely the worst video my now 14 month old has ever seen and very possibly the cheesiest and stupidest thing I have ever witnessed in my 27 years.  A terrible imitation of the very clever Baby Einstein series. Don't waste your money (or more imporantly, TIME) on this product.",1135036800,,374,4.405797101449275
7952299,1,B00005RFCQ,"This video starts with a tower of chocolate truffles. Then once you think they might be moving on to something healthy (apples), they cover them in chocolate and M&Ms. They try to pass it off as teaching good health (they go through the food pyramid), but most of the food they show is candy and desserts. Chocolate covered pretzels, jordan almonds, gum drops. Even for the veggies, they choose cheese-laden onion soup, chicken pot pie with a couple of green beans sticking out, and sweet potato flan. They move on to cheese (macaroni & cheese). They feed their dogs what looks like chocolate cookies (which can kill a dog). None of this makes sense to be showing to kids.

Admittedly, it isn't ALL bad food. They squeeze oranges and pomegranates to make juice, and a couple of other healthy things. But overall, this video is worse than a McDonald's advertisement.  At least McDonald's has good production values.",1106179200,3,914,4.8152866242038215
7952300,4,B00005RFCQ,"They say that imitation is the highest form of flattery - well this video series is a very close immitation of Julie Aigner-Clarke's 'Baby Einstein' video series (Disney).  Same theme (although with food), and music, etc.
Both my 16 month old son, and 2 1/2 year old daughter love the video and will watch transfixed for the full length.  My son especially loves 'Chef Beary Good'.
We have managed to introduce some new foods to our kids, because they had seen them on these videos.",1059350400,,482,4.658823529411765
