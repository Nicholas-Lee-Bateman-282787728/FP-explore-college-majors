5086986,5,B007HMFJMI,"We went to the Orlando Sea World twice in February.  We LOVED LOVED LOVED this show! We were sad at the time because no DVD was available.  I was happy when I just recently found this.  It arrived quickly, and we watched the show.  It was just like the show that is done in Orlando, but it was filmed in San Diego (I think).  The description should say that I think .....",1342483200,,371,4.097222222222222

8516724,5,B007HMFJMI,"Wonderful & entertaining , such a awesome view of these majestic  creatures.  Many mixed emotions though due to these animals being kept
out of their  environment as God intended them to live in the vast oceans,  not in smaller, restricted areas of captivity.  I had hunted for this
discontinued dvd for some time & was thrilled to find it.",1424908800,,340,4.694915254237288

8516727,1,B007HMFJMI,The music is absolutely atrocious. How the animals put up with it I have no idea. I think people should watch Blackfish before they buy this.,1394668800,,141,4.461538461538462
8516728,1,B007HMFJMI,"SeaWorld claims to be a venue of education, but it is really exploiting animals for money.  They will even give false information about orcas, such as claiming they only live to be about 25 to 35 years old, when in reality, they can live to be 100. They do this because all their whales die young. They also do this with the floppy dorsal fin, by saying that it happens with wild whales too. It does, but only in 1%. In captive orcas, it happens in 100% of the males. It claims to inspire people to care about marine life by getting them to perform demeaning tricks. A lot of people I know who are working to stop the dolphin slaughter in Japan have never seen a captive or wild dolphin, yet they still care. What SeaWorld will not tell you is not a single one of their orcas has ever died of old age, and they die at half the age a wild orca does, same with the  dolphins.
Do you know how SeaWorld convinces their animals to perform tricks? They hold back food to keep them hungry.
There is no record of an orca harming a human in the wild, but at least four have been killed by captive orcas, three by the same one. Tilikum has been implicated in the deaths of three people from 1991 to 2010. He had already killed once when SeaWorld bought him.

Orcas at SeaWorld routinely must have their teeth drilled because they are always biting on the metal bars. There is a lot of aggression among the whales, likely induced by stress. Sometimes, this aggression has been fatal.

Whales and dolphins cannot even use their sonar in captivity, as it just bounces off the concrete walls.

Furthermore, the methods of acquiring marine animals for the captivity trade are extremely cruel. Up until a few years ago, SeaWorld got their dolphins from Japan, where the dolphins are rounded up and the more desirable ones are taken into the captivity industry, and the rest are stabbed to death. A live dolphin will earn the fishermen more than the meat will, so the aquarium trade is heavily subsidizing the slaughter. It is extremely devastating for dolphins to watch their family members taken away. In fact, their bonds are so strong that the fishermen intentionally wound a few members of the pod, as dolphins never abandon wounded family members. When being taken into captivity, mothers and babies cry out in distress as they are separated.

Orcas fare no better. Bombs, nets and boats are used to herd a pod into a cove where they are all trapped, and the babies are taken. Orcas have very, very strong family bonds. Even when the nets are removed, the rest of the family will not leave the trapped babies. They will even try to follow the boat that takes them away. They are likely never to get over this tragedy, as they have excellent long-term memories.

SeaWorld also routinely separates mothers and babies.

Captivity simply does not work for marine mammals. Those tanks may look large to us, but they are the size of a bathtub to them. SeaWorld says that they are fed, and therefore have no need for space. I ask this: if someone put you in a cage, with nothing for you to do but perform stupid tricks meaningless to you, but fed you regularly, would that be enough?

When researchers did an MRI on an orca brain, they were astonished. they actually have a part of the brain that humans don't. They found an extension of the limbic system, the part of the brain responsible for emotions. Dolphins have this too. These are intelligent, extremely emotional animals. Their emotions may even be more vivid than a human's. We have no right to put them in a small jail cell for our own amusement and financial gain, and make no mistake, that is why it is done.

8516729,5,B007HMFJMI,We had gone to Sea World and this DVD was a great addition to enjoy our memories again!  Would suggest it!,1371427200,2,106,4.0476190476190474
8516730,4,B007HMFJMI,I bought this for my grandson who loves Sea World.  He watches it all the time.  He can't wait to go back to Sea World.,1369008000,2,119,3.72
8516731,3,B007HMFJMI,"This DVD is different from the original ONE OCEAN show.  I saw it live at the seaworld in San Antonio,Texas.  This was shown in an open stadium, but when I saw it, it was not.  I bought this to relive the memory of what I saw.  It didn't help me do that though.  I still have to say that the pictures were nice, but it wasn't worth the price.  It also wasn't worth the time.",1367107200,2,374,3.92
