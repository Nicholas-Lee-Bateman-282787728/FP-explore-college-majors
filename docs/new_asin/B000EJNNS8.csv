8110675,5,B000EJNNS8,"(This movie was not based on the Nathaniel Hawthorne novel; it just simply has the same title.) Gi-hoon (Han Seok-gyu) is a decorated police detective who's having an affair with nightclub singer Ga-hee (the late Lee Eun-ju), who also happens to be his pregnant wife's college friend. While maintaining the relationship with his wife Su-hyeon (Uhm Ji-won) and his mistress, hes assigned to investigate the murder of a photo studio owner, in which he becomes intrigued with the prime suspect; the victim's wife, Kyeong-hee (Seong Hyeon-ah). Despite the movie's poster, this (unfortunately) doesn't turn into a four-way love affair. The murder investigation is a subplot that does not intertwine with the detective's personal triangle.

All three of the female stars bring a distinctive sexiness to their characters and shine in their own way here. Ga-hee's sultry appeal provides a contrast to the more reserved Su-hyeon, who we later find out, is no stranger to tasting forbidden fruit. Kyeong-hee is subtly seductive and an amateur shutterbug customer's obsession with her causes Gi-hoon to look at him as a suspect in her husband's murder.

In this reviewer's opinion, Seong Hyeon-ah is one of the most underrated actresses in Korea and she could have winningly played any of the three main female characters in this film, but shes better suited for the pursued rather than the pursuer. Check out Cello (2005), The Intimate (2005), and Time (2006) to see some of her other notable performances.

The movie's soundtrack is also a winner. It features a cover of the Corrs' ""Only When I Sleep,"" which is a hot, bluesy number hauntingly performed by Lee, despite her slight mispronunciation of the English lyrics. In fact, that makes the song sound even sexier. She probably could have branched out to a singing career, had she lived.

This was Lee Eun-ju's last role and it's believed that the racy scenes she did for this movie gave her cause for regret, which was one of the reasons she took her own life in February of 2005. I won't reveal the ending of this film, but it's darkly ironic.",1441756800,,2090,4.962857142857143
8110676,5,B000EJNNS8,I watched this movie a few years ago then saw it again recently and I must say I found it very enjoyable.  The acting was good and the pacing was adequate.  As the film went on things withheld fron the viewer were slowly revealed so the viewer could completely understand how the characters ended up in the situations they did.  The ending is very sad but fitting.,1182384000,2,364,4.402985074626866
8110677,5,B000EJNNS8,If you can't find this movie anywhere else then I suggest that you go to [...] it will only cost $9.99. This movie is one of the best Korean films I have ever seen. It's on my top ten list. The film really is a love affair story even though they make it look like a murder movie by the ad box. But In her last film to apear (before her untimely death)Lee eun-ju give a performance so good it's Oscar worthy. Believe me see this film it will not dissapoint you.,1168300800,3,460,4.010869565217392
