Also to think that Bush, who could not complete a full sentence, had anything to do with the twin towers collapse, he was too busy playing golf according to Michael Moore,  is a laugh.  I watched a video clip where the creators of this piece of trash were up against the editors of Popular Mechanics magazine. The two young men of ""Loose Change"" resorted to yelling and calling the two PM men liars and were visibly angry.  In the mean time the two PM men kept saying that ""...according to the experts..."" in whatever related field they were discussing in the video, absolutley debunked the Loose Change boys.  It goes back to that simple theory of how do you disprove a negative.  The PM men did their job.  Anyone, like the 2 buffoons of loose change, can make a claim of a conspiracy. And as it so appears to profit from it.",1238976000,,926,4.405882352941177
8181763,5,B000NVLGO0,"Seven years later, and Amazon is awash in material about 9/11...and a good portion of it is now shameful output about conspiracies.

This video is available in YouTube segments, so not sure the value in spending money on a show about what probably shouldn't exist.  This is a public access show, and these episodes feature the makers of the 'documentary' film 'Loose Change' (and its numerous remakes and recuts and final edition super director's producer cuts).  Alongside them is Mark Roberts, who is like an encyclopedia about the events and the timeline and has very carefully shredded the entire film, and its sequels, on his own site.  Line by line...literally.  What's amazing is his calm as he corrects the filmmakers and their assertions, which are random, wild, and have been debunked, though they just haven't heard about it yet.  Over and over they hear about evidence that was released...that they never saw.  I mean, maybe they just weren't on the right 9/11 evidence mailgroups or something.  That's okay, they'll just go make a fourth or fifth version of the film, like a bad term paper draft that countless other students actually read.

The guy blows these kids up on TV, and they hardly have a response.  Every point they bring up is refuted with facts, and this is answered with, 'Well, I disagree, because a) it's just too much coinky-dink, b) they didn't see the evidence (because naturally they have seen all the evidence, or c) cynical reasons of just continuing to lie to advance their ridiculous pet conspiracy project and the profit off a few thousand dead people.

This is a good series to watch a factoid blow apart the bulk of the 9/11 conspiracies.  At one point, after one of their 'a-ha!' moments is met with another explanation of what did happen, the host steps in and asks the guys if they'd like to change their mind (in order to avoid further embarassment).  But they plow on, though one guy does most of the talking, digging himself a deeper hole.  They just get told 'you're wrong', and then why...and it's no wonder they won't appear again.  A frat boy doesn't believe that Al Qaeda committed these crimes...why?  Why not?  He never says why.  Then the guy tells them...they did  Because they planned, and left a paper trail.  But the intrepid truthseekers will not back down.  Did I mention that the original inspiration for their film(s) was a fiction story about two people discovering that 9/11 WAS a conspiracy?  Is this entire thing a long, awful, and degrading episode of The Truman Show of which 300 million Americans are cast members?",1221091200,2,2584,4.798642533936651
8181764,5,B000NVLGO0,"I watched this debate online and as far as 9/11 conspiracy debates go, this one is a classic.

Dylan Avery and Jason Bermas (makers of a film on 9/11 conspiracy theories) square off against Mark Roberts (skeptic and NYC tour guide). The resulting exchanges only leave the viewer wanting more.

Avery seemed somewhat un-prepared for this debate, and his direct admission that he knows his film contains errors was certainly a surprise to see.  Bermas did most of the talking on the conspiracy side, but it was clear that he was still in over his head.

The host, Ron Weick, stepped in to the debate a little more than one would hope (for someone acting as the host), though his questions and statements were interesting.

Mark Roberts was well-prepared.  His wide knowledge of the events and theories surrounding 9/11 were clearly evident in his responses.

This is a MUST WATCH for anyone who has any questions about the official story of 9/11 or is curious about the conspiracy theories surrounding the events of that day.

I would love to see the 3 go back for a rematch, but I'm told that Dylan & co. refuse to do so.  After viewing this debate, I can certainly see why.",1199836800,3,1173,4.628019323671498
8181765,5,B000NVLGO0,"I have watched all three editions of ""Loose Change"" regarding the many contradictions in the official story of 9/11.  I firmly believe that 9/11 was allowed to happen by rogue elements in the U.S. government and military.  To date, the FBI does not name Osama bin Laden as the person behind 9/11 because they still say they have ""NO HARD EVIDENCE THAT BIN LADEN DID IT."" You can check this out on the FBI Most Wanted website.  The 9/11 Commission Report is full of lies and omissions and it doesn't even mention Able Danger or the collapse of WTC building 7.  Not even mentioned!
  I highly recommend anything produced by these filmmakers.",1195948800,6,639,4.660714285714286
8181766,1,B000NVLGO0,"Funny thing about the 5 star review by Gary Popkin - I just watched this whole thing on YouTube and what should I read at the end? ""Produced and directed by Gary Popkin"". I suppose it's good to believe in one's own work....

It would still be ridiculous to charge $20 for this even if it wasn't available for free. The production values are very basic and the moderator doesn't manage to control the discussion tightly enough (though admittedly he tries) to get the Loose Change guys to answer the evidence they are presented with.

If the subject interest you, though, it's worth watching on YouTube: Mark Roberts continually tries to ground the discussion in actual facts and it is fascinating to see how little Dylan Avery and Jason Bermas (LC creators) are willing or able to engage with those facts.",1186704000,7,804,4.695035460992908
8181767,5,B000NVLGO0,"Were explosives used to bring down the World Trade towers and building number 7 on September 11, 2001? Did a plane crash in Pennsylvania? Did a missle hit the Pentagon? Was 9/11 a ""false-flag"" operation, an inside job? Hear all sides of the argument in these two editions of the weekly political TV talk show Hardfire, as two of the creators of Loose Change, Jason Dermas and Dylan Avery, debate Mark Roberts, a leading 9/11 debunker.
