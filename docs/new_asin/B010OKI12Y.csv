7315301,3,B010OKI12Y,"Ok, so to preface this I want to note that the three star is for the presentation of the movie on the disc. The movie looks good, but it isn't all that old anyway, so it wasn't like they restored it from some old negatives. There are no special features besides the trailer, which looks thrown together and doesn't really realistically portray what the film is. It isn't a great package for the movie, but its the only way to see it and it isn't terrible.

NOW SPOILERS

The film itself, I am conflicted with. While the basic premise, acting, and cinematography are pretty great and the effects are okay, the film falls flat on whatever story they were trying to tell. It was the most disappointing part of the film for me. The film sets up its basic premise in the first half hour were a group of five people, two women and three men, are heading to a remote location for a supposed rave. When they get to the location, the two woman find out that the three men have brought them there to rape and torture them. Now this is a big thing that isn't really clear unless you dive into the reviews of the movie, but it is very misogynistic and not pleasant to watch. Worst of all, it serves no purpose. The director stated that the violence towards the women in the film was meant to comment on the fact that this is happening all the time, pointing to a cut where while raping the women they flash to one of there friends violating a women with a mouse, but instead of focusing on this supposed and doing a homage to say, Last House on the Left, I Spit on Your Grave, or any formulaic rape/revenge flick the story takes a huge 180, once the women escape, and guess what, now all of them are being attacked by undead gladiators for no reason but that they stumbled on where they were. Now it's pretty awesome seeing the rapists get theirs, and if the film had ended with both or one of the women getting away, it would have worked, but the combination of the grotesque torture, rape, and undead gladiators then just killing them, because they are in there ""territory"" doesn't really work. Had they done something in which the gladiators stood for retribution and just killed the rapists or include something where they were trying to appease the female god they worship it would have worked so well and the message wouldn't have gotten buried. There is some sort of profound message about the state of male/female relations in this movie buried in the misogyny, but I couldn't find it. Overall it is very mean spirited and very hard to watch, there is no sense of retribution, just death and violence, but if that is your thing well this is the movie for you.",1442102400,4,2655,4.416326530612245
8722850,4,B010OKI12Y,"Firstly this is not a film for the average horror fan. This movie is geared towards the hardcore fan. The one that especially likes the Italian horror films of old, Grindhouse and your basic exploitation film.

If you enjoy old school horror films like Fulici's The Ripper, Wes Craven's Last House on the Left, The Blind Dead, and Island of Death just to name a few, you will probably like this movie.

Forget political correctness of 2017 and put yourself in the obscure exploitation films of the 70s and early 80s, and you will get this film. It is clearly a throw back to those particular movies of that era.

The best way I can describe this film is a combination of the original The Last House on the Left and the Blind Dead. Which I happen to be a fan of both. I feel some of the negative reviewers are missing the point of this piece.

Yes there is nothing really original about this movie. It borrows from films that came long before it but I feel it's a tribute to a specific era of horror film making that seems to have been long forgotten, which could be a good thing or bad thing depending on your view and taste in horror film making. I feel that it is good that there are horror films like this is being made because a lot of modern horror films are too safe and dare I say family friendly. So for me Morituris is refreshing and takes me back to an era of horror films that separated the men from the boys when it came to things truly horrific.

Keep in mind a lot of films of this kind that were made in this style back in the day are still a lot more graphic than this movie. It's by far not the most shocking movie I've seen. But it still dabbles in that same material, Rape, Torture, and obviously gore.",1499040000,,1721,4.218844984802431
8722851,2,B010OKI12Y,"I think if the budget was bigger and some plot changes within the script they could of made a decent ""gladiators of the dead"" to the rescue film.  But, ugh.  Just endless and over the top scenes of brutality toward the women and tons of screaming by the male attackers.  The gladiators looked ridiculous, again it was probably due to budget restraints.  I think Chris Alexander from FANGORIA Magazine either got paid to say the positive things in his review or he was really high while watching the movie.  This in NO way reminds you of a Fulci movie.  Two stars for the concept but it did not deliver.",1479600000,,602,4.477064220183486
8722852,1,B010OKI12Y,"My review in two parts.  One stream of thought about 60 min in, the other at the end.

Pars Prima (Part One)

Boy do some movies disappoint me. I was promised zombie gladiators. I sat through 60 min of crappy euro torture-pr0n to finally get the zombie gladiators. And so far the 'zombieness' is covering them in grey dust. You got 30 min to give me real zombie gladiators or else... I'll conjugate Latin at you!

Caesar si lemuret, ad remum dareris! (If Caesar was a zombie, you'd be chained to an oar) (Yes, that's my best attempt at Latinizing 'to be a zombie' I think Virgil would be proud)

Pars Seconda (Part Two)

Oh. My. Jupiter.  Maximus.  Avoid ""Morituris: Legion of the Dead"" like the grey flour coated, b-roll team from Spartacus, eurosleaze nightmare it is. 0 out of 5 gladius wielding zombies, and I think I'll refrain from ever showing it to another living being, because I'm that much of a humanitarian",1461283200,,918,4.554878048780488
8722853,2,B010OKI12Y,"On the surface, a movie that melds the trappings of rape/revenge and horror/gore genres would seem to be a solid buy for aficionados of exploitation cinema. But after unleashing some fever-pitched sexual violence, Morituris falls flat on its metal-masked face.

The plot is appropriately linear  three guys lure a couple of young women into the woods under the ruse of going to a rave and suddenly reveal themselves to be ferociously sadistic bastards. Theres some ruins nearby that are haunted by zombie-ish gladiators who hunt the bastards as well as their female victims.

All that stuff is preceded by long interludes that take place inside a car, where the guys and the women do a lot of conversing. As grueling as the subsequent rape sequences are, the banal scenes inside the car are even harder to watch. But the boredom and hyper-intense sexual torture eventually give way to the entrance of the gladiators. And one thing Morituris has going for it is that unlike many of the horror and rape/revenge films its influenced by, theres no sense of justice, theres just tiers of evil.

But therein lies a fundamental problem. The gladiators are sluggish and bland, and don't generate much nihilistic excitement. Looking like masked football players dipped in flour, they lack the dark energy needed to drive the movies theme. Similarly, the gore effects are mostly fleeting and unambitious. In a different sort of movie these brief and clichd gore scenes might have worked well, but here they're upstaged by the deplorably cruel rapes. So by the end, I was left thinking that Id just seen yet another swaggering horror movie that slouched when it came to gore.

There are some positives: The blu-ray looks and sounds great, theres some cool music, terrific opening credits animation and visually impressive nighttime cinematography. But for a movie that strives to depict savagery, and whose title graphic is fashioned after death metal band logos, Morituris fails to slay.",1450915200,2,1977,5.052147239263804
8722854,4,B010OKI12Y,"Italian splatter porn?  (well, soft porn) in the style of Lucio Fulci.  Two young Romanian women accompany three lusty Italian men to a ""rave"" in the woods...  drugs and alcohol abound.  I see a thousand red flags waving but the girls don't!  Must be a language barrier.
Only when the men start to rape and abuse the young lovelies in the deep forest does the film take an acute turn toward the paranormal as muscular zombie gladiators materialize out of nowhere and take the film to a higher level... lower level?  You decide if you have the stomach for it.  ""HIC SUNT LEONES""",1447372800,,577,4.543689320388349
8722855,2,B010OKI12Y,"Incredibly mean-spirited, but not in the ""fun-horror-movie"" way.  Lots of violent sexual abuse abounds, as three ignorant clods take advantage of two naive foreign tourist girls on a road trip, and all five of the subsequently come under attack by clanking, shuffling, undead Roman gladiators.  If the gladiators had dished out some more impressive action in the finale (and they really are only a presence in the final act of the film)  it may have been more worthwhile, but all of the ugly, vicious misogyny that we are served up throughout the rest of the film makes the finale pale by comparison.  It looks & sounds pretty good for what is obviously a lesser,  haphazard rookie production, but aside from that, I found it overall to be an unsatisfying exercise on bleakness with no real payoff.  Nothing but a trailer for special features, really no substance here to justify a purchase.  I bought it so you wouldn't have to.  : )",1447027200,6,934,4.75776397515528
8722856,1,B010OKI12Y,"Terrible and untalented film-making.

An interesting opening scene, followed by half a movie of sheer mind-numbing boredom, next some gratuitous violence.  By the time the Legionnaire zombies arrive, nobody cares anymore and the practical effects are practically invisible in the dark.

The final scene is the best part of the whole film.  In fact, I get the sense that these guys had one idea for that one scene and then worked backwards:  ""gee, we need a movie leading up to this great ending"".

Not even alcohol can make this bearable.  Watch cat videos on YouTube instead.",1443571200,,576,4.9375
8722857,4,B010OKI12Y,"Morituris harks back to the halcyon days of spaghetti splatter which is reassuring to see . A fusion of Tombs of the Blind Dead/Night of the Seagulls, I Spit on Your Grave (and rape and revenge exploitation of this ilk) and Demons which in my humblest opinion works extremely well. I feel there could have been more gravitas to the plot as the emphasis is on mainly a catalogue of cruelty however the way in which this is executed has been achieved with much gusto. I feel the zombie genre has now run it's course but this looked at it with fresh eyes by giving the dead an identity as de Ossorio did with the Templars. I enjoyed the nhilistic vein than ran throughout and clearly understood the repugnant aspect of humanity the director was trying to highlight and in a way the lumbering, cadavered beefcakes were the anti-heroes in a sea of misogynistic machismo. Although I feel some reprieve should have been given to one of the woman however the director wasn't trying to emulate the saccharine happy ending of American horror which is commonplace and taken as given nowaday . The cinematography is exceptional as well as the soundtrack which feature the wheezing, rasps of the gladiators reminsicent of the sound of the dead featured in Graus 'Living Dead at the Manchester Morgue'. The music used at the beginning is also a highlight and accompany the visuals perfectly as grisly animation detail a gladiators life and demonstrates why they are the killing machines in life as in resurrected death. The acting, especially of the two female protagonists also needs highlighting - their sheer terror conveyed in the nightmare journey they endure was perfect and very credible. One can see this in the scene where the two females meet up after their violations and cradle one another. The poor woman who was attacked by her scissor happy abductor displayed delirium induced fear superbly. It was also refreshing to see women represented in a more vulnerable way which enhanced credibility. It was a breath of fresh air not to see a female 'token' rambo too commonplace in modern horror and quite frankly a bore as it has been done to death and the director is obviously not interested in oppeasing the scourge that are the politically correct.  The abhorrent male lead characters were also convincing in terms of their stages of contrast from friendly and fun to angst ridden and maniacal to cowardly messes ; and nothing gave me more delight in seeing their comeuppance. I found Morituris, although borrowing heavily from zombie and exploitation genre that had gone before it , a smashing opus of gruel, although just a little more meat on the bone (excuse the pun) in terms of plot would have been an advantage (hence why my rating just stops short of 5 out of 5). I am hoping more of the mystery of the gladiators will be revealed in a sequel - I hope it will be just as gruesome too. One thing I would imagine is that Fulci would be very pleased !",1443571200,2,2955,4.69364161849711
8722858,2,B010OKI12Y,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

So if there were two ways to judge a movie, one by content and the other by production value, then Id have to start this review by saying that production wise this movie is sufficient but offers nothing outstanding. The effects are decent enough but nothing notable that hasn't been seen or done before. As for the cinematography the same holds true with decent enough filming going on and night time sequences that we are at least able to see. Thats about it production wise.

As for story and the like, not my cup of tea. I know there will probably be many out there who enjoy this sort of film but for me random acts of violence, especially against women in todays world. I could say another aspect of this that I disliked but to do so would involve a major spoiler. Suffice to say that I found little to enjoy from start to finish in this movie.

The story involves two Romanian girls who are riding along with three young Italian men in Italy on their way to a rave in the country. The girls don't know the guys having just met but are game for a party to go wild at. Along the way they drink, get stoned and talk back and forth having problems understanding certain phrases, but seem to be having a good time. One of the men calls a friend back in the city to make sure they had the right directions. He confirms this while answering the door to admit a prostitute to his place.

Eventually (and it takes some time) they arrive at their destination. They can hear no music and the guys cell phone isn't working so he borrows the girls phone to make another phone call. He tells the girls that they're the first to arrive and others will show soon and they continue walking into the woods. This is one of those moments where you're supposed to suspend belief and assume that two young girls from a foreign country are nave enough to trust these guys in the woods at night with no music from a rave they are supposed to be going to.

Eventually they find a clearing and sit down to wait, still drinking and smoking. At one point during their walk they came across a stone tablet in a wall that had writing on it, but no one could decipher what it said. Sitting around the first theyve built they mention it to the only member of the group who can decipher Latin but forget about it quickly.

Things take a turn for the worse when one of the guys takes one of the girls into the woods for what we would think is flirting but instead becomes a brutal oral rape sequence. Back at the fire the other two guys grab the remaining girl and start their own rape there leaving her helpless and naked as they each take a turn. Whether this is supposed to be a homage to films like LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT or I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE I have no idea, but it is an entirely repulsive thing to watch. Ive yet to understand how some consider this either art of entertainment.

While all of this is going on an eerie smoke rises around the area and suddenly we have a group of gray skinned gladiators show up. Apparently the inscription said something about an area of the damned and these are the ghosts who protect the area. They don't take sides either, attacking both male and female members of the group. If you want to know who survives or doesnt youll have to watch. I will say that doing so would be a waste of time and effort.

As I said from the start, Ive never been a fan of the whole torture porn horror genre and this does nothing to make me change my mind. There have been efforts in the genre that at least present something interesting or different (AUDITION) but for the most part it is nothing more than gore for the sake of gore or degradation for the sake of degradation. In a world where complaints are made daily about misogynistic comments or attitudes to witness the treatment of women in this movie makes me wonder why those who are so up in arms about an innocent comment aren't creating protest movements about films like this.

The extras on here are nearly non-existent. The movie was originally made in 2011 but is just now making its way to blu-ray release. For me this is too soon. I understand the importance of releasing movies on blu-ray format, of trying to retain films and keep them alive as a historical record of movies being made, but something like this doesnt seem worth the effort. If what you enjoy is seeing women debased and beaten then hey, this movie is right up your alley. For the rest of us it is one to steer clear of.",1443484800,,4511,4.303886925795053
8722859,3,B010OKI12Y,"This is a hard film to try & rate because I know its only going to be enjoyed by a very specific crowd. Now if you enjoy films like I Spit on Your Grave & Last House on the Left or films with some heavy gore then this might be up your alley. What happens to the woman in this film is very brutal & may be hard to watch for some or put some people off altogether if you aren't used to or like that sort of thing. Once the killing starts there is no mercy shown towards anyone. The basic premise is 2 young woman are attacked by 3 men, then happen to be in the woods where undead roman gladiators live. Where they came from or why they're there is never fully explained at all. There is a pretty cool opening animated sequence though which I enjoyed. Go into this one very carefully, watch trailers & read a few reviews to see if this movie will really be for you or not.",1443225600,,869,3.9714285714285715
