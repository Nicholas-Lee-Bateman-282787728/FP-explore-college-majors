8390312,5,B00005TNWV,"This is a really great workout. It starts out with Tai Chi and adds Kick boxing along the way. You can either do a light work out with alot of relaxing moves or a vigorous workout. I really love this video and the teachers do a great job of helping you learn all the moves you need to know. Before you know it, you're feeling much better and confident. You even feel like you can protect yourself if needed and that is always a great bonus. If you want to have fun and get your body in shape, then buy this video..",1328140800,,514,4.049019607843137
