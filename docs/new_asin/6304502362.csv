892801,4,6304502362,"Almost every guy in the world will be able to relate to this movie.  No, most mothers won't be as exaggerated and ridiculous as the character Debbie Reynolds plays in this hilarious Albert Brooks comedy, but the idea is the same; you love your mother, and she loves you, but the little arguments and fights you get into are inevitable as well.  All of these aspects are portrayed in an extremely funny Brooks script.
Brooks continues to be an underrated comic genius, and after seeing movies like this, I'm left wondering why he doesn't have a much bigger following than he does.",1002585600,5,579,4.666666666666667
892802,4,6304502362,"When you first watch this movie, you aren't quite sure what you are going to get. As it slowly reveals itself you find it as funny as it is discomforting.
I think Albert Brooks did a wonderful job with this film. Portraying all the odd little things that happen in our relationships with our respective mothers. We all have those moments where we look at her and can't believe that we were spawned from her loins. The ways that at any age, she can reduce us to about 9 years old and completely humiliate and embarrass the hell out us at a moments notice.
Debbie Reynolds is magnificent as the mother, she has that maniacal sense of motherly perfection that all of our mother's, at the very least, attempt to portray.
Rob Morrow is also hilarious as the jealous younger brother. Every scene between him and Brooks is a laugh riot, because they both seem to regress to their younger days when they would fight over toys and the remote control.
All in all, I think this film is something everyone can relate to on some level. We have all had one or two of these wretchedly embarrassing moments with our mothers, and it is more than likely that they will happen again.",988848000,17,1164,4.469483568075117
892803,4,6304502362,"Albert performs his self-absorbed/deprecating L.A. weasel/writer schtick. The theme song, twisted from a classic, is mighty cute. Many of the gags fail. But Debi Reynolds (Mom) is genuinely interesting, as permitted, & Brooks allows himself a few straighter-than-usual moments, particularly as he discovers/peruses Mom's pre-Mom writings. Brooks is not stupid or sentimental here, makes an appropriate distinction honest vocation & hack career (Dad had it no better than Mom, usually, when we liked Ike? Often worse?) by adding a superficially respectable but finally sad/neurotic ""successful"" younger son/brother to the mix. Mom does NOT necessarily love her baby boy best, though the Albert character IS relentlessly difficult.
""Mother"" doesn't conclude with the full-blown marriage &/or NEAT mother/son reconciliation (considerable confusion about WHO is blocked/frustrated/angry remains, as it should) a more NORMAL high comedy might provide. It ends (before the closing theme spoils the titles) a bit better than that. Won't spoil, but will recommend a good book that treats the real subject of the movie, something about risking (or not) human expression, the spilling of the [family] secrets, with more grace/humor, less nervousness/wit. If you enjoy[ed] ""Mother"" at all & like to read, DO try the funny/sweet/smart novel ""Yo!"" by Julia Alvarez.",988329600,,1352,5.731343283582089
892804,3,6304502362,"a must for Albert Brooks fans and those with ""overbearing""  matriarchs; everyone else will have to settle for the sporadic one-liners  (on the unlikely prospect of his ex-wife fleeing the state: ""She's  divorcing me - she has nothing against the land.""); as mother and son,  Debbie Reynolds and Brooks are adorable together; script won the New York  film critics honor that year.",966470400,5,379,5.048387096774194
892805,2,6304502362,"Albert Brooks is trying to figure out why all of his marriages are failures, and his tentative conclusion is that it is his mother's fault.  Mom, Debbie Reynolds, was always hyper critical of him.  Therefore, he is a  mess with women.  Actually not a bad analysis.  It avoids Freudianism,  which is off in the clouds somewhere as it is, and gets right down to  truth.  If your parents constantly put you on the defensive, it is bound to  unavoidably impact on your later relationships.  Even with this insight, I  didn't like the movie.  The first half is too annoying.  There is too much  bickering between mother and son.  The jokes aren't funny.  How do you make  a movie about an unpleasant topic without annoying people?  Well, Albert  Brooks fell into that trap.  I can't stand all that bickering.  By the end  it got a lot better, as the mother and son started to relate better and  learn about each other.  But that was too late for me.  I can't stand  bickering in real life, and I don't want to be subjected to it in the  movies.",960681600,3,1039,4.446236559139785
892806,3,6304502362,"Albert Brooks, in my opinion, has not made a bad film (a claim that not even Ingmar Bergman can make).  He continues that streak with ""Mother"", a movie you should not miss.  (Note: I have not yet  seen ""The Muse"".)
In all his films, Brooks plays a character  who doesn't quite know himself.  Here, he plays a twice-divorced writer who  questions why his relationships with women never seem to work.  As a bold  experiment he decides to move back in with his mother (played by Debbie  Reynolds) to see if he can find some answers.  The premise is filled with  comic possibilities, and Brooks mines some of them.  There's a giddy  excitement when Brooks tells his disbelieving brother of his plan.  And  there's a terrific scene where he redecorates his room as it existed in the  70's, complete with ""Barbarella"" and Jimi Hendrix posters.
But  the video is not merely silly.  There's a very serious undercurrent as  Brooks finds out why his mom has always seemed more critical of him than  his brother.  And why he has gravitated towards the wrong  women.
""Mother"" is well writter by Brooks and co-writer Monica  Johnson (they shared the Best Screenplay Award from the prestigious New  York Film Critics).  Part of why I think I like this film so much is  mother/son relationships are hardly rare and yet (for some reason) there  doesn't seem to be a lot of films about them.",956275200,,1374,4.663865546218488
892807,5,6304502362,"And Debbie Reynolds is also brilliant.  This movie had my friends and I laughing so hard it almost hurt.  This isn't the first Brooks film to do so.  If you haven't seen Lost in America you are missing a real classic.  His humor is sort of exclusive, I mean some people don't seem to ""get  it"".  But the amount of laughs is almost continuous.",950659200,6,342,4.265625
892808,3,6304502362,"Albert Brooks plays John, a 40-something science fiction writer who decides he will never be able to have a successful relationship with a woman until he figures out his relationship with the first woman in his  life. So he moves into his mother's (Debbie Reynolds) house and  reconstructs his old bedroom. They spend their time gently bickering over  grocery shopping and the strange characters that appear in John's books,  embarrassing each other in front of strangers, and exacerbating the rivalry  between John and his brother. Eventually, he manages to get the beginning  of a realization that Mother is also a person with a life of her own.",914284800,4,647,5.0

892973,4,6304502362,"Debbie Reynolds is great fun - and the situation between the brothers is amusing.  I find Albert Brooks a little boring at times - somewhat whiny even limp.  I wonder if a different actor could have put a little more life into the role.  Rob Morrow, as the brother, was perfect for his part.  I noticed a reviewer who compared Albert Brooks with Woody Allen - and she likes them both.  I'm one of those people who find Woody Allen boring - an energy drainer.  For me he makes his co-stars look dull because his movies are always about him.",1511049600,,539,4.34

893010,4,6304502362,"Great movie. Alert Brooks can be a bit of an acquired taste much like Woody Allen. Many people do not find either funny at all and just consider them whiny Jewish men. I grew up seeing all of Woody's movies in South Florida so I adore him. Mr. Brooks humor is very similar.
The movie is essentially a tale of Albert Brooks' moving back in with his mother (played by a stupendous Debbie Reynolds) to find out why he struggles with relationships. He has a brother that dotes on, and is doted on, by the same mother. By the end Albert finds the source of his angst and gets on with his life.",1502409600,,588,4.212389380530974

He adds such realness to his character and says the things that other's might be thinking. Plus, who can't relate to having ""issues"" with their parent(s)? lol His annoyance with his mom...so, so funny to me! Then there's the brilliant and beautiful Debbie Reynolds. How can anyone not love her? She is adorable in every single movie that I've ever seen her in!  Her humor is just as clever. I just love these two together and I love how they don't seem to relate to each other at first, but, then find a common ground and have mutual respect for one another. I laugh ever time I watch it.

We watched it to see Debbie Reynolds, and hoped Brooks wrote something worth watching. Debbie was good, despite the weak material she had to work with. Albert was - well - Albert. About as funny as a wet sock. There was one line in the entire film we laughed at. It was also the only one that caused us to even smile.

We knew we were in trouble with a typical Brooks script when it starts out with him in a mostly empty living room, trying to decide where the best place was to put a chair. Working clockwise, he kept moving the chair around the room. After the second move (with at least three more after that), the very tedious and overly long scene ended exactly as we both predicted. The chair ended back where it started from. Oh, yes. Ho, ho, ho. That was so funny.

Maybe she has too much furniture, and she's a little vague.  But if you want annoying let me tell you about MY mother.

Annoying is having a mother who sewed little snap-pouches into the waistband of all of her underwear for her money.  Thus, whenever we were traveling and she needed to pay for anything, she'd dive into her pants and root around in there for what seemed like an eternity sorting out small change and singles.

Albert's outrage and irritation is way out of proportion to his mother's little oddities.  My outrage and irritation was in perfect proportion to MY mother's idiosyncrasies.",1473206400,,962,4.882716049382716

893525,5,6304502362,"While the professional critics were all over the place on this, I think its one of Brooks strongest films, along with Lost in America.  Very, very funny in an understated, unforced way, it examines the dynamics of parent/child relationships with surprising depth and even-handedness.  Rather than making the obvious, familiar film about my mother the shrew, Brooks is honest enough to see there are two sides to every relationship, romantic or parental.  And with two sons in the family, that's really three sides.

Debbie Reynolds is indeed the revelation she was acclaimed to be on the film's release.  Wonderfully fun to watch, Reynolds is simultaneously adorable and harsh, funny and sad, sweet and cutting to her son, who is well played by Brooks -- a guy who cant quite seem to get his life together, and wants to blame it all on her.

The strength of the writing is that the film recognizes that some of Brooks characters neurosis IS his mothers fault, but certainly not all of it, nor was it possible for her (or anyone) to be a perfect parent and leave no scars.  And in the end  at least to a point  its up to the kid to grow up and move past it.

(mild spoiler ahead)

The film got a lot of flack for its supposedly overly easy revelation and solution that solves the pairs problems.  But I took that moment as far more satirical than that.  Just because Brooks character would like to believe one piece of insight into his past makes everything all better, I don't feel like the film itself (or even Reynolds character) believes that for a second.  Brooks child-man is still thinking like a kid, still looking for an easy one sentence solution as to why his life is a mess.  While there may be some placebo effect to the now I understand it all idea,  I never felt were meant to think this knotted up mess of a guy would now never have another anxiety attack.",1460937600,2,1871,4.523809523809524

I believe that everyone can relate to the story on some level. The story of this mother is the story of many women who had to give up their dreams and career to raise their children and to build a family. Their resentment towards their children is a permanent conflict with their love for them. The mother was more critical towards the writer son because he was just like her and had her talent and he actually fulfilled his dreams and became a writer. He reminded her of her frustration and the dream she had to give up.

893931,5,6304502362,"Mother, a 1996 film by Albert Brooks, who also stars in this film, is another winner by him. This comedic and dramatic tale about a son moving back in with his mother is a wonderful film from start to finish. It also shows that there are still some great filmmakers in the good old USA. Brooks directed and co-wrote the script with Monica McGowan Johnson(may she rest in peace).

The whole things starts with John Henderson(Brooks), a successful science fiction writer, who is going through his second divorce. He decides to move back in with his mother Beatrice(Debbie Reynolds)and decides to re-occupy the same room that he had when he was a child. John does this in hopes that by repairing the somewhat broken relationship that he had with his mother, he can also have better success with women. Soon, as John is settled in, he starts to make himself at home and helps his mother out whenever she needs it. The only problem is that it is causing some strains in her own personal life, especially where her relationships with other men are concerned. Plus, John can't seem to understand that his mother has since changed her lifestyle around starting from when he initially moved out. Also, he is soon in competition with his brother Jeff(Rob Morrow)for mother's affections as Beatrice is now reliving those days when both of these sons of hers were living in the house when they were still real young. Later on, while doing some checking around, John finds some old writings of hers that she did many years ago and reads them and thinks that they are really great. John soon discovers that this is why he feels that his mother hates him, though he does later learn that he is wrong in this assumption. Of course, his mother doesn't like him going through her personal things and such, but she doesn't really seem too mad about it with him. As usual, I won't give too much away as I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen this wonderful film as of yet.

Mother became Brooks' highest grossing film to date. It made 19.1 million dollars at the box office. Like many of Brooks' previous films, it was also well received by critics. This is Brooks' best film to date. Brooks again really works wonders in front of and behind the camera. Mother is funny, poignant, bittersweet and has a lot of heart and soul. The film is very enjoyable and entertaining from start to finish. Mother is a rare film treat that can be enjoyed again and again without it ever getting dull or too boring. The chemistry between Brooks and Reynolds is really overwhelming and it works on all levels. They do make a wonderful team together as mother and son and that chemistry is what keeps the film alive and kicking.

Originally, Albert Brooks wanted former US First Lady Nancy Reagan to portray the title character and she was contemplating coming out of retirement to portray the title character, but later had to back out as a result of her husband, former USA President Ronald Reagan, being sick and suffering from Alzheimer's Disease. Brooks also offered the role to Kathryn Grayson, but she turned it down thinking that the title character was, in her humble opinion, brain dead. Doris Day was also offered the title role, but she also turned it down. Nancy Reagen recommended her close friend Debbie Reynolds for the role and after Brooks talked with Reynolds' daughter Carrie Fisher, Carrie brought the script to her mother and she agreed to play the role. Debbie Reynolds was nominated for a Golden Globe award for ""Best Performance by an actress in a Motion Picture Comedy/Musical"" but won a Golden Satellite Award for the same category. Mother did win awards for it's script, which were the NFSC and NYFCC Awards respectively.

I watched this film with my mother on Mother's Day 2012 and my mother enjoyed the film very much as much as I did. I advise all of you kids out there to watch this film with your mother any time that you wish. I hope that you and your mother enjoy this film as much as my mother and I did.

Update: My mother died on September 21st, 2012 of cancer. May she always rest in peace. Whenever I decide to watch this film again, it will bring back the wonderful memory we had of her enjoying this movie.

Overall, Mother is Brooks' best film to date and a film that still remains as wonderful no matter how many times that it is watched. It is also a very entertaining film by the one and only Albert Brooks. If you are a fan of Brooks' films like I am, this film should be in your DVD library.

893977,5,6304502362,"For the record, I have always been an Albert Brooks fan.  In fact, I really can't think of a film he's either written, directed, did both, and/or acted in that I haven't either really liked or just outright loved a whole lot.  ""Mother"" is no exception, and in fact, this little known, probably rarely seen work of his, is one of my all time favorites of his as well.  Which is a shame sort of, because this is at times, one of his most accessible endeavors.

I first saw this on cable or rented it as I recall, in the late 90's, after I reluctantly moved back from Los Angeles (Adventureland) to my old hometown (Pittsburghland), to try to help play ""caregiver"" to my own aging mom.  Seeing freshly this glorious but subtle flick several times since on HBO, and quickly burning it to DVD accordingly for future gratifications, having only recently losing my own mother after a nearly decade-long bout with Alzheimer's, my appreciation for this work has only grown.  Albert Brooks has given us many great films over times, but this is among his finest (if lesser known achievements).  For it touches upon universally common experiences and instances almost all of us can relate to, any or most of us who had mothers whom despite all their flaws, we essentially loved unquestionably, and mothers who as well, despite all of our own flaws, loved us as well, virtually unconditionally.

While the characters dealt with here I find hard to relate to in their financial and upper strata positions in life, the whole point of this is to reflect upon ""Mother.""  That is, most of our detailed experiences of dealing with our own, and regardless of social status or class, it is without question, simply the best title this movie could have.  Because unless we've had some weird and unusual relationship(s) with the woman who gave us birth, there are many, many circumstances dealt with here, which should be familiar, poignant, and lovingly amusing to most of us.  I saw a LOT of my own dearly departed mum's traits and characters in Debbie Reynolds, who came out of Hollywood film retirement here to brilliantly play Albert Brooks' mother, and I'm sure my experience as such, should be shared by many viewers, if not most.

In this Albert Brooks film jewel, he plays a rather neurotic, aging 30's-40's something, modestly successful LA sci-fi book author, divorced for the second time, who comes to a point in his life where he deeply questions why exactly he has seemed to miserably fail in romantic relationships with women in general, and with his ex-wives in particular.  After a quick low point, a hilarious and disastrous blind-date with a beautiful but air-headed girl (played effectively by Lisa ""Friends"" Kudrow), whereas we pick up the main linear narrative, our primary protagonist up and decides to just move back into his aging mother's house north of San Fran, trying to somehow connect his ongoing, dysfunctional relationship(s) with women to his mom and discover just what about relating to the opposite sex in general, he's had so such trouble with.  That he decides to try such a stunt with his own mother, as opposed to former girlfriends and wives, is what gives the film its overall charm and uniqueness.  For his mom turns out to be much more than the surface caricature ""mother"" he ever imagined.

This basic premise really is genius, but the detailed way it is written and played out, is even more so.  Albert's brother, a rather wealthy sports agent, who has his own special relationship with his mom, but quite a different one, figures prominently in the plot, and leads to lots of truly profound but funny as hell, moments throughout.  Indeed, before Brooks eventually moves in with his mom (setting up his ""old room"" in her home, as if he hadn't left since high school), a major factor in his decision is this brother/brother sibling rivalry for their mother's affection, which exists below the surface for both.  This in itself leads to many laughs as well as some prudent insights about mother-son-son-brother-brother relationships in general, which I can readily identify with.

Still, the main focus here is about the forced if temporary connection between Albert Brooks and his mom, Debbie Reynolds, and how, beyond the trivialities of favorite ice cream, preferred peanut butter brands, and other frustrating differences between the two, so many mother-son moments ring true.  The film goes beyond such minor differences however, because so many of the idiosyncrasies which the son and mother both exhibit to each other in this strange situation of living together again after so many years, will spark recognition of themselves in most viewers.  After seeing this several times, I'm certain of that, at the very least.  While Debbie's behavior and habits confuse, confound, and at times infuriate Albert, the same can be said of Albert's quirks and his reactions, from her point of view.

This is a film made up of many, many, very, very small details about the typical mother-offspring dynamic, all of which adds up one by one until at various points, it almost feels like this was all based upon a true story.  At least it felt like that for me, and I will watch this many times in the future and I'm sure I will find many more meaningful details and truths throughout.  There are times within the film where I could swear, from memories of moments in my own life, where my very own mom practically said the exact same things and acted in the exact same ways as Debbie Reynolds does.  Conversely. I can remember myself almost mimicking many of the attitudes and lines from Albert Brooks.  It is an amazing and amusing feature of this which I'm sure will resonate with most.

While my mom and me personally, and our family and I suppose my siblings (brother and sister) perhaps never came close to the financial wealth generally displayed in this film (we were all a rather poor lot), it comes awfully close enough in so many ways, lines, and situations, and in the end, it all works brilliantly.  If you can't see yourself as very analogous to any of the main characters here, I'd just have to wonder just what planet you were born on, because it certainly wasn't/isn't mine.

I do so miss my mother.  As I write this, it's only been less than three months, but it seems like years since she left me and her other children, as well as grandchildren, one great granddaughter, and many others who loved her so much.  I was hesitant to watch this again on cable when I saw it available, after so many years of having not seen it for so long, and I have to admit to postponing watching it because of its very title, and my loss.  But watch it I did recently, and again, and again, and it really is a special film.  It adroitly depicts the mother-sibling (especially male) relationship, more genuinely than just about any other Hollywood film I've ever seen.  And it all ends up with a wonderful and unexpected surprise last scene.

While the fact that my own sweet, angelic mom only passed recently, and while I consciously take this into account as far as my extremely favorable review of this goes, I did see this long ago, when my mom was sentient and truly alive before her long illness took hold, and loved the movie back then as much as today.  And nothing has changed since, really.  This movie is not only original but stands the test of time, and my initial positive reactions to it have only been amplified in successive viewings.

I love this film, and I'd like to think my mom, if she could've seen it (which I don't think she did), would've loved it as well.  This is a luminous, fun experience with many moments which I think virtually anyone can identify with in some ways at least, and hopefully, as I did, in a generally, true-to-life, life-affirming, yet hilarious at times, manner.

Debbie Reynolds should have won every major award for her portrayal as Albert's mom.
Rob Morrow plays Albert's younger brother,who is very close to Mom. It's refreshing to see Rob Morrow play a bit against type.

This film isn't fast-paced, obvious, or sexy: It is thoroughly entertaining, witty, and universal. Brooks uses dialogue (remember when actors spoke to act?) to ferry his observations.

I love the perspective of a middle-aged writer who conceptualizes ""The Experiment"" during his introspective, post-divorce period. His tenacity and vulnerablity portray the nature of a writer perfectly.

Debbie Reynolds is lovely and enjoyable and funny! She is, as always, elegantly sweet and ""in"" character.

894066,4,6304502362,"You would think any movie entitled MOTHER would either have to be the ultimate schmaltzfest or the penultimate psychodrama.  Surprise! Albert Brooks film is neither.  In fact, Brooks' specialty seems to be taking potentially weighty themes and making smart, but still lighter-than-air films on them.  What DEFENDING YOUR LIFE did for the afterlife, MOTHER does for family relations.  And that's a good thing.
Brooks has a deft, understated comic flair.  You chuckle more often than you laugh out loud.  Contrary to what others have posted below, Debbie Reynolds ""Mother"" character is not a black and white character at all.  She's as conflicted and complicated--and as it turns out, just as smart--as her neurotic son(s).  That's the beauty part.  Brooks allows all his characters their humanity.  He doesn't oversimplify things (frustrated son vs. castrating mother).  Mother had her own issues--dating back to her own childhood and adolescence. Brooks' writer character John finally makes that realization and, in a very real sense, it proves liberating for him.  But that almost makes MOTHER sound like more of a ""message movie"" than it ever was intended to be.  In the end, MOTHER makes a gentle plea for self-realization for all.  But that message just kind of sneaks up on you.  What makes Albert Brooks kind of refreshing is that he doesn't have to lay it on with a trowel.",1076544000,18,1380,5.071111111111111

894069,3,6304502362,"Every movie has a target age demographic and audience, and I think I might have been too young to fully appreciate this kind of movie.  There's nothing in here that I was too young to see or comprehend, but perhaps I was too young to relate and identify, and so I didn't find this movie as entertaining as I would have liked.
This movie is about a middle-aged writer named John (Albert Brooks) who has just finalized his second divorce and decides his problems with women might be rooted in his childhood relationship with his mother (Debbie Reynolds).  He travels from his house in Los Angeles to his childhood home in Sausalito and moves back in with her in order to reconstruct the past and see exactly where things went wrong in their relationship.  There's a rather amusing running joke about how they're comically mismatched, especially when it comes to their choices in food.  This living situation goes on for a few weeks until John discovers an old hat box in the closet containing some old short stories that his mother had written before he was born.  John realizes that his mother used to be a very gifted writer, and he wonders if his sullen relationship with her has anything to do with the fact that she had to stop writing in order to raise a family.
The movie is a comedy, and while there are some light chuckles here and there, there aren't enough.  The story seems to linger on until the last five minutes, where everything is hastily resolved.  Albert Brooks has always been a solid B-level actor, and that's exactly what he is in this anemic performance.  There's probably a reason why this is Debbie Reynolds' first leading role in almost 30 years, and it might have to do with the fact that she's not much of an actress, herself.  I never got the feeling that she was really acting, but instead, just delivering the lines written in the movie's script.  Rob Morrow gives a solid performance as Jeff, John's younger and more successful sibling who relies heavily on his mother's praise and approval.
You might like this movie if you're over the age of 40, but if you're any younger than that, find something else to watch.",1044057600,5,2144,4.603674540682415

She figured that anything that costed over ten dollars was a rip off and that she was being fooled. This movie is light and funny. It has a warm feeling to it. I watched this movie numerous times and I'm still not tired of watching it.

What happens is an interesting premise where mom and son reveal secrets and feelings.

Like Woody Allen and Mel Brooks, Albert Brooks (no relation) seems to have a psychological therapy approach to the mother issue.

Unlike Allen, he doesn't whine (much) or complain, instead he makes a series of clever observations and then resolves the conflict with humor and warmth: Albert is such a mensch!
