8186211,4,B0007LXIDI,like a Ted Talk for Signal Corp troops in 1942-43 it is interesting for the insight into the marketing of the skills sought to win a war that had to be won.  It is boring by the standard of today but as a piece of historical necessity it is actually well done and quite revealing about the values of quality of war support that it takes to win a war involving the world.,1475884800,,370,4.068493150684931
8186212,5,B0007LXIDI,"This is one of the more esoteric World War II documentaries I've seen. Instead of focusing on the troops, it instead explains how radio communications were used to help the allies defeat germany. I liked the propoganda angles and the clips are very, very well preserved, with some of the best sound quality I've heard in a while.",1153699200,,329,4.689655172413793
8186213,5,B0007LXIDI,"You know, it had never occured to me how hard it must have been to run a battle in the days before radio. I mean, today we have the Internet and cells phones, but back before the 1930s there was almost  no way for generals to keep in contact w ith their troops and such. That meant they had to be in the front lines or just hope for the best.

This DVD shows how radios changed all that during World War II. It's interesting to see  how they slowly incorporated radio communications into the battleplace which allowed the leaders to stand back and co-ordinate much more involved attacks and win the war.

It's a good lesson.",1153094400,,624,4.3076923076923075
