2487957,5,B000E40QC4,"This would be a steal at twice the price.  I don't know what possessed Spike Lee to offer five of his best movies at such a low price.  Do the Right Thing is a brilliant movie, capturing both the rhythms and tensions of Lee's beloved Brooklyn, which he would return to time and again.  Lee is at his best when avoiding the polemics and sticking to character-driven movies.  Jungle Fever and Mo' Better Blues stand out in this regard, because they are first and foremost about people.  Jungle Fever introduced the great Samuel L. Jackson, as well as launched Wesley Snipes in an intense social drama which revolves around an inter-racial love affair.  Jackson stole most of the scenes however as the drug-addled brother who simply couldn't get his act straight no matter how hard he tried.  Mo' Better Blues exposed Lee's love for jazz.  Moody and atmospheric, with Denzel Washington delivering a solid performance, the film tries to recapture the spirit of the Harlem Renaissance.  Clockers was his crime drama with plenty of tension. Crooklyn revolved mostly around amusing family disputes, with Alfre Woodard as a strong mother figure.  It was probably the least satisfying of the five, but fun to watch just the same.  Lee embelishes his movies with such rich cinematic color, and offers numerous fascinating camera angles such as his now famous walking scenes in Jungle Fever.  Not since Gordon Parks, had someone done so much for black cinema, rescuing it from the blaxploitation films of the 70's.",1153353600,30,1503,4.920634920634921
2487958,5,B000E40QC4,"This is a must have DVD set for anyone that has seen or not seen these Spike Lee movies.

There is so much energy and rawness to ""Do the Right Thing"".  Issues such as bigotry, racism, sexism and cultural differences as a whole are brought front and center and seen through the eyes of the people in the Brooklyn Bedford-Stuyvesant 'hood.

""Jungle Fever"" is there a better movie that tackles inter-racial dating? A resounding,""I don't think so!""

""Clockers"" is such a riveting film regarding the drug dealers and drugs that have engulfed so many people, particularly young adults and children. This is another must see film.

Purchase the collection and you will not be disappointed.",1151280000,12,682,4.895652173913043

2487961,5,B000E40QC4,"Spike Lee objected to his father marrying someone because she was white.

No matter how good the films were, there are many of you who would never purchase products by a white director if he or she objected to their father marrying someone because she was black.

Let your social conscience be a guide and not be hypocritical in purchasing this if you would not purchase by a such white director.

I.e. don't be like many boondocks readers",1141862400,5,439,4.602564102564102

2487988,5,B000E40QC4,"I love how 5 of these movies combined! The best three I like out of five is ""Do the right thing!"" 5 stars for that!
The next one was ""Mo better Blues!"" I give it about 5 stars as well!
The other movie was ""Jungle Fever!"" I like the movie and it was kind of funny! But the way it ended is very tragic and very confusing!  I had to give this one 3 1/2 stars this time!
The other movie was ""Crooklyn!"" The movie was straight and it ended  pretty good! I give this one 5 stars as well!
The other movie ""Clockers"" was straight! It kind of ended in a way. But not as decent like I thought it would be. I give this movie about 4 1/2 stars.

I got to admit; some of Spike Lee movies are not that good! Except for Malcolm-X, Do the right thing, Mo better blues, Crooklyn, and the 25th hour!
But other than that I like this whole DVD collection! A perfect gift for somebody who is a fan of Spike Lee!
Thanks Amazon!

2487989,5,B000E40QC4,"Late 80's and early 90's Spike Lee consistently gave us films that entertained while at the same time inspired critical thinking on social issues. We laughed, we cried as Spike presented a mirror image of ourselves that didn't always present us in the best light. I hope another collection will be made available of some of Spike Lee's other movies from the 80's and 90's, which for me represents his best work.",1451174400,,411,4.722222222222222

2488060,5,B000E40QC4,I was born and raised in Brooklyn New York I can relate to each of these films from personal experience. I had not viewed many of the works by the controversial director Spike Lee so I was happy to pick up 5 films at a good price. Putting aside the provocative and thought provoking message each film displays I found some of the sexual scenes to be a little hard on the eyes and maybe a little over the top. Four of the films have an R rating and for a very good reason so view accordingly. I still recommend this collection from the stand point that there some well known and highly acclaimed actors playing in some key starting roles give it a look see.,1361664000,,656,4.214285714285714

2488079,5,B000E40QC4,"Hard to put into words how good this is. Price makes it a steal but the movies are worth a lot more. Spike Lee offers an educated look at race, religion and society that is oft overlooked in today's world of Meet the Browns and Madea. A few people believe Spike Lee was too critical regarding Tyler Perry but I think Mr. Lee has every right to attack the pop culture product that Perry pushes.

So far I've watched Crooklyn, Jungle Fever, and Mo Betta Blues. (I will update with the other reviews)

CROOKLYN
Not my favorite movie. Good movie and pulls at your heart strings at the end. In depth look at life in the city.

MO BETTA BLUES
Great movie. Life through the eyes of a dedicated musician. The ending was kind of unbelievable to me at least but still a great movie.

JUNGLE FEVER
Snipes' character rises above society's racism/inability to take responsibility for their actions (ie his parents that blame the devil and his brother that blames drugs) only to later fall victim to it through experiences and biases. Reads like a Shakespearean tragedy.",1327104000,,1056,4.601063829787234

Do the Right Thing is of a silly protest towards none-own values, a manifestation of racial intolerance and bigotry Afro-African majority exercised towards an Italian family providing a friendly business more than quarter century in ""black"" area.

Jungle Fever is about a Baptist Minister's family having both adult sons lost on a landscape of lust and lack of opportunities for Afro-Americans in then America.

Clockers is about police drug investigation and interaction of characters involved in.

2488084,5,B000E40QC4,"These five films make a fine introduction to the early work of Spike Lee, one of the most exciting directors working today, a man who has remained true to his cinematic vision. In the 80s and 90s, Lee was working with top talent, including such icons as Halle Berry, Wesley Snipes, and Samuel L. Jackson. This compact box set really captures the cream of black motion pictures during that period.

The quality of the DVDs matches that of the films, but please be advised that this set includes no extras. Also, the collection contains two double-sided discs (Clockers and Jungle Fever are on opposite sides of Disc 1; Do the Right Thing and Mo' Better Blues are on opposite sides of Disc 2; Crooklyn is on Disc 3).

2488095,1,B000E40QC4,"In reality, I wouldn't give this product a one star rating. I'd probably give it a three or a four. However, I know that I (and I assume other people) tend to read the one-star ratings before buying something, rather than the better reviews, and I may have an issue with my collection that other people may want to consider before purchasing. My main problem is that of the five movies, two (Clockers and Jungle Fever) contained many 'digital glitches'. Clockers is actually on the verge of being unwatchable because the DVD is of such a low quality. That being said, the remaining movies work perfectly, and I'm sure I'll enjoy them many more times down the road. Yes, it is pretty disappointing that only 3/5ths of the product works, but, in the end, three great movies for $20 is still a great deal.",1202860800,32,802,4.576388888888889

Looking back, we haven't progressed much in alleviating the many issues portrayed in these films -- either in reality or on film. We need to do better.

This set will (hopefully) help educate a new generation to rethink their views and re-evaluate their tastes in film. Stories are captivating, dvd quality is great, and price is right. Only one wish -- more social and historical extras could be useful for today's audiences.",1199664000,,587,4.87
2488097,5,B000E40QC4,"""Mo Betta makes it Mo Betta"" These are the films that we formed our awareness with and opened our eyes to the race issues in America that get conveniently dusted under the rug - but the lump is so big.  The racist problems of the past are still a problem today but they are hidden better.  Spike Lee is the director that brought us the reality of the African American upper middle class back to the big screen.  But more than that, he brought us a slice of life from everyones perspective, the everyday problems between husband and wife that lead to the husband looking for love outside of his marriage. (Jungle Fever) The problem of being swept up with the emotions of the crowd and lumping people into stereo types or standing alone for what you know is the right thing to do, regardless of the outcome. (Do the right thing) There is one thing to be talented and devoted to your art.  Pride and treating people like objects or possessions eventually you have to pay for your sins, most of the time when you least expect it. The Devil gets his due and it is a humbling experience but it is not what happens to you that matters, it is how you recover from it that proves what you are made of.  ""Back in the day when I was young"" when I was a child, when I was growing up life was so much more and there were so many things that made life better then that were ruined by technology.  People spent time outside because they wanted to. Exercise was a part of life because there were not many ways around it.  People had manners, children had respect for adults and everyone was inside by the time the lights came on.  It was not all rose colored glasses and lemonade.  There were racial problems and issues there were problems with discrimination and people were poor but the sense of family was better.  The stronger the family the stronger the child. I remember when is the theme of Crooklyn. Clockers on the other hand was just not memorable for me something about cops and conscience.  The problem with the truth is that it changes depending on who is telling the story.  Spike tries to tell everyones story so you can determine the truth for yourself.
All in all if you have a movie marathon night make it an emotional and memorable with Spike.",1197072000,,2246,4.385542168674699

With the release of the Spike Lee Joint Collection (Clockers/ Jungle Fever/ Do the Right Thing/ Mo` Better Blues/ Crooklyn), the legendary film maker is making a very strong statement in the movie industry on producing an extraordinary product at an affordable price.

This is Economics 101 at its simplest, five movies for the cost of a couple of movie tickets at most theaters. It is as much a collection for fans of Lee's career as it an outstanding sampler for those just getting into his style.

And it begs a very important question; if Lee and Max - along with others - can do it, why isn't this practical approach done industry-wide within the arts?",1173571200,12,871,4.535031847133758

I`m not gonna tell about formats or any other technical issue, i`m just saying that 5 of the most important Spike Lee feature films are included here, from ""Do the right thing"" to ""Clockers"", the very best ones. How many compilations of important directors don`t include their actual best works? That`s because those movies are better sold separately in hughe collector's editions.
In this case, the best of spike lee is included here despite that fact, check ""Do the right thing"" in it`s 23 dollar Criterion collection.
Of course, ""Malcolm x"" would be a fantastic adittion , but that would be too much joy.
