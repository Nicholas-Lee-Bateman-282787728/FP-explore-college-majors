2076853,1,B0002CR09U,"I'm glad I rented this movie instead of buying it,im still out $4.08 though. These college kids spend almost the whole movie looking for a pot plantation that they found a map to. I won't bore you with anymore details than that, it's not worth it. I kept waiting for the funny parts and the chance to laugh but it never came. This movie SUCKS, if you feel like you have to watch it wait for one of your friends to rent or buy it.",1094428800,,429,4.0588235294117645
2076854,4,B0002CR09U,"`Rolling Kansas' seems to be an independent film maker's early effort, in technical quality and polish much like Kevin Smith's `Mallrats' and `Chasing Amy', with veteran Rip Torn in the role of recognized face, played in Smith's movies by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. There is even a superficial similarity in the importance of marijuana to the plot and obscenity to the dialogue, two stock aspects of Jay and Silent Bob.

One big difference between this movie and Kevin Smith's works is that while I was delighted to see a news item saying that Smith was to be doing an updated movie on his characters from his first movie `Clerks', including, one can hope, a reappearance of Jay and Silent Bob, I feel no strong anticipation in considering a follow-up to this movie.

That is not the same as saying that the movie was not entertaining. It simply did not engage one's sympathy for the characters and their plights. They were not smart / cynical like the principle characters in `Clerks'. They were not nerdy / smart as in revenge of the nerds. They were not so dumb as in `Dumb and Dumber' that you cringed at their stupidity. They were simply average college age ciphers without a clue about much of anything except running a marginal tee-shirt store and selling weed to middle class students who still drive original Volkswagen beetles. Then, the prospect of incredible good fortune lands in their laps entirely by accident.

As this event is told on the notes on the back of the box, it is no mystery that the good fortune is in the form of a map from their hippie parents to an abandoned experimental governmental installation for growing marijuana. The boys live in northern Texas and this `Magical Forest of Marijuana' is about 400 miles away in central Kansas. This sets off the whole point of the movie, the trip to Kansas to harvest lots of primo weed from this almost forgotten marijuana forest. It's at this point where the five boys' stupidity becomes fully engaged with their inept preparations for the trip and their misadventures on the way with heavily stereotyped representatives of both federal and state law enforcement agencies.

The only character who is in the least believable is Rip Torn's wanderer who assists them in finally locating the stand of weed. And, all this stupidity and stereotyping is definitely intentional and done for the comic effect. The only problem is that you start to become self-conscious about finding humor in such inane devices.

This would not be a comedy if everything did not come out well for our heroes in the end, with at least one amazing flash of inspiration by the owner of the tee-shirt store which netted the boys more money than they would ever have made from selling the weed, with much less risk of interference by aforementioned law enforcement agencies.

It just dawned on me that the writers' naming the family of principle characters `Murphy' may specifically have been a reference to the famous `Murphy's Law', because just about every misfortune imaginable befalls our hapless heroes, largely as a result of their own relentless stupidity.

This movie is entertaining. I did not regret watching it, even though I have no interest in tracking down other things this creative crew may have done. Again, the story and characters simply did not engage my interest as a Kevin Smith cast and story can do. Also, unlike Smith's productions that have the resources of Mirimax behind them, this DVD has zero special features. This is surprising, because these will often make the difference between an indifferent and a worthwhile DVD purchase.

Watch it if you like potty stories. Not worth the money to purchase.",1094083200,5,3676,4.851674641148326
2076855,4,B0002CR09U,"What a delight. I saw parts of it on Comedy Central and laughed very hard, and then purchased the DVD and was able to enjoy a very silly little movie that will make you laugh. If you enjoyed Wes Anderson's Bottle Rocket, then this movie is for you. Cameos: Kevin Pollack and Thomas Haden Church (director) play DEA agents with a confused bad cop/crazy cop schtick that's very amusing. Thomas Haden Church also plays a state trooper in an earlier scene, as well. And finally, Rip Torn as an old man named ""Oldman"" adds some tenderness to the film. At the very least, rent this. What do you have to lose? 4 bucks and 2 hours? I highly recommend this DVD. Be warned, there are no special features to speak of and no subtitles, without those, I give this a four and a half. Enjoy!",1093219200,7,776,4.358620689655172
2076856,5,B0002CR09U,"I saw this movie last summer at the Miami film festival with my family, and none of us could stop laughing. Granted, the plot is a little fuzzy, and there really is little point to the movie, but its just hilarious. Its one of those movies that you cant help but quote, constantly. I cant wait to buy it so I am no longer the only one of my friends who knows what I'm talking about.",1086307200,6,382,4.0394736842105265

2076886,5,B0002CR09U,"I like the TV show Psych, and (even though Roday plays a completely different character in this film) I enjoy this film as well.  It doesn't have any huge-name stars, the acting won't blow you away and the plot won't change your life... but.  But I like this movie.  I saw most of it somewhere, and every once in a while I would think of it and miss it.  I finally hunkered down to do some research and figure out which movie I was thinking of and ordered it - with no regrets.

It's a buddy movie with a quest, and some laughs.  It's not Stand By Me, but there are shining moments.  The primary appeal of this movie is simply the way I feel when I watch it.",1373068800,2,658,4.054263565891473

This is just a crazy stoner/buddy comedy, it's still funny every time I watch it. To sum it up 3 brothers find a map that their parents left them and on that map is directions to a magical forest of marijuana, which is government owned, so the brothers take two of their friends and go on a crazy journey just to harvest pot basically for money troubles.. which leads to strippers, a crazy old man named ""Oldman"" and alot of law men that's on their trail.

The acting is well beneath amateurish and the characters stupid wAAAY beyond humorous. pathetic is the word that comes to mind for this picture. plot? stupid. i suppose someone could have taken this idea and made it into something worth watching but it didn't happen here. even watching it with a major buzz-on won't help.  it's just bad... torturously bad and insulting to one's intelligence. you'll be better off watching cheech & chong for the 167th time. if you must see it, get it from a library.",1263340800,,625,4.63063063063063

2076919,2,B0002CR09U,"This movie was essentially a rip-off of the MUCH BETTER Fandango, which starred (seriously) Kevin Costner. The characters, the basic plot, the basic geography were all lifted from Fandango, and shamelessly so.

Not since the ""Point Break"" rip-off, ""The Fast and the Furious"", have i seen such a blatant rip-off of a film.

Quality-wise, it is quite weak.",1149206400,,354,5.086206896551724
2076920,5,B0002CR09U,I love this movie. It is a total stoner film! I was laughing so hard during every scene! 5 STARS!!!,1145145600,3,99,4.0
2076921,4,B0002CR09U,"This little gem of a stoner movie had me rolling on the floor, literally. In the vein of Liquid Sky, Pot Luck, and Half Baked, it tells the story of 5 guys who are out to make a profit following a ""treasure map"" to a secret government forest of marijuana, left to them (the map, not the weed) by their parents. Also showing his face in this little ditty is veteran actor Rip Torn, playing an ex agricultural government agent who has prefected the art of growing sensimilia. On their journeys, the 5 boys have lots of misadventures before finding the ""magic forest of marijuana."" One of the guys is a parapalegic, one has narcolepsy, one is a nerd, and one (Kevin) turned out to be gay.

I wouldnt recommend this film if you are looking for oscar winning performances by talented actors. I would suggest this if you are a fan of Kevin Smith films (the early ones). Dont buy this film, rent it, you'll laugh, you'll cry, you see strippers, and LOTS of pot!",1122681600,13,954,4.420454545454546
2076922,4,B0002CR09U,I stumbled upon this little gem on comedy central the other day. Won't bore you with plot (others have scroll down) but it has a tone to it thas hard to beat. Very funny movie if you have a dry evolved wit although it did falter two-thirds till ending. Worth a view absolutely!,1113955200,5,277,4.245283018867925
2076923,3,B0002CR09U,"this is about a group of friends who go on this journey to the state of Kansas where they are on a quest to find the world's largest magical forest of weed and when they get there they are gonna bring it all back home and distribute it to the world but their plans go hay wire and they have to stash it away in a field. soon when they come back it is gone but then they get an idea and make t-shirts of the map they have. it's a brainless comedy though there are tons of great one liners and some funny situations. Directed by none other then Thomas Haden Church (Tv's Wings, Sideways). Church plays two parts, one being a border patrol cheif and the other being a FBI Agent alongside a amusing cameo by Kevin Pollack (The Usual Suspects, The Whole Nine Yards, The Whole Ten Yards). Also starring Jay Paulson, Sam Hutchinson who plays paralyzed from the waist down Dick and Rip Torn (Men In Black 1 and 2, Freddy Got Fingered). Torn plays Old Man and he lives in a tree on the side of a road. Best character in this movie is the kid, Kevin, who has a brain the size of a peanut who just sprouts out stuff with no reason.

Poor characters, poor plot, poor structure.  IMDB give it a 6.7 out of 10, I would probably give it a big zero.  At the end of the movie, my friend and me were wondering if we had to take this movie as a joke or seriously, because there is a kind of morality to all that trip, but the actors are so poor that we couldn't do the difference between joke and philosophy.
