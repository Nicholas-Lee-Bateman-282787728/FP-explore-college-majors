4552486,2,B0053WQE6O,"Like most horror fans I watch a lot of movies that are considered bad, as in ""this sucks"".  I've found over the years that it's kinda 50-50 that I will like or dislike a film.  This movie is pretty bad.  Brandon Routh seemed kinda bored and seemed to have only one expression, well, kinda bored.  I gave the movie two stars because 1.  Anita Brien is hot and, 2. Sam Huntington was kinda funny, sometimes.  Taye Diggs character seemed to be a cross between Eddie Murphy's vampire and Superfly.  Was the gold canine really necessary?  I don't think this was the actors fault, really. The director will have to be held responsible.  If you want to view film, rent it first and you will get what I mean.  You will know you just wasted your money.",1312156800,3,743,4.397058823529412
4552487,4,B0053WQE6O,"This movie is funny, action packed, All known monsters & All around fun movie, didn't get the box office like the other crap gets but this is a great movie for horror monster lovers with a little comedy thrown in their..trust me you will like it if you have taste:)",1312070400,2,265,4.32

4552489,4,B0053WQE6O,"Brandon Routh is absolutely astonishing as the legendary troubadour, portrayed here as a singing, swinging gunslinger and sometime paranormal investigator whose well-meaning but relentless social conscience is forever getting him into trouble.  Dylan fans will no doubt find this a fascinating study of the iconic songwriter/performer, but even the uninitiated should have little trouble getting caught up in the electric excitement generated by Routh's performance.",1311638400,,466,6.1692307692307695
4552490,3,B0053WQE6O,"""They say if you live long enough, you live to see everything."" After investigator Dylan's (Routh) friend is killed and becomes a zombie he once again begins to do what he does best...find zombies, werewolves and vampires. This is a movie 100% geared toward teens and fans of the ""Buffy"" and ""Angel"" TV shows. A darkly funny and sometimes over the top comedy-horror. Every part was actually very well cast, but it's hard to look at Routh without thinking, hey it's ""Superman"", but that may just be me. This was not really a movie that I could get into, but this is the type of movie that many, many people will enjoy. I was just never a fan of the ""Buffy"" show, and this has a definite feel of that type of show. Overall, not really my kind of movie, but if you like this type of stuff you will really love this. I give it a C.

Would I watch again? - I could barely make it through once.

*Also try - Beauty And The Beast : A Dark Tale & Bitten",1311552000,4,945,4.158469945355192
4552491,3,B0053WQE6O,"Like my title says, it is a decent movie and it is worth the watch. I won't go all gung ho like the other two reviewers about details, but the movie started out pretty good and it stayed in the good range, there was no real climax in action as it was basically all action. The ending I suppose had a sort of climax then an anti-climax/neutral area.  I will say though that the movie will throw you for a loop and that's the only reason I really liked it. I didn't guess the plot at all. I also didn't know it was a comic, which I gleamed from the other reviewers review, so I suppose the fans of this comic might like or hate this movie, and if you didn't know about the comics either, then you'll probably enjoy watching it as well. It just didn't wow me, but if you like a action/horror/comedy movie, then this is worth buying. I would say rent it first, or wait until it hits the 5 dollar shelf mark.",1310256000,9,903,4.101694915254237
4552492,3,B0053WQE6O,"Not familiar with the comic, I found some background info on the comic on another Amazon review:
==============
Like a James Bond of the occult--only not as suave or debonair--Dylan Dog manages to get himself in and out of trouble with finesse, while bedding a different lady with each adventure he embarks on. A self-styled ""nightmare investigator,"" he takes on cases that normal PIs won't. Along with his assistant, Felix, a quip-spouting Groucho Marx lookalike, he tracks down some extremely dark persons (and nonpersons) for a somewhat modest fee.

Dylan Dog was created by writer Tiziano Sclavi in 1986. Originally published in Italy, the long-running series is set in London, where Dylan works as a supernatural investigator who (against type in a series like this) has a good working relationship with the police. Dylan is a former Scotland Yard investigator, and perhaps the reincarnation of the original Dylan Dog, who died in 1686.

Dylan Dog's mysteries have been published off and on over the past two decades, with Sclavi backing off and allowing others to interpret the character. The good-looking investigator has become a true star in Italy's comics publishing, as well as around the world.
============

This movie deviates from this description:
1) Dylan isn't a Casanova, he actually has some past that keeps him pushing women away
2) His sidekick looks nothing like Groucho and works for free vs. a fee. He does it more out a friendship for Dylan
3) No mention -- that I remember -- about his relation to Scotland Yard. His history and relationship to the undead/monsters is explained very differently in the movie.
4) No finesse in the movie...he is a ""tough guy"" instead who is willing to punch or shoot his way through to a solution

This movie actually starts off in a Dresden Files kind of way. . .
1) We have a broke Detective letting himself do work he'd rather not do just to pay the bills
2) He relies on ""old"" technology and the like
3) He has contacts all throughout the monster/undead community
4) A VW bug that isn't reliable

The funniest part of the movie is how his buddy/sidekick has to deal with his. . .uh. . .new condition. He's definitely the comic relief of the movie.

Brandon Routh has a great narration voice, just like the old detective movies. He's not required to do a lot of acting though. What would have made him more convincing is if they had made him all scruffy vs. his Superman, clean-shaven look.

The makeup job on the werewolves was kinda SyFy channel quality, but considering the movie it all fits

Taye Diggs had the best acting opportunities and he delivered them very well. Great job Taye.

There seemed to be something missing with the love interest in the movie...one minute they don't know each other the next its like she's giving him pity sex, because of his situation. I didn't get any chemistry between them. But when things heat up, his narration has a great one-liner.

What also didn't make sense, is the ""monster"" of the story kills people one way. But both times that Dylan comes-face to face with it, there is a punching match. Uh...why? Other than to extend the scene and give us some action, I guess. Inconsistent. Too bad. :(

The final transformation of the movie was cool.

Ending was okay...for me it was a bit anticlimatic, because it had nothing to do with the efforts of our main protagonist per se.

This won't create the cult following that Army of Darkness has.
But those wanting more of Dresden, and with none forthcoming, they may like to watch this for a lot of similarities.
And the name Dylan Dog just rolls off the tongue well. :)",1309132800,33,3623,4.722662440570523

So many bad things it's five stars for transcendental merits -- it should be studied to see how much money can be wasted doing a production to high standards, and the dog refuses to hunt.

Brandon routh showed up, but he's just a pretty face.  after his superman debacle nobody expects anything from him but to look good.  he did his job.  he looked good.  no director, no script got me thru about 20 minutes.  if your a routh fan go and watch this for ninety minutes, but with the volume off.",1491264000,,586,4.293577981651376

There are a few scenes that could possibly get a slight twitch (not a full jump), but the film is mostly a monster whodunnit told with snarky sarcasm by the titular character, Dylan Dog.

4552573,3,B0053WQE6O,"Welcome to the World of 'Dylan Dog' (Brandon Routh) where what is thought not to
exist, does, we are talking 'Werewolves' 'Vampires' and 'Zombies' 'Dylan' goes
where human-kind fear to tread.
He has retired from his job as a 'private investigator' he killed monsters for a living.
When a friend 'Marcus' (Sam Huntington) is murdered by a Werewolf, 'Dylan' swings
back into action, and has also accepted the case of a similar killig of 'Elizabeth's'
(Anita Briem) father.
The supernatural investigator is well used to dealing with the creatures of the night...
in this World the dead don't always remain that way becoming 'The Living Dead' guess
we have just about every night creature in tow.
We even have a body-parts replacement service which comes in handy for resurrected
'Marcus' who's in need of an arm, he's now a unwilling Zombie.
'Dylan's' investigation into the murders takes him down some historic and secret facts
that very few know about.
There is a connection the murders have, the search for an ancient artifact, 'The Heart
of The Lion' if found and used it could recreate an ancient and all powerful creature that
could destroy mankind's presence on Earth.
A comic-tale that harbours a hint of 'Horror' some 'Tongue-in-cheek' action with a snip of
gore and grotesque images with, perhaps a brief jump-out-of-your-seat moment.

4552587,3,B0053WQE6O,"This is a cross over that makes it harder to evaluate.  As a Hollywood production it has few bragging rights.  The real deal full scale $20 million production would come in around a 2 or 2.5 star rating on that scale.  For a main stream film it has little to recommend it.
 But on the Zombie flick scale, it hits a very strong three and a half brains.  It has every thing we want in a Zombie flick.  The technical levels are very high so we don't have any of the common issues like crappy sound, washed out colors or dark colors or terrible acting.  The script is crisp, clever with enough funny moments to balance out the horror, which we like a lot.  It also holds together a number of thought threads without mixing them up or popping up with glaring absurdities.
 Dylan makes his living as a private investigator in colorful, photogenic New Orleans.  His previous life involved him in the hidden underworld of the un-dead.  He mediated disputes between, among and about vampires, werewolves and zombies.  The vampires have gone into commerce and now run a hip night club where they also peddle vials of vampire blood to the clubbers, a low cost, big profit high for the 'breathers', the human club goers.  One clan of werewolves has run a commercial meat plant since 1878.  The Zombies are high brain function critters whose issues include decaying body parts and stench.  These varied outfits seek to survive or even thrive by staying under the radar and avoiding lunching on the living, which would draw unwanted attention.  All these societies are sharply and cleverly drawn (including a support group for the recently Zombiefied, a nice touch).  The make up and special effects are of Hollywood quality, a massive up grade from most Zombie flicks.
 When a prominent antique dealer (and smuggler) is murdered by a werewolf, all Hell breaks loose as the various players hunt for a stolen artifact.
 We can only wish that every Zombie flick could be made with such professionalism
 Canadian born but now US citizen director Kevin Munroe also bossed TMNT in 2007.  The writing team of Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer have collaborated on several other, more successful films.  The wrote the screenplay from the original Italian comic book by Tiziano Sclari.  A vampire character in the film carries his name in homage.  In a further tip of the hat, a street sign says Craven, a reference to Wes Craven's large body of movie work.
 The actors are all real life pros.  Oddly, the central character of Dylan, the investigator, portrayed by very experienced actor Brandon Routh turns in the weakest effort.  His delivery often seems stilted.  He has some 45 TV and film credits so we take this as an aberration in his career.  He worked on two other comic book based films, Superman Returns and Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World. His weaknesses are more than made up by his follow cast members.
 His co-star is the lovely Icelandic actress Anita Briem that we remember from The Tudors on TV and other films.  Tayle Diggs has just the right amount of swagger and menace to be the leader of the vampires and has nearly 50 credits.  Sam Huntington plays Marcus, the investigator's annimated, funny, side kick.  Zombie side kick that is.  Huntington and star Routh also worked together on Superman Returns.
 I really like almost everything about Dylan Dog and found it a refreshing change from some of the low budget, low imagination films I have to watch.  But the public didn't agree.  The producers coughed up $20 million in movie money to make this one but world wide the box office only came to $4.6 million, a staggering loss.  It runs for one hour and 47 minutes with a PG-13 rating for violence and implied sex (no naked parts shown).  The one scene of zombie munching we view from afar.",1424217600,,3797,4.704097116843703

It's not that Dylan Dog: Dead of Night is all that bad - it just feels lacking because we're used to more from this genre. More action, more effects, and more of a climax would have made this more comparable to other similarly-themed projects, like the Constantine movie featuring Keanu Reeves, and the Sci Fi-channel's short-lived The Dresden Files. As with those properties' leads, Dylan is a reluctant supernatural detective with connections from a previous life who is dragged into taking on another case. If Brandon Routh as Dylan and Sam Huntington as his assistant , Marcus, seem to have good chemistry together, it's probably in part because this isn't their first time working together. This pair played Clark Kent/Superman and Jimmy Olson in 2006's not-stellar Superman Returns reboot  attempt. It's interesting to see them back together in different roles.

In a movie like this you have to have (or seem to have) a bond between at least the lead and his/her sidekick, and this movie did not dissapoint in that respect, nor did Brandon Routh playing a tough detective, complete with his narrative and a side-kick that keeps getting better while the movie goes through it's paces..

4552623,5,B0053WQE6O,"I love this film. Scratch that - I worship this film! Always I have searched the vast film world for that ideal film. A film that comprises many characteristics. The tone's of horror, comedy, mystery, etc. But also, the film which incorporates ghastly creatures: Vampires, Werewolves, and Zombies. But a movie can not accomplish such spectacular milestones without being set in that one, truly impeccable setting - New Orleans. So did Dylan Dog hit or miss the mark? Well some say it missed, and some say that it missed. In my opinion, it succeeded in doing what no other film has ever done in the face of our very own colossal universe.

A horror-comedy-mystery film set in New Orleans based on an Italian comic book character. That's right. Dylan Dog revolves around a retired ace detective (Brandon Routh) returning to his dangerous duties of paranormal cases within the big easy. In a southern city comprised of ghastly beasts, the title character goes undercover to unfold some unorthodox happenings that have been occurring within the large city of Louisiana. Along starring are: Sam Huntington as Marcus Deckler, a long-time friend and partner of Dog's. Anita Briem as the supporting distressed female client of Dog's that has summoned him to uncover a murder.

The story is a good 'ole fashioned mystery-horror type that was completely unpredictable from beginning to end. The pacing seems to be completely maintained throughout the whole film. Never did I feel that the story was dulling down or rushing through itself. The writers of the script absolutely made sure that their product did not travel or linger into unadvised area's. This is bound to have you on the edge of your seat from its inception to conclusion.

The acting in this film is flawless. Brandon Routh portrays the main detective with a stern and relentless personality. He completely reassures the audience with his intellectualism and valor when in frightening and thrilling situations. Sam Huntington plays the comedy sidekick, he is not your typical comedy sidekick though. Without spoiling anything, let me just say that there are aspects to his character and personality that separate him from every other existing supporting character in film history. His performance is memorable and hilarious as Marcus Deckler. One which should surely entertain an audience.

The setting was a hot topic for many Dylan Dog supporters. Apparently the original comic is set in London, England. This however is situated in New Orleans, Louisiana. Well let me tell all of you Dylan Dog readers out there, there exists no gloomier land on the face of the Earth than New Orleans. Everything from hurricane's to humidity to crime is nothing short of horror-mystery-comedy material. In fact, you would probably have more luck finding a real vampire in New Orleans than Transylvania per se. But how exactly is New Orleans used in Dylan Dog? New Orleans is the heart and soul of this very film. As the main detective wanders from place to place within the Big Easy, you can just feel the atmosphere and the suspense grow while watching it onscreen. It honestly is that astonishing.

For a film that is comprised of many scary creatures; the make-up is superb. In lieu of just taking all creativity to the cutting room floor and being over-the-top with CGI, Dylan Dog: Dead of Night stays impervious from the current trends of overdone special effects and sticks with classic make-up strategies most commonly used in fabulous horror films of the '80s. While remaining scary and thorough simultaneously, every creature looks as real as could be and operates in realistic functions. Just further reason why this is a true gem of the twenty-first century.

The music in this film is vital, but it also remains incognito for the most part. Never does the composer of the film direct the viewer entirely as to where the film is going, and that is brilliant. I've heard countless times composers of films go all Mozart during post-production. Just showing off their radical crescendo's and losing control of their music's direction in a film. But what Klaus Badelt does here is nothing short of godly. He lets the scenes make their appearance before his music directs them to that scene.

The overall execution of the film could not have been done much better. Every component was placed together with very meticulous arrangement. If there was one other film out there in which I could compare overall execution with, it would probably be The Godfather. Although that film was a less good version of this.

To inform about the Blu-ray presentation, the image is incredibly transparent. Every last pixel within every last frame was simply flawless. The audio was recorded wonderfully and was mixed and edited by an anonymous maestro. To add a very rare vice, I wish there was a bit more of special features to have been included. Just to get a glimpse of how this immaculate movie was designed, filmed, executed.

In the end, Dylan Dog sadly was an ignored gem that failed miserably at the box office. I believe if more were aware of this diamond's release, then a better revenue would have been racked up and a sequel would be in production at this time. A solid horror-comedy film that will never be forgotten. A character borne on the ideals of peace and bravery. Do yourself a favor and purchase this incredible piece of art, you will most definitely not regret it.",1361664000,,5422,4.929901423877327

The problem was the production values were incredibly cheap, the storyline only mildly engaging and I really was waiting for Sarah Michelle Gellar to jump out at any second.

The locations they went to were actually fun, like the Body shop was literally a body shop where they went to buy body parts like human arms. And the zombie support group was also a great addition. It also had a decent ending, didn't fully expect it. It did drag on a couple of times. My main complaint was Anita Briem's performance; she was very boring and bland. Most of her lines were emotionless and dull; she'd just stand around during the shots and wait to read her lines in the most tedious way possible. (like if she didn't want to be there). Brandon Routh and Sam Huntington were great though.

It's definitely not a film for everyone, but I recommend it to anyone with an open mind or plenty of free time. As of 8/10/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming.

Brandon Routh as Dylan Dog was okay (rather bland) in his part.  But I especially loved Sam Huntington as the trusty zombie sidekick, Marcus. I wonder if this got him the role as werewolf on the TV series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Being-Human/dp/B005GP7ELM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Being Human</a>&nbsp;or vice versa?  And the zombie parts store and Marcus' eating/non-eating habits were a hoot. The rest of the cast had some shining moments, especially Taye Diggs and Peter Stormare.

4552628,4,B0053WQE6O,"The movie starts out great. A young girl ( Anita Briem, ""Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D"" babe)is preparing supper for her and her dad. She is dancing in the kitchen, starting out with some good rock jams. She gets a clean plate out and sets it on the counter and then suddenly there is blood on the plate. It is dripping from the ceiling. She runs upstairs and her dad is dead. A werewolf jumps out the window...enter Dylan I. Dog (Brandon Routh), private investigator. He used to investigate weird undead things, a younger, hipper version of Kolchak, the Night Stalker. Dylan is old school. He uses snail mail. Deals with cash and checks, drives a VW Beetle (that backfires) and uses a film camera.

Dylan refuses the case until his friend Marcus (Sam Huntington) is killed. Now it has become personal. There are four werewolf clans. They operate in New Orleans like the mafia. The vampires are out to get Dylan and don't worry too much about Marcus, seems he was bitten by a zombie and becomes part of the ""undead."" There is a zombie support group for the recently undead. Seems all the can eat are worms, maggots and hot dogs. There is even a twist at the end.

The film definately had a bit of a film noir meets graphic novel vibe. It was funny and scary at the same time, a true horrorcomedy. The main character was charming in a weird way, where you didn't really expect it, and there were several surprizes to keep you on your toes. What I liked most though was that the vampires in this film weren't the pathetic sparkly variety. They were quite capable of ripping your throat out. There has been such a move to ""romanticise"" the vampire in modern fiction and films and I like to see one like this that goes back to the central premise of dangerous blood sucking fiends. I don't want to give too much of the plot away but I was very impressed.

4552633,4,B0053WQE6O,"Movie genres are mixed and match time and time again. Recently they mixed sci fi and the western resulting in COWBOYS & ALIENS. Sci fi was mixed with the samurai film for BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS. So nothing seems unusual when you mix comedy with horror and come up with something surprisingly delightful like DYLAN DOG.

Based on the comic book series by the same name, DYLAN DOG tells the tale of a private eye with a past that is slowly revealed as the film progresses. Dylan (Brandon Routh) picks up the usual divorce case here and there and has help from his friend Marcus (Sam Huntington). It takes place in New Orleans, a town twisted in mystery and the occult, both of which come into play throughout the film.

The film opens with an apparent murder to which Dylan is called by the victim's daughter, Elizabeth (Anita Briem). When Dylan asks why she called him, she hands him a card and he turns down the job and leaves rather suddenly.

When Dylan returns to his office later that night, he finds Marcus dead on the floor, his chest ripped open. Because of this loss, Dylan comes out of retirement from his previous job and starts the hunt for the killer of Elizabeth's father and Marcus, a killer he believes is the same person.

As he explains it later, Dylan's original job was as a policeman of sorts for all of the unnatural beings that had gathered in New Orleans, a town well suited for their needs. Vampires, werewolves, ghouls and zombies all live in New Orleans but people tend to just look the other way, knowing inside they're there but never acknowledging them. These creatures of the night have a truce that prevents them from taking on the normal people of the world. When one would step out, Dylan was the man to bring them in. But something happened that made him quit.

Fortunately for Dylan, Marcus rises from his slab in the morgue and becomes one of the living dead. Marcus doesn't find this fortunate though and throughout the film tries to deny this fact. Much of the humor in this film comes from Marcus and his situation such as his refusal to eat maggots to survive. Yes it's a gross joke but trust me when I say that in the hands of the group that brought this movie to life it becomes quite funny.

Dylan reunites with old friends and foes as he tries to uncover the mystery behind the deaths and why an importer like Elizabeth's father would hold any interest for the creatures he protects. You see Dylan isn't about hunting monsters but about protecting them...unless they defy the truce and take out innocent humans.

Meetings with zombies and vampires result with little to go on but a series of clues strung together like the best mysteries written. Each one ends with another clue that moves you further down the line to who is behind it all. And that isn't revealed until the last act.

I've never read the comic but word is they've done it justice here. With a limited budget to work with, the writers, director, cast and crew have pulled off a great combination of humor and horror that holds your interest till the end. Better yet, it leaves you wanting more, wishing that this would become a series of films rather than a single effort. The so so reception at the box office doesn't seem to make one think this will happen, but perhaps with an interest in the DVD it will.

Routh does a great job here. Many will recall him playing the title character in SUPERMAN RETURNS. Thoughts that he would be saddled with the character alone are tossed aside as he brings a life to Dylan here. The character is confident whether facing down a client's husband or a raging vampire, even if he does get tossed across a room. The words that come out of his mouth evoke the usual tough P.I. genre but his look is far from it. And yet it works.

My favorite actor here though is Sam Huntington as Marcus. He truly has the funniest lines in the film. But it's not just the lines but how he delivers them that make them funny as well as the physical aspects he displays here. After watching him you'll first find yourself saying ""I know I've seen this guy before"" and then discover you'll want to search out other movies he has been in.

This is not over the top film making with an extensive budget to bring about special effects and more. But it works. And it entertains. And there's not much more a person could hope for in a movie these days.",1332201600,,4377,4.46558197747184

If you like slasher horror movies, Twilight or your typical zombie flick, you will most likely not like this UNLESS you also enjoy other types of movies with a little more depth to them. The plot was compelling, the acting was decent and the special effects were good.

I liked everything about this movie except for Brandon Routh, who I found woefully bland and boring.  Unfortunately, his character dominated this movie start to finish.  (If you can't get past his overly staid performance, you might just like it for the vampires, zombies, and various other critters.)  I quickly found that I couldn't get past his somber approach to everything.  His narration was a bit of a snooze, it only served to slow things down.  There was nothing glib about his vain attempt to appear gritty and hardcore like the PIs of yesteryear.  I've seen rocks with more personality.  His lack of a performance was even more glaring when situated next to scenery chewing over the top performances by everyone else.  The dead may have risen, but his somnambulant walk through certainly didn't.  The filmmakers would have been wiser to devote more screen time to Sam Huntington, the hilarious sidekick.  But they didn't.  Making this one dull entry in a genre already packed with better offerings.

4552636,2,B0053WQE6O,"<strong>Dylan Dog: Dead of Night</strong> (Kevin Munroe, 2011)

I'm a huge enough fan of Tiziano Sclavi's that I new eventually I was going to have to break down and see <em>Dylan Dog: Dead of Night</em>, the first American-produced piece of film based on a Sclavi work, and the first piece of film at all based on his stuff since Michele Soavi's close-to-perfect <em>Dellamorte Dell'Amore</em> from 1994. Both of those things point to me writing a long, rambling review about how much better European movies are than American movies, especially given that every other movie Soavi has made has been credible at best, but that would be too easy. I'm going to try and ignore the fact that Sclavi wrote the source material for this and judge it by itself. Otherwise, I would hate this so much I would have to attempt to eat the DVD. Which would be difficult since I caught it on Netflix Streaming.

This is the place where I'd normally try to put a short plot synopsis, but let's face it: there's not much plot here. There's Dylan Dog (<em>Chuck</em>'s Brandon Routh) and his annoying sidekick Marcus (<em>Fanboys</em>' Sam Huntington, trying to act like Shia LaBeouf in <em>Constantine</em> but coming off more Adam Sandler in... well, anything, really), and there are a lot of vampires. And a love interest in Elizabeth (<em>La Monja</em>'s Anita Briem, a fine young actress whose manager seems to make very, very bad choices). And... an otherwise pretty decent cast, wasted. Peter Stormare, Taye Diggs, Dan Braverman, Laura Spencer, Kurt Angle (okay, threw that one in to see if you were paying attention). None of them manage to make this good. I'm not as down on it as many people, probably because I've seen very few movies so far actually made in 2011 and so can't call anything the worst of the year yet, but I saw two or three dozen older-but-recent movies last <em>month</em> worse than this incoherent mess. At least Routh and Briem are very pretty when no one's asking them to actually act--which would be this entire movie. That, however, is not enough reason to put up with Marcus. **",1327449600,,2095,4.816666666666666

Extras are bland for my tastes, but then I have Fangoria as bedside material anyways.

4552640,3,B0053WQE6O,"I'm not familiar with the source material for this so I came to it without any preconceptions. This movie is a shame. Given everything I can't say it could ever have been real good but it could have been so much better.

Here's the scoop. Dylan is a private eye, in New Orleans, working on low level, grunt type cases. He's got a go-for, Marcus, who yearns to be a real partner. He gets involved in a case stuck in the middle of a war between Vampires and Werewolves. He was hoping not to work that realm again, but he gets sucked in. Seems there is a stolen relic which, when embedded in a host, will release Belial, a really evil demon who will decimate all mankind.

First off: New Orleans has a sense of mystery all it's own. It's a great setting for this type of flick, but not one character speaks with a southern accent. None of the music is of the region and they do nothing to give the viewer the flavor of the area. Not the French Quarter or the homes or the Bayou area. Attending to that alone would have raised the quality of the movie immeasurably. Then there's Dylan himself. He looks like a young Christopher Reeve and that's the problem. He looks too young for the role. And he acts too ""cute."" I felt the part needed way more gravity. His sidekick, Marcus, on the other hand is a hoot. He way outshines Dylan. His lines are better and he really put a stitch in me with his delivery. He makes this movie. Plus....I just didn't believe it. If Vampires, Werewolves and The Undead were that prevalent anywhere we'd all know about it. I couldn't suspend my disbelief. It might have worked in the comic, but it doesn't work here. Surprisingly, a lot of similar movies move along well only to drop the ball on the 5 yard line. This had a really good climax. It was much better than I expected given the rest of the movie.

This is not a bad watch. It's fun enough and certain things (Marcus for one) really make it worthwhile. I'm just peeved that so little more could have been done to make it so much better.",1323907200,3,2020,4.296587926509186
4552641,3,B0053WQE6O,"Liked it. Would've liked it a lot more had the filmmakers made some effort toward originality - the plot is a very well-worn retread.

I recognize that they were working from an established comic book character, thus having to stick to certain creative parameters. However, that doesn't have to mean limiting oneself to a comic book expectation. 'Blade' and 'Captain America' are examples of taking comic book characters and imbuing them with depth and substance. Additionally, there were some poor, but easily correctable, choices made by Director Kevin Munroe - critical changes and easy fixes to the production that would've made this so much better.

First, they should've used a North American performer in the key role of Elizabeth. Icelandic actress Anita Briem's accent is blatantly obvious and makes absolutely no sense coming from a daughter of Louisiana. To say her European lilt is distracting and extremely off-putting would be an understatement. Truthfully, even if they had written her character as a transplanted immigrant, she still couldn't carry the role because...

Secondly, even though the calendar says Ms. Briem was only 29 when filming began - she looks older. In fact, much older. Much, much older.

It wouldn't surprise me in the least if her published/casting call birthdate was fudged by more than few years. Happens all the time in many professions, not just the movie industry. Although selective aging occurs in a much greater percentage within the acting world, much more than anyone wants to admit. Ever wonder why TMZ, so infamous for busting and exposing celebrities, never looks into the real birth dates of so many of their quarry?

A younger US or Canadian actress in this role would've made this flick so much more enjoyable.

Thirdly, they should've given Routh a different haircut. It's distracting when he essentially looks like Clark Kent - the only other major role he's had in his career. Some actors can get away with it because they have the thespian skill to transform their inner selves, but those artists are few and far between. And Routh, while a capable performer, doesn't have the acting chops to pull it off. The filmmakers needed to play every trick in the book in order to distance themselves from Routh's other films. A high-n-tight would've done wonders, even going bald with a strong padlock combo would've strengthened the character immeasurably.

I would've written the whole flick off, but this production had a savior in the form of Dylan's goofy sidekick - Marcus, played by Sam Huntington. Insanely hilarious as the well-meaning schmuck who gets much more than he bargains for when he's unceremonially transformed from eager nice guy into insecure zombie. Dude rescued the movie in my opinion; taking it from the bottom of the dung pile and giving it, no pun intended, a pulse.

Glad some actors realize that playing second fiddle can often bring them equal accolade and fame. Too many should-be-character-actors are pushing hard to become leads, only to discover their particular schtick has a limited shelf appeal; often overplaying their overly common credentials. I don't fault an actor reaching for the brass ring, but Hollywood, like humanity as a whole, has a short-term memory. I honestly believe acting classes should include history lessons which focus on performers like Walter Brennan, Elisha Cook Jr., C.Thomas Howell and Michael Ironside. Actors who wound up with a lifetime of paychecks despite taking second chair to the headliners.

Overall I found the film entertaining enough. It has that SciFi Weekend filler schtick to it, but that's a compliment. I'm a huge fan of the short-lived series '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dresden-Files/dp/B000QUEQ4U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dresden Files</a>' - and this flick has that kind of vibe.

Couple of notes:

- It's very odd that so many low-to-middle budget films I've screened recently use older European actresses in roles that are meant to be filled by younger American performers. Strange.

- I realize the filmmakers were trying for the old school noir edge - i.e. Voice Over Narration, dark contrasting shots, etc. - but I have to admit at being deeply frustrated that they missed an opportunity for noir coolness: Dog's choice of a Webley .455 didn't include Prideaux speed loaders. C'mon, loaders have been in use since the 1890's, and that's about as old school as it gets.",1323388800,,4463,5.2092050209205025
4552642,2,B0053WQE6O,"When I saw the trailer for Dylan Dog I was immediately hooked.  Zombies?  Vampires? Werewolves?  You had me at ""braaaaains!"" But for some reason Dylan Dog flew through theaters, which was the first clue that this dog is tired. Spoiler Dogs ahead!

Inspired by a comic book with an international fan base, the film version of Dylan Dog is a human intermediary in a world dominated by the World of Darkness-style supernaturals. It's a noir, complete with Dylan's voice narrating, beautiful dames, a haunted past, and a murder to avenge.  Heavy stuff that doesn't necessarily gel well with modern audiences, but like The Dresden Files, the supernatural and noir can mix well together with the right talent and writing.

Unfortunately, Dylan Dog (Brandon Routh) has neither.  His lines are lame, and Routh - who looks like Christopher Reeve but lacks his subtle charm - sleepwalks through the role.  And that's ironic, given that his sidekick Marcus (Sam Huntington) ends up becoming a zombie.  Syfy fans might know Huntington as the werewolf Josh from Being Human.  He's essentially in the same role here.  As the comic relief, Marcus easily outshines the grim Dog, who wears just one expression - a pouty glare that Routh also used throughout the Superman movie.

The writing is lazy too.  Werewolves are regularly referred to as ""the undead"" right along with vampires and zombies; there's no effort to even explain how all these supernatural creatures work, or why one becomes a particular breed vs. another; and the ironic twist - that monster hunters are the real threat in a monster society bound by rules - is lost in unlikely love interest Elizabeth (Anita Briem). There's some reference to an even meaner monster who, in addition to being pure evil, apparently gobbled most of the CGI budget, but by the time he shows up on screen it's hard to care.

In a world stuffed to the fangs with supernatural monsters, Dylan Dog fumbles the only chance to distinguish itself - zombie humor.  Marcus ends up with a dark-skinned arm after losing his original in a fight, but the film completely forgets about this, only to bring it up at the end of the film. That's right, Marcus walks around with a white arm throughout the rest of the movie because even Dylan Dog's writers got bored.

Dylan and his sidekick share some funny quips and dialogue while on a quest to stop bad people / monsters, and find a relic. I agree with other reviewers that main actor, Brandon Routh (of ""Superman Returns"" fame) is a bit dry, uninspired, and not quite as humorous in his line deliveries...

Werewolves, zombies and vampires live as mafia-type families in various areas of the city.  Dylan is called back into action(he had retired) when a werewolf attacks and kills a human.  Together with the victim's daughter(who you know he's gonna bone), and his partner, Marcus(recently made a zombie), he tries to track down an ancient artifact that will resurrect, Belial, an indestructible juggernaut of destruction!
This movie is a Frankenstein stitch job of concepts from practically every horror and horror-comedy you've ever seen.  Violence is rather tame(hence the PG-13 rating), and the comedy aspect is high.  Some of it works, some of it falls flat.  Most of it revolves around the wisecracking(of course) sidekick and his trying to come to terms with being a zombie-His complexion goes to crap, his diet now consists of worms(which he consistently refuses), and he now needs to use household cleaners to combat his rotten stench.  One scene has him and Dylan going to a ""body shop"" where zombies purchase replacement body parts(Marcus gets a replacement arm, but it's black since they were out of caucasian-hardy har har).
Taye Diggs is in charge of the vampire clan and owns a dance club where vampire blood is distributed to mortals as a kind of narcotic.  Why does every vampire film anymore have to feature at least one scene in a dance club?  Damn you, Blade!
Diggs is the one with plans to resurrect Belial, so he's Dylan's biggest problem.
Dylan himself is kind of a bland character.  A kind of pretty boy hard boiled detective who's hair never gets messed up, and always looks ready to shoot for GQ.  He has silver brass knuckles for fighting werewolves and wood tipped bullets for vampires.  He has great lines like when he's punched by a werewolf and responds, ""You hit like a vampire"".  He has a couple of fistfights with an enormous, musclebound hulk of a zombie, and manages to beat the snot out of it.  I know you really have to suspend disbelief for this kind of movie, but watching him beat up this enormous monster is just flat out silly.
When Belial shows up, it's a bit of a letdown.  Yeah, he looks cool(kind of a cross between the Alien and ""Darkness"" from the movie Legend), but this guy is supposed to be walking chaos who's laid a path of death and destruction throughout the ages, yet all it takes to kill him is-SPOILER HERE!!!!!!!!-a few slashes in his skin and having him get hit by lightning.  Not as threatening as he looks I guess, but it is rather tricky to get someone to be hit by lightning I suppose.
Anyway, it's interesting enough to keep you watching.  Some cool creatures and some legitimate laughs.  But in the end, it's just a watered down version of stuff you've seen done better many times before in many different movies.",1316649600,,3407,4.740677966101695
4552652,5,B0053WQE6O,i don't understand why this movie got so many bad reviews i thought the movie was excellent. i mean if you are into monsters and stuff you'll love this film plus it's based on a comic book. this movie is great. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend that you do,1316044800,,271,4.037037037037037
4552653,4,B0053WQE6O,"Nowadays Dylan Dog, down and out bloke, is more your typical private eye, maybe seedier than most, maybe specializing in tracking straying spouses and taking snapshots of them in the act of straying. But, once upon a time, Dylan Dog was relevant. He was THE paranormal investigator, the one human entrusted by the supernatural community to act as their impartial arbitrator, to examine and probe and poke into things when one of their own crosses the line. But that was some time ago.

You're not even aware. Amongst the unwitting normal folks lurk the creatures of the night, blending in, rubbing elbows with us, reigning in their dark impulses, and so surviving. This is especially true in a place like New Orleans, and a wilder neck of the woods you'll be hard put to find. New Orleans invented ""Laissez les bon temps rouler"" and ""Let your inhibitions go."" In N'awlins the monsters effortlessly blend in. And when it's that easy, sometimes a monster slips up. Enough that it shakes Dylan Dog out of his deep doldrums. With some reluctance - but to revenge the savaging of a friend - he takes on a case uptown regarding a girl's murdered father, murdered by a werewolf. Armed with wood- and silver-tipped bullets, Dylan Dog attempts to get to the bottom of things before a war erupts among the werewolf, zombie, and vampire clans, all of whom used to be part of his clientele. Once upon a time, Dylan Dog flashed a business card emblazoned with the jaunty phrase: ""No pulse? No problem."" That's kinda fly.

DYLAN DOG: DEAD OF NIGHT is based on the Italian comic book series by Tiziano Sclavi, and if you've had a chance to read the stories, then it'll strike you that the film is a bit of a departure, in that it doesn't quite hold on to the original source's heightened sense of melancholy and surrealism. But the black humor survives for the most part. DYLAN DOG: DEAD OF NIGHT, if you must categorize it, falls in the realm of horror comedy, in the same vein as CEMETERY MAN. (And, no wonder, as the central character in CEMETERY MAN was also created by Tiziano Sclavi.)

I like this movie, and maybe I should feel guilty about that. But I'm always jonesing for these sorts of pictures. DYLAN DOG: DEAD OF NIGHT doesn't have the outrageous charm and sheer quotability of, say, ARMY OF DARKNESS, and Brandon Routh certainly doesn't flaunt the iconic appeal of Bruce Campbell. But I thought there were some fantastic touches in DYLAN DOG. I enjoyed the noirish feel and the brisk pace. I appreciated the film's worldbuilding, and Dylan Dog's unique place in it. The film's secret weapon is Sam Huntington whose performance as Dylan's sidekick Marcus serves to lighten the mood. Huntington gets some pretty funny one-liners. The zombie support group sub-plot is damn amusing. I'm rating this film 3.5 out of 5 stars.

I wish that the tone were even darker, and I know, I know, this after my mentioning Huntington's funny contributions. I wish that the story had gone for it more, that it didn't feel so much like a television episode. In Dylan Dog's investigations, he learns that a whole bunch of supernatural creatures are moving heaven and earth to locate the Heart of Belial, a mystic cross-shaped artifact which could - and stop me if you've heard this one before - summon a rampaging demon. That plot device is so old it's at the porch and yelling for the kids to get off its lawn.

Brandon Routh did a good job, I thought. Physically and in youth, he matched the Dylan Dog in the comics. But I wonder how much better the film would've been if the Dog had been played by someone with a more world-weary air about him. If you'd seen CAST A DEADLY SPELL and WITCH HUNT and Fred Ward as private eye Harry Philip Lovecraft, then I don't need to paint a picture. Fred Ward is about as world-weary as it gets, and I don't mean his gristled, broken-down looks. Still, you know what, I don't want to dump on this film too strenuously. Despite my griping, I'm craving a sequel, and if Brandon Routh reprises his role, so be it. It's not the worst thing in the world. (The worst thing in the world is, of course, KILLER KLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE... or pretty much anything Uwe Boll has directed.)",1315440000,5,4192,4.606425702811245
4552654,2,B0053WQE6O,"Here is a film I'm surprised was not a SYFY Origional Presentation. It was boring, and kind of silly. I donno maybe addult men who somehow still collect comic books (a result of being too poor or dumb to as a kid?) Usually men who want to take advantage of others by overpricing them. This movie was like Coloumbo in his youth. I didn't find the charecter intersting enough to keep me clued to the tele... it was just cheaply done and so bad. You'd have to be a fan of the comic book immature crowd to dig this it offered no imagination, no real plot no anything. sorry, I was hoping to love it... but even the actors were a bit on the cheesy size. If you like this you will LOVE The Midnight Hour from the late 80's and even that was better than this one. Sorry.",1315008000,2,763,4.12751677852349
4552655,3,B0053WQE6O,After reading some harsh reviews I thought this was going to be awful. I actually thought it was pretty good as far as b movie standards go. One thing I found refreshing was that it wasn't bombarded with CGI effects. There were some genuinely funny moments as well as some pretty cool monster effects. all in all you could do much worse.,1314748800,,337,4.451612903225806
4552656,5,B0053WQE6O,It's a shame that this movie did so poorly in the Box Office. It had quick dialog and would have done great as a HBO series. For just fun entertainment I pity the fool who passes this up.,1314662400,3,187,3.9473684210526314
4552657,5,B0053WQE6O,"Right before I saw this, I had heard from two people that this was the stupidest movie ever made, and an ""insult to one's intelligence"". Perhaps I am not as intelligent as those other amateur critics, but I loved it.

Now, to be clear, this was a very silly movie; but...that's the point! Watching this is not meant to be an exercise in realism, but an enjoyable, silly experience. The whole point of the film is goofiness. Not to put too fine a point on it, but the description makes pretty clear that this is not a movie striving for realism. We have a human liaison between vampires and werewolves, setting out to uncover a monster-murderer. To me, that does not scream ""brain food."" (Although, when you start throwing in the zombies, I probably shouldn't be using the words ""brain"" and ""food"" in the same sentence).

With that understanding -- that this is by no means a serious movie -- this is a great film. It is sort of a parody of the old detective films, with an admirable faux darkness and grittiness -- admirable because of how absurd this serious tone is when you're talking about zombies, vampires and werewolves. Add in some of the really clever bits (like the body shop), and you've got yourself a winner!

The story (mild spoilers) follows Dylan Dog, the former human-monster-liaison, who is now a small time private eye. When a monster kills an importer of antiquities, and his daughter brings Dylan onto the case, he, his sidekick and the heiress are in for a crazy adventure (complete with zombies, vampires, werewolves and monster hunters) and a wee bit of a mystery. (end spoilers)

Now, the CGI and the monsters are not top quality; some of the acting is pretty lousy; and a few of the sets are less than awe inspiring. However, the main actors are all pretty good, and there is nothing offensively bad about any of the weaker points in the film. This is a fun, lighthearted flick, which should be viewed as it was meant: goofy monster comedy.

4.5/5 stars, for achieving what it meant to in a very fun, enjoyable way.",1314576000,3,2041,4.596153846153846
4552658,3,B0053WQE6O,"This could have been such an amazing movie but it fell flat. The main character - Dylan Dog - wasn't a very good actor. I'm sorry but he's pretty one dimensional. It felt very rushed and MANY questions weren't answered. (Such as how exactly was the big zombie created, and what is Dylan? He was too tough to be completely human.) It had an interesting plot, it had some twists, I loved Dylan's sidekick Marcus (who really made the movie.)

But there were so many plot holes, so many things left out. I felt like it was the second movie. It would have been better if this movie was about Dylan's past. Maybe show us what happened to Cassandra. Like I said through the whole movie, if it was a television show it would be great, cause they could slow it down, pace themselves, and explain things.

So I enjoyed it (mostly for Marcus) but it was flawed. 3 stars only because I'm easily entertained, because I love fantasy, and because Marcus cracked me up.",1314489600,,953,4.44

4552660,5,B0053WQE6O,"This is easily one of the better movies I've seen in quite some time. The plot revolves around a private eye who used to be a peace keeper between werewolves, vampires, and zombies. One of the things that struck me right off the bat is that the acting is excellent. The characters personalities are very likable and they all play their roles very well. One of the biggest reasons this movie works well is that it intentionally doesn't take itself too seriously. Lastly, having a small budget, the movie didn't rely too heavily on special effects. But the few special effects added (see giant zombie and evil demon) were done superb.

I would recommend this movie to anyone. Really, its hard not to enjoy this film regardless of age, race, or gender. Its serious enough and with enough action to keep most men interested without being over the top gore and horror which would turn off many from a female audience. Its just fun.",1314316800,3,926,4.646341463414634
4552661,1,B0053WQE6O,"Was looking forward to see what Brandon Roth was going to do with his career after Superman.

How ridiculous, my HDTV was bought in 2007 from SONY.  I couldn't believe it.  After several tries I gave up and searched the internet for a solution. I found out that this movie incorporates something call ""Cinavia"" copy protection and if you don't have ""current"" players and TVs you just can't watch.

Oh well, I guess I got to check from now on if movie have ""Cinavia"" before I buy.  I'm not buying a new TV just to watch one movie. Will make a nice gift to someone!  Everyone else: you have been warned!",1314230400,2,756,4.364285714285714

I can't see paying movie theater money for this though.  Brandon Routh didn't really seem to have a plot other than to ride around the city and graveyard looking for people to shoot at. On the other hand Taye Diggs was pretty hot in his wardrobe playing the part of a savvy nightclub owner.",1313884800,,492,4.279569892473118
4552664,5,B0053WQE6O,"You know, as far as your normal blockbuster type movies go, this wouldn't rank very highly, but as a B movie, this is one of the best. Actually, it kind of rides the line between a movie you'd see at the theater and a movie you would catch on the Sci-Fi network or whatever they call it these days.
A fair amount of money was put into the production of this movie, and so the effects were actually pretty good. Additionally, the story was both cool and quite fun, and the casting was great in my opinion. Dylan was a good character, his sidekick Marcus was hilarious, and all the various nuances of the world as it is presented were well thought out and appropriate. Like the Zombie Support Group for helping zombies cope with their condition, or the ""number 9"" at the local greasy spoon.
I don't see why people had a problem with this. I personally had a blast watching it. I laughed often, and enjoyed it immensely.
So, my 5 star ranking reflects the type of movie it is, and how well done and appropriate it was for the genre, plus the overall charm of the movie. That's right, i said charm. It is a quirky, pleasing film.",1313798400,2,1125,4.3364928909952605
4552665,3,B0053WQE6O,"I don't know anything about the comic book which inspired this movie, only what I've learned from fellow reviewers.  It has elements of TV's ANGEL and MOONLIGHT and definitely has its tongue (or Fangs) in its cheek.  Its main flaws are its failure to clarify just who Dylan Dog is; the muddled and chaotic finale; and the film's poor lighting, perhaps to de-focus the special effects, which weren't that bad.
One-time Superman Brandon Routh strutted his strong and silent mojo almost too well, never really making us care.  Sam Huntington's zombiefied sidekick is hilarious and provides welcome comic relief.  Peter Stormare is good but in a near-cameo role.  Taye Diggs is...well just Taye Diggs.
Since DYLAN DOG wasn't successful at the box office, I don't think sequels are in the future.

Outside of a few funny moments this sleeping ""dog"" of a movie should have been left to lie (unmade preferably).

Well you aren't alone, even if the character is a fairly popular Italian comic creation that even partially inspired the cult horror classic Cemetery Man, but I digress.  In Dylan Dog: Dead of Night, Brandon Routh (star of other comic book movies Superman Returns and Scott Pilgrim VS The World) stars as the titular hero, who has a shattered past and finds himself drawn back into the world of paranormal monsters, which include vampires, zombies, and werewolves.  The film's story is all over the place, but despite that it is a pretty fun ride for the most part.  All the other actors involved, Sam Huntington, Peter Storemare, Taye Diggs, and pro wrassler Kurt Angle among others, all play with tongue firmly in cheek, while Routh plays the proceedings a little too seriously given the content here.

For some reason, Dylan Dog was barely released in US theaters and many of the better-known film crtics trashed it. Honestly, I believe many film critics (even the un-official ones, such as blog critics) need to lighten up a bit. Dylan Dog is certainly not a perfect film. It's not even a film for everyone. It has a speficic audience, which is a big one.

Dylan Dog is a nice, ligh-hearted hybrid of horror, comedy, and action adventure genres. The two male leads have likeable chemistry and the villians are well portrayed by some familiar faces. The cinematography is appropriately atomospheric, but also comfortable. Most importantly, all the main elements of the genres aforementioned are equally balanced through the film.
