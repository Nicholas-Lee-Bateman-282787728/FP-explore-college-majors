8180688,3,B000NQQ4II,"The Gunman from Bodie, 1941 film

It was a dark and stormy night. A rider sought shelter for himself and his horse. He entered the house to find two bodies, killed by cattle thieves. Only a live baby. The stranger found fresh milk for the baby. We hear about another massacre by rustlers on a nearby ranch. Mr. Wyatt advises Miss Alice Borden to sell her ranch. Can they catch those rustlers? The stranger Bronson brings the baby there. The new cook does not please his customers. Wyatt wants to hire Bronson. Marshal McCall shows up, looking for a wanted man. Miss Borden warns Bronson to leave. McCall goes to see the sheriff, who is out to lunch. At the saloon McCall meets Cook at the bar. McCall doesn't waste time. Bronson visits Wyatt. Cook is jailed. Will he talk? Not if they can do something. Bodie Bronson shows he is in charge. Is someone trying to take over all the ranches?

The head of the rustlers plans to grab Nelson's cattle. ""Boy, is he sore!"" There is a meeting at the Borden ranch. Can Bodie save Joe? Steve doesn't like his new boss. At the saloon he meets McCall, there is a fight. Steve goes to Wyatt's office, McCall follows him, shots are fired. ""I can't believe it."" McCall explains to the ranchers why Wyatt is behind the rustlers. Wyatt is lured into showing his hand. Bodie tells Wyatt of a hide-out that's safe. It is a box canyon. The whole gang is rounded up. And so the Rough Riders go their separate ways, until they ride again.

This series had the usual plot where these US Marshals would work undercover to expose a criminal gang and the prominent person who was behind them. This formula worked for years. Buck Jones and four hundred others were killed in the Cocoanut Grove fire in Boston in November 1942. This restaurant ignored the fire safety laws so customers were trapped in rooms that had no fire exits. Tim McCoy rejoined the Army as a Colonel. Many other stars from the 1930s saw the end of their careers in the 1940s. Note how cowboys did not carry a canteen for water.",1356912000,,2020,4.468834688346884
