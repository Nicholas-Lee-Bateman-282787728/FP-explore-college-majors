6263872,4,B00IHXIL44,Nice movie about a little known subculture. Looked like it was based on fact. Some beliefs about life that could be absorbed by the world today. Liked it.,1405209600,,154,4.535714285714286
6263873,3,B00IHXIL44,"Good movie about the Russian (or is it Siberian) criminal code.  I don't know how accurate or true to life it is but interesting never the less.  Malkovich has the same accent he uses in other movies requiring an accent.  The tattoos are those used by the Russian ""mafia"".  Worth a look.",1404950400,3,287,4.461538461538462

6263877,1,B00IHXIL44,"This is an AWEFUL movie. I was expecting to learn about a period in Russian history.. What I got was a slow moving, poorly acted movie. I just could not understand why the characters were speaking English with Russian accent. At one point I thought maybe they all have moved to USA  but no they were still in Russia. Why Russians living in Russia  speaking English with accent. I get it.. This was made by English speaking people for English speaking viewers so why the accent?.. Very stupid movie and very disappointed in John Malkovich... But you have to pay the bills somehow. You can't just wait for great roles ... This movie deserves no stars!!!",1401580800,3,651,4.603448275862069
6263878,4,B00IHXIL44,"Negatives:
1. A slow narrative similar to what you might find telling a story by a campfire. You are either captivated or put to sleep. Works either way.
2. Translating from book to script there are some lost periods of time and some flashbacks that can be disruptive.
Positives:
1. Great cinematography showing a place and lifestyle most of us have little knowledge of. Filmed in Lithuania and Italy to represent nearby southwestern USSR as one of the locations in that country where large populations were transplanted for political or cultural reasons.
2. A code of conduct where your status in society justified some criminal acts, but only by the rules. The film captures the indoctrination of those rules from an early age to adulthood as we follow two, best friends, boys who grow into pursued and pursuer.
3. Actors, incidentally from many nations, conveyed their characters in a naturalistic way so you never feel as if you're watching people recite lines of script.",1401235200,,975,4.951219512195122
6263879,2,B00IHXIL44,I was greatly disappointed when I watched this movie. John Malkovich  shouldn't have accepted this role. His reputation as an excellent actor is at stake now. This movie is slow and boring like Russian movies. Don't waste your time and money.,1400198400,,242,4.902439024390244
6263880,2,B00IHXIL44,"Look if you want to know what happens after the fall of superpowerfull nation,...and you want to see how life was for the Russians,in the past 3 decades...you might enjoy this movie.
I lost intrest ,...it wasn't for me !! You might enjoy it....
I was expecting more (action-dramma) than what this film could deliver...
(It aint no) Bronx Tale!!!",1400025600,3,345,4.766666666666667
6263881,4,B00IHXIL44,"This is an unusual movie. Its about an oral culture that actually represents them as an oral culture. The script is a poem, the lines are poetry. John Malkovich knows this, his performance is all giving, he is quite the master. The young in the cast might know this but are learning as the story retells a couple decades chronologically. The story, sort of incidental to the entire depiction is quite simple and well told, in the end you know what has happened. The depicted people are rooted in Siberia but were forcibly relocated across the entire USSR; what might be historically true, or not, Im sure I cant say. That said, the Siberia that inspired Kropotkin is also here.",1423008000,,677,4.65
6263882,4,B00IHXIL44,"A John Malkovich movie is already saying something ABOUT the movie - it's going to be odd.  Deadly Code is no exception.  Deadly Code is about four boyhood friends who were forced Siberian transplants during the Soviet Stalin era.  The code by which they live is plain enough but when one crosses the line, to what ends must the code be upheld?  This movie answers that question.

Kulyma, Gagarin (presumably because his real name was Yuri), Mel and Vitalic are the boyhood friends in question.  Fast forward a decade and enter Xenya, a ""gift from God"".  According to the Siberian code, ""gifts from God"" must be protected at all costs.  Should something happen, then God must be appeased by the reprisal.  Xenya falls for Kulyma and, it might seem, Gagarin.  Kulyma is imprisoned and released after Grandfather Kuzya (John Maklovich) greases the appropriate palms.  Only Kulyma's release comes at a price.

This is an intense movie.  It you're not in the mood for drama, don't bother.  You won't like it.  If you have problems watching Malkovich, you might not like it.",1419811200,,1069,4.828729281767956
6263883,5,B00IHXIL44,After watching....I wanted more. I was intrigued by the history and lore of the culture in the movie. Great acting....Great story...Great F***ing movie!,1418860800,,152,5.6521739130434785
6263884,5,B00IHXIL44,This move is amazing.,1418688000,,21,4.5
6263885,2,B00IHXIL44,"When used properly, John Malkovich is the best of the best when it comes to playing the bad guy. In his latest film, Deadly Code, Malkovich is playing the Grandfather of a Siberian crime syndicate and much like Brando in the Godfather, is used sparely to impart words of wisdom on his young decedents. Siberia is one of the coldest and most desolate places on the planet. When a criminal is too dangerous to even be put in the jail of a major Russian city, they are dumped into Siberia. Crime is rampant and everything is run by organized crime families, who's strict code of loyalty and honor puts even the Italians to shame. Kolyma (Vilius Turnalavicius) is the grandson and the film is split between Kolyma in the army, hunting down a wanted man, and his time growing up in a crime family under his Grandfathers guidance. Mafia movies traditionally follow a format and this film was no different, with the except of the setting, so when I heard it was the Godfather of Russian organized crime and started John Malkovich, I wondered how it was possible that I'd never heard of it, well now I know. There are these crazy rules and code of honor that these guys live by, making them gangsters who aren't really violent. They simply steal from the government to help their community. In a real sense, it's about sophisticated, responsible criminals, helping people, and avoiding the police. While honorable, it makes for an extremely slow moving film, add to that all the Russian actors trying to speak English, and you have a film that's somewhat hard to even understand. Subtitles and some more action would have helped, but so would have a more experienced cast. Most of these guys have no other listings on IMDB and the inexperience shows. The story of Deadly Code seems like a good idea, but when you have a lack of action, mixed with inexperienced actors, speaking in a way that is barely understandable, you have a very uninteresting movie that is more than somewhat hard to watch.",1417392000,2,1987,4.68
6263886,5,B00IHXIL44,"Malkovich's character in this movie has such wisdom, character, and leadership that I doubt he'll ever find a better role.  This was a wonderful, gripping movie with a meaningful, coherent storyline.  This is a formula I wish we'd see more often, one which proves more action, noise, and needlessly complicating events thrown in for effect are not what make a film memorable.  I agree with the other reviewer who felt that the picture and blurb failed to convey the excellence waiting to be discovered in this unusual tale.  It's well-worth watching, really a beautiful experience.",1417219200,,581,5.08421052631579
6263887,5,B00IHXIL44,"Do NOT listen to the negative reviews (as few as they are). Not many people have even heard about this movie. This movie requires a bit more intelligence, a bit more of a mature mind than most. I think a lot of people read the description and think they are getting a shoot em up movie about gangsters or something... In reality this is an INCREDIBLY DEEP story. I have recently found out this movie is BITTERLY real. That this portrayal of this tragic era is based on actual events, and the atmosphere is portrayed with an increidbly believability. You don't ever question that this is where the movie takes place, and not where it was FILMED. This story is about two friends, immersed in a life of crime, born out of the injustice of Stalin's relocation. About how one tribe, Siberians, kept to a code of honor, despite being forced to survive via crime. This is not exciting mafia, guns, drugs, and sex. This is a deeply moving story about two best friends and a strange weaving of paths they take, one time frame as they are very young, and the next much later in life, which i won't reveal spoilers. If you want to see a movie unlike most of the movies that are around today... This movie is for more mature people, with the ability to follow and comprehend something more complex than a 'gang' movie. Again the description is misleading, the movie is not about gangs, it's about this relationship between 2 friends growing up in a time harder and harsher than 17th century slavery... It involves understanding this deep FACTUAL, HISTORICAL, atmosphere and... it leaves you speechless. I've had trouble forming any real congruent explanation for this movie, particularly because it was NOTHING AT ALL what I expected. All I can say is WOW. Never have given a movie 5 stars on this site.",1415750400,7,1791,4.617554858934169
6263888,5,B00IHXIL44,"Great storytelling, great characters, acting.  Captivating.",1413936000,,59,8.833333333333334

6263890,2,B00IHXIL44,"This purports to be a film-adaptation of a autobiographical memoir (proven to be completely fraudulent -- the book has never been published in Russia!).  It spans the childhood - to - young adult period of a group of insular Siberians who live in a structured criminal community with a strict 'code', though the context for it is never well explained.  It's clearly borrows plot and structure from ""Once Upon a Time in America"", but it fails in all the ways that the latter film succeeds.  John Malkovitch (?sp) seems like an expensive afterthought to rescue the movie from film festival rejection.  The story is non-linear, with annoying elliptical jolts that seem inserted due to incompetent editing or just writer's block.  The subtext of the relationship of the main character with a developmentally delayed girl seems forced, like adding water softener to a poisoned well.  The movie is overly long, incoherent, and shallow (especially the false maudlin parts).  Worse, it rings false -- willing suspension of disbelief is hard with this one.  ONE GOOD THING:  It's beautifully shot -- so you could conceivably turn the sound down a little (much of the dialogue is unintelligible anyway without turning subtitles on -- for the English, not the Russian), have a couple of drinks, and watch the beautiful scenery.",1411862400,,1316,5.055555555555555
6263891,5,B00IHXIL44,"This movie is a ride into the past, although the present is clear. It is dynamic in its subtle, yet demanding, cause to see the truth. I watched it without an interruption in my concentration. I watched it with my mind and my heart (although I mean my emotions I must wax poetic)  It should be seen by psychotherapists, teachers, thinkers and philosophers alike. I wish to buy it so it will never leave my side.",1411084800,3,411,4.407894736842105
6263892,1,B00IHXIL44,"This might be a good movie, but who can tell? It's impossible to get past the first few minutes of Malkovich's hopelessly phony Russian accent!

See Ridley Scott's ""The Duellists"" and you'll see that two American actors, Harvey Keitel and Keith Carradine can be very believable as French officers in Napoleon's army - without resorting to faking French accents.

Big mistake, director Gabriele Salvatores. Observe and learn from your betters.",1410998400,2,442,5.3
6263893,1,B00IHXIL44,"An irredeemably wretched ""movie"" about two friends in some pseudo-soviet criminal underworld living by a ""deadly code"".  Cliched and clumsy attempts at edginess which pale in pure wretchedness with the inability of any of the actors to evince even an approximation  of a Siberian accent.  With Malkovich apparently playing a tattooed sesame street vampire in late stage dementia uttering (with the most cringe-worthy  accent imaginable) such insipid homilies as ""Protect zee fingers.  Protect zee fingers and you protect zee soul"" (while teaching a cross-eyed boy how to stab a pig carcass).  So deep!  So edgy!

Formulaic and forgettable tripe.",1410825600,3,645,5.444444444444445

6263897,5,B00IHXIL44,"Don't judge a book by it's cover... Title and cover are very poor representative of the film. If you took Stand by Me, Warriors, Legends of the Fall, and Dr. Zivago, put them in a jar, shook well, and spill out, then you would have this work. Not to call this epic by any means, as it is clearly a 90 min. movie, but I would consider this Art.

I thought I would get Malkovich biting adversaries ears off, then giving rambling speeches, but none of that. While it is very violent, the message if one of ethics, tempered by environment. In my opinion, a very deep tale was told in it's simplest form. It is mainly about a group of friends becoming men where the smallest choices cast eternal dies. Forget any preconceived notions about Malkovich, pop some corn, and just enjoy the tale. Be prepared; it is rough and sad. But it is worthy of the time spent watching. Very nice direction and production, as well as technical artistry. Not at all what I was expecting.",1408147200,6,964,4.415730337078652
