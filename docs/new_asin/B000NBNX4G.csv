2764268,1,B000NBNX4G,"This was terrible, it was the wrong movie! This is supposed to be the 1983 version with James Stacy. Instead it is the 1994 version that is completely different. Very disappointed - you expect to see one movie and you get another, with a completely different story line. Terrible acting as well, only good actor in it was William Moses.",1398211200,8,336,4.616666666666666
2764269,1,B000NBNX4G,This isn't the comedy Amazon says it is. There is another movie with the same title and this is it.,1396396800,2,99,4.0
2764270,2,B000NBNX4G,"This is very confusing!  These reviews have nothing to do with the movie I just watched.  The ""Double Exposure"" I watched is a 1993 murder mystery with a totally different cast and story line. This is one of your basic, jealous husband hires a hit man flicks.  Amazon just needs to correct their link on this one!",1362096000,7,313,4.456140350877193

8176608,4,B000NBNX4G,"Growing up there are familiar faces you recognize from TV and movies that for some reason always seem to be around and yet never fall into the category of major movie stars. For me growing up in the sixties and seventies there were a ton of actors like this. Youd see them on nearly every TV series around and they offered solid performances but for some reason never found fame and fortune in film. For me Michael Callan was one of those actors. Id first seen him in film, actually, in one of my favorites MYSTERIOUS ISLAND. But after that it was mostly TV.

In the mid-eighties I opened a video store and we stocked our shelves with not just the major releases of the time but with side items as well, movies that went straight to video for lack of interest by major studios or produced by smaller companies for just that reason. These films were often good movies but for some reason overlooked. One of those movies I ordered was DOUBLE EXPOSURE. While I didn't recall much of it from that time I did remember it as being a decent film. Watching it again with this new release I found it much better than Id remembered.

Callan stars as Adrian Wilde, a professional photographer for mens magazines that is having some problems. It seems he continues to have dreams of women being violently murdered in various gruesome methods. At the same time a murderer is on the streets where he lives, killing women much in the same way his dreams show. Not only that the women being murdered the same as well.

Unsure of whether he is committing the murders or just losing his mind Wilde looks for help. His brother offers all the support that he can. A stunt coordinator who lost and arm and a leg on the job, he seems bitter but more positive than Wilde. He also gets help from his psychiatrist Dr. Curtis (Seymore Cassel) as well as medication. But the dreams persist as do the murders.

Along the way Wilde meets Mindy (Joanna Pettet) and the two begin seeing one another. The fall in love and eventually into bed as well. Wilde is drawn to Mindy and finds her to be one of the only women in his life he truly loves. But with the fear that he may be killing women without knowing it has him take on a guarded approach to her as well. Fearful of losing his mind the truth has to be found.

The movie is a nice mixture of slasher film that was popular at the time and giallo which was just being discovered by American audiences around that same period. The killers point of view seen in many giallo films is there as is the questioning of the innocence of the main character who wants to find the killer. It works well and plays out smoothly by the end of the film.

Everyone involved does a fantastic job. There isn't a bad performance here. The cinematography for a low budget film is exceptional. And as with all of the other films theyve been putting out Vinegar Syndrome has outdone themselves here with this one offering a restored 2k version from 35mm original camera negative.

Extras? Once again Vinegar Syndrome outdoes themselves. They include: a commentary track with Director William Byron Hillman; ""Exposing Double Exposure"" Interview with Cinematographer R. Michael Stringer; Staying on Task"" Interview with Script Supervisor Sally Stringer; an isolated score by Composer Jack Goga; the original theatrical trailer; promotional still gallery; and reversible cover artwork by Derek Gabryszak. All for less than most special editions like this would costs.

For slasher fans, fans of 80s movies and fans of giallo this is a movie worth adding to your collection. Not only will you find an enjoyable movie in the genre to watch but youll get it in the best format possible with the most extras found on the movie. Along with companies like Arrow, Twilight Time and Shout Factory, Vinegar Syndrome is showing that they are a company to be reckoned with when it comes to titles like these. And for fans thats a good thing.",1501200000,,3927,4.584045584045584

8176612,2,B000NBNX4G,"unusually divergent story from the pretentious writeup.  The dream sequences were all about sexual relations, first two with an imaginary male and last one a realistic sequence with the lesbian lover involved, no ""murders"" in the dreams only in the reality scenes.  No photographer involved, only a controlling male spouse involved in money laundering and the regularly wrongdoing private investigator that he hired who had a history of prior wrongful killings.  Only the lesbian supremacist survivor story that was shown in the film elevated this bleak tragedy above a one star rating.",1478649600,,586,5.3478260869565215

It appears to be a 1995 film by the same name starring Ron Perlman. Amazon needs to fix this with the correct movie. I have Prime Instant video so it was free to stream, but still disappointing.",1425254400,5,306,4.464285714285714
8176617,1,B000NBNX4G,"Take out the boobs, a few f-bombs and one full-frontal nude and this would have been something I would have seen on TV in the very early '80's. If you call a few terribly stretched quips a comedy and a model-killing serial killer a horror movie, you'll be the only one not disappointed. Just about everything sucked in this poor movie: the acting, the lines, the stereotypical characters and the cheesy LA settings.

As the police often say: Move along. Nothing to see here.",1420243200,,474,4.642857142857143
