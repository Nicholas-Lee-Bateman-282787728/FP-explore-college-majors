6602330,2,B00MUYI5YC,"The movie is ok, but the disks were definitely used, both disk holders are broken, etc. Very bad. I have paid for the new set, not in this shape. In addition I can say that the disks are pretty badly made, I haven't seen this kind of quality for over 20 years, only in very old cheap chinese fakes. The corners are sharp, has never been rounded, the center hole is asymmetric with raw ends, etc. I""m really very surprised. 2 from 5 just because the content is great. But the quality is inappropriate.",1440115200,8,500,4.329787234042553

8674791,5,B00MUYI5YC,the ending is very strangely abrupt. It seems like there should be more. There's no real closing act. But the rest of the show is excellent.,1524614400,,140,4.423076923076923
8674792,3,B00MUYI5YC,"Interesting ""revisit"" to the life of Miyamoto Musashi loosely based on the novel by Yoshikawa Eiji. A surprisingly large number of well known actors from various periods in Japanese films and television series contributed their presence and skills in a rather terse rendering of the story. The female lead who played Otsu in the 19541956 Samurai Trilogy (Yachigusa Kaoru) played the part of Myoshin in this remake. Although the choices made in shortening the story was mostly effective, its brevity did not allow any distinct development of character in any of the characters, including Musashi. The swordplay was mainly ""chambara"" style, however it was visually interesting. Films and television series made about Miyamoto Musashi seem to reflect the political and cultural climates of the times. I look forward to the next project on the life of this ever fascinating swordsman and artist.",1504310400,,891,5.28169014084507
8674793,5,B00MUYI5YC,"Superb story, very glad I was able to acquire this.",1502582400,,51,4.2
8674794,5,B00MUYI5YC,"This version of Musashi is highly entertaining and geared more towards action. One must be aware though if you're looking for a historically accurate portrayal of Musashi you should look elsewhere. But if you're just looking for a movie with a lot of great swordplay, I highly recommend it.",1500076800,3,290,4.938775510204081
8674795,5,B00MUYI5YC,"Got it for my dad (and then promptly borrowed it) and its great!  If you're a fan of Musashi, samurai movies or sword fights, its great!!!",1495756800,,138,4.3076923076923075
8674796,4,B00MUYI5YC,"Arrived quickly, and in perfect condition.  This video action drama was made with great production values and with an equally good cast, but remember that this is television... while it is based upon the heroic exploits of Miyamoto Musashi, alas, it takes many liberties with the actual life events of the greatest samurai in Japanese history.  But for samurai fans, very enjoyable to watch.",1481760000,2,391,5.09375
8674797,5,B00MUYI5YC,An old story told slightly differently.,1475107200,,39,5.666666666666667
8674798,5,B00MUYI5YC,"Cool, but is there another disk past 2?",1468454400,,39,4.0
8674799,5,B00MUYI5YC,Awesome,1461888000,,7,7.0
8674800,5,B00MUYI5YC,Great so far. The disc I've watched up to this point is working. The case wasn't broken or anything. Can't wait to watch the rest.,1458086400,,130,4.24
