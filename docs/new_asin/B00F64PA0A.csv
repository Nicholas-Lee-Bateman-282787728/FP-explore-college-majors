5968151,4,B00F64PA0A,"Produced by the National Film Board of Canada and directed by Teresa Macinnes and Kent Nason, ""Buying Sex"" is a documentary film that explores some of the issue surrounding the legalization of prostitution. Litigation over Canada's prostitution laws provided the impetus for the film. In 2010, a Canadian court invalidated laws forbidding the operation of brothels, forbidding individuals from living on the earnings of prostitutes, and forbidding communication on the street for purposes of engaging in prostitution. The plaintiffs in the case are sex workers represented by a Canadian law professor. They argued that the laws contributed to the risk of brutalization and violence and disease of the women engaged in prostitution.  In 2012, a Canadian Appeals Court agreed with the lower court on the issues of brothels and earnings; but it reversed on the issue involving communication in the street.  Both the Canadian government and the plaintiffs are in the process of pursuing appeals to Canada's highest court.

The film features academics, politicians, members of the public, and the women themselves and their customers offering their views on whether prostitution should be legalized. There is extensive discussion with the litigating teams in the case and with their clients. Broadly, those in favor of legalizing prostitution argue that the women will be safer if the trade is regulated, that many of the women in the business are articulate and knowledgeable  and enjoy substantial independence and that prostitution cannot be stopped in any event.  The opponents in this film consist of academics and former sex workers, among other people. They argue in this film from a broadly feministic perspective.  They maintain that prostitution degrades women and subjects them to violence and risks that would not be reduced if prostitution were legalized. They argue as well that buying women's bodies is simply wrong. In general, the solution to the problem that they offer is to decriminalize prostitution from the woman's end and to offer help in escaping the business but to aggressively enforce against men seeking to buy the services of prostitutes.

The film also appeals to the experiences of two countries besides Canada in expanding upon the issues.  In 2003, New Zealand legalized prostitution. Advocates on both sides of the issue in New Zealand, women in the business, and men discuss how, if at all, the legalization of prostitution has affected the safety of women in the business and public policy. As might be expected, the discussion is inconclusive.

On the other side, In 1998, Sweden reversed its course and criminalized solicitation for prostitution. The film also explores the Swedish experience. The women engaged in the business were not criminalized; but men trying to solicit for prostitution were subject to severe criminal sanctions. The interviews in the film suggest a strongly feministic motivation behind Sweden's new course. Here again, the verdict seems out on the effectiveness of this policy.

The film essentially follows the progress of the Canadian court case with interludes to discuss the New Zealand and Swedish experiences. The speakers are articulate in presenting their positions, with the result left to the viewer to decide. The movie also includes scenes of street workers, strip clubs, and other accompaniments of prostitution. But most of the film is given over to the discussion. The film was somewhat slow as a result, but it offers a reasonably balanced presentation for those interested in the issue.

5968178,5,B00F64PA0A,"On Amazon, 5 stars means ""I love it"" for the film you've watched or the product you've purchased; I wish I could say that ""I love it"" for such a heavy-hearted issue this film explores. I rated it 5 stars because I believe every single person should watch it; I've read the other reviewers - mostly men - said that this is a boring film, waste of time... etc., then I remember a particular point made by a Swedish film maker in this documentary that says the society has desensitized and stigmatized men for feeling emotions - emotions that truly resonates with one's heart deep down when no one else is talking to us; emotions and feelings that when we truly to speak to ourselves from within, is as clear as crystal.

I for one used to think along the lines that prostitution can be an empowering experience for the women, and as a feminist myself, my thoughts were - and still is - that women should be able to do whatever they so choose to do (like the application to the rest of the society, so long as this freedom doesn't include harming others); however, after reading articles after articles, watching films after films, the picture really became clear: if there is not the demand for objectification of women's bodies, women will not feel the need - just as men rarely feel the need in our society - to value themselves in accordance to the rest of the society's judgement. You can argue the demand for sex is biological, yes, but money isn't; to argue that sex and money always go together is fundamentally wrong. Sex and money goes together like peas and carrots is a result of hundreds and thousands of years of human society, of political and social struggle; no other animal on this planet will exchange an artificially created value - aka money - in exchange of sex.

I feel that I've written a longer post than I have wished to originally... but sincerely, I wish everyone will watch this documentary and be haunted by its complex and heart-wrenching issues at play. I wish not just women will watch this, but more importantly, men will watch this. Feminism isn't just benefiting women, it is in many ways more empowering for men: imagine a world with complete equality, where men and women are both allowed to express themselves freely without stigmas and expectations...",1425427200,6,2288,4.6330049261083746

5968201,4,B00F64PA0A,"The 2013 documentary BUYING SEX follows a Canadian court battle over laws restricting prostitution.  Presenting original interviews with sex workers - some active, some retired - whose views, to say the least, differ, directors Teresa MacInnes and Kent Nason keep it moving along quickly, even for a 75-minute film, especially considering much of it is talking heads.

Whatever opinions the BUYING SEX filmmakers have are not apparent. If sex is an elephant in the room to some then prostitution is an elephant stampede in the room, and I give credit to this film for nudging people into facing reality while keeping its creators' opinions quiet.

To me, the most salient point of view in BUYING SEX comes from a sex worker who says, in so many words, ""If you want to call me exploited and rescue me from this, then next you'd better save all the underpaid and abused fast food restaurant and discount store workers, too.""  Now you're talking.",1393632000,16,943,4.875
