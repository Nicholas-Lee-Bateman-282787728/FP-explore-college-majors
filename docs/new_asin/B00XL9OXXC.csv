7170818,2,B00XL9OXXC,"This review is directed towards the marketing for this product, not the content of the season. When Community first came out and I purchased the DVD from Amazon, it was 25 episodes on 4 discs for ~$20.00. Why is season 6, a 13 episode 2 disc set, currently over $30.00? Is this only because Yahoo! reportedly lost around $42 million from this show? I'd better be getting Annie's B--bs in the box for that price. Jacking up product sales won't fix that deficit, especially through the purchases of the small cult following of this brilliant show. Poor choice Amazon and Yahoo!...poor choice. Season 6 gets a 4-star rating due to its familiar return to the Community-randomness. I didn't care for the newer characters and longed for a Troy and Abed reunion. Killing off Pierce sucked, too, but I guess it had to be done when parties couldn't work together on set. Hopefully the show finds its feet again and Dan Harmon will surprise the fans in the not too distant future. #AndAMovie",1454803200,9,981,4.709302325581396
7170819,5,B00XL9OXXC,"Great show, great season! Not sure why people are complaining about the price. Do these other reviewers get the fact that Amazon did not create the show and does not set the base price for the pack? They tack on a tiny amount of money to make a profit, nothing more. Blame Yahoo or the parent production company for the price as they set it, not Amazon.

PS, older seasons are typically less expensive than brand new seasons on initial release, welcome to life. Sheesh people...",1454025600,20,478,4.558139534883721
7170820,5,B00XL9OXXC,"Great season! This is without a doubt the BEST season of the entire run of the series.

But come ON, Amazon, what the eff is with that price? 41.39??? The other five seasons average at about 15.00 each. And this is a shorter season containing only 13 episodes!?!?!

Rethink that price tag. I want to buy it but I flat out refuse at that ridiculous price. I wouldn't pay that for Blu-Ray, and this isn;'t even a Blu-Ray, it's a standard def DVD. 41.39? No thank you.

When it hits something closer to 15 bucks, you'll get my order. Not before.

UPDATE: When i wrote this, the price was listed as 41.39 and I found that unacceptable. Now the price is showing as 45.99. It actually went up higher.

7170834,5,B00XL9OXXC,"I loved every season of Community, but this one holds a special place in my heart.  After the slightly rocky season 5, season 6 got off to a great start by introducing Paget Brewster to the cast as super efficient Frankie.  Instead of making her a replacement of Shirley (who left the show), they made Frankie her own character, bringing a refreshing dynamic to the study group.  Her brilliance as a character was proven to me the moment she turned to the ever optimistic Annie and chastised her hoping that things would turn out okay by saying, ""Hope is pouting in advance.  Hope is faith's richer, bitchier sister.""

Some of the highlights of the season include: meeting Brita's parents, the return of Subway guy, Chang making it big in Hollywood, a glimpse into the next chapter of Shirley's life as she works as a cook for a handicapped detective, and an episode where the characters pitch possible futures for them as a group.

They contain some of the best, most original episodes that any show has ever offered.

Season five was promising, even had a few great episodes, but ultimately suffered from having to find a new home and grounding itself again. Not to mention cast shakeups. Season six merely was exhausted at the finish line. I was actually getting bored and praying for the show to wrap up.

Many of the integral main characters are gone. One whole episode in the middle of nothing more then a half-hour commercial for different models of Honda vehicles. It was horrible. You do not need this season at all to complete a collection of the series, it's more of an afterthought. Never pay this much money for it.

Which sucked because I think season 6 was the best of the series.  Elroy and Frankie were really perfect additions and I loved what they did with Chang and Winger.

Despite cast and crew shakeups after season 3, Community has played the Little Engine That Could role when it comes to network TV... then it left network TV. This suits Community well though because it provided more freedom for a show that already had broken barriers and was not afraid to be bold.

Season 6 is a must-buy if you're a fan of the show. The new cast members are great.

7170884,5,B00XL9OXXC,"""Community"" is by far my most favorite show! Season 6 was a miracle. It almost didn't get made. NBC canceled the show after season 5. Season 6 was made because Yahoo wanted to get into the streaming TV show game.

Troy and Pierce left in previous seasons and do not return in this one. Also, Shirley is in two episodes, and only very briefly. Professor Hickey is not in season 6. I am guessing this is because the actor who portrays him, Jonathan Banks, went back to playing Mike in ""Better Call Saul,"" the prequel to ""Breaking Bad.""

Prof. Duncan, played by John Oliver, is not in this season, because John Oliver got his own show on HBO, which you can watch for free on youtube. It is called ""Last Week Tonight.""

There are two new characters this season, and both are great. Frankie (played by Paget Brewster) is a serious character that is quite funny in her own way. She is hired to keep track of finances, and also to keep the Dean from ruining the school.

Elroy (played by Keith David.. the voice of the Ken Burns films who narrated a Ken Burns parody in season 3 of ""Community"") is an older man who is hired to be the IT guy. He seems a bit awkward at times, but for the most part fits in well with the other characters. Like Frankie, he can be both serious and quite funny.

The personalities of Jeff, Britta, Dean Pelton and Chang haven't changed (although Chang's personality did change quite a bit in season 2, and the Dean cross-dresses a lot less than in earlier seasons. I don't remember him cross-dressing at all in season 6, except once). Annie is at times less nice than she used to be, but otherwise is still endearing. Abed seems less lost than in season 5 after Troy left. He bonds well with Frankie in the first episode, and makes friends quickly with Elroy as well.

Leonard, Todd, Neil, Vicki, Starburns and Garrett are still in the show. Which is good. Dave, a minor character from season 5, one of Jeff's students, is also in season 6.

There are two new minor characters that are quite humorous... Britta's parents. They show up in several episodes. I wish they had been in previous seasons.

There are some unpleasant moments in season 6 that surprised me. Also, there is a bit of profanity in several episodes, which you will not have heard in earlier seasons. And, some of the endings that are a ""Community"" trademark are depressing instead of funny.

Despite these parts that I did not like, I loved almost all the episodes. The spirit of the show is definitely alive. Some of the season 6 episodes are among my all time favorites.. better than many episodes of previous seasons.

The only episode I didn't care for much was the last one. It had some really good moments, but I felt it could have been written better. A lot better.

Overall though, season 6 is awesome. I really like the new characters, and wish there were a lot more episodes!",1458950400,,2876,4.469465648854962

7170889,4,B00XL9OXXC,"The season was a good wrap up to the show.  There was more cast turnover with Donald Glover and Yvette Nicole Brown having left the show (although she does make a couple cameo appearances), and of course Chevy Chase having been off the show for a couple seasons.  The additions to the cast this year, Padgett Brewster as consultant for the college Frankie Dart, and Keith David as Elroy Patashnik who is introduced as a computer programmer who sells the dean a $5000 virtual reality operating system, were good, but the show never did have the feel of the first couple seasons with the original cast.

By now the show has lost all pretense of even trying to be about classes or school work.  It even makes fun of itself in pretty tongue in cheek ways throughout the season in that regard.  As well as taking shots at season 4, and Chevy Chase a couple times.  It has embraced its fringe nuttiness and ran with it.  There is of course another paintball episode, and the series finale ended up being very touching and well done without being over the top.  Whether they do or do not ever make a movie out of it, I think the show went out on a good note, and they were given the freedom by yahoo to end series up the way they wanted to.

For extras, there are a handful of deleted scenes, a quiz (that members of the cast and crew take), a gag reel, and a featurette on the end of the series.  There are no commentary tracks on the episodes however (and ones were done for yahoo, but those may not have been allowed to be included) but it would have at least been nice to have a cast commentary on the finale.  The set is a bit overpriced given that there were fewer episodes than the full seasons (although all of the episodes were longer, around 22-27 minutes) so that did even it out somewhat.  It would have been nice to have more extras on a $30 set with less episodes.

7170890,5,B00XL9OXXC,"I really enjoyed this 6th and perhaps final season of Community.  I thought it was one of the strongest seasons of the entire run.  Yahoo! allowing them to go to 28 minutes per episode (vs, the 22 minutes on network TV) really opened things up in various episodes to dive a little deeper in each storyline.

I am very thankful this 6th season was able to be produced for us true fans of the show.

I hope the show creator, cast and crew know how much we appreciate their efforts.  The show is so unique from episode to episode - truly a joy to kick back and see where each episode takes you.. I would love for the show to continue on (Netflix would be the best home for it by far), but that is something not up to us.

Thanks for the 6 great seasons so far!

7170891,3,B00XL9OXXC,"Let's face it people, this is Community's final season (Yay? #SixSeasonsAndAMovie ?), and that's not to say the show hasn't had it's ups and downs. Clearly, the show being booted off of NBC and onto a 'media' newcomer (Yahoo) has given the whole show some difficulties. Therein lies the part of the problem - Buzz Hickey's, Shirley's, and Troy's absences are the strongest felt. There's almost no explanation for Hickey's absence (unless I missed something), Shirley is written off in an epilogue and Paget Brewster's character is introduced rather abruptly in S6E1.

The DVD set comprises of two discs - DISC 1 has 7 of the 13 episodes, along with two deleted scenes and a 20-question trivia BTS thing someone did with the cast and crew. DISC 2 has the remaining 6 episodes, more deleted scenes, another BTS special (Six Seasons And A Finale), and the collective gag reel. There is secondary audio track (meaning no cast/crew commentary) for the episodes.

Compared to the other DVD sets (S1 - S5), S6 seems to be hastily cobbled together, and the crew are jumping ship (can't blame them ...). The DVD title cards are the same ones from the previous five DVD projects, along with the same little ditty, buttons, and other font-face mark-up. My personal guess is that there isn't going to be another release unless something happens down the road, so if you are willing to suck it up, you might as well get this set once you're okay with Amazon's price.

Let me leave a little bit of 'Winger' with you --- This is life people. Things change, people move on. You deal with it as best you can, and you move on. Whether you buy this DVD set or not won't change who you are, but you'll know what you get. You just make sure what you get is worth the price you're paying.

I was very ""meh"" about it, as I figured it would most likely suck. To my suprise thi ur this was one of the better seasons. And even while short, it was funny, clever, poignant and heartfelt.

7170894,4,B00XL9OXXC,"5-star show for sure. Been a Community fan since day one (literally, day one. I was there watching the pilot episode on NBC in September of 2009 not knowing what the hell I was watching). However, as great as this final season was, gotta knock the DVD down a star because NO COMMENTARY!!! What the hell? That's a staple feature for the Community DVDs! I know that the Dan Harmon commentaries are available on Yahoo, I watched them all already, but what gives with not putting them on the DVD? That being said, the features that *are* there are very good. But compared to previous seasons, this one is SEVERELY lacking in the special features department; there's maybe an hour of extra content... It's a little absurd, especially since this season in particular would have been the most interesting season to see the behind the scenes of, for obvious reasons. But I guess I should just be happy that there's a DVD at all, and it's not just stuck on Yahoo Screen forever (unlike the commentaries apparently).",1457395200,41,1006,4.6892655367231635
