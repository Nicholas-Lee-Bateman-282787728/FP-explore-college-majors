2075691,1,B0002BSHE8,"This DVD has no subtitles or language options. The reporter speaks a British dialect which is nearly unintelligible to an American listener. His Spanish language skills are perhaps on the level of a London cabbie with a Cockney dialect (pronounce name of Taquile Island like ""takwuil"").

The report starts in the capital of Lima and shows a few glimpses from the city, then covers mostly the shantytown of Villa el Salvador. Most major sights of Lima are not covered at all. Nearby ruins of Pachacamac are not mentioned, the historical quarter in Lima, Barranco, Costa Verde, Miraflores are not mentioned. Why would anybody skip all the major sights, but cover the shantytown in detail?

The report goes on to Huaraz and shows mostly the ice and snow on nearby mountains. There is no coverage of important nearby temple ruins at Chavin. There is no coverage of the beautiful alpine lakes, or the nearby disaster area, where an entire village was buried in an avalanche in the 1970's.

Next is Trujillo with coverage of fishermen on reed rafts. No mention of the important ruins of Chanchan, or the archaeological dig at nearby Sipan. Chanchan is just on the outskirts of Trujillo and covers a huge area. It is incomprehensible, how it could be missed. No coverage of the traditions of marinera music and dance, or the famous Peruvian Paso horses.

The footage from Iquitos is also inadequate and uninformative. The DVD shows mostly a scene from Belen at the river - not the main part of Iquitos, and then skips to the Amazon and the jungle hut hotel.

The trip goes back to Lima (no additional coverage from there), then to Nazca. I have not been to Nazca, myself and won't comment on this.

Next point is Puno (no information about the city itself, not much to report anyhow) and Lake Titicaca. There is a brief report about the Uros and their floating islands, then a report about Taquile Island. Most of the opportunities for scenic photography are entirely missed. The differences between Aymara culture (on Taquile) and Quechua culture (in most of Peru) are not explained. Why was Arequipa not included in the itinerary?

The trip continues by train to Cuzco. The history and old architecture of Cuzco are not covered at all. Most of the report is on the Inti Raymi festival, which is a historically questionable revival of an old Inka tradition.

Finally, the trip to Machu Picchu and the Inka trail is included. Some erroneous historical ""facts"" are mentioned. The beauty of Machu Picchu is not done justice.

Don't waste your money on this DVD. If you have to see it, check your local library first. You'd be sorry spending your money.",1105401600,39,2643,4.791208791208791

8025741,5,B0002BSHE8,"I saw this video production on PBS many years ago.  It left an indelible impression on me forever.  Mainly, the footage where a female llama was being sacrificed.  In Cuzco, host Neil Gibson joined the Incas as they reenacted the Inti Raymi festival, which culminated in the sacrifice of a female llama:  As four men held a female llama upside down by her legs, the chieftain stabbed a dagger into her womb, raising a bloody uterus.  I was shocked.....  The image moved me beyond anything I have ever saw.

The purpose of documentary film is to show some aspects of reality, not to promote tourism through propaganda.  It is up to the audience to interpret the materials and take action.  I don't know if the sacrifice of female llamas is still going on today, but this is why Peru has lost its tourism on me.  I encourage ANYONE to watch this film and take appropriate action.",1282608000,,877,4.564102564102564
8025742,5,B0002BSHE8,"It is hard to select just one, but Neil Gibson in Peru (competing with Ian Wright in Mongolia as a close second) is my favorite Globe Trekker.  Neil has an amazing diversity of experiences from riding on the roof of a bus down the Canon Del Pato in the Andes to surfing on a reed boat to making potato wine to braving the Peruvian railroads to visiting Machu Picchu, this one is truly never a dull moment.  Like most Globe Trekkers, nearly everything in this episode involves activities that normal travelers (i.e., on a budget and without a media cred) could easily undertake themselves on a visit there.",1262995200,,605,4.592592592592593
8025743,2,B0002BSHE8,"I have visted Peru twice -- before the production of this DVD and after.  The video fails to do justice to a remarkable country, particularly with respect to Lima.  Lima is a sprawling metropolis of approximately 8 million people and has, as one would reasonably imagine, many neighborhoods that are ugly, unsafe, or in decay.  However, the city also has great museums, restaurants, and shopping, and is close to an Inca (and pre-Inca) shrine, Pachacamac, which stands as one of many testaments to the genius and mystery of the indigenous Americans.  Instead of showing only the ugliness of Lima, the film could have shown some of the city's landmarks, such as the Plaza Mayor, which is the spot where Francisco Pizarro founded Lima. There is a daily changing of the guard in front of the Presidential Palace and the music played during the procession is beautiful.  (Incidentally, you can see the changing of the guard on YouTube.)  Also located on the Plaza Mayor is the Lima Cathedral, which contains the tomb of Pizarro.  The San Franciscan Monastery (the big, beautiful yellow structure seen in many Lima postcards), contains the city's first catacombs.  The Lima zoo provides a great alternative excursion for those who are unable to venture into the jungle, and the city is full of colorful, vibrant markets.  These are just a few examples of what the film could have covered.  Instead, the coverage is basically negative and the film even opens with a man peeing on the city.  The (perhaps unintended) message is ""piss on Lima,"" rather than ""visit Lima.""  You can see men publicly relieving themselves in practically any medium-sized or large city in North America.  The coverage of Villa El Salvador is pretty good but not as relevant to the traveler as the city's landmarks.  I am a huge fan of Globetrekker, but p*** on this one.",1256774400,2,1840,4.87459807073955
8025744,1,B0002BSHE8,"I have traveled to Peru and am very upset that I spent my money to watch someone criticize and make fun of the country.  He pays to see a shaman then makes fun of him, calling it ""Mambo Jambo"".  Instead of pointing out the various architectural styles (the Spanish and the Moorish), he just says something like ""Here you see some Spanish architecture, but look at all the rubbish on the ground.""  There's so much to see and experience in Peru, but it's like all he wanted to do was pick places he could make malicious jokes about.

I love watching the way Justine Shapiro shows a country, even when she sees things she does not like.  I'm headed to buy some more that have her as the host and will never spend my money on any DVD with this Neil Gibson person again.",1171756800,6,765,4.284722222222222
8025745,2,B0002BSHE8,Not enough emphasis on the positive side of Peru. Macchu Picchu was about a one minute segment. Some shots were nice but not worth the money ! Sorry I wasted it on this DVD !,1142640000,5,174,4.0
8025746,4,B0002BSHE8,"I am Peruvian American and saw this video on PBS. Although I see why it would offend most peruvians, it is the TRUTH of what a beautiful and culturally rich country has become.  Those people that criticize this video should instead be urging their government officials to ""clean up"" their city and show a more presentable view to tourists throughout the world.  I myself visited Peru back in 2003 and as a tourist was disgusted by how ""unclean"" Lima was.  I felt ashamed that people living in the capital could let their city go to waste like this and all the blame goes to the President and the Mayor of Lima for not cleaning up their city.  As soon as you step out of the airport you don't have to go very far to see that this video all is doing is showing how Lima really is(at least in most parts since the part where 'los blanquitos, pitucos' live, isn't like this at all and is where most tourists if not all go to stay.

  People say: ""This not not the entire Peru"".  Yes indeed, but why would tourist be lied about, then be dissapointed once they see the sheer reality? Because they cannot purchase a ticket back home on their first day of travel so they have to stay the entire trip?

  All in all, I must say I enjoyed the video especially Iquitos and Cuzco. I can say that the provinces outside Lima are more attractive to go visit.  Beautiful scenes!!!  Someday I hope I have the privilige to explore Peru the way it is meant to be enjoyed..  Chauuuu",1142640000,11,1462,4.327205882352941
8025747,1,B0002BSHE8,"Why would they like to concentrate on the bad side of a city that much? I almost think they purposely did it that way, maliciously, and it's a shame. Lima has so many beautiful places to visit, but this people went to Villa el Salvador instead. When they visit Brazil or New York, did they only showed the fabelas or the Bronx for instance? the answer is NO.

YES what they show is reality but only in certain areas of Lima, come on all cities have their shady areas, Lima's bad neighborhood are not more dangerous that the Bronx in New York City for instance. The way they show it it's manipulated to make the viewer think that Lima has nothing else to show than poverty, which if you ever visit Lima, you'll see that it's far from true. For those ignorant people below who wrote that it is the reality of Peru I would tell to get an air ticket and fly to Peru first and then talk all they want about it, it's not enough to sit in front of a Newspaper or TV news to know the reality of a country. Poverty is in deed  the reality of all Latin America, not only Peru, and Peru's economy has grown more rapidly that any country in Latin American, except for Chile, in the last few years, That has made of Lima in sort of like the economic center on the region, a modern, vibrant, cultural and dynamic city... why do these people don't show that. I'd like to figure that one out.",1139529600,8,1376,4.208333333333333
8025748,3,B0002BSHE8,"Although this isn't the best work in the Globetrekker series, it still has that authentic tramping quality to it. I'll admit that it unfortunately ends on a downbeat note.

But showing the economic condition of Lima is critically important ... the current government is one of the worst in the hemisphere, because they've caved completely into US demands to abuse its people & resources. This is arguably the most important thing a traveler should know about Peru, and especially about Lima: the poverty there is caused by the continuous, overt stealing of the country's wealth by private enterprise.

To understand how this works, check out the superb documentary about Jamaica: ""Life & Debt"".

Yes, Peru is one of the most amazing, diverse and beautiful places in the world. But reality is hard to argue with, and this DVD offers a good sanity check. Go to Peru, it will change your life .... if you don't hide in a tourist hotel.",1114732800,6,932,4.8125
8025749,1,B0002BSHE8,"The production of this film is the worst ever! There is a total misrepresentatioin of this country, famous for its history, archeological sites, and amazing colonial areas -which were deliberatly ommited. Instead of showing the most beautifu and interesting places of the three areas of Peru, this hippy traveller showed the most filthy and unpleasant sites with derogatory comments in a denigrant video which has offended the entire Peruvian population.  Right now, one of the airlines (LAN CHILE) involved in the showing of this film in all its international flights is being sued by the Peruvian governent because of the detriment to the tourism industry. Peru lost thousands of potential tourists thanks to this production. This ""documentary"" instead of promoting tourism in Peru has scared every potential visitor to this wonderful country. Shame on the producers and Neil Gibson, and everyone who promotes this video. PLEASE DON'T BUY IT!!!AND PLEASE AMAZON.COM View it and remove it from your site. Thanks,",1114387200,16,1013,5.33125
