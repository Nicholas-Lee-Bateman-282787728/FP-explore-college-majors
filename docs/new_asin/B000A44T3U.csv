8074287,5,B000A44T3U,"Watching and listening to the lovely Siddha teacher and master Gurumayi Chidvilasananda deliver the 2004 New Years day message on divine power and spiritual life to a group of devotees is much like watching a singular, sparkling dewdrop sliding down a brightly colored leaf. For some observers the process will become excruciatingly slow, even unbearable. For others it will become an intoxicating visual & auditory poem pregnant with subtly, nuance and profound insight. Some will become enraptured in a experience in which time no longer exists. Others will be asking themselves ""when will this ever end?""

Such is the effable nature of the spiritual. One person's timeless moment is another person's seemingly endless torture. My, what a difference ones spiritual perspective makes! Such being the case, how does one rate such a presentation fairly? I can say that the production values are high and the setting  for Gurumayi's message, the Shree Muktananda Ashram in South Fallsburg, New York, is bright, tranquil and inviting. Another thing I can assure the potential viewer of is that the camera work and recording equipment expertly captures every facial expression, vocal intonation and whimsical smile of the beautiful Gurumayi. Again, the only thing in question is are you willing to sit through a 91 minute talk on Hindu spirituality?

If one is willing to quiet the mind, listen with the heart and see through the eyes of the spirit one will be blessed with a unique opportunity to share a memorable, intimate moment with a renowned Siddha master. If not, you won't last past the first 15 minutes.",1296172800,5,1609,5.110266159695818
