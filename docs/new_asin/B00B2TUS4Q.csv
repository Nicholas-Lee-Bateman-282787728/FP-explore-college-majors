5553597,3,B00B2TUS4Q,"I recently had the opportunity to watch and review the new movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Break-Away/dp/B00B2TUS4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Break Away</a>, from Word Entertainment.

I was pretty excited about watching it, since it deals with cycling.  One of my favorite activities is cycling, using both my road bike as well as my mountain bike.  While neither of my bikes are top of the line, not by far, they are both decent quality.

But my dream is to own a Pinerello one day.  And with this film being sponsored by Pinarello, as well as playing a role in the film itself, it fuels my dreams of riding one someday.

So with dreams of cycling running through my mind, the family settled down to watch Break Away.

While it was an interesting movie, there was a mix of both good and bad things about this particular film.

The Bad
Let's tackle the negative items first.  The first and most glaringly obvious flaw is the difficulty in understanding the dialog of the film.  Break Away takes place in South Africa, and each of the characters have a very heavy accent, making it very difficult to follow the film in English.  I understand that the movie is based on a true story, and that it happened in Cape Town, and have no problems with other languages, but it made watching this film very difficult and the plot hard to follow.

The plot is another issue that lands on the negative list.  Based on a true story, Break Away starts off quickly assuming that the viewer knows the story.  If not, it's extremely hard to figure out what's happening.  Character development is flawed as well.  There is no sense of identity with the main characters, and several characters are developed significantly, only to have minor roles in the film, such as the wife of the main character.

Speaking of the characters in the film, as is sadly typical with the Christian movie industry, the acting was sub par.  Dialog was stilted and forced, facial and body expressions were overly exaggerated, leaving a feeling of a low quality production.

I was disappointed with the physical aspects of the DVD as well.  Several times the rendering was pixelated, and the letterbox bars turned red at a couple of points during the movie.  The menu also doesn't work as expected, some of the special features don't open the same video every time.  I could never access the video vignette on cycling.  There is also a typo on the menu:  The disc case lists a short look at a ministry called Jacob's Well.  The DVD menu calls it Jacov's Well.  Hopefully, these are issues that can be resolved easily before distribution.

The Good
While I found many disappointing factors about the film, there were some positive aspects of Break Away as well.  The story is very inspirational.  Even though it is a fictional story, it was inspired by true events surrounding the recession that left thousands of people out of work around the world.

Despite the difficulty in following the dialog, once you figured out what was going on, the story drew you in and captivated you.  Unfortunately, it took the first hour of the film for this to occur.

The point behind the story is a crucial thought for our struggling world right now.  When you are faced with the loss of everything, you have to trust God to use what you have and provide what you need.  Using the story of Jesus multiplying the loaves and fish, the film brings forth the fact that God can take what you have, even though it may seem like you've lost everything, and multiply it to accomplish his will in your life.

Considering both the negative and the positive, I have to place this movie somewhere in the middle.  Break Away isn't a great movie, but it's not a bad movie either.  We enjoyed it, once we got into the flow of things.  You might enjoy it as well.

5553598,4,B00B2TUS4Q,"Break Away is a brand new family-friendly Christian film that is filled with inspiration! We watched this as a family recently and were impressed with so much: the plot, the scenery of life in Cape Town, South Africa, the Dutch-style accents, and more. If you enjoy family-friendly films revolving around sports or bicycling, you'll enjoy this film.

It starts out a bit slow in that it takes a while to set up the story. One of my family members said several times, ""If they don't set up the antagonist pretty soon, I'm going to stop watching this!"" Finally, my husband and I told her, ""It's a character-driven plot line, not one that pits protagonist against antagonist!"" And she watched the rest of the film with us.

I'm saving my copy because I'd like to watch this again. It is inspirational, clean, and family-friendly. It has action scenes in the second half of the film, so your action-lovers will enjoy that. This film is a creative approach to encouraging us when hope seems to be drowned by despair. Anyone who has ever been unemployed or underemployed to the point that marriage bonds have been strained or you've possibly even lost your own home will relate well to the themes in Break Away.",1365292800,,1205,4.706161137440758
5553607,4,B00B2TUS4Q,"For someone who loses their job, the future can be scary.  Faced with impossible odds, we ride along with Francois as he goes from successful business man to unemployed delivery boy.  See how he learns to take what little he has, a bike and a strong work ethic, and give it to God who turns it into a whole new life for him.  Change is hard and all seems hopeless, but Francois believes that all things are possible with God and his faith and his story has an impact on the lives of those around him.  The journey back to the top is long and difficult, but it's a different mountain he's climbing and in the end he is a better person for it.
I haven't watched many faith-based movies and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this one.  I found it to be touching in its simplicity and inspiring in its message.  There was so much to be learned from the story line and I was reminded how God can work through all circumstances.

5553608,3,B00B2TUS4Q,"It's family night at our house.  Typically we will choose a video and make a batch of popcorn.  Snuggled up in our jammies, we settle down and enjoy...

Last week we received a copy of Break Away from Word Films to review.  We have enjoyed their movies in the past and looked forward to watching this film.

First of all, although Francois is a Christian, that's not denied, this is not a proselytizing film.  I appreciated that.  The movie could have been at least 45 minutes shorter and still tell the same story.  It just wasn't a well-written or produced film.

I read that this film was produced on a tight budget, and honestly, it shows.  Although the three main characters (Francois, his brother John and the bicycle shop owner) make a charming trio, the other characters were either unbelievably over-the-top or nondescript.

The biggest issue we had with the film was the length.  Because there was little dialogue in comparison to the cycling scenes, the film seemed slow.  At one point my husband fell asleep.

The film does redeem itself toward the end.  If you enjoy cycling, you'll like this movie.  If you don't understand it...you won't understand it.

Overall, we were just not that impressed ... which is a bummer because the story is a good one.",1366588800,,1264,4.698630136986301
5553609,3,B00B2TUS4Q,"The setting is South Africa. The movie is based on actual events and experiences of the film crew and their friends. The main character, Francois Fouche loses his job (marketing manager) because his company goes bankrupt. He's afraid to tell his family; he keeps his wife and two children in the dark for 4 months. He's desperate to make ends meet so he seizes an unexpected opportunity to become a delivery man using his bicycle. His motto is ""If I can't deliver it on time, it's free."" His work ethic (he's known to be fast, reliable, & friendly) and passion inspire people. However, he himself gets really stressed, discouraged, and depressed at times (he's unable to make payments on his home loan, his job proposals are rejected again and again, etc.). His brother and his new friend, Eli, who is the owner of a bike shop, encourage and equip him as he (a former rugby player) tries to train for a cycling competition. He's determined to win the race because he wants to inspire others not to lose hope but to stand up again. He believes that with God, anything is possible.

The movie moves at a slow pace and it's 155 minutes long. It's a low budget film and the film crew consisted of only 7 members and 15 students and volunteers so please don't expect a Hollywood quality :). There's some humor here and there which helps relieve the tension. I enjoyed all the beautiful scenery and the music used in this film. I think cycling enthusiasts would enjoy this DVD. The main theme is about hope and faith. The message is: Never give up your dreams/never give up on life and use what you've got & place it in Jesus' hands & watch Him multiply (remember what He did with 5 loaves of bread and 2 fish). The special features on the DVD include behind the scenes, cycling talk, music, the ministry of Jacob's Well, and bloopers. If you're going through a tough time such as unemployment and/or financial difficulties, please don't lose heart. Check out this faith-based film and be encouraged to keep pressing on and trusting God for His plan and purpose!

My Thoughts-
What excited me to first agree to review ""Break Away"" was the fact it had cycling in it and was a Christian movie. Now after watching it, I'm even more excited to share about this DVD with you.

Francois is a family man and a business man. But with the recession he loosing his job, along with his co-workers. He doesn't share this information with his family right away, he tries very hard to fix the problem and make money some other way. But things just weren't working out and soon he found himself riding his bike making deliveries for other companies. His wife is upset with him at first for not sharing this problem with her but soon through prayer, she becomes very supportive.
Francois meets a man named, Eli. He owns a bicycle shop and helps makes Francois' bike fast for fast deliveries and so he can race these guys he sees very day on the road. Eli and Francois become very close friends and find out each of them are Christian. Eli tries to encourage Francois in his situation by sharing the story of the ""5 loaves and 2 fish"" story of Jesus. He doesn't get it at first but by the end of the movie you can see how God took what little Francois had and changed his life and the lives of those around him.

I really enjoyed this movie. It's perfect for all Churches and Christian homes. I would not only categorize it as a Christian Sports film but a good, fun family film. The movie takes place in South Africa, most of the time it's filmed in English but other times it's spoken in another language that they close caption for us.

One part of the movie Francois is training very hard to win this bicycle tournament. Eli is helping train him and asks, ""Why is it so important for you to win?"". Francois replies ""I'm tired of people telling me what is not possible. With God all things are possible."" This would be what I think the main theme of the whole movie is, the purpose of this film. It's to tell us to not give up, to trust in God, even in the toughest times.

I want to share this story with you. Lately life for my family has been tough, with Moo being diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes and with me dealing with kidney stones while being pregnant. The other day I ended up in the hospital with the worst kidney stone pain I have ever had, even pain meds weren't helping. I started praying and then singing the song ""How Great Thou Art"". It was my mentor's favorite song and I was clinging to it with hope in God. Towards the end of ""Break Away"" a hymn is being sung in another language. I had to stop the movie, it was ""How Great Thou Art"". It hit me hard, I know God is with me. And I find it no coincidence that I happen to watch this movie on the same day I struggled in the hospital. Thank you God.

The movie ends with the scripture from Jeremiah 29:11 and I want to end my review with the same.
""For I know the plans I have for you,"" declares the Lord, ""plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.""",1366502400,7,3273,4.288025889967638
5553611,4,B00B2TUS4Q,"I had a little bit of a hard time getting into Break Away, I think because of the thick accents I had trouble understanding, but by the end I was completely engrossed in this inspiring movie and immediately watched it again to pick up what I missed.

The movie takes place in South Africa and when Francois' loses his job, he faces the hardship of providing for his family with no income; a scenario all too familiar with many Americans today. When none of his interviews pan out, he stumbles upon a chance to make some quick cash making a delivery on his bicycle. One opportunity turns into another and he suddenly finds himself a full time delivery man.

It was really inspirational to see a hard working man humbled to what could be considered a lowly position reserved for teenagers and find joy in it. As Christians we are called to find joy in all that we do and serve the Lord regardless of the stature of the work itself. Francois' was a shining example of this.

One of my favorite parts of the film was the music. Music is such an important element in a movie. It can make or break it depending on how it's done. The music was so appropriate to not only set the tone but also to tie in the message with the lyrics.

I was shocked after I watched the movie to read that the movie was made by a crew of just 7 professionals and 15 students and volunteers! I could tell this obviously wasn't a big studio blockbuster but what was accomplished was incredible on a tight budget with such a small crew. They obviously had a heart and commitment for the film and getting the message across was their priority, not making millions. Even more inspirational: it was based on actual events.

Break Away was a total inspiration and great example of a Godly man doing God's work, no matter how big or small.",1366502400,,1804,4.389221556886228

5553613,5,B00B2TUS4Q,"What do you do with only five loaves and two fish?

You give them to Jesus and watch what HE will do with them.

Break Away is an inspirational story of how God can use a hard situation for His good and glory.

Set in South Africa, the movie opens with Francois, who is a husband, father and business man, loosing his job along with his entire department.

Though he makes a gallant effort to take care of his now unemployed co-workers, it is the recession and jobs are scarce.

Through another misgiving, Francois discovers how God can turn what little he has left into a blessing that literally changes his life - and those around him.  Namely his ex-con brother and humorous bicycle shop owner.

This is definitely an all ages,  family-friendly film.  My kids really enjoyed the accents and scenery.  My husband noted that there were a few parts that moved a bit slow for his taste.  Though some of my ultra conservative friends probably won't appreciate the few shots of a shirtless Francois, the rest of the movie sends a positive, entertaining, inspiring and uplifting message!",1366329600,3,1083,4.677248677248677
5553614,4,B00B2TUS4Q,"While this film is definitely not an action-packed, busy film and seemed to be lower-budget than Faith Like Potatoes, I enjoyed it.

The movie shows what the power of God and the love of friends and family can do: the impossible.
This movie is family friendly. There is no bad language, no sexual content, no drugs involved. Instead, there are good virtues displayed. Grace, forgiveness, encouragement, perseverance, faith.

Break Away also teaches a view on the story of Jesus and the loaves of bread and fish in a way I never thought about it before. But I won't spoil that lesson for you.

5553615,4,B00B2TUS4Q,"Written and directed by stars Frans Cronje and Morne Theunissen, this is one of those films that can make a powerful impact. There were a couple of things that did bother me with the dvd, though. First was my initial difficulty in understanding some of the accents, so I really wish closed captioning had been an option. I did adapt, and it got easier, but it was still a stumbling block. The second was some sound issues. There was one spot in particular where the sound of people walking overpowered the voices, so the film definitely needed some ADR work.

However, this is also one of the more powerful films I have seen about relying on God through the tough times. Using the parable of the loaves and the fishes, there is a message to give God all you have and see what He does with it. In one scene, his wife (Leone Pienaar) tells him that he is to follow God, and she and the children would follow him. While he did go through moments of despair, Francois takes what is available for him to use---including his talents---and simply gives his best and relies on God to see him through. This is an excellent testimony on trusting God to provide for your needs and adapting to His plan, no matter how it looks to others.

The soundtrack was better than average for me. There were a couple of songs I wasn't fond of, but I loved the majority of the music--there is a version of ""How Great Thou Art"" that is outstanding! I was also impressed with the partnership the film has with Jacob's Well. This is a ministry that aims to build up a growing network of churches, organizations, businesses and individuals working together to help people in their communities who have lost regular income or do not have a self-sustainable income.

5553616,4,B00B2TUS4Q,"Break Away, released previously in Afrikaans as Baroudeur, is a film about faith, family, friends, and perseverance. Unlike Baroudeur, Break Away is almost completely in English; there are some subtitles. It takes place in Cape Town, South Africa. This is where one of the problems with the movie comes into play. The actors' accents are very thick, so it is difficult to understand them. My daughter also said they didn't pronounce their words clearly enough which means the words sounded a bit like mumbling to her at times. The other issue, which compounded the accent issue, was that the audio was not consistent. At times, the soundtrack was too loud, so it overpowered the voice track. Other times, the voices had a ""tin"" sound to them. So, the audio and accents did make following the movie a bit more difficult.

That being said, the story line and the message were very good. It showed the importance of having faith in God, having a strong family unit, and having the support of friends during difficult times. The movie focused on the fact that all things are possible with Christ. What we liked is that it showed that our wishes and plans for our life are not necessarily God's plans for our lives. Sometimes we really want one thing, but the Lord knows that we need something else. It doesn't always work out the way we want it to, but the Lord supplies for our needs.

We enjoyed the soundtrack and believe it added to the overall feel of the movie. The movie is very clean with no objectionable material, and it would be suitable for all ages.

8561753,4,B00B2TUS4Q,"I've been asked by Word Films to write a review on a new Christian movie released yesterday titled, Break Away.

This movie is not about a rider and his bike, but is a movie about perseverance and hope-about taking whatever we have (even as simple as a bike) and then allowing God to multiply how we choose to daily serve Him through that one thing.

If you plan to compare this movie with your Hollywood favorites, then don't bother watching it. The contrast will only serve to get in your way. But if you choose to hang tight through accents, somewhat corny music, and mediocre acting, you will soon find yourself engrossed and forgetting (about halfway through) that this flick doesn't have Warner Brothers in the credits.

In fact, it's far from a big name label! This movie was shot on a $55,000 budget (typically requires close to $1 million to produce) and a crew of only seven professional members (plus fifteen students/volunteers). The production itself speaks to the over-riding theme of this film: When it seems like you've lost everything, use what you've got and let God multiply it.
