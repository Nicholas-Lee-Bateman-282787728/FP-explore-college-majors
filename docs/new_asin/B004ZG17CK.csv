4508963,5,B004ZG17CK,"This movie was filmed primarily in a genuine, abandoned amusement park in Chippewa Lake, Ohio. From the opening scene to the climactic end, the roller coaster the viewer enjoys is not in the decrepit park but the emotional thrill-ride that director Jay Woelfel takes us on. Who isn't creeped out by an amusement park at night? This film is a non-stop mind freak and a must have for any lover of this genre. As an added bonus, an incredible talent, Mike Nugent of the internet variety show Brewkah Assault (available free on iTunes and at [...]), makes his major motion picture debut as Wackles the Clown. Nugent's naturally quirky, off-beat, humble and unassuming nature belies a lunatic contra-auguste and is a must view. Oh, Amazon, if but there were more stars to rate this film the heavens above would be barren from my rating.",1309305600,9,831,4.777777777777778

4508965,1,B004ZG17CK,"I had to give one star to be able to write this review. But this is a ZERO video!! My 10 year old grandson and I read Mary Hahn books for young people...and CLOSED FOR THE SEASON was a book we just finished. He was so excited to find a video ""of the book we had read""---about two middle school boys and their adventures involving a run down amusement park. Well...the title is the same, the video.shows an old amusement park....but that is it. Not same characters. Not same story. Nothing. Nada. WE WANT OUR MONEY BACK. Mary Hahn needs to sue somebody!!",1426723200,,553,4.378640776699029
4508966,5,B004ZG17CK,"Was really pleased with this film, had some of the best filming at the now abandoned Chippewa Lake Park. I at first thought that there was alot of work involved building the rides and fun houses for this film, but then found out later that this was actually a long abandoned amusement park that was closed down 30 years ago. The scenery couldn't have been any better and the filming was of the best. I really thought that the main actor was Joe Unger (the carny)... excellent acting... top notch. The very cute couple Aimee Brookes, and Damian Maffei, were also really great with their acting. Was just wishing that their love and affection between them could have been built upon more... with maybe some more sensuous love making scenes. Some parts of the film were a little hard to understand and i wonder if maybe there was some re-editing that may have occured... or maybe some scenes were cut. A little bit of continuity problems, with jumping back in forth in time. Found it a little hard to understand what happened early on between the younger kids. Overall great storyline, and fantastic filming...great film for a couple looking to spend some time watching horror movies.",1396137600,2,1181,4.737864077669903
4508967,5,B004ZG17CK,"I wish the movie took off more. I went to this park long ago when it was open as a kid . I then went back with photographers from Akron U. 13 years after it closed for the season. I made a video when there was still a lot of the park buried in the woods. Strange ,but I told the lady I was dating that was visiting park with me "" this could be about the best place to make a Horror Movie"" then a few years later the ballroom gets burnt down by arsonist, and what little is left after vandals destroy is left for this movie . It's sad once such a great park has been reduced to a fainted memory, and the only socialization people have from this spot in history is a faded memory. This movie gives at least a last breath of air to what is now been lost in time. I will admit it was getting really creepy there toward dusk, and I and my date had no problem deciding to get away from it fast. Had a really creepy feeling. the exterior of the ballroom looked like something you wanted to not venture too close to. I wish the filmmaker would have just been able to get there a few years sooner,they would have had much more to work with!  Now even Geauga Lake is a faded memory so sad. The last one surviving is Conneaut Lake, and lets just hope volunteers, and the respected efforts of staff can keep it going. It is the BEST haunted attraction during HALLOWEEN plus the movie ""The Road' had a scene filmed there. Unfortunately again arson took away the Ballroom, and now Beach club. seems really unfair that patrons are punished by sick minded people playing with matches!",1394841600,3,1568,4.1749174917491745
4508968,1,B004ZG17CK,"In all honesty...Other than the setting and the title which was excellent for filming a thriller  (the abandon amusement park). I thought the acting was bad  and the overall movie was about as boring as watching paint dry.....I actually fast forwarded through it numerous times  and finally just let it go  ...If a movie does not capture my attention in about the first fifteen minutes,  I am pretty much over it as I was with the one..",1391904000,,436,4.6103896103896105
4508969,5,B004ZG17CK,"Ok I grew up in Chippewa Lake so I didn't rent Closed for the Season because of the actors... The Lake Monster is funny, I chuckled...I loved the shout out for Jungle Larry! That was AWESOME! The videos and pics of Chippewa Lake were also very cool. I love how they are calling it by name instead of using a different park! Met Damien outside of the park and he was a super nice guy.
 Thank you for making this awesome trip down memory lane...Bad acting SUPER location!!!!",1380240000,,472,4.363636363636363
4508970,1,B004ZG17CK,"This is one of the worst horror movies that I've seen in my 38 years. I grew up watching horror movies so I've seen many. It's boring,bad acting,bad script. I don't like how they were imagining everything and that lake monster was just plain stupid!.I'm a big fan of the movie The Funhouse from the 80's so I was hoping to see another good carnival movie but this movie was just horrid. Not even worth the price of a rental. Just get it for free from your local library(like I did)if you want to see for yourself just how bad it is.",1380067200,,532,4.2254901960784315
4508971,4,B004ZG17CK,"This movie is cheesy and campy, just the way I like them - the best part is that I live 10 minutes down the road from Chippewa Lake Park, and have explored the abandoned grounds several times among the years, and it was awesome to see it show up in this.

The acting is on par with this style of movie, and it's just what you'd expect. If you like campy horror flicks, or even abandonded places/amusement parks, it's definitely worth checking out.",1368576000,2,447,4.385542168674699
4508972,4,B004ZG17CK,"I bought this film because we don't live far from the park where it was filmed and I went there with my parents when I was a small child when the park was open. About a year ago my husband and I toured the abandoned amusement, so sad.",1366502400,,234,3.8958333333333335
4508973,5,B004ZG17CK,"I waited years to get my hands on a copy of this movie because I lived near the amusement park where they filmed it, and I had seen all the movie stuff left behind before the park was demolished.  It was such an awful movie, but it's one of those that is so bad, it's awesome.  I'll keep this in my media cabinet next to Howard the Duck.",1357430400,,337,3.9411764705882355
4508974,3,B004ZG17CK,"If you've seen or read Something Wicked This Way Comes, The Circus of (film:  Seven Faces of) Dr. Lao, Vampire Circus or Carnival of Souls, you will have an idea as to the kind of ground your mind will be treading on in this film.  Spiritually the movies shares themes with Burton's Big Fish with the implied theme of the power of storytelling.  Whether you want to call it part ghost-story or part carnival from hell, Closed For The Season unfortunately never seems to find its focus or footing.
The Positives:  Very surreal, lots of interesting imagery, the dialogue is well-written and often even poetic and thought provoking.  There's probably even a metaphor lurking about in the narrative somewhere.  Joe Unger, as the Carny, absolutely owns this film.
The Downers:  The narrative, though surreal, is so disjointed at times that you may be left wondering if the producer/director had an idea for a story at all; heck, you might even be left wondering if there was even any story in the first place, or just a bunch of cool scenes strung together.  The ending doesn't exactly tie up the movie, though there is a connection between that and the opening scene.  The dialogue is well-written, but it is often onerous and slows the action and tension down.",1345852800,,1257,4.755760368663594
4508975,3,B004ZG17CK,"I like old park, old homes, old insane closed down homes, etc. the extras are the only thing worth wathing on this dvd. This could have been so much better!!",1338076800,,157,4.266666666666667
4508976,3,B004ZG17CK,"I bought this movie based on just the filming location alone. The movie as far as acting, plot and CG left a little to be desired but the location was great. The documentaries in the bonus features of the disc and scenery in the film made it worth the money for me. If your interested in Chippewa Lake Park then this is for you, but if your looking for a blockbuster scary movie then you better keep looking.",1335916800,,408,4.243589743589744
4508977,1,B004ZG17CK,"I rarely give up and take a DVD out of the player before it ends, but CLOSED FOR THE SEASON is one exception.
After an hour of sheer boredom and frustration, my patience evaporated.
Every aspect of this movie is insufferably bad, from the script to the acting.
Avoid this loser at all costs.  NO STARS!!",1322265600,,303,4.410714285714286
4508978,2,B004ZG17CK,"Okay, I am a Carnival addict. I Love going to carnivals, i have since i was a little kid. I Know everything about ANY carnival ride, and Every rides manufacturer. Obsessed much?!?! lol! And i LOVE Horror Movies. I Was in my video store the other day, and i seen this an i was like..OMFGGG.... This is the PERFECT combination for me. So, i imidiatally HAD to get it. I put it in, as soon as i got home. I Wanted to Love this SOOOO MUCH. Unfortunatally, i didn't. The Movie doesn't make a lick of sense. I was confused throughout the whole movie. Some parts, were so dumb, they were actually HILARIOUS. Everytime something happened in this movie, it turned out to be a vision they were having. It is ASHAME, that someone, would ruin a movie, that had so much potential. The Artwork is FABOLOUS!! That's the only reason this movie gets Two Stars. The Movie itself, 1 STAR. Please...RE MAKE this movie. Please.",1320883200,2,906,4.463855421686747
4508979,4,B004ZG17CK,"I was plesently surprised with the film. I bought it mainly for the fact that is was shot at the park where I went as a child. It brought back some memories for me, and had a half-way decent story line.",1320364800,3,202,3.951219512195122
4508980,1,B004ZG17CK,I guess its unfair to review this movie as I haven't made it past the first five minutes. I will keep trying when I have some time to waste...of course I wil probably need some help staying awake,1320192000,,195,4.157894736842105
4508981,4,B004ZG17CK,"Great movie for roller coaster/amusement park fans!  Being shot at the closed for 30+ years Chippewa Park makes it awesome.  Very good footage of the park including the remaining rides that closed with the park back in 1978!  The scenery couldn't be better for a horror movie set in an abandonned amusement park.  The story is good although a little confusing and the music by the producer is awesome!  Actor Joe Unger as ""the carny"" is in my opinion just amazing.  Also the DVD has special features including a 2008 scout to Chippewa before shooting the movie and a 1993 documentary of Chippewa.  Totally worth watching it!",1319760000,7,624,4.775700934579439
4508982,3,B004ZG17CK,"I couldn't wait to see this!  I read so much about Chippewa Lake Park that the thought of seeing this was inspired! There are extras included on the DVD that include ""deleted scenes"" and a 1993 visit throught the abandoned park in the hopes of re-opening it but the detoriation was much more than anticipated, so it never happened.  The movie itself had its moments, but as one reviewer said, the acting leaves something to be desired. I liked it for the fact that it was filmed there, for the most part. The fun house scene however, is the old bath house, as the fun house had collapsed over the years.
If you're a fan of old abandoned parks, this one's for you!",1315785600,16,663,4.382113821138211
4508983,2,B004ZG17CK,"This movie was just awful!

The acting was horrible; the plot & characters were undeveloped.

The only redeeming quality of this movie is the setting - Chippewa Lake Park was a great place, both before and after it closed in 1976.  The movie is worth a watch ONLY because of the setting.  It's too bad something more worthwhile could not have been filmed there before the park was completely torn down.",1314576000,12,402,4.619718309859155
8449724,1,B004ZG17CK,"This movie was free on Prime, so I can't say too many terrible things about it. You can't beat free. However... From the start, this movie was disjointed. It felt rushed and sloppy. It was difficult to grasp what the plot was...or if there was one at all. I turned it off fifteen minutes in. Too much screaming, heavy breathing, random attempt at plot, and unrealistic behavior on the part of the characters. It's free, so if you just want to sit back and stare at the screen, it can't be too bad to pass up, I suppose. If you want substance, however, keep looking.",1507161600,,565,4.390476190476191

8449729,1,B004ZG17CK,"Awful, laughable, the effects and acting were embarrassing. I allowed my husband to turn it off after 20 grueling minutes and give me an ""I told you so"" wink.",1468800000,,158,4.482758620689655

8449731,4,B004ZG17CK,"For something available for free on Prime, this is really one the better horror offerings.

You're asked to suspend you disbelief at times, but the whole movie is like that,
so that was fine with me.

Nicely atmospheric and well paced. The 2 lead actors weren't the best you could
hope for, but were passable. Worth a look, definitely.",1464652800,,335,4.661016949152542
8449732,3,B004ZG17CK,"Okay way to pass the time...however I would never buy this. I noticed a lot of reviews stated it was a well done film.  The acting was lacking as well as the special effects, etc.  I was not expecting much coming into the film to begin with. Would I watch it again probably not.....was it a total waste of my time Nope.
