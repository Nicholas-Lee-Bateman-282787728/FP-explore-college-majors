8388486,5,B0034LR10E,"Includes Ford Motor Willow Run production line video, maybe the best ever war plant documentary.  Excellent detail of the mass production line that revolutionized aircraft production around the world, and is virtually the way it is done today.  Great price for history.",1443052800,2,269,5.380952380952381

8388489,3,B0034LR10E,"Most is straightforward, but I was most looking forward to the captured German film about the B-24. It has narration in German. This could have been improved by printing it with English subtext. (Partly my own fault for speaking very poor German, I suppose.)

Also, the new footage of the restored B-24 was in a normal screen aspect ratio, so one could probably adjust their (modern) TV to fit it. Otherwise, it looked a bit odd.",1406160000,2,429,4.644736842105263
