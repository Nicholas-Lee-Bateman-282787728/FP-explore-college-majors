Germany: EVERY ONE SHUT UP!! We've called this meeting to solve the world's problems, not to fight about the problems of our past! And because I'm the only country who seems to know how to run a meeting, We'll follow my rules from here on out! Eight minutes each for speeches, no chit-chat about side deals, and absolutely no going over the time limit! If you want to go, make sure you are prepared and make sure to raise your hand in a way that does not (something I couldn't understand) maock my countries past!

Italy: *raising of the left hand, mocking Germany's past...Oh Italy....*

Germany: Germany recognizes his friend Italy!

Italy: *smiles and eyes close* Paaassstttaaaaa!

(so yeah! yay! Italy! Oh and is this English dub? The product, the World series? And what does it mean by World Series 1 Season three? Part 1? Please help me!)",1321747200,,866,4.746666666666667

This has got to be one of the best shows I have seen in my life and will always be one of my number one shows EVER! This is a must see show. I highly recomend it......so does my history teacher.

4898100,5,B005W2BWPS,"Note: I know I'm a nerd, but who cares.  I've reviewed Hetalia Season One and Paint it, White.  Now is the time for the long awaited Hetalia: World Series - Season 3!
Also, I watched most of it on youtube, so I don't want to hear people complaining and ranting about reviewing a product that hasn't been released yet.  It's called internet, idiots.

Anyway, World series will be my favorite because the cast brought in Spain, Hong Kong(can't wait to hear his voice) more Prussia, the Nordics (Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway and Iceland), more Prussia, and more awesomeness to the Hetalia world.  Even though I watched almost all of the episodes, I'm actually just eager to hear Sweden call Finland his wife in the English version, if I don't hear that or if they change the script, I'm gonna cry! XD

Basically, Prussia takes over the entire show(Hungary will get him, trust me.  Don't mess with her man!), you'll be seeing some episodes with Spain trying his hardest to take care of rude/cute Romano,and others(like America dragging England's car up a hill for an hour just to ask him for the keys.  LOL!  Those are the only things I'm gonna spoil, but the rest you'll find out on your own.

Like I said in season one of Hetalia, if you're the type that doesn't like to laugh at yourself because of some old/new stereotypes, don't look at it and complain about it, but if you're the type that doesn't care and still laughs at it because some is true and some is false, than this is this is the show for you.

Hetalia fans shall rejoice at this season! XD

4898133,5,B005W2BWPS,I became a huge a fan of Hetalia a few months ago. I love its humor and its cast of characters. What makes the limited edition a must is that you get a purple Prussia bandanna. It really cool and I love wearing it. I tired to find the limited editions of seasons 1 and 2 but had no luck. So if you love Hetalia your going to love this.,1382313600,,335,3.8

4898137,5,B005W2BWPS,"The hetalia series as I'm a fan of has a very interesting way of telling history and getting children into reading the history that they're supposed to be learning in class.

4898151,5,B005W2BWPS,"We had to wait a while for season 3 to come out in English and the dub doesn't disappoint. I would joke that the dub intentionally makes more innuendoes then necessary but I still find them hilarious.

The season focuses on Germany, Spain and Prussia according to the cover but I think Japan, England and America get their fair amount of screen time as well. Ironically, despite being the main character, Italy is kind of pushed back in this season in favor of the characters mentioned above. Like season 2, season 3 jumps all over the timeline as well but this time it's more justified given the title of season 3 is World Series (and not Axis Power).  I would joke that this season has the ""most action"" in the series but that title still goes to the Hetalia Paint it White movie of having 8 minutes of action sequence. We see Hungary fight (or kick the Prussian armies ass) single handily and we also get an attempted battle by Spain vs. Turkey (doesn't go anywhere sadly but this side of Spain is cool).

The main timelines are the 17th century, and the 12-15th (again I'm not sure what timeline Spain has a lot of power but it might be around the 17th century as well), and the modern era. There is only one serious episode if you consider that episode serious (you're no by how the music stops and how the colors get all dark and it's an America episode so...)

I find this season more hilarious in the dub given how Spain curses a lot in Spanish (calling Austria a ""Puta"" is so OOC for him but funny given the situation). Again like I say with the other Hetalia season DVDs, pick it up because it's cheap and easy to get into and at this point, you should know who the characters are (my dad has at this point).",1361836800,3,1718,4.342679127725857

4898178,4,B005W2BWPS,"Alright let's get this out of the way and then I'll get to the actual review:  Funimation needs to crack down on people whom post clips or episodes from this or any series so that this way people don't get funny parts spoiled by users.  Its just a bit of an annoyance rather than a convenience in my opinion

Now that I got that out of the way onto the actual review...

This DVD covers the first 24 episodes of the series so, for those that enjoyed ""The War of Austrian Succession"" like me, you'll be pleased to know that its on this disc along with the episode when my favorite Austrian aristocrat was forced to stay with Germany and trust me when I call that the beginning of the ""Austrian blackmail"" scenario :)

Speaking of Austria his role is once again voiced by Mr. Chuck Huber and once again the ending for the first couple of episode of ""World Series"" is ""Marukaite Chikyuu"" (incidentally during this writing I'm listening to Austria's version).  It isn't until they get to about say episode 10 (maybe a little earlier) that they change over to the actual theme for ""World Series"" which is ""Hata futte parade!"" (and if that's misspelled I apologize) which I actually kind of like better.  It should be noted by the way that when they do the Marukaite Chikyuu they only did a few of the of the Axis and Allies before the changeover.  It kind of makes you wonder why, for the world series they didn't use some of the other countries versions but oh well.

The inside of the DVD was interesting as it showed three of the Nordics and Sealand (obviously to tie in with one of the episodes) but the funny thing is the episode that this would be a reference to actually isn't on the disc so, unless you did a look for an episode guide you'd be clueless as to why that was even there.

Maybe it was because a lot of the skits were on Youtube but a lot of the jokes lost their effect because you could find the eps on Youtube from the dub for free making them more tired than they should be...although Austria's reaction to seeing Germany in boxers was actually priceless!  I'm not gonna tell you WHY that happened but you have to watch the season to see the joke in full effect and trust me its worth it.

So with all of this that I said why is it a 4 out of 5?  Not just because of Austria being involved but because there was some priceless comedy involving GermanyxItaly, the Chibi RomanoxSpain skits were drop dead funny and Austria's straight pwnage of Germany.  Have you figured out yet that Austria is my favorite character?

If you are going to buy this season do yourself a favor and DON'T watch it on Youtube at all.  If you do you might tire of the jokes before you are meant to and that's just not AWESOME like it should be!

Have a good night",1350777600,,2757,4.312015503875969
4898179,5,B005W2BWPS,"Let me start off by saying how much I love Hetalia. I am also going to assume anyone reading my review loves Hetalia as well, and has probably already watched these episodes online. Ok, moving on.

The product arrived right on time and in great condition. The case comes inside a cardboard slip cover that has the same pictures and info that the case has. The front of the case features Prussia, Germany, and Spain. The Side of the case has Chibi Russia. On the back is description much like the one on Amazon. (Some of it is verbatim). There is a picture of Chibi China, and another of Romano and Spain.

If you take the slip cover out of the case you will find a lovely photo of Iceland, Sealand, Sweden, and Finland.

Moving right along. This DVD contains 24 episodes on disk one (1). Disk two (2) contains the commentary, textless song, trailers, exct... You can read about the extras in more detail in the ""Special Features"" section of the Amazon page.

I am very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this to any and all Hetalia fans.",1349913600,,1049,4.476439790575916

4. The only flaw: it has troubles playing. I had to manually go over the Windows Media Player to play the DVD. If you're going to select ""Play"" in the DVD drive it's in, it will not recognize the program it should play in. It's like confused, like most characters in this series. Also, if you usually play DVDs via VLC player or Real, it will not play. Not even DivX would. Use Windows MP.

4898225,5,B005W2BWPS,"Hetalia is the sequel to Hetalia: Axis Powers (I highly recommend, that). Hetalia is a series where all the characters are countries, shown as people. The show is a comedy but also puts a twist on history. Before I started watching Hetalia, my history grade was a standard B+, but after I started watching it, it has become a steady A or A+. Before Hetalia, I wasn't thrilled to go into history class everyday; now, I look forward to it, and enjoy geography as well. Hetalia increased my interest in geography and I began to study it more often in my free time. Because of Hetalia, I won my school's geography bee. I never thought a Japanese anime could improve my academic skills in such a way Hetalia did, but it did.

This season was packed with 24 ((or 26, i forgot, but im pretty sure its 24,)) awesome episodes!
This season came with a purple bandana, COVERED in nothing but Prussia! so this is a must-get for all Prussia lovers!
The box it came it was a tad bit bent, but nothing major, and it was expected to happen when it was shipped.
The whole set inculded:
--Bandana
--Dvd with 2 discs, The DVD with the episodes and an EXTRAS disc with a few random and amusing things on there.

4898227,4,B005W2BWPS,"If you like Hetalia previously, you will continue to like it now. I skipped from 1 to 3 since I couldn't get a hold of 2 in the store I was in. I got the limited edition, since it's the same price as the normal edition. The humor is the same, the extras are nice though the commentary track is lackluster. The constant talk about her management of the series makes me wonder how close it really stays at times, though I haven't watched subbed. Prussia is pretty awesome, as well as other characters who get a focus now that it's not just about World War 2.

The two things that confuse me are 1. It comes with a bandanna. Cool, but you have to figure a highly specific group of people even wear a bandanna. (Hetalia fans are apparently that group?) 2. My actual packaging references Sealand a lot, yet he's not in this episode set at all, nor is he mentioned in the near identical summary's anywhere else. If you have an explanation for that, let me know! It's not Pirated because I got it from Best Buy.

There's really not much more to say, it's Hetalia! Lots of boys love related jokes, MA rated humor, mocking the world. The reason I rate 4 instead of 5 is really because series 1 was a little better for me, but 4 is still a good rating.",1331856000,,1242,4.236286919831223

Non-stop laughs, yet some intriguing facts and some historical events are rubbed in, too. I recommend this to any sort of anime fan, since most genres - besides gore/horror/mystery/violence/action - are covered, but it's mainly humor. Better yet, most of the characters aren't obnoxious, unlike most characters these days, and will have you waving and saluting their flag and wanting to learn the country's national anthem.
Well.
Maybe.

4898262,4,B005W2BWPS,"This latest installment of Hetalia has been long awaited and it delivers what it promises! The only thing I have to complain about are just a couple of episodes based on my own personal preferences. This DVD focuses more on countries we've seen only glimpses of before (Greece, Prussia, Spain) but all of our favorites have at least 2 episodes for them! Once again, the acting is hilarious, and I can't wait for the next set to come out! The only extras I found to take a look at are the commentaries on certain episodes and the outtakes...the History Behind Hetalia is okay, but its excerpts of articles explaining actual historic events, I thought it was going to be about how Hetalia was created or something. So, if you're a Hetalia fan, of COURSE I recommend this. If you're a casual fan of the series, then it's a toss up for you, mainly because if you didn't like things like Chibitalia, it makes a semi-come back.

While I'm not a big fan of the English voice dubbing that Funimation did for this particular series, it's still very lovely to get on DVD. Shipping was remarkably fast, seeing as I got it a day before the release date, which was supposed to be the 17th of January, but I certainly am not complaining. xD Definitely an essential for any fan of the Hetalia series, especially since the limited edition comes with a special casing and a Hetalia bandana. This season featured the very popular character, Prussia, on a purple bandana. These bandanas, themselves, are wonderful collectables. They come in the limited editions of all seasons, as well as the movie, ""Paint It White."" Makes a terrific gift or collection piece.",1327881600,,845,4.834482758620689
4898267,5,B005W2BWPS,"I watched most of this on youtube, but anyway Hetalia world series is slightly different from hetalia axis power as you meet more countries that you've never meet before. Not to mention that you get to see all your fav. characters from axis power hetalia. Futhermore if you read hetalia axis power book 2 you'll see some things from that in the world series. It also has all new endings that weren't in the axis power. I bought the limited edition and the difference is that it comes with something extra for example a banndana. I noticed there was a different one from each hetalia dvd the axis power had blue and pink, and the movie had green.",1327622400,,645,4.47457627118644
4898268,5,B005W2BWPS,"The extra couple of bucks for the limited edition is worth it, especially if you are a fan of Prussia. The purple Prussia bandanna is adult sized, durable and of course, awesome.

The commentaries are a blast to listen too. Personally, I loved the 'revolutionary brothers' commentary the best. Eric Vale is a blast to listen to. However, listening to the voice actors for Prussia and Romano in the first one is priceless.

Th English cast is wonderful, although I am still getting used to Poland's English voice. It's very good, just not what I was expecting.
And yes, you will get to hear Sweden call Denmark(I hope I got that right) his wife in English.

The episodes are fantastic in quality and seeing more characters adds to the fun. And you will laugh as Hungary demands Prussia give back Austria's happy place. Yes, happy place.

Well worth the buy, honestly, especially given it's re-watch value. It's hard to view these episodes just once.",1327104000,5,948,4.762195121951219
4898309,5,B005W2BWPS,"If you are a fan of Hetalia or at least anime, this will be a must have. I love Hetalia and there is no exception to this product. I was pleased that it arrived at the exact date it expected and was in perfect condition. This show is one of the best I've ever watched and you should consider getting it for yourself.",1327104000,,316,4.031746031746032
4898310,5,B005W2BWPS,"In this dvd, Prussia and Greece get more screentime and are completely hilarious with their roles. Lithuania is worried about Russia's plot to take over Poland and frustrated with Poland's idiotic attitude toward it! Not to mention Spain and Chibi Romano are definitely adorable! If you are considering getting this anime BUY IT!!! Seriously this is one of the funniest animes yet!",1327104000,,381,5.161290322580645
4898311,4,B005W2BWPS,"Don't get me wrong, I prefer dubs. I also love those 'OMG, that can't be what they originally said' moments when you turn on the subtitles and reverse to see what the original dialog was. The English version is usually a lot funnier.

But I ended up watching most of this season with the subtitles on.  There were moments in the show which were meant to be cute and sweet and emotional, but Funimation seems to feel a need to fill every single minute with off-color humor now, whether it's particularly funny or not.  Guys, there's such a thing as 'too much of a good thing.' Rein it in a little and let the spirit of the show come through.

One other slight disappointment was, after Sealand being prominently mentioned on the back of the package and pictured inside, I expected a bit more of him. Thinking back, I can't actually remember his appearing at all (though that might be faulty memory, or maybe I dozed off and missed something.)

Apart from that, this season is good fun as usual, with lots of old favorite characters, plus new countries appearing. My favorite part was when France decided to repair his economy by emulating Switzerland and forming a bank to launder foreign money. Also loved America's Christmas party scenes.",1327017600,,1239,4.665137614678899
4898312,5,B005W2BWPS,"With most anime series I watch, I like to wait a while after the release of the newest dvds before ordering them...however, I really couldn't wait on this one! It actually arrived at my house a day before it was supposed to as well, haha...

While I haven't watched the dubbed version *quite* yet, I've seen parts of the subtitled version, and this newest season has some great material in it. Plenty of new characters are introduced, and characters who were no more than side characters are now getting more screen time. The jokes are quite good as well. France's infamous Sex-Ed with Italy scene has to be one of my favorites.

Overall, I'm looking forward to finally seeing the dubbed version (along with my brother, who's also a big Hetalia fan), and I hope there's more to be released in the future.",1326672000,,804,4.615384615384615
4898313,5,B005W2BWPS,"Hetalia seasons one and two were SOOOOOO AHHMAZING! Can't wait for season three!!!!! <333333333
