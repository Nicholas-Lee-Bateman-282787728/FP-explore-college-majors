8233944,4,B000YR5UA4,"I really liked this Lila's yoga CD.  It was easy to do, which means I did it more often.  I think it is helping with arthritis and hip pain.  Thank you Lilas!",1372636800,,158,3.875
8233945,2,B000YR5UA4,"I have several of Lilias' yoga dvds and have been very satisfied with all of them. However, this one is the exception. The other dvds have complete sessions of about 25-30 mins each, a comfortable practice time for most busy users. But this one is fragmented. There are two or three warmups that don't go anywhere. Very little asana practice. I don't recommend this dvd.",1341100800,4,370,4.707692307692308
8233946,3,B000YR5UA4,just curious to see what an older person could teach me about doing yoga even in the golden years.  I was surprised to see how flexible Lilias was.  Slow and easy to follow.  Disappointed that I didn't receive the book that went with the DVD.  Should have complained to amazon but didn't take the time.  Good for the senior generation.,1284854400,,335,4.516666666666667
