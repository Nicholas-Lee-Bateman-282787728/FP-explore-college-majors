1235163,4,B00000JNCG,"This is the 2nd movie in the Sailor moon movie collection. I feel this one is tied as best with Promise of the Rose. This one has Sailor moon and all the outer sailor scouts try to save the world from a deadly freeze or ice age on Earth. The movie has a lot of messages and deeper meanings for relationships and love. At the end is a epic battle between Sailor moon and the evil queen, and she uses the silver crystal!

This movie is very touching and some sad moments.",1443916800,,469,4.0978260869565215

1235172,5,B00000JNCG,"The second Sailor Moon movie is my second favorite.  As an evil ice queen threatens to freeze the world, Luna falls in love with a human astronomer.  It's interesting to note that this is the only of the 3 movies based on a manga story.  The manga version was good, but I find this adaption better simply because the absence of Diana helped a lot.  In the manga, it really put a downer on any romantic tension because if she exists it's evident that her parents will get together, so it felt like she was having an affair, whereas in the anime I realize why they waited until SuperS to introduce Diana.  This movie also has the usual Sailor Moon charm; good action, great animation, funny comedy and some very heartwarming moments all mixed together for one memorable experience, whether it's in English or Japanese.  I honestly thought the producers for both did a great job.",1381449600,,876,4.583333333333333

1235181,4,B00000JNCG,"I loved this movie, both in English and Japanese. I have some positive and negative feed back thought.

Positive Feed Back: the story was heart warming, despite that it is a movie about ice and snow. I really felt Luna's pain and I wanted her to find love, but not with who she was crushing on. I also adored Usagi (Serena)'s speech at the huge fight scene. Sailor Moon always has great empowering speeches about life and love. Sometimes, when I want to cry happy tears or write a great scenes for one of my novels, I watch just that segment.

Negative Feed Back: Luna's choice in relationship was disturbing to me. Even though I wanted Luna to fall in love and I felt for her, I still didn't like her crush. I felt it was wrong considering that she is a cat and not a human, and her crush was a human. She even kisses him. Very, very wrong.",1372550400,,841,4.25

1235183,5,B00000JNCG,"I rate this movie 5 stars, because I've been wanting it for years, and because this movie teaches you that really loving someone is wanting their happiness. The movie is originally from 1994, but was released in America on May 23,2000.  It's a great anime, and in my opinion the Dic background music (this is the English edited version) makes it more actiony. This is a great movie, I can still remember back in 2001 when it was shown on Cartoon Network, and how bummed I was that I missed it. The Outer Sailor Scouts, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, join our regular Heroines and feline friends. The Ice Queen is pure evil, she wants to freeze Earth and make it part of her ""Exquisite Collection"", as she put it. It's a good movie, but be aware that this is the edited version, if you prefer the uncut one, I suggest the English subtitled one, or the uncut DVD, with both English and Japanese Language Tracks.",1371859200,,905,4.484848484848484

1235198,5,B00000JNCG,"Next to Sailor Moon R The Promise Of The Rose , i'd have to say Hearts In Ice is the next best thing. Not only because it has the outter Senshi , But the story is a tear jerker, It teach's you about love and pain and hardships. I think its deff a movie to see :).",1137628800,,263,3.6315789473684212
1235199,5,B00000JNCG,"Such a cute and touching tale.  Luna falls head over heals in love...not for Artemis (sorry man) but for a scientist.  Guess she likes the intellectual types...especially when they save her life.  Although love is in bloom in december, the scouts have a new problem and enemy on their hands.  an evil ice queen is trying to freeze over the entire earth and add it to her collection of frozen planets...immediatly the scouts step up to meet the threat...but the only way to defeat her is my the legendary silver crystal power of love and friendship....will sailor moon use the silver crystal and forfeit her life to save the planet? Not if the scouts can help it!

Okay, thats a brief summary of the basic plot...but there is so muchmore to say about it, but sadly that would take up an entire page...not to mention i don't want to give away what will happen or what comes of Luna's new love.  But here are some tasty tid-bits...THIS IS THE ONLY ANIMATED SAILOR MOON WHERE YOU WILL SEE LUNA IN HER HUMAN FORM...thats right...Luna goes homo-sapien and it gets better...not only are the original scouts in this movie...but so are sailor neptune, uranus, and pluto! The outer senshi fight along side our favorite sailors!  Not too mention this plot is so enticing it literally sucks you in full force with suspense and action...making you sit on the edge of your seat wondering...""will luna get with her new fling....will artemis be able to steal her back...and will the scouts succeed in their endeavors?""

-Character Profiles

-Uncut

-And more!

Running time is approx. 60 minutes with a 13+ rating, mostly due to violent fighting in the last battel scene, and seeing Luna a bit nude when she turns into a human.  One note on the last battel scene, i believe it to be one of the best battle scenes ever made in sailor moon...it gets viloent and downright mean as it should...so of your into good battles....this is one of the best.",1105660800,15,2056,4.685236768802229
1235200,5,B00000JNCG,"I get the Sailor Moon movies from Netflix. When I ordered this one, I thought it was the best Sailor Moon movie ever. I can't really remember it though. I've only seen it once. The Sailor Moon movies i'm dying to get are Black Dream Hole, Pegasus Collection volume 2 (I've seen the first already), Sailor Moon the series volume 2, and The Return of Sailor Moon (witch I can't get on Netflix). I am a big fan of anime my two favorites are Yu-Gi-Oh and Sailor Moon. This is a MUST see movie.",1104019200,,489,4.212765957446808
1235201,5,B00000JNCG,"My title says it all, I love this movie!  Not only does it include all the Sailor Scouts (Except Sailor Saturn), but it has a touching story, and an ending that gives you the oppurtunity to see a side of the most-focused-on character, Luna, that many of us have never seen before.  Actually, the whole movie talks about Luna, and her feelings, which is a change.  Usually the focus is Serena, or one of the other Sailor Scouts.

I loved getting to see all of the scouts' transformations and attacks, especially Uranus's attack ""Uranus World Shaking"", and Pluto's transformation, in which she ends in a glamorous pose.  I thought the story was so romantic, and although a tiny bit strange, still touching, and adorable.  The villain, Princess Snow Kaguya, and her snow dancers can be a little bit irritating at times, but prove to be at least fairly decent villains.

If you like Sailor Moon, you'll love this movie!  And if you're simply someone looking for a taste of Sailor Moon, this is the movie I'd recommend to you to introduce the Sailor Scouts, and what you'll be seeing in Sailor Moon books, movies, etc.

CAUTION:  Not all Sailor Moon products are clean, many of them aren't.  This movie is decently clean, but the manga and a particular season of the TV series were very inappropriate.  You may not agree, but I still wouldn't recommend anything Sailor Moon to anyone under twelve or thirteen.",1098316800,,1404,4.709016393442623
1235202,4,B00000JNCG,"At the moment, the Amazon page for this movie is a bit screwy.  It lists the description and mingles versions of the Sailor Moon S movie with SuperS.  These are **two different movies**.  Amazon, please fix this page.

Anyway, this movie also known as ""Black Dream Hole"" is largely about Chibi-Usa (Rini) much like the SuperS series itself.  Don't be discouraged however! It's a very fun film even if you're not a fan of Sailor Chibi-Moon (Mini-Moon in the dub).

This is the last time we hear Terri Hawkes (Sailor Moon), Sabrina Grdevich (Pluto), Tracey Hoyt (Mini-Moon), Stephanie Morgenstern (Venus) and Karen Bernstein (Mercury) voice the characters that they have done in the first two seasons.  The next two seasons were recorded after the movies.

Keep in mind that this is the debut for Lafleur as Uranus and so she voiced her very femininely compared to her more appropriately tomboy performance in the series.  Neptune is consistent ... in using the exact same voice as Sailor Moon's mom.  The original Pluto breaks from her perfect performance at the end of the second season; the director has the actress (featured in Spielburg's AI... see the Amazon page for her photo on the upper left of the DVD cover) voicing the character completely differently.

That said, avoid the dub on any of the three movies.  The movies mark the final appearence by many of the original cast members.  However, the direction is abyssmal and the sometimes wonderful English cast isn't even sometimes wonderful in these films.  The translations are also at their worst with the movies. Oddly, according to the credits Optimum has maintained the same writers throughout four seasons and movies; the scripts are not by DiC or CWi as many fans insist.  These writers are reportedly under strict time constraints and are consistently inconsistent with their adptation of the english translation.  Fortunately, the DVD includes the original Japanese audio track with English subtitles.

The movie itself features excellent animation theatrical quality work. The famous Japanese cast does an outstanding job.  This movie is the most kid friendly of the three, especially compared to the S movie's topless villain-who Cartoon Network aired completely for a full barebreasted two hours without complaints...  The childlike fairies of these movie and the fun plot is something Sailor Moon fans will enjoy.  Neptune and Uranus debut new attacks using their talisman items as shown in the series.  Saturn is noticably absent from all three movies, but with so many great characters and a excellent plot there's plenty to enjoy.",1094947200,2,2607,5.101415094339623
1235203,5,B00000JNCG,"This movie is focused on Luna and an astronomer kakeru who saves her life from getting hit by a car, and takes care of her when she is sick. He discovers a stone that was sent here by princess snow kaguya who plans to freeze the earth. The animation on the dvd is so much better than the vhs. If anyone is saying to themselves ill buy the vhs because its just sailor moon and its cheaper. Don't, because its not worth it. With this dvd you get japanese and english language. English Subtitles, and great animation. What more could you ask for.",1084665600,,543,4.281553398058253
1235204,5,B00000JNCG,"This review is for the edited, dubbed version.  I have not seen the uncut one.
  Hearts in Ice is a beautiful, action-packed, sailor-stuffed movie that will make you cry.  For an animated movie, the love story in ""Hearts"" is as intense as one in any German opera or  Russian novel.  And, the one struck by Cupid's arrow is not one of our schoolgirls or their chums - it is little Luna.
  Every senshi is in this movie, with the exception of Sailor Saturn.  We get to see them all work together, ALL their gorgeous transformations, and ALL their attacks.  The climatic battle where they all unite is amazing, and had to be saved for a film:  it is too cinematic for a thirty-minute TV episode.
  The lameness of the villian and her annoying henchmen can be overlooked because of the crisp and gorgeous animation and the skilled voice talents.  The winter setting is a refreshing change from the perpetual spring/summer of the series.
  I do not feel I have missed out by watching the dubbed, edited version.  I own a variety of both sub and dub, cut and uncut SM, so I know what I am saying when I feel nothing has been compromised here.  Finally, this movie is not a short one like SM R.  It is a full-length feature, so you will get your money's worth, even if you pay list price.",1081555200,,1281,4.397435897435898
1235205,5,B00000JNCG,"I'm a big fan of the book and wonder if we'll ever be able to see the last ever series of sailormoon on dvd??! sailor moon stars.... does it exist yet??
Being in england we've only just seen series 1 and 2, so the only way I can enjoy it is using amazon!
p.s I thought this dvd was lovely. you should buy it to get your own opinion! If you don't like it, auction it! but i love sailormoon!!!!",1075507200,,392,3.9125
1235206,5,B00000JNCG,"This is my favourite of the three movies, mostly because it focuses on Luna. The cats get neglected in the series as far as character plot goes, acting more as exposition pushers than anything else. It's nice to see a movie about Luna's feelings.
I would suggest people see this with the original Japanese vocals, if only because Luna sounds much cuter that way, as opposed to her haughty librarian-esque vocals in the English versions",1072483200,,435,4.8133333333333335
1235207,4,B00000JNCG,"When I first saw this, I didn't expect anything big or small, so it was just what I pedicted.
I also wish they would come out with more movies of Sailor Moon and have them be longer.
The summary of this movie is basic:
A scientist sees a comet and gets a weird crystal that fell after the comet did. The next day, Luna is sick. The scientist saves her, and after a while, she falls in love with him, neglecting Artemis! Then Luna notices the crystal makes him weak. And a snow princess ccomes to earth wanting to freeze the earth and get her crystal back, and it's up to the sailor scouts to stop her.",1065484800,,601,4.145299145299146
1235208,4,B00000JNCG,"Okay, I know for a fact that they cut some stuff out of the dub of this series, but there was one thing that they left in, which really was rather important to all of those Haruka/Michiru fans out there.
The outer senshi, who are by far the coolest people on the show, do a lot with slightly obsessiveness and 'We cannout work with you' in the S series, which makes it hard for some to figure why they are in this movie, doing the whole 'I won't let you die, Sailor Moon'.
Frankly, the only one who would care if Sailor Moon lived or died out of the outer senshi would be Pluto, and that's only because she knows what's gunna happen to them ^^.
The dub of this movie was quite bad. But the main reason that I bought it was to see if there really was something going on between Uranus and Neptune.  They dubbed it clever, but some of the action you couldn't take out.
Like when Haruka (rather protectively) grabs Michiru and pulls her out of the way of a 'snow faerie'.
So what?  The dub was good, so much can be said for the voices, which ...  I really did like Pu's voice in the R series, what ever happened to that Voice Actress?  But all in All.  DVD would be the best way to go.",1050192000,,1182,4.077586206896552
1235209,5,B00000JNCG,"My main problem with the Sailor Moon movies was that they seemed like drawn-out TV episodes. However, Sailor Moon S The Movie was the only exception. First of all, this is the only episode where you can watch Luna turn into a human. Second, I do think Mamoru (Darien) and Usagi (Serena) are at their most romantic in this movie. Third, the Outer Senshi are here! What more could you ask for?! My favorite parts were when Luna asked Usagi (Serena) how she spends time with Mamoru (Darien) and when the Sailor Senshi were talking about Luna and Artemis got so upset that he left the room...you just have to watch it to know what I mean! If you're going to buy only one Sailor Moon video, buy this one! In fact, if you're going to buy anything Sailor Moon at all, start with this!",1047600000,,777,4.36551724137931

1235211,5,B00000JNCG,"Such a sweet and cute little movie about Luna! I also own the subtitled version of this, and I think the sub theme songs are so much cuter and better than in the dub!",1031011200,,166,3.911764705882353
1235212,5,B00000JNCG,"This is probably the best Sailor Moon ever! the story is creative and is sad. It made me cry! This movie gives you another side of Luna and even Atemis. Usually the plots in SM stay on Usagi and Mamoru. But this time, on Luna who falls in love with a human and it shows her abstacles of being in love. I bought this movie and was a good purchase.  I would recomend buying the DVD of coarse just because if you get the VHS than it will probably come dubbed, and the dubbing is bad, sorry,but it is. The subs. are so much better in SM R movie and SM S movie.",1027641600,,556,3.920353982300885
1235230,5,B00000JNCG,"There's a lot to say about this series and a few words can't describe how this anime makes me feel. Naoko Takeuchi makes her character so real sometime you forget they are only drawings one t.v.  Everything is heartfelt and even though the plot looks the same as any plot in a heroine/hero movie or series it isn't.  The earth is attacked by an ice maiden(if you want to call her that)  she wants to freeze the earth and to make it a pretty piece of crystal she can put in the rest of her collection.  First the enemy has to face the sailor scouts, what makes this series special is that all the scouts are in presence (in exception of saturn) the story is very heartfelt and it will make some cry.  Everything has a point every detail makes a difference in it's own self.  All I have to say it's wow, the translation has weak points but it still doesn't affect the exellence of this great series.  The music as always amazing and pleasing to hear and adds more greatness to the anime. Th great speech given by sailor moon to the ice maiden and all the scouts fighting together including the outer sailor previously not very favorable with the inner scouts.  This movie is worth it and takeuchi is at her best. Heartfelt, Funny and Important  UNFORGETTABLE!!AMAZING!!HEARTS ON ICE MORE LIKE HEARTS ON FIRE.",1026432000,2,1306,4.476793248945148
1235231,5,B00000JNCG,"I found this movie very enjoyable.
It has many events going on during the whole thing, so it doesn't just stick to one idea and get boaring.
You could say it is all about Snow Queen Kaguya trying to freeze earth over, or you could say it is all about Luna falling in love with a human.  But really, it is both.  The two end up tying together in the end.
There is even a little comedy in the movie.  There are two distinct parts I remember finding some humor in.
People who are fans of Luna (Serina's cat) will enjoy this movie because it has a lot to do with her.  But even if you are not a fan of Luna, and just like Sailor Moon, you will probably like this movie, too.",1025827200,,670,3.9776119402985075
1235232,5,B00000JNCG,I Love this video sooooooo much! I want to see it again. Sailormoon and her scouts show all of there power to defeat the ice queen. Sailormoon finally show's her crystal to stop the ice queen from burying the city. And Luna likes somebody other than Artimis. This was the must perfect movie ever!,1020556800,,296,4.5
1235233,4,B00000JNCG,"Of the three full length movies, of which I have the subtitled versions, S is my favourite.  Why?  It has classic sci-fi archetypes, such as strange meteors falling to Earth heralding alien invasion, ancient myths turning out to be fact, and aliens exhibitng powers of extreme cold.  There might also be a spin-off the the Japanese Yuki-onna (snow demoness) who lure exhausted travellers having collapsed in blizzard to sleep.
While stargazing, Kakeru, an astronomer, finds a comet, parts of which land.  He drives out to where a particle landed, only to find an odd shaped crystal, which turns out to be a weapon that can turn Earth into a giant spherical popsicle for a Snow Queen.  Not only that, but over time, it drains him of his life energy.
Before long, the Snow Queen sends her Snow Dancers to hunt down the crystal.  In the process, they zap people and cars, turning them into blocks of ice.  Once the Sailor Scouts repel the forward party, the ice melts, and things instantly go back to normal, as if nothing has happened.  Things settle down after that, but that's the proverbial calm before the storm.
The key character and the most likeable is none of the humans, but Luna the female black cat.  A concerned Guardian type who scolds Usagi to study for her entrance exams, she starts the story with a fever, foolishly walks home in her ill state, and is nearly run over by a sports car if not for Kakeru, who throws himself in harm's way and prevents her from being roadkill.  So touched is Luna, that she starts to fall in love with the human to the point that she wishes she were human.  She keeps thinking ""I'm only a cat.""  Well guess what?  There's nothing ""only"" about being a cat.  A funny moment is when Kakeru thinks that whoever named Luna must be elegant.  We're then treated to a thought of Luna of Usagi, who is laughing loudly.
If there is a theme here, it is the conflict between cold, scientific logic, and mystical romanticism.  Kakeru, despite being having doctorates in physics, biology, medicine, and astronomical engineering, might be better suited as a poet or fantasy writer in contrast to his girlfriend Himeko.  A parallel can also be seen between the learned white cat Artemis and the tender-hearted Luna.  This struggle is magnified in the struggle between the Snow Queen and the Sailor Scouts.  The difference is, the struggle can be reconciled on a human level.  Scientists and romantics are perfect opposites for each other.
Maybe this is a goof or intended, but when transforming into their super selves, the sequence shows Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Venus, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto.  Surely Venus should have come second?
There is also the concept of happiness being a compliment of sadness, a theme also referred to in the Doctor Who story The Happiness Patrol.  That's basically what Sailor Moon tells the Snow Queen in the confrontation between them.
Not bad of its type, and the story is long enough to flesh out the plot, and these characters in particular:  Luna, Kakeru, and Moon.  Enjoy, and from Luna, Meooooww!",1019520000,,3064,4.759469696969697
1235234,5,B00000JNCG,"This is the best movie yet it has a sweet story mostly about luna and the bad thing is that Uranus and Neptune don't have that many lines just like in the Super S movie as well, But this dvd is a must have for sailor moon fans and if you are a die hard sailor moon fan just buy all 3 movie in the Dream box dvd set you will love it just as much.",1019260800,,345,3.5526315789473686
1235235,3,B00000JNCG,"I would like to say that this movie was unexceptable in many  ways. First of all, Sailor Moon R-Promise of the Rose was my favorite out of all three, and this movie just did not live up to my standards.
Secondly, the voices in the dubbed (especially Trista's {Setsuna's} were off. Also, there were many, how should I say, ""sappy"" morals in the story, which I don't care for.
Third, the movie was based on Luna and the human Kakuru, and how Luna learns how to truly love.
It's also about a new enemy, but her actual name is never really mentioned. (I suppose that she is Snow Princess Kagua?)
Snow Princess Kagua wants to freeze the Earth to make it part of her ""collection.""
She uses her snow dancers to turn the city that Sailor Moon is living and continents around the world into a world of death-a peaceful slumber trapped in ice.
Of course Super Sailor Moon uses her Silver Imperium Crystal and the aid of the Sailor Scouts...and you can decide what happens from there.
The story expands from there, if at all. I do not reccomend this movie for any Sailor Moon fan, subtitled, dubbed, or in any form available.",1019001600,,1114,4.46078431372549

Sounds like a perfect DVD, ne?  The only downfall is the extras.  Most of them are nice, with the senshi's transformations, clips of their attacks, etc.  In the extras, they have character profiles, and while they're somewhat accurate, some things do not make sense, and they're hard to read.

This is my favorite of the SM movies, and it was the first time I had seen Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto in animated form, and I was so impressed. They give the film a more rounded feel since they are older characters and have an elegant approach to fighting evil. This has a stronger dramatic sub-plot, which is why it's my favorite, developing Luna's character (Sailor Moon's little kitty friend) in a way not possible in any of the 5 seasons of the TV show or the other 2 movies.

You can barely make out what Sailor Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto were saying. Sailor Uranus just sorta blurted it out really fast and that was it. The story was ok, although my brother could not make out as to why the Ice Queen sent out those crystals to earth, only to start looking for them again as if they were lost. The animation however was excellent, most of the story is too. I particularly like it when they finally give importance to Luna. She is mostly portrayed really strict. And yet in this one, we finally see the softer side of Sears...err...I mean Luna. In the end their suits turn all white and the sequence is beautiful. I actually gave it more stars than what I thought, mainly because I'm an ber moonie. I strongly suggest you buy the sub. Also, Sailor Moon R movie is the best Sailor Moon movie out there. So, I suggest you buy the SMR movie before the SMS one. That one was well made, although some of the dubbing changed the story a little, it remains loyal to the original.",1001635200,,1145,4.28110599078341

While dealing with love, holidays, and a disappearing cat, will the Sailor Soldiers be able to defeat the Snow Princess, or will the Earth be turned into ice? The only way to find out is to watch the movie!

Review for Dub

I honestly can say that the dub of this okay, however, I can't say that without saying that the dub turns a good movie into a terrible one. Luna's voice, Jill Frappier, sounds a little too old for Luna in this movie. While she does a fabulous job, it just sounds a little bad, so I recommend getting the subtitled version.",1000425600,,1054,4.46875
1235243,5,B00000JNCG,"Sailor Moon S is a great flick with some minor glitches, but all together, it's a buy you won't regret. The movie begins with the senshi on their winter vacation. Luna comes down with a fever and is being cured by an astronomer. His name is Kakeru. Luna starts to fall in love with him after a while. The situation turns bad for Luna as Kakeru's sort of girlfriend, Himoko, appears. Also, the senshi are facing a dillema when an evil ice queen Kaguya threatens to freeze the Earth and turn make it part of her collection. I cried the first time I saw this movie just because I'm emotional. Don't blame me! I think you'll feel more for the characters if you switch to Japanese with subtitles. The dub is just too, loud. The voices are, shrieky. The extras are something to be happy about. There's a picture gallery, a biography on each senshi, a story on Princess Snow Kaguya, and a preview of some Pioneer animation titles.",1000252800,,923,4.4674556213017755
1235244,2,B00000JNCG,"Ummm....some of the voices were really horrible, and the transformation music stunk. bad. but I am sure the Sub-titled is much better. the good thing about it, was the animation, and also the action, it was nice to see the scouts fighting for a change instead of using one attack and then giving it up to sailor Moon. it was also nice to discover the relationships between Luna and Serena, they are usually crabbing at eachother in the cartoon series. but it dragged on at some points...I would recommend buying the R movie before you buy this. This is better than the first SM movie though!",999648000,,591,4.584905660377358
1235245,3,B00000JNCG,"I have been trying to get this video for ages, and I finally did. Whew. It was rather good, all the old voices were casted, except for Amara's from  the English Dub S series. But, the outer senshi only have about three lines anyway, so it does not matter. Serena's voice was a bit difficult to understand, but I still liked it. The ending was kind of lame, there was no great music playing, but I guess it does not matter to much. There is a romantic scene between Serena & Darian, so that was wonderful to see!! I recomend getting the R movie -- The Promise of the Rose -- first, esp if you are a Serena & Darian fan, and the ending was *much* better. Well, that is it!! You can email me if you wanna chat about it.",994896000,,716,4.078014184397163
1235246,5,B00000JNCG,This is the greatest Sailor Moon movie out of the three. I used to always watch it when it was at the video store by myhouse but someone lost it. I think it is funny when the Snow Dancer looks away when Usagi and Chibi-Usa point up at the sky and say look over there. It is great at the end when the first nine scouts all fight the snow queen and when Luna becomes human and flys with Kekaru. I recommend this movie for all true fans who want to see the best of Sailor Moon. But I would recommend the subtitled version so you see the original.,994118400,,543,3.9908256880733943

It had terrible dubbing (ever seen a Godzilla movie?), Sailor Moon`s voice screeched, and it was so boring! The American Voice actors had NO emotion in their voices, and It was edited to peices. I own the Japanese versions of the series S, and all the movies. I KNOW what quality acting is. And this is far from it. It you even consider buying this movie, GET THE SUBTITLED VERSION.

1235263,3,B00000JNCG,"Personally I wouldn't reccommend this to anyone. I mean, it wasn't bad as far as dub is concerned, but it was still pretty bad. First of all I found Michiru-sans voice very unrealistic. Second, I thought that a few of the Japanese songs would have been more appropriate, but they atleast left 'Ai No Senshi', which helped a little. However this wasn't half as bad as Sailor Moon SuperS, that was horrible. Luna's old-english type voice was annoying, and the fact that they cut out the part of her transforming into a human severally P.O.ed me. Like I said at the beginning this wasn't bad for a dub, but if you can read than I wouold suggest the subtitled.",987465600,,656,4.5210084033613445

The Scouts team up and stop her. (The ending was surprising thats all I can say! ^_^) The movie was mainly based on Luna, Usagi's (or 'Sererna')cat. Luna falls for this one human who saved her life. (She was about to be hit by a car) The human is fasinated by the moon and dreams that there was life on the moon and actually a REAL princess who lived there.(Tee hee hee) The man becomes ill and Luna tries her best to help him, his GIRLFRIEND tries to help to. During this Luna also has an admiror, Artmeis. Luna is so busy with this human she doesn't even notice Arty. At the end Luna gives up and decides that it wasn't possible for a cat like her to love a human. Luna finally finds out about how Artimes feels about her and they live happily ever after.

It was a very cute movie about how Luna had a crush on a human and how Artemis was trying to win her heart. It was amazing at the end thats all I can say for those who haven't seen it. And it was nice to see the Inner Senshi and the Outer Senshi get along. (Although they didn't have a big part!) The movie was mainly based on Luna The cat and her feelings towards this human who saved her life and how she wished she didn't have to be in a 'Cats Body' so that she could actually have a chance with him. Finally Luna gives up and sees that she has another admiror...Artemis. Its a cute tale but mainly based on Luna. I would reccomend you buy it and rate it yourself.

The dub was great besides Pioneer, and DiC that has practicly ruined Sailor Moon and doesn't show how great it really is. Although the only thing they cut out was A nude scene where Luna/Princess Kaguya is spinnin' around naked for about a minute or two (eww...) and they changed the dialoge a little bit but nothing was really ruined, accept for Sailor Moon SuperS Dubbed (That was bad). DiC and Pioneer DON'T know how to dub!!! But now that I think of it the Dub was acctually better... (isn't that the weirdest!?!) To conclude this, This was...

It also for once has the Sailors getting knocked around to give it a more real placement! I also like it when Darien and Serena kiss for once a romance between them! Over all it's pretty good.

This is a close second for my favorite Sailor Moon movie. The plot is all about Luna's love for another human and a mysterious ice queen who plans to take over Earth by freezing it. Unlike the other Sailor Moon movies, this one goes more toward a human plot (or cat plot) than a superhero, save the world plot, and I think that's what makes this work. The only problem is toward the end it wants to turn into a save the world movie. The violence isn't there, even in the un-edited version, and neither is the language or sexual themes like the other features.(namely SM R) So this is the most suitable subtitled version for the younger viewers. Don't get me wrong, it isn't like the dub, it still has it's subtitled qualities. Such as the barbie doll-like nude transformation sequenses- which, of course, is edited out in the dub to where it looks like they almost have nothing. The main plot is where Luna falls in love with a human who saves her and nurses her back to health. She then proceeds to ponder about what love is and relizes that the best thing for him would be to stay with the woman he already loves. The second plot, which is paper thin, concerns an evil ice queen who wants to freeze and take over earth. She sends down her ice creatures to accomplish it. This, of course, gets Sailor Moon and the scouts attention who then proceed to stop her. Meanwhile, an ice crystal that she needs to take over Earth has been found by non other than Luna's human love. This is making him deathly sick and Luna then tries to save him. Once again, there is unintentially hilarious scenes. Namely the one where Luna is asking Usagi about her love with Momoru and with a sigh (that sounds like ""HaDeHa!) she falls off the dresser and with all four paws spread she goes ""LaLaLaLaLa."" After a few times of watching this you'll be laughing your head off. This is another great Sailor Moon movie that hasn't been butcherd by Dic. The dub isn't as bad as the first but the sub is still much better. I definately recommend you add this to your anime or sailor moon library. One more great reason for buying this movie is because it's our only chance to see the outer senshi in their original Japanese glory.",973468800,,2207,4.411764705882353

  This story starts with a scientist or something, and he discovers a rocket, a crystal falls. Kakeru drives to get it, and it's glowing. Next Morning, Rini and Serena eating some food, watching news in a big TV outside. Luna starts sneezing , because she has a cold. She leaves the group and walks home. There is a stoplight, and it says to go. Luna walks, but she feels a bit dizzy. The stoplight says go for cars. It goes, but Luna is still there! Kakeru, runs to Luna and gets her. That's a relief! He sends her to his house, and Luna wakes up. She was happy because he saved her.
  Okay! Down to the juicy parts! Snow Dancers come for a visit, and they attack ice at people.  Everyone is frozen. Serena and the others try to escape so they won't be frozen. Haruka(Amara), Michuru(Michelle),Setsuna(Trista) found out what's up. So they tranform into Sailor Scouts. The same with the others. One Snow Dancer is chasing Rini and Serena. They both tell her to look somewhere else, and she falls for it! Both of them got a chance to transform, and beat the Snow Dancer. They both statred battling. The Snow Dancer used some attack to make Sailor Moon and Sailor Chibi(Mini)Moon. They got dizzy. A Santa Claus, came by. But really it was Tuxedo Mask! LOL! Sailor Chibi Moon thought it was really Santa Claus. He hit the Snow Dancer, then Sailor Moon used her ""Moon Spiral Heart Attack."" Now everything turned back to normal.
  Back at Kakeru's house, Luna was doing fine and well. Kakeru wanted to know who owned Luna. She was thinking of Serena laughing. Kakeru decided to give her a name. Luna accidentally said her name. Kakeru started thinking at some names. The last name he said was Luna, and she meowed. Himeko came and told him the good news.
  Snow pitches in and Kakeru gets a cold. At Serena's place, all of them are lookig for Luna. so they split-up, and started to find her. Now at Kakeru's house, Luna wants to come in, but Himeko won't let her. She gets really depressed. Serena found Luna. Luna starts to cry, because she wants to be human.

Halfway through I felt the movie should've been named ""Luna's Story"" because she seemed to have a LARGE role in it. Not that I'm complaining about that or anything because I love Luna a bunch and her role was important to the plot, but while she got more screen time others like Sailor Uranus and Mini Moon, among others, had very small roles and didn't speak much.

The snow dancers where ANNOYING!  and may I add that Mini Moon,  Uranus,and Pluto had WAY different voices..hmmm I mean Uranus actually  sounded like a girly girl!  The plot was good and I liked the battel. You  also get to see each and every one of the scouts transform plus all their  attacks (which is really cool:) I'd reccomend this movie to watch and to  have as a collection.",966384000,2,672,4.304
1235306,5,B00000JNCG,"Sailor Moon S is Probely the Best Sailor Moon Movie out of The Three  Sailor Moon Movies Released. Especially if you get it in Subtitling. Its  Un-cut which mean they SHOW EVERYTHING they is some mild-nudity but not  that bad imagine a spinning barbie doll ((I quote this)) for 5 seconds. And  A Few Violent things a little bad language. If your a parent and Really  don't want your kids to see this go ahead and get the Dubbed. But you will  miss some things.
1. The opening is Diffrent for the theme in both  Japanese with English with Subtitling and dubbed.
2. They Slightly nick  the transformations in the dubs.
3. In the english Version they don't have  all the orginal Theme music
4. they cut out Slightly Violent images in  the dubbed
5. when Luna is a transforming ((i won't go any further on  this)) they cut it.
6. the ending theme for the dubbed is not  ""Moonlight Detsu"" and you well be also missing the ending  anmation
So for 10 dollars more you might want to BUY the Subtitled  instead of the subbed cause in which you will be missing things",966297600,,1057,4.381443298969073
1235307,4,B00000JNCG,This movie was great but R was much better in my opinion. Even though a  love story about Luna and the science guy was cool a movie needs some  action like it did in Sailor Moon R. I have never seen the Japanese version  but I know. Plus they didn't even play a song like they did in R in both  Japnanese and the dubbed. You may ask hold on how do you know they don't  play a song in Jpanese when you never seen it.

The ""Extra Stuff"" is  pretty cool, first you get a ""Sailor Moon: Scout Guide"" which  basicly introduces you to most of the Sailor Scouts. Then in the DVD there  is an option to see the edited start and the original Japanese ending. Also  in the DVD they have a better scout guide which tells you everything and  maybe more than you wanted to know about each scout. You also get to see  all of their Transformation Scenes, a Still Gallery, and the Story of  Princess Kaguya(it's a Japanese Fairy Tale and basicly the whole base of  the plot). As not only my first Anime DVD and first Sailor Moon movie I  have seen I can not help to give this DVD 5 Stars. It has great sound,  animation, plot, and extras.",965779200,,1034,4.262886597938144

The  music is okay but nothing like the Japanese Subtitled edition. Which by the  way is offered on this site at a decent price, much cheaper then you'll  find at a lot of video stores. It just does not match the Japanese version.  Although if your buying this for small kids that don't know how to read  subtitles then this would be a good thing for them to have.

I have to say  that it was disappointing to see certain scenes altered and removed, for  there was more editing in this movie than the R movie.  Comparing both  versions, I like DiC's music, but it got too repetitive for my tastes.  Since I found that Pioneer left in some of the original Japanese music,  they should have left in the music for the final battle when the senshi  used their special attack power.
Otherwise, the scripts were VERY close  to each other, so there wasn't much butchering.  After watching both films  carefully with observing, the sub wins (surprised?).  Of course, it only  wins because of the music.  But DiC's music adds some more suspense to the  dubbed version.

I mean the S season was SO close to the original version I was stupified (whatever that  word means). Then I looked at the S movie dub and started to think,  ""hey, it wasn't THAT bad"". I mean, look on the bright side  everybody. We were actually able to see the movie. I know the MINI MOON  thing wasn't so good, but what did you expect? They couldn't use Chibi Moon  (even though they DID keep Hotaru's Japanese name in the dub...) Anyway, I  sugest that you buy this movie, both the dub and sub and then watch the S  season dub and see what you're missing! I'm not kidding. After you feel all  down about the S movie dub, watch the S season dub and you'll feel a lot  better (they made Haruka/Amara's voice deep, almost monotone and you get  used to Neptune's voice.

I will admit that the graphics aren't quite as well done as  the R and SuperS movies, but they make up for it by having the original  full transformations of everyone, even Chibi Moon!  Some find that the R  movie was superior because it had more action than S, but this movie had a  much more well-developed storyline.

The dubbed version is so bad that I couldn't bring myself to watch more  than about 5 minutes. Seriously, if you thought that DIC made a balls-up of  Sailor Moon then you havn't seen Pioneers effort.

It contains an involving storyline and WONDERFUL  animation.  Of course, as most of you have probably heard by now, the Outer  Scouts voices were really understated. To me, they all sounded the same...  which is bad when one of them is in a scene, the others are too.  As far as  Chibi-Moon's dubbed translation of ""Mini-Moon""... that was a BIG  mistake.  As soon as I heard that, I pictured Mini-Me from Austin Powers...  and for those of you who think Luna's voice is wrong... get over it.

Also it was kinda weird hearing  sugar stars turned into sugar flakes (sounds like an interesting cereal,  eh?) and Luna's voice didn't fit with her human body very well. Other than  those few things, it was done very close to the original.  The plot wasn't  changed in this dub like it was in R.

I got the dubbed movie because ... I think it's  because I wanted to see it and give it a chance.  My feeling were pretty  much the same as most of the other people who reviewed this movie, I didn't  like the changed lines and I didn't like the outer senshi's voices!  I also  thought that Luna's voice didn't fit but it was her original dub voice.  If  they chose to change Luna's voice, I wouldn't be hurt or shocked, it might  just seem like she lost her accent after living in Japan so long. About  MiniMoon, I didn't mind it.  I also expected chibi to be changed and it  sounds pretty close.  I think one of the biggest problems that people have  with dubs are that they see the original first.  The original is almost  always going to be better and so when you watch a dub. In a dub, you  sometimes have to alter words so that what they're saying matches their  mouth.  Since a dub isn't as good, it can be a disappointment to see.  All  of my friends, who have not seen the original, loved both the R and S movie  dub!  I personally liked the subtitled better but, for a dub, it was okay  or no more than what I expected after seeing the R movie dub.",960422400,,1331,4.117647058823529
1235344,2,B00000JNCG,"I own all three of the sub vidios and R in english, and I must say that I am disapointed in the S dub. The entire opening sequence of the group shopping is cut to be replaced with the clips of all the difrent movies.  The entire love story with Luna is totaly unbarible now. The old nanny  voice Luna has in the dub makes her falling in love with a man in his  twenties incredibley creepy, and doesn't match the body she has at the end  of the movie at all. Some people are complaining about the outer senshi  (scouts) acting ditzy, I don't see it and I actualy like the voices, except  for Pluto, hers sounds a bit to high. The atacks are horible for all the  outers, the dub added the planet name and a verb. The worst how ever is  Pluto's in the orginal it is ""Dead Scream"" it is whispered ,  realy cool, all ready in english, and is my friends and my favorite atack,  but now she screams it and it has been changed to ""Pluto Deadly  Scream"". First off her mouth barley opens makeing the scream sound  wierd, and the atack words are spoken in a close up of her face and don't  match the mouth movment at all.  Sailor Moons crisis make up is also pretty  bad, they added a bunch of words so instead of ""Crisis Make Up!""  it is something like "" Sailor Moon Super Crisis Power"" , her  atack also had a verb added. Now I can deal with the changed atacks, the  uncomfartible love story, the miss matched voices and edited scenes, but  the one thing I absolutley can not bare is Minni Moon! That is the worst  choise of a renameing! I understand the changeing from Chibi-Moon in to  something englsih, but why couldn't they have said Small Moon instead. The  Austin Powers images Minni Moon conjures up detracts greatly from the  story, They have all ready called Chibi-Usa (Rinni) small lady earlier in  the english dub, not minni lady makeing Small moon make more sense.  The  one thing the dub has going for it is the villian. The voice is pretty  close to the voice actress in the orginal, and not many lines where badly  mutilated.  If you are a fan of Sailor Moon, and can read, I recomnd the  subtitled version of this movie.

I personally think the enlish version is kinda funny. Especially if  you have the DVD and follow along with the actual Japanese subtitles on  bottom.  The dialoge was fairly close. If you absolutly LOVE sailor  moon,(like me^_^) then I'd recomend it, but if you're only into it a  little, this might put you to sleep. -_-zzzzzz",960422400,,478,4.436781609195402
1235346,4,B00000JNCG,"First I'll start with the negative points of this movie, because I feel that it's best to have all the good things about it at the end, so then that's what you'll remember most about this review. Because I DO think this  is a good movie and I think any other Sailor Moon Omake will want for their  collection. (I really tried to be original with my opinions, since everyone  else mostly talked about the same things..Mini-Moon, Outers  voices..)
1. The Snow Dancers sounded more like yapping dogs!
2. Luna's  old british accent made it hard to believe her whole relationship and  feelings for Kakeru; and since that's the main plot of the movie, well...  3. Unlike other reviewers, I did not like Himeko's voice.  In the subtitle,  her voice was so quiet and sweet, but the dub made her sound like some  spunky..I don't know what.  Just look at her conservative dress; it doesn't  fit. 4. I wish they could use the same didy-songs for every situation! Use  same transformation/fighting music for every fighting scene, same old Moon  Kingdom music for every romantice scene; and so on.  It got kind of old.  5. And...their mispronounciations of the Japanese names!  Whenever Luna said  'Kakeru' it immediately made me think of 'Kangaroo!' Like 'Fioreee' in the  R Movie Dub.
Now on to the positive points of this movie: (Remember,  gotta save the best for last..! ) 1. It mostly stuck to all the original  dialogue.  Some stuff wasn't as funny, cute, or emotional as with the  original Japanese.  But it's a dub, what did you expect?  2. Princess Snow  Kaguya's voice actually sounded believable to me. 3.  Nothing was really  cut out either.  Except with the transformation sequences.  Because I DID  notice some cutting out of the R Movie..and this wasn't so obvious to me.  I like it when they're subtle about things... 4. I liked it how they left  ONE of the Japanese BGM's; 'Ai no Message' for the Space scene.
I'm  usually very biased where Sailor Moon is concerned.  When I watched the R  Movie Dub, I found all sorts of things wrong with it.  I began watching the  S Movie while being a little bit more open-minded..So I finish off the good  points with my favorite one:
5. At the beginning of the movie, there I  am..being all serious and trying not to start criticizing it right away..It  goes to the scene with Kakeru looking through the telescope at the  comet...then all of a sudden he says, ""Hello!  What's that? ""  It  made me laugh soo hard!  I mean, if you've seen this movie you'll know what  I'm talking about.  He said ""Hello! "" Like some guy would say it  if he saw a cute chick.  It was so funny!  That's when I started to relax  and just WATCH the movie.  #5 is what made me fall in love with this  movie.",960336000,22,2727,4.524793388429752

The ""S"" movie is my favorite, and I enjoyed  the english version very much.  I had read several online reviews about it,  and all of its put downs.  First of all, the naming of Chibi-Moon changing  to Mini-Moon is not that big of a deal.  It's really not!  It was quite  entertaining when she said it.  But, the only big thing I had a problem  with was the voices of the outer senshi (scouts).  Haruka's (Uranus) voice  was okay, but Michiru's (Neptune) was far too deep.  And Pluto's was a  little odd, because I was looking forward to the voice that was presented  in the North American TV show, when Pluto first appeared in the  ""R"" Series.  And the thing I found strange was, was that all  three voices sounded the same.  It appeared as if one person did all three  voices.  I suggest that for the dubbing of the Series and the Super S movie  that they try to get the original North American Pluto back and change the  voice of Neptune to sound more refined and sophisticated (and a bit higher)  as she appears in the Anime (I own the S, SuperS, and Sailor Stars Japanese  epsiodes).  But the movie itself is translated very closely, and I found  most of the dialogue similar to the original Japanese dialogue.  I couldn't  see anything that was edited (besides the original transformations, as they  always have been and Luna's transformation) but I'm sure there was.  I  liked Snow Kaguya's voice, and Himeko's.  Kakeru seemed a bit off, but  believable.  There was (at points) an overwhelming lack of sincerity in the  voices.  If you hear the Japanese version, they are very sincere and  emotional.  Some parts of it seemed a bit rushed on speech, like Tuxedo's  Speech on the sled, but it's very excellent and I am looking very forward  to the Super S movie and the release of the dubbed Super series that  Optimum is currently producing (it's listed on their web site).

Don't get me wrong if you are a fan buy it, it's still a fun change from  the monotony of the series. I just want to warn the non avid monnie fan to  watch the R movie before this one and not to expect it to be great.  The  storyline was also hard to follow ,and the voices of the outer sailors were  pethetic. Why mini moon? Sailor chibi moon/rini is called mini moon what  moron came up with that. It was still fun to see the outer scouts attacks  and tranformations.  And you get to see luna as a human,they should leave  her that way.  As a jupiter fan I was unhappy that she had very little talk  time.  The movie again focused on serena and darian's love.  Their in love  enough already.

1235368,5,B00000JNCG,"Here's a Sailor Moon story where the fight against the bad guys takes a back seat to another story.  The movie comes across as an extended episode, featuring Luna in a ""star-crossed"" (or rather,  ""species-crossed"") lovers situation.  You could pretty well  replace the villain of the story with anyone from any of the other series,  and still the Luna side-story would dominate.  This is a good thing as far  as I'm concerned (I like Luna), but even non-Luna fans will be drawn to  this movie.  To be honest, I was drawn into the movie so much that it  really seemed like it ran longer than the advertised 60 minutes.  Don't get  me wrong - I don't mean that the movie dragged or got bogged down to the  point where it seemed like it was taking forever.  Quite the contrary.  Instead, I felt like I had got much more than 60 minutes' worth of Sailor  Moon and Luna.  Again, that's a good thing. ;-)
As for the DVD itself,  it's got a couple more extras than the Sailor Moon R DVD, for those who are  into the extras.  There's no free watch offer this time around (anyone  receive their watch from the Sailor Moon R DVD offer yet?).  Of course, the  best thing about Sailor Moon on DVD is that you get the Japanese language  edition along with English subtitles, which allows you to skip the dubbed  version (bleh) altogether.  There is one extra that I really liked - they  included the original end titles, with the song and credits in Japanese and  with an animation of Luna/Artemis and Mamoru/Usagi against an ocean  backdrop.  Beautifully done, but I wish they'd been able to make that the  default ending instead of an extra feature.
To summarize, it's good  stuff, and even better if you're a Luna fan or a fan of the type of love  stories presented in the series.  Buy it, and for crying out loud, skip the  dub and watch the subtitled version!  ;-)",959644800,,1856,4.452095808383233

1235374,4,B00000JNCG,"I am one of the adult Sailor Moon fanatics and I was really excited to get my hands on this movie.  If you are an American who has seen what has been dubbed in English so far (Sailor Moon, Sailor Moon R series and movie,)  then a lot of what you see in Sailor Moon S may be new to you.  You get to  see Sailor Moon's newer attacks, ""Spiral Heart Attack"" and  ""Rainbow Heart Ache,"" including an upgrade in her transformation  to Super Sailor Moon.  There are a lot of heart symbols during Sailor  Moon's transformation and attacks, which I find a trifle hokey and girlish,  yet I am willing to overlook it because...well...it's Sailor Moon, after  all!  You finally get to meet the Outer Senshi, Sailors Uranus, Neptune and  Pluto.  You get to see Chibi-Usa (Rini) transform into Sailor Chibi Moon.  It is unfortunate that DIC chose to translate her name into ""Mini  Moon,"" but I will give DIC credit because I think they did a better  job at dubbing this movie than they did in the series.  I took this DVD and  set it up for English with English subtitles - then I could compare the  differences in the dubbing versus the Japanese translation.  This movie is  well worth buying if you are a Sailor Moon fan.",959558400,4,1208,4.4
1235375,3,B00000JNCG,"A lot of people I know really complain about the quality of Hearts in Ice, or the Sailormoon S Movie. Seriously, I think that it's great to see any company interested in producing Sailor Moon in America, because it expands  the fandon of one of the best series ever produced. If Pioneer hadn't  licensed the movies, then Americans couldn't get them (legally) subbed or  dubbed! And, since the movies have shown companies that there is a HUGE  fanbase in America, the S and SuperS seasons are currently being dubbed  (for better or worse). Hopefully, the seasons will be better dubbed that  Hearts in Ice.
To get nit picky, no one should be happy with Sailor Mini  Moon instead of Sailor Chibi Moon! The translator really should have taken  some poetic license here, and left it as Chibi or Small. Speaking of  translators, NOWHERE in the Japanese version do the attack names sound like  they do in the dub! They are already in english, so why add the planet  names, and change the wording? Uranus Wolrd Shaking? Pluto Deadly Scream?  And since the new Pluto VA didn't know, nor did the directors, she never  shouts! She's an ice queen herself, being the lonely, secluded Guardian of  Time she is! Bring back the VA who made cameos in the end of the R season.  Other VA problems include the disregard for the characters of Princess  Kayuga, a cold, heartless ice queen, Haruka (or is it Corrin), a cross  dressing, masculine woman, and Michiru (Michelle?) a very sweet, femanine  woman. Finally, even in the edited version, the music from the original  should have been kept intact, especially for the outer transformations,  previously untouched by the taint of DiC's music.
Of course, I couldn't  give this movie a 3 of 5 if there wasn't anything good, besides  distribution and fandom. There are some remarkable scenes in the dubbed  version that possibly improve on the Japanese version (I can't believe I  said that) such as Luna's love with Kakeru, and her turmoil. She has the  best voice actress in the movie, who did a spectacular job with her time in  the spotlight. The onetime characters of Kakeru and Himeko were very well  done too, and as usual, our friendly, neighborhood Sailor Scouts (Senshi!  Sailor Senshi!) toss insults with remarkable, and sometimes  uncharacteristic, wit. Frankly, if you just want to see the movie, don't  waste your money on this dub, buy the sub or DVD. But, if you want a full  collection, and are looking to laugh at America's inability to produce  anything resembling a dubbing masterpiece, this is a product for you!",959472000,2,2562,4.7917620137299775

1235378,5,B00000JNCG,"Come on, who's that girl who wrote the review that the DVD and VHS dubbed version of Sailor Moon S Movie? The series is always weird like this, but to make a comment of the voices and names. I think Pioneer may be on to  something for the dubbed edition of the new episodes of Sailor Moon for  summer vacation.
Let me start off on the good points that are the  opposite of that one hateful writer's review. Uranus doesn't sound that  feminine, Neptune doesn't sound that guyish, and Pluto is still decent as  always. And the attacks are pretty much better than the fandubs, in my  opinion, although they sound like the Japanese versions. And Sailor Mini  Moon sounding like something from Austin Powers? Reality check, chibi is  translated as small, mini, or little. And did that reviewer even get the  DVD version as well? Read below for more info. I even like the name of  Super Sailor Moon's attack: Rainbow Moon Heart Ache Reform. What's better  is that Sailor Moon's third season first arc, ""Moon Spiral Heart  Attack"" from Sailor Moon S is retained as normal.
All of that, and  the Japanese original music. Unlike the video, the DVD comes with music  from the original, despite the fact that the dubbed intro replaces the  Japanese music. This is what Kids WB! did with Pokemon. They added some US  tracks, but saved Japanese music in certain scenes. I hope Optimum's got  plans for this as well.
Overall, Sailor Moon S' dialogue is superb. I  don't know why that reviewer had to put it down. Order this DVD/VHS,  because if you are a major Pokemon addict, like I was, get one of these SMS  DVDs/VHS products.",959385600,2,1615,4.580419580419581

Several obscurities that occur in this movie: 1) ""mini-moon""?  2)Michiru with a masculine sounding female voice?... 3)Haruka with a more  feminine voice than Michiru.

Buying the dubbed version means you pay a lot of  money for a movie with several scenes missing, mediocre acting, and bad  translations. Buying the subtitled version, however, means you have the  original uncut movie with a great soundtrack, terrific voice actors, and  good dialogue. If you're buying this for a child who is too young to read  subtitles, don't worry - they'll probably be too engrossed to care (that's  been my experience with kids and Sailor Moon, at least). Heck, it's just  plain funnier, more suspenseful, and more touching in Japanese. If you  still feel compelled to purchase the dubbed version...well, more power to  you.

It's going to wreck one of the Sailor Moon S episodes if she doesn't talk  more darker. Sailor Neptune was fine. It's just that she had more of a  darker voice then Uranus. That what keeps bothering me. Pluto had a MAJOR  problem. First, she is suppose to be the mature one in the show. She's like  the oldest one, and here she sounds like a teenager. Also, her DEADLY  SCREAM was TOO LOUD!  Ain't it suppose to be a whisper?  I didn't really  care about the adding the names of their planets, but THEIR SONG!  WHAT IS  UP WITH THAT?  IT WAS PERFECT TO GO ALONG WITH THERE TRANSFORMATION!  I  DON'T KNOW WHY PIONEER CUT IT OUT!  Oh yea, Sailor Mini Moon?  I don't  think so.

I am not pleased on how they dubbed Pluto's attack. Instead of  whispering it she now yells it. The whole reason that attack was cool is  now gone. The dub voice for Luna did not fit this movie at all. Especially  when she was in her human form. It was a teenage body with a much older  sounding voice. The original VA's where there for the inner senshi, so that  was cool. I can understand Sailor Mini Moon. But don't change Sailor Moon's  attacks, that was pretty lame.

I will agree with previous reviews that the  Voice of Salior Uranus is too high and needs to be masculine.  However, the  culture in Japan is that when someone is translating the work into english,  the voice needs to be a higher pitch.  I think Pioneer did this by culture  standards, which needs to be changed.  I think I can live with Mini Moon.  I would have like for them to keep Chibi Moon.  This DVD does have the  orginial music which is a MAJOR plus in buying the DVD version.  All in  all, it's ok.  Change Uranus's voice before the dub!",959126400,,720,4.340909090909091

It's all wrong because Neptune's voice needs to be more feminem.  Uranus is like a tomboy, so her voice should be more...male. If you don't  believe me, watch SMS. It was supposed to come out BEFORE the movie. And  Pluto? Pluto appeared in the SMR series part 2, and she had a great voice!  Now she's too loud and kind of annoying. The outer attacks are bad, too.  They have the same attacks, only with their planet names at the beginning.  Like World Shaking? It's now Uranus World Shaking.

The only things that even partially redeem it are the fact they left Kakeru  and Himeko's names the same, some of the attacks closer to the originals,  and they pronounced 'uranus' correctly.

Now, the outers... you know, I absolutely adored the way  Pluto sounded in the dubbed R series, before the movies here. I thought it  was absolutely perfect. What happened? Pluto is rather soft-spoken. She's  certainly *not* in this one. Uranus... ugh. I'm sorry, I've nothing nice to  say about the voice of Uranus in this. It's all wrong, and it's not done  well. One of the World Shakings in the movie comes out garbled... I don't  know how it was kept. Neptune... there's hope, at least. She does sound  much older than she's supposed to be, and she could use some work, but  she's not that bad.

The entire series runs around a young teenage girl  called USAGI( serena in the english version), who fights for justice. In  this movie you will see characters that have never been shown in the series  aired in the united states. They are sailor uranus, neptune, and pluto.
  For those of you who know about sailor moon the movie takes place after  the 3 third series. The 3rd series has not been aired in the united stats  tho. The movie revolves around luna and her passon for a human that she has  fallen in love with.  This however is not all.  It also consits of battles  between the sailor soldiers and the evil ice princess and her dominons.
  You do not need to see the series to see the movie. It has no foul  language or unapprpriate material which makes it a plus for parents wishing  not to let there kids see any thing the don't want them to.

1235405,3,B00000JNCG,"One of the usual fan complaints about Sailor Moon's dubbed counterpart is how much of the dramatic tension winds up being filtered out of the story. Now I for one belief that children are quite capable of handling a few more  dark themes than they're given credit for and it's really the parents who  find a shot of Sailors Venus and Uranus getting slammed into an iceberg all  too disturbing, but that's my own frustration with the editing cuts in the  S movie. But what the dub lacks in drama, it typically makes up for in  humor. More than whatever her current final attack is (one that will  probably kill her if she uses it) our english Sailor Moon's most powerful  weapon is name-calling. She does it so well that I find myself missing the  trait in Usagi when I watch the sub. Unfortunately, the script writers are  under the impression that this quirk applies to every character. It worked  with Ann in the Doom Tree series, but it doesn't work with the Snow Queen.  She shouldn't have that much personality. On top of that, her voice is  immature sounding. Particularly when she turns to the camera to deliver her  exposition, the only way the dialogue would have worked is if she had  spoken the words...well...cold hearted. As it turns out, her english voice  actress tries too hard to perform in the role and sadly, it proves  counterproductive. This isn't to say that the dub does everything off the  mark. Himeko and Kakeru's voices work quite well, to the point where I  wished they could have been reoccurring characters. In fact, the entire  subplot involving Luna (with Jill Frappier in some of her finest moments)  truly is the strength of the video, and I'd suggest it's worth buying based  on that alone. Try not to laugh too much at Luna's Ed Wood inspired remark  about a human and a cat being soul mates because her next words are some of  the most heart felt in the series. I'm glad I bought Hearts in Ice, however  it's with no small amount of emotion that I submit I docked my rating a  whole star simply because of Pioneer's treatment of the outer senshi.  Everything was wrong. The voices weren't deep enough, Neptune needs to be  more feminine, Uranus needs to be less feminine, they're not supposed to  say the names of their planets in their attacks, and why on earth couldn't  Pioneer get the time honored Uranus-Neptune transformation music?  ""Mini Moon"" can be swallowed with a mere flinch. Sanctuary from  the snow dancer's Xena wail is a mute button away. But the most  unforgivable blasphemy is the Sailor Pluto does not, I repeat NOT scream  her attack. How could Pioneer not realize this cardinal rule of the  character? Last I heard, Dic was planning to dub Sailor Moon's third  season. In that case, I pray to God they don't use this portrayal as their  basis for the outer senshi.

Concentrating mainly on a new romantic interest for Luna, some of the  scenes get pretty funny, considering the fact that she's a cat, but you do  get to see a more -er- human side of her.  I recommend this movie to all  Sailor Moon fans.",956966400,2,605,4.146551724137931
1235411,5,B00000JNCG,"As a die hard Sailormoon fan, I have to say I am already biased towards the movie.  However, even my friends who have never seen the anime enjoyed it, and a few even cried at parts.  The romantic plot is sooooo incredibly  sweet that you feel like you're going to melt.  I think probably the best  facet of the movie is that it does NOT revolve around Usagi and Mamoru.  Okay, we get it...they're in love...now get over it!  My recommendation to  you:  Get the movie ASAP!  I'm looking forward to viewing the English dub  when it comes out, even if it means simply laughing at the stupid  adaptations.  However, for those of you who like those gory high-action  animes, you may want to think twice.  Although this movie has its fair  share of action, it is more of a girly anime than anything else.",956793600,,798,4.4

And as for the dubed R movie dear god that was pathtic!  It had very little to do with the original dialoge and followed very little of the same plot. I was very pleased however that Terri Hawkes(? ) came back and the rest of the cast with the exception of Darien and Artimis. There were some very cheesey lines in it such as ""Go get'em Moon Mama"" What the freak is that!  Any way since Im a SailorMoon fan threw and threw Im gonna get this dub edition of the SMS movie even though they haven't even dubed the SMS Series yet!  Which by the way I believe is starting June 5th I think sometime in june. But the dubed version is sure to be bad.  No offense people. Its just that they mix it up so freaking much! If you want to see Usagi and The rest of the gang watch the Japanese version with subtitles. Im attemping to get subtitled version of the SailorStars Season.  Ahh and now Im just blabering on and on...So I really like the SMR and SMSuperS movies (Subtitled) So I suggest those. But if your a Luna fan i suggest the SMS movie Subtitled or dubed. But I really suggest SUBTITLED!  Its the best its so funny. That reminds me The SMSuperS movie is the funniest and has the best graphics out of all of'em.

1235417,5,B00000JNCG,"First, I would like to say what are these two talking about? A viewer  March 30, 2000 taurus4 from United States  March 25, 2000
I don't like americanization one bit, what's the point besides shutting yourself in  your own culture and making the excuse because you saw something from  another country it makes you feel better. If you want the full experience  of stepping outside your culture go all the way. ""Do or do not, there  is no try"" -Yoda.
 Anyway since this is NOT a forum and a review  I will tell what IS in this movie, assuming that Pioneer does an excellent  job with this movie as they did with SMR.
 Clever undertitle..  subtitle..? What ever it is called. Hearts in Ice. That's got a good ring  to it. and excellent choice of art for the cover.
 The movie is about  a Princess named Ice Kayuga (not to be confused with the Starlight's  Princess Kakyuu) returns to Earth to get her revenge on the Moon Kingdom  that cast her out. (Queen Serenity did with the Silver Crystal)
Luna  happens to be sick on the day of the invasion. The attack sequences are  redone and the Outer Senshi (fan term) appear)
Luna falls in love with a  Scientist she wishes to be human at the same time the soldiers are fighting  Ice Kayuga.
_Super_ Sailor Moon gives Luna a night to be human and travel  with the scientist to the moon (which is her dream) She poses as Kayuga  (the legend of the Moon Princess, look it up on amazon) Even though she  knows her love is futal she gives that to him. He returns to his girlfriend  and she returns to Artemis who was worried about her. (It's on Hitoshi  Doi's site... the summary anyhoo)
 There is nothing like watching the  movie on the big screen. It made me cry several time.. at first with  delight at finally being able to see it and later because of the plot. It  is touching and pulls on your heart strings (I know it does for the guys  too though they won't admit is a readily).
 I like this movie a lot.  The plot isn't just Luna, it's the relationship between Luna and Usagi.  Even if you don't love Luna that much this movie will give you plenty of  other things to look at. Plus it will give you more respect to Luna.
  Oh.. and it should be noted that Sailor Moon R movie is the relationship  between Usagi and Mamoru and her Senshi (to a lesser degree). Sailor Moon  SS is about the relationship between Usagi and Chibiusa. (I'll review that  one when it gets out)
 Somehow I doubt Pioneer is going to change the  Outer's names, unless they work with Dic on that one and decide too. If  they are going to change them, I wouldn't object really, I'll note it. I  rather like Alex (Haruka), Michelle (Michiru), and Susan (Setsuna).. though  the ones on the Irwin boxes are clever because the definition of the names  are the same as they are for their Japanese names.. which is nice.
  Helen semes to fit for Hotaru (think about the mythology for Helen of Troy)  but she's not in this movie.
 I hope that helps you to think a bit  more about this movie. I do encourage you to buy it!",954633600,6,3031,4.325
1235418,5,B00000JNCG,"This is My favorite movie of all time. The outer scouts did the best job. I love at the end how te Scouts helped Sailor Moon and Used te Silver Crystal power ( of love and Friendship). I ave seen this movie about 100  times++ Luna is So pretty as a human, and how she falls in love with Kakeru  is so adorable. But in the end She and Kakeru found their equals and  probably never saw each other again. there's really a whole lot more to the  movie than that but you'll just have to find out for yourself. : )",954633600,,508,3.950980392156863

She became sick and was almost killed by a car, until a scientist saved her and  nursed her.  Luna then falls in love with him.  He found a crystal which  makes him sick, which was later used to freeze the earth for a snow queen's  collection.  It has the Outer Sailor Scouts except Saturn.

Most people say they don't like it because it focuses on Luna, but the whole movie doesn't  just involve Luna.  It has action with the Sailor Senshi fighting.  This  movie was great for me because I actually got to see the Outer Sailor's  transformation sequences and attacks.  In the Sailor Moon SuperS movie you  only see their attacks.  Unfortunatly, there is no apperance of Sailor  Saturn but three Outer Sailors are good enough.  The subtitles definatly  didn't bother me because I'm a HUGE Sailor Moon fan!

Just as a warning though, if you watch the english dubbed video of SMR  (Promise of a Rose) then the music at the end is changed from Moon Revenge  to Carry On.

As for the plot, it's fun,  but not the greatest. A comet is coming towards Earth, carrying an evil Ice  Princess who wants to take over Earth. Why? We never find out. But she's a  cool villan anyhow. A young astronomer sees her comet... but no one  believes him! Except Luna. The movie is basically about Luna's love for the  man, Kakeru, and her wish to be human. If you like Luna, this movie is for  you.

The jokes are corny, chibi-usa's transformation is horrible, the love story is sappy death.  Of  course it's always a plus to see Pluto and the other two living outers.  Regardless I bought the film since, yup, I am a true Sailor Moon fan.  It's  a great film for those parents who wish to give a Sailor Moon story to the  younger fans.  Unlike R it has no references to Homosexuality and much less  violence.  I've shown the film to 7 year olds with no complaints whatsoever  from thier parents.  The barbie doll nudity is only correct if you spray  paint the dolls pink, blue, green or otherwise and add lots of sparkles,  not a whole lot different from the american dic dubs.  If you really want  to see cool Sailor Moon stuff get the fan subbed S series.  The film is a  bit of money to pay if you're not a fan of the series, it might even drive  you away if you're anything like me.

Anyways, Luna has this very beautiful crush on an astronomer, and it  is so heart-wrenching to see her cry...Any Sailormoon fan would love this  movie. I know I did.",944179200,3,701,4.265151515151516
1235546,5,B00000JNCG,"I watched Sailor Moon S, the movie and I think it's a beautiful expression of how strong love and friendship can really be.  The plot is quite understandable, even to those that are young, and I really don't agree with  previous reviews that say that this movie isn't suitable for little kids...  that's rediculous... the so called ""nudity"" is very very obscure  and a small child wouldn't even think of it... I sincerely do not know why  some people make such a bid deal over nothing.  Eitherway, Luna's little  romantic escapade is sad at times, but it will warm your hearts... and of  course, who could forget Haruka, Michiru and Setsuna, the Outer Soldiers...  they're the best and they unintentionally steal the show at every  appearance.  This is one movie worth buying for all you Otakus out there.",943833600,18,805,4.760869565217392
1235547,5,B00000JNCG,"This is a great movie! You have to buy it! It's a wonderful story and the annimation is beautiful! If you're a SM fan this is the movie for you! If you love Luna, you gotta buy it! If you like to cry in movies or laugh in  movies, this is a really great movie for you! =^-^=",943747200,3,274,3.7241379310344827

Luna is so beautiful when she's in her human form!  Whoops, I  won't give it away!  I would recommend this to any female moonie over the  age of 9. Moonie fans out there, e-mail me so we can form a moonie club,  and we'll convince PIONEER to release all 3 movies and all 200 episodes in  UNCUT version! If PIONEER listens to a whole gang, probably it'll work!  I  look forward to the movies and episodes!  SAILORMOON LIVE ON!",943660800,3,582,4.247706422018348
1235569,5,B00000JNCG,This movie is cool. It has all the Senshi execpt Saturn. I thought Luna falling in love was so cool. I love the way she transformed. I recomened it to any sailor moon fan.,943142400,,171,4.0588235294117645
1235570,5,B00000JNCG,"This movie is the greatest off all three i've seen. I love the plot and the three love stories in the movie. Yes Three! Well four if you count Bunny and Darine, but lets to deep. I short this in my opion the best of  the three. I love it and you must get it!",942969600,,258,3.690909090909091
1235571,5,B00000JNCG,"This movie is soooo sweet. Luna as a human is really pretty too. But you feel so bad for Artimes,but everything turns out okay.(ahhh i don't wanna give any secrets away! )You do get to see the Outer Senshi which is  cool. All the scouts also do this Silver Crystal Power of Love and  Friendship and that scene is really cool. Chibi-Usa isn't really that  annoying in this movie, but give her a break,she can't help being annoying  all those other times :).But this movie is seriously very good and you  should buy it or... For love and justice a pretty soldier in a sailor suit  SAILOR SUN!  IN THE NAME OF THE SUN YOU SHALL BE PUNISHED! so thats my  warning....now go buy it!",942883200,2,676,4.352
1235572,5,B00000JNCG,"When I got the movie I wondered what it was about. Then I read the back of the box. Immediately I put the tape in the vcr and watched it. This movie is so good. I like the part where the outer scouts(URANUS,NEPTUNE,PLUTO)  appear. Its about time that they show them. I like their transformation  music. This movie is also sad. But in other words I can't wait till the  dubbed versions come out next year. Sailor Moon R in JAN/FEB;Sailor Moon S  in MAr/APR; and Sailor Moon SUper S in MAy. Well c-ya!",942796800,3,499,4.276595744680851
1235573,5,B00000JNCG,GREAT!  Anyone who enjoys SM should see this. It can be a little hard to follow because you have to read the English but I loved it!  It is extremely funny on some parts.  The Japaneese sure no how to create good  cartoons for all ages.  A definate must see!,942019200,,258,4.08
1235593,5,B00000JNCG,This movie was pretty darn good if I do say so myself!  This is before Chibiusa know what she is doing and she kind of just tags along with Usagi.  Again the male fascination with naked woman shows up.  The evil ice  princess has no shirt and the senshi get de-transformed at one point but  all in all it's a pretty good show!  I really like Luna as a human.  She  was so goofy looking!,941414400,,386,4.053333333333334
1235594,4,B00000JNCG,"I just watched it last night, and I was just like amazed by it. The enemy started to attack in the begging and I thought...Oh, it must be over soon. But I didn't now that it was only the first 20 mins of it. I liked it a  lot! I think it had a very good storyline, besides what other people say.  And I loved seeing the outers again. Unfortunately, I heard the scouts had  new powers in this movie...but that is just a rumor. But I still just LOVED  the movie. I recommend everyone to atleast see it.",940636800,,500,4.02020202020202
1235595,5,B00000JNCG,"This movie is great!!! i didn't like it at all when i saw it the first and i think the second time too! But after a while i loved it! it's really romantic and it also made me cry, each time i saw it! Luna is very dramatic  in this movie towards the man she falls in love with, but i still feel  sorry for poor Artemis! Still if you like more of the soap opera peice of  sm, this is for you!!!",940032000,,392,3.6987951807228914
1235596,5,B00000JNCG,"The Sailor Moon series carries an emotional charge  beyond anything else in animated format, and this movie is no exception.  Luna's unrequited love broke my heart, but Sailor Moon finds a way to heal everything.  I sat with  5 other adults in a dark room to watch this movie -- when the lights came  on we were all crying.  Sailor Moon harnesses the love and energy of an  entire planet to save us all once again.  Any romantic who doesn't see this  movie has missed a truly magic opportunity.",939600000,,494,4.46067415730337
1235597,4,B00000JNCG,"This movie was so good! It wasn't as good as the R movie and didn't have any emotional scenes like the R movie did, but you get to see the Outers and they are so sugoi!!!",939168000,,170,3.75
1235625,4,B00000JNCG,"Beautiful artwork and character designs, the Sailor Moon S movie is certainly nice to watch.  (The cute love story was nice, too.)  However, if you are looking for a really good Sailor Moon *story*, the S movie is  rather weak on plot.",938649600,,235,4.5476190476190474
1235626,4,B00000JNCG,"I am a huge Sailor Moon fan, and this video 'almost' disappointed me.  I liked being able to view Sailor Chibi Moon and the ""Outer Senshi"" but they hardly got chances to talk.  I wish I could see Chibi Moon use on  of her attacks, but that is absent also.  It was interesting seeing Luna as  a human, but besides that I really didn't really like it.  I haven't seen  SuperS yet, but I have R and I like that one more.",937526400,,417,4.012195121951219
1235627,5,B00000JNCG,"This second outing of the Sailor Moon movie series is by far the best of the three.  It emcompasses the main theme Sailor Moon's creator(Naoko Takeuchi) has tried to express throughout the series...that love and  friendship will conquer all!  This movie is adorably cute and romantic, and  is a perfect date movie.
On a side note...I am a guy and I love action  anime(Street Fighter, Evangelion, etc.) but Sailor Moon manages to touch my  heart and I highly recommend it to other guys...besides who wouldn't want  to watch beautiful girls run around in short skirts:)

1235638,5,B00000JNCG,"For the true Moonie, this is a must have.  But for someone just trying Sailor Moon, especially after just watching only a couple of episodes, this may be a video that is hard to understand. An evil named Snow Princess  Kaguya sets her hopes of freezing the Earth over.  With the help of one her  Ice Crystals, Kaguya can freeze the world over in a relatively short time.  However, an astronomer finds the Crystal.  The crystal then drains his life  energy.  Luna falls in love with the astrologer to such a point that she  wishes that she would become human.  When the senshi battle Snow Princess  Kaguya with the Silver Crystal Power of Love and Friendship, some left over  power grants Luna's wish.
