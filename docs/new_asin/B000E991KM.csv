8107535,5,B000E991KM,"The story of Flight 93 and it's Heroic, yet Tragic loss of life is well told in this documentary.  Content is well done with care and respect for those lost.",1419292800,,157,4.233333333333333
8107536,4,B000E991KM,"I bought this DVD while trying to get a library of 9/11-related material together. The story is very sad, of course, and what the passengers were able to do by fighting back and using the tools they had (like their cell phones) took a lot of courage and more grace than most of us will ever be able to show. But it is disturbing to hear some of their relatives talk about how heroic they were and how they reacted to the news about the other planes. It struck me as odd how the passengers were portrayed by the actors, and it rang a little hollow with me. A much better portrait of the passengers, crew and Air Traffic Controllers is from Paul Greengrass's ""United 93"".",1366588800,,669,4.317460317460317

May we never forget the people killed on that day!",1207094400,,110,4.7894736842105265

If you are someone who is concerned about receiving ""The Heroes of Flight 93"" when you ordered ""Portrait of Courage,"" do not worry, because there is very little difference between the two documentaries. Both documentaries were produced by Grizzly Adams. ""The Heroes of Flight 93"" was released in 2005, was hosted by Jerry Rose, and the narration was based on ""Beauty Beyond the Ashes"" by Cheryl McGuiness. ""Portrait of Courage"" was released in 2006, was hosted by Michael Flynn, and the narration was based upon the book ""Fighting Back"" by Deena Burnett. ""The Heroes of Flight 93"" poses the question, ""Where was God on September 11th?"" while ""Portrait of Courage"" makes no mention of God. ""The Heroes of Flight 93"" includes in the Special Features; Curriculum: The Ultimate Act of Love; which is not included in the Special Features of ""Portrait of Courage."" The Special Features in ""Portrait of Courage"" includes Spanish subtitles, which ""The Heroes of Flight 93"" does not. Other than these differences, the interviews and Special Features between the two documentaries are virtually identical! For this reason, I recommend that you purchase one or the other, but not both. I personally prefer ""The Heroes of Flight 93"" over ""Portrait of Courage,"" because I like the narration better in ""The Heroes of Flight 93,"" plus it is less expensive to purchase on this site.",1198108800,3,1521,5.532188841201717
8107539,5,B000E991KM,"This is the one that tells the actual account of what we can understand of an event that will always be remembered as one of unimaginable horror.  Ordinary people caught in the unthinkable, and acting the way we have always thought that Americans would act.  This is their story from the perspective of the families.  No hipe here.  No famous actors playing roles here.  Real people-mostly American, but some our friends from other countries.  This is the best of the ""911"" accounts that I have ever seen.  This is a must for people that really want to know what happened as much as can be known.  This is for people who appreciate this country and view each of these as heroes worthy of our highest honor and esteem.",1193011200,3,717,4.546875
8107540,1,B000E991KM,"Dont waist time, money, or effort.  The DVD is mostly related to the country questioning God and where was he when 9/11/01 happened.  I am a believer in God, but the DVD was realy cheesey and low budget.  Sorry",1150329600,14,210,4.333333333333333
8107541,1,B000E991KM,"I sent good money for a DVD entitled ""Portrait of Courage"" but was sent a DVD called ""Heroes of Flight 93"" instead.

This is NOT what I ordered.

Unless you can verify with a REAL person which title will actually be shipped (they're printed by the same company), my suggestion would definitely be: save your hard-earned money - DON'T get robbed!",1149379200,11,345,4.639344262295082
8107542,5,B000E991KM,"I had wanted to see flight 93 and finally had a chance to see it on  T.V. I hated to wait for commericals to see what was next. The young girl talking with her Mother on the cellphone was just so heart breaking. The trust we had and our safety as a country will never be there again.

People died trying to protect themselves and our country. The same thing is happening everyday in Iraq..God protect all our military overseas...",1140220800,33,429,4.35
