8394620,5,B003D10GS4,"A person has to be very intelligent to look that dumb, and I think James Roday is. Dul'e Hill looks intelligent and does not disappoint, but Shawn Spencer deliberately looks like he lacks a brain. They are a delight to watch. I'd buy every season if I had the resources.",1335312000,,270,4.42
8394621,5,B003D10GS4,"Actual detective shows are kind of hard to find now -- let alone a funny, well-written series with a hilarious twist. That's where ""Psych"" comes on, on the heels of ""Monk."" While the first season needs a bit of ironing, ""Psych - The Complete First Three Seasons"" does a good job blending comedy and mystery, and gives us some lovably fradulent guys to follow the adventures of.

Shawn Spencer (James Roday) was trained to be ultra-observant and intelligent by his strict, humorless father Henry (Corbin Bernsen), who wanted him to be a cop. And though he is determined never to be a cop (he doesn't even have a steady job), Shawn can glimpse clues and details that nobody else notices -- even the police. Even if he only sees them on TV.

But it backfires when he reports his observations to the police, and is arrested as a suspect. To save himself, Shawn pretends to be a psychic -- and the gimmick works so well that he decides to do it professionally. So he drags his very reluctant pal Gus (Dul Hill) out of a boring job, and they end up regularly hired by the police chief, despite the skepticism of Carl Lassiter (Timothy Omundson), who doesn't buy their act.

And so they set out into a variety of cases: death at a spelling bee, a haunting at a sorority house, a wedding tainted by theft and murder, a ghostly stalking, a dinosaur, a cat used as a witness, Civil war reenactments, a comic book convention (where they mess with George Takei's head), alien abductions, high school reunion murder, treasure hunts, underground poker, oil rig conspiracies, a dead sea lion, a verbally abusive Simon Cowell clone (Tim Curry), telenovelas, nanny-related killings, a murder committed by a 3000-year-old mummy, and even a run-in with a crazy megarich woman that Gus once drunkenly married during spring break.

Most shows aren't really able to strike a balance between comedy and mystery, but ""Psych"" does. The mysteries are light and fun, and the people making it actually seem to be enjoying themselves. While there is the occasional serious moment (""An Evening with Mr. Yang""), there's lots of comedy (""It's spontaneous psychic krav maga!""), usually involving some unusual plot twists (strangulation by mummy bandage? Refrigeration trucks?).

Each episode is a well-done little mystery, usually with some solid whodunnit material, dozens of pop culture references (from James Bond to wikipedia). Not to mention the hilarious dialogue (""My name is Ichabod Fletchman, Sticky-Icky to my boys"") and kookiness (Shawn's pseudo-mystical ""episodes"") that keeps it from ever being dull -- mostly supplied by Shawn, but everybody gets some fun time. Gotta love that.

There is a slight flaw, though -- in the first season, a disproportionate number of the guilty parties seem to be pretty young women. Fortunately this starts lessening as time goes on. The mysteries get progressively tighter, and the writing cleverer and funnier (""I'm never doing anything blindly with you again! I learned that at the Mexican border. Twice!"").

Roday is hilarious and brilliant -- charming, funny, likable, pleasant, and completely devoid of any dignity (""IIIIII hear a voice!""), with some great full-body acting. Shawn is one of those people who is half luck and half talent; no matter how outragous he gets, things somehow always work out. Hill is equally great as his intelligent, responsible, geeky sidekick who tries to keep them out of serious trouble.

On the official side of the cast fence, we have the crusty, hard-nosed Timothy Omundson and tentative love interest Maggie Lawson (""an enigma wrapped in a little blonde riddle"") to round off the cast. Corbin Bernsen also makes regular appearances as Shawn's dad, who considers his son a walking freakshow but privately indulges in spray-tans and radioactive shirts.

""Psych - The Complete First Three Seasons"" is a delightfully frothy mix of comedy and mystery, with solid scripting and likable characters. Definitely a show to keep on your watch list.",1327622400,,3991,5.0257186081694405

8394624,5,B003D10GS4,"Many people have not heard of or seen Psych, which is a shame. It's probably the best TV show you've never seen (if you haven't seen it). If you have, you know it's absolutely hilarious and exceptionally clever! I only buy DVDs that I know I will watch more than once, and I watch Psych over and over again.

I wish they included the ""Psych Outs"" seen at the end of each show and ""Spot the Pineapple,"" but the episodes themselves are worth the purchase.",1311638400,4,453,4.329411764705882
