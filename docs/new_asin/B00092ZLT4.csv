8056856,5,B00092ZLT4,Very informative set of DVDs by a very good teacher. Increased the repertoire of my fingerpicking styles many fold using these DVDs.,1395100800,,132,5.045454545454546
8056857,4,B00092ZLT4,"Unlike other instructional videos, Happy starts from the very beginning with the basics and slowly builds on that foundation. Easy to understand and follow.",1391817600,,156,5.541666666666667
8056858,5,B00092ZLT4,"This DVD series is a MUST for guitar players interested in learning anything from basic to advanced finger picking. Even if you already do some finger picking, Happy's teaching style will add to your knowledge, and if you are a 'newbie', you will learn quickly under his instruction. Just keep practicing!!!",1391644800,2,307,5.03921568627451
8056859,5,B00092ZLT4,"I taught myself to play pretty fluidly in around 8 months, with my goal being able to play anything/everything I heard on the radio. Now that I'm able to for the most part, I'm beginning to seek to invest in instruction videos like this to hone my abilities especially since I really enjoy Jim Croce tunes where fingerpicking ability is mandatory. This video is a very welcome component, and has shown me alot of methods more easily applicable, as well as unlearning some habits and achieving overall refinement. The lessons are very organized, and presented very progressively. From newbies to home gamers, and likely experienced players, you will learn how to play correctly with these DVDs. I would imagine to the equivalent of a couple years worth of expensive $30 a pop lessons. I am very glad to have this, as I know I can't go wrong with the very good instruction this provides along consistent practice. Will be looking for MANY more videos like this soon, guaranteeing expert level ability more quickly than figuring it all out for myself. Very recommended for people who really want to learn the right way. Peace & Keep Jammin~*",1315008000,6,1138,4.811224489795919
8056860,3,B00092ZLT4,"Bought this 3 DVD fingerpicking tutorial set before purchasing (from [...]) Eltjo Haselhoff's DVD ""How to Play Fingerstyle Guitar"", which I had seen advertised on YouTube. Mr. Haselhoff's DVD is much better, in so many ways, that I would wear off the letters of my keyboard describing them all. Let me just say that the video production is superb: scripting/lighting/camera angles/sound, etc. Mr. Haselhoff has a very pleasing personality, and he gives very clear, logical instruction. His goal is to get you to a point where you won't need to have ""tabs"" for each tune you hear that you'd want to play. No more tab crutches!

Check it out.",1311984000,,640,4.871559633027523
8056861,5,B00092ZLT4,"The first lesson was like pulling teeth trying to do the basic exercise and Skip to my Lou (which I know how to play), in fact the muscles in my left hand got sore at first which is a bit puzzling but I found it difficult to finger the 2 basic chords and fingerpick at the same time and I primarily played the chords with my I M R vice M R P fingers. My coordination was totally lacking. It really was like I was back in elementary school.
 I followed Happy's advice and am now playing Spike Driver Blues with authority and people don't even suspect I just recently learned to Finger Pick the song. Most of these songs I already know, I just played them with a flat pick. After Retraining my Brain things started to click. Believe me, it was embarrassing and humbling at first.
  I wish I had ordered one of his courses years ago, oh well. This has really added to my playing repertoire. Can't wait to get into the 2nd DVD but really the first one does the trick nicely.
 I think anyone could learn from this even if it seems difficult at first if they just hang in there and practice.
 Another thing, most courses and lessons are terribly boring but Happy makes this very enjoyable.
 If you want to learn to fingerpick, this is the ticket.",1273708800,12,1240,4.277777777777778
8056862,5,B00092ZLT4,These videos are a great way to learn alternate thumb style picking.  I would highly recommend them to anybody interested in this style of guitar playing.,1250726400,8,154,4.923076923076923
8056863,5,B00092ZLT4,"You can see other reviews on this DVD set in the DVDs that are sold individually, though this is obviously a good savings.

This is, perhaps, the finest fingerstyle lessons available on DVD.  Happy Traum is a gifted teacher, warm personality, and one who's love of music is contagious.  The camera work is impeccible; Happy moves slowly, challenging the student; and builds progressively.

I liken this to an entire College Course on Fingerstyle guitar.  The songs are great, and this 3 DVD set, depending upon your level of guitar playing, may wind up being, literally, MONTHS of ""private"" guitar lessons with a teacher who has played with the best of them; including Bob Dylan.

If you work your way through the 3DVD set and learn the songs....learn, not master, because you will be building your own style, you will be an accomplished player so much so that others will enjoy your playing.

I simply cannot say enough about this set, or about Happy Traum's teaching.  Everything he touches seems to turn to gold.  After working through this series, I have purchased everything I can by him, or even recommended by him.  He is that good.  Do an Amazon.com search on Happy Traum, as well as Artie Traum (his brother; an excellent teacher in hiw own right) and save thousands on lessons.",1194134400,22,1287,4.778280542986425
