7905182,5,B000007PBE,"This is an amazing collection independent film created by women. If you want to order this tape, you can go to Joanie4Jackie dot com (the tape is in the ""Costar"" section) or krecords dot com. This tape crosses genres and visual styles and I was compelled the entire way through. Since the Amazon review really doesn't mention the content of the film, I copied some info from the Joanie4Jackie site to give you an idea of what's on the tape. There are 7 films:
(from Joanie4Jackie.com...)
""The Slow Escape
Sativa Peterson
Sativa's haunting documentary-tribute to a woman who was murdered in her home town of Winslow, Arizona. ""...anyone connected with a murder, however slight that connection may be, was polluted by the knowledge and should seek retribution.""
Transeltown
Myra Paci
A morbid and tender love story that begins when a lonely girl drags home the naked body of a comatose, genital-less blonde woman. Dante transported to Times Square.

The Amateurist

Princess and Lois

A story of best friends. Fiona makes fun of all your ""issues"": bulemia, incest, lesbianism. The D.I.Y. riot grrl movie that killed riot grrl.
The Ordinary Life of Totally Psycho

The Delta and Electronic Ballet
Carolyn Cooley and Zoey Kroll
The Delta documents portions of a day trip. Loaded down with cameras, costumes, snacks, & an accordion, we were heading for the magical town of Locke. Imagine our surprise when the road in front of us was ripped to shreds!""",1069632000,2,2294,4.961038961038961
7905183,5,B000007PBE,"okay so, I want to say that this video is amazing. There is no description on here, so let me fill you in a bit. It is basically a collection of short films from mostly unknown women making films taken from a larger collection the comp/org puts out. It is a survey of some of the super cool women made films you can get ahold of. The great thing about this particular video is that it makes sure to include films with budgets, styles, topics, and general concepts that vary almost exponetially along the spectrum. Low budget, glossy, amatureish, art schooly, power issues, murder, abstract ideas, and bizarre dreamworlds to name a few. I recommend this to ANYONE, as a must have starter and something you want to be able to say that you own. IF you can't find it on here, you can find this and a number of other videos on thier site off of the miranda july official site. Look for it, look for more, I know I am and will be. Worth your time and will inspire you to get out your own camera and go crazy.",1016150400,,1002,4.2513089005235605
