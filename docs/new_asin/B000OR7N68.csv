8186402,4,B000OR7N68,"After seeing the series on TV, I purchased a copy for my personal library; however, this version is disappointing because the subtitles are distracting.  The syntax problem requires the viewer's concentration to unscramble words, which becomes tiring and lessens the enjoyment of the story.  Having two superb actors in the lead roles makes the inconvenience worthwhile.  Kim Rae-won never disappoints, and Jeong Ryeo-won created a character that was far beyond the usual quirky girl; however, in an attempt to make the character child-like and innocent, the costume and make-up people went a bit too far with the bizarre, semi-horizontal pig-tails which made her look  about 11 yrs. old.  To her credit,  she plays, also, the role of her sister at the beginning of the series, managing to make the two of them very distinct individuals.  The story is heart-warming, and I recommend the series.",1370995200,2,894,5.166666666666667
