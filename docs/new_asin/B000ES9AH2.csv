2533470,3,B000ES9AH2,"This Doo Wop concert was performed at The Sands Casino in Atlantic City and is more a night club performance than a theater performance.  The groups that performed live did a great job and would have been even better in the Benedum Center For the Performing Arts in Pittsburg.  There are a number of ""flashback"" films included here that did not seem to add that much to the presentation.

Overall, not one of Lubinsky's better efforts, due to the concert location and over-production in the editing room.

A better choice is Rock, Rhythm and Doo Wop. Also produced by Lubinsky.",1216252800,5,577,4.74
2533471,4,B000ES9AH2,We bought this as a father's day gift for my husband's father.  He enjoys doo wop music and has several CDs.  This was his favorite gift of the day and he immediately put it in and watched it in its entirely.  The quality of the DVD seemed good and the music was continuous.,1213574400,3,274,4.132075471698113
2533472,4,B000ES9AH2,"The DVD""Doo wop"" is a must have addition to any collection of Doo wop music; It is only one of a set of six that the lover of Doo wop music should have.

2533473,1,B000ES9AH2,"I love the music from this era, but this particular production suffers from poor audio. In particular, it was missing the center and base channels which resulted in a flat sound. Our recording directly from the TV during a pledge was very good.",1196985600,4,244,4.6976744186046515

2533476,5,B000ES9AH2,This DVD was great! Money well spent. I've seen enough of these PBS T.J. Labinsky shows on TV and not all the artists can sing like they used to but there are still a lot that can blow you away. I'm an old dawg from the old school and I got to tell you this dvd is good. The picture and sound quality are great and so are the performances. It's one of my favorites and I play it all the time.,1175731200,29,392,3.792682926829268

2533488,4,B000ES9AH2,I saw this on PBS awhile back and wanted my own copy. I took a trip to a DooWop conceert and the bus driver played this DVD while we drove.,1362873600,,139,3.6666666666666665
2533489,3,B000ES9AH2,I found that the acoustics were challenging and were not that great overall. It seemed that the program is sort of patched together.,1359590400,,132,4.782608695652174
2533490,2,B000ES9AH2,"I did not realize that it was a VHS Tape.  Big mistake  was paying for it. I don't own  VHS player any longer. Next time, I will be more observant.  I do know that this show has a complete set on DVD and now just part 1 on this tape.  What a disappointment but I still would like to have the complete set on DVD for PBS. The sending process went fine.",1358380800,,351,3.8194444444444446
2533491,3,B000ES9AH2,"Not that good,  It was made in Atlantic City and not in Pittsburn where the other doo wap dvds were made.  After viewing the others I am sorry I purchased this one.",1355788800,,164,4.09375
2533492,2,B000ES9AH2,"I ordered a number of dvd's that are great,this one title Doo Wop has terrible audio,i turned my volume up as far as possible and still could not hear the music and the singer good enough to enjoy them,i am very displeased with this product,love the artist just very bad audio,which is a dis-service to them and me,the customer.",1352505600,,328,4.576271186440678
2533493,5,B000ES9AH2,"Compared to Soul and Rock & Roll music that came later (the music of the mid 1960s to 1980) Doo Wop music (1950 to early 1960s) is pretty bland in my opinion. And yet this concert DVD of Doo Wop songs delivers impressively. On stage are The Cadillacs, The Skyliners, The Platters, The Duprees, The Cleftones, The Brooklyn Bridge and The Flamingos among several more for a total of 26 performances lasting one hour and seventeen minutes.

I had earlier purchased nine of TJ Lubinsky Production's concert DVDs and over looked this one. What a pleasant surprise. Many of the original artists are certainly not around today or may be retired. And so while a few are on stage the focus of the concert is on the music of the era and groups have several younger members.

The video quality of the DVD is excellent (appears to have been shot with HD cameras in 2006). The two channel audio can be distributed as a 5.1 audio and requires raising the volume higher than usual. But the bands backing the singers and the wardrobe are really what make this disk irresistible. This should be a top seller for Shout Factory.",1341100800,2,1109,4.567839195979899
2533494,5,B000ES9AH2,"The vocal groups of this era were supurb, the harmonies, great. The melodies and the words will be remembered forever by those grew up when Doo Wop was the music of our time.",1325116800,,174,4.303030303030303
2533495,5,B000ES9AH2,The show is well produced. You are taken back in time to some of the greatest singers of all time performing their hits. You will see the late great Johnny Maestro perform along with The Duprees and Skyliners just to mention a few of the groups on this outstanding DVD.,1319241600,,269,4.4
2533496,5,B000ES9AH2,"This is a rare opportunity to hear some of the 50's and 60's ""still great Doo Wop Era  - the days of my youth - groups. Jay of ""Jay and the Americans has a voice that continues to be as good if not better even after a cancer operation on his throat.all the others are still singing that great music brilliantly though they may show a bit more maturity.",1314489600,2,352,4.101449275362318
2533497,5,B000ES9AH2,"Speaking from one with the experience of having been disappointed by numerous ""oldies"" recordings, which are 2nd rate re-recordings (i.e., ""new stereo recordings""), I was far from disappointed by this concert of re-recorded classics.
As an oldies afficianado and a professional musician, I can assure anyone who reads this that every selection stands tall and shines bright beside the old original hit recordings.
Along with the lack of some vintage instruments and old low-watt amplifiers of the 1950's and 1960's, all that is missing are the pops, scratches and the surface hiss of the vinyl discs.
This entire concert falls into a category of its own: great.",1302307200,,661,5.186915887850467
2533498,5,B000ES9AH2,"I am happy to comment on the Doo Wop Video.
