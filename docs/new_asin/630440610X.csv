865661,5,630440610X,i saw this movie when I was a teenager.  I enjoyed watching it again and it was just as good when I watched it many years ago.  To bad movies aren't the same now days.,1272844800,,167,3.742857142857143
865662,5,630440610X,"From the opening credits, this movie will pull you in.  From the quaint little town where it is set, to the quirky characters, to the clothes, to the decor, this movie is a slice of small town life circa 1965.  I loved this movie when I caught it on tv years ago and was thrilled to find it on DVD.  I watched this with a smile and a wistful longing for the more innocent world that once existed.  The movie is a little ornery at times...it's just so much fun.  I watched it on my blu-ray player and was amazed at the crisp and vivid picture.",1268092800,2,542,4.0754716981132075

865664,4,630440610X,"""Never Too Late"" is a cute little film about a 50 year old woman (Maureen O'Sullivan) and her 60 year old husband (Paul Ford) who find out they are going to be parents a second time. Their first and only child is a 25 year old married daughter who, along with her 27-year old husband, lives with her parents in their large home. Her husband works for her father in his lumber supply business. This was produced by the team of Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin, and you can't help but feel they were warming up for ""All in the Family"" with this one, there are so many similarities. The middle-aged wife is named Edith, and prior to the pregnancy being discovered, she is running around the home at a manic pace doing housework. The son-in-law is constantly being kicked around and disrespected by his father-in-law, and the daughter is constantly bursting into tears. All that's missing is the social commentary of All in the Family.

There is a trailer on this one, and it's funny to see how even as early as the 60's advertising for films would try to mislead to draw in younger audiences. The trailer puts the emphasis on the young couple and only mentions the middle-aged pregnancy at the end, when in fact the emphasis of the film is on the older couple.

This film looks and sounds very good, and is presented in its original widescreen aspect ratio. The manufacturing defect is pixelation toward the middle of the film that is not too distracting - but it is definitely there. Careful inspection of the disc revealed ""the blue ring of annoying pixelation"" rather than the more serious ""purple ring of death"" found on the Hot Millions Warner Archive DVD-R, and Warner Brothers will exchange it if you call them, but the point is I shouldn't have to call them. Any company charging this much for a film with absolutely no frills should at least get the quality right - the first time. Looking at various chat logs on this subject, I see that several people have had the same problem I have with this particular product, so beware.  That's why I'm knocking my rating down from 5 to 4 stars.",1261872000,16,2086,4.542553191489362
865665,5,630440610X,I love this movie !!! Can no t get enough of it . My mom love's it too . Needs to be released on Blu-Ray,1255910400,4,104,3.2
865666,4,630440610X,"In his late fifties, Harry Lambert (Paul Ford) is the successful owner of a lumber-yard and a respectable citizen in his town.  He's a bit grumpy and crotchety, but is lovable nonetheless. His grown daughter Kate (Connie Stevens) and her husband, Charlie Clinton (Jim Hutton) are still struggling to make a go of their own and live with Harry and his wife, Edith (Maureen O'Sullivan).  Harry has just landed a huge contract to build a new football stadium and everything seems to be going well in his life.  Then Edith goes to the doctor and finds out that she's pregnant.  She's a bit shocked, but very happy and excited about the news.  Harry, on the other hand, is horrified at the idea of having a child again when he'll soon be sixty.  Harry soon becomes the talk of the town and with Edith under doctors orders to take things easy, Kate has to pick up the housework and decides that she wants to have a baby, too.

NEVER TOO LATE is an overlooked gem.  It's currently only available on VHS or illegal DVD, but deserves a regular DVD release, if nothing else just because of the gorgeous Connie Stevens.  The film is also notable because it was produced by Norman Lear who later used key points of the story in developing the tv series ALL IN THE FAMILY years later. Paul Ford and Maureen O'Sullivan starred in the play version on Broadway and reprise their roles in the film.  Having worked together so long with the same characters, the duo has a great on-screen relationship.  The screenplay was adapted by Sumner Arthur Long from his stage play and he did a good job of following the spirit and storyline of his original work, but giving it a few needed quirks for the big screen version.  The movie has a good balance of humor, drama, and romance.  And did I mention it has a young Connie Stevens talking about sex?

If you get a chance to see this hard-to-find charmer, I highly recommend it.",1229558400,3,1903,4.510204081632653

865889,2,630440610X,"Overly simplistic, even given that it was made many years ago. It's one redeeming quality is that it gave an accurate look at many men/women relationships in the 50's and 60's. I shudder when I think back to that era. Thankfully we have come a long way, though not yet far enough.",1384300800,,280,4.403846153846154
865890,1,630440610X,Another old movie I've seen a few times & really enjoyed.  This time I couldn't finish it.  The daughter was whiney/her husband an idiotic door mat/the father so ignorant & incredibly self-centered I wanted him assassinated in a way that he would suffer horribly. The mom let her family run all over her - treated as their maid.  She did come around & ended up quite delightful.  Everyone else is insufferable...,1377388800,2,412,4.76056338028169
865891,5,630440610X,Pretty funny movie. Paul Ford is so funny.  Sometimes funny in movies today is so rehearsed that it isn't funny anymore.,1377388800,,120,4.714285714285714
865892,5,630440610X,"Love this movie.  It's old and I loved it then and that's why I wanted it for my library.  Great story and excellent actors.  You'll love it, I do.",1371254400,,147,4.0
865893,4,630440610X,"I don't rate films for their content or story, since those ""opinions"" can be found all over the net and obviously and since If purchased it, it's because I like the film. My review or rating is for its video quality and/or technical deficiency when warranted.

In the case of ""Never Too Late"", it's part of Warner Bros. ""Archive Collection"". That means for the most part it's a DVD-R that has been ""burned to order"", as opposed to a mass produced DVD, which is pressed like a record. Although I've NEVER had a problem playing this type of disk, some older set top DVD players might have problems playing it.

For a film that hasn't been restored, ""Never Too Late"" has very good picture quality and color (It doesn't have that reddish look that looks deficient of blues and was a Technicolor IB dye film) and was made as an ""anamorphic widescreen"" disc.  If you're not familiar with this type of disc, suffice to say that it will produce a BETTER picture than just a plain ""letterboxed widescreen"" DVD.

Normally, because I use a video projector in my screening room, I no longer buy regular DVD's since the quality is poor when blown up on a large screen.  I've been replacing many DVD's with Blu-rays as they've become available. Since most Blu-rays look as good, if not better than the 16mm films I used to collect, I don't mind replacing these films with Blu-rays. However, with these Warner Archive films, it's unlikely that they will be available on Blu-ray in the near future, if ever.  It's really too bad, since a number of the films in the Warner Archive Collection were originally released as pressed DVD, but are now only available as these ""ON DEMAND BURNED DISCS"".  One particular film that comes to mind is ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"". I can only wonder what the incompetents at Warner's were thinking?  That film should have been restored if necessary, and released on Blu-ray. Maybe they plan to do that some day, but by that time, anyone who remembers the film will probably be dead.",1370736000,8,2001,4.648725212464589
865894,5,630440610X,"Haven't watched this DVD since receiving it, but I have seen this movie more than once and loved it. It's a great old movie and I was so happy when I found it on DVD.  I loved Paul Ford in The Music Man, but this, to me, is my favorite of his movies. Reminds me of Father of the Bride 2.",1365465600,,287,3.7049180327868854

The movie is a great example of how funny Paul Ford was. His facial expressions are priceless. I am also a big fan of Jim Hutton and always enjoy seeing him. The dvd I purchased does not have any of the problems talked about in the other reviews. Anyone who enjoyed the comedies of the 1960's will really enjoy this one.",1303516800,,499,4.1020408163265305

865938,4,630440610X,"Though somewhat dated, this film is worth having if only to salivate at the 60s era cars that populate the outdoor scenes.
