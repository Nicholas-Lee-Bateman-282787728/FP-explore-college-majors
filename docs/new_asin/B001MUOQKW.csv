8321880,5,B001MUOQKW,"I absolutely love this series. The plots are fantastic (colorful, interesting, and creative), and the protaganist, Inspector Montalbano, is very likeable.  The casting for the movies is perfect. I highly recommend this series.",1348099200,,226,5.848484848484849
8321881,5,B001MUOQKW,"If you loved the Sicilian detective novels by Andrea Camilleri, which are wonderful, you will truly enjoy the series of films made from them. I purchased a multi-region DVD player so I could watch them (they are PAL, region 4) and I have watched Vo.l I and Vol. II and I'm anxiously awaiting the arrival of Vols. III and IV. Subtitles are in yellow, so visible. I highly recommend the novels and the films.",1275350400,,406,4.5
8321882,5,B001MUOQKW,"Inspector Montalbano first caught my attention in the PBS Masterpiece theatre segment. . . .  We searched for the DVD and it here on Amazon with only the Region 4 format. . .  We were so invested, we went ahead and purchased a rather inexpensive Region 4 DVD player. . .  We were not disappointed in either!!!  At first I thought Andre Camilleri, the author, must have been a woman because of the depth of character development. . .  But, no, he is a man. . .  I love the character and his many/diverse relationships!  I hope to be able to see more in the future.  Well done!  Great detective entertainment that could only be done in Sicily with it's unique culture, corruption, humor and practicality!",1264291200,,702,4.507936507936508
8321883,5,B001MUOQKW,Camilleri's stories are rendered well in their intricasy's and irony. Montalbano is his inigmatic and cagey self with the right humor. Veramente Italiano and a treat to watch and hear and I for one never tire of the views of Sicily. How wonderful to have these great stories with English subtitles. Brava! Brava! After watching these I wish for somone to put one of the many great portrayals of Maigret on DVD with English Subtitles. Grazie e' Auguri.,1260230400,2,451,4.794871794871795
8321884,5,B001MUOQKW,"This is fantastic...with an inexpensive DVD player that will play this format, there is nothing that will compare to Montalbano stories.  RAI has masterfully completed the adaptation from book to television--the scenery is wonderful and the players are unforgettable.  This DVD set is finally available in the US--worth watching over and over.",1243814400,,343,5.576923076923077
8321885,4,B001MUOQKW,"I've seen these on one of the San Francisco Bay Area's PBS stations, KCSM.  I've read all the Montalbano books published in English and love them.  The TV series is perhaps overly true to the books, but at first glance, misses the absurdity in them.  On the other hand, the English translations must lose the flavor of Sicilian dialect, which is much of the attraction for the original Italian audience.  After watching two or three, I realized that I really liked the TV series, and that I had adjusted to the characters on the screen who, except for Catarella, were not much like my idea of how they looked and acted.  Catarella is perfect. You'll get used to a bald Montalbano, and once you do, these are going to be great fun, and you'll begin to notice the flavor seeping through the poor subtitles, and you'll be greatful to the Aussies for providing us with this faithful series. I haven't seen the DVDs, but these are almost certainly the same - adequate transfers, Aussie subtitles, and lots of seafood.  For Montalbano fans only.",1236124800,9,1039,4.6502732240437155
