8702190,5,B00TL6QW1U,"A superb achievement by all concerned, this eight disc set contains some of the best Shostakovich I have ever heard, either live or recorded. For me, the performances are just about perfect and surpass Gergiev's previous recordings of Shostakovich. The climaxes are thrilling as the orchestra plays all out when required, but what makes this so special is the incredible beauty of  the softer passages as solo instruments pass the music back and forth.  Special mention also goes to the percussionists, and their work in the concluding passages of the 4th and 15th Symphonies is transcendent, taking the listener into another world,  The set is not cheap, but if you love Shostakovich,  it is a bargain. Recommended highly and with enthusiasm to all fans of Shostakovich,  especially to those with a fine sound system that will  reproduce this music in all pf its glory.",1452038400,,870,5.006944444444445

No more flattering camera close-ups of the individual musician's face, we see their hands, fingers, lips, playing their instruments. The cameras placing me into the 16th row of the auditorium. The big surprise and bonus are the English language subitles of Yevtushenkov's beautiful verses as sung so passionate by Mikhail Petrenko. Outstanding editing of course. Finally an excellent video collection worth every penny. My thanks to ArtHousMusik!",1431820800,7,511,5.481012658227848
