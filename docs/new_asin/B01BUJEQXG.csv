7669459,5,B01BUJEQXG,"Sports milestones never get old. I just watched Steph Curry will the Golden State Warriors to a record 73 victories in the NBA. I saw Jordan drop 55 on the Knicks at Madison Square Garden. I was 12 when Nadia Comaneci scored the first perfect ""10"" in women's gymnastics at the 1976 Montreal Olympics. So with a sports fan's endless curiosity, I was able to watch how Sir Roger Bannister defied logic in 1954 by breaking the 4-minute mile, a mark thought to be humanly impossible. The footage of the race, interviews with teammates, and archival footage of post-WWII Britain frame the feat in a cultural and personal narrative that inspires 62 years later. ""Bannister: Everest on the Track"" is an important addition to athletic lore.",1460592000,6,732,4.817460317460317
7669460,5,B01BUJEQXG,"This film beautifully captures what is best in the human spirit and sport, as well as the meaning of achieving the four minute mile in post-war UK.",1467244800,3,147,4.481481481481482

7669466,5,B01BUJEQXG,"Two and a half years ago, I contributed to the kickstarter campaign set up to fund this film. The intent of its producers was to complete their project in time for the film to be a commemoration of the 60th anniversary of Roger Bannister's first sub 4 minute mile. Their 'pitch' video was persuasive and excellent and I gave them some of my hard earned scratch. Come May 6 2014 there was nothing. No realease, no excuse for the fact that there was no release. Nothing. Months passed. Still nothing. I concluded that I'd been cheated. Tricked by men who preyed upon my weakness for films documenting great achievement and for track and field. And then, a couple weeks ago, I learned, quite accidentally, that the film had been completed and was available on Amazon. I was a little miffed that I had contributed to the making of the film but still had to pay to see it. That is, until I watched it. All I can say is this: This post is the last grousing I will do about kickstarter or my tight budget or my relationship to the making of this film.
It might be a matter of fortune that I watched this film on this particular day and in this particular mood, but, at this particular moment, I am convinced that I have never seen a more inspirational work. Ever. Anyone facing barriers, real or imagined, will find themselves moved in a positive direction after viewing this and over a distance more than equal to the video's nominal cost.
Making a contribution to artists who care about quality is never a waste. I should have known this. In the future, I won't forget it.",1465516800,3,1567,4.463414634146342
7669467,5,B01BUJEQXG,Great video as it is not just a running documentary but does a fine job of setting the scene in England as to what was going on at the time.,1464307200,2,140,3.7
7669468,4,B01BUJEQXG,"Great documentary, as I'm french I missed the presence of subtitles, even in english. The content is interesting, although the book The Perfect Mile reaches a level of suspense that is just not present in this movie.",1463443200,,216,4.864864864864865
7669469,5,B01BUJEQXG,". . . but I was wrong.  Excellent telling of the Bannister story and its influence on British national pride.  Great interviews with Bannister, Chataway, John Landy, another guy that was in the race, some spectators and more.  I wasn't thrilled about spending $5 for a 1 hour movie but it was worth it.",1463356800,2,302,4.555555555555555

8751527,5,B01BUJEQXG,"I watched this film with the greatest pleasure. It is marvelous the way in which the film connects the war, the recovery afterwards and the conquest of Everest with the British spirit of the period. These are just the right thoughts. I loved how the camera shifted from side profile of Bannister to full front when he begins to talk, so excitedly, about Landyhe looks then like a delighted young man. I feel so privileged to have been able to see this film.",1469750400,2,457,4.518072289156627
