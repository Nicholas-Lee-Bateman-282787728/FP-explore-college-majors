2288798,5,B0009FVS8Y,"I live in Bristol, England and I own Little Britain series 1 and every episode is a classic. Its huge popularity is much deserved with the greatest characters created: Daffyd the 'only gay' in his village. Sebastion, the priministers aid who has a crush on him. Helper Lou and his 'disabled' friend Andy. Emily Howard the rubbish transvettite. Majorie Dawes, the fat fighters leader. Dennis Waterman the tiny actor who 'writes the thme tune and sings the theme tune' and other characters. My favourite is Vicky pollard the school girl 'yeah but no' she was based in Bristol where both Matt Lucas and David Walliams (creators) went to university and where i live. I cant wait for series 2 to come out on dvd in britain if you like league of gentlemen then get this, everyone around the world has to own series 1 of Little Britain. YESSSSSSSS - guarentee you their catchphrases will stay with you.",1109030400,2,895,4.707006369426751
2288799,5,B0009FVS8Y,"I am living in England for the year and have seen the series on TV and am excitedly waiting for them to release the seasons on Region 1 DVDs so I can share it with my family back home, and watch it over and over again.  This is a rare comedy that keeps you laughing, and, if  possible, gets more funny each time a watch an episode!",1107907200,4,331,3.925373134328358
2288800,5,B0009FVS8Y,"We were big fans of ""Little Britain"" when BBC/American ran this series a few months ago.  Alas, they are not showing it any longer and how I wish I'd taped it.  The characters are so eccentric and we find ourselves quoting lines from various skits all the time now. Hopefully the BBC will release the DVD series in the American format so that we can enjoy it over and over again!",1107734400,5,379,4.323943661971831
2288801,5,B0009FVS8Y,"I went home to my native Britain for Christmas, and was introduced to Little Britain by my sister.

It's yet another example of the wonderful comedic inventiveness, and uncompromising approach that British TV takes.  This show would never get made in the US.  Certainly not by major US networks.

That said, I know that if Comedy Central were to show it, and/or the BBC release DVDs of it in the US, it'd be a big success.  Americans are starved for new and refreshing humour.  I can certainly see the influence of The League of Gentlemen in their humour - such is the grotesqueness of some of the characters.  My favourite characters are probably the projectile-vomiting bigot ladies, Lou & Andy, and the world's most unconvincing transvestite - Emily Howard!

Any show that can get Ruth Madoc to say some of those lines (which I can't type here as it'd get my posting rejected), gets my vote any day!",1107302400,6,902,4.6645569620253164
2288802,4,B0009FVS8Y,"Little Britain is one of the best sketch comedy shows ever produced.  In this age of boring SNL and simply awful Mad TV, we Americans need access to a well-acted, superbly-written series.  If you happen to have a DVD drive that you don't mind switching to Region 2, then you should hop over to the Amazon UK site and order the UK DVD.  If you don't, then shout very loudly in the direction of England until the BBC offices take notice and release it on Region 1.",1107129600,2,462,4.287356321839081

You can't help but laugh at the hilarious scenarios involving various characters of different backgrounds... all played by the same two guys! Each character is hilariously put together in a brilliant way, and no two characters are alike. Matt Lucas and David Walliams are so incredibly funny and talented, you're sure to love, and sometimes hate, their many different personas. Unless you live in the UK or are familiar with their customs, phrases, etc, you might not fully understand some of the things they talk about/refer to, but the skits are funny, nonetheless!",1459296000,,720,4.768

I knew from episode 2 on that it was doomed, but sat through the entirety of the series just to be sure. Generally I love BBC comedies, The League of Gentlemen (which shares the same director as LB), Red Dwarf, Dark Place, but this was an outright dud.

Unfortunately, they don't have all seasons and episodes on Netflix, so I had to get this complete collection (even though it doesn't have Little Britain U.S.A.). I loved the bonus features in this collection, it brought hours and hours of tearful, laughter!
  The only thing that was odd about this collection is that, in my pack at least, the ""live"" and the ""abroad"" were switched, so the DVD that says ""Little Britain Abroad"" is really the ""Little Britain Live,"" and vise versa. Other than this little hiccup, it was so worth the money and my husband and I absolutely love watching the hours of fun this collection gives you!",1426636800,2,767,4.510791366906475

2288882,5,B0009FVS8Y,"I tend NOT to like ""tasteless"" humor, i.e., humor based on bodily functions, making fun of people, or what seems to me sexually gratuitous or designed to offend/shock.  For example, such aspects ruined for me offerings I liked otherwise, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/50-First-Dates/dp/B00190L018/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">50 First Dates</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Vicar-of-Dibley/dp/B000SINSX0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Vicar of Dibley</a>.  I was resigned to being a prude, humor-wise.

What I realized in watching Little Britain is that I don't mind, as long as it doesn't purport to be something else, or detract from something else (and as long as its not mean-spirited.)  I hate such aspects when they're added ONLY to shock or appeal to to 13 year-olds, when they're incongruous or basically incompatible with central themes (touching romantic comedies, for example).  Little Britain doesn't purport to be anything else, is SHAMELESSLY base and politically incorrect, in the poorest of taste, and mostly marvelous (though of course not everyone's cup of tea).

***SPOILER ALERT***  The show wouldn't be so funny if it wasn't so brilliant in its incisiveness, chock full of fresh observations on human nature.  I'm in social services and a former teacher and and I especially love the bits about the fellow who cares for his impaired friend in the wheelchair, and the psychologist who is endlessly proud of his patient who makes guttural sounds yet talks normally on his cell phone and pees on everything- uncannily accurate and mirroring real life situations and people, believe it or not.  Ditto with the classes at Kelsey Grammer School, showing an insane teacher, who demands the impossible from his hapless students (Why?  Because he CAN), not far of the mark either.

I think the show, though ostensibly offensive and insulting, is actually quite good-hearted, not mean-spirited (subtly evinces and fosters empathy towards the people it lampoons), in much the same way that Archie Bunker's bigotry and misogyny added new dimensions to discussions of women's lib and civil rights at the time.  Fat people, old people, transvestites, teens, gays, people of color, everybody, all people like all of us with idiotic biases and predilections for the absurd.

Full frontal nudity, crass references to sex acts (e.g., buggering, minge munching, glory holes, etc.), and no censoring of profanity, be forewarned (!)- but not gratuitous because it's the SUBJECT of the humor.  I can't think of anything else quite like this (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Community/dp/B002OPYUSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Community</a>, maybe, zaniness and inventiveness-wise, less the profanity and nudity).  There is no subject Matt Lucas and David Walliams won't enthusiastically tackle, both incredibly talented and versatile.  Lucas in particular is simply astonishing at inhabiting his characters, especially female ones.  His Al Sharpton-like character is a thing to behold, and the show lampoons people of all races and persuasions alike, equal time for all (ever notice how bad guys these days in commercials, such as identity thieves and burglars, and on many TV shows are all white?  RIDICULOUS).  Little Britain is refreshingly politically incorrect.  Walliams' breastfeeding man makes me squirm a bit, I must admit, but even so I mostly love the show- original, inventive, surprising.

P.S.  After watching this, I watched Little Britain USA.  Although I'm not sure why, the magic was gone.  Few funny moments, cringeworthy.  Too close to home AND the bone?  I don't know.  I wonder if Brits saw it and liked it?  I sure didn't.",1407196800,,3791,5.806509945750452

2288892,5,B0009FVS8Y,"I had no idea of what to expect when I ordered this set. I was expecting a Saturday Night Live or Mad TV type of dvd set. The series was totally different; definitely for a more mature audience, crude, vulgar, suggestive, ridiculous, silly, but extremely entertaining and funny. It was the type of series that I enjoyed watching alone but would have been somewhat uncomfortable watching in the prescence of someone else. Since the skits presented are so obviously ridiculous, I was able to laugh openly. There wasn't the slightest bit of seriousness or sincerity in the entire series. I particularly enjoyed watching them to see what type of humor the UK was enjoying. Many of the skits contained ""insider"" type humor with references to people and movie/TV productions that I wasn't familiar with, but this had a very minor impact on the overall production and did not distract in any fashion. I have always been offended by humor at the expense of others (individuals or groups) but the manner in which this series was presented set aside any reservations on my part at being offended by the silly skits. They were designed only with the thought of laughter and not to make any social statement or have any redeeming value. I am now on the hunt for similiar presentations from the UK with similiar humor so am open to any recommendations. I recently finished ""come fly with me"" and thought that was a wonderful series so am hoping to find something along these lines.",1402272000,2,1468,4.76078431372549

There are a number of recurring characters (the Fat Fighters lady, Daffyd (""the only gay in the village""), the Scottish innkeeper, Lou and his handicapped friend Andy) along with a few one-off segments.  The 2 actors are excellent in transforming into their characters and have a broad range of personae.

Anthony Head (from the Merlin TV series) makes appearances in season one of Little Britain as a politician. There are eight episodes to this show with various funny sketches involving such characters as an eccentric hotel owner, an author who enjoys sleeping while generating ideas for her book, an aggressive stage mother, and more.  Both my husband felt that the hypnotist character was pretty comedic. Meanwhile my husbands second favorite character was David Williams rendition of a Scottish hotel owner, while mine was David Williams rendition of a twenty something male who has a major crush on his friends grandmother.

They don't allow themselves to be dictated to by the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) or what have you. They cuss on TV without bleeps or regret; they take toilet humor to a whole other level on their tubes, going as far as to actually do the squatting act before a happily wide-eyed audience; they tackle tough and popular issues without apology and without stammering (Obesity, child endangerment, handicapped persons, hideously rude help desk people, etc.) It's all enough to make me want to leave America for Little Britain--almost. My cynical American side (see Little Britain Abroad) doesn't want to deal with any King or Queen.

It takes a lot to offend me, but I think that some of the material crosses a line.  There's more than one instance of blackface, and an entire sequence of scenes about a mother who pimps out her teenage daughter at a truck stop.

Unfortunately for the producers (and the viewers) they chose a very slim set of funny scenarios and then ran them into the ground until they were no longer appealing. When a viewer watches a brand new episode but can predict every character's lines and actions almost exactly, you are doing something wrong.

I wish these guys had been able to break out of their rut and do something truly innovative.

2289032,5,B0009FVS8Y,"I came across this series completely out of context, since I'm American and discovered it in a DVD box set long after the series had run its course on BBC TV and Matt Lucas and David Walliams had moved on to other things. I fell deeply in love with it right away. Then I started reading about it on the internet and discovered (a) most Americans have never heard of it, and (b) despite its massive popularity when it was first shown on the BBC a significant number of people in the UK are eager to tell the world how much they despise it and Lucas and Walliams.

I can see why some British progressives are ""Little Britain"" haters as much of the humor in this series, especially in the second and third seasons, is shocking and gross and relies on stereotypes that can be interpreted as sociopolitically reactionary--a teenage mom with criminal tendencies, people with fake disabilities scamming their caretakers, flamboyantly gay men annoying everybody around them. Lucas and Walliams were perhaps unwise in insisting on doing the old Peter Sellers ""aren't I funny, I can play anybody"" thing, even appearing as blackface minstrels in the first season. This tendency to push the outside of the envelope of what John Waters called ""good bad taste"" would get them in deeper trouble with their follow-up comedy series ""Come Fly With Me,"" which I do find pretty unbearable. Coming from the land of Rush Limbaugh and ""South Park,"" where great fortunes are built on sadism masquerading as comedy, I honestly don't think Lucas and Walliams' humor is intentionally cruel or demeaning. Let's just say they can be a little callow from time to time.

As far as the contents of this box set are concerned, I can't say enough good things about ""Little Britain"" the original three-season series and its companion, ""Little Britain Live,"" a recording of the stage show that Lucas and Walliams toured the UK and Australia with at the height of the show's popularity. They are first-rate comedy and great theater by two very intelligent, original and charming performer-writers. Given the sometimes very edgy material they're acting out onscreen, it's funny how polite and decorous Lucas and Walliams are on the DVD audio commentary (although Walliams, whose naked body is much on display throughout, helpfully points out to the viewer every instance in which his genitalia are visible through his costumes.) The additional materials in this set are mostly very welcome. The pilot episode is fascinating as it shows how the TV series evolved from its origins as a radio series (which is also available in its own well-produced box set that includes video recordings of Lucas and Walliams performing the radio shows--I highly recommend this to fans of the TV series.) There's also a generous portion of ""Little Britain"" sketches performed for TV specials and charity events and a sampler of sketches from ""Rock Profile,"" the Lucas-Walliams TV series that came just before ""Little Britain,"" which I found underwhelming as it's mostly impersonations of British pop stars I've never heard of. I hope the much superior early Lucas and Walliams series ""Mash and Peas"" and ""Sir Bernard's Stately Homes"" get their own box set someday.

As for ""Little Britain USA,"" I prefer to pretend it doesn't exist. I can understand Lucas and Walliams' urge to extend their enormously popular UK hit into the American market, but it was doomed precisely because ""Little Britain"" is such a specifically British confection that it just doesn't translate into the American idiom. But then when you have an iconic comedy series like this it can be hard to recreate in another context.",1320364800,,3641,4.955810147299509
2289033,5,B0009FVS8Y,"I've said it before, and I'll say it now; British television to American television is as caviar to cat tuna. Similar, but DIFFERENT.

The colorful characters created by genius comedy duo David Walliams and Matt Lucas are priceless...hilarious, irreverent, naughty and extremely politically incorrect from the 1st minute to the last episode. The skits last about 3 minutes each and characters rotate throughout each episode appearing a few times. Even the narrator says quirky things.

If you enjoy the irreverent humor of American shows like, ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,"" then you will enjoy Little Britain. So glad it is subtitled as some characters speak so fast (like Vicky Pollard).",1311811200,2,676,5.377358490566038

This British humor has never been equally produced to this level of entertainment in the states.  As much as I love many of our own great comedians there is no equal here.  The less-censored talent displayed here is unsurpassed anywhere I have seen. Some elevated humor comes from areas that the US has not yet ventured to discuss.

2289067,3,B0009FVS8Y,"When Little Britain first hit our screens in 2003 it certainly made an impact as an over the top, hilarious reflection of the British public. David Walliams and Matt Lucas were virtually unknown at the time of its debut, I only really recognised Lucas from his time on Shooting Stars. There's no denying that these men have a knack for comic timing and are great comic minds in their own individual ways. However, what they did was find their hook and keep hold of it for as long as humanly possible. The characters such as Vicky Pollard, Lou & Andy and Marjorie Dawes, were used on such a repetitive level that it's now made what I once held as an enjoyable sketch show into something I loath.

The premise of this sketch show is to jump into the everyday lives of British people and sketch after sketch sees characters in truly bizarre situations. The characters unique and bizarre traits are what really made this show enjoyable at the beginning of its tenure on our screens. Vicky Pollard is by far the most recognised character as upon its original debut it was widely discussed as to how this mimics the teenagers of today, much like Katherine Tate's teenage character, Lauren. Vicky's catchphrase of ""Yeah, but No"" really caught on and rather than mocking teenagers, it gave teenagers another way to annoy the public.

Lou & Andy are the more interesting pare of characters and are about the only sketch that I still enjoy to this day. Lou is a carer for the supposed wheelchair bound, Andy. Andy isn't actually as incapable as he first appears as the minute Lou's back is turned we see Andy jump out of the chair and get into all kinds of trouble. I don't want to over analyse things but it sort of says a lot about the members of the public who claim such things as disability benefit. Now there's no denying that some members of the British public do need to claim it, but this character makes fun of those who tend to rush into claiming such benefits when they clearly do not need it. Andy's catchphrase of ""I Don't Like It"" is also something that has been adopted by many and become quite annoying, but the real gem of it is when Lou quotes Andy in an attempt to persuade him not to do something he won't like. Lou will quote the most intelligent sentences which apparently came from Andy at one point, but we never get to see that and it's personally something I quite enjoy.

The Little Britain franchise started flogging a dead horse when they decided to produce a third series, which much the same characters and catchphrases as the previous two series. I was lucky enough to see their live stage show and it was much more inventive than what the television show has become. The American version is equally as tedious as the British show had become at its end. There have been a few specials such as Little Britain Abroad which were good for the fact the characters are in a different setting, but it become boring very quickly indeed.

Overall the show started off brilliantly but due to the over saturation of the main characters it became boring very quickly. Walliams and Lucas are two very talented comedy minds, but they let the hype get ahead of them and because of how the public caught onto some characters they decided to milk it rather than trying to remain consistently original in the sketches the two produced.",1242604800,7,3340,4.5616666666666665

2289089,1,B0009FVS8Y,"We love Ali G, The (British) Office, Monty Python, and most lowbrow humor of any sort.  Even if the laugh track hadn't drowned out most of what the characters were saying, it was just not funny.  About as clever as a 70's US sitcom.",1230336000,2,232,4.25
2289090,3,B0009FVS8Y,"When Little Britain was first released here in the UK, it debuted on a little watched BBC channel named BBC THREE. Within a few weeks word had spread about this hysterical sketch show that makes fun of every British stereotype under the sun. There was the Chav teenager, the not so wheelchair bound man, the transvestite in denial, the upper class elderly racist and the man claiming to be gay simply to stand out from the crowd. Those residents of the UK can all relate to at least one of Little Britains characters, even if it isn't some of the main characters, one of the lesser seen characters will certainly ring a bell and have a person saying ""That's like such and such down the street"".

That was Little Britain's main appeal, but apart from the familiarity of it all it simply had no substance other than a few repetitive gags tweaked and turned to try and keep it fresh. I have no doubt that after the first series, creators Walliams and Lucas should have quit while they were ahead as they ended up destroying some well loved characters. Vickie Pollard was without a doubt the character that caused the biggest stir in the UK as it held up a big poster and said ""These are the kids of today"". To some it was an offensive message, but there was no doubt there was a lot of truth behind it as most working class teenagers act in exactly the same way.

Other than the odd cheap giggle due to moderate racism or general controversy that, at times had you in stitches. It's been called by many as the greatest sketch show ever made but although I'm one for difference of opinion, calling it the greatest ever is simply not true. Monty Python's Flying Circus craps all over Little Britain and Python was made more than 30 years prior to Little Britain.

Buy the Monty Python collection instead, you will get much more for your money.",1220054400,7,1838,4.480597014925373
2289091,3,B0009FVS8Y,"There is much going for ""Little Britain,"" mostly in the persons of its two leads -- Matt Lucas and David Walliams -- who perform at least a dozen characters between them. The characters themselves are funny and original -- from rapid-talking bad schoolgirl Vicky Pollard, to unconvincing transvestite Emily Howard, to poodle-coddling, bonbon-eating trash novelist Dame Sally Markham. It's amazing how two actors can conjure up and play such divergent characters -- each having unique catch phrases, makeup and mannerisms.

But Little Britain has more than its fair share of misses. Des Kaye, the out of work TV kids show host now employed at a hardware store is creepy and wretched, but not funny. The narrator's introductions are so juvenile that I thought they might be parodies. And the characters find themselves in precisely the same situations over and over again. This is particularly true for  the characters Lou Todd and Andy Pipkin. Andy is wheelchair-bound and constantly vexes his longsuffering companion Lou with demands for items that (once he has gotten them) he instantly rejects. This was interesting the first time, and perhaps the second, but by the 6th of 7th repetition of the formula, I was wondering about the writers' seriousness. And sanity. Then, there is the vulgarity, which given the show's deficits, seems an attempt to make up with grossness what it lacks in cleverness. Be it plain vulgar words or crude topiary or offensive signage, the dirt goes on and on. This might be funny were its purpose noble or silly, but it's not an asset in this setting.

I would normally rate this show a 2, but I was taken by its flashes of originality. Too bad the writers and actors don't know where to take this buggy once it gets rolling.",1217289600,,1756,4.905723905723906

2289093,5,B0009FVS8Y,"Freaking hilarious, I still laugh when I think about it. You know something is good when you can still laugh about the lines or characters way after you finished watching it. Lot of the skits would offend a tiny minority of loud uptight Americans, only because those are the types that are always looking for something to complain about. Anyway the non-PC material doesn't really offend the characters they portray. In fact the characters become beloved by the viewers. I would say I am a cross between Bubbles Devere and Carol Beers. Ehh ehh ehh ehh.

This show is one of my favorite funny british shows along with others that I always highly recommend to my friends and tell them just give the show a chance to get to know the characters and what is going on if you can't get into it right away, but once you do, you won't regret it and will watch it over and over again.

2289125,5,B0009FVS8Y,"It's true the humor in Little Britain is not for everyone.  The skits range from ""rude"" bodily fluids spewing to some quite clever site gags.  Skits are hit and miss - some being hilarious and some just lame.  Everyone will have their favorite characters (mine being Lou and Andy, Daffyd, Vicky, and Bubbles).

For USians, the fact you can't understand half of what is being said makes it even funnier.  Of course, there are references and cameos we won't get either but it doesn't detract too much - get a friend from the UK to fill you in.  But cameos from celebrities like Elton John and George Michael are great.  Having visited the UK at least once will help give you a frame  of reference for a lot of the characters.

Little Britain definitely comes from the school of Benny Hill and Monty Python.  Anyone raised on those shows should feel right at home.  And refreshing to those of us in the US who loathe political correctness - this is stuff that would never pass US censors, even if it did, no major network would touch it with a 100' pole for fear of threats of boycotts (OK, maybe FOX would air it).  I can't imagine a US show having a character like Desiree DeVere and the backlash it would cause.

Being able to get Little Britain on DVD is one of the good things about globalization.  Hopefully the days of being able to choose what we want to see instead of having some corporate suit or politician choose it for us are not far off.

All of these DVDs are excellently produced and must-haves for fans of this program. The picture and sound are phenomenal, but best of all are the extensive extras.

Each DVD set includes episode commentaries from stars Matt Lucas and David Walliams, deleted scenes, interviews, talk show appearances, behind-the-scenes documentaries, and more. The included documentaries aren't the short featurettes found on many DVDs, but instead feature-length specials (often 60 min. long) that show what goes into creating the show for TV or stage. Particularly entertaining are the documentaries about the making of the live show (on the ""Little Britain Live"" DVD) and the live show's tour of Australia (on the ""Little Britain Abroad"" DVD). Walliams and Lucas are endlessly entertaining when not on stage, and there's a consistent stream of guest stars in the documentaries.

He would rather be the only gay person in the entire village than admit that he's not the only one. I love the fat fighters support group woman who is mean and critical of her group members at time.

The sketches and the characters are original (well, they're basically just blokes dressing up as girls and such, but in a new way:-) and they take it straight to the limit, as for example with the young chap who fancies older women (the finale of that particular series of sketches is at the same time some of the most hilarious and revolting I've ever seen). Who can keep a straight face when you see (and more importantly hear) Matt Lucas in the shape of Vicki Pollard ramble on about nothing and anything and nothing again? Or Andy making Lou's days a ""straight keffufle""? Even the narration of the series is enough to get me laughing out loud. Tom Baker does an absolutely fantastic job of narrating utter nonsense.

I've heard people mention the monotony of the sketches. Seen one you've seen 'em all. That is true. David Walliams in fact commented on that very thing in an interview once: you know exactly what's gonna happen. However, these are characters and indeed sketches, that dosen't wear easily. I've seen them all many times, and I still laugh every time. They are simply funny, no matter how many times you see them (well, within reason of course).

2289162,5,B0009FVS8Y,"""Little Britain"" (Season One) is, to me,an extremely funny show.  Until I purchased this DVD, I was not familiar with this series, I'm certainly, now, a very ardent fan.

The series of sketches are very well written and acted by Matt Lucas and David Walliams.  My god, they are so very funny playing all of the major roles.  As is typical with the British, the aforesaid includes the female roles too.  The ""drag"" roles seem to bring out the best in Matt Lucas and David Walliams.  I love the almost impossible to understand, fast talking, chain smoking, incorrigible--""yeah but no but yeah, shut-up""-- Vicky Pollard who finds herself, most of the time, on the wrong side of the law.  I also really like the pudgy, extremely rude (to other fatties) and very condescending Marjorie Dawes--leader of ""Fat Fighters"".(Her best advise to the ""fat challenged"" is that they can eat all the dust they want!)  Most of all, I adore Emily Howard the unsuccessful Transvestite.  He tries to convince everyone that comes within his sights that he is a ""real"" lady.  Yes, all of the named characters are played wonderfully by Matt Lucas and David Walliams.

Humorous introductions to each sketch are given in a resounding voice by Tom Baker which can be very funny indeed

Above, I've named just a few of my favorites.  There are many more.  If you are a prude, don't bother with this show; it's bound to offend you.  However, if you like really funny British humor that boarders on the obscene and that some might consider in bad taste (I don't), buy this show; to me it is really hysterical.",1164758400,4,1579,4.6909090909090905

Dr. Morris and star-mental patient, Anne - Morris always tries to use Anne to promote his novel approach to psychiatric rehabilitation, but Anne seems to always have the last ""eh-eh-eeh"" on the subject

Scottish Innkeeper - a parody of Scottish oddness, this hotelier lives in the land of fairies and wee sprites

Fatfighters spokespeson, Marjorie Dawes - hypocrisy abounds, as do racist and fat jokes

Jason and his friend, Todd - Todd likes older women, particularly Jason's decrepitly aged grandmother

Daffyd Thomas - the only gay in the village, and who wants to keep it that way. An excellent spoof of gay-rights activism gone to madness

Vicky Pollard - Working glass teen, and the last person you want to give ""evils"" to.

2289174,3,B0009FVS8Y,"It pains me to give this DVD anything less than 5 stars since the second and third series are possibly the funniest sketch comedy ever, but in this, the first season, David Williams and Matt Lucas hadn't quite worked things out.  When the sketches hit, they really hit, but there are still quite a few misfires and if you've only seen the third season on BBC America, you may be disappointed by this disk.

A number of the characters that are so funny in the later series are here (Vicki Pollard, the teenage delinquent who is the mother of six children by seven different fathers, Lou and Andy, Marjorie Dawes of Fight Fighters, Daffyd, the self-professed only gay in his Welsh mining village, Emily Howard, the really bad transsexual, the Prime Minister and his flaming aide, Sebastian, and my personal favorite, Anne, the not-so-mental mental patient who only says ""eh-eh-eh"" while doing hilariously inappropriate things in front of her oblivious, doting doctor.)  Unfortunately, there are also a number of characters who, for reasons that are obvious after the viewing the disk, did not make it past this first series, and some of the great characters from series 2 and 3 (such as former gymnast, Bubbles Devere) hadn't yet been introduced.

It's also worth mentioning that although the humor is definitely tongue-in-cheek, there is a great deal of fun-making at the expense of fat people and although, as one reviewer stated, it's a case of misdirected self-loathing, the barbs can be rather cruel at times and sensitive types might find the humor offensive.

If you like the later episodes of Little Britain you'll probably enjoy this season, but if you're new to the series and just want to check out what all the fuss is all about, start with series 2.  Because the answer to the question of whether this disk is the best British comedy out there is sadly, ""computer says 'no.'""",1148860800,3,1886,4.841614906832298

David Walliams and (especially) Matt Lucas aren't just inspired comedians, they're brilliant actors. Even when the skits don't come off, once you've made a connection with them, it's funny just watching them breathe. In some ways the humor reminds me of old radio shows, where characters have recurring taglines and zany verbal tics that get stuck in your head over time until you're practically quoting them in your sleep (it's no surprise to learn that ""Little Britain"" started as a radio show). There's also a lot of care taken with wigs, makeup, costumes and interiors, which adds to the social edge of the humor and shows the kind of attention Lucas and Walliams pay to the British types they're skewering (it's impressive to see the skits evolve as you watch the deleted scenes).

What their huge cast of surreal characters have in common is the ability to live completely inside their own fantasies about themselves. The humor is mostly in watching reality try to intrude on their delusions, and fail. Hard to believe it's only two guys creating this ridiculous, over the top, complete-unto-itself universe.

2289186,5,B0009FVS8Y,"People were calling the LEAGUE OF GENTLEMAN  ""Monty Python for the 90's"" - - and there's no doubt in my mind that LITTLE BRITAIN (which is narrated by former Dr. Who TOM BAKER) definitely deserves its place in the annals of great British TV. Not sure if its quite up to Python, Young Ones or The League, but despite its repetitiveness I think its way up there. Actually its amazing how many times you can watch the same routine over and over and still be sitting on the edge of your seat waiting for the punch which might involve a man in a realistic looking fat lady body suit complete with naughty bits disrobing, someone getting vomited on or a good old fashioned gay prime minister joke. Then again, this is what I admire about the Brits. They have almost no comic taboos, not God, not the Queen (not midgets, not Chinese people and certainly not braindamaged people in wheelchairs either)... The more sacred it is, the more likely they're to joke about it. There are very few countries in the world where people have the freedom to make jokes about their own monarch, God and whatever else without getting in big trouble, so I think it says a lot for the State of their democracy - - even if they *are* all poofs and going to burn.

All in all, for devoted fans of Britcoms and British Humor this is a must have purchase !  (P.S.  Just in case all brits look alike to you, most of the leads roles are played by the show's writers and creators -- and as expected with great British comedians since Python's pepperpots, they're really good at doing drag, their specialty being, so its seems - - fat people !)",1139961600,2,1611,4.414141414141414
2289187,3,B0009FVS8Y,"Lucas and Williams' irresistable characters in Little Britain are for the most part fine examples of British comedy:  farcical, over the top, perverse and likely to be incomprehensible to Americans (except for those who understand the humor of Monty Python).

I do, however feel that the first season, while having flashes of brilliance is in need of further development and I hope it does so as time goes on.

Most of the characters are fairly well-drawn, and are pretty close to what I imagine British folk to sometimes be:  pompous, arrogant, flightly, self-delusing, class-conscious, but on the same token fairly decent, ordinary men and women.

I think some of the sketches labored and were one-trick ponies:  Lou and Andy for one, you know Lou's going to stick his neck out for Andy and he'll change his mind at the last moment.  Been there, done it--will Lou ever figure out that Andy can walk?  That'd be something so see.

The schoolmaster who marries a former student--boring, overdone, not funny.  Sorry to the girl that has to be the bride in that sketch, but they don't give her enough to do.

Now, the other schoolmaster who doesn't have a clue:  fantastic!  I had several of these in public school!  More of him, I do want to see!

Vicki:  Oh God, but do I know several of those!  The cigarette puffing, screwball trailer trash girl is a howl!

Really, there's a lot of good stuff there, but I hope the characters develop more in the coming seasons, and we see a bit more range from two guys who definitely have it.

The bonuses are good:  the making is fun to watch and the live performance of some of the sketches is also quite funny.

2289188,5,B0009FVS8Y,"British sketch comedy doesn't get any better than this. Lots of great characters and great writing. Of the three series I think the first is the best, the second and third tended to go a little too much for the cheap laugh.",1138924800,4,223,4.333333333333333
2289189,5,B0009FVS8Y,"If you're not familiar with the catch-phrases ""You see, I'm a LAY-DEE"" (screeched by a rouged-up, sausage-curled tranny in a Victorian pinafore) or ""I'm the only gay in the village!"" (petulantly intoned by a tubby queen in red rubber hotpants), it's probably only because you don't live in England. These are two of the popular taglines from Little Britain, a brilliant sketch comedy show that's  a hit over there but almost unknown here. Debuting in 2003 and now in its third season, it's as good as any of the beloved British import comedies, but with a  hipper, in fact screamingly queer, edge than most.  BBC America hasn't picked this one up (yet), and given the raw touches - occasional full frontal nudity, a twenty-something slackerboy furtively sucking an old lady's big toe in close-up, blackface - it may never. But at least the first season of eight episodes is available on DVD. Included are a slew of extras including deleted scenes and interviews with creators and stars Matt Lucas and David Williams.

Lucas, who's queer in real life, and Williams, who's straight, play the girls (and various boys) of this parallel-universe England to comic perfection. Emily Howard (Williams), a determined but  unconvincing transvestite, terrorizes incredulous locals with her vain attempts to put herself over as a Victorian ""LAY-DEE."" Dafydd Thomas (Lucas), a delusional queen in PVC fetish drag, jealously guards his status as ""the only gay in the village"" even when competing queens arrive to challenge him. Other memorable characters include unintelligible slutty teen Vicky Pollard and FatFighters' noxious group leader Marjorie Dawson (both Lucas), along with grunting, destructive mental patient Anne and Sebastian, the Prime Minister's assistant who can't hide his lust for his unfazed boss (both Williams). Even these simple descriptions show how relentlessly un-PC this show is.

Little Britain's been sold as a kind of gallery of grotesques, but what's most alluring is how essentially realistic, with a few exceptions, these larger-than-life characters are. They could be variations on the forlorn average Brits created by Ray Davies' or Mike Leighs, with dashes of Kids in the Hall's concept comedy thrown in. A standout in this regard is the Lou and Andy relationship, with phony-disabled Lou wreaking quiet havoc on his patient, loving, clueless pal Andy in a series of comic variations on sadomasochistic codependency. Lucas and Williams' skill at incarnating these characters makes them repeatedly watchable despite claims of redundancy by some critics. It doesn't hurt that these actor-creators are as gifted vocally as theatrically, with Williams' high-pitched shrieks as Emily, and Lucas's hyperspeed teen-girl babble as Vicky and cheery-nasty bellowing as  weight-loss fascist Marjorie Dawes being high points.

Not every sketch hits the mark, and sensitive viewers may bristle at over-the-top characterizations of retardates, fat people, midgets, and  <em>minstrels</em>. But the ones that do work are among the best in contemporary comedy, with Lucas and Williams capturing these endearing eccentrics in a few sharp strokes.",1138838400,6,3150,5.425357873210634

2289191,5,B0009FVS8Y,"Granted there is no way to objectively measure ""funniness"" since it is by a large part subjective, but if there was, one episode of Little Britain would be about as funny as a whole season of SNL.

The spotlight review by Amazon user L. Hawkins is excellent so there is no need to repeat episode details here.

In a nutshell, LB is very funny, with diverse ""characters"". No topic is off-limit. The target audience is adults. As another reviewer mentioned it took me a few sketches to realize they were played by the same two actors.

If you are easily offended, or if you are of the ""prude"" variety, you will probably not like it.

A lot of the characters from Season 1 make it to Season 2, but some are dropped. I won't spoil it though :-)

Season 3 is currently showing in the UK. Season 2 was on BBC America a few months ago. Not sure when Season 3 will premiere in the USA.",1136851200,,877,4.259036144578313
2289192,5,B0009FVS8Y,"Little Britain is being compared to The Office and The League of Gentlemen. I have to disagree. After watching the first few episodes of The Office, I gave up - it seemed like the same joke over and over, although it was funny the first time. I haven't watched League of Gentlemen at all, since the preview of it on other BBC videos is not at all funny. Little Britain reminds me more of early French and Saunders.

It took me several episodes before I even realized that nearly all the characters were being played by the same two actors, Matt Lucas and David Walliams. Walliams, the tall dark one, is very good, but Lucas is just amazing. Due to a medical condition, he has no hair, so he is completely bald and has a very smooth face, rather like one of those kid's toys in which you use a magnet to decorate the cartoon bald man with metal shavings through clear plastic. With his collection of wigs and eyebrows Lucas becomes each of the characters he plays. But it's Lucas's acting that makes you forget that this thirty-ish man is playing a fourteen year old girl or a forty year old woman.

Although many of the characters are very funny the first and even second time around, they get old quickly. The Scottish innkeeper and the institutionalized Ann fall into this category. Even Vicky Pollard and Daffyd, two of the most popular characters, are likely to wear thin from overexposure. On the other hand, several of the characters seem to be deeper and edgier. Marjorie Dawes, the Fat Fighters instructor and Les, the former children's show host, are characters who seem cheerful at first, but it isn't long before someone gets on their bad side, and they turn rather frightening, in different ways. I'd like to see more of them.

The DVD set of the first season includes all the episodes, plus the pilot episode, which includes a lot of the same skits that turn up in the first season. There are also several entertaining interviews with the cast and crew of Little Britain, some clips of Lucas and Walliams in a pre-Little Britain program, and a slide show of most of the characters. Enough here to keep you entertained until the next season is released on DVD (soon, I hope!).",1136592000,,2188,4.576530612244898

However, after watching twenty minutes of the first DVD of Little Britain, I had to turn it off, for I had not once chuckled, and the skit that I thought would be funny (latex gay guy) was not in the least bit amusing. Canada's Kids in the Hall did drag...and they did it much better and did it funny. The two guys of this show deserve credit for trying to create something fun, but for this viewer, the experience was a disappointment.

Beware--it's a show unafraid to simply be silly for silly's sake, something I love, but others might find trying.  Often, Matt Lucas and David Walliams seem to like to joke about jokes themselves, and it's extremely funny if you can see that, potentially annoying if you don't understand the irony.

2289201,5,B0009FVS8Y,"Little Britain is one of those laugh out loud comedy shows.  Missed it first time round on TV and then caught an episode one night.  Been hooked ever since.  You'll find yourself wanting to drop the catchphrases into conversation after this dose of the the first season.

One of the best recent comedy shows to come out of Britain!",1128729600,6,331,4.559322033898305
2289202,5,B0009FVS8Y,"After two highly successful seasons and a DVD release in Britain, BBC is finally giving us Americans the home version of the `less refined' nature of the British population. Not all ""tea and crumpets"" this or ""jolly good"" that, this comedy sketch series brings us two actors who morph into a myriad of more than one hundred and twenty different characters -- all who would give the Queen heart palpitations and are guaranteed to bring laughter to your living room. Although still foreign to most Americans these characters and their infectious catch phrases are already imbedded in the British lexicon. The whole show relies heavily on these character catch phrases and scenes full of running jokes repeating and trumping themselves in different contexts -- much similar to how real British `characters' act in real life just personified and embellished here by the amazingly diverse Matt Lucas and David Willams. Just reading the lines, situations, descriptions, and catch phrases won't do much for you. It's Matt and David's ability to bring these characters to life that will leave you laughing and repeating the lines with your friends. Walk into a pub, or grammar school, or store in Britain and you'll certainly hear many of them repeated. Share this series with your friends and you'll have a whole new vocabulary to share. A selection of characters follows:

""I want that one.""
Not-so-wheelchair-bound Andy, and his long-suffering, volunteer caregiver Lou are the favorite characters of many. Although the formula for their running gag is always predictable, that's the point. Will Andy ever learn Lou knows what he wants better than he does himself? Will Lou ever stop enabling Andy' s strange whims? Will Lou ever discover Andy doesn't need the wheelchair Lou's been pushing all these years? Probably not, and that running gag is the recipe for their relationship and humor. The boys up the ante early on in the running gag department when Lou memorably takes Andy to the public pool.

""Yeahbutnobutyeahbutnobut, Shut up!""
Juvenile delinquent Vicky Pollard whose fast talking and nearly incomprehensible speech patter will have you grabbing for the remote to enable to subtitles option. Unlike Brits who watched this show on BBC, you'll actually be able to find out what she's rambling about. She'd swap her baby for a ""boy band"" CD and stabs out a cigarette in each episode. Part of the humor is the adults around her still trying to treat her babbling as normal communication and obviously missing some of the outrageous things that come out of her mouth -- things you'll just be able to catch. She's every parent's worst nightmare and is one character you definitely have to experience for yourself.

""I am the only gay in the village.""
Dafydd is convinced, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that he is the only gay in his small mining village of Llanddewi Brefi. The most funny part of these sketches aren't the sight gags of Dafydd's rotund body sausaged into the next rubber/mesh/pleather outfit (each one more outrageous than the last) and the village people's indifference to his appearance in them, though you'll definitely laugh out loud at their sight. It's the small mining townspeople's comfort level at saying the most colored, cheeky, and outrageous things to Dafydd while conversing with him. Although everyone in the village tries to identify other gays for Dafydd to socialize with, Dafydd's self-identity is based around being ""the only gay in the village"" and keeps him isolated from some really good fun.

""The Prime Minister is Gorgeous!""
Government Aide Sebastian who is hopelessly in love with his boss the Prime Minister of Great Britain (expertly played by Anthony Head) gets it's humor from the audience trying to decide if the PM is aware of Sebastian's obvious crush and trying to decipher his dead pan looks. Each time Sebastian goes further over the line, you're convinced a sacking is next on the agenda.

""Eh, eh, ehhh.""
Anne the perhaps-not-so-mental patient in the Stephen Speilburg Hospital is under the watchful care of Dr. Morris. While `innocently' destroying everything around him/her, can only utter the phrase eh, eh, ehhh  . . . unless talking on the cellphone with friends.

""Mayyyyybe yes, mayyyybe no.""
The looney Innkeeper of the Ye Olde Hotel in Scotland and his magic flute. He can never give you a straight answer to your questions but will punctuate his responses with a few puffs on his flute. The humor lies in the fact that everyone in Scotland acts like this, right?

""Dust is low in fat so you can eat as much dust as you like.""
Marjorie Dawes is the less than slender leader of the local chapter of Fat Fighters. In what can only be described as misdirected self-loathing she viciously belittles the members of her weight loss group who still keep coming back week after week. How this woman keeps her job is unknown. The acid interaction she has with the ever returning members of the group, especially Mira and Paul, provides the most humor.

Other reoccurring characters don't have catch phrases but still have their running gags nonetheless. Just a selection of these follow:
The schoolteacher at Kelsey Grammar school who confuses his students more than teaching them . . . Royal correspondent Peter Andr' who is in love with Princess Anne and also not right in the head . . . a quick peek behind the writing process will have you wondering how Dame Sally Markham ever became a famous novelist . . . Hypnotist Kenny Craig who is not afraid to use his talents to get whatever he wants. Just be careful not to look into his eyes . . .the former actor Sir Bernard Chumley who eats his invalid sister Kitty's Meals on Wheels. ""I didn't push her,"" he claims even when not asked . . . Edward Grant is the schoolteacher who married one of his former pupils Samantha and still treats her as such. . . Dennis Waterman the pint sized actor who insists on writing and performing his own awful sounding theme tunes. The humor here is in the running ""scale of objects"" gag . . . Denver Mills the Olympic medalist who should really forget his new career in speech giving and stick to running . . . Des Kaye the ex-children's television star who's not adjusting well to loosing his show and taking a job at the ""Do It Yourself"" shop.

Other characters include Emily Howard the unconvincing transvestite who ""is a lady and likes ladies things"" still utters one of the most memorable and more quotable (though sadly not printable here) lines in the show when he's told before an getting an x-ray he must cover his `meat and two vedge' with a lead shield. ""But I'm a lady,"" he protests, ""I don't have (insert feminized version of `two vegetables' here). Jason, the bloke who fancies his friend' Gary's grandmother in the worst way is soooo wrong, very wrong, but you're compelled to watch anyway. Most of these skits veer deeply into the PG-13 category so you'd want to pack the little ones off to bed before breaking it out or you'll have you toddler repeating the most embarrassing phrases.

While the intro to each weekly episode is the same visually, it's the different voiceovers narrated by Tom Baker, of Dr. Who fame, that will elicit quite a chuckle. Baker introduces each sketch in a funny voiceover as well and closes each episode after a funny version of the latest, failed world record attempt. Baker's voiceovers are the glue that tie the whole show together and are just as humorous as the skits themselves.

For those of you who like Bonus features, you will not be disappointed here. There is a commentary track for each episode on this disk by Matt and David; surprisingly deadpan, you may miss the humor if you're not listening carefully. Also included are the Pilot Episode, Deleted Scenes, a hysterical television interview with Matt and David, a ""Character Playlist"" that will allow you to view an edited version of some of your favorite character's sketches in their running order. One warning when selecting ""Lou & Andy."" You'll have to tell Lou ""Yes"" twice that you want to ""crash the disc"" but NOT three times or your disc will indeed crash (it's not permanent). Try it once if you like and then simply eject the disc and reinsert to go back to the main menu. In the ""Extras"" section on the second disc, you'll get to see what Matt and David were up to prior to this series when you view the ""Best of Rock Profiles"" -- hilarious non-impressions of famous (and some local British) musical artists. ""How to Make a Little Britain"" is the behind-the-scenes feature that chronicles the filming of all eight episodes over the time span of 40 days. The ""Teenage Cancer Trust Sketches"" are fun to watch and the ""Radio 5 Interview"" will give you more inside scoop. ""What Does Britain Mean to You?"" is a collection of man-on-the-street interviews with the characters humorously answering the question while poking fun at themselves in the process.",1128643200,104,8929,4.840209561231172
2289203,4,B0009FVS8Y,"Having a close friend who is from England, I have been somewhat drawn to English humor as it reminds me of my friends across the pond.  I caught an episode of Little Britain late night on BBC America and thought it had potential.  Since I didn't have BBC America at my apartment I decided to spend the money in hopes that the dvd was funny.  Me and a few friends got together and watched the season in one sitting.  We laughed like crazy for most of the night.  If you have never been to England or do not know anyone who is from England, you might not find Little Britain to be as hysterical as the rest of us, but you will still get a good laugh.  I especially enjoy the Prime Minister skits and Dafyd the only Gay in the village.  The sketches about Scotland are ignorable, but luckly the dvd special features allow you to pick which characters you like and only watch thier segments.  In conclusion, I found Little Britain overall to be a lot funnier than I had anticipated.  Some episodes are funnier than others, but you should get a good laugh.  Definitely worth purchasing if you are a fan of English humor.",1128470400,4,1115,4.342995169082125
2289204,5,B0009FVS8Y,"I was introduced to 'Little Britain' this summer when I was visiting London.  I laughed too much to be in any way critical of the shows.  How would Jonathan Swift or Monty Python react to 'Little Britain'?: I think they would love it, and the laughs might now be doing Swift's ghost some good.

2289205,5,B0009FVS8Y,"There is so much said about English humour, it is different for sure. No obvious catchphrases or canned laughter for the sake of it or cliches.

Little Britain is absurd, and it is meant to be as well. If anyone wants to get into the heads of us Brits, then good luck - maybe this is a start.

The only thing with American audiences watching this is that a lot will be lost with the sktches like Dennis Waterman but overall you would not be disappointed methinks.

2289208,5,B0009FVS8Y,"Living in Australia now, I have the chance to sample a wider spectrum of British comedy, and ""Little Britain"" is brilliant!  The formula is very much the same per each episode, but it's almost as though we're following the very colourful characters in the show through episodes in their lives, and even though you know what's coming, it's always great to see how they manage to incorporate the catch phrases or idiosyncracies of these wonderfully nutty people into new situations.  The characters are memorable and even quotable: ""I'm a LADY, you see..."" or ""If you ask me on a Monday, I'd say ah-Yeeeesss!""  This series is sketch comedy, and it's just plain funny.  It doesn't involve having to think about the humour, and it's occasionally gross without being too over-the-top.  I find it's a great DVD to pop in the player if I need a bit of a giggle; not too heavy, and not too stupid.  This series relies on a formula that works, and it's certainly worth having in one's DVD library.",1127001600,3,988,4.682080924855492

2 guys who started off doing some radio sketches and a bit of the same thing on something else decided to go ahead and make it a TV series. With a range of zaney to bizarre charactors there is sure to be something in this season for everyone. Wether it be cross dressers, falling in love with women 60 times yoru age, the mentaly challenged or just plain weird, you are sure to laugh at this series. (if you dont, then EUHH EUHHH EUHHHH)

This show is much like League Of Gentlemen, only it's in sketch's instead of a consistant thing. I like this one better, infact, I didn't like L.O.G at all really.

The show is a riot, the comedy is original, and the entertainment is lasting.

The DVD is packed with great bonus features. Including the pilot episode and a live stage performance they did for some event. (those performances appear as sketches in season 2) and also a look behind the scenes, and a few other things.

The downs: The commantary is boring & The deleted scenes are not so much deleted scenes as to ""original"" or ""alternate versions"" of sketches found in series 1.

The ups: Complete season (nothing cut) bonus show, bonus live show, and the best thing is you can actualy pick which character you want to watch and just watch there bit's from the entire season!",1124236800,7,1501,4.420289855072464

Too bad, because other U.K. shows to which 'Little Britain' owes a debt of inspiration - 'The Fast Show' (aka 'Brilliant!') and 'The League of Gentlemen' - successfully managed to mine fresh comedy from recurring characters.
