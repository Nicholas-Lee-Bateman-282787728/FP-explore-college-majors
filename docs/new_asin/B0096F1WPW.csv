8536636,4,B0096F1WPW,THis was one of the films that universal put out in 3d in the 1950's. It's a good western with van heflin playing the lead role. He quickly slid to supporting actor within a few years of this one. It was released in 3d and universal needs to do a 3d release of this on blu ray. This pal dvd looks ok though. But it's not restored at all like a proper 3d blu ray would be. Email universal at their site to ask for this one on blu!,1356220800,3,429,3.831460674157303
