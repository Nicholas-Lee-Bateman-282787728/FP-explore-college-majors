There were times where I had to go wth and watch closely as to whats going on. The movie is about a woman named Jessica who returns home. She has these frightening dreams about Horsehead and well you have to watch the movie to learn more. I'm leaving my review at that. This is a great horror movie.

7101002,3,B00VPUF9A0,"3 star film. Though the movie is well acted, it's story is the issue. The cast did a good job, and camera play was decent, but the plot and storyline were lacking. Figures in the movie who were supposed to be feared were not presented or designed correctly to be scary, just strange. I understand that much of this movie was filmed in an attempt to show the piece through the filter of a dream state, which can lead to a different vision and use of artistic license, but this film just didn't satiate me. I feel as though the description of a ""psycho-sexual thriller"" was likely one given to broaden the range of viewers interested in the movie, though it does not fit the film in my opinion. A few brief shots of a woman's breast and a spot of taboo do not make the movie ""psycho-sexual"". Overall, a movie who's director and actors did their best to make well, but also one in which certain elements detracted enough from to make the movie lesser quality than desired.",1462406400,,969,4.418994413407821

7101010,5,B00VPUF9A0,They would be something like this. To say this movie has no depth is to not understand it. I admit that afterwards I had to read up a bit on some viewer's interpretations of the film to fully understand it myself. That's why I love it! Horsehead is a movie that makes you think deeply about it's symbolic meaning but is vague enough to leave room for an interpretation of your own. This is purely psychological horror at its best. Any fans of Argento will immediately appreciate the cinematography and fans of symbolic horror like Silent Hill will love this. It's about a girl trying to unravel the mystery of her being by living out her nightmares. The rest is for you to discover.

The Horsehead monster itself is something to behold & was also interesting visually, the effects I felt were also well done. Music wasn't too bad but cant say I really loved it either.

7101016,5,B00VPUF9A0,"With this film, the French have regained their reputation for using cameras, film stock and Gallic wryness to produce true cinematic WTF.  I almost had the feeling the thick, often misleading symbolism (horse is the mother, wolf is the father -- follow the wolf) and bizarre emotional outbursts were there to persuade me to review and re-review this muddled masterpiece, upon which I would surely mine out a few details that would have brought the whole thing together for me.  But alas, this is not that kind of movie.  Lilly-Fleur Pointeaux seems to put out hints of Teri Garr, even non-comedy Lindsay Lohan, but at times it appears it's the movie, not the nightmare behind her eyes, that she is trying to escape.

Very arty film, if you like that sort of thing.  Blu-Ray is definitely the right medium for such an image-intensive production.  (There's a pretty grueling abortion scene near the end -- perfect for flipping on when you want neighborhood proselytizers to leave their mags and have a nice day.)  I also have issues (SPOILER ALERT) with the heroine's death or prolonged out-of-body experience near the end.  Did she have to die in order to defeat Horsehead, and take away his (or her) power?

7101020,4,B00VPUF9A0,"Many horror movies end up resembling nightmares, but few actually take on their form.  Horror movies have rules; a beginning, middle, and end.  Nightmares start and end without context.  They dredge up symbols from our unconscious that we cant comprehend.  No other movie Ive seen has emulated the helplessness, the paralyzing despair and confusion of a nightmare like Romain Bassets Horsehead.  Every aspect of the film departs from your expectations of the form of horror movies, and its a marvelous experiment.  Unfortunately, jettisoning the trappings of a traditional film leaves the movie unmoored; when you watch it, you feel like you are reaching out for meaning that you don't know is even there.  So much of the movie feels ineffable and inaccessible, much like your worst nightmares.  However, thats got to be the point, and in that regard the movie is incredibly effective.

The plot of Horsehead is less central to the essence of the movie than most other horror movies; ostensibly, its about the protagonist, Jessica, and how she battles her relationship with her mother through a series of nightmares.  After the death of her estranged grandmother, Jessica ventures to her mother and stepfathers home to pay her respects. Jessicas relationship with her mother is at best strained.  Jessica has apparently long been haunted by nightmares, and studies what the film calls the physiopsychology of dreams, the way our dreams and the waking world intersect.  We never really get an explanation for Jessicas character or the origin of these nightmares, and the basis of the tension between her and her mother is eventually explained, but without catharsis.  But the events of the plot are much less important than the films themes and symbolism.  Much like last years breakout The Babadook, Horsehead is fundamentally a movie about the relationship between mother and child, and the burdens a parents guilt places on an adult child.  The film deals with these themes in extremely violent, sexual ways.  There are some sadistic scenes involvingwell, lets call them improperly conducted abortions.  This is not a comfortable film to watch.  But thats what makes Horsehead so fascinating.

Horsehead kicks horror conventions to the curb, and this rejection of trope is apparent from the first scene.  Horror movie tradition dictates that filmmakers show the characters in a state of normalcy before they unleash terror on them.  You give the audience a baseline to understand the horror visited upon them; you hide the monster until the big reveal when all hell breaks loose.  The closest Horsehead comes to normalcy is Jessicas train ride to her parents place during the title sequence, but that comes after the head trip of an opener.  The film establishes the red color motif immediately, showing Jessica draped in red curtains.  The movie reveals the titular monster in full view, after a haunting series of quick cuts and piercing high tones as Jessica writhes in her sleep.  The intro is a perfect microcosm of the movie and sets the nightmare tone: just like a dream, you're dropped in without knowing how you got there, and all you see is horrific imagery spewed forth from your unconscious.

Basset, directing his first full-length feature, displays a remarkable command of filmic techniques.  Every aspect of the film contributes to its nightmarish quality.  Horsehead is an incredible experiment in the use of color: Jessicas nightmares are dominated by deep reds, which are sometimes contrasted with blue-filtered scenes to great effect.  The  lighting in this movie is impeccable.  Even in Jessicas waking scenes, when shes interacting with her parents in what amounts for normalcy in Horsehead, are alternately bathed in a soothing soft yellow or a dim, tense low lighting.  A particularly effective example of this is found early in the film, when Jessica, her stepfather and mother are sitting at the dinner table at Jessica and her mother tersely exchange words.  The camera crops the shot close, imparting a feeling of claustrophobia; the lighting is uncomfortably dim, just enough to mirror the tension between Jessica and her mother in their reflections in the window.  Basset uses color to create Jessicas nightmare world: the deep reds and cold blues starkly contrast with the diffused golden glow of her waking life.  This use of photography gives Horsehead an immediate and striking visual identity.  Director of photography Vincent Viellard-Baron should be commended for his composition and use of color on display here.

As effective as Horsehead is at emulating a nightmareI think its one of the most effective uses of psychological horror since Adrian Lynes Jacobs Ladderits definitely not a traditional movie.  Dont watch it if you're looking for a good time, and definitely don't watch it with anyone who isn't ready to get strapped into a 90-minute hallucination.  Also, while dropping the audience into the story essentially in medias res contributes wonderfully to the atmosphere of the film, it makes the film thematically opaqueit will take several views to piece together the sexual and familial imagery and symbolism used in the film.  If you're prepared to take on Horsehead, however, youll be greatly rewarded.  Im looking forward to what this crew can do next.",1436918400,2,5306,5.15906432748538
7101021,4,B00VPUF9A0,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Im going to have a hard time describing HORSEHEAD, however I can state with utter certainty that this is an amazing movie.  It is a surreal trip into the bizarre, but it is also a potent fantasy/horror hybrid that fans of both genres will want to check out.  And although its not perfect, its very close.  Chocked full of symbolism and deeply-rooted religious undertones, this film will take you on a crazy and terrifying journey.

I enjoyed this movie on several levels.  Visually, its a veritable feast of imagery that both assaults and entices the eyes.  Also, the symbolism in many aspects is very astute; there are emblematic examples everywhere.  And finally, the story itself is intriguing and riveting.  I was entranced with the film from the get-go, and it never lost its enchantment.

HORSEHEAD is shot well and, as mentioned, looks amazing onscreen.  The HD picture of the Blu-ray is astoundingly crisp, and the vivid imagery explodes from the screen like a bouquet of bright flowers.  This is a huge draw for the movie in itself, but when combined with the story, it makes for an almost perfect film experience.

The acting is very good, with Lilly-Fleur Pointeaux portraying the main character Jessica.  Pointeaux is surrounded by a great supporting cast, and the group plays off of one another well.

The story in HORSEHEAD is brilliant, however the execution is slightly off.  By this, I mean some of the aspects of the plot are meant to be insinuated, yet they aren't keyed on enough for clarification.  I had to make many assumptions to reach the conclusion I came to about the ending, which is both a win and a frustration; I almost think Id rather have a solid ending rather than that which is in the filmeven though the current ending does work.

I know those last few sentences sound confusing, but you need to see the movie to truly understand what Im talking about.  And see the movie you should!  HORSEHEAD is a powerful film, and I highly recommend giving it a look.  It is available now in a variety of formats, but try to check it out on Blu-ray; you won't be sorry with the picture quality.",1436918400,,2191,4.653645833333333
7101022,1,B00VPUF9A0,"I read the reviews prior to seeing this movie and decided to watch it anyways. What a mistake, there is only one segment of this movie that had, what some would consider ""gore.""",1436918400,5,177,4.393939393939394
7101023,1,B00VPUF9A0,Completely confusing and most of the shots were of dream sequences,1436745600,,66,5.090909090909091
7101024,4,B00VPUF9A0,"Please note that this review discusses details of the plot.

The original (French) title of the film is ""Fievre"", fever in English.
This is the first feature film of French director Romain Basset,
who is a young disciple of directors Jean Rollin, Dario Argento and Mario Bava.

For as long as she can remember, Jessica has been troubled by terrifying nightmares.
She is threatened by a patriarchal, horse-headed monstrosity, who is
wielding a key-shaped lance. Compelled to study the psychoanalysis of dreams,
Jessica experiments in a controlled dreaming technique.
She has long been estranged from Catelyn, her mother, and Rose, her grandmother.
When Rose commits suicide, Jessica has to return to her childhood home.
Catelyn is reticent about Rose's death, and the past of the family.
In Rose's bizarre sketchbooks, Jessica discovers images corresponding
to her own nightmares. She is suddenly taken ill with a high fever,
but she persists in her controlled dreaming endeavor.
In her dreaming, she encounters young Rose, who advises her to flee
the horse-headed ""Cardinal"", follow the ""Wolf"", and find the ""Key"".
Step by agonizing step, Jessica unlocks the terrible secrets of their past:
Jessica's grandfather was a sadistic and tyrannical clergyman.
When Catelyn conceived out of wedlock, the clergyman forced her
to give birth in secret, inside the local chapel. Jessica's twin sister
died at childbirth. The clergyman banished Catelyn and the infant from his house.

In the culmination of the film, delirious Jessica dreams that her tortured,
guilt-ridden mother stabs her, and she returns in kind.
She is now in possession of the ""Key"". Inside the chapel, she turns
the ""Key"" into a lance, and mortally wounds the ""Cardinal"".
She then witnesses a rebirth of her dead, twin sister.
They recognize each other, and embrace in a final, spiritual merging.

The film works effectively on a symbolic level: The male, virility principle
of the horse-headed ""Cardinal"", the primal, liberating energies of the ""Wolf"",
the hidden sexual intercourse of the ""Key"", the vagina-like doorway which hides
the birth, and so on.
Christian concepts and imagery are directly associated with sexual oppression,
fear and pain. Be warned that the film places in a very disturbing, violent
and nihilistic context the ""Immaculate Conception"", the ""Crucifixion"",
the ""Holy Communion"", etc.

Shot in a picturesque town of central France, the film's dream sequences are a stunning
visual experience. The sound track is appropriately hypnotic.
The blu-ray extras include an Inside Horsehead-Behind the Scenes featurette,
four short films by director Romain Basset:
Bloody Current Exchange, Light Drowning, Remy, Faces & Landscapes of Beaujolais,
and three film trailers: ""House with 100 Eyes"" (2013), ""Der Samurai"" (2014)
and ""De Behandeling"" (The Treatment) (2014).",1436572800,12,2843,5.423076923076923

-- This accomplishes things found in the blindspots of higher budget films like Antichrist, A Cure For Wellness, It Follows, and the VVITCH.

The only good things about the movie are: 1. Some magnificent visuals which are unfortunately completely ruined by terrible choppy editing.  2. The mother's performance which was incredible.  She plays a much younger, pregnant woman throughout most of the film (cuz, you know, dreams) which should have been ridiculous, but she was so good it really worked.  At another time she makes out with her young daughter (dreams) and she was chilling, sexy and creepy all at once in that scene. 3. The theme of mother/daughter hate is fascinating and almost never explored in film, unfortunately this film stinks. The worst parts are: 1. Ms. Lilly-Fleur's performance.  She ruined the movie, just vacuous, emotionless, awful.  Clearly hired for her looks. 2. The plot is stupid and boring and leaves us with questions probably because the answers are unintelligible or they didn't bother to come up with any.  What could have happened in the church that the priest (whatever he's called) would be so ashamed of?  What was with the very odd grandfather and his very odd religion? If the grandfather was so dominating and evil how did his daughter so easily get away from him, raise her child alone, and still inherit from him?  Who was the protagonist's real father?  Could she really have grandparents that old--  looked like the picture of them was taken in the Edwardian era?  We find out later that the protagonist is pregnant but... so what? That fact its promptly ignored.  3. The script. If there wasn't so much repetitive junk to the script the movie would have been 30-40 mins long at most and would have been better. 4.
