A man on a highway hitches a ride. When the car stops two shots are fired. A Deputy Sheriff finds the car and the bodies. This incident is repeated, but the car is driven away. Two men in a car head for Mexicali. They stop to pick up a man by a car. He is Emmet Myers, and orders them to turn off on a side road. They travel for hours, stop for gas and a map. Myers shoots at a tin can, so does one of his prisoners. Collins continues driving. The radio says Myers is still at large, the police are searching for him. They camp for the night, Myers threatens them again.

They continue to travel south and stop for groceries. Myers asks for Bowens watch. He calls them soft and suckers. Myers got what he wanted with a gun. They stop to fix the horn. A Mexican passes by with his donkey. The Mexican police know the movements of the three men. Another car passes by on the road, they are out of sight. They stop to change a tire. Another car passes by. The police question the driver at a roadblock. They stop at night at a closed gas station. Gilbert leaves a clue. They stop for the night. A coyote howls. Bowen and Collins flee in the dark, but are caught. They s top by a shaft. Vultures fly overhead.

A radio broadcast provides false information. An engine oil leak stops their car travel, and they walk. A helicopter flies overhead, so too a small airplane. Their abandoned car is found by a police car. They hide under a bridge when a military jeep passes. Emmet wants to change clothes with Collins as a disguise. They continue to walk overland and reach a town. Can they rent a boat? Yes. But Carlos sees the wanted poster for Myers! Collins walks to the dock, Bowen and Myers follow. Alto! Shots are fired. Bowen and Myers struggle, Myers drops his gun. There is a struggle with the Mexican police, Myers is captured.

This is a good story even if low budget because it seems to be based on a true story. The three stars were featured in TV shows in the 1950s. It serves as a warning against giving a ride to strangers.",1527552000,,2058,4.255754475703325

8601456,1,B00E5MIMEK,"I am puzzled by all the seemingly excellent reviews on the Blu-ray release of The Hitch-Hiker. What print are these reviewers looking at? I ordered the Kino Lorber's Library of Congress archival print of this title on Blu-ray and was dumbstruck by the horrible quality of the print. There were a ton of scratches, lines that ran vertical through many part of the picture, uneven contrast and flutter during nighttime scenes and weird ""bubble like"" print damage during the beginning kidnapping diving sequence. I do agree that Kino presented a much sharper image and most likely enhanced the contrast of the the black and whites, but that's about all. I am extremely disappointed and feel that I should warn others interested in purchasing this title.",1506556800,2,750,5.008

8601460,4,B00E5MIMEK,"Ida Lupino (1918 --  1995) was a renowned film actress who became interested in directing in the 1940s.  In 1952, Lupino became the first woman to direct a noir film with this 1953 release, ""The Hitch--Hiker"". Fifty years later, the movie remains the only woman-directed film noir. ""The Hitch-Hiker"" also is unusual in that it is set on lonely desert roads and small towns rather than in the urban areas of New York City or California favored for noir film. The movie has no femme fatale or other sexual interest. All the important characters are men.

The film is about two long-time friends and blue collar workers, Roy Collins (Edmond O'Brien) and Gil Bowen (Frank Lovejoy) who take a rare fishing trip vacation leaving wives and kids at home for a few days. On the road the pick up a hitch-hiker, Emmett Myers (William Talman) who immediately puts them under a gun.  Myers is a serial killer. The opening frames of the movie show him killing an earlier victim. The police have a manhunt across several states. Myers is psychopathic, sadistic, and utterly ruthless.  He lacks the use of an eye.  He forces Collins and Bowen to drive him to the coast of Mexico where he plans on catching a ferry and making a getaway.

The plot of the film is predictable, but the movie works in creating dramatic tension. The acting by the three major characters, particularly Talman as the killer, is taut. The story unfolds slowly as the killer forces the men to drive down deserted Mexican roads through small towns and an occasional small store or gas station. The killer forces the men to turn on the radio to learn news about the efforts of the police towards his capture.

Besides the acting, the photography and scenery make ""The Hitch-Hiker"" work. The movie creates a sense of claustrophobia as the car travels alone, with the pair at the point of a gun. The noir component includes the driving and stops at night at desolate places, the flat desert scenery interspersed with mountains, the stops along the way, and the psychology of the killer and his prospective victims. The two men differ about how to react to their desperate situation but ultimately work together. With all its chilling noir elements, the film celebrates the power of friendship. The movie is short at about 73 minutes which allows it to maintain and to develop its focus and intensity.

In 1998, ""The Hitch-Hiker"" was selected for inclusion in the National Film Registry, an honor awarded to ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" films. The movie is in the public domain and easily accessible. It was shown as part of a celebration of noir film held in October at the American Film Institute in Washington, D.C.  This is an excellent film for those with an interest in film noir.
