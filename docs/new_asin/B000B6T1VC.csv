Still, ten years later, I get email asking about the second half of the show. It is still not released on DVD. Personally, I loved the second half so I hope it happens one day!",1344902400,,297,3.966666666666667
8082647,4,B000B6T1VC,"I really enjoyed this first part of the documentary.  Asia is very down to earth and ready for anything.  I thought it was going to be dumb at first, but it was very insightful.  Not the typical big cities tour but it was more about what you could outside of town.  I want to find the 2nd volume, does anyone know where to find it?  Thanks!",1244419200,,340,4.090909090909091
8082648,5,B000B6T1VC,"This DVD treats you to a completely different type of Reality TV, in fact, the only Reality TV show I have ever watched.  Well, I guess if you consider Angry Planet a RTV, then this is the second.  Anastasia Nelson is absolutely charming as the host and fearless at performing the stunts the web audience puts her up to doing.

As well as being just plain fun, it is also educational as you get to witness parts of the world you might never get a chance to see.  It is also a coming of age for Anastasia as she literally goes through changes right before your eyes and shows you that she is a real person.

When is the rest of the series coming out?",1237939200,,649,4.16

Absolutely intriguing.",1139788800,5,159,4.3
8082650,5,B000B6T1VC,"This is the greatest documentary ever made.  It's right up there with other great documentaries like 'Bowling for Columbine', 'Supersize Me', and 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off'.  Ms. Nelson is stunning.  Just lovely.  And intelligent. Seriously, I'm SOOO into this movie - it's just amazing - i recommend it to anyone who wants to visit Russia or Australia some day.",1139184000,3,362,5.084745762711864
8082651,3,B000B6T1VC,"I can't say it is the best documentary. It opens my eyes. It is one of those travel channel show alike. I like cultural documentary. So I like this series. If someone knows where to get the rest of the volumes, please put your comment here.",1126742400,4,240,4.239130434782608
