1342886,5,B00004REYW,"In the late 1970s PBS presented a hilarious trilogy of plays called ""The Norman Conquests."" I've been trying ever since to find them again. And here they are! The production (the same as on PBS) stars Tom Conti as an unforgettable Norman. The premise of these three amazing plays: Norman is a real charmer who seduces (not necessarily sexually) everybody he meets. Each of the three programs takes place in a different room (in one case, the ""room"" is the garden). It's the same story and the same six characters (all beautifully performed), but each time seen from what happens only in each room. It's an amazing accomplishment for the writer, who explains in the introduction to the screenplays (also available on amazon.com) that the plays are meant to be seen in any order. These videotapes are presented in this order: ""Table Manners"" (in the dining room), ""Round and Round the Garden,"" and ""Living Together"" (the sitting room). But I prefer ""Table"" first and ""Garden"" last. If you haven't experienced it, and you're a fan of British productions, you really won't want to miss it.",978307200,29,1085,4.870270270270271
1342887,5,B00004REYW,"After seeing this marvelous trilogy on PBS over 20 years ago, I purchased the videos when they were first released.  Like an idiot, I sold them on an auction site for 3 times what I paid for them, but soon realized I couldn't live without seeing Norman running about the garden in his boxer shorts or hearing Tom's daft ""Uhmmmmmmm"".  I am purchasing them once again and this time I'll never give them up!  If comedy (English or otherwise) is your cup of tea, do yourself a favor and order these tapes.",970099200,,501,4.423913043478261
1342888,5,B00004REYW,"I have been searching for over two years, but I gave up a while ago. Then one Sunday evening,I went to Amazon, typed in ""The Norman  Conquests"" for the hundreth time, and I fell out of my chair and let  out a yell when I saw the three tapes for sale--I received my delivery in  two days and a smile hasn't left my face. The show is  brilliant--clever,witty and charming. I also enjoy watching others see it  for the first time, especially people who had to listen to  me over the  years go on and on about""Norman"" WATCH AND ENJOY!",965779200,8,530,4.24
1342889,5,B00004REYW,I saw this presentation on PBS's Great Performances over twenty two years ago. I have longed for an encore performanc and now I have it. Tom Conti is absolutely brilliant as the devil may care character. The scene at the  dinner table is one of the funniest I have ever seen.,963273600,5,275,4.392156862745098
1342890,4,B00004REYW,"For years I have sought out this trilogy hoping to see it again after first viewing it on PBS. Finally, amazon.com provided me with the full set! What a delight.
My memory didn't serve me well...it was even more  interesting than I recalled. The characters are rich in  development...making mundane moments in life quite memorable to the  viewer.
So tightly knit, the story weaves through lives (and rooms) with  humor and exposes each character's frailties in a cunning fashion, yet  offers an understanding of their power to cope with life.
Quite  delightful...I enjoyed it thoroughly.",956448000,11,587,5.126315789473685
1342891,5,B00004REYW,"Mr. du-Cille in another review expressed my feelings exactly.  I have been searching for these tapes for the years I have been on the internet (there is a very BAD version with other American actors).
Now I see it is on  DVD. Three hurrays and a tiger!
This is a wonderful set of plays,  wonderfully performed.",956102400,5,310,4.5
1342892,4,B00004REYW,"I last saw these plays at least 20 years ago (it seems) on British TV and it was one of the most memorable viewing experiences of my life. It has stayed with me ever since. A tour de force of writing,acting and a very  original treatment of a story. Alan Ayckbourn (the playwright) is a national  treasure. Try it. I guarantee you will not be disappointed.",954979200,6,356,4.378787878787879

1342906,5,B00004REYW,"After seeing this play on stage, we just had to buy the  film production DVDs. The English cast underplay their roles superbly; the viewer has to pay attention. There is no signaling  and no waiting for a laugh. Tom Conti in the title role is subtly but totally seductive. They are all won by him.",1433289600,,297,4.381818181818182

1342909,5,B00004REYW,It was a VHS tape I loaned but did not get back.  I was so happy to see that Amazon had it as a DVD.  It is a hilarious production done from three viewpoints.,1428537600,,158,3.6176470588235294

1342912,4,B00004REYW,"Very entertaining in a 70's sort of way. When I first saw these on PBS in the 70's I absolutely loved them!
I guess I have different sensibilities now, and didn't find them quite as wonderful as I did then....but still enjoyed them.",1424476800,,232,4.4186046511627906

1342934,5,B00004REYW,"Ordered this because I own the videos but wanted the DVDs. I was in one of these plays and loved it!
I do love Tom Conti! I enjoy all of the characters. It is SO funny! The man who played the Norman part with me looked just like

1342936,5,B00004REYW,"I saw this when it first came out and loved it. So glad I could find it on DVD. The first part is amusing, then you go to the second part and it fills in some blanks from the first part and it's really funny. Then you go to the third part that fills in the blanks from parts 1 & 2 and it's hilarious!",1417564800,,300,3.6307692307692307
1342937,5,B00004REYW,"Hilarious.  Ayckbourne's dialogue is, per usual, witty and wild, and the acting is consummate.  When my wife and I need a good tonic of laughter, this is our tonic.",1411257600,,164,4.620689655172414
1342938,4,B00004REYW,"I was grateful to finally see this again.  I had seen it on PBS years ago when it first came out and was captivated by the whimsy in
this three part mini series.  It was my first introduction to actors who later became favorites as creators of so many hilarious characters in later years.  Pariticulary Richard Briers, as Tom in Good Neighbors, as the Lord of the Manor in Monarch of the Glen and then, displaying h.is versatility, as a odious villain in an Inspector Morse episode.  And especially, Penelope Keith, who as Audrey in To the Manor Born, then in Good Neighbors, Executive Stress, etc is the most versatile and talented of the ladies of British Comedy.  I first met both of these in The Norman Conquests.  When I finally received it, it did not fully live up to my expectations.  I fear my recollection of it was through rose colored glasses.  But only because subsequent works have surpassed it.  Still, quite amusing and a wonderful view of some great comedic actors earlier in their careers ,",1406505600,2,1008,4.617977528089888
1342939,3,B00004REYW,"Purchased this show for strictly nostalgic and sentimental reasons. After many years from it's premiere, doesn't quite hold up. Still funny but not as funny as I once fondly remembered.",1405555200,3,185,5.2

1342941,5,B00004REYW,"Had an old VHS that I copied from PBS broadcast decades ago.  This DVD set is pristine.  The paly excellent, the characters superb.

1342942,4,B00004REYW,"This was a clever and amusing trilogy, but it worked better as a theatre play. It seemed to be better in a more confined backgrond.",1395878400,,131,4.28
1342943,4,B00004REYW,"I saw this on PBS when it first shown and loved it. However, being older and wiser, I wish it had ended with second act. Everything is perfect in the first two acts but the 3rd act is too long and padded. Still worth seeing for the great acting.",1391299200,,245,4.020408163265306
1342974,5,B00004REYW,"This comedy of three related couples coming together at their mother's country home is hilarious.  Each of the six characters has a different distinct personality, and scenes show them interacting in pairs in all combinations.  Norman and Ruth are frank and Tom and Annie are shy.  Reg avoids controversy and Sarah is so uptight she can't relax.  Norman brings them all past their
comfort levels to show them where they can go.",1389312000,,427,4.888888888888889
1342975,5,B00004REYW,"Three discs. Six actors acting out the same event three different ways. You've seen them all over the past 35 years in other things including Downton Abbey, for heaven's sake.
They are outstanding.
While watching Tom Conti, I kept thinking 'who does he remind me of?' and it is Hugh Grant. Grant has copied Conti's cadence and mannerisms.
Having watched this on PBS in the 1970's and now at this stage of my life, I see the events from a very different perspective. Just as fun. The staging and set is terrific, and the theme music delightful.",1387929600,,543,4.608247422680412

1342977,5,B00004REYW,"A wonderful trilogy comedy. On the stage it was presented on three consecutive evenings. Each episode takes place in a different location in and around and English house: The dining room, the living room and the garden. What has happened to one of the players as they enter from one of the other locations may not be explained until that location is watched. Each location is on a seperate disk. Watch the Dining room, Living room and garden in that order. Very clever, very funny.",1371600000,,481,4.670588235294118
1342978,2,B00004REYW,My fault for choosing this. It is written beautifully but time has taken its toll on the subject matter and pace of presentation.,1370649600,3,129,4.6521739130434785
1342979,5,B00004REYW,"This group of 3 DVDs is very unique. English humor at its best, but also with a twist. The same story is told but it's as if you are a spectator in a room watching what is happening. In each DVD you are in a different room and get to see and hear what you only guessed at while ""siiting and observing"" in the other room. Fun and intellectual!",1361318400,,342,3.971014492753623
1342980,5,B00004REYW,"I would recommend the product to anyone who likes British comedies. It is understated and amusing.
This play was presented on television years ago. I was delighted when I found it listed on Amazon. I had tried to find it for years. The delivery was prompt and the product in good condition.",1361318400,,290,4.596153846153846
1342981,5,B00004REYW,What a treat this is!  I saw it on tv about 30 years ago and have been looking for a VCR or DVD ever since.  It's an amazing cast and the story is very original and well presented.,1355961600,,180,3.710526315789474
1342982,5,B00004REYW,I saw this show back in the 70's on PBS and since then have remembered it and waiting for a VHS to come out...I bought them about 10 years ago and to this day still watch the set several times a year.  I thought this to be funny and very entertaining to watch.  I feel you have to like British humor to really enjoy this style of filming/humor. Classic!,1354492800,,353,4.101449275362318
1342983,5,B00004REYW,"I haven't actually opened this package yet so I hope it will be in good condition but I couldn't resist getting this hilarious 3- part play by Alan Ackybourne.  I remember laughing my head off many years ago and I'm thrilled to see this again with all the British actors we know in their prime- Tom Conti, Penelope Keith, Richard Briers, Penelope Wilton and many more.",1349481600,,368,4.575757575757576
1343004,1,B00004REYW,"and thankfully never knew anyone like this!

Splendidly amusing huh? Hilarious, eh? Well, we operate on different planes I'm afraid. At this point I've stopped worrying about those who hate my opinions and not my writing, but this was a tedious and irritating waste of five hours. I only plowed through so I could write an honest review. But my life would have been better served had I quit after part I; heck, fifteen minutes in, when I was already hating it, would have been smarter yet.

A play has to have a couple of things. Wit, interesting characters, a good plot, a theme worth chewing on would be some of the components I might be looking for. I found none of them here. Let's start with the theme...I would have to describe it as, ""If you flatter a woman enough, no matter how unpleasant you are, you can bed her if she's not too choosy."" If there is an alternate theme in this tale, I missed it. Lying, deceit, and insults were the tools Norman used to make his conquests. Whew....what a charmer! No romantic he; oh no, he is a skillful predator and calculating schemer. Would you even shake this guy's hand without feeling for your wallet afterwards?

Wit? If you find teen age insults witty, then this is for you. Not a memorable or skillfully crafted line here; just tiresome haranguing and adolescent spewing. ""Me me me,"" they all say. ""Why won't you be nicer to me?"" That gets old in a hurry.

Besides Norman the creep there are 4 other decidedly nasty people. (Thankfully, the most unpleasant of all remained offstage.) Short tempered, boorish, selfish, rude, argumentative, and fabulously boring, they imagine themselves special but are in fact utterly banal. Not one of them would make a good companion for a train trip. Marriage? Wow, flee! Flee!

And then Tom, poor Tom the oaf, who is so dim he has no idea what is going on. (I guess vet school must not have been particularly demanding.) Repeatedly laughed at, manipulated, and belittled by his ""friends,"" he struggles to understand what these fools are doing, but because he cannot readily ascribe evil motives to people he likes, he is bamboozled and befuddled. Now, he was not a particularly appealing character either. No diamond in the rough there; just a lot of crumbled coal.

The rest are foul. Keep `em. I hope to never meet such jerks in my life. Martyrs all, suffering under the weariness of their self-appointed burdens, incapable of a kind or decent word except when hoping to seduce or be seduced. People with no ambition other than to love and be loved....oh yeah, show me anyone here who knows anything about love! Good riddance......",1326153600,8,2623,4.691304347826087
1343005,5,B00004REYW,"The writing and acting are perfect and the convention of seeing the action taking place in 3 three different areas of the house, with the resulting hints and questions about what's going on in the other 2 rooms is really fun.  Anyone with an appreciation of of the humor found in the family dynamic will be charmed.",1313971200,3,315,4.526315789473684
1343006,1,B00004REYW,Very difficult to watch.  Dated and poor acting.  These are brillant plays when done on stage.  Save your money.,1312675200,3,112,4.7894736842105265
1343007,5,B00004REYW,"After one has watched two plays, one is intrigued to see how the same weekend can be viewed from a third perspective ... but Ayckbourn continues to spin the magic.
So English yet so universal.",1309392000,4,192,4.514285714285714
1343008,5,B00004REYW,"Alan Ackbourne's writing cannot be surpassed.  I saw these plays one Friday evening, Saturday matinee then that same evening when they first opened in the West End.  The TV productions are brilliant and whereas I thought the plays would not stand on their own I was entirely wrong.  The final play 'Round and Round the Garden' while ringing all the ""strings"" together,is hilarious.  Tom Conti is nothing short of superb and the talents of all actors bring all the pieces incredibly to life.
Solid entertainment - 6 stars!

When dvds came into common use, I searched far and wide for The Norman Conquests, but only found a British edition, not playable on American players.  I went to a lot of trouble finding a DVD player that would work in the US but play British region dvds, just so I could watch The Norman Conquests.  It's great to see it released now in the US so more of us can enjoy it -- worth every penny.

Now, if only we could get the Emma Thompson/Ian Richardson/David Troughton (who plays - wonderfully - the befuddled Tom here) The Winslow Boy on American DVD, my happiness would be complete!",1304899200,6,632,4.330508474576271

Norman is played by Tom Conti who causes most of the problems by coming to take his wife's sister off to a hotel toogether for a weekend,Sarah and Reg have come up to take care of mother so Annie can go away all though they don't know about Norman being involved,theirs also Tom who is Annie's friend who doesn't seem to be all there,later on Ruth Norman's wife shows up during the weekend,so comes the laughs.my favorite one of the trilogy is Living Together but their all very funny and have a lot to say about family and relationships,so kick back and enjoy.",1302739200,3,853,4.304347826086956

It is easy to see this is a film of a play, tho there are outdoor scenes. Just as funny and touching the 2nd time as the first time we saw it.",1301529600,5,360,3.569620253164557
1343013,5,B00004REYW,"A perfect example of how good British television used to be, but probably never will be again. A dream cast, witty yet believable dialogue, a clever concept and unobtrusive direction. If you've seen The Norman Conquests before - it's just as brilliant as you remember. If you're finding it for the first time, you're in for a treat.

The premise is simple. Incurable romantic Norman has arrived to take his spinstery sister-in-law Annie away for a dirty weekend (to East Grinstead, where else?). Her mixed feelings about the prospective affair are complicated by the arrival of her brother Reg and his wife Sarah, not to mention the lurking on the fringes of a dim would-be suitor, a vet named Tom. All that's missing is Norman's wife Ruth, who duly arrives.

The weekend is enacted in three plays, each taking place in a different part of the house - the dining room, the living room, and the garden. Each play could stand on its own but all three together give the complete picture. An exit from one play is often an entrance into another. For instance, during a conversation between Annie and Tom in one play, Reg suddenly enters, looks around, picks up a wastepaper basket and walks out again. But in another play, Reg's wife is dying to know what is going on between Annie and Tom so sends Reg to investigate. Reluctant and embarrassed, he goes only to return with the wastepaper basket and precious little information. It's a tribute to Alan Ayckbourn's writing that what could have been so complicated works as smoothly - and as entertainingly - as it does. I should mention that it is possible to watch the three plays in any order.

But it's the performances that really make The Norman Conquests. Richard Briers and Penelope Keith as Reg and Sarah are fantastic as the sort of married couple we have all encountered and dread becoming. Penelope Wilton as Annie is touching and frail, but with the capacity to unleash fire and passion suddenly and unexpectedly. David Troughton is delightful as the slow-witted Tom, permanently confused but with his heart in the right place. Fiona Walker's Ruth is hard as nails, dripping with equal measures of sarcasm and exasperation. And holding it all together - or scattering sanity to the winds - is Tom Conti as Norman, a shuffling haystack of a creature, full of charm and poetic lust, as unreliable as he is irresistible.

These plays have been off our screens for far too long. It's wonderful to have them again - grab them quick before somebody changes their mind and withdraws them (as they did here in the UK)!",1301184000,22,2567,4.736017897091722

1343046,5,B00004REYW,"I never thought to see ""The Norman Conquests"" released on DVD.  This is a series of 3 plays by Alan Ayckbourn, each play taking place in a different area of a house, but covering the same ground.  It takes place on a weekend in the country, with revelations about different people/couples.  Richard Briers and Penelope Keith (both of ""The Good Life"" fame) star in these small cast productions. Very much looking forward to the DVD release!

From Alan Ayckbourn's official website:

 The reality of writing a trilogy was even more complex than it first appeared as paramount in Alan's mind was not only writing three plays which worked together, but that were - in essence - independent of each other and that could be seen in any order and not necessarily with either of the other two plays.

The plays were written simultaneously over a week in May 1973 with Alan writing each play cross-wise (i.e. all the scenes ones after each other, than all of the scenes twos etc). Despite this method of working, Alan Ayckbourn firmly believes each play has its own very distinct character: Table Manners is the funniest; Round And Round The Garden the more casual and conventional; Living Together a slower piece with a deliberate slackening of the pace. As to why Norman appears so late in Table Manners (the first of the plays to be rehearsed), this is simply because the actor playing Norman, Christopher Godwin, was unavailable for the first week of rehearsals and the script was altered accordingly.",1291852800,32,1496,4.8203125

TNC had runs in London and NY where you saw the 3 plays on any 3 consecutive nights. A gimic - sure. The genius comes in the wonderful, funny writing where the full story and the full understanding of the characters and their relationships blossom with each play. Your understanding of even simple plot points evolves when you see the other plays and what went on in the other rooms leading up to and following the plot points.

1343051,5,B00004REYW,The DVD version of the Norman Conquests trilogy has been available since Feb 6 2006 for 18.86 in the UK. All you need is a multi zone DVD player and a TV that can play PAL! If I didn't already have both I think I'd go out and buy them just to get this great series on DVD.,1101254400,7,272,3.706896551724138
1343052,5,B00004REYW,"These three plays are among the most brilliant ever conceived by the Great Performances series on PBS.  Tom Conti, Penelope Keith, Richard Briers, and the rest are amazing, as are the plays themselves.  My only over-riding question is --
WHEN WILL THEY BE AVAILABLE ON DVD???
Considering all the junk that is available, it seems a shame that this extraordinary trilogy is not.

1343053,5,B00004REYW,"And now, to counter rumors that I may possibly be an excessively negative person, here is a review of something that I liked very much.  Unlike seemingly everyone else here, I have no nostalgic attachment to these films, but I still think they're pretty great.  I got the set as a gift this past xmas, and I initially greeted it with baffled incomprehension: what the hell is this, and why would I be interested?  However, after my parents (god bless 'em) finally forced me to watch it earlier this Summer, all becomes clear: this is about as good as television gets.
Indeed, seeing something this good really forces you to recognize that most movies (and TV shows) are, when you come right down to it, pretty damned bad.  TNC, on the other hand, is pretty damned good: the characters and their relationships are well and subtly-developed, and there are no facile, all-encompassing 'solutions' to the conflicts therein.  All six characters are real, wholly believable people, with no fatuous moralizing on the part of the writer, implicit or otherwise, to be seen.  They're occasionally screamingly funny, but never at the expense of character--everything flows naturally out of who they are.  At the end of the third film I felt a distinct sense of melancholy that I had to leave these people--and that's about the highest praise I can give.",995760000,16,1342,4.859649122807017

7921028,5,B00004REYW,"I love seeing this fantastic Alan Ackborne play again. I heard about this production in the mid 80's, when it was shown on PBS. I looked ""The Norman Conquests"" up at my local library in the mid 90's and saw it for the 1st time. TNC was fantastic, the characters were fresh and the situation were unlike any I had viewed up to that time.
 This presentation is 3 plays showing a Saturday thru Monday weekend.  Two plays occurs in rooms at a suburban home in England. The 3rd play occurs outside that home in the garden. ""Table Manners"" is located in the dining room. The time frame is the 70's, I believe. The humor can go from amusing to over the top in a matter of seconds. The plays are like ""Who Afraid of Virginia Wolff"", in that some people might think the humor is too rough emotionally. I find the humor exciting.
The 2nd play is located in the living room and called ""Living Together"". This plays all share the same time frame, so the action spills from one location into another. It seems to me the situations and humor come into sharper focus in ""Living Together"". There are plenty of unexpected twists in where the situation seems to be leading.
The final play is""Around and Around the Garden"". I think ""The Norman Conquests"" benefits from moving the play out of doors. The confining feeling of the first two plays is lightened by putting the action in the garden. Characters become more realized. The humor is softer and more playful. The play seems to rush to it's ending.
There are six characters in ""The Norman Conquests"" and also a very important character off stage. Three of the characters are two sisters and their older brother. Another two are a husband and a wife, married into the family. The final person is veterinarian that visits the sister that lives in the family home. The family is dysfunctional, as all are to a degree.
I laughed and smiled a lot when I saw this production a long time ago. I did so again when I completed  TNC last night. If I see these plays again, I know I will be happy once again, if only for a little while.",1459209600,,2061,4.432717678100264
