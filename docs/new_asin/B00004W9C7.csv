1363000,5,B00004W9C7,"The worst collection?  No the second was the worst.  This has the best 007 movie of all, FRWL, and YOLT and DAF are both great because of Sean  Connery.  Each collection has one of the best:1 has Goldfinger; 2 has On  Her Majesty's Secret Service; and 3 of course has From Russia With Love.  A  View To A Kill, along with The Man With The Golden Gun, are the worst of  all.  Moore is too old. The Living Daylights is good, but not as good as  Licence to Kill.  Another reason why #2 was bad was Mooraker.  Moonraker is  about the third worst Bond movie.  The other three in the #2 set (DN,  OHMSS, and, TSWLM) are all in the better half of the series. Octopussy is  the second best Roger Moore movie behind TSWLM despite his age.  FYEO is  close behind Octopussy though.  This set is good. I would get it if I  didn't already have all of them.  My favorite ones in the series are  FRWL,OHMSS,GF,TND,YOLT,GE,TB,DN,TSWLM",969235200,3,918,4.339285714285714
1363001,5,B00004W9C7,"This third James Bond set contains some very entertaining Bond films that each have an essence of their own. From Russia With Love ranks as one of the best movies of the series. Both Diamonds are Forever and You Only Live Twice are each fun films, though each does have a tendancy to drag in some parts. These two were the beginning of some of the comic book aspects of the series that were to come in the seventies. Nontheless, these last two Connery Bonds were so substantial that even today the Austin Powers films have borrowed liberally from each.
Octopussy is one of the best films of the Roger Moore era. It is superb in all respects. A View to a Kill is at best a spotty film, but it does provide a healthy dose of dry wit and memorable performances (specifically from Patrick Macnee, who shares a great chemistry with Moore in his too few moments on screen).
The Living Daylights also showes a harder-edged Bond that harkens back to the Fleming novels and the first film the the set, From Russia With Love. All in all, a very successful and distinct performance from Timothy Dalton.
These movies are all very distinct, and show varying interpretations of the character and reflect the time period in which each film was made. This set is highly recommended.",967507200,,1266,4.581497797356828
1363002,5,B00004W9C7,"This third boxset contains not the best Bond films, but (we all know) the Bond films are the best! One thing that amazes me after watching various  LDs and DVDs in my collection, is that one consistently returns to watching  Bond, even after years of absence. They are supremely well made (how many  movies have their own dedicated studio and special effects/stunt etc.  teams? Are there any such competitors? ), and basically are the best,  however much one compares between the films and highlights relatively small  differentials. The long duration of the films alone - usually with several  genres per film - makes them good value for money. Bottomline, this is a  must-buy for any DVD collector.",967334400,4,700,4.923076923076923
1363003,5,B00004W9C7,"Finally, the James Bond Collection Volume 3. As an owner of the previous  two box sets on DVD I have been anxiously awaiting the completion of this  fine set. Some say that this is the worst of the three sets but I beg to  differ. First of all, From Russia With Love. What a picture. Everything  from the first time we se Blofeld and his cat to Red Grant. That fight on  the train is one of the longest in film history. I love the scene with the  helocopters chaseing Bond on foot. Plus that wonderful John Berry  music. Next is You Only Live Twice. Bond dies. We see Blofelds face finally  in the most influential incarnation of the leader of spectre to date. Plus  the beautiful scenery of Japan. Little Nellie the helocopter is a wonderful  addition as well. This movie is the mst notible for having inspired the  Austin Powers movies. Then we have Diamonds Are Forever. The scenery isn't  nearly as exotic as other Bond outings but it is nice to see 007 in a more  familier locale. Las Vegas. Some of the carchase scenes are remancent of  Smokey and the Bandit which has it's pros and cons. Charles Gray isn't the  best Blofeld (He has hair for crying out loud!!) but this role is better  suited for him than his part in the Rocky Horror Picture Show. The finale  on the oil rig in Baja California is stupendous but lacks the originality  the same basic scenes in the previous outings had. But let's face it,  nearly every one of the Bond finales ended basically like that. Then  Octopussy. This one throws in everything but the kitchen sink. My favorite  scene is when 007 poses as a stiff and scares the heck out of some guys  desposing of dead bodies. The opening teaser is hilarious (Fill her up  please) but the fight on the flying plane was a bit too much. A View to a  kill, generally considered to be the worst of all the 007's isn't really  that bad. The California Girls tune that accompanies Bond's snowboarding  leaves me in stitches each timke I view it. Tanya Roberts does hollar  ""James!"" just a few to many times. The final fight on the  GoldenGate bridge is among myall time favorite 007 scenes. And Finally The  Living Daylights. I've been waiting for this one. Tomothy Dalton was one  serious Bond which hurt his popularity in the roll when it should have lent  it credibility. He was Bond with an edge. The fight while holding on to a  net full of bags of drugs while airborn is fantastic. The final baddie  wasn't as impressive an his henchmen though which is usually a mistake.  Plus what's this bringing Joe Don Baker back as a CIA Agent. They could at  least tried to make him look a bit different when her returned as Jack Wade  for GoldenEye and Tomorrow Never Dies. All in all this is a good set well  worth the price on VHS or DVD. But in my opinion, this set is reason enough  to upgrade to DVD posthaste and purchase all three sets.",966729600,,2866,4.388571428571429
1363004,5,B00004W9C7,"So, finally the last of the James Bond movies arrive on DVD.  And you get quite a variety, including 3 Sean Connery outings (the last set only had 1  and the first had 2 by Sean).  From Russia With Love is the best of the 3.  The Bond film made just before Goldfinger gives us a James Bond who's not  use to having gadgets around to save his neck every time he gets in a jam.  Robert Shaw stands out as the evil henchmen (like Oddjob) working for  SPECTRE in is sure to be remembered as one of the greatest train fights in  history.  You Only Live Twice pits Bond against SPECTRE again, who this  time are trying to start WWIII by stealing U.S. and Soviet space vehicles  and making it look like the other country is responsible.  Bond gets  married to a Japanese woman (but only for undercover purposes) and the two  track down the secret volcano lair of Blofeld (Austin Powers got many of  it's ideas from this bond film including Dr. Evil's face job, taken right  from Donald Pleasance's Blofeld here.  After You Only Live Twice, Sean  Connery decided he'd had enough of playing 007 and decided not to star in  the next film, On Her Majesty's Secret Service.  Many diehard Bond fans  like myself feel that if he had taken the part, this would have been the  most successful Bond film of it's generation.  But oddly enough, the  producers were able to persuade Sean to come back an do one more Bond,  Diamonds Are Forever.  It would be the first Bond shot in the 70's, with  007 doing what he does best, mixing it up with the baddies and indulging  himself with the ladies.  Don't miss the classic fight between him and  Bambi and Thumper.  Roger Moore's last two 007 films continue this set,  beginning with Octopussy, a grand, if not a bit silly, story in which Bond  must track down the killer of a fellow double 0 agent as well as woo an  seduce the lovely Maude Adams who previously acted in The Man With The  Golden Gun (She was killed in that one).  The opening sequence is a lot of  fun, as Bond flies a small jet plane, cutting through a hanger and making  it all the way out before the doors are closed on him as a heat seeking  missile flies after him.  Moore's last Bond, A View To A Kill, will  probably be best known for it's title song, performed by Duran Duran (the  most successful Bond song in history).  In this outing Bond takes on the  microchip world and the baddies, played by a very blonde Christopher Walken  along with his henchwoman, Grace Jones are out to keep him from spoiling  all the fun.  Tanya Roberts (who can now be seen on That 70's Show) plays  the 'Bond Girl (just how many times can she scream ""James! "" in  one scene?) with relative ease.  And finally, Mr. Timothy Dalton's debut as  007 in, The Living Daylights.  What's nice about this one is that Bond only  has one love interest which makes it a bit romantic for some, but again a  bit disappointing for others who want it the way it's always been.  Dalton,  takes a very serious tone with the Bond character, a trait that he has  often been criticized for (Moore too smarmy, and Brosnan a bit too stiff).  All I can say is, nobody does it better than Sean, but please, cut the rest  of these fine actor's some slack.  Each one gives us a unique perspective  of the life of 007.  This should be revered, not trampled on.  As for  special features, this set, like the two earlier one's, is jam packed with  audio commentaries, making of's, trailers, music videos and more. My only  complaint is that they did not leave a space open for Bond #20 in this  collector's box like they did for The World Is Not Enough in the previous  set.  This means when #20 comes out it will be left out of the set or MGM  will release another set to buy all over again.  They can say that it's  because nothing is definite with Bond #20 but lets face it, we know it's  coming and they should have left a space for it.  Other than that, this 3rd  set is a wonderful edition to the world of 007.",965433600,17,3971,4.302040816326531
1363005,4,B00004W9C7,"this set IS deffinitly the worst of the 3, but that doesn't mean it's not good! Sean's From Russia with Love and Daltons Living Daylights films are worth getting the whole set! if not a fan, just buy the two singular, but  for the price of the 6 together and two singular,it's better to have em'  all, with out spending too much more! Diamonds are Forever and View to a  Kill KINDA ruin the set, just warning you! I feel sad that now, the Bond  boxed sets have come to and end.

1363006,4,B00004W9C7,"Finally, the last six James Bond movies have been re-released (or will be re-released rather) on VHS and enhanced DVD. This set includes The Living Daylights, Diamonds Are Forever, You Only Live Twice, From Russia With  Love, Octopussy, and A View to a Kill. Unfortunately, this set is perhaps  the weakest one of the three gift sets. While From Russia With Love is  generally regarded as a Bond classic, the other five titles are hit-or-miss  (either you'll love it or you'll hate it). The Living Daylights is a great  spy story, but some fans hate Dalton's Bond. Similarly, Connery is a fan  favorite but YOLT and Diamonds are lackluster to some in terms of his  acting ability and plotline. If you're a genuine Bond fan, by all means  grab this set, each of these films is worth viewing at least once (and the  DVD's throw in great extras, I'm told). Casual fans wanting a guaranteed  thrill should just get From Russia with love.",964656000,33,933,4.668711656441718

1363113,4,B00004W9C7,"This boxset isn't bad, in fact it's great. It was the first 007 boxset I got. It's just that it isn't as good as the other 2 Special Edition boxsets. There's one Sean Connery movie here, ""Thunderball"" (007 hunts SPECTRE agent Emilio Largo, who has stolen two nuclear bombs and is holding the world ransom). ""Thunderball"" is my least favorite of the Connery movies. The underwater scenes are slow and not that exciting, dragging the movie down. There's George Lazenby's one Bond movie, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" (007 hunts down Blofeld, and 007 also falls in love). Lazenby's one movie is one of the best Bond movies, certainly one of my favorites, and is extremely underrated. There are 3 Roger Moore movies, ""Live And Let Die"" (007 vs. a powerful drug dealer and his voodoo army); ""Octopussy"" (007 must prevent a nuclear bomb from exploding in a American airbase in West Germany); and ""A View To A Kill"" (007 must stop a madman from destroying Silicon Valley to increase the price of microchips). ""LALD"" is a good movie, not Moore's best, but still entertaining. ""Octopussy"" I don't like very much, the entire movie is ridiculous, even more so than ""Moonraker"", in my opinion. ""AVTAK"" is ok. It's silly entertainment, and one of Moore's weakest, but it's still an ok movie. Finally, there is Pierce Brosnan's latest, ""Die Another Day"" (007 goes up against a mad business man who will use a satellite made of diamonds to destroy the DMZ between N. and S. Korea). Yes, the plot for ""DAD"" is kind of out there, but it's my favorite Brosnan movie. It's fast paced, exciting, with some futuristic gadgets (but hey, Bond movies SHOULD have fururistic gadgets, or none at all). This boxset only has 6 movies, which is a bit of a letdown, but there was no 7th movie to put in. Overall an ok boxset, good for the beginner fan, as it has a good mix of movies in it (some great, some not so great).",1155859200,,1896,4.612426035502959
1363114,4,B00004W9C7,"An overall good set, the movies are a must for any true Bond fan.  DO NOT pay $250 for the set.  I bought all the movies in the set separately and paid right around $160.  I don't know who these yahoos are trying to sell these sets for that much.",1144368000,4,246,3.88
1363115,5,B00004W9C7,"This collection includes various Bond movies from four of the actors that have played James Bond in the ""official"" Bond movies, which excludes ""Never Say Never Again.""  My only complaint about the three collections is that the movies are not in order.  I have all three sets because I like Bond rather than wanting all the Bond movies by one of the three actors.  However, you have to take them as you can get them sometimes.

Each of the movies in this collection is a ""special edition,"" which is a fancy name for DVDs that include extras that range in value from high to low.  I have been very fascinated with some of the commentaries and making of features, but some of the features seemed like filler.  However, what I found interesting other may not, and vice versa.  Rather than listing all the extras, a list of which is available, I will discuss each of the six movies briefly.

In ""Thunderball,"" S.P.E.C.T.R.E.s #2 man (Largo) leads a rather complex scheme to steal two nuclear bombs carried by a British Vulcan bomber. All the double-Os are mobilized to find who stole the bombs and to get them back to prevent having to pay the $100 million ransom, a rather princely sum in 1965.  Bond gets to escape from a villa with a rocket pack and then zooms off in his Aston-Martin DB-5, which is a fun car in any era with machine guns, ejection seat, and numerous other goodies no spy should be without) and lots of spy movie action. Once Largo takes the bombs, the tech gets higher as does the action.

George Lazenby was Bond only in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service.  Bond is on a witch hunt for Ernst Blofeld after what happened in ""You Only Live Twice."" Initially Bond plans on resigning, but Moneypenny cleverly gets the resignation changed to a two week vacation. Bond sets out to track down Blofeld. After a side-track to Portugal, James finds Blofeld in the Alps. A variety of action scenes ensue, leading to Bond getting married to Diana Rigg. Yes, it really happened. Watch and see.

Roger Moore's first appearance as James Bond was in ""Live and Let Die.""  While Yaphet Kotto was an excellent bad guy, too much of this movie seemed like exploitation, and most of the drug dealers were black.  I was also disappointed that Bond was reduced to chasing after drug dealers rather than someone threatening western civilization.

When agent 009 turns up stabbed with a valuable jeweled egg, James Bond is on the case in ""Octopussy.""  His investigation leads him to India, where he learns that Kamal Khan is involved in a number of activities, some of them apparently involving Octopussy, a female smuggler who makes her home on an island where there are only women.  As the movie unfolds we learn that General Orlov has been plotting with Kamal Khan to use the military superiority of the Soviet Union to show the world that the Soviet Union remains a potent world power.  Kamal Khan's interest is money, however, and he cares little for Orlov's activities other than how he can benefit from them.

""A View to a Kill"" was Roger Moore's last Bond film.  This film was also Lois Maxwell's (Moneypenny) last Bond film.  The principal villain this time is Max Zorin, excellently played as a psychotic by Christopher Walken.  Max is out for money and power, aided by a host of very smart people.  Grace Jones, who also supported Conan in ""Conan the Destroyer,"" plays Max's sidekick May Day.  Dr. Karl Mortner (Willoughby Gray) is Max's father, as well as a kind of mad scientist.  All the crazies hang out together.  Max has an interesting scheme to cause Silicon Valley to flood and leave Max and his cohorts in possession of the bulk of the world supply of electronic chips.  Of course James Bond is unaware of this scheme and spends much of the movie trying to understand what Max's game may be.

In 2002 Pierce Brosnan returned for the fourth and final time as James Bond, in the twentieth official Bond film, ""Die Another Day.""  This Bond movie begins with Bond penetrating North Korea.  However, something goes wrong and North Koreans capture Bond.  Bond is traded for a North Korean agent, but is not pleased that he was traded; he is even less pleased that he is being considered a traitor.  Bond is not one for waiting for things to happen, so he escapes from custody to discover that he is in Hong Kong.  Eventually Bond discovers complicated plots involving the Icarus solar satellite, and manages with Halle Berry's help to unravel everyone involved.

Because of all the extras these DVDs require hours to watch.  While the value of the extras varies, watching them gives a fan much more information about the difficulties of making each movie, and how many of the stunts were performed.  I consider these movies to be among the gems of my DVD collection.  I recommend this set very highly as long as you plan on collecting all the Bond films.",1129334400,6,4857,4.651817116060961

1363122,4,B00004W9C7,"With the exception of Diamonds Are Forever, there really hasn't been a Bond that wasn't at least a lot of fun:
THUNDERBALL:  Probably Connery's best performance as Bond.  This one is ""more Bond than Bond"" and it works very hard to please and mostly succeeds.  The final underwater battle could be trimmed a bit.
OHMSS:  Okay, this is the greatest Bond movie ever.  It is the only one that could really be called ""epic.""  Sure, the other movies are huge, but this one feels epic.  Lazenby is the most physical Bond and in many ways the most likeable.  The scene where he loses his wife at the end is one of the best Bond moments ever.
LIVE AND LET DIE:  This movie suffers from Diamonds-are-forever syndrome.  LALD is big and exotic but it feels static (like DIAMONDS before it).  However, Roger Moore's introduction as Bond is funny and sets the tone for his interpretation thereafter.  Yaphet Kotto and his henchmen all make terrific villains, too (especially Tee Hee).
VIEW TO A KILL:  This is more ""classic Bond"" than some are willing to admit.  It is a lean, no-gadgets movie that is, in the best tradition of Moore, witty, exciting and stylish.  It is also the only Bond to film in America (San Francisco) and actually make good use of its American locations.  A fine swan song for Roger Moore's 007.
OCTOPUSSY:  Very cold war.  This movie also dishes up the most bizarre imagery since YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE.  The beginning gives us a clown being chased by twin knife throwers deep inside the Eastern Bloc.  This movie owes more to Indiana Jones than other Bonds and it is a lot of fun for it.  Definitely a top notch Bond.
DIE ANOTHER DAY:  Brosnan is great as Bond (though he doesn't actually make a likeable Bond).  This movie is very huge and there is a lot to like.  But owing to its hugeness (and the fact that the Brosnan Bonds no longer have the great creative stable of writers Michael Wilson and Richard Maibaum and director John Glen) it is an uneven movie.  The Bonds keep getting bigger but that may not ultimately work in their favor.  Still, this movie tries hard and the results are mostly enjoyable.
So ... this isn't a rummage sale of okay Bonds.  There's good stuff here.  Lots of fun to be had and a collection that is worth the price of admission.",1081382400,16,2271,4.513513513513513
1363123,5,B00004W9C7,"In THUNDERBALL 007's Astin Martin DB5 returns and so do the evil forces of S.P.E.C.T.R.E. In his fourth film Sean Connery is self-assured, inimitably virile and an infallible James Bond. Adolfo Celi as Emilio Largo devises and implements a plan that ultimately draws 007 to the Bahamas in search of a missing Vulcan jet lost on a NATO training sortie. This is a lavish Bond film where most of the action takes place underwater. What makes the film very memorable is John Barry's rich and esoteric score combined with Lamar Boren's beautiful and picturesque underwater photography. ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE is the one film closest to any of Ian Fleming's Bond novels. George Lazenby, possessing the physique and physical attributes that fit the role, gives a visually striking and straightforward performance in his only appearance as James Bond. The combined efforts of all the filmmakers and Lazenby's performance of a James Bond with conviction, assuredness and determination make this a definitive James Bond film. The film has a sense of undeniable drive behind it accentuated by Lazenby's no-nonsense approach and the urgency of John Barry's instrumental theme used repeatedly to never let up the pace. There are intensely choreographed fights of great ferocity, exciting and incredible ski chases, car chases, an alpine battle atop an ice-capped peak and an extraordinary thrilling bobsled chase. There is more action, suspense and emotion packed into this film than any other in the series. LIVE AND LET DIE is the one film in the James Bond series that stands out from the rest. This is Roger Moore's first film as James Bond. If you examine this film you will see that Bond is no perfunctory agent. He dispenses lethal doses of vengeful comeuppance with his urbane charm. The film's lighter approach under Guy Hamilton's direction actually makes many of the scenes of violent and contorted death more palatable. On closer examination this film is a highly stylized piece of action filled nonsense that delivers outrageous thrills, characters, dialogue and humor in a well-choreographed non-stop bit of filmmaking. OCTOPUSSY is a rare gem of the series. It falls somewhere between the style of FOR YOUR EYES ONLY and MOONRAKER and in some scenes even hearkens back to the subtly of GOLDFINGER. The scenes with M, Q and Moneypenny and even the confrontations with Louis Jourdan as Kamal are reminiscent of earlier days. Elements of the script go back to Fleming's short stories: ""The Property of a Lady"" and ""Octopussy."" The suspenseful and awe-inspiring pre-credit sequence is one of the best, highlighted with John Barry's pure Bondian score. Barry also did a fine job scoring the scenes involving the Soviets, which embodied an eastern block flavor reminiscent of the cold war. Roger Moore goes through his paces for queen and country and will not be deterred until the villain is vanquished, but he does it in such gentlemanly fashion that it continues to hit a chord with many viewers earning him continued acceptance. OCTOPUSSY is one of the most underrated films in the series as it brought true substance to the character of James Bond. In A VIEW TO A KILL your heart kind of went out for Roger. John Barry's score is somewhat sentimentally romantic with a tinge of melancholy conceivably out of respect for Roger. The one image that remains with me from this film is when Bond carries Stacey on his back climbing down the fire truck ladder rescuing her from the burning City Hall. As corny as that scene may have looked it hearkened back to a time in films when heroes really were heroes. Christopher Walken gives a brilliant performance as the aloof and psychotic Max Zorin, a steroid child of Nazi experimentation. You really want to see him get his comeuppance. A VIEW TO A KILL is a mixture of the 80's craziness and a feeling of melancholy for what once was. It's nostalgic Bond and imaginative filmmaking. DIE ANOTHER DAY is very good and we see James Bond get involved in and out of some situations we thought we would never see on the screen. Not since ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE and THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH have we seen this amount of engaging insight into the psyche of James Bond. True to the best films in the series, Bond is not infallible but he is resourceful and loyal and will not be deterred from seeing duty and justice served. The second hour reverts to the superhero version of Bond this time aided by gadgets and computer generated effects that defy all credibility. Toby Stephens gave an excellent performance as the villain Gustav Graves. Halle Berry as Jinx was adequate as a Bond girl. John Cleese as the new Quartermaster looked more at home than many of the other regulars. I suppose Cleese has some of the best lines in this film. Even though his scene is brief it does make a lasting impression. Madonna's cameo as Verity the fencing coach was a pleasant surprise. Also, her main title song went appropriately well with the film's opening. As for David Arnold's score, it continues to emulate John Barry's style but contains a good deal more of the composer's own creating a hybrid sound. You have to give Arnold credit for that. Arnold does seem to demonstrate moments of brilliance especially in his love scene compositions but he should follow the rule of ""less is more"" when it comes to scoring the action scenes.",1078358400,,5375,4.868995633187773
1363124,2,B00004W9C7,"This is quite obviously the final set in this collection, and I have to wonder if half the project team over at MGM wasn't in favor of just waiting 'til after the next movie comes out on DVD to put this together.  It's such a cobbled-together set that it really feels like an afterthought when compared to the two previous well-balanced sets.  Not just in terms of packaging (I will whine later about that), but three of six films are Moore-Bond-ness, with one Connery, one Lazenby and one Brosnan thrown in.  That factor alone gives it a very ""dated"" feel -- and not in that ""classic"" way that we get from the earliest entries in this series.
Anyway.  Mixture aside, they're Bond movies, so obviously they're worth watching.
Thunderball - Say what you will about badly-done film-speed effects or lengthy underwater fight scenes, this is one of the better Bond movies.  It's got the standard end-of-the-world plot complete with SPECTRE-madman-with-bomb, but that's just part of the charm.  I'm not even listing this as a favorite because I'm some kind of Connery die-hard fan.  (Brosnan is rapidly becoming my favorite Bond for the way he manages to be a spy and an action hero at the same time.)  It's just plain good.
OHMSS - The un-Bond Bond movie.  It is, yet it isn't, and therein lies the allure.  Lazenby isn't what you'd call a talented actor, but there's something nice about his much more low-key portrayal of Bond.  It's definitely a good thing that there was only one Lazemby movie, but I admit to being curious what it would be like.  Worth watching, probalby worth owning, even if just for its novelty value.  Diana Rigg is the quintessential Bond girl, and boosts this movie's value enormously by her mere presence.  I'm twenty-six and I perfectly understand my dad's obsession with her.  Yow.
Live and Let Die - Yaphet Kotto is a thoroughly undervalued actor, and I'm very pleased to see him as a Bond villain.  The plot wasn't *that* weak, and it's not Moore's worst outing, but I still felt like Kotto was wasted here.  You gotta admit, though... it ain't a bad song.
Octopussy - Why, exactly, did we bring back Maud Adams?  She really wasn't good first time, and putting her in a *terrible* (bad, bad, bad, bad, bad) Bond film didn't improve my impression of her.
A View to a Kill - I'm sensing a theme in this set.  Good actor wasted in a mediocre role in a bad movie.  No one will ever convince me that Christopher Walken did not have the potential to play the best Bond villain ever.  Sadly, he wasn't given the chance to try.  Grace Jones can't act, but she kicks butt.  Christopher Walken didn't kick butt, but he can act.  I guess there's some sort of balance there.
Die Another Day - I shall not discuss the content of this film, because I have nothing to add on that subject... possibly because there *was* no content to it.  What I *will* say is how ticked off I was to see one of those terrible pre-menu ads on this disc... FOR THE BOXED SET I WAS WATCHING.  I mean, really.  I know it would have cost a lot to release a wholly different version of this DVD, but in any event...  Still, there's something to be said for any movie that has Judy Densch and John Cleese.
The A-R nitpicker in me is annoyed that the packaging for Die Another Day is different from the other 19 movies in this set.  But I won't go there.
Yes, I will.  A paper insert costs nothing, and I can't believe that sales of ""Die Another Day"" were all that huge; the market was CLEARLY the collectors, and hence, the boxed sets.  So... disregard for the target market/audience?  Is that what they're doing at MGM these days?
It's the weakest of the three box sets, of course.  But you'll buy it anyway, because if you bought the other two, you really have no choice.  Capitalism and collections seem to work that way.",1077235200,7,3815,4.513119533527697
1363125,4,B00004W9C7,"I can't bear to rate a bond film badly.
Here we are
Thunderball- Excellent film. Underwater action at its finest, strong villain and plot, nice bond girl and good allies.
On Her Majesty's Secret Service- This is the bond film that holds the distinction of double rankings in my personal ratings. It gets a tie for second if you discount Lazenby and the relatively poor editing. It gets down to 20th in official films only (twilighteye, this is why NSNA is not in the sets, as it is an 'unofficial' film made by WB and ken Mc Clory) because of Lazenby. He is in my opinion the worst actor ever.
Every single supporting actor does an excellent job, and Diana Rigg does an excellent job as one of the most important Bond Girls ever. Savalas' Blofeld is great, and Ferzetti as Draco is unparalleled. 10/10 (without laz) OR 1/10 (laz included)
P.S. Timothy Dalton turned down the contract on grounds of age for this film, though he would have been great if a bit young.
LALD- Ranking at third in my personal list, LALD is one of the better Moore films. An egotistical villain that isn't going out of his way to APPEAR menacing, and a really cool bond girl. Great plot and J.W. is hilarious.
OP- I like this movie a lot, even if Moore is a bit old. It ranks 14th in my rankings but I wish it could be higher. I just like a lot of other movies :)
AVTAK- this movie is just SAD. Roger moore is, bluntly, OLD! Couple that with a really bad bond girl and even the great Walken as Zorin cannot save it.
DAD- 19th out of 20th. This film is essentially a RIP OFF of Diamonds are Forever. And just about everything not from DAF is from another bond film. Digital effects suck. good main villain, and Frost is hot enough to melt her name, but they can't save it.",1071792000,3,1747,4.313069908814589
1363126,3,B00004W9C7,"Here we get Bond stirred not shaken. This boxed set is an oddity as it has one of the best of the Bond films in the series (On Her Majesty's Secret Service) and a couple of the worst (Octopussy...From a View to a Kill take your pick).
Thunderball isn't the best of the Connery Bond films. It was later remade as Never Say Never Again with Connery and substanial script changes to make it just different enough so that fans didn't feel they were seeing the same thing twice. The underwater sequence of Thunderball makes this film worth having though.
On Her Majesty's Secret Service would been a perfect Bond film for Connery if he hadn't declined to appear in the role again (only a great deal of money for charity convinced him to do Diamonds Are Forever a lesser Connery Bond film). George Lazensby has been bashed from the very beginning but he does a very good job as Bond bringing a unique humanity missing from Connery's hard edged portrayal and Moore's humorous take on Bond. It works primarily because Bond is, yes, in love and gets married in this classic thriller.
Telly Savalas is rarely mentioned for his nasty portrayal of the villian in this classic piece but he does a great job. His Blofield is every bit Bond's equal. The direction by the late Peter Hunt makes this an outstanding Bond adventure and the stunts equal just about anything that came before.
Diana Rigg (Mrs. Peel from the classic television series The Avengers) is the perfect foil for Bond and the perfect love match as well. She provides added kick to the role.
Live and Let Die doesn't quite live up to the best in the series but has some strong moments. The theme song by Paul McCartney is among the best Bond songs ever written and performed. It was originally written without knowing exactly who was going to fill the Bond shoes and what qualities they would have brought. So while it was adjusted to Roger Moore, there's still enough of the Connery sensibility to make it a worthwhile film.
It did seem silly, though, for Bond to battling ""only"" a drug lord but Yaphet Kotto brings enough edge and menace to the role to make it work. He's one of America's underrated actors and a treasure in any role he's taken whether it be this one or his work on Homocide: Life On The Street twenty plus years later.
Have to disagree about Jane Seymour. She was perfectly cast although a bit young in the part. She would certainly capture my attention if I were Bond. The rest of the casting is equally inspired. I loved David Hedison as Felix (he is one of the few actors to reprise the role as well in one of the Timothy Dalton Bond films).
It's a pity that none of these films are available individually at this time (eventually I'm sure they will be re-released) as On Her Majesty's Secret Service is one I would buy outside of this overpriced set. If you're a completist, by all means purchase the set but if not, wait for the titles to be re-released individually for the titles you like. I'm also a fan of Live and Let Die (for a number of personal reasons)and am disappointed that's not available as well as I would have purchased the two better titles and not bothered with the rest.
Picture, sound quality and extras are stellar. I'm not clear if the version of On Her Majesty's Secret Service released here i the original theatrical release or the re-edited version Hunt did much later for television. From what I recall, the latter had new footage that hadn't appeared before and the story flow was slightly different. Don't have a video tape version to compare it to unfortunately.",1071446400,4,3569,4.552099533437014
1363127,4,B00004W9C7,"The third and final volume of the James Bond DVD Collection is quite possibly the less alluring, most underrated set of the three volumes.  All of the Bond flicks, save for Thunderball, are those movies in the series which you either love or for a huge chunk of Bond aficionados, love to hate.  At least from my perspective, as a seasoned Bond veteran, I find all of the Bond films in the series, enjoyable, some more than others, despite the cheesiness and mediocrity that mires a good portion of the series.  Therefore, this set is worth checking out.  Here's my rundown of the Bond films in this set:
1. Thunderball (1965): This is Sean Connery in his prime as the super-suave Agent 007.  Connery seems to have a formidable feel for how James Bond is to be portrayed.  As for the film itself, it echoes the same archetypal world domination plot laid out by 1964's Goldfinger. SPECTRE holds the United States and Britain for ransom by threatening to launch an atomic bomb at each nation.  Thunderball is a classic Bond flick, despite the extensive action (i.e. the climactic underwater fight scene) which drag the film.  5/5.
2. On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969). Australian-born George Lazenby's first and last Bond film. If you thought you needed extra patience for watching rather tedious Thunderball, dig deep because this is the longest Bond film of all time, clocking in at 2 hours and 22 minutes. OHMSS, as Ian Fleming intended, is a passionate tale as we see James fall in love and eventually marry Tracy, Bond's ideal companion, wonderfully portrayed by Diana Rigg.  Business must come before pleasure, as Bond exploits Blofeld's (Telly Savalas) master plan to release biological agents all over the world.  The film is a must-see despite its noticeable flaws (i.e. the fast frame rate of fighting scenes, Lazenby's static acting), because it is a pivotal chapter in the Bond series. 4.5/5.
3. Live and Let Die (1973): Roger Moore's first outing as 007, ushering in an over-the-top feel, which stemmed from Sean Connery's last two Bond films, You Only Live Twice and Diamonds Are Forever.  Moore portrays a Bond who is more dependent on his charm, grace, and arrogance rather than the grittier, keen Bond as featured in the Connery films.  In Live And Let Die, Bond investigates the murders of three fellow British agents only to uncover a scheme by a black diplomat/kingpin, Kananga/Mr. Big (Yaphet Kotto) to release free heroin on American soil.  Live and Let Die is rather comical, a bit controversial (i.e. black and southern white stereotypes), and rather quirky given the supernatural tone to the film.  Nonetheless, a fun Bond flick. 4/5.
4. Octopussy (1983): A throwback to the more serious Connery films and a turn away from the extremely over-the-top movies, typical of the early stages of the Moore era.  Bond ventures to India to spy on an Afghan prince, Kamal Khan (Louis Jourdan) and his association with a professional smuggler, Octopussy (Maud Adams) and with KGB officers. Later, Bond deduces Khan is utilizing Octopussy's circus front for a madman general to detonate a nuclear bomb on an American base in Germany and lead the Soviets to conquer Western Europe.  Definitely, one of Moore's best, a close second to The Spy Who Loved Me. 5/5.
5. A View to a Kill (1985): Moore's final outing as Bond which turns out to be a train wreck of a film.  In short, Bond keeps tabs on a psychotic microchip maker, Max Zorin (Christopher Walken), only to unravel his Goldfinger-reminiscent scheme to destroy Silicon Valley by way of forcing an earthquake and dominate the world's microchip market in doing so.  Moore and Walken are so-so, but the leading lady, a poster child for a living Barbie, Stacy (Tanya Roberts) is really what drags the film down. 3/5.
6. Die Another Day (2002): The most recent Bond flick, the fourth with Pierce Brosnan at the helm. In celebrating the 20th edition of Bond and the 40th anniversary of the first Bond film released, Dr. No, Die Another Day is a tribute to its predecessors, in that it is a cornucopia of moments which resemble memorable events and nuances of the old Bond movies.  The plot is much more outlandish than that of any Bond film, a far-out, over-digitallized, ""cyber-technic"" romp. It's highly overrated, too complex, much more than The Living Daylights, and just way too over-the-top. 2/5.
In summing up, Volume 3 is a solid collection, although, most of the films here on this set are probably just placeholders to make your Bond collection complete.",1071100800,3,4528,4.864759427828348

On Her Majesty's Secret Service - very faithful to the novel and one of the better Bond movies.  Good fight scenes, but still not sure about Lazenby.
Live and Let Die - an intense movie where Bond uses his wits to survive long enough for the showdown, then the gadgets save him.  The movie probably has held up better over time than the novel (even with J W Pepper), but the novel gives more motivation for the villain.
View to a Kill - weak (but hot) heroine, boring fire engine chase. Otherwise a watchable flick.  Great performance by Walken.
Octopussy - best title song of the series!  Plenty of eye candy and good action.

1363132,5,B00004W9C7,"MGM offers a new chance for 007's fans to have the complete collection by presenting the complete collection in three sets (except Never Say Never Again, available at Amazon for $13).
I do not agree with various comments from other reviewers complaining about the bad marketing of MGM, since they have already presented the movies in singles and in three sets before. And by presenting them, once again, with improved quality and logic price in three packages, there is no harm at all.
What is beautiful in James Bond movies is the concept. The imminent illusion of the ""non-reality"" in all his movies is something comfortable to every potential viewer. No one would be offended by the unbreakable hotshot imperialist; timely, everybody would enjoy the sophistication, manners and cold-blood brutality of a professional spy (and gentleman) mastering the world and women' hearts.
There is always something new in every movie, the sequence of the incidents, the very well woven plots and the presentation of psycho genius personalities or pathetic authoritarian leaders or governments. All are offered in new ways, new places and from different points of view that would necessary put you in suspense. The British sense of humor and the mysterious touch added to the colors of the hero have a lot of show-off in comparison to American-made movies, where heroes are presented from reality and where ""nobody care if you believe it or not"".
My best movies are ""Diamonds Are For Ever"", ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and ""Die Another Day""; but I always have a reason to watch other titles for the 10th or 20th time (I already saw ""Die Another Day"" for three times).
Probably, it is the best collection ever made to date, so if you believe that action movies are an important part of real Cinema, and that real entertainment is a just aim of it, I believe that you are having a very good chance to have the best of it in a very reasonable price. I am personally grabbing the chance to replace my old VHS collection with this sophisticated DVD one, I started with the first set and I am buying the other two, one in every next month.",1069459200,2,2117,4.755434782608695

Octopussy-although some do not like this movie at all,I must say I enjoyed it.(HIGHLY).  Roger Moore is a better James bond when he was old then when he was young,although never as good as Dalton but better than the rest.  John Barry's score is great and a relief after Bill Conti nearly messed up For your eyes only.  Moore already had done much better. Check the part where Rog is climbing outside the Monsoon palace and he sees Prince Kamal Khan greet General Orlov, Great MUSIC!!!
On her majesty's secret service-  This is in my three favorite Bonds section(along with For your eyes only and the living daylights).  The story is GREAT and Telly Savales is the best Blofeld which after all is Bond's arch nemesis.  This movie has an awesome score, Lots of great action and the story flows like water and does not EVER get boring, which some of Connery's previous ones do(like Thunderball).  I cannot believe how many people have never heard of this movie or George Lazenby, MGM did to this movie what they did to CLOWNHOUSE, which was also a GREAT movie that is also highly underrated and deserves more respect
LIVE AND LET DIE- this is not a good movie in any way. It is cheesy like most of Roger Moore's movies. Everyone loves the title song but i hate it. Roger Moore is at his best-looking though.  The only good thing about this movie is that Yaphet Kotto, who is suprisingly vicious and a great villian!!!
A view to A kill-If you are going to overload a dvd set with Roger Moore don't do it with his worst movies.(You might as well have put the man with the golden gun and moonraker in there too).
If you want a Bond set and good movies in it, then get Volume 2 which has Moonraker and For your eyes only, two good MOORE films but completely different.  A view to a kill plain out sucks.  There is no good action, no story, and ATROCIOUS acting.  How could they let this movie be made, they should have straight out skipped directly to the living daylights and give Rog the final good movie that he deserves to end his legacy with. TRAGIC
THUNDERBALL-One of Connery's pretty good ones, GOOD score and great cast and locations, but the story needs a serious jumpstart.  Connery really started to suck after this movie, but he is better than Brosnan ,at least.  Sir Sean kicks some ass at the end of this one. His best line in it ""can my friend rest, she's just dead"".  Terence Young was a great director to.  This is the only good movie in this box set, except for Lazenby's.
Die another Day- THIS MOVIE is just plain out awful and does not deserve to be in same class as these other movies i reviewed that are far superior.  Was i the only one who noticed that at the end they totally duplicated ""The Living Daylights"" when Brosnan does the same thing with a helicopter that Dalton does with the jeep and they copy Licence to Kill because Bond goes rogue.  They also copy the end of Goldfinger by trying to make a tense airplane fight, but the cheesy special effects make this movie even that much worse.  Halle Berry is a horrible Bond girl.  I wish Bond would strangle her for information or feed her to some sharks, but I never got that.  My father's girlfriend told me this was good?  What is wrong with people today.  No real tense action, all crap.

Having said that, the quality of the films varies widely, but that is to be expected from a series 40 plus years in the making.  Mr. Wilkinson (see other reviews), misses the point of On Her Majesty's Secret Service entirely.  Love it or hate it, it is the most satisfying emotionally of any of the Bonds, and I only wish Sean Connery had been the star. I also think referring to any 007 epic as ""retarded"" is a vapid generalization.  What does that mean, anyway?  ""Retarded"", as in not a fully realized work of art, cinematically retarded? Anyway, to me Pierce is the best Bond since Sean, and I feel all the movies are worth watching, even Never Say Never Again, a pallid remake of Thunderball.

1363137,4,B00004W9C7,"Anticipating a wonderful boxed set to complete my Bond Collection. I got the first collection for Christmas last year, and now the remaining Bond films will be available. I have really enjoyed the quality of the DVD's -- each entry menu is intriguingly cool and greets you in an interesting new way. The films are very well restored, and when you watch the trailers, you can really tell the difference. Remember that together these films span 40 years!
Although this set of 007 films include some of the less popular ones, I liked Octopussy with it's bad old cold war days plot and locations.  Also liked Die Another Day, with it's fresh gadgets.  Be warned, though that in this collection Die Another Day probably won't have all the special feautures of the 2 disc version sold by itself.  Anyway, it is a good movie -- Brosnan is really ""bonding"" to his role and Halle Berry is welcome to share the screen anytime!  And a View to a Kill is one I haven't seen in a very long time, with Roger Moore, Tanya Roberts and bizzare Christopher Walken.  This set will finish the collection with the 7 solid entrants from part 1 (Blue Box), but is generally not as packed as set #2.
Another tip -- MGM/UA is releasing 20 bond films in these sets. But if you want to be thorough, see Sean Connery's finale ""Never Say Never Again"" (from a Rival Studio) and maybe even get the 007 spoof ""Casino Royale"". That will finish the entire James Bond collection. Athough many people disparage it, I grabbed Never Say Never for a few bucks at a local mart, and it does have Kim Basinger!!",1066780800,7,1568,4.507042253521127

1363139,2,B00004W9C7,"I thought the purpose of breaking up these Bond DVDs into seemingly random volume collections was so that the lesser Bond films wouldn't be stuck in a box together. However, that's just what they ended up doing with this set.
The two greats here are Thunderball and On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Thunderball shows Bond mania at the top of its game, and while the underwater sequences are dragged out, this is still essential Bond. And say what you will about Lazenby, but OHMSS has story, heart, as well as action and beautiful girls. It's one of the most original films in the series.
Not to dump on Roger Moore, but unfortunately the stinkers in this set are all from him. Live and Let Die, for its occasionally quirkiness, is stil sub-par. Octopussy starts out promising but quickly becomes too convoluted for its own good. And only a good theme song and the appearance of Christopher Walken make A View to a Kill watchable.
And Die Another Day? Whether it's good or not isn't the point. Chances are most Bond fans already snagged their copy when the DVD arrived in stores earlier this year. Instead of releasing this set at the same time, MGM wants you to buy the disc again.
This set is for die-hard fans only. The great extras on these discs don't compensate for sub-par Bond movies and a bad marketing maneuver. Get Thunderball and OHMSS seperately.",1065484800,70,1359,4.666666666666667

THUNDERBALL, Connery's fourth movie. I think this is the best film out of connery's seven. 5 stars.
ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE is the least coolist bond movie. Not a bad film, most people don't like it, I see why but it's a bad film. I liked it(not as much as a Connery film but I liked it) but when it got to the end......let's just say it sucked. The ending just isn't very Bond like, ok kill his wife but don't make some fat granny do a drive by and shoot her and some how not hit Bond, it's retarded. So what if it was in the book, take it out, this is why this film isn't well liked.
LIVE AND LET DIE, Moore's first bond movie. cool but not moore's best. 4 stars
OCTOPUSSY, is a new type of Bond movie. this one has alot more action than the others, way ahead of it's time. Easily one of the best Bond film of all time! 5 stars.

Now tell me, how can you be a die-hard Bond fan if you don't like Roger Moore? He's in seven movies! If you are a Bond fan, how can you not like one of Moore movies?

1363141,3,B00004W9C7,"Let me start off by saying that this is the worst set of the 3 (I already reviewed the other two), but since I am a Bond fanatic, I feel obligated to buy this set.
*I grew up with Sean Connery, and while Thunderball is not his best, it ranks pretty high on my list of Bond films. Connery had not yet started to show his age (that would come in You Only Live Twice) and he was still able to do some very good fighting sequences. Largo is perhaps one of the best Bond villians (next to Goldfinger of course).
*On Her Majesty's Secret Service would have been the best Bond movie of all time had it not been for George Lazenby. At the time, I initially refused to go see this movie at the theater because I felt that some ""no name"" was taking the real James Bond away from me. However, after a friend convinced me to go see it, I realized that while Lazenby was subpar, this was a great movie. The fact that it doesn't fit the profile makes it superior to many of the films (i.e. Bond getting married). Telly Sevalas (pre-Kojak for those of you who know who that is) was hands down the best Blofeld, blowing Donald Pleasance and Charles Gray out of the water. Dianna Rigg was beautiful at the time, and made a perfect Mrs. Bond, if only for a short time. Would have been great if they had stuck with the original plan and cropped the ending and used it as the beginning to Diamonds are Forever.
*Live and Let Die marked the beginning of the Roger Moore era. When Connery retired (""officially"") after Diamonds are Forever, Moore brought a sense of humor to the series that many, including myself, disliked. While Jane Seymour was gorgeous at the time (hell still is), she was not the right fit for a Bond girl. This is by no means one of the worst in the series (that priviledge goes to Octopussy and View to a Kill), but it does not rank in my top 10.
*Octopussy was HORRIBLE. This is offically my worst Bond film. Roger Moore, who should have gone out on top after For Your Eyes Only, looked way too old for the part (like Connery in Never Say Never Again). And don't get me started on Maud Adams. Her acting was atrocious in The Man with the Golden Gun and she also looked pretty old for a Bond Girl. Horrible villians, girls and a horrible Bond make this the worst movie. While I liked the song, it never mentions Octopussy, making it virtually useless as a Bond song.
*As if Octopussy wasn't bad enough, along comes A View to a Kill. Roger Moore's last two outings tarnished what could have been a semi-great run at James Bond. Christopher Walken was born to play a Bond villian, and he is the sole reason I ever watched this atrocity. I guess if I were an 80's teen I would drool over Tanya Roberts, but all I saw was an wimpy Bond girl who couldn't act and who Mayday should have wasted. On the subject of Mayday, while she may look like a man, she was still a decent villianess for Bond to deal with. Roger Moore's last shot at Bond will always be remembered as a failure.
*My oh my how times have changed. Gone are the excellent storylines of From Russia With Love and Goldfinger, replaced now by the special effects era of Die Another Day. I guess the only people who liked this movie were the young Bond fans who never grew to appreciate the good Bond films. While The World is Not Enough wasn't perfect, Pierce still showed me that he still had it. After seeing this movie, I am not so sure. Only time will tell if Brosnan still has it in him to make another gem like Goldeneye. While Halle Berry is attractive as Jinx, I found the star of this movie to be Miranda Frost. She was a good throwback to the days of From Russia with Love and Thunderball, both of which had superb villianesses. Madonna's techno-laced theme is IMHO the worst in the series. Man how I miss the days of women like Shirley Bassey and Sheena Easton. After Moonraker bombed critically, Broccoli gave us For Your Eyes Only, which was one of the best Bond movies to date. So if history repeats itself, then maybe this next movie will return our hero to the formula of old and make this Bond fan happy once again.",1063152000,51,4090,4.285529715762274
1363142,4,B00004W9C7,"Let me just start and say that I am extremely happy with MGM's choice of releasing all three box sets for the holiday season.
I have been looking forward to this for a long time.
THUNDERBALL, Connery's fourth outing as 007 is a very pleasing installment in the collection. It contains all of the elements for a great Bond film. An exciting plot, a frightening villan, exotic locations, and beautiful women. Adolfo Celi is perfect as the cycloptic villan. And Claudine Auger is delicious as the bikini beauty. This is one Bond film you don't want to miss.
***1/2
O.H.M.S.S., is the 1st Bond film that follows the classic Ian Fleming tale almost word by word. Telly Savalas is great as the new ""punch ya lights out"" Blofeld. Diana Rigg is nothing but perfect as the love of Bond's life. However, Lazenby isn't as well cast as the rest of them. All of the Bonds have a special quality, except him. I was pleased to see that he didn't last long in the role at all.
***
LIVE AND LET DIE, is Moore's first appearance as the British spy in this comic book like movie. It features plot elements in the classic 70's tradition. I have to say Moore did quite well as his 1st time. However, it would be THE SPY WHO LOVED ME that established him as the character.
***
OCTOPUSSY, is a new type of Bond film which features a simple yet entertaining story. Stephen Berkoff plays the psychopathic Russian General Ourov bent on total Soviet control. Louis Jordan as the exiled Afghan prince who fund Ourov's scheme. This is a lesser-known Bond film that shouldn't be missed.
***
A VIEW TO A KILL, is Moore's final outing which was long overdue. This silly plot features a platinum blonde Christopher Walken as Max Zorin and his Amazonian mistress May Day (Grace Jones). The only highlight of this film is it's brilliant stunts. It is an easily overlooked Bond film.
**1/2
DIE ANOTHER DAY is possibly the worst 007 flick yet. This film is only a collage of the past 19 Bond films. Taking it's plot lines, screenplays, and famous scenes. I also didn't understand the hype which overtook Halle Berry's role. The whole DNA plot was just plain confusing and James Bond 007 shouldn't have spent 14 months in a North Korean prison and ending up looking like Robinson Crusoe. I hade very high expectations for this movie which were all for nothing.

1363143,4,B00004W9C7,"The third collection of the James Bond series has some of the best of the films, and in contrast, some of the not-so-good films. Starting off with DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER with Sean Connery as Bond, this one is somewhat lacklustre in comparison to the early 007 films, but there's still some fun to be had with some cool car chases through Vegas and an ensamble of menacing villians. The second entry into the Bond franchise, FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is brilliant entertainment taken from Ian Flemming's best novel. Everything clicked in this one after the sometimes shaky DR NO (Due mostly to the increase in budget), from Connery's commanding performance, to some gripping action and the late, great Robert Shaw as a ruthless assasin. Gadgets, cool action and the entry of Q, played by Desmond LLewelyn. Masterfully constructed, FRWL is one of the greatest films ever made.
Following Roger Moore's long list of films, Timothy Dalton made his debut as the charming secret agent in THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS. While the action is impressive, the film falls short of having any meaty villians. But Dalton is much closer to the mark with the character of Bond in Flemming's books. His performance, restrained at times, is a more cold portrayal than Moore. OCTOPUSSY is one of Roger Moore's better films, but John Glen's ham-fisted direction leaves the film with little in the way of inventive action. Last but not least, YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE. Connery is good, but not up to his usaul standards. This collection, while impressive, is perhaps best suited for hard-core fans rather than action buffs.",1032825600,6,1581,4.925093632958801

Connery is at his best with this one. -""You Only Live Twice"": A personal favorite of mine. This one takes Bond to Japan. Although Connery's acting shows his growing distest for the role, the film has it's moments. Blofeld is finally seen, Helga Brandt is a great villainess, and the volcano lair is a classic. -""Diamonds Are Forever"": Connery's last film is a far cry from his previous five, but it isn't all that bad. It's over the top but doesn't cross the line like Roger Moore did a few times.  -""Octopussy"": One of Roger Moore's best. The settings are great, Kristina Waybourn as Magda is one of the best Bond girls, and Maud Adams proves she is always welcome as a Bond girl. The film has it's moments though when I'm reminded exactly why I dislike Roger Moore so much. -""A View to a Kill"": This is as bad as it gets. At 57 years old Roger Moore decides he should do one last film. The plot is weak, the main Bond girl (Tanya Roberts as Stacey Sutton) is drab and stupid, and most of the dialouge is stupid. The best part is the villains. Christopher Walkin and Grace Jones make for excellent baddies. Moore still should've retied after ""For Your Eyes Only"" though. -""The Living Daylights"": Timothy Dalton makes a welcome debut as James Bond in this one. After many, many years of Roger Moore's goofball antics, Dalton's hard-edged approach to playing Bond was very welcome. The film ranks as one of the best and is not one to be missed. The DVDs themselves once again feature great special features and menu screens.

1363147,4,B00004W9C7,"I agree with those who say that this is the weakest collection of three. Interesting, if the MGM studio left the weakest ones to the end or it just happened this way? The discs themself are, for sure, quite above the averige quality of DVD-s, on a 16/9 big screen TV you can hardly see any difference between the movie of the sixties or late eighties. The only thing what disturbed me was that the additional stuff, like inside documentaries, did not have a 16/9 format and also the original english translation was not directly available. The good thing was, that the discs included much additional material and  actually I liked the design of the covers. On my DVD-shelf the Bond series lay on the honoured place. There are some films among Bonds what are weaker than others. I am of the opinion that in this set the weakest ones were ""Diamonds are Forever"" and ""View To A Kill"". The first one was really a plague, it looked like an ordinary american adventure where a natural Bond-style can hardly be found. The second one was with Roger Moore, who was, by that time already 58 years old and looked too pale in the movie. Also, his motion in some places was not common to Bond because of that. Both in Octopussy and View to a kill we can hardly find any style what was common to classic Bond. Some may argue, but my favourite among these six is definetly The Living Daylights. Dalton plays a very serious Bond. So finally I am very satisfied because my collection of Bonds is now complete.",978480000,2,1492,4.485294117647059

1363150,5,B00004W9C7,"Another great job by the folks at MGM! Not only do we get 6 James Bond movies, but we get 6 DVD's loaded with tons of extra goodies. Most Bond fans are probably familiar with the films themselves, so I'll comment mostly on the extra features.
Each individual film features a highly informative ""behind the scenes"" documentary which includes interviews with principal film and crew members. Bond fans will be fascinated as the secrets behind many of the series' best known stunts are revealed. For example, there is a riveting sequence on ""Inside A View to a Kill""  in which stuntmen give us an inside look at how they accomplished the very dramatic and dangerous leap from the Eiffel Tower. Really good stuff!
In addition to the ""behind the scenes"" sagas, each disc also features an additional documentary. The topics covered are: Producer Harry Saltzman (on From Russia with Love disc), the brilliant James Bond Title Sequences (You Only Live Twice disc), Producer Cubby Broccoli (Diamonds Are Forever), Set Designer Peter Lamont(Octopussy), Bond Creator Ian Fleming (The Living Daylights) and The Music of James Bond (View to a Kill). Again, I found each documentary to be most enlightening and entertaining. In fact, I'd venture to say these extras alone make this package worthwhile. But, wait there's more....
Each disc includes a feature length audio commentary which consists of interviews with directors, cast and crew. The only dissapointment among the bunch was the commentary of ""From Russia with Love"" in which commentators seem to ramble endlessly about topics not related to the film.
You'll also get to view numerous trailers for each film. It's really fun to compare the difference in movie advertising from the 60's films to that of the 70's and 80's flicks. Some discs include radio spots, while ""The Living Daylights"" and ""View to a Kill"" feature the music videos of their respective title songs. A glossy mini-booklet, complete with color photos accompanies each title. Whew, what a package!  If every studio followed MGM's example, the world of DVD would be a much more exciting place.
Just for the heck of it, I'll give my own brief opinion (for what it's worth) of each film.
1)From Russia with Love (5 Stars -- perhaps the best Bond ever)
2)You Only Live Twice (3 1/2 Stars -- Beautiful to look at. However, a bit of a let down after the first four Bond films.)
3)Diamonds Are Forever (3 Stars -- Sean Connery's weakest outing, but it's still a lot of fun)
4)Octopussy (4 Stars -- One of Roger Moore's best)
5)A View to a Kill ( 1 Star -- absolutely awful)
6)Living Daylights (4 Stars -- Great debut by Timothy Dalton)",975024000,62,2642,4.855875831485587
1363151,1,B00004W9C7,"Bond Set 3 and Never Say Never Again DVD Problems The Bond Volume 3 has ""The Living Daylights"" and ""Octopussy"" on recall. For those that got it early call MGM at 1-877-646-4968  1-877-MGM-4YOU Email MGM 4you@mgm.com Attn: Carrie Smith and she will send you the UPS label and information about shipping them back to MGM in Santa Monica, CA. Include your name, address, phone number and where you purchased them at. O.K. folks A lot of questions have come up regarding the flawed bond DVD's. I will try an re-cap the information with specific flaws so that you know if your copy is one of them. The DVD's in question are Never Say Never Again, Octopussy, and The Living Dayligts. As of right now all of these DVD's are missing elements of the movie.  Never Say Never Again (Missing scene)  Towards the end of Chapter 19 Bond has the bouncer hold the cigar case in the closet.  Chapter 20 Bond is walking and ready to sit down and play largo in the video game.  There is scene between these two that shows bond after leaving the bouncer in the closet he walks around the casino and drops the bouncers gun in an ice bucket, then he sees Domino playing video games and says his famous line""My Name Is Bond, James Bond"". Then Bond and Domino sit down and have drinks. After that largo comes over. This entire scene is missing.  The Living Daylights (Subtitles Missing) The subtitles that are missing are NOT the ones that can be selected with your DVD players, such as Spanish, French or German. The sub-titles that are missing are the ones that are a part of the actual movie in order to let you know whats going on such as a location(""Bratislava"") or a time frame (""6 Months later""). This has nothing to do with the spoken language, however it has a lot to do with the story line of the movie.  After the opening titles and just before the concert a subtitle that depicts the location of the scene should appear ""Bratislava"". It is missing.  Also missing after Koskov is sent throught the pipe, Bond's female frind rezips her jumpsuit and tells the surpervisor ""I am not that kind of woman""
Octopussy (Subtitles Missing) After the opening ""East Berlin"" is shwon as the location. This is missing  Also early in the movie Bond is fighting one of the bad guys and throws him on a bed of nails. There is an indian man that was previously laying on the bed and yells in hindi,(I believe) at this time the subtitles are ""Get off my bed"". These subtitles are also missing.  later on in the movie another shot showing a different location your suppose to get a subtitles that says ""Kremlin Depositary"". This is also missing.  I am sure these are not all of them, however there are enough in here to let you know if your DVD is flawed or not.",974764800,90,2729,4.470824949698189
1363152,5,B00004W9C7,"Where do I start? All the bond movies are great, but don't get me wrong, some are better than others. Here are the order I would buy these DVD's in if I were to buy them seperate. The Living Daylights, Octopussy, From Russia With Love, You Only Live Twice, A View To A Kill, and Diamonds Are Forever. But this, of course is after I buy all the Brosnan Bond movies. Some people say all the new ones suck. While some say all the old ones suck. While I say, they're all good. It's just that some are better than others. Another factor that affects my DVD buy is the special features. Some are better than others. The one with the best special features is Tomorrow Never Dies (Brosnan, 1997). Well, if you like Bond and are amazingly rich, pick up this box set OR just buy some of your favourites.

They all have something to offer based on your on personal likes and dislikes.  This giftset completes the BOND collection and it is a shame, because the BOND DVDs are the best on the market.  Not only do they present the movie in terrific audio and visual clarity, they also contain many exciting and interesting extras.

I love DAF (not just because the opening is shot in my country, the Netherlands) and FRWL, and TLD is pretty decent, but i care a bit less about the rest. MGM did another excellent job at the picture quality of this set, and included some interesting documentaries on the music and all the title animations, amongst others.
On the downside, there's no subtitling on any disc this time (as opposed to the first box), only captioning, which my set doesn't support. Also, the case of TLD states that it features a 5.1 soundtrack, while there only is a 2.0 track.
But that's just nitpicking. Technically, the first box still is the best, with the most features and the least compatability problems. In my opinion, the third box contains the best and most varied movies of the series, and the second one contains all the others. So get this one, enjoy it, and let's hope that MGM will finish 40 years of bond with a 20th movie.",973382400,,1150,4.403755868544601
1363155,3,B00004W9C7,"My collection does not feature any of the errors that have been reported in the other reviews, but it is possible that some sets have errors while others do not.  MGM did slack off with these titles though.  Only ""From Russia With Love"" features the interacive still gallery that was standard in all the previous collections.  I got the feeling that this collection was more rushed than the other two.  While they are still great DVDs, they are disappointing when compared to the previous sets.  This probably explains why these titles are selling for less than the other ones.  Still, it's good to have for anyone who wants to complete their set.",973296000,2,647,4.732142857142857

1363159,5,B00004W9C7,"This third and last James Bond DVD set contains a wide variety of offerings:
The Good - From Russia with Love is probably the best James Bond film ever made; it's chock full of suspense and intrigue that will make any spy movie fan drool. The Living Daylights returns Bond to serious spying and along with For Your Eyes Only is the best James Bond film of the eighties.
The Bad - A View To A Kill is the worst James Bond movie of all time. It should be retitled ""Abbot and Costello Meet James Bond"". Has the ever been a worse Bond Girl than Tanya Roberts? You Only Live Twice was Sean Connery's worst by far. He didn't even try to act, not that the dialogue-bare and gadget-laden script gave him much of a chance. And that plot was the most outlandish of all.
The Very Funny - Diamonds Are Forever is by far the funniest of all James Bond films. Oh that dialogue! Connery, Charles Gray, Jill St. John and the rest of the cast take us on a comic book thrill ride that's more fun than...(you know the rest).
Finally, Octopussy is really a mix of suspense and fun; it's as if the producers weren't sure which type of film they wanted to make. Louis Jordan as Karmal Khan has some very witty lines reminiscent of Charles Gray in Diamonds Are Forever.",971827200,2,1246,4.306382978723405

You Only Live Twice and Diamonds are Forever are Connery's weakest, while Octopussy and A View To a Kill the worst entries from Moore, the worst Bond (OK, maybe Lazenbee was a little worse, but they only gave him one movie). The only other movie worth anything in this set is The Living Daylights. OK, Dalton takes himself a little to seriously to be a great Bond, but he does pretty well, and the rest of this movie is a lot of fun.

1363162,4,B00004W9C7,"The third James Bond collection is a treat for any Bond aficionado, with some of Connery, Moore, and Dalton's best work as 007, as well as some of the campiest of all Bond films!
'From Russia With Love', Sean Connery's second outing as Britain's greatest secret agent, is considered by many to be the best of ALL Bond movies; the high-tech gadgets so prevalent in later outings are at a minimum, the villains (Lotte Lenya and Robert Shaw) and allies (the great Pedro Armendarez, in his last film), are better defined, and Connery never looked more suave and deadly! The film has been compared favorably to Hitchcock's 'North by Northwest', and was Bond author Ian Fleming's personal favorite!
'You Only Live Twice' is a much weaker Connery entry ('On Her Majesty's Secret Service' had been planned as the 'Thunderball' follow-up, but was dropped in favor of this adventure). The film is uneven, with some bizzare moments, the strangest being when the hairy, 6'2"" Connery tries to pass as Japanese, for one sequence!  The film DOES offer some of the greatest action sequences of any Bond film, though (an army of Japanese fighters attacking the Ken Adam-designed secret rocket base is incredible!), John Barry's haunting score is unforgettable, and Japan has never looked livelier, or more mysterious!
'Diamonds Are Forever', Connery's last outing for the Saltzman/Broccoli team, finds him looking older, grayer, and stockier, in a light-hearted spoof of previous Bond films. The Las Vegas setting is decadent and glamourous, Jill St. John does a passable Lucille Ball imitation as Tiffany Case, and the tongue-in-cheek tone that would be predominant in the early Roger Moore films began here!
'Octopussy', Roger Moore's follow-up to the gritty 'For Your Eyes Only', was released the same year as Connery's 'Never Say Never Again', and both actors were slimmed down and in peak form, as competing 007s! This was Moore's last great Bond film, with terrific action scenes (the opening sequence, in a pocket jet fighter, is amazing!), a sexy co-star (Maud Adams, in her second appearance, is one of the BEST Bond leading ladies!) and genuine suspense! A real gem!
'A View to a Kill' is considered the worst Bond film ever made, which makes it a MUST for your collection, if you really want the complete Bond saga! A throwback to the early Moore spoofs, an aging Moore, looking taut from bad cosmetic surgery, gets to fight Christopher Walken (at his hammiest), while making love to Grace Jones(a truly BIZARRE match-up!) and Tanya Roberts, who ties with Denise Richards as the worst Bond leading lady ever! The wonderful Patrick Macnee makes a too-brief appearance as Bond's ally, and the climax, involving a blimp on the Golden Gate Bridge, is both preposterous and spectacular at the same time! Definitely a unique film!
'The Living Daylights' introduces Timothy Dalton as a harder-edged, yet more sensitive Bond, in a plot that was extemely topical, involving Russians and Afgans, double agents, and a beautiful musician, played by the luminous Maryam d'Abo. The film is a terrific adventure story, and many consider it to be Dalton's best performance as Bond! Definitely a keeper!
As always, these 'Special Edition' DVDS offer commentaries by the creative talent, terrific 'Behind-the-Scene' documentaries, and LOTS of other goodies!
This is a gift that your Bond fan will cherish, and you'll enjoy, again and again! I HIGHLY recommend it!",970617600,5,3439,5.086725663716814
1363163,5,B00004W9C7,"This set is better than the last one, and as someone who owns the previous sets I'm very much anticipating this one.  From Russia With Love, although not my personal favorite, is a classic OO7.  Octopussy is pretty good itself.  Diamonds are Forever is another great one.  You Only Live Twice is rather underrated in my opinion.  The Living Daylights is also underrated since Timothy Dalton was unlike most Bond's before him, but he still packed a punch when it counted (especially in the action scenes).  A View To A Kill, some call it the worst but I don't agree with that, because it's got a great opening sequence.  This set can't be as good as the first, not much can since it had three of my favorites For Your Eyes Only, Thunderball, and Goldfinger.  But every Bond collection is worth getting, the extra features on each are outstanding, even for a Bond film I really never cared for known as Man With The Golden Gun has a great feature about the stunts of the films.  The commentaries are usually informative and they are always filled with the insight of the pressure of making a Bond film.  The trailers are usually fun to watch because, like a lot of older films, people really didn't know how to make trailers back in the day and they are fun to watch how much the give away and how everyone claims to be the best Bond ever.

Before you purchase this package there are several things he may consider. One is they are cheaper to buy separately or as a package. Of course even if it is more expensive then you must consider the aesthetics of having a collection. Collections also help keep these individual DVDs from being scattered all over the house.

Another thing to consider is the technical version we went from standard DVDs to Blu-Ray and may go beyond that something new. However you keep waiting for the new technology you'll never have a set.

Now for the only real problem with this set it looks like somebody close their eyes and threw darts to figure out which bonds were going to be in it.
