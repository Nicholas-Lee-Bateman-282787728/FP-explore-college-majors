8290467,5,B001CYBFK2,"I have watched seasons one through five of Petersen's Hunting Adventure Television.  This is my favorite, although I must say that I enjoyed all of them.

I am a big game hunter, and I am a fan of Craig Boddington, one of the hosts.  Late at night, when I am trying to relax and take my mind off the challenges of the world, I like to watch these DVDs.  Each episode is short enough (half an hour), that even if I am not particularly interested in the hunt, I enjoy the episode.

This season is my favorite because I like the studio scenes introducing and concluding the hunt.  Also, in this season, they go to Zimbabwe and take a huge Cape Buffalo.  In later seasons, they do not hunt in Africa for any dangerous game.",1306713600,,719,4.281481481481482
