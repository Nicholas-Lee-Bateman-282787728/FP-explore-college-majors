1665565,2,B00005UM1W,"The writing is bad, the voices are annoying, the animation is cheesy....  But my two year old daughter LOVES it!  At least twenty times a day we hear the goofy theme music start up as she pops it in the VCR and starts hopping around our living room in her bunny ears.  Her enthusiasm alone earns it two stars.  And you know what?  If something were to happen to her beloved bunnies, I would immediately order a replacement copy.  She looks awfully cute in those bunny ears.",1094428800,,473,4.379310344827586
1665566,1,B00005UM1W,"The editorial review of this DVD is the wrong one.  It applies to ""Here Comes Peter Cottontail"" and not this title!  I purchased this, remembering ""Irontail"" from my youth.  However, ""Irontail"" does not appear in this DVD.  It is a cartoon and not claymation.  The cartoon is fine for small tykes but make sure you are ordering the correct title!",1052524800,4,346,4.7
1665567,1,B00005UM1W,"I believe that the reviews associated with this listing are for Here Comes Peter Cottontail, not this animation.  This DVD is an animated cartoon about a bunny named Peter who is given the responsibility by the mother rabbit to watch his four sisters.  Peter disregards every instruction his mother gives him and gets into a lot of trouble.  This movie has absolutely NOTHING to do with the Easter Bunny.  I feel that the title of this DVD is extremely misleading and the only reason I bought it was because of the supposed Easter theme.  This being said, my 2 and 4 year old girls loved hopping around the room as they watched this cartoon.",1050710400,6,641,4.587719298245614
1665568,4,B00005UM1W,My children ages 5 and 2 really enjoyed this cute Easter video.  They watch it all year round but get really excited about watching it the night before Easter.  The story is easy to follow and enjoyable to watch!,1045699200,,212,4.410256410256411

1665609,5,B00005UM1W,"This new version of Peter Rabbit is beautiful to look at and my kids loved every minute.  It tells great lessons about being honest, sticking together and friendship.  It has wonderful original songs like ""Veggies"".  My kids watch it over and over again.  In our house it has become a new favorite!",1377648000,3,298,4.673076923076923
1665610,5,B00005UM1W,My grandchildren ages 2 and 4 love this video.  We had it in VHS format and they just about wore it out.  I was so happy to find it in a DVD,1365465600,,140,3.34375

1665612,1,B00005UM1W,"My son was very disappointed.  The video quality was very bad.  Felt like I was watching bugs bunny from the 1940s, even sounded like bugs bunny.",1362441600,,145,4.538461538461538
1665613,4,B00005UM1W,"I do have to agree with other reviewers about the title.  My husband and I picked this up for our son, almost two, for his Easter basket.  It really has nothing to do with Easter, though.  My son adores it and watches it every chance he gets.  I like all of the classical music they play in the background.  Even though it isn't Easter, it still is a lot better than some things he could be watching, and it isn't overly irritating for adults.",1146441600,4,443,4.226190476190476
1665614,2,B00005UM1W,"I found this movie to be really annoying.  The voices are horrible.  But, my 4 year old daughter really enjoys it and has since she first got it on her 1st Easter.  My advice if you buy this is to put it on when you don't have to be in the room to hear it.",1114128000,,256,3.618181818181818
