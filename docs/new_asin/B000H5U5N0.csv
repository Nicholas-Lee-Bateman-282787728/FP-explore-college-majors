2627098,5,B000H5U5N0,"I like the idea of using your whole body to work your core abs.  This is a intersting way to keep your whittle your middle...okay, not very yogic, but you get the picture.  So far, I've only completed the segments 1 at a time which has been plenty for me.

I've found that whenever I describe Shiva Rea's DVD's the word thoughtful comes to mind and that's how I feel about this.  Time, effort, and care has been infused in and throughout this DVD.",1162425600,47,447,4.285714285714286
2627099,5,B000H5U5N0,"Wow, I love Shiva. What a wonderful way to work your abs and core. This is much better that doing crunches and counting reps. I am liberated from my old ab routine. This DVD allows you to work incredibly hard and deep but still enjoy the whole process. I love the section when Shiva suggests that you to close your eyes and work creatively combining the different movement she has shown. This DVD is perfect for Yogis and non-Yogis.",1162425600,9,432,4.481012658227848
2627100,5,B000H5U5N0,"I too had a chuckle when I saw Shiva Rea called ""The Madonna of Yoga.""  I can now say I am among those fortunate enough to have met this incredible lady and I know from first hand experience that she would never give herself such a self-lauding name, instead, she uses names such as ""River Guide"" and ""The small teacher"" (in comparison to the big teacher that is within most of us Yogis)to describe herself.

Ok, I have that off my chest, now I will say that this DVD is shorter than the rest of her creations but brings every ounce of inspiration and a new look at the practice of Yoga that her other DVD's have.  Also, as another reviewer mentioned, this is great on those days when you have less time or your body needs a workout that is less intense.  None of these sequences feel like you are doing ""ab work"", instead, it seems to me almost like dancing. Of course the music is also phenomenal, this gift of hers for choosing the perfect music for a sequence is no accident--this lady really lives for music!  I also recognize some of these movements from the Bear Bryant football days in training camp, except that those guys actually had to hold a bucket full of water and rotate around in a circle with it!

 I would caution those with knee issues--this DVD and her other newest DVD; Fluid Power both have some intense workouts for the knees so remember to listen to the great guru--your body and enjoy!",1162166400,18,1411,4.403846153846154
2627101,5,B000H5U5N0,"I have not been disappointed yet in any of Shiva Rea's DVDs (I believe her new Fluid Power one is my favorite).  This is another that will be incorporated into my rotation.  The workout is fluid and, as another reviewer mentioned, not crunch-heavy at all.  Definitely a different way of working your stomach muscles.  Doing any of her longer flows I feel my abs working , but for an extra day or two a week when you don't have the time to do a longer workout, this 30 minute program is ideal to just focus on your abdominals. A very enjoyable workout.",1161734400,6,551,4.372549019607843
2627102,5,B000H5U5N0,"I purchased this DVD (along with Shiva's latest Yoga Fluid Power) from another company.  This DVD provides a very unique way to work your abdominals.  It does not employ a lot of static crunches and situp type ab work that I am use to, instead you will utilize various body parts to work your abs.  A lot of the work you will do is very much based on the rhythm of the music that is playing in the background.  I would say that parts of workout are more like Shiva's trance dance type stuff, where there is room to find your own beat and style of performing a set of movements.  If you are use to yoga that has you sit in a position and then move to another (e.g. Iyengar) or even if you more used to constant movement (e.g. Vinyasa Flow, Ashtanga), you may still find this different.  In my opinion, it is  very fluid and more dance like than Shiva's very successful Yoga Shakti DVD. And depending upon what you want out of your yoga practice that could be either good or bad.  I liked the DVD because it gave me a way of working my abs that I would have never tried on my own.",1161043200,101,1078,4.124401913875598
2627143,5,B000H5U5N0,"The white sands provide the most beautiful setting. The workout is great, too! I felt it in the core, but in the limbs as well. It felt like a full body workout. The free-form movements were *different*, to say the least, but it really lifted my spirits. It's a keeper!",1334275200,,269,4.4
2627144,4,B000H5U5N0,"I love the spiritual take on working out that this video provides. It not only encourages you to connect with your body, but also to your energy and power source.
However, as much as I enjoy this workout, I do not believe it is suitable for beginners. You will feel very awkward and uncordinated if you are not familiar with yoga, or are not very flexible.
Overall, though, a very fun, and effective workout.",1332979200,,408,4.527027027027027
2627145,5,B000H5U5N0,"In the past I've never done an exercise video more than once.  Desperate to firm up my abs, and having a respect for yoga, I decided to try yet one more time a do-it-yourself workout routine with this DVD.  I love Shiva Rea!  Somehow she keeps things moving in a way that makes you wonder where the time went...rather than wondering how much longer you have to push through to the end.  And the music is awesome.  Finally I've found a workout that will actually become a routine because I enjoy doing it.  The first time I did it I felt like the workout wasn't very strenuous, but I did have sore muscles the next day.  So this DVD strikes what I consider a perfect balance - a good workout that somehow doesn't feel too intense.  It's really fun!",1323475200,,747,4.323741007194244
2627146,5,B000H5U5N0,"It is just plain fun to do.  She is full of bliss and doesn't push me beyond my own abilities, which is what yoga really should be.  I think this dvd can meet anyone's needs and potential.",1297296000,,188,4.054054054054054
2627147,5,B000H5U5N0,"Often times yoga DVDs get negative reviews -- I wish those folks would understand that yoga has so many variations, and you have to look at every video and teacher with the yoga mind... it is what it is. This video was exactly as described: a great core workout with imagination, great instruction and beautiful scenery! I felt pretty hip working with this one",1290816000,,360,4.640625
2627148,1,B000H5U5N0,"After reading most of the positive reviews, I chose to purchase this program and was eager for the arrival-much to my disappointment. Personally, I like a program with a structured lesson plan that can guide me through everyday practice. In my experience,Rodney Yee's beginner abs program has proven to be more effective in working the core and builds enough definition to clearly distinguish upper, middle, and lower abs.",1286755200,3,422,5.220588235294118
2627149,1,B000H5U5N0,"There was very minimal if no instructions and the camera angles were such that you couldn't clearly see how to do most of the moves. I have enough experience in Yoga but still found this very difficult.  I got dizzy trying to follow her. The exercises could be great, except, she needs to re-create this DVD with better instructions and camera angles (Shiva! Are you out there?  Please pay attention). This was more like a music video hightlighting Shiva's & the scenery's beauty.  I can't wait to see a newly improved version of this - better teaching?  Perhaps Jillian Michaels should help out.",1282780800,5,596,4.757281553398058
2627150,3,B000H5U5N0,"I had a hard time follwing the moves.  I am a huge fan of work- out videos, but this one was just a bit too creative for my liking.",1282176000,4,131,3.5172413793103448
2627151,4,B000H5U5N0,I loved this DVD.  I rented it from the library and plan to purchase it.  I usually read reviews before buying and had to write a review because I can't believe the complaints about this DVD.  It's creative abs because she gives you the tools to take the basic of what she shows you and express yourself.  Go somewhere with it.  It's awesome.  Do we have to be so programmed that we're unable to do creative work?  The only think I wished is to do some of the ab postures a little more to get a deeper workout.  However over all my core felt the work out.,1274659200,3,555,4.121495327102804
2627152,3,B000H5U5N0,"It's okay, but I was a bit dissappointed. I had never heard of Shiva Rea before, but thought I'd give it a shot. She is very hippie and free-spirited which is cool, but I was looking for someone more intense. I do like that there are three different lengthed workouts, though.",1271376000,,276,4.431372549019608
2627153,4,B000H5U5N0,"Creative Core Abs was a lot of fun.  I really enjoyed myself.  While I can't say this was the strongest core workout I've ever done, I appreciated the fact that there were no crunches or sit-ups or anything like that--just fluid motions focused on the core.  I really like Shiva Rea's style and was able, for the most part, to keep up with her.  The music was wonderful as well.  An overall good, fun workout.",1269216000,2,409,4.4
2627154,5,B000H5U5N0,"I have done the Water Core and Spontaneous Core sequences several times now, either together, or for the Spontaneous Core following a Core Fusion routine (it's a bonus segment on their newer Arms & Abs DVD).  Neither of the routines are particularly challenging for me, but I like that they offer something different than the ab routines I normally do.  I think it is important to work muscles in a variety of ways, so it's a nice alternative from my regular routine, or perhaps on days where I'm looking for something more gentle.  These routines tend to hit me more in the waist and obliques.

I did the Fire Core sequence for the first time today. I do planks and push ups as part of my normal routine and so this wasn't difficult for me.  But as my hip was a little sore today, I found that this was a nice option. With the flowing movements towards the end and twisting rotations it really loosened me up.

I did make a modification to the exercise where she is is on her knees and bending her body back.  That is too much strain on my knees so I did these as a seated exercise, similar to how she does later in the Water Core sequence.

All in all, I don't think this will be something I use as a set rotation in my schedule because it isn't challenging enough, but it will be great on days that I'm looking for a little variety.",1269043200,2,1335,4.26984126984127
2627155,2,B000H5U5N0,"I do a lot of yoga, so I thought I would really like Shiva Rea's ab workout; I didn't.  It doesn't have much structure at all and at the end of the ab segments she just tells you to basically do whatever you want.  The production quality is beautiful and the music is great - I just wish it was slightly more traditional.",1234915200,9,321,4.079365079365079
2627156,1,B000H5U5N0,"Like some other reviewers, I found this workout to be a little weird.  It lacked instructions, which is what I was expecting when I purchased this DVD.  The music can also get irritating after a while. I assume it would be great for creative types, but then again, if one were creative enough to do their own yoga/ab workout, one wouldn't need to purchase a DVD for such a workout, right?  Anyways, I did all three parts and didn't feel much afterwards.  I have been practicing yoga for about a year so I am familiar with most poses, yet in this DVD not many yoga poses were used (just planks and the like).

I feel so disappointed I wish that I could return this DVD, but obviously cannot anymore.",1232668800,12,698,4.37984496124031
2627157,5,B000H5U5N0,Shiva Rea takes is very unconventional when she takes you on a journey to your core. She talks about more than just muscle and twists--she talks about where your power derives from and how to harness it and be creative with in it. If you are tired of crunches and sit-ups you will enjoy this video! She is very creative and you can go as fast or as slow as you need. I feel very strong (in my abs)since I have added this DVD in my rotation.,1229126400,,440,4.068965517241379

2627159,5,B000H5U5N0,"Unless you've been living in a cave you've heard that exercisers need to change up their routine every now and then to get continual results. This DVD definitely does that. I have tried various Abs DVDs that claim they really beat your Abs down, but after awhile I found that most overlapped on quite a few exercises. This DVD though is very new and creative and works your Abs in a different way. I agree with another reviewer that it's nice to use your whole body to work your core. I like the water workout the best.",1222214400,2,519,4.360824742268041
2627160,5,B000H5U5N0,"This is one of Shiva's best! The dvd is so enlightning, but at the same time you don't even realize how hard you're working your core!

2627161,4,B000H5U5N0,"This is definitely more creative and interesting than just doing your standard crunches! I liked how in certain segments she would let you come up with your own routines instead of following her all the time. I know I felt my abs the next day. Also, I like how you could do the entire workout, approximately 40 mins, or separately, lasting between 10-20 mins each. Overall, a great core workout - everything gets hit: abs, back, and to a certain degree, arms and legs.",1220400000,,468,4.583333333333333
2627162,4,B000H5U5N0,Very well made video shot at sundown with brilliant scenery.  Instructor shows how these yoga-type exercises can enhance your ab workout.

2627163,5,B000H5U5N0,"I ordered Shiva Rea Creative Core Abs DVD from the library interloan system and it came in today! Yay! So here is the review.

Takes place in White Sands National Monument with a drummer on a rock and cool music. There is also a 'just music' option that is nice for just moving to or doing one's own yoga moves.

There are three workouts that can be done on their own or all rolled together. Done together it's a real nice burn for the torso/core in 35 minutes.

In separate sections here are the parts -

Water Core (10 min) - the 'easy' part. A good warm-up but still an excellent core burn. Creative, fun.

Spontaneous Core (8 min) - very tiring - this is really the hardest part, as there is no rest once you get both your head and the hips/legs in the air. The free form part is cool if you like Shiva's style.

Fire Core (17 mins) - Shiva moves fast in this, as she does in this whole DVD. You pretty much have to accept that it's okay to not be able to follow along at first, and not having a ton of structure until you've seen this a few times. This particular section is harder than part one and easier than part two.

I was some reviews on Amazon on this DVD and a lot of people find the last part, the Fire Core, the hardest. The Fire Core has a lot of regular planks, followed by one-legged planks and then this section where you kind of ""run in place"" while doing planks. Hard to describe but pretty nifty: I felt strong doing that. There are also some flowy warrior poses where you 'draw an arrow on a bow' - also pretty neat - and then whip your arms around while holding warrior 2. Made me feel like Artemis. :)

There is no Savasana in this DVD. I thought that was a bit odd, but I guess this is to be a short, contained core workout and not strictly yoga? Besides a few planks and cobras there are few typical, recognizable poses.

This DVD is experienced beginner to intermediate and I DO NOT think any yoga novice should expect to be able to follow along very closely. Shiva moves quite fast and does not explain what she's doing as she goes.

This is not a boring ab routine. What's best, in my view, is the 'creative' part. There are no crunches, just some really interesting freeform-yet-intense pulsing moves.

Definitely gets your sheen going! I did feel a fire in my belly afterwards, chilling out on the couch with the TV. The inner heat lasted about 20 minutes.

Well recommended for a quick, slightly intense core experience that Shiva  stamps with her typically enjoyable creative mark.",1213574400,14,2516,4.316348195329087
2627164,5,B000H5U5N0,Shiva Rea is such an inspiration to me... this DVD is GREAT... I feel my abs every time I use it... great workout and music... you can't go wrong with Shiva Rea!!!!,1211673600,,164,4.15625
2627165,1,B000H5U5N0,"This DVD gives several options for viewing, unfortunately turning the music off isn't one of them.  I never did make it through and entire workout because of this.",1210809600,3,163,4.821428571428571
2627166,1,B000H5U5N0,"I have only done this DVD once...have no inspiration to do it again, as it was not a good work out. I really expected more from Shiva- her other DVDs are great.",1204761600,5,160,4.03125
2627167,3,B000H5U5N0,"This is definitely a different approach to working out your core.  Over time, yoga instructor Shiva Rea's media releases have become more and more fluid and freeform, and Creative Core Abs is no exception.  The Main Menu of this DVD offers the following options:  Introduction-Play Workout-Chapter Index-Shiva Rea Biography-Music Options-Also from Acacia.

The Amazon.com editorial review did a very good job of breaking down the three practices available on this DVD.  The first, Water Core, is 10 minutes long.  All of the sequences here are performed on the floor, mostly on the knees or on the back, for the effect of a sort of flowing warm-up.  I found the music here very reminiscent of Ali McGraw's Yoga Mind & Body.  The next segment, Spontaneous Core, is the shortest at 8 minutes; this time there's a live drummer.  Shiva incorporates some of the movements from the Water Core, adds some crunch-like work, and then encourages you to put them all together in your own pattern.  Shiva ends with some stretches, including cobra pose.  The drummer continues into the final segment, Fire Core, a more lengthy practice (17 minutes).  Here Shiva starts with kapalabhati breathing (she also calls this ""Breath of Fire,"" but my understanding is that kapalabhati and breath of fire are two distinct types of yogic breathing).  This segment is definitely the most intense, as it incorporates quite a bit of plank work, including what Shiva calls an ""advanced agni kriya,"" or a sort of rapid plank with hopping each knee in and out; elbow plank appears as well.  This segment is the only one which includes some standing work, as Shiva performs squats, a fun take on Warrior 2 (adding a bow and arrow arm movement), and wide-legged standing forward bend.

As mentioned above, this is definitely an innovative approach to core work.  However, I found the actual effect on my core to be somewhat hit or miss:  sometimes I felt that I was strongly targeting my core, but at other times, it was so difficult to follow what Shiva was doing that I didn't feel I was getting much of a workout at all.  While some will surely find Shiva's unique approach refreshing, many are likely to find it just plain weird.  Although I do like Shiva, I find myself closer to the latter camp.  I don't mind non-traditional approaches to core work, but overall, this DVD was just not a good fit for me.",1204416000,22,2378,4.796068796068796
2627168,5,B000H5U5N0,This is a great yoga work out for abs.  This is a must have for teachers and those who enjoy yoga at home.,1201478400,,106,3.608695652173913

Not impressed- but i had sore abs afterwards, I am embarrased to ever do it again.",1201132800,6,341,3.8857142857142857
2627170,4,B000H5U5N0,"This is my first Shiva Rea workout that I have done.
This is definitely one of the more unique core exercise DVDs out there.  Not too many have instructors that tell you to improvise during the course of the ab workout.
Deceptively easy, if you perform the flow correctly, you will feel it the next day.  Takes a little getting used to the flow, for me a few times through.  On the new-agey side of yoga in feel and flavor, if that bothers you skip this one.  A lot of leaning back while on your knees (example, the front cover of the DVD).  There's a little bit of dance/rhythm to this, but really it's about a flowy rhythm.
The 35 minutes can be broken up into three segments, and the segments are distinct and of different styling.
I purchased this to add to my existing regimen of running and gym weightlifiting, and this seems to serve that purpose.  Currently in my workout DVD rotation.",1200787200,4,893,4.414634146341464

2627176,5,B000H5U5N0,"I bought this DVD a year ago , done some of it once and forgot about it since I was doing mainly her ""Yoga Shakti"" & ""Fluid Power"" and other workout DVD's, then a week ago I've done the whole DVD from start to finish and it was so much fun. The moves are very fluid and free yet you do feel your abs working especially if you focus to move from your core. I tried to do some of the exercises on the balance disc and it was much harder!
There are 3 segments : Water Core (also on Fluid Power) and Spontaneous Core are a little bit similar , most of the work is done on your back , some on your side or while sitting , some exercises similar to traditional crunches but with a little twist like double crunches with your legs in badhakonasana. Fire Core is the longest and the most challenging since it involves a lot of plank work , like doing a running move with your legs while in plank position. It ends with some standing poses which was refreshing. If you want a fun and different core workout then this is it.",1196985600,11,1014,4.075

I'm really not that excited by New Age stuff, and this DVD is pretty new age what with the drummer in the background and the fairly non-structured routines. I could also do without all the earth, wind and fire gibberish.

However, the actual workout will help to tone you up assuming you can keep up with the instructor. This is not a ""structured"" type routine! If you are the type who likes doing 50 pushups, 50 situps and so on you will probably not like this DVD - the instructor goes into all kinds of free flow motions throughout.",1190160000,17,637,4.352941176470588

2627183,5,B000H5U5N0,I insert one or two sections of this in between some other yoga training and it creates always a wonderful combination. Flowing and dancing brings to the strict cnservative and respectable moovements of yoga the  fresh touch it needs. Shiva rea has the talent to reinvent the known in a fresh way. It is a pleasure to try to follow her even if you can never do it perfectly.,1189296000,,374,4.420289855072464

2627185,3,B000H5U5N0,"I am a Shiva Rea fan and I was disappointed by this DVD.  First, it is very short, only 30 minutes.  It doesn't feature the yoga matrix.  Second, the workouts are not that great.  I do not feel that I get that great of an ab workout.  I would prefer to continue with my Pilates videos for that.  I guess it is a new kind of ab workout where you work the abdominals functionally, but I am used to a different type and it wasn't for me.  Also, in some areas, she tells you to improvise your ab workout.  This is a lot like Yoga Trance Dance, but you're on your back.  I felt strange doing this.  I am a dancer, and when I dance, I perform improvisationally, but doing an ab workout improvisationally was really strange.  It's not that I enjoy ab workouts so much that I can just let my spirit flow!",1184112000,12,796,4.103896103896104

2627188,4,B000H5U5N0,"I just purchased this DVD from Amazon in March 07.  Previous reviewers are right in that the scenery is beautiful as is the background music.

I am just beginning to learn Yoga and I felt that this video is for someone who has been practicing Yoga for sometime and knows all the names of the poses even with Shiva's ""freestyle"" form.  It was freestyle in the sense that she didn't have a set amount of repetitions, but just kept moving until her well-toned body felt it was time to stop.

I do better with very basic instructions that assumes that I have no previous experience with Yoga and takes me from a zero knowledge base to feeling somewhat knowledgeable by the end of the video.  This video didn't do that for me, but made me feel even more inadequate after viewing and trying to emulate the well-toned, ever fluid Shiva.

I suggest Leslie Sansone's work-out videos (Her pilates is great) for she takes you from knowing nothing to feeling somewhat competent when the video is over.  Her step-by-step instructions are easy to follow and I felt that I got a good work-out the first time to the 100th time!

Creative Core Abs would be a challenging, but exhilarting work-out for the advance Yoga student or teacher.  It is also refreshing seeing an older woman (Shiva has to be past 45) looking fit and buffed as any 20 year old!",1175472000,20,1334,4.548117154811716

As a dedicated beginner yogina (occasional practice for 2 years, daily home practice for 3 mo.), this DVD is my favorite way to end the active part of my morning yoga session. I really do feel like I'm unleashing creative energy (as goofy as that may sound), and I've definitely both built muscles and gotten more svelte. Since becoming serious about my yoga practice, I've gone down a whole dress size (I'm 22 and I haven't been a size 6 since the 8th grade!), and I definitely think this DVD has helped. Most importantly, though, it's really fun. I think most people will find something to love about this DVD.",1174867200,6,709,4.546875

However it think it is too short and would have been happy if she had used the matrix format that she used in Yoga Shakti. I feel that the segments were a bit rushed and could have been a bit longer. In order to really get the most out of the work, I have to stop the dvd and repeat some of the segments. But it is creative and fun but leaves me wanting more!",1174089600,5,514,3.858490566037736
2627192,4,B000H5U5N0,"The first thing you notice about this DVD is the breathtaking scenery--it's filmed in White Sands National Park, New Mexico.

The roughly 35-minute workout is divided into three segments: Water Core, Spontaneous Core, and Fire Core. Shiva provides easygoing instruction. Using both Sanskrit and English terminology, she shows modifications of the more difficult moves. On days when you just don't feel like working out, try this DVD--Shiva's fusion of yoga and toning might just change your attitude.",1173744000,,500,5.4935064935064934

2627207,4,B000H5U5N0,"For those who desire a break from the mundane abs crunch workout, this video features a freestyle way of engaging your core muscles.  Once you perform this, it seems natural that there are many very fluid movements for tightening up the abs, and in the process improving flexibility.  I also find it to be somewhat meditative, and definately de-stressing.  It is very creative. Although I still do my crunches and standard stomach exercises, using this DVD with the wonderful music in the background once or twice a week is a nice addition to my routine.",1170806400,9,554,4.810526315789474
2627208,4,B000H5U5N0,"The methods in this DVD are guaranteed to be different from any other core (abdominal) exercises you've done. The moves are based on yoga and are very fun and creative. I have to warn you that the DVD takes off at a blistering pace, so it takes a while to keep up (at least for a yoga novice like me). But once you get going you'll have an ab workout that really works and continues to be fun.

The music is excellent and the DVD lets you configure what you see and hear.

I dinged it a star because I really could have used an instruction section that teaches the moves and positions slowly. Also, sometimes the fancy production gets in the way of being able to see what Shiva is doing.",1170720000,7,687,4.196969696969697
2627209,4,B000H5U5N0,"I purchased this DVD because I never reclaimed my abs after I gave birth 2 1/2 years ago. I want them back! I think that this DVD will do the trick. It is a full yoga workout that also focuses good attention on the quads (a chronically weak area for me), shoulders, and hips. I am doing this as my only workout some days, supplementing with some cardio on others - it is short enough to fit into my busy schedule, and gives plenty of workout to me in my broken down condition.

I do find that the rapid pace of the DVD is too much for my level of fitness and yogic ability. For now, I am sticking with the setting-up variant of the pose, and settling into it, instead of moving on with Shiva into the more active variants. The key, for me, is to always keep doing something, and resist the temptation to sit back and watch while I am resting. I don't think that an ""easy version"" person is necessary to complement Shiva - the easy versions are all there, if you give yourself a little freedom to improvise around what Shiva is doing. And improvisation is one of the themes of the DVD, so I suspect that this is intentional.

I do not think that this DVD would be at all appropriate for true Yoga beginners; it requires a previous understanding of working with your breath and invoking your muscles. Also, a very fit person without previous yoga experience might find it ""too easy,"" from not understanding the underlying principles that give yoga its kick.

I knocked off a star for some production issues that happen to bug me personally. The setting (White Sands, NM) is beautiful, but I find myself wondering, ""how did they get Shiva and her mat into the middle of the wind-rippled sand without disturbing it?"" Also, the soundtrack doesn't match the actions of the drummer who you can see onscreen. The setting and the cinematagraphy are very ambitious, but they lack the little touches that would blend it into a seamless whole - I find myself thinking about production logistics, instead of being too immersed to notice.",1169769600,9,2024,4.509536784741145

My only problem with it is I wish that there had been someone working on the beach with Shiva doing an ""easier"" version of what she was doing. For less in shape people, this will be quite challenging and could have used a ""version"" that would catch someone up to eventually being able to do Shiva's version. However, this DVD is a prize for anyone wanting to work abs in a fluid creative way (instead of robot cruches that treat the body like a gym machine) hear beautiful music, and view a delicious beach and a sprited, deeply creative and alive woman.

Even more remarkable is that Shiva has produced another dvd that is miles ahead of similarly priced competition.  The cinematography and music are beautiful (just like on Yoga Shakti) and the sequence of movements is well thought out.  If you've never seen one of Shiva's yoga dvds you will be shocked how much work some people are willing to put into a production, and how crummy other yoga dvds seem in comparison.",1165276800,14,577,4.693069306930693

8136508,5,B000H5U5N0,"The Creative Core and Abs is the fifth Shiva Rea DVD I've bought. I've been so impressed with her style and instruction. Like most of her DVDs it's a little fast paced at first. It helps to already know the basic yoga poses. I always feel a little uncoordinated the first time I try to do one of her sequences, but by the second time around it becomes easier. I just love the movement and flow between the moves. It really allows me to unwind and relax, but still feel like I got a workout. The Creative Core and Abs is about 37 minutes total which is perfect for a good core workout. It also allows you to choose less time if you're in a hurry. Shiva Rea will usually start out with beginner moves and work up to advanced within the sequence. Don't be intimidated by the advanced moves. I usually hang out somewhere in between and still feel like I'm challenged. I like that I have something to work towards as I get better at the moves. I would recommend this DVD to those just past beginner (had a few yoga classes) to intermediate. It's fun, challenging and relaxing all at the same time.

Her other DVDs I recommend: Creative Core + Upper Body (35 min.), Creative Core + Lower Body (24 min.), Fluid Power (2 disks, 243 min.), Daily Energy (168 min.)

My sister has her prenatal DVD which is also really good.",1361232000,,1313,4.333333333333333

8136510,3,B000H5U5N0,"I am looking for yoga that emphasizes core abdominal work but this video doesn't really fit the bill. Yes, it does work your core and I'm sure I'll feel it tomorrow. But it's not really yoga. It's more like pilates with some yogic breathing thrown in. There's none of the meditative qualities of yoga and no sequences. No down dogs, mountain poses or savasana at the end. You just jump right into working your core. I think it would be a good supplement to a yoga session but it definitely won't replace it for me. Also, some of the moves are fairly complicated if you are as ungraceful and uncoordinated as I am. It takes a lot of effort to get my arms to coordinate with what my legs are doing waving about in the air as I'm lying on the floor trying to lift my buttocks and shoulders off the ground. So not what I'm looking for but if you just want to focus on ab work without much yoga then this will work for you. And you can't go wrong with the price.

The DVD is divided into 3 segments--1st one is called Water Core and it is 10 minutes, the 2nd is called Spontaneous Core and is 8 minutes and the 3rd is called Fire Core and is 17 minutes. I will most likely use this as an adjunct to my yoga routine, picking one segment to do each time.",1342137600,,1247,4.131687242798354
