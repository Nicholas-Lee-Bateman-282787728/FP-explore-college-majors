4887919,5,B005T0OX54,"This is an incredible dvd on what heroism, determination and ingenuity really mean.  These men and women from history and today are to be admired and to be learned from.  It is fascinating and makes one proud of our aviation history and the men and women who fly to keep us safe and free today.  This is a film that should be shown in every high school history classroom.  It will teach students about history and about what it takes to be an aviator today; the training, the study and the guts.  It is inspiring!!",1327881600,3,514,4.368421052631579

8485707,5,B005T0OX54,"Surprisingly good for the price. I've been an airplane fanatic since before I can remember and have loved Naval aviation since I learned about my granddad's career flying in WWII. This documentary takes you from current trainees about to do their first trap aboard a carrier fro the first time and along the way, injects some really good history of how naval aviation got its start and continues through a lot of aspects through WWII and Korea and Vietnam. As much of a nerd as I am for this stuff and all I've learned to this point, I actually learned some new info I was not aware of watching this. I'd have to recommend this if you're the type that loves the history and seeing how history affects the present generation of naval trainees working up for their future.",1478822400,3,770,4.546762589928058

8485712,2,B005T0OX54,"This documentary was quite entertaining and I did like the personalized stories of the aviators flying T-45 Goshawks.  I also enjoyed that it was interspersed with historical footage and commentary from the earliest days of naval aviation.  So why did I only give it 2 star?  Because this documentary, which bills itself as a chronicle of the 100 years of naval aviation history, did not devote a single mention or even 5 seconds of footage to the F-14 Tomcat!!  That's like doing a ""comprehensive"" documentary on World War II in Europe without mentioning D-Day or the Battle of the Bulge.  Gotta be kidding me.",1415404800,8,611,4.836538461538462
