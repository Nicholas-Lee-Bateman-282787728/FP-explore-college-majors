7867965,5,6304341717,celestial clockwork is absolutely one of my favorite films. It's kooky and queer and colorful and gives me ear-to-ear smiles every time I watch it and over the years that's a lot of smiles.,1420848000,,189,4.588235294117647
7867966,5,6304341717,"I have been waiting for years for this to come out on DVD! The opening scene is memorable, the heroine is incandescent, and the characters she meets are quirky--some are very likable, and some are very well suited to their roles in the movie. I can't wait to watch it again!",1412726400,,274,4.392156862745098

7867968,5,6304341717,"I saw this movie in the theater three times in a week and when it was shown on the Sundance Channel I made a video tape of it.
I really don't know how many times I've already seen it. All the actors were great and believable within this unbelievable silly and delightful movie.
I just love ""Armand's entrance""!and what about Professor Gregorieff?
If you like this type of quirky, funny art-house film, this is a must.
You'll take it out and view it as many times as I have.
P.S. If you like this movie get this filmaker's (Fina Torres) other gem:WOMAN ON TOP with Penelope Cruz at her most beautiful.",1186876800,,600,4.414414414414415

7867970,5,6304341717,"This is a wonderful warm & charming movie. A very original way of seeing Paris,and one of the best scenes ever  communicating the relationship between music & passion. Highly recommended ,I'm sure any sensitive viewer will be seduced by this film's innocence.",971481600,6,259,5.166666666666667
7867971,5,6304341717,"This classic art-house film is a charming combo of South American flavor mixed with European sophitication (the film's lead character flees a husband in Venezuela to pursue an opera career in Paris). The elements of both cultures mingle well to present a cute but predicteable story. However, no one should mind the predictability of this fariy tale turned art house film because the acting and cintementography are suberb! Fina Torres( the director) has her own brand of quirky film effects that can be seen in abundance throughout ""Celestial Clockwork"". If you enjoy foreign, alternative or starving artist story films, this one is a must see! Enjoy!",969926400,7,652,5.160377358490566
