3876439,1,B002997SJ6,"It was supposed to have one movie on one side and one movie on the other side, it only had the first movie. I sent it back because it was the other movie that I wanted.",1310515200,,168,3.6944444444444446
3876440,5,B002997SJ6,our whole family loves scoody doo and we are trying to get all the dvds made of him...this is such a neat dvd and the cats love him too.  thanks,1292976000,2,144,3.8
3876441,4,B002997SJ6,"What a surprise to see there were 2 Scooby Doo meets Batman episodes but no Scooby Doo meets the Harlem Globetrotters episodes.

I would've asked Amazon for a new set but my son had already watched this DVD and  loved it.  There was no sending it back.  As a matter of fact, it's somewhat of a relief there are 2 different Batman episodes so we don't have to watch the same one over and over again.

I had to edit this as my husband just called me at work and said he turned the DVD around - by accident I'm sure - and the Harlem Globetrotters was on the other side of the DVD.  I never heard of DVDs being 2-sided before.",1273449600,3,622,4.057377049180328
3876442,5,B002997SJ6,"if you are a fan of or love scooby doo then this dvd is for you, even if you are a fan of batman or the harlem globetrotters then you also need to purchase this dvd. if you are a fan of scooby, the globetrotters, or batman then is a good way to become familiar with the other charaters on this dvd. i went and purached these dvd's seperately on two different dvd's and scrached one of the dvd's and then i purchased this dvd to replace the scratched dvd. it is worth the money to purchase the two for one instead of purchasing two differnt dvd's. it is a good way to bring back childhood memories from when you were a child, and a good way to interduce your children to the charaters of scooby doo, batman and the harlem globetrotters.",1264291200,6,735,4.183098591549296
3876443,5,B002997SJ6,"i was kind of skeptical on buying this dvd since there were a few reviews saying it would only read one side and not the other, but as soon as i received it i tried both sides and they worked, I've had this dvd for about a month now and watched each side about 20 with not one problem. definitely recommend this dvd to anyone who misses watching the older scooby doo episodes",1397347200,,375,4.1506849315068495
3876444,4,B002997SJ6,"Most of the reviews I've seen state that the Harlem Globetrotters episodes are missing from side B of the disc. Mine plays fine on both sides, so I am guessing that this issue has been corrected.

As for the content - the Batman episodes have only English and Spanish spoken languages (packaging states French, but that is not the case), with English, Spanish and French subtitles. The Globetrotters episodes have spoken languages and subtitles in English, Spanish, French and Portuguese.

The description provided by Amazon is also misleading. These are from the 1972-1973 series (The New Scooby Doo Movies) and NOT newly made. A caveat for the purists - the Batman episodes do not have any musical opening sequence, only the title where Shaggy announces the guest star. The Globetrotters episodes have the musical opening sequence, but the visuals have been altered to cut out the numerous other guests that were in this season of Scooby-Doo such as The Addams Family, Batman, and yes, even the Harlem Globetrotters. These have also been released on The Best of the New Scooby-Doo Movies, so if you have that set you really don't need this one, unless you want the extra features, which aren't much.

On its own, the episodes look and sound great and it isn't a bad value at $5.",1389398400,,1280,4.835616438356165
3876445,3,B002997SJ6,"Loved the Batman episodes, but there was literally nothing on the flipside.  We were prepared for this from other reviews, but still hoped we'd get lucky and be able to access all the promised episodes.",1334966400,,202,4.771428571428571
3876446,1,B002997SJ6,"I ordered this item for my 5-year-old grandson and was very surprised to find out that only the Batman movie was viewable -- Globetrotters was not.  Also, I cannot return the item since it was provided by a third party (which I did not realize).  I'll be more careful in the future. Very disappointing.",1334534400,2,302,4.574074074074074
3876447,2,B002997SJ6,"So i read all the reviews and despite what people were saying I still ordered it hoping there was nothing wrong with the dvd and sure enough the harlem globetrotters episodes were missing,the back side would not play and its so frustrating buying something and having that feeling like your getting ripped off because your not getting what you payed for so people pay attention to the reviews",1332115200,,392,4.779411764705882
3876448,1,B002997SJ6,"Same deal as the other reviews, there is no Harlem Globtrotters Movie on the reverse side of the DVD (Side B).  Very disappointing as that is the only reason I ordered this DVD for my kids.  DO NOT ORDER THIS COMBO DVD!",1331769600,,219,4.190476190476191
3876449,2,B002997SJ6,"Ordered this for our grandson who loves Scooby Doo (and Batman).  I saw this combi-disc, and thought for about the price of the Scooby Doo Meets Batman disc, he'd get a second Scooby Doo adventure film to entertain him.

Sadly, we received a defective disc as the side B would not play in anything I tried it in.  According to my computer blu-ray drive, there are files on the side B, but nothing playable.

My two star rating is like this; 5 stars for Side A that plays great and 0 stars for Side B that doesn't - average and round down.

So, roll the dice and take your chances with this one.  You may get lucky and receive a fully playable combi-disc.  I've returned this and ordered two separate discs of each feature to be (hopefully) certain the two features play.  I don't want to roll the dice and come up snake-eyes a second time, when this was a Christmas for our visiting grandson.",1324857600,,892,4.363636363636363
3876450,1,B002997SJ6,"I bought this DVD for my son and as some of the other reviews say, only the Scooby Doo meets Batman side works.  The Harlem Globe Trotters side caused an error in all of my DVD players and wouldn't play.",1320883200,,203,4.075
3876451,2,B002997SJ6,"I bought this DVD for my son who likes Scooby & Batman, but I was looking forward to the Globetrotters episodes as well.  After reading one of the previous reviews that said those episodes were on the other side of the DVD, I turned it over only to get an error message that said ""Insufficient DVD.""  The DVD would only play right-side up with only the Batman episodes.  Obviously there is a defect with this particular DVD being mislabled as containing the Globetrotters episodes when it does not.  Try explaining to your 2 1/2 year old why he can't watch what you just told him you were going to let him watch.  Not fun.",1318032000,2,622,4.421052631578948
3876452,1,B002997SJ6,"I am very disappointed with this DVD.  Not only was the second movie NOT on the disc, but the description that there is a French language track is inaccurate.  That was the main reason for choosing this DVD.  My son is in a French immersion program and loves both Scooby Doo and Batman.  I was looking forward to having him watch two of his favorite characters in French to further expose him to the language. The only movie on this disc only has French subtitles.",1317254400,2,464,4.423529411764706
8357642,5,B002997SJ6,I've have these two movies before but since it's been a while I decided to order it & it's great. you get two movies for the price of one & if you're a Classic Scooby-Doo & Batman fan then you'll love this double feature. not to mention it has the Harlem Globetrotters on it.,1516752000,,275,4.111111111111111
