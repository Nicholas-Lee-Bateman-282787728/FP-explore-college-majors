I love Formula One. Sadly today's version of it is a far cry from the truly great eras and drivers that graced the sport throughout the years. Through the cleanly painted rear engined racing cigars of the 1960s, through the wingy ""pack of cigarettes"" monsters of the 1970s, and through the super-fat 1,000 HP turbo beasts of the 1980s the sport always seemed to know no bounds as cars got faster and faster and things more out of control in terms of cost going forward into the future. That is why those who love this sport and its history do so. The sheer madness of it all coupled with the competition spanning the globe vying for the title of Driver's Championship as country against country fight to produce the greatest chassis, the greatest engine, and the greatest driver all culminating in the epic soap opera of testosterone and oil. Sadly we are not all in the same boat when it comes to fandom of F1 in this country and the scarcity of F1 titles available on DVD is a direct result. So, we must be happy with the few options thrown our way and that is why I give 5 stars to this series of short 50 minute films covering the F1 seasons from 1970-1980. The picture quality is great as is the rare ability to see these classic cars we cherish at different angles. Quite a treat for F1 nuts. I've rewatched each film several times and they NEVER get old.",1379030400,,1548,4.450704225352113
8142525,2,B000HXE5QA,"I am extremely disappointed in this DVD.  The main reason I bought it was that I wanted a good clean copy of the famous battle between the late Gilles Villeneuve and Rene Arnoux at Dijon.  Considered by many as the greatest driver vs driver battle ever in F1 not one bit is shown during the French coverage even though you can get stacks of footage of this moment in various degrees of quality on the internet.

Here is a sample of what was left OFF the DVD:

[...]

To top that off they don't even show three Grand Prix from the season and the commentator constantly confuses drivers Laffite, Depallier, Arnoux, Jabouille, Lauda and Piquet.

On the positive side the footage that is shown is good quality, but come on!",1180656000,4,719,4.492307692307692
