There are so many faithful fans still out there & here, still following Angel's storyline in the comic books. It would be great to have all seasons in a blu ray collection and add some special features about the series.",1346544000,3,425,4.756756756756757

We own every season of both shows on DVD already, but we will not hesitate to replace them with BluRay if and when they come out.  Please please please hurry and get these amazing shows onto BluRay.  Give the fans what they want!!!!",1285545600,9,297,4.363636363636363
8269901,5,B0018KIKMQ,"PREACH, JDTOTH!!! We are on the same wavelength!!! How is it possible that Fox has completely over-looked Buffy and Angel for Firefly/Serenity and Dollhouse---not that they aren't great shows/movie, but, I wold LOVE to FINALLY watch these programs the way God intended...in blu-ray on my flat screen t.v.!!!",1284163200,6,307,5.416666666666667
8269902,5,B0018KIKMQ,"I know Buffy might take lots of work to get on Blu-ray but Angel is already in HD on Hulu Plus which obviously means it wouldn't be too tough.

Come on Fox, you don't have to load it with special features... I just want Angel in HD Blu-ray quality!",1282780800,8,248,4.061224489795919
