8219261,4,B000VKW6OW,"I write only as a viewer who watches dance only as an 'amateur'. My only live experience with it, aside from various forms  of  tap dancing and chorus lines, was a couple of years with season tickets to watch Balanchine. I was interested and entertained by the three dances performed for this disc. As one reviewer has  pointed out, one with the ""senior"" group whom he supervises is more a somewhat active skit than anything else, although the meaning is rather more clouded than were those we use to see on television's Bob Hope, Jack Benny, &etc. shows. The heart of the disc are the two others. The setting is pretty much like your average High School or College Gym in which a group of young men and women in their tightly fitted work suits (although some of the men and women have occasion to put on skirts) are going through series of intricate body movements at various speeds, from excruciatingly slow to lightning fast, both  alone and in intimate contact with another. There is none of the flowing grace of the traditional ballet, nor the costumes and scenery. What one does get to see are how almost inhumanly slim both sexes are and, for the bare chested men, how the skeletal structure of their chests and back are  part of the show. Kylian does try to enlighten the viewer as to his intentions in a brief interview accompanying each of the three pieces...one may, or likely, may not, see much relationship between his  words and the action on stage. I say these things so that viewers who still expect the customary context for ballet, the wonderful scenery and costume, the graceful flow of bodies, the interweaving of the dominant female with the subordinate male, save when he is given leave to turn incredible leaps about the stage, will know that they will not find them here. On the other hand, those who take a neutral stance toward variations in style, may well get the same pleasure as I did from observing the patterns of physical interaction and individual....contortion? Oh, yes, those interested, will find some confirmation of what I saw once on a film about an American ballet school associated with a major company....a very ambitious and apparently skilled dancer was shown being rejected from further study because she would never be successful with her  curvaceous body and clearly defined breasts. In the first ballet on the disc one can see for oneself some verification of the statement....although I have no idea whether the intervening years between then and now (and between the date of these performances and today) have altered the situation perceptibly. In brief then, these are not in the style that once dominated formal dance, if you want to stick with the wonderful work done in that manner, this is not for you. On the other hand, if you are open, even as a stranger (as am I) to some of the contemporary variations, these might well provide an enjoyable evening.",1446681600,,2910,4.75049504950495
8219262,5,B000VKW6OW,"I ordered from the wrong amazon site and had to pay another 15 euros in post and import tax.
So it was very expensive. ( I suffer with a man made brain virus, so I get stuff wrong.)Given to me free of course.
But the DVD is stunning. I am over the moon with it.
Really pleased I was able to get it.
The choreography is 1st class and beautiful.",1439424000,,343,3.914285714285714
8219263,5,B000VKW6OW,"While it is always better to see dance in a live performance, this is the next best thingl  Bella Figura was recently produced by the Boston Ballet and they did a wonderful job.  I've not seen Birthday live and is in Kylian's romp mode (clever choreography) and I've only seen Sleepless excerpts on YouTube, but having the DVD is fabulous to relive special moments you can't do at a live performance.",1360800000,3,400,4.619718309859155
8219264,5,B000VKW6OW,"Pocas veces se presenta la oportunidad de adquirir productos como este DVD. La grabaci&oacute;n es perfecta en todo sentido. La danza en s&iacute; es muy profesional pero sobre todo art&iacute;stica y logra comunicar los mensajes propuestos por el core&oacute;grafo. Recomiendo sobre todo a los estudiantes de danza tener este CD. Pienso que es una verdadera escuela.
Jiri Kylian es un artista incre&iacute;ble, gran creador y original.",1342396800,,436,5.621212121212121
8219265,5,B000VKW6OW,"Very nice DVD.

combines three pieces, one of each company of NDT. The principals dance Bella Figura, one of the most beautiful peaces of art i've ever seen. NDT3, formed by elder dansers above 40, dance a humoristic piece with more of performance than dance in it, ad NDT2, the young company that tends to explore new limits of contemporary/classical dance, dance sleepless, also a piece that shocks thanks to the language of Kylian.

The thee choreografies are very well accompanied by interviews with Kylian, that was a very nice surprise for me when i got the package.",1244419200,10,572,4.826530612244898
8219266,3,B000VKW6OW,"I purchased this DVD with great expectations. I love to watch dances, especially the ones choregraphed by Jilian, performed by NDT in particular. However, this DVD was a bit disappointing. I think the director was trying to do *too much*. There are way too frequent special effects and camera view point changes, which actually ruins the *essence* of dance, in my humble opinion. It wasn't bad, but just not as exciting as the other Jilian DVDs I purchased..",1203379200,26,458,4.884615384615385
8219267,5,B000VKW6OW,",,,WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO RELEASE ON DVD THAT KYLIAN PROGRAMME WHICH INCLUDED HAYDN'S SYMPHONY IN D, L'APRS-MIDI D'UN FAUNE, VERKLRTE NACHT AND STAMPING GROUND (WITH A PERCUSSION TOCCATA BY CHAVEZ OR REVUELTAS, I DON'T REMEMBER WHICH ONE)? THAT WAS GREAT FUN.",1194307200,6,259,5.190476190476191
