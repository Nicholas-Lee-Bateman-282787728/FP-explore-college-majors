2822466,3,B000PHX5PK,"I own the War of the Worlds stand alone release, but wanted When Worlds Collide, so I picked up this double feature disk.  Not only are the extras from the War of the Worlds release missing, but the film seems to have been remastered at a lower bitrate to fit it on a single dual-layer DVD along with When Worlds Collide.  I actually noticed a difference on my TV, so I popped the disks in the computer and confirmed it.  These are just the films with no extras at all.  My advice:  Order the single disk releases for better quality and extras at a relatively small price difference.",1187913600,68,583,4.361111111111111

2822480,4,B000PHX5PK,"Saw these in the theater years ago and the nostalgia of the type of Sci-Fi they represent made me re-enjoy them again.

2822481,5,B000PHX5PK,When worlds collide was the reason that I purchased this DVD.  When this movie was made it was way ahead of its time.  This movie is one of my fondest to watch.,1393632000,2,160,3.96875

I like sci fi movies and especially the classics
yes they can be cheesy but that's where you use your imagination, something I think we lack today.",1392681600,,192,4.361111111111111

2822496,4,B000PHX5PK,"Trying to collect George Pal productions.
I find that most of ""todays"" entertainment is lacking imagination or a moral compass. It's no wonder, once I viewed these films again, that they stood the test of time.",1377561600,,210,4.861111111111111
2822497,5,B000PHX5PK,This supplier furnished a perfect copy of this movie.  They represented the product perfectly.  I would order again from this individual if need be.,1372636800,,148,5.125
2822498,5,B000PHX5PK,I love the original movies sometimes better than the newer remakes.  Was very satisfied with the movies. thanks so much.,1372032000,,120,5.0
2822499,5,B000PHX5PK,"I saw this movie when I was a little girl and decided to share(forced) with my family.  They enjoyed this movie after watching it and we discussed the similarities between new movies and old movies.  We talked about the new movies borrowing a lot of ideas from old movies and how some new movies just don't pull off the ideas (that they borrowed) successfully.  The quality of this movie was great.  The special effects for that time was limited but still impressive.  Thank you for bringing back good memories to share with my family.  We are now waiting for the remake of ""When Worlds Collide"" to compare to the original.  The new ""War of the Worlds"" was not impressive at all.",1369958400,,679,4.56198347107438
2822500,5,B000PHX5PK,"I remember well when I was just 7 years old and this movie 'War of the Worlds' came out and my mother took me to see this movie while my dad was away in the Korean War. It was a most amazing and made an indelible impression on me to this very day. I even used this movie to develope a futuristic concept about the next possible generation of tanks  [...] which incorporates the attributes of the movie's alien machines that seem to be impervious to water obstacles, land mines & barriers and a protective buble shield against other enemy fire regardless of the caliber even from air attack. Just five of these highly mobile craft could take out any enemy or any current country's military including China & Russia. Imagine That? This movie is excellent if you play it on 3D equipment and both films in this double feature transfer's very well and brings a new dimension to like looking at the movie all over again For The First time.  I highly recommends both features.",1364169600,,969,4.5
2822501,5,B000PHX5PK,I have always enjoyed watching War of the Worlds and When Worlds Collide.  It is a  great product at a great price.,1360281600,,115,4.181818181818182
2822502,4,B000PHX5PK,I enjoy old science fiction movies from this era and these are two of the best. I would recommend them both.,1358812800,,108,4.190476190476191
2822503,5,B000PHX5PK,I got 2 great 2 movies on one disc. Both are classic and any remakes lack the great cast that these movies had.,1358726400,,111,3.869565217391304
2822504,5,B000PHX5PK,"New in the box, never played, great quality.  Swift service via USPS.  Good job!  The movie was restored so well that you could see the wires holding up the machines in War of the Worlds.  I believe there was more detail to the movie on the DVD than in the original picture.",1337558400,,274,4.211538461538462
2822505,4,B000PHX5PK,"2 George Pal movies on one disc. Cool, but no extras - except trailers - big deal. Where are the classic sci-fi expert commentaries and ""making of"" documentaries? C'mon Paramount!

I can't imagine anyone not already familiar with these films, liking them, especially anyone much under 50. War Of The Worlds was one of my very favorite films from childhood. It doesn't hold up very well, but remains a nostalgic favorite. When Worlds Collide, never excited me very much, but is worth a look now and then. Maybe the problem is, Pal was a master with the visual aspects of movies, but couldn't do humans and genuine emotion very well. The characters look human, but act like plastic imitations. They're probably as smooth as Barbie and Ken, underneath. Also, as amazing as the special effects were, they're stone age compared to what movie lovers get and expect these days.

If you know you want these movies, why don't you already have them? If you're not sure, rent them first.",1320364800,,976,4.769230769230769
2822516,3,B000PHX5PK,"As a kid, I loved listening to Orson Wells' infamous Halloween broadcast.  I could not resist the chance to pick up this film.  It's sure not the highest-budget film ever made, but is exciting to watch as the eventual demise of the Martians is well-known to anyone who ever heard, read or viewed any version of this classic tale.",1278460800,,329,4.559322033898305
2822517,5,B000PHX5PK,"I seen these 2 movies many years ago on T.V

 Since then I lost all & most of the tapes I had & plus they were all stretched & useless. I bought these & loved them both. Two of my favs in the one case! Well done Amazon!! I'm still after another DVD called Medusa's Child which is hard to find & if Amazon is able to find me a copy or some one else is I love to buy it!! Again these 2 here are great if you like this sort of story lines,not seen the remake of War of the World BUT nothing matches the original with Gene Barry true to life scenes.",1277164800,,545,3.7304347826086954
2822518,5,B000PHX5PK,"Excellent for a rainy Saturday afternoon, with warm cookies and cold milk.

Worth putting in your DVD collection.",1265932800,,113,5.277777777777778
2822519,5,B000PHX5PK,"""War Of The Worlds"": 1954. This interpretation of H.G. Wells' novel is the best one. George Pal's production and Byron Haskin's direction created a really interesting and exciting film. Gene Barry is terrific as is Ann Robinson. Many films of that time would promote certain new technologies by putting them in the film. They would need the miltary's cooperation in some way and the military would want something in return so the newest plane or other military wonder would be made a part of the film. This film's military wonder was the ill-fated B-49 ""Flying Wing"" which drops an ""atomic"" bomb on the ""Martians"" who have invaded southern Califonia. Why they chose to invade southern California I have no idea unless they were looking to get into the movies. If that's the case they went about it all wrong. Blowing up everything! That puts people off. But of course the humans can't beat the ""Martians"" (nobody ever proves they are from Mars, it's just assumed). So it's time for nature to take over and ""the littlest things"" - the bacteria that we have long ago become immune to - start killing off the Martians. There is, of course, a religious message at the end (this was the 1950's after all) and God saves the day! It must be noted that almost every Sci-Fi film of that era had something to do with the ""atomic"" bomb and UFOs! Little green men (and women too) were always about to come and attack and conquer the human race.
FUN, FUN, FUN! Till they take the ray gun away!",1264204800,,1480,4.588679245283019
2822520,4,B000PHX5PK,"Old science fiction, a nice double feature for the fiction buff, War of the worlds is a totally different concept from modern fiction thrillers, no blood guts and carnage - chivalry of another age gone past.
worth checking out.",1257984000,,227,4.846153846153846
2822521,3,B000PHX5PK,"I picked this up recently because it offered 2 Sci-fi ""classics"" for just a little more than the price of one.  Also, this was my first tme to see ""When Worlds Collide.""  Referring to the latter, what a bore!  Wooden acting, from mostly unknowns, and lack of any excitement or development to the story.  I could hardly sit through it.  Its hard to believe it averages a 4-star rating.  The story idea is good and the transfer quality is good, but thats about it.  Of course ""War of the Worlds"" is a great film in all respects but I agree with another reviewer that it is best purchased separately to get the other perks.",1249603200,,620,4.385964912280702
2822522,5,B000PHX5PK,Both my husband and myself thought that the double movies  both were well done. The movie arrived on time and in excellent condition. I was happy with the movie and the arrival time. We would reccommend this movie for sale or rent! The movies were very well done ! The picture and colour were excellent!! Thanks,1240012800,,311,4.553571428571429

2822524,4,B000PHX5PK,"If you enjoy fun, entertaining and visually satisfying science fiction, then this combo is no disappointment. Cream of the crop 1950's movies here. There's a lot of effort in the visuals in these films. And these films don't need gore to hold your attention. Most everyone over 40 years old knows these films and appreciate the quality of workmanship for the time they were produced. Every member of the family can enjoy these classics. The price for this combo is reasonable in my opinion. I can finally retired my VHS versions.",1212364800,7,529,4.824175824175824
2822525,5,B000PHX5PK,Two of the greatest classic Sci-Fi movies ever done - on one DVD.  Best special effects for their time.  Great story line.  I loved them,1211155200,4,136,4.36
8191493,5,B000PHX5PK,"My favorite science fiction is from about the 1950's.  I believe both of these movies have been updated.  I personally prefer these.  They are without the ""spectacular"" effects but I find they present  a more interesting narrative with more depth.",1515974400,,247,5.1

8191496,5,B000PHX5PK,"More classic Science Fiction. In ""When Worlds Collide"", I do miss the ethnic diversity you'd see in a more modern movie, but that aside it's another showing of human nature both good and bad along with the struggle for survival. In ""War of the Worlds"", you'll see, once again, the dramatic struggle for survival against the unknown. However, there is the cliche of the helpless woman only being able to be saved by the gorgeous leading man & the always evil/bad aliens, but again if you consider the times the movie was made (homemakers & the cold war) and take it for what it was meant to be for the times, it's still an enjoying movie.",1423872000,,637,4.5
8191497,5,B000PHX5PK,"The first movie of War of the Worlds and I think the best!!!  I love the storyline and how in the end, the Martians can't survive our germs!!!  Of course this is only fiction, but probably some truth too!!  Who outside of us can possibly survive our germs!!!  And another great sci-fi When Worlds Collide is added to  this two-in-one DVD!!!",1422489600,,340,4.508196721311475

8191499,5,B000PHX5PK,Had read the books a long time ago and went to the old movie house when they came out on the screen and had always wanted to own each one.  This made it so much easy for me!  Thanks for having this!,1420761600,,198,3.6904761904761907
8191500,5,B000PHX5PK,"None of the later remakes have equaled this version of ""War of the Worlds"". ""When Worlds Collide"" is not that well known but it is quite good for early space travel fiction, more imaginative than ""Destination Moon"". Pause and study the final scene when they are looking at the landscape from the door of the spaceship. The painting is a fine piece of space art and includes many artifacts.",1419465600,,389,4.6521739130434785
