8616736,4,B00FLV00NK,"This movie is pretty good and gives us look at police brutality and how far the Zoo Crew would go to bring this to light even though they were breaking the law themselves. This movie also had a great cast, including Treach who is one of my favorites (as an artist and actor). It was good to see him playing a different kind of character. I also like that this movie was also pretty realistic. It was a true story but we all know that even movies based on a true story are exaggerated quite a bit. A must see!",1420070400,,508,4.09

8616738,3,B00FLV00NK,"This film is based on the story of Terrance ""Mustaffa"" Dent (Jermaine 'Huggy' Hopkins). Dent started out in Newark dealing drugs in his apartment building. He then forcefully took over another neighborhood and eventually build a Capone crime empire using legitimate businesses. They would move large amounts of drugs by staging funerals while cleaning and dressing up the homeless.

After a pregnant woman got shot by the police, the city was divided, something the mayor didn't need in an election year. The Feds came in and took control, arresting the Zoo Crew.

A one point Dent claims it is not about the money, but respect. He objects to how black people are treated by the police (many of which are also black.) I found his words to be ironical, and at some point during the film, the grinch looks at kids playing in the streets littered with his unique yellow drug containers. Dent wants out, but the Zoo wants to stay intact.

I found the film to be interesting as a docudrama. It fails as an action film as the production was more about budget and the South Park message, ""drugs are bad, okay.""  Oddly, after seeing this film,  it made me feel unwarranted ""search and frisk"" in targeted areas would lead to a safer city.
