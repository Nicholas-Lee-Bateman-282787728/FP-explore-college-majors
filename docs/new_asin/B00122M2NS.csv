8243605,5,B00122M2NS,This is a great learning dvd for above average players. I learned allot from Stuart and the backing track is fun to play along to as well. Very well explained and thought out.,1218326400,,175,4.333333333333333
8243606,5,B00122M2NS,"This is a fantastic DVD. Be aware it is NOT for the beginner, and has NO tab. Regardless, I feel this is an excellent lesson packed with great useful licks and quality instruction. Stuart Bull does an admirable job of capturing Larry's style utilizing the changes and feel of Carlton's ""BP Blues"" from the ""Last Night"" CD. The ""QUICK LICKS"" DVD's are great tools for the advancing guitarist. I also HIGHLY recommend the Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page style DVD's as well. I am looking forward to additional titles in the future. A+!",1216425600,,526,4.666666666666667
8243607,4,B00122M2NS,"Stuart Bull:  I recently learned of Stuart Bull guitar series although I am sure of the other instructional DVDs.  But my all time favorite guitarist is Larry Carlton and his award winning slow blues/jazz style.  Stuart uses one of Larry's songs named ""The B.P. Blues"" so called in admiration for the California club where regularly performed during the late `80s--The Baked Potato.  Bull's division of instruction is just right for those of us who are interested in this style of expression.  There is also a backing track included to put learned sections to full use.  Of course, there are some riffs that only Larry does that are his own signature.  But the goal in guitar playing is to develop one's own style and not note-by-note copying.  As a performing artist, it is fun to see the audience responding to your admiration of a well known, Grammy award winning guitarist.  Have fun.",1212451200,2,888,4.827814569536423
