7816656,5,6301928261,I thought this was a great movie. I watched it over and over again. All the actors did a splended job of acting. Lou Diamond Phillips is one of my favorite actors. There really are caring people of there like in the movie.,1297036800,,222,4.186046511627907
7816657,3,6301928261,"If Lou Diamond Phillips wasn't in this movie it would be entirely lacking in substance. He brings a feeling of depth to a otherwise sickly sweet story of young love, anguish and charity. With few moments of credibility  this movie may raise your spirits but little else.",938822400,3,270,4.74468085106383
