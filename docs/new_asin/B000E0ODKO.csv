8103179,5,B000E0ODKO,"Great little set of TV classics. I'm not old enough to remember these when they were airing on TV, so they were all new to me and my family. Even my teenage sons enjoyed them. Wholesome, funny, and fun and worth every penny. I highly recommend this set!",1438300800,,253,4.291666666666667
8103180,5,B000E0ODKO,"I don't understand why so many people find an unobtrusive, transparent logo so annoying. I have several Echo Bridge/Platinum Disc sets, and I seldom, if ever, even notice this. Beyond this, the shows on this disc are funny and well worth the money. This set gives you one more Our Miss Brooks episode than the other sets out there. This show is still owned by CBS and the episodes here are those that have slipped into the public domain. Supposedly CBS has remastered season one into hi-def for new syndication, but whether the show gets put on an official DVD remains to be seen. The Love That Bob episodes are good, but be sure to watch the last episode first as it is the first of a two-part story which is continued with episode 2 on the disc.",1411948800,6,747,4.420289855072464
8103181,5,B000E0ODKO,I like the old shows. Worked really great. Was in good condition. Came to the house in timely manner. We all like the old shows so my other family members will enjoy it too.,1334016000,3,173,4.117647058823529
8103182,3,B000E0ODKO,"This is volume 1 of 2 and both were originally released by Platinum Disc Corporation which was purchased by Echo Bridge. However, all episodes on both discs contain an intrusive and distracting Platinum Disc logo in the lower right corner. You can find these episodes from other distributors such as Critic's Choice and even if they are slightly more expensive, are worth the extra money.",1217203200,28,388,4.984615384615385
