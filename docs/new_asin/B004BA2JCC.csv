8421782,3,B004BA2JCC,"My wife LOVES, LOVES, LOVES the yoga DVD. (But not the music so much.)  Not so crazy about the other twoDVDs.  One reason is that there are no options except the one hour program on the cardio dance DVD.  The Pilates one has one long and one short work out and it is okay.  The biggest issue for her is that she is just a yoga fan so the other two are just not at interesting.",1412035200,,376,3.9078947368421053
