2157669,1,B00061UHYW,"To many, this version of B&B is a carbon copy of the famed French version of Beauty and the Beast. The french film had stunning visuals, breathaking cast members, and a superb script. However, when the Writers of this series decided to base this adaptation of B&B on the French version, they didn't carry anything over.

The Visuals are dark and dreary, and don't make one interested in the film. Which is a shame really, because how are little one's supposed to be interested in this? Children need big songs and flashy colors to keep entertainted, which was why the Disney version did so well. All the colors here are muted, giving off an almost Gothic look too it. Not a good idea for kids. The costumes are pretty, and for 'older' kids this might be good...

The Acting is lackluster to say the least. Susan Sarandon as Beauty was a very odd choice; as she looks much to old for the part. Her acting is bland, and Susan looks very bored thru the movie. Klaus Kinski plays the Beast, and does what he can with part. Which isn't much with the limited script. Angelica Huston plays one of the mean sisters, and steals the show from both of the 'stars.'

As I said in the title; this movie is very disturbing. You see, one thing the Writers DID carry over from the almost adult French version was the fact that the Beast burns himself. Yes, Burns. It was alright for the French version, but does not belong in a kids adaptation. One night, Beauty is asleep in her bed, when she hears screaming of sorts. As she climbs out of bed, she see's the Beast on her balcony, covered in blood and smoking. Terribly frightning music plays here as the Beast screechs for Beauty to close the curtain to the balcony. It happens one more time as Beauty walks down the hall as the Beast screams, where she sees him walking down the hallway with his hands smoking.

These things don't belong in a kids adaptation. As a child I was unnevered by these scenes, and couldn't bear to watch this film. As I got older, these scenes suddenly became 'cool' as I entered the phase where everything violent seems cool.

Stick with the animted Disney version of Beauty and the Beast. If you do show this version, stick with the older kids.",1214006400,2,2210,4.46039603960396
2157670,4,B00061UHYW,"FAERIE TALE THEATRE's production of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST makes for dazzling family entertainment, with strong performances from lead actors Susan Sarandon and Klaus Kinski in the title roles.

Beauty's merchant father steals a white rose from the castle of the Beast (Klaus Kinski).  As punishment, the Beast orders that the merchant return to the castle in 3 days, or else one of his daughters must go in his place.  Youngest daughter Beauty (Susan Sarandon) selflessly sacrifices her own freedom to release her father.

Once in the castle, Beauty slowly begins to win the friendship and trust of the Beast, who hides a gentle and kind heart beneath his frightening exterior.

Directed by Roger Vadim and co-starring Anjelica Huston and Nancy Lenehan as Beauty's jealous sisters, this version of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is based on Jean Cocteau's celebrated French movie classic.  Highly-recommended.",1098662400,10,898,5.244755244755245
2157671,3,B00061UHYW,"Faerie Tale Theatre has produced some odd episodes over the years, but none more so than this disturbing revisioning of Jean Cocteau's film classic as directed by, um, Roger Vadim. Vadim is best known as the director of visually stylish but empty-headed films like Barbarella and ...And God Created Women. It goes without saying that this is an attractive episode, perhaps one of the most beautifully realized in the series. Vadim has borrowed many of Cocteau's gothic flourishes, and the sets and costumes (especially the look of the Beast) are straight out of that version. However, for all of its visual power, this is an underwhelming adaptation. Klaus Kinski as the Beast is inspired casting, and he lends the part a solemn gravity. Susan Sarandon, on the other hand, seems to be channeling Catherine Deneuve here. She's more Belle De Jour than Beauty, all frigid detachment and blank expression. This makes her final declaration of love for the Beast completely unconvincing. The fault lies just as much in a script that never fully develops either character or their relationship. The Beast remains pitiable and elusive to the last, and it's little wonder Beauty never seems to see him as anything more than a creature. The plot meanders, and Vadim lifts moments from Cocteau's version that, taken out of context, are more confusing than inspired. In the end, however, perhaps this should be enjoyed simply for the atmosphere Vadim has created, no small feat in a television production of this scope.",1063756800,6,1507,5.032
2157672,4,B00061UHYW,"As a child, I loved watching Faerie Tale theatre movies.  I never watched this movie until I bought it.  I have a goal of getting all of Faerie Tale Theatre's collection.  Susan Saradon is a wonderful actress espcecially in her performance of Beauty and the Beast.  I recommend watching more of this collection",1044576000,3,310,4.7924528301886795

8036581,5,B00061UHYW,"When I saw this version for the first time with Susan Sarandon and Klaus Kinski I was immediately, deeply touched by their strong, moving performances as Beauty and Beast. Though Sarandon is nowhere as beautiful as French actress, Josette Day, I must admit that she was perfectly cast for the part and made you feel with her with every moment of her performance as Beauty. Klaus Kinski gave a terrific,powerful performance as the Beast. Though nowhere as stunning as Jean Marais, this guy has powerful talent to pull of this role. I was in awe by both  Sarandon's and Kinski's performances in this movie. The action moves pretty fast since it is only a less than an hour flick but it is really worthwhile to watch and buy if you like both the story and these two fine actors.",1283817600,,775,4.575539568345324

Faerie Tale Theatre's adaptation of the classic French story ""Beauty and the Beast"" stands apart from even the best entries in the venerable series.  Starring Susan Sarandon, Klaus Kinski, and even including Anjelica Huston in a small role, it is the one episode in the series that boasts a truly filmic appearance.

Directed by Roger Vadim, it features a fairly dark and mature tone.  Additionally, Klaus Kinski's Beast can be genuinely frightening, especially for younger viewers.  Tremendously ugly and with a nearly continuous low growl, he is fearlessly presented as the complete physical antithesis to Susan Sarandon's Beauty.  Ms. Sarandon brings her considerable acting talents to bear in a versatile and sympathetic performance.

Faerie Tale Theatre's adaptation of ""Beauty and the Beast"" is easily one of the best episodes of the series.",1270252800,,864,5.402985074626866
8036583,5,B00061UHYW,"I originally had this episode of Faerie Tale Theatre on videotape and always thought that it was totally awesome.  There are a lot of elements in this production that are borrowed from the Cocteau version ""La Belle et Le Bete"".  The background of the Beast's castle are not as dark as in the Cocteau version.  There is a lighter look to this version.  Susan Sarandon and Klaus Kinski are very good together in this production.  I would highly recommend it.",1257292800,2,456,4.65
8036584,5,B00061UHYW,"Klaus Kinski and Susan Sarandon star in this wonderful Faerie Tale Theatre classic tale. Sarandon, although seemingly a bit nervous at times, made a truly lovely Beauty. Kinski was just absolutely perfect for the role of Beast not only because of his animalistic temperament calmed only by his gentle longing for love, but also simply because of his look. The intensity of his eyes coupled with the gentleness of his voice was magnificent! And when he revealed himself at the end, we could all enjoy his sweet disposition and beautiful smile! Never again would we see Kinski in this kind of role, so it is a treasure!
