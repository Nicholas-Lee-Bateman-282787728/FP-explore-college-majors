8540368,5,B009DMF7OK,"Great general knowledge that is worth knowing. The health industry is just that-an INDUSTRY. It no longer cures it just seeks to maintain everyone on drugs and keep operating on their wallets. So, what do you do? Self-educate with honest physicians such as Dr. Klaper. Very informative DVD.",1507334400,,290,5.0625
8540369,2,B009DMF7OK,"If you're looking for an old school lecture to fall asleep to, then this is the DVD for you.
This should be a book to use as a reference, not a DVD.",1501027200,,148,3.65625
8540370,5,B009DMF7OK,"Everyone should buy this dvd.

Dr. Klaper is a health god...really.",1497139200,,67,5.090909090909091
8540371,4,B009DMF7OK,"I am a huge fan for Dr. Klapper's life's work.  This goes over the very basic blood labs and the value is exceptional.  But to get 5-stars, it should list the top ten dietary diseases, and if you have those health issues, these are the additional labs that need to be run and how to interpret them.  I sincerely hope Dr. Klapper does a follow on DVD to pick up where this one left off.",1496707200,,385,4.1066666666666665
8540372,5,B009DMF7OK,Lots of excellent information.  He has the ability to take a complex subject and make it both interesting and informative.  Would highly recommend!!,1388620800,5,148,5.391304347826087
8540373,5,B009DMF7OK,"Dr. klapper has done a fabulous job of explaining what the results of all the different tests that your doctor orders for you actually mean!  This video is definitely my ""aha"" moment.",1380067200,6,183,4.71875
8540374,4,B009DMF7OK,"Tons of valuable information. Tells me all about the results of the tests my dr. ordered but did not have the time to go over with me.
Only drawback was the introduction screen. Had to click the little  yellow bar in the middle to get started. It should have a word with it like, umm.. I don't know...How about,""play"".  Just a thought.
Overall, it was well worth the price for me.",1361664000,10,380,4.338028169014085
8540375,3,B009DMF7OK,"This is a well done effort to explain how to interpret blood tests, which I would rate as a 5. Unfortunately, there is no index, much less a clickable index, resulting in a disc which can't be conveniently used for reference. This severely limits the usefulness of an otherwise good product.",1356480000,12,291,4.7254901960784315
