7603545,5,B01AJV0CSE,"This movie had depth, insight, and twists. More character driven than action driven, which I enjoy...more psychological. And, unlike Mildred Pierce, it has a great ending. Though, I didn't watch it by buying it through Amazon, but watching the British version through the Showbox app. They don't sell the British version through Amazon...why is that??",1469923200,4,351,5.4

7603549,3,B01AJV0CSE,"This film has that element of Australian comedy where it covers some rather dark themes but makes you feel like you are watching a quirky, lighthearted movie. Well, it is quirky, at least. Winslet's character was chased out of her podunk town as a girl and comes back as an accomplished woman wanting to clear her name, reunite with her mother, and piss off her enemies by absolutely slaying it in her sexy, self-made wardrobe. Winslet is a bit older than the other actors playing her contemporaries, but who cares, she's never looked better. Liam Hemsworth does a good job as her love interest and actually does most of the work generating chemistry between them (he reminds me of a young Jeff Bridges). Judy Davis is hilarious as the mother--the acting is great all around. At first things go well for the heroine (of course), but then they go very awry. The plot takes a tragic turn halfway that felt out of line to me (I'm sure it served the novel better) and then the second act just goes off the rails. It wasn't the feelgood movie I was expecting; however, one that is still worth a look.",1465257600,3,1095,4.5353535353535355
7603550,4,B01AJV0CSE,Absolutely loved it! There was only one part that really made me angry and you'll know it when you see it. Such a sweet cute story about righting old wrongs and reconnecting with the past.,1464566400,4,188,4.4
7603551,3,B01AJV0CSE,"Remember how cartoon eyes would literally pop out of heads every time Jessica Rabbit would walk into a room in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" The effect is much the same when Tilly Dunnage (Kate Winslet) confidently strides into the tiny, rundown Australia town of Dungatar, decked out in a blazing red dress hugged tight in all the right places (very Jessica Rabbit-esque). The young men on the rugby team can't concentrate enough to score, but the women of the town can't take their eyes off of her for a different reason. See, Tilly left the town years ago after being accused of murder, and her return can only mean trouble.

Jocelyn Moorhouse's revenge comedy ""The Dressmaker"" kicked off Filmfest DC's 30th anniversary, and fittingly it's one of the more acclaimed Opening Night films the festival has ever had, nominated for 13 of Australia's AACTA awards and winning 5. And for much of the film it's deserving of those honors as Moorhouse and her husband/screenwriter P.J. Hogan nimbly maneuver through the wildly shifting tones with a flourish that Tilly would adore. The first half of the film is completely nuts, introducing the town's insane residents and setting up a plethora of seemingly lightweight conflicts for Tilly to face. Nobody is on her side, it seems, not even her mother Molly (Judy Davis) who has gone a bit demented over the years living on her own. She doesn't even recognize her own daughter, much less remembers anything of the past or that tragic day when Tilly was taken away. But Molly, like her daughter, is a firecracker with a serious hate for the town's stick-up-the-butt residents. She gets her kicks whacking golf balls at their homes, or directly at their heads.

But not everyone is terrified of Tilly's return. There's Liam Hemsworth as handsome, rugged love interest, Teddy; and Hugo Weaving as the flamboyant, closeted cop, Sgt. Farrat, who is so smitten by all of Tilly's fancy Parisian garments he can barely keep his hands off of them. They comprise all of the support Tilly can muster against the town's philandering councilor, Evan Pettyman (Shane Bourne); his unhinged wife, Marigold (Alison Whyte), who has been sheltered ever since the day Tilly supposedly killed her son. There's also the town doctor who turns out to be a hunchbacked religious fanatic; the vindictive schoolteacher (Kerry Fox) who has hated Tilly since she was a child; and a number of women who just don't like that Tilly's back and catching the eye of all of the eligible men. What unfolds is a madcap Down Under murder mystery, only with a much better fashion sense.

Tilly wants revenge against those who wronged her, but her plot takes a detour after she sews a gorgeous dress for the homely Gertrude (played by the beautiful Sarah Snook) and turns her into the most breath-taking woman in town. The other women soon are beating down Tilly's door for dresses of their own, seemingly willing to forgive and forget the past. The reconciliation doesn't last long, though, and soon they are back to making her life a living Hell. If it sounds like a lot is going on, that's because it is. For a while the film actually benefits from the manic pacing, abundance of characters, and crisscrossing subplots; think ""Muriel's Wedding"" which Hogan also wrote. But the second half of the film is entirely grim and what seemed like a virtue before becomes a crushing burden. People start dying, romances are shattered, and yet more storylines are piled on, such as a town play that turns into a fashion competition, totally out of the blue. As the story struggles to wrap up each individual storyline, and try it certainly does, the formerly fast-paced film gets stuck in the mud.

The only thing that keeps the final act mildly enjoyable is the cast, with Winslet as sexy, devious, and funny as she's ever been. She pairs up perfectly with Davis, who balances Molly's quirks with a maternal instinct that pays dividends later. Weaving is hilarious as the couture-obsessed cop, while Hemsworth is surprisingly steamy when sharing scenes with Winslet. Ultimately, the cast is the only winning ensemble ""The Dressmaker"" needs, even if it won't suit everybody.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dressmaker/dp/B01BA1UGRO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dressmaker</a>",1463788800,25,4316,5.074647887323944
7603552,5,B01AJV0CSE,"This is a dark grim social comment on a parochial, narcissistic rural 1950s Victorian town. The film is a good representation of the novel; however, it deviates on a number of points. Its exaggerated farce and dark humour is more dramatized than that of the novel. Kate Winslet, steals the show as stunning, glamourous and enigmatic, Tilly, who has made a success of her life, but returns to her hometown. Despite Tilly returning as an accomplished dressmaker, unrecognisable and sophisticated most of the town treats her with suspicion, derision and continues to circulate malicious gossip. The audience eventually learns about her terrible secret and reason for the towns distrust of her. Other peoples secrets from the past haunt and hunt Tilly as they simmer beneath the surface and are omnipresent revealing flashes of her past. The film at times is very graphic often caricaturing small town nastiness and tastelessness. Initially, Tilly is resented and treated as a curiosity, but as her talent as a dressmaker is revealed she wins the approval of some becoming the towns celebrity. However, this is short lived. Ultimately, this is a revenge tale and a story that celebrates the outsider. Although the ending satisfies its bitter sweet reminding the audience that The Dressmaker is essentially a dark Gothic tale with touches of romance. Director Jocelyn Moorhead produces a dramatic film which is both a realistic portrayal, but also surreal and otherworldly in style reminiscent of Tim Burtons, Edward Scissorhands. The contrast between dark humour and imagery is enhanced by the intense colour splashed from scene to scene highlighting the stark contrast of the brooding darkness that permeates the story. Judy Davis as Tillys mother is extraordinary. Her eccentricity is raw and endearing.",1455926400,37,1801,5.2787456445993035

7603554,1,B01AJV0CSE,"Despite some terrific ""performances,"" notably by Judy Davis, this movie has two HORRIBLE flaws:
(1)  It is a bait-and-switch, where partway through, what might have been a movie about HUMANS, decides instead to focus solely on their damage, resulting depravity and shallow revenge.
(2)  Despite being very ""imaginative"" (i.e., huge DARK ""detail"" of shooting site and costuming), its message is one of total resignation to hopelessness.  The screenwriter(s) need serious emotional (and spiritual) ""therapy.""  They are very unhappy campers and wish us to join right in! No character in this ""sneaky"" movie has one iota of inner spiritual belief or even, a life of the mind.  They think their ""misery"" IS ""life.""
So, unless you like being gratuitously depressed, avoid this downer of a flick.  (Liam Hemsworth is incredibly ""pretty"" and uplifting, that part of the sick bait-and-switch.)",1536796800,,884,5.369565217391305

On many occasions it's laugh out loud funny, and on other occasions it may cause you to tear up.  Kate Winslet is inspiring beautiful and her acting is exceptional as ever.  I have only seen Sarah Snook in a few films and had no idea that she was so hilarious.  I had to rewind some of her scenes because they were just that entertaining.  If you enjoyed Mean Girls of Devil Wears Prada, you may enjoy this film.

The acting was Superb.  The couture- impeccable.  But it's based in a morbidly depressing desert town around a dark and slimy cloud of slimy, immoral folks who will throw anyone under the bus at any given time.
 The payoff, I *thought* was the exquisite love the two protagonists have... and simply how lovely these two characters-- and actors are.  You finally get a bit of Relief from all the darkness and think Yay!  there's finally a Payoff for enduring all this bleakness... and I am one to Bitterly safeguard movies' secrets.. unless they do something as hideous as a Sucker Punch.  Then all bets are off.  It is NOT a happy ending-- it is even worse than before and now I can't get that time back in my life.  The only payoff is being able to look at Liam Hemsworth and get clearer on the kind of guy I want in my life.

At the least you will find yourself smirking a time or two at the biting portrayal of small-minded provincial people from the 1950's. Possibly tearing up once or twice as well as the story progresses. If you are looking for a sweet story or a happy ending though then do as the mother in the story recommends and ""run away"". But if the idea of a somewhat twisted cross between The Devil Wears Prada, Nanny McPhee and Unforgiven with some Q. Tarantino thrown in for kicks intrigues, then by all means...have a seat and smirk away.",1533254400,,595,4.458715596330276

The viewer was led through the story with intrigue and interest as it unfolded.  I can tell how good a movie is by how often I look at the clock while I'm watching it, and I diddn't check once during this film.  It was so captivating!

The only reason I even gave it 2 stars is for the acting---the performances are great. The movie started off on a terrific note---a woman returns to her town to address an accusation and a bitter history. She is a skilled dressmaker and changes the very fabric of the small town with her designing skills, winning people over with her ability to transform their appearance. You think it is moving towards a happy and dramatic climax where her name is cleared and everyone lives happily ever after. But no. Tragedies are overrated in Hollywood. You don't have to make a tragedy for it to be critically acclaimed. You can have a happy ending with a well-made film. I was hoping for a good love story and ended up disappointed. It pretty much ruined my mood for the weekend.",1532217600,3,883,4.525

The outspoken crazy old mother, the tormented dressmaker, and her beau, and the eccentric policeman all did a bang up job. But the turn of events went from bad to worse starting with the wedding, which gave a glimmer of hope and then smashed it all to hell. It just never got better. A fairy tale gone awry!

Winslet does a lot more than transform the wardrobes of the women and fall in love. Its honestly a disturbing movie with little redemption and a lot of tragedy.

7603725,5,B01AJV0CSE,"Kate Winslet stars as Tilly a dressmaker returning to her mother after many years after being forced to leave for something she cannot remember. The rest of the cast did an amazing job my favorite was the police officer with a love for fashion. An interesting array of characters in a movie that starts off as an almost coming home quirky comedy. That later turns out to be a poor guess on this movie that throws you through many emotions as you feel Tilly trying her best to regain her memories of what actually happened such as ""Did she murder someone?"". It has a lot of build to it and I as an audience got very intrigued and really wanted to know. It is not the stereotypical movie because I kept wondering what it was going to throw at me next and could never imagine a lot of what happened. I think it was a remarkable movie and took me by surprise when it was far from a quirky comedy. Be prepared to get an emotional gut punch but it will be worth it to just witness Tilly at work trying to just deal with whatever gets thrown at her.",1529971200,,1042,4.215

Kate Winslet plays 'Tilly Dunnage,' a genius dressmaker who's been living in Paris, but who returns home to her deadbeat middle-of-nowhere dusty Australian home to reconnect with her mother, recover the truth about her past, and possibly, settle a score. This film is a gem with some of Australia's best actors at the top of their game; Judy Davis and Hugo Weaving especially. I was riveted from start to finish. Beautifully directed by Jocelyn Moorhouse, who was also a producer on ""Muriel's Wedding,"" another gem of an Australian film. Highly recommend. Set in Australia.

The first three quarters was entertaining, and hence the three stars.  The lover dying abruptly begs pondering whether the script could have been written better / differently.. I sure think it could have been better.  Besides, burning down the town out of all of her bitterness, was an act of utter violence.

It reminded me a bit of the movie Legends of the Fall, where you didn't think it could get any sadder in the plot, and yet it did. Im not sure revenge as much as the natural consequences of one's actions are what really played out in this story.

7603804,5,B01AJV0CSE,"This movie, man. This effing movie. I was honestly surprised by how much I loved this movie by the end. At first, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it. I'm more or a fast paced suspense/adventure fan than I am of movies like this that sort of gently pull you into the story at first.

There were multiple times throughout the movie where I thought ""Oh, so this is what kind of movie this is going to be,"" only to be totally thrown off by the next sequence of events that redefined things for me.

I'm a sucker for any sort of emotional drama driven by family relationships, and that's what really sucked me into this movie. Because at it's heart it's about a daughter and mother working through some really painful events that drove them apart in their past.

This movie was darkly humorous in some ways, but had so much actual soul to it, and was surprisingly hopeful and optimistic even as it cast light on some of our darker, more selfish tendencies as people.

But my favorite thing about this movie is a bit spoilerish, so you might want to skip this last paragraph if you don't want to have this great movie ruined for you. The ending was so dang glorious, and amazing, and was the best payoff ever. I have never been so pumped about arson in my life.

The black and white flashbacks promised an edgy film but it soon became clear that instead of characters, everybody in town would be An Eccentric right from the get-go. Hey kids, let's show each and every townsperson in his/her full glory as an Eccentric with Quirky Habits as a shortcut for establishing personality. Instant laffs!

Even though by then I was bored with it, and its whole schtick, cute Liam Hemsworth was working for me and the outfits were cool. But the story was just so uneven and cloying and all over the place with emotionally nonsensical ups and downs and lame, pointlessly upsetting or yawn-inducing ""surprises.""

About the time you are starting to think it is worth your time after all, and it is about to wrap up, it all falls to pieces. It becomes unbelievable, sick, and twisted. Hated it! The trailer makes it sound like it will be funny and entertaining, but it is dark and depressing. It is amazing to me that anyone would think this is a good movie. Amazing that anyone would be willing to act in it, direct it, or produce such a movie.",1524268800,,521,4.22

I did check out the ratings on Common Sense Media before watching it with her. I agree with users in that it may be more relatable for women but can't say that men won't enjoy it.,1524268800,,357,4.188405797101449

Revenge can be sweet as they say and Ainsley pulls it off superbly; her mom pulls up the rear. In a way The Dressmaker reminded me a little bit of Fargo. Dry, Funny, Serious, Quirky, Sad, Eyebrow-lifting, and Tragic all at the same time.  I love the setting too ...

Her talent as a dressmaker makes her an instant hit with the ladies. They are, ultimately, gossiping, back-stabbing and petty.  The men of power in town are abusive and philandering... except the one that likes her. Destruction and revenge ensue.

This film has all the right emotions, love, revenge, death, life, beginnings, endings, Just about every emotion was brought out for a well done piece of art! The clothing very tasteful and surprising nice play while the elephant in the room was hardly noticed. I'm glad this was not an all dreams come true type of story! It was a brilliant dark comedy and a film about what goes around comes around and how all things in life are not certain; sticking with the old motto, ""revenge is a dish best served cold.""",1522454400,,644,4.512820512820513

7603913,4,B01AJV0CSE,"This is the type of movie that ropes you in from the beginning, even if you want to quickly shut it off. It's intense in parts, and the setting and events are truly depressing. In fact, from the first to last minute, the whole air of the film is depressing. Especially if you're someone like myself who stays away from such things, and isn't even a movie person, you'd be surprised how you can actually sit through it and look back on it, while wondering how you managed to enjoy it. And I did enjoy it. The acting was well-done and the relationships, good and bad, of the MC were well-executed/written. I really loved the growth between the mother and daughter, and [SPOILER] found it the worst moment when the mother went down. The love interest was... pretty stupid. His fall was so unbelievably exasperating. I personally saw it coming, but it felt like such a dumb move that it didn't really happen. Felt as if I had a mind fog while watching that aftermath. The end was the perfect way to wrap it up; she literally comes back to her childhood town to renew her ties and whatnot and to come-to-terms with what's always plagued her, but in the end winds up getting revenge without much planning and leaving the gosh-forsaken place full of closure. I found it ironic because usually the MC in such Tropes wants revenge in the beginning but winds up thinking that such a thing is wrong all nave-like, whereas in this case it's the opposite; she never planned to do anything but her hand was forced as she lost everything she had gained there. This movie was completely grey, not black and white like most films are.",1521504000,,1617,4.522184300341297

It's a very simple story of revenge, redemption, and the discovery of truth. There were some humorous moments which balances out the more heart string tugging scenes. My only complaint is how the movie handles the passage of time. There are very few indicators that tell us how much time passes between events. This makes the movie feel a little bit rushed.

Otherwise, it is intriguing, engaging, thought provoking, and charming. Kate Winslet does a fab job and it's always nice to see Chris Hemsworth without a shirt. I recommend giving it a watch.",1518998400,,728,4.824

The movie is spot on about so many idiosyncrasies of women with different insecurities. Definitely worth watching, but only if you can give it your full attention so you can catch all the silly spot-on jokes (I knew a woman who, when she got old and ended up alone, befriended a possum, and treated it like a stray cat, so maybe I just connect with some of the humor)",1518912000,,654,4.317073170731708

7603999,1,B01AJV0CSE,"Around the halfway mark, it seemed like the writer, director, and producer suddenly quit the production and the rest of the filming was wrapped up in an hour by a disturbed, deranged, death-obsessed escapee from an insane asylum. Just as you can't follow the thought pattern of a lunatic, don't expect to follow a coherent storyline here. You will be suddenly zigzagged and yanked from romance and comedy to demented horror and morbidity.

The first half was the only enjoyment--despite the early domestic rape scene...and despite the fact that viewers are expected to be dumb enough to believe that Liam Hemsworth and Kate Winslet are the same age when there's a nearly 15-year age difference. Don't look for a feel-good film here. Heck...it's not even a good dark film.",1516752000,2,771,4.976744186046512

I kept watching it, hoping that something good would come out of all the gloom and doom of the original plot. But nothing really good happened in this movie.

If you are all about getting even with those who have hurt you in the past and not letting go of your hurts and not forgiving and moving on... this movie is for you. Otherwise, spend your almost two hours watching something that will bring joy to your life, rather than gloom and doom.

A lot of great actor and actresses in this movie, yet a very sorry story line; which maybe true for a lot of people, but not something that anybody, as far as I know would like to relive....",1515715200,6,792,4.266666666666667

Just Hollywood filth in it's full regalia. Too bad Kate is used for such horrible imagery.  She sold out to the devil here.  People have so much more goodness in them.

The ups and downs of this movie were less like a roller coaster and more like a crazy person kicking a rag doll around a small room. The violence in this movie is shocking and comes out of nowhere (the rape scene is near the beginning and is so abrupt and isn't talked about at ALL, a wife slices her husband's achilles tendons near the end). These 2 scenes, plus certain random deaths, were meant to be played as emotional jumping off points for the lead actress but felt more random and were completely unnecessary. This could have been an incredibly cute movie about a woman reconnecting with here estranged mom, them getting revenge on the town, finding true love, etc. All of that happens but is ripped apart and destroyed. You can't care about any of it by the end. This movie was awful and completely inappropriate for younger teens, just fyi.

7604144,4,B01AJV0CSE,"I thoroughly enjoyed The Dressmaker. As others have said, Kate Winslet, our protagonist and dressmaker Tilly, delivers a great performance (and looks like a knockout, BTW). Molly, Tilly's estranged mother, is played perfectly by Judy Davis. It took me forever to recognize her... talented use of makeup and costumery had reduced her to a nasty, batty old woman.
The two women work wonderfully as a team to carry us through a film that, at times, feels more like a classic musical that was shot in a remote Australian town. One watches as each character transformed is by talented dressmaker Tilly to appear their very best selvesuntil they earn their just rewards.",1511654400,,664,4.990990990990991

7604179,3,B01AJV0CSE,"The beginning of the movie immediately grabbed me. A determined lone figure arriving in the tiny desert town on an ""iron horse"", wearing (blood) red immediately reminded me of ""High Plains Drifter"". And, that looked very promising. Other allusions to ""Drifter"" were the wrongful treatment of the hero; the boss of the town who controls everyone; town-folk too cowardly to stand up to the boss; the red carpet unfurled during the fire (""Drifter"" had the town painted red), the fire; and the self-destruction of the main villains. Had the script stayed with this theme and developed it further, this could have been a brilliant film.
Unfortunately, the script plops MacBeth into the mix. Furthermore, the tender romance was completely unnecessary and requires the viewer to recover from sadness, and switch back to the dark humor. What the town did to Tilly and her mother was sufficiently painful; the pain from the romance was overkill, and cluttered the script. The time used for the romance should have been used for scheming and planning the revenge. The script lost its way by trying to put too much into the mix. Too bad, because it started out so well.

7604201,5,B01AJV0CSE,"This movie filled every genre there could possibly be into 2 hours. While Liam is one of my celebrity crushes Tilly's mother is my favorite character in this movie. Kind of would have liked to know what happens to Tilly but at the same time not. She got the chance (in not a very pleasant way) to start all over again like so many people want to do. She could go anywhere and be anyone after burning down that town. She got the chance to create a new person. Really I do feel as if the curse was real simply because of her birth. Her father is the man he was and her mother (while I still loved her) being the women she was. Her circumstances were unfortunate and all very true to many peoples lives. Alos I like that they picked Liam to play Teddy. So many times the good-looking man is the one who is the jerk. In this movie, Liam is actually the guy who wants to do right by people and I think he gained some humbleness early in his life from his family being poor and his brother being special needs. Overall I had a feeling things were too good to be true when they slept together and he asked her to get married and I was straight PISSED!

Stellar acting (though the characters are more stylized than realistic) led by the incomparable Kate Winslet and Judy Davis.  Hunky Liam Hemsworth (Hunger Games) and quirky Hugo Weaving (Lord of the Rings) round out a strong cast.

7604218,1,B01AJV0CSE,"I think the movie description is completely misleading. Another commenter said it best. You think it's going to be a feel good movie where a woman goes back to her hometown as a successful clothes designer, and proves to all the people who  bullied her how wrong they were. I was expecting some comedy, and revenge, and to see her life turn out great in the end. Kind of like My Big Fat Greek Wedding or Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion. She does get revenge, and she is successful, and the clothes are beautiful, but it is extremely dark and depressing. There is a lot of unnecessary tragedy here, that the story would have actually been better without. I'm not saying it wasn't well acted. It was. Just understand what you're in for: it has some funny scenes,  but it is much more like a punch in the stomach. On the whole, if I had known what it would be like, I would never have watched it. Imagine watching The Color Purple with all of the tragedy, but Whoopi Goldberg doesn't get to meet her children in the end...instead they are tragically killed and so is her sister. Or picture Cinderella man a little differently with a more film noir screenplay: Braddock wins the fight,  but once he exits the ring he finds that his wife and children were all killed in a head on collision on their way to Madison Square Garden to see the fight. You get the picture. This is not your Friday night feel good movie.",1509062400,18,1416,4.417624521072797

7604252,5,B01AJV0CSE,"The Dressmaker is 2017 in a bottle. Take a society drowning in a storied, dishonorable and glaring history and set it in a nostalgic, whimsical yet vapid setting where quirky characters pit themselves against each other in a melodramatic and preposterous attempt at resolving and healing scabbed and crusted scars played out in present day sarcastic and ironic fashion.
The characters in The Dressmaker show us 2017 Americans how we attempt living in highly coutured and made over culture, drowning in luxury, consumerism and an inadequate attempt at capitalizing our way to redemption. We continue to buy a bitter and barbaric cloak and drape it over our twisted, storied historical narrative, pretending we are mesmerizing enough to outrun the wrongs in our past. We keep running through fields of dust in satin bows and sequins even though the rest of the world is hunched over and staring at us from atop an empty silo full of mice.
The Dressmaker in all of us will keep consuming, commercializing and gorging itself in the false pleasures of the American ideal. When will we return to our ghost towns, pull together and remake ourselves? Let us we take off the couture and humble ourselves enough to quit the positioning, patronizing, and barbarous positing and find our way home to each other. We are towns that need healing and harmony, dressed in goodwill, kindness and acceptance. When we let The Dressmaker back in and let her bring us together, binding, darning, refurbishing and refitting, maybe America will heal and move forward in peace, harmony and whole hearted love. Or will we burn it all down first?

7604275,4,B01AJV0CSE,"There were times this dragged. Because of this I would give this a low five/ high four stars.

This has amazing scenery in parts of the movie. The scenery is absolutely a part of the movie. It is like a character itself.
The characters are realistic with one exception. There is an officer who is also a cross dresser in this show. He makes friends with Tilly (Kate Winslet) and is fairly open with his cross dressing tendencies. When you look at the time this movie was set in and the place; this is unrealstic to me. Regardless though, if you think about the movie with out that character (Hugo Weaving), you can't imagine it.

Tilly has returned to town to figure out what happened all those years ago that caused her to be banned. She can't remember. She returns with anger at her mother that eventually tempers into acceptance and love. She returns with her sewing machine in hand and through her sewing she puts the town in it's place and learns what she came to learn. During this time she also falls in love with Teddy.

The clothing that the women (and men) wear is astounding. Tilly sews beautiful dresses.

As other reviewers mentioned, there are so many plot twists and turns it is easy to be surprised. Not just with the ending but through out the movie there are twists and turns.

Tilly's mother provides some comic relief, as does the officer. There are other moments of humor but overall, the movie is a fairly serious movie about a fairly serious topic.

Be warned, there is no happy ending. Not really. It's understanding, satisfying in some way. But it's not the true love wins and everyone rides off into the sunset happy ending.",1506556800,2,1650,4.5574324324324325

7604312,1,B01AJV0CSE,"From the start something about the movie felt really ""off"". IMDB claimed it was rated R for ""brief language and a scene of violence"". I wish IMDB would have also listed the sexual scene as one of the reasons. As it was, I went into the movie not expecting any sex, or, what is more, rape scenes. The disturbing scene with the husband and his compromised wife caught me unawares. I turned it off immediately but there's not much I can do to get that image out of my mind. Though I'd rather no rape scenes were ever included in movies, it is one thing to include them in say, a serious, historically-accurate movie, to drive home in people's mind something truly, truly horrible that happened (for instances, slaver crews raping women slaves aboard slave ships). In these instances there is a strong reason for them, and the authenticity of the message, and the fact of it actually happening ""justifies"" if not an explicit portrayal of these scenes, then at least an indication of their occurrence. In this movie, however, even if the rape scene is meant to point to that particular character's villainy, the lack of a clear strong message (at least so I've gathered from reading reviews) and the somewhat comedic, flighty way in which the movie is presented, just made this seem like some demented form of entertainment. I found the movie repulsive.",1505779200,8,1348,4.716101694915254

7604338,5,B01AJV0CSE,Nothing as I expected. Nothing like I have seen before.  If you want something different this fits the bill.  Loaded with dark humor.  Basically the jist is that a dressmaker returns home to Australia to discover if she murdered a boy as a child. But the movie turns out to be much more than about the dressmaker.  It is really about the town.  Recommend for adult audiences only.  Most youngsters wouldn't get it anyways.  It has a awesome twisted end.,1505088000,,453,4.5875

And design you get from the dresses to the sound score to the bus and train. It is of a piece and you have to step into the characters blighted landscape to see the beauty and grace. The arc of the narrative is indeed a tragedy marked with a tart sense of humor, from the hash brownies and sensational dress designs to the Italian western homage.

Her story is woven with the fabric she sews as she enhances the women of the small town in Australia she grew up in and as she seeks the truth of what really happened. Of course, there are the many threads that unravel along with the truth of what really did occur. It is romantic, tinged with a certain sadness.

Judging by some of these comments I can see why they didn't bother to do theatrical release in the US lol. There were some plot holes for sure and I felt a certain storyline was rushed. Overall I thought it was great. It's not something I would jump to watch in theaters but it was definitely a cute little Saturday night movie.  Kate Winslet was stunning as usual and did a great job with the accent. She sounded very much like an Aussie who had been living abroad for a very long time.
Also, those dresses that Tilly "" made"" were all breathtaking... Whoever the costume designer was for this movie I hoped she won multiple awards for her work. Absolutely stunning!",1504396800,,786,4.4206896551724135

Put the kettle on and watch a great Story be told.  I kept watching the trailer and putting off watching this movie...what a mistake!  This is an absolutely wonder-filled movie:  wonderfull dialogue, some of the most amazing acting I've seen of late, great and truly visceral cinematography, stunning costuming, ingeniously wicked repartee, and a moral dilemma-laced story line.  Revenge?  Or not.  Redemption?  Or not?

I can't remember the last time I laughed out loud in such utter and spontaneous surprise as the mother-daughter relationship tries to find its way past what seems to be an insurmountably cruel Past.  All the relationships in this film are not only complex but skillfully drawn.  I am a real fan of Australian movies and actors so I was pre-disposed to be be patient if the pace would occasionally slow; I ought not to have worried because I cannot imagine how the director could have sped it up without losing the subtleties and nuances of a really good Story.",1503446400,,1070,4.824175824175824

This movie was intriguing and had some stunning scenery and wardrobe pieces, but the overall theme was a bit lacking.

The acting is superb, and none would expect less from Oscar Winner Kate Winslet, although Judy Davis's performance as Mad Molly certainly portends of an Oscar of her own. The supporting cast all deliver solid noteworthy character performances, delightful ornamentation in the Australian bush set. My single qualm is that the movie suffers from tonal ambiguity.

Just when something seemed very real, like true love or motherly love, it appeared out of
context and placed on the screen just to have something happen... There is no way some of these characters could have morphed from their true self into a totally new character due to a change in wardrobe.  A meek young woman in glasses suddenly puts on a sexy dress and she's now
a totally different woman? Maybe in a book, when you turn pages and see the characters growth....but the whole movie seemed like a farce. Or maybe it was a farce. It was like dreaming or watching a film under the influence.  I watched the whole 2 hours but first it was slow and draggy and by the second half, they didn't know how to wrap up the plot...  She could have just exited after learning about how the young boy really died. No, first, she had to lose her mother and boyfriend....and then it was time to get even.  Just don't get it...She lived in Europe, had talent...she comes
home to a terrible place, learns the truth about the death of a young boy which was not her fault....But the solution is burning the whole town...and leaving by train with no sense of remorse.

In this movie tragedy was part of the story for the beautiful man who wanted to help change things before its time.  And, mom did not get to watch the end but had her hands in finally helping correct what she failed to prevent. I had not watched a movie that had so much impact.

I have no idea what to think about the meaning of the ending in a bigger sense, but in literal terms, I was satisfied by it.  Early in the film, there is a rugby game filled with gorgeous young men.  Strangely, after the game is over, the young men (save for our romantic leading man) seem to be missing from the town.  I guess since they were no longer needed in the main story, they also weren't needed to populate the town.

I had seen one trailer which intrigued me enough to really want to see this film.
Kate Winslet and Liam Helmsworth were perfectly cast in this lovely film. Without giving too much away, I will say, it's about a young woman (Winslet) who returns to the dirt path of a town from whence she came and shakes things up a bit.

Show me something that makes me think about it, long after the movie is over.

Some reviewers complain about the age difference between the female and male ""leads."" These are people who look into Hollywood too much. If you didn't know anything about Kate Winslet or Liam Hemsworth, you wouldn't be able to tell that there is such an age difference.

7604511,4,B01AJV0CSE,"I liked this movie. I liked the plot twists, I liked the generally unpredictable character arcs, I liked the actors and I liked the quirky scene staging. The video preview was compelling enough that I wanted to watch it even though the basic plot is ""prodigal child returns home."" It quickly established that Kate Winslet's Tilly Dunnage had returned to her tiny, backwards hamlet unabashedly more for vendetta than virtue.
What surprised me at first was how silly it presented itself by incorporating an almost vaudevillian feeling to the initial ruckus she caused with her unexpected appearance. It lead me to believe that the whole movie was going to have that same tone, entertaining and a bit kitschy--which I like if it's executed well. But there are whole sections when the movie breaks away from vaudeville into real poignancy and (admittedly) slightly overbearing Hollywood-love-story. One might argue that it's a movie that can't decide what it wants to be. I think that's ok. I find this lack of uniformity in tone both novel and endearing. It was very much darker than I was expecting, while also much more heartfelt and heartbreaking.
I'm aware that reviews can only subjectively claim whether a movie is good or bad. So I won't waste my time trying to convince anyone that it's ""good,"" only add my positive review in that regard, because I liked it and I don't think it's bad by way of directing or production values. I imagine that people who like Kate Winslet's somewhat whimsical, always strong, character portrayals, will like her in this.

It was a depressing movie, and definitely a vengeful one.  I was struck by the transformation that the dressmaker wrought in this tiny, dusty village. Bringing out their superficial beauty, and then showing their hideous lives underneath. The way she got back at the town in the end was macabe and seemed fitting.

7604539,5,B01AJV0CSE,"A remarkable movie with an outstanding cast. Once again, Amazon presents another singularly notable film. Kate Winslet and Judy Davis give exceptional performances, as do Liam Hemsworth, Hugo Weaving, and Gyton Grantley.
The movie's storyline follows a young woman's return to her rural hometown in Australia in 1951. Tilly (Kate Winslet) is ""The Dressmaker"", a brilliantly artistic designer. She finds the small town unchanged, and the small-minded denizens there immediately try to push her into the same bullied position she endured as a little girl. Tilly finds her mother (Judy Davis) driven mad from the treatment she has endured from the townspeople. Tragedies unfold, wrongs are righted, and truths are exposed. A love is lost; a mother and daughter pick up the frayed ends of their lost relationship and form an unbreakable bond.
This is a true Phoenix story.
What some reviewers call depressing, I term realistic. English Classical Literature author Thomas Hardy was severely criticized for his authenticity and realism in his depiction of the Victorian English classes, both aristocratic and especially plebian. Condemnation in his time was so severe, he never wrote another novel. And the literary world lost future works of a genius.

7604585,3,B01AJV0CSE,"This was a mixed bag, for me. A bit too ""Sweeney Todd"" in places which seemed excessive- some scenes could've been suggested to greater effect. There's a LOT going on in this flick. Perhaps too sweeping in intent for a single movie?
That said, this vast cast of well-knowns - whenever this many huge names congeal, in my experience (at, clearly, more finely spread pay) our stars have some societal message (or several) they're rather serious in imparting. This is a labor of love, comparatively speaking..
SJW's will likely adore this movie. Kate even mocked, at one drunken point, the concept that music could influence, so stop all music (or somesuch) which is adorable as this movie so clearly seeks to influence on modern societal points.
The acting is largely excellent, which one might expect, given the caliber of even the most peripheral supporting actors.
Some of the costumes are pretty fantastic. The transformations are great fun.
Kate's ""mother"" was my favorite character. Well played.
Everything else is pretty well the modern usual:  the villain-types have been cast to death (""Aren't their types abhorrent?"" ""Surely!"" as these selfsame judges fume, ""Don't judge ME by some stereotype!') the heroes, gorgeously predictable.
The only actual twist was the modified French-ish finale(s) when things didn't turn as US audiences have been accustomed to, but don't fret, chaos has its curtain call. .",1498089600,,1410,5.157205240174672

It is extremely well done with great acting by the entire cast and the film takes a lot of surprising turns.  It is not at all predictable and does not end up being the typical Cinderella story.

Instead of Tilly finding happiness, it ends with her getting final revenge on the townspeople and moving on.  If you are looking for a light, happy movie, this is not it.  If you are in the mood for something deep that turns a little darker and ""justice"" is done for the wrongs inflicted then you will love this.",1498003200,3,712,4.130434782608695

In long, what a waste of talent this film is.

There is no consistency in the genre, secondary actors are overdoing it so badly, it's like watching a Bollywood movie minus dancing and singing.

7604617,3,B01AJV0CSE,"This was an odd film, a challenge to put across, but it needed to be more specific in how it told its story. We might not reject it for surprising plot twists and turns -- quite a few -- if the clues and cues are there from the beginning, and they flow plausibly from expectations in place. This started out presenting itself as a fairy tale, but then seemed to be aiming for drama, then farcical revenge romp... and the pieces weren't fitting together. Cues in the performances would have solved this problem -- can't get specific without spoilers, so I won't -- but the cues weren't there.

The casting was a problem for me. Why would they cast Kate Winslet in this? She's in her 40s, a bit late for this story. There's a 14 year age difference between her and Liam Hemsworth, but they're supposed to be school chums. Winslet always seems a little bland, and that didn't work well for a revenge story. Even the child version of her was an odd choice -- she seemed too sturdy to be easily intimidated by a school bully who was smaller and skinnier than her. We needed to feel that she was hopeless and overwhelmed, in order to sympathize and understand what childhood had been like for Tilly, the reasons for her actions.

Judy Davis is my #1 favorite actress, and she seemed to be having a lot of fun as the dotty mum, but I didn't sense enough of the pain behind the peculiarity. When she comes clean about her actual story, it's there, but we should see  it all along. Hemsworth seemed very nonchalant and carefree, and that seemed oddly-sorted with his troubled story.

Hugo Weaving was a delight, certainly a far cry from his characters in The Matrix or V for Vendetta. The women of the town were wonderfully cast, especially the long-suffering wives.

It was very interesting, and everyone can relate to wanting to turn the tables on people who tormented you as a child, but the whole was a bit less than the sum of the parts. Judy Davis and Hugo Weaving make it worth the time, and Liam Hemsworth certainly improves the bleak scenery.",1497312000,,2042,4.493261455525606

If you are looking for sunshine and rainbows maybe this is not your type of movie.  But if you get dark humor and can follow a plot check this out!  Someones review of one star said you had to be a weirdo to like this movie...well count me in!  I'm a weirdo lmao",1496707200,2,426,4.121951219512195

7604640,5,B01AJV0CSE,"I enjoyed this film very much.  Judy Davis really ""chewed up the scenery"" with her performance. Kate Winslet was wonderful as usual. Hugo Weaving is a hoot. It reminded me a bit of ""Sordid Lives"" but even more offbeat and with a dark revenge, too. Excellent acting, script, directing, cinematography and music. One of those films where you think you know where it's going, and then you're wrong. I like those surprises.",1496534400,35,419,4.819444444444445

This story is like a new fairy tale, told in the old ways, before Disney made the lousy ""Girls must fall in love with the Prince submissively"" the trope for the entire genre. This is a magnificent tale, with enough twists to make you feel a bit stunned at times, yet it allows you to glimpse little things ahead of time so you can feel clever later.

7604739,4,B01AJV0CSE,Enjoyed this film. Had different expectations based on the trailer which is often misleading.  I found the film in keeping with the book which was more of a narrative.  Kate Winslet's performance was spot on especially as the character she portrayed was eccentric enough that the part could have been overplayed.  The supporting cast was strong and added to the overall performance.  Recommend.,1494288000,2,394,5.2063492063492065

The author of the storyline gets bored about two-thirds of the way through the tale and suddenly turns everything dark and dreary, resulting in a poor recovery and a very weak ending. The plot struggles back and forth, and several characters are killed off or sent to prison to try and create pathos, or perhaps comedy, or maybe just try and find direction. There's a violent, bloody scene towards the end that is completely unnecessary and sadistic. This was a twisted, perverted attempt at making a dark comedy.

7604831,2,B01AJV0CSE,"This is a revenge movie that took a turn for the worse. It wasn't a comedy. It was a tragedy...of a movie, too.
The first half of the movie sucked me in and made me care about the main characters and the love interest. And then ripped it all away with a shocking plot twist and a  Hamlet-ish ending.
Also, there was a rape scene, short and unnecessary, that should have ended up on the cutting-room floor.
This would be a terrible date night movie. It was depressing and bordered on horror.

7604852,5,B01AJV0CSE,"Amazing story of tragedy balanced with humor.  There is a reason that Macbeth is the play performed by the towns people.  The story teaches about what happens when evil people hold power and the destruction they create.  It also highlights the the power of male figures to do great good and great evil to women in an age when females were not considered social equals.  Bravo! Tragedies usually sadden me significantly, but there is much hope and a sense of fairness and justice at the end.",1492300800,,490,4.662790697674419
7604853,5,B01AJV0CSE,"A few minutes into this film, I almost quit. It just wasn't grabbing me. Yet for some reason I kept watching. I'm glad I did. Yes, this is dark humor, one of my favorite genres. The characters are absolutely delicious. I wasn't sure how it was going to end and that's part of this movie's charm. I don't like predictable and this movie is anything but that.

What one likes or dislikes is so very subjective. If one does not like offbeat characters with a somewhat unbelivieble plot, this is movie isn't for you. I won't tell you what I found most humorous,  but it was an incident that is truly memorable.

There is the ""50 Page Rule"" which states one should no give up on a book until one has read at least 50 pages. I don't now if there is a simile rule such as don't give up unless you've watched 20 minutes. This movie taught me not to give up too soon.",1492300800,8,858,4.1878787878787875

7604861,2,B01AJV0CSE,"I can't fault the acting.  Winslett, Hemsworth, Weaving and Davis were very good in their roles.  The cinematography was also excellent.  While much of the landscape was bleak, it added authenticity to the storyline.  I rather enjoyed the first three-quarters of the movie.  Then, it all fell apart.  Just when it appeared that Winslett's and Hemworth's characters would overcome the pain of the past and have a brighter future, Hemworth's character was killed off.  And the plot went off on a most bizarre and ridiculous tangent.  I hated the last thirty minutes of the film.

The shifts from joy to tragedy are rather rapid. Great performances from the ensemble cast. I don't know how they kept a straight face for most of it. Love Hugo Weaving. He is priceless.

7604870,1,B01AJV0CSE,"Well filmed, well acted, and... the story fails.  The story seems to be moving along very well and the set up is halarous in many ways.  I anticipated an ending for the ages, but that's where it all went wrong.  It was an ending for the ages alright, the dark ages.  It seems unusual that a movie hitting all the right marks could destroy itself so completely in so short a time, but The Dressmaker manages it.

One might recommend this movie for cinematography.  The color is great, lighting interesting, the mood is well set in nearly every shot, and the people are placed into the viewer's gaze well.  The audience is introduced to a desolate landscape, and that empty nothingness feeling is maintained right up to the end.  Appropriate, all things considered.  The ability to hold an aura of vastness throughout a long movie is difficult, and in this film the crew pulled it off with apparent ease.  Unfortunately, nothing can overcome a crummy story.

And this story is super crummy.

An interesting idea, a wonderful lead actress, a visually interesting movie, it should have been a good movie. Unfortunately, it isn't. Somewhere in the making of this movie, the people in charge of it forgot that, to be truly swept away by a movie, we have to like the people, or at least care about the people in the story, and not dislike them. And not despise them. A good ending might have saved the film, and it doesn't even have that, but at least the ending was a logical conclusion to the entire disappointing film.",1491868800,3,628,4.330508474576271

The longer the movie went on, the more depressing it became. The more in your face macabre that reminded me of Edward Gorey .... but more, uh, gory. (Haha).  This just isn't my kind of movie. I know a lot of people liked it - but if you don't like being depressed, don't like dark ""humor"", or like a happy ending then maybe this isn't your type of movie either.

One more thing, Liam Hensworth's character is supposed to be the same age as Kate Winslet's character .... She is beautiful, but that is a HUGE STRETCH of the imagination!!",1491782400,,721,4.286764705882353

High production values along with top notch casting and acting.  Shot entirely on location in the Aussie outback which was a perfect backdrop to the story.

The acting, the stetting and everything other than the story are all good. But in the end any movie person knows the story has to be good for the movie to be good. This movie just leaves a very bad feeling after it is over. It is dark and I realize some people praise such things, but this movie just drains the hope for humanity from a person.
So if you don't mind a dark story with no real redeeming ending then you will probably like it, because other wise it is a very well done movie.",1491609600,,618,4.032520325203252

7604919,3,B01AJV0CSE,"contains spoilers: I'd say 3 1/2 stars. It's pretty good and a relatable tale of wanting to ""show them all"" but done a bit too dramatically. I was impressed that the love interest ends up the way he does, simply because there really was a nagging feeling of she really has to do this herself, and someone coming in to sweep her off her feet and save her, just didn't feel like a good resolution.
Scenery/makeup/costume didn't really do a good job of convincing me of the ""one-horse town"" vibe they were trying to portray. I mean no doctor/sufficient healthcare, yet everyone just seemed too well-apportioned, with a town full of rugged 20 and 30-something men to make up a footballer(?) team and all.",1491436800,3,700,4.653225806451613

It begins with almost a thriller feel and doesn't force the romance and ends with a well-written twist. I highly recommend it.",1491350400,3,393,4.695652173913044
7604925,2,B01AJV0CSE,"This movie was just silly, and I found myself asking all these questions. It was about a woman who all of a sudden comes back to her native Australia - more like in the middle of the desert - to start up her dressmaking business. It could have been excellent, but I wondered why, if she was such a great dressmaker, and she was, did she come back to that desolate town in the first place? I had to clear out all the debris to come up with what I thought was a logical answer: she wanted to clear her name, as a young boy was killed when she was a child, and she was blamed for it and sent away, and that's when she learned dressmaking. When she returns to the town, and to her old home, her mother was obviously mad or insane, but towards the end of the movie, her mother suddenly acts normal. My next question was: why were all the women in this town having Tilly sew the most beautiful dresses when they weren't going anywhere, and it was pretty obvious they were all poor. The acting was superb and I love Kate Winslet, but their talent was wasted on this film.",1491350400,3,1064,4.144927536231884

The fact is, much of injustice and human cruelty happens through complicity . . . . that of cliques, class, professional or personal bias and sad, dull and prosaic things like protecting one's status, job or reputation.  This story unmasks respectability and shows the ugliness that often hides behind the masks.  The only fantastical part of this story is that ""the dressmaker"" escapes in the end, after a lifetime of loss and suffering, to possibly experience a better future.  The Seamstress stands on its own as a lovely film, but for those who can see it, it's also a parable about courage and responsibility.  Sometimes we don't even realize that we've been corrupted until we are confronted with the result of our wrongful action or inaction.  And naturally it always makes us uncomfortable. Guilt makes us hate our victims.",1490486400,4,1167,4.834170854271357

And I'm sure that was the point. I just wasn't ready to be raked this raw today. And I felt the trailer was a bit misleading. To avoid spoilers, I'll  just say films that mix genres can be disconserting (in this case, is it a dark comedy, romance, or tragedy?).",1490400000,6,493,4.53932584269663
7605024,2,B01AJV0CSE,"SPOILERS. This is a dark comedy that just becomes gratuitous toward the end. Tilly, her mother, and Teddy were comparatively ""normal"" to the rest of the characters who all seemed to be an OZ nod to Baz Luhrmann-style eccentricity. It made for a fair amount comedy, but eventually added too much disjointedness and distraction to the story. Tilly's personal redemption was completely undone at the very end with her crime against the town, and left with a more hardened heart than when she first arrived. But if I liked that sort of thing, I would have given it more stars. But then again, if I liked the ending, I would have given it less stars, since the object of the movie seemed to be to have me walk away with a dull sense of despair.

There's enough heart in it to sweep you up in tears with a delicious underscore of drama and revenge to thrill you to your toes.

7605063,5,B01AJV0CSE,"I'm a fan of Australian-made movies. There's a certain style to them that is funny and dry, and this movie definitely has a lot of amusing moments. But when the reality of the point of the story hits, it hits you pretty hard, and I imagine it's hard for people to reconcile the initial premise of the movie with the far darker second half. I found it hard to keep going for a while in the back half of the movie, because it was painful and sad to watch, but I finished anyway and I'm glad that I did even though the ending really was emotionally provoking and fairly depressing.

It's easy to get caught up in the beautiful couture (which -is- amazing) and the shocking second half of the movie (which really keeps the punches coming), and not realize this is a story about the things we put on to hide what's going on inside. Tilly uses her clothing like armor to protect her from people's hate, and the townsfolk try to disguise their ugliness with her beautiful clothing. The casting was incredibly good, and Liam Hemsworth impressed me quite a bit with his performance.. I've not been much of a fan before, but he was excellent here. Just be aware that the movie is going to a fairly dark place, and if you're not the sort who enjoys plays like Hamlet and Macbeth, or if you got PTSD from watching Bambi, this may not be the right movie for you.",1490054400,4,1349,4.353174603174603

This movie is delightful with tons of clever humor but sincere emotion throughout. The stellar cast is phenomenal. In particular, Kate Winslet and Judy Davis portray a tumultuous mother and daughter relationship that show true familial love extends beyond distance. Their ultimate devotion is very moving. I wish the story line had Liam Hemstrom's character ""Teddy"" remain longer. However, ultimately the victorious end would not have been as triumphant without his early departure. This is a terrific period piece movie with an incredible theme and such a pleasant view of Australian mid-century life.

It is a movie that will make you laugh and then break your heart. Those who give it one star or none, were you to read their reviews, have never enjoyed a Shakespearean tragedy.

I'll look forward to watching it a second time in the future and picking up the nuances missed in the first viewing. A rich movie, with wonderful cast. I haven't seen such a great film in a long time. Not some Hollywood tripe that needs none stop action to leave their viewer thinking they watched something.",1489708800,2,620,4.535714285714286
7605124,4,B01AJV0CSE,"(SPOILER ALERT!!) I think that this movie was very well made. Kate Winslet, and especially Judy Davis were great as mother and daughter. I also think that the costume designs were superb. No, it isn't girl meets boy, girl gets married and lives happily ever after. Instead, there was this kind of justice that Kate Winslet's (behind the scene her mother also finally gives the town payback through her daughter) character is given in making the town that almost destroyed her mother and herself by giving the town their comeuppance in the end.",1489708800,,543,4.849462365591398

The next time around I caught the nuances of the story and understood the Aussie accented dialog some of which I had missed before. It is a dark comedy and you might shed a tear along with laughing uproariously. You witness human selfishness and evil. But, even larger loomed love, acceptance and loyalty to family and those who stand by us. So funny watching the women strutting down the dusty street in their couture gowns.

7605138,4,B01AJV0CSE,"A solid film overall. Kate Winslet did a terrific job in the lead role. Her vulnerability and commitment to the part of Tilly really gave the character depth and propelled viewers through the story. The costumes were gorgeous, and the way they were used in the film helped lend a lightheartedness to the plot that kept it entertaining. Although there were comedic moments, this is a film that showed the disappointing sides of human beings--how selfish, unfair and cruel people can be, even to people who have done nothing to deserve it. It also does not have a Hollywood happy ending, which is something we want for characters who have already been wronged and suffered for it. This is why I believe a lot of people labelled the movie ""disturbing"". There are elements that are too real to provide the escape that many seek when watching movies, but it is a movie that was well-done, and I did not feel as though my time was wasted. My feeling is that if the last 36 minutes or so of the film had been left off, it would have left people watching with more of a good feeling. As it is, the ending is a touch unbelievable, it does not seem to fit with the rest of the film, and characters the viewer thinks should have grown during the story, ended up learning nothing about justice and treating others fairly. The actors, however, did a good job portraying their characters--(with Kate Winslet truly excelling in her performance,) and the cinematography was on point.",1489622400,,1467,4.624521072796935

7605181,2,B01AJV0CSE,"I knew this wasn't going to be the happiest film (the revenge plot was fairly clear from the trailer, imo), but I wasn't expecting it to be quite so dark. After the twist I thought, ""Ok, how are they going to save this?"" and, well, they didn't. They just took it darker and darker. When your character's ""happy ending"" is that she destroys (and literally ends) multiple lives, maybe you need to rethink your plot.

While there are vast differences between the movies, the construction of this one reminds me most of Dogville, which is the most dark and depressing move I've ever seen. If you don't want to spoil this one, read the plot synopsis of that one, and know that the filmmakers make you *happy* about Dogville's ending. This is a less bad version of the same kind of thing.",1489363200,2,782,4.507042253521127

7605185,1,B01AJV0CSE,"The Amazon blurb is very misleading - it paints it as a chick-flick, where the lead character has been wounded, but comes back and manages to redeem her life and relationships. Rather, everyone important to her dies and/or leaves, and the rest of the town dies or is wounded by her revenge. Besides the depressing plot (that I wasn't expecting), it felt disjointed - almost like a weird dream with bizarre twists and overdone characters. The film lacked cohesion.

I should have stopped watching before the love interest died - then maybe I could have walked away without the sour taste in my mouth. This film is so pointlessly tragic, bitter, and overdone.",1489363200,7,657,4.814159292035399

The story and production and well-developed characters along with creative idiosyncrasies pulls you right in like you are living the movie...  but reflect upon the darker side of humanity, which might be OK - most good stories are about overcoming something and a eventually a happy resolve.

Beats anything out of Hollywood in my opinion. Has all the bases covered with comedy, drama, sadness and death. A superb screenplay and flavorful characters brought to life by skillful actors (several of my favorites). And, did I mention fabulous couture of the early 1950s? Awesome costume designs! Kate Winslett hit it out of the park in this one as well as a Judy Davis. I also loved the police chief(?), though I forgot to check his name before beginning this review. I noticed a few bad reviews but cannot imagine why anyone would be so negative about this movie unless it is just not their cup of tea or it was intentional to bring down the star ratings. IDK.

7605274,4,B01AJV0CSE,"i gave the movie 4 stars because of the ending. The ending to me did not fit the overtone of the movie. There were times of true brilliance and humor, and then the end seemed to be rushed. There was too much pushed to the very end. The character was striving to overcome the tragedies of her childhood, and I think she was accomplishing that, but burning down the town, showed she was cursed in her own mind, and was not free. I think that is where the director and myself disagree. It takes more strength to walk away, and not leave a fiery indignation.",1488931200,,554,4.285714285714286

The creations were great, but it seemed like we saw them briefly and then they weren't part of the story as much anymore.  She transforms the town only for it to seem like it went back to the way it was, imo.  The build up of the story of her childhood tragedy felt too prolonged to me and too predictable, unfortunately.

7605288,4,B01AJV0CSE,"It's funny how some don't seem to recognize that this film is a black comedy; and one reviewer so disliked it, they said Kate Winslet had ""fallen far"" since Titanic -- a technically brilliant yet horribly flawed film in its script and dialogue, so I disagree.  Winslet gave a great performance in Titanic, considering how badly her character was written; and she gave an excellent performance here, as did Judy Davis, who has made a career of odd, yet interesting roles.  In fact, all the actors give top-notch performances.  Few films are completely without flaw, but I found none here that were remarkable enough to bring it down.  Overall, I enjoyed thoroughly the quixotic characters and events.  Technical problem reviews impact the overall rating, which is unfortunate.  Amazon's return policy makes rectifying an accidental purchase easy; and yes, it's always important to check the media format and region before purchasing.

What better way to show off the dressmaker's brilliance.

Quirky, humorous, touching and painfully believable.  Have to say, Winslet knocks this out of the park.  Not because she is the blossoming beauty on screen that she has become, but she was this character, with some appropriate camp in her clutch purse when she needed it.

What makes it so watchable is the comic relief given not only through unique characters but also by the over the top costuming.  The actors are all excellent in their roles especially Kate Winslet, who plays the lead role, and Judy Davis, who plays her mother.

Its set in rural Australia in the middle of the last century and shows how small town decisions and opinions are swayed by social leaders.

Winslet needs to be careful about the role she chooses to play.

Some reviewers took offense by the stereotypes in this film, and found the social commentary distasteful; I found the characters to progress the story line. It is worth remembering that this is just a story, not an attack nor an attempt to vilify any person of any creed.
It is, after all, only entertainment.",1488585600,9,532,4.98876404494382

The acting and costuming were both fabulous, and the story kept me on my toes.  Just when it looked liked plot lines had been resolved, twists would happen that sent the story off in an unexpected direction. No wonder Tilly thought she was cursed!  There is a lot of quirky humor to balance out the poignant and sometimes heartbreaking developments.  It all leads up to a rather satisfying ending on several counts.",1488585600,6,563,4.6

However, the series of events and accidents reinforces a ""cursed"" point of view rather than making the point I imagine they were going for and the movie takes a dark and unfortunate turn, ending in something I don't find the least bit justifiable. If it would have been a movie about revenge, I would have much preferred the revenge be more justice than criminal. And the love story is cheapened by the plot and the final result, which doesn't honor in the least the series of unfortunate events. The movie had potential and great acting, but I did not care for the ending direction, however ""artistic"" it might appear. The message is lost and I ended up disliking everything about it.

Splendid drama exposes the corrosive nature of small-minded bigotry, pettiness, vicious envy, and absurd competitiveness that ensnarls on personal, family, and town levels.

7605383,4,B01AJV0CSE,"A quirky period piece, with an underlying mystery and high fashion in a dusty Australian backwater--that's right up my alley! it's actually five stars for me, personally.  This is a typically British, character driven plot. Good sets, solid casting, well-written script, and obviously great direction. Kate Winslet delivers a wonderful and nuanced performance. I'm surprised by the number of reviewers who are unfamiliar with the great Judy Davis, who completely nailed her role as the half-batty mother, adding just the right notes of comic relief at the right moments. The two women sparkle together in roles that weave a little surrealism, with a lot of quirk, into a provocative and often humorous look at human frailties.

On another note, I was going to pay to view this film a couple weeks ago, but Amazon let me know it was coming up for free with Prime. Nice tip. Now that I've seen it, I would have gladly paid the few dollars to watch it. Really appreciate the heads up, Amazon.",1488585600,29,989,4.846153846153846

7605393,5,B01AJV0CSE,"I saw this Australian film right after I read the book of the same name upon which it was based. This is one of the few times that I can categorically say the the film is better than the book. In fact, the film is terrific! Though it is reasonably faithful to the book, it has the editing the book lacked. In fact, the film is everything the book could have been but was not.

The film takes place in the early nineteen fifties and tells the story of Tilly Dunnage, who returns to her childhood home in Dungatar, a small hardscrabble town in the Australian outback. She had been cast out twenty years earlier at the age of ten, torn from her home and her mother, Molly Dunnage, after being unjustly accused of a heinous act. Tilly unites with her mother, now known as Mad Molly, and takes charge. The intervening years have not been kind to Molly, but Tilly sets out to right all that has gone wrong.

Now a highly accomplished dressmaker, Tilly initially overcomes the antipathy of the local women, most of whom are comically ignorant, small-minded, and petty, and begins creating beautiful Balenciaga and Dior inspired dresses for them. Tilley forms a friendship with Sergeant Farrat, the town's sole constable, who harbors his own secrets, and begins a romance with Teddy, her handsome neighbor and the town's star athlete.

Still, the initial acceptance of Tilly's haute couture efforts on their behalf does not change the nature of the townspeople,  and the malicious  nature of many of them bubbles up and spills over once again onto Tilly and her eccentric mother. Not even Teddy's unconditional love for Tilly  can breach that wall of antipathy. Then, the unthinkable happens. Now, Tilly prepares to  unleash a secret  plan of her own, as the town will soon discover.

The cast is uniformly excellent. Kate Winslet is outstanding as Tilly, endowing her character with both tenderness and a  steely determination. Liam Hemsworth is perfectly cast as the good natured  and innately sweet Teddy,  a man who seeks only to love Tilly as she should be loved. Judy Davis is a standout as Mad Molly, Tilly's quirky mom. Hugo Weaving nearly steals the show, however, for his campy portrayal of Sergeant Farrat. This is simply a first rate, highly enjoyable film.",1488499200,28,2261,4.769230769230769
7605394,5,B01AJV0CSE,"What a charming and quirky film! I'd say it's in the same vein as Cold Comfort Farm, darkly humorous, a little sad. The plot makes good use of all the characters in this odd little outback town to which Tilley returns after a 25 year absence.
Kate Winslet never fails but the strongest characters, IMHO, are those portrayed by Judy Davis as Tilley's (Kate's) mother and Hugo Weaving as the town constable living with a delightful open secret.

This movie goes on my all-time favorites list.",1488499200,6,490,4.6976744186046515

If you can appreciate all the artistic brush strokes of the film, your experience will be richer for it. If not, you will still feel the power of the message and enjoy the acting.

I am very good at predicting what is going to happen in a movie, and how the charactors will unfold their personaities. So the movie was intelligent in that sense.  However; I don't think this was a five star tour de force, and feel that five stars should be reserved for, knock your sock off/outstanding.  This was not a feel good movie at all, although it was funny, at times, yet it was not a total downer.  It has a kind of truthful message which it tells very bluntly, not in words, something about the eccentric personality in general, and how it comes to be formed, but through the outcome of events, so it's not all about happy endings.  We get some of what you want in life and are creative about making it work for us.  And, life is so much more than what we can plan for.  Also, the dresses are five star, for sure.

But it felt like the throttle broke, and the movie went speeding out of control, while the audience was covering their eyes, not knowing if some semblance of ""who was who"" would emerge, and the train would get under control, or crash into a confusing jumbled heap.  Script, direction, and editing changes may have salvaged it.

It's based on a gothic novel, which helped me understand the shifts a bit more.

I would call it a tragicomedy but it is mostly comedy.  The tiny town has a cross dressing police constable in love with fabric and accessories - one moment this constable will make you laugh and the next moment, touch your heart with a dramatic scene.

7605574,2,B01AJV0CSE,"(TLDR SPOILERS AHEAD, PLEASE DISCONTINUE READING AFTER THE FIRST PARAGRAPH BELOW IF YOU DON'T WANT THE MOVIE RUINED!)

The trailer for this movie made it seem like it would be one of those timeless romantic comedies with a bit of darkness and a lot of added humor, unfortunately I feel it fell short in almost every way. I was very displeased with the movie, the trailer and descriptions portrayal of what the movie would be about, and found that the movie itself made absolutely no sense. It felt very pieced together toward the end and honestly was just less and less enjoyable the further in time it played on. I won't pretend that I'm some great movie connoisseur or that I often write movie reviews, but since I did purchase a rental and I'm being asked for a review I'll share my thoughts. I make no promises once I'm started and hope this makes sense --

(PLEASE DO NOT CONTINUE READING IF YOU WISH TO AVOID SPOILERS!)

The movie starts out slowly, with a young woman coming back to a small little dusty dessert town to see and help her aging Mother who has over the years become what they referred to as 'eccentric' which was really code for bat shee crazy! Apparently she was driven to this by the removal of her child and with the setting and time period of the movie, that didn't seem to out of place. The dresses and attire while a little over the top at times were very pretty and fun to look at, and there were many scenes throughout the movie that I found enjoyable, some even slightly heartwarming mostly due to the acting by Kate Winslet which was decent although clearly not her best work, but the emotions were there. Then the movie takes a strange turn and dips off entirely from the story line presented in the trailer and worded description of the content. I felt the movie was supposed to portray a wronged woman coming back as a successful upstanding adult, where she helps her Mother recover, shows the little town she grew up in just how far she can go, where she falls in love and reconciles with her past and how she came to be what she was, and that she would live happily ever after. Unfortunately for me, it was neither of those things. She comes back home, she deals with her Mother and her illness and finds out the truth about what happened to her as a child, finds out who her Father was, more or less has him murdered, which I won't even bother with that scene, that was just so far out of place with the rest of the movie I can't even begin to describe it, and then in a whirlwind of bizarre events, the love of her life that helped her remember all of those things is killed off and then everybody that loved her or cared for her either dies or is taken off scene or put in prison, something, something happens to them all, and then off she pops onto a train after setting the entire town on fire, which leads you to suspect that all the people who were still living there that weren't off at this weird town against town production, were likely simply burned alive, and then it ends, leaving you wondering what the heck you just watched and how something that was supposed to be so good ended up being so absolutely bizarre and unappealing and twisted.

If you want to watch it for entertainment value or you like me, think it's supposed to be a romantic comedy with a little drama shaded in, don't bother. If you enjoy movies that make no sense and jut off in various directions throughout it's entirety, by all means, have at it. I personally wouldn't recommend this to watch to someone, I felt it was a waste of my time.",1485734400,4,3562,4.376132930513595

Perhaps they cried and are sore about it because they felt something uncomfortable.
 The Dressmaker unfolds as an unusual mother daughter story into a fantastic magic realist screenplay where larger than life characters burst onscreen in Shakespearean tragicomedic drama. The set, costume design and cinematography could stand alone as a visual arts masterpiece.  Full of nuance and wise truths about the human condition, the delicate and intimate relationships within rural communities, small town culture and a deeply sympathetic view of what life looks like from the outskirts of town looking in. What we see is the hipocracy of a culture prone to scapegoating. It's a masterpiece!",1485388800,4,977,5.337662337662338

There was just too much leading up to the relationship prior to the death to change gears so drastically. Everything in terms of the talent, the quality of the set etc., is superb.

In the first few minutes of the film I was reminded of Cold Comfort Farm, a wonderful little story of a woman bringing enlightenment to an insular part of her family that was a pure delight. However it soon becomes apparent that this mysterious woman is on a much darker quest. Teasing out the threads of the story would require giving much too much away. My main problem with the film is a failure of tone. Comedy and dark themes are not mutually exclusive but need a very careful blending. While all the characters were interesting in the end I did not really care what happened to them including the mysterious woman. Some were indeed changed but it seemed more for the convenience of the plot, not a change in the characters understanding of the world and their moral failure.

7605739,5,B01AJV0CSE,"Loved it! I think that a lot of people thought it was going to be more of a clean, feel-good movie... lol, that is not this movie. I was pleasantly surprised by the plot, script, acting, and even the dark overtone of the second part of the movie (which I loved too by-the-way). Yes, it was quite disheartening and sad as the plot developed. But I see try to see stories as their own entity and form of art. Just because a movie doesn't play out how I think it will, or should, doesn't make me instantly despise it (like I see so many modern movie-watchers do). I actually like being surprised from a movie's plot and this definitely did it, because I hadn't seen the previous movie or read the book it was based upon. Kate Winslet is one of my favorite actresses and came through once again with a beautiful and well-manipulated performance. I was even surprised by the warm and genuine acting that Liam Hemsworth gave. My favorite character was Hugo Weaving as the sergeant of the town, it's humorous to see someone as iconic as ""Mr. Smith"" from The Matrix play a flamboyant, cross-dressing cop from the 50's (loved it). I love that he is so diverse in his roles, which I think is what makes a truly talented actor.
All in all, the movie was well written and acted. The plot kept me interested, intrigued, and emotionally involved. These are the best things to have from a movie, in my opinion. Definitely worth watching, just know that this is a dark, revenge-comedy that involves high fashion. I actually think it's hilarious that some people complained about the fashion points in their reviews. People... it is called The Dressmaker lol.",1484524800,24,1642,4.58843537414966

7605743,3,B01AJV0CSE,"I was quite excited for this movie to come out, so as soon as it was available I rented it. I read some reviews beforehand, some were not kind, but decided to watch anyway. The mystery and intrigue made it interesting enough to finish, but so many things were wrong with this film.
 1. Kate Winslet looked great in this movie, but definitely shouldn't have had Liam Helmsworth as her co-star. While both are good actors, the movie attempted to portray them as being the same age (which definitely isn't believable). Also, there was just no chemistry between them.
 2. Their relationship felt like it came out of nowhere. She hadn't seen him in 20 years and poof they're in love. Didn't make sense to me. There really wasn't many interactions in the movie between them to make me believe it.
 3. On a positive note-I enjoyed the ending to this. I like a movie that has a completely wrapped up ending, and this was a refreshing take on that. Not to give spoilers, but I enjoyed that it wasn't necessarily as happy ending. It was nice to see a movie that didn't sugar coat life.

Overall, I thought the movie was ok, but could have done better.",1484438400,6,1141,4.471153846153846

It doesn't feel like it drags along like in some other movies in the same theme. You really start to understand the dynamics of everyone in the town as their relationships unfold like they would in a play and their own personal quirks come to light. It's quite comical in that sense. Of course, there is the main story itself of the dressmaker and her road to remembering what really happened all those years ago. It's never heavy-handed, and it's easy to follow along yet it still makes you feel for her and the sordid situation. Her mom is a hoot, the sheriff also. There are several redemption subplots within the main story and the end was satisfying for me. All in all, she accomplished what she came to do. All I know is if I ever rewatch the Matrix movies I'll have myself a giggle because of the sheriff.",1484438400,,974,4.416666666666667

The story is a great, but the acting is sublime--how could it not be with the marvelous Judy Davis and the lovely Kate Winslet. Liam Hemsworth is grand, and Hugo Weaving is hilarious. Altogether, very funny, and very lovely.",1484352000,,456,5.093333333333334
7605754,5,B01AJV0CSE,"Excellent farcical soap opera/comedy that turns dramatic at the end. A bit too long for one sitting, but nonetheless very engaging from start to finish. The dresses were great and Kate and Liam lived up to their billing, but for me the real treasure was the townspeople and the gifted actors that portrayed them. Judy Davis as Kate's mother ""Mad"" Molly conveyed the depth of her somewhat tragic character with humor and compassion. Likewise, Barry Otto was unforgettable as Mr. Almanac, who made me laugh out loud with every bit he had. Lastly, there was Hugo Weaving stepping out as the cross-dressing town cop. Great original orchestral score with occasional period songs from 1951. Worth watching over just to get all of the plot twists.",1484352000,,740,4.928

It really is like that for the most part when people who have left ""home"" at an early age try to go back, and make things right, or at the very least, peace. It tears the entire lid off of all the pretensions of the ""players"" that caused one to leave in the first place. After all, they must make you out to be the ""Bad gal, or guy"" in order to be able to hold onto their refection of a life. This was well done. I applaud it completely. No candy coating. Just the closet door being opened and all of the skeletons being drawn out, and dressed in the way that reflected who, and what, they really were, inside out. Then, of course like any over loaded ""closet"" the contents that one no longer needed had to be thrown away, killed, incarcerated, run off, or burned.",1484265600,4,804,4.127388535031847

-------
pros
-------
++ the plot is great: it's original, unlike lots of stuff on the movie market. The plot has a really surprising turn of events and is very engaging.
++ the conflict exposed in the movie would be appealing to everyone. It's about people's prejudice, speculation, and gossip, and their detrimental effect on the life of a family in the community.
++ the acting of all actors is exceptional; Kate Winslet is unbeatable in her acting talent. Very professional crew.
++ camerawork is great - it's one of the movies where camerawork makes a difference, helping to reveal the character of the personages.
++ the soundtrack is a professional, classy, stylish, and a very moving piece of music
++ wardrobes in the movie are very interesting to look at. The movie takes place in the1960s, with the apparels containing lots of fine lines, making a movie historical in this sense.
-------
cons
-------
++ the movie is a little theatrical, meaning some of the emotions/reactions are exaggerated. But to me that was not a problem. It fits in well in the whole style of the movie
++ the movie has somewhat lower budget and it is noticeable in some visual effects; Fire, for example, was sometimes conspicuously cartoonish. That said, visuals are not the main focus in the movie, and some occasional poor visualizations do NOT turn the viewer off at all.
++ lots of smoking going on, so you might want to consider some restrictions for your children.

Love, Hate, Revenge, Forgiveness and Transformation, it's all there plus a touch of wackiness and I merrily enjoyed the ride. Despite what IMDB describes as (factual time period) Goofs, I say it's a well crafted screenplay, superbly acted, with rich characters that captivate your attention and your heart... the 1951 dusty rural setting is a wonderful backdrop that kept me gasping for a breath of fresh air as I watched Kate Winslet's character fighting for some small measure of hope, decency and redemption to come from the narrow minded folks living in this tiny speck of a town. Of course this time period also allows for fabulous costuming. This film is glorious and I will happily watch it again and again!

7605884,4,B01AJV0CSE,"""Revenge is a dish best served cold"" as the old saying goes. In ""The Dressmaker,"" those cold dishes are served up by several of the wrongfully maligned characters in head-spinningly creative ways, some hilariously funny, others bittersweet at best, others mortally wounding.  No matter, in the end, there is always a price to be paid for the revenge seeker. This film is cinematically stunning. Kate Winslett and Judy Davis, in particular, gave memorable performances. If this was instead filmed in a backwater New Mexico town post-WW II, you'd want to believe the Coen Brothers had a hand in it. Loved it!",1483833600,9,606,5.0

7605902,4,B01AJV0CSE,"This is an exceptionally well made romantic dramedy (with a surprisingly dark third act) from a script with a couple of significant tonal and focus problems.  The main character Tillie, returns home to her small town to find answers and work through a childhood trauma....  which she does, before the script veers into a revenge drama mode.  The people of the town are small-minded, and a couple are dastardly, but they're caricatures well drawn by the actors, and COMICALLY portrayed.  Thus  it's hard to downright hate them, which becomes necessary in order to accept their final punishment at Tillie's hands.
Judy Davis and Kate Winslet are brilliant;  they are worth the entire price of the movie (along with the clothes);  their scenes together are hilarious and touching.  They have real authority as performers.  The entire cast is inspired, with the exception of Liam Hemsworth, whose main job is to look ruggedly sexy- which he does- so it doesn't matter much.  Hugo Weaving is misdirected as a gay, semi-closeted policeman, and the production design feels locked inside a wheat-gold postcard of 1950's Australia (aside from numerous melodramatic childhood flashbacks which are uniformly blue-grey tinted and slo-mo.)",1483747200,4,1226,5.241025641025641

7605904,3,B01AJV0CSE,"I watched this movie for the male star, Liam Hemsworth, who is so very handsome.  The movie itself is a fantasy.  What dressmaker in an outback town has so many beautiful fabrics to work with? Did she actually come to town with all those beautiful fabrics, or somehow get them ordered (how) and shipped (how) and paid for (how)?  Also, I noticed the lady who wore the glasses that was transformed as soon as she put on one of the dressmaker's dresses that she suddenly didn't need glasses anymore.  Kind of fantasy land, but it was OK to watch.  As I said the male star, Liam Hemsworth, was well worth looking at!",1483660800,3,613,4.4375
7605905,2,B01AJV0CSE,This is a dark comedy and quirky. It felt like I was watching a live play in a theatre. It is much different than what the write up would have you believe so take that into account. I liked the storyline and the ending but I did not find the cast believable because of the age differences in the actors trying to play characters that are supposed to be the same or close in age in the movie. Not your typical film.,1483660800,,414,4.060975609756097

The film itself is pretty great and wasn't depressing to this viewer as it has a delicious mix of redemption for a mother and daughter who were cruelly treated and then there is the revenge!  The setting for fabulous and quirky haute couture gowns and dresses is a wizened and isolated tiny town in the outback of Australia that sports very large dead trees and dusty streets throughout.  One review says that this is not a fairy tale, but in most ways, it surely is.  It is a terrific blend of the liberating qualities of truth and justice, humorous defeats of wrong doers, the tragic beauty who believes herself cursed and the astoundingly handsome young lover who helps to dispel the nature of the curse, the pitfalls of vanity that have captured the cowardly members of the town and the magical transformation of those who could be seen as unattractive by the simple donning wonderful clothes.  Judy Davis is hilarious and Kate Winslet, well isn't she just always fantastic?  I'll watch it again just to indulge in the eyeful of interesting contrasts.",1482883200,491,1193,4.847290640394089

7606060,2,B01AJV0CSE,"""The Dressmaker"" (2015 release from Australia; 118 min.) brings the story of Tilly (played by Kate Winslet). As the movie opens, we are reminded this is ""Dungatar, Australia, 1951"", and we see Tilly arrive in town late at night. ""I'm back, bastards!"", Tilly proclaims to no-one in particular. Tilly goes to her mom Molly (played by Judy Davis). Her mom's house is a total mess, to Tilly's chagrin. The next day we get to know a bunch of the town's characters, and everyone is in a tizzy about Tilly's return. Why indeed has she come back after all these years? Was Tilly somehow involved in the murder of a young boy some 20+ years ago? At this point we're not even 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest film from Australian producer-director  Jocelyn Moorhouse, best known in the US for ""Muriel's Wedding"". Here she transposes the book of the same name onto the big screen. I wasn't all that familiar with the it, other than it involves some unresolved murder case. Hence I was expecting a crime drama of some sort. Turns out I was completely wrong, and in fact this is an all-out comedy, with zero drama. I knew I was in trouble when Winslet's character proclaims early on ""I'm back, bastards!"", tongue firmly planted in cheek. I couldn't get into the movie whatsoever, and was bored out of my mind, with zero emotional investment as to any of these characters. ""If I wanted to kill you, I'd break your neck"", Winslet's character comments later on, and I was thinking ""please do! maybe that will generate some much needed tension"", but alas, it doesn't happen. Some may think that this is a ""chick's flick"", and that may be the case, but I respectfully disagree that this is the reason I didn't like the movie. I came into the movie expecting a crime drama or psychological thriller or character study of some sort, and the movie is none of these. I recognize this can happen from time to time (I'd rather not know too much of a movie going in), and I've been pleasantly surprised on many occasions, but here it simply didn't pan out, sorry.

""The Dressmaker"" premiered at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival, yes, over a year ago. No idea why this recently showed up out of the blue at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Monday evening screening where I saw this at was attended quite nicely, somewhat to my surprise. I really cannot recommend this movie, and the only reason that I give it 2 stars is because of Kate Winslet, whose screen presence cannot be denied. That said, if you are considering watching this movie, just be sure your expectations are in line with what this movie really is, i.e. a comedy with tongue-in-cheek.",1475539200,3,2815,4.603585657370518
7606061,1,B01AJV0CSE,I thought I could play it on my DVD player but I found it was only able to work in other countries. There was nothing in the description that stated that and the codes they use are not detailed enough to explain.,1475280000,3,212,4.071428571428571
7606062,2,B01AJV0CSE,"Jocelyn Moorhouse's work promises so much, yet delivers so little in the end.

The plot is brilliantly set up; set in a backwater of rural Australia in the early Fifties among a small community too well acquainted with each other's social mores, it centers on the return of a prodigal daughter (Kate Winslet) to stay with her mother (Judy Davis) after a prolonged absence. Neither of the siblings appear to get on; in fact, the mother appears not to want to know the daughter.

Life appears to continue on its own sweet way in the community; but there appears to be something wrong. No one really acknowledges the daughter Myrtle (aka Tilly's) presence, until they discover her remarkable talent at dress-making. In a series of sequences highly reminiscent of any drawing-room comedy, scruples are shed, as the local women seek to better themselves by ordering a series of increasingly fancy frocks from Myrtle.

Through this comic structure director Moorhouse explores the often threatening influence of the past and how it continues to cast a blight over the present, despite Tilly's best attempts to contend with it. Both herself and her mother have historically represented challenges to the established social status quo, and they will never escape the stigmas attacked. The fact that villagers are equally morally culpable - although they stringently deny it - is but another layer of irony added to an exceptionally subtle piece.

In the end matters come to a head at a village wedding, where the past is revisited and Tilly learns at last what really happened to her when she was a child, and why she was so cruelly sent away. At this point we understand just how limited in terms of scope rural communities actually were, despite their surface assumption of manners and their willing embrace of commercialism (as symbolized through the easy availability of gramophone records).

Yet it is here that the film falls apart. Incident follows incident with very little narrative cohesion, almost as if the filmmakers are trying their utmost to forge a happy ending and allow Tilly to leave her hometown with her head held high and the demons exorcized for good. There is a particularly spurious sequence involving a rendition from Gilbert and Sullivan's THE MIKADO, followed by a sequence out of Shakespeare's MACBETH that would not have seemed out of place in a remake of BLACKADDER 3.

The action is at least half an hour too long; by the end viewers are wanting for it to end.",1473292800,3,2483,4.914081145584726
7606063,5,B01AJV0CSE,"Super annoyed that the reviews are not all 5 stars. . . but of course the 1 star reviews were all from people who ordered it either in a language they don't speak, or for a region they don't live in.  These are not ratings about the film itself. . .so annoying!
It's a fabulous film with just the right mix of great story dark humor and revenge. . . great script. . .and fabulous acting.  The Judy Davis performance as Mad Molly (Tilly's mom) is just what we have learned to expect for this great actress.  Winslet is amazing.  But it is Hugo Weaving as the secret cross-dresser, Sergeant Farret that sets just the right tone for this wacky and yet very touching story.
Now I've read the book, as well as Rosalie Ham's Summer At Mount Hope. . .which we can hope will also be a film?
I've already watched The Dressmaker three times. . .each time seeing something new. . .like any work of art.",1472342400,5,891,4.285714285714286

Great movie. Very odd story in a good refreshing way. Kate Winslet is absolutely brilliant herre.  Stunning!",1471910400,3,283,5.266666666666667

8747560,5,B01AJV0CSE,"I tend not to read plot descriptions before starting a movie. Or at least, I try not to take too much stock in them. I am glad I did that in this case, as the plot description only detailed a very small part of what this movie was about. It didn't mention the main idea at all and if I had fully believed it, I would have been thoroughly disappointed. As it is, I was pleased. The script was lovely, excellent story, and entire slew of fantastic actors, and a plot that goes much deeper than led on in the description. Uplifting? Not really. Good story? Absolutely.",1537056000,,565,4.289719626168225
8747561,5,B01AJV0CSE,"Set in a small town in Australia.  Wonderfully written and acted!
We absolutely love it, I have watched it 3 times, it's that good!",1536969600,,131,4.458333333333333
8747562,5,B01AJV0CSE,"Highly engrossing, placing the petty sleepy town in the harsh Australia Outback gave every stroke of the plot an understated power.  It was the perfect backdrop for stunning characters, each wholly formed humans whether likable or hated.  Winslet was completely on point, hard and seasoned without ever turning cold or vindictive. Her vulnerability to seek her mother's recognition slowly through the course of the story brought me to cheer her on.  Her plea for absolution from the despicable town only to be deprived on the verge of happinesses snatched away, viscerally hurt.  The movie delivered.  The inanity and vacuousness of the town characters were the perfect foil for real life tragedies--the movie never risked being maudlin for a moment.  The writer and director skillfully achieved their poetic justices without any hint of contrivance.  And The Dressmaker did not sell out for anything less than our protagonist's private freedom in the end.",1536883200,,956,5.291390728476821

8747566,5,B01AJV0CSE,"I have watched it several time and pick up more detail with each watching.  I never tire of it.  The setting and characters are a classic snapshot of real small town dynamics in the 50's.  A wonderful story about searching for the truth and righting wrongs with a humorous and sad twist. I found this to be a spectacular movie filled with joy and tears but closure as well.  Not sure why all the reviews aren't 5 stars, acting is amazing, plot is wonderful, music is fitting and it all comes together seamlessly to make a beautiful movie that will leave you sad but happy too. So many movies leave you wanting more; this movie is so whole and complete there are no loose ends that leave you hanging. Absolutely worth every minute.",1536796800,,730,4.466165413533835

8747568,5,B01AJV0CSE,"Not sure what I was expecting, but this delivered much more. Life lessons, human drama, entertaining humor all in one package! Played as a fable/fairy tale, this movie keeps moving and doesn't always play out in a predictable way. But even the tragic parts are woven into the overall plot in a way that works in the end. Characters are well placed and dealt with by the end. Good balance of reality with fable. I will watch again.",1536796800,,430,4.5256410256410255
