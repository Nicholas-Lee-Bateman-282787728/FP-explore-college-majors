531932,4,6303002781,"Story of An Endless Night  is about a girl wakes up in a hotel room naked alone and don't remember what had happened to her.  So she seek help from her friend and attempt to solve the puzzle.  Good ideas but poor execution.  Overall, the story is not the main selling point of the film, but the sex is.

Well this is Ovidies film, which mean more sex, less story.  She use a very thin storyline to link up all the sex scene.  All of them are explicit, steamy and hot but tastefully shot.  Cinematography and lighting are much better than Sex Story Trilogy. Since its directed by a female director, the film are shot from a female point of view.  That is to say the camera shot are focus on male body instead of the women.

The DVD also include a 24 minute short film  Les Appprentis Pornographes which consist of 3 sex scenes performance by two couples.

531983,5,6303002781,I must say I really enjoyed this unusual Agatha Christie story that was made into a film in 1972.  I was surprised that this was indeed an Agatha Christie story as it is quite different from her usual books.  The film is lovely to look at with some beautiful Italian and English scenary!  Hayley Mills and Hywel Bennett have never looked so good!  They make a truly beautiful couple and have a great chemistry going on. This was their third fim together and when you watch them act you will know why they fit so well together and teamed up three times!  The story will keep you guessing and the end is certainly a surptise.  A film you can watch over and over and still find something that you missed before.

531985,2,6303002781,"Mike Rogers (Hywel Bennett) is a handsome chauffeur. Ellie Thompson (Hayley Mills) is a very wealthy orphan who is over-protected by her aunts and uncles and such. And, it turns out, also by her German tutor turned close friend, Greta (Brit Ekland).

Mike loves beautiful things, and beautiful women. Ellie does not tell him she is filthy rich until he reads about it in the newspaper. He's very angry that she did not tell him, and complains of injured pride. But she brings him around, defies her family, and marries him.

The cover brags that only 3 out of 100 in the audience guesses the ending, but one large clue is offered at the outset. The story is being told by Mike to his psychotherapist in a posh sanatorium. We early on get the fact that whatever has happened drove him crazy. Another clue is a quick glimpse of him destroying a motto on the wall that has a huge eye and words to the effect that God is watching me.

Why only two stars? The plot is a rather typical Agatha Christie mystery, but the mod style and setting rather grate on the nerves. Much of it is pretty predictable, even if the ending might not be. (As it happens, I did see the outcome coming, despite the cover's brag.) Most of the scenes involving Ellie's family are simply tedious, with caricatures rather than characters we can believe in.

The pace is surprisingly slow, and several technical elements are hard to believe. For example, the couple's architect friend builds them a fantastic modern home, but it is hard to believe in the technology employed, especially that it should function so smoothly and silently.

Still, I won't say my time watching it was wasted. I will say that if I had spent money to see it in a theater or to buy the DVD, I would feel a bit cheated. Still, there is another film from 1966 that stars Bennett and Mills called ""The Family Way,"" and I've ordered it. These two attractive young talents are the best thing about this otherwise rather disappointing movie.",1336608000,2,1980,4.566197183098591

532028,5,6303002781,"I'm not an Agatha Christie fan but I've always adored Hayley Mills in any movie. I'm endeavoring to collect all of her movies I have not yet seen. This movie was quite different than anything I have seen her in before and I have not read this book.

I personally don't think Spoilers applies to a movie this old, but if you are someone who doesn't want to know the details of a movie, you shouldn't be reading our comments... especially mine. So stop now if you don't want to know the film details.

There was a bit of Hitchcock intrigue in this movie. I was actually quite shocked by the drastic turn of events about halfway through the movie and even more surprised by the ending... and I'm rarely caught off guard like that but this movie caught me twice with the unexpected twists and turns of the plot.

But I didn't like the role they gave to Hayley Mills. She did a beautiful job playing this role, but we are accustomed to seeing her in Disney movies with happy endings and it was a little disturbing to see her end up in such a tragic turn of events. It was like killing off Pat Boone or Debbie Reynolds.

The silliest part of the movie was when she met her future husband and he commented about her being an American... then she responded with her British accent. I think I would have changed those particular lines in that movie. It stuck out like a sore thumb. Not Hayley's fault. It was the director's fault for not changing or deleting those lines with Hayley in the role.

The singer who they chose for Hayley's singing voice was much too old and too deep to be the singing voice of a young girl like Hayley was at the time. From the warble and oscillation, that singing voice sounded like an Italian opera singer, at least 20 years Hayley's senior. Certainly not a very young woman. The song really didn't add to the movie in any way. I'm not sure why they included this scene unless it was a special favor for the singer.

Although Hayley was quite a lovely young woman at the time, I would have to agree with one of the other reviewer's comments about anorexia. You could clearly see each rib bone in Hayley's chest above the neckline of her dresses. But also keep in mind that ""thin was in"" in the sixties and all of the girls wanted to look like ""Twiggy"" who was a very bone-thin, anorexic fashion symbol at the time... and all the males expected the same from the girls. Anorexia was not labeled and was actually encouraged in the 60's and 70's until Karen Carpenter died. It was not until then that public opinion went through a drastic change.

As with most older British movies, they have a bit of trouble clearly expressing the plot and continuity to the audience. There was not enough explanation of the conspirator's reasons or details on their prior collusion. The ending was also a bit muddy. It looked like they ended the movie in the middle of a scene.

It would have been a lot of help if they had included closed captioning or subtitles with this movie. Old movies like this didn't use dialogue coaches, so the actors would mumble and string words together in the local dialects from where they had grown up so it was difficult to follow from time to time, simply from lack of enunciation. It is possible that they could have digitally improved the sound as well.

There's no doubt the storyline was quite filled with surprising twists. I guess in my case, I just didn't care for seeing Hayley Mills end up as a casualty. I kept waiting for her to appear at the end, hoping her demise had only been a setup to trick the guilty into a confession.",1240358400,7,3578,4.409090909090909
532029,1,6303002781,I could not believe the rave reviews of this movie.  I bought the VHS several years ago.  I love Hitchcock and Haley Mills.  This movie is very bizarre rather than suspensful.

532030,4,6303002781,"REVIEW: Although it looks like some made-for-T.V. adaptation from the early 70's: ""ENDLESS NIGHT"" is actually quite a neat little thriller that is probably the closest Agatha Christie ever came to writing a bona fide horror story. It begins when a shiftless-yet-charming chauffeur falls in love and marries a rich American heiress, and together they build an extravagant modern house on a supposedly cursed lot called Gypsy's Acre. After moving in they begin to experience a host of supernatural occurances (along with the usual plethora of meddling relatives PLUS a nutty old lady who seems to be stalking them) that threatens their newfound happiness. Before long there is an accident, a death, a disappearance, and most definately a murder: but who or what is behind all the sinister goings-on at Gypsy's Acre? Is it truly cursed? Or is there a real human element of evil at work here? Director Sidney Gilliat does a fantastic job in building up the bits and pieces of the plot until the final horrific climax that fully lives up to the film's title. Along with the superb musical score by Bernard (""PSYCHO"") Herrmann: the cast itself is quite excellent (especially Hywel Bennett in the role of Michael the chauffeur, George Sanders as ""Uncle"" Andrew, and Per Oscarsson as the brilliant-yet-sickly architect Santonix), and the construction of Gilliat's screenplay is faithfully adapted from Christie's novel with every surreal plot twist intact.",1234915200,5,1448,5.165957446808511
532031,5,6303002781,"Hayley Mills and Hywel Bennett star as two young strangers who meet, fall in love, and get married. He is a former chauffeur, and she is an heiress worth millions. Of course, her family is against the whole idea, and their attorney (George Sanders) offers big money for a quick divorce! This does not bother these lovebirds. After all, their relationship is built on stronger stuff. It is a romance for the ages. Enter Britt Ekland (The Wicker Man) as Mills' old friend, and things really get interesting. Ekland moves in w/ the young couple, causing strain on the marriage. Plus, odd occurances begin chipping away at the tranquil atmosphere, causing a rising sense of dread. ENDLESS NIGHT has a nice, sudden jolt to it that takes us from a love story w/ vaguely mysterious elements, and hurls us into a story of greed, insanity, and murder. All of the characters are wonderful, especially Hayley Mills (whom I've loved since the original Parent Trap). As for the major twist in ENDLESS NIGHT, it is said that only 3 people in 100 can see it coming. I was (happily) in the vast majority who had their jaws dropped! Highly recommended...",1228089600,7,1137,4.71859296482412
532032,5,6303002781,This was just like the book written by Agatha Christie. I have read all of her books and this was the scarest and closest to reality. I couldn't believe there was a nude scene!!,1223942400,5,177,4.235294117647059
532033,1,6303002781,"With Hitchcock, Hayley Mills, Bernard Herrman, and Agatha Christie, this movie should be excellent, but it is terrible.  Very slow moving at the beginning, with a some what nonsensical ending this movie disappoints.",1214006400,2,215,5.515151515151516
532034,4,6303002781,"This 1970's movie is based on Agatha Christie's powerful and chilling novel of the same name--and apart from a few minor details, very little has been changed, which is pleasing as this is one of the Queen of Crime's most perfect stories and to monkey about with it would have been both unforgivable and unnecessary. The story is told in the engaging and direct voice of Mike, a young man who loves beauty but is too poor to realise his dreams--until the daty he meets beautiful, elfin Ellie who turns out to be an American heiress. The pair fall in love, marry and go to live on their lovely property, Gipsy's Acre, which Mike loves almost as much as he loves Ellie. For a time, it seems like Paradise--but the snake is already there, and soon, things begin to unravel. When death strikes suddenly, nothing will ever be the same again..
Born to sweet delight or endless night: that is at the heart of this haunting, frightening and extraordinary story, and the film faithfully recreates that atmosphere of foreboding and doom, as well as the sense of the fragility of beauty and happiness. Though at times it's a trifle hammily acted(i'd have given this film 4 and a half stars if I could--the half taken away for some rather leaden acting at times) the story is so powerful it overcomes that, and the result is a film that's not only watchable but quite haunting as well.",1210291200,23,1373,4.585365853658536
532035,4,6303002781,"This was a pleasant surprise. I've always liked Agatha Christie's unusual 1968 novel, but I'd never seen this 1972 British film version. Many critics (and fans) have given the movie high marks over the years, so I bought the DVD. Now I'm a fan, too.

ENDLESS NIGHT isn't your typical Christie ""whodunnit,"" but a dark, creepy psychological suspense story. Writer/director Sidney Gilliat, who worked with Hitchcock on THE LADY VANISHES and also made the wonderful GREEN FOR DANGER, was obviously influenced by the Master in his approach to it. The result is like a dream collaboration between Christie and Hitchcock, the two giants of suspense. We have the sinister house in the sinister small town, the Hitchcock blonde (a surprisingly good Hayley Mills, of all people), the flashbacks to childhood trauma, and the shocking twist ending. On top of that, we have one of the final musical scores from Hitchcock's favorite composer, Bernard Herrmann.

Hitchcock students, pay close attention to those flashbacks at the icy lake (SPELLBOUND), the scenes in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam (VERTIGO), and that wooden sign with the big eye painted on it that reads ""Thou, God, see'st me."" And check out the final scenes (PSYCHO).

No, ENDLESS NIGHT isn't as wonderful as any of those films, but it's one of the better ""homages"" to Hitchcock I've ever seen, and one of the better Christie adaptations, too. Try it.",1207267200,13,1403,5.038793103448276

532037,3,6303002781,"For lovers of Agatha Christie and Hayley Mills this is a ""should see"".

532087,3,6303002781,"I'd love to be able to rave about this quirky movie, but it has rather too many flaws to make it a real gripping chiller, and not enough real action. Although saying that, it's flaws are small, and some of it's minor parts are actually quite impressive.

The biggest hurdle to get over as you settle down to watch this film is the problem of just what sort of film is this trying to be? The story takes us on a rambling journey through the life of Michael, a lazy and not entirely honest drifter, who works mostly as a chaffeur - when he's not being fired for being too cheeky to the rich clients. Michael has a strange, listless life, in which he dreams of setting up home in a particularly beautiful spot he has found in the country. In between doing this and visiting his disappointed old mum, he meets and romances an attractive young girl called Ellie, and after a lot of, well nothing really, they marry and get an architecht to build a dream home for them in the idyllic location. It's after they move in that things start to go a bit wrong, which is good news for the viewer because almost an hour of the films running time is gone before anything other than the mildly diverting actually starts to happen.

I can't say any more about the plot, except that if you don't know the story you should hopefully be pleasantly surprised by a few twists in the tale. The film looks good, albeit firmly planted in the 1970's, especially the scenes that show the very dated mod-cons of the supposed ""dream house"". I'd say this is more than a character study than anything, with Michael being the main focus for your attention. Although many pointers are dropped into the film to suggest that Michael is teetering on the wrong side of insanity, he is played rather vacantly by Hywell Bennett, who, despite giving him the required air of instability, never takes us very far beneath the surface of the character. Despite the fact that Michael also narrates much of the tale with a voice-over, I still ended up very confused about his true character.

Hayley Mills makes a delightful heroine, despite a very poor US accent that all but disappears most of the time, but Britt Ekland makes little of the enigmatic Greta, which is a shame after the film makes such a concerted effort to telegraph the mysterious nature of this character before she ever appears on screen.

What helps the film rise above a rather lacklustre plot are some sumptuous outdoor locations, along with some very daring fast cuts and flashbacks to vivid imagery, such as Michael's childhood frozen lake tragedy, and his memory of an ominous wall-hanging featuring a large eye. Michael's other visions include a nightmare in which Ellie has no face, and another in which he encounters her beside a tree, frozen in a smiling pose almost like a shop mannequin, which I found very eerie. In fact the film as a whole is very good at being odd. It chucks in a few rambling minor weirdos like the crazy old lady, and the main characters are forever asking each other things like: ""Why is so-and-so riding his horse past our window even though he lives 15 miles away?""... These little oddities scarcely ever come to anything, but they do have the combined effect of making you think that everything is going to turn out very badly without ever actually spelling anything out.

The film belongs to a long-gone era of British pyschological thrillers from the 1970's, which I would suggest also includes ""Neither The Sea Nor The Sand"" and ""The Beast In The Cellar""... all cold, windy countryside based affairs with lots of atmosphere and earnest British character actors, but not a lot of box office success. ""Endless Night"" might entertain you on a wet afternoon, and probably best so if you are willing to give time a film that does not seem to fit into any particular genre.",1156809600,9,3833,4.606149341142021
532088,4,6303002781,"One of Agatha Christie's last and least characteristic novels, ""Endless Night"" doesn't feature either of her series detectives.  In fact, it doesn't really ask the question ""whodunit?"" so much as ""will the guilty ones get caught?""  The big problem with the movie is that Hayley Mills is so darn attractive (her future husband's first glimpse of her dancing in a field is heartbreaking)that you can't imagine anyone wanting to do her in, not even for a fortune.  Hywel Bennett, a former chauffeur, is one lucky guy.  Not only does he marry a beauty, but she's an heiress to boot.  And isn't that some kind of house their architect friend builds for them!  But when you have a list of co-stars that include an ultra-smooth George Sanders (in one of his last film roles), a disappointingly dowdy Britt Ekland, and an icy Lois (Miss Moneypenny) Maxwell, you know things are about to head south for the happy couple.

(My title comes from a line a Scottish customer says to our protagonist, Mike, while we see him at work at a filling station.)

I read the book ""Endless Night"" a couple years back ... it was my former girlfriend and now fiance's very favorite Agatha Christie novel, and she gave it to me to read as soon as she was done.  I found it a most unusual book ... very unlike the other works of her's that I had read, and a couple of months after I'd finished it I began to wonder if there might have been a movie based on it.  Though I didn't expect there to be, I was surprised to discover that there was ... Amazon wasn't selling it at the time, and so I managed to snag a new copy of of eBay for a very reasonable price.  My girlfriend and I watched the DVD very soon afterward, and we had rather differing opinions ... My girlfriend was less than enchanted, disliking the dated seventies-ness in particular, but I on the other hand enjoyed the film very much, for a number of reasons.

First off, as other reviewers have said here already, it's very reminiscent of the work of one of my very favorite filmmakers (if not my very favorite), Alfred Hitchcock.  The fact that Bernard Herrmann, a favorite composer of Hitchcock's, created the score for this helps support that feeling considerably (""Endless Night"" was, by the way, released the same year as Hitchcock's penultimate film, ""Frenzy"").  Great music ... very atmospheric, eerie, and evocative.

The second reason why this movie is so good has really to do with the story, which can of course be credited to Mrs. Christie.  A young but seemingly likeable-enough moped-driving slacker (Hywell Bennett, who has a face I just know I've seen somewhere else before) meets up with a very very very rich young and beautiful American heiress (the charming Hayley Mills) with a strangely British extended family (maybe we're just supposed to pretend they don't have accents) and her best friend, a German girl by the name of Greta (Britt Eckland).  If you haven't read the book and will be seeing the movie first, I'd better not say any more ... there are a lot of surprises in store for you, and I'd really hate to spoil them.  However, I should also mention the presence of the always enjoyable George Sanders in the role of Hayley Mills' uncle/lawyer, Mr. Lippincott (kids who were raised on Disney movies will recognize his voice as Shere Kahn's from ""The Jungle Book"").  Also, Swedish actor Per Oscarsoon is very memorable as a flamboyant architect who befriends Hywell Bennett (and seems to constantly be coming onto him, if you ask me).  Great cast, everyone.

In addition to the Hitchcockian direction and music, the cast, and story, there are a lot of little things that make this movie so memorable.  Throughout the film, from start to finish, are a number of bitingly humorous bits of dialogue, some creepy fantasy visuals (particularly, the faceless Ellie and the scarecrow mockup of the Gypsy woman), and effective and unsettling flashbacks (any of Bennett's childhood scenes ... does the first of them, with the drawing of the house, hint at some kind of abuse suffered at the hands of his father?).  Also, toward the end of the film when Bennett and Sanders are riding together in a car ... look in the rear windshield and tell me what you see reflected in it.

""Endless Night"" contains a fascinating story (even for those of us who know the end) and boasts some fine actors and production values.  It's not all that expensive, and even though there isn't a lot on the DVD in the way of extras (just a trailer) you'll still be getting a solid hour and forty minutes of uneasy entertainment.  It's a great movie to watch at night, and if you're anything like me you'll want to come back and revisit it every six months or so.  Read the book too!

532092,4,6303002781,"Before I discuss the film itself, I have to mention Bernard Herrmann's classic score.  At a time in his career when mainstream Hollywood turned its back on Herrmann, smaller, independent or British films embraced this veteran of the studio system days.  And here, in ""Endless Night,"" Herrmann did some of his best, most mature work.  The score is amazing, a symphony of synthesizers and orchestral music as only Herrmann could put together.  And who could forget Shirley Jones (dubbing for Hayley Mills) singing the title song adapted from the William Blake poem?  It is a lovely piece and deserves to be sung in concert venues.  Alas, this brilliant score--reflective of Herrmann's maturity and mastery of film music--is unavailable on CD.  So here, on DVD, you can hear it in the best form it has been available in for a long time.
As for the film itself, it doesn't ever reach the level of pathos and sad beauty of Herrmann's score, but it does have a memorable style all its own.  The script is competent, even inspired at times, and the whole thing feels less like Agatha Christie and more like the murky thriller territory Hitchcock worked in.  Hayley Mills is charming and lovely in her role; her presence here makes one wish to see more of this actress as an adult.  She has been criminally underused in film, but she adds grace and warmth to these proceedings (the warmth being especially welcome in this somewhat cold film).  Hywel Bennet is competent in his role, and Britt Ekland is less out-of-place in this movie than in others I've seen her in.  (Is it just me or does dear Britt always seemed dubbed in every film she's in?  Do they have to loop every one of her lines?)  The movie is a complex, intriguing mystery that is only somewhat undermined by the dated trappings of the sets, particularly that garish seventies house that is depicted as a dream home.  Overall, however, the film is shot quite stylishly and even if you figure out, as most discerning viewers will, the plot ahead of time, it still remains a solid character study and psychological thriller.  The dvd itself has few extras, but the transfer is the best I've seen and all in all, it confirms the fact the for mystery fans this is something of an overlooked gem.",1013212800,60,2249,4.67005076142132
532093,3,6303002781,"This was probably not the best choice of movies for the extremely talented Ms. Mills.  She deserves far better material. Still, the material is interesting.  There are enough twists and turns in this movie to keep you watching. The only mistake that I feel they made is the dubbing of her singing voice.  It just didn't sound even close to Ms Mills actual voice and was rather out of place in the film. The film was worth watching.",998006400,5,431,4.5
532094,3,6303002781,"""ENDLESS NIGHT""  Is this the best Agatha Christie film?  Many of her hard-core fans think so.
Maybe it's because it's not so much a ""who dunnit"" but rather a ""when's it gonna happen""?
Christie herself is said to have disliked this film version because of the brief nudity. (Bloody murder didn't phase her.  How veddy British.)
Hayley Mills, who may have been bulimic during her Disney years, looks stunning (borderline anorexic?) in the part of Ellie, a lovely, lonely and very wealthy heiress (is there any other kind?) who falls in love with a poor chauffeur.  Her marriage with someone far below her station is a cause of great apprehension to her family.  But we root for the vulnerable newlyweds, who move into a palatial country estate said to be cursed (is there any other kind?), because we know love conquers all.
As you might guess, there is a stunning plot twist at the climax that is truly shocking. It got me and I'm jaded!
George Sanders, Britt Ekland, Per Oscarsson and Lois Maxwell co-star in this dark tale with a 70's ambience.  The great music score is by legendary composer Bernard Herrmann.  Even though Hayley lip-syncs Shirley Jones' title song, I'm still not sure what ""Endless Night"" really means.  Sydney Gilliat wrote the screenplay and directed.
