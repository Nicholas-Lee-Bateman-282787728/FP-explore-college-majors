8605144,2,B00EFYB1IW,"Worst movies ive ever seen ,jess franco is the worst director of horror films ever , his rendition of O was terrible",1409961600,2,116,4.318181818181818
8605145,2,B00EFYB1IW,"Way over-rated.  Not anywhere near worth the price.  No point in watching more than once.  Might be desirable for persons who have never seen better.  I would trade it in if I could get the value ""New"" for it, which the trade in value is $15. but since I did view it once it is only rated ""Like New.'  and as such the trade in value is less than $3.00.  Not worth the bother.  I paid way more for this junk than it is worth so as a caution i recommend not buying this thing.  Disappointing.",1402358400,4,490,4.03125
8605146,5,B00EFYB1IW,"If you're a Jess Franco fan, you should get this.  All four titles come in it's own clamshell that, if bought individually on Amazon, would cost north of $100.  This cost me a little over $30.  The quality of the prints themselves are top notch and as an added plus, all 4 contain mini Jess Franco interviews which are as interesting as the movies. I have now seen around 40 of his movies this past year (been binge watching his movies - only 160 more to go) and would rate Macumba much better than average and O as better than average Franco flicks, Mansion middle of the pack and Emmanuelle a lesser effort. If your not familiar with Jess Franco, this is not the place to start though",1396742400,10,686,4.34375
