5718758,5,B00CEFVWUQ,The first time I watched this gospel play was online.  I enjoyed the story line.  We all need forgiveness and this play shows that not only we need to forgive others but our self as well so the Lord can begin the healing process in our life.,1410566400,,241,4.1063829787234045

5718760,3,B00CEFVWUQ,"This play had a lot to offer. The story line has been done before, but it had a good lesson in it. What made this score so low was the low budget feel of the stage props and the overly melodramatic performance of the actors/actresses. This is common with a lot of stage plays, but this takes it over the top.",1377216000,,308,4.065573770491803
5718761,5,B00CEFVWUQ,"This play was amazing. I did not expected it to be that good. This play touched my heart in a special way. I am not gonna lie, I cried a lil, I got so emotional because I believed the characters and they were so real. at first I thought it was going to be whack, I got my DVD at Walmart and thought buy a dvd to pass time and see something new. Its worth the money and I am well satisfied.",1374710400,5,389,3.7560975609756095
5718762,5,B00CEFVWUQ,"This play cannot be foreshadowed.  There are twists and turns, suspense, tears and laughter.  Just when you've think you've seen it and heard it all, you're hit with something else.  This is a MUST HAVE!  Some of the acting without having all of the big names.",1373328000,4,260,4.586956521739131

8580839,5,B00CEFVWUQ,"Pleasantly surprised on how well written, well acted, and great use of props this play displayed.  The saying which typifies this work comes to mind: ""Don't hate the player, hate the game"".  The character Roxanne Graves was ambitious and mature at an early age yet was a product of all the negative events she absorbed from her parents and the consequences incurred.  One of the truest things that is depicted is that life is not fair but God is just.  Things don't always work out with a happy ending.  Our growth and contentment only comes when we take accountability for our own actions, accept the consequences, and be willing to be present throughout the process.",1510617600,,668,4.773913043478261
