Although he wrote and directed a vast variety of universal and humanistic movies for decades, most film scholars agree that Ray hit an early peak in his `Apu Trilogy' from the late 1950's. When the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences decided to honor the Bengali filmmaker with a Lifetime Achievement Award, it was discovered that almost all of his `Masterworks' were in dire need of repair and restoration.

 ""The Song of the Little Road,"" the debut film of writer and filmmaker Priyanka Kumar is a fascinating and enchanting look at the restoration process of Ray's narrative masterpieces and of the need for continued efforts in this cultural goldmine. Interviews with film scholars, practitioners (Producers and Directors) and film restorationists are interwoven with tantalizing clips  including the only-recently released ""Devi"" (""Goddess""), that give a sense of the importance of preserving Satyajit Ray's gifts to all humanity. This Documentary is highly recommended to Ray followers, as well as to lovers of quality cinema and it's preservation for future generations.",1316736000,6,1222,5.387434554973822
