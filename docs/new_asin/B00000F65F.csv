Not only did this cartoon have great stories you actually LEARNED something at the end with Bluegrass and Copper Kid(the only annoying character). You were taught about the planets, stars, nebulas and such. You never see that anymore.",1059782400,2,283,4.916666666666667

7907084,5,B00000F65F,"I would give eight stars for this show. It is the best show I had ever seen. I LOVED this show a lot. I will give two thumbs up for this show. It tells and shows you how the heroic Silverhawks came to Limbo, and where Mon-Star was before he tried to destroy the Silverhawks. The meeting between Commander Stargrazer and the Silverhawks was good! It also shows how Lieutenant Quicksilver receives his bird pal, Tally Hawk. Tally Hawk's control panel was given to Quicksilver. It also shows their first ever confrontion with Mon-Star and the Mob.  All in all, it is a great show! I would give anything for this show! -sighed-.",972345600,8,624,4.522123893805309
