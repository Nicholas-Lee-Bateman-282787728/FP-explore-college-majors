BUT... so weirdly vague with unattached symbolism and too many unanswered questions...plot lacks follow through.

7771689,5,B01H1VTEMK,Good movie and an OK Western. Woody played the perfect part as the Cult type leader. Weapons seemed accurate to the period.,1528156800,,123,4.636363636363637
7771690,1,B01H1VTEMK,I could only watch for about five minutes before I had had enough of this gross misrepresentation of 19th century Texas. Hollywood thinks that it can defecate on whomever it desires. Maybe it can. But I refuse to patronize such dishonest trash.,1527465600,,244,4.833333333333333

7771692,4,B01H1VTEMK,"Hemsworth killed it. It's western The Most Dangerous Game, kind of. Really could have done something with Marisol's character.",1525046400,,126,5.684210526315789

7771694,4,B01H1VTEMK,"This is a solid Western Era film with Liam Hemsworth as David and Woody Harrelson as Abraham.  David is sent to Abraham's town to find out what happened to the relative of Mexican General Calderon.

The title is fairly misleading.  There are two duels in the movie but they really don't have much impact.

The acting is good and the storyline is fairly straightforward.",1523145600,,369,4.71875
7771695,1,B01H1VTEMK,"I gave this movie as much of my time that I could bare.  It was boring, confusing and a bit bizarre.  I would definitely not recommend this to anyone.  No, I take that back...I would recommend it to anyone suffering insomnia, this will definitely put you to sleep.",1523145600,,264,4.458333333333333

7771700,1,B01H1VTEMK,"I disliked EVERYTHING about this movie.  Ridiculous, plot is unbelievable.  So many unexplained things.  Six- shooter that fires 13 times.  Giving one star for the line, ""The only thing they will remember of you is me.""",1519948800,,219,5.0

7771704,5,B01H1VTEMK,"I saw this by accident, but it turned out for the best when I clicked on this movie & didn't bother to check it. I had no idea I had enthralled myself into a western. Woody Harrelson, I have never liked his acting, but I suppose he didn't look or sound like himself since he was young in this movie. Didn't recognize his voice & he has an unshaven look. No resemblance! I found this movie to be good enough to watch from beginning to end, although, I didn't like the beginning nor the end. The middle is what kept me hooked. The plot line was sufficient & there were not a lot of surprises in the Texas Ranger dealing with the villain. The wife of the ranger acted a little lacking in the mental areas & seemed to get along fine with the villain. The ending was not really dealt with, in regards to the Texas Ranger. All in all, it was a good movie with stellar acting all around.",1518393600,,880,4.152046783625731
7771705,5,B01H1VTEMK,This is a great movie! Very well acted and well written.,1517788800,,56,4.181818181818182
7771706,1,B01H1VTEMK,More crap from hollywood. Making out Christians to be murderers....nothing new here...move on.,1517443200,,94,6.3076923076923075
7771707,3,B01H1VTEMK,"I was really enjoying the movie until it started reaching the end. You introduce us to his wife, she ends up being a bargaining tool throughout the movie and even falls under some mysterious spell we'll never understand, to only at the end not even give us closure on what happens to her or if she was really under some so-called spell. You can't just build up a character that much to make them irrelevant at the end. I also really didn't get the whole concept of having a weak character such as the main villain's son fighting the hero. And they made the hero look naive at one point in the movie. Also, the monologue that the villain goes into didn't even sound all that great for a villain that is suppose to be deep. Good actors, great concept but left the ending lacking closure and real ""oomph"".",1517011200,,802,4.389261744966443
7771708,5,B01H1VTEMK,Great movie and acting.  Woody Harrison never fails to put on a good movie...,1517011200,,77,4.5

7771715,5,B01H1VTEMK,"Way better than what many of the reviews said. I love a good western and this one was good. It has solid acting, exciting action and gunfights, an original plot, and a great villain. Liam Hemsworth is wonderful as the hero, and yeah, he's very easy on the eyes. This film has a creepy, Twilight Zone vibe at times, but that was one of the things I really enjoyed about it. If you like westerns, I recommend it. 5 stars.",1515024000,,419,4.25

7771721,4,B01H1VTEMK,"My husband and I thought it was pretty good. The plot is a bit over the top but it is good enough to keep you on your toes. The acting is excellent. Woody Harrelson never ever disappoints. I recommend this movie to those who like westerns, which violence is a given, though it is just the right amount.",1513468800,,302,4.224137931034483

7771725,4,B01H1VTEMK,"Enjoyed the movie wish there was more to the ending... felt like the end could have elaborated tiny bit more on details. Overall its a different movie well worth the watch.

7771727,1,B01H1VTEMK,Really bad plot.  Waste of good actors.  Gratuitous violence although that may be an out of date term altogether.  Unrealistic premise that main character is a faith healer and a dealer in the most dangerous game.  Don't waste your time.  Vote by not watching for better writing.,1509840000,2,279,4.851063829787234
7771728,2,B01H1VTEMK,"A lame Hollywood metaphor.  Basically, white man bad.  All others good.  Better they should focus on the sexual predators in their midst than try to mix their ill-informed politics with their waning art.",1509840000,2,203,5.090909090909091
7771729,3,B01H1VTEMK,Boring. Too much conversation. Bad white men again.,1509408000,,51,5.5
7771730,3,B01H1VTEMK,Pretty weird. I feel like America is so out of touch with its own past that Hollywood has been filling the darkness with horror. This one is all mixed up and leaves too many unanswered questions.,1509235200,,195,4.444444444444445
7771731,3,B01H1VTEMK,"Woody Harrelson is great as a cult leader / human trafficking kingpin in an otherwise typical Western. But Hemsworth doesn't do much but stare blankly into the distance and serve as eye candy for his female admirers. The former is an accomplished actor; the latter is a model with next to nothing in the acting talent department. Story had a modern commentary on human trafficking, but otherwise a standard 'revenge the slain father' theme. It works, but it's nothing special.",1509062400,4,476,4.9625
7771732,1,B01H1VTEMK,Disgusting themes with very little plot line and mediocre acting. Not worth the time.,1508716800,,85,5.142857142857143
7771733,4,B01H1VTEMK,"I found it to different than other movies of like type. Of course the end result was somewhat expected, until the last couple of minutes. I still don't understand what happen between Liam and his wife, but that is more of a side story. I thought it was a pretty good movie. So far, I haven't really found anything good on prime, but this one, without giving spoilers, was actually decent.",1508371200,,388,4.47887323943662

7771739,2,B01H1VTEMK,I don't think this movie had anything good about it. I watched it because I looked at the actors who were in it.,1506297600,,112,3.9130434782608696
7771740,5,B01H1VTEMK,what a good movie...not many like this anymore...acting was great...I give it 5 stars...Woody has become a legend playing the role of sinister characters and Liam has stepped up to a top leading role and is as calm and as cool in this role as Mr. Clint Eastwood himself...5 stars,1506124800,,279,4.6
7771741,4,B01H1VTEMK,"Harrelson plays a chilling villain who Hemsworth hunts in this odd, brutal western with a grisly twist in the plot. The mystery revealed was delightfully entertaining. Harrelson nails the ice cold, occasionally charming, cult like mayor of his own frontier town whos business is supremely evil. Well done western.",1505433600,,313,5.408163265306122
7771742,5,B01H1VTEMK,"It surprised me, loved the duels between rivals.",1505174400,,48,5.125
7771743,1,B01H1VTEMK,"The major problem with this offering: Harrelson wasn't blown away much earlier by the captive daughter of the Mexican general to mercifully end this vile piece of trash. Considering the creepy commonalities of Harrelson's ""body of work"" and his celebrity persona, would any of you want him as a neighbor?",1504656000,,304,5.1
7771744,5,B01H1VTEMK,"A great DARK western in the mold of Unforgiven. A little typecast...sure, but easy to overlook with skilled writing and acting. Most westerns are over the top, this one fits snugly under the bed with Harrelson's boogeyman",1504483200,,221,5.0
7771745,4,B01H1VTEMK,"So predictably out of Hollywood, such leftist stereotypes; anyone related to the church is evil personified, anyone white is evil, the victims are all brown skinned. It was well directed, moved slow at first, but built up the pace nicely. The acting was excellent, I would have given it higher ratings if it were not for the dogma being preached in the background. Duels were outlawed in the US because of Aaron Burr, so no community would have condoned the way this started. The west was not a violent place in these times, the settlers banded together and helped each other, this was all pure fiction put over the eastern crowds in the 1800s to sell dime novels, and nobody ever wore a gun on their hip like that, it just never happened. So this was just more stereotyping that was not right. Mexicans who decided to stay in America after 1848 when the US had conquered all of Mexico and gave half of it back were given full citizenship and full property rights, which they did not have in Mexico. This totally ignores all that, the Mexicans here never wanted to leave, they loved the individual rights, the ones the left would love to take away from us now, like Free Speech, property rights, and freedom from search and seizure. Where were the African Americans? At the time of the Mexican War, half the people in Texas were black slaves. The Republicans freed them from the Democratic slavers in the Civil War in the middle of this story. All that was skipped over, like it just didn't exist.",1504396800,3,1497,4.568773234200743

Pros:
1. Great scenery, costumes, sets, makeup etc.

3. This is a good Western movie...if you like Westerns and I do. The problem is, Western movies are no longer popular and producers don't put a lot of money into them anymore. So, when I see one that is decent, I'm over joyed...hence, my 5-star rating.

Liam does a fine job as a Ranger as well. The setting and dressing for the characters were on point, and I loved the way the western times were captured in this film.

There is action, but that's not what this movie is about. This is a movie that forces you to think - and if you do think he makes - in rather interesting ways, some quite poignant points about violence, about choices and about morality.

The movie depicts some racist murderers, as well as Mexicans going across the US border, and having a conflict between the 2 groups. They present the story in a way to make the viewers associate the fictional conflict from the movie with a conflict in contemporary politics, but substituting the racist murderers from the movie with Republican Trump-supporters. A slight of hand. This is for the purpose of making the viewers oppose Republican policies and to hate Republicans.

Others criticized the writing because they couldn't understand the behavior of Kingston's wife after her encounters with Abraham.

He is to gather information on a charismatic and violent preacher who has been hunting, capturing, and killing Mexican nationals who venture across the border between Mexico and Texas. The US wants to stop the preacher and his followers before war is renewed between the United States and Mexico. The Ranger is brilliantly played by Liam Hemsworth with an equally excellent performance from Woody Harrelson as the preacher. The cast is uniformly fine and there are  many surprising moments as Hemsworth confronts and is confronted by the Preacher and his followers.
The movie has episodes of violence.  What really makes The Dual worth your time are the situations and character studies that emerge from those situations.",1497830400,,828,5.2180451127819545

7771876,1,B01H1VTEMK,"I like the cinematography in this film and the actors did great with the crappy story they had to work with.

The movie doesn't have a logical progression that a human can buy into.  Like Marisol's flip, the writers could have gone very psychological and add an eerie component to her transformation. Which could help us bond more to Liam's character at the helplessness he feels as his wife slips away and have that lead him to follow the guys to the human hunting area.
Instead, the way the movie lays out Marisol's change is comical, you get the flu and because he told you so, you instantly change your stance on the guy and start following him.  It's completely comical and a ""oh, she ""drank"" the kool-aid"" moment.  Absurd even for that period in time.

The movie also dragged on too long to get to the point, if the story was built out more to get the skin chill factor, it would justify the duration.  The movie just built up to nothing.  If I saw this in the theater instead of Prime, I'd be pissed at wasting the money.

The ending, felt like writers were in a room and said, well we did one twist, how about another and end it like that.
I thought this dumb trend was done in like 2007??

This was a complete waste of money to make and it's crazy, because the cast was a talented group and the story had potential.
I guess Hollywood has to keep people working somehow.  I will say, at least it's not another zombie movie.  Though, that would've been a third twist for this movie, since that was the trend here.",1497484800,,1520,4.3356890459363955

SPOILERS- Does Abraham really have the powers of foresight and imposing his will upon others?  He certainly seemed to have some influence over Marisol.  Did she really have a fever or was she under some sort of spell?  Or is it smoke and mirrors?  This never seems to be resolved.

The lead characters seem to do some silly and predictible things.  They have the ability to arrest, kill, or leave many times and nobody seems to take advantage of it.  Oh why go into detail.

Long segments of unnecessary exposition at the beginning and end of the movie.  And now for my pet peeves:  Marisol says she is ""Spiritual, not religious"".  What is she going to do next?  Tell us she thinks space aliens landed at Roswell?  This is just not something someone from 1888 would come up with.  And Harrelson is supposed to have been a Confederate soldier, but he goes on about the the ""battle of Bull Run"".  The Confederates called it the battle of Manassas.  The south named battles after local towns, the north named battles after natural features (Sharpsburg/Antietem, Shiloh/Pittsburg Landing).  And please get rid of the hoop skirts.

7771912,3,B01H1VTEMK,"While this movie is well-filmed and well-acted, it's so confusing and non-Western it's an oddity.  The dialogue is an odd combination of modern idioms and literary bombast, with even the most trivial statements seeming to have a sinister meaning.

 A Texas Ranger is assigned to infiltrate a town and discover the whereabouts of a Mexican governor's missing daughter.  His wife doesn't like the fact and convinces him to take hr along.  (What officer of the law takes a civilian, especially one he loves) on an undercover assignment?) They discover the town is a haven for a cult with The Preacher (who happens to be the man who killed the ranchers father 20 years before). The Preacher falls for the wife, welcomes them expansively and makes the ranger the new sheriff.  Shortly thereafter,. the wife begins displaying erratic behavior and it turns out she resents having been betrothed to the ranger without her permission though it's obvious he loves her.  David discovers The Preacher is running a despicable and deadly side racket.  Things then go from bad to worse.

From the first scene, this is a movie where the audience waits for something to happen, tension is built immediately, and quite a lot happens, but very slowly.  No one seems to be in a hurry to get to the title act...the duel, which, in retrospect, isn't a duel at all, so perhaps the title refers to the duel between The Preacher and David's father.  Who know?

While the performances are good and some people-you-love-to-hate performances are delivered by Harrelson and others, the characters themselves, with the exception of Alice Braga, are mostly cliches.  There's really not much background on the who and why.  Why did The Preacher fight a duel with David's father?  Where has David been all these years? What happened to the town and David's wife?  An entire population can't just vanish.  Even back then, someone would've noticed something.

At least in this one, they don't stand around talking.  When someone needs shooting, he gets shot and that's that.

The film is slow-moving in some areas, almost leisurely in its pacing.  By and large, it's a good movie, but one that will leave some dissatisfaction in the way the ending seems unfinished, tapering off into nothing.

What happened to his character in the 22 years between the first and second scene remains too much of a mystery.  The entire plot sort of depends on his motivations and his world view.  Woody did the best he could to flesh out the character more than what was on the sparse pages, but in the end I just wasn't buying it.  If you love Westerns, watch it anyway.  If you dislike liberals cramming thin silly allegories exaggerating the evils of the middle aged white man totally inconsistent with actual history, skip it.",1477699200,,674,4.767241379310345

7771982,2,B01H1VTEMK,"Woody Harrelson and Liam Hemsworth collide in this old west pressure cooker; a tale of justice, betrayal and revenge. In the years since squashing a grudge via gruesome, rain-soaked duel, Harrelson has moved himself south, taken on a cult of personality and established a small, isolated town of thrall-bound civilians. It's a good turn for Woody, showing that he works with a versatile set of skills and can pull off complex menace with ease. There's something sinister brewing behind the dark eyes and white wardrobe, but we only catch a glimpse. When Hemsworth arrives in town, both a Texas ranger come to enforce the law and an orphaned son seeking retribution, the table seems set for fireworks. Instead, things grind to a halt and we trudge through a long, drab series of blunt manipulations and hollow conversations for an hour before the plot finally, abruptly, leaps back to life. The dramatic shifts in tone don't work, and the climax feels like it was lifted, bit by bit, from another film entirely. Hemsworth isn't able to match his co-star's depth, either, and that makes their clash of personality a relatively one-sided affair.",1475452800,,1142,4.984293193717278

In ""The Duel"", the ""hero"" (played by a forgettable pretty boy) is a Texas Ranger who goes into a town undercover to investigate alleged murders.  A diabolical, charismatic cult leader (Woody Harrelson) controls the town.  Our hero takes his beautiful wife with him because she complains that she doesn't get to see enough of him.  Are you kidding me?  What an idiotic plot device!  Woody Harrelson does his best as the evil cult leader, but there is no making this crap sandwich ""tasty"".

Abraham runs the town in a cult-like fashion wearing cult white when we first see him again. David is offered the job of sheriff, which he doesn't take lightly.

The acting was good and the film had a few good scenes. You kept waiting for the inevitable conflict and revealing of identity which was slow in coming. David's wife was a confusing mess.

8764426,3,B01H1VTEMK,"A brooding revisionist western, which indulges in negative stereotyping and implausible scenarios to drive a modern socio-political narrative. In many ways, this production is a poor retelling of Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness with some of the existentialist trappings of John Milius's adaptation of Conan The Barbarian. While not a bad film, neither is The Duel a good one. It might best be summarized with the interjection ""Meh"".",1532736000,2,434,5.397058823529412
8764427,2,B01H1VTEMK,They tried the give Coppola feel with Col. Kurtz mannerisms. Then I got natural born killers vibe with the senseless killing with his bold face and closeups.

Though I don't see this movie as a ""Western"" nor do I think Woody should travel in the path of Western movies I must say the cards were dealt in a winning hand with ""THE DUAL""! Such great actors combined with a great screenplay will have you pleading for the movie not to end. It's just a shame that the greatest of anything in history nearly always end up underrated seemingly because the masses prefer cheaper, louder, and tasteless over Quality.... Well done with this great movie!",1529452800,,654,4.413223140495868
