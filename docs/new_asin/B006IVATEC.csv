Look at ehr IMDb and see tons of crappy movies nobody sees and as usual the positive reviews are her and her loser friends.

If you have the choice of a free Devanny Pinn movie or a bag of crap, take the bag.",1380326400,,327,4.258064516129032
8498896,3,B006IVATEC,"Got this for the scream queens featured in it..not really sure what i was expecting but it ended up being pretty good! Really great collection of different types of horror and showcased some interesting upcoming filmmakers. Probably could have used more of a budget, but all around worth supporting.
Devanny Pinn and Suzi Lorraine were hot in it! I'd buy Volume 2 if they made one.",1371168000,,381,4.787878787878788
8498897,5,B006IVATEC,"this was a great collection of shorts. any horror fan should enjoy watching these independent movies, actors and filmmakers doing what they do best.",1353110400,,148,5.208333333333333
8498898,3,B006IVATEC,"This was a fun and entertaining 'no-budget' horror anthology with a few interesting twists here and there. The real stand-outs are the highly underrated horror duo of Devanny Pinn and Brandon Slagle who always deliver electrifying performances and I predict that they will both become well known actors in due time. Brandon is the deeply demented madman and Devanny is his lovely victim in a stylistic segment that is eerie, haunting and beautiful and it's easily the best segment of the movie. Some of the shorts are experimental and bold while others are just quick fixes for horror junkies (like myself) but I've seen much worse as far as 'no budget' movies go.

This is an admirable attempt at creating a gripping horror anthology but these guys just need more of a budget and better oversight of dialog delivery. Some of the actors sound like they are reading directly from a script and the lines come across as stiff, lacking the subtle nuances of real conversations. A little more casual style in dialog goes a long way towards credibility. Still, I hope they keep making more of this series because this is an interesting start.",1347667200,,1136,4.825641025641025
8498899,1,B006IVATEC,"Well don't go by the cover or the trailer there is a sprinkling of nudity. The horror is really dated, i wasted my money to help all of you save it .....",1332979200,6,153,3.8125
