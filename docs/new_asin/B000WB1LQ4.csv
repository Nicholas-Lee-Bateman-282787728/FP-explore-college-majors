It is not that difficult even for older people, but when I finish, I can feel that I was exercising. It is little over 30 minutes . She has nice and appropriate music to go with all  exercises. I just love it ! She uses weights in some parts, which is a big plus.",1513468800,,386,4.065789473684211
8222022,4,B000WB1LQ4,"Great introductory exercises for my mother who moves very little. There are a couple of things I do not have her do right away, but it gets her started on her feet.",1457740800,,164,4.15625

8222024,4,B000WB1LQ4,"I was a skeptic when I started with Safe on Your Feet. It was a gift from our daughter-in-law and recommended by my brother, so I had to give it a try. After catching on to it, I found it beneficial, and I'm still benefiting, after moving on to Safe and Fit, which is OK, but too long. I'm starting now on Safe and Strong. These are good exercises for me, with age 80 just around the corner.",1326844800,5,391,4.0256410256410255
8222025,2,B000WB1LQ4,I bought this for my elderly parents. When I went to see them I plugged it in and thought we would all do it together. I was just OK. The music was good but the steps were very fast. Some of the movements they did in a chair and some they did standing with their walkers. One movement that really was very hard and made me worried was deep forward lunges. Yes lunges! I am in pretty good shape but lunges hurt my knees and I think is was a dangerous move to put that in a dvd that many seniors will watch. I would not recommend this dvd for any older adult.,1309910400,3,557,3.938053097345133
