530452,4,6303000649,"This is a fun little diversion for swashbuckling fans. D'Artagnan (Cornell Wilde), Aramis (Lloyd Bridges), Athos (Jose Ferrer), and Porthos (Alan Hale Jr.), prove they still have what it takes to be heroes as King Louis XIV  (Beau Bridges) tries to eliminate his twin brother (Beau Bridges) and marry  the infanta of Spain. The sword work is not quite as sharp as good Bob  Anderson work or as excitingly realistic as William Hobbes, but there is  plenty of it in a variety of creative scenarios. It is fun to watch the old  actors Ferrer and Bridges work together as Hale tries to keep up and Wilde  holds himself aloof. Ursula Andress adds camp appeal as the king's lover.  Olivia de Havilland adds credibility in a cameo as the King's mother. There  is also a good deal of political intrigue and mistaken identity to keep the  story moving along.
Trivia: The role of Athos, here played by Jose  Ferrer, is played in the recent ""Man in the Iron Mask"" by John  Malkavich. There is another pair of  historical sword-fighting movies set  in France where these two actors play the same character. In ""Joan of  Arc"" with Ingrid Bergman, Ferrer plays the Dauphin. The same role was  played by Malkavich in ""The Messenger: the story of Joan of Ark""  with Milla Jovovich.",947635200,12,1265,4.681818181818182
530561,2,6303000649,"I saw this in the theatre on opening weekend many years ago.  I didn't like it then, and still don't like it.  I had a hard time understanding why an all star cast of older actors I recognized from many a 1960s TV show were in this film.  I got the fact that the musketeers were all supposed to be older, but I didn't understand why I didn't see I wasn't seeing the actors from the previous films in makeup to age them.

It bothered me then, and even knowing what I know about money and budgets for flims...it still bothers me.  There was money for props, costumes, sets, and actors who had talent.  But the film didn't have the zest of the Salkind productions, and felt very flat in the end (which was exceptionally tragic).

Fortunately there is a third installment using most of the orginal cast, and directed by Richard Lester no less, but it took lots of cajoling to get that production off the ground, and I'm sorry to say that it too is a bit flat, but it is by far a superior production to this film.

See this film if you must, but don't say I didn't warn you.",1399334400,,1069,4.205882352941177

That scene along with a naked scene by S. Kristal were not on my DVD. Those scenes were left out.

530566,4,6303000649,"Since I was a kid, some 50 years ago, I am fascinated by the Alexandre Dumas stories about the Musketeers. First by reading the books and later by watching the movies. The 5th musketeer is well filmed and the story is very captivating though somewhat different from the book ""The man with the iron mask"". I am still waiting for a DVD of the movie ""The return of the musketeers"" (1989).",1200614400,,385,4.436619718309859
530567,4,6303000649,"It's frankly beyond me why the so-called ""uncensored"" version has never been released in the U.S., even with this new DVD version.  I have seen the full-length version on Region 2 DVD (readily available for anyone with a DVD player capable of running Region 2 discs), and, as other reviewers have noted, the ""juicy"" scenes truly don't have anything that would be particularly shocking in this day and age. (If one considers the sight of the beauteous Ursula Andress and Sylvia Kristel in the nude to be a tremendous shock, one probably needs to get out more. :) ) More to the point, the uncut version (which, by the way, is available in English) makes more sense and flows better than the ""censored"" version - to the tune of 15 minutes' worth of additional footage, most of it _not_ sex-related.  Several important conversations, as another reviewer noted, are sliced up because one scene or another showing a little more of Kristel or Andress than was considered proper were removed to get a PG rating in the US.  A shame.

If you can get ahold of the uncut version and can play it, do so.  This is quite a good movie with lots of good performances, including turns by several mainstays of classic Hollywood - the great Rex Harrison in one of his last roles and Olivia de Havilland as the mother of Louis XIV, to name two.  There's all the sword action you could expect from a Musketeers movie.  Andress drips sex and menace as the scheming mistress of King Louis, while Kristel (best known, of course, as Emmanuelle) is sweet and winsome as the Spanish princess dispatched to marry the King who ends up falling for his lookalike.  Beau Bridges makes a good foppish Louis, but I'm not sure he's quite dashing enough to play Philippe, the lookalike; however, he gives it the old college try and acquits himself decently.",1186617600,7,1820,4.64797507788162
530568,5,6303000649,"Just look at the cast for this fun and entertaining adaptation of ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" story. Not only do we have Beau and Lloyd Bridges, but also Rex Harrison, Olivia De Havilland, Jose Ferrer, Cornel Wilde and Ursula Andress but there are also actors who have achieved even greater fame since this movie was released in the 1970s such as Ian McShane and Sylvia Kristal.

 The Dumas story had been adapted for the screen before and since (in the weak Leonardo DiCaprio movie), but never has it been so much fun and so entertaining to watch.

 The crew were obviously all having a great time making this movie and it really shows, there is humor, action and suspense right to the last moment and the DVD transfer is a good one that will not leave you dissapointed.

 One reservation I do have is the lack of extra's for the price tag. We are only given a smattering of trailers for movies such as ""From Here to Eternity"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia""...Still, this is a great movie and well worth adding to your collection.",1090454400,4,1024,4.478494623655914
530569,4,6303000649,"This movie is loaded with stars, Ian McShane, Ursula Andress, Beau Bridges (in the duo role) and Lloyd Bridges, Alan Hale Jr., Cornel Wilde, Rex Harrison, Olivia de Havilland and Jose Ferrer.  The costumes are scrumptious and the locale work all help this movie along.  It?s good to see the old 50s movie stars having one last swashbuckle!  Bridges is miscast and nearly sinks the movie, and the directing is stiff, but everyone does a good turn in the old Man in the Iron Mask story.  McShane seems to have fun as Fourquet.

The much-filmed Dumas tale has the Philippe, twin brother of the King of France, raised and protected by the Musketeers.  Fourquet, acting for the King, has the twin arrested and hidden by the iron mask.  He plans to use the twin as a decoy in public, and kill him with a bomb.  Then when the King surprisingly survives the attempt, it?s supposed to make everything believe he is invincible.  Only the musketeer is Johnny-on-the-spot to foil the plot, save their ward and then pull the switch by stuffing Louis the King in the iron mask and place Philippe on the throne of France.

It?s a good transfer.  Just a shame the younger Bridges hurt the effort in the dual role and the directing could not have been stronger.",1090281600,10,1244,4.583710407239819

7833477,1,6303000649,"If you have read Alexandre Dumas, it's going to be quite painful to sit through this movie. First of all, like most adaptations of Le Vicomte de Bragelonne, the film simplifies the plot of the novel and creates a ""good king/bad king"" opposition that readers will not find anywhere in Dumas's writing, and if this were not enough, it takes the creative liberty of assigning Colbert, one of the least likable characters in the novel, the exactly opposite role, turning him into the hero's protector. Second, it seems like the producers did not invest a penny in a history consultant. The weapons belong to the 17th century, some of the costumes (the uniforms, for example) belong to the 18th century, and some others (like the carriages) to the 19th century. Add to this a Spanish princess traveling on a 15th century caravel, she dressed like a Jane Austen character and her counselor like a crimson cockatoo at a time when Spain still believed that in matters of fashion black was the new black, and you have a pastiche of four hundred years of improperly-read history crammed into a single ""period piece."" So unless the movie is trying to tell us that d'Artagnan and his friends stayed alive for four centuries (way to show the viewer ""immortal characters""), it's just a case of very bad choice of costume and prop designers, null research, poor reading of the original material, and weak and lazy script writing.",1477180800,3,1414,4.799180327868853
