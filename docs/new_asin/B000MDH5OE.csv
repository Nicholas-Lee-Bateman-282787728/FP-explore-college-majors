waiting for blu ray also for this
but over all very good print",1386979200,,106,4.095238095238095
8179273,4,B000MDH5OE,"Yes, it's ""Reservoir Dogs.""  Yes, it does lag at times.  But seeing Amitabh Bachchan and Sanjay Dutt, who've had long careers as Bollywood heroes, shredding the scenery as foul-mouthed criminals is terrific fun.  (The subtitling in the theatre didn't do justice to some of the riper swearing, by the way.)  If you aren't familiar with their careers (and with Sanjay's real-world legal problems, to which there is a sneaky and very funny reference), it's worth a few minutes to look them up.",1132790400,4,490,4.939024390243903
8179274,3,B000MDH5OE,"I saw this movie when it came out on DVD, and I was very pleased at how this movie was made, and how different it is from other hindi movies. I thought the storyline was amazing. A few days later, I found out the movie is a direct copy of the English film Reservoir Dogs, and that pretty much all the scenes from Kaante were taken directly. When I heard about that, I was completely disappointed and bummed that the movie I was raving about was not as original as I had hoped.

Besides that, I think the movie was well made, and that all the actors did an amazing job, especially Sanjay Dutt and Mahesh Manjrekar. Kumar Gaurav, Lucky Ali and Sunil Shetty do an okay job, and are there to help complete the story. Amitabh Bachchan does his typical style, and as normal, pulls it off really well. Malaika Arora isn't even that hot either. I don't know why they picked her.

The movie was taped completely in Los Angeles, which allows people who live in America something to relate to, because the movie is so modern.

Besides the whole idea of them copying the concept from Hollywood, I think this movie is worth the money, because everyone does a good job, and its not your typical hindi movie.",1113696000,5,1193,4.389140271493213
