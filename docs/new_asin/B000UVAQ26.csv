8215085,5,B000UVAQ26,"I really loved this movie. I believe the setting and story was when the Chinese government went to a Communist Society. It is about two women who fall in love in China.  One is the daughter of a botanist who is very knowledgeable having been her father's student all her life. The other is a woman who wishes to learn from this very renown botanist. The father doesn't like the new student, but his daughter helps her to learn. The scenery is spectacular. The director did a wonderful job showing the development of the two women's love. The acting was superb. I don't want to spoil the plot so I will stop here; however, I would rate it as a very artistic well done film. It is a film that all over 13 will enjoy. It is a very beautiful, but sad story. Still, comparing it to other Lesbian films, I would rate the quality of story, acting, and production higher than films the higher quality lesbian genre. There is a lot of low quality lesbian films out there, but this is not one of them. It is a simple, but beautiful love story.",1371859200,2,1033,4.324742268041237

8215089,5,B000UVAQ26,"I was deeply heart-broken with sudden apathetic ending, Lamenting what the local authority has done to the two lovely young adults. For a child began the life finding herself all alone with star crossed ill fate, Li Min seemed  so sweet without mean twist in her personality. She has also began developing respect for virtue of hard working. What else could you ask to a child who have survived  through such a catastrophic disaster?  Being a sole survivor escaped from such a catastrophic earthquake that killed a quarter million people and found herself all alone at daybreak on  4 a.m., July 28, 1976. She has now grown to be a lovable young adult. Her preference seeking a female companion was  really a negligible issue in the modern world. Love relationship between women has been accepted practice in the both Western and Eastern Imperial Courts amongst high ranking Court Ladies in Waiting (Japan in particular and later in Sweden). The two girls  deserved every rights to be happy with the person she loves.  I grew up in Kyoto, Japan. Contrarily to common belief, before the paternalistic authoritarianism ever had any chance to come in effect, there were  four contiguous centuries long historic period called the He An Era (794 - 1185 A.D. meaning the time for peace and tranquillity) where contemporary feminist scholars including art, poetry and literature flourished in Japanese Imperial Court. It is often considered the peak of the Japanese culture particularly in women scholars. I have actually seen a 900 years old priceless silk screen with two young lovely noble born court ladies in waiting (in resembling Li Ming except waring summer Kimono attires) holding their hands on Great Gojo Bridge watching fireworks together on a summer evening. I have always been a straight male but I was so impressed by its poetry like beauty. There were diary written by a high ranking court lady of noble birth referencing her adoration on sovereign princess whom she served  with words like ""moist lips"","" full figure"", ""beautiful breasts"", ""silky skin"", ""perfect complexion"" time after times in her diary. Li Ming would have had a perfect respectable position in the Court. Women were allowed to sleep in the same bedroom, to bath together and to enjoy themselves much more openly in Japan before the dark age. The pathetic repression caused upon young adults by The Chinese Cultural Revolution was devastating and totally unrealistic in the context of humanity. Sadly in term of humanity 1980's China was 900 years behind from it's neighbouring country Japan.

Since the beginning of civilisation, philosophers, psychologists, many scholars and like had debated against the superiority of love that a woman can offer to all of man kinds (to both men and to women). I personally view that of women are definitely superior to the others. Since the majority of us do not experience temporary loss of vision or complete loss of consciousness due to deep sedation for major surgery such as open heart or open skull procedures. Using artificial Heart and Lung machine, often the heart is removed outside the sternum whilst surgeon can work on.  Such a  procedures can cause tremendous trauma to your psyche.  It is not unusual for patient and nurse to develop an almost like loving attachment to each other from the moment the nurse transfers you from a rolling bed to a recovery bed, then calling your name and caressing you as if rescuing you from desolated realm of unconscious.  If you compare it with the same task performed by male surgical assistants at operating room ,you will be quite  impressed with the fact that a woman's love is a priceless enlightenment.  It is highly likely that someone like Li Ming already had intuitively known the enlightenment that only a woman can bring to her soul. Every female child has dreams of being swept up into a great adventure, of being the beautiful princess. Lamentably, when women grow up, they are often swept up into a life filled merely with demands, duty and responsibility. Many women are tired, struggling under the merciless pressure to be of a faithful servant, or a caregiver for children, husband or authoritarian father and like.  I have known an award winning blind female writer  back in Japan and her nurse companion who helped her publishing her novels until the end of writer's life at age 72. The nurse companion  died next summer found afloat on River Kamo during Gion Festival (Buddhist Spiritual Revisiting season) leaving a will to be buried next to the writer. In fact I have seen them twice together on the stone bridge across a pond within the property of an ancient 10th century Buddhist temple in 1970's. Nurse were eyes to the writer and describing everything that the nurse can see. The both women looked very beautiful radiating the glory of love between them. They both were descendant of ancient noble families go back to 11th century and their presence seemed to enhance the tranquillity of the mid-autumn setting.  I could not help but wishing their happy union forever from the moment I saw the strength and intensity of woman's love.  It has forever changed my attitude about beauty of woman's love. So let's pray that the god (Amida Buddha) grant the two young women an eternal tenure in the pure land of perfect bliss (Heaven by Chinese Buddhism), and let them pursue their happiness!

There are not many talented directors today who can portray women's beauty and their sentimental emotion as exquisitely as virtuosic savant Director Dai Sijie. It was further enhanced by an exceptionally lovely persona of Li Min played by Mylne Jampano makes it so hard not learning to love her. A 19 Century librettist Honore de Balzac stated that ""A Woman's beauty is a priceless treasure"" The statement aptly applies to  her in every aspects. Since I read and speak Chinese and French, Opening narration by Li Min regarding the unfortunate loss  of her parents when she was only three years old, understanding it alone shed my tears. It was much more so painful to listen to her reading the last letter sent to the head mistress of orphanage ""put our ash on the surface of the lake by the temple so that we can stay in peace""  What a merciless world is it? It made me so sad that I could not listen to the very end. It really broke my heart to acknowledge that  they are no longer together in this world.

Outstanding sound effects also did many wonders to make this film soooo beautiful and appealing.  Music score sounds very much like Variations of Johann Pachebel's Canon in D re-arranged by Jean Franois Pillard in 1978 or French Opera Castor et Pollux (Twin sons of Jupiter) Act 1 by Jean-Philippe Rameau 1737 now often performed by Opera  Paris and Les Arts Florissants But Virtuoso composer Eric Levi's score mimics flowing harmony of Tristes apprts sang by Telaire in tragdie en musique  la Rameauneurse was much more perfect for the simultaneously romantic and tragique context of the film. This DVD has become my Favourite of my entire collections (Mostly consist of Asian Horrors such as Kwaidan, Pulse and The Eyes) I perhaps never forget about this devastatingly romantic beauty of this film and Actors, Director, Cinematographer, Composer and likesfor the rest of my life.

8215090,4,B000UVAQ26,"""The Chinese Botanist's Daughters"" follows the story of Min Lin (Myl&egrave;ne Jampano) and Chen An (Xiao Ran Li), the titular ""daughters."" When Min Lin, orphaned young, is allowed to study medicine as intern at the botany of Professor Chen. There Min Lin meets Chen's lonely daughter Chen An, who works for her demanding father. The two females find themselves attracted to each other and vow they will never part, not knowing what await them in the future.

The story, set in mainland China of the 1980s, is simple at first sight and there seems little character development in it. You know for sure that Min Lin and Chen An would fall in love with one another when they meet (thanks to effective acting from the two leads) and actually they do. What changes is the world surrounding them, namely, the botany (original Chinese title), place of which equilibrium has been kept strictly until Min Lin (whose mother is Russian; who mistakes poisonous plant for herb) arrives.

The film is a love story with symbolism and allegory, but some part of it remains elusive, some obvious. That should not exactly be called a flaw, but as to the two slightly stereotypical male figures, I think the director could have done something, especially An's brother. Perhaps some viewers (including me) would want the film end in another way because one final event, at least to me, looks a little incredible. But I don't know. Hopefully someone who actually lived (lives) in China would enlighten me.

The film is certainly not perfect, but it worked for me. And I was impressed with the talent of two leading ladies, too.

""The Chinese Botanist's Daughters"" is a follow-up of director Sijie Dai's Golden Globe-nominated ""Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress"" made in 2002. As you can see, the breathtakingly beautiful landscapes of the film are actually shot in Vietnam as unlike ""Balzac"" Chinese government refused to give permission to shoot in the country. Interestingly, the script was changed for the lead French-born Myl&egrave;ne Jampano (whose father is Chinese). The beautifully shot photography also contains brief nudity.",1198886400,6,2122,5.037037037037037

8215092,5,B000UVAQ26,"One of the best films I saw at a foreign film festival!  By the same director who brought us&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Balzac-and-the-Little-Chinese-Seamstress/dp/B000AYELXI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress</a>, this is an outstandingly lush film, very sensuous with gorgeous greenery and flowers (the botanist's lush gardens) and scenery that can't be beat, actually filmed in Vietnam rather than China.

A young woman receives the honor of studying with the foremost botanist in China. For her internship, she stays at the home and botanical gardens of the old botanist who has a lonely daughter whose main task is caring for her father.  The two young women become inseparable, yet live in a culture that does not accept their love, so they must find a way to stay together.

According to the director, the ending is inspired by actual events.  Beautifully done film! Released by MAX Films from Quebec.",1186617600,10,989,5.793103448275862
