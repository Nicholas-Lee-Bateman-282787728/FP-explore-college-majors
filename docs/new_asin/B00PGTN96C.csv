8687824,4,B00PGTN96C,"Naturally the first of its kind it is very funny. Ted Stroehmann had a slight accident requiring Magda (Lin Shay) to do a little triage. This messes up his prom night with Mary Jensen. Mary moves to is last scene moving to Florida. Later in years he decides to rectify this. Ted heirs a detective, Pat Healy (Matt Dillon), to find Mary. The report is disappointing however he still peruses her and in the process has some interesting experiences. Some will make your hair stand on end. Soon he finds that there is not a clear track as he is one of many admirers.

Will Ted and Marry get together?
Will they want to?
And what about Pat who fell in love also?

Cameron, blue eyed natural blond from California, had already been in ten movies so she was well known at the time of this movie. The script and part fit her well. Off screen she has a sense of humor that could appreciate the sight gags.
