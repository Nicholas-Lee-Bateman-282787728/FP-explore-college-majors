4834172,5,B005M5OSBU,"I picked up Designing Women Season 5 thinking there would be a few great episodes and the rest would be filler, but to my astonishment all of them are great! Suzanne as at her best, and that's what I love about Designing Women - Suzanne being outrageous.

The video and audio quality are also great. Much better than some of the earlier seasons.

Highlight of Season 5 would be Bernice's pig snout! Hah!

I can't wait for the later seasons, even if Suzanne and Charlene are gone...",1324166400,14,481,4.505747126436781
4834173,5,B005M5OSBU,"These women rock and continue to do so in time- Everyone of them in her specific and unique character persona. I always will love Suzanne- Beautiful, outrageously funny,and never afraid to be blunt; Julia, the greatest personality ever, talented, beautiful, smart, and with a ""pret-a-porter"" sharp and unbeatable repertoire; Charlene, so beautiful, honest, sweet , compassionate, and FUNNY; and the Foxy Mary-Jo, so beautiful, smart, funny and irresistible! How could not someone have a good time in the company of those gils!  They are irresistibly adorable! This is one of the greatest funny shows on TV ever. I love it!",1319846400,17,622,5.22
4834174,5,B005M5OSBU,"After waiting more than a year since Season 4, Shout Factory finally announces Season Five of ""Designing Women"" on DVD. This is the last year to feature the original cast before Jan Hooks and Julia Duffy stepped in to replace the departing Jean Smart and Delta Burke.

I have a personal affinity for this season, since this is when I originally discovered the series in prime-time, having been a latecomer to it. It was only because it preceded the Sharon Gless drama ""The Trials of Rosie O'Neill"" that I was finally exposed to the fabulous ladies of Sugarbakers.

Season Four is probably the season that most fans consider the series peak, and this collection of 24 episodes (which originally aired on CBS over the course of the 1990-91 TV season) carries on in the same vein. Slowly, the soapbox/message scripts of seasons past are phased out in favor of quirky but classy high-comedy. This is never more evident than in ""Pearls of Wisdom"", in which Mary-Jo and Charlene rip apart a salad-bar Lucy and Ethel style, in hopes of finding the expensive necklace of Suzanne's that Mary-Jo's lost somewhere in the restaurant.

The season-opener ""Blast From The Past"" features my favorite Julia rant of the entire series when she goes off on historical-homes tour guide Mary Ann Mobley in Scarlett O'Hara style (much funnier than her ""Night-the-Lights-Went-Out-In-Georgia"" speech). Dixie Carter also gets to rip people to shreds as Julia in ""Miss Trial"", when she's sequestered with a bunch of hick jurors causing her to miss out on a dinner with Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter.

Alice Ghostley (Bernice) gets more screen time this season; first with a cable-access talk show and later with a botched nose job. But she still hasn't yet taken up singing her catch phrase to Anthony (""Black Man, Black Man...where did you come from?""). That doesn't happen 'til next season.

Delta Burke's feud with the producers was ferociously exploited by the tabloids during this season making her exit one of the most-publicized cast changes in TV history. At the time, speculation reached a boiling point as to who her successor would be. Loni Anderson, Jackee, and even Bette Midler were some of the names tossed around. Although Delta missed a few shows and scripts were hastily re-written to exclude Suzanne, the remaining cast members held their own despite the absence of the show's breakout character. None of the episodes this season have ""clunker"" stamped on them. Suzanne's just as funny and outrageous as she was in Season 4, whether she's accidentally glued her lips shut, setting her wig on fire while smoking or ripping it off to challenge a drag queen, it's quite evident Delta Burke's comedic talents were in full bloom.

A bittersweet season, being the last one with the four ladies who began it all, but a must-have for anyone who's loved the releases that have come out so far. The cover art features an early cast photo, but I won't nitpick since it's such a relief that my favorite season featuring the original cast is coming out after all. Shout, please don't abandon the series at this point. Seasons 6 and 7 featured a lot of talent in the form of Jan Hooks, Julia Duffy and Judith Ivey and deserve to see the light of day on DVD, even if it's only through the Shout Select program.",1315612800,75,3283,4.822380106571936

4834182,4,B005M5OSBU,"The last hurrah for the original ensemble cast of this show continues to be clever and entertaining, and when watched now, points up all too clearly the differences between the rapport of these actresses and those of the replacements they brought in with the next season to replace Jean Smart (Charlene) and Delta Burke (Suzanne), giving a definite sense of nostalgia.  The newer actresses/characters never did play off Dixie Carter (Julia) and Annie Potts (Mary Jo) in the same way.  My favorites among the many good episodes: ""Papa Was a Rolling Stone"" (ex-con transportation/decorating assistant Anthony Buvier finally meets his estranged father via a plot by the Sugarbaker ladies to give him a special 30th birthday gift), ""Keep the Home Fires Burning"" (one of several WWII dreams from new Air Force wife Charlene after she marries Col. Bill Stillfield and he gets sent to the Gulf for Operation Desert Storm),  ""This is Art?"" (Julia's JC Penney's purse is mistaken for a work of art when she visits a friend's art gallery) and ""The Big Circle"" (After boy friend/sometime fianc&eacute; Reese Watkins [Hal Holbrook, Dixie's real-life husband] finally dies of heart complications, Julia learns to cope with some unexpected help from the Sugarbakers' newest client, bratty 10-year-old Randa Oliver, who suffers from neglectful parents who essentially abandon her to their care).",1479168000,2,1380,5.263636363636364

4834192,4,B005M5OSBU,"The fifth season of Designing Women is still good, but it's not as good as the previous seasons. The comedy has become more traditional, more like other sitcoms of the era, but there are still a few ""special"" episodes tossed in for good measure. Suzanne (Delta Burke) is still self-centered, Julia (Dixie Carter) is still liberal, Mary Jo (Annie Potts) is still sassy, Charlene (Jean Smart) is still dingy, Anthony (Meshach Taylor) is still going to college, and Bernice (Alice Ghostley) is still our ""little fruitcake"".

In the season-opener, ""Blast from the Past"", Sugarbaker's is put on a historical tour of homes, and Julia becomes irritated that the manager of the tour wants to sell the myth of the old South instead of the truth. Julia's frustration leads to another of her famous ramps in a Scarlett O'Hara-type ballgown. Anthony's character is further developed in the second episode, ""Papa Was a Rolling Stone"", when the four women try to track down the father Anthony never knew.

Some of season five's better episodes are:
1) ""The Bachelor Auction""---Suzanne accidentally buys a date with Anthony in a charity auction.
2) ""Old Rebels and Young Models""---Charlene's baby, Olivia, auditions for a modeling job.
3) ""My Daughter, Myself""---Mary Jo forbids her nearly 18-year-old daughter from dating a 34-year-old man.
4) ""And Now, Here's Bernice""---Bernice gets her local public access cable television show and discusses the women on air.
5) ""Pearls of Wisdom""---Mary Jo switches her knockoff pears for Suzanne's real ones and then loses them in an all-you-can-eat salad bar.
6) ""How Long Has This Been Going On?""---Everyone at Sugarbaker's is shocked when they discover Julia has been secretly performing at a local nightclub.
7) ""Maybe Baby""---Mary Jo decides she wants to have another baby, while Suzanne decides she's going to smoke to loose weight.
8) ""Blame It on New Orleans""---The ladies attend a convention in New Orleans, and Mary Jo has a fling with a man who turns out to be married.
9) ""Friends and Husbands""---Charlene's husband, Bill, returns from the service, but their reunion is interrupted by Mary Jo's visits; Julia tries to renew her driver's license.
10) ""The Pride of the Sugarbakers""---Mary Jo and Julia coach a Little League team that Sugarbaker's sponsors, and Suzanne's car keeps getting hit at the games by four balls.

Season five of Designing Women is an enjoyable contribution to the show's legacy, but there a few problems with the season in its entirety. Delta Burke, who was largely considered the show's breakout star, is as beautiful as ever (despite her noticeable weight gain), and her comedic timing is at its peak. However, her problems with the producers of the show and co-star Dixie Carter has had an affect on her treatment here; Burke's Suzanne isn't given too many major storylines, if any really, and in the majority of the episodes, she's written down to little more than a walk on. The core cast, which once was a strong ensemble with excellent chemistry, seems a bit fractured, perhaps because of the behind-the-scenes difficulties. The stories this seasons are a bit weaker than those of the previous two seasons, but the performances are better than the scripts, so that's a definite plus. Dixie Carter has become more glossy, and her comedic timing has certainly improved over the seasons; oh, and I didn't mind that they cut down on her ""ramps"" this go around. Annie Potts looks darling, with her kinky curly hair, and she gets the majority of this season's more juicier stories. Jean Smart is as pretty as ever, and her down-to-Earth sweetness has never been so prominent. Overall, this season isn't a bad one, it just isn't up to par with the first four seasons, particularly seasons three and four. At times it's more than noticeable that the cast is having problems, and that Delta Burke's role was limited on purpose. The saddest part is the season finale is the swan song for both Delta Burke and Jean Smart as regulars (Smart returned for the hour-long sixth season opener), the show's best actresses, which is a good reason to own this DVD set even though it isn't the best of Designing Women.

4834213,5,B005M5OSBU,"Season 5 was another great and funny season for Designing Women. The episodes ranged from Mary Jo contemplating having another baby, to Julia developing a night club singing alter ego named ""Juselle,"" to Charlene attending a four year university for the first time, to Anthony battling unruly neighbors in his apartment building, to Suzanne battling a PETA like organization for wearing a fur coat in a fashion show, this season was very entertaining. Oh, let's not forget the Sugarbaker design firm's favorite scattered brain friend, Bernice Clifton, who had a botched nose job in a hilarious episode. Get this season simply because it was Delta Burke and Jean Smart's last season on the series. Jean would return for the Season 6 premiere episode, but this is the full season for the Charlene character.

4834244,5,B005M5OSBU,"This is one of those DVD sets you but to watch this again because you like the series when it was on TV, its a show from the 1980's and 1990's so most references are very dated, however if you loved this show when it was on the air it is great to be able to go back and watch this show again.",1356652800,,292,3.6507936507936507
4834245,5,B005M5OSBU,"Well, if you're reading the review, you know the show. After all these years, a few of the ""punch lines"" come back to me. Worthwhile watching, certainly. Truly odd that it was substantially cheaper to order all seven seasons individually than the comprehensive set. The discs  are fine, the packaging less so, already finding a few of the ""retention tabs"" broken off on the inside of the plastic inner cases.",1353974400,,408,4.828571428571428
4834246,5,B005M5OSBU,What can I say never watch it when it was on air but on reruns it sure is funnier then hell bring back some of Lucy but with it being the last season of Delta Burke and Jean Smart it just never be the same,1352505600,,205,3.577777777777778

4834248,5,B005M5OSBU,"I love the first 5 seasons of Designing Women.  The humor still holds up for me.  It is probably my all time favorite searies because of the smart, witty dialogue.  I can identify a little with each character.  I love shows about smart, assertive, empowered funny women!",1341273600,,270,4.680851063829787
4834249,5,B005M5OSBU,"Designing Women... This show is the best of best-it'll make you laugh, it'll make you awed, it'll even make you cry sometimes...

It has beauty, fashion, humor, humanity, love and friendship. And Oh, yes, the most-entertaining southern flabor, too. Set in Atlanta Georgia, all four designing women have such distinct forte in their own right - Julia, the terminator, MaryJo cute as button, Charlene the cotton candy sweetheart, Suzanne Sugabaker, the sassiest and prettiest women to ever hit the TV screen, and Oh, Meshach Taylor!! - a show by himself!

I've seldom watched TV shows - to search and buy this series - it is that good! This show is absolutely the tops. Recommend it to people of all ages. You'll watch them over and over... :)",1340064000,,741,4.826771653543307

4834252,5,B005M5OSBU,"Season 5 is the last one featuring all of the original cast and, to my mind, it's the best of the five.  All of them are funny, but by season 5, the writers and the actors had their show, their characters and the South down pat and knew how to work it.  The imcomparable Dixie Carter as Julia Sugarbaker gave new insights into her character, as we watched her learn to play a little (singing in a club), take in a young house guest for several weeks, and grieve the loss of her beloved Reese.  Suzanne (played to perfection by Delta Burke) even grew a little as she helped Julia deal with the aftermath of Reese's death and went on to guard her car from foul balls at the Little League games.  Charlene (Jean Smart, who is hard to imagine in any other role, although I've seen her in others and she's great) got her husband home and tried to break Olivia into modeling.  Mary Jo (Annie Potts, who is like no one else on earth and a delight to watch) toughened up a little and learned to fight back while watching her daughter get old enough for college (where HAS the time gone?) and her son be lousy at Little League.  And Anthony (who is a natural born mixer and can get along with nearly anyone) got invited into the Country Club that refused membership to Suzanne, made partner, and learned that dainty women are not always ladylike!  Meshach Taylor, who turned one episode into a recurring role and then into a regular, makes the perfect counterpart to the four women.  No one else could have played the part with the panache and humor he made look so effortless.  No wonder the show changed after this; they achieved perfection (or close to it) and had nowhere else to go.  I laughed all the way through this and plan to watch it again before too long.",1327795200,11,1758,4.365030674846626
4834253,5,B005M5OSBU,"Finally season 5 has been released. And my fellow Designing Women lovers season 6 will be released in April 2012!!! No release date for season 7 but although I LOVE designing women I can go without season 7. I like Carline and BJ, but my favorite character, Julia, her character is just so much different from past seasons it was just a bit of a turn off. But who cares!!! ALL SIX SEASONS ARE OUT, YAY!!!!",1327276800,,405,4.342105263157895

Received Season 5 of Designing women today. I have seasons 1-4 so I noticed right away that it was just in a plastic case. No cardboard cover like seasons one thru four have. No nice colored coordinated sleeve that looks good on your DVD shelf. Just the plastic case. Disappointed and will not get any future season sets.",1327017600,3,521,6.791044776119403
