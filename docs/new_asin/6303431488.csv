7846181,5,6303431488,"I have to admit, Peter Stirling is such a great character and Donald O'Connor plays him so well, that seeing Peter get a crack at West Point made this my favorite in the series.  Peter cuts quite a dashing figure in his cadet uniform, even if he can't quite make the grade until Francis shows up to tutor him through his classes and drilling.  The viewer roots for Peter to succeed from the start of the film to the finish.  Won't give away the ending, but Peter's attempts to protect another cadet from being expelled from the Academy are just plain noble!  Oh, and there's something having to do with football, and I'm still trying to figure out why they stuck that plot dragger in to an otherwise wonderful film, but that's Hollywood for ya.  Enjoy!  O'Connor (and Francis!) are wonderful!  Favorite scenes?  Francis trying to teach Peter French and Peter defending Francis's dignity at a dance where the other cadets are trying to make Francis look like...well, like an ass!  Way to go, Pete!",1074470400,,996,4.645714285714286
