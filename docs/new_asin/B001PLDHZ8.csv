Each animal has their own chapter with multiple photo and video references. They have clips of how they run, play, jump, walk, eat, ect. They also show different personalities of the animals, which is also helpful, especially for animators.
Disc one covers Chimpanzees, Kangaroos, Squirrels, ostriches, and tigers. I already give this 5 stars, its been so helpful for me. I haven't checked out disc 2 yet, but some of the animals listed are alligators, snakes, and wolves, so i'll definatly be drawing them soon.
These videos are excellent photo reference for artists, these are not nature dvd's like you'd see on national geographic or something. Its pretty straight forward stuff. You want to learn to draw how a tiger runs, theres a clip for it, and if you couldn't catch it, they even have clips in slow motion. I hope they make more stuff like this in the future.",1361491200,2,1041,4.663043478260869
