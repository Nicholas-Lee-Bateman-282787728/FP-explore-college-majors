2817989,5,B000PFUAPK,I bought this DVD because of the Robert Ludlum name and I was not disappointed.  This 70s mini series was superb --- story line was great and the cast was a-one and the acting was good.,1326499200,,185,4.138888888888889
2817990,5,B000PFUAPK,"Yes, this is an older TV adaptation. I loved it. It stayed true to the book, and in doing so, had to be long. All the layers of espionage and not knowing who is on who's side was great to see in the series. I'd like to see The Materese Circle done like this.",1322179200,2,258,3.7962962962962963
2817991,1,B000PFUAPK,"The first hour of this is terrible. I couldn't finish watching it. This DVD comes up constantly when you look up the excellent films The Odessa File, Marathon Man, and Three Days of the Condor, as well as the decent Holcroft Covenant and Boys from Brazil so, being a sucker for 70's films of this sort I gave this a shot, already knowing full well that Stephen Collins isn't exactly brimming with charisma (see Start Trek TMP) but hoping that the source material would make up for it. Well the adaptation, the lackluster direction, dreadful pacing as well as cardboard performances by all involved make this a terrible disapointment. I wanted to like this, I really did,  but phew! it stinks.",1309219200,15,692,4.7190082644628095
2817992,1,B000PFUAPK,"A lot of over (or under) acting.  Director doesn't make you 'believe' that the main character really is a secret agent.  Mainly about a guy that sleeps around with all the women he can find.  He's like a male prostitute but without the money.  You hear that he sleeps with a married woman.  Rather disgusting to see a producer/writer that would allow that in a film with his name on it; disgraceful for my money.  In all, the movie seems like one that the producer didn't put a lot of time and thoughtfulness in to.  More like he was lazy and figured the Americans apetite with 'sex sells' would get the movie watched.",1208995200,4,618,4.415929203539823
2817993,4,B000PFUAPK,"Wa surprise to find out this was a mini-serie.  Good scenario, alot of action and makes you wonder if it realy happenned.  Enjoyed the DVD",1206316800,2,138,4.48
2817994,2,B000PFUAPK,"The series has a good plot but is poorly acted by one and all.
Robert Ludlum's book is much better to read than sitting through this poor attempt to bring his written words to life.",1203033600,3,181,4.2
2817995,5,B000PFUAPK,"A fantastic print of one of the best mini-series of the 70s. Stephen Collins in excellent and is supported by such well-knowns as Larry Hagman Jose Ferrer, Vince Edwards, Rene Auberjonois, Gene Evans,
John Van Dreelen, Claude Akins, Werner Klemperer, Roddy McDowall, John Huston and of course Lauren Hutton.
A must-have for devotees of superior entertainment.",1192665600,24,359,5.428571428571429
2817996,5,B000PFUAPK,"""The Rhinemann Exchange"" was the first adaptation of a Robert Ludlum book to film.  It was also one of the first TV miniseries, and the cast is a Who's Who of 70's television stardom.

David Spaulding (Stephen Collins) had a very cosmopolitan upbringing thanks to his father, a world famous concert pianist. He has lived in cities around the world, is fluent in several languages, and has an engineering degree.  All of this makes him a desirable recruit for US Army Intelligence in the early days of World War II.

After proving himself during an assignment in Spain, David Spaulding is hand picked as the only suitable candidate for a below the radar operation code named Tortuga.

The Germans are desperate for industrial diamonds for their V2 rocket, and the Americans are equally desperate to get a better gyroscope for their bombers.  A rogue exchange is brokered, and scheduled to take place in the neutral city of Buenos Aires, Argentina.  A mission so controversial that his superiors won't even entrust Spaulding with the true nature of the exchange for fear he would refuse the assignment.

In Buenos Aires it seems everyone knows more about Spaulding's msision than he does.  He finds himself targeted by the Americans, Germans, and even Haganah as he struggles to learn the truth and complete his task.

The DVD is divided into three chapters corresponding with the original three night airing of the miniseries in 1977.  From the DVD package, this is full frame 1:33:1; approximately 4 hours and 8 minutes; Dolby Mono 2.0 English soundtrack, and English SDH subtitles.  There are no bonus or special features.

Recommended.",1191283200,61,1637,4.974264705882353
2817997,5,B000PFUAPK,"The DVD was 4 hours of factual information.  My husband, a disabled veteran of WWII, and I enjoyed the movie from beginning to end.  The story starts out in 1939 and leads up to the start of WWII and continues on from there.  My husband plans to watch it again in the event he missed something the first time.",1187827200,30,309,4.203389830508475
2818008,4,B000PFUAPK,"An old timer and one of Ludlum's best books, but there were times when the story lagged.",1468627200,,88,4.235294117647059

2818014,5,B000PFUAPK,"Great mini series from 70's! If you like classic 70's TV like me and Nazi spy thrillers this is a good one! I got this for $3 bucks at best buy and
it was worth it. It goes great with my TV and movie collection. The story is well written fast paced and has a great plot behind it! Laura Hutton
is as sexy weird and dangerous as she is in everything she plays. The lead actor was all over TV shows and movies in 70's wasn't the best
choice for this role but he's above average compared to the no talent actors today! Hollyweird and Network TV wish they could make a TV
show or mini series that is this good! they don't even have decent ratings anymore! Those who put this movie down obviously don't like 'good'
classic TV or just brainwashed with CGI sex nudity blood and gore and can't watch a movie that is just GOOD without all the extra CRAP!",1431820800,4,845,4.127272727272727
2818015,5,B000PFUAPK,"Great adaptation of book.  They don't make movies like these anymore, which is so sad.  Worth the money and pass it forward if you don't want to watch it again.",1426723200,,160,4.3

2818017,5,B000PFUAPK,"I was pleasantly surprised.  Most stories like this have bad language, gratuitous sex, etc.  This had neither.  Although it had a love angle (what story doesn't?), the sex was implied and not graphic.  Not a single bad word.  So glad I bought this.",1423267200,8,248,4.674418604651163

2818025,2,B000PFUAPK,"I bought this brand new..in wrap...for 28 cents...plus 4 bux to ship it.
If it were free...it would still not be worth the shipping.
If I did not like all things WW2, I would have given it ZERO Stars.
What an amateurish piece of junk.
I guess Lauren Hutton needed  a pay check...and the producers thought her name would put asses in the theater/home seats.
She had WAY too many scenes.
This should have been a One Hour Movie of the week.
If your local library does not have a copy...just forget it.
You would have to be a brain dead dolt to enjoy this garbage.

2818027,5,B000PFUAPK,"I have never read a ""bad"" book or story line of Robert Ludlum. This I felt was one of his best. Story keeps one guessing as to ""who, what, or how"". It was a long movie, but worht the time.",1368576000,4,188,3.725

8191003,4,B000PFUAPK,"David Spaulding (Stephen Collins) is selected and groomed for a mission to set up a covert exchange of goods between the NSDAP and the Allied Powers.

It is closed captioned but unfortunately I had to slow it down because the closed caption wood say dumb things like speaking Spanish and speaking German, but did not give the exact words or a quasi translation. Luckily they used grade school words so we can keep up.

I enjoy the other Robert Ludlum book to films, but somehow missed this one.
