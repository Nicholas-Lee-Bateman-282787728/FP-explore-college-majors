795727,5,6304151306,"This movie a a stirring look into the life of a Russian Jewish family. From the practice of our shabbet, all the way to our Jewish wedding, this movie presents all our traditions and customs to the non-Jewish world.
Topol is brilliant in the role of Tevye, from the look all the way down to the accent. While it does leave out some of the tiny details that were given in the Broadway version of this play, it also adds so much more to an already great production. We could never imagine 'If I Were A Rich Man' without thinking of Tevye dancing up a storm of dust in his barn, or 'Sunrise, Sunset' without all the children and adults gathered around the wedding canopy. (This feat was impossible on the stage due to the fact that the actors would then block the view of the audience.)
~*~Facts~*~
At the beginning, after Tevye says, 'Like a fiddler on the roof', the screen cuts away to a shot of the fiddler standing on the roof. This person is NOT the actor seen in the rest of the film, but a very young version of the violinist Isaac Stern. I was watching the VHS version at a friend's house when I noticed the beginning was slightly different than the version that had been taped off of TV back in the 70's. While in the TV version you are able to recognize that this person is Isaac Stern, in the VHS version it looks like the regular actor. (I believe the DVD has information on this scene added as a bonus. Don't take my word for it though.) I've also been told that in the far off shot at the end of the movie, the man holding the violin under his arm following Tevye is, once again, young Isaac Stern.
This movie is something for the Jewish community to be proud of. I hope it inspires those who have wandered to come back to the traditions we have passed down for thousands of years. I hope it also helps the non-Jewish community to understand a little bit more about our traditions and why we so strictly keep to them.",1007769600,4,1929,4.273224043715847
795728,5,6304151306,"How can a bouncy upbeat musical about downtrodden Jews in Imperial Russia compare to a solemn novel-based film about the waning days of the Romanovs? ""Quite easily"" is my answer. Both movies were partly filmed in Yugoslavia, released in December, 1971, feature actor Vernon Dobtcheff in small but crucial parts( the official who orders the pogrom on the shtetl where the main characters live in this film, and Dr. Stanislas Lazovert who was in on the plot to kill Rasputin in N&A), we can see the life of the ill-fated Czar of Russia in one film, and the lives of the people who eventually rose up and overthrew the Czar in the other. The cast led by the warm and earthy Chaim Topol drives home the point that the people whom in many cases, the world eventually knew as Bolsheviks had daughters (and sons)that they loved and cherished every bit as dearly as the Czar loved his family, did not enjoy religious persecution, and were generally people who simply wanted good lives before push came to shove and revolution broke out. Having been raised with sisters, I can easily relate to the scenes of interaction between Tevye's daughters and I admire their independant spirits. Paul Michael Glasser is brilliant as a youthful idealist who wins the heart of the second daughter, Hodel, who is played by a friendly and outgoing Michelle Marsh. Molly Picon's feisty, comical Yente is an absolute scene-stealer. The two youngest daughters were absoloute sweethearts. Rosalind Harris behaved as charismatically as anyone might expect an oldest child to behave as Tzeitel, who was willing to fight for her happiness despite her father's traditionalism. Because Leonard Frey's Motel hearkens unto the voice of his sweetheart, remembering that even a poor taylor is entitled to some happiness, he wins her hand in marriage. Ray Lovelock's Fyetkev is the Good Gentile who wins the affection of beautiful, red-haired Chava, played by a gentle but deterimined Neva Small. I didn't see a cast member I didn't like in this movie,except perhaps for Vernon Dobtcheff, and Norman Jewison received many appropriate ""Mazel Tovs"" from critics the world over for the direction of this film. It had depth and scope in addition to beautiful music. In an interesting footnote, Chaim Topol and Michael Jayston, the two leads in ""Fiddler on the Roof"" and ""Nicholas and Alexandra"" ended up working together in a film called ""The Public Eye"" with Mia Farrow a year later.",998611200,3,2443,4.9609756097560975
795729,5,6304151306,"This is a wonderful motion picture.  The music is supurb!!  Topol was a wonderful pick for the part of Topol.  His voice is wonderful.  The story is great, too.  I recommend it for every family.  I don't mind watching it again and again with different members of my family, especially my grandchildren.  (11).",997660800,,309,4.716981132075472
795730,5,6304151306,"Fiddler On The Roof is without a doubt the best ever musical! It has great actors, cool characters, unforgettable songs and fun plots. It's great how Tzeitel and Hodel convince Tevye to let them choose who they marry. And all of the songs show feelings, some are happy like ""Miracle Of Miracles"" or ""Tradition"" and some are sad like ""Far From The Home I Love"". Some of the characters are really funny like Yente, or very serious like Golde. And there are a lot of funny parts in the movie, like when the lesson of Laban cheating on Jacob was ""Never trust your employer"", or when Motel's 'new arrival' was a sewing machine, although he and Tzeitel did have a baby. And the dream the Tevye pretends to have is absolutely hilarious! But some parts are very sad, like when Hodel is forced to leave her home to see Perchick, or when the Jews are forced out of Anatevka. All of these are reasons why I liked this musical, and I think you'll like it too! I recommend this to anybody!",977702400,3,976,4.397790055248619
795731,5,6304151306,"Based on the stories of Sholom Aleichem, the movie version of Fiddler on the Roof features Topol as Tevye the Milkman, a poor Jewish husband and father living in pre-revolutionary Russia.  His story is inevitably tragic,  but humorous and touching along the way.
The movie is filled with asides  from Tevye, as he reveals his thoughts to the camera.  He is forever  quoting ""the good book,"" sometimes correctly, sometimes not so  correctly.
As was tradition during this time, the matchmaker sets up  all marriages.  Tevye's daughters aren't too happy about this (as is shown  through the famous song, Matchmaker, Matchmaker), and the older three  eventually set up their own marriages.
Tzeitel, the oldest, falls in love  with Motel, the poor tailor, and they ask Tevye's permission to marry.  He  finally relents and they have a proper Jewish wedding.  Hodel falls in love  with a revolutionary who has been staying with Tevye and Golde and their  family.  She leaves her family to follow him in the heartbreaking song,  ""Far From the Home I Love.""  Chava, the delicate middle daughter,  falls in love with Fyedka, a Russian.  Tevye forbids this marriage, for he  cannot turn from his faith.  Chava chooses love over family as shown  through ballet, and Tevye has no choice but to count her as dead.
Tevye's story ends as the Jewish community is forced from Anatevka.  Even in this hard time, Tevye is faithful that everything will turn out all  right in the end.
The music in this movie is absolutely beautiful.  You'll tap your feet to ""If I Were a Rich Man,"" and ""Miracle  of Miracles.""  You'll find tears in your eyes during ""Sunrise,  Sunset,"" and ""Far From the Home I Love.""  You'll laugh at  Yente and during the dance at the bar.
This is a movie that belongs in  everyone's movie collection.  It is a story that will last forever.",964828800,212,1839,4.7699680511182105
795732,5,6304151306,"""Life without tradition would be as shaky as a fiddler on the  roof,"" announces the milkman Tevye. It is this battle to preserve his  beloved Jewish traditions that befuddles Tevye, as he faces a changing  world and the daunting prospect of marrying off his strong-willed daughters  with no dowry to offer as inducement. Topol who embraces the character  Tevye like a child to its mother. His monologues with God (""I know we  are the chosen ones, but once in a while can't you choose somebody  else?""). To his exasperated externalized dilemmas (""on the one  hand...but on the other hand""), they provide the comedy relief of this  serious play. From his world-weary fear of change, to his joyous dreams of  plenty, Topol gives an exuberant and memorable performance.  As he marries  off his daughters, Tevye comes to see the traditions he so lovingly  embraces not as a mountain range, immovable and immutable, but as a river,  ever flowing and changing with the landscape. However, even the enlightened  Tevye must draw the line somewhere, and when his third daughter wants to  marry a Russian, one of those who are performing pogroms on his people, he  can no longer go with the flow.",959904000,5,1185,4.845
795733,5,6304151306,"The music and songs are moving and memorable! The acting superb! Definately a keeper. One to watch with the whole family. Tevye and his family represent the typical Russian Jews of the time. Along with heartache  and happiness comes the passing of old ways and the emergence of a new  world. Topol's character, Tevye, resists the changes as much as he can but  in the end while his small corner of the world crashes down around him he  begins to realize that tradtions did not keep them untouched from the  sweeping changes that came with the dawning of the Russian Revolution.",947289600,,577,4.673267326732673

It's a story of a Jewish community in Czarist Russia, and their lives and trials told in rich songs: ""If I Were a Rich Man,"" ""Sunrise, Sunset,"" ""Tradition,"" and many more.  The story revolves around a peddlar, is wife, and three of their daughters.  The matchmaker finds husbands for them, except the daughters have other ideas.  The play ends with a sad exodus forced by a pogrom, but the peddlar refuses to give up, and carries on despite it all.  END",892771200,,497,4.6022727272727275

795814,5,6304151306,"Fiddler on the Roof is an inspiring story about a Jewish family living in a small Russian village during the Czarist period shortly before the Communist Revolution in 1917.  The breadwinner was a poor farmer who sold milk to the people of the village; his wife was a homemaker busy raising five daughters.  The older three are prominent in the story.  The oldest girl is in love with the village tailor, and they eventually marry.  The second girl falls in love with a 'teacher', also a Jew, with somewhat radical ideas.  After spending time with the family for a time, he leaves for St. Petersburg to help promote a revolution from the Czarist regime and is imprisoned.  The second daughter, upon learning of his imprisonment, decides to leave her family and join him.  The third daughter meets a kind young Gentile man; against her father's dictates they get married.  As a result the father disowns her. Finally, the Czar decrees that all the Jews in the village must leave their homes and leave the country.  The movie ends with all the people beginning their exodus from their homes to other lands in the world.  Our family is bound for the US.",1296172800,,1149,4.6716417910447765
795865,5,6304151306,"I recently saw a screening of 1971's ""Fiddler on the Roof,"" based on the Yiddish stories of Sholem Aleichem. The film was directed by Norman Jewison, with a script by Joseph Stein, music by Jerry Bock, and lyrics by Sheldon Harnick. I had not seen this movie for a number of years and I wondered if it would have the same impact on me that it did the first time around. I am pleased to say that I enjoyed it as much as ever.

Topol imbues the character of Tevye the milkman with soul, energy, poignancy, and humor. Norma Crane is the sweetly acerbic Golde, whose love for her family, innate superstition, and acceptance of things that she cannot change are the constants in her exhausting life. Molly Picon is an amusing Yente, who does her best to bring people together even if they're not compatible. Paul Mann is the gruff Lazar Wolf, an affluent older widower whom Yentl has chosen as a husband for the mortified and reluctant Tzeitel, Tevye's oldest daughter. Leonard Frey is a delightful Motel Kamzoil, the skinny and shy tailor who has loved Tzeitel for years. When he nervously asks Tevya for Tzeitel's hand, Motel boldly pronounces, ""Even a poor tailor is entitled to some happiness!"" Michele Marsh plays Hodel, the second eldest daughter, who falls for a radical named Perchik (played stiffly by Michael Glaser). Chava, portrayed by the lovely Neva Small, does the unthinkable; against her father's wishes, she runs off with a non-Jew named Fyedka.

""Fiddler on the Roof"" has a magnificent score that I hum to myself as I walk down the street (I try to keep my voice down). The beautifully choreographed production numbers are electrifying, and the quiet scenes are funny and extremely touching. This film explores a painful time for the Jews in tsarist Russia:  They lived a circumscribed existence, obeying the commandments, studying the holy books, and doing whatever was necessary to survive. Unfortunately, anti-Semitism in the form of brutal pogroms cost many Jews their lives; those who survived were forced to leave their homes.

Certain scenes in ""Fiddler"" are so vivid as to be unforgettable. Who can resist the opening montage (""Tradition"") featuring Isaac Stern's sublime violin solo? Also worth noting are the lovely candle-lighting scene on Sabbath eve; Tevye's ""If I Were a Rich Man,"" in which he wistfully imagines what it might be like to be prosperous; and ""L'Chaim,"" in which Tevye and Lazar drunkenly toast the impending merger of their families. In a particularly hilarious sequence, Tevye fabricates an outlandish dream so that he can persuade the gullible Golde to allow Tzeitel and Motel to wed. The sentimental ""Sunrise Sunset"" accompanies the chupah of Motel and Tzeitel; Tevye and Golde cannot believe that these two children have grown up to become husband and wife.

Why has ""Fidder on the Roof"" been such a phenomenon all over the world? Perhaps the answer lies in the story's universal significance: It depicts the clash between the older and younger generations, the evils of prejudice and oppression, and the determination of a beleaguered people to survive against all odds. ""Fiddler"" is a skillfully directed and wonderfully performed film that, so far, has stood the test of time.",1199750400,3,3226,4.966666666666667
795866,5,6304151306,"I am not a fan of musicals.  To suddenly burst into song to facilitate the telling of a story is just. . .well, it's corny.  (""Bob, before you give your quarterly report, let's have a medley."")
FIDDLER ON THE ROOF differs drastically from most musicals for two reasons:  it tells an engrossing story; it is an exceptionally well-made film.  Director Norman Jewison is the true star of this epic, as he is able to seamlessly transport the viewer to the Russian village of Anatevka--a village about to be radically affected by a dying Czarist regime.  It is here  the viewer is vigorously and wonderfully indoctrinated into the Jewish faith through the narration of Tevye, the milkman (Topol).  And the Jewish faith, as Tevye repeatedly says, is based on ""tradition.""
Naturally, tradition is under assault in Tevye's household, as his three oldest daughters--one by one--bypass their parents and pick their own husbands:  a most egregious departure from old custom.  But even more compelling is the allegorical depiction of Jewish tradition on the brink of mammoth assault in the tumultuous years to come under the Communists and Nazis.  Again, Jewison tells a powerful story, superbly augmented by the music.
Topol and the rest of the cast are fantastic.  This film covers the full gambit of emotion, from lighthearted fun to dark remorse.  The opening violin solo by Isaac Stern is worth the price of purchase itself.  I don't make a habit out of recommending musicals, but FIDDLER ON THE ROOF is a golden exception.

795867,5,6304151306,"Fiddler on the Roof is a movie that will always stand the test of time.  It accurately portrays what the Jewish people have been overcomming during their existence.  Topol is oh so charming as a poor milkman father who strives to do the best for his family.
There are many moments of humor and other moments that are poignant.  Topol struggles through much change in marrying off his daughters.  Whereas Topol can handle stepping away from arranged marriages and formal approvals he cannot accept intermarriage especially in an environment where Jews are so frequently persecuted.
Whereas Topol's character certainly stands out the most, each of the supporting cast members give noteworthy performances.  And the music is all fabulous.  To Life, Sunrise Sunset, Tradition, and If I Were A Rich Man are all very memorable songs.
Fiddler on the Roof is one movie that can be clearly classified as a keeper.",1055548800,2,904,4.993333333333333

The smaller-scale story is about a traditional Jewish father who is struggling to get by in the world.  He explains the meaning of the fiddler on the roof early on and likens it to his survival.  Topol gives us a great performance as we see his traditional ways tested with the marriages of some of his daughters.
The larger-scale story is about the changing face of Russia.  Pogroms are moving people around or away, and this movie shows the effects on a village.  I found it very informative.
OK, the music will stick with you.  Even though I am not much of a fan of musicals, I find myself humming ""Sunrise, Sunset,"" and I can still hear the daughters singing of the matchmaker.  I music of Isaac Stern will stay with you also.
