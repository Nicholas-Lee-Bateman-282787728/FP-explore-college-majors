3496276,1,B001BN4WM2,"It is indeed shameful that Paramount has tried to take advantage of its customers (or, the way it is going, former customers).  However, Amazon has no fault in how Paramount has chosen to release DYNASTY in split seasons.  Amazon is simply the distributor/reseller.

It is great that people have started taking a stand against such customer abuse.  Yet, we do still have those spoiled, elite few who think we are crazy for complaining.  They seem to forget that Paramount has released DYNASTY: SEASON 3 split in two, all in ONE year.  DYNASTY has NINE seasons. So, at this rate, can we all wait NINE YEARS until they release the final season?  And while you are at it, take out your calculators and do the math to see how much you will pay...

Meanwhile, Warner Bros. has catered to its customers by releasing FULL seasons of DALLAS at a rate of three seasons a year and reasonable prices.  THAT is what I call customer respect.",1220918400,5,928,4.609756097560975
3496277,1,B001BN4WM2,they are like the Gas people want more money out of u maybe Soapnet will put it back on air soon  does this have both part 1&2 in set i love this show nver knew how it ended love to know hurry get it done and do it right,1220832000,4,220,3.489795918367347
3496278,1,B001BN4WM2,"Just like other comments, I am really disappointed with the releasers of Dynasty dvd's. What do they think? That we are so stupid to buy half boxes or feel obliged to buy a combined 3 season box set to get season 3?
I am trully frustrated with such a way of not being customer oriented.
Can't they simply release each season completely, one after the other? Is it that difficult or are they only thinking about trying to make monney? I really encourage everybody NOT to buy half seasons or set up boxes (except maybe a full series box set). And let's hope they will be wiser with the continuation of the series.",1220572800,7,611,4.415929203539823
3496279,1,B001BN4WM2,"First, Dynasty Season One came out and we had to wait over a year for season two because of poor sales. I was happy when season two came out and was looking forward to buying complete seasons of 3, 4, and etc. because I knew Joan Collins saved the show like Donna Mills saved Knots Landing. However, I was shocked to see Dynasty Season 3 Volume 1 at the price of a complete season of Dallas. You can read what I thought about this in my comments on this particular item. There is no way I was going to buy it or Volume 2. Now, I see Volume 2 of Dynasty Season 3 is still out and Volume 1 of Dynasty Season 3 has been discontinued. Then, I see an annoucement Dynasty Season 4 Volume 1 will be coming out soon. So, the only way I can obtain the complete season 3 of Dynasty is to buy the complete Dynasty serices 1,2,3 in this pack. Hell, no. I think if anyone else buys the continuing series of this show in part volumes is stupid. I suggest Paramount apologizies to the Dynasty fans and revised 3 on up at S19.99 to make up for their greed. Please remember this is a recession and I for one will not waste my hard earned money. Cheers.",1217462400,5,1135,4.0941704035874436
3496280,1,B001BN4WM2,"Don't Know what's going on here and I am sure (at least I hope)that Amazon is not responsible for this disgraceful shambles, but the producers of the Dynasty Season Titles need to pull their head in and show some respect and consideration for the customer.

I (like many) decided to hold off on purchasing Dynasty Season 3, Volume 1 due to the ridiculous high price for a half season (as opposed to the previous season which was released as 1 title). Now that Season 3, Volume 2 has been announced, we discover that we can no longer purchase Volume 1 separately unless we fork out for a combined set of Seasons 1,2 & 3.

Frankly I am not that big a fan. I have most of the episodes on video which I will just transfer to my own DVD's (sure the quality may not be as good, but at least it's free), besides I am sure Dynasty will be repeated here soon.

I will stick to the Dallas Season Sets which have been released consistently, in full season sets and reasonably priced. Good job Warner Bros .... at least you are showing consideration for the customer (so far). Keep up the good work.",1216771200,24,1087,4.344827586206897
3496281,1,B001BN4WM2,"Ok what is going on now???????????? I waited for Dynasty Season 3 the complete season.........So what happened they give us Dynasty Season 3 Vol. One..........if that isn't bad enough Amazon pulled it out from under us and are not even selling it.........now they are offering Dynasty Season 3 Vol. Two for pre-order October 21st also they are putting out A Dynasty Complete Three Season Pack 1,2,3 for preorder October 21st.......... well thats just great am I going to have to buy it to get Season 3 What the hell am I going to do with the Seasons One and Two that I already have..... This is obsured and I am not the only one that is angry.......Amazon should take a stand and threaten these companies for getting away with charging full price for half seasons well if amazon wants to lose business then I guess they might be forcing us to shop elsewhere maybe ""EBAY""",1216598400,11,870,4.619354838709677
8283825,5,B001BN4WM2,i have always watch them and to finally have the whole set was just so great i didn't even know they had any til i look at your site thank you,1378771200,,142,3.6129032258064515
8283826,1,B001BN4WM2,"I greatly enjoyed the series when it was on in the 1980's and would love to have the entire series on DVD.  What I don't understand is why, after 20 years, I still can't buy it unless I order one from China which is just a cheap knock-off and is very poorly produced.  If the entire set were put out by Paramount, I'd grab it in a heartbeat as I'm sure a lot of other fans would do.  Shame on Paramount!!!",1299628800,2,405,3.9753086419753085

Keep doing this Fox and Paramount, we can't wait to buy your split sets in a bargin bin for 1/3rd the price at a discount store when you can't sell them.",1233705600,4,345,4.564516129032258

8283830,4,B001BN4WM2,"Ignore the whinning from people over the split season.  This item is not for those people who have bought the individual seasons anyway.  If you are looking to get into Dynasty, and haven't bought any of the previous sets - here's your chance to get all three seasons for less money than if you bought them all individually. (Gasp! the dastardly intention of this set is revealed!)",1231027200,,381,4.6716417910447765
8283831,1,B001BN4WM2,"i suggest to follow me-instead of making an IMPULSIVE DUMB purchase and waste important money on split seasons (that created only to steal money from consumers in daylight by paramount and amazon),to keep waiting for the full series package in a reasonable low price...it might take up to 20 years till it will be released,but then again i lived more then 20 years after the show ended in 1989 withoutthe impulse to buy the series so waiting more 20 years will be a PIECE OF CAKE.:)",1228867200,13,482,4.616279069767442
8283832,1,B001BN4WM2,...with the dissenters. Paramount can go to hell for doing this to the fans. I suggest they stop splitting seasons. Not a cent from moi...xoxo,1226880000,12,142,4.72

8283834,5,B001BN4WM2,"First of all, I am a HUGE Dallas fan first and foremost, and was way too young to watch DYNASTY when it was on the air. I did happen to catch the two-part series finale and was immediately attracted to the show. I have held off on buying Season Two and Season Three. From what I have heard there are not enough people purchasing this series for them to release it as a full season. Hence the release of KNOT'S LANDING season one, which Warner Bros. were so put off buy the lack in sales that they refused to bring out season two, and that was like what, three years ago and still no season two. This is my advice, you can still order  DYNASTY season three part one from Borders Bookstores. I already have mine on order, but instead, I will purchase this package.

If people keep complaining and boycotting this show, Paramount will more than likely not release anymore. And for those of you with the episodes on vhs, well good for you, I don't have them at all, and I want this full show on dvd, and the series finale, so don't ruin it for everyone else.

Is DYNASTY a great show, yes it is, but the tides of time have come and gone and most of the original fans have moved on to other shows or are probably dead. Come on now, I don't mean to be rude by that comment, but alot of fans were the older generation who remember the three main stars in their prime from the 50's and 60's. Look what happened to BIG VALLEY, people boycotted the first part of season two and the studios wouldn't put it out anymore because they are not making enough profit to manufacture the dvds and put them out. Is it overly expensive, yes and no, because they have to hire a designer for the box, re-vamp the episodes so they don't look like crap, and loop the sound and that costs time and money. People don't do work for free, especially in the world of coporate profits and in the Hollywood Land.

So if you love DYNASTY, just struggle through ok. Complaining and boycotting is just going to lead to no more releases. And for those of you wanting to purchase this, this is the best buy thus far for the three seasons. And please purchase KNOT'S LANDING season two which should be released some time next year. Warner Bro's are giving it one last chance and if the consumer does not make a dent in buying then we are all basically screwed for further releases. I would also like to see FALCON CREST and THE COLBYS have it's one dvd release. So get those credit cards ready and get to buying up some DYNASTY--remember it's high class entertainment and I don't think the Carringtons would bother squabbling about prices if it's something they want, they fork it over and enjoy the proceeds.",1222819200,3,2671,4.346693386773547
