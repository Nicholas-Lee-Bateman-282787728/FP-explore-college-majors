This dvd helps you understand why perspective is so important also why the camera angle can make or break a scene. This dvd is not about drawing or digital painting but he does a great job of showing some shots that help you understand shot angles, etc. Excellent addition to any artists library!!",1206576000,,411,4.421052631578948
