8063191,5,B0009MAOAU,I am a avid fan of Case Closed Series. I looks like I am going to end up with all the movie and TV version of this series. And the price on Amazon is the best to get it as fast as they did. Plots and even humor in this movie as well.,1356566400,,233,3.4150943396226414
8063192,5,B0009MAOAU,I have to say that I am really looking forward to Mr. Stain On Junk Alley.  The bonus episode has got me fixated when that new series is coming out.  I'm definately looking forward when that disc comes out next year.,1130630400,,216,4.2439024390243905
8063193,5,B0009MAOAU,"I bought this dvd recently and it was great. The first 2 episodes was like watching a mini movie, the second 2 were like another mini movie. But the phantom thief ones were the best!!! This Dvd is worth buying!!! Just to make a point i enjoy the english version of all the songs as well as the japanese versions. I think Funimation is great enough to translate these songs into english and even have them redone in english!!!",1130198400,5,425,4.3924050632911396
8063194,4,B0009MAOAU,"I bought this DVD of Case Closed and watched it as soon as I got home. The first two episodes are about a master jewelry theif called The Phantom Theif KId, and how Conan would try to stop him from his next big heist. I thought these episodes were superb! The next two episodes were about an old rich man who had family members fighting over his will or something. These two episodes were kinda confusing to me at times and were not too well-made.",1129939200,,447,4.270588235294118
