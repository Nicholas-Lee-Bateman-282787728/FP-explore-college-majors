2490905,4,B000E5KUJC,"I remember seeing I WALK THE LINE a year or two ago in a John Frankenheimer retrospective at New York's Film Forum.  I saw it frankly because the movie seemed like the runt of the litter -- underappreciated, only screening for one day -- and because I needed an excuse to listen to a bunch of Johnny Cash songs I already knew too well.

Well, my hunch was right.  This movie is a quiet pleasure, full of illicit love, melodrama, and great music.  Apart from a patch near the end that looks so bizarre compared to the rest of the flick that it had to have been reshot later in a studio, the natural photography is great and sets a lyrical mood.

One can see why this movie has been neglected, because it's simple and not showy, but it's a well-told tale, and hopefully DVD will bring it to a new audience.",1139097600,31,804,4.2631578947368425

2490949,5,B000E5KUJC,"I was never a Gregory Peck fan.  - I think he should have won an academy award for this remarkable performance.  All the actors were in top form.  It has been said that Tuesday Weld was ""the best actress of her generation"". She proves it here.  A 27 year old playing a seventeen year old.  The film is archetypal.  The change of life, very stalwart, but very human man happening to him.  Her family,  the father played by the brilliant Ralph Meeker, runs an still with his two boys. -  In order to have sexual access to the daughter (Weld) Peck compromises his integrity - doesn't reveal their illegal activity,  and makes an ""arrangement"" with the father.  (The film reveals shocking but subtle indications of  ""loving"" father/daughter incest.)  - Great ""arrangement"", huh?  Dad pimping his child that he's turned into a sex nymphet, and Peck obsessing enough to regress to the level of an hysterical teenager driven by hormones and his subconscious desire for a return to youth and a life of change and promise. - The ending is indescribable. - Frankenheimer is a genius.  Johnny Cash composed and sang the mountain music as a background for mountain people. As a classical musician, I now ""get"" that music.  Wonderful film: art.",1432425600,6,1231,4.76303317535545

2490952,1,B000E5KUJC,"Gregory Peck plays Henry, the sheriff of a small town. He is married to Ellen Haney. They have a daughter and his father lives with them.  He meets Alma McCain (age unknown) and although he doesn't show it, he is immediately smitten. His wife mentions something later about their own whirlwind romance, so I guess that is his pattern. Alma (Tuesday Weld) is very pretty, but does not seem very bright. She's quite content with her life, poor but happy, cooking and taking care of her menfolks - two brothers and a physically abusive father. She never wants to leave them. She's married but her husband is in prison. Maybe before he went to prison they all lived together. Alma is instructed by her father to go after Henry. Since she has no morals, she complies. Henry would not have sought her out on his own, but since she did, it must mean that she finds him irresistible. Of course he cannot resist this young, helpless girl finding him irresistible. Alma is seemingly guileless and innocent, almost goofy - so much so that there is no chemistry whatsoever between her and Henry. Maybe that's the point. It's all one-sided, but Henry is so self-absorbed that he can't see that. Henry has a hollowness inside that he is sure that Alma will fill, and make him whole.

Henry seems to know that he is being used by her family to keep the revenuers unaware of the McCain's still - but he deludes himself into believing that Alma really cares for him. He's ready to dump his wife, child and father and run away with her. His wife is pretty sure that Henry is seeing someone, but that's okay with her because she read in Reader's Digest that married men his age do start seeing younger girls. Or maybe she read it wrong. Even though he's cheating on her and hurting her, she respects him.

The only character I found half-way compelling was Grandpa (Henry's father). This film was not interesting or believable.",1425859200,5,1908,4.589442815249267

2490987,5,B000E5KUJC,"sometimes the right people get together at the right place and time to create exquisite beauty. in this case, dark, painful, exqusite beauty.
is gregory peck good or evil? his subtle, nuanced performance shows a man battling with conflict. duty or life? die with an empty soul, or gamble everything on finding true happiness and fulfillment? and if duty is the choice, what is the duty?
i had no idea tuesday weld was so talented an actress. the web she wove was so intricate, the only over arching theme is her backwoods adherence to family loyalty, in spite of the potential she shows for enlightenment. is she a liar and deceiver, or is she merely allowing peck's ideas to go where they will? is it her job to dictate peck's conduct?
and estelle parsons, good god i was stunned by the power of her performance. her ability to transmit the feeling of pain, confusion, and desperation at losing the center of her existence was deeply disturbing.
i can tell you as one who grew up in the time and place of this movie, that the depictions of the characters and the background canvas of life in the small town are dead on accurate. the people sitting on the porch are really there, it is not hollywood hyperbole.
i can't say i enjoyed this movie, as it hits too hard and carries too much truth to enjoy, but i can say i am glad i saw it, and it will stay with me as long as i live.",1401148800,4,1379,4.36964980544747

I'm used to see Gregory Peck as the character Atticus Finch. This movie is a far cry from To Kill a Mockingbird.

2491024,5,B000E5KUJC,"This is an older movie (around the 70's), and was filmed partially on my Great-grandfather's property in Smithville, TN.  Although there is no reference to this fact,  I was there when the film was shot and have pictures of the stars. I was in college in Nashville, TN at Belmont University at the time and actually brought friends to watch as well.  At the time, I thought the movie was pretty lame, and although the story is simple, Gregory Peck and Tuesday Weld are still some of my favorite actors and actually do an excellent job even though the scrip didn't give them much to work.  It seemed to be a difficult time for both of them personally and I was pleased to learn that many people who are viewing this movie are giving it a much higher rating than I initially gave it.  The movie is slow-moving, but there are quite a few intricate themes running through-out the narrative and are excellent for using to teach literature in high-school-college literature.  It's also fun to see the scenery in TN although a few scenes are shot at the set in CA.  Unfortunately, it does not depict the best of the country scenes in and around my home-town and paints a negative impression of the south.",1381190400,2,1197,4.53953488372093

2491026,5,B000E5KUJC,"Not to be confused with the 2005 Johnny Cash biopic ""Walk The Line"", this 1970 film directed by John Frankenheimer tells the story of a middle-aged, small-town sheriff, Henry Tawes (Gregory Peck) , who finds himself becoming increasingly disillusioned with his life as a husband and father, and coming to resent his humdrum existence. It could also be argued that he is entering a mid-life crisis, and one day, he stops the daughter of a local moonshiner (played by Ralph Meeker), pretty Alma McCain (Tuesday Weld) and her younger brother for driving without a permit. Captivated by her beauty, he begins a secret affair with her, all the while turning a blind eye to her family's illegal activities. Things become increasingly out of hand as inspectors begin to investigate the goings on in town and Henry's devious deputy (Charles Durning) discovers the liaison and the McCain family's profession. Henry also finds his distraught wife (Estelle Parsons) has also discovered the affair, and he decides to throw all caution to the wind and run away with Alma. Torn between her affection for Henry and her loyalty to her family, Alma's choice and Henry's recklessness result in tragedy and heartbreak.

This movie was very much overlooked when it was first released, but it is a good flick and the performances are superb. The production was shot mainly on location in Tennessee and Johnny Cash provides the soundtrack. This role was a very different one for Gregory Peck, especially at this stage of his career, but he embodies the tightly-wound sheriff expertly. Tuesday Weld is convincing and captivating as a young woman caught in a way of life that not only limits her opportunities but also her choices. Used by her father to keep Henry smitten in order to keep the family business secret, she makes the only choice she feels she can make, but not without cost to Henry.

Columbia released the movie on DVD a few years back, and it is unforgivably very bare-bones (there isn't even a menu), but it is in widescreen and the transfer looks wonderful, capturing the bleak yet lush countryside.

If you're a fan of Gregory Peck and Tuesday Weld, this is a film that must be viewed.",1358553600,6,2181,4.85752688172043

The content is certainly tame today. I would think it would STILL be rated PG. Or is this title similiar to the Universal DVD of Don Knotts in ""The Love God?"" from 1969 that received a PG-13 rating when released on DVD? I thought the rating of M in 1969 would be the equivalent of a PG rating today. Not a PG-13.

2491068,4,B000E5KUJC,"Not to be confused with the 2005 biopic of Johnny Cash, 1970's ""I Walk the Line"" stars Gregory Peck as a taciturn Appalachian sheriff who suffers a mid-life crisis and falls head-over-heels in love with some pretty young thing (Tuesday Weld), the daughter of a local moonshine baron. The sheriff turns a blind eye for obvious reasons and everything's fine, until others find out and his redneck deputy interferes with the ""arrangement.""

WHAT WORKS:

- First of all, how can you go wrong with Gregory Peck? Although I've only seen about a dozen of his movies over the years he's always been an unvoiced favorite of mine. He's tall, noble, masculine, likable, determined and just has an unshowy star quality. Here he plays his usual self with the exception that, facing his mid-life crisis, he makes the wrong choices and hurts everyone involved (more on this below).
- Tuesday Weld was 26 years-old during filming and is easy on the eyes. Her character in the story maintains a naive quality even though what she does is totally wrong. I suppose you could say she's more ignorantly amoral than immoral.
- The film was shot in the beautiful Appalachian hills of North-central Tennessee. The courthouse square scenes were shot in Gainesboro, but the dam scene that opens the movie was shot at Center Hill Dam. The Drive-In movie sequence where they are watching the 1969 Jerry Lewis movie ""Hook, Line and Sinker"" was shot at the Green Hills Drive-in in Carthage (hometown of Al Gore), about 45 minutes from Gainesboro. During the production Gregory Peck, Tuesday Weld, director John Frankenheimer and other cast and crew stayed at the Holiday Inn in Cookeville, TN. All the buildings in Gainsboro are still there (including the pool hall) except the first store that the sheriff went in to that was cattycorner to the courthouse, which was torn down. A small portion of the film was also shot in Northern California, in a little town called Colusa, the seat of Colusa County, but I can't tell which specific scenes. Much of Colusa's architecture has a very Southern influence and has been featured in a number of movies.
- I like the moral of the story: One's actions have a ripple effect -- wrong choices will inevitably hurt not only you but those linked to you, just as right choices bless you and others.
- On that same note, the film effectively shows how a powerful man can be reduced to the strength of a loaf of bread simply by unwisely falling prey to the temptation of some young cutie.
- If you like Johnny Cash this film's a must; it features a handful of his songs.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK:

- The story plays out in an ultra-realistic manner like other films of the 60s and 70s before the brainless ""blockbuster"" came into vogue. This isn't a negative to me because I actually prefer realism but others might not appreciate it, especially the flat vibe of of the first act, but the story picks up steam in the second act and holds till the end.
- Some don't like the film because the usually-noble Peck is playing a sad and lonely adulterer. This is against type and perhaps explains why Peck took the part; he was 53 at the time and likely saw the role as a challenge. Here was an opportunity to play a character who is neither a hero nor anti-hero, a character who feels trapped by routine and meaninglessness, who makes a desperate and ill-fated attempt to drag himself out by means of his desire for a (much) younger woman, the one thing that makes him feel alive again. Peck rose to the challenge admirably but this naturally has the negative effect of stirring anger in the viewer since the sheriff's wife couldn't have been more loving and devoted yet he comes off aloof and uncaring, barely even acknowledging his precious 11 year-old daughter, not to mention the domino-effect problems he willingly shackles himself to in the third act.

[SPOILER ALERT! Don't read this paragraph unless you've seen the film] It's not clear at the end if the sheriff (Peck) dies or not. Yes, he's clearly wounded by the metal hook, but the climax doesn't ever show him falling over dead. I would hope that, at this point, he came to his senses and goes back to restore his relationships with his wife & daughter and never entertains another thought of adultery (assuming he wasn't mortally wounded, of course). Does anyone have any insights about this? [END SPOILER].

FINAL WORD: ""I Walk the Line"" is one of those 'hidden gems' in cinema, a really good film that was never acknowledged and seems to have been lost over time. It's along the lines of the contemporaneous ""Deliverance"" albeit without the sexual perversion and more on the dramatic side, less the adventure. Don't miss out if it sounds like your cup of java.

2491070,5,B000E5KUJC,"For those of us that never really had a girlfriend in high school there was always Thalia Menninger to dream about, just like the love smitten Dobie Gillis in ""The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis."" Tuesday Weld knocked us out with ""Pretty Poision"", released a couple years before this film, and she was the pefect girl for the role opposite Gregory Peck in this film. I'm sure some credit should go to the Johnny Cash soundtrack, along with the other actors, but for me, it's hard to be objective, any movie with Tuesday Weld in it is worth having in the collection. ""Pretty Poision"" is my #1, but ""I Walk the Line"" is very close!",1242345600,6,625,4.443478260869565
2491071,4,B000E5KUJC,"A young Tuesday Weld is not the only reason to watch this movie, but it's right up there. A simple tale of a mature sheriff and young girl. Johnny Cash music plays well into the movie and Gregory Peck is as good as Mr Peck is always. An interesting but not too complicated movie.",1216944000,2,279,4.185185185185185
2491072,4,B000E5KUJC,"The movie, I Walk the Line, was not well known for many years. I tried for 25 years to obtain a tape of this movie, but it was not available. Finally, a few years ago, it became available on DVD.
Fine acting by all the characters.  You get a sense quite early that the ending will not be a happy one.
This is a ""must-see"" film for any fan of Johnny Cash.  His background singing is excellent, and each song reflects the mood of the scene.",1200700800,5,438,4.0813953488372094
2491073,3,B000E5KUJC,"Not to be confused with the much lauded-and righly so-Johnny Cash biopic ""Walk the Line"" this is a gritty slice of downbeat country noir that has much going for it but ultimately becomes a rather gruelling exercise for audiences

Gregory Peck stars as dour but honest Tennessee backwoods sheriff Henry Tawes ,stuck in a  routine marriage and feeling his life slipping by .He falls head over heels in love with nubile teenager Alma McCain (Tuesday Weld)a decision that proves to have disastrous consequences .Her father -played by Ralph Meeker is the local moonshine baron ,and he ruthlessly exploits Taws obsession with his daughter to compel him to turn a blind eye to his moonshine operation ,and to make sure the Federal agents do the same thing .Things escalate when McCain senior murders Peck's deputy (Charles Durning)and forces Peck to help cover up the crime .From there things move to an ending marked by the  type of inevitability associated with Greek tragedy
The movie is superbly well acted and all the principals acquit themselves splendidly .I must single out Tuesday Weld for special mention however .In my opinion no actress ever has suggested amorality and sensuality so well in US cinema and it is a pity she never really brought this unique gift to more mainstream roles .She nails the accent to perfection as she does the dumb innocence and the sensuous somewhat amoral creature lurking beneath this veneer .Special mention also to Estelle Prsons as Tawes' pathetic and clinging wife and strong cameos from Durning and Bellamy add weight to proceedings ,backing up Peck' sterling work in the lead role
Johnny Cash contibutes 5 songs to the soundtrack and they help establish the bleak ,haunting mood of the piece and form an emotional commentary to events on screen .The whole movie feels and looks authentic in its sobriety and grittiness ,and yet herein lies my chief caveat .It is just too downbeat to be actually entertaining and even the bleakest peice needs some lightening of the mood which we sismply do not get here ,It is as if the makers of the movie have ignored the need of spectators to be entertained and for this reason I mark it down slightly. It is still a powerful and emotional piece of work -country noir as bleak as the best country songs are and conveying a similar emotional kick",1192579200,21,2324,4.848866498740554
2491074,5,B000E5KUJC,"I don't know what Amazon has against this film.  This was another spur of the moment buy, and again I wasn't disappointed.  The acting is excellent--everyone is terrific in their role, especially Weld and Peck, who each play off the other's hidden agenda quite well.  They're both manipulative and decitful, but she's the more ""honest"" in only trying to help her family.  On the other hand, Peck's character is just downright creepy, with some deep-seated control freak issues that just compresses him more and more.  You can see him treat her as a person less as the movie progresses, and by the end, you're hoping she gets away with her family.

A well-constructed psychological drama, with great buildup of tension as the noose seems to close in on all sides.  Don't really know what all the talk was for on that 'bedroom scene'.  It was really quite chaste by today's standards.",1171238400,17,882,4.7947019867549665
2491075,5,B000E5KUJC,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Not just about temptation but about longing for a life (even if unattainable) that does not so much resemble the hell that is your own. To me, it's about someone who is emotionally dead (peck) trying desperately to live again thru his impossible dream of running away with a moonshiner's daughter who is probably just using him. Weld's performance is, in a word, haunting. No matter how many times you see this film, you never REALLY know what she is thinking. Is that the character? I think not. That is the mystic of Tuesday Weld. A must see, I'd say. But very misunderstood. NOT A SECOND RATE LOLITA!!!!",1155254400,12,653,4.5423728813559325

8105845,3,B000E5KUJC,"Gergory Peck stars in what many feel is his worst movie in ""I walk The Line"". I believe many feel that way about the film because he so goes against his ""type"" that he always portrays; honest, humble, stalwart and instead plays a weak, foolish, middle-age married Man chasing after Tuesday Weld in a role I really, really liked. Peck is the town Sheriff and Weld is the daughter of local moonshiners. He falls under Welds spell and throws his life away thinking he can escape all his troubles running away with her. But Weld is not the innocent she appears and the film goes in directions one couldn't have predicted leading up to a shocking conclusion. If you are a fan of GP as I am, you have to see this film at least once to compare it to all the other heroic roles he's had. You will come to appreciate that's why its called ""acting"", and this is one of Peck's best performances tho one of his least likeable characters.",1524787200,,925,4.383720930232558
