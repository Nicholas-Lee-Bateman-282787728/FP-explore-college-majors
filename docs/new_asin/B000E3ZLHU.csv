8105547,4,B000E3ZLHU,"This is a simple story but very well executed.  Each cast member gives a strong performance and is very believeable.  David Soul is stellar as usual as he plays Jake Seaton who is successful in his career but struggling with all his relationships...twice divorced for being (according to his ex-wives) ""cold, selfish and inconsiderate;"" estranged from his father, and afraid to commit to the woman who loves him.  His son (Moosie Drier) adores him, however, and Jake decides to honor the dying boy's request to visit his grandfather.  The story does not focus on the illness but on the family dynamics.  The plot is realistic and the emotional scenes are restrained but impact the viewer. Barnard Hughes plays Harry Seaton respected and liked by his community, but so bitter towards his son that he misses no chance to say deliberately hurtful criticisms of Jake.  Jake retaliates and the father and son continue the destructive quarrel until two words begin to heal the breach: ""thank you."".

There are also some beautiful shots of the Pacific coast to enjoy.  As another reviewer pointed out, the one drawback to the production is the soundtrack.  Otherwise  you should prepare to enjoy a movie that celebrates hope for the hurting.",1512259200,,1234,4.975609756097561

This is a beautiful story of family reconciliation, emotional healing, love, and impending death; a real ""tear-jurker"" for me. Grab your tissue box before you sit down to  watch it! I was sooo happy to find it.",1435190400,,325,4.327868852459017
8105549,5,B000E3ZLHU,"I purchased this film on VHS, having not seen the movie for many years.  It was a good as I remembered.  I think Barnard Hughes is one of those rare actors who steals scenes without you even noticing.  He has 101 credits to his name on IMDB.  Some of my favorites include Homeward Bound, Past the Bleachers and Sister Act 2, Back in the Habit.  He passed in 1996 at the age of 90 just days prior to his 91st birthday.

In this 1980 movie, he plays Harry Seaton, father to Jake Seaton (David Soul) and grandfather to Bobby Seaton (Moosie Drier).  He is a stubborn old man who doesn't get along very well with his son and they haven't seen each other in years.  He adores his grandson.  The grandson is terminally ill and the grandfather knows nothing about it.  The grandson wants to spend his vacation by going to the napa valley to see his grandfather and his vineyards, passing up a trip to Hawaii.  His father reluctantly agrees and the two make the long trip.

The gripping drama that results from the strained family dynamics is well done, despite the limited budget.  It's a story of love and loss.  It's also about things that endure and has a good message.

I think this one is my favorite performances of Barnard Hughes, and he did a lot of work.  The soundtrack dates the movie and it's the one thing I would change if I could.  I recommend this one.",1343692800,,1360,4.354581673306773
