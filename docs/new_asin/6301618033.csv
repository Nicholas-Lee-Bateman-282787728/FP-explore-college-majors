338380,1,6301618033,"I loved the series back in the day.  When I was a little girl, I idolized Barbara Eden.  I watched Jeannie whenever I could (which wasn't easy back in the day of one black and white tv with rabbit ears!).  I still remember my parents turning it off because of bad reception and I was so upset because I'd never seen the episode in question.

Anyway, Barbara Eden is charming in this.  I look at the young crop of actresses today and very few of them have the charm of Barbara Eden. I personally think that  Days of Our Lives should have hired her to play ""Jo Johnson"" after Joy Garrett died - the physical resemblence is amazing, and Barbara has the same sweet vulnerability that Joy had.

The movie was well acted and at times very funny... but seriously over the top with the massive felonies committed by Stella - harmful dangerous actions that could have resulted in tragedy. Stella's actions are somewhat psychotic.

Stargate-SG1 fans will appreciate seeing Senator Kinsey as her boyfriend.",1165190400,3,995,4.645714285714286
338381,5,6301618033,I have always loved this movie.  It came out when I was just a kid and at that time it was a little raunchy.  I am so glad it is available on DVD.,1143072000,2,146,3.393939393939394

338383,3,6301618033,"HARPER VALLEY P.T.A. is a cute comedy, based on the chart-topping country song from Jeannie C. Riley (written by Tom T. Hall).

Barbara Eden plays the vivacious Mrs Stella Johnson, who walks to the beat of her own drum, much to the horror of her strait-laced neighbours and the members of the Harper Valley P.T.A.  One afternoon Stella's daughter Dee (Susan Swift) comes home from school with a letter from the secretary of the P.T.A. which threatens to expell Dee if Stella does not conform.  Stella and her wacky best friend Alice (Nanette Fabray) decide that a little revenge is on the cards...!

This film is very much a one-note caper comedy, but the performances of Barbara Eden and Nanette Fabray are so wonderful that they greatly enliven the limitations of the material.  Susan Swift is lovely as Dee, and the formidable president of the P.T.A. is played by Audrey Christie in her best fashion.  Also featuring Louis Nye, Ronny Cox, Pat Paulsen and John Fiedler.

338385,5,6301618033,"This is effectively a story about a nice widowed fast city woman, with painted lips and long tapering lashes wearing short short mini skirts.  This vamp and vixen moves to a quiet way conservative sleepy town named Harper Valley.  She dares to join the PTA that bastion of moral rectitude.  Her outspoken progressive ways are immediately held suspect.  She in her short skirts is proclaimed by Harper Valley PTA a vile role model for young people.  She is labelled by the PTA as a person not fit to shape the minds of impressionable youth.
She is in truth a good woman of honest if not pure motives and unsullied honor.  The town would have you think she was the devils agent...P>  The song of the same name tends to tell the story of the movie but its still well worth the watching.  It's more funny now than shocking....",1045353600,38,822,4.506756756756757

338822,5,6301618033,"I vaguely remembered hearing the title song in the 70's as a small child infrequently, as it was a hit in 1968, even before I was born. I can watch this movie over and over and just remember why the 70's were so GREAT! Barbara Eden, timeless beauty of "" I Dream Of Jeannie"" fame, Nanette Fabray, excellent character actress back in the day, as Alice, Stella's best friend (Eden) ""AKA"" partner in crime. After Dee(Susan Swift)!comes home with a letter directly from the secretary of "" The Harper Valley PTA"" threatening expulsion of Dee, (Swift), Eden's daughter, if Eden doesn't tone done her risqu mini skirts & revealing outfits. She learns that the entire bunch of the PTA are a bunch of phony hypocrites, after Alice spills the beans to her on each of their indiscretions, as she the owner of the main salon in town, Lamoderne. Methodically Stella sets out to get even with each & every member & to expose them for what they really are. It is original and it is definitely cheesy a throwback to typical 70's movies. It also is so worth the price & will provide a lot of laughs as she gets back with more vengeance & originality as she goes down her list of ""get-backs"". The only decent PTA member is a younger "" Ronny Cox"" of Beverly Hills Cop fame. He is very engaging and endearing & is in Stella's corner as he knows the group are all hypocrites. It is a great, wholesome movie, family friendly, with a great love story & a happy ending! A walk down memory lane....",1453248000,7,1472,4.435424354243542

338869,3,6301618033,"Released in 1978, Harper Valley PTA stars Barbara Eden as a beautiful outcast in a small Ohio town of conservative hypocrites. She exposes their shameful secrets and, with the help of her pal (Nanette Fabray) and daughter (Susan Swift), pulls all sorts of humiliating pranks, not to mention runs for the position of PTA president.  Ronny Cox plays her wannabe boyfriend while John Fiedler, Audrey Christie and numerous others are on hand as townspeople.

Based on Jeannie C. Rileys hit song, this is a fairly amusing light comedy satirizing the ethos of middle America. It didn't do so great at the box office but it was a later hit on TV and led to a TV series. While the movie was rated PG itd be considered PG-13 today and almost R-rated in light of a totally buff John Fiedler scene (from behind) and a sex education sequence. Although these scenes surprised me (because I thought it was a PG movie) they're no big deal in the context of shenanigans of the movie. Speaking of the shenanigans, some of them are pretty outrageous, like the elephant sequence and the hay/manure scene. The latter couldve easily ended on a fatal note, but the comedic air keeps the tone light. Barbara was 46 during filming and never looked better -- cute and curvy. I laughed more than I expected to, but not enough to give it a higher rating. In any case, the movies worth seeing just to enjoy going back to 1977 Ohio. Its like a time capsule.

The original version runs 102 minutes and was shot in Lebanon, Ohio, and nearby areas.

338977,3,6301618033,"I wasn't really sure if I should give this movie three or four stars. I settled on three because after I thought about it for a while, I decided that I thought Harper Valley PTA was just okay.

Anyways, let me just get on with my review. I thought the movie was okay, as I said before. I vaguely remembered hearing the Jeannie C. Riley song, so I just thought I'd give the movie version a try. I was especially excited that Barbara Eden (of I Dream of Jeannie fame) was playing the lead! When I ordered it, I was so ready to watch it, so I quickly just popped it in the DVD player.

First off, the story that is told within the song is told within the first ten minutes or so of the movie. Stella Johnson (Barbara Eden) gets a letter from the PTA informing her that she is considered an unfit mother and that if her attitude doesn't change, proceedings will be taken to suspend her daughter from school. Just like in the song, Mrs. Johnson goes to the PTA meeting and tells everyone about all the ""skeletons"" in the closets of the holy-than-thou types sitting on the Board of the PTA. She closes her speech with the line: ""Face it, this is just a little Peyton Place, and you're all Harper Valley hypocrites!"" The story of the song that is told right off in the movie plays something like a dramatized music video. The rest of the movie is merely Mrs. Johnson getting back at those that accused her of being an unfit mother. In each ""segment"", as I call them, Mrs. Johnson sets up a plan with her best friend, Alice (Nanette Fabray), to cause humiliation to those holy-than-thous of the PTA board. In between the ""segments"", the short scenes consist of Mrs. Johnson and Alice chatting or Mrs. Johnson's cutesy mother/daughter relationship with her daughter.

Harper Valley PTA isn't a terrible movie, it's just not a movie that can be viewed multiple times over, at least not for me. It's too long. It was actually kind of a dumb idea, when you think about it, to stretch a 3 minute, 16 second song into over 100 minutes of a movie. It doesn't work. The song had a simple and cute concept, but the movie stretches it and beats the horse to death. Quite honestly, I didn't even finish watching Harper Valley PTA, I couldn't. I just got too dull and long.

I'm not saying that this movie won't be appealing to everyone, I'm merely stating the facts I've gathered from my opinions of the movie for my personal review.",1434672000,3,2414,4.4058295964125564
338978,3,6301618033,"well i just don't know lol if your tired and in a 80's comedy type mode and just want some movie fluff to kinda view its ok.by todays standards i cant think of any of the kids now a days would give this even 5 minutes but for those of us that remember the song (which is a classic) n like Barbara from I dream of jeannie and want to see her in something then its ok but it def feels like it drags alot of the time n the daughter is a one note type acting and i only remember her in a horror movie called Audrey Rose with Anthony Hopkins n even that one is sooooo dated but the gal is just a one note type actress in that (u know she stands there n looks out into nothing and then screams, thats bout it on her acting n never heard about her ever again) but its nice to see Nannette from the old mgm musicals n to see alot of character actors that you don't know their names but know you have seen them in some other movies so a star for them, a star for nanette and a star for Barbara.",1434326400,,985,3.8097560975609754

It is good to remember that sometimes those of us who are lower in economic scale can often find ways to bring the top down with hilarious results.

This movie is definitely great for 'taking you back' if you need a night of nostalgia.  But, for pure entertainment, don't bother.  Stick to Downton Abbey if you want a good drama.

339386,4,6301618033,"This movie was shocking in its day as it broke down cultural norms of the ""truth telling"" variety. In retrospect, the movie is merely funny but there is still a meaningful message here. Namely, stand up for your rights and don't be afraid to point out the hypocrisy of a corrupt system.

For most of us the thought of traveling to Washington DC or our state capital is intimidating and inconvenient. Don't worry about that level. Start local. So says this endearing movie. Stella Johnson started with the local P.T.A. (Parents Taking Action) group. Find your local version of such as organization and get involved. You never know what good you may be able to accomplish.",1313280000,,670,4.775862068965517
339387,5,6301618033,It is a great movie and is based on the Song that was originally sung by Jeannie C. Riley and she sings it on the movie. My Wife and I both enjoyed it very much.,1290988800,,161,3.6285714285714286
339428,3,6301618033,"Tom Hall's song ""Harper Valley PTA"", sung by Jeannie C. Reilly, about hypocricy in a small town, inspired this film, starring Barbara Eden as the Stella Johnson, the mother who ""socked it to the Harper Valley PTA"". The first few scenes of the film follows the song very closely. After crashing the PTA meeting and exposing the hypocricy of the PTA members, the PTA doesn't exactly get nicer to her, and Stella, with the help of her friend Alice (Nanette Fabray), decide to get revenge, by playing pranks on the various PTA members. She also gets help from Willis Newton (Ronny Cox), a member of the PTA who disapprove of the way the PTA is run. He even talks her into running for president of the PTA.

The story is thin but there's quite a lot of fun scenes, although the overall pace of the movie might have been a bit better if it was a little bit shorter. As it is, there are some parts where it gets a bit slow. Acting is good. Eden is a great choice for the lead role and she's also helped by a good supporting cast. Overall this is a good but not great lightweight feelgood movie that you'll probably like if you liked the song.",1286236800,3,1135,4.328638497652582

339479,5,6301618033,"The message of ""Harper Valley PTA"" is a simple one: don't judge others unless you want trouble. Barbara Eden, from TV's ""I Dream of Jeannie"" fame, stars as Stella, a single woman living in Harper Valley, Ohio with her daughter. The girl comes home from school one day with a letter from the local parent/teacher association stating they do not approve of Stella's lifestyle and dress code. The plot of the film starts off here as Stella seeks revenge on all the PTA members by going into their lives and revealing they are not the prim and proper individuals that they portray. The movie is based on the hit Jeannie C. Reilly song of the same name from 1968, written by ""The Storyteller"" himself, Tom T. Hall. The movie would also spawn a minor successful TV series on NBC in the early eighties that only lasted 30 episodes. ""Harper Valley PTA"" is a simple and funny comedy that everyone will enjoy. If you like seeing snotty people get their comeuppance you will enjoy this film. The best part of the movie is the famous ""hair scene"" where a high-class snob has a dinner party. Earlier in the day she had her hair done without knowing that Stella had the chemicals for the hair color tampered with. You will roar with laughter when you see what happens.
 The DVD, unfortunately, is barebones, and the trailer isn't even included. At least, though, this true comedy classic is available on DVD for posterity. There is a one sided sheet of paper that comes with the disc featuring the chapter search.",1249862400,,1499,4.614232209737827

339482,4,6301618033,"Okay, okay, so I know that this movie is a bit out-dated- so I'l be nice.
Yes, it is 2008. Was this movie filmed even in the century? No. So! Now that we've gotten past the effects and quality, we'll move on!
If you like corny or cheesy comedies, then here is a flick for you. I'm all about silly movies or corny films, but...
well, I'll put it this way. I can never stop watching a movie once I've started it. It's nearly impossible for me and I have probably only done it twice before. I didn't purposefully shut the DVD player off or anything, but I did keep myself busy with chatting on the internet the whole time and eventually just taking off my glasses and falling asleep with it still playing.
Not to say that I didn't finish it the next day.. I did, eventually. Though I was glad that it was finally over. I can see how this film maybe could have been viewed as outrageous or maybe even hilarious?? back in the 70s due to the nature of the movie... Wait, no. No I can't. I'm sorry, I just really disliked this film and will probably never watch it again. It didn't have a strong plot, did not grasp the viewer's attention, and didn't keep me laughing (at all). Where we are supposed to feel bad for this poor mother being picked on by the PTA, they don't build a strong character to feel for. The mother is a terrible influence on her daughter and breaks the law constantly while trying to prove?? that everyone on the PTA board are terrible people. All she proved to me was, she was just as bad, if not WORSE than any of those snobby board people!
A terrible scene, though, is the end. Now, there are a lot of corny scenes and numerous scenes that just don't make any sense or try to help the plot in this movie, but the final scene was terrible. I was just so relieved that this mess of a movie was finally over that I jumped up and yelled ""oh thank god!"" and hit the power switch as quick as I could to shut off the cheesy soundtrack music.
I would say, if you were a tweenager in the 70s, you may enjoy this movie. Other than that, I'd say don't bother. Hit me up, I'll send you my copy. I sure won't be using it for anything!!

339483,3,6301618033,"If you are looking for intelligent entertainment, don't see this movie.  If you enjoy revenge movies and are looking for some brain dead fun, and an excuse to look at Barbara Eden in tight clothes and short skirts, this movie is made for you.

The plot is pretty simple, the local PTA decides that Stella Johnson (Barbara Eden) is dressing too sexy and acting to wild for the small town of Harper Valley.  They send home a letter to this effect with her daughter.  Stella responds by going public with the private sins of the hypocritical members of the PTA.  This makes for a cute three minute theme song, but it gets stretched a little thin for a full length movie.

To fill out the remaining time, we get to watch Stella get her revenge by pulling increasingly more ridiculous (and criminal) ""practical jokes"".  These include everything from taping the sexual liaisons of an unmarried teacher with the mailman to driving elephants stolen from the local circus (and painted pink) through the home of the town drunk.  When none of that proves to be enough to fill-up the minutes remaining in the movie, we get a new plot involving Stella running for PTA president and the current PTA president having people kidnapped and the school robbed to stop her.

Barbara Eden is easy on the eyes.  The rest of the movie ranges from painfully dumb to pretty funny.  If you can suspend your disbelief (and your ability to think critically) you can have some fun watching this movie.",1214006400,2,1472,4.666666666666667

339487,5,6301618033,"This picture hit the theaters in 1978 starring Barbara Eden as Stella Johnson, Ronny Cox as Willis Newton and Nanette Fabray as Alice Finely. The pictured opens with the song that we come to know and hear along with a view of the school district where the whole thing gets started. As the song continues to play, they keep showing views of the school and the town. After the song is over Stella Johnson is in her house singing and dancing when her daughter Dee, comes home from school and can't even get in the front door. Therefore, Stella opens the door and Dee goes straight to her room without even speaking to her mom. Stella goes and checks on Dee and is given a letter that is address to her from the Harper Valley PTA. The letter states that if Stella doesn't change her ways they will take the proper measures to have her daughter expelled from school. Therefore, Stella and Alice sit down and have a nice long talk with Alice telling Stella every dirty secret that she has on every member of the Harper Valley PTA board. It just so happen that very afternoon the PTA was holding its annual meeting. Therefore, Stella and her daughter go to that PTA meeting and Stella was loaded with dirty secrets that were just waiting to come out. The next day when Dee comes home from school her entire front yard is covered with toilet paper. That's when Will Newton enters! Will is a construction worker who's building the schools new gym. Will helps Stella clean up her front yard and then later that night while Stella and Dee were eating someone throws a rock through the dining room window. Therefore, Stella goes to see Alice and now it's time for war with every member of the PTA. I like this movie because of the comedy and the acting of Barbara Eden. It was nice to see her in another role other then Jeanine. I give this movie 5 weasel stars.",1177113600,,1850,4.428152492668621
