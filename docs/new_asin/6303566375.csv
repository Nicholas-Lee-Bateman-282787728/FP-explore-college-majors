2688021,3,6303566375,"Klaus Kinski plays the son of a Nazi war criminal, and he's a serial killer who takes extensive notes. He rents rooms to women, spies on them from the air shaft (not actually a crawlspace), and has a thing for rats. For a slasher movie, it's really not all that gory. It's not a GREAT movie, but it's got more of a story line than a lot of bad horror flicks.",1351123200,3,358,4.056338028169014
2688022,2,6303566375,"My roommates and I just watched this movie on instant video.  I was bummed that the cover was a little misconceiving as to the content of the film.  I didn't enjoy the set design, characters, or plot that much, but the soundtrack was cool. The peeping tom aspect (I feel like there is a lot homage to the film Peeping Tom) was interesting, but I feel like it was downplayed by the fact that the killer is a nazi murderer. Anyway, it's kind of fun to watch.",1350086400,2,456,4.2298850574712645
2688023,3,6303566375,"Klaus Kinski (1926-91) plays a demented landlord with perverted intentions in Crawlspace (1986), a creepy suspense thriller with ample potential that unfortunately, isn't quite fully realized.  While not quite delivering in the scares and gore department, Kinski's performance makes for what is still an entertaining watch.

While working in a hospital in Argentina, physician Karl Gunther (Kinski) had many patients that mysteriously died.  Evil runs in the family, as Gunther's father was executed as a war criminal, for his role in the torture of prisoners in Nazi concentration camps.  Now the landlord of an apartment building in America, the demented Gunther keeps a woman prisoner in the attic, and also spies on his female tenants, by crawling through the ventilation ducts, and peeping into their rooms through the air register grill.

After Gunther eliminates a tenant who wanders where she should not have, college student Lori Bancroft (Talia Balsam) becomes the building's newest resident.  Addicted to killing, Gunter strikes when the opportunity presents itself, or whenever necessary.  After each murder, Gunther plays a game of Russian roulette, and upon surviving, he accepts that his fate is to continue to kill.

Soon, it is time for Lori to become his next victim, but unlike before, Gunther does not hide his identity.  Unfortunately, although there are a couple of nice surprises on the way to the finish, the way things play out is a bit underwhelming, with Lori ""terrorized"" by a few docile and disinterested rats, and fleeing at a less than full speed, most of the time.

The attempts to keep things atmospheric and scary, are somewhat successful.  Kinski gets around fairly well for a 60 year old, but never the most physically imposing fellow, the amount of energy he brings to the role, appears to have been limited.  Kinski has no major fight scenes, and any bloodshed is mostly due to the use of traps.  Rather than a direct confrontation, Gunther resorts to trickery at the end.

With a bit more nastiness, Crawlspace could have been really special.  Unfortunately, there's not much violence, and while the voyeuristic aspect is explored, it's not taken as far as it could have been.  With some nice darkly humorous moments, the movie does build to a dramatic conclusion, but just lacks energy at the finish.  It's still worth a look for Prime members, as the film can be hard to find on DVD.",1349136000,3,2424,5.035087719298246

2688025,5,6303566375,"I RECENTLY RENTED THIS MOVIE OVER THE WEEKEND, I LOVED IT.

I THOUGHT THAT THE MOVIE WAS CREEPY AND SUSPENSFUL IN A HITCHCOCK SORT OF FASHION. I LOVED THE VILLIAN IN THIS FILM, DESPITE OF FACT THAT HE'S INSANE, BUT BILLIANT. I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT I FEEL PITY FOR HIM(MEANING THAT I UNDERSTAND). IF YOU LIKE CREEPY AND SUSPENSFUL FILMS IN HITCHCOCK STYLE, THAN I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE.",1140307200,2,395,4.563380281690141
2688026,5,6303566375,"The other reviews have given away enough of this film.

Just watch it. Kinski has a malevolence that few can match, and he delivers in spades.

When he is finally  noticed, the method he uses to despatch an investigator will likely make you check chairs forever after.

It's grotesque, escapist  horror delivered by a skilled performer, and an absolutely brilliant villain of the screen.",1106784000,7,387,4.984375
2688027,5,6303566375,"Box office favorite and perennial villian KLAUS KINSKI stars in this horrifying and gruesome thriller as a crazed maniac who is obsessed with traping young women and then slowly torturing them to death.
Karl Guenther (KINSKI) is a conscientious landlord who looks out for his young and attractive tenants. Jessica, the rising young soap opera star, Harriet, a sensuous and vivacious secretary and Sophie, an accomplished pianist who enjoys wild fantasy sex with her boyfriend...all live in Karl's well kept apartments. The only discord is the ""tap, tap, tap"" sound at night from the crawlspace above their rooms. Karl tells them it's rats, but in reality it is Karl spying on them. One by one the tenants become his victims...each one put to a gruesome test. Only one tenant remains to disclose the diabolical Karl and she enters the crawlspace-she is alone with a madman capable of anything!
Enter CRAWLSPACE...and enter a new dimension of terror!",1024790400,7,948,5.083333333333333
2688028,5,6303566375,"I'm 26 years old and have seen a lot of movies. I saw Crawlspace on tv one time and, to this day, it remains as one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. No special effects, no computer-generated monsters, just a crazy, spooky old man on a mission.",991872000,5,249,4.208333333333333
2688029,3,6303566375,"In every review I've seen of this movie (yes, all TWO of them), it's been compared to ""Peeping Tom,"" which I haven't seen, so I'll be at a slight disadvantage while I review ""Crawlspace.""  The plot has Klaus Kinski (the German actor you might remember from the 1979 remake of ""Nosferatu"")--looking like Beethoven playing Dracula--as a creepy landlord who only rents apartments out to beautiful women...then systematically kills them.  It turns out his father was a Nazi scientist who experimented on Jews during World War II, and the genes begin to show after a pretty college student (Talia Balsam, daughter of Martin?) shows up at the complex.
""Crawlspace"" is actually quite impressive given its low budget.  Kinski--who obviously did this movie for the paycheck--is the central driving force, as his murdering, makeup-smearing, goose-stepping Nazi keeps things intensely interesting.  Unfortunately, the rest of the cast is dense and undefined, and serve only as fodder for the horrible deaths that start up in the last act.  If the student/Nazi relationship had been done in more detail, this could have been an interesting take on Stephen King's ""Apt Pupil,"" but alas it doesn't work.  But so seldom is the film dull--it's paced quickly and only runs 80 minutes--that you probably won't mind its lack of depth.
Fans of genre horror will most likely appreciate ""Crawlspace"" more than a casual moviegoer.",986947200,7,1407,5.176211453744493

2688031,4,6303566375,"Crawlspace is a nicely done 80s Slasher/Thriller starring the always creepy Klaus Kinski as a Psychotic landlord who only rents to beautiful young women, whom he spies on and tries to kill. Kinski really looks freaky when he puts on eyeliner and bright red lipstick. I have no idea what the point is but it was effective none the less.

The kills are pretty good and creative with nicely done effects. If you're squeamish about rats this movie will really creep you out. All in all it's a memorable slice of 80s slasher cinema.",1423526400,,527,4.6063829787234045

2688034,5,6303566375,"Klaus Kinski is one of my favorite actors! I'd recommend this movie to his fans! My main complaint with this film is it's short running time. It seems like it's over shortly after it begins! Including the end credits sequence, the movie is about 80 mins. Fans of gore fests should look elsewhere! This movie is more along the lines of a thriller than a horror movie. However, the premise is more or less why it falls into the horror genre.
This movie has some very poor blood and gore effects...but it doesn't keep this movie from being an entertaining film!
I like this movie and I have seen it many times! I like the premise and the location in which the story takes place.
There was so much untapped potential here! As far as the choice for the leading role...it couldn't have been better!
Kinski takes this role and has a lot of fun with it!
Regardless of the untapped potential, this is still a fun time to be had! Recommended to fans of cheesy horror films and for fans of Klaus Kinski!",1414195200,,992,4.396739130434782

2688036,5,6303566375,"Before Hannibal Lecter, there was  Dr. Kari Gunther (Klaus Kinskifirst time I've seen him in an English speaking role and he does great!) , a sophisticated man who found inspiration in the diaries of his Nazi father. He has a ""special"" relationship with death, one which he is fascinated with and documents and studies methodically. One by one, he picks off the female residents of the apartment building he runs, as well as their male visitors. Our first glimpse at the film is as one doomed tenant enters his sanctum, discovering a dank chamber filled with torture equipment, live rats, Nazi memorabilia and a woman in a tiny cage who cannot talk because, Guther explains, stepping out of the shadows, he has cut her tongue out.

8155471,4,6303566375,"This was a different kind of 80s horror film. In a time when slashers were all the rage & ruled the box office along came Crawlspace. Set entirely in an apartment building where the landlord is also a crazy murderer. His preferred method to kill is making/setting traps with the exception of 1 stabbing he does. What makes the film really stand out is the performance my Klaus Kinski as said landlord. Very cold & detached about killing & crazy as well. There isn't a lot of gore or blood in this one & a few of the kills happen off screen but that didn't stop me from enjoying the movie anyway. As for special features there the trailer. TV spot, commentary, interviews & a short film Please Kill Mr. Kinski by the same director of Crawlspace where he talks about how hard it was to work with Klaus. Worth a look if you want something a bit different from the 80s & also for the performance by Kinski.",1444694400,,902,4.34319526627219
