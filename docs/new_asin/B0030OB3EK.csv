8385992,3,B0030OB3EK,"I forgot how much I paid for it, probably closer to $30. The material is displayed in 720p only and we have to use the HDTV's stretch functions to get a larger picture, so the picture is not really sharp. English subtitle appears to be hard-coded, but the font looks like it's printed out with a low-resolution dot-matrix printer where the characters don't always line up, and was running out of ink. It's readable, but definitely an eye-strain. However, this poor font lasted throughout the first 6-7 episodes. The plot is about young friendship and love. The female lead (pretty) started out blind due to an illness, and the story was quite touching in the first 5-6 episodes. At that point, the plot turned too unhappy for my wife to continue to watch(!?). There's a very nice song written by the male protagonist and sung near the end by the female lead. Since I've still haven't watched the rest of the movie, I can't comment more about the story.",1375401600,,952,4.6390532544378695
