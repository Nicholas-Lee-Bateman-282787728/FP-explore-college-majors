8242130,1,B0011NVC5W,"i've never let an anime title's genre sway my judgement. be it action/adventure, mystery, mecha, horror, or in this case yuri, a good show is a good show. THIS IS NOT A GOOD SHOW. i thought maybe this was one of those series that starts out slow and gets better as it goes. i was mistaken. i have never been so thoroughly unentertained by an anime title. the plot is uninspired, the characters uninteresting, and the sporadic attempts at humor fail soundly. if you're having trouble sleeping i suggest popping this one in the dvd player. you'll be out in under 15 minutes.",1245024000,,572,4.563106796116505
8242131,5,B0011NVC5W,"This was a very enjoyable yuri anime. I bought all five dvds and do not regret them. This is the story of several characters, but focuses mostly on Shizumi and Nagisa, the latter a naive transfer student unsure how to handle the attentions of the school Etoil, Shizumi. There is evidence that Shizumi is a housebreaker, and that Nagisa is the next in line for her 'affections.' But the story is not so clear as that, as dark painful secrets rest in Shizumi, and drive the older girl in a way that only the younger can save her from...
If you enjoy yuri romance then I'm sure you'll enjoy this. There are no overt sexual situations, as it deals mostly with the needs of the heart, but there is mild nudity and the clear understanding that 'it' happens.
It can be a bit 'overly' cute, but I enjoyed it none the less.",1231891200,2,814,4.3618421052631575
8242132,5,B0011NVC5W,I am a big fan of Yuri anime (not hentai) and this story is very moving. Dont want to give away any spoilers because I have seen all 26 episodes of this anime and all I have to say is this is the first anime that made me cry in a good way. Highly recommended for Yuri lovers!!!,1212710400,,277,3.793103448275862
8242133,5,B0011NVC5W,"This was my first yuri anime and i must say that it is so far one of the most memorable in my mind. I hope that all Strawberry panic fans pick up the dvds, manga, and light novel that are being release. The more we support SP the more merchandise we will get here in the U.S. and we can only hope that maybe we can get a 2nd season of SP!!",1207353600,3,339,3.7222222222222223
8242134,5,B0011NVC5W,The show is intresting.. from the relationships it follows and the story it creates. I just wonder why amazon is not selling the frist title? intresting. thrid partys?,1205020800,2,167,5.0
8242135,5,B0011NVC5W,"Very beaughtiful love story(-es?) (there are several parallel lovestories going). Good mix of school comedy and drama, beautiful music, nice-drawn memorizable characters. Though it's rated as 'yuri', there's no hentai or even ecchi (better to rate it as 'shoujo-ai'). yes, this story is about love between girls, but who cares? =) Bought R2 license already, now going to support the american one.",1203984000,5,396,5.403225806451613
8242136,5,B0011NVC5W,"I would have to say that this anime is one of the best stories I have seen in my many years of watching anime.  The main characters names are Aoi Nagisa, Hanazono Shizuma, and Suzumi Tamao.  The main story covers the relationship between Nagisa and Shizuma but the story also touches on a couple other relationships between other characters in the story. This anime is a total of 26 episodes long and in my opinion is well worth the time and money to see.  In short this anime is a very good choice for yuri lovers (not hentai) and i would recommend this anime with a 5 star rating.",1200268800,9,582,4.321100917431193
