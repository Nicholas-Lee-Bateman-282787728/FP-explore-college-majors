7889740,2,6305472327,"The fight to get Battlecade: Extreme Fighting part 2 in a location where officials wouldn't stop the show was the most compelling story of this DVD. Great behind-the-scenes footage of what went on before this early MMA event actually aired. A lot of drama, but not in the ring. While John Peretti is known for his good matchmaking, the results didn't help his reputation.
As for the card, the first fight between Jason Canals and Nigel Scantelbury kicked things of positively. Both fighters gave it their all. Things went south from there. Every favorite won and won with ease. I think every fight went under 1 minute. The Brazilians who impressed in Extreme Fighting 1, had it too easy this go around.
An interesting fight was the Jean Riviere versus Carlos Newton encounter. Riviere was originally supposed to fight Orlando Weit, but Weit pulled out leaving Newton as the substitute.  Carlos Newton at the time was making his pro debut, and weighed lighter than what the ""tale of the tape"" read. Early on you can see Newton's incredible athletic style as he tried to take out Rivere, who weighed 115 pounds heavier. Fighting with a Gi, maybe had something to do with the conclusion. An interesting fight.
Reading about this event and how all the fighters were arrested after the event was a great story.  Seeing the footage of how organizers of the event huddled to make this happen was interesting. I did though buy this for the fights, and they really let me down.",1013644800,,1468,4.752941176470588
