Stop reading and go pick this up...unless you already have it, in which case--here's what I did to make the subtitles go away: chooses French (or Spanish) subtitles, turn them on, now turn them off. This should do it. Occasionally the subtitles would pop up again and I would simply repeat the process. Also: this doesn't seem to happen if you use a Playstation 2.",1012608000,,490,4.776470588235294

The DVD's have totally flawed menus.
The production of the movie itself is awesome, but the schmuck that designed the menu wrappers should be unemeployed. It makes the DVD set unuseable.

No one who owns a Dvd player should be without this series. No matter what race you are you should be able to identify with something that is going on in this series, because it is our nations history even if we like it or not. Just by seeing the struggle taken place in this movie, I believe that I'm a better person. The dvd's quality is great. Considering when this was made, the quality is astounding. I just can't say enough about this dvd. And for this price why shouldn't you buy it. I mean it's almost 10 hours of dvd, for the less than the price of two average dvds.

1651055,4,B00005QW6Y,"I had been anxiously waiting for the DVD release of this wonderful Television Miniseries since I started collecting DVDs.
Well, it finally happened and looked forward to seeing once again after 25 years one of the top made for television films made.
As I started to watch Disc 1, I noticed that the English subtitles would randomly appear and disappear as the movie progressed.  Needless to say, this put a dent on my viewing so I decided to restart the movie again, as I could NOT get rid of the subtitles, either through the remote control or DVD ""set-up""  menu settings.  I repeated this several times but the subtitles kept popping up.  At this point my desire to keep watching rapidly declined. I tried it on another player, and yes, same problem, with the subtitles appearing and disappearing at the same points on both machines.  I own over 100 DVDs and had never seen this problem before, so I decided to exchange it for another one.
Well, guess what? Same exact problem with the replacement disc! I don't know the technical reason why it happens, and I know it's not the players' problem, so at this point I will be returning the DVD for a refund as this is obviously a pressing problem. Warner Video needs to look into it, and rectify the situation.
Other than that, I look forward to one day actually watching ""Roots"" in it's entirety, at which time I will be happy to let you know my overall opinion of the DVD.",1012348800,26,1423,4.54296875
1651056,5,B00005QW6Y,"OK, the DVD is great, nice extras, and Roots is one of my all-time favorite pieces of television. But for some reason, the DVDs turn the subtitles on automatically! I saw at least one person below is having the same problem.
It's madness! Even when you turn them off from the DVD's menu, THEN turn them off AGAIN from your DVD player's subtitle function, they STILL return.
AAAAHHHHHRRRGGGHHHH!!!!!!!!!!
BWWAAAAHHHH!!!!!!!!
This is a major distraction. I have a Toshiba SD-1600, which is a pretty decent little DVD player. I've never had any problem like this before.
If anybody has a solution (short of putting electrical tape over the bottom third of my TV screen) I'd love to hear it. Otherwise, Roots is goin' back.",1012176000,10,719,4.853658536585366

The digital mastering used to re-create (let's be honest after 25 years) has been a pretty good job and even though the sound is in mono this is a small price to pay. One issue I do have though is that the subtitles appear to come and go even when I try to turn them off permanently.
Any one out there who can help ??

1651137,5,B00005QW6Y,"PERFECT and very nicely (gently) but accurately done - they didn't hold back and to their credit, the white actors did a great job communicating the deadliness of the people in control of slavery.

If you don't have that community, that inheritance, this series is essential to understanding evil.  Every effort to be naive and trusting is addressed in this series.  If you watch Roots, you may see an echo in how Michael Jackson interacted with royalty.

ROOTS needs to be shown to uninitiated Mainland Chinese who are taking orders from American furniture companies for sofas in ""N-word Brown"" and sold ""Darlie"" toothpaste to this day just as Il Volo should be introduced to China because they don't know about the mafia stereotype of Italians - they should go from Matteo Ricci and Marco Polo to Il Volo - not The Sopranos.

There's something very gay rape about taking Black men and stripping them, tying them up and whipping them up - it's invasive, it's INTIMATE in both directions of perpetrators and victims.  Maybe we need some gay intellectuals to profile this type of behavior.

I personally don't want to physically touch a Japanese gangster or triad collaborator - I'd just hand them over to the cops- I mean yuck who would want to get near that.

I accept certain things about how the Unequal Treaties work, why the Cantonese have a chip on their shoulders and how involved and devious and long-term the Japanese espionage and surveillance went generations before the official beginnings of the Sino-Japanese wars so this comes as no surprise:

""He admitted to ordering the use of ""about 47,000"" Chinese people as laborers while serving as governor of Andong Province after June 1939. Some of them ""got sick or died due to bad living conditions.""

From 1939 to 1941, Kibe introduced to Mishan, Linkou, Hulin and Baoqing counties 14 ""pioneer immigration teams,"" 650 Japanese households who took Chinese people's land by force.

According to his confession, he also gave orders for 15,000 Chinese to be forced to build roads for use by the Japanese army from September 1942 to the end of March 1944.

In April 1943, he ordered the expropriation of 10 hectares of private land to construct a Japanese military airport in Yanji County, affecting three families, a total of 15 people.

From 1942 to 1943, he conscripted 12,000 Chinese people.

Kibe also wrote that he sold large amounts of opium to Chinese people in Manchukuo.

This is the latest in a series of 45 Japanese war criminal confessions the SAA plans to publish. The SAA has been issuing one a day since July 3.

The move follows denials of war crimes in China by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and right-wing politicians.""",1406592000,,2699,4.847494553376906

The show goes on to tell the stories of Kuntas's daughter, Kizzy, grandson, Chicken George, and great-grandson, Tom Harvey, as they courageously struggled to survive the brutalties of slavery in the American South.

The acting is outstanding and the characters are truly inspirational. It can sometimes veer in melodrama, as way typical of other TV miniseries at this time. But I was impressed by just how high quality this series was in most aspects. For example, the historical settings were suprisingly accurate. Also I thought it was extremely fair minded and realistic in it's portrayal of the various characters, both black and white. But never in a way that comprised the show's artistic vision of depicting American history from the perspective of a black family.

For Blacks it was like reliving their history.  For Whites it was a serious enlightenment (and in some cases a rude awakening).  It managed to open the door for dialogue between the races, and inspired a whole nation to get involved with genealogy too.  Most importantly, it inspired most of this nation to say ""never again.""  I have to agree with D. Hammork though in that I'm shocked and appalled at Amazon for leaving LeVar Burton and John Amos (who both played the MAIN character)off of their list of people who STARRED in this movie!

This is a monumental movie. A movie that broke records and received many, many awards. More importantly is how this movie put to rest so many untruths and truths of slavery. The reason I'm writing this review is because with all that this movie means to me and other African American people, I'm really disturbed that you would not list the stars of the movie correctly. I really love your company and have turned more people than I can count on to Amazon.com. Today when I searched for the DVD Roots I was really upset when I read who Amazon listed as Starring, Asner and Bridges. Levar Burton & John Amos are the stars of this movie.

1651279,3,B00005QW6Y,"This film is important, as it was the first mainstream attempt to educate America about the horrors of the African Holocaust. My ancestors were brought to America against their will, but I don't call myself an African-American, but an African-IN-America, and I will do so until I get my reparations and restitution.

""Roots"" is a bit watered down. It wanted to instill pride in Africans here, but also wake up the conscience of white Americans, without making them TOO upset, so of course there are plenty of ""good"" whites, like Mike Brady and Ed Asner. And Africans like Louis Gossett Jr. are more accepting of the slave system. Now I know this was true, but I just wish the show would have more of the Nat Turner anger, as that was another facet of the slave experience which is only alluded to here.

The actors are mostly outstanding. Lavar Burton perfectly captures the confusion, rage and innocence our magnificent warrior ancestors must have felt during the long middle passage. I was pleased to see our High Priestess, Dr. Maya Angelou, in a cameo back in Africa. She is the soul and heartbeat of our people!",1124323200,3,1116,4.717948717948718
1651280,5,B00005QW6Y,"Okay, if you're at this site you know the story. So on with the DVD itself.

Overall, the DVD is fairly accurate in dealing with slavery and African issues (it might help to clarify that while many Africans were Muslims before the transatlantic slave trade, most were still into African religions and it's important to mention HOW htey became Muslims). But in either case, it's good for a basic understanding of these concepts and the effect of salvery on Blacks and Whites.

When this came out during my Middle School years in 1977, knuckle-headed bullies (regardless of race) caused riots and fights that rocked integrated schools in much of the country over what they saw in ROOTS. This did not have to be and today, I think this shows why children need to be taught about this history in school before they react in that fashion unecessarily, as it misses the point.

On the positive side, the series DID encourage people to actually LEARN about history and STUDY their own familiy histories. It also opened up communication between young people and their elders. Such people ""got the point"" of ROOTS.

A lot of interesting scenes in the book (such as Kunta's reaction to his wife and daughter's Baptism) didn't make the film. But that's okay, as the book is easily available and the film is so well-paced that it keeps you in suspense and wanting to know what happens next.

1651281,5,B00005QW6Y,"I am surprised this series hasn't been reaired on ABC or anyplace else for a long time. This is a classic series detailing the slavery trade in the US, through almost 200 yrs of history up the Civil War (Roots the Next Generation).

An all stars cast from Levar Burton, to Maya Angelou, Ed Asner, Louis Gosset Jr. as the slave driven fiddler to Sandy Duncan and the late Vic Murrow wow!!!

The story well basically details again the disgusting slave trade which was going around in the world but specifically in the USA, yes we face it, we have a long history to both be proud and be ashamed of.

The story stars with our hero of sorts Kunta Kinte, Levar Burton being kidnapped from his home in Africa and being shipped out to be another slave. Ed Asner is remarkable as the
religious captain of a slave ship whose conscious eats him alive for commiting such an evil sin.

Even Kunta gets a slave name and tries to revolt fighting such politically incorrent blacks like Fiddler only
to realize the situation is hopeless and to top it he learns a love of his is raped by a piece of white trash named Tom Moore. Eventually after Kunta's story comes the next generation of Roots taking place around the Civil War, blacks are free in the North but the same old story continues in the south ,although now blacks are now beginnging to fight back.

The DVD's are great, Levar Burton provides visual commentary on the episodes. Louis Gosset Jr., and David L Wolper the creative executive who brought Roots to life all reminiscent about the special significance of the series.

1651294,4,B00005QW6Y,"Roots is a very good movie. The first part of the movie depicting Kunta Kinte's childhood and his ""manhood training"" can be a little slow, but the story picks up after he is sold into slavery and bought by a white plantation owner. The story is fascinating as you watch Kunta become Toby Reynolds, fall in love with Bell and watch their daughter Kizzy grow up, when finally Kizzy is sold to Tom Moore and threw this has son George. One then gets the opportunity to get to watch George grow up to be ""Chicken"" George Moore and raise his own family with his wife Matilda or Tilde. Then one gets to see George and Tilde's son Tom Harvey grow up and become free. The last part of the movie is both happy and sad because while the Moore-Harvey family is free they have to deal with the beginnings of the KKK. Their white friend George Johnson helps the family and they eventually move to Tennessee.",1095811200,5,893,4.385542168674699
1651295,4,B00005QW6Y,"I watched this again, after remembering it so vivedly from TV the first time around. In some ways it holds up, and in some ways it doesn't. It is not the best directed or shot film, and it really exposes itself as a TV Movie in this regard. There is no visual style. The acting for the most part is also TV quality. Leslie Uggams is dreadful as the young Kizzy. But, in fairness, there are excellent performances from John Amos and Ben Vereen.

As far as content goes, it is a bit strange, being this much older and knowing really what happened during those years. If you look at it abstractly - i.e. with no other knowledge of the time and conditions - then slavery doesn't look too bad, and they appear to be better off during slave times than after freedom! We HEAR about some bad things, but rarely do they happen to the central characters. They are all clean and well fed. In reality, slaves were sometimes worked to death, and violence was rampant, both from the owners and amongst the slaves. You don't get that feeling here. The danger and conditions are not really well represented. A new shooting of this would be much grittier!

Anyway, after all that, I still highly recommend it. It is educational and gives a glimpse into a history that a lot of people (especially black americans) really don't know much about. Sadly, most people's knowledge of the time will solely come from this.",1094083200,6,1396,4.513833992094861

It is virtually impossible to watch it without stirring feelings of fear, anger, sadness, and bitterness. You may even find yourself squirming in your seat at times. I also found it interesting that Ralph Waite and Robert Reed (aka Mr. Walton and Mr. Brady) who I had become accustom to seeing in kind and gentle fatherly roles portraying evil and cruel men in Roots. This in itself took a little getting used to but was nice to see both of these talented actors demonstrate their wide range of acting abilities. This movie had such an effect on me that I had to fast forward through a few of the scenes that demonstrated just how cruel masters and overseers could be when punishing or even ""motivating"" their slaves. I for the life of me can never and will NEVER understand how one human being could demonstrate such cruelty to another human being, even if they were a slave. I would never think of treating an animal or even an insect the way many of the slaves were treated in Roots. And the kicker is many of these slave owners and ship captains considered themselves to be Christian, God-fearing men. I suppose they slept through the part of the sermon that said ""love thy neighbor"" and ""treat others as you'd like to be treated"", etc. It's even sadder to think that many of these attitudes still exist today in the form of racism.

Winner of 9 Emmy Awards, the George Foster Peabody Award, the Television Critics Circle Awards and the Golden Globe Award.  This was a mini-series which Ameica watched and it change us forever.
Alex Haley spent 12 years retracing and recreating his family tree.  ""ROOTS"" was the result of this research and it tells an incredible story of one mans family and American slavery.
This story is a must viewing!!  A very enlightening story of slavery and America.
Warner Brothers did a great job transferring this classic  series to DVD.

Well.....now I'm 40,  a musician (choral conductor and educator) and a profound lover of Spirituals and Gospel music.  So....let me tell you  that  ""Roots"" moved the very bottom of my heart.  I cried every episode, deeply touched by the sadness of the story but also by the invincible courage that has led African Americans through a hard history in the U.S. From my knowledge of Spirituals I've always admired this  courage, this strength of the spirit reflected throughout all the  melodic and rhythmic richness, ( ""Hush...hush...  Somebody's calling my name"")  the spiritual and physical beauty of a race,  the  deep and sincere approach to Christianity!
I think and I do hope that, someday, those ""in power"" all around the world will open their eyes and finally come to understand that racism, and all forms of discrimination, belong to the darkest and the most ignorant side of the human heart!

I thought it looked great for a 70's TV show. The sound was servicable, which all you can expect from something this old. They also did a good job with the commentary, which covered all six episodes.
  The actual story was another matter. There were some great performances (especially by Louis Gossett Jr. as Fiddler), but there were a few I could have done without, like Sandy Duncan and whoever played that poor white guy starting with episode five. They featured too many unbelievable coincidences, which means lazy writing to me. The show also looked claustrophobic after episode one , no doubt because of budget constraints. (That  snow in episode two looked like the result of an overflowing washing machine.)It looked like they were in one spot for the remaining five episodes. As far as a story about slavery, it hit the high points but didn't go into much depth. (I guess that shouldn't be a complaint; this wasn't on the History channel.)

It's no wonder this show was the most watched in history. I have to say I'm not American, therefore the history itself isn't my history. Still, I felt totally touched by the series, and had to make an effort after each episode not to watch the next inmediately and go to bed. In my opinion, this is not a story for blacks, or Americans. This is a great story -whether you want to watch is as history or fiction, if makes you feel better somehow- that everyone will enjoy.
Anyway, most likely you already know what roots it's about. If you don't, well, it's the story of seven generations of a black family, from the capture in Africa of a free black (Kunta Kinte) to become a slave, to the writer of the book (Alex Haley) himself.
Actually note that the DVDs tell the story from Kunta Kinte until the generation where they become free, then explains in the final minutes happened to the rest. The story is told complete in Roots: The Next Generations, which isn't available on DVD yet.
I will comment on the DVD now. The box comes with three double sided DVDs (which I don't like, because I think they are more prone to be damaged). Total running time is 573 minutes. Region is 1. The primary track (English) is closed captioned, and there are subtitles in English, Spanish and French. Note that the additional commentary is not subtitled, so if you are impaired you will miss it.
Sound is in mono both in the English and the Spanish tracks (dolby digital, though) and is very decent.
Video is 4:3, and it's quite clean. It's interlaced (if you care about this because you use your PC to watch DVDs).
As for the box itself, it's convinient and doesn't take a lot of shelf space, which I appreciate very much.

It is powerful enough to make  anyone take stock and examine their own values and realise that all of us have the same hopes, ambitions,  loves, tragedies and  the right to freedom - regardless of race or colour.
The DVD version is superb.  A stunning re-mastered digital transfer with a colourful, vibrant high definition picture with a visual quality equal to film.  Whilst the sound track is mono, it is crisp and resounding and excellently reproduced.  In fact this is one of a very few DVDs to be reinforced by a mono track which adds to the stark brutality of the depiction of yet another chapter of man`s intolerance to his fellow men.
Maybe if Roots was part of the educational curriculum it would help eliminate the ignorance that has prevailed for over 200 years.

When it originally broadcast I was in grade school at the time, so now a days there are a lot of ""new"" things to absorb. It was also a great tool in explaining this aspect of history to my children. The commentary added by John Amos and other cast and crew was also a plus.
Technically speaking:
Phenominal picture quality.
This was the first dvd I purchased, as a matter of fact, I purchased a player specifically to watch this during Black History Month.  I first puchased a Zenith( the one with the 5 disc carousel). After a while the dvd would stutter consistently and experince other problems. Being a newbie, I couldn't tell if it was the player or the dvd itself. I then rented a flick, (""something"" Valentine, with Samuel Jackson) and experienced a totaly different problem.  I then took both dvds to a friends house and they played flawlessly. I eventually exchanged my dvd for a panasonic DVD player and had no problems whatsoever with the Roots dvd. (Panasonic has dual lasers and better error correction) . Needless to say, my point here is that i did not experience the subtitle problem on the Zenith  5 carousel, with the Panasonic RV32 or my freinds Toshiba unit, as did some of the other reviewers. I must admit I did not play it on the Toshiba for more than 15 minutes total time. Perhaps it is an issue specific to their model or take it up with WB directly for technical assistance. If hesitant, I would rent it, see how it plays, then by it for your collection. It is a must have!",1014508800,4,1595,4.455479452054795
1651323,5,B00005QW6Y,"I am delighted that Roots has actually grown in its poignancy for me with life experience.  I cared deeply about the characters as a young man 25 years ago, but they are even more empathetic now.  I was afraid the show would appear melodramatic in retrospect, but not so. The producers were courageous in their rendering, and not not at all patronizing.  The performances all are skillful, and the depth of emotion backing them is palpable, and appropriate for the heft and significance of its subject. Lou Gosset as Fiddler is particularly riveting. When he shows Kunte how to assume a mask for survival, we all weep and mourn for his loss of human dignity, pride. In the ""looking back"" show aired recently, I was amazed to learn that over 120 Million saw the show in 1977. Soon after the height of the civil rights movement, Roots filled in a lot of blanks for the nation at large, gave a human face to our nation's original sin, and, I'd like to think, helping us to move beyond our darkest days, and perhaps a step closer toward reconciliation and unity.  This DVD is for the permanent collection, repeated viewing and sharing with grandchildren. It gets five stars without question.
THERE IS, HOWEVER, ONE TECHNICAL DRAWBACK: When I play the DVD, english subtitles appear unpredictably and intermittently on the TV screen. No other DVDs do this on my player. Since I returned the same DVD from another retailer for the same reason, it appears to be a manufacturing flaw.  Unfortunately, solving this problem will most likely require more that a simple exchange.",1013299200,12,1566,4.785185185185185
