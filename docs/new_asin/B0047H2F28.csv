4285173,4,B0047H2F28,"This was a pretty good documentry about Star Wars fans. It was a little heavy on the light saber duels, but still intertaining. It was nice to see Carrie Fisher, Peter Mayhew, and Ray Parks in the show.

The only thing I didn't like was that I can not copy it to a flash drive or to my laptop. You have to watch it from Amazon or register your tv or Blu ray player. It's my fault I should have read all the info before buying it.",1328832000,,429,3.9310344827586206
4285174,2,B0047H2F28,"It takes great skill to make an interesting documentary, and it's clear that these folks did not have said skill.  It's boring, drones on, and seems to fixated on women dressed as Slave Leia.  Even the most die hard Star Wars fans will find this documentary to be a waste of time.",1289779200,2,280,4.365384615384615
4285175,5,B0047H2F28,"I loved this movie. It's a very funny and very sexy look at extreme Star Wars fans.

The film covers an entire gambit of Star Wars fans including a guy who built a life size Millenium Falcon in his backyard. (There's a good story behind why he did and what happened to the space ship.) Film also shows this group called the NY Jedi - who are light saber experts. Also shown are toy collectors and people who make Star Wars fan films.

And if you're interested in women who dress up like Princess Leia in her metal bikini - aka ""Slave Leia"" you will not be disapointed.

A few actors from the Star Wars films are interviewed. That includes Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Ray Park (Darth Maul) and Jeremy Bulloch (Boba Fett).

Also interviewed is Olivia Munn from Attack of the Show.

I'm glad that this film doesn't make fun of Star Wars fans. Yes, it shows that some fans might take it too far....(one guy doesn't have a bed because he bought to many toys.) But the film really celebrates the fans.

In short... Very funny. Very sexy. Very entertaining.",1274832000,31,1048,4.460732984293194

4285180,5,B0047H2F28,"I have been a STAR WARS fan since I was 11 years old in the summer of 1977. And sometimes you just want to watch a documentary about others who are fans of science fantasy and science fiction be they middle aged like me or still in single digits. Docs like JEDI JUNKIES allow you to look on others in fandom who have been in many ways inspired by Mr. Lucas' creations and have manifested that interest in a variety of creative methods. Some collect action figures, vehicles, and lightsabers. Others build their own props and costumes. A few with deeper pockets might make their own productions and enter the contest at San Diego Comic Con for best STAR WARS Fan Film. There is no right or wrong way. There is just enjoying a popular art that has inspired you in some way.",1387152000,2,771,4.398601398601398

4285182,5,B0047H2F28,i love star wars. i just recently order everything to be a jedi for halloween. i love this documentary because it shows that im not the only one thats crazy and collective of everything star wars.,1381449600,2,196,4.472222222222222
4285183,2,B0047H2F28,"As an inveterate but perhaps fading Star Wars fan I picked up this movie because...it was cheap and looked amusing.  It follows a number of stories, including a fellow who made a life-size Millenium Falcon in his back yard, the NY Jedi folks who do lightsaber combat as a form of choreographed martial arts, the ""Slave Leia"" phenomenon dramatized on the disc cover, and a fellow who creates custom Star Wars figures.  Along the way we're treated to interviews from the prominently credited Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Ray Park (Darth Maul), and Olivia Munn, along with Jeremy Bulloch (Boba Fett).

This all sounds good on paper, but it's less than the sum of its parts.  The interviews with everyone but Olivia Munn were done with the various interviewees at their signing tables at cons, and although all are interesting, there's not a lot of interview content in the film.  The various pieces of the film are just that - there's no story arc, just a number of documentary short subject pieces welded together.  I'm a bit bewildered at the praise for the Slave Leia segment; there's a lot of eye candy, but the interviews with the women who participated in this segment - particularly with one given a lot of screen time - are robotic and content-free.  An investigation of the cultural phenomenon and how it represents both a repudiation and a embrace of certain gender roles prevalent in the world would be interesting.  This is not that.

So yeah...it just didn't work for me, even though I wanted to love it.  I didn't expect an Oscar contender, but I expected a somewhat better put-together film.",1375660800,12,1600,4.785454545454545
4285184,3,B0047H2F28,Being that it is rather old... can't blame that it is not DVD clear. More of a VHS quality recorded to a DVD. Really meant for true Star Wars fans only.,1371081600,2,152,3.935483870967742

4285186,1,B0047H2F28,I am a huge Star Wars fan and have seen a lot of Star Wars documentaries and this has to be the worst. Don't be fooled by the Slave Leia on the front of the box. This is very bad and very boring. Don't waste your money!,1362268800,4,219,3.6808510638297873
4285192,4,B0047H2F28,"I see that there are already 15 reviews of this film posted before me - nearly all from the Amazon Instant streaming version. This review is of the physical DVD released by New Video.

I'll start off by saying that I'm not a Star Wars ""groupie"" - In fact I remember seeing the original film and maybe , I'm not even sure , the first sequel. But I do like pop culture documentaries and I am a collector of other ""collectibles"" - my case Edison memorabilia - so I know how a collection can take over your house and home. (And no, at least not to my knowledge are there conventions where members dress up like Thomas Edison - though I hear Mr. Peanut collectors do. _

While not a great film, I did enjoy watching much of this DVD. The section on making one of the ""fan films"" just seemed to drag a bit. There are no real ""celebrities"" to speak of - at least from the first SW film, except the guy who played Chewbacca being interviewed at a fan fair. Three things peaked my interest - though there may be others that will peak yours. First was Roberto Williams, a well spoken ""collector and customizer"". He explains the various stages that SW toys were released and speaks rationally as to why he bought multiple copies of certain toy models as investments.  The next was the collector who explained how collection can be an obsession and take over your life and household. There is a female ""psychologist who explains how this can a be a problem.) This section is relevant to ANY collectible and any collector will relate to that. The third was the section on the You Tube ""seriel"" ""Chad Vader"" about Darth Vader's younger brother (Chad) being a grocery store manager. As the creators of this internet phenom explain, it has virtually nothing to do with the Star War series - just the Vader character and it is quite clever.

The DVD contains a bunch of bonuses that may appeal to those who loved the Instant Video version. First is the full length commentary by the filmmaker. Then there are  the deleted scenes and short featurette which total about 17 minutes.
This is not a classic film but it was fun to watch and certainly is something Jedi Junkie will want to see. (The director never takes sides as to whether this obsession is healthy or not.)

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

4285193,3,B0047H2F28,"This film tries to capture the life of a Jedi Junky in non high definition format.  Although, it does have some interesting junky stories.  You won't see any hard luck cases or people who have hit rock bottom with their Star Wars fantasy life.  I want to see Star Wars fans who are living on the street with their shopping cart full of Star Wars collectables, and then painfully selling each item to buy batteries for their broken light saber.  Now that's the true harsh fan life I want to see.  No one has ever heard of a Star Trek junky; Trekkers are people you can respect.",1360281600,,576,4.345794392523365

4285195,2,B0047H2F28,"Jedi Junkies explores the obsession with the Star Wars franchise. I'm not a Star Wars fan, but I figured I would like this movie since I liked the Comic-Con documentary...and I'm not a fan of superheros or sci-fi. I was a little disappointed. I feel there was a lot of filler with ""fan film"" footage, but less substance. I would have liked to have seen more interviews with the ""junkies"" themselves.",1353801600,,399,4.633802816901408

4285199,2,B0047H2F28,"Very boring. Go back and watch ""George Lucas versus the People"" if you want a good documentary.

The rest is an endless barrage of people showing their star wars toy collection and their fan films.",1344038400,,307,4.310344827586207
4285200,5,B0047H2F28,"""Jedi Junkies"" is an extraordinary film.  It's smart, knowing, lively, sympathetic, and besides being great fun it's an eye-opening introduction to some far-out super-dedicated Star War fans. I've watched it a couple of times with fascination and admiration. Though it's likely to be most appreciated by people (unlike me) who are seriously into the Star Wars saga, it's really a film for everyone who is curious about extraordinarily passionate people, even if some of them sometimes seem to be over the edge.  Mark Edlitz is, I believe, a singularly talented and imaginative filmmaker: he's an artist who deeply understands, admires, and in his smart and entertaining film celebrates passionate people.",1337385600,8,704,5.390909090909091

8418124,3,B0047H2F28,A poor quality documentary about Star Wars super fans.  It looked like this was poorly converted from VHS format to DVD format.
