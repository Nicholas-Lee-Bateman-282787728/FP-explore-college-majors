8239281,5,B0010XTGUQ,"It's perfect!  Our baby (1 year old) loves it and so do we.  We have a couple of other learning-Chinese DVDs, but none of those hold his attention like Baby Learns Chinese.  He loves watching this DVD from beginning to end.  We love how it uses common children's songs that he already enjoys in English, so that they readily grab his attention and he makes the connection between the two languages. The DVD is helping mom learn Chinese too!",1200614400,16,440,4.531645569620253
