8698685,5,B00SJWY7AU,Excellent movie...thank you for making it possible for me to see it.,1486080000,,68,4.75
8698686,2,B00SJWY7AU,It does not have subtitles.. can we do something about it?,1481673600,,58,4.363636363636363
8698687,1,B00SJWY7AU,"I've been an uneasy fan of Pasolilni's movies forever (was unsettled by ""Teorema"", adore his ""Trilogy of Life"", wish I could eradicate the memory of having seen ""Salo"") and thought this well-reviewed flick might give me some insights into the strange mind behind them.  Well, I guess it did that, sort of, but to my surprise I just didn't care.  Willem Dafoe, as Pasolini, talks and talks about his philosophy of life, which turns out to be of little interest to me.  I'm not sure how the thoughts presented here gave rise to the films he made, but I don't think I'd pursue the matter any further.",1476316800,,597,4.5607476635514015
8698688,4,B00SJWY7AU,"Four stars for quality of video and audio. Unfortunately the audio is Italian-only and the only subtitles are also Italian. No English at all. Picture looked great, audio sounded fine, so I'm giving it four stars for what I can judge.",1449273600,,234,4.7317073170731705
