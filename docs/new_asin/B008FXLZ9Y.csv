5158745,4,B008FXLZ9Y,I am an Agatha Christie fan and have as many films as possible. This has been done in a different way but in a fashion they kept to the story. I cant wait until further DVD's from France are made available with English Sub-titles.,1396396800,2,230,4.25
5158746,5,B008FXLZ9Y,"I was at first taken aback because these were definitely not the usual reserved British characters with which Agatha Christie populated her stories, but the plots still work. In fact, being transposed to different settings with totally different characters shows how skillful Agatha Christie was in creating her magnificent plots. The execution of the plots, the acting and production values are all outstanding. But be warned, these are very French characters with very French attitudes. I don't think Dame Agatha would have ever even implied that Poirot visited a brothel about once a month (as was a plot point in one of the later episodes). Nevertheless, I say ""Bravo"" to a job well done and do recommend it.",1396310400,6,712,5.0423728813559325
5158747,5,B008FXLZ9Y,"I love this set! The sub titles are great and it is easy to refresh and pick up new vocabulary while watching. The stories were great, intriguing, funny and entertaining. I highly recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind reading while watching. I plan to share with family and friends.",1394409600,5,286,4.74
5158748,2,B008FXLZ9Y,For those who enjoy Gallic comedy - I'm not one of them - these shows may be entertaining.  But they are by no means Agatha Christie.,1394409600,6,133,4.115384615384615
5158749,1,B008FXLZ9Y,"Extremely disappointed.  I found the stories disjointed and even silly. Also, some gratuitous scenes of homosexuality in the very first episode here (The ABC Murders) were quite unnecessary to the plot. What possible motive did they have for including this?

Save your money for more authentic Agatha Christie films.",1393977600,10,316,5.428571428571429
5158750,5,B008FXLZ9Y,"I love Agatha Christies novels and short stories, and as a fan I am always interested in adaptations and productions of her work.  Acorn Media brings us from France Les Petit Meurthers DAgatha Christie, a series of little mysteries set in the 1930s and in the 1950s.  In the 1930s,  Superintendent Larosiere and Inspector Lampion take on the solving of crimes, while in the 1950s it is the debonair Commissioner Laurence who must find the solutions, assisted by a young reporter Alice.  This ""take"" on Christie is different from what has gone before, but nevertheless interesting as re-imaginings or reworkings of the familiar tales.  Beautifully and carefully filmed and acted, and with English subtitles in case one does not want to practice his or her French language skills, these stories belong in the collection of fans of both Christie and good television dramas.",1392076800,7,870,5.055944055944056
5158751,4,B008FXLZ9Y,"Set 1 of ""The Little Murders of Agatha Christie"" is strong plot-driven stories. After all, they originated from the queen of crime investigation. The French have taken some personal characteristic liberties with the 2 lead characters. Would `Aggie' approve? It sure gives a new twist of viewing for Agatha Christie, Poirot, and Miss Marple fans. Like taste testing ""escargot (snails)"" for the first time. Set 1 is contemporary productions (2009-12) with an interesting look at Christie's 1930s crimes through French period costumes, props, cars, interiors, and country vistas. C'est la vie.

Episodes 1-6 are Poirot-like, even though 2 of the adaptations were Marple. Supt Larosiere is no David Suchet, but performs the French investigator role well. He can be verbally abusive. Occasionally he has a mannerism that appears he's taken instruction from Suchet. His assistant, Insp. Lampion, a sleuth buffoon who's dialogue states: ""I don't fancy girls."" A male cop investigates in the last episode, a story adapted by the British three times with three different leads playing Miss Marple. He gets antagonistically assisted by a forceful girl newspaper columnist.

ENGLISH TRANSLATION TEXT SUBTITLES; French audio only.
Below the French episode titles are replaced with the adapted novel title:
---1---The ABC Murders---An ABC bus timetable is a clue to a serial murderer who's savage killings get increasingly elaborate. He taunts Supt. Larosiere, the greatest French cop, by sending him ABC-signed letters announcing the next attack. Larosiere & Lampion fail to stop the violence.
---2---Ordeal by Innocence---In 1934 Supt Larosiere deals with an adopted son who killed the philanthropist adoption mother. After 2 years the case is reopened to the dismay of the wealthy family survivors.
---3---Peril at End House---Larosiere tries to keep a foxy seaside vacationing designer alive. Will he find love in the meantime? At what cost?
---4---Cat Among the Pigeons---The Supt. & Insp. Must be discrete while looking for a killer inside a posh girls' school. Regardless, some surprises and secrets get unveiled amid bloody attacks.
---5---Sad Cypress---Strangely, Insp. Lampion is on the job (undercover) at a feminist cause retreat. Threats against the rich hostess gets Lampion in an awkward (but pretty) sleuth attire. A good LOL comedy/mystery.
---6---The Body in the Library---It is Lampion's turn to lead the investigation since his boss is the prime suspect in the murder of a teenage lady-of-le-evening, found dead in Larosiere's bed. See guest star Vernon Dobtcheff, from both French and British films.
---7---They Do It with Mirrors---A brutal murder at la centre for the mental handicapped with 17 patients (suspects). C.I. Laurence is the new commissioner who gets unwelcome help from a news reporter. Murder multiplies. Marple as a man--it works.

Negatives: I missed seeing lots of visual due to text reading requirement. Not a problem for anyone who speaks French. French speak faster than I can read; solved by repeated use of the remote pause. Actors are good, but not as great as those in the British adaptations. Yet for Agatha Christie addicts, this set is a fun comparison.

5158781,2,B008FXLZ9Y,"It's quite painful to read the positive reviews for this set. One states it's the best filmed rendition of Agatha Christie's work yet! Others talk about the delightful ""Francophile"" adaptations of the Mistress of Mystery's novels. All I can ask myself, is ""Why? Why? WHY???""

The creators of this series have taken great care to get period details correct. The episodes look beautiful. They have replaced Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple with a French police team, one set in the 1930's (Superintendent Larosiere and his  assistant Inspector Lampion), and the other in the 1950's (Commissioner Laurence and a really tiresome female reporter whose name escapes me). I even found Inspector Lampion a charming character, saddled with the buffoon-like Larosiere. I have to wonder if perhaps the authors of this series simply did not have the imagination to create original plots and therefore sought out great mysteries to turn their insidious scalpel on. Yes, I'm mixing metaphors, but, as a lifelong reader and admirer of Dame Agatha Christie I am justifiably upset at the people who essentially lampooned her work for television and at her estate, which must have gotten a pretty penny in exchange for the rights to these tales.

For those of you who love Christie and are unsure as to whether you should or shouldn't give these versions a try, I will elucidate for you the basic differences between each episode. Then I'll leave it to you to decide. (Maybe one of you will offer to buy my copy since I do not intend to watch these again. I won't SPOIL everything, but if you really want to watch this series then DON'T READ BELOW since comparisons WILL SPOIL PLOT ELEMENTS!

Les Meurtres ABC (The ABC Murders): This starts out as a fairly faithful adaptation in that there is a series of murders based on the alphabet, and a copy of a railway timetable is found by each body. Since Superintendent Larosiere is an official policeman, unlike Poirot, his relationship to the suspects must be different. The murders are more gruesome, and the bulk of the story centers on Larosiere's competition with another detective to solve the case. The solution to the crime is completely different from the novel. (FRENCH SEX QUOTIENT: Lampion gets to have sex with his boss' competitor.)

Am stram gram (Ordeal by Innocence): This might be the most faithful adaptation, although it puts odd new twists into the story. At least it is less burdened with the tiresome comic interactions between Larosiere and Lampion. (FRENCH SEX QUOTIENT: Lampion falls in love with one of the young male suspects, who very kindly rebuffs him and tells him to live openly and be happy.)

La Maison du peril (Peril at End House): A garbled version of the original, with some very odd new character added in. The ending is sort of the same as the original, although the murderer is looked upon with more sympathy for no good reason. (FRENCH SEX QUOTIENT: Larosiere falls madly in love with the Nick Buckley character, and she returns his affections. Lampion gets hit on by an elderly suspect.)

Le chat et les souris (Cat Among the Pigeons): Well, both versions take place at a girls' school. And there is a tennis racket in there. I think about half the solution sort of resembles Christie's, but it's a complete mess otherwise. (FRENCH SEX QUOTIENT: Surprisingly little considering that Larosiere is surrounded by women.)

Je ne suis pas coupable (Sad Cypress): Something to do with a feminist retreat and Lampion disguised in drag as a champion of women's rights. Somewhere in there is the original story, however, complete with the original solution. (FRENCH SEX QUOTIENT: Larosiere and Lampion pretend to be married. Many laughs ensue.....)

Un cadavre sur l'oreiller (The Body in the Library): The library is now a whorehouse, and all the upper class suspects are hookers. Larosiere is suspected of the murder since the body (once found in a British library in St. Mary Mead) is now found in his bed. Somehow it reaches the same ending as the novel, but this time you feel like you have to shower. (FRENCH SEX QUOTIENT: Hey, it's a bordello, so everyone gets lucky! Larosiere has a favorite hooker named Esmeralda, and Lampion has a sweet, doomed romance with the piano player, Raymond.)

Jeux de glaces (They Do It With Mirrors): This is the only episode in this set from the second season, set in the 1950's and featuring Commissioner Laurence. Although many characters are cut or combined, and far too much time is taken establishing the bickering relationship between Laurence and the previously mentioned obnoxious female reporter, the plot at first seems to be very much like the original. Then everything goes flooey! The wrong people die, and the wrong people turn out to be guilty, and the whole thing becomes a travesty unworthy of Miss Marple. (FRENCH SEX QUOTIENT: The character most like Gina from the novel flirts and sleeps with perhaps everybody, including Larosiere.)

Honestly, folks, this review is probably my chance to vent and psychologically relieve myself of some of the horror that came from watching this. There are SO many good mystery series out there, and if you are even thinking of watching this without having seen all of David Suchet's Poirot episodes or Joan Hickson's Miss Marple series, then I'm talking to the wrong people anyway.

If you love the Christie detectives then you will probably be frustrated by these versions. Personally, I am not a huge Poirot fan; in my opinion these two French detectives were funnier and more endearing. Another warning- the French have a much greater tolerance, an appetite even, for exploration of sexuality; furthermore the murders are more graphic than the British versions. Nevertheless, the period detail and the underlying comic aspect of the stories remain to the fore.

5158798,5,B008FXLZ9Y,"I was so happy to stumble upon this set of French foreign films adapted from Agatha Christie's works.  So far I've watched 3 of the 7 films and already I'm impressed.  The sets are vibrant with colors and they really capture the feel of these classic Christie works.  So far, I've watched ""The ABC Murders,"" ""Ordeal by Innocence"" and ""Peril at End House.""  Set in the 1930's, these films are a delightful homage to the original works.  Superintendent Larosiere is no Hercule Poirot, nor should he be.  Along with his bumbling, and very sweet sidekick Inspector Lampion, the pair are more a comic duo trying to solve these classic puzzlers.  Larosiere loves women and fine foods, and while he seems absurd and not very clever, we find that in the end he has a great mind and always solves the crime.  Lampion is sweet and is hiding a secret, yet I find I root for him in every film.  You have to enjoy foreign films and not mind reading subtitles, but if you're willing I think you'll find these movies quite charming.  For the most part, the films stay true to the original novels.  The changes that they do make aren't too drastic and fit in with the feel of the films.  There's a touch of The Pink Panther in them, but unlike some of the more recent film adaptations, these movies keep a light touch as opposed to exploring the darker side of things.  I hope this is only the first set, as I would love to own the other movies by this director.  So far it's been a fun ride and if you're a Christie fan, I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1398211200,19,1543,4.387323943661972

I found the next five very inventive. The plots and the murderers are mostly the same as the Christie we are used to, but the settings may change, characters are added and subtracted and the sleuths are radically different. After the first two episodes, I forgot that they were speaking French. My college French was not up to the challenge, but the English subtitles provide a welcome crutch. I often use subtitles for the English versions anyway. The actors are excellent, especially the main two, Dulery and Colucci. But all the actors are believable in their parts. The humor had me laughing at times. I didn't like the last one, but They Do It With Mirrors is probably my least favorite Christie and by the seventh episode I was used to the two regulars from the first six episodes and now I missed them. For me, the relationship between the policeman and the reporter in this last episode did not work. They really didn't seem to like each other. I will probably buy set 2, if there is one, and if they bring back Dulery and Colucci.",1396915200,18,1416,4.600790513833992
5158800,1,B008FXLZ9Y,"The good news is that the two morons who are the leads- that horny old goat Dulery and his gay bumbling assistant Colucci - won't be in Series 2.  They threw in the towel, (or somebody did) perhaps knowing how ridiculous they appear. Cause for celebration.  They both ruin what might be an interesting take on Agatha Christie's impeccable works, newly minted by capable writers who are sabotaged by them.
I can't say I really enjoy the new renditions - Christie did it much better -  but any Christie release is usually cause for celebrating.  This one isn't.  The French is very annoying and the English subtitles race by at break neck speed, almost too fast to understand.  Skip this release and go for the original adaptations by McKenzie or Suchet or others who know what to do with Christie's great works.  I sent my copy back.",1396742400,6,832,4.619047619047619

This problem makes the video series impossible to watch.

Perhaps I am an unsophisticated user, but I cannot figure out how to get a refund for this clearly defective video series download.

If anyone can chime in with a comment and / or advice on how to get a refund, I would be grateful.
