2650646,5,B000I0RNSO,"Love Gilad!  You will definitely see results in a few weeks time.  If you are not sore, than there is something wrong with you! In one month, I have noticed increased strength and endurance.  I wish he included abs but the core video is great too.",1172534400,7,247,4.326086956521739
2650647,4,B000I0RNSO,"I love Gilad, but I have to say, in this dvd, he isn't as much fun as he usually is.
Here is my list of Pros and Cons. PROS: It is a good solid workout, especially good for tricepts and bicepts. He is good at cueing the exercisise and showing correct form. I like using the bands with the leg exercises. He has a great exercise for the calves.  Cons: NO ABDOMINAL EXERCISES in this dvd. The music is almost non-existant.  If you like to work your back out (traps, lats, rear delts and rhomboids) you may find the back exercises too easy and not enough reps- I did them with both arms to make it harder. He doesn't have anyone showing modifications for absolute beginners-though the exercises are not that complicated. But overall a decent workout.",1165708800,43,747,4.445255474452555
2650648,4,B000I0RNSO,"This DVD consists of a warm-up, 39 minutes of toning for upper body and lower body and a 6 minute stretch.  In the first half of the toning you'll alternate between upper body and lower body doing squats and lunges for the legs and concentrating on the shoulders, biceps, and triceps for the upper body. Gilad and his class use an x-ertube (a resistance band with handles).  He says you can use your own body weight or dumbells but doesn't have anyone showing that modification and he really should have.

The second half of the workout is mostly upper body working shoulders, biceps ,triceps, back and chest using 2 sets of weights.  Towards the end there's a short segment working calves with upper body.  The workout ends with push-ups and chest flies.  As usual, Gilad is motivating and provides many form pointers.  My only complaint is that you can't select the resistance band and weights sections separately.  You can individually select the warm-up, entire sculpting section and the cool down.  Overall, I loved the beach setting and thought the exercises were very effective",1164067200,73,1084,4.879781420765028
2650649,4,B000I0RNSO,"I like this dvd a lot. It is aimed mainly at the upper body. The first part he uses a band and the second is weights. But I would recomend doing half of the workout at at time, my shoulders were sore for almost three weeks afer this workout. I would have liked the cool down or warm up to have more stretching of all the muscle groups.",1163894400,15,335,3.9411764705882355
2650650,5,B000I0RNSO,"What can I say, yes I am a Gilad fan since the first days on ESPN.  I am a fan however because when I buy his products, I feel I got my money's worth.  Can't say enough about his DVDs, he's wonderful.",1163116800,5,200,3.738095238095238

2650652,5,B000I0RNSO,"I have always been a big fan of Gilad's workouts, and this is no exception. It works both the upper and lower body, with more emphasis on upper body, which is what I was looking for.  The moves with the tube can be adapted to use weights if you don't have a tube, or if it feels too difficult.",1432166400,,293,3.9661016949152543

2650666,5,B000I0RNSO,I love working out with Gillad !! I started working out with him on the tv and i bought his DVDs because I don't have time to go to the gym and it's easy for me to workout at home at my Owen space,1391299200,,196,3.477272727272727

2650668,5,B000I0RNSO,I have always been a Gilad fan and have all of his workouts unfortunately on VHS which was not compatible to my tv.  I was happy to find him in a DVD format.  Will purchase more!!,1380672000,,179,3.9444444444444446
2650669,5,B000I0RNSO,Years ago Gilad had a television show on a cable network. I used to record it and do the workout after work at least four times a week. Then I could not find him anywhere. I was so happy to be able to buy a DVD with his best sculpting exercises. I usually do power walks for exercise but I live in Florida and the summers here are gruesome so I need something to keep me fit during the most brutal months of the year. I am so happy with purchase and with the quality of the DVD as well as the fast delivery that I received. I would recommend the seller to my friends and relatives.,1374451200,,581,3.9743589743589745
2650670,5,B000I0RNSO,Gilad is a favorite of years.  He is very easy to follow.  For beginners you could not ask for a better work-out instructor!,1369094400,,124,4.3478260869565215

2650672,5,B000I0RNSO,This is a good low impact workout. One of my favorites. I can do this without putting out my back and still feel like I have had a good workout. The music gets on my nerves after a while but otherwise I'm very pleased.,1363046400,,218,3.977272727272727
2650673,5,B000I0RNSO,Didn't know that this workout woould really put you to the test.  great for that core and cut . I highly recommend,1361059200,,114,4.181818181818182

2650675,4,B000I0RNSO,I'm always satisfied with what Gilad does. He is one of my favorites because its a good workout and I can see results after about a good soild week.,1356825600,,148,4.137931034482759
2650676,5,B000I0RNSO,this came on time and I must add I  have this whole series and it gets the job done. Im sore the next day.,1356048000,,106,3.4166666666666665
2650677,5,B000I0RNSO,"I own several Gilad DVDs and mix them up to keep things interesting.  As always, clear instructions, great explanation of form, etc., and he gets right to the workout.  Some of his older DVDs are from a TV show from the 1980s-1990s and have very short 'gaps' where the commercials had been but not this one.  This workout appears to have been filmed for DVD release.  Well done, beautiful scenery and a great workout.  Buy several and you won't get bored with yout workouts!",1345593600,,474,4.595238095238095
2650678,4,B000I0RNSO,This is a good workout that always makes me feel a bit sore the next day.  It focuses on the upper body with some leg exercises in the warmup and less focus on the core.  I like this DVD because it is not too hard and not too easy.  Other workout DVDs that I have bought can be really difficult and then I dread doing them and ultimately avoid using them.  Gilad's DVD's are not like that.  He exudes a positive attitude and is encouraging without being annoying like other fitness personalities.,1330646400,2,496,4.3478260869565215
2650679,5,B000I0RNSO,"I have bought my share of exercise DVDs and most of them I use once and never again. Most of them are venues for narcissistic individuals with a ""God complex"" to show off how amazing they are.  The exercises are often too advanced, too fast-paced and too little time is spent on showing how the exercise is done properly.  For the rest of us who may be older, who maybe out of shape, have shoulder or joint problems, most of these exercises are hardly achievable, which is then demotivating and discouraging.
Gilad's exercises also includes some advanced / demanding exercises for sure - which I had to work up to, but they are achievable even for those with some health issues to deal with.
The only thing that could be approved is to show some modified exercises for those with specific challenges (back problems, shoulder problems, etc.) - sometimes he shows modifications, but most of the time he doesn't.  This wasn't too much of a problem for me as I participated in guided classes in the past and am educated on them, but many others wouldn't know how to modify exercises to meet their specific needs.  That is the only thing I would like him to add - to allow everyone to benefit from his exercise programs.
Anyhow, I am a fan of his.  I love his workouts.  I used to go to classes at the YMCA, but found these to be just as effective and as I do them first thing in the morning, I am doing these exercises every day.  If I plan on exercising later on in the day, I often find excuses ... so this works for me.

2650680,3,B000I0RNSO,"This is ALL upper body work. Except for a few easy squats, this is one hour of upper body weight work. It's an excellent workout if you want defined biceps, triceps and delts, but doesn't do anything for the rest of the body.",1318118400,,225,4.255813953488372
2650681,4,B000I0RNSO,"I ordered this because I was a fan of Gilad's TV episodes.  When I decided to cut down to basic cable, the channel Gilad's show was broadcast on wasn't offered with the basic package and unfortunately I had deleted all my DVRed episodes because I had run out of space due to other programs I had recorded but hadn't gotten around to watching.  Sorry if it's TMI. ;)
You are going to get an effective workout with this.  I have been doing Gilad's workouts since 2006.  I have tried others, but always go back to this.  The 'extreme' type workouts such as P90X, etc. don't work for me because after a few days I just am so physically worn out that I stop doing them.  I have tried them, but have had to return them after I realize that I will not be motivated enough to continue with the program because the workouts are simply too intense.  With Gilad I ""feel the burn"" after the workout but don't feel so physically spent that I dread doing it again the next day.  I admire those that have stuck with P90X, Insanity, Turbo Fire, etc. but they are just not for me.
This particular DVD is ideal because it is not too long and not too short.  I do use another DVD for abs work, and that is the only reason I did give it a 4 and not a 5 - I really like that his Total Body Sculpt TV shows have abs work included.  I do this DVD 3 days a week, and try to add 30 minutes of cardio, and do pure cardio for 45 minutes on the days I don't do the Cuts and Curves.  Personally, I don't like using the bands and just use 5 or 8 pounds weights instead.  It really doesn't matter!
I am 43 years old and love the definition and muscle tone of my arms, legs, and mid section.  If you consistently do this, you will notice a difference.  You may not be completely 'ripped' in 6 weeks, but you will look and feel better, and you will keep doing the program, which is key.  I plan to buy more Gilad DVDs because I want to keep my cable bill down.
Seriously, Gilad is the only program I will stick to and that is the most important factor in exercise for me.  I no longer see the need to search elsewhere for fitness DVDs.  My sister has also become hooked on Gilad.  She has all his Total Body Sculpt episodes DVRed.  It's great because when I visit her, I can still do my workouts!",1310342400,6,2263,4.090702947845805
2650682,1,B000I0RNSO,"Was in the middle of working out and DVD was damaged. The workout was intense and I could tell it would give the results desired. I would recommend this DVD to all who enjoy a workout, but be careful about the seller.",1286496000,,217,4.190476190476191
2650683,4,B000I0RNSO,"This was a good workout but I didn't enjoy it as much as Gilad's Express, Body Sculpt and Total Body Sculpt Plus workouts.",1285286400,,122,4.3478260869565215
2650684,1,B000I0RNSO,Gilad's dvd's are very good.  However this particular dvd would not play on my dvd player.  Had to send it back and got a prompt response from Amazon.  Got my refund in a matter of days.,1270166400,,186,4.111111111111111
2650685,5,B000I0RNSO,"I purchased the Gilad Ultimate Body Workout set of 3 DVD because I am a aging man and needed to tone and strengthen my body. I have done several of the Gilad workouts on Fit TV and liked the idea of working on the total body and using light to medium weights<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gilad-s-Total-Body-Sculpt-PLUS-Cutting-Edge-with-Gilad/dp/B002ACZ72W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gilad's Total Body Sculpt PLUS: Cutting Edge with Gilad</a>. I was not disappointed, the Cuts and Curves work out every part of the body. The Core and More REALLY work out your core including your back. At my age of 54 I felt I was a aging old man and working a very demanding physical job, I was getting pains that I related to getting old. But after working out with the Gilad DVDs I fell stronger and I am developing muscles that I did not have. I don't hurt that much after a long days work. I am not saying it is a cure all but I like the way I fell, and look. I am doing the workouts about 4 to 5 times a week. I greatly recommend the workout, since I lost 95 lbs when I was young, it has been hard to keep the weight off and these DVDs do help. G.N.",1269043200,3,1180,4.623809523809523

2650687,5,B000I0RNSO,"Great workout for the winter months indoors (the video is done on a sunny day).
Gilad is encouraging & positive from start to finish.
This is a great DVD to add to your mix of indoor workout routines.

2650688,5,B000I0RNSO,"This is a great upper and lower body workout. I started working out with Gilad on Fit TV, so I decided to give some of his DVDs a chance. This work out does not disappoint. Gilad is motivating, but not annoying. I like that he uses both bands and weights in this workout. I have changed the workout sometimes and use weights where he uses the bands to mix it up.

I would compare this work out's intensity to my boot camp class where we do resistance training. This DVD does not contain any ab or core work which is designed to get you to buy the Core and More DVD, but I would still highly recommend getting this workout. My only complaint with this DVD is that the warm up at 15 minutes is too long. I have found other uses for this warm up - I will use it to warm up before doing Pilates and/or yoga.",1255305600,2,803,4.050314465408805

I enjoyed every exercise, and I sure feel it afterward.  The setting keeps you motivated as they do their exercises on a beach, with the backdrop being the ocean.  I think this DVD is filmed in Hawaii, but I'm not sure.  I try to workout to this DVD once or twice a week.",1241654400,4,427,4.2875

No abs, but that was strategic so you'd buy the Core & More video (which I think is well worth the buy).  My triceps didn't like that band too much!  OOH That was tough!  Gilad likes to lunge a lot too so be prepared for that.  I like Gilad's style -- it's definitely suitable for a man or a woman.  There is no dancing involved!  It has been offically added to the weekly routine.",1232755200,4,467,4.111111111111111

2650692,5,B000I0RNSO,"This is part of set of three dvds.  All excellent.  This one is for scupting and uses weights and a resistance band.  Don't worry, if you don't have a resistance band you can use weights instead, no biggy.  Also don't count on getting your heart rate up, like I said this is a scupting workout, so consider a jog/walk on the days you use this one if you want cardio too.

This is not a difficult workout, but I would suggest, expecially to beginners, to watch it first so you know what you need to do and as always with excercises watch your form so you don't injure yourself.",1227484800,,576,4.247706422018348

2650695,3,B000I0RNSO,"I bought this DVD because I was looking for a dumbbell workout and I already have a Gilad DVD that has some. This DVD was a disappointment for me because most of the workout is done with cables. I have some cables and I like to use them as an adjunct to free weights. I think the way they are use in this DVD is not suitable for me because when doing some of the movements there is no resistance or the resistance varies during part of the move. The cables are used for squats, lunges, bicep curls and tricep extentions, all of which I prefer to do with free weights. If you have or decide to buy this DVD I would suggest you do the exercises with free weights instead of using the cables. When free weights are used there is no mention of the range of weights one should use and it is not mentioned what Gilad and crew are using. There are no ab exercises in the routine. I am already familiar with most of the exercises in this DVD.

I have a few other exercise DVD's and I find none that are perfect.
I belive people like Gilad, Cathe Freidrichs, Denise Austin and other well known people like them should present products that address the complete needs for fitness. Needs such as good sleep, plenty of water,proper eating habits along with addressing every body part in their program. Gilad never mentions sleep or diet, Austin does but her exercises are not as challenging as Gilad or Cathe. Cathe is advanced exercise wise, but ,again, it's only exercise presented. I would suggestfinding DVD's that meet all the needs I mentioned in order to be successful. Tony Horton and others adress the totality of fitness.

I think any program that gets the heart rate up and works all the muscles of the body combined with good life style habits will put one on the path to success.",1216512000,3,1780,4.407294832826747

He actually inspires you to want to do each movement well and keeps you focused on the muscle being worked and your posture.  I love this workout and am looking forward to purchasing more of Gilad's DVDs.  The previous reviewers are unto something with Gilad!  Worth every penny :-)",1204070400,5,553,4.259615384615385

It was shortly after that i discovered Gilad and his workouts on fit tv, he is motivating & fun, but i am sometimes sore from his workouts. I DO feel very invigorated after doing them, no matter how sore i am!

Well, long story short.. i've been doing the workouts & have gone from a size 18 to a 14 AND i am continuing to do them to get much lower than what i'm at now (180 lbs. currently..)
