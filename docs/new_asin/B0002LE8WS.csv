2102880,5,B0002LE8WS,"It was only recently, to be honest, that I first learned who Gamera even was. Godzilla? Sure, I grew up on the guy... I've got the lunchbox, have taped the Godzilla's Rockin' New Year's Eve special many times and even saw the Andrew Lloyd Weber adaptation on Broadway during its woefully short run in 1994.

But now there's a NEW guardian of the universe? Why didn't anyone tell me?? Finally, someone did. Specifically, it was a co-worker from the main office of the Tokyo-based manufacturing company (it shall remain nameless) for which I have worked for the last 8 years. He was relocated to New York and has become a rather good friend.

Hunushi is a fantastic resource for all things Japanese. One of those is monster movies (""kaiju"" as the genre is called in Japan), and I am also a big fan. Knowing this, Hunushi recommended to me the first Gamera film when it was released in English in 1997. Since then, I have been hooked and wanting more.

Why do I like this Gamera series so much? The special effects are AWESOME, and the dubbing is simply masterful. Forget everything that you thought you knew about dubbed dialogue, as that knowledge is now useless and outdated. The story lines are engaging, the characters are well developed. These are great movies, period.

When I heard that a box set of all three movies (Gamera: Guardian of the Universe, Gamera 2: Attack of Legion and Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris) was available, I jumped on it.

I thought I knew why I was buying this box set, but I had no idea at the time that its most entertaining feature was an as-yet-unknown-to-me DVD extra. Within the extras of the second film, Gamera 2, the English-language director has created an entirely new and hilarious version of that film dubbed almost entirely with ""red neck"" character voices.

This is an absolute stitch, but in no way did it offend my delicate ""kaiju"" sensibilities. Gamera remains completely untouched in this tongue-in-cheek version of the film. Only the human contingent, scurrying below, is made to look anything less than admirable. The bottom line is this: I have never laughed harder in my life (by the way, there is also a fantastic DVD extra on the 3rd disc but I'll let you discover that one on your own).

I hope you enjoy these films as much as I have. Thankfully, it looks like Japan's best kept ""kaiju"" secret has just been let out of the box!",1108339200,99,2379,4.623222748815166
2102881,5,B0002LE8WS,"I need to append this; the movies are not in anamorphic widescreen. They are still very entertaining; however, the blu-ray ARE anamorphic. Sorry about the confusion.

I'm amazed by the story lines and special effects in these newer come-back movies of Gamera.  The box set was purchased with Christmas money, and I'm glad I did so.  Gamera began as low-budget giant monster movies in competition with Godzilla in about 1965.  Some of the early films are pretty cheezy, though fun to watch.  Kids especially seem to relate to the big turtle.  My daughter likes him as much as Godzilla.

The new Gamera pictures carry on the idea that Gamera is here to protect earth, but the story lines are very mature compared to the original films, and the special effects are, at times, amazing.  Every bit on a parr with the newer, new millenium Godzilla films of the past five years.  The first film in the pack, ""Gamera: Guardian of the Universe"", was release in 1995, and the others followed about every two years.  The origin of Gamera is reinvented here, and explained in a way that is a nice marriage of fantasy and science-fiction.  In the first film, Gamara's heroic mythology is backed up by an ancient tablet that predicts a giant creature will rise to combat an horrific darkness.  All evidence points to some sort of flesh eating creatures that nearly ate man to extinction in the time when Atlantis was still above water.

The second film, ""Attack of Legion"", is even better, with an even creepier creature and It's swarming spawn called ""Legion"" (from the Bible, no less) threatening earth's extinction yet again.  The special effects are better in this film, and that's saying a lot, since the first movie was very well done.

I haven't watched the third movie, ""Revenge of Iris"" yet, but even if it turns out to be disappointing compared to the first two, it was still money worth spending.

All three pictures are presented in anamorphic widescreen, with language options of the original Japanese with English subtitles, or in dubbed English.  The soundtracks are in Dolby digital 5.1. I really enjoyed watching the second film in the original Japanese, thus getting to hear the true emotions of the actors.  There are a lot of nice extras included on the disks, so take some time to explore.",1104364800,48,2296,4.784263959390863
2102892,5,B0002LE8WS,"I have watched all of the Gamera movies and also own them all but I had never seen REVENGE OF IRIS

it's the best of the Gamera movies. If your a big monster movie fan like I am I highly RECOMMEND  this movie to
anyone. The special effects is out of this world.",1499472000,,369,3.92
2102893,2,B0002LE8WS,"Be careful. I grew up with Gamera, and when I saw this I got extremely excited. However, it's only a blu-ray and will NOT play on standard DVD players; if you want one that plays on dvd you have to shell out at least $20 to third-party sellers. Extremely disappointed that it was not stated up front that this will not work on standard dvd players and lost money. Broken hearted.",1499212800,,379,4.352112676056338

2102896,4,B0002LE8WS,"I'm a big kaiju fan and this trilogy of Gamera films (1995-1999) is really good. Much darker than the kid friendly films of the 60s 70s and 80s. The effects are really good, even for guys in rubber suits, and the story ties across all three films. A no brainer for fans of monster movies.",1496966400,,288,4.254545454545455
2102897,5,B0002LE8WS,"Director Shusuke Kaneko, special effects wizard Shinji Higuchi, and writer Kazunori Ito showed up Toho's Godzilla series with these three movies made from 1995-1999. Made for a fraction of the cost Toho was spending on their Godzilla films at the time, and based on the classic Gamera films which had the stigma around the world of being cheap Godzilla knock-offs - this Gamera reboot had a lot stacked against it, but these creators managed the impossible and created the best kaiju movies made since the '60s heyday, blowing away what Toho had done for a couple of decades by that point.

Gamera: Guardian of the Universe (1995) starts the series, rebooting Gamera and enemy monster Gyaos as genetically engineered creatures left behind by an advanced, ancient civilization who awaken in modern day. This movie is most like '60s kaiju movies like Mothra vs. Godzilla and Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster in spirit. Despite a slicker, more fleshed out vibe than the old Gamera movies it actually retains a lot of stuff from those old films. The old Gamera was friend and protector of children, but the new one has a psychic connection to a teenage girl (so we've aged up from the little kids of the older films to someone a few years older - a good metaphor for the film overall).

Gamera 2: Attack of Legion (1996) is more sci-fi, and harkens back to procedural monster-on-the-loose films like Them! (1954). This is my favorite of the series, with a great ensemble cast and a terrific enemy monster which is totally alien. The Legion (consisting of enormous insects and plants that exist in a symbiotic relationship) isn't evil. It doesn't want to destroy the Earth. It's just that the process of its natural life cycle threatens destroy the world! This also has my favorite special effects of the series, as it still relies mostly on miniatures and monster suits which are extremely well executed (the next film would have a lot more digital effects).

Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris (1999) is more indebted to the Japanese horror films and anime. A girl who's parents were accidentally killed by Gamera during the finale of the first movie now becomes mentally connected to an enemy monster (mirroring Gamera's connection with the girl in the first film) which feeds off her hatred of the big turtle to become Gamera's ultimate foe! Most of the characters from Guardian of the Universe return, and this film really ties up the mythology behind the rebooted series, rooting it partially in ancient myth. This is also the darkest of the three films in tone.

This Blu-Ray set is terrific, especially for the cheap price. The films are in Japanese and subtitled, with an English dubbed option (I actually really like the dub for Gamera 2). There's also quite a bit of behind the scene footage, which is great if you've grown up with kaiju movies and want to see how the suits and miniatures are filmed.

- - - and a little info about what came after the movies in this box set - - -

After these movies made a splash director Kaneko got his shot at directing a Godzilla movie with Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack (2001), which is probably the best Godzilla film of that era (though a tad inferior to these Gamera films, with which Kaneko had more creative control and time). Higuchi recently got his chance to do his stuff with the monster king with modern classic Shin Godzilla (2016), which he co-directed and did the special effects for.

As for Gamera: he received yet another reboot in Gamera: The Brave (2006), which took Gamera back to his kid-friendly roots of the '60s. Monster fans, coming off the high of the more gritty and adult Gamera trilogy, weren't happy with this return to the old style, and partially because of that (as well as low popularity for kaiju in Japan at the time) the film was an enormous flop. This was pretty sad, as it was actually a charming movie that just went in a different direction. Since then Gamera hasn't had a new movie, but hopefully he'll return someday. As the Gamera Trilogy proved, there was more life in the jet-powered turtle than one might expect. You can't keep a good turtle down!",1496620800,,4165,4.744475138121547

2102965,5,B0002LE8WS,"I love Shusuke Kaneko movie trilogy, He made a homage from the classic Gamera in showa series, to his reboot and created a very action violent and dark tone. Love the visual effects it turn out on the screen. Making a awesome Gamera  suit for whole trilogy. 1st movie was cool, causing a destruction and facing off his old foe Gyaos and finish off with his powerful Fire Breath. 2nd movie he faced a new Kaiju called Legion and getting his ass beaten up till he finished off. 3rd Movie and the last was Awesome! I love his suit He's darker, a best design for Gamera 3. He flies in the sky with his rocket booster and spins through great effects and the camera shakes when he land or Causing destruction with a Boom Boom caused so many fatalities in Kyoto. A girl gets revenge after Gamera killed her parents from the first movie while fighting Gyaos. And found a creature hatch and later been raised named Iris. Fights Gamera, almost ending his life till he saved the girl and destroyed Iris. The ending I don't quite get about Bunch of gyaos flying and Gamera later chased them and what happened next? Still quite confusing about the ending, anyway the movie was the best. The same guy who directed GMK: Giant Monsters All-out Attack and the graphics and effect look pure. That's cool. Somehow, Shusuke Kaneko known for making a dark action film for Kaiju fans will appreciate. 10/10

2102973,4,B0002LE8WS,"Created in 1965, Gamera was an answer to Godzilla's success. It became more children-oriented as the years went on, becoming sillier and campier. That changed with the 1995 release of Gamera: Guardian of the Universe and its two sequels, 1996's Gamera: Attack of the Legion and 1999's Gamera: Revenge of Iris. Darker than their predecessors in both tone and visuals, this trilogy aimed much more for the teen and adult audiences.

This 2-disc Blu-ray set arrived in short order, about five days from purchase, counting the weekend. The English dubbing is (for the most part) surprisingly well-acted, much better than one would expect. That said, the subtitles are meant for watching with Japanese audio, and do not match up with the English language track. This isn't a knock-off collection, despite its price. I would have given the first disc more than one menu (for instance, there is no scene selection), but that's my biggest gripe.

2102999,5,B0002LE8WS,"Just got this one from Amazon recently. First of all, it should be mentioned that there is a difference between the first pressing and the recent pressing of this triple feature. The first pressing contains two blu ray cases, one for disc 1 (Gamera 1 & 2) and the other one for disc 2 (Gamera 3), all wrapped by a slipcase/slipcover. Meanwhile the recent pressing contains only one blu ray case, with no slipcase. The cover is the same as the slipcase cover, though. Of course, this is the version that I got.

Some other reviews mentioned that this is Japanese language only with English subtitles. That is wrong. There is an option for English audio. And some people complained about the missing subtitles, particularly on Gamera 3 (Revenge of Iris). Maybe that only happens on the first pressing, because I found that the subtitles on the recent pressing is just fine. All conversations have their subtitles. It's just that things like newspaper headlines etc are not subtitled... not really a big deal. Perhaps the recent pressing contains the updated disc with fixed subtitles? Not sure about that, but I read somewhere that Mill Creek has offered replacement disc for Revenge of Iris (fixed subtitles, mainly).

As for the movies themselves, these are classics. Definitely must have even if you're not a Gamera fan from the previous era. Even better than some of Godzilla movies, in my opinion. These three movies easily destroys Godzilla: Final Wars, for example.
(BIT OF SPOILER)... One last thing, at the end of Iris...after Gamera defeated Iris, there is footage of lots of Gyaos flying to Japan. Not sure what happened to them... maybe there was a plan for another Gamera movie under Shusuke Kaneko's direction? Pity that never happened and instead we got Gamera: The Brave.",1408147200,,1785,4.9072847682119205

2103006,4,B0002LE8WS,"I love these movies, they made me interested in the Gamera franchise.
If they were advertised in the US a little better by the time Godzilla (1998) came out, then it would've been the only time Gamera actually topped Godzilla.

As for the special features however; the Behind the scenes footage (while interesting) is over 2 hours and 50 minutes long! The reason I have a problem with that is you can't select the footage in individual short videos, if they did it that way, then we wouldn't have to worry about fast forwarding too far or skipping bits without knowing what's next! And the subtitles on the actual movies had some typos here and there, whenever they were trying to say ""was"" on the second movie it ends up appearing as ""w as"".

I've seen the English clips online and they sounded goofier than the original format, so I'm not taking chances.

  Of course the technology was better than when the original series of films were made, so be prepared for Gamera to get an upgrade for this set.  If you are a casual watcher of these films, than this set isn't for you. But if one likes the whole ""Giant Monster""  flicks, than this is definitely for you.  And being on Blu-Ray really brings out the quality of this series of Gamera films.  They are well done and let's face it!!!! The Japanese are the originators of the ""Giant Monster"" in film.

2103028,4,B0002LE8WS,"This Blu-ray set of the Shisuke Kaneko Gamera trilogy (the Heisei series) is superior monster mayhem but not necessarily superior print quality.  I had bought these films when previously released on DVD in a specialized packaging through the old Tower retail chain (remember them?) and I picked these discs up because of the great value that they represent but also because I expected superior graphics over the standard DVDs.  I didn't get those great graphics.  The transfer prints often feel grainy at points but the films didn't pop like I had hoped; they were comparable to the regular DVD releases, with perhaps slightly higher contrasts.  So I was certainly disappointed in this aspect.

But for anyone who might be new to Gamera or didn't get the older releases you, you are in for a real treat as all three of these flicks (""Gamera, Guardian of the Universe"" ""Gamera 2: Attack of the Legion"" a.k.a. ""Advent of Legion"" and ""Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris"") are great family fun in the giant monster vein.  Gamera is a giant turtle who can fly (!) with tusks (!) but who is connected to humanity (he was an Atlantean-created earth guardian) and draws power from the spiritual essence of the earth (a foreign concept to most westerners but these films are Japanese and this is a familiar concept in their animistic religions).  Gamera is forever getting seriously hurt as he stands in the way of giant man-eating bat-like monsters (Gyaos in the first and third films), alien outer space insectoid monsters (the Legion of the second film), and other antagonistic guardian evolutionary deities (Iris in the third film, a very unique and disquieting monster).  I love all of these films but my personal favorite from both a dramatic standpoint and simply superior SPX is ""Attack of the Legion"".

There are two female leads (an ornithologist and a young girl who shares a special bond with Gamera; we get to see her grow up across the three films) and one male supporting actor (starting out as a policeman he contracts PTSD after dealing with the Gyaos and ends up as a security guard in the second movie and as a drunk street vendor in the third) who also help carry the narrative throughout the three movies and give them some additional heart.

There's been a lot of debate as to whether these films are better than the concurrent Godzilla movies.  That's fine for the dedicated fans but it's also a matter of taste and if your taste runs in the sci-fi/ fantasy veins then you should quite enjoy these movies.

When I heard there were three Gamera movies from the 90's, I had to check it out.  Wow.  These films are awesome!  In Gamera's showa films, the flying sequences were probably okay for it's time, but the flying sequences in the 90's trilogy (especially a certain flight scene in Gamera 3) are crazy!  The special effects, story line, and monster designs are about as fantastic as a rubber-suit monster movie can get.  Yeah, I almost forgot to mention that Gamera's design gets better and better as the trilogy progresses.  He still has that 60's Gamera look in the first film, but by the third film he's a bad-ass looking turlte.  It's awesome!
The only thing that disappointed me was the second film's lack of a certain special feature that I was looking forward to experiencing.  There's a shortened version of Gamera: Attack of Legion that dubs redneck talk over the actors.  It's pretty hilarious, but you won't find it on the dvd.

2103065,5,B0002LE8WS,"Very nice, 2-disc set from Mill Creek containing all 3 Heisei-era films from acclaimed director Shusuke Kaneko. If you've never seen these movies but enjoy giant monster romps then you are in for a real treat. These late 1990 films are about as good the the genre gets. Period. If you know Gamera, but only from his older films from the 1960's-70's, then you're not only in for a treat, but a wonderful surprise as well. But be prepared; Gamera gets a whole new backstory here. I usually shudder whenever I hear the phrase ""re-imagining"" to describe a character/book/movie that I know & love. It's quite often an excuse by lazy movie studio types to make up some totally new crap and then slap a familiar name on it to boost ticket sales, regardless of how gawd-awful the end result may be. But don't worry folks, in this instance at least, the re-tooled origin makes sense and works beautifully.

Gamera is no longer some heretofore unknown prehistoric creature unleashed from an icy tomb. He's a genetically-designed answer to a deadly problem. Scientists from ancient Atlantis began playing God and created a perfect construct: the Gyaos. The creatures soon proved to be just a little too efficient and quickly began devouring everyone in sight; threatening the future of not only Atlantis, but the entire planet. The scientists hurriedly engineered Gamera as a self-contained weapon to combat the carnivorous bird creatures. Makes sense. I mean he's already got his own built-in, tank-like armor. They just added teeth & tusks for close-up combat, and made him more mobile by giving him the power of flight. A nice side benefit of the same exhaust gases that give Gamera the ability to fly also fuels his howitzer-esque plasma fireballs, for some serious monster-stopping power. Unfortunately, Gamera was completed too late. Atlantis was finished. But before it sank, the remaining leaders placed Gamera in stasis at the bottom of the sea in the hopes that, should the Gyaos ever re-awaken in the world somewhere, at some future time, Gamera would revive as well - to stop them once and for all.

Since his creation in 1965, Gamera has always been considered just a second rate wanna-be, designed to cash in on the success of the Godzilla films. (Which, in all honesty, he was.)  Most fans of the DaiKaiju Eiga (giant monster movie) genre dismiss the ""Friend Of All Children"" as nothing more than an also-ran character from a second rate movie studio. Just like Rodney Dangerfield, poor Gamera could never get any respect. I loved the early Showa-era GAMERA films from the 1960's & 70's, for their surreal wackiness and great sense of everything including the kitchen sink, ""anything goes"" fun. (I still love them, and they're the ones I usually find myself reaching for if I'm sick or feeling kinda low and I want a safe, enjoyable ""comfort food"" film to watch.)  With these three impressive ""re-imagining"" films the big turtle finally becomes a legitimate, honest-to-goodness contender for Japan's greatest giant monster. These motion pictures are fun, thrilling, emotionally intense, funny... and believe it or not, even scary at times! How about that!? Go! Go! Gamera!  :-D

The various actors are all good in their roles, with a special nod to Yukijir Hotaru  as cowardly-but-determined police inspector Osako. His character is one of the best ever in any Japanese giant monster film. His Inspector Osako demonstrates a marked (in some cases, sadly shocking) growth over the arc of the 3 films, as his life is impacted by the events tied to the appearance of Gamera. Ayako Fujitani plays impishly cute Asagi Kusanagi, a Japanese teenager psychically linked to Gamera through an ancient pendant. (As you may or may not know, she's the daughter of action star Steven Segal, but don't hold that against her. She's actually quite good here, far better than her old man ever was.) All of the aspects of this GAMERA trilogy are equally top-notch. The use of lighting & cinematography lend a modern look to these films while still keeping the classic elements of past giant monster battles. The musical scores for all three films, by composer K Ohtani, are also worth mentioning, as they are all quite good: subtle, stirring, soft, booming, sad, triumphant, eerie, joyous. The scores are nicely interwoven throughout these movies, adding extra layers to every scene.

A very special shout-out to the tremendous visual effects direction from young upstart Shinji Higuchi. His F/X work is awesome from the get-go but actually improves substantially in each succeeding film, ending in some very impressive CG work of the Gyaos creatures in G3. The level of detail, the scope of the sets and the choreography of the monsters battles is all the more impressive when you consider that EACH one of these movies had a total budget of only 5 million dollars!!! That wouldn't even pay for the pre-viz computer effects on a Hollywood sci-fi movie, let alone the finished product. Bravo! His ground-breaking contributions simply cannot be overstated. The creature suits & miniatures are unbelievably impressive and, given the restrictive budget he had to work with, are nothing short of amazing. Gamera looks terrific in this trilogy of films and, perhaps even more impressively, actually shows physical signs of aging/maturity over the course of the 3 films with each suit: from a goggly-eyed, freshly re-awakened young turtle in the first film, then showing a more mature look in the second, and finally to the weary, weathered, scarred and sunken-eyed old veteran of multiple creature conflicts in the last entry.

This is a really nice set, in beautiful hi-def 1080p Blu-ray, and at a very reasonable price, too! The color palette is reproduced faithfully with no tweaking. The blacks are solid & strong, the focus is sharp with the appropriate amount of film grain visible, (no DNR over-scrubbing, yeah!), and little or no pixelation or artifacting. The sound design is very strong & consistent, whether you're listening to the original Japanese mix w/English subtitles or the English-dubbed tracks. (All of which are pretty good, too.) There are some interesting extras included. Major kudos to Mill Creek for the overall quality of this release. In fact, my only real gripe is putting two of the films onto one disc for space-savings. Each film should have gotten its own individual disc, but that's a relatively minor complaint since the films do look good. This 2-disc, 3-film boxset, along with their equally outstanding DaiMajin trilogy release are both fantastic bargains from Mill Creek!

2103083,5,B0002LE8WS,"The first movie in the Gamera reboot was excellent.  The second move, Attack of the Legion, has to be the best Kaiju (literally ""strange Japanese creature"") movie I have ever seen! Director Shusuke Kaneko and writer Kazunori It deserve accolades. Both movies are suspenseful, the action only stops to catch its breath before the next onslaught, and the special effects are better than you might think.
The movies come up with a reasonable backstory for Gamera and his mortal enemies, the bird-like Gyaos. The ecological message is strong while not beating you over the head. The actors do a great job with the material they have.
In fact, I like Kaiju movies because they AREN'T hyper-realistic; there's less cringing on my part that way. The movies in this Gamera trilogy walk the fine line between campy effects and eye-popping CGI very well.
The destruction of the city of Sendai in the second film is especially noteworthy. It must be extra-emotional for Japanese viewers because they've actually had cities destroyed by atomic bombs.
The actors are good as well.
The third film in the series, Revenge of Iris, isn't as good as the other two, but it's still great for a kaiju movie. And the first 30 minutes of the third film are excellent. Watching people get burned to cinders as Gamera battles the Gyaos really brings it home that ""real"" monster attacks would be absolutely terrifying for ordinary citizens. I thought it was a great touch that Japan has an anti-monster council, and one of the main issues they were debating is ""why the heck does Japan suffer so many monster attacks?"" The only reason I think this movie suffers is because, frankly, the main villain monster isn't quite up to par. I know what they were going for, but it looks too plasticky.
So, let's review. You get three great Japanese monster movies, two of which are excellent, and one is the best kaiju movie I've ever seen. And you get all three for less than $9 in Blu-Ray format! Really, what are you waiting for?
One frustrating note -- I had to put the movies on ""play"" then use a pop-up menu to get the English captions; there is no way to access the set-up menu (that I can find) before you play the movies. So be aware of that.",1388102400,2,2215,4.650510204081633

  The recent incarnation of giant creatures have had their share of hits and misses.

Also as a side note. You will read reviews here raving about the ""Texarkana"" audio selection on the second film. It is not in this bluray set. That is only available in the DVD form apparently. This isn't a gripe, but I did want to clarify that. They have some clips on YouTube by searching ""Gamera Texarkana"" and if that appeals to you just know that you will have to seek out that movie in DVD form.

I'm not trying to start some Godzilla/Gamera fanboy argument. I'm a Godzilla fan as well. I always liked the Gamera movies but the old ones always seemed to be missing something that the Godzilla films had. The old movies were all campy as hell but something about the Godzilla movies seemed to have a little more polish. However, this trilogy, from the special effects to the origin story, to the explanation of Gamera's connection to the earth and mankind, to the sacrifice Gamera makes to win in the final film. There is more personality and polish in these films than the Godzilla movies made during the same time frame. Since they are bringing back Godzilla for a new decade...

2103116,5,B0002LE8WS,"Plot

The year is 1995, the Kairyu-Maru, a ship carrying plutonium, collides with a floating atoll off the eastern coast of the Philippines. Similar events start occurring throughout the area and a team of scientists lead by Naoya Kusanagi (Akira Onodera) are called to investigate the atoll as it approaches Japan.

Meanwhile, Ornithologist Mayumi Nagamine (Shinobu Nakayama) is called to the Goto Archipelago to investigate a mysterious village attack claimed to have been caused by a ""giant bird"". Further descent into the forest leads the investigation crew to encounter the giant bird. After chasing it away from the island, Nagamine discovers two more giant birds.

Meanwhile, the atoll investigation team uncover several stone amulets and a stone slab at the center of the anomalous formation. The strange writing engraved on the slab reveals the names of Gamera, the Guardian of the Universe, and Gyaos, the Shadow of Evil. The atoll suddenly starts to quake and the slab is destroyed. As the scientists are thrown into the water, Marine Officer Yoshinari Yonemori (Tsuyoshi Ihara) encounters the eye and tusk of a giant turtle.

Back in Japan, Nagamaine agrees to aid the government to capture the giant birds. The three creatures are lured away from the Goto Archipelago to the Fukuoka Dome baseball stadium. Prior to commencing the operation, Yonemori arrives of the dome to warn the military of a 60 meter creature approaching Fukuoka. However, his claims are ignored and the operation commences. The birds land upon seeing large chunks of meat laid down for them inside the stadium and are soon attacked with tranquilizers. All except for one which makes its escape. Upon reaching the harbor, the bird is attacked and killed by the giant turtle Yonemori encountered and explained. The giant turtle rampages its way across the city to reach the dome, attempting to destroy the birds. The birds manage to wake up and escape before the turtle reaches them. In a moment of awe, the turtle too leaves by igniting its booster jets and flies away.

At the Kusanagi house, he reveals to Yonemori and his daughter Asagi (Ayako Fujitani) that the slab tells the names of the creatures. The giant turtle is Gamera and the birds are Gyaos. Yonemori then gives Asagi one of the discovered amulets as a gift and a bond between her and Gamera is soon binded. Kusanagi shares the deciphered slab information with the Japanese military, who have targeted Gamera as the enemy due to its immense size.

However, Kusanagi, Yonemori, and Nagamine are called to the Kiso Mountain Range for a Gyaos attack on the village. As Yonemori and Nagamine attempt to rescue a child, Gamera arrives in time to save them and stop the Gyaos. Despite killing another one, the last Gyaos escapes.

Asagi discovers that her unwilling bond with Gamera forces her to share the same pain Gamera suffers. She later heads to Mount Fuji after hearing on the radio of a military counter attack against Gamera occurring the following evening. The counter attack on Gamera commences with the creature not fighting back. As soon as Asagi arrives to witness the attack, the final Gyaos arrives to combat Gamera. Gyaos manages to mortally wound the giant turtle and Asagi in the process, forcing Gamera to retreat back to the ocean. Kusanagi visits his daughter at the hospital where Asagi falls into a long deep sleep as Gamera too slumbers to regain his energy.

Nagamine and Yonemori put the pieces together by uncovering that ten thousand years ago, an advanced civilization created the Gyaos to eliminate rampant pollution. However, the Gyaos grew stronger, started breeding and began feasting on humans. For protection, Gamera was created to fend off the attacks. The onslaught of the Gyaos was eventually halted, and they were forced into hibernation. Despite the best efforts of its people, the advanced civilization was ruined. So, the scientists preserved the last remaining Gamera and bequeathed him to the next civilization, should the Gyaos ever return. More light is shined on the matter when a friend of Nagamine reveals to her and Yonemori that the Gyaos species only possess one chromosome. Apparently, the Gyaos are both male & female and have the ability to reproduce on their own. This startling new revelation is soon realized when the final Gyaos evolves into a Super Gyaos and attacks Tokyo.

This event forces the Japanese Government to revert their target from Gamera to Gyaos. In an attempt to kill Gyaos in broad daylight, the military launch heat seeking missiles at Gyaos who miraculously dodges them and gets them to destroy the midsection of Tokyo Tower. Gyaos then forms a nest at the top of the Tower where it slumbers until its next attack.

Because of several failed attempts to destroy Gyaos, citizens flee the city in an act of fear. Leaving Tokyo nearly deserted. Nagamine and Yonemori discover the final piece of the puzzle, the amulet Asagi carries. After trying to explain to Kusanagi that the amulet somehow links Asagi and Gamera together and share a life force, Kusanagi dismisses it as ridiculous claims until he witnesses it himself.

The following morning, Gamera returns to destroy Gyaos once and for all. The battle forces Asagi, Kusanagi, Nagamine, and Yonemori to pursue in a helicopter to witness the air decisive battle. Initially, Gyaos emerges victorious after Gamera failed to crash into an oil refinery with Gyaos. However, Asagi uses what's left of her energy to resurrect Gamera. Both monsters charge their energy to finish each other off but Gamera takes the upper hand and blasts Gyaos to pieces.

As Gamera roars in victory, he turns to look upon Asagi's face for the first time and, in gratitude, releases her of their bond together and returns to the sea. Despite the Gyaos being destroyed, Nagamine believes more Gyaos may appear if the environment continues to strive the way it does. But Asagi assures them that Gamera will return if the human race ever needs him again.",1363651200,,6000,4.989

2103132,5,B0002LE8WS,"I was actually expecting these movies to be a lot cornier.  Yeah, Gamera is obviously a guy in a rubber suit, but even with that, the effects are really well done The dubbing is also excellent... once you find the option for English language rather than Japanese (would have been nice on the main menu), the voices synch up pretty well.  There are a few spots where there is quite a bit of untranslated Japanese text on the screen, even with the subtitles turned on.  But overall, the stories are very good... the first two are typical of the genre, and the third is surprisingly dark.  At 10 bucks for 3 movies, it's a good bargain.",1361232000,,633,4.431034482758621

First, let me start by saying, the transfer for this movie is outstanding. The video quality is excellent and the audio is A+. Really great effects for a monster movie. This is the only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 2.

The Bad:
With even cheap, off-the-shelf $5 Blu-Rays, I get a menu. This set has no menu to select Audio, Subtitles, etc, or chapters selection. So, I had to use my remote to select the audio (Japanese by default, I had to scroll through to get to English) and turn off the subtitles (they are on by default). If your remote doesn't let you do this, your stuck with subtitles and Japanese. The only real options you have is to select which of the movies you want to watch. I had to turn off my Blu-Ray player in mid-movie and other movies always pick up where they left off when I turn my Blu-Ray back on, but not this one. I actually had to start the movie over again, then skip chapters manually and fast-forward/rewind to I got to almost where I left off. What a  pain!

The campy, goofy humor -the special effects (or sometimes lack of), the campy plots and story-lines -what's not to love?! I own a DVD copy of the movie ""Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack"" and love it! The effects, the acting and the story were far better than many of the original Godzilla movies (NOT THE original mind you...) and when I found out the same director had made three movies with Gamera, I had to have them.

Look, these movies are still campy, goofy and funny. The special effects aren't so mind blowing that they are top notch.  HOWEVER, the effects for these kind of giant monster ""guy in a rubber suit"" movies are fantastic and very well done... They did use some CGI, though it dated for 2012.  This does not take away from the fact the movies are still well done, well directed and well filmed.

2103162,4,B0002LE8WS,"The history of these NEW generation Gamera trilogy was that of fighting against history of stereotype monster movies and the managers of the movie company.
Of course Japanese monster movies are for kids and kid-minded adults (they say so) and there had been only a few exceptions such as the original Godzilla. The first of this trilogy is still ""one of those movies"" by demand of the market. But because the first was welcomed by the audience, the staff could get more freedom to make their next movie unique, describing background what's going on in a reasonable way, which had long been discarded in kids-oriented monster movies.

And the third. Please keep it in mind that the movie was first projected in 1999, close to the end of the last millennium (of course the end of the last millennium was 2000). This movie was the first Japanese monster movie in which hundreds and thousands of people were killed by monsters on-screen. This clearly reflected a mood of the country (unfortunately the situation of the real world is getting closer and closer to that of the movie).
So the third is more like a normal story-oriented science-fiction movies than ""Kaiju"" movies. Only the difference is three monsters playing sub-leading roles. Most of actors and actress played their roles quite well.

About the first and second, you can enjoy them when you are familiar with Japanese-style monster movies. So I dare not to recommend beginners to watch those movies in a chronological order. Watch the third, second and then the first, and stop watching when you find you can not enjoy the movie anymore.

All three films look excellent on BluRay but the subtitles leave a bit to be desired, some things are mistranslated and at times there are no words offered at all. But, it doesn't distract from the experience. I haven't watched the dubbing versions yet, so I can't offer any advice on that.

It does alter his origins slightly, in the original Gamera is a prehistoric turtle awakened by atomic testing, and does show a different way that he is the ""friend of all children"" by giving him a psychic link to one, technically a teenage girl, in the first one. Something that's mirrored nicely in the third movie with Iris.

Well I saw this on here and actually did a bit of research to see what they were about and I gotta say I was surprised, if you've only watched Godzilla flicks then Gamera will certainly put a smirk on your face one way or another.  These three films in particular make him look rather vicious as far as a monster goes, he's a set good guy rather than a destructive lizard who just doesn't care.  But at the same time the military won't leave him alone as he tries to save the universe, the blue ray discs themselves are in the box a bit wierd but with a little work you can get em out easily enough.  The special features are actually a lot more in depth than first expected, behind the scenes explosion construction commentary, suit making and monster discussion, stuff for certain characters fans and yada yada yada.  Point is the movies are worth it if you like watching monsters fight, cause there are always a beasty or two looking to brawl and the final battles are always worth it.  Theres monster blood and human disentagration left and right.

2103189,4,B0002LE8WS,"For movie watchers who love Japanese monster movies - Godzilla in particular - the Gamera Trilogy Blu-ray Set is a MUST BUY.
I would give this set a Perfect Score, but I have to be honest and take a point away as this is enjoyable by All, but will ONLY be Loved by fans of Godzilla Films.
All 3 Films were made in the 90's so there is a noticeable improvement in quality over early Godzilla Films. This Trilogy is a modern HD Reboot of the 1960's Gamera Franchise.
The Following Review will be made in the effort not to Spoil the Joy of watching the movie.

The 1st film entitled Gamera: Guardian of the Universe Sets up the who, what, where, and why.
Gamera is a giant turtle. In the 1st film his Enemies are the Gyaos - Reptilian looking ""birds"" that were created by an Ancient Advanced Civilization (Like Atlantis) They were created to be both male and female, so they can reproduce and lay eggs as much as they like. However these ""Birds"" Developed a nasty habit of eating the members of this Ancient Civilization. Before they went extinct the Scientists Created Gamera. But it was too late for them, so they encapsulated Gamera to sleep until a future Civilization needed Him. The Gyaos ran out of food and Died off, but Some eggs survived over the ages hidden in the hills of remote Islands near Japan. Well In modern day the eggs decide to hatch and the birds start of around 15 meters but grow the more they eat (1 by the end of the movie grows to 100 meters). Around the same time an Island mass floats along the currents near japan. Gamera eventually emerges from within this mass and is 60 meters tall.
Typical humans at first believe Gamera is the Bigger Threat and try to kill him (Even though the Gyaos ""birds"" have shown that humans are on the menu, while All Gamera has done is fight the Gyaos, not harming humans except the unavoidable destruction of buildings etc that is a staple in Japanese monster movies.) By the end they realize Gamera is helping and let him do his thing.

A great subplot involves a daughter of one of the Scientists who discovered Gamera's ""Island Capsule"". The Scientist gives his daughter one of the dozens of ""raptor claw"" looking symbols made out of an unknown metal. She Wears it as a necklace and forms a ""LIFE ENERGY"" link with Gamera. If he gets a cut on the face for example, so does she etc. She can also communicate telepathically with Gamera. She Appears throughout all 3 films.

Everyone know Godzillas powers etc...so lets go over Gamera's. Unlike Gozilla's energy blasts, gamera can shoot giant fireballs from his mouth...Not just normal fireballs these suckers can blow up entire city blocks. He can also FLY by way of Jet like energy that blasts out of where his legs retract. He also shows the ability to absorb the energy of Nearby Fire and heal/power up.

The 2nd Film, entitled Gamera 2: Attack of the Legion involves Gamera Fighting off hundreds of Alien Insect like Soldiers dubbed the ""Legion"" They arrive on the scene when NASA informs Japan that a Cloud of meteors will land near and on Japan. The tipoff that these aren't just metoers is the fact that they are found to slow down before impact...Turns out the ""Legion"" are sent by Extraterrestrials hoping to Colonize the Earth. Gamera Works his mojo and fight all the legion small and Very Large and saves the day. In the Final battle Gamera has to absorb energy from around the earth and launches a devastating fire blast from his Stomach.

The 3rd Film, Entitled Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris take place 4 years after the 1st film and sees the return of the Gyaos from the 1st film. Only this time there's more of them, and they have a new member named IRIS, who was raised by a young girl whose parents were accidently killed by Gamera in the 1st film. The IRIS  Creature is not a Gyaos. There is a subplot involving Japanese lore Where a Tortoise(turtle) is the Defender of the North and the Phoenix is the defender of the south and fights the enemies of the south. When the girl who raised it bonded with the phoenix creature (not a red bird rising from the ashes, this has tentacles that in the beginning Suck a human dry until they look like a mummy) it telepathically linked with her and Mimicked her hatred for Gamera, because Gamera had also killed its ancestors.

Gaurdien introduced Gamera to a new generation and elated long time fans to see Gamera in a more serious tone. Attack of legion is classic japanese monster mayhem and Revenge of Iris is the ultimate cap to a splendid trilogy. Thanks to Mill Creek these movies are on blu-ray altogether at a real cheap price. Definatly worth picking up!",1321315200,2,514,4.786516853932584
2103194,2,B0002LE8WS,"I was really looking forward to this set the minute I saw it.  The picture quality was awesome and the deleted scenes and behind-the-scene extras were a nice bonus.  However, the fact that English subtitles drop 1 in 8 lines of dialogue is inexcusable.  They didn't even re-dub the English version, simply reapplying the ADV dub.  The only improvements I can find about this version is the picture quality and the box art.....  It's a terrible shame because these films deserve so much more than this lack-luster treatment",1321056000,20,522,4.886363636363637
2103195,5,B0002LE8WS,"Most of the reviews here seem to be comparing this set to the DVD releases, so I'll aim this review at people who, like myself (until I bought the set, anyway) have never seen these movies. One note first off: A few other reviews have mentioned some subtitle problems with the third film: Revenge of Iris. Since I grew up watching dubbed anime, (Especially Dragon Ball Z and Gundam Wing on Cartoon Network) I will always watch a dubbed version if it's available, so I can't comment on the quality of the subtitling. (In fact, I'm still kind of mad at the special edition Gojira DVD for not doing a dubbed track for the original Japanese version of the film.) I CAN say that my one very minor gripe with this release is that Japanese ""location labels"" and newspaper headlines are frequently used in the movies to bring the audience up to speed, and none of these are translated. Kind of annoying, but not enough for me to knock the review down to less than five stars.

Anyway, on to an actual discussion of the three Gamera movies, which, you may or may not remember, is supposedly the reason I'm writing this review. I've been a huge fan of Godzilla/Gojira since I was four years old, but these three Gamera films would compare very favorably with three of the best of the Big G's films from 1984-2004. Even comparing, say, Godzilla vs. Biollante, Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla, and Godzilla Final Wars, I still might have to give the edge to Gamera. Why? Well, let's take a closer look at:

Gamera 1: Guardian of the Universe - Technically, Gamera doesn't guard the entire universe, just our planet, but he does a fine job of it. While Gamera's look hasn't changed as much from his '60s version as Godzilla's has, he still looks much more dignified and imposing here than he did back then. Gyaos was probably the best villain from Gamera's '60s movies, so bringing him back here, and having Gamera face off against more than one, was a good way to kick the series off. The movie also gives Gyaos (and Gamera himself) a much better backstory than it had in the '60s. While Gamera's psychic connection to Asagi is never explained as much as I would have liked it to be, it does kind of provide a retroactive explanation for why Gamera was always rescuing annoying little kids back in the '60s. A very enjoyable movie overall, but this series was just getting started.

Gamera 2: Attack of the Legion - Of the three films, this one is the most inconsistent in terms of quality, but I also ended up liking it the best. There were several parts where I wished that Mike, Crow, and Tom Servo would suddenly appear at the bottom of the screen and start riffing away, (In fact, the main male scientist character spends the third act of the movie wearing a pink and purple winter coat. When he first showed up in that, I couldn't help quipping: ""Tell your little sister thanks for the jacket,"" out loud, even though I was watching the movie by myself.) but when the action starts, you'll forgive all that real quick. The plot is the weakest of the three movies: A meteor shower results in an alien infestation for Japan. However, I'll give some originality points for not having the action start right in Tokyo. The first place the aliens invade is Hokkaido. I think mainly what made this movie the best for me is the enemy kaiju. The Legion Queen (Inarticulately called ""the big one"" by all the humans in the movie) is simply one of the best evil kaiju ever. I'd put her up there with Destroyah, Kaiser Ghidorah, or Godzilla himself (when he's the bad guy) in terms of sheer awesomeness and overwhelming power. In fact, in the end, Gamera can't beat her on his own, and has to draw on the power of the entire world in order to prevail. (It's a lot like Goku's Spirit Bomb technique in Dragon Ball Z.) Both of Gamera's fights with the Legion Queen are among the best I've seen in any kaiju movie. I don't think even Godzilla's fight against Kaiser Ghidorah in Final Wars is quite as good, or as exciting. For that alone, this film justifies the purchase of the whole set. Finally, there's:

Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris - Most of the other reviewers seem to think that this is the best film of the three. I don't. It's not that it isn't exciting; It is. It's not that you don't care about the human characters; You do, probably moreso than in the other two films. It just... Reminds me a lot of End of Evangelion, and I do NOT mean that as a compliment.

Let's start at the top: Gamera was given an edgier, more sharp-edged appearance in this one, very similar to the update Godzilla would soon receive in Godzilla 2000. He's as awesome as ever. This movie brings back the Gyaos, unfortunately for no apparent reason, since they play no part in the final battle. Gamera does have a battle with a few of them early on, but this only serves to get the human military to foolishly turn against Gamera, since he fights them in the middle of a city, and civilian casualties result. Apparently no one in the military is smart enough to wonder would would have happened if the Gyaos had landed and Gamera hadn't been around. Anyway, after that, the Gyaos sit this one out.

As for the main evil kaiju, Iris, this one had a lot of promise, but it never seemed to be realized. Her backstory indicates that what we learned about Gamera and the Gyaos in the first movie wasn't the WHOLE story by a long shot, but we never learn much more than that. Gamera's aerial battle with Iris was pretty impressive, but all too brief. Once the monsters land, well... Things go downhill. The final battle takes place as much in the mind of one human teenager is it does in a fight between Gamera and Iris. And when Gamera and Iris do get down to business, the actual battle is well done, but surprisingly brief. Think the end of Kill Bill Volume 2. I was left with the impression that we never got to see what Iris could REALLY do if she was good and riled up. After that, the movie just kind of ends, even though the story isn't over. There's still a whole swarm of Gyaos out there, after all, but apparently they were being saved for a Gamera 4 that never happened. Overall, while Revenge of Iris is definitely worth watching, I found it to be the weakest of the three films.

However, despite some complaining at the end there, this is a great collection! If you're a fan of Godzilla, there's no way you won't love this trilogy. On top of that, the price is simply incredible. This collection would be a good value at $45-$50, so getting it for $12.99 is one heck of a bargain. The movies are all visually stunning and very exciting, plus they feature more depth than you typically find in this genre. At this price, I'd recommend that even people who don't typically like giant monster movies give this collection a shot; I doubt that you'll regret it.",1321056000,5,6824,4.47191011235955
2103196,5,B0002LE8WS,"I love Gamera as much as I like Godzilla! I watched most of his movies from the 1960s, dispite that they were all a little goofy, they really appealed to the kid in all of us! And now we have these three movie for the 90s;

The cardboard slipcase is colorful and attractive, with a very professional design, much better than other Mill Creek releases. The problem of this set are the subtitles on the second disc: the movie ""Gamera 3"" has lots of missing and out of sync sentences which make the movie much less enjoyable (for example, Kurata Shinya's explanation of the Gamera graveyard is totally lost if you watch the movie that way). And subtitles on extra features get progressively out of sync until there is a delay of seven seconds between characters speaking and subtitles appearing on screen.

2103212,4,B0002LE8WS,"Hey guys, my first buy on Amazon and I've got to say, it was worth it. Having been a long-time fan of all things Ultraman, I was recommended to watch the DaiKaiju movies such as Godzilla but I wasn't really interested in the infamous radioactive lizard. Then I came across Gamera after seeing a couple of Kaiju Revoltech toys on the shelves of the hobby store I frequented.

Soon enough, I had my pre-order placed and it wasn't a bad deal whatsoever.

First, on the subtitles quality. For the first two movies (Guardian of the Universe and Attack of Legion), the subtitles are pretty detailed. Background conversations or on-screen news reports are subtitled for the viewer to follow the flow of information (and it's actually quite a lot) but the subtitling takes a sudden nose-dive in Gamera:Revenge of Iris. It got so bad I actually switched to Dub, which is very rare of me to do. Its probably one of the reasons why I can't really give the set 5 stars straight out and what's more unsettling is that Revenge of Iris has probably the best storyline of the trilogy.

Now that we've got that out of the way. Gamera is chocked full of awesome characters aside from the Kaiju themselves. It doesn't hurt that most of the actresses cast are very lovely in their own right (I actually have quite a small crush on Miki Mizuno now). Colonel Watarase from G2 for example is this uber-courageous commanding officer leading from the front.

And the Kaiju battles...Wow. Having been raised on typical monster of the week type battles in Sentai, Kamen Rider and Ultraman, I expected some corniness. It does show up from time to time..usually when kids are involved in the scene but the moments pass quickly when Gamera and Gyaos (or Legion or Iris) beat the @#&$ out of each other painting the city green with giant kaiju blood!

Overall, its a satisfying trilogy, the last feature's closing scene of a Gamera standing amidst a Kyoto in flames whilst a storm brews carrying a swarm of Gyaos towards him...Well...Last stands just don't get better than that!",1318204800,,2047,4.706703910614525

2103215,4,B0002LE8WS,"Just arrived today. I have the original Japanese LD's of these films in all their special editions, Japanese DVD box set (5 disc box set), ADV DVD box set, and now these great Blu-rays. In my opinion, after watching G3 (getting ready to watch 1 and 2, that this is the best version yet. The picture and sound are stunning. The 1:85:1 is perfectly placed in the 16;9 format (with slight black bars at the top and bottom of my HD 60 inch screen). The DTS HD sounds a little overdone, but I don't have a lossless reciever, so take that for what it's worth. The 5.1 DTS however, sounds spectacular!
Also, it seems that the Toshiba and ADV subtitle scripts have been tweaked a little, correcting some previous mis-translations, and also providing more detail to some dialog in others. It's not perfect (some dialog is still subtitled wrongly or the same as the previous versions, EX: The last line of the Military leader in the control room in his final scene is still ""Lots!""), but for the most part it was welcome and actually made the already layered story even deeper.

And for the price! Amazing deal! I say go for it!",1317340800,4,1118,4.5073891625615765
2103216,5,B0002LE8WS,"OK, IF you are a Daikaiju (*giant monster) fan then you SHOULD KNOW though Godzilla is ""King of all Monsters"", the ""Gamera Trilogy"" is the king of DaiKaiju films.  Seriously, these films ROCK - especially ""Gamera 3"" in my opinion.  Ever wonder what it would be like to be living in Japan and having giant monsters crashing around you're while you're in the streets (running for your life hopefully!), or in the subway or in your office building?  Wonder no more as you'll find out!  Honestly I was very happy to see this ""triple feature"" on Blu-ray and for this price?  WOW!  Can't wait!

Now, one last thing, like all daikaiju films, if you watch these films and see a man in a rubber suit crashing around a cardboard city then you're most likely going to hate these films BUT if you watch these movies using your imagination then get ready to enjoy!  (*for the record - the special effects get better and better especially in ""Gamera 3!)

For the Toho company to make these amazing movies, I am greatly happy and very surprised. Especially on the effects and the great story lines for each movie. The best of the Gamera series has to G3. due to the effects and all of the action and violence. This monster series has satisfied my hunger for giant monster action when I watch these films. I am greatly happy with all the work Toho has put into these movies.

Not to mention Gamera has the earth and people's interest at heart. Now that the basics are gone over, get this box set. All three are excellent, especially if viewed in chronological order (Guardian, Attack and Revenge). The only disappointment for me was the ending of the last movie. It left things wide open for a 4th movie in this series and here it is 12 years later and no movie. If you guys in Japan are reading this, please, do it. There's plenty of Kaiju fans out there.

2103219,5,B0002LE8WS,"I'm been a lifelong fan of Kaiju (giant monster) films, and when it comes to monsters Godzilla is King. Gamera well, he's typically been relegated to the Go-Bot to 'zilla's Transformers. Well that changed in the 90s! While Godzilla has always been quite steadily released over the decades, Gamera has been a little less frequent, in the 90s he put out some killer films! The production value, the action, the acting and the fx are all top notch through this series, some of the greatest most enjoyable Kaiju films I've ever had the pleasure of viewing!
They may be out of print, but they are all attainable, for an added bonus be sure to check out the alternate audio on Gamera 2, referred to as ""Lake Texarkana Gamera"" which is a completely different audio track with the characters all having redneck voices, his as hilarious as it sounds!!",1286150400,,842,4.695945945945946
2103220,5,B0002LE8WS,"This is one of the best box sets I have ever purchased and these films are THE BEST monster movies I have ever seen...maybe even some of the best science fiction I have ever seen.

Gamera is the giant genetically engineered creature (turtle) created by the long lost civilization of Atlantis (or Mu) who has been revived from centuries of hibernation to do what he does best...protect the earth.

His adventures during these films feature good special effects (for a Japanese movie and by that I mean they don't throw away as much money as Americans do on features) and great writing with good characters to make these tales come to life.  Also there is good plot development as it relates to the reasons (science) behind these monsters and all that they do.  This helps the films to be enjoyed because it allows the audience to feel as if all these things could be possible.

The Music of these films is also enjoyable and I would own them if I could find them at a somewhat reasonable price.

A word of caution these films might not be good for a younger audience as they have some scary elements and some gore.  I would recommend that you view them first before allowing your young monster enthusiast to partake of all the ""shelly"" goodness.

Another note is that ADV Films is no longer in business and therefore these films and this set in particular are becoming harder to find.  Those that are easier to find are going to be priced unreasonably high as some people enjoy ripping people off so beware.  I would not pay more than $50.00 for this set but that is up to you.

Texarcana Lake Gamera is one of the funniest things I've ever seen/heard. More like ""What's Up, tigerlily?"" than Mystery science theater, they redubbed the entire movie except for the main female character in redneck voices and altered the script to hilarious effect while still following the general storyline. It's rare that something will make me laugh sitting watching it by myself but this one had me chuckling throughout. I could have done without about 50 of the ""Holy Crap!"" dubs that were WAY overused but some of the things were so clever that I forgive them this one excess. The General that sounded like George Bush was hilarious, the one who was dubbed with the voice of a 7 year old boy was insane and the radioman that just says ""Kyuh Kyuh Kyuh"" like Roscoe P. Coltrane from the ""Dukes of Hazzard"" was genius.  I have yet to watch the third film but I have no doubt the commentary by Gamera will be amusing. Unless it's just Gamera screaming through the whole movie in which case it will only be amusing for about 30 seconds.

2103238,4,B0002LE8WS,"I never heard of this monster called Gamera before, till I saw it here at Amazon. I read a few of the reviews and thought: ""Let's try this"".

I'm really glad I did. This is a great collection of three terrific movies. The special effects are stunning. I don't think I ever saw more beautiful explosions. The explosion of the Kyoto train station (in the third movie: Revenge of Iris) is incredible, as well as the total destruction of Tokio when Gamera suddenly appears in that same movie.

And what about the acting. Well, I've seen a lot worse in Godzilla films. The third film is without a doubt the best acted film of the three, but the other two ain't bad at all.

The stories aren't great, the second one is a mess really. There are so many characters you cannot tell them apart, but this second movie has the most fantastic monster though. It is called Legion and it really is a worthy adversary. Great stuff !!!

And then something about the extra's on the disc's: A lot of trailers and an interesting three part interview with the special effects director. But the craziest extra is a soundtrack (on the second film) in which all the characters speak like rednecks and the music is changed to hillbilly style. It's called the Texarcana lake track. It's insane but absolute fun.

Now, the big question, should you buy this. If you like Godzilla films, I think the answer is clear: Yes, absolutely.",1157932800,3,1404,4.555555555555555
2103239,4,B0002LE8WS,"Oldschool Gamera is definitely classic kaiju, it just tends to have some of the worst aspects of kaiju built into its roots: annoying little kids, illogical stories, bad set designs, and plots that seem just a skeleton to justify monster fights. Good kaiju, on the other hand, tends to have characters that the viewer can indentify with, a sense of being overwhelmed by the size of the battles, a desperation for survival, allegory to real world problems, and monsters that, though they may be large and scary, are somehow sympathetic at the same time.

That is what I like about this new trilogy. It takes one of the more ludicrous monsters, a large turtle that walks on its hind legs, eats fire and uses atomic jets to propel itself, and gives it as a good of a treatment as I have ever seen a kaiju receive.

The first one has an excellent story, and a great old school ""King Kong"" kind of feel to it. The second one, which seems to either be the favorite or the most hated depending on who you ask, takes the story a step up (in my opinion) and adds a level of desperation that somehow was lacking in the first one. The fight scenes and effects are improved, though the sense of adventure and human interaction is weakened and the almost add-on moral from the very end seems out of place. The last one is probably the best, and I feel it is such because the story line brings the monster-to-hero so epitomized in the original Gamera idea full circle.

The effects are excellent by kaiju standards (which are still lacking by what some people would want, but I loved them) and the storylines are still a little illogical. The new explanation for the origins is kind of better as far as making sense of the oddity that is Gamera, but not 100% satisfactory. The dubbing and the subbing are both excellent, and I love the fact that I can get wide-screened, well transferred dvds as opposed to the low quality ones with bad dubbing that are normally part of the genre. The features are not the best in the world, but were a nice addition (since I got the movies for the movies, the extras are just some additional icing).",1135296000,32,2120,4.4728682170542635

All-in-all a great buy. What a way for me to introduce Gamera to my children! Loved it, would recommend it to anyone.

Good story, very good fights, intelligent - if you can call such a movie intelligent and absolutely entertaining. DVD quality is good to very good and it is fun to watch the movies.

I recommend to start at Guardian of the Universe, The Legion and last Gamera 3 and you got the highlight. This is a trilogy of movies and I put them just the way they were issued. Gamera 3 is one of the best if not the best Kaiju movie I've seen and it beats the latest 'G' movies which are also very good but G3 is the best one I watched. Original Japanese sound track with subtitles included, translation OK.

Also interesting in G3 to watch the typical bullying in Japanese schools, pretty honest, pretty real.

Good stuff, my 100% recommendation, if you are into monster movies and like the Japanese style.

Not 5 stars, because of the relatively weak 'Legion' movie. 1 and 3 are great, 2 is weak.

I say that because sometimes the reviews are linked to several different versions of a film. This is NOT a review of the films themselves. That is what IMDB and other sights are for. This is a review of the disc and the transfer to the disk.
The films have 2 Japanese audio tracks and one English track each as well as English Subtitles for the Japanese language version. The subtitles are not intended for the English language version. If you play it that way the dialog and the Subtitles will not match. The reason I am giving it 2 stars is that the transfer to Blu-Ray has some problems. The film freezes and skips at several points, but the audio continues properly. I have had defective discs in the past and you can see the time counter stop or skip. That is not the problem here. The discs continue playing and the time counter continues properly, as does the audio. The disc is not defective, the transfer to the disc was flawed. It only happens a few times and doesn't affect the film, but it is annoying, and I find it unacceptable.
This version is from Mill Creek Entertainment. This is the first Blu-Ray I've purchase which was from Mill Creek but I have had problems with some Mill Creek DVDs in the past.",1519084800,2,1352,4.433734939759036
