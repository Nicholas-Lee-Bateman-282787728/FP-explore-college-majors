2190107,4,B0006OBPTA,"Ah, Karate Kid.  A good movie.  There were too many things given to the viewers in Karate Kid (part one) that they could make fun of - so people can't keep a straight face when mentioning the films.  It's too bad in my opinion:  Wax on, wax off;  the crane kick;  jacka--es even love to make fun of the character Mr. Miagi.

The first one was a good teen movie.  About a new kid in town, fresh in from Jersey, who develops a crush on a girl - but then the ex-boyfriend and his friends try to ruin the kid's life.  Not only do they ride motorcycles, but they also know karate.

Now, I liked part two better than part one.  I think it was the Okanowa setting (I hope I didn't spell that wrong), I really loved it.

Part three and four I did not enjoy.  Part three was made to look like more of a sequel to the original - than part two was.  It was a revenge story for the leader of the Cobra Kai (the bad guys in part one), it was very dishonorable, and a disgrace.  I did not enjoy it one bit.  It also made the character of Daniel look like he didn't learn anything in the first two films.

After part three's cash-in - it was silly to exploit the films any further, but then came ""The Next Karate Kid"".  Another story of a loner student.  I think part of the story was about nursing pigeons on a rooftop.  The movie was nothing but a marketing scheme.

Anyways, I wish that they sold the first two by themselves - in these new versions, for fans like myself who felt that parts three and four were trash.  But many people liked part three.  Sure, I like to root for the villian in movies - but that program's story was distasteful in my opinion.",1107216000,2,1646,4.090909090909091
2190108,4,B0006OBPTA,"The first 3 in the set are what every fan of the 80's genre of movies should have in their collection.  They are entertaining and exude that form that the 80's is so famously known for.  Elizabeth Shue is in the first one. The fourth is an entertaining addition to the first 3 done in the 80's.  I would reccommend this set to anyone who loves the karate movies of the 80's such as Bloodsport, which is also another great.",1106956800,,422,4.25
2190109,4,B0006OBPTA,"This collection set is a great news to all Karate Kid fans who haven't owned the complete four films yet. Even though there's not much extra features or fancy box set wrapping around them, I think the attractive low price for this 4-pack is the major factor for driving people's desire of ownership. About the films, both the I and II are the best in the series. The III is an average work. The IV is totally off, only Miyagi is from the original casts. About the DVD, unlike the disappointed 1.33:1 aspect ratio in the original Karate Kid I DVD, in this set all four films are republished in widescreen format for true collectors. I think this 4-pack is an excellent deal! Cann't wait to see.....Wax On, Wax Off, Sand the floor, and Paint the house.

2190110,5,B0006OBPTA,"I have waited for the release of the original Karate Kid in widescreen format for a long time.  It's about time that they released this to complete the set in complete widescreen format.  This series are excellent films that the entire family can enjoy.  There have been many clones, but nothing can top the original.",1102896000,,317,4.7272727272727275
2190111,5,B0006OBPTA,"What I don't know!  What are the aspect ratios of the discs in this set?  I believe KK1 was only previously released in Full-Frame 1.33:1 format.  And, the rest in Wide-Screen format!  So, is this just a re-release of the same?  Or, do we finally get all the movies in Wide-Screen?",1101772800,2,281,4.431372549019608

2190127,4,B0006OBPTA,"The good value is why I'm rating it 4 stars. Otherwise it would get 3 stars. The product is mediocre and I can't say that I'm too satisfied. The packaging is very flimsy. Most DVD set cases are made of thick cardboard. This is almost like paper. Plus it was made too wide for the DVD plastics and what winds up happening is the case gets crushed and creased along the spine during shipment. As for the movie quality, it looks as if they didn't make it genuinely widescreen, but rather cropped the film so you're losing the very top and bottom. Kind of cheap. As a final issue, I noticed there was a skip/freeze in the Karate Kid 1 DVD in between scenes right before Daniel goes on the date with the girl to the arcade. Seriously? All in all, it's still a good value for the very low price. But I wouldn't have paid more. Someone needs to make a high quality, cleaned up version of this trilogy.",1471824000,,894,4.264705882352941

I absolutely loved the movies! It's fun to relive the 80s and to bond with him over his childhood favorites!  We have watched and re-watched all of them over and over again. Now we are showing them to our kids and we are noticing that there are a lot of moral lessons within the Karate Kid movies.,1465776000,,455,4.044444444444444

It was weird to see a Menu screen when I popped in the DVD, I had the VHS version and so used to view it a lot I think I wore out the tape.  It was after I watched karate kid I wanted to start martial arts.  I'm glad I got the collection, now I'm able to have all the movies all in a small package.  I'm glad I bought this collection, a must have for all martial arts fans.",1390608000,,638,3.6814814814814816

2190222,2,B0006OBPTA,"This 3-disc set contains 4 Karate Kid films. All four films are in widescreen format. These were the feel-good movies of the 1980's. The first two films are available on Blu-ray now but this is the only set to contain the quadrilogy (the 2010 remake is not included). The Next Karate Kid wasn't quite as good though it did have Mr. Miyagi returning to coach a young girl. The picture and audio quality in this set is fairly good. The problem is that there aren't many extras overall (less than 2 hours) and none of the sequels get any treatment. If you own the original film already you aren't getting any added value here. Ultimately, this is the economy set for KK fans who want the quadrilogy in one set because the price is right. If you are only interested in the original you may consider purchasing it separately on the 2010 stand-alone Blu-ray (with the same extras included here). Those interested in at least two of the sequels will get their money's worth. The Karate Kid franchise deserves a deluxe Blu-ray with 6 hours of bonus supplements. These are 4 star films in a skimpy 2 star package.

2190238,5,B0006OBPTA,"The karate kid, this movie is a classic and the story all begin's with a boy, namely daniel larusso who lived in new jersey, rasita with his mom lucille larusso. When her husband died of unknown causes her and son move to Los angeles, where daniel starts to encounter problems fitting into school and dealing with a group of bullies who go by the names of tommy, jimmy, bobby, dutch and johnny who formed together go by the name of the cobra kai's, who are all best friend's and do karate together at the cobra kai dojo taught by the legendary sensai john kreese and take a disliking to daniel and from there bully him on a daily basis until one night an old man ""mr. miyagi"" who happens to be the apartment maintenance man saves daniel from a brutal confrontation. After saving daniel, mr. miyagi then teaches daniel the fundamentals of karate and that pretty much sets the tone for the first movie.
Karate kid part 2, practically picks of immediately where the original left off and starts of after the tournament, as the story progress mr. miyagi receives sad news of his father's death and leaves america to okinawa, japan where daniel learns the history of karate where unfortunately both daniel and miyagi encounter new rivals.
Karate kid part 3, well it kinda goes back to the original formula where daniel is still the all valley champion and has captured the eyes of an business man terry silver who seeks to get revenge on both daniel and mr. miyagi for what he believes have become the ruin of sensai john kreese's life and enlists the help of a new karate contender mike barnes.
Karate Kid part 4 - next karate kid, sees the departure of daniel larusso and a new story emerge as a new girl julie pierce who goes to a new school and encounters many problems with the outside world all around her as well as being anti social. Julie pierce soon starts attracting the attention of 2 boys, one of which is nice who want's to get know her and the other who acts like an ass and shows nothing but brawn to get her attention which later becomes lethal.
Overall review, the karate kid movies from part 1-2 are quite solid and sets the tone for the whole karate kid saga with daniel learning the basics and then in the sequel learn it's history which was great but sadly seemed to have drop the ball by the 3rd movie but still however gives an important lesson which was to keep a cool head under pressure and learn to pick your battles however by the time of the 4th movie my estimates was that the karate kid hype was already over. The karate kid part 4 was pretty much more or less a stand alone movie even though it had mr. miyagi in it didn't coarse in terms of the story line and pretty much was unbelievable at times like julie having a fight with man practically stronger than her in the final scene.
The karate kid box set would be an excellent product to own for yourself or the family it's good for people of all ages and is definitely a timeless classic that will never get out of style",1362355200,,3001,4.399280575539568

2190258,5,B0006OBPTA,"Hollywood is really running out of ideas. They tried to remake the Karate Kid movie and even used Jackie Chan but nothing is like the original.

I'm not going to rehash on the plots or anything like others do. Basically the first 3 movies are a mentor/student relationship that turns into a friendship. It's great for all ages with humor, drama, and a nice amount of Karate action.

The 4th movie, The Next Karate Kid was an embarrasement. It tries to bring the same quit witty humor and the audience of the first Karate Kid but also include females. Having a female ""Karate Kid"" was great but they producers really didn't do a great job with the plot, character developement or anything. If anyone has not seen the first 3 movies, they would really be lost as to Mr. Miagi (sorry about spelling) references to Daniel Son. The producers and writers also jump right into the movie with how he knows this particular woman and everything else. They do not even attempt to have some form of closure to what happen to Daniel Son or where he was.

The collection is great. If you are just looking for a good collection of the movies without a lot of extras, such as behind-the-scenes and such then this movie collection is for you. If you are wanting all the other extras, you may find them in a 2 disk set for each movie or another combo set. I like watching the movies more than I do about the behind the scenes. I don't mind some of the behind the scenes or deleted clips once in a while, I just don't like spending a huge amount of money for collections or multi-disk DVDs with them included. This was the perfect collection of the the original 3 and including the 4th movie which I did not like.

I give the collection a 5 star because it's all together in a great fashion. No mess, no waste, and no trouble getting the DVDs out or even knowing which movie is on which disk. Each disk is in it's own box. The only thing that I did not like about the 3rd DVD is that it's a double sided DVD with the 3rd and 4th movies; one on each side of the disk. I still give it a 5 star only because I also think the 3rd movie wasn't as great as the first 2 but most definately better than the 4th.",1325721600,,2184,4.242788461538462

Another problem I had was the third and forth film were on a double sided disc. They could've made a forth disc for the forth film....or put both films on one side. If there isn't any special features, there is plenty of room.

A pro is the price. For such a set, it's a deal. The karate kid was a classic that is still loved today. now the other films not so much but still enjoyable.

2190271,5,B0006OBPTA,"Well, I must say I do own the first three Karate Kid films. I never did get a chance to see the fourth one with Hilary Swank but I did hear it was the weakest of the series so I guess I'll skip it for now. I'll start with the first film which is of course the best one. It has a great plot. A teen-age boy named Daniel who is very kind-hearted and has a deep interest in karate relocates from New Jersey to California with his mom. This is where all the trouble begins!

He falls for a cute blonde named Ali who is the girlfriend of champion Johnny Lawrence who is the best student at the Cobra-Kai karate dojo. Oddly, Johnny is not exactly a traditional villian per-se like some of his friends seem to be. It basically is a love-triangle sort of situation. Obviously, Johnny has the edge as he is bigger and much more skilled than Daniel. But Daniel has a secret weapon that everyone soon finds out about. He befriends an elderly Japanese karate grandmaster and war hero named Mr. Miyagi. Mr. Miyagi is well aware of Daniel's situation and expresses to teach him all the tricks to defeat Johnny and his friends at a tournament which he sets up with Johnny's ruthless instructor, Kreese.

The second film takes place in Japan. Daniel takes a vacation with Mr. Miyagi and ends up not only learning about Japanese culture but fighting for his life as Mr. Miyagi's long-time rival and one time best friend, Sato along with his first-rated student challenge the two. This paves way for the third film with is again based on a tournament. In my opinion, this really should have been released after the first as it seems to be more of a direct sequel to the first than the second film was. It picks up where the first tournament ends. Kreese turns on Johnny for having lost to Daniel and starts to choke him. Mr. Miyagi jumps to Johnny's rescue which persuades Kreese to throw a couple of punches at him! However, Mr. Miyagi proves very elusive to hit and he ends up severely injuring both of his hands due to accidentally hitting two car windows instead. Mr. Miyagi has the opportunity to give Kreese a severe beating due to his handicap but decides to let him go and forgive him.

Kreese, humiliated and now without students opts to consider giving up karate. But his war-buddy and vicious karate instructor, Terry who is also his partner discovers the situation and vows to help Kreese put an end to Mr. Miyagi and Daniel's championship reign. He handpicks a great Cobra-Kai type martial artist named Mike Barnes. Terry makes Barnes a great offer providing he can defeat Daniel which persuades him to really attack Daniel with a viciousness that very much intimidates him. Daniel really wants to continue fighting in tournaments but Mr. Miyagi advises against it as he believes karate is more so for defending life and honor rather than his trophy! This forces Daniel to choose another instructor who happens to be Terry! Terry pretends to be his best friend and on his side but puts him through such physically demanding training that it drains Daniel and turns him into a vicious Cobra-Kai with an attitude.

He ends up mistreating Mr. Miyagi and breaking someones face in a street fight. Daniel finally sees he is being someone he's not and returns to Mr. Miyagi who finally promises to train him. I really did enjoy this one but I do agree with the other review on here that Mike Barnes didn't have the charisma of Johnny or even Chozen. In my opinion, they should have brought Johnny back to fight along side with Daniel getting revenge against Kreese for choking and mistreating him! Also, if you remember, he did sort of make amends with Daniel at the end of part 1 and Mr. Miyagi did save his life. It would have been really interesting to see how Mr. Miyagi would've trained Johnny.",1281052800,,3788,4.558002936857562

The villains are so extremely evil, it's very unsettling to watch.  You keep waiting for something good to happen, but it never does, until that last 3 seconds of the movie.. BUT, that doesn't even come close to fixing the extreme dilemma.  The team of villains, lead by an infinitely rich psychopath, end up with even more reason (not that they ever really had any reason in the first place) to continue torturing Daniel.  If you want to feel good after the movie, then stop after part 1 or 2.

2190293,4,B0006OBPTA,"This collection is definitely a must for fellow Karate Kid fans. It is the best collection out there at the moment. It's pretty satisfying but here's what i like to share (i won't discuss the films as everyone knows part 1 is the best, 2 is pretty good and 3 is a joke while 4 is a bonus):
Part 1 has the most bonuses, the best being the commentary from the cast and the featurette with new interviews which is interesting to watch, seeing they've all aged and still remember the project. It's not an awfully long feature but it's worth watching. Other than a couple of lame trailers, that's about it. Part 2 has a very short feature and trailers as well. Part 3 and 4 aren't even worth mentioning to be frank. The picture quality of part 2 isn't very good and at times the color is a bit disappointing.
One more thing, the packaging and the design of the collection is not very rewarding. I'm not talking about the cover on the front of the collection but the individual covers on the discs. See part 2 and you'll get it. The carton packaging is not very sturdy and could easily be torn.
But overall. the films are still fun to watch. It's a lot whole cheesier than it used to be, but at the price they're charging it's certainly worth a buy.

Btw, Pat Morita is a great actor. RIP Mr. Miyagi.",1225152000,,1294,4.281632653061225

Didn't realize that it was a young Hilary Swank playing the young girls part.  She did a great job, and Pat Morita is always wonderful!

2190312,5,B0006OBPTA,"When ""Karate Kid"" first showed up in theatres, ""Ghostbusters"" was right there in competition with it! My mom told my buddy and I that we had a choice of one or the other. Well, right away we said, ""Ghostbusters!"" We knew that the other movie was popular, but not this time. Well, a year or two after it was released, I spent the night at another friend's house, and ""Karate Kid"" was highly recommended. When my family moved, and Karate Kid II came to the theatres, we were in line for tickets! I always enjoyed it, and when I heard it was to be a box set, I decided to get the collection. Whether you get this for, ""Wax on, wax off!"", ""Paint the fence."", ""Finish him, Johnny!! Get him a body bag!"", or whether you just enjoy Miyagi, it isn't disappointing. But there are setbacks. All in all, I thought it was indeed a 5 star collection. Here are the movies, with some brief thoughts.

The Karate Kid: Well, this is where it all begins! This is where Daniel moves with mother (Ma) from New Jersey to California. This is where a young man finds a mentor in an older maintenance man named Miyagi. This is the beginning of a confrontation between Daniel and a gang called Cobra Kai. This is where Daniel learns the Karate that Miyagi knows to love. The great thing about this is indeed the special features. Lots of cast and crew interviews, from a section dedicated to the music composed by Bill Conti. If this was the first movie you saw Pat Morita in, and you were only ten, were you fooled into thinking that he was a Karate expert, and not simply a comedian?! This is the beginning, and it is a classic!

Karate Kid II: I personally thought this was just as good and the original. Miyagi goes to Okinawa for his sick and dying father, and Daniel joins him. As the subtitle states, ""The story continues,"" and Miyagi runs into an old foe, and Daniel confronts a whole new foe in the menacing nephew. Good story, lots of good stuff, great song by Peter Cetera to go along with it, (Glory of Love) and a movie that fans will love for years to come. Not as many special features, but still some good stuff.

Karate Kid III: Back from Okinawa, back in the States! Somebody is looking to get even with Daniel and Miyagi. A grudge match between masters is in the making, and Daniel faces a most ruthless opponent!  If you are looking for lots of fights, III definitely dishes them out! By now, the ending is rather obvious. Consider this to be Daniel, with an even bigger attitude. Miyagi's lessons in this are beyond tournaments and trophies, and much more valuable. No real special features in this.

The Next Karate Kid: Out with Ralph Macchio, in with Hilary Swank. Yuck! Ok, it wasn't too terrible. But there was nothing classic about it. Nothing I care to remember about this one really. There are some interesting scenes, but they fade away rather quickly. As the credits roll, you simply say, ""Oh well. That's that."" And then you put it away. Not a total loss. No real special features.

But hey, this is your collection. You can take it or leave it! It does have everything you could possibly want (or not possibly want) as fare as Karate Kid goes. For the most part, I really enjoy this collection!",1186963200,2,3202,4.437074829931973
2190313,5,B0006OBPTA,"if you have never seen karate kid, part of your life is missing.  just kidding.  that's going a little far, but it is a a great set.  the third wasn't as good as the first two though.  the 4th, with hilary, is good, too.",1179964800,,220,3.9318181818181817
2190314,5,B0006OBPTA,In my opinion all the Karate Kid DVD Movies are filled with action and entertainment. I like the actor Ralph Macchio. Would recommend this series to anyone who appreciates Martial Arts.,1174780800,,185,5.0

2190317,5,B0006OBPTA,"When my daughter and nephews started Karate class last fall, I bought the children these movies. I loved these when I was younger and they love them now. Their instructor will even refer to the movie when teaching; ""Do you remember in 'The Karate Kid' when he did this?"" etc. The kids have a better idea of what he wants from having watched the movie. Also, my daughter likes 'The Next Karate Kid' because that story is about a girl.",1168992000,,433,4.425
2190318,5,B0006OBPTA,"Ralph Macchio (""My Cousin Vinny"") stars in the first three ""Karate Kid"" movies, directed by John G. Avlidsen (""Rocky""; he directed the first three movies). Pat Morita (who won Best Supporting Actor for the first movie) stars in all four.

The first movie is a lot of fun, with the famous ""Wax on, wax off"" sequence. It is also the film debut of Elizabeth Shue. I loved the romantic subplot. The fight seequences are well-executed.

The second film starts going into dark territory, beginning with the aftermath of the competition that concludes the first film. Why Elizabeth Shue didn't return is a mystery to me, though I loved the new interest. Once again, the action scenes were top-notch. I love the song ""Glory Of Love.""

The third movie is easily the darkest in the entire series. Cleverly edited clips from the first two movies serve as the prologue to this

""Revenge Of The Sith""-style installment. The best one yet. They keep getting better and better. The acting in all three is awesome.

The fourth movie was a let-down, despite a break-out performance by Hilary Swank (who would later win two Best Actress Oscars for ""Boys Don't Cry"" and the Clint Eastwood-directed drama ""Million Dollar Baby"") and another strong performance from Morita. The direction was God-awful. (John G. Avlidsen didn't direct; I don't know why). The script, which was not written by Robert Mark Kamen (who created the character and wrote the scripts for the first three hits), lacks the empathy and emotional punch of the first three, though no fault of Ms. Swank. All three movies are rated PG for some violence and mild language.",1166227200,,1617,4.865454545454545
2190319,3,B0006OBPTA,The films are entertaining for kids and adults alike.  One very disappointing thing is that there is no indication that all the formats are wide screen.  There is nothing on the packaging or the description ot the item.,1165017600,,219,4.7368421052631575
2190320,5,B0006OBPTA,"Wow what an amazing collection.  The first two movies are definately amoung some of the best movies ever made in my opinion.  The third and forth are lacking a little bit, but for the price, this collection is a MUST BUY!!!!",1163203200,,224,4.439024390243903
2190321,5,B0006OBPTA,"The Karate Kid is probably one of the best teenage underdog stories that I have seen. The story was excellent, and Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita brought such chemistry to the unique relationship between Daniel and Mr. Miyagi. Actually, the entire cast in this movie was excellent - Randee Heller was superb as Daniel's mom, and even the actors with smaller parts brought credibility to this movie. I still get chills at the end of this movie. The extras on this DVD were a nice touch as well.

The Karate Kid II is the less inspired sequel, but it still has some of the magic from the first one. The third installment was a bit strained - how many different groups of individuals are going to torment Daniel (on two different continents no less), but it is still worth watching.

The Next Karate Kid was, in my opinion, uninspired and made me miss the magic of Daniel and Miyagi's relationship.

Overall, this four disc set is a must-have for any fan of this series. The movie is a timeless classic that can be enjoyed by adults and children alike.",1150675200,,1047,4.529100529100529

It's funny, when these movies came out, I did my best not to watch them because I was already a teenager and the Karate kid was this dorky younger teen for whom I didn't have any sympathy.  Now that I am older, I see the real value in these movies.  The boy went from being a self-absorbed ""I'm so cool"" dork, to learning the meaning of self-respect and dignity, while in the process earning the respect of others.  This four-movie set is definitely worth the price if you value these personal traits.  As a bonus we got to see the fourth movie which I hadn't seen before.",1140739200,,742,4.226950354609929

There isn't maybe a karate championship in most kids futures, but it opens the door to talking about being a new kid or a kid that is the target of bullies. Also, it is a sweet, happy ending film that gives a glimpse of Japan and you can watch it without worry as it is family friendly.",1128038400,2,441,4.1395348837209305
2190332,4,B0006OBPTA,I think it is a great set I like Karate Kid but having Karate Kid part 3 and the next Karate Kid on the same DVD is not a good idea because at least on mine Karate Kid part 3 works but the next Karate Kid does not work it works for about 5 minutes and then it goes fuzzy and does not get normal again,1127952000,3,300,3.5606060606060606
2190333,3,B0006OBPTA,"You've already seen the movie, why should I bother reviewing it?  So how bout the special features then.

Commentary......Kinda disappointed in this. Everybody's joking around so much and talking over each other that it wasn't that great. But Ralph came off REALLY great, he actually seemed to know more about the technical aspect than Avildsen! He still really cares about the film, has collectibles from the set, and remembers a lot about locations and rehearsals.

Pat has that slurred laugh, and conflicting information to everyone else. And if I have to hear him say how ""cute"" Ralphie is one more time, puke.

Kamen and Avildsen were smart as.ses, who once in awhile would shut up and say how great a scene was. These four guys really loved this film.

The interviews were really well done. Ralph, Pat, Avildsen, Kamen, Kove, Zabka, Pat Johnson and Conti. Plus some GREAT behind the scenes footage interspersed with the interviews. Home video and 16mm shots of the beach fight rehearsal and Kreese's screentest. Some good stills of Pat and Ralph laughing during the dojo scene.

The widescreen transfer is great. Vivid and crisp, like it was filmed today. Though often times they got commentary wrong. Like the apartment building is NOT torn down. It still stands today in Reseda.

Disappointed in the cheap cases, slimline junk. But if you have a three dvd regular case lying around....

And NO sequel stuff! Sure, I didn't expect a commentary, but they don't even talk about it in the interviews! The interviews say Part 1 and Part 2...this is because they broke the KK 1 interviews into two parts??? Who knows why.

Hopefully someday we'll get commentaries, but not likely of course. Dying to know how they'd all four talk about KK3.",1127779200,,1742,4.877966101694915

2190337,5,B0006OBPTA,"I was finally told last week that you could get all of the karate kid movies in one set packed with special features. When I was told this, I hugged the kid working and tipped him $20 bucks for the information. Needless to say, I bought it and was blown away by the purchase price. These are worth at least $150 to me. Let me try to put into words how incredible it is to have these four movies in one collection. I like to eat fried appetizers. This box set is the equivalent of putting breaded cauliflower, breaded mushrooms, fried cheese sticks and chicken tenders on one platter with all of your favorite sauces. The only way to review this is one by one. I spent the entire holiday weekend watching these films a total of 26 times(I watched 1 and 2 nine times to just eight for part 3. I'll explain part four later).

Part 1- The best of the best of the best. Ralph Macchio was brilliant in the outsiders and someone in hollywood saw that film and went,""I've got this teen karate movie script and you need to get me Macchio."". Well, they got Macchio and magic was born. I still don't know what angered the Cobra Kai so much about Daniel San, but they just flat didn't like the Jersey kid. I guess I understand a bit because Bon Jovi's attitude kind of rubbed me the wrong way. So he's getting beat up left and right until the Maintenance Man with off the charts karate skills wipes out all of the cobra Kai at once. Anyway, Daniel does chores and in a week or so is a Karate machine himself. He pretty much has to take out the whole Cobra Kai by himself, one at a time, include the black Cobra Kai kid played to perfection by the great Larry B. Scott(Lavar from Revenge of the Nerds). I won't give away the ending but let's just say you won't try that with your girlfriend!!

Part 2- Daniel has the respect of everyone in town, but still no friends so he goes to Japan with Myagi. Guess what, more trouble. Some kid in Japan evidentally doesn't like Daniel San either and wants to kill him. What you, the viewer, will realize in this film is that this is not tournament, this real life. Daniel falls in love with a spicy little asian number and helps save people from hurricanes. It all comes down to a showdown between Daniel and Japan karate kid and I won't give away the ending again, but you'd better finish that laundry!!!

Part 3- Some people really keep a grudge. Evil Sinsay John Creese of the Cobra Kai is still hacked off that the gangly dork with no friends from New Jersey beat the tar out of all of his guys including Larry B. Scott. Even Dutch got his butt handed to him by Daniel San. Creese's plot for revenge involves a mean karate champ(who seriously would kill Daniel san in real life) and a rich guy with nothing to do. I think the toughest part to watch in the whole four part series is when the karate bully and his friends break Daniel's bansai tree. Daniel cries, his chick cries, and yes, I cry. It's tough to make it through. Well if you want to tick off Daniel San, screw with his bansai tree. It's go time!! I won't give away the ending but let's just say this was Ralph Macchio's last karate kid movie!!

Part 4- I don't know why this one was put in the box. The chick that plays the girl that pretends to be a boy is supposedly the Karate kid. I took it back to target and asked why Ralph Macchio is not in the fourth movie. He claimed not to know and made fun of me to a coworker. For whatever reason, Macchio was not in this picture in the box set I bought. Hopefully he's in the one you buy. I didn't watch this one.",1120521600,4,3554,4.214390602055801
2190338,5,B0006OBPTA,"Ok, so let me start off by saying yes, this movie can be KORNY at times, this is one of those movies that if you watched them when you were a kid, you'll charish these movies for your life! I just love this movies soo much, maybe not the Next Krate Kid so much, but all of them send a STRONG message. I will always love these movies. I couldn't say enough about them, I am a BIG martial arts movie fan, no matter how KORNY they might be. Yes including 3 Ninjas and TMNT. Anyway, many people might not understand why people like these movies so much, but like i said you really have to be watch these as you were a kid, or its hard to understand why we LOVE this movies!

2190339,4,B0006OBPTA,"So, it is a 3 disc set, not a 4 disc set.  The first disc actually contains the first movie, plus the behind the scenes stuff.  The second disc has just the second movie, and the third disc has the last two movies (I bet they couldn't sell very many of the 4th movie separately, that's why they put it on the same disc as the 3rd movie).

I have always loved the karate kid movies, and I was not happy that they weren't available anywhere.  So, when I found the set online for such a reasonable price, I jumped at the chance of getting them.

They are classic 80's movies, about a boy coming of age, and finding his own straight path in a crooked world, with the help of a wise older man.  I loved Pat Morita in these movies, he does such a good job of being a mentor, combining the fun, with the work, with the humor.  When I was younger, I had a crush on Ralph Macchio - oh, was he cute!

All in all, a worthy set of movies!",1118102400,3,926,3.9675675675675675

But it's also said here that III and The Next KK are compressed into one double-sided disc. So what does the other remaining disc contain? Hope someone can help me.

2190341,5,B0006OBPTA,"While some critics dismiss ""The Karate Kid"" as a 1980s teen movie, I place it in the same category as such classics as ""Star Wars"", ""Rocky"" and ""Jaws.""  It is a beautifully-written, -acted and -directed film that pulls at your heartstrings and makes you cheer.  Pat Morita's Mr Miyagi (for which he received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor) is one the archetypal characters in American film.  His relationship with Ralph Maccio's Daniel LaRusso is as genuine and touching as any you will find in film.  I remember seeing it in the theater when I was very young and the audience exploding into applause at the final ""crane kick"" scene.  That does not happen very often.

The DVD of the entire series is now available (Part 2 is decent but Parts 3 and 4 are not).  The best DVD feature is the making-of documentary.  It's been 21-years since this film was in theaters and all the major contributors are still alive and in good spirits for the documentary.  Everyone involved in the project sees this movie as the pinnacle of their careers (and I agree with them).

This is one of my favorite films.  I give it my highest recommendation.",1110067200,28,1148,4.661691542288557
2190342,4,B0006OBPTA,"I got a copy of The Karate Kid Special Edition Box Set the very second it was released. I must say I had the most enjoyable experience listening to that commentary! I was laughing so much along with the cast and crew. It was very special for me to hear Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita discussing this film 20 years after it first hit theaters and warmed it's way into our hearts. I have loved this movie for 20 years straight. I was a Ralph Macchio fanatic at 8 years of age and I still think this is such a fantastic movie. The DVD is superb. The commentary is the number one feature. It's informative, interesting, and highly entertaining. There are a few featurettes that are enjoyable as well. No deleted scenes though! And where the heck was Elisabeth Shue during the making of this? Oh well, other than that I reccommend anyone who loves this movie to pick up this new box set. As an added bonus you get the other three lesser sequels. I myself have never been a fan of any of them, but it's good to have them as part of the collection. Two huge karate kicks up! :)",1109721600,2,1068,4.266009852216749
2190343,5,B0006OBPTA,"I just finished watching these films over the last week for the first time in years. This set is a must buy for anybody who has kids dealing with bullies. These are films that anybody alive can relate too with the trust in yourself message and fighting only as a last resort. Its also a wonderful take on Karate as an art and a spiritual excercise and not a form of violent fun that allows you to kill a man by ripping his heart out.
 The first film is hands down the best. Very sweet and full of wonderful human emotions. The seconed film is a decent sequal with pretty well the same qualities as the first but in a different local and the characters are a little older. The third is kinda silly with the revenge angle but I have seen worse. The last a latest remake stars the 2 time Oscar winner Hillary Swank in her break out role. Very much like the first but not quite as charming like the first three but hey a decent try none the less. The fourth film does have the best scene in the whole series. The scene is when the monks go bowling which is cheezy but funny.
The only gripe I have with the collection is the lack of extras. The first film had great extras but the seconed film had a making the sequal featurette but its 5 mins long and from 1986. It felt they didn't put to much thought in beefing up the last 3. They could have attempted to get Hillary Swank for a sit down retrospect on the next Karate Kid but nope. Other then that this set is a must buy that won't dissappoint fans young and old.",1109548800,2,1512,4.125423728813559
2190344,5,B0006OBPTA,"I'm not going to go into a review for this film... plenty of people before me have explained what the movie is about and why it is good.  All I have to say is that I went to Target tonight looking for nothing in particular, and I happenstance came across this in the box-set dvd section.  The last time I watched the Karate Kid, it was on VHS, and it was years ago. But when I saw the ENTIRE set on DVD... my friend can tell you. I stopped, started sputtering, pointing... finally I managed to get out, ""Dude! Dude! Dude! ... HOLY! DUDE. OH MY GOD. DUDE!!! The Karate Kid! I love this movie! This is the whole reason I took karate in the first place! I wanted to be Daniel-san! And then I WAS Daniel-san! And I kicked ass!!""

My friend couldn't stop laughing.

Anyway. I just wanted to say that Karate Kid is the good stuff. The ""believe in yourself, never give up, find the courage to face the darker moments of life"" stuff. Every body needs a little bit of Daniel-san in them.

I wish I had some sake so I could salute Mr. Myagi.

2190345,5,B0006OBPTA,"Finally, all the movies together in a single package.  I have been enthralled with the Karate Kid since seeing the first one back in 1984.  I think I am in a rare minority here in that I actually like all four of the movies, one and two still having a higher preference though.  The biggest reason I like all four is without a doubt because of the depth of character of Mr. Miyagi.  I remember my first Sensei talked almost the same way, which was a big deal to me when I first saw Karate Kid since he did this before the popularity of the movie.  This for some reason had a profound and lasting effect.  I read somewhere the Pat Morita built most of the Miyagi character on the fly and I think he did an awesome job of this throughout all the movies.  The continuing philosophy and mentality throughout all four movies alone was well worth the price.  Of course my wife and kids are getting insanely tired of me quoting Mr. M.

2190346,5,B0006OBPTA,"The Karate Kid movies are the defining moments of a great era -- the 1980s. The first movie is definitely the best one, in all regards. A great script, solid direction, and memorable performances make the movie the best in the series. Plus, the score is extremely inspiring and moving, throughout the entire film. In my opinion, the actor who steals the movie is William Zabka, who plays Johnny Lawrence. There's a really funny humor article that interviews Johnny Lawrence to see what he's doing these days. You can read that here: [...] Anyway, I definitely recommend these movies to anybody. This is a great collection.",1109030400,2,622,4.877358490566038
2190347,5,B0006OBPTA,"What can I say that no one else has? Nothing really, but in my opinion I loved Karate Kid Part 2 the most. Don't get me wrong though I thoroughly loved Karate Kid Part 1...I mean that was how it started.

 You know, single mother; who is struggling to make ends meat, just moved from Jersey to Cali (huge move, and very different in culture) a son who is paltry, very street looking, has the hots for ultra cute rich girl with vindictive ex-boyfriend. Son meets old asian man who teachs him Karate to defend himself so he wins girl, wins Karate tournament, wnis our hearts. And why not?

We all get tired of not hearing that the good guy underdog won everything.

 But in Part 2 it is not just about old style fight for the girl style Martial Arts. In Part 1 Mr. Miyagi explains that Karate helps train you for life, and in Part 2 it is about how Daniel has to deal with Mr. Miyagi's troubled past, coming to grips with his breakup with his girlfriend and his own fight for life, and how he can do this and not lose his life.

 He fights for honor now, not for a trophy, and that is the message. Life is not all about bullies and girlfriends, it is about love for friends, sacrifice, and the next phase of life.

Oh yeah there is something about a Part 3 and a Part 4 but those one's don't really count...DO THEY?",1108944000,2,1313,4.182539682539683
2190348,4,B0006OBPTA,"I absolutely love the Karate kid trilogy. It's actually what got me into martial arts in the first place. 1, 2, and 3 are pure heart and brilliance in my opinion. The beggining, the journey and the return. Part 2 is my favorite simply because its the only one I owned as a child which I recorded off of TV during Hurricane Hugo in th 80's. Which is quite Ironic if youve seen the second part. Now that the movies are DVD we can all enjoy the great movies of our younger years, as well as extra features whcih I couldn't believe.

2190352,5,B0006OBPTA,"Part I (5 stars): Funny, I'm just not a big ""karate buff"", in fact, this probably is the only set of movies like this I own, or may ever own. When I tell people this is one of my favorite movies *ever*, they laugh. Then they say, ""Are you serious?"" And my words to explain why always fall short. Beyond the karate, beyond the underdog nature, there lie two characters that seem to compliment each other so perfectly it really makes the movie what it is regardless of the subject matter. Something about the chemistry between Pat Morita and Ralph Macchio simply defies convention and thrives on it. The casting by all involved was surely just one part luck, one part fortune, the DVD extras merely icing. My only complaint is this not being mastered to 5.1 DD sound.

*edit* I watched the commentary last night and I must say I was disappointed. Pat Morita's input was intrusive, and many comments made by the group were simply uncalled for. When Elizabeth Shue would walk away from the camera they would comment about her rear end and totally ruined a part of my respect for them. They went on to ridicule an ""extra"" who became a greeter of some sort. They laughed and carried on through the whole thing. At the beginning I thought, well they are a lively group, but after 45 minutes it wore thin and I wished then I would have turned it off. There were a few bits here and there I learned, but what I really learned is why companies have the disclaimer at the beginning of the movies.

Part II (4 stars): I'm kind of ashamed of avoiding this movie now. As much as I loved the first I never bothered with the second. I've just never been fond of sequels. Be it Back to the Future Two, the Lost World, or the hundred other sub par sequels, they just seem to mar the original product. However, here at Amazon I read that this story picks up 5 minutes after the first and that peaked my interest. Previously, I just assumed it would be directionless swill. So wrong. The score, the heart, the soul, and even the casting practically live up to the first, and I'm shocked at that. In fact Daniels love interest in this even out does the first!! Having the impact on me this film had 19 years after it was made is quite remarkable. It's not without it's flaws though, the last 15-20 minutes really just seemed to lose steam, the ""storm"" sequence being almost painful. Sad that there are no extra's to speak of, this movie may have been even more interesting to hear about.

Part III (3 stars): Definitely the weakest of the three, still a must see for the simple fact that Pat and Ralph still have that spark. Sadly, the casting choices for the villains are overwrought and the story just seems forced. I suppose the concept was losing its impact but regardless, the script just wasn't well thought out. Again, this picks up right after Part II and there is just something about this continuity that makes me think John Avildsen has courage and vision. The weakest part of the script easily being the ""sign the paper"" portions that defied common sense, still like Part II I'm simply shocked these movies are not disastrous ""1 out of 5's"" (as some here at Amazon alluded to) although having the original director onboard surely meant these movies had the stability they needed... and deserved. Having viewed Parts II and III has forever altered the way I will view Part I, and I'm relieved to report it's all for the better. They only enhanced what I knew and make me appreciate it that much more. Why not have commentary on all three movies?

---

The Next Karate Kid (2 stars): I'm trying to view this as a sort of ""bonus movie"" within the packaged set. While 2 stars may seem low I think this movie does contain some decent performances by Hillary and Pat. The problem again is the script, hell, even the premise. So, a middle aged woman lets a friend of her fathers move in with her teenage daughter while she goes and stays at his home California? Please. A big problem are the overzealous sadistic ""TV Movie"" quality of just about everyone except the two leads. Even the love interest in this is so utterly flat it is totally deflated. Most of what should have had an impact (like the Hawk) didn't and a certain parts (like ""Zen"" bowling) seemed like embarrassing filler.",1107907200,74,4270,4.4903474903474905

Or if you're not like me you're buying this because you're a big fan of ""The Next Karate Kid""!!!  Seriously though the main appeal of this set for me was to get the first film in widescreen. I wasn't however, expecting the running commentary to be as fun as it is. Ralph Macchio, Pat Morita and the director and the writer are all on hand to provide insight. What makes the commentary so great is that unlike some commentaries they are able to laugh at certain scenes and point out things that even they thought were unbelieveable (the scene with the bottles on the truck). Morita and Macchio clearly formed a strong bond making the movies and their admiration for one another shows in the commentary. Since it is the first film that will be the draw here, that is the disc with all the bells and whistles. The other three films have no extras to speak of. By now everyone knows the story of Daniel and Mr. Miyagi and the powerful friendship they build. I was 13 when the first film came out and watching it again after 20 years it still packs a punch or should I say a kick! You'll want this set for the first film and maybe the second.

2190358,4,B0006OBPTA,"There are only a handful of movies that I associate with my youth while growing up in the 80's.  ""The Karate Kid"" was definately one of them.  By taking a seemingly cliched premise about the student being taught by the master to avenge his honor, the filmmakers were able to inject a lot of warmth, humor and heart into the movie to make it an entirely unforgettable film.  Unfortunately, the sequels (as they rarely do) never lived up to the original with the fourth one (starring a young Hilary Swank) being a parody of itself.  But rather than bore you with inane details as to what I loved and hated about each film, I will describe the special features, which is the only reason to put up with the last two sequels.  A treat for ""The Karate Kid"" fans is a forty-five minute documentary on the filmmaking process from its origins to the final cut.  It was great seeing Ralph Macchio, Pat Morita, Martin Kove (Kreese) and William Zabka (Johnny) as they are today, describing their experiences while making the film.  Hearing Kove admit that his initial dislike for the director helped him to channel his character's anger was great. The ""East Meets West: A Composer's Notebook"" and ""Life of Bonsai"" featurette were basically fillers and only added trivial information about the film.  However, I was a little disappointed that the same amount of features weren't found on ""The Karate Kid, Part II,"" nor the other sequels, as bad as they were.  But it's the first film that I hold close to my heart and with the great features and affordable price, the collection is well worth the price.",1107388800,6,1590,4.670250896057348

Part 3 is a movie you can watch over and over again, because it is so damn funny. Part 2 has a couple good parts, part 4 is garbage. They need to make a part 5 with Daniel back in it. Remember, Cobra Kai never dies!!!!!!!",1107216000,,321,3.878787878787879
