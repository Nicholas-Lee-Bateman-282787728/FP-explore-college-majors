5708234,1,B00C9VZ73S,My daughter was so excited about this movie but the movie turned out to be low budget and cheap! she watched it once and now wants nothing to do with it! I recommend saving your money and renting it it!,1372809600,2,202,4.075
5708235,2,B00C9VZ73S,"What can I say if it weren't for my 8 year old I'd never have purchased this movie.  I was told the music was good, like it was in the McKenna movie.  But it's not, what bothered me most was that the film was completely different than the books.  Saige's dog doesn't exist, her new friend Gabby is into art not animal training.  I could go on and on.  Then there were the horse riding scenes, close up of actor bouncing cut to far away of stand in riding horse.  And they kept doing this over and over, then during the parade scene the film is shot through streamers.  It was so annoying to watch and felt like an amateur film festival.  Oh but they saved the best for last, the girls all get on the hot air balloon it looked like it was cut and pasted the green screen was so awful.
Do yourself a favor and rent this my copy will be in my next garage sale, there are barbie movies with better acting.  The Saige books are some of the worst American Girl has written and the movie managed to make it worse.",1372723200,9,1006,4.091836734693878

5708247,4,B00C9VZ73S,we watched this movie and thought : wow this girl is terribly advanced for only 9 years old and actually looked more about jr high school also. She could paint better than most adults. It was all in all a good movie.,1468368000,,216,4.166666666666667
5708248,1,B00C9VZ73S,The DVD skipped and did not work. Said made in Mexico on the disc. Where is the quality control? This was bought for my daughters bday.,1467936000,,135,4.230769230769231
5708249,3,B00C9VZ73S,"While i found this character to be the most annoying of all the AG characters, my 9 yr old daughter loved this movie and watched it over and over until it drove me nuts just listening to it. I finally had to take it off my kindle or go crazy.",1465689600,,242,3.86
5708250,1,B00C9VZ73S,"Yeah, I'm an adult, but not only do I like a lot of kids' movies (I still enjoy freakin' Babysitters Club books for their unintentional hilarity and snarkability), I also have a daughter.  She lost interest in this movie very, very quickly, which isn't a good sign.

Now.  I've only seen a couple AG movies so far, and the protagonists' families so far have always been obscenely wealthy.  I was able to overlook it in Isabelle's movie (the point of that was about learning to work hard for success in ballet), but in this one, it's not forgivable.  I think this movie would have worked marginally better if Saige had found out a school with mostly poor kids was losing their art program, and so she decided to try raising the money to keep their art classes in place.  Instead we've got a movie starring an extremely rich kid and her mind-blowingly rich friends complaining about not having free art classes in their school.  Yes, art should be in school, but when it's a movie about kids who live on horse ranches and the families own hot air balloons, and the star's grandmother is a successful artist on top of it, you lost sympathy.  These aren't kids whose only chance at art is in school.  These are kids whose school has dance classes and whose families can give them private lessons.  I'm not going to feel bad for the rich kids.  I feel bad for poor kids who don't have other art in their lives.  This movie would have worked better if Saige had found out a poor school l was losing art, and so did what she could to help that school.  Since this takes place in around ALBUQUERQUE, of all places, there are plenty of poor schools to focus on helping.  But this Albuquerque is a small-town rich fantasy where all the poverty and brown people have disappeared to be replaced by extremely wealthy white horse ranchers with in-home art studios (really).

Moving on.  Saige is told her school needs $5k to keep art.  In their out-of-touch world, an art teacher's salary is less than that.  Gotta buy supplies too, unless supplies come from thin air.  So now we have kids learning that a year of art only costs $5k.  Saige decides to host a fundraising concert.

Saige and her friends, who, by the way, all dress like teenagers complete with full faces of make up when they're supposed to be 9 years old and their hair all done up for everything they do (to disclose: I'm not against letting little kids have some light makeup, and my 6-year-old loves a little sparkly shadow, but little kids shouldn't be in everything from eyeliner and shadow to cheek highlighter and lip stains, with perfectly coiffed and styled hair, just to go to school), manage to rent a venue, write original professional harmony and choreograph dance numbers, all professionally, hire lighting people, commission massive backdrops with screens that allow fancy lighting through at key moments, pay for custom costumes, etc., all to the surprise of all the adults in town.

Seriously they spent more than $5k on that concert and to hire the professional lighting people.  Where did those CHILDREN get the money to put on that show, and who hired the professionals it would have taken, and who signed the contract to rent that venue?  Why not put that money, EASILY at least $15,000, into the program instead of using it to try raising $5k?  Of course they did it in the end, after Saige appealed to the uber rich to keep the art classes she loves so much (her little speech got a massively loud standing ovation with lost of tears).  They're looking at a net loss though.  Spending $15k or more to raise $5k.

After the announcement that they raised the $5k and can pay a teacher below-poverty wages, the families in town celebrate by going up in their custom hot air balloons, at least one customized with one of Saige's designs.  Balloons aren't painted.  They're extremely large pieces of silk sewn in a manner similar to quilts.  They're about $100,000 each, and every family, EVERY FAMILY owns some.  Had to beg people in a town that rich to donate $5k to a school, which most large businesses will do in a fell swoop.  It's a tax write-off, and businesses look for those to lower their taxes.

I really wanted to love this movie, especially because Dr. Quinn (Jane Seymour) is in it, but there's nothing to redeem it.  It's not even snark-worthy.  This movie is just plain bad, out of touch, and insulting on so many levels.  I'm glad I saw it on Netflix instead of buying it.",1465344000,3,4461,4.587121212121212

5708257,5,B00C9VZ73S,"Saige is a 10 yr old painter following in the footsteps of her Meme (grandmother). She is shy smart creative but not vary outgoing. She has three outlets she relies on to express herself, her best friend Tess, her art, and Meme. Now school has cut the rt program. Her best friend Tess has found a new friend that takes a lot of her time and Meme takes a fall so she isn't acting right either. As her whole world crashes down around her she strives to overcome her shyness and reach out to get the help she needs to put it back right again. Enter Gabby (another art lover) the one bright spot in this year, but as Saige clings to the past it drives a wedge in their relationship too. When the smoke clears will anything worth keeping be left? Will it be a bland artless world? What you think I'm going to give away the story!? Watch it and see.",1454371200,,843,4.177914110429448

Etc.  These movies are age-appropriate and enjoyable for my girls to watch.  My oldest daughter loves the historical or cultural information she learns from the movies and books and my little one enjoys hanging out with her dolls while she watches.

5708274,1,B00C9VZ73S,"I've loved American Girl since I was young, and now that I have an 8 year old daughter of my own, it's something that we really enjoy together. I missed this particular 'Girl of the Year' when she came out, but after reading her bio I thought I would really like this movie. It was really terrible. We've seen almost all of the other AG movies, and this is definitely the worst. I absolutely agree with other reviewers that this entire plot is completely ludicrous. Also, that the production these 10 year olds put on would have cost several times what they were trying to raise on just the lighting package alone. I thought American Girl was supposed to motivate young girls to do their best and explore their talents, not give them insanely unrealistic expectations that they could never achieve. Huge disappointment. We won't be watching this again.",1440374400,,852,4.724832214765101

5708276,1,B00C9VZ73S,"I watched this movie as part of a marathon to help entertain my daughter while she had to stay home sick from school. So, it's safe to say we watched every American Girl movie that's out there.

I'm really trying to be nice about this but the movie is awful. The acting is poor (there was a crying scene when Saige and another girl are arguing, the ""crying"" was so bad that even my 5 year old could tell it was fake), the story makes no sense (for all the reason other reviewers have said), and it's just boring. We lost attention and couldn't even push through to see the end. This was my least American Girl movie.

Not worth buying the DVD and not worth the rental price. I believe YouTube has the full version and that's a better way to go if you want to see it.",1440115200,2,766,4.134228187919463

5708282,2,B00C9VZ73S,I found this not too be one of American Girls better movies.  It was hard to get through but being a fan of Jane Seymour's I had to try.  Plus I was previewing it for my nieces.  They will not be watching it anytime soon.  I felt that the story line and clothes showed more of a high school look than an elementary one.,1437350400,,319,3.9375

The character that Jane Seymour plays goes from being a vibrant 60 year old to an infirm 80 year old after breaking her arm and wrist. I am assuming the director must be very young because this is insulting to older women and wrong. They have her hooked up to an IV before they put her in the ambulance. That is just silly. Saige is very annoying, and I told my daughter that if she ever acted that way, I would be very disappointed. The parents do no parenting. The girls are supposed to be in the 4th grade (9 years), but the girls they cast are clearly much older 13. That is really unrealistic. I regret having wasted $2.99 on this.

I was curious to see it since Jane Seymour is in it, but her character was less remarkable than I had hoped.  There is beautiful scenery and some wonderful art in this film, but Saige seems a bit less resilient than other American Girls.  Overall, a wholesome, cute movie, but not as inspired as McKenna with her gymnastics and school troubles or Isabelle with the pressure of dance and trying to keep up with a ""perfect"" older sister.  Seymour's talents seem quite wasted in this movie, although the actress that plays Saige does pretty well.",1409443200,,675,4.694915254237288

5708358,1,B00C9VZ73S,"This movie is hard to watch.  We've purchased all of the American Girl movies for my 7 year old daughter, and this one is the only one that we don't like.  Really bad acting.  We aren't  critical of children's movies, the bad acting jumps out and distracts you from the story.  My daughter was the one to point it out first (I was holding my thoughts in so that I wouldn't ruin it for the 7 year old).  This is the only American Girl movie that she lost interest in the first viewing.

The story is also unrealistic, predictable, and all around lame.  The community is clearly middle class America, there shouldn't be a budget issue with art class, and if there was an issue coving a $5,000 program than Saige should have pushed for some real estate taxes on the million dollar properties that these families live in.  Compared to the issues that Molly, Kit, Felicity, Chrissa deal with, Saige is just a cry baby.  This movie makes you question where American Girl is going... I think they've sold out and are trying to increase short term profits by shaping their product to match the market instead of trying to positively influence and educate America's girls.",1401235200,2,1163,4.57487922705314

5708363,5,B00C9VZ73S,I have seen some negative reviews but this is not about my critical opinion (or comparison to any other AG movies).

5708373,1,B00C9VZ73S,"EVERYTHING about this movie was ridiculous, and I say this as a big fan of American Girl.

Compared to historical characters, these new characters really pale in comparison.  Felicity, Samantha, Kit, and Molly survived wars and the Great Depression, saved lives, death with the deaths of loved ones, fought child labor laws, and took in war refugees.  Saige's biggest issues are:
1.  Not getting school art classes.  What is she going to learn in a public school art class?  Making clay ashtrays?  Coloring with a coffee can full of broken crayon stubs?  Her grandma is a famous artist, and at the age of ten she already paints like Van Goh!
2.  Riding her grandmother's horse in a parade holding ribbons over her head.  Saige already knows how to ride and the horse has ridden the parade many times, so it's not like she's taming a mustang.  And, in the big parade scene in the movie, she's surrounded by four handlers who run (in cowboy boots!) alongside the horse.

The economics don't make sense, either.  The girls spend about $50,000 to earn $5,000 to save the school art program.  Who ever heard of a public school program costing $5,000?  $5,000 wouldn't cover the color copies the girls made to advertise their various money-making schemes.  And Disney can't put together a more professional stage show (which, curiously, is made up of only one number) than the one supposedly completely choreographed and staged by elementary school kids.

And the action scenes are hilariously awful; Saige and her grandmother look like their bouncing on chairs when the camera does close-ups of their faces while they are horseback riding, and in the scene where Saige and her father are riding in the basket of a hot air balloon the cloud scenery is painted and never moves, and you can see how the basket is held up by ropes and Saige's hair is blown by a fan.  And why is this insanely vibrant and active grandma - completely overacted by Jane Seymour - practically on her deathbed with a broken wrist and leg, when one scene before she's climbing ladders and riding horses?  And why doesn't Saige's billionaire daddy or world-famous granny pitch in the measly $5,000 to save the art program?  I could go on and on!",1391212800,15,2213,4.7434554973821985

5708390,2,B00C9VZ73S,"I have two daughters - 8 & 6, and we've seen many American Girl movies.  We found this one to be very disappointing.  The story line was unrealistic and the kids who were suppose to be in 4th grade behaved more like high schoolers.  One of the most unbelievable/confusing aspects of the movie was when Saige's grandma, a healthy women who rides horses, does stunts on the horse, climbs ladders and is full of life, suddenly trips over her dog and ends up in the hospital with a broken leg and arm.  Saige and everyone else seems to fear for her life and the grandma loses her will to live.  She ends up in a motorized wheelchair and has to have physical therapy to get her up again.  I felt like I missed something... she simply tripped... while walking on a flat surface???  Seemed a little far-fetched for me.  I kept thinking they'd explain that she'd had a stroke or a heart attack but no... she just fell down.  Then the girls - 4th graders, must have attended a special school or something because I'm a teacher and my kids are in elementary school and I've never seen 4th graders have so much freedom from coming and going, to spending time on their own in the music room and having a lunch period that resembles that of a high school lunch room.  The story didn't match the children's ages.  I'm usually not so critical about a movie but this one was poorly done in my opinion.  The main idea of the movie was a good one just poorly executed.",1388707200,,1450,4.349442379182156

I LOVE the historical movies and the wholesome alternatives they provide for my daughter who is five and already growing up too fast. I deplore the Disney shows geared for older kids (Jessie, etc.) and how they present kids acting bratty, disrespectful and rude to one another as well as to adults. I also detest watching little girls dressed like older teens and engulfed in materialism. Had I read the reviews for this movie I would NEVER have allowed my daughter to watch it. Thanks a lot, AG, for breaking our trust. You were the one company I thought I could count on to present positive messages to my daughters.

What fourth grader writes sings, and choreographs that kind of music?  Again, this would have been an okay movie if Saige was 14.

Showing a young girl overcoming her fears (of public speaking and performing in front of crowds) is a boost for young fans.

Great movie and helped my 7 year old talk about facing her fears.,1378166400,3,321,4.229508196721311
5708440,1,B00C9VZ73S,"My daughter has been patiently waiting to see this for weeks, and it took a thousand times more patience at fortitude for me to sit through this drivel.

Let's just forgive the fact that everyone in the cast is overacting, over-enunciating every line to the point of being comical, and that their facial expressions are glued on their faces. (Although I give them credit- they all have more expressions than Kristen Stewart...which would only have to be two.)  I'm letting this slide because nearly all kids' ""Hallmark"" style movies have bad acting and dialog.

My beef with this movie comes from the basic believability on all levels, and how this affects the target audience.

While watching the movie, I looked up the character's bio. The make-up, hair, clothes, allowance amount mentioned by Saige is all appropriate for a 14-15 year old. This girl is supposed to be 10.  If they had merely changed the age, I would have no problem with it.  Instead, they all look far too old and made up for their age, with FAR too much attention drawn to their appearance, and this is exactly what I felt safe knowing American Girl was NOT promoting.

Next, the ""talent"" aspect...These kids have abilities more in line with high schoolers.  My 10-year old daughter walked away from this movie feeling bummed out and disappointed that she and her friends have nowhere near the talent level of the girls portrayed in the movie. I tried to explain to her that this was NOT normal, that virtually NO elementary aged kids write songs with full harmony, play the guitar and the piano while they sing, and paint like that.  Maybe this wasn't an issue for all girls, but when you're at that awkward preteen age where you already feel like you don't quite measure up, their completely unrealistic portrayal was disheartening.

On to the plot- They have to raise $5,000 to keep their Arts program, and put on a full Glee-sized spectacle that clearly cost twice that amount to put on. In a day and age where this is a REAL problem for our kids, this would have been a GREAT opportunity to give them some REALISTIC solutions. Our own school has fought this battle for the last several years, and it costs approximately $50,000 a year to keep our program; not the measly $5,000 they had to raise.  Putting on a reasonable-scale concert, having Saige and her grandmother sell some of their artwork, a craft sale, the friend who designs her own clothes selling her creations, would have been wonderful to see.  Their actual solution was unrealistic and over the top to the point of being just ridiculous, and I felt abandoned the plot in search of the Disney Pop crowd.

And finally, this group of girls (we may as well throw the grandmother in with it) were whiny, mopey, and just plain unbearable to watch.  Saige was almost completely unlikable, and my daughter laughed about how many hissy-fits and tantrums she had.

So, AMERICAN GIRL, what happened to these girls being your every day American girl, instead of some made-up, glamored-up Hannah Montana with skills far beyond what is realistic for the target audience?  Isn't that what was supposed to set your franchise apart?  Yes, girls this age are more fashion-savvy than we were at 10, but this was just in another realm completely, and not the example I want presented to my daughter.

We certainly won't be adding this one to our collection.",1378080000,85,3379,4.747008547008547

5708464,2,B00C9VZ73S,"Trying to find quality films for my daughter to watch is hard.  She wants so badly to move away from the cartoons and `kiddy shows', despite only being six, because she wants so badly to be bigger than she is.  Allowing her to watch certain programs is hard for me, mainly because she's so young and as a parent my main goal in life is to preserve her innocence and keep her as young as I can for as long as possible.  Then my mother suggested the American Girl movies.  She told me that they were a great transition from animation to live action, and she assured me that there was no boyfriend stuff.

Seriously, if you have a little girl then you understand why that is a big deal.

`Saige Paints the Sky' was the first of the two that we watched, and my daughter LOVED this movie.  My critique of this film and `McKenna Shoots for the Stars' is pretty similar, for the reasons I like and dislike both stem from similar areas.

First, this film tells the story of Saige, a young girl who loves to draw (her grandmother is a famous painter).  Saige is horrified to find out that the school has had to cut out the art program thanks to budget cuts.  If that wasn't bad enough, her best friend Tessa has bonded with Dylan while away for the summer at Music Camp and now Saige feels like an outsider.  Things only get worse for young Saige.  Her grandmother gets severely hurt and her own stagefright becomes a roadblock in her campaign to win back the art program by raising the money needed by the school.

I have quite a few issues with this film.  First, the film in general has a lot of silly plot points.  Most notably is the fact that the money needed by the school for the art program is a measly $5000.  When you consider that Saige's own grandmother is a very famous painter, and the house Saige lives in is easily worth a few million, I'd say that $5000 was nothing to her family and should have been an easy get.  The parade sub-plot and the ridiculous horse riding scenes don't help much.  In fact, the tricks were so dumb that even my six-year old asked me `what did she do?'.  Nothing honey, she did nothing.  A bigger issue I have with this, and an issue that I share with the `McKenna' film,  is that these young girls panic and breakdown and throw hissy fits about EVERYTHING.  In Saige's world, life ends every five seconds.  The inability to have more than one friend is also an issue shared with both films, and while it is an issue resolved by the film's end, it does take on a dominating presence.  I also find it bizarre that parental supervision of these children is so slight.  These kids, who can't be older than 13, are left to do whatever they want, whenever they want, with no parent in sight.

Still, the glossy veneer makes this a fun film to the young ones.  They cheered for Saige when she overcame her fears and when the girls bonded together, and they danced and sang and clapped during the final scene.  Still, I take a serious issue with Saige's actions and her complete and total dramatics.

When your daughter starts excusing her tantrums by saying ""I'm just like Saige"" you know you have a problem.",1376352000,,3137,4.360344827586207

The girls act and behave more like 12 year olds instead of 9 year olds. I also wish that the girls would have dressed in more age appropriate clothes. Saige's dresses were cute and age appropriate, however many of the other characters look like they just waltzed right out of Forever 21, Charlotte Rouse, Wet Seal, Clair's, and Icings.

I know that the American Girl company is competing against many BIG television programs, however I don't think they should ""lower"" their standards just to appeal to the taste of our modern society. Just because the rest of the world is infatuated with superficial, clich, mean girls....doesn't mean that American Girl should copy these norms just for ratings.",1375660800,2,1023,4.84

The characters are extremely unlikable; they feel sorry themselves, and we could not sympathize with them at all!  The grandmother, played by Jane Seymour, has a fall which disables her. She mopes and pities herself, even though she spent the first 30 minutes of the movie imploring her granddaughter to take risks and be strong. The girls in the movie are supposed to be 9 year olds, but they act 13 and dress like 20 year olds. They wear more makeup than most grown women. We (mother and daughter viewers) spent most of the movie making faces at each other in disbelief. Basically, we were nauseous after the first 5 minutes!

The plot is banal and full of cliches.

5708494,2,B00C9VZ73S,"As a horse-loving artist with a lifelong soft spot for American Girl, I was prepared to love this, but was I ever disappointed! It was not worth the money I spent to rent it.

The acting is stiff, superficial, and overwrought throughout, though I think it's more a case of lousy, simplistic script-writing and awkward directing than of poor acting per se. The opening scene promises beautiful scenery, but many of the scenes are obviously faked, with the backdrops added in after filming. The scene in which Saige and her father ride in the balloon is particularly bad - it might as well be a low-budget black-and-white era film with a painted wooden backdrop. It's also obvious that Saige is not really riding the horse, and the riding scenes come off quite stilted and choppy. The lack of realism wouldn't fool any child old enough to be interested in this movie, I would think.

As another reviewer mentioned, the film is full of inter-girl drama, all of which is extraordinarily petty, and which also seems far more middle-school than fourth-grade in nature. The Dylan character is a brat, pure and simple, and Tessa and Gabi have few redeeming qualities. The actress playing Saige is beautiful, and her face clearly conveys Saige's sensitivity, passion and sorrow in some scenes, but overall, the movie does her potential a disservice. Instead of inner strength and determination, her character seems to have an outsized helping of whiney-ness and fit-pitching. Even Jane Seymour does little to redeem the film, but again, I think the poor character development is more a flaw in the script and structure of the film itself.

I developed real sympathy for none of the characters except MAYBE Saige, and I had to try to like her. And, while perhaps it's a misguided attempt to be realistic, but wouldn't it be better if AG showed NICE little girls, who didn't have cat fights as if it were ""normal""? I think AG missed a beautiful chance to work with some cute actresses and some breathtaking scenery and art. Instead of portraying the passions and internal complexities of a sweet, strong, endearing introverted girl, they portrayed the external cattiness, domination, and competition of middle school brats. The end ""art show"" is too polished for supposed kids' work. It's like they grafted a vapid, overly glitzy Disney channel-meets-Glee pop dance routine onto a stilted script and sold it as a heartwarming, edifying movie. Such a disappointment.",1374624000,2,2454,4.965936739659368

I love American Girl. I collect, and I love ALL AG movies. But this was a true disappointment. Luckily, before buying, I rented it for free from my library. I was so excited! I opened it up right away and watched. To my surprise, it was not like the book at all. The book had no drama. Here we have a movie 95% full of it. Lots and lots......... Lots of makeup........ I wouldn't say the acting is the best, either. I love horses and art, so I liked that part. And the dance routine for ""Living Art"" was amazing! But other then that, not so good. All of AG's other movies give girls like me a good life lesson..... I don't think this teaches a good life lesson at all",1374624000,4,683,4.097014925373134

5708499,4,B00C9VZ73S,"This movie gets 5 stars for relatability in terms of AG's target audience (elementary age girls), but a docked star for less than stellar performances and production quality. First on the plus side: As the mother of an almost fourth grader, I have to say this movie absolutely nails the girl drama. My daughter and her friends have all been through situations so similar to the one this movie centers around - two best friends grow apart due to differing interests (singing and art), and each is threatened by a new friendship the other has formed. This movie portrays this well, and the girls work through their differences in a positive way. Saige also works through an intense fear of speaking or appearing in front of others, and even if this isn't your daughter's fear, most girls this age experience some kind of self-consciousness, so they will be able to relate.

The downside is that the production quality and acting seemed to be a step down from prior AG films, even though they have all been pretty cheesy (none are anywhere close to theater quality.) This bugged me, but didn't bug my kids at all (2 girls and a boy, ages 7-9) all of whom were riveted throughout and thought it was great. Certainly this had more valuable lessons in it than most kids' movies, so overall, as long as you don't expect stellar quality, this is a good, solid 'girl' film.",1374451200,,1364,4.636363636363637

Plus they're fun to watch and the storie lines and acting have always been amazing and its great to have these 'kid-friendly' clean and age appropriate movies for my kids to watch!

  I really hate being critical and I am almost always not but I was sort of surprised by the Saige Movie- it teaches a great lesson and the actresses are pretty good. But as other people have mentioned the age just isn't right. After watching it, I realized that the whole movie would make more sense if Saige and her friends were in 8th grade. The clothing and make-up that Saige and her friends were wearing plus the way they act just doesnt make sense for a 4th grader. But the movie is cute and the singing and acting is fun to watch. So while the age is off; the story does teach a great lesson and it's fun to watch. The story does happen to be a little unrealistic- like the way the whole problem of the friendship and the art program and all that get solved very quickly. But its a good movie and it's definitely cute! I would just recommend that when you watch it have in mind that they are older and it'll be great!",1374451200,,1261,4.2677824267782425

These girls were exhibiting behavior more consistent with the early teen years; certainly no child we know behaves or dresses this way. My daughter's favorite show is Little House on the Prairie so the only positive I can say about this movie is that it gave our family a lot of fodder to discuss values, how society has changed, the role of girls and how they're depicted in the media, and similar themes.

I also had a hard time feeling too sorry for her getting to ride that gorgeous horse.  Major $$$$ there!

Look at her house!!""....next was ""She sure is lucky to have a grandma like that!"", and of course, ""I love her outfits and she has so many cool friends"".  SERIOUSLY?  Aren't AG girls and the AG ""philosophy"" supposed to support and empower young girls to be strong and to be themselves?  How can these girls fail at ANYTHING?  They are ridiculously wealthy, have tons of friends, possess every imaginable material luxury, and are picture perfect all the time...hair, make-up, clothing, etc.  Seriously?  Not inspiring at all and a terrible example of what real girl life is like.  How is this image supposed to empower young girls to be ""themselves""?  This image creates more disappointment in knowing that real life girls will never be like that because they do not have all the advantages that these privileged girls do.  These movies should be titled more along the lines of something ridiculous to match the movies like ""the perfect rich popular girls' club"" rather than American Girls, imho.  I might add on a more positive note, that the scenery was nice in certain parts and the horse portrayed as a western trick horse was a lovely animal....albeit very inaccurate....the horse is clearly not a quarter horse and is so dressage gaited it cannot even canter without looking glamorous! (a compliment to the horse, it's trainers, and rider!) ;).",1372982400,29,1817,4.841423948220065
5708522,4,B00C9VZ73S,"I believe this is #7 of the American Girl movies, and overall, our AG girls (ages 6 & 9) enjoyed it; however, be warned, it spews lots of emotional huff and puffiness.

Saige, a modern girl, wants to save the art class at her school and regain a close friendship.  She loves painting and horseback riding with her artsy, Bohemian grandmother, played by Jane Seymour.  Saige's fairly well to do parents play a secondary role in the movie but are loving and wise.

Conflict ensues from girlfriend cattiness about who is whose best friend, and the message here, of course, is let's work together, appreciate each other, and not play games with favoritism.

There's a fair amount of melodrama here, but the young actors are very good; the music is up and bouncy, the singing good and harmonious, and most of the shots just fine.  The upclose horseback scenes are too obviously set-up, and probably better left off; Jane Seymour, who I really like, came across odd and too poignant.  I kept sighing at whatever the next contrived conflict was, but... our girls watched intently and gave it a thumbs up.

It's not their favorite.  My wife and I prefer the historic ones, e.g., Samantha or Felicity.  They show more fortitude and less whininess.  Right now our girls are into Josephina and Caroline.  They read the books, tell me lots of history info, and I'm impressed.

I would note that the story apparently is changed here, and other reviewers complained about that- very typical when one reads a book first.  In summary, we liked the young actors, the music, singing, stage production, and the New Mexico balloon festival near the end.  I give it 3 1/2 stars, but don't want to complain too much because we really hope for more movies.",1372896000,20,1733,4.710963455149502
5708523,3,B00C9VZ73S,"The film is quite entertaining for its target audience, but imo it's let down by the somewhat cheesy acting on Sidney Fullmer's part. They shouldn't have let her whine and diss so much like that, as it somewhat comes to the point that it's ludicrous.",1372896000,,250,4.5777777777777775
5708524,3,B00C9VZ73S,"I read both of the Saige books and I was excited to buy the movie when it came out today. It doesn't follow any of the parts of the books that I liked the most, like it doesn't show Mimi in the care center, or Professor Picasso or the dog training. It doesn't show any of the relationship that Saige has with Georgia, and it doesn't even show that Mimi rode in the hot air balloon at the end of the book and gave the owners certificate for Georgia to Saige. If I hadn't read the books, I probably would like the movie, but since I have, I am really disappointed that so much of the book was replaced.",1372809600,2,600,4.050420168067227
5708525,5,B00C9VZ73S,"This movie is GREAT! I recommend this as the best movie for girls growing up. It describes exactly what young girls are going through now, and it shows that everyone is human.",1372809600,3,175,4.5
5708526,2,B00C9VZ73S,"We are a hardcore American Girl family, with lots of dolls and collectibles, all the movies, and 3 little girls (and their mama!) playing with these items and engaging in these stories every day. We have read all the books and were VERY excited for this movie's release. The books were favorites for my daughter, who is very much like Saige.

So it is with great disappointment that I must proclaim this to be everyone's LEAST favorite AG movie. The script is filled with platitudes and cliches, the soundtrack is repetitive and overbearing, the story is thin, Jane Seymour is dreadful (get a dialect coach, already!) and as a previous reviewer stated, the horseback riding scenes are comically bad.  The close-ups throughout the film are distracting and badly filmed. It's a direction debacle. And Teh Drahmahz! and the giggling, and the BFFs! are nauseating. Even my 7 and 9 year olds were rolling their eyes and calling out ""CHEEEEESY!"" at our first viewing.

Positives:
1. I want to visit Albuquerque now!
2. The little actress who plays Saige is darling and might be good with a different director, in a different film.
3. The character of Luis is wonderful. All my girls like him best out of every cast member!
4. The film does a good job of portraying the struggles of a deeply introverted, highly sensitive young girl.
5. The opening scene is wonderful, inspiring, and lovely.

I wish this had been a better film. My daughters and older boys agree. It's at the bottom of the AG pile.",1372809600,60,1491,4.723076923076923

8578959,3,B00C9VZ73S,"I think well suited for girls 8-9 and up.
My 5 year old doesn't understand so much of the teen drama. And I'm glad for now she doesn't care to watch this because I don't want it rubbing off on her. She's already a little diva as it is so anymore I couldn't handle. ;)
It's a cute movie that teaches perseverance.
However I feel like she does have very heavy magnified fears that some kids may have, but a lot of children don't act out like saige does.
I would hope that our children feel safe coming to us when they have anxiety/ sadness/fear/ feeling left out to sort out their feelings versus having panick and screaming at friends.
I do like that the movie opens a door for children to see what art is all about.
Cute movie for older children.",1489708800,,746,4.223776223776224
