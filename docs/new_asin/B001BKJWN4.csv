8587232,4,B001BKJWN4,"PLAYING TO WIN: INSIDE THE VIDEO GAME INDUSTRY, is an excellent CNBC documentary.
The history of this industry -- past, present, and future -- is well-described by the fascinating, yet still very down-to-Earth people, (but each has a twinkle in his or her eye!), who make these fascinating and involving video games.

There is even a segment on a small boy who, having his own cancer in remission, asked the ""Make A Wish"" foundation for an opportunity to help create a video game, about people defeating cancer cells, for the kids still in the hospital to play.  There is a segment on the creator of ""The Sims"", and on the women in the computer gaming industry.  It all goes by very fast, but -- thanks to having this DVD, you can easily go back to any segment to take notes, or view it again.

The viewing quality is excellent.  This is a ""full-screen"" version, not a ""wide-screen"" one.  The picture fills the entire screen, and there are no distracting black ""bars"" at the top and bottom of the video.  This does, however, eliminate some of the action on the sides of the screen.  But the picture has true colours, and is very sharp.

What I didn't like abour this DVD was the fact that, although it gave a short history of video games, showed where they are going, and showed some of the main
people in the industry....it did NOT show HOW video games are created.  Yes, there is a segment on creating a ""James Bond"" game, (with Sean Connery acting the part) -- but the ""nuts and bolts"" of exactly HOW video gaming is crafted, were not shown
I bought this video hoping to learn if, indeed, I might practically fulfill one of my ambitions -- to become a video-game creator -- but nothing of the actual creation process, (except for showing Mr. Connery re-creating his most famous role for a video game), is shown at all.

In sum, as my title says, this is a great video for learning WHAT goes on in the video-gaming industry, but not at all greatr for learning HOW to go about doing this.",1303430400,,1989,4.481994459833795
8587233,2,B001BKJWN4,"I bought this thinking I'd get an idea of what's going on in the video gaming industry, and it barely gives me even the slightest idea.  It's a very superficial, rah-rah piece of fluff put out by CNBC with next to nothing in the way of real information.  You meet a few of the people -- VERY few -- who're running the gaming industry and they're all big-time players; nothing about the sub-level people working up games on a lesser scale than the blockbuster titans; next to nothing about the failures that came from attempts to try something different and those that are discussed are excused as being either too ahead of their time or too expensive.  The only person profiled who was NOT a part of the high-end game developers is a kid who licked cancer and came up with a game to help kids who're battling the disease.  That was cool and that's the only reason it got 2 stars.  But I'd like to know about the guys who're trying to get their own games going outside the industry, not just about the big boys and girls who've already made it.  So just grab a copy of EGM and read that instead of bothering with this thing.  You'll get ten times more info for less than half the cost.",1237852800,,1184,4.330316742081448
