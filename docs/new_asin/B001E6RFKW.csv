8296893,1,B001E6RFKW,"This DVD is the worst piece of tripe I have ever seen. It looks like something filmed in the backyard by a junior high school student. In fact, a junior high school student could have done better.

The price is an outrage. Nearly 6o d011ars for this junk? You can buy an entire set of historical videos for less. I could not believe my eyes that anyone would charge such an insane amount for this garbage. This video is not worth paying a nickel for... and that is not an exaggeration.

It is historically inaccurate with the worst imaginable hackneyed acting which reminds me of that old TV series F-Troop or Beverly Hillbillies. The actors are all running around dressed up like Daniel Boone, talking in hillbilly Kentucky slang... each acting like some illiterate moron from a Kentucky still... of Li'l Abner ilk.

The only good thing about this film is that it is short in duration. There is not a single redeeming moment to this film. Pure F-troop trash.

The Whiskey rebellion occurred in the Washington county, Pennsylvania region and adjacent counties. The settlers involved were mostly from Ireland and did not walk around talking like a bunch of southern hillbilly hicks. If anything, they had Irish accents. One of these immigrants involved was one of my ancestors from County Down Ireland. The majority of the owners of the distilleries in Washington county, PA had immigrated from Ireland as well. They had brought their distillery experience with them when they settled in this region.

The attacks on the tax collectors in Washington county were quite vile and heinous. The mob of drunken insurrectionists shot up the home of a well-respected Rev War General and then set it on fire... but cried poor mouth when one of the insurrectionists was shot in the process of their attack on the General's home, simply because the General had been appointed as tax collector for the Whiskey Tax. David Bradford was the brutish drunkard leader of this insurrection, planning attacks upon our own government, towns and representatives. They robbed the US mail, opened private correspondence, tarred and feathered and otherwise mutilated the tax collectors or anyone who did not agree with them. After reading private letters stolen from the mail, they planned to attack Pittsburg because Bradford didn't like what the officials wrote in their mail. He also attacked troops and destroyed property, yet ended up escaping to Louisiana. You can read all about the details in the book I listed below. None of this information is in this joke of a film which has no value whatsoever and no historical accuracy either. You will have to read the book.

If you want to know about the real Whiskey Rebellion and the minute details and facts, there is a book called ""The History of Washington County, PA"" written by Boyd Crumrine in 1882 which gives the most in depth and accurate history of this series of events. You can obtain this in PDF format on CD from Amazon dealers. It is the most in depth accounting of every detail imaginable about the Whiskey Insurrection.

Don't waste your money on this DVD farce of a film. It makes a joke out of the entire event and has no historical accuracy whatsoever and the price is an outrage. The distributor should be ashamed for the ridiculous price they have attached to this joke of a film. When I say F-troop... I am not exaggerating in the least. It is quite literally like watching an episode of ""The Real McCoys""... filmed by a preteen in their backyard using local yokels to perform the scenes.

Save your money and boycott this film in addition to the distributor who has the temerity to charge such outrageous fees for this tripe junk.",1298764800,6,3680,4.802527646129542
