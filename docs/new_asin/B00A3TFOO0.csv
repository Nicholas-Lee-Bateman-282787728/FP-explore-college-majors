8546552,4,B00A3TFOO0,"I was thankful to the filmmaker that this documentary was produced.  Independent films are one of the last vestiges of investigative journalism and to see a Swedish film maker be immediately targeted by an international mega-corporation for producing a film which documented a court case against them was chilling.  We know that in the USA our media is owned by six large corporations and much we need to know is not provided because it wouldn't be in the corporate interest.  So, attacking and trying to bankrupt a filmmaker for using his First Amendment Rights is a story that people need to see.",1408838400,,598,4.8431372549019605
8546553,5,B00A3TFOO0,"Of course, given what I learned in this film, I'm sure that some Dole pr flack will be searching through the Internet to find out who I am. Maybe I'll get a letter that closes with ""Good Luck on Your Finances.""
Whether you believe the director's take on Dole's behavior with its South American employees or not, the extent to which Dole went to try to keep a journalist from expressing his opinion it truly impressive. From what I can tell, Dole's pr people -- and perhaps the corporation itself -- does not believe in the First Amendment. And they're not shy about threatening people who do.",1397088000,2,592,4.542056074766355

8546555,1,B00A3TFOO0,"Sadly Big Boys Gone Bananas is Propaganda.:
I am going to continue to Support Dole and Buy More of their Bananas after buying this, This Movie is just Propaganda and slander and more of the usual Washed up 60's ideas of Anti-Corporatism. Only a Few Minutes into this movie and you see A Poster in the Filmmaker's home that says Socialist Author advertising something of sorts I was Surprised There was No Che Slogans on the wall. I guess it would have been too obvious that this so-called ""call for Justice"" for the People in Nicaragua is just another one of the many MichaelMooreHack-esque Films that have come out in recent years all screaming about Evil Money and Evil Corporations while pocketing money off these projects. I Would love to see How A Communist or Socialist Run Enterprise did or has done with Cooperatives or their wacky ideas. I am sure the workers would end up in the gulag,Could these workers Might have been Mistreated? Could they have felt side-effects from working in the field? Every job has it's dangers sadly the way this is Presented and taken advantage by Leftists of the world who live in their comfy comodes while screaming injustice wearing expensive clothing and claiming to be for the Little Man. The Problem isn't Dole,It's Nicaragua which is Sandinista/Communist and which sadly a majority of these Same People re-elected! Where are the Cries for Black Political Prisoners In Cuba locked up for being Black and Cuban and Renouncing Castro? Dr. Biscet God Rest his Soul? and Farinas? None,Because these Banana Republics Leftists love won't dare be criticized, These workers at least have work even if they live in a Third World country and their Political Rights are Attacked By Nicaragua's True Elite of Sandinistas and Communists that's the True Injustice not some Corporation that has provided them Jobs. Nicaragua is all about Bribes and Corruption start ""Reforming"" that and cover the true injustice not this farce. This Ideological One-sided Biased was a waste of my time on netflix. I hope they sue the Filmmakers even more and anyone else having to do with it.",1387152000,,2104,4.896358543417367
