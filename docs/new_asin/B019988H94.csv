Half of the movie was spared by the boring and stupid behavior of father.  And the worst part was a dishonest and crime act by tennis boy himself during his championship game.  I think such kind of script itself is quite immoral, especially for the sporting spirit of all young tennis players.",1477008000,,403,4.619718309859155
8744521,2,B019988H94,"The quote used on the front of the package for this French film says  An Ellegant Thriller Superbly unpredictable.  On the back another quote says Not Since Hitchcocks Strangers on a Train has a tennis match created so much suspense. So as I sat down to watch this 95 minute film I thought Id be captured and, well, surprised. I was surprised  at how there was so little action  except on the tennis court  where a young boy (11 or 12 Id guess) tries to win a tennis tournament. We do see a lot of matches (but they look the same). His parents have their own issues and marriage is crumbling (not a spoiler  really). There is the possibility of something going wrong when the boys father takes the responsibility of taking his son for a physical before he can leave for the finals. But that never happens and the director doesnt seem to care.

I sat through this film waiting for some suspense, but there was none. (Unless you consider whether one of the players will hit the ball when it comes to them.

There is no sex or nudity and a few expletives (at least in the English subtitles). The subtitles are clear though small than what Ive seen recently. There are no bonus features.

I usually love the foreign film DVDs from First Run Features. This one let me down. It really went nowhere. Some might consider the ending a surprise but it wimpers out. The most I can rank this is 2 stars. If you like watching tennis players you could raise it to three stars.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
