In addition to the cast of well known actors, it offers a variety of sub plots all centered around a costumer with a knack of supplying just the right advise with the Santa Suits he offers.  All in all, a heartwarming stroll through a hectic, yet happy time.",1214524800,5,325,4.225806451612903
331175,5,6301454766,"There so few Christmas movies that are truly considered ""classsic"" Christmas movies compared to all of those made over the years. This charming movie is on my top 20 list.  This to me is one of the most under-rated ones and it is a true shame that this isn't aired on TV any longer. And for all of the fans of this movie it is also a shame it hasn't been remastered and put onto DVD. I've had this movie on VHS for years but sadly the tape has gone bad and over the years as in most homes these days, VHS players are obsolete.
 It is a charming and enchanting story.  Who would have ever dreamed that Fred Astaire could pull off playing Santa?  But once he has the costume on he pulls you back to childhood and it just gives you nothing but pure joy when you see him. While the clothes are dated the individual stories are timeless.  Please please can't someone give us a chance to share it with a new generation and put it on DVD???!?!?!",1184630400,15,938,4.1602209944751385
331176,5,6301454766,"I first saw this movie several years ago and then it was shown on TV every year for the next few years.  We have definitely gone downhill from then. The current shows are worthless and show no imagination or charm.  Fred Astaire was at his best in this charming show.  He shows us what the true spirit of Christmas is. I try to watch this every year but I'm afraid one of these years my videotape will break!  Please, someone, issue this on DVD!",1166227200,8,445,4.261904761904762
331177,4,6301454766,"I, too, liked this movie.  I agree with the other person that is should be made available on DVD.",1165276800,9,97,4.105263157894737
331178,5,6301454766,IT IS JUST A NICE FILM WITH A REAL CHRISTMAS FEELING.  LOOKS VERY DATED BUT IT JUST MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD WELL WORTH WATCHING,1079222400,5,123,4.125

331230,3,6301454766,"Fred's understated & smooth performance lends warmth to his ""Magical "" appearance in the numerous roles he inhabits here. The VHS tape I received was Ok quality at beginning & middle, but just wouldn't track at all in the last part, especially in the last 5  minutes.",1388793600,,267,4.680851063829787
331231,4,6301454766,"This movie could teach the Hallmark Channel what Christmas-themed movies should be.  Don't know why it hasn't been reissued on DVD.  It's a compilation of three simple stories tied together by Fred Astaire in several key roles.  Just the right mix of gentle drama, humor, and holiday faith in human nature.",1358467200,4,306,4.96078431372549
331232,4,6301454766,"This is a unique twist on the Santa story, with a trio of storylines with what I thought was a pretty smooth transition between.  There's something about it that appeals, both with the stories and a common thread running through, being an uncommon person.  Fred Astaire, of all people, appears throughout the movie in various personas to help the various subjects move in the direction or redirection of their dreams.  You will see TV stars from the 70's along with some from much farther back.  Most will have a favorite segment, some liking them all.  You arrive at a better place along with the trio of subjects.  It helps define what's important as well as celebrating the season.  Something different - something good.",1355443200,4,723,4.829268292682927
331233,5,6301454766,I saw this film many years ago. I've searched for it but could only find it on VHS. Please would somebody get this issued on DVD as it will sell very well I'm sure!!!!,1324598400,5,167,3.9411764705882355
331234,3,6301454766,"With all the junk that gets re-released on DVD, it is a mystery that ""The Man in the Santa Claus Suit"" has never reappeared in this convenient medium. After all, the industry went to a lot of trouble to sell us on the new and easy disk format, and it certainly is better than the clunky old tape cassettes. So follow up!

Somebody, somewhere, who has the rights to this excellent film can create a win-win situation by bringing it out in a good, clean DVD. It will sell well -- as the responses to the Amazon listing clearly indicate -- and make a buck for the folks who own the property.

What's keeping this from happening?????????????????

Merry Christmas, Mister Scrooge.",1322697600,9,675,4.56198347107438
331235,5,6301454766,PLEASE PLEASE GET THIS MOVIE IN DVD FORMAT.  IT'S A WONDERFUL TV MOVIE.  THIS MOVIE NEEDS TO BE SEEN BY A NEW GENERATION AND HAS BEEN ON VHS FAR TOO LONG--TOO EXPENSIVE.  THANKS.,1321315200,6,178,4.333333333333333
331236,3,6301454766,"This was a movie I have been wanting to purchase for quite some time.  When I looked at the available titles, they were all more expensive than I was comfortable spending.  However, I was led to believe that this was in it's original carton, and was told it is in very good condition.  When I received it, it was in an original, untouched carton, however, the tape was from a rental Video store and the copy of it was poor at best.  This was a disappointment.",1320192000,,459,4.3023255813953485

7811983,5,6301454766,"I really wish this would be released on dvd.  It's a simple and charming little film.  I haven't seen it in years.  Although it's not a unique story, I'd love to add it to my collection of holiday films.",1526342400,,203,4.153846153846154
7811984,5,6301454766,"One has to wonder why a wonderful movie like this has never been released on DVD, with all the other crap that comes out which nobody is buying.  All I can remember is that the film first played on ABC Television way back in the early seventies and who knows who owns the rights to it now.  I wonder if a lot of people, fans of the movie, wrote to ABC to search their archives and find out where the original film is.  (I'm sure it was shot on 35mm film and in black and white, as I recall)  Let's give it a try!",1510358400,,512,3.894230769230769
7811985,5,6301454766,"This is one of the best Christmas movies. Fred Astaire plays Santa to 3 heart-warming tales and changes their lives. I wish they would put this out on DVD, Blu-Ray, or even just to purchase as a digital stream. PLEASE PLEASE put it out there for release.",1508889600,,254,4.425531914893617

Bert Convy....... great cast.  3 different story lines.....all helped by the man who rents each of them a Santa Claus suit.",1482624000,,268,4.826086956521739
7811987,5,6301454766,"A neglected, almost forgotten masterpiece, full of clever touches, in which Fred Astaire appears in about 15 roles. By convincing four troubled men to solve their problems by renting a Santa Claus suit from him, he brings happiness and love to all four. He also displays an uncanny omniscience about their lives (""Ah, Gauss, a great talent, exciting, underrated, you know."") which astonishes the protagonists.

As subtle as Miracle on 34th Street, almost as profound, it has long been unavailable.

But thanks to my DVD recorders, I have perfect transfers which my family watches every Christmas.",1445040000,,596,5.197916666666667

7811990,5,6301454766,"This is a lovely Christmas heart warming film with a good story behind it I don't understand why it is not being shown on TV now it has been a number of years since I last saw it.
Fred Astaire is excellent and pop's up as a number of different characters he has a lovely smile this is a nice film to watch and I would put it in my top 3 of all the Chritmas movies that I have seen I hope someone soon has the sense to release this on DVD as I believe it would sell very well.",1419811200,,475,3.712871287128713
