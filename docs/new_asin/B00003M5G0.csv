1331516,4,B00003M5G0,"The main characters are Kate - Kari Wuheer, and Sarah - Farrah Forke.  Sarah called Kate her best friend.  Kate, in her delusional state, believed she loved Sarah. Kate had been obsessed with Sarah since they were in college.

Though Sarah didn't know it, she and Kate had been lovers quite often.  Many times in college Sarah had woke up with splitting headaches. She never realized Kate had drugged her, utilizing an assortment of Date Rape Drugs.  That continued even after college.  Whenever Kate visited the Headaches would return.  Kate's hunger for Sarah was insatiable.

Kate had sabotaged any relationship Sarah tried to build, while appearing supportive.  She wouldn't let anything stand between her and her obsession.  Eventually Sarah finds a Man she really loves, and wants to marry.  That was enough to push Kate over the edge.  Kate nearly killed him, and Sarah finally learned how unstable her ""Best Friend"" really was.  Resulting in a physical battle between them.

This movie is great for Kari's fans, she plays unstable and demented characters so well.  This movie gives a strong example of a female stalker and a female psychotic.",1457740800,,1150,5.01058201058201
1331517,2,B00003M5G0,"So it wasn't great, it wasn't much of a thriller, and i feel like it ran longer than it was.
It's a movie about a woman named Kate, who has a best friend she's loved since high school. So kate randomly appears and talks to sara about opening a flower shop, and sara is rather against it since she has a boyfriend, and his brother who hangs around a lot. Kate gets jealous and flings money at people and they all do her bidding. It's very slow, boring, and felt like a bad fan fiction. The acting couldn't save this movie, which is saying something because there was some talent there that got wasted. It felt like a bad lifetime movie, and i enjoy some lifetime movies because they are just so out there, this however sank.",1456617600,,723,4.2846715328467155

She is obsessed with her and ruins every chance her friend has at meeting another guy after she sees to it she'll never see the first one again.  This movie starts out good, but then it moves too fast, resulting in the climax all happening too quickly.

1331536,2,B00003M5G0,"Interesting while not unique approach to an obsession film. Story line and acting is weak at times and at others adequate. Two breast shots including one nibble and two soap bubble nipples thrown in probably to assure an R rating. Otherwise it is quit tame in sex, violence, language and drug use with drug use being the most frequent rating violation. And there is a lesbian sex scene in which I could not tell if the straps were up or if straps were down because they were both alternating between cuts but I wouldn't imagine the budget of this film included a script supervisor.
Overall it looked pretty good with rich images, variation in scene lighting and attractive actors. Editing includes a couple scenes in which the dialog fades to black while the scene continues with background music. These are effective with your imagination filling in the dialog rather than sitting through the blah, blah, blah of the written dialog.
So if you have an hour and a half with nothing else going on, don't mind a movie that does not challenge the mind or the eye and are mostly predictable than this one is probably worth a look, there are many, worse movies I've watched.",1401840000,,1168,4.674757281553398

Unfortunately for her, Kate has not managed quite as well. Now, she shows up at Sara's home out of the blue, harboring a secret agenda. She quickly sets out to destroy anyone she considers a threat to her plans. It's evident almost immediately that Kate is a psychopath who will stop at nothing, even murder, to possess Sara. Once Kate has killed off her competition, and oozed her way into Sara's life, she seems to have Sara all to herself. Uh-oh! Sara has a new boyfriend!

Kari Wuhrer is the ultimate evil girl; riveling even the infamous Catherine Tremell (Sharon Stone Basic Instinct).  Catherine was even more clever so she never got caught whereas Kate was clever at the beginning but fell so psycho it had to end tragically for this murderess..you just could not let this girl run free by the time this movie was over.  I loved the gay theme; the acting especially Kari was great. If you want to see a steaming hot lesbian thriller with an evil main character this is the movie to watch.

Farrah Forke looks like a sexy beautiful porn star... sorry guys and gals. not to be. at least I have never seen her in a adult flick yet.

1331545,2,B00003M5G0,"Every so often, I like to rummage through the minor titles to see if I can find a sleeper.  Unfortunately, this one missed the mark.  This is a rather  cheesy production featuring two attractive actresses in an obvious attempt  at sexploitation for commercial gain.
Kate (Kari Wuhrer) is obsessed with  Sara (Farrah Forke), her best friend from high school and college.  They  were going to open a business together in their hometown of New Orleans  until Sara went to California and met a guy.  So, Kate goes to visit her  plotting to break them up.  What follows is a twisted tale and lesbian  seduction, blackmail and murder, just to name a few of the evils Kate  employs to keep Sara close to her.
The writing and direction by Eric  Delebarre in his first feature film was second rate.  The plot is thin and  contrived, stretching credulity repeatedly.  This has B movie stamped all  over it; poor sound and cinematography and a general low budget look.
The  hook here was the lesbian seduction scene where Kate gets Sara stoned and  then ravishes her.  This was obviously a male fantasy lesbian scene, where  Sara is taken by a predator rather than having sex by mutual consent.  From  that standpoint, most male viewers will likely be disappointed since it  shows little more than kissing and groping with everything covered.
The  acting was mediocre to poor.  Kari Wuhrer lacked subtlety and duplicity as  the antagonist.  Her body language and sarcastic delivery made her motives  so obvious that it was impossible to believe that the other characters  wouldn't have noticed sooner.  Farrah Forke was better than Wuhrer.  She  gave a very sincere presentation of her character, albeit overly nave.  Her unaffectedness and spontaneity made the romance scenes with her  boyfriend work well.  The rest of the acting was mundane.
This film has  little to recommend it.  I rated it a 3/10.  The story was weak and the  filmmaking weaker.  For viewers looking for sexual stimulation, there are  plenty of superior alternatives",965088000,,2028,4.910714285714286
1331546,2,B00003M5G0,"B-grade erotic thrillers usually have little to recommend them.  As a general rule, they start bad, and stay bad.  It is no small feat to have  something commendable in one of this movies.  ""Kate's Addiction""  has several things going for it, which is well ahead of the curve.  To  start with, Kari Wuhrer, who plays the title character, is a superstar  waiting to happen.  She is quite good throughout the movie, giving every  ounce of her acting skill to this character, even though it is a textbook  part.  I also want to give special notice to the first scenes in this  movie.  These first few minutes are very good, even heartening.  The  opening scene of Kate watching the video of herself and her college  roommate (played by Farrah Forke; not bad at all here) on graduation day  (although who shot the video is a mystery), then reaching out to touch the  screen, full of longing, shows Wuhrer's real potential.  The next scene  shows the film's potential, as Kate meets with a private investigator about  the woman and the new fiancee that stands between Kate and her intended.  This scene shows what could have been:  a clever, sexy potboiler about  obsession.  Unfortunately, there's not much more imagination left in this  movie.  As soon as I saw Wuhrer packing a pistol into her suitcase, my  heart sank.  I knew where we were headed before the movie did.  We're  presented the standard type of activity in erotic thrillers:  brutal  killings and general mayhem, punctuated by sex scenes.  The supposed twist  here is that the sex is between two women, but that's sort of the problem,  too.  That's the hook for the movie, and once it's happened--in a genuinely  erotic scene that is all the sexier for the expression of joy on Wuhrer's  face--the movie doesn't know what to do with itself, and fades away, which  is too bad, because in those all-too-brief early scenes, and in Wuhrer's  electric performance, you can almost see what this movie could have been.",964137600,,1974,4.752976190476191
1331555,3,B00003M5G0,"Okay, when I saw the trailer I couldn't wait to see it. Although I'm a fan of WINGS, I really like the idea of two hot women together. Now that I've seen the movie, I'm more convinced than ever that I should be making these  movies instead of the jabones who are making them now. The plot was decent,  but it was erratic, and uneven. Too often I felt like the filmmaker strung  clips together. Once the movie got going, I sort of got into it. Kari  Wuhrer is as beautiful as she is convincing in the role of the psycho. When  the two did finally meet, it was too short, too R, and not steamy enough. I  mean, come on. You have two gorgeous actresses--let them act!  Overall, the  movie was a letdown. It could have, and should have been so much more.",954288000,,750,4.159722222222222
