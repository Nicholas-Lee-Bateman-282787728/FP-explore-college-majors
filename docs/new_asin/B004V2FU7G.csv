8442643,4,B004V2FU7G,"Krodh is an Action movie with some romance and comedy. It tells the story of two brothers who are in search of the Paedophile man who killed their mother. The problem is they have never seen his face, but do have his Name. Sanjay Dutt gives a Brilliant performance. Sanjay Dutt is the perfect choice for an action hero in Bollywood. This is One of Sunny Deols Greatest Underrated Movie. Sunny Deol best known for his Hit Films like Ghayal and Kshatriya, is now making continuous Flop movies, where he beats up 100s of guys on his own. When will they learn? The actresses in this movie have no scope. Amrita Singh has made a few Great films in her career. The other female lead, the very gorgeous Sonam hasn't made much Films in Bolywood. This movie did not do Brilliant, possibly due to the off repeated storyline. I would recommend this if you enjoy the Action masala movies.",1305849600,,876,4.515723270440252
