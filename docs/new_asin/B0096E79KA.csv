8536622,4,B0096E79KA,"This hour long DVD shows, in effect, the sort of itinerary of Bangladesh that many a traveller might choose to make. The basic premise is quite simple. A presenter - in this case one Holly Morris - travels from Dhaka down to the Sundarban mangroves, then up to the northern flood plains, across the country to Srimongal and thence by train to Chittagong and then Cox Bazaar.

As a primer it appears pretty good, the host certainly puts things on the line (standing in front of a saltwater crocodile to touch its snout is surely above and beyond the call of duty) and she is personable enough. You get a feel for the human crush of Bangladesh - in fact a few expatriates give their feelings on this at one point - and also a feel for the chaotic nature of many things such as the traffic (30 people per day dying on the countries roads). The host gets down 'n' dirty in the mud of the Sundabarns, tries her hand at working on a tea plantation and fishing via trained otter(!) and openly discusses some of the issues of travelling in a country with so few tourists.

Overall you know this was done on a budget but that doesn't come through on screen because they focus on the human scale. The way the show puts on display a range of the countries big ticket items such as its ship breaking industry and tea plantations as well as seeing how some of the less well-to-do people make a living diving for pink pearls in the rivers is a nice touch. The way the host interacts with locals is good and they actually spend a couple of minutes on the history if the independence struggle so you have some background. This is a pretty good product if you are planning a trip to Bangladesh (it was filmed in 2012) or if you are just an armchair traveller who like to hear about places that haven't been colonised by tourists yet.",1412899200,,1816,4.353982300884955
8536623,5,B0096E79KA,"Having visited Bangladesh earlier in 2012 (the year this DVD was released), I can say that the material is up to date.  The photography is well done and the press of the crowds is really quite well portrayed.  Beginning in the capital of Dhaka we are not bored with a series of shots of government buildings, but instead thrust into the throngs of people with pedicabs and sidewalk restaurants (more adventurist than I, since I did not eat anything that my Bengali friend did not eat).  The scope sweeps across the country including the ""tea country"" the Suderbans mangrove forest and Chittagong / Cox's Bazare.  Careful attention to the details of the hour packed with information gives many clues as to how to negotiate the country.  I just watched the whole hour on television and am ordering a copy for my personal library.  Should you want to visit the country in person from the U.S., you will need a visa and should be prepared to convert any dollars to TAKA upon arrival (most U.S. banks don't deal in TAKA).",1363651200,2,1016,4.648044692737431
