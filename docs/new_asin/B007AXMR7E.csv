8513664,3,B007AXMR7E,I bought this hoping it would help with the difficult concepts of physics. My son said the professor is annoying after the first five lessons. I do not think he will finish the videos.,1448236800,,184,4.4411764705882355

8513667,5,B007AXMR7E,This is really much better than I expected.  Prof Wolfson does a great job in presenting basic concepts in physics with a lot of demos.  I didn't see it all but what I did see made me want to see more.  Mainly wanted to see the section on Thermodynamics and that was very clear.  He is a very good speaker.  I recommend it but wish that it was cheaper or that you could buy it in sections.,1377043200,10,389,4.0
