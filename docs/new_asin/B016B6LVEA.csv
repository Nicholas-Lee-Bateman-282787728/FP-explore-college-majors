8736161,1,B016B6LVEA,"Did I miss something?? No real story here. First off, the movie kept skipping and I couldn't get it to start at all...then pixelling. When it finally came on, the story started with the man in her bedroom trying to rape her. Nothing said about why or what happened leading up to that. She manages to stab him and kill him, and protects her kids by telling them to climb from their bedrm window...which they do. He slumps over and she is saved by cops. Ok. Where is the first part of this ""movie""? It's a DVD R...but that shouldn't matter. Would return it but will cost half what I paid for it, to return it. OK I ordered a second copy just to compare. I am sad to say it was not any better....kept freezing up all through the movie, and skipped a few parts too. And I got that one new. So I reckon they are all about the same. Wasted twenty bucks total. I will try to watch it again. If it does the same thing, it goes in the trash too.  So I recommend no one buy this piece of TRASH!!",1528848000,,985,4.051282051282051

8736163,5,B016B6LVEA,"Wow, a really good DVD.  Man on the Prowl, was excellent, I could watch it a few more time's, and Night of Execution, was amazing, a bonus, old 1956 Chrysler commercial's included.",1482883200,,180,4.625

8736165,3,B016B6LVEA,"James Best was always a great actor, especially in his early days when he could command a lead role with his good looks. Man on the Prowl is a pretty good movie with Best playing a slimey pervert/murderer. The video quality sucks but were lucky someone even found a copy to release. Check it out.",1469491200,,296,4.4
8736166,2,B016B6LVEA,"Man on the prowl is s surprisingly mean but not very interesting thriller about a psycho who kills a young woman for fun in the opening sequence, grinning as he pummels her to death with his fists,  and who eventually sets his sights on a mom with two children and a successful but absent husband who, to him, represent an instant ticket to the American dream.

Actually after that admittedly pretty startling opening scene Man on the Prowl more or less turns into a rougher, sleazier version of Ira Levin's A Kiss Before Dying, which also featured a psycho who viewed murder as his shortcut into the Eisenhower era American Dream.  Man on the Prowl becomes significantly less interesting as soon as it goes in that direction, however, because the character is simply less scary as soon as he settles on an actual plan.

Man on the Prowl  features production values are rough and there's very little suspense.  There are also obviously scenes missing--supposedly this DVD was made from the only surviving print of the film.  Unfortunately, no effort whatsoever was apparently made to restore the print, which looks like it was sitting in someone's attic for 50 years.

Fans of disreputable B movies might get a kick out of Man on the Prowl  but I found it to be mostly a drag, with only James Best's performance as the smarmy psycho ultimately making much of an impression.

This is doubled up with Night of Execution, an episode of the TV anthology program Climax! starring Vincent Price who is solid as a sadistic father and husband.  The story's introduction pretty much gives away exactly where this is going, but if you are a Price fan this curio might be worth a look.  Otherwise don't waste your time--Night of Execution is plodding and too predictable to generate much dramatic interest.",1466380800,2,1795,4.773462783171521
8736167,5,B016B6LVEA,"This is a movie I have sought to have in my collection since its initial theatrical release in 1957. I clearly remember it as a second feature to ""Run Silent, Run Deep"" that I saw on two consecutive visits at the same neighborhood theater.  I consider ""Man On The Prowl"" to be some of the finest acting from actor, James Best. A  few years ago, I communicated with Mr. Best via email asking if he had access to the movie? He replied: ""I have been trying to find the movie myself, with no luck at all"". It seems a little odd that shortly after Mr. Best's passing, this movie suddenly became available.",1453680000,2,600,4.348214285714286
