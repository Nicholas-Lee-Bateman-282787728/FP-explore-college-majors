8156025,2,B000KF0G9A,"The general content of this DVD was good, but I was disappointed at the unpredictable audio. The music often drowns out the dialogue and when there is no music and only dialogue, the volume is too soft. When I turn it up and the music plays again the volume blasts everyone out of the room. If the sound and audio can be corrected, this would be a great DVD.",1454544000,,358,4.202898550724638
8156026,5,B000KF0G9A,"I have purchased all of these dvd's for my niece and nephew, and they have watched them countless times each already.  These dvd's are really entertaining, I even love watching them.  I highly recommend all of the Animated Kids Bible dvd's, they really keep the kids interested, while educating them as well.",1384732800,,308,4.903846153846154
