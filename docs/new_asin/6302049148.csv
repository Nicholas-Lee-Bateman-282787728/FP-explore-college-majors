423218,2,6302049148,"I  miss  the  original  actors  from  the  first  movie.
I  wanted  to  see  Atreu  &  Bastin  together  in  the  first  movie  but  didn't.
Part  of  the  reason  I  don't  watch  the  2'd  one  as  often  is  because  it  just  doesn't  have  the  same  music  as  the  first  one.
I  found  this  movie  more  silly.  You  got  annoying  bird  man  in  the  movie.  Whoever  he  is  his  script  is  pointless.  Falcore  isn't  the  same  either  nor  is  the  rock  beast.  &  couldn't  watch  it  to  the  end.
This  sequel  isn't  real  bad.  There's  just  not  enough  to  keep  you  amused.",1504483200,,599,4.111111111111111

423223,2,6302049148,"As a fan of the original I was looking forward to the second installment which I know was made many years after the first one. By no means horrible, but there were WAY too many changes from the original and it didn't gel for me. Falkor didn't sound the same, and the Childlike Empress went from a blonde to a brunette which made no sense to me at all to name a few. The effects were lacking overall, but most importantly the heart was missing which was such a huge part of the original. The best part of the movie was the villain Xaida, who was in the original book. She was glamorous and over the top so that worked. Harmless for kids who will most likely enjoy it, but not so much for adults trying to touch base with the great childhood memory.",1500854400,3,747,4.194444444444445

423305,2,6302049148,"On the 10th day of Christmas 2016 I'm going to review...The Neverending Story II: The Next Chapter. The plot for is a heartless and watered-down rehash of the first movie. The character portrayal of Bastian in this film is awful because  he is a coward and making idiotic choices regarding his ability to wish for whatever he desires I find very baffling. NO DISRESPECT TO THE LATE Jonathan Brandis, I'm sure he hated the script for the character too and his performance of the said character was better then the one from the first film. I will give credit for casting Native American actor Kenny Morrison as Atreyu. The story is NOT interesting, the message is taken MUCH too literally and the logic makes NO sense. For movie that is part of the Neverending Story trilogy, that's saying something. I give this film a 2 out of 10.",1482451200,,830,4.608108108108108

423358,5,6302049148,"I remember when I saw the movie when I was a kid.  For a film, it was a good one.  Not only did Bastian overcome his fear of heights, he encountered a situation that all fiction authors have to deal with:  What happens when what you intend doesn't go the way you planned.  The father was a great plus, because during the time of the film's release, he was The Flash.  Now the reason why I gave it higher marks than anyone else on this forum.  A year or two back, I came across the actual book, to which this franchise is based on.  Reading it, I noticed a couple of things that differed from the films.  For one, Atreyu was green.  He came from a tribe of green-skinned hunters.  Then there was no Oracle, a plot point that was placed in the film.  Also, the book actually states what Empress's name is called near the end of the first half.  Note that I said that it was the first half of the book.  In the second half, Bastian finds himself in Fantasia with the ability to shape reality at a cost of his memories.  Sound familiar?  It should because, given a few changes, it what happens to Bastian in the very book.  To say that the second movie shouldn't have been made would be reading the original novel and saying that the story would be better if we stopped in the middle of the book.  It lessens the author's statement of what he was trying to convey and it robs the immersion for the reader in question.  So to all the naysayers of this film.  Read the book and see if you feel the same way about this film.",1472947200,,1517,4.1689655172413795

423713,5,6302049148,"This bluray version is awesome. As people of the 90s era know, vhs leaves a lot to be desired in a film. I saw this on DVD but it was still vhs like. The visuals are all updated and colored correctly, reflecting intended moods.
People can say what they want. This movie is more of a stand alone film. The different cast only adds to the beauty of the book, just like our imaginations we change the way characters look and act in books. The actor that plays Bastian is way better than the actor in the first movie. The dad is better. I only wish they had brought back Amy Stronack. I think that's her name. The child like empress never changes, ever that was a main plot in the story. The empty monsters scared the doodoo out of me when I was a kid. So yeah they should have toned the darkness down for kids.
Overall what made this migicale for me as a kid was that it was very dark and emotional. This movie has a huge heart. It showed me to be careful for what I wished for and got me interested in reading books. So yes this movie holds as much as if not more credibility as the first one.
The first one has more scope which works because we are seeing fantasia for the first time and it works with the story. The second is more confined because the story is much darker and evokitive, I agree with others about the choice for the empress and atreyu being bad, but they aren't the main focus either so it doesn't detract from the overall story it actually adds to the imagination.
Stay away from the third one, it is a load of marketing gone wrong. Jack black is in the third but he is not funny at all, the third one is garbage comparable to the Batman and Robin hog wash. Batman and Robin was actually better than the third part.
I love this film and it holds a close spot in my childhood, I recommend it to all of the 90s generation or for people that like practical efects .",1427587200,,1880,4.139344262295082

THE NEXT CHAPTER

As a huge fan of the original film I remember when this came out I was all about it. At the time I didn't care about the changes that happened between films because I was all about being back in Fantasia. Now that many years have passed I decided to revisit this film since a friend was talking about it and I didn't remember a thing about it. I knew Jonathan Brandis was in, at least I remembered that but certain things he was mentioning I could not seem to remember.

Bastian is the same old kid [well aside from now being blonde or whatever] and it seems Fantasia is in need of him again. The emptiness is all the rage in Fantasia these days thanks to an evil sorceress that wants to have Bastian make wishes in order to fill his head with the emptiness. If this happens it means he will lose his memories and therefore forget Fantasia, it will then cease to exist.

So Bastian is baking linking up with old friends and new ones alike which was cool, always glad to see talking rocks and luck dragons. His old homie Atreyu is there once again along with a bird like creature named Nimbly. Speaking of Nimbly I think he was a great addition to the film, he is mad creepy. Now while the effects even for the known creatures don't seem as magical as they did in the first film I still liked them. In fact I didn't mind the story here at all as I know some people really dislike it.

Now I don't have any problem with the change in cast members as the previous actors probably were a bit older looking by this time. I am not sure if that was the reason for the change but I didn't mind, but what about the voice acting, oh well. Any way after going back to watch this again all it really did was remind me of how much I loved the first film. I still did like this one so now I guess I need to re watch the third film, I remember Jack Black being in that one. also I wish that there would have been a commentary for this film from the writer and director or something. They could have explained so much, plus I miss Brandis [R.I.P.]",1410739200,,2074,4.126237623762377

Perhaps people are far too expectant of perfection when the era of perfect films died with Fred Astaire.  I love both films.  The first one is an amazing adventure with lovable Atreyu saving the magical world of Fantasia, and its a great story for children and adults.  The sequel is more for older people in my opinion, with an older Bastian and - at least from my opinion - a slight sexual undertone.

424238,1,6302049148,"NOTE: This review is for the movie The Neverending Story II, as the product is currently advertised.

Few films have raised my hackles like this one.  My essential argument is that the first Neverending Story set a precedent which the second film failed to reach.  If, for some strange reason, you are only interested in seeing the sequel and never plan to watch the original, the following complaints, which I'll limit to two, might not matter so much and you should not bother reading them (and most of the other bad reviews).

(1) I can forgive recasting almost every returning character; theater does it all the time.  However, such a cast should be directed to behave in some way similar to their predecessors when the movie is marketed as a direct sequel.  Not only are the personalities incongruous as established in the first film, but they haven't learned anything.  In fact, they are significantly less intelligent, brave, and wise compared to their introduction in The Neverending Story.  One of Bastion's new limitations is his fear of heights, after flying bareback on a Luck Dragon all over Fantasia for who knows how long.  Nothing is offered to explain why the characters have become such weaker versions of their former selves, and they don't make up for it in any meaningful way throughout the film.

(2) Production was demoted to early 1990s Saturday afternoon TV movie quality.  It could have been worse, but it should have been a lot better.  Effects deemed too complicated or expensive in the first film were swapped out for clever cinematography and rewriting of scenes to make the story fit the crew's capabilities.  In the sequel, if they didn't realize an effect was going to look cheaply done, then they didn't care, because they did it anyway.",1316390400,5,1771,4.863333333333333
424239,2,6302049148,"I hate it when sequels to films basically regurgitate the same storyline with different actors and expect us to accept it as `the next chapter'.  I say this as a rabid fan of the original, and so I really wanted to love this.  But, that same line of reasoning can be used for any of the countless sequels to films that needn't have sequels.  `The Skulls', `American Psycho', `Wild Things', `Cruel Intentions'...yes, they have all had sequels (direct to video I might add) that trashed up the original script (because `direct to video' usually means more nudity) and tried to cash in on something that was, for the moment, popular.  Sadly, this rip-off actually made it to theaters and has a fan base for some reason.  Sure, you may think that it tells a fuller story but that's only because it lacks any subtlety.  The film changes very few things in order to try and claim a sense of originality, but at the end of the day this is a poor man's version of the 1984 classic.  The visual effects and makeup team do their jobs right, helping to create a visual world of wonderment, and the dazzling array of colors and crispness does make a prettier picture than the darker, more solemn original; but the visual quality is suppressed by the fact that this film can't deliver anywhere else.  Jonathan Brandis may have been cute, but he couldn't capture the same depth of character that Barret Oliver found in the original film.  This is a loss, and one of those films that any enthusiast of the 1984 cult masterpiece needs to avoid at all costs.",1315267200,,1541,4.554347826086956

424272,3,6302049148,"This is the much disfavored sequel to the Neverending Story.  While it does suffer a number of problems, I found it to be a decent way to spend a rainy afternoon.  I had seen the original back in the 80's when it came out on video, but had no idea there were any sequels.  Despite the somewhat jaded reviews some gave to the movie, I found it fun and interesting, though in no way up to the standards of the first.

A couple of problems that hit me right off: When did Bastian become a blond?  Ok, maybe he dyed his hair going for a new look.  I can let this one go.  But then, when Bastian gets to Fantasia he meets back up with Atreyu, who has changed from a white boy to an Indian!  Changing hair color is one thing, but a character's whole nationality?  Good Grief!

Besides these two problems, the film was ok.  I can see where some would think the whole ""scared to jump off the diving board"" thing was a bit hokey, and I'll admit that I agree, but remember, this is aimed at kids and I guess the filmmaker was attempting to have some sort of positive message he could incorporate into his film to please parents of the ""movies should have a good lesson for kids"" type.

All in all, one thumb up for a decent effort.",1240876800,,1221,4.148936170212766
424273,3,6302049148,"Everyone knows that the first Neverending Story is a masterpiece among family films. It had an excellent plot, fantastic visuals, and an unbelievably catchy song by Limahl. A lot of kids in this generation might not like it, but most of us adults go back to this film for our own nostalgic needs. A timeless classic, indeed. Then this sequel comes along...

I don't know about some of you, but I felt like turning off ""The Next Chapter."" First of all, the original actors for Atreyu, Bastian, and the Childlike Empress are nowhere in sight. They've been replaced by three other kids that are sadly inferior. Second, the script was weaker than the original: I mean, the plot did have some interesting things going on, but the silly dialogue could've had some reworking in the process. And finally, there's Nimbly the anthropomorphic bird. The character reminded me of Jar-Jar Binks: a totally annoying character. Of course, Nimbly would attract kid viewers, but adults would sure wish this bird would go away.

But it's not a complete loss. The visuals are still spectacular, and the music is almost equal to the original. It would've been nice if Falkor was given a much larger role in the film, but it's good that he's present. This film in general had some potential, but lackluster performances and irritating new characters made it an almost complete failure.

Pee pee special effects and puke character development.  This movie is going to be in hell with Satan and his angels and those who do not obey Jesus Christ.

But what I really want to know is: WHY?!?!?!??!!  Why would they do this to the original!  WHY?!?!?!??!?!?!?!

A dumb bird-guy who I guess is supposed to be a flying chicken or something?  Falkor with bronchitis?  Atreyu replaced by a lower-paid immigrant?  (Actually the kid who played Atreyu was about the only person who could have done well in a compitent sequel.)  Tri-face?  The dumbes name EVER.  The ""high five scene"" was not even funny when I first saw it at the theater when I was 8.  Water that's acid?  Why?  And why doesn't that factor in to anything later?  The dancing people in the Crystal City... why?  Why were they so lame/French?  Their dancing sucked.  Even in one scene one of the ""dancers"" stops dancing and actually looks at the camera as if he doesn't know what to do after stopping.  Then he ashamedly enters into a conused ""dance"" and then the scene ends.  Atreyu dies from rolling a little bit?  We went through worse in part 1!  And if that killed Atreyu then Bastian assuredly should have died from his later fall off the horse!  UGH!!!!

Taking a returning Visit to fantasia Different then the original in a way but still very amusing to bring you back to your youth.

A must have if you possess the first part, if you don't, then what are you waiting for, if you like fantasy movies, even thou it's aged nowadays, the Neverending Story and the Never Ending Story 2, are a must have for your collection of Fantasy movies.

Your Children will be gratefull for it if you have any.

424280,3,6302049148,"In this sequel to the successful original film, Bastian (Jonathan Brandis) is once again transported to Fantasia.  Bastian is no longer threatened by bullies, but is instead taunted by his classmates when he joins the dive team.  His father (John Wesley Shipp) misguidedly prods Bastian into overcoming his fears.  Frustrated, Bastian returns to Mr. Koreander's bookstore and though he is warned that the story in ""The Neverending Story"" doesn't remain the same, Bastian borrows the book and ends up returning to Fantasia.  Upon entering Fantasia, Bastian finds that he has the symbol of the childlike Empress, Auryn, around his neck.  He is informed by the giant bird Nimbly (Martin Umbach) that anytime he makes a wish, the power in Auryn will make the wish come true.  However, there is a dark secret to Auryn.  To save Fantasia, Bastian must find out Auryn's secret, defeat the evil witch Xayide, and stop the Emptiness from consuming Fantasia.

The original film version of THE NEVERENDING STORY was a decent adaptation of Michael Ende's novel, but unfortunately only told half the story.  THE NEVERENDING STORY II takes elements from the second-half of Ende's novel, but only uses them as plot points to tell a completely different story.

I remember watching THE NEVERENDING STORY II in theatres and finding myself a bit let down.  There is a great deal of excitement to capture the imagination of children (I'll never forget the way Bastian solves his dilemma--it's a choice worthy of Solomon).  Nevertheless, the overall plot and structure of the film is much weaker.  After having first viewed the film, the most memorable thing I remember taking out of it was that Flash (John Wesley Shipp) and that cool kid actor (Jonathan Brandis) were in it.  Over fifteen years later, those are probably the things that people will most remember from the movie.

It was a special moment that I won't forget for the rest of my life.

The original film had true majestic sweep, and a beautiful film score.  It accomplishes what any good fantasy film does, making you suspend disbelief, and get caught up in the storyline.  Unfortunately, the special magic of the first film was not to be recreated for the second NES.  It's too bad that the second installation couldn't have been made in conjunction with the first one.

424334,4,6302049148,"""The NeverEnding Story II"" is the next chapter in the film adaption of Michael Ende's fantasy novel, this one more loosely related to the book than the first.

Bastian (Jonathan Landis in this film) is a little bit older, and possibly a bit wiser, thanks to all the books he's been reading. Still, just like the first film, he has his fears to face. Rather than bullies, he's facing the fears inside his mind, his fear of heights on the diving board. His imagination, the one that helped rebuild Fantasia, is working against him, and when he looks down into the pool he sees roaring waterfalls and gets himself all cramped up. Bastian, in search of courage, goes to the antique store to get some books on diving. There, he spots the NeverEnding Story, now with great tracts and pages blank. Bastian takes the book once more, maybe if he reads it again he can fix what's wrong. The story takes him into Fantasia, that world of luck dragons and rockbiters, and it is once again under threat, by an Emptiness that makes all the wonderful characters and landscapes hollow and void of nourishment. Bastian has the Auryn with him, the symbol from the cover of the book, and with it he can grant wishes that could save the fantasy world. Little does he know that an evil sorcress named Xayide (the cause of the Emptiness) has a device that will steal memories from Bastian every time he makes a wish. Will Bastian be able to save Fantasia, or will the wishes make his head as hollow as the Emptiness?

Though the look of the film is quite similar, (use of sets, models and matte paintings) its got a rather different feel. The casting of the characters is pretty different. Bastian's father now has hair and is a bit moodier, Bastian has gone blonde, and the Child-Like Empress has got a perm. Still, there are some characters who have been cast similar, like the child-warrior Atreyu, this time played by Kenny Morrison who I thought did a really good job here recreating the original character. It's funny though, I saw this in cinemas when I was a kid, and I didn't even pick up the casting differences! Also, this time Bastian is in the story, rather than living through Atreyu, his practically alter-ego, which changes the dynamic a bit, as does the introduction of a major villain.

Though there are some fantastic places to see, there's not as much exploration of locations, and though there is a lot of dialogue, there's a little less development of character. So though I like the film, it does feel a little less in terms of entertainment and fascination. It's definitely better than the third film, though, that's for sure!

It's worth checking out for fans of the first film, I think.",1160784000,2,2689,4.619246861924686
424335,1,6302049148,"now that's a movie i never want to see again in my life.

What's there to say?  bad acting, and just about the stupidest plot i ever heard.  bastion has to master his fear of hights to get on the swim team because he can't jump off the diving board, poor baby. then he goes into fantasia because the words in the neverending story are disappearing, and gets into the most unlikely adventure that ever played on my tv screen. he meets a really annoying bird named nimbly, whom i wanted to strangle after about five minutes.  for some reason, bastion decides nimbly is his best friend.  but really, nimbly is working for an evil witch named xayide, who insists on raising her eyebrows seductively every five seconds.  the evil witch wants to take over fantasia, so she's imprisoned the childlike empress in the ivory tower (beats me how that's supposed to help).  then, in order to stop bastion, she rigs up an evil machine that takes one of his memories every time he wishes on the Auron. the idea is that he'll forget what his mission is.

which is totally ridiculous, because you know how many individual memories we have? just about a few trillion. and bastion is making new memories every second he's awake, and if he forgets why he's in fantasia, atreyu (who has joined him on his quest) can surely remind him. And, bastion never shows any signs of losing his memory, even when the jar that's supposed to hold his memories is almost full. oh, and then bastion's father starts going crazy looking for him, finds the book, and starts reading about his adventure, interjecting stupid little comments like, ""my son's riding a horse?"" every two seconds, which really disrupts the story, and is also really annoying because he's such a bad actor. god, i can't beleive i wasted an hour and a half of my life on this movie.",1148169600,24,1819,4.575384615384616

424388,3,6302049148,"THE NEVERENDING STORY II - THE NEXT CHAPTER is a more-than-competant sequel to the first film (again based on the novel by Michael Ende), with a well plotted storyline and fine actors bringing it to life.  Bastian (Jonathan Brandis) is swept back into the storybook of ""The NeverEnding Story"" and it's mythical kingdom of Fantasia.  To his horror, Bastian realises that Fantasia is slowly vanishing due to a mysterious evil force, which to defeat he must first  name.  Aided by Atreyu (Kenny Morrison), Bastian travels to the fortress of sorceress Xayide (Clarissa Burt).  Xayide uses her feminine charms to drive a wedge between Bastian and Atreyu, and hides a few more secrets in her plans to ""bring order to the chaos they call dreams and stories"".

Jonathan Brandis is perfectly-cast as Bastian (this was his first big role).  Clarissa Burt is an eyeful as Xayide (American-born Burt is one of the top stars in the Italian film and TV industry).  Kenny Morrison, Martin Umbach, John Wesley Shipp and Alexandra Johnes (as the Childlike Empress) all deliver fine performances.  The music score by Robert Folk is truly beautiful (and has garnered quite a following of admirers).  Warners' DVD features a crisp anamorphic print in addition to the trailer.

424389,2,6302049148,"Okay, the first thing you'll notice here is pretty much the whole cast is replaced.  I guess that's okay if you keep yourself open-minded.  So that is forgivable.  There's something that is not so easily forgiven though, this movie isn't even a fourth as good as the second half of the book that inspired it.  The story in the second movie has a much, much lower quality than the story in the second half of the book.  It's okay for Hollywood I guess, but man, why make a screenplay based on a book that's so inferior to the book it was based on?  My guess is to recreate so many sets would cost too much.  The Silver City and the Seeing Hand eats up a good chunk of change as it is.

To enjoy this movie, you have to keep yourself open-minded enough to accept the new cast, but not so open-minded that you compare it with the book it's based on.  If you read the book, you'll really see how far below it this movie is.  This movie just looks like it was made to re-hash some of the crazy costumes ideas thought up in the first one.

Here are a few things that were in the book, could have been in this movie, and would have made it much better, but were totally left out (these may be considered book spoilers) - The three knights Bastian travels with, the race of ugly creatures that builds the Silver City, the mule Yikka that Bastian rides, the Water of Life, the mine of pictures, the desert of many colors and the lion and night forest that go along with it, the monks of the Star Cloister, the magic sword Bastian has, and most importantly, the city of the old emperors.

424390,1,6302049148,"The original NeverEnding Story movie was a masterpiece. A complete work of art. I remember watching that movie when I was a kid, it amazed me. I watch today, and it amazes me how it still draws me into that story so easily. In my opinion, it is a pure fantasy world with no flaws, in acting, in plot, in direction, in visuals; the characters are all wonderfully original and well played.

*sigh* Now...to the sequel.

Besides the fact that every single character was recast (aside from the bookkeeper?), and besides the fact that every character has a brand new personality which contradicts how they were in the first movie. Besides the fact that Bastian had brown hair in the first movie, and now all of a sudden he has blonde hair. Apart from the fact that Bastian's dad has quite the receding hairline in the first movie, and now, in the sequel, where'd that full head of hair come from? Aside from the fact that Falcor turned stupid for something reason. Apart from the fact that Atreyu, the brave warrior in the first movie, turns into a confused sidekick that can only speak broken english now...

*sigh* aside from all of that...

The thing that gets me the most, throughout the sequel they call the Empress, ""The Child-like Empress""... *sigh*

...She is not child-like; she is, in fact, just a child! ""Child-Empress""!!!

The magic that was the first movie disappeared in the second. I think the thing that sets the movies apart the most, a thing that hurts the sequel quite a bit, is the fact that we have to views of the story, in the original, Bastian's point of view as he reads the book, and then Atreyu's and the others view from inside the story.

With the NeverEnding Story II, there is no outside view. It's very linear, inside the story only, except of course, near the end, when the father starts reading the book, but the adult point of view doesn't fit in very well with the story.

I just popped in The NeverEnding Story into my VCR. The visuals are stunning, the Fantasia world in the original movie is so well thought-out, and obviously so. But there's something lacking with the sequel, it seems like you're in a different, low-budget version of Fantasia.

*sigh*

So, I think I'm done with my rant.

But if you've lasted with me this long, here's my advice:

The original movie is, no doubt, a must have in anyone's movie collection. If you must see the second one, just to see how bad it is (if you haven't seen it already), borrow it from someone or rent it, but don't buy it. It's not worth the money.",1114819200,125,2530,4.512035010940919

Jonathan Brandis takes over the role of Bastian, a boy who likes to read. He frequents a kindly old bookkeeper's shop, the same bookkeeper that allowed him to take the NeverEnding Story the first time. While in the store one day, the NeverEnding Story calls out to him. Having already read it once, Bastian wants to read it again. But this book never reads the same way twice. Soon, Bastian is transported to Fantasia, where he must find and name a new threat that is destroying this beautiful world.
Many of the characters from the first movie are back, including the Rock Biter, Falcor, and the Childlike Empress. Atreyu is back as well, this time played by Kenny Morrison. Unfortunately, Noah Hathaway (the original Atreyu) left shoes too big for Kenny to fill. But Jonathan Brandis is able to compensate with a charm and likableness that was missing from the first Bastian (Barret Oliver).
Overall, this movie does not measure up to the original (that movie set the bar way too high for any sequel).

This time around Jonathan Brandis (Ladybugs, Seaquest DSV) puts on the shoes as our hero Bastien.  Here, Bastien must return to Fantasia to stop the evil Xayide from taking over the land.  In his return he rejoins his friends Rock Biter, Atreyu, and of course Falcor.  He even encounters new Fantasianites that either aid/delay Bastien in his journey.  The movie is full of adventure, great scenery, strong characters and even a few life-lessons.  In terms of the DVD treatment, an excellent transfer has taken place.  You are able to get the full-screen or widescreen option on a two-sided disc, along with the movie trailer, and even Bastien's Word Challenge, which is a different, but nice addition to the disc.

Do I feel it is worthy of the being in league with the NeverEnding Story saga??? In a way. It somewhat follows the book after chapter M (#13), the second half. However, this movie has some obvious faults. For one, the atmosphere of the movie is close to neither the first movie (dark, depressing, but really good) nor the book (intelligent, witty, amazing). I liked Jonathan Brandis (Bastian)  but not Kenny Morrison (Atreyu). The chick who played the Childlike Empress, in my mind, was not right for the part at all. On the plus side, I thought Xayide was excelently portrayed: Very sinister and evil but clever. The status of Bastian's relationship to his father was more prevalent, and made more sweet. (A[...])

I had no clue what The Neverending Story was, nor did I have a clue who any of the actors were. I loved this movie. Every time it was on the Disney channel, I'd park my butt in front of the tv to watch it again. 2 years later, I fell in love with the character of Lucas in SeaQuest DSV. Same actor.
  Yes I know I'm very off topic there. Both SeaQuest and NES2 have some things in common. You have to take them with a grain of salt. I did say i saw this one first. I went out and rented the first one. I loved that one as well. I went into both with a very open mind. Only this summer did i buy the book (which i highly recommend). In one brief summary, I knew what the book was about, and that Part one of the movie was like the first half of the book, and part 2 was the second half (remember how Bastian started out as a lil chubby kid then made a wish to be a handsome kid? there you go! part one and part two!). Something that stuck with me most in that conversation was ""Well at least the actor in Neverending Story 3 wasn't Antonio Sabato Jr.""
  Take my advice. WATCH THIS ONE! Watch the first one too! They're both great. And STAY AWAY from the third one. The only problem I have with this is that they waited too long for sequels. By the time they came up to the third one (1992 or 1993 or 1994) our young Jonathan Brandis was in his late teens. And the child from the first one (Barret Olivier?) was too old for the second one since they waited five years to make a sequel.
Good movie though. I don't have the DVD. I have the first and second video. I may just buy them on dvd.",1017360000,,1730,3.90625
424445,3,6302049148,"For all you NES fans out there (And I don't mean a Nintendo), you might be a bit disappointed. As is tragic with many sequels, it is hard to capture the magic from the original. While part 2 features the critters and main character from the first, I found it to be more geared towards the kiddies this time. It didn't seem as dark and sinister as the previous movie.
However, all in all I had to give it 3 stars. Although not quite what I was hopeing for, it still provided the younger kids with entertainment while giving us older kids some much deserved peace and quiet :) So it ain't all that bad ;)",1016150400,,602,4.198275862068965
424446,1,6302049148,"The first movie is a great movie that every child and any adult with a love for Tolkien, LeGuin, C.S. Lewis will feel compelled to see.  The second movie has no chivalry, no mystery no romance, and I wish my children had not seen it, to interfere and dilute the powerful feelings and lessons of the first. The allegory of the first is far superior to the second. I understand the third is even worse.",1015545600,11,400,4.333333333333333
424485,5,6302049148,"Now don't get me wrong, I can see bad acting as well as the next reviewer.  And I must admit that some of the acting and dialog was... Well, I've seen better.
Looking past that, that movie was pretty well done.  I still think the set for Silver City is pretty darn cool, and at least Atreju didn't have an English Accent in this one (you have to admit, that just didn't sit right).
My family has owned both movies (Let us not even considder part III a movie), since I and my Sibs were quite little.  Since we had both movies it was like one lead strate into the next one.  We could finish one video and pop in the next one.  Even though bastian, Atreju and Bastian's Dad weren't the same, a lot of things were.  The Auryn, Falcor, Rockbiter, even Mr. Koriander.  That was very nice.
And, was I the only one who thought that in the origional Bastian named the Empress ""Rock-Bite Idaho!""?... Yes, probably.
I thought the Memory thing was neat.  And I still understood that it was the Auryn taking away his memories, not the Memory Machine.
Yeah, the Giants didn't look like Giants and were most obviously puppets, Rockbiter had a son with an annoying voice, The Childlike Empress wasn't childlike enough, and Bastian wished for a spray-can.  But hey, as sequels go, it wasn't bad.  As you've probably noticed the title of my review by now, I'll explain it.  When I was younger I did like Part II better than the first one, I guess because it wasn't as dark.
I've always seen both movies as an inseperable set, and have a soft spot for them both.  But there's one thing I don't get.  Why did Bastian just keep wishing for 'one more step' instead of wishing for enough steps to get to the top?  I'm sorry.  If you haven't seen the movie you don't have the foggiest clue what I mean.  But most of you probably do.
It's not as bad as a lot would have you believe.  It's a movie!  Obviously it won't be as good as the book.
Oh yeah, and Tri-Face is cool!",1012780800,,1947,4.287671232876712

To me, the second movie was good, but it was the same old good vs. evil plot, as in the first.  i've never seen the third one, but I would like to, and I'd rather stay away from the television series that's now being shown on TMN (The Movie Network).

(Ironically enough)  If you're a true fan of the first movie and the book,  STAY AWAY.

It's not very much like the book, horrible acting (Bastian and his father), and the effects weren't as good as in the first.  In the book, Xaxide is not a major charachter.  On the back of the Auryn, it's supposed to say 'Do what you wish' (Atreyu didn't notice this because he can't read) so Bastian was supposed to wish even w/out a bird trying to pursuade him.  Xaxide's powere is not supposed to make Bastian lose his memory, it is the power of the Auryn that does.  Bastian is just really stupid in this movie.

To recapture his courage he has to go to Fantasia again. And in this Fantasia, which is menaced again by Empty, a bad fairy, let's say, he has to confront her and destroy her. But she tricks him by stealing his memories along with satisfying his wishes. Each wish is a lost memory. He is about to become totally empty and Fantasia would die by becoming a non-entity. We can note this time he is part of this adventure directly in Fantasia. But he is saved because he finds the tricky wish that kills the bad Fairy, but essentially because his father is reading the story as it is happening and he is able to believe it and to communicate with his son. The engineer the father is has learned at the end that it is not enough to see something, you need to believe that the invisible exists. But the hero finally finds the courage to dive into an abyss and also, and that is very good, the courage, and God knows a child needs a lot of courage to do that, to tell his father he loves him. It is true it is a lot easier to tell your father that you hate him. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX.",990576000,,1273,4.178861788617886
