4386666,1,B004IK30L4,Vegas was a great show but it seems that the owners of Spelling Productions is trying bilk their fans out of extra money.  This only contains 11 of 22 episodes but they are charging like you are getting a full season!  Do not buy any show that splits the seasons.  Send a message to studios that we are not going to put up with their games and refuse to buy these ripoff box sets.,1300492800,6,380,4.108108108108108
4386667,5,B004IK30L4,"Slowly but surely we are finally getting the series on dvd. This will complete the second season of this neat Robert Urich series. Filled with a Vegas background, raving beauties and handsome lead man make this a winner. Plus so many classic tv stars like on Love Boat guest every week. Maureen McCormick, Red Buttons,June Lockhart, Robert Reed, Dick Sargent, Priscilla Barns, Heather Menzies and the list goes on....... Plenty of action keeps this series very entertaining plus our lead man changes his shirt on camera at least two times and episode insuring many female and male viewers to some wonderful eye candy. Robert is gone but lives on in our hearts a truly dramatic actor, and great man gone too soon.",1297036800,11,712,4.844262295081967
4386668,4,B004IK30L4,"While I give CBS/Paramount a big 'thumbs-down' for giving this series their split-season treatment on DVD, I am glad they are continuing to bring us the volumes at such a reasonably swift pace.

This set consists of the last 11 episodes of the Season Two, originally airing Wednesdays at 10 pm on ABC during 1979-80.

Like other Aaron spelling productions, ""Vega$"" in its second season, had already become very formulaic but was still a pleasant diversion with its glitzy locale and wide range of guest stars.

Robert Urich continues to carry the show effortlessly, with his macho-lite/easy-going demeanor. Greg Morris, Phyllis Davis and Bart Braverman are all still along for the ride as his superior, secretary and sidekick.

The guest stars this 'go-round include Lloyd Bochner, James Darren, Natalie Shafer,  female impersonator Jim Bailey, and Cameron Mitchell. It's interesting to see Urich paired with guest star Dennis Cole, whom I always felt made for a blonde, more suave version of Mr. Urich.

The best episode of this lot is the two-part ""Golden Gate Cop Killer"", which guest-stars Michelle Phillips and Tanya Roberts and was basically the pilot for an unsold series titled ""Ladies in Blue"", featuring the two beauties as lady cops. Based on this appearance, Roberts landed her role as Julie Rogers on ""Charlie's Angels"" when the producers wanted to replace Shelley Hack.

Like the previous releases, the only bonus features are the original episode promos. These show some wear-and-tear and have not been cleaned up for DVD like the episodes themselves. Still, they are kind of campy and fun to watch as a warm-up.

The cover art on this set is the best yet. I love the purple design and the cast photos they chose. Everyone looks terrific and it's a sharp-looking set.",1294704000,3,1782,5.016949152542373

4386670,4,B004IK30L4,"Las Vegas, Second Season. Is of course a fun series. This version is from CBS so the sound and image quality are excellent. This also documents what Las Vegas used to be. Is sad that Robert Urich and Greg Morris passed away.",1418428800,,224,4.357142857142857

4386673,5,B004IK30L4,Made the first freeze of the year worth it with season 1 & 2 in the house... loved this show as a teen and fell in love all over again this weekend.,1414886400,,148,3.65625

4386675,5,B004IK30L4,"And so we meet again...Dan Tanna and I. He in his red '57 T-bird convertible; I in my ""I Love Dan Tanna"" t-shirt, chasing him down the Strip. If you've read my other reviews of this show, you know how I love Robert Urich & his perfect-fitting jeans. Well, Dan is back, and so are his jeans.

Returning with him in this second half of season 2 are his secretary Bea (Phyllis Davis), sidekick Binzer (Bart Braverman) and Lt. Nelson (Greg Morris).

I really enjoyed so many of these episodes.  A few of my favorites are:
- ""Lost Monday"" - Binzer goes under hypnosis and becomes something he's not...a criminal.
- ""All Kinds of Love"" - Bea falls in love in Hawaii and brings her fianc home to meet everyone, but Dan thinks her fianc is a killer.
- ""The Man Who Was Twice"" - A performer at the Desert Inn is receiving death threats.  Jim Bailey guest stars & what an incredible voice he has!  Also, I love seeing Wolfman Jack at the disco.
- ""Siege of the Desert Inn"" - A group of men try to rob the Desert Inn, but something goes awry and they take a group of showgirls, including Bea, hostage.

Guest stars include:  Mary Ann Mobley, Dennis Cole, James Darren, Lloyd Bochner, Wolfman Jack, Darleen Carr, Captain & Tennille, Dick Sargent, Chick Vennera, Louis Jourdan, Robert Loggia, Peggy Cass, Natalie Schafer, Joseph Campanella and female impersonator/singer Jim Bailey

There are 11 episodes in this half season from 1980, all of good picture and sound quality.  There are no extras, but there are episodic promos.  One of the episodes, ""The Golden Gate Cop Killer"" is actually a two-hour movie.  It's good and shot beautifully, but there is a bit too much Tanya Roberts and Michelle Phillips for me (I just didn't find their characters very interesting) & not quite enough Dan Tanna.

I highly recommend ""Vega$."" They don't make 'em like this anymore...not the show or the man.",1397779200,2,1878,4.606606606606607

Bad part is it looks like CBS is going to screw us and not release season 3 on DVD.",1328140800,,143,3.9310344827586206
4386684,5,B004IK30L4,The DVDs arrived very quickly and they are crystal clear!

4386686,4,B004IK30L4,"Vega$ the second season volume two follows along the same track as all the previous releases with only half a season on 3 DVD's with Episodic promo's as the only special feature. There's also English subtitles.

The later part of season 2 features episodes that center around Binzer, Bea, and Lt. Nelson. Binzer gets hypnotized into a robot-like killer while going for some ""self-help"". Bea inexplicably falls for a heinous criminal plotting to take her young daughter's inheritance money.

And Lt. Nelson has someone from the past coming after him and his family. This is the first time we get to see Nelson's family and home. Race is briefly brought up in a scene between Nelson and a shady character at a pool hall.

In another scene between Lt. Nelson and his mom, race is also alluded to but not directly addressed by the mom when she brings up her grandparents ""running away"" in the past. These two scenes are a change of pace for Vega$. The pool hall confrontation was especially intense.

Lastly Mitch Costigan, Tanna's war buddy from season 1, makes a couple of appearances in the episodes ""Casualty of War"" and ""Magic Sister Slayings"". Picture and sound quality is on par with previous releases and unlike with some other older TV show sets, everything seems to be intact.

Fortunately the releases for seasons 1 and 2(volumes 1 and 2) have come quickly and consistently. Hopefully season 3 will be released soon so everyone can complete their set of Vega$.",1310860800,8,1467,4.805555555555555

I hope it's real soon, I don't like being placed on the back burner / on hold.  The only two { 2 } things that I Don't like is that, when burning these DVD's, they ONLY make up  1/2  a Season instead of the Entire Season, AND you can ONLY Play One { 1 } Eposoide @ a Time, you Can't Play "" ALL  Eposoides "", like you can with other Television Shows.  Other wise, I love this show.  I'm patiently awaiting for the next Televsion Show that Robert Urich had Starred in, "" Spencer For Hire "".

4386688,5,B004IK30L4,"For those complaining about the ""half seasons""; currently, as of the date/time of this review--season 2 parts 1 & 2 are around $55 for the whole season. However, given the fact that this TV show began and ended 30 years ago, this is a rare collector's item. It's kind of like ""what would you pay for a rare collectible""?? Also, remember this series aired on ABC, notice it's CBS Entertainment bringing it out, so that could be taken into consideration as to why it is being manufactured the way it is.

But, since this isn't a ""price"" review, but ""product"" review, that is where I am heading....

This, like the previous seasons/parts are in a space saving case with 3 DVDs and 11 episodes. Don't expect any extras, remember this was a short-lived series from the 1970's, that I personally don't think was marketed to it's potential. Two of the main stars are gone so there isn't a chance for any interviews or reunions. There are no episodes listed on the DVDs but they are listed on the inside of case insert (sorry I can't describe it any better).

If you like the series, I would recommend buying it. Although today's cop/detective shows are more advanced, this is a great blast from the past and reminders of what Las Vegas used to look like.",1301356800,2,1247,4.558035714285714
