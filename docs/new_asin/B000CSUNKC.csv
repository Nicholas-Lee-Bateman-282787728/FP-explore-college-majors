2473502,5,B000CSUNKC,"I haven't any issues with the pbs thing playing. It jumps right in.

If you put this into your computer you have some CD-ROM aspects too like coloring pages and games.

You can play any episode first and it will play that and the subsequent episodes in order.

I have a screamer. He sits for this. I am a happy mom.

P.S. The Canadian way people in the video never say ""yes"" they say ""ya"". I'm American it's a bit annoying to me to hear my two-year-old yelling YA!",1177977600,,464,4.179775280898877

2473505,5,B000CSUNKC,The new Caillou dvds are a little different from what we're used to.  They don't have the puppets in between the segments.  They are still great and the kids don't seem to mind.,1166659200,30,177,4.333333333333333
2473506,5,B000CSUNKC,"There's a lot to praise about the Caillou series, but three things stand out especially in my mind. First: having myself three kids in or slightly past the age of Caillou (4) and his sister (2), I must say I have never seen video-stories so sensitive and accurate in portraying the mental world of the two age levels. The author is reported to be a children's psychology specialist, and it certainly shows.

The second point is related: the stories unfold in a wonderfully gentle, serene, every-day manner. They're in total contrast to the prevalent action-packed, slightly hysterical type of children's movies, yet somehow they're very powerful in drawing the audience into the little joys and pains of a kid's life.

Finally, though perhaps less uniquely: Mum and Dad are depicted in a refreshingly modern, realistic way which does more than just break the dualist Dad-as-career-hero, Mum-as-saintly-guardian stereotype. It shows them as people who sometimes want to have fun on their own, and who call in a nanny for the kids when they throw a party.",1150243200,47,1053,5.011428571428572

2473514,5,B000CSUNKC,"Our 3 year old son who loves trucks, cars, and firetrucks, ambulances, etc. loves this Caillou. It is still second compared to the Winnie the Pooh movies (the new one and the Tigger movie) but it is nice to have another in the rotation for long car rides to visit family.",1380067200,,271,4.333333333333333
2473515,1,B000CSUNKC,"Until now, I've never had a single complaint about my near-perfect three year old. From sleeping through the night at 6 weeks of, giving up bottles and his crib and moving to his own room - even taking baths and going to bed every night without a single complaint and potty training and reading on his own at 2.

UNTIL CAILLOU.  And I'm not joking. This isn't a joke review. This is a serious complaint.

That obnoxious little brat, Caillou, in just two episodes, has my son WHINING ""I can't!!"" to EVERYTHING he is asked to do. ""Time to get out of the tub, sweetie,"" I tell him. ""I caaaaaaannnn't."" He whines in this horrible squeal. I had NO IDEA where this abhorrent behavior came from until I caught THREE SECONDS of this horrible show on tv.

My won was watching intently and I said ""turn the tv off please."" And to my horror, he dropped to the floor, and started whining over and over ""I can't!  I can't"".

I wanted to throw up.  No shock- this horrible excuse for a television show has been PERMANENTLY banned from our home. I will tell every parent I know of this god -awful excuse for an ""educational program"".

My son has caught glimpses of sponge bob (crude), power rangers (physical fighting) and even half an hour of gremlins (not in my presence, but I found out he saw the most gruesome parts) and had ZERO reaction to these things - he didn't karate chop our house cats, or imitate any of the crude humor on sponge bob....but in a mere TWO MINUTES of ""CAILLOU"" my son immediately picked up that petulant little Bart's HORRIBLE incessant whine and his ""I can't"" crap that he spews every time he is asked or told to do ANYTHING.

In every episode after the first season, Caillou whines about EVERYTHING. He throws things, yells at his sister ""Nooooooo, Rosie!"" And whines CONSTANTLY. God forbid you should let your child watch this and then he or she starts sounding like Caillou. I'd rather my son dance around saying ""Say Map!"" All day than listening to him whine about EVERYTHING.

BY FAR the worst children's show I've ever seen.  PBS should be paying for a professional to help me fix this behavior (and a trip to the spa to relax my nerves after listening to the whining I'd never had to deal with before ""CAILLOU"". Flat out AWFUL.

2473530,5,B000CSUNKC,"My 22 month granddaughter just absolutely fell in love with Calliou from watching PBSKidsSprout! She can be in another room & hear just one or two notes of the theme song & lights up & says 'KY-YEE!' & runs in to watch it! She has the 'Everyday Hero'
DVD & I know pretty much every word to the whole thing! She has probably watched this thing over 100 times. I kid you not! AND, she's only had it a few months!!!
Thank goodness for a refreshing cartoon that is something you aren't afraid to let children watch! A few things are pretty absurd~him knowing how to talk THAT well & being able to do EVERYTHING he does. But, it is still something that I will always let her watch as long as she is interested. I just wish I could find the merchandise in stores without having to search the internet! At least the DVD's are in stores!!!
You can't go wrong with Calliou, er, KY-YEE!!! ;-)))",1260662400,,884,4.299401197604791

This is a nice easy DVD for ""getting ready for bed"". My daughter has fallen asleep in front of it numerous times, which is virtually impossible with Elmo or Curious George.

I choose this one because it doesn't have the puppets in the middle of the regular cartoon parts because my son doesn't like those parts.  He loves it, highly recommend.
