8689315,5,B00PULRGRE,A recent Ozu convert (maybe the last 5 years) and so am now re-watching everything I have already seen.  I really loved this film (probably in my top 5 of his films) and this blu-ray looks great.  Its Criterion so you know you are getting something well cared for.  I had the original DVD (still do) but had to upgrade this one just to have the pronounced image.  Picked it up on a 50% off sale so well worth the investment.,1437696000,7,424,4.197530864197531

8689317,5,B00PULRGRE,"The Criterion Collection released An Autumn Afternoon on DVD in 2008. Seven years later, we have this new Blu-ray version. But how big of an upgrade does it represent?

A pretty big one, as it turns out. On DVD, An Autumn Afternoon looked...fine. But not half as good as this. The Blu-ray features clearer sound, richer colors and a far more detailed picture than the DVD. For the first time, I could easily read every label that appears in the movie, and admire artwork hanging on walls in the background. Of course, with greater detail comes more obvious film grain, but that's been the tradeoff I've noticed with every Blu-ray of an older movie.

Most importantly, a damaged section of the film's first scene has been repaired here. I've noticed the damage (some missing frames, maybe?) on multiple prints of the film - including one I saw in a movie theater - but someone has fixed it up, to a great extent. Even though I was looking for it, I barely noticed it.

The special features seem about identical to the DVD's. David Bordwell does an informative commentary on the movie, which is the high point. Criterion also includes a French TV program covering the movie that seems a little...pretentious?...and not quite on point. Still, I'll take it over nothing. Lastly, you get some trailers and a booklet of interesting essays on Ozu.

Despite the lack of great new features, for me the upgrade to Blu-ray was a no-brainer. Because, this is my favorite movie. I find it to be an oddly funny and moving meditation on loneliness, both outside and within relationships. It's almost startling to realize that such a good movie about ordinary people actually exists, and it doesn't even have indie-movie pretensions! So, kudos to Criterion to rereleasing it with a better print and that first scene cleaned up a bit. Run out and buy it, my friends.",1426982400,20,1849,4.750778816199377
