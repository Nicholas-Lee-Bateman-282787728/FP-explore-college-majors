931244,5,6304680104,"Yup, watched her eyes the whole movie and nary a blink.  Oh yes, just as  the picture shows, she's wearing a mini-skirt.  You'd think her legs would get cold in the sub-zero temperature of mars.

PROS:  Just a few shorts here.

1.  When you see that ship coming in for a landing pay real close attention.  Despite it obviously being a model the landing it self is taken very seriously...it seems to take its gyro movement hours in movie land to stop turning--I guess martians don't use gyro brakes.  Very interesting landing.  Somesort of braking or manuvering rockets are used for the actual soft landing--the downward thrust is off center and would have made the ship yawl to the left side a bit.

2.  Filmed in what appears to be Gothic England style--gives the film a slight classy look.

3.  All in all, this film takes itself very seriously, and the arrival of an alien spaceship from another world is just part of the story.  Several sub-plots here.  It would have made an ok drama without the ships' arrival.

4.  When they get back to the ship--after all the other sub-plots start up inside the house--notice the gyros' outer ring in the center of the ship.  When it begins moving at the end of the movie it turns from right to left.  Apparently some sort of air scoop or ram.  Thinking about it, if the special effects people had hollowed the interior out a bit and funneled this air down through the ship, it could have aided the down blast of the engine flames a lot, making them more powerful looking.

5.  The Robot;  boy, now I've seen it all.  Talk about a mail drop - mailbox at the postoffice! Two legs, no flashing lights a couple of dials, and of course the required destuctor ray.

Six.  She does have a ray gun and uses it once on the gardner.

7.  There is a lot of acting going on in the movie.  I'm not sure I can

say it should have been better.

CONS:

1.  I'm not sure more money would have helped.  I would have liked to said the Devil Girl from Mars acting was a little bit off and might have taken a little something from the movie, but I don't think so.  Not, it's not the acting.  I think, believe it or not, it was the look of the robot and her cloths taking away from the movie and its intent.  She certainly played her part seriously.  After all, this long legged cutie is bullet proof.

I think you will enjoy this movie...don't look for the usual campy special effects here, it's more story than shooting.  I've already seen the movie half a hour ago and am watching it now as I write this--I'm at the part where everybody is at the space ship.  The Devil Girl has told them to come with her and she would show them true power!  The suspense is building up, including the music.  You can't fault acting here. The door to the ship eases open--the ramp is already down--heavy on the base drums to show it's a serious moment.  The people in the movie see it before you do--they all take half a step back and clutch each other and then...and...AND, out waddles this mailbox from the postoffice!

Now get this, the Devil Girl gives this smug glance at the earth people as if say 'Ha!  Now you know you're in for it puny humans.'

I've got to tell you, these actors can really act.  Yes, that is it, it's the girls cloths and the robot.  Had they been re-done this film would have been taken more seriously and a greater success.

So that's it.  I give this serious science fiction with gothic and classy overtones four stars with an added star because none of the actors laughted when the robot first showed itself and because the long legged Devil Girl played her part so well.

Normally I would recommend one bowl of popcorn to watch this movie with because most of them do not require much attention, but I feel deep down in this movies' case you must have the full spread.  One big salad bowl of popcorn and two hot dogs -- chili, onion, mustard on mine please -- and something to wash it down with.  And get ready to study it closer than you thought you would.",1176336000,4,3998,4.336941813261164
931245,5,6304680104,"I know this movie is not considered great cinema; but much like ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", it has alot of quirky appeal.  One can suspend critical judgement--after all, every movie has flaws--and just enjoy it.  I saw it when I was a child, and watching it now, aside from the enjoyment of seeing it again, of course I can look for details I missed back then.",1174348800,,359,4.343283582089552
931246,5,6304680104,"So Mars needs men to repopulate? If they all look like this babe, sign me up! She's tall, sexy, and cold as ice. This may be the first and only sci-fi movie centralized around a female alien dominetrex. Talk about hot. She could melt the polar ice caps just walking by.

Her robot companion is nothing much more than a huge walking box. Maybe the movie went broke after the dazzling special effects they used inside the space ship.

The movie is pretty entertaining and creepy in a strange way. It's not my favorite Atomic Age movie, but if you enjoy 50's Sci-Fi, you need this in your collection.",1103760000,14,597,4.467889908256881
931247,4,6304680104,"Quite honestly I'd never bothered to check this movie out until recently and was really surprised! The special effects are very good for 1955 (or 1954 or 1958? Different sources have different dates for this film). The space ship alone is well worth checking out the film (minus the phallic landing gear which are good for a laugh). Her robot is really interesting too and has joined my top ten trippy sci fi robots list although his head does look like a light bulb. Impressive effects over all. True this film borrows heavily from Day The Earth Stood Still and only starts once the space ship arrives and does become very predictable by the end but if you're a collector of freaky cool space ship/aliens/robot movies then this is one worth owning. She arrives in a biogenic ship which is a concept decades away from Star Trek Next Generation. She sets up a force field around the Inn which is well done and the enterance to the space craft is so impressive I paused the DVD to figure out how they did it- it reminds me of the first Star Wars movie where R2 D2 is kidnapped in the desert by the Jawas(sp?). Way a head of the fifties in ideas although she dresses like an S/M Cat Woman and over explains her plans to the stupid humans, a character flaw that will lead to her demise! The funniest thing for me is she can easily travel in the 4th dimension with a blink of an eye and yet she constantly walks from her ship to the Inn. Sort of pointless don't you think?",1070236800,6,1467,4.357664233576642
931248,4,6304680104,"I saw in the opening credits that this screenplay was originally a play. keeping that in mind i watched the movie thinking ""now how did they do this scene on stage?"" This attitude helped keep me amused.
 Perhaps because it once was a play, the characters spoke like people in a play--a lot more clever than in real-life.
The premise of the story gets lost at times. Like when the ""devil girl"" marched the hero off to her ship I was saying to myself--""He's going to Mars to impregnate thousands of Martian women--tall statuesque women in black leather So what's the problem?""",1026777600,3,574,4.627450980392157
931249,3,6304680104,"Devil Girl from Mars, an early effort of Harry and Edward Danziger, producers of dozens of British potboilers throughout the 50s and 60s, is one of those movies that inhabits that netherworld of not-really-good-enough-to-be-good-not-really-bad-enough-to-be-good. While the title and advertising materials promise a super-campy yuk-fest a la Queen of Outer Space, Catwomen of the Moon, etc., the movie really only delivers a mildy diverting, highly derivative tale of a butchy femalien (Nyah) and her clunky robot. At times stealing shamelessy from The Day the Earth Stood Still (to one-tenth the effect), the script consists mostly of lots of Earthbound dramatic and romantic subplots. Die-hards may find some faint amusement in the Devil Girl's imperious, slightly bitchy manner, her ungainly robot's all-too-brief appearances, and the vaguely Monty Pythonish reactions of the Scottish townsfolk to their cosmic visitors. Also on the plus side: Nyah's dominatrix-like leather/vinyl costume; the cool 50s-deco-look spaceship and robot; OK, if limited, special effects, and the absolutely radiant Hazel Court. What she's doing romancing that schmuck Hugh McDermott is a complete mystery. I really wanted to like this movie more, but honestly it's pretty dry overall. Unless you're already attuned to English 1950s SF you're likely to find this a bit on the dull side, and Quatermass fans, etc. will probably find it rather dumb as well. Ultimately, Devil Girl remains a passable time-waster for bad movie aficionados, but just not as much fun as it should be. They should have put Hazel Court in that leather suit and had HER be mean and bitchy!
The good news is that at least the DVD is worthy. There is some occasional light speckling (a little worse toward the beginning of the movie), but otherwise the source print is quite presentable, with little to no visible damage, good tonal values, sharpness, and detail. An OK if somewhat scratchy trailer and chapter stops are included. If you already love the movie, or are a Hazel Court fan or 50s completist, it's a pretty solid buy; the only-curious may want to see it first (somehow) before purchasing.",1007596800,15,2154,5.2645348837209305
931250,2,6304680104,"This movie had an absolutely amazing effect! I sat down, ready and alert, expecting to see another of the all time worst science fiction movies that require special talents (and perhaps the ability to see invisible things) to appreciate. Then after perhaps 10 minutes of watching pointless dialogue set in what appeared to be an abandoned stage set from Abie's Wild Irish Rose, I fell soundly asleep. When I next awoke, there was the devil girl and her large aluminum foil robot. Then a brief nap later, her ship was destroyed as the earthlings ""fooled her again."" What a refreshing movie!

931251,3,6304680104,"You'll find it hard to belive that Britain made a movie this bad--and the most amazing thing about it is how seriously it's film-makers took it. It's like they expected it to be an all-time masterpiece. Oh well, hundreds of  today's directors do the same thing (Peter Greenway etc.) so I guess these  film-makers of ""the new millenium"" are just as immature as they  were in 1954. A husky-voiced alien arrives on planet Earth with her  tinsel-foiled robot and harrasses the owners of a tea-house. While she's  away getting ready to kill them, some very funny (and very Britsh) dialogue  is heard (""While we're all alive we might as well have a cup of  tea"").

931252,3,6304680104,"With a title like DEVIL GIRL FROM MARS you're not expecting much, so when you get a movie with at least a little bit of substance you're inevitably pleased. Almost a quiet, character ensemble movie buoyed considerably by  its rural English setting and its well-defined (if somewhat broadly drawn)  characters. Sure, it's a B-movie, but it's not nearly as campy as some  would describe - in fact, it's played rather seriously. Overall, not a bad  way to pass a Saturday afternoon; great home matinee material.
The DVD  presentation is sparse - there's a trailer, and chapter selections, but  nothing else. It's tough to justify the list price on this, but it IS a  very nice print overall and shows excellent tone and definition. Sound is  excellent as well.

931383,4,6304680104,"Close to six decades ago I and my little friends would repair of many a Saturday to the Franklin Theater for the sole purpose of having the living bejesus scared out of us - such greats as Them!,  Earth vs Flying Saucers. War of the Worlds, and Devil Girl from Mars. I still like to catch these movies on old tv, some of them pitifully bad.
This one, I have to say, holds up very well. Unfortunately, because I had vaguely remembered how it ended, I wasn't frightened to paralysis. (oh, for the good old days!) Still, the plots is there, and the remembered paranoia re flying saucers, and of course the darkly sexy characters in this one, as well as the language differences which I found interesting as a seven year old, are all still there. I would have rated a perfect 5, save for the slightly soft footage.

932058,5,6304680104,"This is an old B&W British Sci-Fi film, and quite an engaging one. It starts out like any other non-Sci-Fi movie, introducing characters, relationships, and locations. At one point it flips over all the cards and a spaceships lands...very slowly. Now the true plot is revealed - Mars has gone all-amazon and their Queen is here for Man juice!
Like so many other mysterious aliens, she kills the first humans she sees (even though male) ray-gunning him with a controversial weapon that reduces men to two round, plain white balls...
Then she announces her complete plans in detail to everyone, admits to a slight miscalculation of the Earth's atmospheric composition - she was aiming for London - and disappears. Not too much time passes before the American in the group can't take it anymore - he's just GOTTA shoot somebody! He calmly unloads his revolver at point blank on the impervious Martian Queen when she  shows up, but she doesn't respond. Then she brings out her mobile device, a ten foot robot with a plastic pail head and a safety light inside that shoots out disintegrating  pulses, which it demonstrates on a tree and a truck! Can doom be far off? She can also befriend children and telepathically hypnotize men, making her virtually unstoppable!
How will this typical group of post-war Brits figure this out?
I'm not telling!

You have to like this classic type of movie with slow cameras and solid writing and awesome technical effects (for the time - all very low tech); if you like B&W well-made movies from those days, this is a really good one. There are many elements in it that will be used in other films; the sets are really creative, the plot places some interesting concepts in front of you, and several ""- hey wait a minute"" moments that will entertain you quite well (watch that pistol.)

The movie's not that much fun to watch; instead of over the top crazy, it's a mildly dotty, stagebound piece of Exposition Theater. The Devil Girl (Patricia Laffan) takes great pains to explain (over and over) to her seven captives how powerless they are to stop her from doing whatever she wants, which is apparently to kidnap one physically adequate Earth male to service the entire female population of Mars, who've inconveniently killed off their men. The ""nuclear,"" solid fuel belching flying saucer's kind of cool, and it's priceless watching the cast flee in terror from the ridiculous-looking robot -- a shuffling, transistor breadbox with a built-in death ray -- but this stately sci-fi drama is neither good sci-fi nor good drama; it's a good title, gone to waste.",1431734400,4,1373,5.865

The robot is hilarious as the poor guy inside this overly tall and top-heavy get up struggles desperately not to fall over - my favorite parts! The storyline is weakness plus as Nyah explains she landed off course because the Earth's atmosphere threw off her nav system (damn tubes, anyway). So there she is, terrorizing a small pub and guest house in rural England, where all the ""action"" takes place. Honestly, everytime I sit down to watch this thing I end up dozing off before it's over. I finally had to start it about 3/4 of the way through to finally see how it ended.

932404,4,6304680104,"Devil Girl from Mars has a terrible title which misleads one to think we're in for a space-monster-invasion flick. It's nothing of the sort.

The film looks like a pastoral drama at a country inn until the spaceship lands. Everyone is very British in their stiff-upper-lip and carry-on-at-all costs way. Five years earlier, instead of a spaceship, it would have been a Nazi invasion force with little difference in the story line, but this is 1955, and it's the atomic age.

It's obvious from the interior of the spaceship, the robot, and one humanoid traveling through space to Earth, that this film was influenced by The Day The Earth Stood Still. Nyah plays the role of Klaatu's evil sister and Chanti the robot, the role of Gort. Nyah, who would have been a great choice to play the role of Mrs. Danvers in Rebecca, is strong, cold, and ruthless, while the Earth women are emotional, cry, and fall apart - with the exception of the proprietess of the inn who serves tea to ""settle the nerves"" at the height of the crisis.

The special effects are quite good for a 1955 sci-fi thriller, even if the spaceship does look like you could boil potatoes in it on your stovetop, and even if it doesn't compare well with 1953's The War of the Worlds or 1956' Forbidden Planet.

Overall, this film is a (small) notch or two above the standard mid 1950's sci-fi fare. You can choose to go along with it for the thrill or make fun of it. Either way, it's entertaining. I will note for those who are inclined to ridicule, Chanti looks more like a gigantic walking juke box than a menacing robot.",1379980800,,1586,4.534965034965035

The cast was almost predictable; We had the Grandmother and her charming but mischievous husband looking after their daughters son for a bit, the barmaid with a past, the escaped prisoner who was actually a nice guy who just made a mistake and was in fact, the barmaids mysterious past.  Add to that the inquisitive child, the professor who doubted life in outer space but was called in from the city to look into the reports of a meteor  that fell to the earth, the reporter who came along to cover the story and of course the girl from Mars, who could have been the inspiration for Spock on Star Trek, and of course last but not least the very, very low tech robot.

I finally had the chance today when I found it as an offering for Amazon Prime members.  It was obviously going to be a low budget film, but I wasn't expecting it to take place in Scotland or be made in England.  I was expecting a `Cat Women of the Moon' type American B-film.  The dreary atmosphere at first brought to mind `The Man from Planet X', a film I thoroughly enjoy.  Unfortunately this did not turn out to be as good a movie.  The plot here involves a tall, stern, not unattractive woman in leather and a short skirt with a strange hat.  She's from Mars and comes to our world in search of male specimens for breeding stock.  It seems war has decimated the males of her own world and women are the dominant sex.  When I see films with similar plots I imagine legions of male volunteers fighting to go of their own free will...instead they show men having to be dragged off like victims; they aren't willing.  The movie contained too much pointless dialog for its own good and the direction was poor.  On the bright side the cast gave it their best shot with what they had to work with.  As might be expected the best scenes were those with the Devil Girl and those with her B-movie budget giant robot.  The robot was a like a poor man's Gort.  Her spaceship was also pretty neat and the ray gun effects weren't bad.  I also thought the explosion near the end was an unusual effect.  I'll give this movie a  2 out of 5 for those reasons.

Yep looks like a neighboring planet is deficient of a certain commodity (males). The visitor is Nyah (Patricia Laffan) an aloof min-skirted manless female alien.  To satisfy the sci-fi in all of us they mention ""antimatter"" (in so many words) and the next dimension. Does the space vehicle look like a prototype of the familiar Spielberg vehicles?

Will Ellen Prestwick (Hazel Court) suddenly switch from tomato juice to whisky?
Will Robert Justin (Peter Reynolds) kill or make time?
Will Nyah get what she came for or more than she bargained for?

Overall, it's a well-crafted film full of familiar faces from British film & television of the 50s and 60s. The American lead actor (whose performance, to be fair to critics, is a little hammy) can even be found later in Harryhausen's ""First Men in the Moon."" The story is straightforward with a decent sub-plot; the film moves right along. The robot and Martian space craft are highly imaginative--among my favorite sci-fi designs of that era (I'm speaking here as a professional designer who's had some experience in both sci-fi design and film production). An unusual, interesting, and entertaining film that deserves respect. I sure wouldn't dismiss this as schlock and the cinematography, lighting, costumes, props, etc. are as good as anything that came out of Britain at the time, so comparisons to Ed Wood really don't work.

The format is cute and the best part is that they hardly cost a thing to buy!

If your a fan of B-cinema like myself, than this couble feature of two of the 50s most hilarious Sci-Fi flicks is a must see.

I had already posted a review on Frankenstein's Daughter(1958), a film that ranks among the funniest bad movies of all time. Directed by the ""great"" Richard Cunha, this film sought new depths of hilarity with a hilariously non-female Monster that is supposed to be created from the body of a babe. A horny medico who overacts to no degree.
Some of the worst death scenes ever recorded and how about that song sung by Harold Lloyd Jr.? Hoo boy.
Yeah, bad film fans line up for this one!

The other film is one that I have not reviewed yet, but have viewed before and that is the AMAZING ""Devil Girl From Mars""(1954). This one is a camp classic. Supposedly Britain's answer to the Sci-Fi craze that was state side, this one can hardly compare. ""The Day the Earth Stood Still""(1951) this ain't.

The plot is a flimsy one about a group of boring, disparate people that are trapped in a Scottish Inne that has become besieged by the lone female invader from Mars. She's a hot number wearing tight black leather,a cape, skull cap and mini-skirt and wants to find men to help repopulate her planet(Mars) and find her own suitable mate. The guys actually DON'T want to go!

I have to give credit to the filmmakers for the feminist slant, very far ahead of it's time, especially for the 50s. The Devil Girl's delicious look is also far ahead of it's time. The leather look not catching on for awhile and the mini-skirt not becoming a sexy mainstay until the 60s.

The film is certainly funny in it's straight faced absurdity, but there's precious little action and it's bizarre that in such a crisis all that most of them can do is down the booze!

Several hilarious attempts are made to destroy our beautiful invader, but to no avail. Not one guy makes a ""move"" on her, which defies credibility in my mind. The closest we get is when the old doctor gets an eyeful of her the first time and looks over her figure intoning,""I never thought a person from Mars would look so HUMAN!""
Than again this was the 50s. Things like this were still taboo. You couldn't show an Earth man enjoying the company of a Martian invader.

I feel that to make this not a complete fantasy that the destructive elements were added in, otherwise it would be too much to swallow. So the Devil Girl is ""Evil"" and blows things up with her Raygun at random and uses her Refrigerator Robot to blow more stuff up. Yay!

The body count ain't much either, save for this loser named ""David"" who is blown away for no apparent reason save for the Devil Girl's remark that he was ""inferior earthling"". I agree! What was he on screen for like less than a minute? Some chick at the inne called
him ""creepy"", so I guess that means he had to die.

There's also some other funny stuff including priceless dialouge like ""There's a woman from Mars!""-""Oh no, now I'll have to make another room!"" or that Scottish guy's yell of ""Shoot Mun, Shoot!"". That one I had to replay a few times!

The direction is far too stage bound to be truly exciting, but the acting isn't all bad. All the women are good actresses including future Hammer starlet Hazel Court as a beautiful model who just happens to be staying at the inne providing a ""healthier"" love interest for the hero(Hugh Mcdermott). Adrienne Corry is attractive as a barmaid in love with an escaped killer(Peter Reynolds).

The most memorable performance of course is Patricia Laffan as Nyah, the Devil Girl from Mars. With her busty figure and that sexy exotic look she remains one of the Sci-Fi genre's most memorable femme fatales.
So, Sci-Fi cheeze fans unite! See this one. It's a CLASSIC.

The DVD also provides two cartoons including a Popeye from the 50s and one of those great 40s Superman catoons. I this one he fights...mummies! There's also highly inappropiate, but amusing commercials on hand. My favorite was the set for toy cars. It looks fun, what with it's Drive in(Playing ""Have Gun Will Travel""!) and car wash(!), it looks like it was fun.

All in all, this DVD was way too much fun for the two dollars I paid for it. Perfect for the rainy Saturday afternoon of a schlockaholic.",1242777600,7,4580,4.54247572815534

932718,3,6304680104,"""Devil Girl From Mars"" (1954) looks like a strange cross between ""Quatermass Xperiment"" (1955) and ""Queen of Outer Space.""(1958). Then throw in a little of ""Mars Needs Women"" (1967) and ""The Mysterians"" (1957) for good measure. So if you don't like any of these films you might consider avoiding contact with ""Devil Girl"".

This is the earliest film I know of with aliens seeking Earthlings for breeding stock. It is played perfectly straight. Naya (Patricia Laffan) is an emotionless Martian space explorer. She has the Michael Rennie role here, but she is not visiting Earth for reasons that will benefit mankind. Still she is beautiful and her black leather costume and ""Ming the Merciless"" helmet must have caused quite a sensation back in 1954.

Like Rennie she arrives in a flying saucer with a robot. The saucer looks interesting but Chani the robot looks like a mailbox with a hood ornament.

It's one of a handful of 50's English science fiction films. It's real claim to fame is that it's the adaptation of a radio play. All the action (and there is not very much) takes place on the moors of Scotland and involves a varied collection of Earthlings staying at the remote Bonnie Charlie Inn whose proprietress speaks the immortal line: ""While we're still alive, we might as well have a cup of tea"".

Actually the film is not nearly as bad as its reputation. The film stock is excellent (at least judging by the 1990 Rhino VHS release) even if it does rely too much on wide master shots, with beautiful Hazel Court as one of the guests a few close-ups would have been nice. The production design and the special effects are more than adequate for the period of the film.

As a radio play the story by necessity adopts the remote house with an unlikely group of strangers dynamic. But it explores new territory by making a woman the invincible extraterrestrial visitor. She is a woman from a planet of women who indulges herself and the viewer with lengthy very humorous lectures on the inferiority of Earthlings. And she even expounds at length about the fusion reactor (probably film's first reference to this) that powers her ship.

  Well, let's see ... Alien ship breaks down and lands in some utterly remote part of the British Isles.  Evil Babe spends her time wandering back and forth between the broken ship, and the only pub in town, with its three inhabitants.  Her fiendish plan?  To take virile men back to Mars for mating purposes, as their own race is, well, dried up.

  Ooookay ... and, who's resisting this plan?  Rather than long lines of volunteers forming to the right, we have the buffoons from the pub daring to go up against Evil Babe's giant robot, which looks like a mail box, and likes to sadistically fry the opposition, and finally manage to blow up the space-ship that looks rather like a tea kettle, in a blaze of sparklers or something, as it takes off.  End of story.

7877856,5,6304680104,"Pretty good so-bad-it's-good 50's British-made sci-fi film.  A whirling dervish spaceship noisily lands on the Scottish moors in the vicinity of an isolated inn.  The cast of characters occupying the inn are a hoot.  A sweet martinet inn-owner, her thoroughly whipped booze-loving hubby, a world-weary model, a genius scientist, a blustery blow-hard reporter (who's sincere with all his gassing), a barmaid, her escaped prisoner ex-boyfriend (who always seems to make bad choices), and a requisite kid.  From the dervish emerges a female Martian in dominatrix garb who has come to dominate the Earth and transport its men, one by one, back to Mars as breeding stock.  It seems there was a gender war on the red planet.  The women won and the men eventually became reproductively useless.  So, MARS NEEDS MEN.  Devil Girl, who calls herself Nyah, spends her time trudging back and forth from her transport, always coming to brag about the Martian superiority in culture and weaponry.  Boy, does she like to talk.  Every time the Earthers try to get the upper hand they fail miserably.  The effects for the most part are lousy.  I've heard the spaceship described as a salad spinner and Nyah's awesome robot looks like an old-fashioned fridge.  The interior of the space vessel has pretty good weird lighting.  The talky goings-on sound more like a mild British Agatha Christie play.  One piece of priceless dialogue though; After Nyah has lowered the boom and says all at the inn are going to die the inn-keeper says, get this, ""Well, if we're all going to die we may as well have a cup of tea"".
