7818311,4,6301967011,"Here is yet another example of a very good classic-era film which has never been given a DVD treatment. Too bad because a lot of movie fans are missing out on a good crime film.

This kidnapping story has a unique, totally unexpected ending. It's also unusual in that almost all of the story takes place AFTER the ransom has been paid and the kidnap victim has been safely returned.

It also has a twist of nice couple being inadvertently involved in the crime. The crooks in here are entertaining to watch, particularly the leader ""Tobey,"" played well by Caesar Romero. Some of Romero's sidekicks are stupid but just makes them interesting to watch. One guy, however, is a little bit too nasty. (This gang is not the most brilliant but their stupidity makes the film more fun.)",1240531200,,778,4.630434782608695
