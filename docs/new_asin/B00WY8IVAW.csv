7155111,5,B00WY8IVAW,"I wouldn't say that Christianity is pushed in this film, but it is clear that faith and integrity are the message.  I expected it to be a fun film, but it was independently made so I thought it might not be as well produced as some of the other faith based movies. I turns out, I was wrong.  It exceeded my expectations.  My whole family liked the movie, and it is one we will own.  The movie was well written, it was funny, it can make you cry, and the resolution was one of my favorite parts.  After seeing this movie, I am surprised it was not released on a wider scale in the theaters.  It is very well written and produced.",1437609600,20,628,4.10655737704918
7155112,3,B00WY8IVAW,"Thank you Edify Media for this review copy.

It's tough to be a parent. There are so many responsibilities, so many ways to try to get it all right. Some people do it well. Some don't. Most of us are in between. Alexa, the mother, is a totally stressed out mom trying to look perfect at everything she does. Everything does look perfect, but it's all unraveling. She's unraveling.

My Family's Thoughts
- ""It wasn't that bad. I thought this was a football movie. It has football in it, but it wasn't a football movie.  It had a good message. It wasn't as bad as my family says it is."" Amy, 13
- ""I kept waiting for the show to start. I was bored. The acting was mediocre except the coach."" Michael, 15
- ""The movie was dull and uninteresting. It had a good message at the end, but it wasn't played up as well as it should have been; so the point was very weak."" Emily, 17
- ""The movie ended up with a good message. The quality of the movie was good, but until about the second half, I was still waiting for the movie to start."" Lowell, the dad

My Thoughts
- One thing I liked is that it showed how women have a tendency to try to look good in front of each other and not to be real with each other. That makes for shallow relationships. Worse, it makes for loneliness as we think we're the only ones with problems.
- It's blatantly Christian. That's something we need a lot more of in the movies.
- Doing the right thing is sometimes hard. This movie exemplifies that well.
- The beginning was weak and a bit ambiguous. We were halfway into the movie before I really had a good idea what was going on.
- I thought this was a football movie and invited my family to watch a football movie with me. So, we were expecting more action and less drama. If we had watched this movie with the idea that it was about a family going through hard times, we might have enjoyed it more. I give it 3 stars.

  What do you do when you child is caught drinking and is the star on the football team, your daughter is a straight A student and is so pressured she thinks of cheating on a final exam? Will you let it slid or do you bring it to the front? This DVD shows how having faith and doing what the Lord wants us to do is not always easy. You can either go the way of the crowd or do as Jesus wants us to do.
  Really enjoyed this DVD because it lets us know that life isn't always easy. We all have trials and temptations. No one is perfect.
  A good DVD to show us how we should live, not just going through the emotions. Highly recommended.

7155161,1,B00WY8IVAW,"Incredibly bad acting, cinematography, soundtrack, storyline flow, dialogue, believability. Obviously you're looking at this movie because you want a Christian film with a good/inspiring message but please save yourself the pain. If the Christian community continues to make such poor quality films then people will not take them seriously. Good message? Yes. Good delivery or build up? Absolutely not. The transformation that happens in many of the characters is forced, not developed, and out of the blue. Certain scenes are long, arduous, and unnecessary. Although the message says that God is enough, that isn't even talked about until the last 5 min. It also is contrasted with how literally every character has a pristine and near perfect/trendy outward appearance and every house is immaculate. The only difference between the characters we are supposed to view as a positive spiritual influence and the characters who are materialistic and obsessed about perfection is their lines.

If you like cheesy Christian films, I guess this will be okay for you. If you have any appreciation for good film and storytelling please stay away.",1463184000,,1139,5.3277777777777775

7155179,3,B00WY8IVAW,"I'm usually longsuffering with Christian films, but this one disappointed me. I was hoping to put it in our church library, but now I'm not sure it's the kind of Christian film I want to promote.  Yes, as mentioned by other reviewers, the acting isn't great, the football sequences are lame, and the actors look way too young to have teenage children.  I was more bothered and embarrassed by these two things:  1.  The immodest clothing of the female actors and 2. The small group study. I would hope that the ""Bible study"" the women in the film attend is not typical of the small group Bible study curriculum in your church--shallow, full of psychobabble, devoid of any biblical text, and full of trite, predictable conclusions--all of which made me groan.  (Okay, to be fair, in the first ""Bible Study"" scene, the women are offhandedly told to ""remember"" to read a passage of Scripture, but I can't quite figure how it had anything to do the topic.)
What DID come through in the film is the shallowness of keeping up with appearances, the damaging effects of perfectionism on individuals and families, and the importance of living with integrity (owning up to your failures and dealing with the consequences of your choices head-on).  You have to decide if those things redeem the film.",1452038400,,1288,4.7792792792792795

7155195,3,B00WY8IVAW,"This is a faith based film so it's more about the message and the story than anything else.  I enjoyed it for the most part.  The message of how superficial we can be and how silly it looks is fairly well told in the movie.

There were some distracting issues however.  The sound track was at times too loud and you can't hear conversations at several points in the movie.  The football action sequences were shockingly bad but it did not really effect the story.  Football was more of a background issue.  The story appears at first glance to be about the young man but it's entirely about the parents and the mother specifically.

Another thing I didn't like and I see this often.  The parents in the film were distractingly young to have late teen children.  the Mother in particular looks to be about 26 years old and dresses in clothing you don't expect to see on the mother of teenagers.  I actually looked up the actress and she technically could be the parent of a 17 year old if she got pregnant at 17 herself.  Bottom line is that if this story is about real people then real people  don't have time to live in the gym or the money for fancy organic diets.  Yes, the years do show on us.  I think if you're going to cast parents in a film they need to at least look something like parents.

For that matter everyone in the movie was distractingly attractive.  It reminded me of the scene in the ""Last Action Hero"" where the boy is asking Schwarzenegger if it ever occurred to him why every woman in his world looked like a runway model.  Even the checkout girl at the movie rental shop.",1445385600,3,1596,4.33445945945946

7155219,5,B00WY8IVAW,"I'm relieved. I really enjoyed this, and feel I can recommend it pretty broadly.  Let me tell you how rare a thing that is :)

I'm excited about this - even more so now that I've seen the film.  Here's some context:  I'm a Christian.  I love God, but I find a lot of what gets tagged ""Christian"" to be thoroughly embarrassing.  Although I rarely initiate, I often find myself in situations where people ask about my faith and I share freely how amazing God is.  His love has completely changed me.  However, I know that I'm never going to be called to force others to see things as I do. God is pretty amazing - he doesn't need salespeople.  :)  It's incredibly important to me that Christians are honest - not fake, not trying to sell God, and not thinking more highly of themselves than of any other broken person in this world.  Thinking like that only gets in the way of God's work.  He shines brightest in our lives when we ""fail,"" when we're broken, and when it's obvious that we need his forgiveness (2 corinthians 4).  I don't think anything else would really match the grace of God or the life of Jesus.

On that note I have high praise for this movie.

While I've seen a number of clearly-Christian films, most fail my ""I could recommend this to anyone"" test. Many others in the genre/subculture set up a cliche, false scenario in which nonbelievers attack believers, in which society is ""out to get us,"" or in which science and faith conflict somehow and a person has to sacrifice one or the other (which I think is an underinformed misunderstanding).  To portray this persecuted perception doesn't match my reality, nor does it quite match the gospel.  Rather, it perpetuates an ""us""/""them"" narrative that runs counter to the words of my hero, Jesus.

Thankfully, some movie makers get it. They get people like me.  Thankfully, there are huge numbers of Christian artists who see the truth and portray it honestly in their work. I think you guys did it right.

I like that the protagonists aren't perfect. Perfection is a myth that separates people from truth.

I like that we saw them struggle with choosing the right path. It's not always clear what to do.

I like the honesty about emotional distance from God and changing relationships with people.  Nothing is more real.

I liked the sass.  :)

Some room for improvement: I think some bits of acting could have been more subtle with the same effect - mostly toward the beginning of the movie. I think it could also have been more subtle that this or that person is a believer, with the same impact. Not a big deal, just a tweak.

My husband and I liked that the situation is very true to real life - we may go through this ourselves, one day.  Great choice to make it real.

I think this nailed it - this is what it feels like to make a tough choice or be somewhat misunderstood for prioritizing integrity.  This is what it feels like to put God's priorities above image or reputation.

Ok, so I chose to call this review ""catching hope.""  Why?  (I know, groan, right?)  Because I'm relieved to see a Christian movie that I liked.  I did not facepalm once. It gives me hope that we're getting more honest, more real, more in touch with our universal need for God.  It gives me hope that, in time, the stereotypes people assign to me when they hear that I'm a believer will look a bit less like Ned Flanders and a bit more like Jesus.  When my hero met a woman with a ruined reputation he didn't look down on her or exclude her - he said, ""I can tell you are very thirsty. Let me give you something that truly fulfills.""  I caught glimpses of that in your characters. Thank you.

Thanks for getting real, guys. If you make another movie, please get even more real/gritty - it'll do a lot of good.  :)  Continue to ""tell it like it is.""",1439856000,6,3801,4.4193083573487035

7155221,2,B00WY8IVAW,"I was excited to buy this movie, but was extremely disappointed with the purchase after watching it. It was extremely slow, and the story line seemed like it was out of place. I never felt a connection, or a full understanding for any character. I kept waiting for it to get better, and it didn't. It really shouldn't be considered a football movie, which the cover, and the presentation promotes it to be. There were a bunch of characters that were extremely annoying, which was a turn off! The grandma was the funniest person in the movie, but her parts were few and far between. I'm bummed that it wasn't what I anticipated. I was hoping for another great movie plot, something comparable to: Facing the Giants, Fireproof, The Blindside, etc. Not even close.",1439769600,,761,4.686567164179104
7155222,5,B00WY8IVAW,"I love indie films! Catching Faith might be a faith-based spiritual movie, but don't let the catchy title fool you. It has a relevant message for everyone of any faith or belief system. What is most important to you? We are all the same in this world with daily temptations, doubts, and fears that can change your future forever, depending upon your integrity and what you decide to do. The well-written story gives us so many compelling examples of choices we all face and the consequences of our actions. Without throwing in any spoilers, I empathized and fell in love with this family and their friends as they grew in so many ways.

I loved the setting of this movie because it was shot in northwestern Wisconsin, showcasing the small-town beauty of not only the communities that make up the Chippewa Valley area, but also the lovely people. It is amazing to learn of so many talented locals being used in this professional production, and then seeing every single person listed in the credits!

Catching Faith is a feel-good family movie shot in what I consider a gorgeous all-American setting. I hope this indie movie gets a wide release, as it has a wide appeal!
