8043545,3,B0006V7MAE,"Shakespeare the Animated Tales - Hamlet (VHS) reviewed Jan 02, 2008

I began collecting Shakespeare on film after teaching a unit to junior high students, and I became aware of ""The Animated Shakespeare"" as I looked for movie versions of the Bard's works. This series of half-hour versions of Shakespeare plays is available for Hamlet, the Tempest, Midsummer Night's Dream, about half a dozen titles altogether, and in various media- ""claymation"", or your more conventional animated cartoon, as with the present case of Hamlet.

The story is compressed into 30 minutes fairly well- most of the highlights and the story events are there, enough to give a child the impression that he ""knows"" the story. The danger here is that he may never go further into Hamlet, imagining there is no more of value to pursue. But used as an introduction, to give context prior to reading particular scenes, it can be very helpful, as well as an aid to ""Cultural Literacy"" (E.D.Hirsch's concept of what we need to know to get along in our culture).

The style of animation was not entirely pleasing to me. Dominated by dull blues and grays, the video could have been more appealing visually. There was also a tendency toward indistinct lines in the animation. Whether this was due to an artistic attempt to reflect Hamlet's mental world, or to going easy on expenses, I could not decide.

Still, if you teach grades 3 to college, or have children at home, or need yourself some help with baby steps into Shakespeare, this is a worthwhile video to have. This series is often available in European formats for video or dvd, so avoid the mistake I made and make sure the version you buy is compatible with your player. They can be expensive- I've seen $25 asked for the half-hour video, and I waited until I found one for less than ten. I'm still waiting for others in the series.",1524009600,,1860,4.713846153846154
