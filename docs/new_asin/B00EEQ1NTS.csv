8604817,2,B00EEQ1NTS,"Daniel (Adrian Bellani) appears to be a detective who has re-opened a cold case file. He is searching for the killer of Isabel (Catalina Rodriquez). He is seen interviewing the five leading suspects as they recall her life up to that fateful evening. This is followed by a stupid ending. The interviews are shown concurrently as subplots.

The film attempts to make a statement about women involved in prostitution and how bad it is for those who don't have the Internet to sell themselves. The poor acting, dialogue, and plot prevented any statement from coming through.

This is a grindhouse without any of the killing and action scenes. It was boring in spite of all the naked strippers.
