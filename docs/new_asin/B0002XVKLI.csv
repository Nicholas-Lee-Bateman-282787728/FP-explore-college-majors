2137269,5,B0002XVKLI,"Loving this DVD! I picked it up for my 19 month old daughter after really enjoying the first of the ""Praise Baby"" DVDs, and evidently we've hit gold again.

My daughter is a sweet child, but NOT a cuddler, yet she'll sit down and snuggle with me while we watch the show together.  If for nothing else, I'll give it 5 stars just for that reason alone!

She points to the visuals, particularly the babies and children and babbles at me in her gobbledy-gook language, and we have a great time just sitting, listening, singing, talking, and spending time together while praising God. Couldn't ask for a better moment in life!  I find it helpful, particularly when she's too wound up and it's time to settle down for bed.

Now, while I love the visuals (simple, clean, fun) and the music (wonderful vocalist...very nice kid's choir and music, none of which gets on my nerves)...the video has little to offer of direct instructional value (ala Baby Einstein, or Baby Faith's God Made Me, etc).

However, as it shows children playing joyfully and matches that to great praise music aimed at the very young, I'm very pleased with the purchase, and hope the board books they offer are a preview of future DVDs in the works!!!",1110153600,18,1216,4.632558139534884
2137270,5,B0002XVKLI,"Not being a fan of TV watching for babies, it took me a long time to actually use this DVD. I wish that I put it on earlier!  My baby is 9 months old and has been captivated by this video for the last few months.  NOTHING distracts her when she watches it, and the praise music certainly calms her down.  Baby Einstein videos are more fast-paced, but my baby can't follow the multiple images. Plus, I'm not sure that the fast pace is healthy for babies.  The Praise Baby DVDs use ""real life"" videos of animals, babies, toys, and other images which are more captivating than the ""slide show"" technique of showing pictures of animals that Baby Einstein uses on some of their videos.  Many babies are facinated by watching other babies, and the Praise Baby collection offers plenty of ""baby watching"" time! I highly recommend this video, especially for times that you want your baby to calm down and relax.

UPDATE: Still love the DVD...what I forgot to mention earlier is the music. Listening to cartoons or Barney can get annoying, but it's so great to turn on this DVD and only hear praise music throughout my house. Calms the baby and the mom! :)",1109116800,6,1147,4.516908212560386
2137271,5,B0002XVKLI,"My wife and I use this DVD and a way to relax our WILD 18 month old son and to start calming him down at the end of the day. This DVD truely put's him at peace, at least while the DVD is on, and the sweet music is truely something that we don't mind listening to almost every day. Our son watches this DVD intently and says ""baby!""...""baby!"" as he loves to watch the other children in the video.",1105574400,3,395,3.95
2137272,3,B0002XVKLI,"I know this product claims to be for babies, but it feels like it is really for toddlers or even older.  Whereas the God Made Me video is very engaging and the closest to the most popular baby videos on the market - but with bible verses, Praise Baby is a bunch of music videos with modern worship music (which my oldest knows but the little ones don't understand at all) with no real developmental techniques or creative transitions to keep the baby's attention.  It's just shots of kids playing on a green screem and a silly bird animation.  My girls just walk away after a few minutes.  Not very engaging.  Not sure what the intent was but it looks like it was just jumping on the ""baby"" bandwagon.",1104105600,3,701,4.403100775193798

Just loved the music and way it captures a baby's attention. Unlike other series this one makes strong attempt to show diversity with babies of all races and capabilities. Ultimately love the videos and would recommend over Baby Einstein line. Within the praise baby series the top 3 are... my fathers world, followed by this one (god of wonders), then joy to the world.",1476144000,,529,4.520833333333333

2137323,3,B0002XVKLI,I bought this product based on the reviews but I was very disappointed when I watched it. The music is good (which is why I gave 3 stars) and the kids seem to enjoy it however the visuals are not very stimulating and they are very generic. I don't think it was thought out well enough for me to purchase any more of this product. So glad I did not buy the whole set.,1404691200,,366,3.9594594594594597

2137325,5,B0002XVKLI,"This is such a great DVD. It has very sweet,  soothing worship music.  All of the songs are familiar hymns both ancient and modern. The pictures and video seems a little dated in some spots because it is a bit older however it keeps my boys attention.  It's a nice DVD to play right before bed or just to wind down. One feature that I really like...there's an option to play with an adult singing the songs, children singing or just instrumental music so that's great to mix things up and offer variety to your children with different sounds. They love it and I do too. What a great way to introduce worship in the home!

The video also features both able bodied and disabled children.  I am special education teacher and I value all life and all abilities.  I think it's great to show all children and not just those considered typical.",1402012800,,837,4.437908496732026

2137337,5,B0002XVKLI,Got this as a gift from my husbands co-worker after the birth of our twins. They loved watching it and listening to the music. They would even stop crying once I put it on. I had to order one for my granddaughter. Love it and think everyone should have one.,1393200000,,257,4.16
2137338,5,B0002XVKLI,"These dvd's are wonderful.  They are enjoyable for our littlest granddaughter, but also for two older girls, mom and dad and gram, too.  So beautiful to watch and the music is soothing.",1391212800,,185,4.75
2137339,5,B0002XVKLI,"These movies are enchanting my little on has loved Praise Baby since she was about 2 months old and continues to love them at 17 months old. The sooth her in a way that I cannot even explain. Worship music set to fun vivid images it great for your little one's attention span and interest. Now that she is older we interact more with DVD by talking about what is in the pictures. These movies are life savers. I must say they enchant the baby in sense. We can having a full blown fit, put in Praise Baby and everything calms down, as soon as she hears the logo music she is looking for the TV. I also ordered the music on discs for the car and it has a similar effect.

Introducing music into your baby's life is easy with Praise Baby. Many discs have multiple features including different vocal tracks: adult, children and even instrumental tracks. Some also have a repeat option - which I use on occasion so we can hear the calming music during our day, most of the time we are not even in the room.

I highly recommend this product, there are many well know Praise songs, this disc has some of my favorites and I know your baby will love them too. One of my favorite memories is my 4 month old singing along with Praise Baby!",1391126400,,1228,4.243589743589744

2137344,5,B0002XVKLI,All four of my children have watched and LOVED Praise Baby. It's equivalent to baby Einstein but with worship music. From birth they have all been captivated by it...and they will still sit and watch it and sing along at 4 years old. I love that the worship music is nourishing their soul. We have also used it in my church's nursery to sooth the babies as they come in. I recommend this to all my friends with babies!,1378425600,,418,4.30379746835443

2137357,5,B0002XVKLI,I give this at every baby shower as it is simply magical. Starting with my granddaughter and every baby after... This DVD is mesmerizing!  Baby Einstein DVDs don't hold a candle to these. And the music is so pleasing to adults to listen to over and over. Highly recommend!,1376697600,,272,4.551020408163265
2137358,5,B0002XVKLI,"We have used this series a lot with grand kids!  The DVDs enhance a quiet atmosphere that calms our little ones.  We have often had little ones (age 1 to 5) get into little squabbling times . . . putting on these DVDs draws them to watch and have their spirits ministered to, their squabbles ending.  Must admit I enjoy the music as background as well!  We  have a set of three DVDs and enjoy them all about equally.  The real delight is when the little ones start singing some of the gentle worship music on their own!",1374278400,,519,4.244897959183674

2137364,5,B0002XVKLI,"Honestly, when we first saw the DVD I thought it was dumb. the images don't quite match up to the lyrics of the music. But at 18months with teething molars we finally let the babies watch this DVD once per day. They LOVE LOVE LOVE this video and now ask for it. We don't watch DVDs for developmental purposes, but this DVD is very calm, not too flashy and has many basic shapes, symbols, and imagery. They are captivated and sit calmly watching it. The music is very calming and will interrupt the ""fussies"". Frankly the music is calming to me as I'm racing around the house cleaning up. the lyrics beautiful and just gives us a peaceful atmosphere for a few minutes. HIGHLY recommend especially for those who aren't interested in overstimulating their children.",1363824000,,762,4.651851851851852

2137385,5,B0002XVKLI,"My 14-month old twins have been watching this DVD since they were about 9 months old and they love it! They have not gotten tired of it at all. The familiar worship music is great for them (and me!) to listen to and really helps create an atmosphere of peace and worship in our home. The images are stimulating for them (nature scenes, babies & kids, toys, animals, etc.)  My children sometimes cry or get upset watching Baby Einstein or Brainy Baby, but this has NEVER happened with any Praise Baby videos.  This was the first one we purchased and it has prompted us to buy several more.  While this video often holds their attention for the entire length (about 30 minutes), there are other times when they'll play with toys or look at books while the music plays in the background. Either way, it's so helpful for me to have a few minutes to clean up, prepare meals, etc., while still feeling like my boys are being blessed and edified.

Like all the Praise Baby DVDs, the special features allow you to choose whether you want to listen to children or adults singing, which is a nice option to have.  We love Praise Baby!  Next we need to check out the books and CDs!",1285200000,2,1170,4.4186046511627906

The pictures on the video are exactly what she loves to watch: children and babies playing, animals, colors, etc.  I am so glad there are videos made for younger children that expose them to God's love and creation.  The music on the DVD's are soothing (it is a great tool to calm her before her nap, and it works every time!)  and it exposes her to praise and worship music outside of church.

2137401,3,B0002XVKLI,"My son doesn't care for these DVD's.  They are more easy going and relaxed sounding.  He likes more of upbeat music.  Good songs though.  Overall, C- rating for me!",1230336000,,164,4.551724137931035
2137402,5,B0002XVKLI,"I first found the Praise Baby series at a local Christian bookstore, and purchased one. However, the cost was prohibitive, so I was unable to get the entire set- until I found them here! They are SO good!!
My son is absolutely entranced with every one of these in the series, but this one in particular (perhaps because it's the newest to him) seems to be his favorite. He's 13 months old now, but has been watching them- as I sing along to the songs and get some housework done while he's at it!- since he was only 5 months old, and he loved them just as much then.
Now, however, he laughs back when it shows the babies in the film laughing, he'll play ""peekaboo"" along with the actors, and bobs his head to the music.",1210982400,,719,4.255474452554744
2137403,5,B0002XVKLI,"Having noticed the way my daughter loved watching the ""Praises and Smiles"" DVD we already had, I decdied to purchase this DVD for her 2md birthday.  I was not disappointed.  This DVD captures her interest as much as the other DVD and I find the uplifting songs to be a much more useful way for her to learn the songs we do in church, than just hearing them at church.  Having listened to her try to sing the songs from ""Praises and Smiles"", I know she will pick these ones up as well.
If your child is a music-lover, this DVD will be a great addition to any collection.",1198972800,,569,4.201834862385321
2137404,5,B0002XVKLI,"My one year old daughter loves this DVD.  I got it for her birthday and it has been the first thing for us to really let her intentionally watch on the TV.  As soon as it comes on, she just stops what she's doing and looks to the TV.  She will even climb up in my lap and sit still through a couple songs.

The songs have good vocals and production.  It sounds like a normal adult praise CD that I would have listened to before I had kids, so I find it very enjoyable too.",1194652800,,472,3.875
2137405,5,B0002XVKLI,I much prefer these movies to the Baby Einstein movies.  I love that my children are listening to praise music.  And if I don't want my children to watch TV we just listen to the music without the TV on. It is also very uplifting for me to listen to while my children are playing.,1189296000,,280,4.072727272727272
2137406,5,B0002XVKLI,"We started watching this to calm my older baby on a long car ride, but then found that he loved it so much we watched more often.  My 3 year old began memorizing words to worship songs and at 4 is still happy to watch it with toddler brother (who asks for it more often than is probably good to be staring at a screen!)  I enjoy that my car is filled with songs I want in my head, and in my children's heads, rather than just silly Wiggles music or even Silly Songs with Larry (which can just drive you batty sometimes)",1173916800,,519,4.029126213592233
2137407,5,B0002XVKLI,My daughter loves the Praisebaby DVD!  It was a great price and great quality.  Thank you for making it easy for us to find this product and giving us a great deal!,1156809600,,164,4.09375
2137408,5,B0002XVKLI,"Our 13 month old son LOVES this DVD!  He doesn't watch TV at home, but on long car rides, we'll pop this in as a treat.  The music is beautiful.  My husband and I enjoy listening to it as he enjoys the visuals as well.  The images are mostly ""real"" kids, nature scenes, and animals.  We received this as a gift and have loved it!  This is a great alternative to the Einstein videos if you're looking for one with Christian music.  We've just purchased the other two for a little variety.  :)",1151280000,3,491,4.204301075268817
2137409,5,B0002XVKLI,"This is the first DVD I've purchased for my 41/2 month old daughter.  I must say I was extremely pleased with the music and the way it caught my little one's attention!  She watched almost the whole thing, about 25 minutes!!  I was wondering how good the music was going to be.  I would actually buy the CD and listen to it in the car anytime.  I thought it was going to be cheesy music, but it is actually really good! I would recommend this DVD.",1147046400,,447,4.151162790697675
2137410,5,B0002XVKLI,"My daughter is 14 months old and has been watching this DVD for a few months now. It is by far her favorite. I tried a few other movies baby genius, baby faith and a few cartoons. Nothing held her attention like baby praise. from the time it starts untill its over she will not move. She seeems to be amazed by every thing in it. I think for her the biggest difference between baby praise and other movies/shows is that it sings all the way thru the entire movie, and she loves music. For me the best part is, it is educational, it sends a positive message, and it is only about 30 mins long. I personally don't want my daughter to be glued to the tv for long periods of time.",1141344000,,676,4.090225563909774
2137411,5,B0002XVKLI,"This video has been my childs favorite for the past several months. I always lay out at least 3 videos for her to choose from including Baby Einstein, and almost everytime she goes for Praise Baby (if not for Dora the Explorer). :D

This video is great! I also like that it's not quite as pyschedelic and spazzy as Baby Einstein. There is definitely a sweetness of the Spirit with this video. I would encourage you to pick it up for your child.",1137888000,2,444,4.349397590361446
2137412,5,B0002XVKLI,"I have a 5 month old for whom I have purchased several Baby Einstein, Baby Faith, and Baby Praise DVDs.  While I would consider all of the ones that I own to be good and have merit, this DVD is the best of the bunch.  It captivates him more than any other.  Personally, I enjoy watching it myself.  This DVD teaches him contemporary and traditional Christian music with stimulating sights that will help him learn perspectives.  If you only buy one, this is it -- hands down the best of the ""baby"" DVDs, and you'll enjoy it yourself.",1134259200,16,533,4.3979591836734695
2137413,5,B0002XVKLI,"My 8 month old never watches t.v., but when I put this DVD in she was captivated. I was very reluctant to let her start watching t.v., but the slow moving screen and praise songs convinced me. I feel like I have the radio on and she is learning at such a young age to praise the Lord. This is a great product.",1133913600,5,309,3.9206349206349205
2137414,1,B0002XVKLI,"I got this video thinking it would be like the baby faith videos with fun and creative elements for learing development.  My baby watched about two mintues and was gone.  I think this is pitched as a baby video but it's really more geared toward older children.  None of the elements have anything to do with the music, making is virtually useless as a learning development product.  I give it a big ""thumbs down"".  Try any one of the baby faith products like God Made Me, God Made Music and God Made Animals.  They're awesome!",1130976000,3,527,4.494736842105263
2137415,5,B0002XVKLI,"This is the second Praise Baby DVD that we have purchased. Our 17 month old daughter loves these DVDs! In fact, all our kids, ages 9 years to 17 months, enjoy these DVDs. The songs are so uplifting and the pictures are very interesting to little ones and adults alike! This DVD has some songs that I have never heard before as well as many old favorites. I highly recommend this as being a good thing for your baby and for your family.",1125273600,5,435,4.253012048192771
2137416,5,B0002XVKLI,I just want to put my two cents in on the value of God of Wonders.  My 7 month old has been listening to the Praise Baby CDs since he was a newborn.  He is absolutely enthralled by both the God of Wonders DVD and the Praises and Smiles DVD.  The music and imagery are beautiful on both.  My son particularly loves the images of children playing.  He recognizes all the songs already which I think has provided a wonderful foundation for his future spiritual development.,1122163200,16,470,4.4186046511627906

8034308,5,B0002XVKLI,"My toddler boy loves all of the praise baby dvds. The music/worship is lovely, soft and gentle and well enunciated - helping him to learn the words. The videos feature babies, toddlers, playgrounds, dogs, cats, toys - all recognizable things.",1512950400,,242,5.075
8034309,5,B0002XVKLI,"Purchased for our church nursery.  A wonderful way to introduce the little ones to praise and worship!
