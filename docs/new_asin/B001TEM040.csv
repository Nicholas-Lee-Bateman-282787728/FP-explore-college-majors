8341113,3,B001TEM040,"This is an OK purchase if you're a big fan of Mr. Werner (as I am).  It's no substitute for the book, though.  Further, you won't get anything out of this that isn't already in the book.",1366675200,,186,4.0

I bought this dvd and the book that Kenny has put out; and it has changed my life.  I tried hypnosis, CBT, meditation, and other products on amazon, but nothing has worked like this product. It really hit hit home in my playing and now in my life.  I am so happy that I found this.  Thank you so much for putting the fun back into my music.",1308009600,2,500,4.166666666666667

It's very insightful and helpful.",1289088000,,148,4.730769230769231
8341116,5,B001TEM040,"My husband, a professional musician really loved this DVD, which was a Christmas present from me.  It was easy to choose this gift!  He has read Kenny Werner's book, Effortless Mastery so often, we are on our 3rd or 4th copy...they become so dog-eared that the pages begin to fall out.  He says that his playing continues to improve each time he reads it.  I'm not sure how it works but it seems to!",1264291200,2,399,4.351351351351352
8341117,5,B001TEM040,"This is the second DVD from Kenny Werner's Effortless mastery series.  The first, is just over an hour long and features Kenny speaking in front of a group of about 100 or so people talking, in brief, about the concepts of Effortless Mastery.  This DVD however is much more informative in the specifics of the process in achieving Effortless Mastery.  And when I say theirs more info., I mean their is tons more info.  Kenny describes in great detail, each of the '4 steps', how to effortlessly practice, even for a small amount of time, how to attain and retain 'the Space' and muuuuch more!  Theirs even a sweet live performance of Kenny with his trio at some smokey, awesome looking Jazz club in NYC.

Simply put, if you want to begin a journey of putting an end to strain and pain while practicing, playing and creating, and incorporate magic and be at top of your musical game and ALWAYS be able to continue to efficiently grow for the rest of your musical life...  Get this DVD!

Also get Kenny's book entitled 'Effortless Mastery'.  Enjoy growing!  :D",1259798400,6,1058,4.609625668449198
