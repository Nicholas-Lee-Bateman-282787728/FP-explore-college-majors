555641,3,6303092306,"This movie is only good to make up the set if you intend on buying all five of them, other wise avoid it because it is the weakest of the lot. Death Wish 1 to 4 are great. Part 5 does not really have much action and if that's what your looking for, check out parts 3 and 4.
Once again, as in the others, Kersey loses his partner to street scum. The leader of this gang is played by Parks who is usually a good actor, but he's not that good in this. In any case, Kersey puts a lid on him in the end by throwing him into hot watery wax. Another thing, Parks is such a ratbag in this his own daughter likes Kersey better. Can't say I blame her. Her father did have her mother killed.",1046390400,,680,3.8642857142857143
555642,3,6303092306,"Hey, I was glad when I saw previews for this way back when.  Charles Bronson, who was something like 72 when this flick was made, was back.  God bless the man.
I think that the original Death Wish was a very powerful and relevant film.  As for the sequels, hey, they're for Bronson addicts, period.  Part II was exploitation pure and simple, Part III was ridiculous and highly enjoyable, Part IV was going through the motions, and Part V...?  Well, let's just say that Paul Kersey is back.  Period.
Yeah, he's still an architect.  But he's just THAT close to taking up his night job, which is vigilante extraordinaire.  By now, he's a very seasoned pro.  So when some mobsters whack out his girlfriend, he's goes on the offesive and starts doing the cops' work without the whole civil rights problem, etc.
Bronson's revenge is swift and violent.  He poisons a canolli, he blows up a soccer ball in someone's face, he kills.  Period.
Is the film any good?  Naturally, no.  This is low budget.  Heck, even the film stock looks crusty.  But it's a Death Wish sequel, and even fans won't expect more than the usual.  Paul Kersey tries to live a normal life, but gosh-darn-it, he winds up being the vigilante, yet again.  Someone's gotta do it.
This is not the best Death Wish sequel.  That honor may be taken by III.  But it's watchable.  It's Bronson.  Nuff said.",1028764800,12,1360,4.560165975103734
555643,4,6303092306,"No joke Charles Bronson's Death Wish V is a enjoyable thrilride from start to finnish. Paul Kersey has been retired from the viglante game for several years now is a professer of Arctitecture and has found love and is about to get married. But somehow fate won't leave Kersey alone His girlfried's ex big time mobster Tommy o Shea tries to take over her fashion empire, she goes sees the District attorny ends up with her face disfigued and is killed. Bronson shows more acting ablity this time around and the action is well staged and less idiotic than in previous Death Wish films. Michael Parks is a meanicing presence with a bad haircut, & dopey looking eyewear. This is only Death Wish Entry worth remembering next to the original Death Wish.",998870400,,747,4.666666666666667

555648,2,6303092306,"How sad that a great series should come to such a pathetic end. Why Charlie agreed to do this one is a mystery. But if they had to make it, couldn't they at least have made it ""business as usual""(Bloody  & action-packed)?. -It's so tame;  the preview-audience must have been  grannies, telling them to go back and change a few things(""wouldn't an  exploding soccer-ball be fun ?"", ""or how about a poisonous  pancake ?"".) No doubt the filmmakers feared the cencors here, or maybe  they thought too explicit violence is a thing of the past. -How right they  were; a hitman with dandruff is just what we wanted !.

555649,1,6303092306,"As a committed ""Death Wish"" fan, it is a shame that it all had to end with this poorly paced, mind-numbingly dull piece of trash. Bronson is barely alive this time around, and as evidence of his death-like  fatigue, his killings are less enjoyable and not at all hilarious. He has  resorted to using deadly soccer balls and poisoned Italian food. What  happened to the big guns? The outrageous stunts? And, what's worse, he once  again has a gorgeous woman in his life that dies before the opening  credits. Haven't these women seen the other films? Besides, who could fall  in love with a mute murderer? No action, no laughs, no guilty satisfaction;  just an unfortunate cure for insomnia.",925430400,3,690,4.7478991596638656

Directed by Allan A. Goldstein. Written by Brian Garfield (characters), Michael Colleary, Allan A. Goldstein.
  The fifth and last ""Death Wish"" movie with Charles Bronson.

Paul is back living in New York under a different name. Today, He is walking in the garment district to a Fashion Show by Olivia Regent (Lesley-Ann Down), his lady-friend. He sits next to her daughter, Chelsea (Erica Lancaster). Backstage in the model's dressing room is Tom O'Shea (Michael Parks) who is Olivia's ex-husband. Tom has brought his goons (Kevin Lund, Chuck Shamata) as if Olivia doesn't have enough problems. Tom gets rough with Olivia's wrist. He doesn't like seeing that ""geek"" sitting with his daughter. Olivia reminds her ex-husband that he lost custody of her.
  Tom and his goons give the supervisor/manager Albert (Jefferson Mappin) a rough time. They get destructive with property in the factory and then sends all the factory workers out of the room. Tom makes Albert lay on a table and they make fun of his fat, then he is cut by a machine. A black worker, Reggie (Michael Dunston) tries to help Albert, but he is cut with a knife.
  Paul and Olivia walk into the room. Tom pulls a gun on Paul. Just then, Chelsea walks in and everything stops. Albert is taken into a police car for a trip to the hospital. Chelsea points out the blood on the machinery.
  Paul receives a visit from Chief Prosecutor Brian Hoyle, (Saul Rubinek) to help stop Olivia's ex-husband from destroying her business and hurting others.

 Since this is the last movie, I won't say anything else. Enjoy the movie.

556361,3,6303092306,"Death Wish 5: The Face of Death has one thing going for it the others in the Death Wish franchise don't have.  In #5, Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) begins using methods other than guns to extract his revenge.

In The Face of Death, Kersey is engaged to Olivia Regent (Leslie-Ann Down), ex-wife of mob guy Tommy O'Shea (Michael Parks).  O'Shea sees dollar signs in the ex's business and he wants part of it.  Have you ever noticed being Kersey's love interest is hazardous to one's health?  Anyway, Olivia is shot in her apartment and Kersey yet again dons the persona of the Vigilante.

The storyline is so familiar you don't really need to know much more.  Again, however, the new addition to the franchise is ""how"" are they going to die?

556548,2,6303092306,"My title is the last line, in the last entry in the 20 year, 5 film DEATH WISH series, which finds vigilante-killer-by-night/architect-by-day Paul Kersey settled into a new life, and a new identity this time as ""Professor Paul Stewart"", back in New York City - the locale for series entries 1 and 3.  As you might guess, his attitude towards the cops - and theirs towards him - has mellowed more than a bit by the end of this one; you might almost say that it sounds like the promise of a new beginning.  I have to ask though, what does it say about the rest of America that Kersey only wants to cure crime in it's two biggest coastal cities, huh?  What about my hometown of Chicago?  We could have used it - and hey, we're a great city for an architect.  But I digress....

Once again the aging Kersey (73-year-old Charles Bronson) has a lovely younger girlfriend with a young daughter, and if you've been following the series it's not much of a spoiler to say that Something Bad will happen to the new Kersey family. In this film, it's Lesley-Anne Down as Olivia Regent, a fashion designer and clothing store owner whose ex-husband Tommy O'Shea (Michael Parks) just happens to be a gangster who extorts protection money and runs money laundering operations out of the whole New York garment district. How does Kerstey find these people?  And what does it say about the women of the DEATH WISH cycle that Regent would ever be with a scumbag like O'Shea - and would then end up with his opposite number, Kersey?  Oh well, that's part of the fantasy I guess.  Anyway, Olivia's business isn't making him enough dough and when he puts the squeeze on her and her people, it comes to our vigilante's attention.  But not soon enough for his new family-to-be; getting close to Kersey is really a sign that you have a death wish yourself.

Having Olivia dispensed with in short order, it's time for Kersey to go back into vengeance mode, but this time he's barely hindered at all by his old friend the DA (Saul Rubinek, probably the best element in this snoozer) or the cop in charge of the O'Shea investigation (Kenneth Walsh). Ol' Paul is free to start wasting O'Shea's men by means of cyanide-laced cannoli (it's an Italian gang, see - except for the Irish guy who heads it; yeah that happens all the time), exploding soccer balls, and at the climax a vat of lye. Everything's pretty much by-the-numbers here, Bronson looks less interested than he did in previous installments if possible and doesn't contribute much in the way of action - hey, he's 73! - and director Allan A. Goldstein doesn't contribute anything interesting in terms of camerawork or narrative.  Goldstein mostly did TV work, and this is by far his best-known project, so that tells you something. Rubinek is always fun to watch and we also get some solid character work from Robert Joy as eccentric mobster lieutenant Freddy ""Flakes"" but really neither the numbers of the body count nor the methods are enough payoff to be worth the effort of watching this.  Even the final action sequence in the garment factory is as lethargic as the star himself.

Obviously some fans are being less critical than I am - hey, I enjoyed the flick, just like I enjoy all of them, but I've got to call it as I see it, which is a pretty poor chunk of filmmaking that isn't more than just watchable for even a Bronson fan like me.  Certainly it's the weakest by a good margin of the five films, and the mediocre bare-bones full-screen transfer we have here does it no favor.  As I said in my review of the previous film, it would be great if we could have a nice box set of all 5 films, in widesceen transfers with some extras and commentaries, as we have in Warner Brothers' recent DIRTY HARRY set.  But the DEATH WISH series still has an aura of the disreputable about it, so even if the multiple studios that own the rights could agree on it, I'm not sure it would be likely to happen.  Oh well.  This was Charles Bronson's last film appearance; he deserved better, and so do we.  RIP Chuck.",1290038400,,4041,4.50958904109589
556549,1,6303092306,"Most people don't even know there was a Death Wish 4, let alone a Death Wish 5: The Face of Death, and not without good reason. Made primarily for the video market and shot on the ultra-cheap in Canada standing in for New York by the director of 2001: A Space Travesty (Bronson's salary accounted for more than half the budget and from the results it doesn't look like he was paid that much), its sole distinctions are the lowest body count in the series and in being Bronson's last theatrical feature. It feels more like a Death Wish ripoff where the producers suddenly found out they could afford Bronson and gave it a quick rewrite, with Kersey now in the witness protection programme back in New York happily engaged to Lesley Anne Down's fashion designer and bad Joan Collins impersonator. You just know how that will end up, especially since her ex-husband is Michael Sacks' mobster, who seems to be basing his performance on William Shatner impersonating Jack Nicholson in Prizzi's Honor.

It's not long before Robert Joy's transvestite enforcer with dandruff is scarring her face to prevent her testifying to Saul Rubinek's DA and not that long before Bronson's much younger stunt man with different colored hair is dodging bullets and she's giving him another excuse to take the law into his own hands after taking flying lessons off the roof. A puffy Bronson is starting to look so like Oliver Hardy when he smiles you almost expect him to say ""That's another fine killing spree you've gotten me into,"" and with newspaper headlines like `Chicki Paconi killed by Canoli' it's clear that the film aspires to a more comedic approach. It doesn't succeed. It's just about watchable if you're grimly determined to make it through the entire series, but there's little here to repay the effort.",1287619200,,1797,4.815533980582524
556550,2,6303092306,"Architect Paul Kersey has certainly had a hard life, as his everyone he has loved or cared about has been taken from him, usually in a violent and traumatic manner.  His wife was killed in the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Wish/dp/B0000541AN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Wish</a>&nbsp;(1974), and then he tragically lost his daughter in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Wish-2/dp/B0000YEEQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Wish 2</a>&nbsp;(1982).  In the succeeding films, friends and the women he is involved with, usually experience violent deaths.

That unfortunate trend continues in Death Wish V: The Face of Death (1994), as a 73-year old Charles Bronson, returns for the final installment in the Death Wish series.  Seven years after&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Wish-4-The-Crackdown/dp/B0000YEERG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Wish 4: The Crackdown</a>&nbsp;(1987), Paul Kersey has left his violent past behind, and is in the witness protection program, teaching architecture, and engaged to fashion designer Olivia Regent (Lesley-Anne Downe).  But there is trouble on the horizon, as Olivia's ex-husband Tommy O'Shea (Michael Parks), is using her business to launder the proceeds of his criminal activities.  O'Shea is also the father of Olivia's daughter Chelsea (Erica Lancaster).

With O'Shea's activities threatening to destroy the business, Kersey convinces Olivia to cooperate with the authorities to bring him to justice.  O'Shea retaliates by having one of his thugs brutally disfigure Olivia.  Despite the attack, Kersey still insists in working with the police, but treachery leads to Olivia's death as she is killed by O'Shea's men in a home invasion.  O'Shea taking custody of Chelsea, is the final straw that triggers Kersey's return to his violent ways.

Instead of picking up a gun, Kersey takes a more sophisticated approach, using poison, and then a bomb, to take out couple of O'Shea's lieutenants, setting up a confrontation in Olivia's garment factory.  The action is deliberate, as various underlings are removed.  The confrontation with O'Shea might be a little underwhelming, but with Bronson's advancing age, taking a subdued approach is understandable.  Death Wish 5, probably the least intense film in the series, does feature a solid performance from Lesley Anne Downe.

Adapted from Brian Garfield's novel, the original Death Wish was genuinely groundbreaking as it tapped into a growing fear of crime, and the rising paranoia that was prevalent in some of America's larger cities in the 70's.  Paul Kersey, a man who had no hope left, put his life at risk, tempting criminals to attack him.  The public was receptive to controversial anti-heroes like Dirty Harry and Paul Kersey, who scored big at the box office.  The subsequent Death Wish films were mostly about violently exterminating law breakers, rather than examining the motivations for vigilantism.

Although the violence was gratuitous at times, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Wish-3/dp/B0000YEEQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Wish 3</a>&nbsp;(1985) came close to being a parody, an underrated Charles Bronson, brought some credibility to Paul Kersey, that kept the character from becoming just a cold killing machine.",1285632000,,3442,6.347639484978541
556551,4,6303092306,"As previously stated in our&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Wish/dp/B0000541AN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Wish</a>&nbsp;review AMC has been blessing the world with a hilarious week long Death Wish marathon. We couldn't be happier about the situation because it has given us a chance to play catch up and finally close out the DW series when we were able to watch the first and fifth. Being release in 1994 certainly did no harm, being that's Sid's favorite lifetime decade, but may have affected to viewing of the film somewhat. See when&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Ring/dp/B00069QD74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Ring</a>&nbsp;was let loose on the world only a year prior the bar for action of the 90's til current times was changed forever. With that said Death Wish V didn't quite meet the criteria for the perfect 5 star event but did deserve an enthusiastic 4 stars thanks to some Italian slaying at the hands of Charles Bronson.

For the final time Paul Kersey is on a revenge based war path taking on an entire Italian mob syndicate. The only difference here is the famous Bronson mustache that got surprisingly thin in 1994. This was a moment of concern knowing that Bronson draws upon his stache for mystical killing powers, much like Apache needs uses his hair, but soon realized there was nothing to fear. As the mob begins to drop like flies the boss becomes increasingly nervous knowing Kersey's going to get him at some point. His only hope would have been to not be killed like two of his henchmen were. One had poison sprinkled on his cannoli and left to choke to death at a Italian delicatessen while the other actually exploded after being hit with a bomb infused soccer ball. Oh Bronson you never stop thinking.

All in all Death Wish V was exactly what you would expect being that you've already seen the same premise four times earlier. No matter how played out the story may be it becomes difficult to not get so much enjoyment out of watching Bronson handle his business. It's ashame the old boy chuck didn't live a little longer to do a few more in the Death Wish saga. Just imagine it right now, you've got a 70+ year old Bronson whose girlfriend (or maybe retirement home nurse) gets killed launching Chuck into an all out attack with his walker. It's something that'd be quite priceless and can't help but think of the possibilities.",1284768000,2,2472,5.162094763092269
556552,2,6303092306,"I grew up with a father who was a big fan of westerns. Most of our movies were westerns, and that's what I would watch. Therefore, there are three men I became quick fans of; John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, and Charles Bronson. I first saw 'Death Wish' at about 13, and it was the most powerful movie I'd seen at the time. As son as I learned there were sequels, I rushed to get my hands on them as soon as I could, and my enjoyment varied. When it comes to 'Part V', I'm set on not liking it, even though it isn't the worst in the series, (that honor goes to 'Death Wish II') but it's pretty lame. Bronson was beyond action hero age when this was made, so playing this like the first one, as more of a drama would have been a smarter move. Of course, the movie is full of plot holes, because Kersey's identity as a vigilante was outed in 'Part IV', but he lives with impunity now, with no mention of jail time, or any restrictions of his life. If the other sequels were cheap cash-ins, this was the worst, with Bronson taking the role only to collect a paycheck.",1281312000,,1059,4.145631067961165

The Third Death Wish was about the gangs and army friends and or friends of his army friend that where being terrorized by gangs in the neighborhood. The forth was about Drugs. This one was about Crime lords of the under world. With this one it was too redundant too much of the same, I shouldn't say the same, it was a different subject added to the death wish subject line.

556556,5,6303092306,"I'm at a point in my life where watching movies like this goes against my nature. But that said, this final chapter in the ""Death Wish"" series was not only a great conclusion, but it was a great way for Mr. Bronson to finish his acting work. (According to my research, this was the last film Charles Bronson made.) In earlier ""Death Wish"" movies, Bronson's role as Paul Kersey was limited to revenge and shooting down thugs of a low nature. ""Death Wish V"" seems to have overcome the problems of the previous chapters. Paul Kersey is at a point where he has fallen in love with a woman and just wants to live the rest of his life in peace. However, he realizes that the woman in his life (Lesley Anne Down) has a past with a mobster Tommy O'Shea that she can't sever. One really memorable comment from Bronson is: ""Guns have their uses. Idiots with guns make me nervous."" (A real proverb!) To make a long story short, Down is killed because she plans to testify against her x husband O'Shea. While earlier DW movies focused on revenge, Part V takes it to the next levels. While revenge is certainly part of Bronson's motive, he underlines that it is not just about revenge. He emphasizes that these mobsters go around just doing what they want and ruining the lives of people who are just trying to live honest lives. Part V also indicates that just because someone has a title or position in the justice system, that does NOT automatically mean you can trust them. I know some people knocked this 5th chapter for Bronson's unusually strategic methods. But it really made a lot of sense. To be sure, at this point in time, Bronson was in good shape for someone in his 70s. But remember, in this chapter, he is fighting organized crime. (Not just gunning down street thugs.) He is fighting more intelligent and able opponents who have actually been able to manipulate the justice system.) There is an unusual suspense and creepiness to this final chapter. While the 1st 4 chapters had an urban feeling, Part 5 has a chilling Gothic feel. As the Irish Mafia Boss, Tommy O'Shea is really evil. But he carries a charm that makes it almost impossible not to like him in a way. (Especially when he almost seems grateful to his opponent Bronson for taking down his annoying inside man in the justice system.) While any ""Death Wish"" fan will probably be able to guess the outcome of this movie, there is a great artistic and creepy suspense that we didn't have in previous chapters. While Part 4 kind of had an unsatisfying and morose end, the phenomenal Part 5 ends Mr. Bronson's work on a satisfying and artistic note. Enjoy your everlasting peace Mr. Bronson.",1211932800,10,2653,4.552301255230126

It's not too out of the ordinary for the series except that it's quite obviously very low budget, resulting in an odd fading-out visual quality. Story-wise it's what we expect and Bronson is his usual grand old self. It's difficult to be too harsh on this one because it would be the last time we'd see the character and the last time Charles Bronson would appear in a theatrical feature. All he would do for the remainder of his life would be TV films.
The last scene is very memorable and a few kills are unique. This is good entertainment, nothing more or less than that.",1206835200,,645,4.383333333333334

 One thing that is different from the previous ones in this series is that Paul Kersey has upped his status. The day-glo punks and riff raff from the first three Death Wish movies are gone and now Paul is taking on the mob. Once again someone close to Paul gets killed, and Kersey responds guns in hand ready to get revenge...... and you know he will! Paul Kersey is an example of how when the law fails, it is time to take it into one's hands. And think about this, when theses guys are killed by Kersey, how can you not cheer? When Tommy O' Shea gets a bath, who didn't cheer? Great film, great series, and of course Bronson is one of the greatest of our time.

A better cast than usual (Lesley-Anne Down as his love interest, Michael Parks as the ultimate bad guy, Miguel Santoval as a crooked cop, and Saul Rubinek as an impotent district attorney) mix with some other familiar faces to create you know what for Kersey, who is now a professor before he retreats to his old habits.

The nasty violence in this movie reminded me of ""The Exterminator"", a ""Death Wish"" ripoff from 1980 wherein Robert Ginty played a Vietnam war veteran getting even with bad guys in the neighborhood including a few mobsters, one of whom ended up in a gigantic meat grinder. A similar fate awaits a bad guy here.

There is a comical scene in this flick where bad guys come to Kersey's home to rub out him and girlfriend Down, who is set to testify against bad guy Parks, who somehow mixes extortion with his prominent role in the fashion industry! You'll surely want to see how 73-year-old Bronson escapes the wrath of bad guys half his age with automatic weapons.

This is an absurd and ugly film that nonetheless is enthralling for fans of the genre. I found it delivered satisfaction even through its silliness. If you like this kind of movie you're going to enjoy ""Death Wish V: The Face of Death"".",1133308800,4,1452,4.551724137931035

556641,5,6303092306,"I recently saw this sequel in the series and I thought it was great. One thing that is different from the previous ones in this series is that Paul Kersey has upped his status. The day-glo punks and riff raff from the first three Death Wish movies are gone and now Paul is taking on the mob. Once again someone close to Paul gets killed, and Kersey responds guns in hand ready to get revenge...... and you know he will! Paul Kersey is an example of how when the law fails, it is time to take it into one's hands. And think about this, when thses guys are killed by Kersey, how can you not cheer? When Tommy O' Shea gets a bath, who didn't cheer? Great film, great series, and of course Bronson is one of the greatest of our time.

556643,3,6303092306,"Paul Kersey now lives in the witness protection program (why?) and is preparing to settle down with another woman, a fashion designer in New York, and her daughter.  But this new love comes with some ugly baggage.  Her ex-husband is a local hood who is using his ex-wife's business to clean his dirty money.  When this operation is threatened said ex makes violent threats and then follows through on them with his trio of thugs.  Of course the law seems to be unable to do anything about it and Kersey (who everybody on the planet seems aware of) returns to his old ways - nobody puts up much of a fight.  There is very little steam in this entry, but writer/director Allan A. Goldstein does manage a few nice touches, just not as many as previous entries had.  Bronson still has more star charisma and presence in his winter years than just about any action star of today.  You could believe his punch would still pack a wallop.  What is sad though is that Goldstein's script is so choked with illogic.  As I mentioned before, it seems that every law enforcement officer in New York City (actually cost saving Canada this time around) knows that Kersey is back to his creep killing ways and their only reaction is. ""Cut it out, will ya?""  That does not tension make.  Heck, even Death Wish 4: The Crackdown handled it better.  Nonetheless, the cast plays their roles with just the right amount of winking and/or phoning in and one or two inventive dispatchings of the love-to-hate-them bad guys spices up the overly routine aspects of the movie.  But it's for the die hard fans only.",1077235200,2,1585,4.578014184397163
556644,4,6303092306,"I love the first Death Wish sequels, but lets face it...they were trashy entertainment. They had little plot (basically shoot the hell out of scum), they portrayed unenthusiastic performances by supporting cast, they had characters that you didn't care about, silly love interests for Bronson, and paltry directing. All this is what actually made those films so much fun. You won't exactly get that with Death Wish 5. The filmmakers actually seem to have tried to make a decent film with this sequel. The villains seem to have more depth and there's actually a plot. It try's to develop characters you care about, though it doesn't quite succeed on some levels. What I found amazing is that Bronson's love interest is actually somewhat believeable, unlike in Death Wish 3 & 4 which it was more laughable. I actually found myself very surprised by this film, in a good way. You could say that Death Wish 5, should I dare say, is the best Death Wish sequel. Though I said best, it does not mean most entertaining. Death Wish 5 may have the most developed plot, better acting, and overall better filmmaking than its predecessors, but the first sequels are actually more entertaining. You can't beat the final shout-out in Death Wish 3 or the roller rink ending to Death Wish 4. That's pure entertainment! So in conclusion, Death Wish 5 is not your average Death Wish sequel. This could be a good or a bad thing. If you absolutely love the other Death Wish sequels and think they are the best films ever made; you may not like this one. But if you, like me, love the other Death Wish films for what they are and are able to accept change, then you will find Death Wish 5 to your much liking.
TRIVIA: The original VHS release portrayed the title DEATH WISH V: THE FACE OF DEATH on the box art and in the film itself. The newer DVD release has the ""V"" removed from the title so now the film and box art portray DEATH WISH: THE FACE OF DEATH.

556646,4,6303092306,"When Charles Bronson died recently, he left behind a body of work spanning four decades. One of his last film projects was an entry in a memorable franchise, the final installment of the ""Death Wish"" films. ""Death Wish V: The Face of Death"" marked the end of more than one era. Gone forever is the reliable low budget Bronson actioner that predominated the 1980s. I grew up on a steady diet of Chuck Bronson films, so paying homage to this enjoyable actor by watching this film was quite easy. It was a surprise to notice that one member of the Golan-Globus team that ran Cannon films in the 1980s produced ""Death Wish V,"" giving the movie even more of a nostalgic feel. The ""Death Wish"" series introduced America to Paul Kersey, an architect by trade who, through a series of unfortunate and violent circumstances, sought bloody revenge on criminals who murdered his family. The first film did wonderfully at the box office, providing a measure of vicarious thrill for a population weary of rampant crime on the streets of America. Then the series got ridiculous as Kersey literally became a death wish for anybody who associated with him. In each subsequent film, a girlfriend or soon to be wife bought the big one, inspiring the architect to hit the streets one more time in search of retribution. This guy lost more people close to him because of criminals than would ever be possible, but such is the dangerous world of filmmaking.
In ""Death Wish V,"" Kersey, now in the witness protection program after his last outbreak of bloody violence, again decides to look for a wife. He finds one in Olivia Regent, a one time model who now runs her own fashion studio. Even better, Olivia has a young daughter who thinks the world of Paul and eagerly wants her mother to marry him. The only obstacle to this happy union is Olivia's ex-husband, a brutal Irish gangster named Tommy O'Shea, a guy who persists in harassing his ex-wife because he has a stake in her business. He also wants his daughter back and will do almost anything to achieve this goal. When O'Shea isn't terrorizing his family, he spends his time shaking down other businesses in the garment district. Oh, and just so we know this guy is a big time baddie, the film makes sure to let us know that O'Shea is also a racist. Within minutes Paul and Tommy exchange a few words, and we just know that Kersey will go after this guy. After a goon roughs up Olivia and murders her factory manager, Kersey quickly realizes that his complaints to the authorities fall on deaf ears. Both the police and the D.A.'s office say they can do nothing because no one will testify against the nasty O'Shea. In fact, they tell Paul that they have been on this criminal's tail for some sixteen years without success. The architect's rage knows no bounds when Olivia dies in a shoot out and her daughter ends up in the custody of her gangster father. Out comes the gun and Kersey is off on yet another bloody crusade against street predators.
Bronson looks surprisingly fit for a man well into his seventies. While I didn't buy some of the antics he took part in, the filmmakers wisely decided to minimize any physical confrontations between Kersey and O'Shea's goons. Instead, the revenge killings that take place involve some cyanide, a soccer ball filled with explosives (which works well as an idea and leads to a cool ""guy on fire"" scene), and your typical final showdown with plenty of gunfire and explosions. Some of the deaths are unintentionally funny, such as the factory worker soaring through a storefront window and the acid bath at the end. Overall, ""Death Wish V"" delivers some satisfying screen violence that fits in well with the arc of the series overall. Special mention goes to the special effects technicians who punched up the sounds of the gunfire and explosions. Every time a gun goes off it sounds like a howitzer, and the explosions boomed out of my speakers in deafening peals. Expect to hear some classic Bronson lines as he delivers justice the only way he knows how. I roared with laughter over the soccer ball scene, especially when I noticed how Kersey smiles and laughs as the guy dies. Overdone, perhaps, but realistic if this is really a guy seeking revenge for the death of a loved one.
The performances aren't too bad for this type of film. Bronson phones in his performance, which isn't surprising because he's played this character so many times. The guy who played Tommy O'Shea decided to imbue his character with a drollness as thick as an Irish brogue. Lesley-Anne Down doesn't do much as Olivia Regent, nor does the actress who plays her daughter. The various actors playing O'Shea's goons failed to stick in my memory five minutes after I watched this thing, but who cares, really? As long as Kersey blows 'em away by the end, I'm a happy camper. The violence is the real star of this movie anyway. Be sure and look for the familiar faces of Saul Rubinek as Tony Hoyle and Miguel Sandoval as his suspicious sidekick Hector. The DVD doesn't contain too much in the way of extras, but the picture looks good for such a fun, throwaway movie. You simply have to like a film that uses a poisoned pastry and a remote controlled toy to dispatch bad guys. You should also like a film that makes dandruff a major plot point. Perhaps Bronson deserved better projects for his final movie appearances, but I appreciated the fact that he made another one of these films.

7836888,4,6303092306,"The final film in the Death Wish series is easily my favorite of all the sequels--although it honestly doesn't have much in common with the other Death Wish films and feels a lot more like a sequel to The Evil That Men Do.  In the previous Death Wish films, Charles Bronson's Paul Kersey was waging a one man vigilante war against street thugs and mostly shot people.  This time around Paul Kersey is going after a powerful gangster and his goons and he comes up with much more elaborate and creative ways to pick off his targets.  That's what makes this feel like a sequel to The Evil That Men Do--rather than a vigilante this time around Paul Kersey seems to have somehow morphed into a very talented professional assassin.

The story concerns Paul Kersey again trying to leave his violent past behind.  He has an ex-model/fashion designer girlfriend named Olivia Regent (Lesley-Ann Down who is a pretty big upgrade from Jill Ireland, Bronson's deceased wife and way too frequent leading lady) and a cute soon to be step-daughter.  Unfortunately, Olivia's ex and the girl's biological father is a vicious gangster named Tommy O'Shea (Michael Parks in an amazingly eccentric and entertaining performance).  Tommy attacks his ex-wife and kidnaps his kid and, naturally, the law can do nothing about it.  But the gangster has no idea whom he is dealing with, assuming that Kersey is just the harmless architect that he appears to be.

Death Wish V: The Face of Death was made a whopping 7 years after the previous film in the series, which was a pretty long time considering that Bronson was already kind of long in the tooth to be starring in action films when he made Death Wish 4.  But since this time Bronson's character is using his wits to pick off his targets and Bronson isn't playing an intimidating tough guy he never seems too old for the role.  At the same time, it's hard to shake the feeling that this one is a Death Wish sequel in name only or that Bronson's character must have been a professional assassin to be so skilled as to create and use a cleverly disguised remote control bomb or to smoothly poison someone in plain sight in an Italian restaurant without anyone seeing a thing.  It's hard to believe that the vigilante character from the previous Death Wish films would actually be able to do these kinds of things--although that ultimately doesn't make the movie any less fun to watch.

This was the only Death Wish sequel not produced by Cannon Pictures, which was long bankrupt and gone by the time Death Wish V was made.  It's also the only Death Wish sequel that wasn't directed by one of the two hacks responsible for the overwhelming majority of Bronson's films in the 1970's and 80's (Michael Winner & J. Lee Thompson).  The director this time around is someone named Allan A. Goldstein who definitely doesn't have an impressive resume before or after Death Wish V.  But he does bring some welcome enthusiasm to the proceedings (possibly because it's his only theatrical film), does a nice job staging the kills and allows Michael Parks to go very over the top with his performance as bad guy Tommy O'Shea, making the character both one of the funniest and nastiest villains Charles Bronson ever squared up against.  If you want to see why Johnny Depp was such a big fan of Michael Parks that he did the low budget horror film Tusk basically for free just to work with him watch Death Wish V: The Face of Death and you will definitely find the answer.

This ultimately isn't top tier Bronson like The Mechanic, The Stone Killer, Breakout, Telefon or Hard Times--the production values are too low, giving the film more of a 1970's grindhouse feel than anything Charles Bronson actually made in the 1970's and the direction is a bit slapdash--but if your expectations aren't especially high Death Wish V: The Face of Death is surprisingly fun to watch, although it's a bit of a guilty pleasure compared to other Charles Bronson films I enjoy.",1502928000,,3972,4.690647482014389
