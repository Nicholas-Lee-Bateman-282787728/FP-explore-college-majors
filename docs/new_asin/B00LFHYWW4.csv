6481858,5,B00LFHYWW4,"This is great!  But I will sit tight. Until it comes down to about $80-100.
And it will in time....",1405123200,8,99,3.95
6481859,5,B00LFHYWW4,"I'm amazed how much derision a Blu-Ray set could get just because some of everyone's favorite movies are not on the set. When it was announced that the Steven Spielberg Director's Collection was coming out on Blu-Ray, everyone threw a fit because it didn't feature ""Schindler's List"", ""Munich"", ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", ""Lincoln"" and the ""Indiana Jones"" movies. Like really, people? Do you guys even bother to do any research as to why they're not included?

Well since everyone on the Net is too lazy to make an effort, I will explain the ""glaring"" omissions of some of their movies. First off, this Blu-Ray set is distributed by Universal, which means only the movies Spielberg made for this company (except for ""Schindler's List"", which I will explain in a little bit) are included here. Second, many of the other movies were distributed and financed by other studios (ex: before being bought by Disney, the ""Indiana Jones"" movies were distributed by Paramount) and it would cost a fortune just to get ONE of their movies on this set. ""Munich"", for example, thought distributed by Universal overseas, was actually promoted by DreamWorks in the United States, as were ""Catch Me If You Can"", ""The Terminal"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", which is why THEY are not in this collection. ""Close Encounters"" is a Columbia movie and ""Hook"" was distributed by Tri-Star.

And third, these movies were made to cash in Spielberg's image as a populist filmmaker, an entertainer rather than a serious artist. That's why ""Schindler's List"" is not on this box set, even though it was made by Universal. Instead, this collection is served to introduce Spielberg to a new generation of adolescents, young filmgoers who probably never heard of Spielberg before or have but never seen any of his pictures. Seriously, would you pick ""Schindler's List"" or even ""Empire of the Sun"" as the first choice to introduce your kid to Spielberg's work? They would probably groan at the mention of his name after seeing those movies and not give him a chance again.

So what IS here? Well, ""Schindler's List"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" may not be here, but ""Jaws"", ""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial"" and the first two ""Jurassic Park"" movies certainly are, which alone would make this a worthy purchase. But the real news is that four other Spielberg movies are also appearing on Blu-Ray for the first time: ""Duel"", ""The Sugarland Express"", ""1941"" and ""Always"". The news that ""Duel"" and ""The Sugarland Express"" are appearing on the set is a cause of celebration, as these two terrific movies showed that even before ""Jaws"", Spielberg was a filmmaker worth discovering, and haven't received a Blu-Ray treatment until now. In fact, some even feel that Spielberg never made a movie as good as ""Duel"" or even ""The Sugarland Express"" again, although I (as well as millions of people) would beg to differ. Also, ""1941"", Spielberg's fascinating train-wreck that nevertheless has a strong cult following, will be released with both the theatrical and the extended versions on the disc. So you're getting more than you actually bargain for here.

It's one thing to criticize the product because of its flaws, but to nitpick over a set because it doesn't feature your favorite movies and not look at the big picture is a genuine mistake. Those movies are already out on Blu-Ray; even ""Hook"" came out on a Blu-Ray + DVD Combo Pack. In a perfect world, ALL of Spielberg's best movies would be released on one set or even three sets. But there's no such thing as a perfect world and these Internet fans need to get over it. If it makes you feel better, write your complaints on a piece of paper and then throw it out. Trust me, you'll feel better.",1404604800,242,3710,4.837795275590551
6481860,5,B00LFHYWW4,"Looking forward to this collection. To the true film enthusiast and Spielberg fan, this is a definite must. The titles are spot on correct films to include. Why? Heres a few reasons.

""Duel"" the film that started his career. It does for lonely desert highways what ""Jaws"" later did for swimming in the ocean. A made for TV movie that was so good, it was released theatrically overseas. It is the template for action thrillers for decades to come. This film has been imitated many times and elements and homages to ""Duel"" appear in many movies that followed. This is how you do action suspense and it will be on Blu-Ray widescreen for the first time. If you haven't seen or heard of this movie, you're in for a treat, albeit a suspenseful one.

""Sugarland Express"" An impressive theatrical start to Stevens career. Goldie Hawn, William Atherton, Ben Johnson make up the primary cast of a drama played out in the open spaces of America's southwest. The plot revolves around an escaped convict and his girl friend intent on getting to Sugarland Texas to pickup their child to try and start a life of their own. Things go badly and with law enforcement in pursuit a procession of police cars lead by one kidnapped officer makes its way across the landscape which Spielberg deftly uses as an important character in the film. The vast open Texas prairie and rolling hills are as much a part of the plot as any of the human characters. This is young Steven at his best, creating a drama with pathos and wit the equal of Coppala, Scorsese or any of his contemporaries.

""Jaws"" What else can be said. This is the template movie for all summer films to come. If you haven't seen Jaws you must have been in a cave for the past forty years.

Omissions? Why leave out the Indy films? Because they've already been given the full on treatment by Paramount and Spielberg so while certainly deserving it's time to let some of the others take the forefront.

""Schindlers List"" for example, is to important a film to include in a collection. Due to the subject matter it is a singular experience with an emotional content, weight and historic significance that don't lend themselves to the rest of this summer fare.",1404604800,25,2196,4.62051282051282
6481861,5,B00LFHYWW4,"Not quite sure why every other review is scoffing at this. At $200 it's pricey, considering that some of these films are more than likely already owned......but at the sale price of $92 it's a really good deal.

Especially since it's got 4 UNRELEASED films:

Duel, 1941, The Sugarland Express and Always. I will be getting this just for those, but I am really hoping that 1941 is the original cut and not the director's extended cut.

And for those hoping for individual releases....I doubt it will happen.

My suggestion would be to buy this and sell the duplicate copies on Ebay (or here), and you might find that you actually make money on the deal.",1404518400,,652,4.594827586206897
6481862,1,B00LFHYWW4,"Overpriced, underwhelming set. You can buy all these films individually for less than half the price (except for some like Duel and 1941, which aren't on Blu-ray, I know; but as if they won't be released separately soon enough?). And where is Munich, in here or on Blu-ray? Oh, that will get a separate release, then probably re-inclusion in yet another overpriced box set, perhaps ""The Ultimate"" Spielberg collection. Brother. Can't really blame the studio, though. To paraphrase Mencken, nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American consumer.",1404345600,15,571,5.355555555555555
6481863,3,B00LFHYWW4,"I love Spielberg and to finally have a collection of his films to show others why I love him so much is great, but I'm a tad disappointed in the choices given here.

No Close Encounters
No Raiders (or any Indy)
No Schindlers
No Saving Private Ryan
No Catch Me If You Can
No Munich

Jurassic Park is my favourite movie of all time, but surely The Lost World's spot could've been given to any of these more deserving pictures??

Maybe there are legal issues behind these choices but it seems like one of those collections where there's problems getting the films they really want so they just add some filler......",1404259200,5,612,4.495495495495495
6481864,4,B00LFHYWW4,"As a huge fan of Spielberg, I'm definitely looking at getting this. I already bought ""Jaws"" and ""ET"" on Blu-Ray, but have yet to get the ""Jurassic"" movies, so this would be a good way to finally add them to my HD movie collection.

The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is the fact that neither ""Schindler's List"" nor ""Munich,"" which has yet to be released on Blu-Ray, are included. Both are important parts of Spielberg's legacy as a filmmaker, as well as towering accomplishments in his history with Universal. Because of how preciously he's treated ""Schindler's List"" on DVD and Blu-Ray releases, I understand that one not being included, but ""Munich"" is a disappointment, although hopefully, it's only being left off because they have something in mind for the 10th anniversary next year.",1404259200,4,794,4.881481481481481

6481888,3,B00LFHYWW4,"I am one of those people who pretty much grew up on Steven Spielberg's movies.  Like many people who grew up with these movies, I have purchased these movies several times over the years.  However there are three movies in this set that as far as I've seen have never been released on Blu-ray until this set.  Those movies are The Sugarland Express, Always, and 1941.  All of the movies in this set are excellent movies.  Everyone of them is one of my favorites.  I only have three complaints about this set.

1.  Schindler's List (one of his first movies to deal with Nonfiction subject matter) is not included.  To me it doesn't make sense it is owned and released through the same company why not include it in the ""Director's Collection.""  From what I remember it is the only Universal release from Spielberg not in this set.

2.  The packaging is one of those boxes that is made to be more environmentally conscious (it's made from paper) but the problem is when you have to slide the discs in and out it can scratch up the discs.  A couple of the discs had deep gouges into them inhibiting the disc to work and that was when it was brand new and unopened.

3.  Where is the Digital Copy?  Universal was one of the first companies to start putting digital copies free with bluray purchases.  Every previously released movie in this set (Jurassic Park 1-2, Jaws, E.T.) on it's own Bluray included the Ultraviolet Digital Copy.  I paid a lot more for this set and NO Digital copy was included.  Grr.",1420675200,7,1502,4.476014760147602

The titles previously released to blu (ET, JAWS, JURASSIC, LOST WORLD) are the same great transfers seen on those discs with the same extra features.  The real reason I got this was for SUGARLAND, DUEL, and 1941.  ALWAYS has its fans, but I'm not one of them.

Universal has done a great job on these films.  Overall, very happy with this collection.  Glad they included the extended version of 1941 but wish they'd included the TV version of DUEL (what we get is the International Theatrical Version at 1.85:1).  Perhaps that's the version Spielberg prefers.",1416960000,4,633,4.915094339622642

But the thorn among the roses is 1942. Watching the extended version does not improve this movie but makes you wonder what were the actors and director thinking. It borders on racism and stereotyping and that's being charitable. But like an freeway accident, it's hard not to watch because your waiting to see if it's going to get worse. And it does not disappoint. Nice packaging, great transfers and a good value.",1414108800,,568,4.68
6481894,5,B00LFHYWW4,"I decided to port my own review over from Blu-ray.com, because I'm not seeing a lot of love for this set.  And no one is taking it seriously.

Finally ! It came in the mail from Amazon late this afternoon, and I couldn't wait to dig in.

I will simplify my personal review: many of the discs are the same as previous releases. (To clarify, 'Jurassic Park' is the same transfer as the 2011 release -- not the more recent waxy-looking version that accompanied the 3D Re-release -- which borders on being comparable to that horrible new version of 'Predator,' as one of the worst jobs of attempting to perfect a home video experience that I have ever seen.) Waxy, marionette-looking s***, is what it is.

The new additions in this release are: 'Duel,' 'Sugarland Express,' '1941,' and 'Always.' All of which look and sound AMAZING, in comparison to their former laserdisc or DVD releases. And for the most part, the extras are the same as before. Nothing new there, unfortunately. The only missing extra I noted is on the '1941' disc. Originally, the '1941' Laserdisc and DVD both included an additional music only track (which was well hidden, but accessible on the audio menu,) and that track is absent here. A good deal of Williams music, along with a song by The Andrews Sisters, could be played, and enjoyed, as audio-only. That would have been nice in one of the current digital sound formats, as opposed to only stereo; which is what is presented on the Laserdisc and DVD releases.

The Blu-ray set's Case, is the same type of construction as Paramount's release of the 'Indiana Jones' films. And I personally prefer this type of construction. The discs slide out very easy and are not scratched in any way by the sleeves they inhabit. It's a little harder to scratch a blu-ray than it is a DVD. Each movie's open gatefold contains an image of the theatrical poster and a few other images. There is also a small book included, which for owners or admirers of the 'E.T.' and 'JAWS' digi-books, includes all images and information, reprinted, from there. **((REVISED: When I originally wrote this review, I was going by memory; as I got rid of my own copies of those digi-books some time ago.  And I have confirmed that this part of my review is wrong.  To be precise: only a scant few pages from those digi-books have found their way into the 'Steven Spielberg Director's Collection.'  Each of those previous releases, includes a book that is essentially mounted into the gatefold of the release, and each book is more than 50 pages !!  So die hard collector's should hang onto that, if you still have it.  My profound apologies for my error.))**  And similar information is included for the other films. So it's kind of like having a digibook for each film. Albeit there are no additional special features. One of the only two minor complaints I have for this set, is a lack of additional extras for 'Sugarland Express' and 'Always.' **The 'Duel' special features have all been ported over.

The second (minor) complaint is that an additional disc ""could"" have been included, containing a host of Spielberg's early work in Television (as evidenced by one of the brief documentaries on the 'Duel' disc.) I guess because the 'Columbo' episode 'Murder by the Book,' is available on season one of 'Columbo' on DVD. The 'Marcus Welby' episode, 'The Daredevil Gesture' is available on season one of that DVD set, and the 'Night Gallery' episodes 'Eyes' and 'Make 'Em Laugh (or 'Make Me Laugh;' I've seen it under both titles,) are each available on season One of 'Night Gallery' on DVD.

However, the two episodes of 'The Psychiatrist' that Spielberg directed, 'Par for the Course,' and 'The Private World of Martin Dalton,' the episode of 'In the Name of the Game,' titled 'L.A. 2017,' and an episode of 'Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law' titled 'Eulogy for a Wide Receiver,' are not evidenced on home video at this time. Kind of sad, really. They all could have been included here on one blu-ray. Missed opportunity.

But this is an AWESOME package, in any case. And highly collectible. Many people are already complaining that over half the releases in this set, can only be defined as 'double-dipping' by Universal. Especially since only 'Duel,' 'Sugarland,' and 'Always' have not been released individually. And all others in the set, have. I wouldn't stress over that. 'Duel,' 'Sugarland,' and '1941,' will eventually be released, over the course of the next few months. I'm sure of that. So quite your bitching, please. There will always be sets of this kind. Sorry you got caught with several of the releases presented here already in your collection, but being anal-retentive to that degree is ridiculous. If you don't want it, don't buy it. Just wait for the single releases; they are coming, I confirmed that with a friend who works for Universal's home video division. THIS, is a really nice collector's set for Spielberg fans. Precisely what it's intended to be. If that's not you, then keep moving, nothing to see here.

One last note. The typical annoying Universal trailers, which pop up on discs like 'Apollo 13' -- and won't go away so easily ... are not here. **((REVISED: The discs for 'Jaws,' 'E.T.,' 'Jurassic,' and 'Lost World' are all cloned from previous releases, and therefore suffer from the same issues re: pop up trailers that 'Apollo 13' suffers from.  I should have been more specific about that.  Only 'Duel,' 'Sugarland,' '1941,' and 'Always' have the new menus, which do not bring up unwanted advertisements.))**  There is a single pop up, reminding the buyer of the digital versions of the films available and then each disc defaults straight to the main menu. Which makes owning this set a much nicer experience.

I give this set my personal HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION.",1413504000,69,5799,4.810050251256281
6481895,5,B00LFHYWW4,"I just picked this up at Costco for $89.  I figured I wasn't taking a huge gamble because they have a liberal return policy.  I think that Duel in 1:85 looks wonderful!  I actually think it moves better with the wider angle and am not the kind of purist who wants to see every bit of every frame ever shot (see Stanley Kubrick for more on that).  Duel was the main driving force for me and my purchase (excuse the pun) and thinking it may not come out in the distant future as a stand alone BR.  1941 was my next interest/test and I thought it looked much better than the DVD... I should add here that it seems all previous bonus features have been used on these films and nothing extra or new has been added, but at least if you have some of them you can get rid of the dupes.  I own Jaws (how could I not?) but I hadn't picked up the two Jurrasic Park flix or ET so I wasn't double dipping very much so that makes it a better purchase for me than many others.  Always was a film I thought was sweet and I'm glad to have it, and it looks terrific in HD , but Duel was my big ""want"". The Sugarland Express looks nice in BR (although it does show grain so don't expect it to look like a more recent film) and I always appreciate Ben Johnson when I can find him in my library.  I can't possibly give this set any less than 5 stars... I ended up paying about $10 a movie for a terrific set of films housed in a compact and attractive box with a bonus booklet. This is a lot like the treatment Alfred Hitchcock received.... but that had several more films.  At $89 a five star rating.... at $200 .... given all the duplicate movies.... for many folks, I'd be hard pressed to give it better than a 3.  If Duel and the other few films eventually come out on BR I won't feel burned... unless they find extras or do something to them they didn't this time (that HAS happened)... but reviewing what we have and at the price it can be owned...... it would make a staggeringly great gift.",1413417600,6,1977,4.0852713178294575
6481896,5,B00LFHYWW4,"For anyone not living under a rock for the past 10 years, you are aware that Steven Spielberg has been releasing movies that he directed to blu-ray format. For anyone new to the blu-ray format just beginning their blu-ray movie collection, this set filled with some of director Steven Spielberg's most exciting, visually stunning and action-packed cinematic sterling silver screen gems is sure to please, because it contains the same stellar transfers as some of his movies that he directed for Universal Pictures that have already been released.

6481901,3,B00LFHYWW4,"I will not purchase this set, since I have most of the SS blu's that I like.  BUT,,,,,, somebody is saying that 1941 will be out on Bluray!!  That I have been waiting for since Sony won the Blu wars.  I wish Criterion would do 1941, but that might be asking too much from an industry that is greedy and just a bunch of bean counters.  I'll wait and hope that SS did justice to such a great comedy as 1941.",1410480000,,405,3.962962962962963
6481902,1,B00LFHYWW4,"Most of these movies on this set  can be had for $5.00 to $8.00  in the bargain bins at  Best Buys and Walmart.  1941 and Duel are the only new ones released on Blu-ray, and you know they will have stand alone releases very soon.

So I would personally wait for those to be release separately and avoid buying this overpriced  set......enough already of these studios trying to milk you into double dipping on these movies.",1409875200,5,423,4.5
6481903,5,B00LFHYWW4,"I already own Jaws and E.T. on Blu-ray but since I have yet to buy Jurassic Park, the Lost World and the set comes with Always, Sugarland, Duel and 1941 for the pre-order sale price of $91. I decided to pre-order it.
I have been very satisfied with Limited Edition Collector Set so far and also own Star Wars the Collectors Edition, Indiana Jones Collection, the Alien Anthology, the Universal Monsters set, the Stanley Kubrick Limited Edition Collection (which contains Spartacus and Dr. Strangelove) and the Universal Alfred Hitchcock Collection.
I do love the format these take - book style with each page containing a film, and the prices on sale are fantastic and overall quality I have been pleased in every regard on most of the films except a few in the Hitchcock set.
I wish they would release more Director sets like these - would be great if Criterion had done a Wes Anderson set or perhaps a John Hughes set would be in the works... the only down side as most people do point out is that each set is limited by that particular Studio. Lucky for Kubrick fans that most of his films were under Warner Bros. and all but The Killing and Paths of Glory were available in the one Limited Edition set at one time for those who had enough foresight to get it while it was around... and I am extremely happy with it and highly recommend it if you can get your hands on it for a reasonable price.
The reason I ordered this is mainly two fold - for 1941, Duel, Always & the Sugarland Express and also because if this set does go out of print it will skyrocket and on the off chance this becomes the only way you can get these movies then anyone who does not have this set but wants a *complete* Spielberg Collection is pretty much **cked.
There will undoubtedly be an 'Essentials' version of this the same as with the Kubrick and Hitchcock sets but I seriously doubt if Duel, Sugarland, Always and 1941 will be included.
For $91. for a set like this you are basically paying $10 a film. it was the same with the Kubrick set which is now out of print.
And everyone who wants to complete their Kubrick collection will now pay through the nose for Dr. Strangelove on Blu.
It doesn't list too many special features for Sugarland Express or 1941 so that's a danger sign to me that they may end up being limited to this set alone...",1409443200,5,2327,4.401392111368909
6481904,1,B00LFHYWW4,I like about half these films and want 1941 on Blu Ray desperately but will not pay this asinine price to get a load of films I don't care about. Come on SS....quit your greed-fest.,1409270400,8,181,4.2
8665578,1,B00LFHYWW4,"The collection itself isn't bad and it spans much of Spielberg's earlier career, including some lesser-known movies like Duel and Always. Unfortunately, the packaging of the discs in this collection is atrocious, resulting in scratched discs no matter how careful you are. In my case, I tried twice to purchase this and both times the collection came with unplayable discs because the discs had moved around in their sleeves and gotten scratched.

If you can get this on a deal, as I did, and if you're willing to take a risk, go for it, but make sure that you carefully examine and play each disc before the return opportunity expires.",1531872000,,636,4.781818181818182
