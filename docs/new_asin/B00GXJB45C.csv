8628443,5,B00GXJB45C,"Let me preface this review by stating that I am a retired Chicago Police Sergeant who now teaches at a Community College. So I approached this video without bias against law enforcement. In my 32 years of service and prior military service Rules of Engagement, Use of Force and other Limitations placed upon Law Enforcement and Military Personnel were the standards by which I lived for most of my life, so to see these standards brazenly violated by my Government was disturbing. To see my Government use a gas on U.S. civilians that it could not use in combat due to the Geneva Convention, was quite bluntly disturbing at the least. I used this video as part of my Criminal Justice 101 class. My prior knowledge of the Waco Massacre, (and that is the only way to describe it, a Massacre that was produced by an out of control FBI, a vicious Attorney General and incompetent President.) was limited to the Mainstream Media of that era. Remember, this happened before the internet was providing second by second news coverage and news was for the most part limited to the editing and censorship of ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN. So to see what this video showed was both shocking and disturbing. The video provides factual insight and interviews never seen before of law enforcement officers both Federal and State who were on the scene. The officers themselves realize that this incident was a violation of the U.S. Constitution and basic principles of American Justice. Waco was an Outrage and tragedy that could have and should have been avoided. Certainly, David Koresh was a madman, nobody can deny that. However, there were numerous opportunities to arrest him without the ""staged"" invasion of his compound that resulted in the unnecessary deaths of federal agents and civilians. Yet none of the government officials responsible for this tragedy  went to prison. The Attorney General Ms. Reno, who claimed responsibility remained in power. The FBI violated it's own Rules of Engagement, but the officials responsible were allowed to retire with pensions. The innocent women and children who were burned alive received no justice, only painful deaths. This video is important because many young people have no idea that this event took place and the magnitude of the carnage resulting from the incident. Prior to seeing this video my students did not realize the ability and ease of the Federal Government in violating the rights of citizens and the ability of the Government to kill citizens with complete impunity. And remember, Waco was before the Patriot Act and the Snowden revelations, so only God knows what is in store for us in the future. The video states facts that were either ignored or covered-up by past news coverage and points out that much information related to the incident is still kept from public scrutiny. Yes Waco occurred over twenty years ago so some may see it as history. Yet it is as timely as today's news, because the issues of Civilian Militarization of Police and the Raw Unbridled Power of Federal Law Enforcement is an urgent priority to all citizens TODAY. I urge anyone who is even remotely concerned with the aforementioned issues to see this video and anyone teaching Civics , Political Science, or Contemporary American History should consider this video as required viewing.",1400976000,11,3313,4.937275985663082
8628444,5,B00GXJB45C,"I chose this rating for the following reasons. During the Waco law enforcement event like so many others I was busy trying to balance work, home life, and preparing for the future.  I watched the daily news on TV and listened to talk radio when I could for the latest current events particularly the three ring circus of politics, as well as international events and the latest financial happenings. I couldn't help but notice there was coverage of the events at Waco but I just put that down as a bunch of trouble makers resisting our federal law enforce authorities trying to keeping our nation safe. After all this was the United States and everyone knows we all can be proud of the diligence and integrity of the DOJ, FBI, and the BATFE.  When the whole thing ran its course I concluded from what I saw on nightly TV and Sunday news roundups the massive loss of life was tragic but was always a possibility.  The nation's laws had been upheld and our gallant law enforcement authorities had been forced to finalize the action.

Then, one day a few years later on I believe HBO, I decided to watch a special two hour presentation concerning on the events surrounding Waco. My world was never the same. When I started to view the show I was uneasy. By the time the show was over I was totally demoralized and disillusioned by what I had seen.  It was the totality of it all. Viewing it all from the initial assault on the communal farm to the final hours culminating in a massive loss of life as described by witnesses, survivors, and federal agents all testifying  before a congressional committee.  Of particular note was the FBI agent who boldly stated that the FBI commanders decided that if they made it tough enough on the children the parents would surrender. As a result of some testimony presented it appeared that anyone attempting to surrender had a real problem.

Many issues were left unsettled and in dispute. All of that was captured in the HBO presentation. It stood that way for many years the FBI denying the use of incendiary devices, using any military resources during this campaign, and other things like who shot first.

What I liked. Now, in my view, comes the most devastating presentation of recent evidence filling in the continuance of one of the saddest episodes ever in American law enforcement history ""Waco-New Revelation"". It presents new pieces of information which corrects a lot of the issues previously left unsettled or in dispute. It is clear that we will never know some things because some agencies have no intentions to cooperate in any investigation.

New Revelation is not just a rehash of the any previous presentation of the Waco tragedy.  In my opinion, anyone who has any doubts about the events at Waco should view both the HBO presentation and very importantly, to really round out their knowledge see  ""Waco- New Revelations"".  It is, in my opinion, very important that we all understand just how far the government forces went during the 1993 operations at Waco. There were limitations on what law enforcement could do. Some of those limitations were ignored. Understand the repercussions suffered by law enforcement for ignoring those limitations which resulted in mass casualties- NONE.  Today there are far fewer limitations and the open use of naked military force and weaponry is planned by those in power when needed.  Good luck. I highly recommend this DVD.",1397347200,11,3418,4.789115646258503
