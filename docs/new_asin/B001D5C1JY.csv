8291775,5,B001D5C1JY,"On this dvd you will see the most epic cage of death matches in czw hosted by lobo and zandig.this dvd may only have three matches but those three matches are worth the buy.
  Matches:

1.cage of death 4:lobo vs. zandig-this match is pretty cool cause at the beginning it shows a video of lobo and his men holding zandig hostage to make him sign a contract to give up czw and forfeight the match. But zandig comes out and tells lobo he made him sign the wrong contract so they started the match and they electrified the cage and did some amazing stuff like when zandig jumped off of the platform onto lobo who was laying on tables and at the end when zandig threw lobo off the platforms onto glass and tables. The only problem i had with this match was it was kinda to short but don't get me wrong it was still an awesome match,9/10.

2.cage of death 5:team zandig(zandig,nick gage,lobo,wifebeater,and ian knoxx vs. team hi-v(the messiah,b-boy,adam flash,trent acid,johnny kashmere,nate hatred,and new jack)-Now to make one thing clear although the case says new jack is on zandigs team hes not cause when he comes in he turns on zandig and helps hi-v. This match is very good because they start at the beginning of the scaffold and have to make it to the other end where the cage of death is and there are two ways they could win one is where most of the wrestlers from one team have to come out of the cage of death and run to the beginning of the scaffold and the other way is for one team to make all members of the other team hit the floor. Also under the scaffold are two rings one which is the cage of death and the other ring is filled with thumbtacks. So this match is better than any wwe,tna,wcw,or ecw match cause there are amazing jumps from the cage and from the scaffold and alot of action all over the place. 10/10 nothing wrong with this match.

3.cage of death 6:team ca$h(chri$ caSh,jc bailey,nate webb,and seXXXy eddy) vs. the blkout(ruckus,sabian,eddie kingston,and jack evans)-The rules to this match were the same as the previous one where once someone hits the ground they are eliminated and the other way to win was to grab the tag team championship from Robbie Mireno and some other guy who i cant think of his name. At the beginning zandig came out and ordered robbie mireno and the other guy to be handcuffed to the platform. This match was just amazing nothing but weapons were used throughout the whole match like ladders,tables,chairs,thumbtacks,trashcans,and trashcan lids and this match was kinda different from cage of death 5 cause their was no scaffolding or ring filled with thumbtacks but their was two rings in the cage which was kool and these guys were just taking incredable falls from the cage and doing crazy moves like when seXXXy eddy did a moonsault off the top of the cage with the trashcan on his head which was kind of a mouth opener. 10/10 this match was just off the top action throughout the whole match.

Then on this dvd they had the highlights from cage of deaths 1,2,and 3 which were pretty good so i give all of the highlights a 10/10 i just whish they could have shown the entire match of cage of deaths 1,2,and 3.

So the summary of this dvd is its an awesome dvd, the highlights of cods 1,2,and 3 were good and the matches of cods 4,5,and 6 were epic, I highly recommend this dvd to fans of czw and ecw and fans of bloody violent wrestling,so trust me you will not be dissapointed when you buy this.total score of this dvd is 100/100.",1307836800,,3494,4.458528951486698
