8262633,5,B0016IKF78,"No, you do not have to be Jewish to adore and be moved by this wonderful, warm musical narrative by an amazingly talented Ellen Gould.  It does help to have an appreciation for the rich Eastern European Jewish culture, and maybe some familiarity with popular Yiddish phrases that have become part our language (translations always provided, though).  The stories of grandmothers and granddaughter, interwoven masterfully in an elegantly circular structure, come alive through selected photos, music and the storytelling that brings each character to life.
In a recent visit to the National Museum of Jewish American History in Phila, ( a must-see attraction) I recommended to the gift-shop staff to stock this DVD, as an expression of Jewish immigrant life as experienced by these generations of women.
I never regret the tears I always shed at the end; they are tribute to the women who lived such complex and challenging lives, and to the great talented woman who immortalizes them.",1357257600,,984,5.14375

8262635,5,B0016IKF78,"I saw this show performed years ago in San Francisco, bought the VHS when it came out, and recently found the DVD at Amazon.  The quality is great, the show is wonderful, timeless, even better than all the comfort food in the world.  Ellen is a very talented performer, the show seems to take on even more meaning over the years.",1234224000,,329,4.377049180327869
8262636,5,B0016IKF78,"How much do I love this performance? Funny you should ask. I first saw it on PBS many years ago. Either I didn't have a VHS recorder or they hadn't been invented yet; I don't recall which. I very much wanted my own copy. Flash forward to about five years ago. I saw a VHS on E-Bay; I ordered it and paid more than common sense allowed. I loved it just as much as when I'd seen it before. Now I see it's on DVD, which, as we all know, is better quality than VHS. So I'm ordering the DVD for myself and giving my VHS to my older sister who doesn't have a DVD player.

It made me laugh, it made me cry. Ellen Gould is amazing as she portrays both herself and her two grandmothers in the greatest one-woman show I've ever seen. The grandmothers are totally different from each other and Gould portrays them perfectly as they recall their lives and loves, the hard times and the good of their many years, and even take sly verbal potshots at each other. And at the end she pays a tribute to them that will leave a lump in the throat to anyone who has a heart.

I wish everyone could see this performance. And I'm not even Jewish.

And I swear, if I'm still alive when they come out with it in yet another improved format....!!!",1213920000,,1222,4.126050420168068
