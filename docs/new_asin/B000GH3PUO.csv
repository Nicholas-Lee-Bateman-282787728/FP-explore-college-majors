8132154,5,B000GH3PUO,"Every home should have this DVD series both for the Kids ( 2nd Grade to 8th grade) and for the elders. These DVD's explain in length and width about various basic concepts to in depth concepts on Force, Magnetism, Electricity, Plants etc etc. A great way to invest the parents money and superb way to invest the time of kids.",1343001600,,325,4.433333333333334
8132155,4,B000GH3PUO,"We watched the disc in this set that deals with physical science. It contained relevant information from my son's 9th grade physical science textbook even though the age range listed for the DVD is 9-14. The presentation kept the concepts simple to understand. The topics covered are matter: solids, liquids and gases, forces, light, magnetism, simple machines, sound, and waves in water. A good overview of physical science. This would be good for homeschoolers to use. Most science DVDs for kids that we have seen are too silly for a student studying physical science and seem to talk down to the viewer, but this one is an improvement on that. It treats the students like they are older than the early elementary grades. There is no prep for chemistry, however, which is understandable, given the fact that most of the target viewers will not be studying chemistry for a while yet.",1297123200,4,884,4.860927152317881
