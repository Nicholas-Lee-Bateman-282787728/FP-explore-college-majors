I have a little one who just loves watching diego and tring to find diego products in stores is impossible and most places I check tell me we had it last year but we don't carry it anymore so it was great that there are companies still offering diego products.,1361318400,,337,4.2

4503753,5,B004YVO61K,"I use Diego movies as rewards in my  Kindergarten classroom. They are educational and entertaining for young minds. We have a math program, called ST Math. Once a student has completed 100% of the program for their grade level (usually happens towards the end of the school year, and only half of my students finish the entire game) I give them their choice of DVD and 12 pack Phonics Scholastic book set. They love this and it really motivates them to focus and complete as many math puzzles as they can during computer time. This particular DVD is picked often by my students. They are drawn to the animals on the cover, especially the gorilla and the tiger. You can't go wrong with any of the Diego movies, especially when they average about $5 each.",1436659200,2,753,4.5777777777777775
