7857935,5,630393501X,"I originally saw this series back sometime in the 80's and found the series to be the most fascinating and riveting educational videos I have ever seen.  Gives the viewer a better understanding of all the natural forces on, above and in the Earth that transpire every minute of every day.  A must see for everyone!!  Richard Kiley does an excellent job narrating and the pictures and graphics are wonderfully done!  Bravo!",980899200,10,422,4.819444444444445
