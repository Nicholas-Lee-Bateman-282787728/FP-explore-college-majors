8276087,2,B001A5ES98,"I'm not a sports fan, but I figured it would still be funny.  Michael Strahan does deserve a break in comedy.  He should at least be invited to film an episode of ""SNL.""  However, this was not Chris Tucker or Margaret Cho-caliber work.  It shows football players and coaches being a bit funny.  Only if you are used to these men being so serious and professional would you find the contents here entertaining.  Then again, there were some funny moment regarding flatulence.  Outside of comedy, I learned what a K-ball is and how the rule on it was eaten by its exception.  Strahan does spliced-up old interviews like Jay Leno does.  This disc is really for men whose favorite time of the week is Monday nights in the autumn.",1250467200,,724,4.550387596899225
