2391111,5,B000AS6JTI,"Ive been a fan of indie movies for many years starting with the so-called B movie double features of the 1950s. Most of those films were shorter than major studio productions and worked well with the double feature format in theaters at the time. Although they were shorter in length they were usually rich in story content, action and impact. We Are Kings made me reminiscent of that forgotten genre. Its a true to life drama and musical featuring several different kinds of musicians - blues, rock, Americana, hip hop/rap - and how they combine to solve their own problems and each others. It is also an allegory of how older and younger generations happen to meet by coincidence and discover they have mutual interests as they travel through America as buskers in a surrealistic vehicle called The Blues Bucket. Movie fans that like the Malcolm McDowell musical/drama classic, O Lucky Man, will detect parallels. The actors in We Are Kings are actual musicians and excellent ones within their own genres. Another reflection to those great Bs of the 1950s is the absence of four letter words making this a great family film",1439251200,4,1125,4.83419689119171
2391112,5,B000AS6JTI,We Are Kings is a great independent low budget film.  It bring the Blues to life.  Absolutely great story line and I truly enjoyed the ending.  I am aware of a lot of the behind the scenes events since my daughter was the associate producer of the film.  Fantastic job by the very small crew that worked on the film.,1439078400,,316,4.216666666666667
2391113,5,B000AS6JTI,A terrific film that everyone should see. It helps understand the lives of musicians and their struggles. Great music. A plus for keeping the Blues alive!,1439078400,,154,4.961538461538462
2391114,5,B000AS6JTI,"My family loved this movie.  My son who is 7 watched it over and over again.  He loved the blues music.  Seeing the famous Rita Graham a former Raylet play this angelic character was delightful  .  Watching the great blues legend Sammy Blue was fun and funny.  I would not be surprise if this movie becomes a classic.  Great music through out.  This is the kind of movie whereas you get the family, pop popcorn, make a pitcher of  kool-aide, sit back relax and enjoy",1438905600,5,466,4.3882352941176475
2391115,5,B000AS6JTI,I absolutely loved this movie! Original music and great voices bringing THE BLUES front and center where it belongs!,1438560000,5,116,5.157894736842105
2391116,5,B000AS6JTI,"I found this to be a highly satisfying small, simple, but hugely charming movie musical. Correct that. The movie SEEMS simple and all that but belies a lot of depth because musicals are so hard to do, and so hard to pull off. I heard about it after reading Chuck Wilson's rave review in the New York Village Voice and Los Angeles Weekly...and he really said it. ""We Are Kings is that rare thing: a film about musicians where you actually look forward to the next song."" The original music of this low budget film far outpaces films with 100 times its budget! Great original songs from Boogie Long, the blues phenom, and Bianca Ryan, the girl that won the first season of America's Got Talent. Rita Graham was a Raelette supposedly, and she just kicks you know what, and Sammy Blue, the lead, is kind of a Samuel Jackson type...and a real blues player. Then there's the young teen rapper Pryce, the music is just incredible and it keeps going right up until the end. Oh...and last thing. Its a movie musical for the whole family! I watched it with my 5 year old daughter and 14 year old son there wasn't one swear word in the whole movie... yet the fourteen year old thought it was so cool. I did too!",1431820800,6,1200,4.385650224215246
2391117,5,B000AS6JTI,"this is still a ground breaking song and event. props to Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie  and Quincy Jones along with Harry Belefonte  with bringing this together. after all of these years this song still inspires and uplifts.",1389225600,2,225,5.054054054054054
2391118,4,B000AS6JTI,"I remember recording this myself when it first came out.  I loaned it to someone and never got it back.  This isn't a bad version of the original broadcast.  It's just missing a few scenes that I remember: the impromptu singing of ""Day-O"" for one.  It's really not too bad...just a little abreviated.",1245542400,,300,4.60377358490566
2391119,1,B000AS6JTI,"Content was interesting, too bad it only lasted 12 minutes. Huge dissapointment! Dont waste your time, sure you could find the clip on youtube or something.",1235347200,,156,5.038461538461538
2391120,5,B000AS6JTI,"In January, 1985, the celebrities in the ""ME GENERATION"" stepped outside their comfort zones to offer up this music video to raise money for the less fortunate in Africa and other parts of the globe. Thanks to Quincy Jones' superb leadership, world famous artists gathered together to create this inspirational and uplifting song and video, WE ARE THE WORLD, which reached people of all races worldwide. In an effort to end hunger, 8000 radio stations actually played the song together at the same hour to get the message out. For those of us who came of age during this time period, we remember well how much we scrambled to find the video being aired on MTV, that is how exciting this project was. It literally caught fire and since that time, many other artists have copied this concept, i.e. Live Aid, Band Aid, and countless more. But none came close to compiling as many super stars as WE ARE THE WORLD did nearly twenty years ago. Narrated by Jane Fonda, you'll enjoy seeing a young Bruce Springsteen, Michael Jackson (before his weird facial transformation), Kenny Loggins, Paul Simon, Steve Perry, Huey Lewis, Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles, Willie Nelson, Diana Ross, Hall & Oates, The Pointer Sisters, Tina Turner, Billy Joel, and the star studded list goes on and on. None of the people in this video were paid for their work, which even back then was a powerful statement of how much this cause meant to them. The videotape quality has eroded significantly over time, so hopefully a DVD version will be issued on its 25th anniversary in the year 2010. A must have for music fans and philanthropists of all generations.",1142553600,4,1644,4.792253521126761
2391121,3,B000AS6JTI,"If it were a high school project I'd give it five stars. Really low rent, but the music was very good.",1454630400,,102,3.9047619047619047
2391122,5,B000AS6JTI,I enjoyed We Are Kings. It's great for families and great for someone who loves the Blues.  Bianca Ryan from America's Got Talent stars in the film.  Lots of good guitar.,1451865600,,170,4.451612903225806
2391123,5,B000AS6JTI,"We Are Kings is an endearing, charming independent film with a lot of heart and great original blues music.  It's a classic down-and-out story where pieces of the puzzle start coming together in the most unexpected ways.  With ""music as salvation"" central to the plot, the film employs real-life musicians in the leading roles, and how they deliver!  Bluesman Sammy Blue, one of a vanishing breed in the tradition of Muddy Waters, heads the cast, and plays it as ""natural"" as if he was living it - and he probably has.  Rita Graham, a renowned, established artist and vocalist (and former Raylettte), plays his wife and, while in a coma, ""materializes"" in and out of scenes keeping everybody on the task at hand.  Boogie Long, Bianca Ryan, and Pryce Watkins are all great young artists who are central to the story and separately and together deliver some of the best down-home music that I've heard in a movie in a long time.  The fact that the film was shot in actual locations and not on a set gives it a documentary feel.  The opening scene in the blues club, the ""Blues Bucket"" RV (check those speakers on top), and the scene in the record executive's office are priceless (and sadly realistic in the latter case).  It all speeds towards and comes together in a great ending.  And, anyone who wants to hear more of Ms. Graham's wonderful voice should check out her website and listen to ""Because of You"", a beautiful song that could have fit nicely with this film.",1447113600,,1469,4.619230769230769
2391124,4,B000AS6JTI,"I'm a music fan - love good musicals and there just aren't that many.  This is a really nice movie - with terrific music that is an integral part of it. It's enjoyable from start to finish and worth watching more than once just to hear the songs again.  Good story, good characters, good music.  That makes it a winner in my book.",1443830400,,330,4.2063492063492065
2391125,5,B000AS6JTI,"This movie casts a spell and doesn't break it. The music and the settings are very well thought out and support the overall experience of the film. Highly enjoyable. I would recommend this to just about everyone, but especially if you like the Blues. It's worth getting the DVD, you'll want to watch this one again.",1443571200,,315,4.642857142857143
2391126,4,B000AS6JTI,"Great film, well worth the watch!  Leaves you feeling heartened for the future of independent film.",1442707200,,99,5.1875
2391127,5,B000AS6JTI,"This indie movie is a little miracle, like it happens, time to time, with indie movies. Just like if have a low budget required more qualities, ask to be better ... And that is all the movie is about. Toby Hubner shows  how difficult it is to live on its music, to live blues. Even great musicians with great original songs and real soul. The heart and a lot of creativity are those extra qualities  that will make the difference. That is of all that the movie is made .Really good. It is a success.",1442534400,,499,4.242105263157895
2391128,5,B000AS6JTI,Rarely does a movie come along that is as touching as this. Beautiful all around. They should make a part 2.,1441670400,2,108,4.190476190476191

2391130,5,B000AS6JTI,"I enjoyed the Blues music and story. The film was well edited and directed and held my attention. It was the best of both worlds-a story and a Blues concert all in one. If you like Blues, you'll like this film.",1440288000,,210,4.146341463414634
2391131,5,B000AS6JTI,"A small gem. During the summer, there are few good films to watch with many being high testosterone affairs.  Which is why We Are Kings is a breath of fresh air.  Great blues music and solid acting make this low-key film special.  And the blues here doesn't leave you down as it's a feel good affair.  Enjoy it.",1440115200,,311,4.310344827586207
2391132,5,B000AS6JTI,Toby Hubner is a wonderful comic voice.,1439856000,,39,4.714285714285714
2391133,5,B000AS6JTI,"This movie proves that you don't have a huge budget to make a heartfelt film with wide appeal. The movie captures the feelings of all ages, races and genders. It also has very powerful music performances by each of the Actor/musicians that enhance the story as it unfolds. By today's standards this is a small indie film but look and listen closer and you'll find a movie filled with heart and great life messages. I recommend this movie for families especially. There's not one scene that can't be watched by kids or granny! Bravo to the wonderful diverse cast of talented artists who make this movie a real life experience!",1439769600,2,625,4.6909090909090905
2391134,5,B000AS6JTI,"It's not often a low budget, independent film hits all the right notes: great music, great story, great characters.  The blues here is the real mccoy worth the price of admission all by itself.  The story is terrific and will appeal to all audiences, from families to adults.  Director/producer Hubner is a maestro at creating gems like this!",1439769600,4,342,4.862068965517241

2391136,5,B000AS6JTI,"I have watched this movie several times since I downloaded it and the music gets better on each viewing. The actors, who are primarily performers and singers in their own right, belt out some great songs, many of them original to the move.  The story line is simple enough but has some unexpected turns and delivers an uplifting message.  I enjoyed the humor. I give it a definite thumbs up.",1439683200,3,391,4.571428571428571
2391137,5,B000AS6JTI,"I love that movie ! Watched it many times . Once you ""meet""  those people and their music you don't want to leave them anymore , wish it never ends , goes on and on... This movie is an ode to the music, to the blues, played by authentic great musicians, with great original songs... Huge ! But this movie is a lot more. It's a beautifull travel across the states,a love and friendship story, it's a lesson of tenacity and solidarity, a message of hope. a lesson of life... for everyone, young and others...  And in top of this, a big  ""must ""to me,  this is made  with smartness, subtility and so much humor ! Very rare ! Toby Hubner realised an authentic jewel !  So with the appearence of a ""little ""movie,We are Kings is  a very great film .",1439596800,3,744,4.197183098591549
2391138,5,B000AS6JTI,"I really enjoyed this movie.  It was full of great music, related to loving people  who helped no matter the social status and it just kept my attention. The interaction between the participants in the movie felt so real. Music, good music and more good music. Really sad it wasn't given more air time. A hidden movie that should be seen by more people.",1439510400,2,353,4.5
2391139,5,B000AS6JTI,"If you're a lover of indie films and blues music you will absolutely enjoy this film. It grabs your attention from the very beginning. The story is gripping with crazy riffs as you follow the journey of this disparate group of musical souls and contemptible banker dudes.  The original music and vocals are  haunting at times - This movie shows the love, attention and keen insight of character development. A sharp ear for tempo and dedication to editing keeps the pace just right! Bravo~",1439424000,,489,4.809523809523809
