Here, it's a college student who looks about 48 with a manly mustache fighting thugs off with his machismo and eventually an awesome axe Glenn Danzig wold happily wave above his head at a concert. The guy then proceeds to do all manner of head chopping in the name of justice, education, and probably a man's right to have a gloriously bushy mustache.

The actions scenes are genuinely the best reason to watch the movie. It's a mash up of bollywood style super human physics defiance and bizarrely violent and gory fights. It's fun. They move smoothly, the gore effects are solid, and it's edited in a way that keeps enough spacial continuity for you not to have teleporting actors all over the place.

Worth a watch if you can find it.",1466640000,,851,4.629139072847682
