3666634,5,B001KN3MSI,"This DVD is a wonderful complement to Mathew Backholer's books. His books TELL us about revivals but this DVD SHOWS us visually some of those revivals. It takes us deep into the heart of the Welsh revival, the Hebridean revival and the Evangelical revival and through film footage and photographs documents a thorough account of what took place.

There are very few resources that show us revival stories pictorially and that is what makes this DVD so interesting. For example it is when you visually see the geography of the Hebridean islands that you realise just how astonishing some of the events were that took place. The DVD brings to life the people behind these moves of God and clarifies the teamwork approach that arose to enable and carry these revivals. This DVD also demonstrates beautifully the kindness and love God has for our nation.

This DVD stirs and challenges. This is another great resource from the ByFaith Media team.",1356998400,3,942,4.88125
3666635,5,B001KN3MSI,This is a powerful dvd which shows what God can do when people pray. It gives ample time to reflect what you have watched before the next item appears. Recommended viewing.,1313366400,4,172,4.580645161290323
3666636,5,B001KN3MSI,"Revival is the need of the hour
It's the only thing that can give you real power
My hear was a dark tower
And now its as viberant as a flower.

3666637,2,B001KN3MSI,"This video was a Great disappointment. It is poorly put together and extremely low budget. buy a good book on revival instead, don't waste your money. Better yet, download some free sermons by Campbell from SermonIndex.com.",1293494400,,223,5.222222222222222
3666638,5,B001KN3MSI,"The Great Christian Revivals DVD encouraged me to continue praying earnestly that the Holy Spirit would bring revival again as He has so many times in the past. It is abundantly clear that we are in great need of a spiritual awakening in America, Europe, and around the world. And if God did it before, He can and will do it again in response to the prayers of His people. This DVD tells the story of three different times when God brought revival to the British Isles--using beautiful photography, haunting music, Scripture verses, quotes, and commentary. All of which is much more effective, uplifting, and engaging than simply reciting for the camera dates, places, and circumstances. The Great Christian Revivals DVD is perfect for sharing with Christian friends and small groups in your church. If you own one DVD on revival, this should be it. Highly recommended. Our abiding hope is that the result of our heartfelt prayers will be God again parting the heavens and coming down to us in great power.",1279756800,8,1006,4.820809248554913
3666639,5,B001KN3MSI,"Great Christian Revivals is a fact- and spirit-filled documentary detailing the movement of the Holy Spirit through Wales, the New Hebrides, and other parts of Great Britain.

The film concentrates on those who were called upon to start the Revivals, followed by how the Spirit of the Lord moved throughout His people to establish His presence upon them and their community.

For example, during the Hebridean revival it was usual for Coal Miners to attend Church until the early hours of the morning, leave to go directly to work, but be so still under the influence of the Holy Spirit that they would fall to their knees along the roads and pray to God for more of Him.

If you want to see just how the Lord can move when we let him, then I recommend this DVD for your Spirit and your edification. Don't miss it!",1253664000,13,814,4.523809523809524
3666640,5,B001KN3MSI,The film helped our bible study group get excited about praying for God to send a revival again for this generation and this nation....... The film is well done..,1242432000,7,162,4.620689655172414
3666641,5,B001KN3MSI,"Although the DVD is somewhat ""slow-in-pace"" it is very informative. If you are interested in Revivals it would be a great asset to your collection. The stories always come to life when you see the actual places a and pictures of the actual people involved.",1236988800,3,256,4.711111111111111
8315431,5,B001KN3MSI,If you have a heart for revival this is a great place to view what God has done in the past. Surely we must have a great revival in the land and God is not withholding revival from us but we must meet the conditions (See 2 Chronicles 7:14). May God make us steady as these dear ones were to remain faithful and proclaim the Gospel.,1526688000,,331,4.03030303030303
