6366048,4,B00JKE4VBQ,"When The Purge hit theaters last year it wasn't immediately identifiable as a Blumhouse production. There weren't any demonic spirits or evil poltergeists like in their small-budget smashes like Paranormal Activity and Insidious. But the film's ingenious, deviously brilliant premise and hefty profit margin were all the clues one needed to know the horror kings could have their next great franchise, but only if The Purge: Anarchy had the balls to confront its combative political themes head on. Fortunately for us, it does.

They say politics is a bloodsport and The Purge: Anarchy takes that idea to a whole new level of extreme. Limiting itself to a home invasion thriller kept writer/director James DeMonaco in check and away from the socio-political themes merely hinted at. But now he goes full rabble-rouser in a film that indulges in the excesses of violence while serving as an allegory for today's destructive economic climate. The basic premise is the same only now we finally get to see it played out in all its terrible glory. Thanks to a hyper-conservative government led by the New Founders of America, a single night of the year known as the Annual Purge allows for people to commit wanton acts of violence without fear of legal retribution. Basically, murder is legal and on that night roving packs of masked, armed thugs wander the streets looking for victims. The result is lower unemployment, lower crime rate....oh, and fewer of those worthless poor people who can't afford top notch security systems to protect themselves. Surely that couldn't be the point of all this, right? To wipe out the lower-class citizens to favor the wealthy?

In what quickly begins to resemble a new age version of The Running Man, we follow the enigmatic and vengeful Sergeant (Frank Grillo) as he dares to head out into the streets during the Purge. So right away you know he's a badass to brave that kind of madness, but his quest for revenge is sidetracked by saving waitress Eva (Carmen Ejogo) and her daughter Cali (Zoe Soul) after they are kidnapped by mysterious government agents. They've just seen their terminally ill father sacrifice himself to a wealthy family for a large sum of money, proving that the rich really do like to get their hands dirty....but only when it's to take advantage of the less fortunate. Also getting in his way are Shane (Zach Gilford) and Liz (Kiele Sanchez), a couple on the verge of separating who get stuck on the side of the road with nowhere else to go. The five must navigate the city streets and survive until the Purge ends in the morning, avoiding masked goons with enough firepower to take over a small country.

But DeMonaco throws more than just run 'n gun thrills into the mix, spinning a couple of compelling mysteries that pay dividends in the long run. The real cause for Sergeant's actions are left in shadow and color his every decision, especially when his companions start to become too much of a distraction. He's constantly at odds with the feisty Cali, who believes in the fiery rhetoric of an anti-Purge rebel group (led by Michael K. Williams) that resembles a faction of the Black Panther Party. While there are plenty of bullet-riddled bodies the physical violence is secondary to the nastiness of a system where the wealthy auction off poor people to be hunted down like prey. But DeMonaco, recognizing the parallels to the vast wealth disparity in our country today, makes it clear that it need not be this way, putting the weapons to fight back in the hands of the downtrodden. In one pertinent image, a wealthy white collar criminal is murdered and strung up as a warning to the upper class to watch their asses. As the lily-white power players and redneck gun nuts are made to look like dangerous clowns, DeMonaco perhaps goes a little overboard with his anti-establishment, anti-gun rhetoric. But the power of the message and the seamless way it is woven into an effectively rugged survival genre can't be ignored. Nor can it be understated just how much it means to have a genuine tough guy like Grillo in the lead role. He's been great in other movies before (like Captain America: The Winter Soldier) and it's about time he had a chance to shine on his own.

The Purge: Anarchy draws you in with promises of gore but hooks you with surprisingly insightful, uniquely American political activism.",1405641600,,4372,4.840909090909091
6366049,2,B00JKE4VBQ,"""The Purge: Anarchy"" is what is best called an 'almost movie'. You can tell great strides were taken to expand on the mythology set forth with the story of the purge and the people behind it, it has a lot of powerful moments where the audience is forced to reflect on how the poor are repeatedly abused and manipulated by the rich and there are quite a few unexpected and well-appreciated twists in the plot but the suspense never really culminates like it did in the original. The fresh batch of characters could not be any different than those in the first film but they are never fully fleshed out in any satisfying way. This movie wants to be something bigger, better and more than it is but once the still fresh and novel premise gets going after a rather slow first half hour it never seems to know how to propel the movie beyond a collection of near-escapes and unexpected explosions of violence.

  This is more personal preference than anything but this is more like ""Aliens"" compared to the more cerebral ""Alien"". It is more of an action picture than an intense horror story and from my point of view this was most conflicting of all. I appreciated the fact that they were not replication what had been done again but instead went for an almost completely new tone altogether but, at the same time it doesn't provide a means for the audience to become as connected as they should to the events and gives it the feel of just another overstuffed Hollywood blockbuster with long bouts of gun fire and explosions to hide the fact that not much is really happening.

  It's a notch below the original but I wouldn't be quick to dismiss it as not worth watching. Perhaps with the next installment, if the day may come, the full potential of the premise could finally be honed and something as unique as the story itself may finally arise when the purging begins and elevate this series to where it wants to go, instead of operating off of thriller clichs as comfort food for the audience.",1405641600,,1992,4.534818941504178

6366070,4,B00JKE4VBQ,"This is a scary movie but not in the sense of monsters or supernatural occurrences. To live in a society where it is lawful to kill, murder, and maim even if for only a few hours is horrifying to think about. The people in this movie have so much pent up hatred in them towards others, it is terrifying to see them act out their aggression on one another. There is much gratuitous violence and impending violence throughout this movie that leaves the viewer with heightened emotions for the victims as well as the attackers. The only reason I gave it four stars is because I was rooting for the group of survivors trying to escape these evil people. It is a dark, ominous, edge-of-your-seat movie that makes your heart race, your blood boil, and pray for the hours of ""purging"" to end.",1509494400,,785,4.496503496503497

6366113,4,B00JKE4VBQ,"Easily the best of the three Purge movies, this one at least spends some considerable time in the streets during the yearly purge, rather than just being a home invasion film like the first and third movies pretty much are.  Still under the ""all crime is legal"" opportunity it doesn't spend much time on any other crimes other than murder, you'd think there would be plenty of people robbing places, that have expensive items or cash so they wouldn't have to work the others days of the year.  Their own workplaces would be one where they'd even have keys so they don't even need to break in.  Worst thing that could happen to them is they get fired the next day.  Like with the first, I still don't understand why those who don't want to kill someone, don't just leave America, it's not like it cost that much to drive to Canada or Mexico.  There may be a reason why this can't happen perhaps the USA has become like East Berlin was and citizens can't leave anymore but it isn't outlined in the film. Plus you have hospitals opening minutes after the Purge ends, where were all the medical staff to get there and open that quick.  Again in the rules it doesn't state hospitals or there staff are immune. Surely you'd see vandalism, perhaps even destruction of hospitals, along with the electricity grid, trains and bus depots (we do see a bus on fire in this one).  There would need to be more rules and off limits areas for this night to be plausible.",1490486400,,1453,4.460377358490566
6366114,4,B00JKE4VBQ,"When I saw the trailer for the first Purge movie, I thought it was a wildly innovative idea and I absolutely loved it! I was so excited to see the film, unfortunately it amounted to little more than a slasher movie. The story had all the potential in the world, but they really didn't go into it, they just wanted to show off the violence and hatred people had towards one another. I was hoping they would correct this in the sequel and boy did they ever! Anarchy isn't about some family hunkered down in their home, fighting off attackers. In the second installment of the Purge, we learn a lot more about it. The pro and anti-purge factions that exist, the professional companies that make a fortune off that one night, the way the rich purge, and the main story which centers around what happens on the streets when two families are trapped outside on purge night. Two families are easy pickings until they find Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo), a man on a mission that he can only complete on Purge night. Barnes however is a man of conscience and won't complete his mission until he begrudgingly gets the families to safety, which means a wild trek through the city. The Purge: Anarchy is a wild ride through a city of ordinary people turned into killers, with home made weapons, booby-traps, and pure anarchy, just as the title promises. If you're looking for action and violence, there are a million places to turn, that's not what the appeal of this movie is. It's the idea, that crime virtually is nonexistent, except for this one night, where society turns on each other. Where almost everyone's craziest fantasy becomes reality and just how some people react. What will each character turn into when they are allowed to do whatever they want? How does society feel about this law and is the benefit worth the cost? This story has just so many directions it can go in, that why I'm not surprised to hear they're working on a fourth film. The Purge series may just be a series of action/slasher films, but this one idea puts a whole new spin on them and makes you see things through a whole different set of eyes and I for one think it's ingenious.",1490486400,,2150,4.5295629820051415

6366318,3,B00JKE4VBQ,"Pros of The Purge 2:
 Better acted than the first one
 It has characters you actually want to survive, versus the creepy kid and stupid teenager and droll parents in the first one.
 More interesting plot with more revelations that are likely given the politics behind the story
 It is better than Purge 3, where the liberal political messaging is so loud it drowns out the story

Cons of The Purge 2:
 The movie is sexist, showing the white girlfriend to be smarter and more competent than the boyfriend who gets shot, the Hispanic mother and daughter to be more moral and capable than the white guy risking his life to protect them.
 The movie is racist. Barring one angry Hispanic wife with a cheating spouse and a black guy hustling for rich white people, ALL the evil violent purgers are white, mostly rich whites. Some people describe this as classist, but at least the first movie had a rich black woman to balance it out.
 The movie has strong political messaging that is outright wrong. Capitalism isn't killing people; the communism the black hero of the movie calls for killed 100 million people last century from Stalin to Pol Pot to Communist Cubas army murdering people in Angola.",1476576000,2,1193,4.6746411483253585

6366324,4,B00JKE4VBQ,"This is the sequel to the sleeper hit, ""The Purge,"" set in a near future where the government has set one night a year aside where all emergency services and laws are suspended until dawn. The night is called the Purge. Leo (Frank Grillo) plays a man who's determined to avenge his son's death, and wants to use the Purge to do it. But he comes across a group of people trapped outside during the Purge, and becomes a reluctant leader charged with getting them through the night alive.

On its own, this is a great movie. As we meet the main characters and count down to the Purge, the sense of urgency and panic is palpable. The characters are not incredibly deep, but we learn enough to care about them. Once the Purge starts, the atmosphere of chaos is awesome with roving bands in scary masks, people killing and running around, and a desperate fight for survival at every turn. I'm surprised this movie got away with a R, because I lost count of how many people got killed. There's also some political commentary as Leo discovers a government conspiracy, and the real reason behind the Purge.

The Purge series has been successful because of its core concept, which is very compelling. But I've been waiting for ""Purge"" to live up to its premise, and I don't think it ever will. This concept should lend itself to questions about morality, whether it would tempt ""normal"" people into murder, and what consequences society would face by removing all laws. Hearing the idea, one asks themselves, ""Would I be a criminal if the government removed all punishment? Would I kill or steal? What would an anarchic world be like?"" But it seems like the creator has no idea what to do with the idea. The first movie was a home-invasion thriller. ""Anarchy"" has been reduced to a slasher movie. Neither really delivers.

The movies take the idea that people would turn into crazed killers if given the chance, and I'm not sure I agree with that. I'd like to see more of the thought process of normal people wrestling with temptation. Every now and then, in ""Anarchy,"" we saw glimpses of people in the Purge, and I always wished we could understand who they are and what drives them. I would have also liked to have seen Leo wrestling with his decision to kill before he went out. Instead, ""Anarchy"" is just about watching people running around and killing.",1475712000,,2348,4.6124401913875595

6366345,3,B00JKE4VBQ,"Part thriller, part social critique, writer-director James DeMonaco's $3 million entry The Purge last year grossed more than $89 million worldwide - a sure sign a sequel would follow.

Happily, unlike most horror sequels, The Purge: Anarchy, which opens Friday, isn't a cheap knock-off but an equally effective, deliciously disturbing movie. It's bound to delight genre fans (and dismay critics, who attacked the first as heavy-handed and sloppy).

The Purge: Anarchy further develops the series' conceit: America in the near future is a haven with virtually no unemployment, a low crime rate, and a thriving economy. The nation owes its transformation to the Purge. Once a year for 12 hours, Americans may commit any crime - murder is recommended - without prosecution.

This bacchanal of blood gives folks a chance to exorcise their rage and frustration. It also has a social effect: Since most victims are poor, sick, indigent, or undocumented, the Purge culls the population, saving the government untold dollars.

The Purge was a claustrophobic chamber piece about one family's attempts to keep murderous intruders out of their house.

Blessed with a larger (undisclosed) budget, The Purge: Anarchy is splashed across a much wider canvas. DeMonaco opens up the story with multiple locations, more characters, and an intricate, if sometimes puerile, plot.

Frank Grillo stars as a Man With No Name equipped with an armored muscle car and a huge gym bag full of guns 'n' ammo. He plans to use the Purge to avenge the death of his young son.

Straight out of a spaghetti western, Grillo's character is a man of few words whose stoic exterior masks an inner life rent by torment and tragedy. His mission is interrupted when he decides to help several people stranded on the street, including a spoiled yuppie couple (Zach Gilford and Kiele Sanchez) and a diner waitress (Carmen Ejogo) and her younger sister (Zoe Soul).

Impressive, blood-soaked set pieces follow as the group is attacked by legions of homicidal maniacs on their way across Los Angeles.

DeMonaco livens the proceedings by introducing a new type of Purge villain, the super-rich. Too civilized to hunt themselves, they send out mercenaries to round up victims and corral them in swanky killing clubs.

But the film enters Monty Python territory as it shows society's high and mighty in resplendent gowns and black tie bidding thousands of dollars for the right to finish off one poor sap or the other.

Things go from strange to silly with the entrance of a group of revolutionaries that wants to destroy the Purge.

However, if you accept its goofy premise, The Purge: Anarchy will give you a mighty fun time.",1474588800,,2678,5.020316027088036

6366502,5,B00JKE4VBQ,"I could easily sit here and talk about the social implications and significance of this movie but, I will review this on it's entertainment value.
Like the first movie, this one starts the day of the purge. This movie surrounds a couple nearing divorce, a mother - daughter duo, and a man whose background is clearly bad ass.
While the couple and the duo are strictly trying to stay alive, the man has a destination. This movie follows them through the most dangerous night of the year attempting survival. They flow from one messed up situation to the next and I enjoyed seeing how everything panned out.
I have seen negative reviews on this movie but I saw this as a natural progression of the first. You have a chance to see more clearly, what the Purge is really about. The appearance of a resistance group is only expected, however I think they could have done this a bit differently. It is more grisly than the first and the people are more desperate but I feel like this is how should be in a society like this.
Great movie, I really enjoyed it and I actually like that you don't have to be familiar with the first one to enjoy this one.",1469318400,,1144,4.400943396226415

The world created in the original Purge is continued and expanded in Anarchy though without any direct correlation to the original film.

6366664,5,B00JKE4VBQ,"Do you miss DIE HARD series?
This will be the one that make your adrenaline pump up your heart all the way.
I don't really get excited this much for action movies usually but this one was pretty good and it really doesn't matter if you have seen the first one or not so do not at all times think about watching the first to consider picking up this because this is way way superior then the first and it's acually not a sequal at all althought all three include the one that is not playing in the theater now is directed the same guy.
The director only directs action movies and so far he made only four include three sequal and one more which is <SATAN ISLAND> that is also a very decent action flick.

The movie is about the future world where there is no crime thanks to one day which is all kinds of violence, law breaking, everything is possible. They call it a PURGE.
Many people come out to the street and kill people, revenge. pull out their grudge.

There are this guy who's son is dead by this guy who was drunk and drove. He wants to revenge by killing him.
There is this couple who's car was broken and couldn't go home safe before 6 PM the PURGE starts.
There is this mother and a daughter who were pulled out from their house from the guys who want to do the PURGE by killing them.
All they need is someone to help.
The guy who wants his son's revenge helps them by using his rifles and the fight begins.
Even there are some people do this crazy ritual kind of thing by gather rich people who want to see Purge by paying a lot of money.
All of these people were kidnapped for the show at last.
There they are in that show in this movie set like place. If you imagine John Woo's movie <HARD TARGET> you can have more understanding what this is about. Paying money for seeing people killied kind of stuff.
They are doing everything to be survived. They team up and they finally had this crazy gun fight and they survived.
The fight was very intensive and action packed.

Also the street fight with guns are as great as any other great acion movies you've ever seen in your life.

The director used the city enviornment very well and it turned out that the look of this movie was like <MIAMI VICE> or something. Cool and stone cold city. With lights. Urgan battle.

There is no single moment you will feel that the movie is dragging at all. It is all tensed and nervouse and make you want to grab your hand to make a fist.

As the annual Purge is on the horizon, an anti-Purge resistance group hacks into nationwide television stating that the Purge is meant to eliminate the poor and that ""cleansing the soul of aggression"" is all smoke and mirrors.

Meanwhile, married couple, Shane and Liz are en-route to Shane's sister's house to wait out the Purge, but run into bad luck when their car breaks down, just moments before the Purge is set to commence. Their only hope for survival lies within Sgt. Leo Barnes; a vigilante so to speak, looking to avenge the loss of his son. Leo must use his skills and aggression to guarantee survival for himself as well as the vulnerable couple.

This movie was made with a lot more money and the special effects were awesome.

With that, keep in mind that the director is anti-gun, which explains the social commentary by the black activists. Ironically, in this movie like the one before, the guns are the heroes and are used by both the good guys and bad guys, they also use knives and machetes on some occasions.

For a night where everything is legal to do, I never saw any looting, buildings being set on fire, or all that much violence considering the circumstances. The filmmakers seem to think there would just be a small number(I say small in comparison to the millions that live in that city) of lunatics out with only murder on the mind. You're telling me that it's the one night of the year where you could steal ANYTHING you want and no one is seen looting in the movie? I'm thinking if you're car is sabotaged and you're left on foot, the streets aren't going to be as empty as they were here. In fact, just because the purge has an official start time doesn't mean people wouldn't start early. You think the police are going to answer emergency calls anywhere close to the start time? There's just so much wrong with the film that I'll just stop now before this turns into an even more lengthy rant.

6366967,3,B00JKE4VBQ,"The Purge (2013) was perfection.  I like what DeMonaco was ""trying"" to do with this sequel, but he missed the target this time--which is especially shocking when considering his mastery in capturing the atmosphere of the first.  As such, I'd advise you to watch Anarchy if you're a Frank Grillo fan more than if you're a Purge fan.  This really wasn't a terrible movie--just not at all a good one.

With the Purge eliminating poverty and unemployment (presumably by ""deleting"" undesirables), the United States is a wonderful place in 2023.  A wonderful place because of the inner demons cleansed by 12 murderous hours once a year.

Writer/director James DeMonaco (The Purge, The Purge: Election Year) tries to impress us by re-introducing us to the Purge, its supporters and vocal resistance, practitioners and abstainers.  Instead of unleashing the beast by laying siege to Ethan Hawke's house, we follow some unwilling Purge participants stranded out in the streets on the most dangerous night of the year.  They serendipitously end up being led by Frank Grillo (The Grey, Warrior, Mother's Day, Captain America: The Winter Soldier), who dominates the screen and manages to make this otherwise sorry sequel watchable with his mysterious Purger-with-a-secret.  But wait he ""is"" out on Purge night so it begs the questioncan they trust him?

We see how the lower, middle and upper class purge.  Unfortunately, we're already quite familiar with this world from the stellar performances in the original The Purge (2013) and nothing new is really offered beyond this change in perspective.  That's not to say that the sociopaths preparing for the Purge, eerily waving at their soon-to-be victims wasn't unnerving--it just lacked the degree of undiscovered menace that made its predecessor so shiny and new.

It's like the thrill of discovery in learning the secrets and nuance of The Matrix (1999), followed by the disenchanted reaction of revisiting its inner workings in The Matrix: Reloaded (2003).  But this comparison really isn't fair.  The Matrix: Reloaded (2003) is still awesome much as the Silver or Bronze medalist at the Olympics would compare to the Gold-toting original (1999), whereas Anarchy is more like a fat guy with type-II diabetes and a sprained ankle compared to the two-time winner of the Boston Marathon that is The Purge (2013).  But let me tell you how I really feel

Outside of our solid lead cast, the secondary actors provision the screen with stale performances.  The social allegory that was once so organically powerful now feels forced and the new commentary intended to add intrigue to the story (and the social/political evolution of The Purge) is delivered in such a manner that it falls flat.

Seeing this makes me want to go back and watch The Purge (2013) again--which I found to be perfection.  I like what DeMonaco was ""trying"" to do with this sequel, but I fear that he missed the target this time--which is especially shocking when considering his mastery in capturing the atmosphere of the first.  As such, I'd sooner advise you to watch Anarchy if you're a Frank Grillo fan than if you're a Purge fan--however, Purge fans won't want to miss it as it will clearly bridge us into the third installment's plot.  But with that said, this really wasn't a terrible movie--just not a good one and definitely doing zero justice to part one.  I didn't hate it.  I won't be buying it either  Not unless it comes at a discount in a triple movie blu-ray pack with The Purge: Election Year.",1458518400,,3520,4.965870307167235

The characters are much more likable than in the original movie.  There are still some logistical stretches (as there are with most all action movies) but none of them are egregious enough to detract from the overall movie.  The plot is ultimately one of revenge as the main character (a former military bad ass) sets about to kill someone who wronged him.  Along the way he picks up 4 other survivors who got caught out on the unsafe streets and he does his best to protect them.  I wish they would have put a little more focus on character building even if it meant cutting down on some of the action, but this is one of the better action movies to come out in recent years.",1450310400,,826,4.401315789473684

All the people who disagree with the Purge are minorities (black) and the ones who think it is AWESOME and exploit the poor arewell, of course white. Even the henchmen of the rich arewhite. Imagine that! Between people just too dumb too live (who goes grocery shopping at all let alone that far away from home this night of the Purge?) and the obvious in-your-face-politicking...my blood pressure was just climbing.

The first Purge was intelligent and provoked debate. It wasn't ham-fisted. I don't really know why I finished the movie other than it was kind of like a traffic accident and you just can't stop looking as much as you want to stop.

6367065,4,B00JKE4VBQ,"Thankfully, this is lightyears away from the original film. There is a rich selection of settings and subplots. And only one deus ex machina, versus the first film which had two.
This film also goes a little deeper into the politics of The Purge's universe and makes it that much better because of it. The strange thing is, it defies traditional dystopia in a way, by allowing for free speech. This entire premise would be better in a fictional country. It seems to simply use the United States because it's a package they can use things from (ie, flag logo, America the Beautiful).
In terms of cinematography it wasn't as poor as The Purge. True darkness was only introduced in the third act, and then it was used wisely.
In terms of writing, it seems to merge ""class struggle"" into a dystopian script.

6367068,1,B00JKE4VBQ,"Anyone who thinks this movie is any good has no idea what a good film is. Even for the genre it is a horrible example with a weak politically correct moralization that guns are bad, and rich white people are preying on the poor and particularly the minorities. From what I saw people were still killing people with guns, axes and machetes or what have you. So until Skynet takes over, people will still be killing people with whatever tool they see fit to use. Gun free zones are just target rich environments for maniacs who will obtain a gun or guns no matter what. Israel has had a problem with Palestinians stabbing their citizens, perhaps they should create knife/shank free zones, I'm sure the Palestinians will stop stabbing people in those places right? Obviously it's better to have trained armed individuals to protect people where they are concentrated such as schools. Anyway, back to the movie. I waited until it was free and watched about 30 minutes of it. It is garbage and has no entertainment value unless you really get of on pointless gratuitous violence. What is said is that the overall rating for this movie is a four. What does this say about our society?

6367168,4,B00JKE4VBQ,"You can enjoy James DeMonacos The Purge: Anarchy without watching its predecessor The Purge by the same director. Maybe you should start with the second installment of the series (the third one is in production) as The Purge: Anarchy is better than the first one.

During the annual Purge night  when everything is allowed legally including murder  five people are stranded in the streets of Los Angeles. One of them happens to be a police sergeant (Frank Grillo), who attempts to lead the rest of the group to safety, but this unnamed sergeant has a reason to be out at night.

The sergeants secret agenda is not difficult to detect. This is a thriller of which premise is basically that of The Most Dangerous Game, with a very political aspect like haves and have-nots. At least, the concept of the Purge sounds more credible here than in the first film (which was about a wealthy family living in a fancy house  why didn't they just leave the country for a day or two?)

This time characters are more believable and the pace is faster. And Frank Grillo is impressive as a sort of action hero. The Purge: Anarchy may not be a classic, but still is an enjoyable B-film thrill ride.",1438819200,,1182,4.578199052132701

6367219,5,B00JKE4VBQ,"In and of itself. this is a great action/suspense movie. The main drawback is that it is a piece of leftist, Anti-America, Anti-Success, Anti-Gun piece of propaganda. It is also, by it's very essence, Anti-White Christian. I will not spoil it for you by explaining my statement. One only needs to watch it, and it will be clearly revealed. And, as you can see from the rating, I did enjoy the movie and recommend you watch.  But do so with the understanding that it is a great movie tainted by Hollywood's Elite Hypocrites. Some of the wealthiest people are those who act, direct, write, and produce. They will speak anti-gun and anti-capitalism, yet make themselves wealthy with gun-filled action flicks just like this one. It is like a vegetarian being the head chef at a huge BBQ festival at which he sells his meaty dishes for huge profits. You may be of the mind to keep you money and not support their hypocrisy. I understand that. But I would rather enjoy the movie for the movies sake, and then shine the light on their dark maleficence and call them what they are. Of course, these ones direct the hatred of the feeble minded towards Big Business, Corporate America, etc. And they paint themselves as the Holier than Thou leaders possessed of some moral high ground. This they are not. They are descendants of a group once viewed by society as less than common street whores. They have raised themselves up, for sure, but not they alone. They had help from the movie loving public. I have helped them. I am their benefactor AND their target. Behold, the Fools!",1436313600,4,1569,4.643884892086331

6367235,5,B00JKE4VBQ,"This movie is fantastic.  Frank Grillo is absolutely great in this movie.  He is going places as an actor.  If I remember he will be in Captain America Civil War as a villain, a great pick.  This movie says a lot about our society, the frustrations, the anger, the desire for revenge. Most of the main characters are not out for revenge or anything like that, through bad luck they find themselves out on purge night, which as you might imagine is very dangerous.  I hate when these Amazon review include spoilers without warning so rest assured there are none here.  But I will say Grillo plays the villain who has a heart, and he is fantastic in this movie. One small criticism of the movie are the prayers thanking the founding fathers like there is some sort of religion behind this.  There is not, this is government policy (the purge) and the prayers are out of place which detracts ever so slightly from the movie, but not enough to make this 4 stars.  This is a great movies with a dark and simultaneously uplifting view of humanity.  If you haven't seen this movie then you should, it is well worth it.",1434844800,,1111,4.46039603960396

Now there is more to this story I haven't mentioned  but why spoil it. The storyline is marvellous the cast did a fabulous performance creating the mood making you feel at home in the plot.  I rated this an A grade plus for the ideas that come thick and fast with that touch of spice to get your nerves going, does that help you in anyway if not, take your time run down to the local store collect your munchies and drinks plus the movie and slowly walk home and get set for a haunting night of terror with full on entertainment you won't be disappointed I'm sure you won't have time to relax, now will you.

6367257,3,B00JKE4VBQ,"The first Purge movie has pretty interesting and provided more than just being the horror flick it was advertised as. With this new movie they expand on this alternate world they build and give you a different view of movie's namesake. Much like the first movie there is a lot to like in this film, and just like the previous movie there are also a few shortcomings. In spite of a few missteps The Purge: Anarchy delivers on the premise and is a fitting complement to the original film. Seeing both together tells me there is some real potential for a series of movies beyond these two.

The Purge: Anarchy is about two groups of people inadvertently stuck outside during the Purge... and one man who is out willingly. This lone man agrees to help the others get to safety before the night is through. In case you haven't seen the first film the Purge is a single night out of the year where the rule of law no longer applies and you can do whatever you want to just about anybody you want. It was created as a stopgap to balance out the harsh punishments given the rest of the year for even the most minor offenses. The country claims this methodology is what keeps crime and unemployment down to 1%, but is there something more to Purge Night than what is let on? This is what the movie explores while chronicling what's happening to this group stuck in the thick of it.

The first Purge movie was a reflection of a well to do family who is desensitized about the Purge and get thrust into a situation that opens their eyes Anarchy moves the concept further into a developing story about what the Purge is all about as opposed to what everybody is being told it is. While that is the big reveal and the plot that makes the movie worthy of further installments the real meat of the story is in the two groups trying to survive. From there you have a human story with people who are more than just horror movie victims. They are scared, but they don't panic and do stupid things. They have their frailties and issues, but they are played with enough subtlety to enhance the story instead of creating melodrama. In other words you have an easy time getting to know them and caring what happens to them. The lone wolf in the group also turns out to be a very complex character with a very satisfying conclusion to his story.

So while these people are trying to stay alive you also get a good look at various groups and individuals purging in the streets. So purging is essentially murder, as you don't see much of any other crimes happening. So you get to see this in action in some creative ways from the crackpot sniping on the rooftops to trucks with flamethrowers burning hobos. It can get a tad droll with the many Purgings, but it's manageable.  Then you have the government conspiracy, and this is where things start to go off the rails for me. It's not that I don't enjoy a good conspiracy, and these Purge movies build up a doozy. It's that it comes off a bit heavy handed and even amateurish. Maybe not student film amateurish, but enough to make me feel this subject matter could have done with more finesse and subtlety in order to drive the point home better. This more than anything else limits the film from being a pretty good one to a potentially great one.

This movie is a serious departure from the first in that there really is not a single hint of this being a horror/thriller movie. While The Purge hit us with a few horror style zingers (mostly creepy poses and a few startling ""gotchas"") Anarchy dispenses with any pretense of the film being in the horror genre. This is a straight up drama/thriller film with a mild action/adventure style mixed in. The most this film gets to that level is a street gang that wears creepy masks and strike creepy poses. This is a good thing. Much of the horror genre gets lots in stereotypical themes and plot elements. This movie is able to ride on its own story without borrowing much from others.

The video quality on the blu-ray is superb, and that's saying a lot as this movie is done in the dark of night for most of the run time. The shadows don't ever overtake the image and you still get to see everything clear, even if dark. The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 gives you lots of atmospheric noises that put you in the middle of a riot in the streets at times. There is also DTS 5.1 in Spanish and French (plus subtitles for all). The extras are really thin with only two to speak of. Behind the Anarchy is a generic making of featurette that screams promotional plug. There are also five deleted scenes that don't do a bad job of added character development. I wouldn't mind seeing a director's cut with a few those added. The real crime here is no director commentary...again! James DeMonaco this is your chance to really flesh out this world you created. Is it that hard to sit in front of a mic and talk about it?

The Purge: Anarchy as a single film is pretty good. As a film in a series it's even better. I'm hoping James DeMonaco doesn't stop here and takes us to an eventual conclusion with this concept of his. If you are straight up looking for a horror flick of any level you are not going to get it here. If you liked the story of the first one and are aching for some satisfaction this movie delivers. If you are a fan of dystopic settings that sit on the edge of post-apocalyptic I think you will find something to enjoy here.",1433116800,,5401,4.384231536926148

6367364,5,B00JKE4VBQ,This film takes place a year after the other one. The Purge seems to go after the poor and the rich get there kicks off it and more money. You have freedom fighters who are against it. It mostly follows a guy who lost his son and is out for revenge. Other people who are locked down but find themselves in danger and a couple trying to get home or anywhere safe. All these people meet up and have to survive the Purge. Film is more wide open then part 1 and is very good. Good action and once again it makes you think how far you will go for revenge.

6367367,4,B00JKE4VBQ,"The Purge franchise serves up a premise so audacious that it's an uphill battle just to lend it credence. It's a must that you suspend your sense of disbelief, else you'll spend the movie pooh-poohing it. Dystopian near-futures had already given us nuclear holocausts, zombie apocalypses, and death matches for your viewing pleasure. So why not a near-future in which crime and poverty have gotten so unchecked that the only recourse is an annual government-sanctioned Purge? C'mon, roll with that what if.

The year 2023 projects the aspect of a perfect world. Crime is virtually non-existent. Unemployment is below 5%. So goes the party line, everyone lauding the Founding Fathers who took over the American government nine years ago and who implemented the annual Purge, that twelve-hour span of time in which all crime is permitted, so shoot away, stab away, bludgeon away, go jaywalk. The surface reasoning is that the Purge provides a release valve for those with violent tendencies. The real reason, though, is that the Purge is a population reducer and a culling of certain unwanted sorts in the populace.

Whereas the original film restricts itself to the confines of the home invasion psycho-horror, The Purge: Anarchy expands its setting by taking the action to the streets even as it retains a toehold on its survival horror roots. There's a fun, strong whiff here of Escape from New York and Assault on Precinct 13 and even The Warriors. This time out, we track a group of thrown-in-together strangers as they try to survive the sixth annual Purge night while stranded out in the open. This group is comprised of two stragglers (Zach Gilford, Kiele Sanchez) whose car broke down before they could get inside, a mother (Carmen Ejogo) and her teenaged daughter (Zoe Soul), and a lone purger (the awesome Frank Grillo) who postpones his own homicidal agenda to lend a reluctant hand.

I'm one of the 14 folks who liked the first Purge movie, and I say that knowing that there are flaws to that one and to this one. Yes, both films hang their hat on panicky people making stupid decisions at the worst moments. And, fine, here are a few offenses off the top of my head (and a SPOILER alert now for this list):

- It's just dumb to do your shopping an hour before the commencement of the annual Purge.
- When a sicko has broken into your home, don't give away where you're hiding by blurting out that you have a gun (especially when you don't have a gun).
- That panicky chick who trips in the tunnel and freezes while purgers are shooting at them (I kept yelling, ""Get up, you dumb something that rhymes with kitsch!"").

I liked this sequel even more than the original. I dig the oppressive John Carpenter grindhouse urban nightmare vibe. I like that it packs in the action beats. The understated Frank Grillo most definitely exudes that dangerous Snake Pliskin/Napoleon Wilson aura. Of the rest, Carmen Ejogo as ""Eva"" and Zoe Soul as Eva's plucky kid ""Cali"" are the standouts. It's good that the film does present some characters that you can get behind because it also spends a lot of time not being subtle with its social commentary regarding class warfare and inappropriate governmental excesses (""Unfortunately, the citizens aren't killing enough.""). Thankfully, Grillo makes up for a grip of flaws by constructing an eminently rootable anti-hero. Whether he's fighting off heavily-armed shock troops or manic street goons with fright masks on or a savage butcher named ""Big Daddy,"" Grillo comes off as this implacable dude who you do not want to mess with. I can see The Purge moving forward as a successful action franchise with Grillo as its lead asskicker. Anyway, if you're down with a film that treasures taciturn badasses, gratuitous bloodbathy violence, a character who looks like Mandy Moore run ragged (that'll be Kiele Sanchez), one-percenter douches who purge against the poor, and a peek into an alternate reality where, for a span of twelve hours each year, y'all are granted constitutional rights to go batsh-- crazy, well, The Purge: Anarchy may be up your alley.",1427500800,,4093,4.875

Clean movie no sex or nudity just a lot of blood.",1426464000,,341,4.328125
6367410,4,B00JKE4VBQ,"I was initially skeptical to watch the Purge: Anarchy because it seemed like it very well could be a watered down poor imitation of the original Purge.  Then I remembered something I either wrote or thought about writing in my review of the Purge: that you can take such a storyline and place it in several different settings for a variety of different entertaining outcomes.  So while remembering that I said or wrote this, I paid extra close attention to Anarchy and enjoyed it.  While the characters aren't nearly as memorable as the ones in the first Purge and it's true this is pretty much a more generic version of the first Purge, where the movie succeeds is being more explosive and action-oriented.

This time the setting takes place in the city streets which is probably where it *should* have taken place all along.  Then again taking place in a suburban house makes it more atmospheric and suspenseful especially during the first half since I remember the eerie feeling of silence upon nightfall and not knowing what's going to happen which added to the atmosphere, whereas Anarchy sort of avoids that completely by going right into the purge.  There's no denying from an action point of view that the city streets are an ideal location to get stuck in when the night of the purging arrives.  Of course we once again have to suspend disbelief that such a concept is taking place, much like the one in the Hunger Games.  This is totally fictional obviously because death is never the right way to go about things under any circumstance.  To make it legal to actually kill people is a really good idea for a movie storyline perhaps, but please don't take this stuff seriously.  There's actually people discussing and dissecting the story based on what they see as flaws, but the movie is clearly unrealistic anyway based entirely on the concept.

So basically you have five characters that bring out the story.  One of them, most notably is Frank Grillo's character.  While two characters (a mother and daughter) find themselves dragged from their apartment building and about to be kidnapped and shoved inside a van, the other two (a man and his wife or girlfriend) are in an equally terrible situation- their car broke down alongside the road so they need protection to survive the night as well.  Frank comes along with his nifty, highly trained always-accurate gun shooting skills and his strong desire to get revenge on the man responsible for his son's death.  He often finds himself in the middle of needing to rescue this new group of innocent and defenseless people whenever the situation calls for it (such as whenever a van rides down the road filled with gun-blasting thugs, or people chaotically standing on rooftops preaching/justifying violence, or gunfire blasts out from an apartment room up above directed towards them, etc).  Frank's always around when the danger gets crazy.

Overall the movie's really exciting to watch.  While it's not as good as the first Purge, it succeeds at taking the same concept and placing it in a different, more exciting environment- throughout the city streets which is basically right in the middle of all the danger.  There's a few twists and turns along the way.  Since everyone's basically a target for any particular reason that a friend or enemy sees fit given they have the opportunity to kill and get away with it, I'm surprised there aren't more twists and turns.

The ending could've been better though.  Without spoiling it, let's just say they introduce new characters during a critical situation, and it feels a bit awkward since we have no reason to care about them since it's close to the end of the movie by that point anyway so the feeling of suspense the conclusion was probably going for falls flat a little bit.  The first Purge has a MUCH better (and more graphic and sick!) ending.  Also how disgusting is the scene where all the rich people are actually auctioning off the poor as part of a stage show?  Forcing innocent victims to be part of a hide and seek game where they have to fend for their lives inside a dark area surrounded by people with guns.  Sick stuff!  I BADLY wanted that one older lady to get what was coming to her, but Frank's character lets her off too easy!  Overall Anarchy is highly entertaining, but please watch the original Purge first.",1426377600,,4346,4.758666666666667
6367411,5,B00JKE4VBQ,"""The Purge: Anarchy"" is great! This is how the story goes: A couple are driving home when their car breaks down just as the Purge commences. Meanwhile, a police sergeant goes out into the streets to get revenge on the man who killed his son, and a mother and daughter run from their home after assailants destroy it. The five people meet up as they attempt to survive the night in Los Angeles.

The cast led by Frank Grillo (as Sergeant) is great. The directing & story & screenplay by James DeMonaco is great.

The music by Nathan Whitehead is great. The casting by Jacques Jouffret is great. The film editing by Vince Filippone & Todd E. Miller is great. The casting by Terri Taylor is great. The production design by Brad Ricker is great. The set decoration by Missy Parker, set dressings by Salvador Valle, Chuck Coffman, Victor Mendez, Brad Morrision, Silas Brandon, & Joseph Fedo is great. The costume design by Hala Bahmet is great. The stunts coordinated by Hank Amos & Thayr Harris are great. The visual effects coordinated by Jessica Newhouse-Smith & supervised by Simon Carr & Whitney Gearin is great. The special effects coordinated by Jim Schwalm is great.

This is a great, well-done and well-made sequel that is better than its original. It is also entertaining, as well, too. James DeMonaco has made a well-crafted and better follow-up to ""The Purge"". This was one of the better movies that came out in the summer of 2014 and was also a well-anticipated follow-up, as well, too.",1426377600,,1494,4.716475095785441

6367466,3,B00JKE4VBQ,"Where do I start? The film failed on so many levels. It presupposes that for one night of the year criminals and lawlessness rules. It says: 'Your even free to murder'. In doing so it splits the world into the good and the evil. Basically Americans that want to live and American who want to kill other Americans.

Now you would think perhaps, with just two hours to go, the streets would be empty. But no, a young couple are out shopping. Personally anyone who leaves it that late to do their shopping deserve what they get. On the way home rather than discuss the mayhem which is just about to be unleashed on their city they chat about their relationship. Who would do that? Seriously? No one that's who. Only actors in a daft film where the script writer has no imagination.

The film went on in this vain. People acting, not as real people would act, but only as actors would act playing real people. Its a film written and directed by people who have been brought up on watching too much crap TV. The film doesn't examine the morality of the topic. Nor does it attempt to set out any moral arguments, good or bad. It also fails to make any social comment. It was, in short, a work of fantasy. Lots of people being killed.

This movie skips straight to the action like 20-30 minutes in, when the 1st movie didn't even do anything but talk until 30 minutes where left then action. No offence to you people who are into movies like that, but if its an action/horror movie I'd like something to happen before I fall asleep of boredom ya know. So an hour of talking and stupid stuff does not sit with me for movies like that. So I give this movie 4/5 stars, minus one because well it takes a lot to find a scary movie that isn't predictable for me, so yes predictable stupid people, doing dumb stuff scary movie, but great story line, awesome action and the guys on the front cover wearing them mask, just wicked.

This movie tho really upped the ante for me,this movie is really where the gore is. The film starts with people trying to get inside before the commencement of the annual purge. A mother & daughter who are trying to keep their sick father alive,but he decides to sell himself to the high class citizens so the family can live. However the house gets raided and they come in contact with a vigilante who is out for revenge for the death of his son. He runs into  thr mother & daughter as well as a couple who's brakes got cut so they are also stuck outside as well & come in contact with the lone guy. So now the team of 5 tries to stay alive through a bloodbath that ensues. They seek refuge in a friends house which turns out to be unfriendly company,then they get captured and sold for a bunch of cash. Then the hunt is on,til' the captired people fight for their lives and take out the rich peopld. There is a resistance that comes to the aid of the 5 that got captured. Sure some of the 5 get killed but i won't say who,this is an insane fight for survival. The lead guy finds the way to the house of the man who killed his son the previous year,and goes in for revenge. This movie is like 10x better than the original,the story is deeper and more insane. The weapons are awesome,the traps and tactics for execution are amazing and the gore factor is insane. I absolutely love this movie,it is so fast-paced and unrelenting. The ending is awesome,such an unexpected twist but i love it. The film really made me want to watch part 1 again & i did,it did not even come close. But that is alright this was perfect. If you were let down by the first you will not be disappointed by this,there is so much insanity it is phenomenal. This movie reminds me of that videogame Manhunt at times,as well as a modern day Escape from NY/LA  but way more vicious.

I always appreciate the hints of truth that are shared in movies like this. Outside of the poor mainly being affected by violence, it sheds light on who will gain their power back, as they overcome the oppressive and greedy system they've been exposed to. The ending should be no coincidence. It represents a collective of people who are gaining their power back as you read this, after 400+ years of oppression in a nation under ""God"" (Government Ordinance Department).

In an effort not to give away much here (you can read summaries on the production description page), I will briefly say that the blu ray looks and sounds great just like when we saw the move in the theatre. We were hoping for an ""unrated version"" of this film seeing the obvious topic and content. Only thing we would have recommend the publisher do is release a Purge parts 1 and 2 combo, We intentionally waited on this one to buy and had to end up buying both separately when it would have been very cool to have been able to purchase a limited edition set or something like that.",1424649600,,636,4.264462809917355

6367700,5,B00JKE4VBQ,"I thought the first Purge was a good idea, well acted with a nice plot line and this movie....it kicks the first ones butt !  Once a year for 12 hours the city goes dark and the citizens can go darker.  To stave off the population control and crime one night a year the citizens are free to commit acts of violence unpunished as the people are able to do as they will, but suffer the consequences. A mother and daughter in peril as their husband and father has sold himself to the highest bidder to be killed so his family has money and can be safe, a young couple trying to flee the city are suddenly trapped in the very hell that they tried to escape from and a cop who's child died at the hands of a drunk driver roams the streets to kill the very scum who kill others.

This is a survival of the fittest movie with great action, dialogue, a great plot with twists and turns and an insight on what people will do for pleasure when they are given free reign overnight.  If you thought the first one was decent this one blows it out of the water, while the first one was confined in a house this one is out in the open on the city streets with more threats and more challenges to survive. Numerous villains to count, a real storyline and a new action hero in Frank Grillo that I hope to see more and more of.  See this movie !",1422144000,3,1327,4.088461538461538

6367753,3,B00JKE4VBQ,"Although I wasn't a big fan of the original ""The Purge"" from 2013, I did like the premise.  Well, at least on film.  After years of increasing crime, the new founders of America established one night a year where any crime can be committed including murder.  Thus, purging one's pent up rage all at one time.  It keeps the crime rate down the other 364 days a year don't ya' know.  In the earlier film, however, all of the action takes place inside a house.  So it becomes just another home invasion movie.

In this sequel, again with director/writer James DeMonaco at the helm, we get a look at what's going on out on the streets on the night of the purge.  The central catalyst is a character only known as ""Sergeant"" who is well played by Frank Grillo (""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"").  He is well armed and steps into the night along with his armored-up Ford.  We don't know his purpose as he doesn't seem to fit the profile of the raging purgers.  Suffice it to say, he's using the night to avenge an injustice unrelated to the purge.

Along the way Sergeant picks up 2 couples who are caught outside the safety of shelter.  The first is Eva (Carmen Ejogo, ""Selma""), a struggling waitress and her daughter, Cali (Zoe Soul), a rebellious teen.  The second couple, Shane (Zach Gilford, ""Devil's Due"") and his wife, Liz (Kiele Sanchez,""Perfect Getaway"" and Gilford's real wife).  They are on the verge of a breakup when their car mysteriously dies on a bridge out of town.  Up to this point, things are interesting as Sergeant agrees to lead the quartet to safety with a promise of a new vehicle once they get there.  Alas Sergeant's Ford was disabled in one of the many gunfights.

The quartet, annoyingly, can't seem to follow his instructions.  We just know someone is going to do something stupid and of course, they do.  Many times.  Then after reaching their destination and temporary safety, more silliness ensues with a pointless time-killing sequence.  Things get interesting again as we see how the rich are involved in the politics of the purge.  While this is touched upon in the original, ""Anarchy"" puts it all in a clearer context.  Along the way there are some good shoot-`em-up sequences in which Shane and Liz transform into hardened combat vets as soon as they get their hands on a weapon.  Overall this is an acceptable ""B"" movie, the second in a series, with more to follow, I suspect.

The Blu ray disc looks very good.  The transfer comes in a 1080p video resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  This film is almost completely shot using night sequences.  Fortunately black levels are appropriately dark.  Colors are muted in the night but we do get accurate presentation of shades of green, blue and orange given the natural lighting used.  Frankly, I was a bit surprised at how good the film looked.  The audio comes with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 English language track and it is also excellent.  Street activity during the purge is evident in various speakers throughout the film.  There is plenty of gun fighting, explosions, screams, crashes and other mayhem to keep the surrounds and subwoofer busy.  Impressive.  Subtitles are available in English SDH, French and Spanish.  There are only a couple extras.  One is called ""Behind the Anarchy"" which is a standard behind the scenes short and the other is a collection of deleted scenes.",1421625600,,3372,4.710616438356165

The original played out in a family home and we didn't delve much deeper into what the purge is really all about, Anarchy is set out on the streets and opens up the playing fields big time for more action and violence and story! This time we follow a bunch of survivors who are unwillingly caught up in the purge outside in the streets as they try and survive the night from the chaos and murderous gangs and various other twists, it certainly is bigger and bolder than the original, great cast, great soundtrack, good effects and the overall style of the movie works really well and keeps you gripped through the running time!

It seems like the movie was limited by its budget. Some things in the movie were introduced and not really followed through with, like they kind of ran out of money. The concept of these 2 movies is so awesome to me, but these 2 movies both underwhelmed me. The sequel kind of reminded me of the Warriors, a 1979 movie about gangs and anarchy, which is a good thing.

So basically my review is 3.5 stars. The acting was good, and there was some good action. The movie just seems to be lacking, which is a shame, because like I said, the concept is great.",1419292800,2,693,4.1716417910447765
6367968,5,B00JKE4VBQ,"MUCH better than the first film.  In fact, it kind of makes that film forgettable.  You do not have to see the first film to enjoy this action-packed thriller.

The story is interesting and heart-wrenching while maintaining that perverse atmosphere where death and sadism lurk around every corner.  Frank Grillo's performance is natural and excellent.  The other actors are great as well, but Frank makes you feel like you're following a Punisher/Frank Castle in one scene and a 2014 John McClane in another.  The reluctant good guy with bad things to do and good people to save.

The tension is high.  The action is bloody.  You never know who to trust.  There are a view scary twists.  And the ending is a twisted, uplifting experience that succeeds.  Nothing corny here.  Just a great thriller worth re-watching.",1419292800,14,815,4.904411764705882

I was wondering while watching it would murder be the only crime people would do in such a situation? We have seen places where something similar happens, and it tends to end out with looting much more than murder. Would it be the rich that would be into it to the poor as suggested here or mainly the reverse?

The story itself was well told. It was interesting.

6368154,5,B00JKE4VBQ,"Entertaining and very well made. Furthermore, the movie has fresh story line...if someone told me this movie was directed by a Korean or Japanese film director without first seeing the name of the real director, I would have believed them...no wonder this is an independent production with limited budget, Hollywood stopped making such good movie long time ago.  The movie was made with $9 millions but in the box office it earned $110 millions...it just goes to show you that film budgets don't mean anything...

I have not seen the original Purge from 2013 with Ethan Hawke, but after seeing the second installment I will defiantly check out part one.  It is refreshing to see that American film-making has not perished completely yet.

The idea of one day in a year when crime (murder) is permitted by the government...is not only scary but it sounds like something that will/might happen in the future...""the year is 2023, America is governed by the New Founding Fathers, and the zero hour of the annual purge night approaches""...

Imagine watching: Mad Max franchise combined with 1984 by Orwell and The Warriors (1979)...that is what basically The Purge: Anarchy is like...

6368283,1,B00JKE4VBQ,"This is one of the worst sequels I have ever wasted time watching. It is almost comical with all the political and social myths that this movie continually mixes in with the bad acting and worse plot. In real life people say the rich are taking advantage of the poor but in this the rich seem to be the driving force for killing the poor. The government has morphed into this religious cult and people get into little prayer circles before they execute others. The government in this movie even openly refer to themselves as a regime, something North Korea won't even call themselves. I could go on and on about the stupidity in the movie. At  least in the first one people would  stay awake through the night. In this one people  that aren't safe just go about their life making dinner in the middle of the purge like its just normal and the rich in their protected houses will just sleep the night away.

I liked the original. Sure it takes a massive repression of common sense to buy into the plot but it was still a good movie. This one just sucked though. Seeing the high reviews this movie got apparently my opinion goes against the popular  view. All I can say is that if you spend $ on it and think it sucked don't say I didn't try to tell you. Maybe it is just me but its sort of sad that movies with waves of zombies seems more plausible than the plot of this.

Im really not even sure where they got the word anarchy in the title when all the mayhem seemed to be supported by the government. Maybe it was how the poor started to fight back.......by killing the rich......which I guess is also legal and supported by the government. I guess that's the version of anarchy I'm not aware of.",1417219200,3,1698,4.323899371069182
6368284,2,B00JKE4VBQ,"I wrote an earlier review of the first film, The Purge, which was apparently deleted, so this one will probably suffer the same fate at the hands of some Politically Correct fanatic. Oh well, no harm in trying.

This one has no change in the basic premise: once a year, criminal activity is legally unpunishable. Supposedly, this has resulted in a sharp drop in crime. The repeated emphasis of the movie is that---for some unexplained reason---it is poor people who are usually the target of purge activity, especially (of course) blacks. So in this sequel, the anti-rich message is in your face, more so than in the first and we have scenes where rich people (white of course) hire goons to capture victims so that the rich (white of course) can kill them. Liberally (no pun intended) inter spaced are numerous sarcastic remarks about America. Meantime, a black anti-establishment Che wannabe leads a band of blacks killing rich whites. But aside from the obvious leftist politics (not so subliminal as last time) is that the basic premise is stupid; it is particularly the psychopaths who would indulge in the murders during a purge, not normal people (as the scriptwriter would have us believe), so criminal activity would not diminish year around. Anytime that you have a period of anarchy, that is when the psychopaths flourish.

Specifically, the plot follows a vigilante, a bickering couple and a mother and her motormouth daughter; the only one that doesn't come across as congenitally stupid is the vigilante.",1417219200,7,1518,4.97244094488189

6368286,4,B00JKE4VBQ,"A dystopian government, The New Founding Fathers, authorizes all crime for 24 hours. Great premise that was completely wasted in the first movie. This time around, the premise is put to better use.

Separate individuals, each looking to ride out the night in their own way, find themselves brought together, fighting to survive. There are some great twists and turns. The movie and its violence are highly stylized and atmospheric. I went in with low expectations and left pleasantly surprised. The acting was decent, and the expected genre cliches were present but kept to a minimum. With the annual purge as a backdrop, I can easily foresee yearly entries in this franchise. If they are done as well as this one was, it may just have a future.",1417219200,,745,4.8203125

We couldn't pause it or else it wouldn't play again, we had to stop it and fast forward, praying it would play again. The movie supposed to be just under 2 hrs and it took us 3.5 hrs to finish it.

In this Purge we take it outside instead of the claustrophobia of the first one. 1 couple, a mother and daughter get trapped outside and run across someone who wants to get to someone and kill him for a personal transgression. On Purge night he can kill him and not be prosecuted. There is more but that can be a surprise.

6368474,5,B00JKE4VBQ,"This is not a silly, little horror film. This is a legitimately smart action/adventure thriller. Its closest spiritual kin might be something like ""Escape From New York,"" another superb cult classic about a rogue antihero battling to survive in a lawless, near-future society.

So beyond some tense cat-and-mouse chases and firefights, the film poses a fascinating and disturbing view of a world where full-blown anarchy is legalized for one night a year. There are a bevy of interesting repercussions this holiday has on a society where full-blown class warfare is not only sanctioned but encouraged. From the government and police, to the wealthy and the poor, young and old, the film shares some brilliant glimpses into how everyone reacts to living in this familiar but alternate world. This movie is simply a fantastic satire for the end of Western civilization and both liberal/conservative philosophies, further perfecting its own archetype franchise of when regular people indulge their basest fantasties. As something unique and different from the overused cliches of zombies/post-apocalypse/slasher/action films to which it is somewhat similar, all hardcore cinephiles can appreciate this movie's stunning originality. As the plot concerns a small circle of protagonists all vying to survive the affair, the plot is refreshingly surprising and unpredictable when compared to the usual studio-produced films.

With even some splashes of dark comedy and a relatively beautiful and redemptive ending, this film offers so much more than expected from a sequel to a home-invasion slasher film. I read a review that basically summarized this film as ""the Punisher vs Idiocracy."" If you understand what that means, then you'll love this movie too.",1416355200,,1750,5.477777777777778

6368678,4,B00JKE4VBQ,"The Purge: Anarchy is, at the risk of being accused of hyperbole, the most enthusiastically anti-American film I have seen within recent memory.  Keep in mind that I can remember Lars Von Trier films and Noam Chomsky interviews.  Cynics will accuse the new Purge as being unintentionally funny.  The truth is, the film is very intentional with its angry, caustic, satirical humor.  This is not a horror film, or a thriller, though some sequences in this 100+ minute chase film are admittedly thrilling.  This is a livid comedy; one can imagine this film being written by John Oliver and directed by an early 80s John Carpenter.  In case the first Purge films ultra blatant messages about gun culture and economic inequality were lost on, the sequel takes it all the way to 11.  Audiences who couldn't see through the super-obvious left-wing messages of recent sci-fi dystopias like Andrew Niccols underrated In Time or Blomkamps Elysium will enjoy the way that the new Purge eschews metaphor for a hyper-obvious allegory that repeatedly and cheerfully hits you over the head with its blatant message.  Not since Bret Easton Ellis used a serial murderer as a metaphor for the heartlessness of 80s Reaganite capitalism in American Psycho has there been such an in-your-face, rage-filled rant against the upper class.

The universe of the film is one where America in the near future has elected some sort of oligarchy known as the New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA).  Through a process not thoroughly laid out in either Purge film, though explored in an official site linked to the film, a constitutional amendment is passed allowed that, for 12 hours on one night of the year, all crime is deemed legal, especially murder.  The stated reason for this is to allow citizens to experience a catharsis, release the beast, thus allowing crime to be confined to this one night and allowing relative peace and prosperity for the rest of the year. Indeed, title cards tell us that unemployment and crime are taken to record lows, and the economy is booming after a fiscal crisis.  Perhaps the unstated reason for this is to eliminate the poor, thus allowing for lesser strain on government programs allocated to help and, also, prosecute them?  How much money would the government save if you could drastically cut any and all programs that exist as a social safety net for the poor, sick, and needy?  How much would you save if you didn't have to funnel money to law enforcement to arrest, try, and jail poor people who commit crimes associated with the poor (drugs and crimes committed to pay for drugs, gang violence, etc?)

Whereas the first Purge film dealt with upper-middle to lower-rich classes, living a nice neighborhood where no one seems to go out and purge (as a verb) themselves (a commentary about how, when the poor riot, they never target rich communities?), the sequel takes us to the middle of the city, where the poor desperately barricade themselves with what little means they can muster, street hustlers offer last minutes sales on guns and protection, and some take the extreme route of selling themselves to be killed by the rich so that their surviving relatives have a chance to get out of squalor (a mixture of Hostel and a metaphor for how we all sell out by taking jobs that help make those higher on the economic latter a bit richer even though the harder work is done by the wage-laborer).

The new film gives us five protagonists: Eva (Carmen Ejogo) is a waitress struggling to make ends meet. Cali (Zoe Soul, who cannot act) is her daughter who won't shut up and whose job in the film is to ask questions which allow for exposition.  Then we meet a couple of the verge of breaking up (Zach Gilford and Kylie Sanchez) who are driving home just before the Purge is about to commence (didnt feel the need to leave earlier, guys?) when their car breaks down due to sabotage but masked gang members.  Then we meet Leo (Frank Grillo), a man who has chosen to go out on Purge Night armed to the teeth in a souped up Mad Max-Death Race car to get revenge.  Circumstances draw them together and the film mainly functions as a chase film of them running through dark streets and buildings (ala Escape from New York) as the city becomes a war zone.

Oh, and lest I forget, there is also a character named Carmelo (Michael K. Williams) who posts internet videos where he explicitly states the things the film is saying: that people need to wake up, realize that the rich are exploiting and killing the poor to line their own pockets, and people need to rise up against them.  This character is dressed up like a Black Panther or Che Guevara and sounds like a cross between Vladimir Lenin and me when Im drunk and watching Fox news.  This character, and his army of all-Black revolutionaries, brings to mind the jokes Bill Maher often makes about Conservatives being afraid of Obamas Army.

The films two main messages are about economic inequality and gun culture.  On the former, its saying that the way our modern real-life America society runs, the rich are killing the poor in all but the most literal sense of the word.  The film shows us the literal iteration of what the rich are financially and socially doing to the poor (and also what the poor does to the poor with the tacit endorsement of the rich).  This message is right on the surface of the film and stated explicitly and repeatedly.  It hammers you over the head as much as victims in this film are literally hammered over the head.  Your tolerance for this will depend on how angry you are about economic inequality in the United States.  Since I am a Socialist and very concerned, I watched the film with a gigantic smile on my face the whole way through.

The second concern is about gun culture, and this message is perhaps a bit mixed.  While the film is very much against redneck gun lovers (numerous gun-toting characters yell about how owning a gun and/or shooting a gun is their God and/or government given right in increasingly hilarious ways) and gun fetishism (one character describes a gun in particularly phallic detail late into the film), and it clearly shows that guns are not adequate protection for a home invasion, and taking the law into your own hands is wrongthe film seemingly has no problem with guns for self-defense as a practical measure (everyone on the street is a potential enemy, so you should be armed to fight backisnt that the argument of concealed carry, even though it IS the phenomenon of concealed and open carry that causes people to feel like anyone could be a potential enemy.  Perhaps this is a comment on how, like people wouldnt need guns to protect themselves if guns were not first a threat, people wouldnt need guns to protect themselves during the Purge if the Purge itself didn't exist).  The film also seems okay with violent rebellion against the rich.  While Carmelo the resistance leader is shown to yell and look kind of crazy in the film, the things he says throughout the film are NOT crazy at all, making me view him as the mouthpiece of the writer/director.  The Purge: Anarchy is not a film politely arguing for a democratic solution to economic inequality.  After all, the New Founding Fathers of America were voted in democratically.  The film is arguing that the rich be overthrown through revolutionary means.  Not since Fight Club have I seen an American film so unapologetically Marxist in its ideology.

Of all the people we see murdered in the film (mostly via gun), the film presents all of the murders as either shocking, horrible, or neutrally as background to set up the world.  That is, except, when it comes to the rich.  In once scene, which also helpfully explains that no one tries to break into banks during the Purge because they move their money, we are treated to the site of a stock broker murdered and hung up over the door of a large bank, holding a sign which is both read aloud to us and shown on screen long enough for us to read ourselves, explaining that he was killed for stealing pensions.  One of our protagonists says maybe he deserved it as the camera lingers on the victim before we cut to the next scene.  Later on, we see other rich people, all dressed up in the attire Mitt Romney and his sons were nearly every time they give an interview these days, being shot to pieces in sequences clearly meant for us to cheer that, finally, someone we WANT to die, is.

Some may ask why the messages are so blatant and in your face.  Some will want subtlety, nuance, a more creative metaphor.  I have no such qualms.  Political movies may be all over the place these days, from Michael Moore docs on the left, Dinesh DSouza propaganda on the right, and stuff like Dirty Wars in the middle, but films like those exist an echo chamber where only those who already agree with those films views are sitting in the audience for them, and those who aren't in the choir they're preaching to are people already firmly against them who are there for an irony orgy.  By putting your message on the surface (for those who are too lazy or stupid to read between the lines) in a genre that is popular across many different demographics (like horror) you reach an audience who otherwise wouldnt care to listen to your Marxist rant.  While a film like the Purge: Anarchy probably won't sway anyones opinions on its own, it may slither upon unsuspecting audiences and at least spark discussions, whereas documentaries would immediately cause people to have their guard up.

Aside from the message of the film, many viewers of the first Purge had issues with the mythology of this world.  If ALL crime is legal (except for some heavy explosives and the murder of high government officials) why is everyone so concerned with murder?  While this sequel explains that breaking into banks, and presumably expensive stores, would be futile, couldn't hackers steal money over the internet?  The sequel, in discussing CCTV traffic cams, indicates that perhaps the internet is too heavily state controlled for this to happen, but it seems like someone would try.  Then there are the questions which lead to ideas for fan fiction: What if you merely assaulted someone you knew but didn't kill them, then after the Purge ends they have to be all hunky-dory with you for another 364 days?  Im sure you guys and girls can think of a billion different stories for this universe, which is one quality of it that endears this series to me, and makes me hope for either more sequels or prequels or side-quels, or perhaps a licensed series of novel spin-offs exploring all of the different ways people would exploit 12 hours of carte blanche.

Of course, there are also holes in logic.  For instance, why does no one just leave the country for the Purge?  I assume they don't because the films makes a point about how the Purge is very Patriotic (people put out a special flower in front of their house to show support for it) and, much like the people who didn't fly the American flag or express extreme love of country after 9/11, someone who left the country for the Purge would be forever a pariah in their community and labeled un-American or a traitor.  So putting aside questions that could be feasibly explained with the logic the film provides us and a dollop of our own knowledge of Americawhat happens to people stick in the Hospital during the Purge? Mental hospitals? Prisons? What is someone is killed one minute after the Purge ends?  You cant pinpoint time of death accurately to within a minute.  What if you fire a gun a second before the Purge ends, but it doesnt hit the person until the claxon signally the end of the Purge?  Does the beginning of the act or the completion of the act count as when the act is said to have occurred?  How much these holes or unexplained aspects of the film bother you will vary.  Me?  I didn't mind much.  The film takes place in a heightened satirical universe and seems to play fair based on the rules the film (now films) give us.

Ultimately, I thoroughly enjoyed the film.  Despite the absence of the invaluable Ethan Hawke this time around, this sequel is actually a better film than the original, thanks to eliminating superfluous subplots, focusing more on the poor, trading the trapped-in-one-location horror set-up for a chase set-up (or, in John Carpenter-ese, trading Assault on Precinct 13 for Escape from New York or Escape from LA), and expanding on the world created in the first one.  Were still in b-movie territory here, but for this one, it earns the highest of Bs. B+",1415491200,,12580,4.669234254644314

6368927,3,B00JKE4VBQ,"The good news is that Purge 2 is way better than Purge 1.

Still, the same could be said of Home Alone 2, Friday the 13th 2, Nightmare on Elm Street 2 and pretty much any other sequel you can think of except for Cannonball Run 2, which frankly gave Jack ""Evil Eye"" Elam way more than the 15 minutes of fame he didn't even deserve.

But the first two-thirds of ""Anarchy"" is actually quite engaging, sort of like a supercharged ""Escape From New York,"" with a little bit of ""Road Warrior"" and ""Battle Royale"" mixed in, but in the last half hour, you can go ahead and add ""The Hunger Games"" to that list of comparisons. Because, just as happens in any episode of ""The Walking Dead"" in which the Governor is in the storyline, ""Anarchy"" devolves into a cheap, adolescent morality play.

And that's the bad news: As happens so often in horror and romance films that the beaten dead horse ought to have learned by now how to get back up and wander away, ""Anarchy"" flaunts the over-fried hippie fantasy that a rag-tag band of ho-hum folks can overcome the terror of money and [WORD THAT RHYMES WITH GRASS HOLES] through brute force. There are so many points at which the filmmakers could have stepped up -- a la the shovel-to-the-head 1999 Spanish film ""The Nameless"" -- and hoisted a big middle finger in the air to Hollywood's accepted lie that ""the good guys"" always win [and yes, I'm including such problematic characters of today as Matthew McConaughey's Rustin Cole from ""True Detective,"" who would have a hard time getting a speaking gig at any university in America]. Maybe Purge 2 is just an Occupy Wall Street wet dream.

Gah! I hear the next film takes place when all the protagonists are still in their diapers. Can't wait for the animated Nickelodeon series soon after!",1414713600,2,1773,4.566037735849057

So pushing political views aside, the acting was slightly better in this second film. I think the storyline was well put together and opens the door for sequel. Because I am a huge action fan this film gets 4 stars.",1414454400,,608,4.486486486486487

It's about all crime being legal for 12 hours and follows the story's of three family's and how they come together to survive the night. It mainly deals with murder, you don't see anyone stealing or raping. It is interesting idea. Completely unrealistic idea of course. The country would be shut down weeks before the purge and would take months of clean up afterwords. Mainly it is fire that make this not only impossible but unrealistic. It is amazing how much damage you could do with 10 gallons of gas and no firefighters showing up. Most of the city would be burnt to the ground in 12 hours. And, would you for instance trust or like the cops when they do deiced to show up? Everyone year round would have a kill the cops mentality. The purge would last like two years until the country would tear itself apart and form separate nations. But it was an interesting idea and they ran with it.",1414368000,4,969,4.418994413407821

Part 2, however, is different...and disappointing. The same thing kept occurring over and over in this movie: the characters would be saved last second by a hero, then a new bad guy would come wanting to purge, then the characters would be saved all over again by another hero at just the last second.  Over and over again like no movie I've ever seen before. The group of rebels fighting against The Purge were ridiculous, the Hostel bits were too predictable, the teenage girl was annoying, and the Grandpa bit was just laughable. Some of these characters made too many goofy mistakes to feel bad for them. I also thought the ending was totally unrealistic and would never happen in a million years, but that's just me.

Frank Grillo is my new hero and Carmen Ejogo was perfect in a role that was very different from anything she has done to date.

They take it to the streets this time not in the cushy gated community's of the suburbs. It focuses on 5 main characters who by fate meet up and band together to try and survive until dawn when the purge is over.

This film has so much action and heart. You will root for the underdogs and stay on the edge of your seats. There is a couple of surprises that are pretty cool as well. There is more violence in this than the first but nothing that takes it to slasher status.

On the plus side there are a collection of much more sympathetic characters this time around since it focuses on people who are the intended victims of the purge instead of a wealthy family.  Unfortunately writer/director James DeMonaco still struggles to stage a halfway decent action sequence and has little mastery of pacing, so The Purge: Anarchy ends up being a politically barbed but persistently unexciting exploitation film.  Still, the auction/hunting sequence near the end of this film is a big improvement over the home invasion sequence from the first and there are much worse ways to spend an hour and a half.",1411603200,2,742,5.016260162601626

However, I ventured out with my girlfriend a few weeks ago to see The Purge: Anarchy. Although it was somewhat exciting, I really didn't come away with a sense of fulfillment. I say this because the direction of the film was unbalanced with what I intended to see. I thought it was going to be a sloppy horror film that left me terrified and ready to crawl into a corner and cry but instead I was left with a sour taste in my mouth. So ultimately the direction didn't stick well with me. Nonetheless, the film wasn't a total buzz kill because I enjoyed some important aspects that are worth mentioning.

To begin, its worth highlighting how the films use of costumes adds a dimension of horror. In particular, I want to point out the scene where Shane and Liz (struggling couple) exit the super market and are then confronted by bandits. The bandits come across as eerie and intimidating. I say this because they wear petrifying masks over their faces, dangle torturous tools in their hands, and are represented as people who would stop at nothing in order to get what they want. If that doesnt give you goose bumps, I don't know what will. So I got the feeling at the beginning of the movie, with the compilation of utter chaos from everyone getting ready for the annual purge along with the tremendously wicked costumes, that my girlfriend would be taking refuge on my shoulder. But unfortunately the direction of the movie turned into action and adventure.

This is where the actors come into discussion. As I stated before, I believe that the film was intended to convey horror but the actors necessarily didn't enforce the message. In particular, Jack Conley (Big Daddy) is represented as the most menacing villain. However, I didn't enjoy his voice. His tone and pitch was very monotonous. He also didn't appear creepy or terrifying unlike the masked bandits that I described earlier. I think this has something to do with how Im not familiar with his work. So ultimately the filmed lacked big named stars that wouldve constructed a better narrative of horror.

Moving on, the plot is essentially what obscured my acceptance into the film. Usually when I see a scary movie I get the sensation that whats happening on the screen could possibly be applicable to real life. Quite frankly this was not the case. The plot is based off of an event that is totally immoral in that a society can abolish crime on every day of the year with exception to one day (the purge). In todays world, this would never occur.

To summarize my intake on this film, I would have to conclude that if you want to see an actioned packed adventure filled with violence and gore than this is the film for you. But if you are like me and enjoy critiquing the way the movie is constructed than you may be a little skeptical. I mean I would watch this film again but the genre is a little difficult to tackle.",1411430400,5,3062,4.531645569620253

However, it pretty much delivers right on what it promises, which is a fairly well done alternate view into a more blood thirsty America. The movie doesn't really give any surprises and if you've seen the trailer you know what you're getting into.

As the movie progressed and showed its hand--and I'm really thinking about how even cultured, rich people embrace this night of horror--I thought of the Roman Colosseum. I've never seen evidence that humans are any ""better"" now than thousands of years ago; our culture is certainly more moral, on the whole, but we've not evolved physiologically, and I think the idea that some would go for a nightly purge is plausible. Humans to this day still show they are capable of grotesqueness.

Of course, the movie does require the suspension of disbelief. The idea itself isn't tenable for a multitude of reasons (e.g. a guy who likes arson could just go lighting a bunch of fires and causing insane amounts of damage beyond the loss of human life).

...they fell asleep, they sought cheap lodgings, they annoyed a guy who thought Rube Goldberg had neat ideas for how to kill people--bad guys  who later died for medical reasons or the sin of wearing leather.

Of late, we see folks killed for being born in the wrong zip code.

In Purge Two we watch an effort that began with the rich merely killing  other rich people  as retribution for high contractors' bills to this latest expression of the reprehensible--the 1%  out to gun down  any of the 99% in sight.

The latest is Purge Anarchy.  Another title might better be: Purge: One Per Centers to the Wall.

Before these films, the Hostel franchise revealed what is going on better than any other Hollywood softcore-snuff series:  the rich have way too much disposable income.  Our vaunted trickle down economy floats on the blood slowly squeezed and  crushed from the poor.

This greases the rails that launch the latest bloated yacht or finances another Mc Mansions Towers  with rich guys' entrances for Trump or his ilk.

Conspicuous Consumption has been overtaken by something worse: rich folk who view killing the rest of us as thinning the herd.

Purge is not about anarchy: it is a call for payback.  Well dressed people in their carefully  tarped dining rooms stand around a man they will bludgeon to death and elsewhere yawning plutocrats bid for the last hunt of the evening on three brace just flushed and captured prey.

These rich folk reveal indecency based on complete lack of feeling beyond their whims and a sense of entitlement that knows no bounds.

Surely some decent person will step from his  fortress to aid another and end this waste and destruction and insanity.

The movie ends showing one such guy, a man who once acted horribly but who has grown to do something that might be deemed ""good""- he stops a cycle of wrong and aids a good man.

Purge Two ends on a note that suggests we might turn from this movie's fantasy dystopia --one we actually seem to near more everyday.

An America where inequality and hunger of millions seems a juggernaut we all unthinkingly pull  rather than  stop

An America where talking heads stir discord and justify the philosophy of ""I got mine.  If you don't, you're a tax leech who should shove off, swim out of sight and drown, quietly.""

And an America where a woman who wrote bad fiction became the north star for political dolts and billionaires with way too much political heft, where rationalization not ""exceptionalism"" seems our dominant national trait.

A good movie to hash out over coffees with friends: the civilized who like to discuss, the edgy who like playing the devil's advocate, the enraged who like a good rant--all have lots to play with.

Let's all have another national dialogue.",1408147200,8,2984,4.732038834951457

6369272,5,B00JKE4VBQ,"Last years The Purge was a standard Hollywood thriller with a stellar premise. A good ten years into the future, unemployment is way down and violent crime is practically non-existent thanks to a yearly event called The Purge. For twelve hours every year (7PM-7AM, sometime in March), all crime including murder is legal. Emergency services are turned off. This tends to weed out the poor, the homeless, or non-contributing members of society.

The first film focused on an affluent family whose home was broken into by others jealous of their wealth. It made for a serviceable home invasion thriller, but was truly a missed opportunity given the rich concept. The Purge: Anarchy feels like what the first film should have been. Its not much different than Crash, where unrelated characters and stories come together and create a common bond among vastly different people.

An unnamed hero (Frank Grillo) saves two sets of people, a working class mother and daughter, and a couple on the verge of separation, both of whom were unluckily thrown out on the streets in the midst of the annual purge. The unlikely gang has to work together to save each other from certain death.

The concept is so interesting because of its plausibility. America is a country obsessed with violence, and everyone in this getting more and more angry with society. We blindly follow rules and regulations that the government swears are in our own best interest. Anarchy features a radical group of Youtube-bloggers whose mission is to expose the world to the truth that it is apparently too lazy to see.

In this world, the very rich (the 1%, if you will) hold auctions on purge night, where people bid on strangers on a stage, the highest bidder getting to kill whoever they bid on. How reprehensible is that? The scariest thing is that, if something like the purge ever came into reality, this is exactly how things would go. But I think, as American citizens, were really far away from anything like that being a reality. Right?

The film is suspenseful and fast enough to forgive its stock characters and mid-grade dialogue. Details of the plot are paid heavier attention than dialogue, which I can live with. This one kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. While the home-invasion version of this story was fine, this is the story that should have been told the first go around. Theres civil unrest and abhorrent violence at every turn, but theres also justice for the bad guys, and mercy for those who don't deserve to die that way. If you haven't seen the first Purge, you can still see this one without missing anything. In fact, if you haven't seen the first film, I would recommend watching this one first. Its much better and far more satisfying.

6369273,3,B00JKE4VBQ,"The first ""Purge"" film was a glorified home break-in movie. This feature takes us to the streets and the meat of the purge. The film runs with a plot and 2 subplots that come together. The plot centers on a struggling African American lower middle class family who just want to be left alone. There is a couple whose car has broken down in the city and a cop who is out seeking vengeance.

We get to see the psychotics in the street and how the rich pay to ceremonially kill poor people. The political aspects of the film, i.e. ""class warfare"" that was touched on in the first film becomes a powerful theme in this one. (Hint: The word Anarchy is in the title.)

The characters were rather dull in a film that begs for quirky individuals. Does Magnolia have to make this film to get it right?

What happens when a couple chooses to be out just before a period of unspeakable terror is about to begin? What happens when for 12 hours, crime is legal?  What happens in fact, is The Purge Anarchy.

With the original 2013 film, it was the way The Purge attempted to be clever and how the movie did more than just try to scare you that made it a likable movie in my opinion. In this movie, you have even more likable aspects.  I like that there is  more of a diversity to the cast this time around. I like how the story has more to offer in terms of suspense and thrills. This time around there is a lot more at stake. I like how the danger that is present in The Purge Anarchy grabs your attention more. If I were to be stuck outside during The Purge(and believe me I would NOT be) the things that play out in The Purge Anarchy are instances that you could see happening. The term ""trust only a few"" definitely comes into play in this movie.

Speaking on the cast, expect to see only new faces(with one brief exception). Zach Gilford has a nice outing as the character Shane, Carmen Ejogo stars as Eva in the movie. Kiele Sanchez stars as Liz, Michael Williams stars as Carmelo Jones(and you will remember his character trust me). But it is Frank Grillo starring as Leo, the main character, the tough, no-nonsense this is gonna go my way type guy . I liked his performance a lot in the movie. If ever Marvel should ever decide to reboot The Punisher, he definitely comes to mind play the part . I think he would also make a great Nathan Drake in the Uncharted movie. It would appear that director James DeMonaco aimed to make a more high-end, ""hit the ground running"" sequel and  he has done just that with The Purge Anarchy.

And all this being said, while The Purge Anarchy is not the greatest sequel, it very well is better than its previous installment. Where we go after this movie remains to be seen, but I suspect a third sequel to be more than likely. My  interest to see this new franchise progress will increase, being that the ideas remain fresh. The Purge Anarchy gets:

6369286,1,B00JKE4VBQ,"Entertainment-wise, the movie was fine.  I wasn't expecting Oscar-worthy material, and my expectations were met.

However, James DeMonaco, for whatever reason, decided that the audience needed his incessant sermonizing on class, race, and a myriad of sociopolitical issues.  In case the original Purge was too subtle in its anti-capitalist, anti-American undertones, DeMonaco comes out bashing viewers with his metaphorical sledge hammer....just in case we missed the tired, hackneyed limousine-liberal critique on American culture which he crams down our throats seemingly every single second.  DeMonaco's message is simple, and doesn't let the annoying complexities of actual reality interfere, i.e. that rich people, guns, capitalism, patriotism, Christianity, and America are not only evil, but inseparable and co-dependent.  No doubt, middle-upper class Occupy deadbeat conflict-studies majors everywhere quivered and frothed in their theater seats at the ""social injustice"" of it all, the entire time willfully blind to the irony to the fact that this movie was produced by everything they claim to hate.

6369287,4,B00JKE4VBQ,"I liked this movie. The original Purge set the setting quite nicely, so they didn't really needed to go over how things work for the second movie. We all know what's going to happen for the next 12 hrs: all crime will be legal!!! Anything and everything is up for grabs and it's time to unleash the BEAST!!! I wish this was real! One day of total freedom, it's kill or be killed time, so here we go!

In this movie, instead of following a family at their house protecting a stranger off the streets. We find out there are multiple stories telling. We are following an unhappy, married couple that wants to end their relationship, and they are being hunted down by a group of people wearing death purge masks. We are also following a mother and daughter that are staying at home and just wanting to get through the purge night. Finally, we are following a stranger, who is a loner and the anti-hero type. He has his eyes set on killing someone tonight; someone, we do not know yet. Eventually, all of these people somehow find a way to meet other in middle. They will need the help of each other and depend on each other to get through this purge night.

There are many twists in this movie. Some you will figured out and some will be a total surprised to you. I love the writing for this movie and the acting is really good as well. The only thing is the directing isn't that good. Not enough cruel death scenes as like the first. It's mostly death by gunfire for this one.

I like to add that this movie really tried to develop more of a political back story for the purge. There is supposed to be a secret reason why, they have the purge every year. It is not just to release the beast or the right to cleanse yourself. Nope. You will find a much more darker reason why they have the purge ever year. By the writers adding in the policital background to this movie, I think they have made a easy way to continue The Purge movies.

I highly recommend this movie. You may not like it as much as I did. But, if you saw the first one, you must see the second one!",1405987200,2,2061,4.223350253807107
6369288,4,B00JKE4VBQ,"As writer/director James DeMonaco's 2013 ""what-if"" futuristic psychological thriller THE PURGE, made on a budget of only $3 million, was such a huge success. It only stood to reason that there would be a follow-up.  The basic idea of an entire twelve-hour time frame, from 7 PM March 21st to 7 AM March 22nd, being devoted to everybody releasing their most violent tendencies in a ""purge"", especially against the poor and the indigent, seemed to hit the spot of a time in the year when mega-budget films are usually the big thing, seeing as how it only cost $3 million to make.  And here we have THE PURGE: ANARCHY.

Now it is the year 2023, and another Purge Night is about to descend on America, though DeMonaco keeps his story focused around Los Angeles.  It is getting late in the day on March 21st, and everybody with any sense is preparing to get back to their homes before the Purgers come out for releasing their innermost monsters.  But not everyone is ready to heed the advice of the authorities; one man in particular (Frank Grillo) is out to get revenge on the drunk driver who had killed his son in the last Purge twelve months before and had gotten off on a technicality.  Then there are four people of different backgrounds who find themselves thrown together.  One pair (Zach Gilford; Kiele Sanchez) find themselves stranded on the 6th Street Bridge over the L.A. River after their SUV's cable has been severed by a Purger.  The other pair are a mother (Carmen Ejogo) and daughter (Zoe Soul) whose house has been destroyed by another group of Purgers.  When they meet up with an extremely reluctant Gilford (who doesn't reveal his motivation for willfully being out there), they are forced to endure an endless night of horrific violence at the hands of various organized Purge crews, and even an anti-Purge group led by an almost Jim Jones-like leader (Michael K. Williams).  Ejogo, Gilford, Soul, and Sanchez are basically in Gilford's reluctant hands and just trying to survive, resorting to defensive violence only when forced to, especially at the hands of rich, upscale Beverly Hills purgers who use them for target practice in a ritual seemingly inspired by both the 1933 classic THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME, and the 2012 film THE HUNGER GAMES; and then it comes down to t.  It all comes down to the final climax outside the house of the man that Grillo was after in the first place.

Whereas the original film took inspiration from a lot of different sources, including ""siege"" films such as ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, THE BIRDS, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, and STRAW DOGS, by extending it out into the streets and involving Purgers of all kinds, from ethnic gang-bangers to those with the original film's ""ghoul"" masks (a premise borrowed from A CLOCKWORK ORANGE), DeMonaco takes inspiration for THE PURGE: ANARCHY from such films as COLORS, DARK BLUE, and THE WARRIROS.  There's also the return to the premise of the original, of a fascist New Founding Fathers of America having what passes for ""control"" over everything to do with the Purge, which people like George Orwell, Aldoux Huxley, Franz Kafka, and Rod Serling would have found comfortingly familiar.  The camera work is also quite fluid, given that the budget DeMonaco was working with here was still not of a typical Hollywood action film ($9 million).  And the HUNGER GAMES-inspired Beverly Hills twist is a good diversion.  I only wish that DeMonaco didn't feel the need to make it more palpable to a conventional summer action film audience by throwing in a lot of profanity into his screenplay, as well as violence that reaches extremely graphic and hyperkinetic levels.  The premise, though at times absurd, is enough to keep one's attention glued without all the gratuitousness getting in the way.

Grillo, Ejogo, Gilford, Sanchez, and Soul do hold one's attention for the film's 105-minute running time; and certain elements from the original (the surveillance cameras; the Orwellian TV screens)  wisely survive in the sequel.  The ambiguous end, of course, leaves the door open for a possible PURGE III in the not-too-distant future, one in which one hopes the poor and the indigent will fight back against the Purgers.  But for the purposes of THE PURGE: ANARCHY, and for all its attendant flaws, the basic Purge premise is enough to sustain.",1405987200,,4329,4.854619565217392
6369289,4,B00JKE4VBQ,"Nine Things About the Movie ""The Purge: Anarchy"" [USA, 2014]

1. I was one of the few people that really liked ""The Purge"". It was sort of misadvertised, so I understand why people didn't like it. It's an epic idea - there is one night a year where all crime is legal. But the movie itself focused on one family in one house, so a lot of people thought the movie was wasted, silly, and unrealistic.

2. The reason I liked it so much is because I realized early on that it wasn't really a horror movie. Sure there is a home-invasion thriller plot, but the movie itself wasn't about that. It was a harsh allegory of American culture. If you can recognize the political, religious, and classist undertones, the movie unlocks itself for you and becomes a smart, engaging black satire.  But most people didn't recognize that, so they thought it sucked.

3. So for the sequel, they tried to fix those problems, to make it more accessible. So everything becomes more obvious. The social undertones of the first movie become blatant overtones in this one. The action moves out of one house and literally into the streets, where nobody is safe because the cops are all off duty.

4. It's a decent flick, but they went a little too far in the other direction. There are multiple plots in this movie - each one showing the adventures of a small group of people who find themselves out in the open city when the Purge begins. During the Purge, the streets are run by rival street gangs, religious end-of-the-world nuts, and lone lunatics. There is danger around every corner.  Little by little, the characters find each other and try to survive the night.

5. The story mostly works, but it's really just cobbled together from parts of other movies, and is kind of predictable. Also, given the violent premise of the movie, there is surprisingly little blood and gore. A lot of the violence happens offscreen.

6. Unless you completely turn your brain off, there is no way you will miss the social commentary here. The movie makes bold statements about American capitalism, the merging of religion with national pride, and the unbalanced class system.

7. The ending is a heavy-handed moral lesson about revenge and forgiveness.

8. This movie will play right into the conspiracy theorists that believe America is turning into a police state run by evil super rich people. The ""Zeitgeist Movement"" Kool-Aid drinkers will think this is a documentary in a few years.

9. This is an entertaining movie that gives you a little to think about. It is louder and dumber than the first one, which many people will appreciate. There are some very chilling scenes, and some good action.  But I was left feeling a little empty. It could be a devastating statement on American values. Or it could be a grungy super-violent grindhouse film. But it tries to walk the line between both, so it ends up being neither.
For such an outrageous idea, it's not a very outrageous movie.",1405814400,127,2951,4.675675675675675
6369290,3,B00JKE4VBQ,"Many of my colleagues and I agree that the idea behind ""The Purge"" is an interesting and original concept for a movie. However, director James DeMonaco struggles to execute this concept. The Purge: Anarchy may deliver intense action, yet it lacks in almost every other area. Before I continue, I would like to clarify that I'm not bashing the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it and don't regret paying to watch it. That being said, I'd like to help you decide whether or not it's a good investment for yourself.

First off, Anarchy's plot is somewhat dull and predictable. Don't expect to find unexpected twists. Certain parts of the movie feel as if the writers ran out of ideas. In addition, dialog between characters is sometimes rather ridiculous and cheesy. I'm sure part of the issue is a result of how many dumb choices characters make throughout the movie.

Acting quality is a mix. I thought both Frank Grillo and Carmen Ejogo did a good job. The other actors weren't terrible, but there was room for improvement in their performances.

The horror and thrill factors are probably what most will find appealing about this movie. These factors are the obvious strengths of the film. If this is most important to you, then you may enjoy Anarchy.

The CGI in the film is mostly good. Explosions and gun shots are noticeably good. The blood splatter effects when people were shot or stabbed are my biggest complaint.

Content: There is plenty of content that some may find offensive in the film. Violence and gore is present throughout the film. However, it was not as violent as I expected, being a horror-themed film. Most scenes do not dwell on the violence that takes place. There are around 40-50 F-words in the film accompanied by many other swear words. There is also one scene with a few religious profanities. No sex or nudity is present in this film.

In summary, if you are interesting in Anarchy for its thrill and horror aspects, give it a shot. Just don't expect to be impressed.",1405728000,4,1993,4.729106628242075

The film presents three different sets of people and their circumstances only to bound together by chance on Purge Night. One is a silent vigilante, another are a single mother and her daughter who are against purging, and finally a young couple willing to go to a relative's house to be protected for the night.
 For many of the skeptics, most of the criticism of the first film will ""purge"" away from memory once you see this. The first film was built upon its smaller dimensions as a ""Twilight Zone""-esque metaphor piece, now this film is something more grandiose and a spectacle bringing more understanding of the purge concept. Instead of a wealthy family living in a mansion, the film depicts the poor, casual Joes just trying to ""survive the night.""

""Anarchy"" builds better on its premise as the race and class issues are a little more prevalent and pronounced than in the first, the violence is even more frequent, graphic, and bloody, the characters are a lot more convincing and relatable, the set pieces and design are more striking and grim, less deus ex machinas, and the humour is surprisingly and darkly more effective here than before like in one scene which involves a zealot speaking on a megaphone about her God-given right to purge.

The film also has fine and humanising performances from all the cast including especially from Frank Grillo as the vigilante and Carmen Ejogo who is the single mother just trying to make a buck to feed her family. Michael K. Williams also makes a surprising performance as a Malcolm X-like leader of an anti-Purge movement. Surely something Spike Lee would at least smile about?

However, the film does not come as something of a rare treasure the first film was given the lack of familiarity and novelty with what I got the first time. To a certain degree, it made film somewhat worse than the first because of the level of awareness and anticipation I have now for the sequel than I did with the first.

""Anarchy"", with personal regret, falters in the cracks a bit. There were some scenes that were missing in the film that were otherwise featured in the trailer like the dogs, the burning building, and the man throwing a Molotov cocktail. Hopefully, such scenes will be on the DVD or sold as the ""unrated, extended edition"" in four months time. The film also had some lack of emergency in the action and suspense moments, the highlighted villains shown in the trailer were not even the entire focus of the film, and the ending, which was the worst part, came across as too sympathetic and shy contradicting its violent premise and the vigilante's main motive. Without giving away spoilers, a proper and grimmer conclusion could have been done accomplished without seeping to sentimentality.

The positive reviews maybe a saving grace for this one but it is not enough for most people to save the film from people's perception of the first, the misleading advertising, and sentimental ending.

In addition, where was the intriguing CCTV footage found in the original and radio clips about people's purge experiences? That felt more sincere and genius than the clever yet uninviting MTV-ish ending credits montage. $3 million sure does make more of a difference than a slightly more Hollywood-friendly $9 million.

On a positive note, however, the film plays out more like an action-thriller than a horror film and the only thing ""horror"" about it are those intriguing masks and make-up that appear only for about four or five scenes.

""Anarchy"" will serve to make the skeptics a little bit happier this round but the missing parts of the pie do detract it from being hailed as ""awesome"" like the first. However, the film makes use of realism in the characters so well and taking another look at the way Purge Night operates in the streets is something to marvel at in an age full of predictable franchise fare. For hardcore fans, still go see it but for anyone else, you might want to wait and catch a potential extended/unrated cut or the deleted scenes on DVD. The complete package will show come that point.",1405728000,,4565,4.7890724269377385
6369292,4,B00JKE4VBQ,"I strongly suspect fast-turnaround sequel The Purge: Anarchy closely resembles the film audiences hoped to see last year when they rushed to the first, which teased a tantalizing science-fiction concepta sinister future in which America has government-sanctioned night every year in which crime, including murder, is legalbut focused squarely on a single home invasion.  Now, the night of the Purge has come around again, and the brutal action explodes onto the streets of the city.  As a result, the film recalls the early cinema of John Carpenter (Escape from New York), George Miller (Mad Max), and Walter Hill (The Warriors).  It is a film of machine guns and muscle cars and urban desolation.  A film of colorful, sadistic gangs ruling the roads and a stoic, shotgun-toting hero with a past who has their number.

This is an unexpectedly entertaining follow-up, one much more satisfying than what came before.  The aforementioned hero, a retired military man who sets out on the most dangerous night of the year to avenge a past tragedy, is rather perfectly played by a charismatic, hard-edged, slightly unshaven Frank Grillo (The Grey, Captain America: The Winter Soldier), an actor with an inherent and magnetic masculinity.  The sequel also further emphasizes the franchise's quote-unquote political and social conscience, including a fear of the perverse impulses hiding behind the mahogany doors of the ultra-wealthy and the ways in which they may be visited upon the ailing, the poor, and the otherwise marginalized.  Its activist soul is often reactionary and simplistic, but the film is also modestly charming as blood-drenched, extra-earnest agitprop, particularly when the protagonists find themselves on sale before a crowd of patrician butchers at a glamorous auction.  There are still significant flaws within the fabric of The Purge: Anarchylet's face it, the very idea of the Purge will always raise frustrating logistical questionsbut it is without a doubt an improved product:  a bit smarter and far, far more propulsive.",1405641600,,2043,5.316770186335404
6369293,5,B00JKE4VBQ,"I have yet to see the ""Original"" The Purge but, the Theatrical trailer surprised me
So i figured why not throw my money to a Film that has no business being put out on a national level during the BOOM BOOM ""Summer"" Craze of Pure CGI Blockbusters (mostly focused on kids & teens) This is without a doubt Not A Summer Film!
Film fans should support this little under-dog but, that's just my nutty opinion...

The Film is simple take the formula of Classics  such as Night of the Living Dead, Assault on Precinct 13, & The Warriors
a group of people must survive the night! with a lot of very deep social commentary
I must say i loved this film mostly cause Hollywood doesn't do stuff like this anymore! It's very much a throw back to the 70's
The Cast is very good each performance ""grounds"" the film in reality
Frank Grillo, Carmen Ejogo, Zach Gilford, Kiele Sanchez, & Zo Soul (these 5 were perfectly cast)
as far as Frank Grillo Marvel/Disney cast him already as Frank Castle aka The Punisher he would Be the Best live action version of Frank Castle! There is a scene in The Purge: Anarchy with Frank sitting on his bed loading his guns (I swear they took this scene from a Punisher Panel couldn't tell you what issue but, i've seen it before!)
Frank Grillo and  Zo Soul's chemistry/relationship is very interesting and adds a lot of heart and soul to the film. Actually all 5 characters are all ""flushed"" out and you actually care about all of them which helps the film too!
The pacing is very good (It's like a hr 35min. give or take but, it flies i wish it was a bit longer!
The story on the surface is simple like i said before but, trust me there is so much more going on (The message isn't Clear it's something you have to really take in and weigh all the messages throughout) It's really NOT a Black and white film it's brilliant
The fact you have this sociopath killing people wearing this very disturbing mask with GOD wrote on the top of the forehead is jarring! There is also some slick swerves in the story I actually didn't see coming.....
Whatever you do don't read any reviews that have spoilers
If you like old school Gritty 70's film check it out (@ times it seems very much like a love letter to The Warriors)
I hope it does good at the box office (so the actors get more attention and rolls) If there is a 3rd Purge put the story in Chicago or Detroit
Overall it's a true ""Surprise""  I wish more films were like this  9.0/10

I will without a doubt buy the BR maybe on release date (That depends on Extras) Hopefully there is a Director's Cut",1405641600,,2562,4.327083333333333

____________________________________________________________

Its that time again where citizens of America must brace themselves for the New Founding Fathers annual tradition, the annual purge. Returning to direct is James DeMonaco whos success from 2013s hit was praised for an interesting concept that saw for one night out of the year, all crime is legal; including murder, and all emergency services would be suspended. This go around we see three sets of people who see themselves at the mercy of crazed citizens on the streets wanting to unleash the beast as they say. With the help of a vengeful father, Frank Grillo, he comes to their aide but only to set his sights on fulfilling his need by nights end.

Going into The Purge: Anarchy I hoped the director would fix some of the narrative issues from the first film that explained more about how the night of the purge came to be. Also the pacing was a bit slow and part of it being that the movie took place inside a home that took a while before things started to happen. In Anarchy, its safe to say the pacing is much better due to the character development and careful set-up before the purge commences. There are moments when gangs pop up unexpectedly around the city that gives a sign of who to look out for. The atmosphere was better compared to the original film where the film rushed to get to the home with Ethan Hawke and his family that we didn't get a chance to let things sink in.

Seeing how the Sergeant (Frank Grillo) was going to participate in the purge to avenge his sons death helped to show us a side we haven't seen before. A disturbing idea that came out of the film was the idea of people voluntarily making themselves as martyrs to provide for their family. The mother and daughter, played by Carmen Ejogo and Zoe Soul, whos father disliked the idea of the purge is an example of that. A resistance force was shown to oppose the purge that only bettered the wealthy while ridding of the poor. This is later explained into more detail as there needing to be a balance in the world. What the movie succeeds at is the expansion of the narrative by venturing into the ideas of faith, politics, and morality.

Considering the intrigue of the movies premise, the more the film progresses the more disturbing it was to watch as it added social commentary. What it said about violence and wealth was that it was a driver towards controlling the people and having a need to reduce the population. Although the movie has an element of fantasy with science fiction, you almost come to understand why the purge is needed. By the films end, as the purge concludes, there is a countdown clock for the next upcoming purge night. As much relief people may have when the night is over and the sirens goes off, you cant help but think that every second of every day that goes by you come one step closer to the next purge.

The acting was mediocre to poor, as was with the last outing, that saw poor decisions by the characters that allowed for insanity to happen.  Here is no different, except you may overlook some of their poor choices as they are covered up by entraining chases and shoot-outs. There is nothing more terrifying then a night of pent up rage that lets loose amongst cities around the country that is deemed legal. A character from the last film who was annoying to watch at sometimes is duplicated here with the daughter. Many times she put herself and the group in danger that only helped to see them get shot at or captured. Another problem is the government regulating fire arms when emergency services are shut  down. We saw this in the last film but was never spoken about. Here, we see someone using a class 4 gun that is prohibited and is mentioned in some way.

Overall, the movie is a step up in the right direction. The pacing helped to make the film more enjoyable to watch and not be refined inside of a home. Watching the Sergeant and his group run through the streets to avoid maniacs was fun and tense at times. There is even a surprise appearance in the film if you pay attention closely. From an acting and narrative stance, there are still things to be improved on but from what Ive seen it works with some exceptions. If you have seen the first Purge and disliked it you may not like this film; however for those who like the concept but were disappointed last year, you may feel differently this time around. An intense thrill ride that won't let up.",1405641600,2,4530,4.536107711138311
