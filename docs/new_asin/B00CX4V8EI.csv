8587094,5,B00CX4V8EI,This is a great deal - 4 DVDs for 24. I love all these work outs! I have seen great results with Jillian! She is motivating and always pushes you the hardest. My body responds well to her 3-2-1 circuit training! I lost most of the weight with the 30 day shred - the workouts vary from 30 to 45 min and are really great and require a minimum amount of equipment (some dumbbells and a mat mainly).,1453420800,,395,4.076923076923077
