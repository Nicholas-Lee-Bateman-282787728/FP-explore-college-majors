8659920,5,B00KM74GDI,"This is where Jason's statistics series really gets into the meat of a statistics course.  The first two volumes and his old course were really going through the basics of the material.  This one covers The Central Limit Theorem, and Confidence Intervals, and how to use the various concepts to estimate population means both for large and small samples.  Like was the case with the previous sets he does not derive any of the formulas or use calculus to solve the problems.  He explains how to use the various tables in the book, and gives a lot of example problems and explains how to interpret the problems so you know what is being asked.  When it comes down to it, the math in statistics is relatively trivial (just some basic algebra at most) but realizing what the problem is asking and the approach to solving the problem is where the difficulty lies.  Jason does a good job of cutting through that.

Like is the case for most of his newer sets, he spends on chapter (sometimes two) introducing a concept and giving some background, then subsequent chapters showing example problems on the concept.  This keeps the chapters relatively short (anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes), and has really good flow to the DVD.  Also like he other DVD sets, he is not touching on everything from class (especially in multi set series like this) so you cannot assume just because you have this you can skip class.  But if you use it as intended, as a supplement, this will make you life much easier when you are doing homework or taking quizzes or exams.

There are three other sets to this series that Amazon does not have.  Volume 4 finishes confidence intervals and introduces hypothesis testing.  Volumes 5 and 6 are devoted entirely to hypothesis testing and variations of it.  I am not sure at this point if that will be the end of the series, but given that hypothesis testing is a very large part of any statistics class you will probably want to check those out too.",1466121600,,1965,4.593123209169055
