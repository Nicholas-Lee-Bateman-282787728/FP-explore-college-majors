7704766,5,B01D9AAJQW,This is a really good movie and a great witness of how much God loves us. I felt that this movie is what happens in life and the reality of the world we physically live in and the reality of the spiritual unseen world. A must see,1471478400,,229,3.893617021276596

8755208,2,B01D9AAJQW,"Ugh! This movie could have been so good, but MISSED!
It wasn't the actors; they were decent. This thing is BADLY written... Weird encounters in the woods, WEIRD way to make their point.
One major complaint was that the guy was ""shacking up"" with his girlfriend/mother of his child, she then gets saved, has scenes where she prays and talks about faith with friends, etc. The guy then later returns to following Christ, they have a ""happy ending"" scene where he actually TALKS TO CHILDREN IN CHURCH. In all that he NEVER makes it right with the lady and marries her! WHAT!?!?!
Also, in the bar scene, the bartender is clearly an old friend, yet obviously and totally over serves the guy, says ""Good night Eli"" as he goes to drive home in the middle of the night...
UGH!  @@ This movie is supposed to be Christian??",1496534400,,813,4.530612244897959
