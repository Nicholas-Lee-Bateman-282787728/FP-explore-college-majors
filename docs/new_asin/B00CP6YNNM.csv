There's lots of antagonism! The police guy has a girlfriend! She doesn't like the punks either! There's more police! Everybody travels around a lot! They get mad! Someone gets kidnapped by the punks!

The people of the town start hunting the punks! There's a lot of talking! It's good dialogue and you can't live without it! You can't live without this movie either! Because there's punks in it! They're movie-punks, though so you really better not trust them! They live for mayhem and not being nice! You'll be on the edge of your seat! After the movie is over, you'll sigh with relief that the tension is passed! You might need a chamois to mop up your brow! Maybe even a squeegee, but only if you have a flat forehead!

But don't be so quick to relax! Without much fanfare the Vinegar Syndrome people tacked another complete masterpiece of action as a bonus on this disc! It's on both the BluRay and the DVD! It's called ""Nomad Riders""! It's about a biker gang! We all love that!

This gang is worse than the punks! They're mean! Peace may never be found! Or maybe it will! Stranger things have happened! You'll have to find out for yourself! I'm not one of those guys that likes to ruin a movie by telling you the whole plot! I don't even like using exclamation points! I don't know what's gotten into me tonight! I can't seem to stop adding them onto the end of my sentences! Maybe the punks are making me do it! It might be those bikers too! Somebody help me!",1509062400,,1635,4.443333333333333
8584408,1,B00CP6YNNM,"This is pretty awful. I was hoping for a cheesy punk 80s movie. This wasn't that. It's a really slow, super boring movie with no real point. Bad acting, but not bad enough to be funny. Just boring bad. Nothing particularly happens and scenes drag on forever. Not the 80s fun I thought it would be.",1472774400,3,297,4.321428571428571

8584410,4,B00CP6YNNM,"I bought this mainly to watch the super obscure ""Nomad Riders"".  It didn't disappoint.  Lets all raise a toast to the great Steve Thrust, may he continue to be awesome.",1379030400,4,168,4.566666666666666
