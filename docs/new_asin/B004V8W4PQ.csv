8443072,4,B004V8W4PQ,"Now, this is some descent schlock, all of it is from the late 90's and 2000's. But for bucks, you can beat it! There okay movies, but what I enjoy is MillCreek, which I have been a fgan of for some time. Also there is Echo Bridge, they knock out some reel(y) nice little sets, Look for the Subspecies set 1-3, Puppet Masters(from Full Moon) 1-3, and another set is now available. I have the original Boxed Set, now Uber O.O.P (Out of Print, for those not aware of the lingo)
 To sum up, if you want to blow a few hours, have some laughs, and not take time seriously, this is a great little set, though look around as many of these are popping up. Echo Bridge is releasing 4 packs, some will have one very Rare Film on the set. Let me give an example ""The Midnight Horror Collection: Bloody Slashers"" This set contains Curtains, OOP, except on here, now don't be upset, because the quality is not remastered as far as I can tell, but it still looks very nice, especially to have it on DVD...  Hop[e this sheds a bit o' light on this and these awesome packs

 Enjoy and remember, do not take most of these films too seriously, do your research as well, you would be shocked at what has come out",1314748800,,1192,4.214912280701754
