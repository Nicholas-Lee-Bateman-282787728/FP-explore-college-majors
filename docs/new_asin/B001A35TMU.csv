8275827,3,B001A35TMU,"This in one of my favorites cartoons from my childhood, and I think it will be great for those who love Japanese animation, but there is a problem. If you don't have a Multi Region Region Free DVD player, it won't play, cause this product has been made for zone 2, and North America(USA and Canada)is zone 1, so your machine won't recognize the discs unless it plays DVDs from that zone. So think carefully before you get it, cause you not only ended up buying the series, but also you will be forced to expend some more on a new DVD player. Also, it has been made for Japanese audience only, with no subtitules features, which is sad and very disappointed. This great collection of the TV series that came out during the latest 60s' and early 70s', was air in a few countries around the world and translated to different languages. I was one of those kids from those days who used to watch it, and absolutely enjoyed it.
I have been trying to find out if this product was made with subtitles features for English or Spanish audiences, but nobody seems to know for sure.
