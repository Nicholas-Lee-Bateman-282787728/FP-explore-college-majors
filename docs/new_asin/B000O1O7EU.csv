8182692,5,B000O1O7EU,"I found this video to be straight forward.  Ray Miller does an excellent job in taking the viewer through massage.  He gives tips and introduces the moves and strokes that he uses throughout the massage shown,refering to them and giving additional helpful information as he goes through.

I am also impressed with the filming and lighting(ie:clarity, distance/closeness,being able to see the massage well). I also like that this DVD has scene selection. It is for tips,strokes,specific body,and a small segment on aromatherapy.",1197244800,,527,5.402439024390244
