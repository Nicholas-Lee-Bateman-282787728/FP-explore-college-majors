2556061,4,B000F9SUP8,"When I was a boy in Philadelpia the Saturday matinee was the reigning tradition.  When I was very young I might spend the weekend with my grandparents, and my grandmother would take me.  Roy Rogers was the staple for the extra matinee special.  He was my hero, the good guy who stood for all the right things.

When I became older, in the early 50's, Roy became a Christian in the Billy Graham evangelistic crusade in Los Angeles.  He was one of the founders of the Hollywood Christian group, and once again he was my hero.  He not only believed the right stuff, but he did the right stuff.  He adopted several orphan children.  He traveled with the Billy Graham evangelistic Association in their crusades.  He worked with the youth of America.

Watching the King of the Cowboys took me back to a better time in this nation's culture.  A time when we knew right from wrong, and our heros were champions of the right.  We need to get back there, and the Roy Rogers Collection helps us to remember.",1179100800,4,996,4.472222222222222
2556062,5,B000F9SUP8,Enjoyable collection of Roy's movies.  Quality was better than I expected except one out of my three DVD players could not open one movie.  What ever happened to the simple turn on and play system?,1179014400,,197,4.6
2556063,4,B000F9SUP8,"I'm a father of four young kids, and I never watched Roy Rogers before my wife the time my wife bought this DVD set for our oldest son, age 11.  I've watched a few episodes, but I'm not a big fan of western genre or old, black-and-white films and shows.  That said, I *will* tell you the reaction of my kids:  they love the shows!

Although people *do* get shot and killed (the bad guys, of course!), there isn't any of the gratuitous gore common in modern films.  Roy sings love songs, rallies the troops, and does what's right -- although he *is* a pragmatist who is willing to bend the rules (or break the law) to ultimately do what he knows is best, right, true.

Most all of the shows are in black-and-white, and they very obviously haven't been digitially restored, which is a disappointment as you see shows on TV.

At least the good guys are good, the bad guys are bad, and the good guys always triumph.  It's suitable for children (if you don't mind the western-style shoot-outs).",1177977600,11,989,4.425414364640884
2556064,3,B000F9SUP8,"Roy Rogers, with his fancy, spangly duds, his ornate six-shooters and gorgeous white stallion, once was every kid's ideal of what the King of the Cowboys should be. Roy's three-reel movies always took time out for a little music, whether it be by Rogers himself or the Sons of the Pioneers-- the singing group he started out with in 1935 as Leonard Slye. Between 1938 and '51, Roy appeared as himself in over 70 films. Additionally, his TV show ran for 100 episodes from 1951 to '57.

The ROY ROGERS 20 MOVIE PACK offers a choice selection of Roy's oaters. Along with wife Dale and sidekicks Gabby Hayes and Smiley Burnette, our hero somehow manages to get into all kinds of fixes. Inside of an hour though, the bad guys always lose and Roy and gang'll sing a song or two. It's a surefire formula, one that every fan of westerns is certain to appreciate.

2556066,4,B000F9SUP8,"This is a really nice set that would make a perfect stocking stuffer for anyone who loved the movies back in the day.  It's 20 movies on 4 discs. Run times range from 52-72 minutes.

The digital restoration is very extensive and they clearly had some poor stock to work from.  They look very clean, but as is typical of extensive restoration there is some reduction in resolution at times.  Sometimes you can see a slight blur where the old scratches are that were repaired -and there are many. Some reels are pretty clear while others are a bit more blurry but nothing is intolerable in my opinion.

The loss of resolution is most noticable in the darkest scenes.  There are many dark scenes where it's clear there wasn't enough visual information to restore it to full light.

Despite everything, the movies are very watchable.  My mother who saw all these movies every Saturday for a nickel was very happy, as I expect most people of that generation would be with these discs.

Overall, the resolution is slightly better than VHS tape, but much lower than a typical, modern DVD.  The sound was only very occasionally muddy and is really pretty good for the most part.  They've also got all the sound at a pretty consistent volume so there are no extreme changes in volume.

Considering the very economical price, I'd say the set is well worth what you pay.  I'd be a little disappointed if it were an expensive set, but it's OK for the money.  If you're tempted, I say go for it. You won't be sorry. You get the stories and the characters just fine and that's what's important.",1154044800,147,1580,4.556737588652482

I am a much older man now and when the world's problems get to pressing in on me I just watch one of Roy and Dale's movies or TV shows. People often say time changes and that is of course not true only people change. Roy and Dale were special. I think God cut them from the same cloth, they were perfect to me. It truly was a much simpler time  back then. Some things in our world had to change now if we could just take all the good changes and put them with the simple times of the world Roy and Dale gave us I think this world would be a nice place. I don't think Roy and Dale would think the world of today turned out to be what they or a young second grader like me had hoped for.

2556188,3,B000F9SUP8,"The good news about this set is that the film transfers are generally good and the whole set is quite a bargain. However, some of the films have been heavily cut. ""Utah"" is reduced from 78 minutes to 53 minutes and ""Heldorado"" and ""Cowboy and the Senorita"" also suffer badly, with lesser cuts to other films. I can only assume that this has been done to make them fit into a television time slot. It makes them worthless for the serious collector.

""My Pal Trigger"" is by far the best copy I've seen so far of this film and it is complete. The two colour films here are also complete - ""Bells of San Angelo"" and ""Under California Stars"".

Because of the cuts I can only award this set three stars. For any serious collector of Westerns, I would recommend trying to obtain a copy of the book ""The Western"" by Phil Hardy (Aurum Press Ltd.).",1400803200,5,838,4.365384615384615

They taught obedience to God, our parents and the American Constitution. We learned to be respectful to our elders and leaders, to be welcoming to strangers, and to give a hand up to those in need.

The only complaint I have is that all these movies are not done in color.  Good acting, interesting plots, and lots of action.  The quality of the videos is very good, and the sound is very good.  Just one point I'd like to make: if you buy certain Western movies looking for a certain actor who is not starring in the movie, but is supposed to be in it, if his name is not on the credits, then he only has a cameo role.  I watched this movie hoping to see Clayton Moore, and his role is only a cameo; if you don't look carefully, you will miss him.  But I'm satisfied with the other movie titles offered in this series.  It has ""Under California Stars"", one of my favorites Roy Rogers movies, in which Trigger is stolen.",1345680000,,831,4.254777070063694

i.e. trigger, buttermilk, bullitt, Pat Brady, Nellybelle, Gabby Hayes. Love the black and white movies. What a blast back to the past and such a fabulous past it was.

I've seen most of these episodes before but on this set I realized that quite a few things were cut from some of the episodes, one in particular was ""The King of the Cowboys"" episode, it's meant to be a full-length movie, not an hr. long episode. Several scenes were cut out of it and it was shortened by at least 15, if not 20, minutes.

2556217,4,B000F9SUP8,I really enjoyed watching these old westerns. Roy Rogers and the gang are great classic family fun. These are the kind of shows and movies that I wish were around today. Mill Creek Entertainment did a good job of bringing these films to DVD and the quality of the discs are very good.,1270252800,3,284,4.377358490566038

2556220,1,B000F9SUP8,"Some of the DVDs are nice tranfers. However, that does not matter to me. Every movie has Mill Creek Entertainment IDs popping in and out of the lower right corner. That ruins the entire set for me. It's like watching a good old movie on TV... only without the commercials.",1247616000,15,272,4.46
2556221,2,B000F9SUP8,"I do like the movie pack except for disc # 3, could not get it play in the DVD player, would continually get stuck and only played part of one movie and the last one otherwise there all the rest that were unavailable which is upsetting. Can this disc be replaced by you?

2556224,1,B000F9SUP8,"The Roy Rogers anthology collections have good deal of overlap and that is how I discovered that a substantial portion of Heldorado had been edited out - I assume for the purpose of fitting several movies on a disk.  In Heldorado's case, this gives the characters a kind of goofy maniacal quality that might make someone think they would make good subjects for Mystery Science Theater 3000.  For instance, Dale Evans, a wealthy heiress in the movie, walks around at the beginning of the movie flipping a quarter like George Raft.  Roy had tipped her the quarter when he mistook her for a hat check girl in a scene that was deleted but which set the stage for their relationship.  Another scene that was deleted was a parade scene in the middle of the movie, much longer and more revealing than the one at the end, which showed downtown Las Vegas in 1946.  It was fascinating but not for the purchasers of this collection.  Those are but two of many annoying examples of this which made dialogue and continuity appear inappropriate and disjointed.  I haven't checked any of the other movies for this but it is a flaw that makes it a poor buy to me.  The movie in proper form is excellent - one of my favorites.  I would purchase these if they were not available anywhere else - which many are.",1205107200,29,1292,4.510729613733906
2556225,5,B000F9SUP8,"I don't have cable so I have not seen these movies in years. Quality is not exactly perfect but it's plenty good for me. Amazing the films held up all these years. The one thing I've missed most all these years is the unique sound of the Winchester rifle's and the Colt handguns, even though real firearms don't sound like that. Thanks Amazon for having these DVD's available for us. G. Burton",1186272000,6,393,4.472222222222222
2556226,4,B000F9SUP8,"This is definately a mixed-bag of Roy Rogers films, but really worth checking out. As stated in a previous review, LIGHTS OF OLD SANTA FE is a heavily edited version, however, UNDER CALIFORNIA STARS appears complete and is 20min. longer +2songs than the Roy Rogers Authorized HAPPY TRAILS THEATER release...& it looks great too!
20 movies here for under ten bucks...& they all are in decent shape (visually), some edited for TV consumption, some complete.
All in all, a good value for your hard earned cash.
Buy this as a starter pack and then look for complete versions of your favorites...& this could be a hard task since Roy's movies were cut for TV eons ago. However, complete versions are out there.
Mill Creek has great packaging and a pretty good product.
20 Roy movies. Under 10 bucks from AMAZON...It's a good value!",1180742400,11,826,4.783216783216783
