8638590,4,B00FORSN7G,"As someone who came to Palm Springs for the first time back in the mid-1980s, i can appreciate the tremendous effort that Alexander homeowners have invested in reviving their neighborhoods. The documentary shows the extent to which most of these houses had disintegrated by the 80s; however, thanks to the largely gay population moving to the city, the major portion of these homes have been saved. We bought one of them in the late 90s, and sold it before the current appetite for all things mid-century. As featured in the documentary, it is true that the cost of what was a typical working man's inexpensive home in the early 1960s ($22,000) is now selling for $600,000. Such is gentrification. One wonders however: Who is going to provide architectural style at an affordable price in the current era?  I have one minor objection to the documentary, and thus my four stars instead of five. Despite its media representation, and despite some of the interviewees' attitudes, Palm Springs is still a very affordable town, even by Southern California standards, and one can still enjoy the mid-century ambiance without paying $600,000 for a home.",1495929600,,1146,5.0
