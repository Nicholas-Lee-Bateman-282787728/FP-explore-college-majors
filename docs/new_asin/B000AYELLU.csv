2397133,5,B000AYELLU,"Jeff Hardy, popular in WWE for his TLC matches w/ brother Matt, against the Dudleys, Edge/Christian, has really come into his own in TNA as a singles wrestler.  His high flying moves, and interesting personality fit more in TNA and less with the soap operatic WWE.  This 2 disc set is a great introduction to Hardy's first 1.5 years in TNA.  Matches include his intro into TNA vs. AJ Styles, tag team action w/ Styles vs. Team Canada as well as matches against Kid Kash, Alpha Male Monty Brown.  PPV matches: Ladder match w/ Jeff Jarrett (Victory Road), tag match w/ AJ and Macho Man Randy Savage vs. Jarrett and Hall & Nash (Turning Point), hardcore match vs. Abyss (Destination X, JH get dropped hard on thumbtacks!), and a Six sides of steel (six-sided ring, also unique in TNA) table cage match vs. Raven (Lockdown).

This is a great set, with action galore.  So if you are a Jeff Hardy fan, or not check it.  TNA is coming to Spike TV in October 05.  Check out TNA's website for more details on this and listing of this DVD package @ tnawrestling.com",1124496000,5,1055,4.486910994764398

2397153,5,B000AYELLU,"I also got this for my 67yr old mom. She loves Jeff Hary. I dig him to.
It's just a DVD of his great matches while he was in TNA. He's an incredible showman.
But, it's only matches he was in while in TNA, it's not like the WWE DVD about Jeff Hardy. It's still a must have if you're a fan. He's been one of the best wrestlers in the biz for the past 10 years. I'm glad he's back in TNA now. The WWE dropped the ball with him letting him go. He's a major ""main event"" superstar.",1265328000,2,476,3.77
2397154,2,B000AYELLU,"I only recently gotten into wrestling again. For Christmas I recieved Jeff Hardy: My Life, My Rules and had watched all of that DVD in one day. On January 4th, when Jeff ""returned"" to TNA I immediately the next day bought this DVD. When it arrived in the mailbox a couple of days later I couldn't wait to open it and when I did I got a surprise...ONE disc! I am extremely disappointed since this was billed as a two disc set. Staying on the DVD shelf, but I am disappointed it was not what I payed for.",1263772800,,502,4.13265306122449

2397156,3,B000AYELLU,"I love Jeff Hardy but this is not his best material. A few matches on this set are worth watching but Hardy was signed to TNA when they still had Scott Hall, Kevin Nash, and Jeff Jarrett thinking it was 2000. Hardy had a good feud with Abyss in TNA and his best match in TNA probably was the Monsters Ball match where he did that sweet senton onto Abyss from the top of the TNA sign. The ladder matches are always what made Jeff Hardy shine. TNA fans can say he did his best work in TNA, but its hard to argue when you consider his matches in WWE. The TLC matches against Dudley Boys and Edge and Christian and the amazing ladder matches against Rob Van Dam (probably TNA bound) and Undertaker from Raw. I bought this set because I enjoy Jeff Hardy's work but this is hardly his best stuff, expect for the hardcore matches as I said earlier. Id recommend for Jeff Hardy fans the Hardy Boyz dvd and the Ladder matches set. There you will see Jeff shine.",1186617600,,952,4.2076502732240435

2397158,2,B000AYELLU,"This DVD is poor, and below the expectations of any wrestling fan mainly for Jeff's fans, the matches never end somebody always screwed him during his appereances. And the first disc is the worst of it.

Buy it under your own risk.",1170288000,,231,4.5
2397159,4,B000AYELLU,"Hardy is now back in the WWE but I'll miss him in TNA. He had a better ring entrance than his WWE one and better entrance music too. Plus I'm sure he had a better chance of being World champ in TNA than he does in the WWE. If Only he showed up in TNA more and didn't keep getting suspended for no showing. WWE marks say he no showed because he was mis-used but that's total bull. If you watch this dvd you'd see he wasn't mis-used at all. Plus you saw his face all over TNA posters whenever they were promoting a ppv. They would've put the whole company behind him and I don't think the WWE ever will. Hell I doubt the WWE will even give us a Jeff Hardy dvd.

Debut of Hardy in TNA
JEFF HARDY VS. AJ STYLES
A good match until Kid Kash interferes and causes a no contest ending. I always wanted to see a rematch but it never happened.
RATING: 71/2 out of 10

6 MAN TAG TEAM MATCH
Jeff Hardy, A.J. Styles and Ron Killings VS. Kid Kash, Dallas and Monty Brown
RATING: 7.5

Contenders match
Jeff Hardy vs Monty Brown
Hardy wins this one in a hard fought battle but loses the second time these 2 wrestled in a contenders match months later but that match isn't on the dvd.

RATING: 7.5

NWA WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP
JEFF JARRET VS. JEFF HARDY
Great match although I've had enough of Jarrett already. I mean this is an old match yet Jarrett is still in our faces as champ yet again. Still though his matches are better than WWE marks give him credit for.
WINNER: JEFF JARRET.
RATING: 8

JEFF HARDY & AJ STYLES VS. NATURALS
Not bad but it could've been better since both teams can go. TNA usually always puts on good tag matches and this match is no exception.
Winners: Hardy and A.J.

 RATING: 7

JEFF HARDY, AJ STYLES & RON KILLINGS VS. TEAM CANADA

Good match but a little rushed since it was on Impact which is only an hour show.
WINNERS: JEFF HARDY, AJ STYLES & RON KILLINGS
RATIG: 7.5

VICTORY ROAD
LADDER MATCH FOR THE NWA WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP
JEFF HARDY VS. JEFF JARRET:

A Really good ladder match with Hardy getting screwed over by Hall and Nash.

WINNER: JEFF JARRET
RATING: 8

TURNING POINT
6 MAN TAG TEAM MATCH
JEFF HARDY, AJ STYLES & RANDY SAVAGE VS. JEFF JARRET,
 Hardy and A.J carry the match for the team while Savage doesn't show up until the very end. He doesn't look in as good of a shape as he had when he was with Gorgeous George that's for sure. Anyway Savage gets the win with a roll up on Jaff Jarrett. Hardy and A.J. did all the work though.
WINNERS: JEFF HARDY, AJ STYLES & RANDY SAVAGE
RATING: 8

JEFF HARDY VS. BOBBY RHOODE:

Bobby Rhoode is a good example of a heel that Jarrett should just step back and let have the belt sooner or later. I mean Jarrett shouldn't always be the only heel allowed to be champ. Hardy wins this one but in a match at a later ppv Jarrett caused him to lose to Rhoode.
WINNER: JEFF HARDY
RATING: 7

FINAL RESOLUTION
SPECIAL GUEST REFEREE: RODDY PIPER
JEFF HARDY VS. SCOTT HALL:
Not the best match since Hall isn't in as good shape as he used to be. He was a clown with talent and in this match he's just a clown mostly. Hardy gets some laughs when he acts like he's surfing on Hall's back. Hardy wins after the twist of fate and Swanton Bomb on Hall. At least Hardy won this one but it's still one of the weaker matches on the dvd.

WINNER: JEFF HARDY
RATING: 6

DESTINATION X
FINAL ASSULT MATCH
JEFF HARDY VS. ABYSS:

Jeff Hardy against the under-rated Abyss who's much more than a Foley/Kane rip-off like WWE marks call him. This guy can go and all his matches are entertaining. Plus if a WWE wrestler that wasn't Foley used thembtacks in a match I'm sure WWE fans would be less quick to call him a wannabe Foley. Hardy wins with the Twist of Fate on top of a ladder.
WINNER: JEFF HADRDY
RATING: 9

JEFF HARDY & AJ STYLES VS. ABYSS & RAVEN
Very good but it goes to a no contest but there's still a lot of violence anyway.
WINNERS: NO CONTEST
RATING: 7.5

LOCKDOWN
6 SIDES OF STEEL TABLES MATCH
JEFF HARDY VS. RAVEN
This is a brutal and fun match. It makes me wish that when these two were supposed to wrestle in a Raven's Rules match at the following ppv that Hardy actually showed up.

2397169,3,B000AYELLU,"Ok Now Jeff Hardy easily has one of the biggest fanbaes in TNA, nut now because of what he has done there. He has so many fans because of what he has done in WWF/WWE. People like Jeff Hardy for all his insane TLC matches in the WWE and because how good and entertaining they are. The Hardy Boyz were a great tag team but unlike Matt Hardy, Jeff is not a good singles wrestler at all especially if there are no sorts of weapons involved. It isn't 2000 or 2001 anymore and the truth is Jeff Hardy is not a very godo wreslter anymore and this dvd is not worth buying and TNA rushed it out way too fast. Jeff wasn't even in the company for a year when the released it. A better DVD buy would be WWF's Hardy Boyz:Leap of Faith. That DvD has no bad matches on it unlike this one. Jeff Hardys matches now are boring and he does nothing new and is not into any of his matches. TNA cant even put him in the main event mix since they cant rely on him because he skips tapings. I suggest u save ur money and Get the Best of The X Division or Hardy Boyz Leap of Faith if u don't have them already,you'll be more satisfied with your money.",1144972800,3,1126,3.9867256637168142
2397170,5,B000AYELLU,"While I agree with a couple of the reviews that say TNA may have rushed this 2 disc DVD collection considering that Jeff had only been in TNA for a short time,I personally feel that it doesn't matter. I personally love this DVD collection -rushed or not...because I'm a HUGE fan of The Charismatic Enigma Jeff Hardy,& will be 4ever. This DVD collection WAS worth every penny that I paid 4 it because I'm not only a HUGE fan...I love Jeff Hardy!!!!!",1139702400,,448,4.475609756097561
2397171,3,B000AYELLU,"People can say this DVD was rushed to make money off of Hardy's popularity/fanbase but you could understand why TNA did it because look at Hardy now...he's no showed two PPV's & who knows if Jeff is gonna be in TNA much longer since they can't trust him enough to put him in a high mid-card position anymore.  They've invested time into making Hardy a top star so they may as well captialize before it's too late.  However, there are too many filler matches & dud's for a two disc set, it would be better if this was a one disc set.

vs. AJ Styles (TNA debut) - It was a good match but the crowd was so into it that it made it seem better than what it was.  Kid Kash & Dallas interfered.

Jeff Hardy signs the TNA contract - Just a segment where Dusty Rhodes has Hardy sign his TNA contract only to get interrupted by Monty Brown & Jeff Jarrett.

w/AJ Styles & Ron Killings vs. Kid Kash, Dallas, Monty Brown - Good six man tag match.

vs. NWA Champion Jeff Jarrett - This was one of the best matches on the disc.  They really made it out to be like these two wanted to kill each other as Jarrett got busted open as security held the two apart before the ring introductions were finished.  Alot of the wrestlers came out to watch this one.  Again, one of the best matches on this set.

vs. Monty Brown - This match was on Impact so it's clipped.  Nothing really special as this was just used to set up the ""Monster's Ball"" match between Brown, Raven, and Abyss for the Victory Road PPV.

w/AJ Styles & Ron Killings vs. Team Canada - Another IMPACT match.  Just an average match with nothing special to talk about here since it was just used to setup all the matches for Victory Road.

Ladder Match vs. NWA Champion Jeff Jarrett - This match was from Victory Road & but wasn't better than their first match IMO.  There was some good spots as Hardy is great at hardcore type matches but it seemed like everyone (the wrestlers & announcers) was more concerned about putting over the Outsiders reunion (Scott Hall & Kevin Nash) than having a great match as Scott Hall just kept interfearing & the ending was weak as Nash came out with gutairs for him & Hall and all three guys hit Hardy with it to cost him the match.

w/AJ Styles vs. The Naturals - A match form Impact & nothing mentionable here.  Just a average tag match.

w/AJ Styles & Macho Man Randy Savage vs. Jeff Jarrett, Scott Hall, Kevin Nash - This match was from Turning Point & it basically an attempt to do a remake of the nWo angle with Jarrett assuming the ""Hogan"" role.  They called themselves the ""Kings Of Wrestling"" even to the point where Hall & Nash came out dressed up like Elvis.  Another good six man tag as this was the best Hall looked during his short TNA run.  It was mostly AJ & Hardy since Macho Man didn't show until the very end & did a sleeperhold before pinning Jarrett with a horrible looking rollup pin.  Good match but the ending killed it...and no wonder you haven't seen Savage since then.

vs. Bobby Roode - Nothing special here as this Impact match was pretty short & sweet.

Roddy Piper as Special Referee vs. Scott Hall - This match was from Final Resolution.  Hall once again came out looking like Elvis & had a comedic interaction between him & Piper before the match...but that's all that's worth mentioning on this match because this match was completely horrible. Scott Hall just doesn't have it in him anymore & not Hardy, the appearence of Piper, or the suprize of Abyss at the end could save this match.

Falls Count Anywhere Match vs. Abyss - This match is from Destination X.  This was one of the best TNA hardcore matches since they did go all around the arena & outside.  Great match

w/AJ Styles vs. Abyss & Raven - It's from Impact so once again, it's clipped.  It was a decent match but only there to have him & AJ get beat down to set up their two matches for Lockdown.

Steel Cage Tables Match vs. Raven - This one is from Lockdown.  Basically the best match Raven's had in TNA for almost half a year and again, Hardy is great at these hardcore themed matches.  One of the best matches on this disc.  Raven & Hardy gave a great show.

Overall, there are alot of filler matches from Impact on this disc along with a dud (ala the Scott Hall match & the ending with Randy Savage) which does make this disc does seemed rushed.  Sets like this should have been reduced to one disc & only give the two disc sets to those who have been around long enough footage to fill out two disc of quality matches (like how Christopher Daniels SHOULD HAVE BEEN).  But if your a fan of Jeff Hardy...this is probably the only chance your gonna get to get his TNA matches on a DVD set.  Overall, it's enjoyable.",1136332800,5,4697,4.300341296928328
2397172,3,B000AYELLU,"As some of you may know, I think TNA is way better than WWE. But truthfully, this dvd set is not the best of Jeff Hardy. At least not the first disk. It seemed like they forced this dvd too early in Hardy's TNA career. In some of the matches, it was like he wasn't really into it, and then some he was, but you decide. But that's just the dvd...he's fine now, believe it. If I pissed off any Jeff hardy fans I'm sorry. If I've ever pissed off any John Cena fans, kiss my a$$.

But the matches are good, dam the cage match is awesome and his match with AJ Styles is great even if I think they can have an even better one.

8080521,5,B000AYELLU,"When i got this dvd in 2005 when it was released i was glad too see Jeff Hardy back in action & wrestling again & in his own unique way. Jeff Hardy has always been my favorite high flyer because his style is so unique,when he goes toe to toe with any wrestler(no matter their style) and competes his damndest to put on a show for the crowd & use anything he can to get the advantage,this man isn't afraid to take any risks. That is what makes Jeff such a unique wrestler & impressive showman. This guy i have followed since i was a kid and started watching WWF & WCW in the early 90's during the ""Attitude Era"" and i missed him when he took his high flying action elsewhere. I stopped watching the WWE after Wreatlemania 20 because i got into my music. When i saw this dvd at Bestbuy i scooped it up and figured ""what the hell"" & i got too see Jeff & others i recognized from other industries do some crazy fighting in a 6 sided ring(i thought that was sweet. Jeff Hardy goes up against the phenomenal AJ Styles as well as tag teams up with him for some wicked intense tag-team action. You get 3 matches where Jeff goes up against the monster Abyss,and those matches are like hardcore matches with Jeff & Abyss using whatever they can get their hands on. Jeff climps up a scaffolding rail & does a 25 foot Swanton off of the X frame onto Abyss through a table. You get Jeff's first match & introduction to the TNA indusrty and the issues he has with Jeff Jarrett(not a fan). But when Hardy appears the arena goes absolutley nuts,Jeff always outdoes himself and tries to do crazier & crazier stuff not just for the fans but for himself as well. The matches with Jeff against Raven in the 6 sided cage & there are so many tables....so many tables,and they all get destroyed. Thie match has gotta be as brutal as almost any WWE/F tables match,Hardy is innovative. The matches vary from straight up wrestling 1on1 & some tag-team action,the cage matches,the hardcore matches,the no DQ matches and sets up the whole future for Jeff Hardy & the rest of his career in TNA.
I say if you are a Hardy boys fan & have some old WWE/WWF or Hardy Boyz dvd's & you want too get a look at his other wrestling works inbetween coming back to WWE in 2008-2009 i think,like i said i stopped watching at about 15. I notice that TNA put out a part 2 of this for Jeff Hardy & i am gonna go ahead and order that,then i'll review that as well. If you,like me read that part 2 is more like a documentary and also have some more crazy matches that we all love. But there is some extras on this dvd set,disc 1 is 6 matches & disc 2 has a bonus music video for Modest & the makng of Modeat.
All in all there coulda been at least 1 interview or a comment about each match before or after it is played,but that's why part 2 was made. 2disc edition here is great,lots of high-flying high-intensity,daredevil antics and his relentless assault and fearlessness around bigger and different style opponents.
Must have for fans of Hardy boys action of Jeff solo.
Lots of blood,lots of crazy jumps and really high whisper in the winds off of the cage onto the floo & into the crowd. Don't miss Jeff's match against Raven & Abyss,those are violent,relentless matches. Go add it to your Extreme collection.",1434153600,,3266,4.303571428571429

8080523,5,B000AYELLU,"This was an awesome dvd. At this time Jeff Hardy had just left WWE and he was the biggest free agent to go to TNA at the time. He was very young and hadn't hit his prime yet. He fit into what TNA was doing. They had a lot of young up and coming wrestlers from the X-Division. There were a lot of high flying. It was a great place for Hardy to shine. Some of the best matches on the set are his matches with Jeff Jarrett. His ladder match with him was off the hook. My favorite match is the six man tag against Hall, Nash and Jarrett. It wasn't a classic but a fun match given the names involved. I liked his match with Hall. Hall was not in the best shape but it was still a good match. Jeff Hardy had a great chemistry with Abyss. They had a hardcore match that has to be one of his best matches in TNA, Jeff Hardy had a great match with AJ Styles which adds to the greatness of the set because it's the dream match of the Franchise of TNA up against a new top player in Hardy. Hardy had one of his best matches with Raven. Raven has always been an underrated wrestler. Those two have great wrestling characters and a great chemistry. It was one of the best matches on the set. There is a music video Modest a song done by Jeff Hardy that's awesome. There are some filler matches here but more then plenty of awesome matches to make it one of the best TNA dvd releases ever. This was when TNA was starting to make some noise on the wrestling scene. Not long after this you would see Sting, Christian and Kurt Angle defect to TNA. I felt like Hardy even though he had a brief run there he helped put TNA on the map while it was getting on tv. Enjoy the dvd and Cheers!",1393804800,,1668,3.997005988023952

My favorite match, was the Jeff hardy vs Jeff Jarrett in a ladder match, i didn't enjoy the outcome of the match though. overall this is my favorite dvd in the worlde.
