8181360,5,B000NTQNUE,"Stephen Platt is a personal favorite of mine the level of detail in his art is amazing! This DVD can teach anyone the most powerful tool in any comic artist utility belt, the thumbnail sketch. He also talks about other very important key points like drama and emotion. A truly great lesson. I have watched it at least 15 times! AWESOME!!!",1270944000,,338,4.557377049180328
8181361,5,B000NTQNUE,"Stephen Platt is one of the best comic artists and my personal favorite.  This DVD is great for anyone interested in becoming a better comic artist.  He not only explains what he is doing, but WHY he is doing it and that is really important for any teacher to acknowledge.  He begins the lesson small with explanations of the importance of thumbnails and then proceeds to create a great finished pencil page from start to finish.  Some of the tips and tricks become a little redundant and I would have liked to have seen an edited down version of a couple different drawings rather than one uncut segment.  He speaks of a future DVD and I really hope this comes out soon because I will be first in line to pick it up.  Thanks Splatt for your great work and I hope to see you back in comics one day.",1247443200,4,798,4.286666666666667
