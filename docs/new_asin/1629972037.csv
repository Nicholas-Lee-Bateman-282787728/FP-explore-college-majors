7800608,5,1629972037,"My wife and I, long ""retired"", just finished watching this Great Course series of lectures by Dr. Winn on Exoplanets and we found it great, indeed.  We did it one-lecture-a-day basically this past month (12/15) and on most days that days talk was definitely the high-point, which may indicate how unexciting our lives are but actually indicates how enthralled we were, especially me, a long time science and sci fi fan.  (Apparently, the course is also available on CD for audio fans, commuters, etc.)
We really cant praise this course highly enough.  Weve enjoyed several courses through Great Courses (the Hubble images one of our faves) over the years and this one is tops, by far, in our views.  Dr. Winns enthusiasm, organization, occasional humor, and the mind-expanding subject matter kept us eagerly anticipating the next talk.  He is right at the forefront of this fascinating area of astronomy with major discoveries almost daily.  We are truly in a Golden Age of Astronomy.
Many times we were tempted to listen to more than one half-hour lecture daily, but each one was so full of information and carefully organized that we resolved to digest them slowly, and they were fodder for fascinating discussions at meals, running errands, even in dreams (on my part!)t.  My wifes ease with math and science in general helped me, a non-techie long-time science fiction fan, understand and enjoy the material a lot more, too.  Highly recommended especially for the curious non-scientists interested in the cutting edge of astronomy!",1451779200,,1535,5.063492063492063
