8563449,4,B00B6SXJSU,"Don't look for any breathtaking acting (this seemed to me like a college honors project movie), but the story was sweet and entertaining enough for me to forgive the amateur acting.  I enjoyed the movie, and it was squeaky clean, so ANYONE could watch it, and it teaches some valuable lessons, I thought.  Be sure to watch the extras, too.  Patricia Binkley, the lady who plays Fannie, is a delightful person in the real life interview!",1427328000,,436,4.7105263157894735

8563452,5,B00B6SXJSU,"I was very impressed with Flowers For Fannie, Directed by Amazing Director Sharon Whlharm. This is a very good Christain movie, that I believe has a Great story and a wonderful message. Great for the whole family to watch. The  movie and the house that was used in the movie was soo beautiful and unique  and really added a lot to the film. The cast did an Amazing Job. I really loved how the chemistry for Fannie and Louise changed towards the ending of the film. Brittney Wilharm is a wonderful Actress and brought so much passion to her character. Her character was soo much fun to watch. The story was so Great and  had a wonderful ending. I highly recommend this movie as a great fun family movie For the Whole family.",1380240000,,723,4.421052631578948
8563453,5,B00B6SXJSU,"I was contacted by the Director/Screenwriter Sharon Wilharm to review Flowers For Fannie.  I am always on the lookout for great Faith Based movies so I said yes!

However, when it came, the back of the DVD case was a grave and the front of the DVD case was the two characters above, but with a graveyard in the back instead of clouds. I really like the DVD case above a lot better. I held on the to movie for a couple of weeks until I had time to watch it by myself without the boys interrupting.

I must confess, I didn't expect a lot out of the film. I was pleasantly surprised when, quite quickly, I was in love with Fannie and wanted a friend for her. The characters introduced as family, church members and people in town are all enchanting.

The settings are beautiful, an old time town with a square and old homes that are furnished beautifully. You really want to have an invite to Fannie's house for lunch.

I was really pulled into this story. I laughed, and was choked up, and delighted. I worried for a too sad ending - and was again, delightfully surprised with how they topped it off.

Set to be in stores in October 2013, I recommend this movie as an excellent feel good family film, suitable for all ages.
