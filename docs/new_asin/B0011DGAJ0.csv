8241410,5,B0011DGAJ0,A hard to find item that's getting more rare by the month  Very happy that my ten year old asked for it  Allowed me to relive some of my youth and share a laugh with the kids  Can't beat all that for the price!  The quality was acceptable especially when you consider this material is 50 years old.  And again--It wasn't what you could call expensive  Good value,1433980800,,362,4.25
8241411,1,B0011DGAJ0,This DVD was a lot of fun. It's a little hard to find. The music wasn't redone and the cartoons were great too. The disc was shipped promptly and was in great shape even though it was used. I'm very happy with it,1378080000,,212,3.953488372093023
