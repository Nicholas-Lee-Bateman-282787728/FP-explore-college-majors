8136664,5,B000H5UY8G,"It may get a little bit slow in the middle, but the beginning and ending episodes are quite entertaining and it all comes full circle in the end.  Really enjoyed it.",1400371200,,165,4.32258064516129
8136665,4,B000H5UY8G,"I loved these books when I was in my twenties.  I reread them recently, and like so many poems and novels, I find they have lost something for me with the passage of  the years. I have found that rereading something one loved in his twenties is usually a mistake.  However, they give a most interesting, and as I understand it, accurate picture of the life of the upper middle class in the Victorian age,  The action moves rather swiftly, the characters are very believable amd one emphasises with them, and the likable are suitably rewarded and the unlikable given their comeuppance. One really can't reasonably ask anything more than that from novels.",1370390400,3,653,4.752212389380531
8136666,4,B000H5UY8G,"I was a teenager when the first version of this trilogy was released back in the 1960's when Eric Porter and Nyrene Dawn Porter (not related) played the parts of Soames and Irene. I had missed this new version when it was broadcasted on PBS in the US and thought that it would be interesting to see how the new version compared. It was an excellent production (unfortunately the American company that sold me the DVD's sent me the wrong region). Gina McKee was not as beautiful, but very attractive, as the part required and that's maybe the because I thought Dawn Porter was stunning. She had to be something that Soames wanted desperately to own. Damien Lewis was excellent and they aged him well during the series much better than some of the other characters, his twitch when challenged fitted so well with his character. The other characters were excellently represented, especially Jolyon and Bossini.

In the time where Downton Abbey is becoming a classic series, this newer version of Forsyte Saga will do just nicely to fill in the time between Season 3 and 4 of Downton.",1357171200,8,1080,4.714285714285714
