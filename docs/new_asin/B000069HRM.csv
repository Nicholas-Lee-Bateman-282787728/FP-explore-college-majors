1732496,1,B000069HRM,"However ""great"" the acting may be, or how nicely/uniquely it is filmed, this series is basically a glorified soap opera.

I purchased it for my Australian husband, thinking that it would be an interesting piece of historical fiction.

Fiction, yes.  Historical, I doubt it.

The characters are so messed-up, and continually dig themselves deeper into the pit of scandal and despair.

FAMILIES BEWARE:

This is full of language, nudity, sexual scenes, adultery, and a GRAPHIC murder scene.  There are affairs, a disturbing story/secene of abortion, illegitimate pregnancy, etc.  We kept watching, hour after hour, expecting it to get better, or at least have some redeeming message.  ...But it just kept getting worse and more depressing - and more scandalous.

I really like Cate Blanchett, but even her character is a bit much to handle in this movie.  She is featured on the cover of the DVDs, but doesn't come into the picture until more than half way through.

I highly recommend the DVD series called ""Burned Bridge"" if you are looking for a very interesting and accurate glimpse into Australian/Aboriginal culture.  Cate Blanchett is also in this one and gives an outstanding performance, along with Ernie Dingo and the others.  Also, the film ""Rabbit Proof Fence"" is an incredible true story of Australian history.

I would NOT reccommend this (Bordertown) to any of my friends, family or acquaintances.  ...And I'm almost embarrassed to admit that I watched so many hours of it hoping for it to get better/more redeemimg.",1154649600,8,1529,5.080321285140562

7965620,5,B000069HRM,"Very underrated and missed by many when shown on TV this is now hard to find. Quintessential Aussie film. Quirky, witty, funny and with a shot of Cate's Bush, even if not in the natural color, somewhat full of surprises. This is actually a mini series showing what life was like for foreigners in migrant camps in Australia. Worth every penny if you can find a copy.",1408492800,,366,4.477611940298507

7965622,3,B000069HRM,"Bordertown is a ten-episode soap opera. It takes place in an Australian immigration camp in the years after World War 2, when some Europeans were leaving their fractured lives and communities in search of something better. The role of the camp, which is run by the government, appears to be to teach the immigrants some English and then place them in jobs, though the only jobs mentioned are blue collar. The immigrants live in a disused army barracks and amenities are minimal.

This could have been a very good series, but it lacks logic and focus to the extent that it's a complete mess. Some lack of logic can be forgiven. For example, it's necessary to have a number of continuing characters, not all staff, and it's not really explained why these immigrants aren't all moved on to the jobs they emigrated to get. But much of the lack of logic descends to absurdity.  For example, one character is married by proxy without his knowledge or permission, which seems highly unlikely. Three characters eventually get married while they are still legally married to other, living, spouses--and this is even mentioned explicitly.

As for lack of focus, there are numerous dramatic episodes but this series cannot decide how seriously to take them. The Italian men are stereotypical Latin lovers and fighters, and when they seduce and argue over each other's wives and girlfriends very loud bits of opera music are played in a clearly satirical manner. Yet it appears we are supposed to take at least one of these romances (involving two central characters) quite seriously and hang breathlessly on its resolution as the woman constantly flip-flops, refusing for almost the entire series to decide among her Italian lover, a more stable suitor, and the single career life. The longest, two-episode story is about a man who brutally and cold-bloodedly murders a staff member, a kind, innocent, though rather boring person who meant him no harm.  When this staff member goes missing, almost no one in the camp bothers to go on a search, when her corpse is discovered no one cares and they openly say so, and they all sign a petition for the Australian government for clemency for the murderer.  The worst storyline involves Cate Blanchett playing an Italian immigrant who is either genuinely nuts in a rather dangerous way, or pretending to be just to scare everyone.  Either way, her acting is absurdly over the top, though the awful script doesn't help. I also got the feeling that the series arc was not planned in advance, so that several main characters suddenly morph into very different people for no reason other than the convenience of the current episode.

Yet all this is intermixed with fairly probable and genuinely moving stories, such as the gradually revealed backstory of a Jewish woman and the otherwise incompatible husband who, though he barely knew her when she desperately sought his help, hid her from the Nazis till the end of the war. Best of all is the Scottish English teacher, played by Hugo Weaving, chronically depressed over his wife's death, his feelings of futility in teaching, and his health problems, yet able to make poetic Shakespearean speeches and genuinely witty sardonic remarks.  He's consistently wonderful. I almost kept this DVD because of his performance and the great dialog he was given.  But he still doesn't make up for all the flaws in this series.",1379894400,3,3396,4.923076923076923

7965625,4,B000069HRM,"Judge Gordon Sullivan, DVD Verdict-- Miniseries are generally, by their very nature, fairly epic undertakings. If viewers are going to invest five-plus hours in a story, they often demand that it cover some essential bit of history or cover important persons. Their epic nature often means that they can't (or won't) take the time to carefully draw individuals characters, preferring instead to weave numerous individuals into the pattern of history. Bordertown is interesting for trying to take the miniseries in a slightly different direction. It's got the epic setting down--the ""taming"" of the Australian Outback in the wake of WWII--and even the huge cast of characters. However, rather than trying to shove all of the characters into each episode, Bordertown generally gives us one self-contained plot per episode that focuses on a handful of Baringa's townspeople (though there are a few recurring plots). This gives viewers a chance to get to know these diverse people while still getting a strong sense of what's going on at that moment in history. Bordertown also departs from a number of miniseries by changing up its tone depending on the story, including the tragedy of dealing with the mentally ill to the goofiness of the local English professor.

Bordertown is an interesting miniseries that tackles a generally overlooked moment in Australian history. With high production values and a cast of excellent actors, the show will likely be compelling to fans of dramatic miniseries or the actors. However, for those drawn in by the promise of Hugo Weaving or Cate Blanchett, know that their screen time is fairly minimal against the nine hours of this miniseries.

7965626,3,B000069HRM,"Australian series about European immigrants living in the military baracks shortly after WWII.  They all come from different countries and they all have personal story to tell.  First half of the series focuses on telling each character's story, while the last few episodes try to kill them off from the plot.

Most amaizing performace is guest appearance by Cate Blanchett, who portrays albino italian immigrant bethroted to the mentally challanged Italian man.  Her character is so conflicted and controversial that it is difficult to love her or hate her as a human being - but she is absolutely fantastic in the role that is exploration is deep feelings of loneliness, disappointment, sadness and knowledge that being ""different"" physically or otherwise can easily make an individual the unwilling outcast in any society.

These series were made long time ago and in today's portrayals of political correctness they are certainly controversial.",1235606400,6,948,5.3355704697986575
