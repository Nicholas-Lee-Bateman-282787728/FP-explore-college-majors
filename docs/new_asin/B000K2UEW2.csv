8154119,5,B000K2UEW2,"The Grant Austin Collection is one of the best instructional DVD's sold at Amazon. The other series is the Joe Baker DVD's. This DVD is 1 hour 16 minutes long.
The instruction is slow enough for a beginner. Only at the very end does the difficulty move towards advanced. On this DVD there are the same patterns that one will learn at a dance studio. Any instructional dance DVD is only a supplement to a dance instructor, a group class, or a swing club. I found these DVD's good as an addition to private instructors, group classes, and the local swing club.
This review is for West Coast Swing Volume One, but ALL of the Grant Austin Collection is wonderful. At first he goes slow, but as one becomes more advanced, the moves up the pace. I have purchased almost all of his DVD's. There is enough material on West Coast Swing series to last for years. I have been studying various West Coast DVD's for two years. I have been dancing West Coast Swing for three years. I found these DVD' to be a great review of what I learned at the dance classes.
