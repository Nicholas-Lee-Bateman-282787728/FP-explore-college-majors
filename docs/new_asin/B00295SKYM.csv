3876392,4,B00295SKYM,"I remember religiously watching Joe Schmo 1 and 2 weekly on SpikeTV. I bought the first DVD set as soon as it came out as I have this one. I give the show 5 stars, I also love how they included the 90 minute episode that was advertised to air but was cut down to a hour. My only complaint is the quality of the episodes aren't so great. I would compare it to watching a Vhs tape of the show recorded on the fastest speed. Actually that may look better than what we have here because there's a lot of digital artifacts and distortion such as a green halo around the skin of anyone in the lightest shadow.
Show: 5 stars
Quality: 2 stars
Overall: 4 stars seems fair right? ok maybe not but I love this show and glad to have it all together on dvd.",1247788800,5,744,4.033783783783784
3876393,5,B00295SKYM,"This show is excellent. I purchased Joe Schmo 1 several years ago and have been eagerly awaiting Joe Schmo 2 ever since.
Both seasons are worth every penny!",1247788800,,156,4.607142857142857
3876394,4,B00295SKYM,"As an editor for an online website about television, I was sent a screener of ""Joe Schmo 2"" before it aired on Spike TV. I was highly impressed by the show, having already enjoyed the first season of the program. Seeing the series as it arrived on TV, I delighted in the program, but was dismayed by the poor treatment of the program by Spike TV.

""Joe Schmo 2"" takes what happened in the original program and raises it to the next level. This program gets more outrageous, more original and more fun the first one even did and that one was pretty great. Watch for characters such as Bryce, the crazed stalker and Gerald, the gotta-be-gay guy. All are performing for Joe and Jane Schmo (Tim Walsh and Ingrid Wiese), the only two who think that it's all real. However, as the early portion of the show continues, it soon becomes very clear that Ingrid is having major difficulty believing that it is all real. What will happen and how will it affect the show?

Closed-Captioning/Subtitles - None (Very Disappointing)
Uncensored and Unbleeped - Yes (Warning: Contains material suitable for mature audiences only)
Special Features: Full Length Episode 4 ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" featuring scenes of Matt Kennedy Gould not shown on Spike TV, Full Length Finale featuring content not shown on Spike TV

Rating: 4 1/2 stars-- Very pleased with just about everything, but I get edgy when there's no closed-captioning or subtitles-- I see no excuse for not having them. I know this set is cheap, the price can't be beat, but I would have paid a bit more to have them.",1247702400,6,1565,4.663043478260869
3876395,5,B00295SKYM,Finally!! I have been literally waiting for years for this to come out on DVD. Absolutely hands down one of the funniest shows I have ever seen.,1247702400,,144,4.37037037037037
3876396,5,B00295SKYM,"The second season was definitely superior to the first in every way.  The ridiculous lampooning of just about every reality show standard is fantastically done: alliances, stupid contests for ""immunity"" and of course the way-too-self-important immunity ceremony.  The stereotypes that REAL reality shows always seem to choose, are all here in hilarious fashion.  Not to spoil anything... but there is one moment with a falcon (yes, a real falcon) that is, I swear... the funniest thing I have ever seen on television!  Thank you Spike for FINALLY releasing this comedic gem!  HIGHLY recommended!",1246320000,8,595,5.354838709677419
3876397,5,B00295SKYM,"Been waiting for this for ages. Now I can chuck my VHS copies. Fantastic series and yes better than the 1st. The Schmos (yes 2 this time round) are both different and still enjoyable to follow. There's a great unexpected development in this that forced the producers to scramble but they pull through with flying colours. The fake show goes so far you will kill yourself laughing that ANYONE could buy it.

It's edgy and a bit naughty without being too over the top. You'll chuckle at the more racy innuendo than you will squirm.

I just hope we get the 90 min version of the one ep that ended up getting cut to a mere 60 by the network at the last minute.",1242777600,3,656,4.282258064516129

You'd never think a show with a gimmick like this - poor schmoe is set up on a fake reality show - would ever get a second season, but it did and it was even better than the first one.

3876402,3,B00295SKYM,"I loved the first season of Joe Schmo. I watched it on TV as a teenager. More recently I watched season 3 which I also enjoyed. I decided since I had not seen season 2 I should get to watching it. I would have to say that season 2 is the worst of the 3. It's still entertaining and I did enjoy it, but's it's just disappointing compared to the other seasons. The DVD packaging on this set is also subpar. The DVDs are just in little envelopes inside the plastic case. For some reason my DVD player was making a weird buzzing/grinding noise while playing these. This has never happened to me before, or since then. The DVDs all played fine, I'm still stumped on why they made my player make odd noises.",1409097600,,701,4.2388059701492535

3876404,5,B00295SKYM,"Not near as good as Joe Schmo Season 1 (Go and buy it if you haven't seen it!!), but this show is very funny and interesting.  Now that reality tv has taken up over 50% of the cable television landscape, this show makes you appreciate how funny and great it can be!

DVD is standard def and letterbox so don't expect high quality resolution, but the show is fun and funny despite the lack of great visual quality.",1404432000,,413,4.282051282051282
3876405,3,B00295SKYM,"As a whole, it wasn't even close to being as good as season 1, but it had some classic moments. If you liked season 1, or if you just started watching this show in its 3rd season, you have to watch this.

The dvd case is what made me give this a 3 star rating, and not a 4. The case is too thick for what little is inside. The 2 discs are in flimsy paper disc holders. For those of you who have bought the cheaper, newer seasons box sets of shows like That 70's Show or Roseanne, it's like that.",1397779200,,495,3.8529411764705883
3876406,5,B00295SKYM,"It's been over a year since I watched this DVD, but I remember absolutely loving it. I remember being particularly impressed with the original Jane schmo, and her mind, being able to question things that seemed out of place. That's something that I always try to do, so I really liked that about her. It was just a great show, and I should probably re watch it.",1397692800,,361,4.402985074626866
3876407,5,B00295SKYM,"What more is there to say?  This season isn't QUITE as good as the first, only because the guy Matt who was the schmo was the perfect dude to anchor things.  The guy in this one is a little more dopey but the two women are good...and the one who keeps figuring things out is a lot of fun and that really made the show different than the first, where Matt took everything at face value.  She is SMART!  Great show!",1394928000,,413,4.061728395061729
3876408,5,B00295SKYM,it is definitely a different feel from the first but all of the same craziness! Matt Gould even makes a cameo as a pizza delivery guy!,1393804800,,134,4.1923076923076925
3876409,5,B00295SKYM,"Very funny series with the twist of TWO JOE SCHMO'S instead of one as in the first season. However, will it be possible to fool BOTH? That's what you find out out in this second season series.",1386720000,,192,4.216216216216216
3876410,5,B00295SKYM,"Season 1 was very good but Season 2 was nothing short of excellent.  So many great characters...Bryce the Stalker, Gerald with a hard ""G"", T.J. the Playa, dimwitted Cammy...even host Derek Newcastle.  Awesome acting all around.  Didn't like the Joe and Jane Schmo's as much as the first season's ""Joe"", but that's a small deduction for me.

This was truly one of the funniest shows I've ever seen, and getting it for an EXTREMELY LOW price (especially compared to what Season 1 is selling for) makes this one a no-brainer.  The entire season for less than the price of seeing one movie.  Great value!",1382659200,,600,4.721153846153846
3876411,5,B00295SKYM,"I got this dvd because I couldn't find it on netflix or anywhere and I was a fan of the first season as well as the third that just played on spike. This show is silly and over the top and a lot of fun to watch. Definitely worth checking out and for what it goes for on amazon, its worth buying.",1377475200,,295,3.774193548387097
3876412,5,B00295SKYM,Funniest reality show EVER. I'm watching it right now with two people new to the show and they love it. I've introduced several people to this show through these DVDs. Great purchase!,1376006400,,183,4.75
3876413,3,B00295SKYM,Worth watching once.  I probably won't watch it again but for the price it can not be beat for entertainment.,1373155200,,109,4.45
3876414,4,B00295SKYM,Pretty fun to watch. Not as good as season 1 in my opinion but still a pretty funny show overall.,1370476800,,97,3.9
3876415,3,B00295SKYM,"The premise is simple. Two Schmos are on a Bachelor/ette type reality competing for the affections of Austin and Piper.  Little do they know, everyone on the show other than them, is an actor.  The stereotypical reality show contestants surround them (the player, the schemer, the weirdo) and they're put in increasingly ridiculous situations to see how they'll react.

The good: Gerald (hard G), Bryce, Ralph Garman, Ingrid, Amanda, Piper and Austin, Cami.
The bad: TIIIIIIMMMMMMMMMMMM, TJ, the other background characters, pork and beans.

I liked Ingrid. I really did. But Tim was absolutely unlikeable. He was a pig.  The producers tried very hard to make him likeable but he just wasn't and it made it hard to really care what he was thinking or what happened to him.

The Bryce story line was fantastic - Montecore and the frog and ""mockingbird"" had me rolling on the floor.
Cami was a great character but I really didn't need to see the pork and beans clip a dozen times.

I dunno. I was super excited when this came out on dvd but I quickly remembered that it wasn't near the quality of the first show. I'll watch Joe Schmo 3 but hopefully the amount of time since the last one has given the producers a little perspective.",1369699200,,1231,4.671296296296297
3876416,4,B00295SKYM,"Not as innovative or interesting as Season 1, and not as risky or thought-provoking as Season 3, this season of the Joe Schmo Show was still solid.  And a little cruel.",1366848000,,168,4.419354838709677
3876417,5,B00295SKYM,This show is the best. If you like laughing till you cry I would get this. Sine I bought it I've watched it several times and still find it hilarious.,1364083200,,150,4.033333333333333
3876418,3,B00295SKYM,"The first season was much better in my opinion. Season 2 was based on a ""bachelor"" show type situation that never really seemed to get moving. First one of the contestants figures out the show is a setup right away, and they end up having to get a replacement and let the original contestant join the 'cast' side of things. The drama is often not entertaining, and the episodes are long for the entertainment value. Season 3 just came out and is by far the BEST of the series, but its more expensive by far to own. This is a good cheap DVD if you are a fan of the series and didn't see the second season already.",1363910400,,612,4.194915254237288

3876420,5,B00295SKYM,"I really don't care for the ""reality"" shows based on finding love- as someone who has fallen into the black hole for a few weeks and watched them a few times.  This show hilariously captures and spoofs the things I find ridiculous about them.  I also enjoyed the stakes being upped by adding a second ""Schmo"".  I enjoyed every bt of this ultimate prank.",1362355200,,353,4.484375
3876421,5,B00295SKYM,"At under $6 with no tax or shipping (the price I paid from amazon at the time) this is one of the best values I can ever remember.

It's true that there are no bells and whistles. For the price that's not to be expected. What you do get though is uncut episodes of one of the funniest and well-executed concepts I've ever seen. Nearly ten years later a friend of mine and I still laugh about certain aspects like the pearl necklaces or Montecore the falcon.

Perhaps it's a testament to how good this season was that the third season (which is currently airing) has been a pretty big disappointment in comparison.

Buy it, and if you don't like it then it's proof that you have no soul.",1361491200,,686,4.3023255813953485

3876423,4,B00295SKYM,"Prior to making the purchase, I figured that the quality of the video and sound was going to be sub-par, and I was correct.  Luckily, this show is dialogue-driven and doesn't need all of the super duper sounds and picture that the average movie requires.  Having seen the show when it first aired, I knew what I was getting and even with the cases plus two sleeves and two discs and shoddy sound, it was still totally worth it to me.  I am happy with my purchase and would recommend it to any fan of any of the Joe Schmo shows.",1359676800,2,527,4.198019801980198
3876424,5,B00295SKYM,"Such a funny show! I was so glad this came out on DVD. Basically this is a reality tv series, but with a twist. There are 2 people that ""think"" that they are in a real reality tv show for love. Everyone else is an actor. The producers try to see just how much they can get away with without pushing it over the limit of unbelievability. Will the 2 people (Schmo's) being fooled, figure it out before the end or will they go along with the crazy love show?

If anyone has seen Joe Schmo, this is exactly the same, but this time, with 2 people that think it's all real.",1358035200,,567,4.0625
3876425,5,B00295SKYM,"I literally just watched this on-demand for free on my cable box.  I loved it!  I wanted to see if they had a DVD with extra features or scenes and interviews.  I wasn't planning on buying it unless it was a really decent price.  Well the price is so low I have no choice but to buy it.  Probably will only watch the special features and then tuck it away and watch it again in a year or two, but for the price ($5.35!!!) I had to get it now!

If you haven't seen this show and like the idea behind it..and are not turned off by over the top sexual innuendos and crude jokes, you will enjoy it.  If you notice the one bad review didn't like that aspect of the show.  So that should be your gauge. I normally don't like the ""cheap"" sex joke type stuff but in this faux reality show setting it's just hilarious!  I literally laughed out loud when the had the first ""Pearl Necklace"" Ceremony!  Trust me, this is well worth it!  And the drama is there to as one ""Schmo"" starts to get wise to the con!  Just a great show. I hope there is alot of bonus scenes and interviews but at this price I'd buy it anyway.",1357776000,,1105,4.04147465437788
3876426,5,B00295SKYM,"I didn't expect season 2 of this show to be that great, espically since bearly anyone talked about it. After viewing it I was pleasantly surprised. This season ended up being very entertaining. The cast, while bigger and more like a bunch of people instead of big characters, helped carry the show in many aread. These schmo's seemed to click with the cast better and real friendships seemed to be forming, both in and out of character. Twists of the season were interesting and shook things up, making the show feel more like an improvization rather then following a script. I was surprised at how much story, personality and humor were in each episode and I feel I got more out of this season. Also the humor was better as this season really was about each actors personality rather then just outlasting everyone.

However there are some gripes I've got with this. Personally I think Austin isn't the prime example to be offered as a suitor, even though only one person needs to believe that. SPOILER ALERT FOR THE OTHERS, The bringing back of three different people was annoying for me, because of the reasons. First person is fine. Second person, didn't make any sense. Austin asked for someone back so Piper gets one back also. The third person is ok but, it had been done so many times I wished they had done that part differently. Finally when the women Schmo's are awarded their prizes, I feel they shouldn't have gotten the complete 100 grand. They should've gotten about 75 each, (Amanda because she wasn't there the whole time, and Ingrid because she was an actor for bitts of it, still helpful and great for the show but not worthy of all 100).

Still I enjoyed this and I can't compare the seasons as there is reasons to like and not like each of them. I'm hopeing season 3 continues the trend and that Ralph isn't in as ridiculous of a disquise.",1356998400,,1859,4.57957957957958
3876427,1,B00295SKYM,"I liked Joe Schmo 1 when it first came out on TV.  I hadn't seen Joe Schmo 2, so I thought I would order it for some light comedy.

Joe Schmo 2 was not nearly as funny as the original.  Season 2 relies too heavily on raunchy situations rather than character interaction as the main vehicle to try to get a cheap laugh.

The DVD set was delivered quickly and had no defects so the seller's performance was good - but I just didn't like the content.",1356480000,2,447,4.103448275862069
3876428,5,B00295SKYM,"Look, the first thing you need to know is that zero care was put into the presentation of this set. Aside from the bring and cheery cover art, the box itself is oversized, yet doesn't have a second disc ray. The second disc comes in a paper sleeve. Lame. However, I love this particular season of this show. It's a laugh riot and you'll find yourself talking about 'Falcon twists' decades later! The picture quality is bad also, but the fact is they aren't going to go back and remaster it. it is what it is. Just great comedy!",1354492800,,527,4.333333333333333
3876429,3,B00295SKYM,"Season 1 of the Joe Schmo Show was funny, smart, and done extremely well..  The problem with Season 2 is that it feels so empty.  The editing is terrible - - and while it does feel like one of those really bad Reality Shows, it actually becomes one.

Even though you know that the actors are in on it, you very rarely get their opinoins via talking heads like you got in the first one, so you don't care about them at all.  And they refer to events you never got to see...For example, one of the characters had lost something for days which affected them immensely, and we only find out about it in flashbacks when the conflict comes to a climax.  Even on the unedited DVD!  That is TERRIBLE editing and directing!!

Season 2 is also missing the charm Season 1 exuded.  You don't really get to see the ""schmos"" in their natural setting, just hanging out with the other characters, so you have no clue what kind of relationships they have with them.  It is shot so surfacely, that you just don't care whether they find out or not.

The one great thing about this Season is that the story is really interesting.  The only reason I continued watching is because I loved the twists and turns the show took throughout.  The writers and actors seem to be the only ones doing their jobs on this one.  All the actors were phenomenal and their characters were really fleshed out...It's just a shame that the editors refused to show them enough.

All in all, this Season is fine...Watch it for the story!!  But a BIG disappointment compared to Season 1.",1354233600,,1543,4.421985815602837
3876430,5,B00295SKYM,"This reality show DOESN'T annoy me because first off and most of all, it is both a reality show and a parody of reality shows in general.  Only 2 real people in the house, the rest populated by actors acting like reality show contestants.

So much well calculated fun weaved throughout the whole show.  Twists, turns, and lots of fun throughout.

The series was so much fun, that while I was able to watch it as it aired, I actually called in to work once or twice to watch it while it aired, since it conflicted with my work schedule.

The DVDs I got had some minor differences from the as-aired version.  Most, if not all, of the language censoring was removed.  Also one episode that aired as a 60-minute (with commercial breaks) episode had additional material added back such that were it aired with commercials, it would have been a 90 minute episode.  All the added back material was great for filling in information that I was curious about when it aired but just wasn't critical to the story.

This show (when aired) caused me to have sufficient love of the show that I was willing to buy, without knowing anything about the previous season, to risk spending $30 at Walmart (at the time) for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Joe-Schmo-Show-Season-One-Uncensored/dp/B0001XAODO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Joe Schmo Show - Season One Uncensored</a>, which is also a great viewing experience.",1307404800,,1447,5.175965665236052

3876432,5,B00295SKYM,"This is just as good as, if not better than Joe Schmo season 1.  The stuff that the writers put into this show is nothing short of hilarious.  Some of the best characters on this season were Cammy the moron, Bryce the stalker, and Eleanor the weeper (whom I thought deserved an Emmy award).  We also get to see the return of the host from the first season, but with a phony British accent.  Though the concept of this season is slightly different than the first season (having 2 Schmo's, and a different game), it is even better to watch 2 people wade through the over dramatic writing that has been put in place.  I do not want to ruin this season for anyone who has not seen it, but for the price, it is well worth the laughs that it gives.  I would recommend this to anyone who liked Joe Schmo season one, or anyone who thinks the reality tv we are over loaded with is losing it's luster (or never had any).",1265760000,3,910,4.2011494252873565

They managed to pull it off and it is just non-stop HILARITY.  YES, they pushed the limits of believeability but in doing so, gave a big fat finger to all the ""real"" reality shows and the BS cliche's.

I have the first series on DVD and watch it often.  I swear, if you really think about it, JS1 could almost be a semester psyhcology class experiment but one that psychologists could not do ethically.  Ironically what can't be done as a psychological study is easy fodder for a reality show.

There is NO COMPARISON between Joe Shmo 1 and 2.  They are SO DIFFERENT, I can't even think of an analogy to compare the 2. I think they are BOTH ingenious in their own way.

I guess you could say that #1 was a little ""deeper"" while #2 reminds me more of the ball-busting laughs I had when I saw Porky's for the first time.

to sum it up, I LOVE IT!!

Recently, I was wandering around a department store and saw this set for $5.  I have been hoping to get the first series, which I liked a lot, at a low price but have never found really discounted.  So I thought for five bucks for the complete second season, I would pick it up.  And I am very glad I did!

I am writing this on a Saturday afternoon, and this morning, I decided to just put it in, jump to the last episode and see how it turns out.  Well, something happened I didn't expect.  I truly enjoyed it and got hooked.  So I went back to the very first episode and, honestly, didn't stop until I came to the last episode again.  I just couldn't stop watching it until I got in all the episodes.  I was supposed to run a number of errands today and go out to see an afternoon movie.  I didn't get any of that done because it was almost 5 pm when I finished watching.  This is the equivalent of a book you can't put down.

The cast is wonderful.  The plotting enjoyable.  And just the right length.  And lots of language that I am sure never got aired.

3876436,3,B00295SKYM,"This show has such a great concept. Regualar people thrown on a fake TV show with fake people, and everyone know but them. This season however was not even close to the first.

I really don't understand all the people comparing this season to season 1. There really is no comparison. Season 1 was FAR superior to season 2. I'm pretty sure if you're looking to buy this one you've seen season 1 though, so you'd still want it, maybe to finish your collection or just because you haven't seen it, but again, not even close to season 1.",1257206400,,533,4.383838383838384
3876437,4,B00295SKYM,"Having watched this when it was first on, I can really appreciate it finally coming to DVD.  It has no extras, save for scenes that were originally cut out.  (The scene with the first Joe Schmo, Matt Gould, was cut out of the TV airings.)  It should be noted that the language is not censored; the ""f-bomb"" is quite frequently, so you may not want to watch it with people that might be offended by that kind of language.  It should be noted that this season did not show as much female skin as the first.

I liked the male lead in this season, Tim, more than I did Matt of Season 1, who was a nice guy but needed to ""man up"" sometimes.

I must refute a claim made on the cover, which said the final episode never aired.  I remember quite clearly that it did err, although some parts might have been added to it.  After a couple of episodes the show only aired after WWE RAW, when the first couple of episodes were aired at a different timeslot which then were repeated after RAW.  Still, a very fun show.",1249344000,,1004,4.1875
3876438,4,B00295SKYM,"I've been waiting for this to reach DVD for years, it's one of the funniest shows I've seen. The DVD is absolutely worth buying, the show itself is a must own, and they did give us the 90 minute episodes that were promised, but whittled down when it was originally broadcast.

But, they had five years to work on this, I wish they had put out a higher priced DVD version with special features for the fans. I would love to know what Tim, Ingrid, and Amanda are up to now. Did Tim ever get his bar? Did he really give all the money to charity? What did Ingrid and Amanda do with the money? What's going on with all the actors now? A commentary track with any of the people from the show that wanted to participate would be appreciated.

But if this is all the studio was willing to spring for, then at least we get to own a great show. I know a lot of people prefer the first season because they loved Matt so much. I liked him too, but I really preferred Tim and Amanda, he was really funny, and she is just so adorable. I have to say, the Bryce character is reason enough to watch this show, the actor did a great job portraying a crazy stalker. Tim's reactions to him are hysterical.

I had to deduct a star because of the lack of special features, but I highly reccomend this DVD.

P.S.: If anybody from the production company happens to read this, I'm sure I speak for all the fans of this show, I would happily double dip if you ever put out another version of this DVD loaded with special features!",1248393600,2,1504,4.175862068965517

8357625,5,B00295SKYM,"I don't watch any reality TV shows (unless you count Britain's Bake-Off??) - none - and I LOVED this show. It is a perfect send-up of the genre... hilarious but compassionate too. Very very very funny - but you don't feel like they're taking advantage (too much) of the ""real"" contestants. They really are the winners in the end!! I can't recommend it enough - and have given it as gifts multiple times (and those people went on to give it as gifts... it's that funny!).

One note - Schmo 2 is by FAR the best season. I would *not* recommend starting this show at the beginning - start with Season 2, then watch Season 3, then if you really really want to, go back and watch Season 1. Season 1 was Spike TV at it cheesiest, sexist worst - plus the producers learned a lot of lessons in Season 1 which they used to great advantage in the following seasons. Schmo 2 is the best of the bunch by far, though. Long live the Falcon Twist!",1509580800,,932,4.265536723163842

Little did I realize this is simply because the DVD version itself is poor. Honestly, it looks like an old VHS taping or something, jittery lines on the screen and everything. It's a good show nontheless but if I am buying the DVD, I expect better quality than this.",1440288000,,390,4.144736842105263
