3747400,3,B001PJRATE,"Admittedly, I think Ryder has found a niche for what she can convey professionally now. Between this and Sex & Death 101, she performs the stalker/scary girl quite well. Wes Bentley has always had that squint/scowl look, but his emotions were better parlayed in Ghost Rider than anything of note here.

This bizarre story of an unlikely poet writing suicide notes for clients gets injected with the VERY recently grieving cuckoo girl played by Winona. Through the coarse of his drab existence and her drunken acting, a strange bond develops built upon lies and bad dates. Ray Ramano plays one of his clients, but for his fans I would watch Eulogy again before this.

The picture is adequate and the grain/artifact is sparse. The DTS gets utilized rarely, maybe some sublime background sounds and one night club dance scene. Ray gets one good line, 47:05 is the only laugh out loud scene (can't write it) and the ending reminiscent of Office Space makes for the few good moments in an otherwise dreary film.

Playing it in the store attracted no one to it, and the flurry of misplaced F bombs are the only reason for the R rating. I would say the casting was done well for an inconsequential film, and I would stick with watching the other films I listed here if these actors are your favorites. The 10 minutes of deleted scenes and the Blu quality do not make this much of an owner, but probably a decent rental on a Sunday night.",1240012800,,1430,4.6
3747401,3,B001PJRATE,"""The Last Word"" tells the improbable story of a standoffish suicide-note writer (Wes Bentley) falling in love with the sister (Winona Ryder) of one of his clients. The more she learns about him, the more she likes him--until she discovers what he does for a living. The best performance in the movie comes from Ray Romano (and I've never been a huge fan of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"") as a prospective client who works doing background music for schools.

If you can get past the improbability of the basic premise, there is much to enjoy in this movie. Bentley makes his character believable (as much as any one person could), and Ryder gives a lively performance. A good rental with a Sundance pedigree.",1239667200,18,704,4.770491803278689
3747436,4,B001PJRATE,"Romantic comedy??? Perhaps a romantic dark comedy without too much romance or comedy...although I did find myself laughing a few times. Wes Bently stars as Evan Merak, an aloof person with his own issues. He professionally composes suicide notes like a Russian novelist. He attends the funerals of those who actually go through with the deed, mostly to hear and critique his own composure read out loud.

While attending a funeral he meets the moody Charlotte (Winona Ryder) the sister of a victim. They end up dating. Evan tries to keep his specific relationship with her brother a secret and lies to Charlotte. Charlotte is comparatively unsophisticated, and like Winona she thinks a good date is one that doesn't try to ""steal my credit card."" (One of my several LOL moments.) In one early scene at a diner she has on no make-up or jewelry then in the next scene she is driving Evan home from said diner and has on her painted face as well as wearing pearls...something she wears later on in the film...Geoffrey Haley,another Ed Wood academy graduate. Here's your card.

While Evan is trying to keep things a secret, he is aiding other clients which raises Charlotte's curiosity level. You wait for the climax scene when he confesses everything to her. Decent film for quirky indie lovers.

F-bomb (thank you Winona), no on screen sex or nudity",1337558400,4,1347,4.822510822510822
3747437,1,B001PJRATE,This is the worst movie I have ever seen Winona Ryder have a part in.  It seems to me that about every one word spoken starts with an F.  The writers of this movie must have a street language background.  And the movie is just not believable - I wasted my money on it.  Don't waste yours.  I ended up throwing this movie in my dumpster when I finished watching it.,1331078400,,364,4.070422535211268

3747441,3,B001PJRATE,"The movie opens rather promisingly and the main character has an interesting character arc throughout the movie, but the ending nullifies anything that might've made an important statement about anything. This is truly a shame.",1265500800,2,227,5.514285714285714
3747442,5,B001PJRATE,"Another excellent production from ThinkFilms, where the past is dragged along as the future becomes epigrammatic and silent.

Evan (Wes Bentley) chances to earn a modest living writing suicide notes for clients who no longer have the desire or the strength to live. His poetry is in dissonance with his imperturbable and aloof demeanor, which deadens the aura of every frame he is involved in, even the more erotic and moving. However the plot hits a high note when Charlotte catches a glimpse of him at her brother's funeral, whose suicide note was authored by Evan. She does not become acquainted with the nature of Evan's poetic engagements and amid strife and guilt becomes endeared and ultimately enamored with the numb introspective intellectually brooding Evan. Charlotte - here played by Winona Ryder with effortless wit and sophistication, teeming with energy and spontaneity - chases after Evan, for what initially seems to be a means of making amends and an effective way to grieve, only to eventuate into a full-blown passionate love affair which Evan fails to repel intent on keeping his stoic persona, for his resolve is overwhelmed by the appeal of his ex-client's beauty and joy de vivre, her flair and her impulsive absorption into a life she is emotionally engaged in, and one which, to the contrary, Evan distrusts and lives only at a distance, removed from the exuberance it excites in Charlotte.

Matters are further complicated as Evan befriends a client (Ray Romano), whose honest pitiful and cynic character offers many of the laughs in this production amid the torture of a numbness that echoes in the hollow inner lives of the prospective suicides.
We increasingly become aware of the pain Evan has been repressing and silencing and the cathartic effects he gleans from his sinister job. Amid quotes of terrifying darkness, and an emotional vacuum we find the impetuous Charlotte and the humor-twisted friend-client wrest Evan from the lull of his life which implodes when threatened by a thief with words reminiscent of his abusive father's violence. The cold and detached protagonist is played to perfection by Bentley whose acting style lends him agreeably to such roles.

The writing is extraordinary, on par with Being John Malkovich and The Eternal Sunshine, but the directing is rather impervious to the brooding feel of the movie, and tends to contrast with the dark comedy which opportunely offers relief and gut wrenching laughter. Sinister but philosophically deep, eloquent and scintillating whenever Ryder is on the set, we become stirred and jolted as we recognize how emotionally retarded human beings are and how much pain must be suppressed to live as socially integrated human creatures. The end sizzles with raw energy and emits an overcharged tone of loss and redemption deadened just enough to dispel despair, blunted by the sterility of a love affair that spurs Evan to new horizons however hopeless and alienated from desire they may be. The quiet remains and pierces deepest when Charlotte turns her back on an affair that is impossible, unhealthy and warped. The acting and the script make this an exceptional viewing, if only the directing was as able we'd have a masterpiece.
This production, is described indelibly in one of Evan's note, where we linger on drifting away from memory's shore...",1243296000,13,3347,5.092896174863388
3747443,3,B001PJRATE,"This is one of those movies that had huge potential. The story line was (yes, improbable, but so is every other movie out there) unique and interesting, with great building tension, superb conflict, and a very satisfying conclusion. The problem with this movie was the cast. Wes Bentley's character was wooden and emotionless, and even though his background justified those traits, they are not very ""showy"" in a visual way. I would have preferred that the part was played with more obvious suppressed emotion, more internal conflict expressed via body language; instead, he appears 2-dimensional and therefore unbelievable. I could not muster any feelings for him, good or bad. Also, Winona Ryder's acting could have been much better. I've seen her in other movies and she's good; this movie seemed like her first rodeo, and her out-of-character movements and expressions kept jerking me out of the story instead of helping me stay immersed in it.

I think Hollywood should give it a couple of years, and then re-do this movie with some top-notch actors. It would be a blockbuster! and it would have more comedic effect in the right hands, too. The humorous lines in the movie were squandered by all but Ray Romano.",1241222400,2,1216,4.96078431372549
3747444,5,B001PJRATE,This quirky film hit on so many levels. Ray Romano gave a great peformance. It had a perfect combination of comedy and tragedy and pulled through at the last second for a great ending. A cult classic for sure!,1240963200,4,209,4.384615384615385
3747445,4,B001PJRATE,"I don't know why ThinkFilm decided not to distribute this film in theaters. It's a quirky, funny, dark, romantic comedy. Wes Bentley and Ray Romano inject the perfect amount of sadness into their roles. Winona Ryder gives a spirited and lively performance. I thought it was well written, despite being slightly predictable. I was glad I saw it.",1240444800,4,344,4.948275862068965

8333409,4,B001PJRATE,"I won't repeat the basic premise that others have shared, instead I'll add a couple aspects I haven't seen others mention yet:  First of all -- I noted a bit of a nod to the classic ""Harold and Maude""  (""Harold and Maude"" is the better love story)  The lead character Evan (played by Wes Bentley) has a similar focus on death. He has made it not only his life's work, but his calling. He has internalized all and does not share anything about himself.  Enter Charolotte (played by Winona Ryder) -- who DOES express her feelings, directly and immediately.  There's a GOOD combining of opposites here that can be gratifying.  ......  THERE is a scene near the end in which Evan's emotions come to the surface suddenly and explosively.  Suffice it to say, his history (which was lightly shared), certainly has been locked tightly inside since childhood.  I wished for more of the psychological payoff.  Overall I enjoyed it and would watch it again.  A dark comedy that I wish had just a dollop more heart.",1441065600,,1003,4.642045454545454
8333410,4,B001PJRATE,"Good movie, I liked it. It was well written and acted, a lot of people have issues I guess, some more than others. Kind of a surprise ending in a way, not a bad way. Just moving on I guess.",1437609600,,189,3.75

8333412,5,B001PJRATE,"First of all I want to say that movie I liked enough but should also add that it is not a movie for everyone.
The main character is not the typical protagonist.
Quiet, intelligent, cultured, introverted and very quiet, (even depressive), with a somewhat particular work.
Writes the latest words of future suicide that they hire their services.
Here come into play a new customer (very special) and a girl (sister of his latest ""client) and is now the skein of trouble.
She is contrary to him, cheerful, outgoing, full of life.
Wes Bentley's character is truly a delight.
Winona is correct in her lively character.
Very good performances with a good script, makes this ""last word'' a film highly recommended, although it is not for everyone.
Here comes the only negative part, this has a very foul language at certain times.
Recommended.",1398124800,,836,4.853146853146853
8333413,4,B001PJRATE,"Everyone does a great job in this movie, and the movie itself avoids the usual formulas without seeming to try too hard to do so.",1388620800,,129,4.2
8333414,5,B001PJRATE,"Evan (Wes Bentley), an apparently unemotional introvert who appears to lack any feelings, makes his living writing suicide notes. He also likes to attend the funerals of those who have used his services. This is where he meets Charlotte (Winona Ryder), the attractive sister of one of his clients. Having no idea as to his connection with her brother, she becomes fascinated with him and eventually romantically passionate about him. While he resists her advances for quite some time, eventually he succumbs and they become romantically involved, that is, until she discovers what he does for a living as well as his connection with her brother while going through his papers at his apartment.

Comic relief is provided by a client (played by Ray Romano) who thinks he wants to commit suicide but never finds what Evan writes for him satisfactory because, well, he has too much to live for to commit suicide just yet.

Although the premise that someone would be able to make a living writing suicide notes is implausible, if you can get beyond this, it's a great movie. Evan's transformation from a complete and misanthropic introvert to a person with passion and character as he becomes romantically involved with Charlotte is entirely believable and really quite charming.",1378944000,2,1274,5.033175355450237
8333415,5,B001PJRATE,"Winona Ryder is great in this film, as is Wes Bentley. What really caught me was the way downtown LA is the backdrop for the story along with a couple of other interesting LA neighborhoods. Downtown has always struck me as a vast wasteland and an easy place to get lonely or killed, which ever happens first. Winona nails the role of an LA Woman perfectly. She comes on really strong then fades away just when you think you can capture her... No one plays a dry personality as well as Wes Bentley and he's as dry as the desert in this movie.",1356393600,3,541,4.262135922330097

8333417,4,B001PJRATE,"I'm not sure how to review this film simply because part of what makes it work is all the things you imagine are going to happen. Then they either do or they don't. There's nothing really surprising, looking back the film more or less had to go in the direction it did. I think that as long as you accept the characters for who they are, this film not only works, but works well.  It's not Romeo & Juliet, so it may be difficult to push an interpretation on the main characters. An open mind & some serious suspension of belief is necessary here. Lot's of quirky comedy going on with just enough reality to make the film move along without ending up in a true morass. I'm trying not to spoil anything. So I won 't...I hope..........",1342915200,3,732,4.304347826086956
