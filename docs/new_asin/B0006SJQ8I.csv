8042681,3,B0006SJQ8I,This was also not what I expected.  Adequate acting but plot and story were some what left with a lot to be desired.,1398384000,2,116,4.043478260869565
8042682,1,B0006SJQ8I,"Unappealing comedy that starts out slowly and then builds into complete stupidity. Lucy deserved better. The print is fine, and I applaud studios like Sony and Warner Brothers for releasing these obscure films, but don't be taken in by curiosity of seeing Lucy pre-""I Love Lucy"" fame. Buy ""Fuller Brush Girl"" - which Sony has also released - instead. Now THAT'S a fun, enjoyable movie.",1315526400,5,385,4.938461538461539
8042683,5,B0006SJQ8I,"The plot was briskly paced, fun and interesting.  The cast was wonderful.  Enjoyed every minute of it.  It was not a modern film, and may make you wince occasionally but why give up the fun?  Lucille Ball would want you to laugh.  Happy 100th Birthday, Lucy.  Incidentally, the title refers to her husband's business affairs, not extra-marital affairs (of which there are none in the plot).",1313539200,2,390,4.833333333333333
8042684,3,B0006SJQ8I,"Her Husband's Affairs is a film about a man (Franchot Tone) whose hair brained schemes for selling strange items always land him in trouble. His wife (Lucille Ball) constantly tries to rectify the situation, often causing even more problems. When Tone advertises an amazing hair removal product created by his strange scientist friend, he thinks he is floating on air until it turns out that the product actually grows hair to the extreme.

Franchot Tone is likable in this film, but his character constantly gets the short end of the stick. For this reason, the film is a bit frustrating.

What is more frustrating is that Lucille Ball is smug when her character does something she thinks is right, a most undesirable trait.

This film overall could have been better executed if the characters were more appealing to the audience.",1133136000,3,831,4.921428571428572
