1619284,3,B00005KA6M,"EASTWEST DVD double features offer two films on one disc side, with no subtitles or extras beyond plot synopses on the cases's back cover. Audio levels are remarkably high but distortion-free. Their space-saver two-fers provide a nice variety of lesser-known films for bargain prices. Recommended.

Video quality of these two unrestored movies is acceptable.

FILM SYNOPSES--

STRIKE FORCE
Richard Gere's third film, some two years before his break out performance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LOOKING-FOR-MR-GOODBAR/dp/B00005JN75/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LOOKING FOR MR. GOODBAR</a>&nbsp;(1977) is this failed pilot for a French Connection-ish TV show. Lead Cliff Gorman is a NYC cop who teams with the Feds to battle a drug ring.

CORRUPT
Stars Harvey Keitel and punk rocker Johnny Rotten. Keitel is a country music-loving NYC detective who imprisons and tortures cop-killer Johnny, but the masochistic creep-o only begs for more abuse. An odd, violent little movie and the better of these two.

1619285,4,B00005KA6M,"Nine years before his raw, celebrated performance in ""Bad Lieutenant"", Harvey Keitel gave us another visceral portrayal of a corrupt cop in this Italian police thriller.  From Harvey's fringe  years in European Cinema, this highly original film pairs him opposite  former Sex Pistols frontman Johnny Rotten.  Rotten, billed as John Lydon,  is an obssessed loner and would-be cop killer conducting personal  survellance on the police.  He seeks out Lieutenant Fred O'Connor(Keitel),  at O'Connor's posh Manhattan apartment that the Lieutenant has purchased  with money amassed while on the take, to confess to a series of murders.  From that point the two engage in a bizzare and engrossing psychological  battle of wills.  In ""Corrupt"", Keitel gives us a portrayal of  a deeply conflicted man at odds with himself.  Unlike the Bad Lieutenant,  who undergoes a combustible emotional breakdown, O'Connor is a man slowly  unraveling and Keitel expertly displays every slow painful moment.  Along  with his other early 80's films  ""Deathwatch"" and ""Bad  Timing"", ""Corrupt"" proves that Keitel was always giving top  notch, emotionally invested, and highly credible performances, even if he  wasn't always getting the notice he deserved for them.",949536000,8,1240,5.48404255319149
7943053,1,B00005KA6M,"Terrible film. Lots of people complain that John Lydon can't act. But honestly I'm surprised any actor in this piece of garbage ever worked again after this. And it's not the actors fault. It's poorly directed, poorly written, and poorly edited. No actor could have come out of it looking good. On top of this, on a technical level it's really bad as well. Looks like a SD digital transfer from a VHS tape. Not that a decent transfer would have made it any better. It just adds insult to injury.",1525824000,,495,4.450549450549451
7943054,3,B00005KA6M,"Harvey Keitel's other corrupt police lieutenant movie is this cheap Italian production, and boy, is it cheap: choppy editing, an electronic score Ennio Morricone probably threw together over a weekend, night photography so poorly lit it might as well have been a black screen, etc. Thankfully, the acting and storytelling salvage the budget production values and then some. Set in Manhattan, Lt. O'Connor (Keitel) and an accomplice have illegally seized a high-end apartment. The titular villain, played by The Sex Pistols' John Lydon, discovers this bit of information and leverages it to bend the lieutenant to his will. There's an electricity and tension in the antagonistic relationship between Keitel and Lydon (in sadly his only film acting role) that thankfully stays compelling to the very end. It's also interesting in that it's a have and have-not relationship - O'Connor is just trying to make ends meet while Leo is an affluenza-stricken vigilante - that seems more relevant to the end of the '80s than the beginning of it. It's definitely no masterpiece, but it's still very enjoyable as a corrupt cop yarn and as a cultural artifact.",1524787200,,1147,5.13903743315508

7943058,3,B00005KA6M,"Problem number one: The picture is suboptimal; this looks like one of those bargain basement VHS to DVD jobs.
Problem number two: The dialogue is worse; whoever wrote the screenplay shouldn't have, for this person had at best a tin ear for dialogue, and the story - well, I'm wise to that old trick of trying to sweep character motivations under the rug of ""psychologically disturbed"". The motives didn't add up.
Problem number three: The soundtrack is ghastly; I don't care who's credited with writing it - the only thing more annoying than that electric guitar motif was that awful song Harvey Keitel's character would play on the phonograph. Oh yes, and the sound is a bit unclean; the level of attention given the sound was roughly comparable to that given the picture quality.

Let's face it - this is a celebrity vehicle. To be sure, I have seen some papers in the scientific literature that are even less credible than the story for this film - and with the exception of those two STAP cell papers in Nature, they've all been retracted.

A pity.",1396224000,2,1052,4.681081081081081

7943062,1,B00005KA6M,"COP KILLER (1983) starring the great Harvey Keitel, is a movie that
builds up plenty of suspense and drama towards the end, but for
most of the movie, has a plot that is pointless and often absurd.

The DVD release seems directly transferred from the poorest VHS
tape imaginable, with a pan-and-scan format (unlike widescreen that
most people have come to appreciate and prefer these days.) The
image often is out of focus, dark, and the audio is often uneven,
inconsistent, to the point that the camera's motor is often
audible, as the it is rolling. With absolutely no mixing in the
audio, often the dialog is inaudible, other times poor, etc.

The goal of the producer was to have a big calling card in the form
of rock band Sex Pistol's John Lydon (who was the vocalist for the
punk bank in the 70's, together with Johnny Rotten, and others). At
the time of this movie, I would assume Lydon's musical career had
ended, the punk phenomenon proven ephemeral as the public's tastes
had changed.

Unfortunately for Keitel, this movie in no way, shape or form
approaches world-class art that the actor aspires to, nor does it
constitute any stepping stone to something greater or a milestone
in his career, as it seems nothing more than a low-budget project
to shake a few bucks off the unsuspecting young public, who either
liked the vocalist, or seem attracted to the concept of a police
detective mixing with a serial killer.

The number of absurdities are never ending ...Lydon eating food
from a dog tray, as he's locked up in Keitel's bathtub, after
snooping too much, and getting to close to the policeman, for
example.

In addition to low budget cameras and film, the skill of the
photographers is put into question, as the camera is ""jerky"" when
trying to follow action sequences as simple as an actor walking
across the street, which suggests either inexperience, lack of
skill or lack of budget. The color is too often faded or showing
distortion. There are no subtitles.

The visual special effects are either very primitive or
non-existent. The audio effects appear for the most part as having
been made on a $20 synth instrument, meaning cheaper than cheap.

The banjo soundtrack, doesn't help.

The movie could have redeemed itself, had it offered some laughable
scenes, plot or dialog. Unfortunately, the public is left on their
appetites, as the suspense and thrill of the ending (which the
director suceeds in building) unfolds in a simplistic, predictable
fashion.

Overall, in all aspects, except Keitel, the movie is not world
class at all, but mainly juvenile as a product, although it does
offer that all-important dream-like quality that most people will
remember as a weird nightmare seen on their DVD players.",1270166400,,2734,4.849785407725322
