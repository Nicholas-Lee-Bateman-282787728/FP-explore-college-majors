Cannot beleive this movie exists,Thank You Chemicalburn films.
Enjoyed the whole 100 minute ride ,er walk,err journey of a Male Zombie,His Human-ish baby and a female mortal.
No dialogue as you're used to,But totally communicated emotions and progression of story.
Did you know Bill Hinzman, Sometimes recreates his character from original Night Of The Living Dead and Flesheater, Well he would be proud of the appearance of zombie lead,Its eerie and yet much more.",1297209600,2,503,5.461538461538462
4372850,4,B004GB5BVW,"Zombies...with substance??  Yes, it exists!  There was enough traditional zombie action to satisfy the zombie-phile in me, but this was actually a wonderful drama at the same time.  It's creepy and gory and also manages to be touching at the same time.  I feel like my personal standard for zombie movies has been raised after seeing this one.",1370390400,,343,4.862068965517241
4372851,5,B004GB5BVW,"Finally, a zombie movie who's plot I haven't seen!  This is a totally original movie, I was so impressed with the plot.  There is plenty of good zombie gore, but the story is what makes this movie spectacular.",1368316800,,209,4.473684210526316
4372852,1,B004GB5BVW,"I can't believe I spent hard-earned money on this joke of a zombie movie.  It is terrible...and that is being nice.  Everything about it is terrible...no acting...no cinematography...nothing scary...nothing, nothing, nothing.  Avoid this at all costs.  Trust me, you'd be better off cleaning the litter box or picking up the dog poop in the back yard.",1349049600,,351,5.214285714285714
4372853,5,B004GB5BVW,"I bought Julian Grant's ""The Defiled"" because it was compared, critically, to Herk Harvey's legendary little chiaroscuro masterpiece&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carnival-of-Souls-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/1559409002/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carnival of Souls (The Criterion Collection)</a>.  While I'm not sure it quite fits in that rubric, this was well worth the money as it poses a question few movies can pose while remaining conventional: can a man remain a man when he's not, well, a man?  Filmed with a sort of blue lit geritol sheen to it, this little indie (picked up by Chemical Burn studios) piece is set in a post apocalyptic world.  We are never told why everyone (like our protagonist) become a zombie and that's not really what it's about anyway.  The first 15 minutes is pretty much standard zombie fare with an unusual ambiance to it until a ""child"" is born.  Think of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eraserhead/dp/B00003CWPL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eraserhead</a>.  One among many unanswered questions is the *nature* of the child and if that has anything to do with how the movie turns out in the end.

I'm not at all a fan of zombie movies.  I find them tiresome, as George Romero did that already in the 60's and 70's.  This evanescent tale of fatherhood and responsibility could have used any ghoulish archetype--vampire, werewolf, etc--and still been successful in the hands of Julian Grant.  It's not actually that gory, either, as so many reviewers complain it is.  There are only a few really graphic scenes.  For some reason this is set apart from most of what I've seen in the independent horror genre.  It has a spirit and a point to it, plus the superb cinematography.  Recommended to lovers of horror and lovers of film, really.",1338768000,,1856,5.653429602888087
4372854,2,B004GB5BVW,"Depends on what you like, I like many Indy-films and took a chance.  Did not like it but not that it was badly or shabbily done, it was not - just turned out not to entertain me in any regards (and I like some weird stuff) -- best I can liken it to is silent expressionist style that meant quite a ""point"" to the writer, but did not translate well, to a person who was not invloved in its production.  So not a crappy film in any way - just won't watch it ever again - had no ""re-play"" value for me.",1322784000,,499,3.8823529411764706
4372855,3,B004GB5BVW,"This movie tried really hard to replicate the feel of the original Night of the Living Dead. Shot in black and white, same sound effects, classic music, and generic looking classic zombies, but sometimes when you try too hard it really shows. The makeup effects basically looked pretty bad- I'm surprised that Robert Kurtzman was responsible. It was a combination of cheap looking appliances and black makeup smeared around the eyes and mouth. Even the original NotLD makeup looked more convincing.

The story was decent and something new for the genre, but it either needed a little more variety or could have been cut down by several minutes. Basically half of the movie was the two main characters switching turns carrying a baby. That really got old after the first few times and eventually felt like a time waster.

The basic acting of the characters was good, but could have used a little dialogue. Having the living actors mimic the zombies by grunting and sticking their tongue out when they didn't like something was pretty dumb. I'm sure it was done as a 'no dialogue' gimmick but didn't really work. Aside from all of that it was worth a watch, but not much else.

If this were my movie I would have worked it towards an ending like this- since the main character looked similar to Bill Hinzman I would have had him walking through a graveyard, and up ahead we see a man and woman arguing- ""They're coming to get you Barbara"", ""Look there's one of them now!"".. that not only would have been a cool nod to the original movie but also act as sort of a prequel at the same time.",1311465600,,1586,4.577464788732394
4372856,1,B004GB5BVW,"Can it be that this movie's title, (""THE DEFILED""), describes not only the movie's story and characters, (such as they are) -- but also how the AUDIENCE feels after seeing this movie?

If you somehow have seen the future, and KNOW you are going to live to be 150 years old, you MIGHT want to waste some time watching this.....er....film, (what else can one call it?  Cinema?  Movie?  Also inadequate descriptions of this....Junk!)

However, if you are NOT sure how long you will live, my advice is to stay AWAY from this movie at all costs.
The producers will NOT give you your 60 minutes, (or however long this lasts), back.  They can't, even if they wanted to.

When I was a little girl on vacation, there was a deep well on the property of the vacation bungalows, where we stayed for the smmmer.  It was dark, it was mysterious, it was darkly magical -- but my parents told my sister and I to STAY AWAY from it, and we did.  My advice is to STAY AWAY from this movie, as well -- no matter how many movie ""awards"" it has received.

Besides, the world is running out of water.  After watching this movie, I suspect most people would want to take at least one-hour showers, for at least 4 or 5 months.  If you live in your own house, that can add up to a HUGE water bill.  If you live in a condominium or co-op, you will waste the water of the entire condo or co-op....and perhaps raise everyone's carring charges next year.

Stay AWAY from this movie.  Listen to the speeches of politicians you hate, and analyze WHY you hate them, instead.  If you live in New York or other city with a subway system, ride the subways during rush-hours, instead.  Watch DVDs of any TV shows you hate.

Or go get a good night's sleep!  ( :",1308787200,,1723,4.311526479750778
4372857,1,B004GB5BVW,"after watching this movie i was sure that the producers made back their investment with my $ 15.00 purchase. daddy zombie likes to get drunk, splash water around, and have sex with mommy zombie. he often gets tired walking around and needs to finds chairs to sit on. grown up man-boy zombie likes to walk around and bark like a dog. grown up daughter zombie likes to hit everybody.  meanwhile,  everybody grunts like cavemen. then, baby zombie is born - is it alive or undead? daddy zombie decides that he will raise the little tyke. since the film makers are using a plastic doll we know that baby zombie is ""alive"" because he is always crying. a human woman who escapes from being captured by a  belching zombie finds the little tyke and her maternal instincts take over. daddy zombie discovers that dear son is missing and finds the two.  the zombie and woman then have a snarling contest, bond, and go on on a road trip together.  they find an abandoned warehouse and lo and behold someone has left open cans of dog food for them to eat and eventually throw up. they then find a secret military laboratory where all the doctors want to raise the little tyke. daddy zombie is then shot and human woman is released to wander the woods. the film is shot in black and white with what looks like a bluish tint to it. the musical cues get boring after a while, and the acting - wait what acting? - is good for those who know how to grunt. i gave the film one star because the picture iteslf was clean and crisp.",1307232000,3,1509,4.375
4372858,5,B004GB5BVW,"I have to say this is the best post apocalyptic zombie film since 28 days later. I was surprised to find out robert kurtzman of the famed knb special effects group was the makeup and special effects artist. But, for ne1 that is a fan of the genre this is a must own and if not definitely see it. you won't b disappointed",1302480000,,320,4.095238095238095
4372859,5,B004GB5BVW,"The defiled in my opinion should go down as one of the best zombie type films ever, although it deals more with disease like in 28 days later, The Defiled tells us the story without words, a very intense flick great filmmaking.
I would strongly suggest this to all zombie fans and genre collectors like myself, this is a must for any horror collection! I look fwd to more stuff from Chemical burn.",1299542400,3,397,4.4520547945205475
8428596,1,B004GB5BVW,"No sense whatsoever did this movie make. Just truly disgustingly gross. Some people without any manners, honor or consideration for others in REAL life, behave like the characters in this movie. Basically, I'll take my chances watching something better than this for madness and mayhem.",1511568000,,286,5.377777777777778
8428597,4,B004GB5BVW,"This was very good. There was just something about this movie that appealed to me. Even though I think the live human woman could have had a few more expressions, (the zombie dad had more! if you can believe that... he is a zombie for goodness sakes and he showed more emotion! LOL)  But as one reviewer said, basically wordless, so you must sit and watch it and can't be doing anything else while movie is playing, otherwise you miss the whole point. I would totally watch this again. Gets a 4 star instead of 5 because I only give 5 stars to a few of my favs. (Any Residient Evils or Riddicks, ;) Also, Stardust and Princess Bride. Quite the eclectic taste I have! LOL ) A few key questions in The Defiled unanswered, (what causes the zombification, how does a zombie mother get pregnant, was she pregnant before zombification, who were the various 'real' people, some in hazmat suites and others in just masks, was the dead hazmat suit guy that the zombie family ate a planted poison trap to kill zombies? etc.,) and because of the wordless aspect, those become non-issues. The real story is between zombie dad and human woman and his zombie baby and the both of them working to keep the baby alive. An age old story of species prejudice, walking in somebody else's shoes, and gaining perspective. ""Enemy Mine"" is another alien species with human astronaut male taking care of alien child.",1486771200,,1392,4.590361445783133

8428603,2,B004GB5BVW,"""Defiled"" is a black and white zombie film. The main character grunts like he is Tim Allen. The low budget aspect doesn't allow for zombie teeth that rip flesh. The action takes place in a woods near a city. There is some sort of biohazard accident which allows people to walk around with a clear plastic respirator masked attached to a pool hose going to an open conduit connector worn on the belt. Okay, it's low budget...no time for cardboard and crayons.

The plot is about zombie survival and group interactions.
