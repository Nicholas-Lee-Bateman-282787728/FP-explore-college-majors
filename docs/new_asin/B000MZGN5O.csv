8173668,5,B000MZGN5O,"I probably paid more than I should have for this movie, but PBS doesn't sell it anymore. I really like this movie for its chemistry concepts, and it makes for a great sub plan if you need to be absent.",1471737600,,201,4.05
8173669,5,B000MZGN5O,"This was a program I remembered from years ago, and I was delighted to find it again. To get it in a double set with ""Fireworks!"" was an added bonus. If you like seeing things get blown up, or you're a mad scientist, this one's for you.",1362960000,,236,4.042553191489362
8173670,4,B000MZGN5O,"This is a fun DVD for history and explosions buffs. Nova does a great job showing modern day explosions (dropping of a huge building) and the history from ""black powder"", NitroGlyseryn(sp), and the history of Nobel who invented them.  NOTE: Kaboom comes with a 2nd dvd FIREWORKS. Amazon, enticed me to order FIREWORKS separately not knowing FIREWORKS was already in KABOOM. Don't fall for it.",1262304000,3,392,5.030769230769231
8173671,5,B000MZGN5O,"This Nova title contains two dvd's: ""Kaboom!"" and ""Fireworks"". Both are interesting but Kaboom! is why I bought this set. It explains explosions from gun powder to the nuclear bomb. It starts with exploding flower (yes, the stuff used for baking) then shows how Alfred Nobel stabilized  the packaging of nitroglycerin. That is where the ethics comes in. Nobel had to live with the fact that he enabled humans to easily kill each other in great numbers. Oppenheimer faced the same difficulty with the nuclear bomb. I guess the lesson learned is that while explosions are scientifically interesting, by gaining knowledge of such a powerful technology, the applications of the invention and how they will be used is more impotant to consider than the excitement of the discovery. This is something scientists don't do very well.

""Fireworks"" was also interesting. Describing everything from the pressure, height, explosiveness, and colours of a firework. Again the dangers of fireworks are also noted. Fireworks have to be made by hand and the roofs of the manufacturing plant are weaken so any accidental explosions goes upward and not outward. It also shows the computer choreography.

The video quality is not great. Kaboom! is probably vhs quality. Fireworks was dvd quality. They are interesting dvd's but don't expect hi-def video.",1260403200,,1334,5.195348837209302
8173672,4,B000MZGN5O,"(I bought this a couple of years ago in VHS format but I believe it has the same content as the DVD so I'll treat it as such.)

My son has been crazy for fireworks since he was two! He is now seven, and he can name all the different types of fireworks, many of the company names in the firework industry and with help from dad--and many safety precautions--he can also create his own crude fireworks.

I bought this video for my firework-crazy son because the VHS version had a large firework display pictured on the cover and the description mentioned fireworks several times. The VHS description did not attach the secondary title -- *The Sizzling Story of Explosions* -- which would have provided a clearer description of content.

I gave this a 4-star rating because although it is--as it claims--history focused, fireworks are but a small part of the overall story. It appears that the DVD version has a different picture on the cover--a more appropriate picture--since the video is about explosions in general not fireworks specifically.

So, if you want to know how it all came about then you'll enjoy this video, but if you want to see firework displays or learn how to make your own, then try another video. In fact, NOVA has another video entitled Fireworks that we're going to try next.",1234483200,4,1297,4.675438596491228
