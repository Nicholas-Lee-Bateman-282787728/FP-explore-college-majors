3010123,1,B000XXDFYW,"I purchased the above DVD thinking it was the full length 90 minute Christmans spectacular with Sissel and the Mormon Tabernacle choir.  IT IS NOT!!  This is a Promotional DVD only and only has 5 short selections on it for a total teaser of 30 minutes.  I HAD TO RETURN MY COPY and ate all the postage expense.

Even the long Product description listed under Editorial Reviews has misleading information about this product.  The review mentions Away In A Manager, Silent Night, and Spirit Of the Season.  These songs ARE NOT even on this promotional DVD. ALSO the time of 90 minutes is listed under Product Details.  This DVD is not 90 minutes-- It is 30 minutes.

The DVD has printed right on the box, ""FOR PROMOTIONAL USE ONLY, NOT FOR RESALE"".  I hope I have gotten my point across.  I highly recomment ordering the full length concert of Sissel and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.  The DVD box of the real concert features a photo of Sissel on the cover so you will not confuse it with this promotional DVD I wasted money on.",1264118400,22,1026,4.521739130434782
3010124,3,B000XXDFYW,"This DVD is not 90 minutes long as stated on the Amazon site.  It is a 30 minute promo version of the entire extravaganza which is available on DVD as
""Christmas with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and Orchestra at Temple Square featuring Sissel"" for a higher price.

The selections are:

A Christmas overture
Bring a torch, Jeanette Isabella
In the bleak midwinter (with Sissel)
Mitt hjerte alltid vanker (with Sissel)
Oh, come all ye faithful
Angels, from the realm of glory (with Sissel)

The image is excellent but the sound is clearly mono.

The selections included on this DVD are worthy of five stars but I just want to warn the potential buyer that this contains less than half of the entire program.
This DVD will leave you wanting to get the entire program.",1259366400,24,764,4.6716417910447765

I wouldn't ask for a refund, despite having all of Sissel's music on other CDs.",1380758400,,355,3.9859154929577465
