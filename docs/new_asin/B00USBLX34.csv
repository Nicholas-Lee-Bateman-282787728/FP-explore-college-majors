7070995,1,B00USBLX34,"Very worn, old time, used-up script idea. Awful movie. That was Tom Sizemore in about five or six minutes of that long boring mess. ""Private Number"" is a cheapo movie with Tom Sizemore's name attached. He probably got paid more than the ""stars"", for his five minutes of screen time.",1435104000,,282,4.66
7070996,3,B00USBLX34,"This is a just-barely-better-than-mediocre rendering of a basic crime/suspense/drama/supernatural tale that could have been told much better, and with much better artistry and craft. Somehow, it was all done a bit clumsily, as if the producers and director were rushing the process, or perhaps they had attention deficit problems. The basic plot has a lot of parallels to the most excellent 1987 crime/suspense/private detective/supernatural film Angel Heart, which was a classic, and which remains a classic.

With better writing/scripting, better acting, and just a better flow, and a bit more passion on the part of the people involved in the show, Private Number could conceivably have also become a real winner, easily worth a 4 star or 5 star rating. Instead, while it remains interesting, there are so many minor plot flaws and holes, and so many little problems, that, while watchable, and while bearable, the show remains lacking; it ultimately feels a bit amateurish and clumsy. I can guarantee you that there are other creative teams that could have told this story so much better, and with so much more finesse and artistry.",1432944000,2,1136,5.173913043478261

7070998,1,B00USBLX34,"Looking back, the mistake I made, and one you can avoid making by taking my advice, is to never give any weight to movie ratings on Amazon until a good sampling is in. Say, a few hundred.

Right after I purchased this mediocre production, based in part on its four star rating, I realized, it was reviewed only five times. That should have been enough for me to pass for now, had I remembered to check. Lesson learned. If you're smart, you'll learn it from me here now, and save yourself $6.99, and potentially more down the road on other disposable films dropped in the Amazon compost heap.

The larger lesson to learn since the advent of online streaming on Amazon, Netflix, and many other services, is that film and video production are at all time highs because of the dramatic increase of distribution outlets via online. What this means, is that studios and producers of all stripes, talents, and motivations, jump into the fray for calculated profits based on minimum investments. Ostensibly, because online viewership is less discriminating, less discerning, more impulsive, and apparently, more gullible from marketing, packaging, and in some cases, star ratings.

I chose this movie because the story, even with its formatted plot, seemed campily fun, and had some reasonable star power. Tom Sizemore, and Judd Nelson are past their box office high water marks, but they are professional, seasoned actors that still give weight to a film. That's who/what I expected to see. A bit of professionalism and seasoned acting in an otherwise predictable film.

Unfortunately, while the the producers of this film obviously agree with me about Sizemore and Nelson, they chose to deceive and rip off, the viewers, by exploiting their names and casting them in a minimum amount of scenes simply to prop up the less talented lead roles who dominate the film. Sizemore and Nelson appear for probably ten minutes at the most. If that. Both of these actors deserve better.

Considering the prominent positions they have (especially Tom Sizemore) on the promotional imagery for the film here on Amazon Prime, I consider this film to be dishonestly presented and misrepresentative.

The movie itself is fair for about twenty minutes, along with some cheap, tired shocks, but it then becomes a complete derivative storyline, as predictable as the sun rises and sets. At that point the suspense was gone, and I was wishing I was sixteen again, where the level of this film's complexity lies.

For anyone who has seen just a single movie of this genre, let alone one without actual star power, ""Private Number"" its not worth the time, the $6.99, and even the time to write a review. It is canned food, out of can.",1431302400,16,2704,4.890829694323144
7070999,5,B00USBLX34,"Loved this movie! Never even heard about it and the main reason I watched it was to see what Tom Sizemore had been doing these days, now that he's clean. I'm really glad I watched it. It was chock full of suspense and I never suspected the ending. This, in my  opinion, is a great, little thriller.
I'd definitely recommend it to anyone.",1431302400,2,337,4.349206349206349

7071001,3,B00USBLX34,"Michael Lane (Hal Ozsan) has obtained some small success with his novel ""Knight Fire."" He is having trouble writing the sequel or whatever it is he is writing. His wife Kathy (Nicholle Tom) is opening a boutique because it is California and that is what they do. Michael is one year sober but still maintains a bottle of Jack Daniels in the house, one that seems to call to him. About 10 minutes into the film, Michael begins having hallucinations and the phone starts to ring early in the morning with various voices saying, ""Remember me?""

Yes the film starts out very good. We manage to have a plot and subplot within the same person. The phone calls smartly evolve into a Twilight Zone episode. When the plot reveals its mystery, it is anti-climatic and a let down after weaving such an interesting tale.

7071002,5,B00USBLX34,"Great movie. It was full of suspense. The movie left no loose ends, the questions from the beginning were answered in the end.",1430697600,2,126,4.521739130434782

8708154,2,B00USBLX34,"Two stars only because I made it to the end. Bad acting, boring, repetitious and the ending 'twist' your should be able to figure out in the first 10 minutes or so. Can't believe someone gave this 5 stars - must be the writer's mom.",1454716800,,232,4.177777777777778
8708155,1,B00USBLX34,"From the way the pictures appear on the movie cover, you'd think this movie would feature Tom Sizemore and Judd Nelson above all others. Oh, how I wish this were the case. They were barely in the movie at all, and it seems like there was really no point to Tom Sizemore's few appearances, especially when weighed against the ultimate outcome of the film. The writing was clunky and it seemed to plod through the same basic scenes over and over; ""Prank Calls and Hallucinations"" probably would've been a more accurate title, because that's what you see for the bulk of the movie. Ultimately, the movie was completely derivative, and I sat through it hoping that the writers would take advantage of several places where it could've gotten more interesting, but I ended up deciding that I hated it once I reached the very end and realized that the writers failed to take any chances on a more interesting storyline. ""I'm gonna put you down like the rabid dog you are"" is just one example of the tired and clichd writing you'll find this film peppered with. Yuck.

If you want Tom Sizemore or Judd Nelson, save your time and skip this one. They've both done far better, and I feel bad that they were so poorly utilized.",1449705600,,1215,4.573394495412844

8708160,1,B00USBLX34,"A couple start receiving phone calls in the middle of the night where a voice says ""Remember me?"" and then hangs up.  The woman is opening a boutique, wants desperately to have a baby (she's 37 and that biological clock is ticking) and is taking anti-seizure medication.  The man is an author struggling mightily to write the sequel to his modestly successful debut novel.  Both of them see and hear strange things but the husband is more actively targeted to the point where the police and his wife all think he's crazy--or that he's fallen off the wagon (he's one year sober in AA).  But when a name he claims he heard while playing an answering machine message backwards turns out to be the actual victim of a serial killer who was never caught and the calls they are receiving turn out to be impossible for the police to trace the wife becomes more supportive and the husband starts his own investigation, convinced that the ghosts want him to solve their murders.

There are a lot of serious problems with Private Number even though the set-up is promising enough.  The movie seems to be assembled awkwardly from the parts of much better horror movies, particularly Stir of Echoes, Sinister, What Lies Beneath and Messengers although there is a whiff of Steven King's terrorized writer horror films Secret Window and The Dark Half as well.  Individual scenes frequently feel like they are padded out so Private Number can limp to a feature length 95 minutes rather than designed to generate suspense and move the story in a particular direction.  What the ghosts are doing ultimately turns out to be completely counterproductive and the twist ending is never set up sufficiently, making it feel more ludicrous than effective.  Private Number is a dud with overly familiar elements, unlikable characters and a plot that never really hangs together like it should.  Definitely not recommended.",1436054400,,1896,4.878504672897196
8708161,3,B00USBLX34,"This movie was a slow burn, mixed bag of suspense, minor thrills and supernatural. Topped off with a 'wtf did i just watch' twist ending. The ending is the big letdown. The somewhat overactive male lead kinda was irritating. But those things aside, it may be worth a watch.",1435276800,,273,4.591836734693878
