8126717,5,B000FUF70S,Bob Newhart is always good in whatever he's in. He's a classic.,1486425600,,63,4.333333333333333
8126718,3,B000FUF70S,"Actually bought the movie for Valerie Landsbug's participation. Even though she's not in it much, I still enjoyed the film.",1482364800,,123,5.2
8126719,4,B000FUF70S,Fun movie and I'm in it.,1428796800,,24,3.1666666666666665
8126720,4,B000FUF70S,"This is an old movie. It's good, but not great. I really just recommend it for runners who might want to add it to their running collection.",1354579200,,140,4.222222222222222
8126721,3,B000FUF70S,This was a decent movie of the week when it came out. Sadly whoever listed this doesn't even mention Bob Newhart in the title. It was a bit soapy but running and marathoning gets short shrift normally on tv and the movies. This is worth a look.,1231718400,,244,4.212765957446808
8126722,1,B000FUF70S,"this movie was not at all what I thought it would be about. I was hoping for a movie about training and running a marathon, but instead got a sappy movie about a man having a mid life crisis. I did manage to watch the entire movie, but wouldn't reccommend it if you're looking for a ""true"" marathon movie.",1222905600,2,305,4.186440677966102
