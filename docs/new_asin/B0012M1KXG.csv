3092091,4,B0012M1KXG,This documentary film was very interesting and informative. This film sheds light on how Islam found its way to the Americas through slaves during the slave trade.,1278806400,,163,5.074074074074074
3092092,4,B0012M1KXG,"Loved it. Just shows that when a person is free, they would do anything to get that freedom back if it were ever taken away from them.",1273190400,,134,4.0
3092093,5,B0012M1KXG,"I watched this story twice on PBS last night and found it both entertaining
as well as educational. It also opened me up, as I had never heard of this story before...
A genuine african prince who gets captured and sold into slavery in the late
1700's / early 1800's, serves for 40 yrs under the brutal slavery system in the
Natchez Territory, which is now Mississippi, but once was owned by the spanish like Florida once was.
Though he is highly educated, civilized, and in fact speaks several languages and reads
and writes arabic fluently, this is overlooked and dismissed by his white slave owner,
who can only see his black skin and think of how he and several other slaves which he
has purchased can make him rich by working his land!
Remember, we were supposed to be godless ignorant uncivilized savages?? (-:
Kinda makes you wonder about the relativity of the words ""ignorant"" and ""uncivilized"" doesn't it?
A chance encounter with an unlikely ally turns this ""Prince Among Slaves"" fortunes around
and slowly but surely, he wins his freedom. But there are so many other layers to this story
that I don't want to give away in my review because I want you, the purchaser, to see it
for yourself so you can get the full emotional and intellectual impact of this moving story!
This is a worthwhile addition to your DVD collection if you like documentaries about
the early origins of America and it's evolution into becoming what it eventually became.
There is still more growth and understanding to be achieved between all the races
and cultures who make up our great american gumbo, even in this day & time when we've made
so many strides, yet true equality and understanding still elude us in many ways collectively.
Kudos to PBS for creating another great story!",1266364800,6,1767,4.703225806451613
3092094,4,B0012M1KXG,"I have always wondered why some African American folks have Muslim names, this movie answered my question!
Also for those who are seeking truth about the atrocities of the white man in the name of their religion, this is a must see movie.",1256256000,3,238,4.558139534883721
3092095,5,B0012M1KXG,I really enjoyed watching this movie.  I never thought about that many of the african slaves who were forced to come here to the U.S. were Muslim.  Very well done movie and this is a true story.,1234483200,3,194,4.216216216216216
3092096,4,B0012M1KXG,"Most conscious people know a bit of Abdul Rahman's biography. But this documentary brings his life into detailed focus. I actually think his story is more of the norm than the exception.

I didn't know Rahman used the homeland of Morocco to his advantage, until President Adams found out he was from Gambia and withdrew his support.

It was nice to see the so called ""Black"" Masons (Prince Hall) rally around Rahman's cause and plight. Mos Def does part of the narration. I salute Abbie Shabazz on his procreation. Bill Duke directs this documentary and I can't help to marvel how far he has come from playing the angry Abdula in the movie ""Car Wash"" to directing such a meaningful work of liberal art. I commend Bill Duke and all involved for bringing the Abdul Rahman story to further light.",1226448000,3,793,4.6571428571428575
3092097,4,B0012M1KXG,"Hollywood really needs to take this story and move with it!

PRINCE AMONG SLAVES is an hour long documentary on the true life events of one Abduhl Rahman,son of the Muslim King of Futa Jallon,who was sold by rival African tribes into Europeans hands and transported to America in 1788. Purchased by a Thomas Foster,""Prince"" as he was to be called,serves 40 years as a slave,marries and sires nine children,and becomes political fodder for  a Mississippi News Journalist,two Presidents,one Secretary of State and for the  entire American Colonization Society in his fight for freedom and return to his homeland. This is a great and absolutely fascinating true story directed and written by Lloyd Jones, Andrea Kalin (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Experience-Partners-Of-The-Heart/dp/B00008G97L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Experience - Partners Of The Heart</a>) and Cannes nominated Bill Duke(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Killing-Floor/dp/B000VUFJ00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Killing Floor</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miracle-s-Boys/dp/B000B5XOX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miracle's Boys</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hoodlum/dp/0792838076/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hoodlum</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rage-in-Harlem/dp/B00008L3TG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rage in Harlem</a>).""Prince"" Rahman's story reads like a fairytale,but it is pointed out,quite poignantly,that much about what is known at the time,may be greatly exaggerated due to how politically motivated certain players were in ""using"" Rahman's story.

This documentary is narrated by Mos Def and is partially ""talking heads"" and partially below average re-enactment for a PBS Special. THAT is my only rub with this presentation. The budget may have been low and there is subpar acting,makeup and sets. There is nothing,though,subpar about the information presented here.

3092098,5,B0012M1KXG,This PBS documentary tells the story of an African Prince who is brought to Mississippi in the late 18th century.  It it a beautiful and moving story that I never heard in my US History classes.  The story of Abdul-Rahman is one of hope and perserverance and truly deserves more attention  I hope it is one day made into a feature film one day.  I definitely plan on reading the book now.,1202601600,15,388,4.347222222222222

3092100,4,B0012M1KXG,"This is a good documentary. It gives a very good historical perspective on the ugliness of slavery. It highlighted the many hardships, brutalities, and horrendous conditions faced by the slaves held in captivity against their will. This documentary shows the resilience of ""Prince"" to rise above his plight to seek freedom for himself and his family. This documentary was painful at times to watch but the actors gave a believable portrayal of their ""circumstances"". The dialogue between the characters was good and the dramatic scenes brought out in me emotions of empathy, anger, sadness, and hope. This documentary may have began back in the time of slavery but it gave me food for thought today of one example of how one person can shape the course of history for generations.",1497398400,,780,5.007692307692308

Contrary to popular myth, the Africans brought to North America in chains were not uneducated savages. In the case of Prince Abdul Rahman, he was highly educated spoke and read numerous languages. He was in fact, more educated that his illiterate white slave owner.
I highly recommend this video as tool to explore the historical roots of white privilege. It glosses over the brutality of the slave trade and the slave market. Instead it focuses specifically on the concept that white men are inherently better and their interests trump everything else.  While the founding fathers were saying all men are created equal, the reality was,  they tolerated enormous amounts of inequality to win freedom from Britain. The history of this country since has been one of reconciling  freedom and equality.",1476230400,6,878,5.125874125874126

Without doubt the ""prince"" this movie is about was a slaver and profited selling other blacks to the Muslim and European world. Slavery was going down in Africa LONG before the white man (whom this movie attempts to blame) came around the African cesspool...Of course this doesn't fit the narrative this movie is intended to convey of the poor black man enslaved by the white man...This movie also neglects to mention it was England and America that pushed to end slavery, and they did, and this infuriated blacks who made a fortune enslaving and selling their brothers and sisters into Muslim and European slavery.

Abdul Rahman, son of an African Muslim King, is taken from his home and sold into slavery in Mississippi. He marries, starts a family and eventually gains a sort of freedom for himself.  A sort of freedom that enabled him to move among many social circles to raise funds to buy the freedom of his wife and children.

When it comes to the gruesome part of slavery images were put in place to soften the blow of the horrible acts of that day.  There are some Foster's and Harris' in my family.  I'm ordering the book and can't wait to read it.  I'm doing my family tree online.  I've only been able to go back to 1850 in some cases for certain people in my family.  This story goes back to the end of the 1780s or 1790's. Wow!!!  If I could only trace my family back that far. There is a drawing of him that will be shown at the end of the movie.

Really a shame that he was never able to return to the Futa to see his family.  It is a beautiful region.

My heart broke for him and his family and it made me cry more than once.  I wish he could have lived long enough to see the fruits of his labor & to see all of his family brought together because of his sacrifies and deligence in order to accomplish this very difficult task.  A lot of men would have given up a long time ago but he was a true PRINCE and I don't mean his title.  I highly recommend this movie to everyone.,1433721600,,555,3.8761061946902653

3092477,3,B0012M1KXG,"This movie fell short for me. For one thing, we never really got to know the main character. Of course, we feel compassion for him and his plight, but what makes him so special? Why is he more important than any other enslaved black man? Because he was a prince, he is somehow better than everyone else and deserves better treatment? The story-based-in-fact was okay in the beginning, but when this man got his freedom, he did nothing to help free other slaves. His only goal was to free his own family and get back to his own soil. Then, after begging all across the land for money (instead of fighting for the freedom of enslaved peoples) he managed to free only two of his kids and took off for Africa anyway! The story had promise, but fell short. It's like they took a story that would take five minutes to tell, and made it into a full-length movie. I felt less compassion for this man than I've felt for just about any other enslaved human I've read about or seen in movies--and certainly less than any character in Roots.",1430611200,5,1029,4.421052631578948

3326590,5,B0012M1KXG,"I watched this story twice on PBS last night and found it both entertaining
as well as educational. It also opened me up, as I had never heard of this story before...
A genuine african prince who gets captured and sold into slavery in the late
1700's / early 1800's, serves for 40 yrs under the brutal slavery system in the
Natchez Territory, which is now Mississippi, but once was owned by the spanish like Florida once was.
Though he is highly educated, civilized, and in fact speaks several languages and reads
and writes arabic fluently, this is overlooked and dismissed by his white slave owner,
who can only see his black skin and think of how he and several other slaves which he
has purchased can make him rich by working his land!
Remember, we were supposed to be godless ignorant uncivilized savages?? (-:
Kinda makes you wonder about the relativity of the words ""ignorant"" and ""uncivilized"" doesn't it?
A chance encounter with an unlikely ally turns this ""Prince Among Slaves"" fortunes around
and slowly but surely, he wins his freedom. But there are so many other layers to this story
that I don't want to give away in my review because I want you, the purchaser, to see it
for yourself so you can get the full emotional and intellectual impact of this moving story!
This is a worthwhile addition to your DVD collection if you like documentaries about
the early origins of America and it's evolution into becoming what it eventually became.
There is still more growth and understanding to be achieved between all the races
and cultures who make up our great american gumbo, even in this day & time when we've made
so many strides, yet true equality and understanding still elude us in many ways collectively.
Kudos to PBS for creating another great story!",1266364800,6,1767,4.703225806451613

I didn't know Rahman used the homeland of Morocco to his advantage, until President Adams found out he was from Gambia and withdrew his support.

It was nice to see the so called ""Black"" Masons (Prince Hall) rally around Rahman's cause and plight. Mos Def does part of the narration. I salute Abbie Shabazz on his procreation. Bill Duke directs this documentary and I can't help to marvel how far he has come from playing the angry Abdula in the movie ""Car Wash"" to directing such a meaningful work of liberal art.

This documentary is narrated by Mos Def and is partially ""talking heads"" and partially below average re-enactment for a PBS Special. THAT is my only rub with this presentation.

Contrary to popular myth, the Africans brought to North America in chains were not uneducated savages. In the case of Prince Abdul Rahman, he was highly educated spoke and read numerous languages. He was in fact, more educated that his illiterate white slave owner.
I highly recommend this video as tool to explore the historical roots of white privilege. It glosses over the brutality of the slave trade and the slave market. Instead it focuses specifically on the concept that white men are inherently better and their interests trump everything else.  While the founding fathers were saying all men are created equal, the reality was,  they tolerated enormous amounts of inequality to win freedom from Britain. The history of this country since has been one of reconciling  freedom and equality.",1476230400,6,878,5.125874125874126

3326915,5,B0012M1KXG,I really enjoy this movie and plan on seeing it again.  It is good for all people.  When it comes to the gruesome part of slavery images were put in place to soften the blow of the horrible acts of that day.  There are some Foster's and Harris' in my family.  I'm ordering the book and can't wait to read it.  I'm doing my family tree online.  I've only been able to go back to 1850 in some cases for certain people in my family.  This story goes back to the end of the 1780s or 1790's. Wow!!!  If I could only trace my family back that far. There is a drawing of him that will be shown at the end of the movie.  The actor who plays Abdul Rahman looks like the real person.  Excellent acting by all actors!,1449100800,8,706,3.9785714285714286

Really a shame that he was never able to return to the Futa to see his family.  It is a beautiful region.

My heart broke for him and his family and it made me cry more than once.  I wish he could have lived long enough to see the fruits of his labor & to see all of his family brought together because of his sacrifies and deligence in order to accomplish this very difficult task.  A lot of men would have given up a long time ago but he was a true PRINCE and I don't mean his title.  I highly recommend this movie to everyone.,1433721600,,555,3.8761061946902653

3326974,3,B0012M1KXG,"This movie fell short for me. For one thing, we never really got to know the main character. Of course, we feel compassion for him and his plight, but what makes him so special? Why is he more important than any other enslaved black man? Because he was a prince, he is somehow better than everyone else and deserves better treatment? The story-based-in-fact was okay in the beginning, but when this man got his freedom, he did nothing to help free other slaves. His only goal was to free his own family and get back to his own soil. Then, after begging all across the land for money (instead of fighting for the freedom of enslaved peoples) he managed to free only two of his kids and took off for Africa anyway! The story had promise, but fell short. It's like they took a story that would take five minutes to tell, and made it into a full-length movie. I felt less compassion for this man than I've felt for just about any other enslaved human I've read about or seen in movies--and certainly less than any character in Roots.",1430611200,5,1029,4.421052631578948
