2283975,5,B0009ETDCI,"Ki-duk Kim delivers an inquisitive blow to the audience with his film titled Bad Guy.  Here he intends to make the audience question whether humans can get along despite differences in class, education, appearance, and other social standards that the society creates.  On the surface these differences might not be what the viewer discovers, but in retrospect, or maybe even during the film, the notion of harmony among human differences might emerge in consciousness.  Nonetheless, Ki-duk Kim paints a cinematic tapestry of brutality and hatred that strikes deep into the soul and core of humanity.

Bad Guy is not unlike Ki-duk Kim's other films in regards to the symbolism and the artistic expression that this South Korean director strives to visualize on the silver screen.  Yet, the situation is new and the story is unique even though he returned to teenage prostitution in Samaria (2004), the English title Samaria Girl.  The depicted cruelty often finds its place in Ki-duk Kim's films, may be even a reason for his popularity.  However, it is in the moment of viciousness where he generates the artistic moment that crosses between what is acceptable and unacceptable.  These are moments where opposite sides cross into each other's sphere like a bridge built for a moment that is destroyed in the next instant.  The violence can be seen in films such as the Isle (2000) where a woman pulls up a man by a fish hook and the dog killings in Address Unknown (2001).  It is in these violent moments where Ki-duk Kim reaches the furthest while trying to communicate his message to the audience.

Cleverly, Ki-duk Kim opens Bad Guy with a scene of a city street where hundreds of of people are wandering during business hour.  People are shown from all walks of life, ugly and pretty, rich and poor, and among them emerges the silent anti-hero of the story Han-gi (Jae-hyeon Jo) who discovers Sun-hwa (Won Seo).  They are from opposite social classes.  Han-gi comes from the lower class while Sun-hwa is a member of the upper class.  Han-gi is a quiet, perhaps of his servitude class, pimp from the part of the town nobody admits they are from, or want to visit unless it is for carnal pleasure. Sun-hwa is the pretty college girl most men would turn their head to look at twice who is both refined and educated.

When Han-gi's eyes lands on Sun-hwa for the first time he cannot take them of her, as she sits on a park bench.  He stands there dumbfounded almost drooling all over himself while observing her from a distance.  Awkwardly, he approaches her and is unable to speak he sits down next to her.  Sun-hwa steps away seemingly threatened by his stare and presence, and possibly his looks.  After all he has a thick and long scar running horizontally over his throat.  When her boyfriend arrives Han-gi continues to stare at her.  All of a sudden Han-gi walks up and kisses her right in front of the boyfriend who helplessly tries to remove him.  Consequently, the situation escalates when Sun-hwa demands an apology for Han-gi's transgression, which ends with him getting a severe beating from a large number of bystanders.

Like a ghost Han-gi returns to his home in the poor community where girls sell themselves for a few meager bucks while bribing off nosy police officers with their only assets.  Angry and vindictive Han-gi intends to repay the mistreatment in a Machiavellian style where he concocts a trap where Sun-hwa gets into big debt.  Unable to pay off the debt she ends up becoming a slave-like prostitute where she must pay with her body and face.  Silently, Han-gi continues to watch her through a one-way mirror while she begins and continues her new life as a prostitute.  This of course has strong symbolic value in regards to the transparency of the lower class's view of the upper class while the narcissism of the rich blinds them from seeing the poor.

Ki-duk Kim's presentation of the theme is a very uncomfortable cinematic experience, yet he succeeds through this tragedy to make people think about the differences between Han-gi and Sun-hwa.  In addition, to strengthen his message he experiments with distance between the characters through both tangible and intangible symbols throughout the whole film.  In essence, the story turns into a macabre education of class struggle and differences between people where Ki-duk Kim does not hold back in his social criticism.  The film is both bizarre and surreal while also humane underneath all the ugliness, as Ki-duk Kim displays his brilliant ability to create visual fabrications from his personal artistic vision that will continue to mesmerize many for a long time.",1121299200,48,4656,4.8842239185750635
2283976,5,B0009ETDCI,"This movie blew me away.  It stripped away the sexual hysteria of our times, and went straight to the essence of human life.  The bad guy of the movie arranges for a pretty college girl to be coerced into working in Seoul's red light district as a prostitute.  At first it horrifies her, but over time and through a series of dramatic incidents, the college girl grows accustomed to her sex work, and also finds herself being drawn to the bad guy who put her there.  The college girl's initial resistance to sex-for-pay eventually fades altogether, and becomes the catalyst for the relationship that she and the bad guy eventually share with each other by the end of the movie.

This summary horribly simplifies a terrific movie that has lots of twists and turns and dramatic psychological insights to it.  I heartily recommend it to one and all.

It is a tragedy that we will never see movies like that made in this country.",1120003200,19,925,4.603658536585366
2283977,4,B0009ETDCI,"It has been said Kim has betrayed Koreans by making BAD GUY that showcases the Korean society in a dark and crimson light of seedy underworld of gangs, violence and prostitution. Their outrage, however, is misdirected.  Kim has made a film that addresses a problem that goes beyond the simple reality of Korea, and into the heart of human nature and humanity.

If anyone is looking for something romantic here, it is Kim's notion that class distinction is an artificial construct, which shields us from seeing our true selves that would buy and sell one another's services to anyone interested--disgustedly at first, but then professionally.",1114646400,13,641,5.095238095238095
2284028,5,B0009ETDCI,"I can't get this movie out of my mind...  There are some scenes in the movie that are brutally honest - about the invisible lines of separation between classes within society, lines that separate based on money, on education, and family, lines that are sometimes insurmountable.  Then there is also brutality and cruelty, and some fantastic leaps which require some suspension of disbelief.  The story, even in its brutality, seems to find a way to miraculously circumvent all the lines that it so brutally shows us, and this is a part of its charm.  It's a lark's song in the moral and societal decay of its darkness.

Class struggle, so to speak, is a theme around which this love story is woven, but it is not nice or kind in its portrayal.  The protagonist realizes early on in the story that the only way he can interact with the object of his love is by bringing her down to his level, and this he does with unwavering cruelty of his world.  The line between them slowly gets thinner as the movie wags on.  As the protagonist watches the caught pray of his obsession through the one way glass, my breath becomes slow, as I savor the unrelenting course which will eventually break the mirror between them and smell my own fear that it will not happen.  Despite all that has been done to her, however, it is the girl that breaks the final centimeter between them.

This movie is not for the faint of heart.  If for you it is more important for things to make sense and fit into your per-arranged box of right and wrong, then you will not be able to make the emotional leap this movie requires in order to affect you.  This is the interesting part of this movie - it rejects the cerebral for the emotional so completely, that you are required to shut down the brain in order to understand the characters and empathize with them.  In this, it is also uncompromising. The path to it must be to break down all walls you use to process the world.

This movie is an unconventional love story, to say the least.  It's a story of unhealthy obsession, of losing everything in order to find out who you are, a story of immersing yourself into the lowest form of existence, in its own right, and finding a light in the darkness.  Not everything is at it seems, and sometimes the heart knows and understands more then the mind.  This not always an easy axiom to accept, and we fight between the mind and the heart, hoping that which we feel will make sense, but here, it will not.  I promise you, in the world of this movie, you can only feel and you will never make sense of it.  Your mind will hate the protagonist, and your heart will leap for him.  You will find him uneducated, cruel, mean, unmovable, rough, closed off, and violent.  You will find the choices he makes in order to get what he wants grotesque.  They will turn your stomach.  Your heart, however, should you allow it to fly, will feel the depth of his heart and the power of love and passion.  Everything will spin like as if around an axis around the all consuming power of that which continues to move him emotionally, and you will despise yourself as you fall for this passion in him.  This is affecting, and arresting...  This movie will make you hate yourself, if you dare to like it.  If that is ok by you, if you can accept that much darkness in yourself, then this trip is worth taking.",1422489600,,3357,4.39870340356564

2284034,5,B0009ETDCI,"There are several elements of this movie that make it a 5 star review. First off the plot is really the disassembling of the Bad Guy's mind, and how this entropy reveals anthropological clues to humans and prostitution. The American version would be titled the machinations of a pimp's mind. The story is easily blended to other cultures and ethnicities; the bad guy persona is found in about all cultures worldwide. There are several levels this movie, but the elusive quandry of what allows rational individuals to imprison themselves in difficult situations is never answered even with all of the answers revealed. It is understanding that in some cultures once a woman is branded a harlot, she is not allowed into society and is outcast to her denizen.  That denizen in this movie is an inert character and one of revolting tedium.  The small apartment where Bad Guy and his henchmen reside and the whorehouse they watch over along with the bedroom with its two way mirror are haunting.  Their inescapable nature sears into the screen and brandish all that is evil about human trafficking. This movie is unredemptive and unapologetic with the theme of those who are on the fringe of society. This is particularly clear in a scene below a mighty bridge, when the gang sits and talks, that their labor contributed nothing to society's progress and edification; the bridge being the perfect metaphor that the rest of society labors legitimately. No background or family is revealed for any character making the mental constuct of this setting even more isolating. The only unnerving portions were the musical sequences at the beginning, otherwise it is a masterpiece. There is no genre under this which would fit, erotica is not and neither is love.",1360022400,6,1750,4.945578231292517

2284066,2,B0009ETDCI,"Having (allegedly) seen his first film at age 33, Kim Ki-Duk is a director unfettered by convention or fashion. More focused on stylistic beauty rather than the dictates of logic, narrative or viewer expectations, he has created some remarkable works that stand well outside of the cinematic mainstream, both Western and Korean. His films generally sell abysmally in his home country, and while overseas critics have embraced several of his works (particularly the more restrained Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring and 3-Iron) other critics have objected to the viscera of his films: the scenes of mutilation, violence and gross misogyny that break up his movies like ugly stab marks.

And `Bad Guy' is certainly ugly, so ugly that Tartan Films have packaged it into their `Asia Extreme' category. The problem with being unfettered by convention is that you can sometimes end up too distanced from any rational humanity. The contrived plot of `Bad Guy' sees a college girl, Sun-Hwa (young for her alleged 23 years, it should be noted) targeted by Han-Gi, a near-mute, thuggish stalker (played Ki-Duk regular, Cho Jae-Hyun), a man that always, in every single scene, seems ready to hit something or someone, taut, angry, wound up with himself. When Sun-Hwa refuses his extraordinarily clumsy advances, he devises an illogical scheme that tricks her into an act of theft that, a corrupt middleman explains, can only be repaid by entering into South Korea's prostitution industry, a sordid racket, over which has a sideline, voyeuristic, role. Han-Gi, his postured forever slumped, his unrevealing eyes always targeted at somebody else, then watches furtively through one-way glass as she is systematically raped by customers, intervening only to protect her from extreme harm. To get through her days in the squalid brothel, if not keep sane, Sun-Hwa slowly creates a world that ultimately requires Han-Gi in it as her dubious protector, and even occasional lover. This, of course, has been Han-Gi's intention all along. Much of this defies logic. In particular, Sun-Hwa's disappearance from the home seems unnoticed by her family, her friends or the college that she attends. As an Australian lawyer, I feel obliged to also note that Han-Gi's machinations would probably amount to slavery under our legal system.

Slotted in amongst the dirt, the film has many moments of beauty and creativity typical of Kim Ki-Duk's better known films, and the actors are skilled enough to almost make what is patently unconvincing convincing. Almost. Kim Ki-Duk is, essentially, a good director and this cannot be dismissed the work of an exploitative hack. But his cinematographic skill, and the remarkably intense performance of Jae-Hyun as Han-Gi, are in no way redeeming of the general misogyny that pervades the film and the fact that Han-Gi's romantic fantasies are largely a form of planned, protracted rape. The hypocrisies underlying prostitution have been the subject of many Asian films, Kenji Mizoguchi's Street of Shame and Shohei Imamura's Insect Woman being two of the better ones. But the characters of those films were more than objects for a sexual control, and the world they inhabited was better realised than this crude movie, which in the end I am not inclined to forgive.",1333324800,2,3288,5.2018867924528305

2284092,4,B0009ETDCI,"Ki-duk Kim's ""Spring, Summer, Autumn, Fall...and Spring"" (2003) was one of the most beautiful and sensitive films I've ever seen.  That's why I was so shocked when I saw his earlier ""Bad Guy.""*  The latter is probably the single-most disturbing film I've ever seen.

How could one director stretch far enough to make both?  What's the connection between them?

In her earlier review of ""Bad Guy,"" Kim Anehall masterfully summarizes its plot.  What I'd like to do is suggest a common denominator between the two films (and, indeed, I think it's probably one of the threads that runs through all of Ki-duk Kim's work):  inner darkness.  Kim seems to believe that all humans are wounded--he frequently symbolizes our psychic woundedness with physical scars (the ear-to-ear scar on Han-ki's throat, for example, that inhibits him from speaking)--and that the trauma of those wounds isolate us from one another in destructive ways.  No one is immune from this wounding.  Even innocent Sun-hwa shows a darker side when she vandalizes an art book and, even more obviously, when she tries to steal a wallet.  Perhaps what ultimately distinguishes a figure like Sun-hwa and one like Han-ki is degree, not kind.

In ""Spring...,"" Kim suggests that there's hope for our woundedness.  The returning disciple, after years of prison purgation, returns to his old master's monastery and continues the natural cycle.  He recognizes and embraces his interconnectedness with everything, and thereby overcomes the alienation caused by his wounds.  But in ""Bad Guy,"" there's no sense of salvation.  By film's end, Sun-hwa and Han-ki have entered into a frozen intimacy (if ""intimacy"" it can be called), one in which they come across more as two animals huddling next to one another for warmth than anything else.  It's a sad, disturbing ending.

""Bad Guy"" isn't the exquisite and seamless film that ""Spring..."" is.  It has at least two false endings--although the actual ending is masterful--the two beach/photograph scenes are surreally out of place, and I'm not sure that the prison sequence adds anything to the narrative (although Han-ki's steely cigarette smoking as Sun-hwa screams at him is gripping).  But the acting is solid (and Jae-hyeon Jo's nearly silent performance superb), and the cinematography, especially the scenes in which Han-ki spies on Sun-hwa through the double mirror, are exceptionally good.

2284093,3,B0009ETDCI,"Bad Guy (Ki-duk Kim, 2001)

Kim followed up the critical and commercial success that was The Isle with Bad Guy, a decidedly darker, murkier flick it's impossible to classify in any easy box; it's got elements of the Yakuza flick, the disease-of-the-week movie, the Hollywood weepie, Dogme, and a host of other movements wrapped up into one very messy little package. It's not for the faint of heart, that's for sure.

Sun-hwa (The Isle's Won Seo) is a college student. Han-ki (Interview's Jae-hyeon Jo) is the bad guy of the title, a small-time thug. There's a chance meeting at a bus stop which culminates in Han-ki forcing Sun-hwa to kiss him. This leads to Han-ki getting himself beaten not only by Sun-hwa's boyfriend, but some passing soldiers. As revenge, Han-ki and his small band of thugs ruin Sun-hwa, pushing her into a life of prostitution; Han-ki monitors her progress through a two-way mirror installed in her room. Slowly, as time goes on, an odd bond is formed between the two of them.

WARNING: here be spoilers. If you don't want the emotional overtones of the movie spoiled for you, stop reading here. It's a three-star movie, that's all you need to know. Capische?

It should be obvious from that synopsis that this is a movie that is bound to make some folks uncomfortable. That said, if all you're getting out of the movie is that this is a movie roughly akin to genre novels where the antihero rapes the damsel in distress, after which they fall in love, you may not be looking closely enough at what happens between these two characters. To say that Sun-hwa falls in love with Han-ki is vastly oversimplifying the case, I think; I'm not sure that love ever enters into the picture. Sun-hwa feels dependent on Han-ki, to be sure, and he feels protective of her, but at no time does she ever stop hating him, nor does he ever stop feeling some form of contempt for her (probably based on the difference in their class). This is a love story in the same way Se7en is a buddy-cop movie; the main relationship in the film is so highly dysfunctional, and yet so complex, that any facile analysis of the relationship between the two main characters is bound to be oversimplified.  And, from what I've read over the past few days, there's a lot of that goin' round. That's depressing, because the relationship between Han-ki and Sun-hwa is the movie; if you don't grasp the complexity of what's going on between them, you're bound to hate this. But if you don't immediately tune out the relationship factor, you'll find there's a lot going on underneath the hood here. Yeah, some of it's contrived, and some goes way beyond the bounds of realism (but then that's a Ki-duk Kim specialty; reality is only a springboard for a journey into a very weird place. Cf. The Isle, naturally). But that doesn't make it any less fun to watch. ***",1205107200,3,2848,4.654075546719682
2284094,2,B0009ETDCI,"One of those Korean director Kim Ki-duk's mannerist-minimalist films in which his raw brutality outweighs his workmanship. Basically, the plot has the title's Bad Guy (a brutal street pimp, actually), that is attracted to a pretty college girl sitting on a bench in a park. But college girl is not attracted to Bad Guy, who, by the way, never talks in the whole movie. And college girl already has a boyfriend. So, through a complicated scheme, Bad Guy is able to have her work in his brothel. Poor college girl is now a prostitute. But Bad Guy continues to be infatuated with her, and sees her work through a one way mirror. And this infatuation will let college girl eventually get the upper hand and (sort of) get even. Not exactly bad, but neither one of Kim's better films, who has done better than this (see instead Spring, Summer, Autumn... or 3-Iron).",1201219200,3,859,4.657894736842105
2284095,4,B0009ETDCI,"I'm a fan of Kim Ki-Duk's work, granted he has a somewhat of an ""outcast"" director image in South Korea but his films never fail to engage me or even ""warp"" me into another marginalized world. It's small wonder that Kim's works enjoy more success abroad than in his native land. The magic of his film-making is that he takes the viewer to understand how certain worlds operate and how his characters set their rules that apply to that world. ""BAD GUY"" is a different approach to his film-making. The imagery in this film is somewhat disturbing to some viewers; I'm certain that some may feel insulted by the proceedings but I assure you, this film will not fail in engaging the viewer.

Sunhwa is a young college student sitting on a bench while she waits for her boyfriend. Han-Gi is a misfit who notices the young lady in fascination. Upon her boyfriend's arrival, Han-Gi grabs Sunhwa and forcefully kisses her on the lips. Her boyfriend tries to pry her from his arms unsuccessfully until the police arrive. She angrily slaps him and spits on his face when the cops finally pry her from Han-Gi's arms. Soon after, Han-Gi (Cho Jae-Hyun) stalks Sunhwa and her boyfriend until he manages to entrap her into a situation that she is heavily in debt and needs to sell her body to pay it back.

BAD GUY is pure challenging cinema and may present a degrading view of how some women are treated on-screen. I didn't particularly like the idea of how Sunhwa (Seo Won) was being treated in its proceedings. But I have to admit, there is a lot of honesty in its portrayal of the red light district in any part of the world. Some people may criticize the idea why Sunhwa would allow such a thing to happen to her but then again, this type of thing does happen. (Thankfully it just doesn't happen to anyone I know) BAD GUY explores the issue of prostitution and why some women are stuck in this profession. It is a study of obsession, social class, voyeurism and violent behavior; these are the themes one needs to focus on when watching this film otherwise, the viewer may get lost in the proceedings and think that the film is a sleazy sex movie.

Bad Guy is also an odd and twisted love story. I thought Han-Gi's entrapment of Sunhwa was his reaction to the hopelessness of his social level; he thinks that he would never be able to attain a woman of Sunhwa's status. In his twisted way, he felt as if to be able to have a chance of her falling for him, he has to lower her social status. I know it's sickening; which is why ""Bad Guy"" is twisted and quite frankly disturbing. While the film's main focus is Han-Gi; a disturbed pimp, at times it is cerebrally engaging but I thought it is a sick and a sinister tease.

The central character of the film is Han-Gi. The events and Sunhwa's fate unfold with his scheming and manipulations. Like most of Kim's characters; he hardly says a word. This move is very effective as it makes all the characters in the film uncomfortable around him as well as the viewer. The audience has to watch a film with a very unlikeable character who is committing all these obscene acts as the main focus for the most of the film's proceedings. Han-Gi is a character bereft in irony and contradictions; he beats up Sunhwa's clients when they become too abusive, he watches her behind a one-sided mirror while she haves sex, he protects her from other pimps but he's the one who reduced her to a street hooker. It almost as if Kim Ki-Duk is challenging the viewer to see what is happening to Sunhwa and what the viewer thinks about it. All the terrible things that can break a woman happens to Sunhwa, which is just terrible. The film also shows a very unnerving study of her character as she begins to adapt to her terrible situation.

BAD GUY is definitely surreal and challenging. It is not very nice but darned if it wasn't engaging either. The film is visually stunning; it is full of irony and desperation. The red light district is definitely presented as a colorful but dry love-less area. Kim's camera angling also represents voyeurism as a subtle detail; he keeps the wide frame from a distance and always give the viewer a feeling that he is watching through a fence or over any object. The film also symbolizes a reversal in Han-Gi and Sunhwa's situation whenever he watches her through a one-way mirror. It's Han-Gi reversing their positions in his twisted mind.

Despite its faults, some themes seem a bit over-zealous and the very nasty disturbing images of violence and rape, Bad Guy is engaging cinema. I rather found the experience to be a bit unnerving but I do appreciate themes of darker nature. The third act of the film may puzzle some viewers as to why; but if you were paying attention for the film's entirety, you won't even wonder. Always keep in mind, Kim focuses on the how his audience will interpret his views. Most of the time, he shows uncompromising honesty in his message that last after the end credits.

RECOMMENDED! (timidly) -[3  stars]",1196640000,2,4994,4.547274749721913
2284096,1,B0009ETDCI,"I suspect the director hates any group or individual feeling privileged. This is why the director uses the male lead, who's a petty criminal, to intimidate and coerce others to his will, including the female lead. And by destroying her privileged life, humiliating and degrading her into forced prostitution, somehow there is some form of retribution achieved.

The viewer must then suspend reality and believe that the college girl/prostitute will fall in love with her tormentor. That's not love. That's about power and destroying a person's self-worth and character.

Growing up in a crime invested, tough neighborhood, I know that there is a lot of injustice in the world. But if there is a lesson in life, if a street thug lives by the sword invariably, he will die by the sword. This guy would have been dead within 5 minutes in my neighborhood.

If you enjoy watching a woman beat down and emotionally and physically destroyed, this a movie for you. But I suspect, the normal, psychologically mature person would find this story hollow and empty of any redeeming value.",1192492800,6,1076,4.933701657458563
2284097,5,B0009ETDCI,"The call to one's self draws a two sided conclusion: I am who I am or I am not who I am.  The choice to self discover leads to the truth.  The illusion of the life already lived drives us when available to see what we are not, but should be.  The film's main female character has just this journey.  Through disturbing choice and captivity, she becomes something different.  Is she changed by the environment or is this who she really is?  Is the main male character seeing the truth or does he make her who she is?  In the end, we all have choices.  And she chooses. The choice dark and manipulated with a total destruction of any normal pyschological view on life.  Very good filmography.  A balance of slow and fast shots, close and far.

2284099,4,B0009ETDCI,"First, I must complement the other reviews, they are very descriptive and accurate in covering the movie.  The only points I have to add are the following:

1. Didn't anyone notice the scar on his neck?  At some point in his life, he had his throat slashed, which explained why he stayed ""silent"" through most of the film.  He let his actions speak (violently) for him (very, very violently).  (The man almost seemed to enjoy pain & suffering - see the movie - and you'll see what I mean)

2. He wasn't impotent by any stretch.  He wasn't enjoying himself - it was more like he was just performing a function.  He didn't have sex with his victim at anytime - he 'experienced' it by watching in the mirror.  Voyeur? Maybe!

3. He did love her?  No, I believe he loved the 'idea' of the girl.  Anyone notice the photograph of him and the 'former' girlfriend?  (If anyone noticed, it was suggested that she terminated her own existence - perhaps by walking into the ocean).  Our 'victim' in this case just happened to look very similiar to the former girlfriend - which is why he 'freaked out' when he saw her, and had to kiss her in the park.

4. She did love him?  No, I believe that when she figured out what he had done to her and what the two of them had went through, she found something/someone in which to ""bond"" herself.  She found that she just couldn't ""let go.""

5. The man set her free.  Took her back to the park and set her free.  All she had to do was take herself home and reclaim her former life.  But she didn't.  It was as if she had taken stock of her situation and concluded (in my view) the following:

5a. If I walk through my front door, what kind of future will I have?

5b. Will I be forgiven?

5c. Will my friends welcome me back?

5d. What will my prospects be after college? (assuming that she  went back to complete her studies).  An assumption - everyone probably knew where she ended up (thank the boyfriend for that).

6. I concluded that SHE concluded that her future would not be bright.  Let's pretend she (and everyone) puts what happened to her behind them.  How does she end up?  Probably married and stuck as a housewife - being compelled to 'serve' her husband (among other things).  Powerless.

7. She returned.  Notice that she learned that by selling herself, she had ultimate control over her body (and men), and could use it to get what she needed/wanted.  Therefore, she returned to the one person who introduced her to the 'lifestyle.'  Please note the signifigance of the 'red dress' in the scene where she finds him on the beach - it was if she was willing to 'play the role' of the former girlfriend - thus pleasing him.  We see that they held hands (maybe twice) in the movie.  Remember, they were totally willing to keep their roles in the relationship:  He was her pimp, she was his prostitute.  There was no in-between with the two of them.  But still, they loved each other????

8. This was one of the more ""far out"" movies that I've every seen.  It's hyper-violent and it's view of the treatment of women honest.  Folks, it's a dark world out there.  If you have daughters, take note - this movie is not so far-fetched as not to be believable.  Beings become attracted to each other in the strangest ways.  Does it make sense?  Of course not!  But after all, we are all only ""human.""  And after all, that makes anything and everything possible.

9.  I've rated this movie four stars.",1155254400,8,3438,4.4003189792663475
2284100,4,B0009ETDCI,"This is what might be called postmodern naturalism.  Director Ki-duk Kim tells a brutal story without comment and without mercy.  He reminds us of some human truths that will make some viewers uncomfortable, and he invites controversy.

First, two things: Spoilers to come, so if you haven't seen this movie you might want to stop reading now.

Second, if you've seen the movie only once and are scratching your head, you're not alone.

Here's what happens: Han-ki (Jae-hyeon Jo), a street tough pimp walking along in a South Korean city spies this very pretty and privileged college girl, Sun-hwa (Won Seo), sitting on a bench waiting for her boyfriend.  The girl is everything Han-ki desires.  He sits down next to her.  She pretends not to notice him while she talks on her cell phone to her boyfriend.  When she does deign to notice him (and his desire for her) she shirks back in horror at his dirty, lower-class presumption and gets up.  Her boyfriend arrives while she throws ugly glances at Han-ki. Han-ki can't take it anymore and grabs her and forcefully kisses her as the boyfriend beats him about the head.  Some soldiers arrive on the scene and beat the tar out of Han-ki.  As a parting gesture, pretty girl spits on Han-ki as he is held by the soldiers.

That's ""the setup.""  It's the kind of setup that cries out for revenge or at least a comeuppance, which is what I expected.  Or perhaps pretty college girl and the bad guy will find true love and overcome their social differences.  What actually happens is beyond expectation in a way that is likely to stun and totally engage the viewer.

Pretty girl is at a book store.  She compromises herself (in the viewer's eyes) by tearing a page out of an art book and putting it in her purse.  This can be seen as the fatal moral flaw that leads to her degeneration.  Han-ki sees this.  (He has been following her.)  He is playing out a trap.  Near her on the book display is a fat wallet. Pretty college girl grabs it, looks both ways, and puts it in her purse.  This is the fatal moral flaw leading to entrapment and a descent into hell.  She hurries to the bathroom and in the stall opens the wallet and takes out the money.  Meanwhile the guy who lost the wallet is told (presumably by the bad guy) that she has the wallet and is in the bathroom.  By the time he gets there she is gone.  He chases after her and finally catches her.  He roughs her up, calls her a pickpocket, and then forces her to go to a loan shark and sign an agreement (with her body as collateral) for money that he says was in the wallet.

This might be called ""the turn"" as the setup takes on a startling twist.

Next Sun-hwa is forced into prostitution by Han-ki  She makes some feeble attempts to get away, but mysteriously has nowhere to go it seems, and anyway is too afraid to run.  She realizes that she is going to lose her 21-year-old virginity so she begs her captors to let her lose it to her boyfriend.  Han-ki and his fellow thugs mysteriously oblige.  However, the boyfriend is confused and doesn't get the job done.  They pull him out of the car, slap him around, dump him, and Sun-hwa is back at the showcase on the street. Through a two-way mirror Han-ki watches her lose her virginity to a forceful client.

Question number one: why doesn't Han-ki ever speak?  Question number two: why does he watch her behind the two-way mirror instead of taking her himself?

The answer comes later in the film when we do hear him speak for the first time.  His voice is a high shriek.  Guess what his unique problem is.

And then comes the resolution.  Yes, this is a love story of sorts and yes they do fall in love in a way that is debased and seemingly fated.  He's a pimp and she's now a prostitute.  This works out since he is able to vicariously experience her sexually and she is able to thereby serve the man she loves.  And together they can make a living.

There is also a supernatural element in the film that suggests that the story is part wish-fulfillment fantasy by Han-ki.  His ability to beat up the other guys and survive knife wounds fairly begs credulity.  During the course of the film he loses enough blood to supply a small hospital.  And the scene where both he and Sun-hwa appear together on the beach as if by magic is more mystical than realistic.

This is a haunting film done without any looking back or any compromise with the sensibilities of viewers.  Director Ki-duk Kim's message seems to be that animal passion will win out in the end, and that humans are, despite the facades they put on, just animals doing animal-like things in the human jungle, and deliverance comes only when one realizes his or her nature and gives into it.  Ki-duk Kim makes us identify with the bad guy and feel that he and pretty girl are no worse or no better than anyone else.

In short I found this movie disturbing like something from, say, novelist Cormac McCarthy.  I am thinking especially of his novel, ""Child of God.""  That title is ironic in the sense that his anti-heroic protagonist really is, whatever we may say or think, or however bestial his behavior, a child of God, while Ki-duk Kim's title ""Bad Guy"" (""Nabbeun namja"") is also ironic in the sense that Han-ki is by societal standards certainly a bad guy, but by naturalistic (or cosmic) standards no better or worse than the pretty college girl.

Bottom line: see this excellent and deeply troubling film at your own risk.",1147737600,9,5446,4.483214649033571
2284101,2,B0009ETDCI,"As the other reviewers make clear, this is a disturbing film in that the college girl forced into prostitution ends up by developing feelings for the man who ""ruined"" her. So you may immediately assume that the director has a deeper comment to make beyond this trite observation.

Problem is, having just watched the movie, I am not convinced there is anything below the surface. Prostitution is a fact of life in Asian cities, the theme of women overcome by their desires and in thrall to strong men a common one, and I searched in vain for any subversion of or challenge to that fantasy (as fantasy it is).

Is this any more than a homage to the inutility of futility? Not that I can see.",1140134400,6,690,4.468253968253968
