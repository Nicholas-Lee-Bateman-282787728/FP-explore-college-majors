8393378,5,B003B2UJZ0,"I have to confess that, before I watched ""La Mala,"" I thought that it was going to be a movie about the late and famous Cuban singer Guadalupe Victoria Yoli Raymond, better known to the world as La Lupe. But this passionate and captivating film is more than that. It's about the immense legacy that La Lupe left in our hearts and music history.

The story takes place in Puerto Rico, and it begins with the birth of Yoli, with her father Lzaro (Jorge Perugorra) and aunt Candela (Maria Isabel Diaz) assisting Teresa (Sully Diaz), Yoli's mother, during labor. Since the very beginning, we notice that this is not your average family, because we immediately realize that Candela, Teresa's sister, has a lot of influence in the house, where she also lives. With time, we also realize that this is a very dysfunctional family, with the father being a womanizer, the mother a victim, and Candela really imposing her ways on Yoli. Candela admires La Lupe, and it comes to her attention that Yoli has the potential of becoming a great singer, and she does everything that she can to make sure that she accomplishes just that. Yoli, indeed, succeeds as a singer and the film documents step by step her rise to the top. But, on the way, as expected, she has a price to pay for stardom, while her family slowly disintegrates.

""La Mala,"" which was directed by Pedro Prez Rosado and Lilian Rosado, is very entertaining, and has a lot of music, including some of La Lupe's best songs, such as ""La Tirana,"" ""Fever"" (her fiery version), ""Con el Diablo en el Cuerpo,"" ""Qu te pedi,"" and more. Lena Buke plays the part to perfection, including her dramatic singing - she is the daughter of Cuban singer Malena Burke, and granddaughter of the legendary Elena Burke. The rest of the cast is also formidable, and the locations in Puerto Rico are precious. La Lupe lives, indeed. (Puerto Rico / Spain, 2008, color, 93 min). Venevision International
