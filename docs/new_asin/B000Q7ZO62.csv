covers the same ground in the lessons but for me his song writing ability
just keeps getting better an better",1188259200,,168,4.451612903225806
2834283,5,B000Q7ZO62,"People know this guy is technically brilliant but do people know his songwriting abilities and his FEEL when playing these amazing songs. Paul has a knack for writing a ""simple sounding"" fun song, but when you watch what he is actually playing....you almost want to cry.  I am a drummer, and not a guitarist, but I know it when I see it. Yes, a prodigy, who is only 1/4 way through an incredible career.  Has he produced any ""desert island discs"" yet, not sure. Who would I want as a guitarist in my rock band?  Eddie VH, Yngwie Malmsteen, Tony MaCalpine, Satriani, Vai, Greg Howe, Steve Howe, Richie Kotzen, Jeff Kollman....NO, Paul Gilbert. Check out his work with PintSize as well.....",1188259200,10,688,4.669421487603306
2834284,4,B000Q7ZO62,"If you like Paul Gilbert and play guitar your already looking to buy this,and you should get it. Just be warned that you will rewind again and again on particular parts if your not familiar with the scale/mode/arpeggio he is using, as some parts go by very fast. The good news is he tells you exactly what hes doing at all times-every chord,  almost every single note-so even if you didn't know something, by the end of the segment you have gained some additional knowledge beyond""I can play a new riff!""

After the main portion of the DVD there are a few lesons on technique, some live footage, and a song sang under the credits, so you will get a great amount of entertainment value out of this as well.

All in all you will probably have a few new ideas of how to play your guitar, even if you have to go over sections repeatedly. Its worth it. Its funny. Go get one.",1187568000,8,870,4.2926829268292686
2834285,3,B000Q7ZO62,"If you're a Paul Gilbert Fan you will love this video.  He's got a great personality and he shows you all of the cool riffs from his new album of the same name.  My only complaint is that he dosen't include any tab either in printed form or ""pop up"" screens during the video.  The video moves fast so be prepared to use the pause and slow functions to try and keep up.

If he were to publish some tablature on his website that went along with the video it would help make this video a 5 star product",1187136000,3,499,4.01010101010101
2834286,5,B000Q7ZO62,"I have nothing but praise for Paul Gilbert. He's a natural teacher. Informative, never boring and I take a special interest in the way he creates music.",1186444800,3,152,4.666666666666667
2834287,5,B000Q7ZO62,"3 words...BUY...THIS...DVD!!!  Over 2 hours of the most intense shred you've ever seen in your life!  Every song, yes, EVERY song from the Get Out of My Yard (GOMY) album is covered highlighting the main sections of each song.  Only downside is there's no on-screen tab and no tab booklet included, but the closeups on Paul's fingers are great and you should have no trouble following along.  Awesome live performances of some songs from GOMY after the lesson section and even technique is covered (hammer-ons/pull-offs, arpeggios, and--my favorite--alternate picking).  So, I say again, buy this DVD.  You won't regret it!!!",1184284800,10,625,5.2

8195123,5,B000Q7ZO62,"I was presently surprised to stumble upon Paul's solo stuff. I was unaware he had been cranking out tunes solo style. This album is just plain fun. Listen to it a few times and it can hook ya. I am a guitar nut job so take that for what it is worth. I have always tried to create solos that were killer  on every note. I feel Paul is trying to do the same thing. I purchased flying dog, burning organ, vibrato and get out of my yard as well as his instructional video. From Eddie inspired moods to a little Randy Rhodes laced licks these albums run the gamunt, even a taste of blues sprinkled in. Love them all.",1367452800,,611,4.091666666666667
8195124,3,B000Q7ZO62,"Paul is an extraordinary guitarist and teacher, but this instructional is not a complete guide. If you have the Get out of my yard CD and want to study / play some of the most important riffs (and become Paul's fan), then this DVD is ok, but if you're searching for the understanding behind the use and construction of scales, then you'll be disappointed. The lack of printed or screened tab is also another thing to keep on mind, mostly if you're a beginner.",1277769600,3,459,4.476190476190476
8195125,5,B000Q7ZO62,"Paul Gilbert is a guitar god! The guy is just plain ol wicked. Great dvd for beginner to advanced. Paul's very funny, informative & Sick Sick Sick.. A true must have for any rock & roll or metal  guitarist.. This guys right up there with the greats (Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, etc...) for those of you who don't know. Paul's a very good teacher.",1261699200,,343,4.359375
8195126,5,B000Q7ZO62,"I'm a self taught guitarist (of about 10 years now). I love how Paul breaks down the songs from his album. His explanations are very easy to follow and the close ups on his fingers are great, so you don't need a tab book.  At the end of the DVD he also has some exercises for arpeggios, hammer-ons/offs, string bending, and alternate picking. Overall, its a great vid. I'd probably recommend this to an intermediate player.",1257552000,,423,4.565789473684211
8195127,5,B000Q7ZO62,I am 56 years old and I`m telling you Paul Gilbert does not get enough credit!  this DVD is a must!!!!!!!!!!,1235260800,,108,4.142857142857143
8195128,3,B000Q7ZO62,"This is just instructional excerpts from the associated album. Again it is a bit devoid of technique background and detail. It would be great to just hear him talk more about developing technique and practice regime as he is a true master. It's like icing without the cake.

8195129,5,B000Q7ZO62,Paul is a great teacher and guitarist. The DVD is perfect except it should have came with tab for beginners. A must have.,1222646400,,121,4.304347826086956
8195130,5,B000Q7ZO62,"Paul covers a lot of ground here, breaking down and discussing certain riffs and licks from his Get Out Of My Yard album.  That alone is worth money, but he also includes a few additional segments at the end covering hammer-on's and pull-off's, arpeggios, and alternate picking.  Plus, there's live footage of Paul jamming through a few of his GOOMY tracks with Mike Szuter and Glen Sobel.  I've read people were discouraged there was no tablature booklet, but in my opinion that's a good thing.  Having to work to actually learn something, rather than sit there and read it, will make your ears better plus it is likely to stick with you longer.",1208736000,2,646,4.6902654867256635
8195131,5,B000Q7ZO62,"Great DVD. This is great. He breaks every single thing he does down to the super basics. He shows you how he got to that idea, how he plays it and how you could go about it. I've always wondered how people can play so fast and I've read books on technique and never could fully grasp the idea. Well Paul cracks the mystery in very simple terms. Paul learned by ear and plays by ear which makes him a different type of teacher, he brings in a different approach. I don't think this DVD is for beginners unless your a really big fan of his or if you really like the CD ""Get Out of My Yard"" or one of the songs on it. You'll get an inside look into these songs. What surprised me the most was the lessons on technique and so forth at the end of the DVD. Very good stuff! He gives practice tips and goes into things in detail. It feels like Paul is giving you guitar lessons which is awesome! All in all because most of the DVD is geared around his CD and more specifically to playing fast I would say this DVD is best used as a learning tool. However, he does provide you with some excellent information in his explanations and teachings so you will pick up more than just how to play fast but it is not geared for that. By combining this DVD with others and some books you can go far. As an example this is what I am studying: This DVD, Chord Chemistry/Chord Progressions by Ted Greene, Fretboard Logic volumes and other lessons here and there. This is keeping my playing fresh and my practicing routine fun.",1199923200,6,1506,4.178694158075602
