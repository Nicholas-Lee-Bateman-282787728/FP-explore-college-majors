8457236,5,B00551X15U,"I have been visiting the Woodstock site since 1989 when we got together for the 20th anniversary.  I wrote a screenplay revolving around this site myself, and am trying to get it made now.
I loved the approach of this film! It is really cool to see real people with real beliefs and ideals, talking about their experiences and the reasons they still make the trek to this site at least once a year.  It affirmed my belief that the Woodstock spirit is still alive and well!
The way this film was made almost made me feel like I was there!  Sitting and talking to the hippies young and old. Hearing the stories of the way they are there to help each other without expecting anything in return reminded me of why I go back there on Woodstock weekend and other times throughout the year.
I also enjoyed the history of the times that's interspersed with the story of the site and it's progress. It's very interesting to be reminded of what was happening in the world while we were gathering in Bethel.  It is definately all related.
So, my compliments to Joe Nolan, and his team for a job well done, and for a look inside the true Woodstock spirit.",1313452800,5,1143,4.402843601895735
