1215670,4,B00000G3R0,"The Silence of the Lambs-Probably the most genuinely disturbing psychological thriller ever made, Silence of the Lambs is a must see, but its dramatic power, dark insight into the human psyche, and ugly violence (most of which is implied) ensures it's unlikely you'll watch this film more than once.  But on a first viewing, almost nothing matches this thriller's heart-pounding suspense, from Hannibal Lecter's attempted escape to the literally dark climax.  Howard Shore's foreboding score adds nicely to the intense atmosphere.
**** 1/2 out of *****
Hannibal-This underrated sequel looks and feels quite different from its predecessor.  It has no intention of excelling as a pyschological thriller, but neither is this a straight through-and-through gorefest.  Certainly entertaining but hardly mind-blowing, Hannibal is at least visually stylish and unpredictable, if not also somewhat silly.
*** 1/2 out of *****",1066089600,,917,5.6231884057971016
1215671,5,B00000G3R0,"1992: ""Silence Of The Lambs"" struck a chord with audiences, causing them to visit their therapists more often, it was said, and people became fans of Anthony Hopkins' portrayal as the elegant, intellectual, charming but psychotic cannibal ex-therapist Hannibal Lecter. Based on the novel by Thomas Harris, the movie won a host of awards, including best picture. Jodie Foster portrayed the novice FBI agent Clarice Starling, whose chemistry with Hopkins was what carried the weight of the film and made it an Oscar winner.
 On DVD, the experience is very thrilling and state-of-the art. Silence Of The Lambs still sends chills down our spines, and  engages us in a disturbing world of madness, tinged with cynical humor and engrossing conversations between Hopkins and Foster. Anthony Hopkins is Hannibal Lecter, the former therapist turned cannibal and criminal. It's undoubtedly Anthony Hopkins' trademark role and one that he will be remembered by. We are unnerved when Hannibal Lecter first meets Clarice Starling in the dungeon of the prison, where he confesses that he once ""ate a man's liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti"". To extract information revolving the transvestite skin-collector Buffalo Bill, Clarice must reveal deeply personal and traumatizing events from her childhood. She recalls running away from an abusive home  only to witness the slaughter of innocent lambs in a farm house. The memory continues to haunt her and is reawakened by the hypnotic power of Dr. Lecter. The movie ends with the capture of Buffalo Bill and Clarice Starling's promotion. But Dr. Lecter manages to escape his cell and vanishes into Italy. Which brings us to the next film in the collection, the sequel, also based on the book by Thomas Harris. The follow-up ""Hannibal"".
2002: Ten years after the release of ""Silence Of The Lambs"", and ten years after the plotline of that particular film, we find Clarice Starling in a precarious situation. She has been demoted during a violent incident and is still haunted by memories of Dr. Lecter. A lonesome woman, she receives letters from Dr. Lecter, who (like old times) wishes to help Clarice get her career going again and capture another notorious psychotic killer. Dr. Lecter has been living a comfortable and reclusive life in Florence, Italy, a city which had always enchanted him. In Florence, Lecter attends operas, plays Bach's ""Goldberg Variations"", sips champagne and yes, still hungers for human flesh.  Clarice and another agent (played by Ray Liotta) attempt to foil Dr. Lecter's  machinations, but are captured and imprisoned in the dining room of Starling's home. In a disturbing sequence, Dr. Lecter, Starling and the FBI agent eat a dinner with the main course being the agent's own brain. Dr. Lecter manages to escape once again.
Most recently, the pre-quel to the events in ""Silence Of The Lambs"" was released, based also upon the successful Thomas Harris novel ""Red Dragon"". Red Dragon is still to be released on DVD. These films are the perfect ""thriller"" collection, each with its own striking features, plus interviews with the actors and director. For fans of the Thomas Harris novels and fans of the films, this is a genuinely superb gift.",1046736000,3,3217,5.096774193548387
1215672,4,B00000G3R0,Although Hannibal may not have been nearly as good as the first I still thought Ridley Scott did a great job of directing it and The Silence of the Lambs was also very very good and had great acting all around.  Be sure to check out Red Dragon it's as good as The Silence of the Lambs!,1036022400,,285,4.0
1215673,4,B00000G3R0,"Both THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and HANNIBAL are put together in this DVD set with some impressive DVD extras.
Jonathan Demme's psychological thriller remains one of the best, simply because of the excellent talent involved, with Anthony Hopkins in superbly creepy form as Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Jodie Foster, along with Hopkins, deservedly won an Academy Award for her brilliant performance as FBI agent Clarice Starling. Based on Thomas Harris's novel, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is one of the few thrillers which relies heavily on psychological terror rather than splatter horror and ""boo!"" scares.
But there are some extremely effective shocks and twists during the course of the film. And Howard Shore's dark, brooding score adds to the creepy tone. Although the film's plot centres around tracking down the crazed serial killer named Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), Hopkins is the standout performance. The clever back-and-forth between Clarice and Lecter is well-played and enthralling, and there are some moving moments with Lecter that add to the film's gravitas. Demme's hard-edged direction won him an Oscar, and the film picked up the Best Film Award also. What does this tell you? Well, that SILENCE is the most superbly-constucted thriller ever made.
The DVD extras are very good, with a documentary with interviews with Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins, the original making-of featurette, 20 minutes of deleted scenes, outtakes and trailers. The only thing missing is a commentary from Demme.
Ridley Scott's sequel to the classic film Silence of the Lambs is a visually impressive but hollow follow up to Silence.
Anthony Hopkins (who won an Academy award for his role as Hannibal Lecter in the original) displays little of his presence that was so Oscar-worthy first time round, and Julianne Moore is no Clarice Starling. But Scott's visual style, which is what makes all his films so eminently watchable (Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator), and some expertly done sequences make up for its flaws.
Gary Oldman is great as the cop who's chasing the elusive cannibal and Ray Liotta has some nice scenes throughout the film.
But Hopkins has little to get his teeth into, and comes off as somewhat gauche. Impressive gun fights and some creepy moments with Oldman and Hopkins don't make up for the lack of suspense. A worthy, if sometimes unexciting entry into the franchise.
The DVD extras include a commentary by director Ridley Scott, 35 minutes of deleted scenes, ""Breaking the Silence"" - 5 unique making-of featurettes, 3 interactive multi-angle featurettes and trailers. Tasty stuff for Lecter fans.",1033776000,2,2603,5.185273159144893

1215685,5,B00000G3R0,"I loved it!

Finally, a DVD that have all three Hannibal movies...

In the right order to avoid confusion, ""HANNIBAL RAISING"" is settled before the two movies as young Hannibal Lecter struggle in the WWII, ""MANHUNTER"" is based on the Red Dragon, and ""THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS"" (more well-known than the other two movies, as it was first to come out in theaters) focused on a cat-and-mouse game between Hannibal the Cannibal and an inexperienced FBI special agent to catch a serial killer only known as Buffalo Bill.

Athough the acclaimed tv show HANNIBAL had reintroduced our favorite villains -- Hannibal Lecter as a antihero in that show, the sadistic Mason Verger, the Great Dragon, that we all know and loved, I praised its stunning and terrifying storyline (I really do).",1483574400,,777,4.871212121212121

I for one cannot believe they haven't revisited such a classic release. It seems they might be doing that in the next year or two though. Hannibal is the same way, a lesser film but one that is nonetheless pretty decent just with an average at best MPEG-2 transfer. Manhunter, a film I find to be fairly dated--I have no idea why it still gets so much praise--has the only modern transfer yet looks fairly average at best. At least they all have lossless soundtracks.

For 7.99 I'd say if you really want to see these go ahead. I have no intention of paying for old stuff thrown on a disc though. I'll wait for proper masters.

It's true that Silence of the Lambs has basically the same special features as the DVD release that's out there, but I was hoping that it would contain the commentary track that was on the original Criterion Collection release of the film, that featured Demme, Tally, Hopkins, Foster, and a real FBI agent.  Great commentary track.

So happy to be able to enjoy the sharpness, but bummed that I have to keep my DVDs to retain some terrific bonus content.",1398556800,3,717,4.578125
1215818,5,B00000G3R0,"SILENCE OF THE LAMBS will always be a classic film. This is a mesmerizing tale of the most heinous of nightmares come true as FBI agent Clarice (Jodie Foster) is immersed into an abyss of the darkest side of deviant human behavior where the flesh eating Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) agrees to assist her in her investigation to capture a serial killer who commits unspeakable atrocities on his victims. Jodie Foster must traverse into a world of dark sickening debauchery to capture the killer. The story takes several turns heightening the intensity and unspeakable terror of her assignment. The story is unsettling in its own right but the film seen from Foster's perspective has a pervasive feel of paranoia as if she has not been given all the information she needs or even further to suggest she is actually being set up as bait. One scene in particular comes to mind when sitting in the back seat of the car her boss (Scott Glenn) speaks cryptically to her and she just gazes at the back of his head once he turns around. You really don't know what either character is thinking.

MANHUNTER looks dated. It is incredible that this was a Michael Mann production. It no longer looks like cutting edge cinema. That is very interesting. William Petersen's stoic performance now seem just very bland and uninspired. It is hard to identify with Brian Cox as Hannibal Lector. The interpretation is less flamboyant than Anthony Hopkins' version. Fortunately Dennis Farina as Jack Crawford the FBI agent in charge is still a timely performance and has some emotional charge. RED DRAGON released in 2002 is a much better version.

HANNIBAL is an amazing film. This is an incredible film. What initially seems like a grotesque homage or even satire to the horror/slasher genre is far from that. There also is no clearly defined narrative flow to this film. It meanders in and out of dark and light places. And the fact that there is an obvious stylistic approach to many of the scenes is a bit unsettling. But that is what is at the heart of this film. It is disturbing to watch. The viewer never knows when or what or if anything is going to jump out at them. On the second and third viewing of HANNIBAL, I began to enjoying watching how the film unfolded. I think director Ridley Scott really avoids the shock value, or actually the suspense value of the story. Yes, there is a definite shock value during the finale of this film, but it is an emotional toying with the viewer. Ray Liotta certainly gets his comeuppance, Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal is certainly a very sick and grotesque individual and Julian Moore's Clarice is reduced to a curious bystander at this last supper of sorts. But, what does the viewer feel? Does the viewer have feelings of loyalty and to whom? We have already seen how Gary Oldman was a rather unscrupulous disfigured individual who may have been an even worse an excuse for a human being than Hannibal. Who was the viewer rooting for during that scene as pigs were about to much away at ole Hannibal? And then we go back to Giancarlo Giannini. He was barely a corrupt policeman. He just wanted to make a little money on the side. I think with his demise the viewer has his sympathies. But it is at that point that the viewer begins to question the higher order of right and wrong. If anything, HANNIBAL is certainly thought provoking. I think we sort of wanted to see him escape to freedom and provide us with some culinary delights for the next time.

HANNIBAL is a very good sequel with a totally different approach from the original. I think this was actually a great character study. Some scenes that reviewers thought were gratuitous are really sorties into the real world. Symbolically you let the demons come to fruition by having them come to the surface. This is not nearly as grotesque as the media hype suggested. MANHUNTER is the odd man out here, but still very interesting.",1397606400,,3923,4.67438494934877

For new fans of Lecter, perhaps brought on by the excellent NBC series, this is the set you want to get you caught up to the movies.

Although the blu ray version of this movie isn't spectacular over the regular DVD, it's still Hannibal Lecter at his finest, with 2 bonus films thrown in. I loved the Anthony Hopkins/Jodie Foster combination in ""Silence of the Lambs"", and Julianne Moore played Foster's part well in Hannibal. They are both excellent thrillers and I've watched them at least a half dozen times.

The third movie, Manhunter, I had only seen bits of over the years. Watching it, I kept confusing it with Red Dragon as they are based on the same book, I believe. The blu ray quality was good on this film, and the movie was alright. They seemed to build it up slow and then rush the end too much for my liking.

1215841,4,B00000G3R0,"I do not care to provide the 100th summary of the plot and my opinions on the acting et al, so, as I usually do, this review focuses solely upon the quality of the 3 films on Blu Ray and my rating is for that quality and not  the quality of the movie itself.  All 3 films come on their own separate Blu Ray disc so nothing is overly compressed trying to get 2 films upon one disc.

Manhunter.....While I knew of the 1986 release of this film, I had never seen it either on broadcast or DVD and had no preconceived notions about it.
  VIDEO....
  This film has a  MPEG-4 1080p, 2.35:1-framed transfer with some pretty thick letterboxing.  Overall the video, despite a high Mbps rate average in the low 30's presents muted colors with a soft contrast.  Details tend to be crushed by the blacks in darker areas and a medium grain throughout,  and while I am sure that it must be better than seeing it in Standard Definition, I strongly doubt that any remastering of the film has been done.  I did see 2 jump cuts in the film that could not be as they were intended.  It is possible therefore that this film was put together from a couple of different masters.  While I said I wouldn't provided my opinion on the films, I must say that the later remake 'Red Dragon' was a far superior film.  3 stars.
  AUDIO....
  Despite a lossless DTS MA HD 5.1 audio codec, this film stems primarily from the center channel and though there were many opportunities to righteously direct foley fx to discreet channels both front and back, only the front channels were used and used very sparingly.  The dialogue is clear enough and the volume levels set properly but overall the entire sound track sounds a touch soft and muted.
  EXTRAS....
  Only an ad about how great digital downloads are.  No real extras at all.

Silence of the Lambs...
  VIDEO...
  An average bit rate in the high teens/low twenties...Silence of the Lambs on Blu Ray is the same video transfer as previous releases of this film on Blu Ray.  Never the less, this is not necessarily a bad thing.  Compared to this film on Standard Definition DVD, the movie is warmly color graded in most areas and details, while not outstanding, are clearly defined.  Fine details like a character's hair or rocky background tend to be a touch soft but this does not distract from the film's presentation.  Overall a video transfer of 4 stars
  AUDIO...
  The same lossless DTS MA HD 5.1 codec creates a considerably more open and transparent listening environment.  Dialogue is clear and does not fight the musical soundtrack or foley effects.  The surrounds are used sparingly and primarily for the creation of ambience.  Other than for gunshots at the range, the LFE channel doesn't have a whole lot to do.  While the audio is not bad for this film, I must say I expected more use of discreet directionality.
  EXTRAS....
  There were 3 out takes or bloopers and I liked all 3 but more could easily have been included.  Several alternate or deleted scenes and both an older and new documentary on the making of, real insights into serial killers, trailers more.

Hannibal....
  VIDEO....
  A very nice video transfer with a warm color grading sometimes moving into the reds/orange areas.  Contrast is good, not too harsh and details, while not the sharpest are not bad at all.  I do believe that many of the scenes shot in Italy could have shown a greater number of fine details I can't complain too much.  At no point did I see any artifacts or noise in this film.  Like 'Silence of the Lambs' the Mbps rate is in the high teens/low twenties but, overall, the film looks fine.
  AUDIO...
  Consistent with the same DTS MA HD 5.1 soundtrack there are a few areas where the audio system kicks in with some nice pans across the front stage.  Surround usage is primarily for ambience and not discrete directionality for either the front or rear sound stage.  Overall, the is a greater, more encompassing audio feel to the film than with the other two films in the collection.
  EXTRAS.....NONE unless you count previews of other films as extras.  I don't

All my reviews focus solely upon the quality of the transfer of a film to Blu Ray and do not reflect my opinions about the movie, it acting or plot.  I do hope this review has been of some help to you.
Thanks for reading.",1382227200,8,4315,4.539765319426336
1215842,4,B00000G3R0,"Personally I think that this set should have had Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal.  It would have worked better as the three Hopkins movies, both in terms of flow since Red Dragon ends where Silence of the Lambs picks up, and since Hopkins made the role iconic, having his three films in one set would make more sense.

As it is, this has the 1986 film Manhunter, which was the original adaptation of Red Dragon on film with Brian Cox as Hannibal Lecter.  I know there are those who love that version more than the Hopkins/Edward Norton version, but I am not one of them.  I think Manhunter missed having the actual capture of Lecter which is shown in Red Dragon, and as a result Lecter is left to even more of a cameo role than he was in the remake.  Secondly, the ""Mr D"" character which is developed very well in Red dragon is barely done in Manhunter.  We actually do not even see him until he kidnaps the reporter and get almost none of his interaction with the blind co-worker so their relationship seems very forced.

Silence of the Lambs is of course the Jewel of the collection.  Even 20 years out it still stands up as a great film, and the transfer to blu ray was done about as well as you would expect for a film that old with little to no special effects.  That is the only movie that has any special features.  It has an annotated version of the film where some of the actors would have comments pop up, as well as sidebars throughout.  There are also several behind the scenes features, deleted and extended scenes and a gag reel.

Hannibal, while an okay sequel I think did lack some from losing Jodie Foster.  Although I thought Julianne Moore did a good job with the role of Clarice, it would have benefited from having all the original characters.  Otherwise I though the story was good, if even unbelievable.  Since Hannibal Lecter was supposedly the world's most notorious serial killer, the fact that he was living so openly seems far fetched at best.  But if you can accept that, the rest of the movie is fine.  Hopkins slipped easily back into the role of Lecter, and while the material he had to work with was not as good as in Silence, he still did a great job with the role.  My only disappointment with that disc is there were no extras whatsoever save a few trailers for other movies.

All in all, if you like the books, or just the character of Lecter this is definitely worth getting.  If you are just a fan of Hopkins in the role than you may be better off getting the single disc versions of Silence, Red Dragon and Hannibal, because Manhunter may not be to your liking.",1380931200,,2615,4.374741200828157

The filming, actings and plots are all of very high standard (as concurred with the Oscars won).  Manhunter, the one that starts it all, is equally good though the actings are slightly below par as compared with SOL.  Hannibal is the least attrative among the three, not because of its making or acting but from its rather lack of surprises with 2 such good predecessors in place.

All 3 films transcribed very well into Blu-ray and the price of such nice combination is very acceptable.

Silence Of The Lambs is also not much improvement over upscaled dvd versions, so I give this a 3 stars simply because of the packaging of all three movies.

I have yet to make it through Manhunter, I'd never seen it back in 1986 etc, so it just comes off horribly compared to the fine acting of Hopkins.

Now, back to this BR collection - sure it doesn't have any extras, but at least ""Manhunter"" gets more exposure, and Michael Mann did a brilliant job of it, of making it a cool, 80's iconic movie with the smooth music to boot!, with his slick cinematographic style carrying on the whole Miami Vice feel. To tell you the truth, I loved the movie and still love it and it ranks up there as one of my all time faves - I mean it's the 80's! I grew up through all that! Cool stuff. Brian Cox nails it in this film, and the sanitary, cold cell in this version was right for the time. To go to the dark and dingy in ""Silence"" was right for its time as the whole grunge thing happened in the 90's and that was appropriate for its time. I mean you look at William Petersen's acting style, and subsequent  FBI CSI-tech thing, he made a living on that! How cool is that?

Seriously, SoL is really a modern classic. The acting is first rate from the entire cast. It's worth having if you are the type to re-watch favorite movies from time to time.

""Hannibal"" is a bit more into the overt gore. I don't know that it's art, but, hey, I like it. I'll watch anything with Anthony Hopkins, and nearly anything with Julianne Moore. Ray Liotta makes a great bad guy (lots more moral corrosion than Lecter).

""Manhunter"" is, by comparison, pretty dry stuff. The acting is a bit austere; it seems more like actors going through the motions than getting into their parts. Still, it conveys a story that is useful background for SoL.

""Silence Of the Lambs"" is not bare bones in fact its the identical disc being sold separate with a full assortment of bonus features...and at  times shows off the blu-ray quality but in some of the more muted scenes (and there are many) doesn't seem to be a big improvement over the standard DVD.

I have not played the other two disks in this collection, as I already have Silence of the Lambs and have little interest in Hannibal or Hopkins version of him.

1215953,3,B00000G3R0,"I was really excited when I received this as a Christmas gift from my girlfriend, but I had my expectations too high.  This review isn't based entirely on the films, but more so on what is included and the video quality.  If I were simply reviewing the films, then this would be an easy five star rating.  Unfortunately, this Blu-ray collection falls short.

While I was aware that Manhunter is included in this set, it still doesn't make much sense to me.  I believe Red Dragon should have replaced Manhunter.  First, it's my opinion that Red Dragon is the better all-around film.  Second, Anthony Hopkins face is on the cover and he isn't even in Manhunter, though he plays what seems to be a larger role in Red Dragon.  Hopkins is what originally made this series so special and hyped up for when Hannibal and Red Dragon were coming to theaters.  I just believe Red Dragon makes the trilogy more accurate when combined with Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal.

I'm quite disappointed with the visual quality of this set, mostly when it comes to Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal.  Manhunter, being the oldest of the three, actually looked far superior when compared to the other two films.  For whatever reason, Manhunter was encoded with the superior AVC codec while Silence and Hannibal use the outdated, DVD MPEG2 codec.  Silence and Hannibal have rather awful video transfers.  It's as if I were watching the DVD versions of the two films on Blu-ray discs.  Manhunter actually looks like an average to quite good Blu-ray film, especially coming from a movie created in the mid-1980's.  I was especially excited to see a proper transfer of Hannibal, but my hopes quickly vanished.  It's a beautiful film, though I may as well just watch my original DVD copy.

If you're looking to purchase this set on Blu-ray, then I must warn you that Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal have awful video transfers.  You will not be satisfied if you have grown to love the video quality of many Blu-ray movies, though Manhunter does look very decent.  Sadly, the overall presentation of this set simply appears that the people working on this Blu-ray trilogy didn't put very much time, thought and effort in to it, which is a real shame.  Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal were two Blu-ray films I was very excited to see in true high definition, but it hasn't happened yet.

Still, I've seen it dozens of times over the years (on film, cable television, VHS, DVD) and this Blu-Ray picture is the sharpest I've ever seen it. The night time and darkly lit scenes are crisp; the lights and colors (sometimes used expressionistically) are clearer and show more detail than I've ever seen.

However, this is FAR from an ""anthology"" or even a ""Lector Collection"" as it states on the front cover art.  With a name like ""anthology"" (or ""collection""), you'd expect it to contain (at least) the 4 Major hits:  Hannibal Rising, RED DRAGON, Silence..., & Hannibal..... and IF they wanted to include Manhunter for the heck of it (since it's billed as an ""anthology"" / ""collection""), that's one thing... but,

This travesty has only ""MANHUNTER"", Silence..., & Hannibal.  You got it.... it's a BAD TRILOGY (since it's not even Red Dragon, which is the ONLY one worth watching in my opinion)... it's NOT an ANTHOLOGY (or Collection).  (and is Anthony Hopkins even in Manhunter??!)

What The Heck Are They Thinking!???
Well, I immediately pulled up the order & put in for a return/refund.
Do NOT waste your Money on this junk ""set"", unless you're one of the RARE fans of Manhunter & dislike Red Dragon (because then all you'll need is Hannibal Rising... but if you prefer Manhunter over Red Dragon, chances are, you didn't like H.Rising & this is the perfect ""set"" for you.)

1 STAR for content & false advertising!... But mostly, because ""Hannibal"" is STILL not available by itself (as a US release anyway).

Maybe by the time Red Dragon is released on blu-ray (in the US), Hannibal Rising & Hannibal will be available (in the US) as well?  Here's to hoping....  (and I still don't get why some blu-rays take so long for US release, when their Overseas counterparts have been out for so long).

I would love to have these three movies on blu-ray and can live without Red Dragon and HR.  They were ok, but I don't think I would buy them if all were offered separately.  My major concern here, however, is that all MGM releases so far as I can tell have all been mostly done using the MPEG-2 codec (perhaps with the exception of the James Bond titles which were restored by Lowry, transferred by CBS/FOX, and have all excellent PQ). This is the original DVD codec which almost all blu-ray releases came in late 2006 - and they were all not very good. Great movies like Terminator, Rocky, RoboCop, and Silence were all released using MPEG-2. MGM continues to use MPEG-2 in 2009 when everyone else dropped it in early 2007 for MPEG-4 or VC-1. If MGM can't use a proper technology to transfer their movies to blu-ray, I would recommend waiting to buy them because they will all have to be re-released. I am praying MGM, please no MPEG-2 on this anthology - give them to FOX to do like the James Bond classics, which are all gorgeous.",1252108800,9,1341,4.46530612244898

1215984,5,B00000G3R0,"Great collection of Hannibal Lector films.  ""Hannibal"" wasn't as popular as others in the series, but it was a pretty decent film.  The book, however, was much better and had a different ending, one that would DEFINITELY upset many fans of the films.  Sorry, Clarice, but you were not the smartest person in the room.

The real joy in this set, however, is the added exposure this release gives to 1986's ""Manhunter"", the first film to feature Hannibal Lektor (spelling variation used in that film).  Scottish actor Brian Cox originated the role that Anthony Hopkins made more famous 5 years later, but Cox's take on the character is not to be missed.  Hopkins' Hannibal is imprisoned in a dark and dank dungeon.  Cox's Hannibal is kept in a clean, sterile, all-white cell.  No moody atmospherics used there.  All the menace is in the performance, and there's quite a bit of menace, my friends.

Only question remaining is this:  which version of ""Manhunter"" is it?  There was the theatrical version (later released on VHS and LaserDisc) and no fewer than THREE different cuts of the film released on DVD over the years.  For my money, the cut that was on VHS and LaserDisc (and the last of three DVD versions to be released) is by far the best one.  Fortunately that's the one we get here -- the theatrical cut.

Interesting trivia:  In ""Manhunter"", William Petersen's character rescues Joan Allen's character from the clutches of the Tooth Fairy, this film's VERY creepy villain.  Some 16 years later in Rod Lurie's movie ""The Contender"", Joan Allen's character is indirectly involved in a back-room scheme that publicly destroys Petersen's character's political career.  They are sitting across from each other as the chips fall.  I kept waiting for Petersen to look at Allen and say, ""That's the thanks I get for saving your skinny butt from the Tooth Fairy?  Some gratitude!""  But he never does.

1215986,4,B00000G3R0,"This box is an inconsistent, though very good deal for fans of the movies taken from Thomas Harris' crime novels. But continuity is an issue, if you look at the whole picture.

I have to admit, before getting this set I have never seen the 1986 film ""Manhunter,"" and where it is a very good suspense film, it clashes with the rest of the series. A different Will Graham, a different Hannibal, a different Jack Crawford, et cetera, but it was the first installment to be adapted into a feature-length film, and it stands up nicely on its own. But to the completionist, one who watches a series in order (me, cough, cough), it is recommended to watch this version independently, to  suck it up and use the other one with Hopkins and company in conjunction with the other two in this set.

""Manhunter"" is the story of retired detective Will Graham, trying to rebuild his life after nearly being killed while apprehending Doctor Hannibal Lecktor (note the different spelling), and being called into another extremely dangerous investigation, which police officers jokingly call the ""Tooth Fairy"" case. This story doesn't cover the back story of Francis Dollarhyde (""Dolarhyde"" in the book and other movie), his psyche, or how tortured his relationship was with fellow employee, Reba, a blind woman he dated at the time, it just dives right in to what looks like the later stages, and his attempt at killing her. But it does cover, extensively, Graham's relationship with his family, and particularly his young son. Overall, it is a good movie, as earlier stated, just not consistent with the others in the saga.

The aforementioned two others, of course, would be ""Silence Of The Lambs,"" and its follow-up, ""Hannibal.""

""Silence,"" of course, is the most popular and best-made in the series, and the debut of Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Doctor Lecter. It isn't Lector's first part in the story, just Hopkins first, setting a new standard for film world's most charismatic villian. Long since put away, he is accosted by FBI trainee Clarece Starling in an attempt to help find a serial killer who is killing young victims for a truly macabre undertaking: he is making a body suit, out of human skin. ""Quid Pro Quo."" She is letting him (Lecter) into her psychological make-up, in exchange for his almost clairvoyant insight into the case, he is that good at summing up people. If she lets him see what she's made of, maybe he'll help her catch him.

""WHEN THE FOX HEARS THE RABBIT SCREAM, HE COMES RUNNING...BUT NOT TO HELP.""  I love that line...

""Hannibal"" is the finale of the series, with Julianne Moore in the role of Agent Starling this time, but Clarece is a good ten years older now, so Moore has a fresh perspective; she doesn't have to follow Foster's role to a tee. But she does a remarkable job, easily accepted by the audience as an older Starling, and the film follows her very public fall from grace as orchestrated by one Mason Verger, a hideously disfigured early victim of Doctor Lecter's toying with people he sees as vulgar and expendable. Graphically described in the novel, and only hinted upon in the movie, Verger's disfigurement is compounded with a broken neck, as he was, under the influence of a ""popper"" laced with PCP and who knows what else, demonstrating for the good doctor his practice of autoerotic asphyxiation, which is hanging oneself during self-stimulation, to heighten the experience, but Lecter gave him a piece of broken glass to see if he would, while high on PCP, peel his face off, and feed it to his dogs. The book is WAY more hideous, as Verger says in the book, ""...they pumped the dog's stomach to retrieve my nose, but the graft didn't take...""

Backstories and several characters have been sacrificed from the books  to streamline the narrative of the movies, but they hold up well, and make for some of the best suspense to cross the big and small screen; and these films do hold up very, very well.",1237248000,,3947,4.748905109489051

1215994,5,B00000G3R0,"I bought this with Pepsi Stuff points a few months back and never got to giving it the proper attention it deserved. I originally purchased this collection because of how much I loved Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal Rising, but never saw the other two here.

The first thing I will say, above all else, is that if you have not entered yourself in with Pepsi Stuff yet, do it. It's much better than Coke Rewards and you can get gems in a matter of weeks.

Now, as said before, I avidly loved Silence of the Lambs. Who doesn't, even if they are disgusted? The many quotable lines, memorable acting and enticing story are like crack, for lack of a better term.

I have had my eyes on Manhunter for a long time and, based on what I have heard from others, am very glad they decided to include this underrated masterpiece in with the collection rather than the Anthony Hopkins remake. The undertone of the movie as a whole is truly creepy, which is strange in that such an atmosphere is usually not created in a thriller film. Brian Cox's Lecter (or Lektor, if you pay attention or use subtitles) is surprisingly on par with Hopkins' to a point where it cannot be truthfully described unless you saw it for yourself. If you liked Silence, you will love this movie.

Hannibal I also had been long interested in, however I could not help but worry. And then my fears were confirmed: the movie falls apart in places. Certain things are not explained very well, some you would not understand unless you had read the novel for Red Dragon (or else, like me, looked it up online) and then, well...Lecter just doesn't seem to act like Lecter. He's still cunning, still a little odd, but his oddities seem almost to the point of being purely childish and his overall actions seem to stray away from the intelligently frightening man we came to know in Silence. Despite this, it is still a worthwhile watch.

All in all, I cannot recommend this highly enough if you enjoy movies to any extent. If you drink Pepsi, collect points and get it for free. If you don't and have to buy it, that's fine too. This collection is very cheap and is most certainly moreso than going to a local store and purchasing all of these movies separately.

I. Manhunter (1986): The film starts off from the point of view of a serial killer breaking into a house while his intended victims are all asleep. Suddenly the film shifts to a beach in Florida. Two men are talking about a serial killer. The men are retired special agent Will Graham (William Petersen) and his old partner Jack Crawford (Dennis Farina). Graham was an expert FBI profilist but retired after being attacked by brilliant psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lektor, who turned out to be a serial killer that Graham was hunting down all along. Crawford informs Graham that there is a new serial killer on the loose, dubbed as ""The Tooth Fairy"", and that he has already killed two families. He pleads with Graham to consider coming back to the FBI in hopes of trying to find the killer before he kills again. After careful consideration, Graham says goodbye to his wife Molly (Kim Greist) and son Josh and goes back to the FBI. Graham carefully studies the case file and sees that the Tooth Fairy killed both families in the exact same manner. He inserted mirror shards in their eyes after killing them and even left jagged bite marks on some of them (hence the nick-name). After reaching a dead end, Graham can't find any connection between the two families or why the Tooth Fairy chose to murder them. He decides to consult Dr. Lektor (Brian Cox) who now resides in solitary confinement in a maximum security facility; after all, Lektor did help Graham catch other serial killers early on in his career. Dr. Lektor decides to help Graham and looks at the case file. Graham knows that only Lektor can help him get in the mind of such a bizarre serial killer, but he hopes that he finds him before the next full moon, the only time the Tooth Fairy (Tom Noonan) strikes.

II. The Silence Of The Lambs (1991): The film starts off by showing a young FBI trainee named Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) running through an obstacle course. She is suddenly summoned by Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), head of the FBI division of physchological serial killer profiles. Crawford asks Starling to present a questionnaire to the briliant psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter (now played by Academy Award-winner Anthony Hopkins). Lecter was once a well-respected doctor who helped the FBI track down serial killers, until it was discovered that he was in fact a cannibalistic serial killer himself. Nick-named ""Hannibal the Cannibal"", Lecter was now serving 9 consecutive life sentences in solitary confinement in a Baltimore mental institution. Starling meets with Lecter and finds him to be quite intelligent and polite (despite the fact that he is insane). She presents him with information about a new serial killer dubbed ""Buffalo Bill"". He got his name from the Kansas City Police who theorized that ""this one likes to skin his humps."" All of Bill's victims were heavy-set women. He would abduct them, keep them alive for 3 days before killing them, remove portions of their skin, and then dump their bodies into a river. Starling hopes that Lecter can help her in leading to the capture of Buffalo Bill. Lecter asks Starling to find an ex-patient of his named Ms. Mofet. Through some research, Starling finds that a Ms. Mofet rented out a storage unit in the early 1980s. Upon searching the unit, Starling finds the decapitated head of a male transvestite in a jar of formaldehyde. Starling visits Dr. Lecter again to find out the identity of the head. Lecter informs her that the storage unit was really rented out by his former patient Benjamin Raspail. Raspail had a gay lover named Klaus. Raspail's former lover, Buffalo Bill, killed and decapitated Klaus in a fit of jealousy. When Bill's 6th victim is found, Starling is present at the autopsy and discovers a moth cocoon which was deliberately shoved in the victim's throat. Starling brings the cocoon to the Smithsonian, where it is identified as the cocoon of the Death's Head Moth, named after the striking mark on it's back which resembles a human skull. The strange thing about it is that they are only native to Asia, meaning they would have to be specially bred in the U.S. Later on, Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), abducts Catherine Ruth Martin (Brooke Smith), who happens to be the daughter of Senator Ruth Martin. It is feared that if Catherine is not found within a few days, she will become Bill's next victim. After this event, Starling is assigned to help with the effort to find Catherine. She only hopes that Lecter will give her enough help to save Catherine.

III. Hannibal (2001): The film begins 10 years after Dr. Hannibal Lecter's incredible escape from prison. Barney Matthews (Frankie Faison), the former orderly who watched over Lecter at the Baltimore hospital, is at the home of the horribly disfigured Mason Verger (Gary Oldman). Barney is giving Verger information about Lecter. He also sells him Lecter's original restraint mask for $250,000. Meanhwhile, FBI agent Clarice Starling (now played by Julianne Moore) is in the middle of a sting operation. The operation is botched when Starling kills her intended captive in an act of self-defense. The FBI reprimands Starling for her actions. She is then summoned by Mason Verger. Verger was one of Lecter's original victims (one of two to survive his attacks.) Despite his exceeding wealth, Verger was a brutal child molester. He was referred to Dr. Lecter after being arrested on molestation charges. One night, Verger invited Lecter to his estate. He got drunk and showed him the noose that he used for erotic asphyxiation. Lecter gave Verger mind-enhancing drugs and then convinced him to peel off his own face with a mirror shard. Lecter fed the chunks of flesh to Verger's dogs. Verger also ate his own nose. Afterwards, Lecter broke Verger's neck with the noose. Verger, however, survived only to be reduced to a monstrously disfigured paraplegic dependent on life-support. Verger hopes that Starling can help him to capture the elusive Lecter and bring him to justice. It turns out, Lecter is living in Florence, Italy under the false name of Dr. Fell. Lecter is met by Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini) who is investigating the disappearance of a library curator. Lecter happens to be the curator's temporary replacement. Starling later receives a letter from Lecter. With help from scent experts, she concludes that Lecter is somewhere in Europe. Starling contacts several European fragrance stores (who sell ambergris: a scent found in the letter) in hopes of maybe spotting Lecter in a surveillance tape. After spotting Dr. Fell in Starling's requested surveillance tape, Pazzi discovers that Fell is in fact Dr. Hannibal Lecter. He secretly contacts Mason Verger in hopes of getting a $3 million reward. What Starling doesn't realize is that Verger doesn't wish to bring Lecter to justice, he wishes to put Lecter through unimaginable suffering.

COMMENTS: This is an incredible collection that features the most infamous (and beloved) serial killer ever seen on screen, Dr. Hannibal (The Cannibal) Lecter. The iconic character first appeared in Thomas Harris's novel Red Dragon in 1981. Manhunter is director Michael Mann's film adaptation of Red Dragon. The reason he changed the title was because he feared that audiences would think it was a karate movie. Michael Mann was famous at the time for being the director of the series Miami Vice. The film has a Miami Vice sort of feel to it, through it's use of visuals and soundtrack music. Michael Mann adapated the screenplay himself, but made quite a few changes from Harris's novel. Hannibal Lecter has been renamed ""Hannibal Lektor."" The character of Lecter himself has been extremely down-roled. There is no mention made about him being a cannibal. He only appears on screen for about 6 minutes in the entire film. Mann's script focuses much more on Will Graham and his psychological struggle. Elements of the Tooth Fairy (Francis Dolarhyde) have also been cut out of the script. In Harris's novel, Dolarhyde is obsessed with a William Blake painting called ""The Great Red Dragon and the Women Clothed in the Sun."" Dolarhyde believes that he is controlled by the Red Dragon (Satan). In essence, the Red Dragon is an alternate personality of his. Unfortunately, there is hardly any mention of the Red Dragon or Blake's painting in the film. Mann also extremely watered down the reasons behind Dolarhyde's madness (i.e. his abusive childhood, his insecurity about his hair lip, etc.) Tom Noonan asked that none of the other actors see him until the final confrontation at the climax of the film. This technique turned out to be extremely effective, for the other cast members were really afraid of him. Mann radically changed the ending of the film from the original novel. I thought Harris's ending was much better. I had a hard time accepting Brian Cox as Hannibal Lecter. Although I think he is a tremendous actor, I can't imagine anyone else as Hannibal Lecter other than Anthony Hopkins. As for William Petersen, I think he did a tremendous job as Will Graham. I can't decide whose performance I like better, his or Edward Norton's in the 2002 remake Red Dragon. The film was ultimately a bomb at the box office. It later gained a cult following on DVD, after the other films were released. Director Jonathan Demme decided to adapt Harris's sequel novel, The Silence of the Lambs, to the screen in 1991. Manhunter producer Dino De Laurentiis gave Demme full permission and rights to use the names of characters used in Manhunter; since that film never took off, he had no interest in producing a sequel. Silence was never intended to be a follow-up to Manhunter. Demme wanted to start everything over clean-slate. He actually watched Manhunter before shooting, but decided early on that Brian Cox was not his Hannibal Lecter. The role ultimately went to the actor who made the character immortal, Anthony Hopkins. Ted Tally adapted the screenplay from Harris's novel, and did an extremely faithful job. Demme gave the film an extremely creepy feel. Hopkins' performance is breathtaking. He studied serial killers and fanatics and noticed that they never blinked (Hitler never blinked.) This was a technique that he used in the film, and it was extremely effective. What most people don't realize is that Lecter is only seen on film for about 17 minutes out of the whole film, but thanks to Hopkins' stellar performance, it seems much longer. Ultimately the film won five Oscars for Best Director (Jonathan Demme), Best Adapted Screenplay (Ted Tally), Best Actress (Jodie Foster), Best Actor (Anthony Hopkins), and Best Picture. In the years following, Harris wrote another sequel novel simply titled Hannibal. Since interest in the Lecter character sky-rocketed, original Manhunter producer Dino De Laurentiis re-obtained the rights for adapting Harris's novels into films. He approached director Ridley Scott to take the helm for the new film, Hannibal. Scott said that he would only direct the film if Hopkins returned as Lecter, something he was more than happy to do. Upon reading the novel, the filmmakers knew right away that Jodie Foster would not want to reprise her role as FBI agent Clarice Starling. In Harris's original ending, Lecter and Starling were supposed to run away together, most likely due to romantic reasons. Foster said she would only return if the ending was radically changed; by the time Harris changed it, she had already moved on to another project. Hopkins suggested that Julianne Moore be used as a replacement. Moore gave such a great performance as Starling, that at times I forgot she was a different actress. Released in 2001, Hannibal was a huge success at the box office. Ridley Scott gave the film a much different feel than the one Demme gave to Silence, but that's what I like about it. Technically it is a sequel to the characters from Silence, but in a way the film is almost it's own seperate entity. Gary Oldman was another highlight of the film. Oldman is a brilliant character actor, and I actually had no idea that it was even him until the end credits started rolling. His monstrously hideous make-up is incredible, and that added with his southern accent made him totally unrecognizable. The only film not included in this set is Red Dragon, the 2002 remake of Manhunter. The remake featured Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter, as well as actors who appeared in one or both of the previous two films, including Frankie Faison as the orderly Barney Matthews and Anthony Heald as Dr. Frederick Chilton. The reason it isn't in this set is because it was distributed by Universal Pictures instead of MGM. A prequel film based on a new Harris novel, Hannibal Rising, was released in 2007. It tells the story of the young Hannibal Lecter, and how he became a cannibalistic madman. After Red Dragon, Hopkins announced that he would never portray Lecter again, so unfortunately he wouldn't appear in Hannibal Rising for a brief cameo or even a narrative. All three discs in the this set have had the picture and sound digitally remastered. They are all shown in the original theatrical widescreen ratio. Unfortunately there are very little special features.",1173916800,9,13207,4.947747747747748

The set includes Michael Mann's excellent ""Manhunter"", Jonathan Demme's ""Silence of the Lambs"" and the surprisingly good ""Hannibal"" directed by Ridley Scott. I hate to say it, but Red Dragon was a bomb; it was a pale imitation of Manhunter and I am thrilled that, due to its release by another studio, it has been left out. If you have never seen Brian Cox's performance as Lektor in ""Manhunter"", you will be chilled to the bone. Anthony Hopkins actually seems to have emulated Cox when he first starred as Lektor in ""Silence"". This set is such a deal. ""Manhunter"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"" are true masterpieces and Hannibal does not disappoint - it is Hopkins' film -- a shame that Jodie Foster refused to reprise her role as Clarice Starling in ""Hannibal"". This is your rare opportunity to get the theatrical release of ""Manhunter"" in widescreen. Never, and I mean never, waste money on director's cuts of ""Manhunter"" on DVD. I have seen the director's cut and it is not worth it . . . thankfully it is out of print.",1170028800,35,1080,4.601036269430052
1216044,5,B00000G3R0,"Considering the first two movies, Silence and Hannibal, were released before DVDs were the mainstream media, selling mostly as VHS tapes, and Red Dragon released later as DVD, it's a good idea to have the first two released again together as a DVD set. Such as in my case, I had them on VHS and then the DVD of Red Dragon; now I can get the other two on DVD for a low price and complete the set!

Just as you would not read only the first third of a good book, you should not see Silence of the Lambs without also watching Hannibal and Red Dragon. They are all essential and powerful parts of the Hannibal Lecter story. One should not cheaply judge these films as regular horror movies for their individual entertainment value because they are all part of the masterpiece Thomas Harris has created. I strongly recommend reading the (now four) novels to anyone who would dare criticize the films without doing so.

In my opinion, Hannibal is the greatest of the films, truly portraying Harris' Lecter for all he is, accompanied by Hans Zimmer's amazing original score and beautiful scenery/culture of Italy. Best of all, the movie focuses on the deranged genius Hannibal himself, not using him as an example as in the two other films. The beast is finally out of his cage and he will not be stopped.

I only hope now that the new film Hannibal Rising, to be released February 2007, will be comparable to the beauty of Hannibal, in its photography and in its musical scoring.",1167436800,2,1473,4.550943396226415

1216046,4,B00000G3R0,"I simply can not wait for this collection!

Hannibal Lecter has become such an odd house hold name over the years.

Each movie as well as Thomas Harris' original books are really a breath of fresh air from all of the new horror-shtick Hollywood keeps producing. The one key element that makes this series work is the psychology of the man behind the mask (as it were), but it really became popular with the Help of Anthony Hopkins. His take was truly terrifying while at the same time gentlemanly proper.

With the exception of Hannibal... the stories are really ABOUT Hannibal Lecter. He is used as a catapult, but more often than not, takes the back seat from the main drama. In a way it only adds to the legend by not focusing on him to much (Manhunter =see also ""red dragon"" & Silence of the Lambs). It isn't until the final installment that we actually get a Lecter thriller in and of itself.

I can't wait fot this collection, however I find it odd they wouldn't include Red Dragon. Even though it was a remake of the original ""Man Hunter"" it had the same name as it's book counterpart and it also starred Hopkins as the classic Lecter. Manhunter was released in 1986 and had Brian Cox as everyone's favorite cannibal, but why they didn't include it here is strange to me. After all, if you are going to have a ""collection"" why not include all there is to collect? but still 3 out of 4 isn't bad.

It is worth mentioning that the Silence of the Lambs in this collection IS the special edition that will be coming out the same time as it's release.",1166486400,8,1553,4.397212543554007

1216048,3,B00000G3R0,"I see the word ""anthology"", but I think this word is obviously misused here because the pack really misses some important things!

On many occasions, I have told people that my favorite Lechter movie is Hannibal.  When I ask them which movie was their favorite, they usually state their opinion in a way that sounds similar to this, ""I liked the first one the best.""

So I say, ""You mean 'Manhunter'?""

Then they get a confused look on their face and say, ""Silence Of the Lambs.""

Then I have to explain to them that Lambs was not the first Lechter film; Manhunter was, and it was directed by someone who I find very interesting, Michael Mann.

Michael Mann was responsible for creating Miami Vice, then later directed Manhunter, Heat (with Pacino and DeNiro), the Insider (Pacino and Russell Crowe in his best-acted role), Ali (with Will Smith in the only role he acted in), and Collateral (with Jaime Foxx who won the Oscar for Ray that same year).

Manhunter, co-starring Joan Allen, is an exceptional film because it treats the police detective genre in a more recent contemporary character setting.  It's also the first film I know of that primarily focused so well on the detective's mind during an investigation into serial murders in a contemporary setting.

In the role of Hannibal Lechter, the movie features Brian Cox.  You may have seen Brian Cox playing Hermann Goering in the TNT television movie Nuremburg which is available on DVD, and that movie stars other greats like Christopher Plummer, Max von Sydow, and Alec Baldwin.  Brian Cox also played the lead bad-guy in X-Men 2.

It's funny how many people like Silence Of the Lambs, yet they incorrectly believe it's the first Lechter movie, that Hannibal was the second, and that Red Dragon was the third and a prequel to the other two.  Many people also do not know that Red Dragon was an exact remake of a previously existing film, Manhunter.

Since Manhunter was actually the first Lechter movie, and Red Dragon is a remake of Manhunter, how could Red Dragon advertise itself as a prequel?  If Red Dragon was a remake of a film that was already first in its sequence, it technically can't be a prequel: it's a remake of a film that was already first!

Excluding Red Dragon on the basis that it wasn't comparably good enough to warrant itself, all three of these films are very good films, but all for different reasons.  I also emphatically disagree with people who disliked Hannibal.  Hannibal basically created Lechter out of the drama of Phantom Of the Opera (love story and mask included) and is suspenseful in the classic rendition of Jack the Ripper of the 1940s.  To shame yourselves with that kind of talk never deminishes the greatness of director Ridley Scott, but rather belittles the people who refuse to accept this film as having any greatness when it pulled off that Mamet script.  And on the subject of Ridley Scott, he is one of the top five biggest directors in the last two decades...  Everyone should face facts and get with the program, that this is one of his more brilliant works of art which was better prepared than his Gladiator, and easily much better than his Black Hawk Down.

But disregarding preference, these two DVDs of Hannibal and Lambs are just fine, but my complaint again is the omission of Manhunter, which should have been here!  Also on the subject of this set, I need to note that the great Criterion DVD company released the Silence Of the Lambs in a difinitive, 3-disc DVD edition.  The Criterion edition of Lambs is, as usual, the preferred way to watch this movie for home video.  Criterion has built up a reputation of authority in releasing important films and art films to DVD in thorough editions.  If you go with anything else, you aren't getting everything.

For these above-stated reasons, this ""anthology"" gets a single-handed ""thumbs down"".",1124064000,,3864,4.754122938530735
