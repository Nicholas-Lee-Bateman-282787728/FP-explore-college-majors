8698642,5,B00SJJJTXI,"Any Attenborough DVD is worth its purchase price.  First saw this program on PBS and knew I wanted a copy for my home DVD collection.  If you're interested in the latest technology for photographing dragonflies, butterflies, birds and other flying creatures, you'll enjoy this DVD.",1476576000,,281,5.222222222222222
8698643,5,B00SJJJTXI,"David Attenborough always delivers a good scientific lecture - you wonder at what an amazing world this is, without going into a depression about how we are destroying the world or a long bloody array of animals eating other animals. This dvd is amazing - I didn't know that insects were the first to fly or that flies know whether they are upside down in space or how they make a sharp turn. But when you are looking at a bird fossil and suddenly the bird climbs out of the fossil and flies around the room and you get to see what it was like a million years ago - well if there were an option of 10 stars I would give this dvd an 11. Sky 3D certainly knows how create a demo quality 3D. If all the 3D movies were like this one, everyone would want a 3D player and TV.",1456185600,7,769,4.032679738562091
