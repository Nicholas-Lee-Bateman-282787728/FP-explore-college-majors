3881147,4,B0029W2V9U,"Absolutely hilarious send-up of 1950's monster movies. If you ever watched Creature Double Feature as kid, or loved movies like 'The Blob' and 'Them!"" as much as I do, then you'll love this flick as well. It looks great, and I love all the nice little touches (i.e. separate twin beds for the married couple; or how the husband has one foot on the floor when they do sleep together).",1250640000,2,383,4.485714285714286
3881148,1,B0029W2V9U,"""Homage"" has become an over used term, often interchangable with rip-off. Comedy is by far the most difficult form of film to pull off. Looking at the other reviews ahead of this one I see I am in the minority here so far. I suspect this may be  generational. One Boomer's opinion.
  If you don't read any further, remember this. It is always easier to tare down or lampoon something someone else did than to create something yourself. Cheep shot comedy is only one step above porn. Practically anyone can do it badly. Alien Trespass is THE perfect example.
  With glaring parallels to ""It Came From Outer Space"" this company set off to create a mythological Ed Wood back story to help lead you into this deliberately bad movie. Then they shoot it in impossibly good color hi-def video, destroying their 50s look. The saucer and other SPFX suffered the same problem, over simplistic in design only. Even the big rubber monster was so clean and slick it was impossible to create back in the 50s. It looked too good and was over shown in full daylight. Worst of all was the acting. It was ment to be bad. It is nausiating. But it was not funny. Totally missed the mark.
  The people who watch Attack Of The Crab Monsters,The Killer Shrews, or the original Invaders From Mars just to laugh at them are missing the point. These low budget, drive-in dandies were not ment to be sloppy cheap bad movies. They were not comedies either and the actors never treated them that way. If they got unintentional laughs,so be it. But at the time these modest productions were all there was. Universal was the best with United Artists not so great in production values. But none of these films were deliberately bad by pretending to be funney.
  Two hideous exeptions are the original Little Shop Of Horrors which was knocked off on a bet. And there was a creature or monster or thing ""---- From the Haunted Sea"" (sorry). Both of these Roger Corman (gag) classics were pawned off as horror comedies. The Little Shop has it's moments. The other film is as unwachable as it is forgetable. There are dozens of cheep, incompitant flics out there to jeer at. These stand out only because they totally failed on every point exept making money. Nothing is as unforgivable as a boaring flop of a comedy.
  So wat's your point, man?!!
  The Sci Fi and horror of the 50s and early 60s are invaluable object lessons in something out of nothing dream movies. Film makers should be watching those oldies learning what they did with thousands of dollars in stead of millions of dollars, writing solid stories using real talent. Not more half stoned nobodies swapping trash talk with any bimbo who will take her shirt off.
  ""That was then and this is now. The market has changed.""
  BUNK!!! Familier excuses to sell junk to a jaded market.
  ""No body really takes that stuff seriously anyway. It's just an old movie.""  Right.
  Just an old movie like the original King Kong, Frankenstien, Dracula, The Wolfman, Them, The Creeping Unknown, The Creature From The Black Lagoon, 7nth Voyage Of Sinbad, Jason and the Argonauts, and oh yeah, Star Wars.
  Look Mah! No CGI!  With today's tools there is no excuse for worthless crap movies.
  Want a perfect 50s spoof? See Mars Attacks! Again. And again......
  Alien Trespass is an insult to everything imaginative fiction is about. And it just plane stinks!
  In my opinion.  JPF",1250640000,3,3393,4.65993265993266
3881149,5,B0029W2V9U,"Five stars for what this movie is, a humorous, tongue-in-cheek sendup of the sci-fi films of the 1950's.  To its evocations of other films that other reviewers have mentioned I would add ""The Day The Earth Stood Still.""

If you're old enough to remember the 1950's you will love the verisimiltude in this movie.  The cops' car is a 1953 four-door Model 210 Chevrolet (6-cylinder Blue Flame engine, 115 hp., 6-volt electrical system).  The professor's car is a 1956 Buick Special Hardtop, 220 hp.  My family in Boston had both those models when I was a kid.  You can recall some of the sloppy production on those 1950's beasts when U.S. automakers were on top of the world and let their quality control slip.  If you look closely at the side trim on a scene of a '57 Ford you will see that the pieces don't quite match up.  That was frequently so true back then.

The set dressing of the cafe is delicious.  Look at the signs and the prices!  Also some of the house-interior scenes.  Brought back memories.

All and all this film is a light, good and nostalgic evening's entertainment.",1250467200,7,1084,4.55440414507772
3881150,4,B0029W2V9U,"There is a certain member of movie fandom that loves old movies. And each genre has its own devotees. Classic musical fans love the MGM musicals. Horror fans the Universal classics. And science fiction fans love those bug eyed monsters invading earth from the stars. The film ALIEN TRESPASS pays homage to those films while placing a tongue firmly in cheek.

The story begins (in the extended version) with the grandson of the film's producer and the grandson of the film's star introducing the picture. Of course they carry on the fight that began with their grandfathers over the film and then allow it to begin. The film had been shelved for years and now they'd decided to release it.

The story begins with astronomer/professor Ted Lewis (Eric McCormack) watching the skies while cooking on the grill as a meteor shower begins. But when a large meteor lands nearby, he abandons his wife at home to investigate.

As we already know, the meteor was actually a spaceship crashing. And while we watch, an alien in space gear exits the ship and wanders about. When Lewis shows up, his mouth opens to scream but before we can hear the scene changes.

Cut to lovers lane where teens Dick and Penny are parked. They have seen the crash as well but think it was just a meteor. As Penny pushes away Dick's advances and encourages him to leave the area, they are confronted by a 6 foot tall, one eyed, tentacled creature. The care starts and they escape. But who to tell? No one will believe two teens in the 1950's.

The local police think it's all a prank when people begin missing and the teens tell their tale of a monster on the loose. But all the while Lewis, now possessed by the alien, hunts down this monster. With the help of waitress and aspiring artist Tammy, he tracks down the alien and explains what is going on.

It turns out the alien's name is Urp and he was transporting the Ghota to a prison planet when it forced his craft to crash. Now they have just a few hours before the Ghota divides and begins a quest for world domination based on its hunger. They only have a small amount of time to save the planet, but how can they do so with no help from the local law?

The movie plays it straight as if this actually was a film made during the science fiction craze of the fifties. Everything from the sets to the styles to the acting screams low budget B-movie cheese. The people who made those films truly thought they were making something special, which we now can recognize that they did. At the same time they were making some of the campiest messes ever placed on celluloid.

The movie doesn't knock those early films though. Instead it is paying tribute to the films that came before, giving a wink and a nod to film buffs along for the ride. The actors actually act as we recall the actors from that time period acting in these films. The monster is extremely low budget looking but functional. Amazingly enough the only thing that doesn't look lifted from that time period is the cinematography.

McCormack does a great job as grandfather/grandson. While the elder of the two spoke as if he was the greatest actor alive, McCormack shows his pompous side as is that of his grandson. Robert Patrick shows up as an obnoxious sheriff who takes the teens in town to task just for being young. Dan Lauria turns in a steady performance as the town sheriff who doesn't believe but begins to do so as the body count rises and pools of goo are left in the wake of the Ghota.

Directed by R. W. Goodwin who wrote several period piece episodes of THE X-FILES, the film shows his love of movies like THE BLOB and IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE with a touch of I MARRIED A MAN FROM OUTER SPACE tossed in. You get the sense he has a true admiration of the genre and perhaps can encourage a new generation to seek them out.

ALIEN TRESPASS isn't a perfect film. It also might not be for certain tastes. But it does offer an entertaining evening for rental that the entire family can watch together. Fun, homage and the confrontation between man and alien make for a film worth watching.",1249948800,68,4085,4.462466487935657
3881151,5,B0029W2V9U,"I was quite interested in seeing this film after the ads started a few months ago, and I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. Amazingly, I just watched one of the clearest Blu titles since this format started, and regardless of the retro content (both supplements and film) the modern BD clarity was perfect.

The whole made-in-the-50s feel, acting and effects (love the Flash Gordon-esque sparkler effect on the falling ship) were a great homage to the industry. Funny as it sounds, Robert Patrick was performing the best I have seen (for him in a film) in years - he also manages to acknowledge that twice in the supplement interviews. We have a small 1950s town besieged by a crash-landed alien, played by Eric McCormack (an interesting change from Will & Grace). One of his critters manages to turn people into water, and the sheriff, played by Robert Patrick, tries to save the day.

Picture quality and DTS sound - wow. Supplements are more a mixed bag but still fun. The Burrows interviews are split into two film stock degraded segments (10:30 and 8:00 minutes) showing retro interviews of the actors still in character as if they were from the 50s. The Breaking News and Live news clips last a few minutes and are equivalent to being trailers with a quick news feed feel. The interviews with Goodwin and McCormack total eight minutes and cover some of the back story and character material. Goodwin stated he wanted to make something fun that people would laugh at, and he has succeeded. Two more trailers round out the extras.

I would have liked to see more on the actual making-of and how they got the picture to look so good, but this film can easily stand as a five star Blu on content alone. No shortage of great cars and props either.",1249516800,3,1751,4.660194174757281
3881152,4,B0029W2V9U,"When I saw that this movie was playing at a old time theater that my wife and I used to go to when we were first married in the 70's, sounds fun, lets go see it. Popcorn, drink, a real balcony and a 50's style sci-fi movie, what could be better. And for the actors, real ""B"" quality.  For the most part, a real homage to sci-fi. Blob and It Came from Outer Space comes to mine. Unfortunately, Eric McCormack in trying to act like a 50's B actor, over acted his part. He seems to be posing. Look I'm Richard Carlson, no I'm Hugh Marlowe, no I'm Grant Williams, etc. Lot of fun at the theater. You can go back. Not sure if the prerelease price is worth it ($19.49).

Unfortunately, this falls apart from sheer amateurishness. The script is lame. It's slow and it drags. There are some good scenes that almost build to something interesting or funny, then the script and dialog just fizzles and stalls.

This is a salute to those 1950's sci fi films.  In fact  it has facets of both 'it came from outer space', the body snatchers' and the blob in it. The story concerns a space marshall alien who takes over a doctor and comes to earth to battle blob like creatures with big eyes.  The effects are a cross between the fifties and later though.  It's a fun film and I wouldn't say it's a comedy , but it is humorous.  The blu ray looks stunning as this is a newer movie , mine of course had 3d.

3881300,5,B0029W2V9U,"One of the goofiest restaurants in all of Walt Disney World is the Sci-Fi Drive-In Theater Restaurant, in which families sit in fake old-fashioned cars as if they're at a fake drive-in, watching clips from real sci-fi movies that replicate, in the silliest possible way, the campy appeal of all the alien movies from the 50s. It's a fun experience, if you're a child or a parent who remembers all the rubber-suit aliens and theremin music from movies like It Came From Outer Space and The Blob. But it also comes with milkshakes and fries.

Some snacks, or maybe a stiff drink, might have also increased the fun level for Alien Trespass, a deeply silly movie that pays homage to the 50s classics in a way that would be welcome at Disney World. Director R.W. Goodwin and writer Steven P. Fisher have concocted a deadpan homage to the flying saucers of the past, and while it's clear they love this genre a whole lot, there's no telling what exactly we're supposed to appreciate about it. Sure, the overblown dialogue and deliberately bad special effects are fun for a while, but watching the trailer for the original Day the Earth Stood Still would probably give you the same amount of laughs.

The production is lucky to have found Eric McCormack to play the lead, jutting out his square jaw and playing both the dashing astronomer Ted and the alien creature Urp, who takes over Ted's body when his spaceship crashes outside a desert California town. But Urp isn't alone-- he's accompanied by a big blue monster called a Ghota, and while the Ghota chews its way through most of the town's innocents, Urp and a clever waitress named Tammy (Jenni Baird) try to track him down and save the world.

This small town is populated by all kinds of oddballs, including an intense cop played by typically intense Robert Patrick, a weathered cop played by typically weathered Dan Lauria, and a gaggle of fresh-faced teenagers who seem to be giving deliberately bad performances. They and a handful of others are threatened, and some devoured, by the Ghota, and if there are any other subplots beyond that one, I've already forgotten them by now, a few days after the screening.

One subplot does stick, being Tammy's desire to get out of town and make something of herself. Either because Baird is so gifted or because Tammy is the only character who seems remotely real, her emotional connection to Ted/Urp sticks with you, and her moment of triumph at the end genuinely sweet. On the other hand there's Lana (Jody Thompson), Ted's sexpot wife, who makes bedroom eyes at the camera and seems shoved into frame directly from a pinup.

Alien Trespass might have been able to capture a little more of that innocent monster movie fun if it had stuck with effects more like the Ghota, which is a goofy rubber suit making no attempts at realism. But the flying saucer at the beginning is CGI, as are occasional flames, and the movie's claim of being a ""forgotten classic"" gets less believable as the effects start looking more realistic. CGI is probably cheaper now than even the worst looking fake blood of yesteryear, but the cheesy special effects were always a key part of the fun.

There's fun to be had in Alien Trespass, especially for anyone who's already seen all the old classics and is dying for a new one. But most anyone else would probably be better served watching one of the actual originals.",1393372800,,3392,4.702020202020202

The serio is the way the characters treat every corny line just like they did in the 50's and 60's. The comedy is that the characters treat every corny line just like... well, you get the point!

Color is excellent, the cinematography is excellent and reflective of super saturated 50's color. They didn't get all the props quite right (another spoof) and the monster is plenty cheesy.

The only thing that disturbed me was the ""puddles"" (you have to watch the movie to see where they come from) looked too much like cat puke, and being a cat owner, I see far too much of that already!

This is definitely worth a viewing for fans of Eric McCormick (of ""Will and Grace"" fame) doing a Richard Carlson imitation, but more so for the homage the movie pays to the sci fi movies that thrilled a generation of kids on Saturday matinees. Bug eyed monsters, Klaatu- like aliens, outrageous puns, and a BIG nod to ""The Blob"" make this a fun and worthwhile flick. They also somehow managed to re-capture some of the wonder that these old movies had for me when I was a child.

3881332,4,B0029W2V9U,"Last night we watched 'Alien Trespass' on Amazon Prime videos. It's a 2009 film that attempts to pay homage to the great old sci-fi films of the 50s and early 60s. I'm happy to say it succeeded, this is an entertaining movie.

I've seen a number of films in recent years that wanted to spoof or emulate the 50s sci-fi B-movie classics. They only partially succeeded or failed miserably.  This one did a good job. It was humorously reminiscent of films like 'The Blob' and 'It Came From Outer Space'.  In fact there's a scene near the end that takes place in a theater that is showing 'The Blob'. What happens almost parallels what's on the screen in that theater. The first part of the film starts with a sort of 1950s B/W news reel about the making of the movie and it's being shelved by the studio chief. I just wish they had more fully explained why it was shelved. Then it proceeds to show the movie.  If I had to criticize, I guess I would say that some of the dialog was too contemporary and would not have appeared in a 50s film.  Also, it might have been more effective if the whole movie was in B/W instead of color. Still, I guess there were some films back then in color like 'The Blob' for instance.  I also read this about the use of color ""Alien Trespass's saturated color was inspired by the original The War of the Worlds (1953) - one of Goodwin's favorite sci-fi films"". The bottom line is it was l a fun romp.  It's not done completely straight and does have a lot of humor in it, also some fun scares.  The monster from space is a hoot and looks very appropriate.  I particularly like the eerie background music complete with weird sounding chorus, it's hard to describe, you'll know what I mean when you hear it.  It's music you might have heard in films like 'I Married a Monster From Outer Space', another favorite film hinted at here. The dialog was good and the acting was professional. I believe the main reason other films that attempted this sort of tribute failed was poor amateurish acting and low budgets.  This instead featured fine talents including  Eric McCormack (of 'Will and Grace' fame), Dan Lauria, and Robert Patrick.  They also had a budget that could do justice to the atmosphere they were trying to create with 50's-era cars, dress, and settings.

If you love the old 50s early 60s sci-fi/horror classics the way I do, I'm sure you will enjoy this movie.  I highly recommend it to my fellow sci-fi fans.",1386633600,,2446,4.452914798206278
3881333,2,B0029W2V9U,It's a weak spoof. The effects were not up to the standards of the 50's and shouldn't. To compare it to the Blob was not even close.,1386633600,,132,3.925925925925926
3881334,2,B0029W2V9U,"Well, the 4 and 5 star reviewers were being very generous.  Although the acting was very good, it was obvious the alien creature was a knock-off from the old 50's classics and lacked the expertise of today's alien creature creators.

Quite frankly, I still kept watching it and the truth is - it was pretty good if you realized that it is campy and a tribute to fright movies from the past. I enjoyed it when it was all done. I may even show it to friends who can appreciate what they're looking at.

The ""special effects"" were intentionally low tech, and the dialogue was downright cringe-worthy.  The cinematography was cheesy and right out of the 1950s creature double features.  In that respect, Alien Trespass gave an intentional nod to the American International Pictures (AIP) films of the 1950s, such as ""I Was a Teenage Werewolf"" and ""Invasion of the Saucer Men,"" which were aimed at teenage audiences and churned out en masse for Saturday afternoon double features.

Being a fan of 1950's Sci Fi movies, I got what they were trying to do here and actually enjoyed it.  I look at this movie as a tribute to the those 1950's B Sci Fi movies.  It was intentionally made that way.  I pictured it being how a film was made in the 50's.  Same direction, acting, filming and yes, cheesy alien monster.  It is also set in the 1950's, which makes sense as a tribute.  I would not have worked in any other time period.  I give them credit for the costumes, sets and cars.  Very authentic.  If you watch this movie for what it is and look at it as though you are watching a B movie from the 1950's it is quite enjoyable.  If you are expecting Independence Day or the like, then it is not the movie for you...",1372896000,,843,4.036363636363636

3881385,4,B0029W2V9U,"It's 1957 and science fiction movies are all the B rage. Aliens are landing and small town folks are running wild. Special effects involve cardboard and mirrors. And actors appear in plastic alien suits.
Welcome to Alien Trespass, a movie we are told that was reportedly canned after lead actor Eric McCormack and MGM Studios could not come to a contractual agreement for its release.

In reality, Alien Trespass is an homage to the B science fiction movies of the 1950's. But it's so much more than that. It's funny and brilliant and never too over the top. Even with the cardboard sets and aliens in plastic costumes.

The story begins in star-filled skies somewhere in California's Mojave Desert. It is a special night for noted astronomer Ted Lewis, who is preparing a special dinner for his beautiful, adoring wife Lana to celebrate their wedding anniversary. Meanwhile, a fiery ball hurtles towards earth and crash-lands nearby. Of course, Ted has to take a look, and next thing we know, Ted has been possessed by an alien known as Urp. Urp is on a mission to find an escaped alien, the monstrous Ghota, before it destroys the world as we know it.

This movie was recommended to me via Netflix instant streaming. It is not so much Mars Attacks as it is Forbidden Planet or The Day The Earth Stood Still. In fact, the 1950's feel of the movie is so well done that you tend to forget that this isn't actually a film from that decade. The actors, especially McCormack, give performances that could have been given by any of the great science fiction actors of the time. And the sets and costumes are simple and perfect. Even the dialogue feels authentic. This film just works.

I've read that some critics, including Roger Ebert, didn't like the film or understand the need for a 1950's science fiction tribute film in our day and age. I don't think those critics got it. This is entertainment, pure and simple, and takes us back to a time when film directors understood that. This is one of those movies that at some point just may very well have its own cult following.

To sum up, Alien Trespass is not only a glorious tribute, but also entertaining science fiction fun.",1372809600,,2176,4.641558441558441

3881396,4,B0029W2V9U,"If you were setting out to make a 50s monster movie, how would you approach it?

1. Set it in the 50s, but film it in modern filmmaking techniques (basically ""Happy Days"")
2. Set it in the 50s and keep the filmmaking style true to the era (basically ""Destination Mars""), so that anyone watching it might think it was made in the 50s.
3. Do #2, only go outside the constraints and rules of period when it makes sense to do so (basically ""The Artist"")

This film chose #1 and does a fine and entertaining job of it.

Personally, I would have chose #3 and have it appear as a true 50s production, yet going outside of its constraints where it would add power. For instance, 50s monster movies had big fake rubber-y monsters and this film has big fake rubber-y monsters. While this choice is good for a campy chuckle, I think it would have been more interesting to have had convincingly real monsters - just as I believe those directors in the 50s would have preferred to have had. How fun would it be for an audience to watch a film they believe is from the 50s, only to see effects that couldn't possibly have been pulled off at the time?",1369440000,,1136,4.323943661971831

But all in all, if you're looking for a movie to watch with The Kids or a simple dinner movie, this one is a-o-k.

As a send-up of all the 50's Sci Fi horror movies, this works, but not very well. But it is a marvelous snapshot of the styles and colors of the 50's from a Life magazine point of view.

The acting is wooden, the special effects are pitiful and it's very hard to care about any of the characters, which for me, applies to most of the 50's type Sci Fi movies.

Its screenplay was a reasonable facsimile of '50s sci fi, which unfortunately comes across as stilted (i.e., boring) nowadays.  The period costumes, vehicles, etc., were nice touches, but intended ambience was lost because modern cinematography is so advanced compared to what we see in The Blob, for instance. Washing out colors a bit, plus modest use of blur and noise filters would have helped.

The film makers had a strange sense of comedy, spoof or otherwise. Offing a few good old boys was standard fare in the genre, circa 1950s, and/or mouthy teens, but not moms and children. Conversely, the way those cops reacted as monster reports kept mounting WAS funny. Mostly they reacted by sitting around and complaining. Eventually the Chief got worked up enough to go get some coffee at a restaurant, where he sat down and complained. Problem here is: was humor intended?

Will the alien hero follow through on his (totally unfamiliar and confusing) feelings for the beautiful human heroine? And the dog?

As a boy I remember the old Saturday morning Flash Gordon cliff-hangers that left the audience wondering if Flash would survive his latest perilous situation. Later as special effects and the writing improved the movies progressed as well and the length of the feature increased.

The 1950's got off to a good start with the movie ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" in 1951; a pinnacle was reached in 1956 with the production of ""Forbidden Planet,"" this was a movie that raised the bar on sci-fi movies forever. It made such an impact on me that I never forgot it and still rank it as special.

It's what those 50's  movies wanted to be. The production values are decent except for the alien monster. In the 50's it would have been a top notch special effects job but in this day and age it really looks as bad to us as the creatures in the 50's did. Perhaps they meant it to be hokey.

Had I known at the time that Alien Trespass was shot on 16mm I might've made a different purchase altogether. Alien Trespass doesn't need to be on Blu-Ray IMO, it looks just fine on DVD. More than fine considering its 16mm origins. As a matter of fact, the DVD version looks little less processed than the Blu-Ray. The Blu-Ray version has a glossed over sheen reminiscent of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (or even Final Fantasy, which is not live action, but the Blu-Ray version is that glossy). It's not hugely bothersome--you watch it, you get used to what you're watching. It's pretty.

What really gets my ghota is that the Blu-Ray is missing one of the most amusing features on the DVD: the introduction, where Eric McCormack and Jeremy Goldstone attempt to introduce Alien Trespass, but their introduction soon turns into a fight. I feel cheated. I paid a premium for the Blu-Ray and the Blu-Ray actually has less than the DVD. Don't be cheated. Get the DVD. The DVD is worth five stars.",1313539200,7,1180,4.587677725118484

It contains absolutely perfect period wardrobe, acting and story line... And the cars, diner, neighborhoods, and attention to 50s details were dead on... What a hoot!!

The film was a combination of 50's Sci Fi and just a whiff of tongue in cheek.  As such, it could have easily come up short of either goal and been an abysmal failure, but the film makers, directors, staff and cast walked a fine line and pulled it off adroitly.

Highly recommended for anyone who enjoyed the early sci films - it is really a shame it didn't get wider distribution, as it is a most enjoyable movie.

3881464,4,B0029W2V9U,"Marketed as a real movie that was lost in 1957 that was recently discovered in a construction site, ALIEN TRESPASS is a beautifully shot and decently written homage to the sci-fi movies of the 1950s and early 1960s.  In an unnamed western (they have buttes) American small town, Dr. Ted Lewis (Eric McCormack) and his gorgeous wife Lana (Jody Thompson) celebrate their wedding anniversary.  Dr. Lewis is an astronomer and not only is tonight his wedding anniversary, but it's the night of a special meteor shower.  Across town, single waitress Tammy (Jenni Baird) paints while watching an appearance of Dr. Lewis on tv and almost drools on herself over the dreamy gumdrop she sees on screen.  Meanwhile, across town teenage heartthrobs Penny (Sarah Smyth) and Dick (Andrew Dunbar) are making out at The Point.  All of these individuals witness the fiery crash of what appears to be a meteorite into one of the buttes just outside of town.  Everyone assumes the flaming object is a meteorite and no one investigates until early in the morning.

Of course, the object in question isn't a meteor, but an alien spaceship that has crash landed on Earth.  Unknown to Earthlings, the ship has crashed because of a maleficent one-eyed creature that sabotaged the ship's operating system.  This alien, the Ghota, is capable of turning itself invisible and eats other living creatures, leaving a mixture of water and primordial goo behind.  However, the pilot of the ship, Urp, is a different creature altogether.  He looks something like Gort from THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL.  Before the sun has even risen, Dr. Lewis arrives at the butte to investigate and disappears in the spacecraft.  When he exits he's not at all himself.  His wife thinks he's sick and he keeps rambling about his mission and how he has to capture the Ghota.  Meanwhile, Penny and Dick have a run in with the Ghota and report it to the police, but no one believes them.  Reports come in about missing people and piles of watery goo.  Other reports come in reporting Dr. Lewis's strange behavior.  The people of the town have to figure out if Urp is friendly or hostile while at the same time dealing with the alien destruction caused by the Ghota.

The acting in ALIEN TRESPASS is decent.  The writing was definitely inspired by the ""B"" sci-fi films of the 1950s and 1960s.  The strongest point about the movie are the costumes, props, and set pieces.  The movie has captured the early 1950s right down to the smallest detail.  Cars, shoes, toys, and kitchen appliances are all accurate.

Unlike some other movies in recent years that have spoofed or parodied classic sci-fi films, e.g. THE LOST SKELETON OF CADAVRA, ALIEN TRESPASS is not a spoof or parody but an homage of the classic sci-fi films of the 1950s and early 1960s.  Watching the movie you can feel the love that went into recreating the mood and feel of those classic sci-fi films.  There is humor here, but it's intentional and heartfelt, not heartless.  And that's the rub of the matter.  Unless a person is familiar with the style of movie that ALIEN TRESPASS is paying homage to, they are likely to find the movie either hilarious or humorless.  There are so many subtleties that can be overlooked if one is not familiar with films such as INVADERS FROM MARS, WAR OF THE WORLDS, IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE, and THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL.

I enjoyed watching ALIEN TRESPASS.  It's a movie that families can enjoy watching together (I had to laugh when I saw that one of the reasons its rated PG is because of brief historical smoking!) and fans of the classic sci-fi movies of the 1950s and early 1960s will probably especially enjoy it.

The DVD includes several special features.  The movie was marketed as though it was an actual movie made in 1957 that was recently discovered so several of the features revolve around that.  There's an optional introduction, the usual director's commentary, interviews with the ""1957"" cast, television newsreels, and a special discovery/making-of featurette.  In addition there's a short interview with director R.W. Goodwin, a short interview with star Eric McCormack, and two trailers for the movie.",1294790400,,4176,4.825597749648383

The producers were trying to parrot the old 1950s-1960s Sci-Fi creature features that were so great when we were kids, but seem so melodramatic now. They could have made Alien Trespass hilarious--but it isn't. It's too nonsensical to be serious, and too serious to be funny.",1283126400,,449,4.8311688311688314
3881466,4,B0029W2V9U,"Okay - why did I rate it so high?

Three reason;
#1 - It doesn't not intend, nor does it try, to take itself seriously. It is a 'serious' parody of the classic sci-fi films of the 40's, 50's and 60's. It made me smile many times and even laugh out loud at how many of the older films in this genre really did these gimicks. (And they WERE taking themselves very serious!)

#2 - It's colorful. Watching this farse of a parody makes the colors jump at you from the screen. The costumes, cars, sets, props and even the decore are all smack out of 50's Life Magazine. You can't help but look at everything in the frame.

#3 - Eric McCormack - Always a fan of his in the 'Will & Grace' TV show - I feel he was taking a very serious approach to the project. 'Playing' it as if it were real and being shot in the 50's. Playing a duel role - Im sure he had a greta time doing it.

In fact he did. How do I know - he told me at a pannel at the 2009 Comic Con convention for the Alien Tresspass assembly. Along with the director and orginal artwork from the film - they gave the information and great detail as to what went into it.

The story is simple: Aliens need humans for food. An alien policeman is defending Earth from invasion and he is in the form of a human he takes over (surprise!) - Eric McCormack. Of course he......well I don't want to ruin it for you!

I can appreciate the performances and the people on the production side very much, but watching made me look at some of the old classic films (Forbidden Planet, Them, The Fly, The Day The Earth Stood Still) and wonder - did they know what they were making at the time?

I liked it for its pure non-sensical form, mimicking style and bright colors. I think you will too.  6-8-10",1275955200,25,1737,4.103244837758112
3881467,4,B0029W2V9U,"Yes, it's a 50s camp movie. But it's so much more than that. The contrasts are sharply drawn when you take notice of the fact that this is a homage to 50s sci-fi flicks but filmed in high-def. Similar to Quentin Tarantino's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grindhouse/dp/B000R7HY0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grindhouse</a>&nbsp;series homage to the blood-and-guts films of the 70s, ALIEN TRESPASS pulls no punches in letting us see ""the cheese"" that accompanied these campy movies from 60 years past.

And the homage doesn't just stop at the style of the film. Many references to 50s flicks come up. Most notable is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blob/dp/B00004W3HE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blob</a>, where we've got a collection of people in a theater (trapped!) where an alien attack is about to take place (most sci-fi buffs will see this coming a mile away, but it's still cool to watch).

The great thing, too, about Alien Trespass is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. The main character Ted Lewis (Eric McCormack,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dead-Like-Me/dp/B00094ARGY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dead Like Me</a>) gets ""inhabited"" by the spirit of an alien who's ship crashed. This alien's name is (wait for it) ...Urp. And he's an intergalactic marshal. And he has a shoot out with a deputy. Any of this ringing a bell? Think ""Earp"".

With tongues firmly in their cheeks, but playing it straight, the entire cast really pulled in a very fun movie to watch. Even the interviews on the DVDs are done in such a way that we're led to believe these new actors are family members of the ""original"" actors who starred in the supposedly destroyed film, Alien Trespass. Yes, there's a documentary-style film-within-a-film, even before the actual movie begins. Kind of like the way&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tropic-Thunder/dp/B001H5X7KC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tropic Thunder</a>&nbsp;started but bent more toward the appropriate era here.

I also enjoyed the overt sexuality simmering beneath the surface for Ted and his cleavage-enhanced wife, Lana (Jody Thompson). But there's no physical sexuality seen and only the great fade-to-black shots we were all used to seeing whenever something tasty was about to happen between men and women during films of the 50s.

DVD extras are quite plentiful, with faux-interviews that are hysterical, and an insightful interview with director, R.W. Goodwin (X-Files).

Having said that, the movie is not nearly as clever as it could have been.  At the same time as it fondly remembers those old movies, it feels more like watching someone do something he/she is passionate about, rather than inspiring that same passion within the viewer.  The wonder and (even cheaply created) horror of space aliens is wholly absent in this film.

While the technical and acting aspects of this film are charming as they pay respect to older films, this movie fails to draw viewers in and include them.

3881471,4,B0029W2V9U,"ALIEN TRESPASS starts with a black and white newsreel called, ""News from around the world.  Nov. 21, 1957.""  The voiceover says, ""At Cape Canaveral, another probe into space--target the moon.  A 52 ton multi-stage rocket combining elements of the Thor ICBM and the Vanguard is ready for firing.""  The next newsreel continues with the outer space theme by showing Santa Claus in a flying saucer at a Christmas parade in Allentown, PA.  We see a little girl crying at the parade.  The next part of the newsreel documents the cancellation, by Hollywood moguls, of the release of ALIEN TRESPASS.

FLYING SAUCER LANDS IN THE DESERT.  Then the actual movie begins and it is in color.  The movie proper starts in the apartment of a young woman, Tammy.  She's doing a little painting of a horse while watching, on television, an interview with an astronomer.  Then the woman looks up to see a meteor shower outside her window.  Then the movie cuts to two teenagers making out in an automobile, and they see the meteor shower too, as well as a flying saucer crash landing nearby.  We then see the door of the flying saucer open, and a squid monster comes out and eats a coyote.  Next, a silver-garbed alien comes out.  He is nine feet tall, just like the Kanamits in TO SERVE MAN, a famed episode from the Twilight Zone.  But the silver-garbed alien is good, as his mission throughout the film is to hunt down and capture the dangerous squid monster.  (We are never really told why the alien had the squid monster in the first place, though this is not really important to the story.  All we are told is that the Ghotas had disabled the plasma injectors on the flying saucer.)

The opening minutes of this film contains a very clever cinematographic transition:  The nerd-like astronomer is chatting with his bride, and ignores the barbeque in the back yard.  In an instant, the steaks catch on fire and flames rise upwards from the barbeque grill.  Then, the movie cuts to the crash-landing of the flying saucer, just beyond a hill in the desert.  We see a flurry of flames rising from just beyond the hill.  The flames from the barbeque and from the crash-landing take on the same configuration.

COMIC RELIEF IN CAF.  Comic relief comes from banter between an older policemen (Vernon) and a young, new policeman (Barney) in a caf.  ""No, no, that's not it.  PPP is proper police procedure,"" says Vernon.  ""PPD is an unknown DUA.""  Barney replies, ""But I though that was a PPK.""  ""No,"" interrupts Vern,"" PPK is what you do behind a tree after you see a stiff.""  More comic relief comes from teenagers in the caf.  A first teenager wants to go out to the desert to find and view the crashed saucer.  But a second teenager prefers to stay in town to see a display of a new model of Ford automobile called an Edsel.  The first teenager replies, ""Edsels will be around forever, but this won't."" (Baby boomers will remember that the Edsel was the least successful automobile model in history, and it became a household word meaning a failed invention.)

THEME OF SALT.  Early in the film, the pipe-smoking astronomer goes to the crash site, and enters the saucer.  But the alien captures him and occupies his body.  The alien then drives into town and befriends the astronomer's lovely new wife and, at a later point in the story, Tammy the waitress.  The wife and Tammy kiss the alien, at different points in the story, and the alien observes his sensation as ""hormonal polarity.""  The alien sits at the breakfast table at the astronomer's home and tinkers with a salt shaker.  ""This will harm the Ghota,"" exclaims the alien to the lovely wife.  This is where the theme of salt makes its first appearance.

REDNECKS IN PICKUP TRUCK.  More comic relief comes from two likeable rednecks (Lloyd and Bubba) in a pickup truck, as they drive through the desert.  A radio announcement proclaims, ""Friends, do you have tired blood?""  Lloyd turns the radio down.  ""Hey Lloyd, leave it on,"" complains Bubba.  ""It's all trash,"" says Lloyd.  ""I want to hear it, I think I've got tired blood.""  Lloyd responds, ""No, you've got lazy blood, there's a difference.""  The radio continues, ""Do you have that run-down feeling?""  Bubba then says, ""I think I've got that run down feeling.""  To this, Lloyd exclaims, ""If you so much touch that radio, I'm going to throw you out of the truck and you're going to have that run over feeling.""  At this point, a Ghota appears, and the Ghota first eats Bubba, and then it eats Lloyd.

FURTHER PLOT DEVELOPMENT.  The teenagers get more interested in the flying saucer, and one states that he has a new invention, the Polaroid camera, useful for taking photos of the crashed saucer.  Another teenager, his friend, is confused as he'd never heard of Polaroid cameras, so he answered, ""a paranoid camera""?  Then, there is a domestic scene in a house where a young boy and his older sister get attacked by a Ghota, but escape.  The policemen, Vernon and Barney arrive at the scene.  But Vernon who investigates inside the house, gets eaten by a Ghota.  This domestic scene has all kinds of subtle nuances, and many examples of excellent acting and scriptwriting.

MORE SUBTLE PLOT DEVELOPMENT.  This scene takes place on the lawn in front of a house.  A little girl is scared of imaginary bears.  Her mom tells her not to play wolf.  But moments later, a Ghota appears and eats both of them.  The scriptwriters certainly know how children speak and think!

Mommy! Mommy!

Betsy, what is it now?

Mommy, there's bears out here. They're trying to eat me.

Remember what happened to
the little boy who cried wolf?

But it wasn't a wolf.

It was a bear.

(A moment later, a Ghota appears and eats the mom and child, though the viewer is spared seeing the actual attack.  All we see is the slimy liquid residue of both victims on the lawn.)

MORE ON THE SALT THEME.  We are treated to some local color in the cafe.  At an early point the cook puts a meal on the kitchen counter and proclaims, ""Number 5, dry and dirty!""  At a later point in the movie, the same cook puts a meal on the kitchen counter and proclaims, ""Number 5, number 2, hot and sweaty.""  (I am not sure what ""hot and sweaty"" means, but it seems to be an interesting tidbit of cook's lingo.)  Tammy accidently spills a jar of sugar, so she vacuums it up.  But the vacuum cleaner has no bag in it, and sugar gets sprayed all over the customers in the caf.  This theme is developed later on, in the cafe, when Tammy throws salt at a Ghota in the cafe, enabling her to escape. And later, when the Ghotas enter a movie theater and attack the patrons.  Tammy dumps salt into a vacuum cleaner, and sprays salt at the Ghotas.  This would have made an excellent turning point in the movie.

Unfortunately, however, the impact of the ""salt theme"" is ruined because, in the theater scene, the salt does not do anything.  In other words, from the very start of the movie, the movie had dropped repeated hints about spilled salt, or spilled sugar, or sugar or salt being sprayed in a vacuum cleaner.  But, for reasons unknown, the salt had no effect in the theater scene.  This is my only complaint about ALIEN TRESPASS.

(Please note that in THE BLOB, the theme of coldness as a means to immobilize the blob monster develops early.  We first learn that the blob does not like the cold in the scene in the meat storage room.  Then at the very end of THE BLOB, the townspeople immobilize the blob by shooting carbon dioxide from fire extinguishers at the blob.  Thus, in THE BLOB we find a coherent development of this theme.}

CONCLUSION.  This is an excellent little movie.  Every minute of ALIEN TRESPASS sparkles with cleverness and suspense.  ALIEN TRESPASS is fine for children aged nine and up.  The squid monsters (Ghotas) will likely be scary to younger children.  There is not one single bad word in the movie.  There are no overt sexual images, language, or themes.  The goal of the movie was to replicate the look and feel of a late 1950s science fiction movie.  Hence, the film subjects the viewer to a certain amount of ""retro trivia,"" namely, references to Edsels, to the newly invented Polaroid, to the tired blood advertisement, and to the movie THE BLOB.

Fortunately, ALIEN TRESPASS refrains from beating this theme to death, and it refrains from subjecting the viewers to well-known pop songs or celebrities from the era.  It is interesting to point out, that the cafe scenes and the scenes with the teenagers in their automobile all have some sort of doo-wop music in the background, but none of this music is from a recognizable pop song.  Louis Febre composed the excellent music for the film.  The lighting is excellent, for example, we often see shadows cast by the sun filtering through venetian blinds.

To understand the very last minute of this movie, it might be good to watch the movie two or three times.  In other words, you might need to watch the movie three times to understand why Tammy is driving off with her pickup truck filled with furniture.",1258156800,7,9036,4.604519774011299

Meanwhile back at the ranch Ted Lewis (Eric McCormack) astronomer and his voluptuous wife Lana (Jody Thompson) are firering up a few steaks and maybe something else. From there the movie only heats up.

New movie built as a sort of montage of our favorite 50's sci-fi movies.  This is much better blended than most attempted spoofs that are usually a collection of clich&eacute;s or cheap shots. While I was cheering for the good people, I am sure some will cheer the monster on as some of the characters deserved to be consumed.  The only gory part is that the monster leaves ugly stain causing puddles.

I only say the Blu-ray version so I cannot compare. However, the females looked a little too fresh for a 50's sci-fi; Lana looks like she would taste good with a little salt.

3881474,3,B0029W2V9U,"Though mildly diverting, this homage to 50s sci-fi films misses the mark by quite a bit. The premise is straight forward enough. A flying sauces crash lands in the American southwest and the pilot needs to inhabit a human form so he can hunt down his escaped prisoner who, if left unchecked, will multiply and devour our precious earth.

Being set in a small desert community, the movie focuses on a small group of people who are just a bit too cliche' to raise the movie above being...well.....cliche. You have the teens who no one believes when they try to tell them about the crashed saucer. You have a ""Mutt and Jeff"" duo who fulfill the comic relief quotient for the script. A womanizing sheriff's deputy, a scientist who smokes a pipe and a few others.

The plot develops into scenes where the characters get gobbled up and liquifyed by the monsters as the focus characters slowly come to realize the local teens weren't lying. None of these scenes were really very clever and the monsters looked a bit too goofy. Yes, 50s sci-fi monsters weren't known for their high quality but these were just too............too. Other than half the cast being wiped out, all is well in the end.

Some odd notes are: Being shot in a desert which had to provide a desirable lid to the budget, it appears some scenes were shot against a screen. Why? Also, if it is shot in the American southwest why was there both an American and Canadian casting director? Do Canadian's work cheaper? Go figure.

It would probably be a good idea to watch a lot of the movies too.  The writers and the director for this movie didn't do any of that stuff.  Love wasn't their motive; money was the motive.

Alien Trespass is so superficial and so tongue-in-cheek, it's like Saturday Night Live for the past 20 years - smugly disrespectful to the audience and to the subject matter. Just like SNL, the actors don't appear to even be in character.  Barely professional.  If you can forget about it being a homage and watch it just as a movie, it's just a bad movie.

If you want to see a good homage to a film genre, buy Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid, Death Proof or Planet Terror.  Too bad about this one.  I'm sure it sounded good on paper to a movie exec who is a sci-fi buff.  Realized on film, it's awful  unless it got real good after the 30 minutes of it that I could stomach.

Stiff Acting ... Check
Cheesy Special Effects ... Check
Hip Kids in Cool Cars ... Check
Square Cops ... Check
Rubber Suite Monsters ... Check
Weird SciFi'ish Music ... Check

Well, I guess that's all that's needed, we have a 1950's monster movie.

No plot spoilers from me, and none are needed if you ever saw even one of those old movies, the movie is ""actually"" a 1957 Hollywood movie that never got released, as explained in a newsreel style format at the beginning. The main plot follows Ted Lewis (Eric McCormack), a mild mannered astronomer, as the small town experiences a wave of strange events and disappearances that seem to be related to a meteor crash in the desert. Character actors Robert Patrick and Dan Lauria are the local police, and Jody Thompson as Lana, Ted's wife. R.W. Goodwin (The X-Files) produced and directed the movie.

The cinematography was fairly good and I liked the use of oversaturated colors to give that 1950 feel. The music score was exactly what you would expect from this type of movie and really set the right tone. There was very little to take offence to in the movie besides some very vague suggestive remarks and one biological reference.

Overall, this was a fun movie that might be lost on younger viewers but was very enjoyable to me. Recommended!",1251417600,31,1542,4.7388059701492535
3881483,4,B0029W2V9U,"The BEM (Bug Eyed Monster) is on the loose!

[The Alien Trespass website is constructed like a news broadcast, lots of fun and trivia.]

This film is a direct to DVD special made by X-Files director R. W. Goodwin&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-X-Files-The-Complete-First-Season-Slim-Set/dp/B000BOH986/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The X-Files - The Complete First Season (Slim Set)</a>&nbsp;.  The DVD is great because it has mockumentary interviews with the ""stars"" of the ""long lost"" archived film from 1957, with your host, Edwin R. Burroughs (five points for a correct guess as to whom they're mocking).

Several points are made that do not make this a parody, but more a laugh out loud commentary on the period of the 1950s (if you ignore the Korean War, nuclear threat or teenage rebellion) as an optimistic time.

The movie is a homage of sorts, written to emulate such classics as It Came from Outer Space, The Day The Earth Stood Still and War of the Worlds.

The professor/astronomer (played by Eric McCormack&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Will-Grace-The-Complete-Series/dp/B001BNFR6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Will & Grace: The Complete Series</a>) and his buxom wife are about to celebrate their wedding anniversary.  Suddenly, A spaceship comes sailing out of the sky, all sparks flying wrong-way to.  What the heck was that?

""Well darling, you have to get your anniversary present first,"" she coos, and leads him to the bedroom.  The next scene, they're fully clothed in their pajamas when the prof sneaks out and meets the spacecraft.

His body is taken over by Urp, a sort of Federal ranger of space (he claims), where the rest of the movie involves capturing the BEM before it divides and turns mankind into so much goo.

As the puddles of goo multiply and the town becomes panicky, only a plucky, blonde waitress stands in the way of preventing the bumbling small town police from screwing up the rescue attempt.

The features reveal a story within a story, where the directors in 1957 are in a contract dispute and destroy all the prints.  One is found though, as we see in a recent ""news broadcast.""

The attention to detail right down to the '57 Chevy's and the teenage kids is funny and downright laughable, in a fun way.

There is the theater scene, right out of The Blob, where The Blob is actually being played in the theater.  The BEM reaches his tentacle on a girl's shoulder.  She thinks that's her date's arm and bats the tentacle away.  [Except The Blob was released in 1958 and this film ""release"" is 1957, but don't worry about that.]

The alien is trying to explain his mission to the waitress, and she says his name is ""Urp.""  She says, Oh, I got a Rolaids for you!""

The whole package is cute and is appreciative of the wacky 50s sci-fi of the time.

Must-watch.

Well, the bright color and limited use of computer effects blow that out of the water.  Not to mention a character saying, ""I gotta take a whiz"".  But this movie isn't trying to replicate a 50s film to the letter, instead it's done in the same style as far as the storyline goes, as well as the acting style.
The plot takes elements from classic 50s sci-fi films and puts them in a blender for an entertaining story.  In the film, an intergalactic ""federal marshal"" named Urp lands on Earth to apprehend a Ghota, which looks like a large pickle with tentacles and one eye.  Temporarily using the body of a pipe smoking astronomer, Ted Lewis, the spacecop clumsily makes his way through town, knowing practically nothing about how to interact with human beings.  Meanwhile, the dreaded Ghota is going on a killing spree, eating everyone in it's path and leaving only slimy puddles behind.  The disappearances get the police thinking the culprit may be Lewis, as his new and bizarre behavior is suspicious.  Plus, there are various people including two teenage lovers, who have seen the Ghota and are trying to convince people.  The only one who seems to believe the incredible story is a waitress at the local diner who teams up with Urp for the big showdown with the Ghota.
This film is a tribute and an homage, but it is not a parody or spoof exactly.  I've never been all that fond of spoofs of this kind of material as they seem unnecessary.  After all, you're trying to spoof something that was already funny to begin with.  Since the acting and writing style here are in the vein of the 50s, the laughs don't come from wink-winks and nudge-nudges to the audience, but instead come from the same things that made you laugh at those old movies.  The acting is impressive(especially from lead Eric McCormack) considering that trying to learn the acting style of this time period and genre can't be as easy as it looks.
It's not perfect by any means.  I feel it should have been done in Black & White and eliminated the scarce computer graphics altogether, as it tends to go against the overall cheapness the movie is going for.  Oh, well.
The disc has some nice extras with ""vintage"" interviews with the cast as well as legitimate interviews with director Goodwin and Eric McCormack.
