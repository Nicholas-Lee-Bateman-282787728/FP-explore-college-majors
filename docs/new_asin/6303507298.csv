Ozma's magickal powers were so much fun to enjoy and the characters were just as fun as they have always been. It was great to see the good witch of the south make a brief appearence again. Glinda's so cool, good and powerful. I wish Cinar could of made more movies of Oz! They were all great and FANTASTIC!",1048636800,2,375,4.013333333333334
