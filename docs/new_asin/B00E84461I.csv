5893753,4,B00E84461I,"I am a big fan of Bob Harper and his workout DVDs.  This DVD has three short ab workouts which I have used as add-ons to other workouts.  All three workouts are effective and certainly not easy, but I would say WOD #2 was the toughest and the one I enjoyed the most.  I suppose if you were working just abs for the day, you could do all three workouts at once.",1377734400,2,360,3.9722222222222223

8602317,5,B00E84461I,"I am a huge fan of Bob Harper. I did Bob's workout for 2 months in row and lost 20 lbs! What I love from Bob is we have to do hard work, push yourselves out of the box, consistence, and discipline. I did not find those in another personal trainers. Not enough thank you for Bob Harper! If I could give 6 stars, I would!",1431561600,,319,3.8484848484848486

8602319,2,B00E84461I,"I really wanted to like this because I love Bob Harper on Biggest Loser,but this DVD along with his other Skinny Rules dvd's just had serious dread factor for me. The moves,while they did make me sweat,were so repetitous that I found myself getting agitated. I actually sold the whole Skinny Rules set on EBay because I could not force myself to do them more then once. I haven't really enjoyed his workout dvd's-while they did challenge me,they all had serious dread factor for me.i do love the 2 latest Biggest Loser dvd's-Cardio Crush and 8 minute Body Blasters-the workouts that Bob lead on those are amazing-these,not so much",1428710400,,630,4.7889908256880735

8602322,5,B00E84461I,"Ok, I've never been a Bob fan... he's never been a favorite of mine- until now.  A friend suggested this DVD because I'm an AB workout junkie.  I was very resistant at first, but figured I had nothing to lose.  I really, really like this DVD because it includes A LOT of planks, stabilization, and very little traditional sit ups and leg work.  After an achilles injury, I find myself being concerned about workouts that include a lot of leg action.  I just don't feel comfortable, and with all of the modern AB exercises, I don't feel that incorporating legs in an AB workout is productive- just my opinion.  Anyway, the DVD is outstanding- perfect pace, excellent exercise choices.  In the past, I felt disconnected to Bob's workouts, but not now.  If you want an AB workout that's modern, efficient, and really makes you feel like you've done something, give this a try.",1388620800,4,873,4.660130718954249
8602323,5,B00E84461I,"This is another one of Bob Harper's CrossFit style DVD. It's superb. The focus is on abs and core, but it's an overall terrific workout. The WODs move along pretty quickly and the workout made me sweat. I am a huge fan of his workouts and this one is a keeper.",1381708800,,260,4.117647058823529
8602324,5,B00E84461I,"I had already purchased the 3 DVD set of Bob Harper's The Skinny Rules  when I sought out this one.  I am so impressed with the results of the first three.. and this one does NOT disappoint.  After having two kids, my abs just didn't quite ""go back"" to what I expected.. not that they ever were a six pack or anything.  This DVD has me working hard and I FEEL the ab workout.. I FEEL my core getting stronger and I have found that first indication of an ""AB line"" right under my rib cage.  These workouts are ideal because they are short but meaningful.  I take them with me when I travel and play them on my laptop and it's only 12 - 18 min of me jumping on the head of the person under me in the hotel :)",1381449600,2,706,3.936619718309859
8602325,5,B00E84461I,"I LOVE Bob Harper. That being said, I saw that he came out with The Skinny Rules workouts and had to try the abs one immediately! It is 20 minutes long, and is a great workout for not a lot of time! My abs are feeling it today!!! One reason why I especially love Bob is that he has different skill levels, and it is NOT so hard that a beginner can't do it. I can't wait to try the rest of his Skinny Rules Workouts!",1381104000,,415,3.8372093023255816
