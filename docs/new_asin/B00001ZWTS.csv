1247604,2,B00001ZWTS,"When you go to see a Will Smith movie, you expect it to be entertaining and fast-paced. A movie with Kevin Kline might have your expectations leaning more in the direction of cerebral, tight-knit & solid entertainment. If Salma Hayek is in it, well ....at least you expect a  flick with visual appeal ...1, 2, 3 STRIKES...Wild Wild West STRIKES OUT!  TALK ABOUT DROPPING THE BALL ! Will Smith, whose laid-back,  street-wise-cracking veneer,usually hides a well-focused on screen in-  tensity that is both impossible to miss ordislike ...seemed to be  sauntering through the film, feel- ing embarrassedly like a walking  anachronism, con- sidering the ""Old West"" backdrop! Kevin Kline,  on the other hand, who usually brings a certain air of bravura to his  oft-times eccen- tric characterizations, seemed to display a marked  inability to take himself seriously when in drag, (Which, unfortunately, is  during a good chunk of  the film)lapsing into a pathetic sort self-parody,  which, considering the script, may have been the only way he could stomach  the role !  Salma Hayek, for whom no one is exactly holding their breath  for her to win an Oscar as Best Actress, seemed OBSESSED with getting her  lines out with as little accent as possible...Despite the fact that she was  clearly cast as Mexican in this film...(As opposed to her bit part in The  FACULTY!) You could almost imagine ""La Mejicanita"" standing  there, during shooting, with her Accent/ Dialogue Coach, just out of camera  range! Salma... concentrate MORE on your ACTING, next time, O.K.?
As far  as Barry Sonnenfled's Directing is concern- ed...well, here we could  imagine him running around frantically, till the last minute, editing &  re-editing, trying to decide exactly what it is he was trying to do with  ""WILD""....and of course, not even coming CLOSE to getting it  right!
The ONLY reason I rated the movie 2 Stars (as op- posed to 0  Stars!) is because of the scope & the
novelty of the Special Effects.  The idea of seeing all those well orquestrated, and at times visually  stunning effects against an Old West backdrop was the only refreshing &  original element in the film ...If you are not a diehard Special Effects  buff, I can think of absolutely no reason on earth why you would find  anything at all worth seeing in  this pathetic excuse for a Blockbuster  film !",942537600,21,2355,4.910941475826972
1247605,4,B00001ZWTS,If you like gadgets and  gizmos then you'll like this movie alot. The creative use for the whole movie was greatly developed. I Like WWW because of the Creativity and imagination involved. Yes I was slightly disapointed  but not like I was when I saw Starship Troopers. This movie doesn't deserve  to be called worst movie of the summer.,939254400,3,337,4.677966101694915
1247606,5,B00001ZWTS,"It was a great movie.  The only problem is that it was nothing like the show.  I have this major crush on Kevin Kline so, of corse I wanted to see it.  Dr. Lovless had been cut in half instead of being a midget. James West  is between James Bond and John Wayne.  Artimis Gorden is like, just cool.  He hs all these little gizmos and gadgets that do, just about evrything.  Everybody I know says it was a good movie and I agree full hartedly.",938736000,3,441,4.058139534883721
1247607,4,B00001ZWTS,"I enjoyed this movie despite all of the negetivity that it got from the press.  While I'm far too young to remember the original T.V. show I still think this movie did a great job.  It did however seem a little too  far-fetched at times.  The whole deal with the mechanical spider was too  much.  But  The whole idea of having the bad guys being a bunch of mad  ex-confederates was great.  They also made the film historically acurate,  Grant was president in 1869 and that was the year the transcontinential  railroads were finally joined in Utah.  This is a movie anyone can watch.  It is not overly or graphically violent, very little swearing, and its just  plain fun to watch.  I recommend it to anyone who likes to watch movies to  be entertained by them.  Which in my opinion is their number one  responsibility.",937872000,,819,4.531034482758621
1247608,1,B00001ZWTS,"After seeing all the hype over this movie, and seeing the awsome Music video for this movie. I was extremely excited to go and plop down my $ this summer to see this movie. Unfortunately I was in for a big suprise!  The movie started out pretty slow. After about 15 mins i was left wondering  if it was ever going to pick up. But to no avail, nothing. I was left  hanging and eventually went to sleep in the movie. After about 10 mins of  napping in the theater my eyes opened to even more bordom!!! What happened  to this movie? Did they just loose all creativity and slap something  together and hope that Will Smith's name would save it? I have not seen  such an awfuly boring movie of this calubur is years. I would not recommend  it to anyone. Let alone tell anyone to waste there hard earned money to  have such a terible movie added to their collection of DVD's at home. Even  if you are a huge Will Smith fan, you will be extremely dissapointed. Don't  waste your time and money on this one.",937872000,9,999,4.232804232804233

1247610,5,B00001ZWTS,"this movie was set back in 1869 in the old west, kevin cline,will smith and salma hayek, al 3 end up working together to
take care of president grant and there is a  guy thats only half of himself and in a self made mechanical wheel chair
thats trying to  get to the president and take  and divide the united states with his giant mechanical motorized spider
Jim west and arte have a hard time with this guy and selma hayek, will she is basically a distraction as  Jim west puts it
its hard fought  battle and you will see some made up creations by arte( kevin Kline) they are well thought out
but not always the best of ideas, this movie is funny  and you will get lots of laughs out of it!
so sit back and enjoy THE WILD,WILD WEST!!!",1509235200,,735,4.140845070422535

1247613,5,B00001ZWTS,"Wild wild west dispite Wil Smiths embarrassment, is a good movie. At times low brow humor but then 1869 was low brow and racist. The tv series that its based on was extremly silly even for 60's television.  The movie is fun fast paced full of action and has a giant sider the series couldn't afford.
Watch it you'll enjoy it.",1505606400,,325,4.327868852459017

1247615,1,B00001ZWTS,"What a terrible film. How actors of such a high caliber (Kline, Branagh) ended up in this piece of drivel is beyond me. The editing is a mess, the special effects are horrible, the plot is non-existent and what the heck is up with Salma Hayek? It seemed like her role was supposed to be bigger but ended up on the cutting room floor. Either that or she was hurting for rent money and took the first crap role she was offered.

Awful! And a rip off even for $4 rental. If you haven't seen this one yet but are still curious, wait for a copy to show up for .25 cents at a local Goodwill.",1504483200,,585,4.043103448275862

1247618,3,B00001ZWTS,"In an age of retreads and sequels, when new means no production funds and very jaded low brow test audiences rule, it is still fun to see an adaptation of an old favorite done with zest and flair.  The casting, script and direction are all first rate (given the limitations of the project), and the steampunk special effects are actually rather charming.  Kevin Kline and Will Smith share some good on-screen chemistry, and Kenneth Branagh nearly steals the movie in the only truly new incarnation of Dr. Arless Loveless.  His madly overdone South Carolina drawl is a delight.  Recommend for an evening when the brain is not required.  Why only three stars?  The original extremely campy series on which this is based is truly underappreciated, with writing sometimes just as good and characters among the best ever seen on network television.  The ghosts of Ross Martin and Michael Dunn were hard to dismiss as the de rigueur plot twists, chases and fight scenes played through.  Somehow, I felt a bit of desecration of my favorite kitsch.  The movie is most spot on when it is least believable.  The twinged racial joking between West and Loveless is actually almost charming here: you won't feel cheated even while you are being cheated.  And with a henchwoman named Munitia, how can you cavil?",1501459200,,1297,4.85
1247619,5,B00001ZWTS,It still hols up after all of these years!,1501372800,,42,3.7777777777777777
1247620,1,B00001ZWTS,Probably the worst feature film ever made. It is disgustingly bad on so many levels that it boggles the mind. Any reviewer giving this monstrosity more than one star has just provided public proof of having an IQ in the single digits. Every person who had any part in the production of this film should be deeply and profoundly ashamed of themselves. All monies paid by anyone to see this odious garbage in a theater or to rent it should have their money returned with interest and written apologies.,1501286400,,500,4.629213483146067
1247621,4,B00001ZWTS,"I loved the TV series as a kid and couldn't wait to see this version in the movie theaters. While it was a fairly far deviation from the TV series,  i enjoyed it.  I guess I can understand why it was critically panned but maybe the expectation just needed to be adjusted. I mean,  movies like this are supposed to be an escape from reality and i remember thinking the TV show always seemed a little far -fetched given its supposed time frame (e.g. Arty's inventions) so I was ok with this movie taking on the same tone with the ridiculousness of the ""mechanical"" creations.
Another place I think the movie was criticized for was the confusion as to whether it was supposed to be a comedy or not. I did just re -watch it and I think some of the humor, especially the racist/ sexist references,  is similar to stuff you would see in spoofs today like Key&Peele or even SNL sketches - irreverent and ironic, but maybe want as acceptable as in the 90's. I found myself LOL at the leggless jokes and the scene where Will Smith is trying to talk his way out of being lynched.  Watching the movie today(2017), I thought i could see this becoming a ""cult classic"" because of that type of irreverant humor,  the use of 007-like gadgetry(anachronistic as they were), and the over the top acting. Overall, it's worth watching to escape reality for a while.",1501286400,,1345,4.469387755102041

1247623,1,B00001ZWTS,"This is pretty horrible. I watched about 5 minutes. I then switched to a movie that was only rated about 6 and it was so much better.

I used to watch the Wild, Wild West (television series) in my youth. From my very limited viewing, this does not even come close. For a television show to be better than a movie should be hard to accomplish. One of the ""hooks"" in the television show was to give a situation that made you want to watch the rest of the show. This, unfortunately, does not have that.",1501200000,,499,4.197916666666667
1247624,1,B00001ZWTS,"Tokens, we must have our tokens in every movie now.  We even had a Black Annie on Broadway, without the red hair of course, just to be politically correct!",1501113600,,155,4.344827586206897
1247625,2,B00001ZWTS,This so-so movie made me long for the old Robert Conrad series.  The over-acting Will Smith just doesn't cut it as the low-key but violent James West.,1500854400,,150,4.555555555555555
1247626,3,B00001ZWTS,It was ok.  Not at all realistic to the time period though (unlike the original movies and series).  Was rather disappointed.  I don't think I'd recommend it unless you're just looking for something to kill time with that has some laughs and some action.,1500768000,,254,4.7272727272727275

1247633,1,B00001ZWTS,"Silly idea. In 1869 America, that they would have a black secret service agent, even if it existed back then is preposterous.

1247634,1,B00001ZWTS,"What could have been a cool pairing of Will Smith and Kevin Kline gets bogged down with literally oversized cgi  effects. Even Salma Hayak half falling out of her costumes can't helps this disaster.  The tv series, and I gave up Friday night high school football to watch it, had by it's first mid-season developed the bad guy with the weird way of taking over the world.  This weird bad guy is Kenneth Branaugh who puts in his worst performance ever.  Worse than his performance is his character: Arliss Loveless, a genius who lost his legs and gets  around in an enlarged spider that looks like a cast off from the Star Wars toy set.  Demeaning the character of Miguelito Loveless, the small person who was in several of the tv episodes.  Not once was there a joke in the series about Dr. Loveless's height, as opposed to all of the slights that Will Smith delivers.  Will Smith seems to have played this as if it was a practice for MIB.  Terrible script, terrible cgi effects, demeaning to the series all around, with the exception of Emmet Walsh as the train conductor.",1500076800,2,1073,4.546875

Ridiculous story, acting that was dialed in by some of the main actors (especially Klein and Hayek), the bizarre cross-dressing gimmick (done twice, in case the first one left you wanting for more), awful sex-themed jokes, all special effects not involving explosions look terrible, a kiddy-sounding score devoid of any testosterone, and the incomplete effort these filmmakers dared to call action scenes.

1247727,5,B00001ZWTS,"I've never heard this movie back in 2008 until I came across Kevin (Kline) for the 4th time. I saw photos and did a little research on it. I wanted to see this badly and I used to have a 2 movie pack that has this and Maverick. I sold it to only get this movie. Each time I see this, I kept thinking of 2 things. 1 is the time I was in a western department of a museum in Denver. A book asked ""What does the west mean to you?"" and I looked through to find a blank page. As I kept looking, I saw 2 stick figures saying that this was what the west means to somebody else. On one side it wrote Will Smith. And on the other side it wrote other guy. And I knew who the other guy is so I wrote Kevin Kline next to it. Then I wrote that Silverado and this movie are what the west mean to me. 2 is when I told my mom that she can go straight to hell behind her back. And because of that, she asked me to get rid of it and I refused to because I love the movie so much that I didn't want to remove the movie for good. People have been saying this was an awful film. Everyone in my family liked it because of Will Smith and we admire him. I admired Will since Shark Tale. I now have it in French & Italian and they're both fun to watch. I can't wait to see Kevin in Ricki and the Flash and Beauty and the Beast (2017). At the time it was released on the big screen, I was a non-verbal 4-year-old toddler.",1435363200,3,1394,3.7448979591836733

1247794,5,B00001ZWTS,"I thought the movie worked as a decent piece of action packed escapism, but not as a serious western like DJANGO UNCHAINED or TRUE GRIT. Will Smith was pretty funny as agent James West. Some of his one-liners were pretty great. Others were pretty uncalled for. Kevin Kline did a pretty good Artemis Gordon, Wests' inventer partner. The two men are forced to put aside their differences and work together to stop Dr. Arliss Loveless, a former soldier in the Confederate army who has turned into a scientist determined to get revenge on the Union. Kenneth Branagh did an OK job as Loveless, but I think Alan Rickman, Michael Wincott or Jeremy Irons would have been better choices. The CGI quality alone is worth a viewing and the action is undeniably awesome on its' own.",1421798400,,769,4.703703703703703

The Special effects worked for me and some of them I'd even like to own. The pool table for instance looked cool as will as the picture folks. I thought that was neat. I didn't like the jokes but my since of humor is caustic or physical comedy and I don't care for put downs.

1247812,5,B00001ZWTS,"Will Smith is at his best. Excellent acting as he plays a federal agent after the one who has been kidnapping selected scientists. He plays Jim West and is joined by another agent (unknown to him) Artemis Gorden (Kevin Kline) and the beautiful Lady (Salma Hayek) whom they are both trying to impress. They eventually find they are up against the supposedly dead Dr. Arliss Loveless played excellently by Kenneth Branagh. It is wild as Gorden keeps coming up with clever little gadgets that West thinks are completely useless. West believes in the shoot first ask questions of anyone still alive. Their combination of techniques are bound to get the job done eventually. This movie is a joy to watch but has a PG13 rating for a reason! It has great acting, comedy, and storyline.

1247822,4,B00001ZWTS,"""Wild Wild West"" has to be one of the most notorious films ever made. Released in 1999, it's a blockbuster parody of the late-60's TV series with Will Smith in the starring role, which should tip everyone off that the film's not meant to be taken seriously (not that the TV series could be taken all that seriously either, just more serious than this movie).

Kevin Kline plays James West's reluctant partner and he's a wiz with gizmos. Many complain about the ""lack of chemistry"" of the two stars, but I think it's a bunch of Barbra Streisand (BS). What these people don't get is that these characters are NOT SUPPOSED to like each other. As far as I'm concerned, Smith & Kline make an entertaining team and are perfectly suitable for this movie.

Kenneth Branagh and Ted Levine are also on hand as villains, but it's sassy, petite Salma Hayek who wins the prize for best supporting actor. This is only the second film I've seen her in and she just shines. Salma appears in some attractive outfits, including one with white fishnet stockings, and she's just a beauty to behold.

BOTTOM LINE: I don't get what the whiners are complaining about with this movie, unless they were uber-fans of the TV series and were expecting a serious film adaption. ""Wild Wild West"" is an energetic goofy blockbuster spoof with all the requisite trappings, like 1999's ""The Mummy"" and 2004's ""Van Helsing."" I call these types of films ""big dumb fun"" movies because they're not meant to be taken too seriously; they're ""Summer blockbusters"" and solely exist to entertain & amuse the viewer. Knowing this will help you appreciate ""Wild Wild West."" So turn off your brain and enjoy the ride.

The film runs 106 minutes and was shot in California, New Mexico, Utah, Arizona and Idaho.

1247823,5,B00001ZWTS,Great movie. The scene where Will Smith AKA Jim West walks into the Oval Office and is stopped by the Pinkerton idiots make buying the movie worth every dime,1401926400,2,157,4.448275862068965
1247824,5,B00001ZWTS,If you like Steampunk you MUST watch this movie. This movie portrays post Civil war Anerican Steampunk.  I admit that the 1st time I watched this shortly after it came 2 DVD I got bored with it and fell asleep.about 2 years ago I got into steampunk. Have The Steampunk tarot have been 2 steampunk unlimited and attended a steampunk version of The Fantasticks to name a few.  I caught the last part of this on cable after her my steampunk interest started. That's when I ordered the DVD & it is one of my favorite movies now. I just didn't get it before I got into Steampunk. This year for Steampunk Unlimited I am dressing my husband and I as characters from the movie. of course he'll be dressed like James West. I will not dress as Rita.  I happen to have most of what I need for costuming for one of the other female characters.  It will be a big change in how I usually dress for these events.  I just watched it again today & took costuming notes.,1401494400,,952,4.237569060773481

1247827,3,B00001ZWTS,"Always fun to watch Will Smith in movies like this, but the movie as a whole goes too far.  The premise and many of the characters are just ridiculous.  Some good laughs, but not a movie I would watch over and over again.",1400112000,,221,4.116279069767442

1247829,1,B00001ZWTS,"Who were they kidding. Will Smith was hopelessly miscast.,Smith does not have the physical presence to be James West.
The movie is based on a wonderful 1960s tv series - which Director Sonnenfeld has apparently never seen.  Fans of the classic series were bitterly disappointed by this muddled mess.

Much of the problems with this production are directly related to Will Smith.  He obviously does not have even a basic clue how to play an historic character.  He comes across, incredibly lamely, as ""Fresh Prince Plays Cowboy""... It just does not succeed on any level.

The one good thing about this product is Kevin Klein. He understands what his character is supposed to be. Klein's quality as an actor shines in every scene.

I cannot recommend this movie. buy the original series and watch those - you will be glad you did.",1399507200,2,828,4.795774647887324
1247830,4,B00001ZWTS,Cheesy in the best way possible. I love Will Smith and Kevin Kline together and Kenneth Branaugh was super fun.,1399248000,2,111,4.6

1247836,5,B00001ZWTS,"I don't know how anyone could hate this movie, it's so much fun! Will Smith and Kevin Kline are awesome, but I think that Kenneth Branagh steals the show. The man is fantastically cheesy and so dedicated as Loveless. It's one of my favorite roles he's ever done hah.  I think that if you don't go into the movie taking it seriously, you'll have a good time watching it.",1393891200,,369,4.3478260869565215

1247854,1,B00001ZWTS,"The great Ross Martin is flipping in his tomb, he's flipping off the producers of this monstrosity. The only way a film can be this bad is to do it on purpose-with millions of dollars to flush down the toilet and somehow be able to write it all off on taxes. The man with his hand on the flusher was none other than Will Smith, who when he was cast, racism had to be wrote into the script. Mel Gibson was considered, but Patrick Swayze would have been perfect. Swayze was near Conrad's size, was good at martial arts, and a very good actor. Will Smith fans don't care if his movies are any good, they just show up to see him-because he is so ""likeable"" and for some reason they like to chew bubblegum and text message all the way through each and every one of his blockbusters. Why has this not showed up on mystery science theater 3000? It is because more people have seen the Gamera flying turtle movies than have seen this (no disrespect intended for floppy rubber turtles swinging from piano wire).",1385942400,3,1002,4.363636363636363

Will Smith and Kevin Klein are the good guys who use a lot of gadgets to foil the bad guys, who have a lot of gadgets themselves.

1247860,2,B00001ZWTS,"I held off on seeing this movie for the first time since I have never been much into remakes of old TV shows, and I am a big fan of the original. However, I also recently became a big devotee of Steampunk, and after I heard that it was one of the quintessential Steampunk movies, along with ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" and ""Van Helsing,"" I decided to try it out and rent it for a day.

What a disappointment! I got through about the first half hour or so before I fell asleep, woke up just as it was ending, and while I still had about a half a day left to watch it over again and catch the parts I missed, I decided--Nah! I have better things to do. Like take a nap.

It is awful! I've read a few other reviews of it, and most of them said that Will Smith and Kevin Kline have no chemistry, and that was spot on. I've always loved pretty much anything that Will Smith does, but it's kind of hit and miss with Kevin Kline, and this one was definitely a miss. The dialogue between the two was forced and unrealistic, the stunts and special effects were contrived, and the whole thing pretty much--well, face it, it sucked, and please excuse my French.

The only bright spot in the movie was Salma Hayek, although it wasn't enough to compensate. While looking as fetching as ever and while she tried to make a mousse out of a cowpie, she just couldn't pull it off with the lines she was given. Another one of my favorite actors trapped in a miserable mess of a film. I like Kevin Kline too, most of the time, but he does seem to gravitate toward these bottom-feeding snooze fests. Far cry from ""Sophie's Choice,"" my friend.

I gave it two stars only because it did a somewhat worthwhile attempt at Steampunk. Otherwise, save your money.",1380240000,2,1742,4.301829268292683
1247861,4,B00001ZWTS,This movie is awesome. Also everyone must watch it because it is stereotypical way to explain Steampunk to stupid people. So... watch this movie!!!!!!,1380153600,,150,5.291666666666667
1247862,5,B00001ZWTS,"I bought this movie for my daughter, who hadn't seen it yet, but who is a big fan of Doctor Who and other such shows.  I knew she'd like the steampunk aspect of this movie.  She absolutely LOVES this movie.  It helps that she's a Will Smith fan, but really, this movie is funny and the awesome steam-driven robotics make it even more fun.

Totally worth whatever I paid for it.  We've watched it several times and my daughter now uses it during slumber parties (because none of those kids have seen the movie either, although they all seem to know the ""Wild Wild West"" song from the Just Dance 4 video game).  :)",1379721600,,612,4.324561403508772

I was only able to sit thru 1/3 of the movie (if that) and then I walked out.  Whomever was the casting director should be forced to watch the entire movie.  Come to think of it, the director, writers, etc., should all be made to watch the movie as a lesson on what not to release in movie form.  This was/is a straight to DVD product.

Its too bad they couldn't get Robert Conrad for at least a cameo, however we still have the old TV series, as well as the made-for-TV specials they have, to see him as James West.

1247892,3,B00001ZWTS,"Wild Wild West i think was well before its time. Today a movie like this would be a flop with the critics and a score with younger generations who want to laugh at odd humor. The movie isn't bad depending on how you look at it. The story clearly wasn't supposed to be serious due to the equipment and obvious lack of seriousness in the movie. The problem lies in many viewers who watch it do so and compare it to other movies. With Wild WIld West you can't compare it because it stands alone in its own group.

The movie is funny, there are parts where you'll bust up laughing. But be warned that if you buy the movie you must remember not to take the plot seriously and to take it the way it was intended as a comedy. If they wanted to make a serious film many things wouldn't have been in the movie such as: Loveless and his chair. The vast array of go go gadget type machines Loveless had. Plus back in the early years after the civil war women wouldn't be running around half nude in lingerie (im not sure lingerie was around back then anyway). This film sort of reminds me of a early hangover. Its plot is silly and stupid yet for some reason the movie is still funny.

To watch this movie you have to keep in mind that its intent was to be a silly comedy. if you can remember that then you'll probably enjoy the laughs. Im not sure there is much replay value to this movie maybe once a year.

Overall this film did make me laugh with its comedy and obvious bad acting (minus Smith's acting). However the same acting that made me laugh is also a reason i took a star away from the film. The plot is ridiculous and overall a B-list film from A list actors. Its not bad and for the current amazon price of $0.01 I'd say you don't have much to lose in checking it out and getting some laughs and giggles.

""comedies or fantasy adventures, technically known as ""fun"" or ""necessary"" movies, are utterly beneath contempt. every blue moon or so, one such title will be drawn from a hat, and that one you may recommend if so moved. all others, even if you enjoy them, are to be regarded and treated as deliberately malicious assaults against you personally.
""conversely, dramas about day-to-day life in The Real World, technically known as ""boring"" or ""pointless"" movies, are the very sacredest of sacred cows. if you don't feel moved to recommend one such film, it is to receive only the most businesslike slap on the wrist, as if it had simply forgotten to deliver an important memo or something.""
this irrational and illogical prejudice against the very concept of escapism has frustrated me many a time, but never quite so profoundly as in this case. of all the films i've loved only to see slandered by the critics - Ghostbusters II, The Shadow, The Adventures Of Rocky & Bullwinkle - this is easily the one that got the rawest deal. let me put it this way: Wild Wild West is hands-down the greatest film ever to ""win"" a Razzie.
of course it was always destined to be the sort of film said snobs would sneer at, but how did the ill-will get so far? how did it reach the point where Will Smith was actually browbeaten into apologizing to original star Robert Conrad for ""desecrating"" his signature character? and don't even get me started on those killjoys who to this day refuse to let Smith (or anyone else, for that matter) ever forget that he turned down The Matrix to make this film. apparently it's a moot point that The Matrix is a wad of convoluted metaphysical gibberish, whereas whatever else you wanna say about WWW, at least it makes sense.
what it reflects is one of the sadder realities of movies, indeed of life itself: once a juggernaut builds up momentum, about all you can do is get the hell out of the way.
this was Will Smith's, as well as director Barry Sonnenfeld's, immediate follow-up to their triumphant collaboration Men In Black, and contrary to gossip, lightning DID strike twice. i can understand, in theory at least, the thinking behind the common criticism that turning Jim West from white to black resulting in little more than a gimmick, since Smith basically recycles his MiB characterization. well, it's a gimmick that works if you let it. it results in an essence of Blazing Saddles that i've always found quite piquant. and the property can get away with that, since it already had one foot in the fanciful. in whatever form WWW is the quintessential ""steampunk"" premise. (i know, the term generally refers to science-fiction in a Victorian setting, but any segment of the past will do.) it's the adventures of spies in the Old West for cryin' out loud, not Masterpiece Theater.
it must've had some promise to get Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh on board. Kline, as inventor/master of disguise Artemus Gordon, manages to develop as potent a chemistry with Smith and Tommy Lee Jones had done a film earlier. it's not quite the same flavor, but then Kline isn't the same sort of actor. they're as much fun together as Smith and Jones had been, so who cares if it took a slightly different route?
Branagh, meanwhile, plays a surreal but somehow viable cyborg variation on West's tv arch-nemesis, Dr. Loveless. yes, i do find it a little odd that they chose to cripple the nearly 6-foot Branagh rather than simply cast another midget. your guess is as good as mine just what behind-the-scenes circumstances bought this situation about, but they managed to work around it. moviemaking is often a matter of making something out of what you have to work with, after all. in any case, of the film's foremost strengths is that it so experiments with the premise. if it had simply cloned the series, what would even be the point?
(although i can easily explain the change of first name, in this case to Arliss. in the 60s, Loveless had been played by one Michael Dunn, and was called Miguelito (""Little Michael"" in Spanish) on that basis. obviously the pun became moot with Branagh's arrival.)
be any of that as it may, the choice pays off. it's often said that a given hero and/or story is only as good as his/it's villain, and Branagh delivers in spades. he plays an old school Southern ""gentleman"" who wants to secede because the slaves have been freed, and Branagh exudes the very venomous charisma such a character requires with seemingly no effort whatsoever. playing his famous Shakespearean training for all it's worth, he manages to be a force of nature without chewing a stitch of scenery. like every worthy villain he steals all of his scenes, at least until his ultimate comeuppance.
neither Kline nor Branagh does this sort of thing often, and both clearly had a blast with the change of pace. because whatever WWW might lack or fail to offer, it does bristle with the brand of exhilaration which some would say was everything in such a ""popcorn"" movie.
of course this a fairly late date to say so. that juggernaut has had more than 15 years to wreak it's havoc. it's sobering but not surprising that people can be so easily swayed from the ""work"" of evaluating something for themselves. this wonderful movie got a wholly undeserved stigma through the very phenomenon that gets lackluster or corrupt politicians in office.
besides, if we're completely honest, the root of the problem here goes even deeper than that. when all is said and done, good or bad, wonderful or horrible, it's only a movie for crimony sakes! it's one thing not to care for it, but failing to entertain you is hardly the same as, say, mugging or raping you.
how did things get to this point? seriously, if someone these days fails to ""click"" with a given movie or song or tv series or whatever, they often seem to feel a more seething, more passionate hostility against it than they could ever feel toward, say, Hitler. how did this piece of zeitgeist ever come to pass?
i guess part of it could be the question of first-hand experience. those outraged by, for instance, Gigli or Last Action Hero tend to be people who were born after Hitler had come and gone. in other words, they can understand intellectually that Hitler did far more egregious damage than Gigli ever could, but they've only heard about Hitler, whereas they were here to personally see Gigli wreak it's own havoc.
but even so, people should be smart enough to recognize that (a) the emotional factor is misleading us here, and (b) rumor has a tendency to get out of hand. there's something truly depressing about a situation where a spirited, good-natured romp like Wild Wild West could find itself on the same level of esteem as Hitler. it may not be as tragic as if, say, Jesus Christ were to be so reduced to Hitler's level, but it's still a bummer.",1345507200,,7116,4.6936
1247894,1,B00001ZWTS,"I give it one star for the couple of nods to the series - the gunmen hiding in paintings(""Night of the surreal McCoy""), and having West fight a metal skinned bad guy(""Night of the steel assassin"")
The cinematography was great, as were the costumes and sets - but that's all just window dressing, it can't make up for a bad script, and lazy direction.

Barry Sonnenfeld (""B.S."", as I like call him)is the culprit here, he tried to make W.W.W. into comedy, where the show never was, sure, it had some humorous moments, but it ALWAYS took it's stories seriously, and never winked at the audience. Will Smith might have made a good Jim West, but we'll never know, because he was apparently playing a trigger happy version of the great, great, Grandfather of ""J"" from Men in Black instead.  Kevin Kline doesn't fare any better, playing Master of Disguise Artemus Gordon like a fussy Felix Unger of the West, who's favorite disguises always seem to involve him dressing in drag. And kenneth branagh as Dr(""Arliss"" - they couldn't even get his name right!)Loveless is just annoying, Michael Dunn's original Dr. Miguelito Quixote Loveless would have fed this idiotic impostor to his flesh eating house plants, bit by bit, while he was still screaming. Oh, and Selma Hayek is in it too - just more window dressing, she had NOTHING interesting to do in this film!

One of the greatest assets of the Original, was the chemistry between West and Gordon, you really felt like they were Brothers in arms, either of whom would gladly lay down his Life to help the other. But in this movie, they basically hate each other, and they never really become friends - the last line of the film has West essentially telling Gordon to shut up. The original duo also had great chemistry with their arch enemy, Dr Loveless, but here, West is only in a couple of scenes with him, and it's just a bunch of AWFUL racist, and handicap quips fired at each other.

Well, I guess you know you're in trouble, when one of the best parts of your movie is the obligatory Rap song playing over the end credits, and that's pretty much the case with B.S.'s ""Masterpiece"". Amazingly, the iconic theme from the original show, was only used for a few seconds in the middle of the film, the opening title music substitutes a blatant imitation of it!",1341619200,2,2305,4.614634146341463

1247897,4,B00001ZWTS,"Today's movie was ""Wild Wild West"" starring Will Smith and Kevin Kline. Well, it's somewhat hard to even consider this oddity a movie. If someone asked me what the plot was all about, for example, I'd be hard pressed to give a coherent answer. The main character's name is West and it takes place in the western U. S., more or less, in about the mid-1800s. Rather than consider it a story, I'd have to regard it as about 90 minutes of assorted absurdities. Some are humorous. Following the story, if there is one, is nearly impossible, but if you want to watch it for odd jokes, strange lines, visual puns and widely assorted gadgetry, it's actually  amusing. enjoyable and entertaining. The gadgets, in particular, are rather clever and some of them are hilariously funny. How Hollywood ever puts these things together are beyond my understanding. And it obviously had to have major funding. The acting wasn't bad if you can get by with the absurdity. The filming and soundtrack are excellent. The story? Well, it's funny too, but in a moronic way. I'd say watch it if you have a taste for really odd comedies or if you're a gadget lover. Otherwise, you're probably going to find it a waste of time.

1247899,2,B00001ZWTS,"During the 1990's, Will Smith was getting started on his major career as an actor. He was featured in the television sitcom Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air. I'll admit, I was never too fond of the show, however any time it came on while flipping through the channels, I would leave it on because of how funny Smith was. Anyway he soon starred in the film Men In Black, which was a big success and is what got him jump-started on his major career.

With all of that in mind, in 1999 he starred in a film known as Wild Wild West. As a kid, I had no clue there was originally an old television show in the 60's called Wild Wild West that the film was loosely based on. I later learned from my parents while at Universal Studios in Hollywood, CA when we were sitting watching one of the attractions, which was a live-action Wild Wild West reenactment, which blew my mind away. (it may have been Knott's Berry Farm, I don't remember)

But anyway, this is about the movie with Will Smith. There isn't really much to say, other than this will probably go down as the ONLY western film Smith will have ever done.
The story and plot is decent, nothing new or spectacular, but good enough for a movie such as this one. Minor sub-plots such as the one concerning Salm Hayeks character seem out of place, but then again it's the ""Damsel in Distress"" that it's supposed to be portraying, however executed horribly. The acting is not great. As stated, I've seen Smith in almost every film he's ever been in, and this was probably the worst has been in. Though my guess is he did try with the script he had to work with. Kline was ok, just not the best. And seriously, the only other film I saw Salma Hayek in was Dogma, and she did far better in it than this. Again, I imagine the actors had a massively hard time making this.

What really drives the movies grade down for me however, is the elements. Ok, it's set in the late 1800's in the old west, so there will of course be trains powered by steam. There will be guns, there will be horse-drawn carriages, and of course saloons and cowboy boots. Since when were there motor-powered penny-farthings, giant mechanical spiders and other sorts of machines that either shot giant razors that would home in on a victim or otherwise?
Well it is true most of this movies plot centered around inventors, gadgets and such. But it is blown out of proportion and really taken to extremes.
The special effects were good though. With that, and the story/plot, those are the only things giving this film it's stars, it's like one star for each piece.

So why watch this you might ask, if the acting sucks, elements and overall final product are stupid (not to mention it had nothing to do with the original show despite character name similarities and the being the same name as the original show)? Well, I would say so that you can tell other people, that yes, you were able to sit through this. Otherwise there are FAR BETTER western films. I haven't seen too many though, I would suggest either Dances With Wolves or Back To The Future III ANY DAY before I EVER suggested this one. Actually I would never suggest this one. I would suggest any Clint Eastwood or John Wayne westerns instead.

The rapid enumeration of product patents and their proliferation throughout the western territories: the laying of railroads, replacement of wooden structures with brick, the development of communications advances, and the personal automobile all transformed the place we know of as the Old West into its modern equivalent.
Sonnenfeld here has cleverly respun this history in the form of a narrative story, sometimes metaphorically accurate, and sometimes hilariously inverted. When gunslinger Captain 'Jim' West (Smith) and master-of-disguise 'Artemus' Gordon (Kline) are paired up to defeat the psychotic Confederate and mad inventor Dr. Arliss Loveless (Branagh), it's an idealistic winner takes all in the battle between the traditional west and the technological Eastern invasion. Of course to throw things further off-kilter, Sonnenfeld has made our protagonist, West, a black Civil War hero.

1247907,4,B00001ZWTS,"The American Civil War has ended but not for everyone and not for every country either. Everyone wants a part of the United Stats and only Capt. James West and U.S. Marshal Artemus Gordon stand in their way. This award winning film is a timeless keepsake and really does show some of the best of Will Smith and Kevin Kline. Something for everyone in this film from Steampunk to Western and even Salma Hayek behind, a wonderful site to see indeed.

The film starts with a scientist running threw the woods with a strange metal collar with magnets attached. Chasing him is a razor sharp spinning disk like a buzz saw and it is gaining on him every step he takes till it catches up to him. Next wae have General `Bloodbath' McGrath played by Ted Levine pulling the disk from the ground as the opening credits begin to roll. This is mostly a fast paced film with a lot of comedic liberties to keep you laughing and wanting to see more. This film has a clever mix of slapstick, suspense, partial nudity of Salma Hayek and Will Smith and plenty of put-downs and innuendos to keep you entertained even after the credits on this film end. Director Barry Sonnenfeld did an excelent job of putting this film together.

James West and Artemus Gordon have been tasked by President Ulysses S. Grant to find out what has been happened to missing scientists as well as the plans of Dr. Arliss Loveless played by Kenneth Branagh who has demanded that the United States surrender to him. This film is a love letter to the fans of the original show Wild Wild West that ran in the 60's. It might not be what the fans expected but it is indeed a treat for them and was done in the spirit of the first TV show as we see the exploits of the first 2 Secret Service agents under Grant.

Loveless is a Confederate inventor that feels that he was betrayed by The South for surrendering to the Union. Loveless was a maker of advanced weaponry and according to the film the one to make the first tank. It was the use of this tank by McGrath on a freed slave town that caused Will Smith's character Capt. James West to start chasing the general all over the States. It was during the testing of the tank that West's parents were killed as well as the rest of the town. The tank was able to roll in and just shoot everyone over and over as the turret spun. A truly devastating killing machine and the type of weapons that Loveless enjoyed making and testing. He loved it so much that it caused him to loose the lower half of his body, a point that West continually reminds him of in pun after pun.

This is by far a serious film and anyone expecting the dramatic westerns that they grew up on will not find that here in this film. This is a comedy that you can watch with the whole family but be prepared to answer all the questions of the little ones that might be around you as they start to pickup on the jokes for all of us adults. This film also has some of the songs sang by Will Smith himself. Oh the days when Rap was actually Rap and not just hate songs.

1247908,3,B00001ZWTS,"This movie gets a lot of grief, and it's easy to see why.  A TV show from the childhoods an entire generation (it was made in the 1960s and syndicated as a rerun in the 1970s) is made into a movie at a time when the show is not fresh in anyone's minds nor readily available on home video.  The generation remembers adventure in the Old West with a James Bond twist, great production values and characters who were super cool.  Yes, that generation is right, but in the years that have passed, they forgot (like the makers of some of the recent James Bond movies) what made the show so much fun.  It never took itself quite seriously.

With The Wild Wild West available on DVD now, it's still cool to hate the movie and love the TV series even if you've never watched it or haven't since the 70s.  Well, I'm not going to comment on the collective's ability to dismiss what is a perfectly fun movie as trash while having no recent memory of the show the movie is based on.  What I am going to say is that Wild Wild West actually does a great job of bringing the spirit of the 1960s TV show to a modern audience.  If there hadn't been so much belly-aching when it came out, it could have started a new generation loving the old show.  Of course, Robert Conrad's outspoken criticism of the movie didn't help.

I am a big (read: freaking huge) fan of The Wild Wild West.  It combined the adventure of the Old West with the intrigue and suspense of James Bond.  The main attraction, of course, is the playful relationship between Jim West and Artemus Gordon (or, if you're a woman with simple tastes, Robert Conrad's sculpted behind in tight pants).  Each episode had a similar structure - Jim and Artie have to protect someone or something, that someone or something is stolen or kidnapped, they track down the culprit who turns out to be a lunatic with some strange idea of taking over the country or the world, Jim goes in with guns blazing and gets captured, Artie goes in with a disguise and breaks Jim out, then they both get captured and put in an elaborate death trap from which they escape using their genius and Artie's gadgetry, and, in the end, Jim gets the girl while Artie is left to make the coffee on the Wanderer (their train).  Each episode had its own take on that format, but that was sort of the standard plot.

Artie's gadgets on the show were usually simple - buttons that burned through wood, a derringer on a rail in Jim's sleeve, glasses that allow one to see certain chemicals.  The villains had more elaborate displays - a bubbling machine that runs on the brains of geniuses, a giant flamethrower cannon, and various death traps that used lightning or solar energy.  The king lunatic of their enemies was the resourceful Dr. Loveless, played by the absolutely irreplaceable Michael Dunn.

While there was no way a movie without Robert Conrad, Ross Martin, and Michael Dunn could entirely capture the spirit of the original show, the writers made an honest attempt.  In fact, besides the obvious story arc similarities, there were numerous references to the TV show including Selma Hayek's story which matches a first-season episode in which the main woman (Chinese rather than Mexican) turns out to be married.  Some of the gadgetry from the show appears in the film.  Dr. Loveless is probably the strangest deviation from the original show with his exaggerated southern accent and missing bottom half of his body rather than simply short stature.  The main criticisms most people have of the film are that it had too many one-liners and a lot of over-the-top machines.  As for the one-liners... the original show is full of them!  Jim and Artie make bad puns constantly, and Jim delivers one-liners with the gusto of the worst of James Bond (but still retains his awesome dignity because he's freaking Robert Conrad).  The machines were simply a product of modern movie-making.  The gadgetry of the original show would seem incredibly tame to modern audiences because it was stuff that could be built easily and quickly (and cheaply) for many episodes in one season.  In a movie, you can make a lot of big stuff or animate a lot of big stuff, so they did.  And all of the gadgets are pretty darn cool-looking, even the bemoaned giant spider.  It's funny, but at the time the movie came out, another movie came out called Atlantis: The Lost Empire.  This Disney vehicle was also criticized for being strange.  Yet, today people have realized that it was actually a neat movie because that steampunk aesthetic caught on.

Sadly, no one will accept that over-the-top steampunk look in Wild Wild West because they're too busy comparing it to their finest memories of the Wild Wild West TV show, and that's too bad because it's a fun movie.

The only way it could be better is if there were more interaction between Will Smith and Kenneth Branagh.  Their interplay and dialogue totally steals the movie and is a piece of comedic cinema history.  They were delightful together and are two of my favourite actors, as is Kevin Kline.  Selma I have never had much use for; basically she's talent-free and nothing more than cinematic T&A, which is also the role she plays in this film, so no surprise there.  She has always been a non-entity and adds nothing to the film whatsoever, which is a shame, because it would have been nice to have a good female character.  Put someone like Madeleine Kahn or Bernadette Peters in a role like this and it would have been pants-wettingly funny material.  Mel Brooks seems to be the only director who understands how to cast women in comedies.

Another reviewer talked about this being a Steampunk fantasy, and yes, for lovers of Steampunk (myself included) this was also great on that level as well.  This is not an historically accurate film, nor is it meant to be.  It's a comedy, and it's a damned good one.

At first I couldn't believe it- Will Smith in a movie like this?  Growing up a minor fan of his extremely popular hit TV show Fresh Prince, I didn't think Will Smith had a CHANCE in Hollywood back in 1999 when he made the switch to movies after the show had ended.  This is the movie that made me question Will's decision to attempt movie roles.

Luckily, Will Smith ended up making good movies after Wild Wild West, but this was certainly NOT a good movie.  I remember having fun at the movie theater the day my cousin took me there, but now I remember why I didn't care for the movie.

For one thing, every single predictable thing you can possibly imagine about adventure movies is probably featured here, and since every storyline twist is so predictable and boring in the film, you know what's going to happen almost every single time.  This is inexcusable to me.

The writing in Wild Wild West is absolutely bland.  It's not funny either.  I get the feeling the movie is trying to be like Indiana Jones with the style of adventure and light comedy bits, but almost *none* of it makes me smile, laugh, or even feel enticed enough to finish watching the film.  I don't even know if the jokes are just not funny, or if the film is more aimed towards children.

The joke about the guy dressing up as a woman wasn't very good because it was taken a bit too seriously and used too much as a joke to fall back on more throughout the movie.

Will Smith himself wasn't funny either.  His character was really good, but when he tried mixing comedy with the shooting scenes, it didn't work.

It feels like a movie that could have had promise had the writing been better.

Well it certainly LOOKS like a good movie going by late 90's film standards and Hollywood effects and whatnot.  Wild Wild West ends up being the biggest disappointment you could ever imagine.  Adventure movies are not supposed to be boring.  At least to me, it's extremely hard to find something negative about most adventure movies that attempt more or less the same thing this movie did.  This movie just completely misses the mark and isn't recommended to anyone.",1250985600,,2322,4.442080378250591

The problem the typical unresponsive or hostile reviewer seems to me to have had with this very popular 1999 film is an inability to make sense of it for what it is: a burlesque of 19th century Southern quasi-fascism in the guise of retro science fiction in a Jules Verne/H.G. Wells mold. (A kind of Right-rearding political correctness similar to that that marred the crtical response to ""Brother, Where Art Thou"" and scuttled the reputation of the rich and worthwhile ""Hurry Sundown"" seems at work here.) The film's battle of Black Yankee Will Smith and rebel ""salon"" dancer-hooker Selma Hyak against a post-bellum alliance of recent Confederate notables, would-be British Imperialist Civil War allies of the Confederacy and proto fascist Prussian militarists is hilarious.  The action is better paced, as well as more specatacularly conceived, than that of any other Sonnenfeld film.

Except for the sophomoric exchange between West and Loveless where they spew racist epitaphs at each other this movie is a write off.

Casting the African-American Will Smith as Secret Service Agent James West in the place of the German-American Robert Conrad makes about as much sense as casting Justin Timberlake in Richard Roundtree's place as Shaft. Conrad played James West as the perfect combination of a man's man and a ladies man - much like James Bond, except a bit less refined and quite a bit more macho.  Will Smith plays a wimpy, wiseguy, thinks-he's-cool-but-isn't James West. Before the film is half over, he'll have you cheering for the villain.

And speaking of the villain, in another piece of PC casting, the Hispanic dwarf, Dr. Miguelito Loveless, of the TV show is transformed here into Dr. Arliss Loveless, a double-amputee, Confederate flag-waving, Southern White. NO MINORITY VILLAINS ALLOWED!

2.the changeing of loveless's person to a legless southern general,and once again the race card is used to makeloveless less likeable when on the show you really liked him even if he was a mad ,evil man.

Second problem-The Confederate soldier was perhaps the finest fighting soldier in the history of our nation.  The endured forty mile a day marches, went perhaps three to four days without eating a morsel of corn, and constantly fought an army never less than twice their size.  The problem is in this scene seven or eight of our nation's finest fighting men being karate kicked to death by a single x Union Calvary man.  Third problem-General Bloodbath McGraft, wounded at the battle of Chickamonga.  There was no such general.  Forth problem-Jim West riding into Washington with the U.S. capitol dome being worked on in the distance...The capitol dome was completed in 1864, years before this scene was supposed to take place.

In fact, it isn't that these inventions such as the huge spider, the steam powered bike, the DaVinci aircraft, rubber noose, machine gun tank, and the super train were portrayed in the wrong era...they were never invented at any time!  Sixth problem-Gordon says that West should not enter the ball in New Orleans as a free black in a room of ""southern white x slave holders."" Only 6% of the South owned slaves before or during the civil war.  In fact, 90,000 free blacks fought for the South during the civil war.

1247938,3,B00001ZWTS,"I wonder if there's anyone out there who sometimes sees films that everyone berates, simply because you want to see for yourself whether or not they're right?  This was what drew me to Wild Wild West.  That and a desire to grasp how this state of affairs came to be.

This was a big budget summer movie starring Will Smith and Kevin Kline as the heros, directed by the man who cast Smith so well in Men In Black.  It was an action comedy with two heroes trying to stop a megalomaniac tear their country apart while making the Old West look like the future.  How could it fail?

My opinion is, it didn't have to.  Wild Wild West is overall not an especially good film.  But unlike some I've seen, I believe it could easily have been much better.

Who could fail to be impressed by seeing Smith ride into Washington past a Capitol Building still being constructed?  And the vehicles and gadgetry in the film are awesome - the look of Jules Verne with the feel of James Bond.  I just love it when futuristic technology gets dressed up as it might have looked 100 years ago.

Furthermore, Smith and Kline's characters (Captain James West and Agent Artemis Gordon respectively), although not expertly developed, have interesting parallels with one another.  Both have different approaches to their highly dangerous and treacherous job as government agents, yet at heart they are very similar.  Both are brave, cunning and capable, yet while Gordon relies on disguise and technical ingenuity, West is much more a soldier who relies most of all on his gun.

There's a classic ""buddy"" narrative between these two, as well as a ""mutual love interest"" narrative when the lovely Selma Hayek steps in.  Smith is the same wise-cracking hero he played so well in Independence Day and Men In Black.  Just like in Fierce Creatures, Kline plays two roles, also taking on the role of then President Ulysees S Grant.  Kline expertly makes one virtually indistinguishable from the other.  There's one scene where this talent takes on a life of its own, when Artemis Gordon disguises himself as the President.  Can YOU tell which is which?

It's the beginning that unltimately lets Wild Wild West down.  The action hots up as the film wears on, but due to a rather lukewarm offset I lose my initial interest by this point and only partly get it back by the end.  There's also Kenneth Brannagh, rather miscast and scarcely believable as evil genius and staunch Confederate Dr Arliss Loveless, who's survived the American Civil War despite having to be strapped to a steam-powered life-support machine cum wheelchair!  Oh well, at least his heart seems to be in it.

1247945,2,B00001ZWTS,"In the mid-60s there was a show called ""Wild Wild West"" that starred Robert Conrad as James ""Jim"" West, a western version of James Bond, and Ross Martin as his brainy sidekick Artemus Gordon.  This show was creative and intelligent and yet full of action.  The movie ""Wild Wild West"" starring Will Smith and Kevin Kline has nothing to do with that television show, unfortunately.

Will Smith is another Jim West and Kevin Kline is another Artemus Gordon in an alternate universe that never existed.  In this universe the Wright brothers apparently were asleep as Artemus and Jim were tooling around a giant steam-powered iron spider that is unlikely to exist in any imaginable reality.  Indeed, the only point of any vague historical accuracy is that there was a President Grant and there was a meeting of the railroads.  After that, this movie is ""The Twilight Zone"" in the west.

In this fantasy movie Kenneth Branagh plays Dr. Loveless.  Once again, forget the wonderful Michael Dunn as the original Dr. Loveless.  Branagh has none of the charm and wit of the original.  Dr. Loveless has decided to create his own empire based on the ability of his giant spider to trounce anyone who gets in his way.  However, he seemed to have neglected to consider that an open cockpit is a sure way to eventually be shot.  Along the way we see a number of other equally improbable devices that make for interesting special effects but continual disappointment with the movie.

I have yet to mention that not only is this west some bizarre fantasy version of the original west, but this version of Jim West has a continual string of one-liners that would have allowed him to do stand-up, but not in the alternate reality of this movie where no one seemed to understand his jokes, often including the audience.  Kevin Kline also had a number of humorous lines, though his were more ironic and involved, and typically based on technology that exists only in the alternate reality of this world.

This movie does have its moments.  If you like comedy and know little about the original ""Wild Wild West,"" you may find the comedy overwhelms the total destruction of history and scientific feasibility; or perhaps you like stories of alternate realities.  The special effects are wonderful.  I admit that when I could overcome my disappointment that there was no attempt to remain within the vision of the original show I was fascinated by the gadgets.  However, gadgetry alone does not overcome the unbelievable story.

Oh, and as if all the other flaws in the movie were not enough to disappoint a viewer, the DVD includes Will Smith doing a hip-hop song.  Hip-hop in the west?

James West(Smith) is one of the top U.S. Secret Service Agents. President Grant is worried about a man Dr. Arliss Loveless(Branagh). He has been kidnapping different scientists who are the tops of their respective fields. West is teamed with one of the top U.S. marshalls Artemus Gordon(Kline). The two are hot on the trail and find a beautiful woman named Rita(Hayek) who is after Loveless as well because he kidnapped her father. Now are two agents must stop Loveless in time, before he can release his horrible creations upon the U.S.
Will Smith wasn't really the right choice for James West. The complaint is legit that a black man shouldn't have been this big agent right after slaverly had just ended. It's ridiculous saying segregation took place up to the sixties. However, if you look past that flaw, then Smith really works. He is Will Smith and he has that Will Smith charm. He's a good action star and he excels in the action parts of the movie.
Kevin Kline is also really good in the movie. I never watched the tv show, so I don't know how these two compare. Kline is good in the role and he runs with it. He's funny as the crafty inventor and he's just Kevin Kline.
Salma Hayek is gorgeous in the moive. The was the first one I ever saw her in and she had me from the first time I saw her. Her acting isn't all that great in the movie, she's just there to simply look at for an hour and half, and it works.
The special effects are really good in the film. Once again I wouldn't expect anything less from a moive with Will Smith in it. They aren't the best ones from his movies that he's been in, but they are good. The tarantula looked kind of cool and there is plenty of stuff blowing up in it.
This was a summer blockbuser movie. The acting is terrible and so is the plot, but it's fun. The acting is fun, the special effects are great and it's a nice escape for two hours. This movie is easy to find cheap so pick it up for a cheap good time.",1086134400,2,2219,4.223529411764706

How about Will Smith and Kevin Kline as James West and Artemus Gordon?  How about Salma Hayek in a corset?  How about Kenneth Branagh with 20th century weapons?  Tanks, trains and airplanes!
This film is LOTS of fun and full of humor.  For example, near the end of the film, The giant spider even blows up half the town of Silverado, which in fact is the set made for the movie ""Silverado"".  So they saved money AND recycled.
The DVD has lots of extras, from the commentary by the director, to behind-the-scenes documentaries, to the music videos!",1074297600,2,709,4.543307086614173
1247950,4,B00001ZWTS,"Best:
1) The villian is riotously played by Kenneth Branagh using an over-the-top southern accent. He wants to undo the south's surrender in the U.S. Civil War by taking over all of America and dissolving the union. The way he chooses to do it is simply outrageous.
2) The 80 foot, coal-powered mechanical tarantula was downright cool to watch and the sound effects made it seem real.
3) There's a large array of James Bond type gizmos used all throughout the movie (by the good and bad guys alike) that are extremely imaginative.
4) Parts of the film were absolutely hilarious (like the guy with the horn stuck in his ear) and the humor blended well with the action.
5) You get to see the butts of both Salma Hayek and Bai Ling (ha).
6) There's a ton of special features - everything you could want.
Worst:
1) As much as I like Will Smith, the choice of him for the lead role of was just - weird. A slick-dressing, gun-slinging, smug-acting black man walking around freely so soon after the ending of slavery was pretty unlikely in that time period (but then, so is an 80 foot mechanical tarantula, I suppose). He did, however, create that really catchy theme song - hmm.
Recommendation:
The movie is delightful, the DVD is loaded with special features and the price is right. Get it and watch without any offbeat expectations - it'll grow on you.",1073347200,2,1348,4.551440329218107

1247952,4,B00001ZWTS,"So I was perusing the reviews for this movie before getting a copy and I must say that in regards to this movie, people came to the table with far too high expectations for this movie and had them in completely different areas in which this movie really shone.  The particularly vitriolic reviewers here should have known beforehand that a vehicle piloted by Will Smith with Kevin Kline riding shotgun would *not* be the next ""Citizen Kane.""  I knew this the first time I saw the commericals for this movie, but went to see it anyway.  I'm proud to be one of the thirty five people in America to have paid $7.50 for this movie and plan to shell out about twenty more for the DVD.  It was not a waste to me.  I do not regret seeing this movie at all in theaters.  ""T3"" and ""Matrix: Reloaded"" however....
I suppose my particular attraction to Wild Wild West was summed up quite well by a former reviewer who described it as ""enjoyable"" but not ""good.""  You must have this attitude to enjoy this movie, otherwise you cringe at what should elicit a throaty chuckle.  Of course the movie is miscast, even though Branaugh's and Kline's performances taken at face value are enjoyable.  Of course there couldn't be ""big metal spiders"", etc. back then.  This still doesn't keep this movie from being a fun, campy joyride that will probably engender a cult following in years to come.  Wild Wild West is the Plan 9 of the 90's.
My recommendation: watch it on TV first.  Yes, they still show it.  They also show the TV movies made from the original TV show.  Believe me, they aren't much better, despite what the WWW purists may say.  If you like the free experience, then by all means get the DVD.

1247953,1,B00001ZWTS,"Where did ""Wild Wild West"" go so wrong? It teams ""Men in Black"" director Barry Sonnenfield with Will Smith, Kenneth Branagh and Salma Hayek, and the only question afterwards is: Were any of them fully awake when they signed on to this royal stinkbomb?
Someone is kidnapping top scientists, and two US marshals are being sent to find out who and stop them from ... well, doing whatever it is he's kidnapping the scientists for. Capt. James 'Jim' West (Will Smith) and Artemus 'Artie' Gordon (Kevin Kline) soon find out who it is -- the evil Dr. Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh), a freaky genius with no legs. (Seriously, he has no legs) His intention: Take over the USA.
Are our heroes going to stop him? You betcha. Especially when they learn that President Grant (also played by Kline) is a target for assassination, because Loveless wants to restart the Civil War. (Yeah, whatever) So West and Gordon accompany the beautiful Rita Escobar (Salma Hayek) to Utah, where they hope to stop Loveless once and for all.
Like ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,"" ""Wild Wild West"" has lots of high-glitz anachronisms. The big difference is that LXG's anachronisms actually made a tiny amount of sense. ""West""'s anachronisms just seem like cheap draws to draw in the action fans -- the big droopy metal spider being among them, and the extremely intricate train (complete with whirling pool table). Unfortunately, that sort of stuff is only fun the first time.
When Sonnenfield is good, he's very very good. Here, he is not good. The level of stupid jokes and idiotic slapstick is mind-boggling, and the few attempts at character development (like West talking about his past) fall flat on their faces. Not to mention the scantily clad women, who crop up constantly wearing little more than dominatrix-lite lingerie.
Smith and Kline seem to be giving it their darndest, but they're up Bad Script And Chemistry Creek without a paddle; they really don't seem to know what they're doing. Kenneth Branagh is apparently supposed to be joyously hamming it, but he seems more like he's giddy after a few whiffs of pot. Salma Hayek is reduced to walking around in pajamas that display her butt. She really has nothing more to do.
""Wild Wild West"" is one of the movies you look back on and wince about. It wasted the director, the lead actors, and the audience's money. Only suitable for ""Lousy Movie Nights,"" so you and your friends can sit and mock it.",1072569600,25,2441,4.814285714285714

1247955,1,B00001ZWTS,"Wild Wild West is loosely based on the tongue in cheek TV show of the same name. Like most movies based on TV shows the producers violate the rule of TV in making the film: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Every Alteration here only makes this big budget film all the disaster you've heard about.
I didn't believe Will Smith as Jim West. He plays this 1800's Marshall like all of the other roles in his film career. Smith isn't playing Jim West, he's ""The Fresh Prince of the old west."" If you've watched that sitcom you'll notice Smith acting goofy and making dumb jokes while the rest of the cast acts around him. The same thing applies here. Smith doesn't become a character in WWW. It is essentially Will smith being Will Smith in a cowboy costume while actors desperately try to act around him and the horrible script. Kevin Kline struggles with the role of Artemis Gordon because they don't give him any material to work with or a better actor to play off of. He and Smith have no chemistry. Salma Hayek was only hired to look pretty and act sweet here. To watch her really act, buy ""Frieda."" And the villain was just too over the top. After watching this film and ""Independence Day"" I realize that Will Smith is the luckiest man in Hollywood. He has no acting skills at all. However they pay him $20 million a film for just being himself. I can only shake my head and wonder why the Academy nominated him for an Oscar in ""Ali."" SOMEONE NEEDS TO TELL THE ACADEMY THAT YOU HAVE TO ACT IN ORDER TO BE NOMINATED FOR BEST ACTOR!
This film was not only done in by the casting, but the script as well. The story about ex confederates trying to turn the U.S. back the way it was in the pre-colonial period was puerile. The more the story progressed, the stupider it got. After watching this movie I seriously believe that somewhere in Hollywood there are Chimpanzees running the movie studios approving and writing these scripts. Bonzo cannot just be a movie character; he has to be a reality with dreck like this being made by the studios.
But the producers probably knowing that in between the wretched casting and the horrible script that this film was a disaster pulled out the post 1995 bad film repair kit known as special effects and CGI. They figured slap in a few stunts and a few special effects and they could pass this film off by telling the audience Will Smith was in it. The tongue-in-cheek inventions were so over the top they were boring, and the giant mechanical spider was a gimmick to get people's butts into seats. Thankfully, People saw through the CGI ruse and stayed away from this attempt to create a Will Smith franchise.",1057708800,22,2646,4.457731958762887
1247956,1,B00001ZWTS,"All I have to say is, read the heading on this review. That pretty much says it all, folks! Smith and Klein make the worst duo since Wilder and Danny Glover in that forgotten movie in which Wilder ends up in a giant vat of beer? milk? Who remembers? Who cares? Which is exactly my attitude about this boring, cliche ""period piece"" (???) comedy/actioner. The special effects are mind-numbing, the sets gaudy and the acting pitiful. The three main stars (Smith, Klein & the lovely Salma Hayek) should stick to what they know...which is dissin' on Tommy Lee Jones, starring as the pompous American in obscure British imports (,i.e.: A Fish Called Wanda, Fierce Creatures) and doing a healthy amount of pole dancing respectively. Hayek's crack was, perhaps, the only thing of any substance in this skewering of a classic. And Buffalo Bill from ""Silence of the Lambs"" (Ted Levine) was kooky as the general. zzzzzzzzzz's",1040688000,9,914,4.865384615384615
1247957,2,B00001ZWTS,"Once again I say, ""Wild Wild West"" has got to be on of the worst films I have ever seen. I myself have never seen the original TV series starring Robert Conrad but the movie ""Wild Wild West"" was pretty awful. And the thing which really gets me is, it could have been such a terrific movie!
Two U.S. Marshals, Capt. James 'Jim' West (Will Smith) and Artemus 'Artie' Gordon (Kevin Kline) are assigned to discover why most of the country's leading scientists have been kidnapped. An old enemy of West's, General 'Bloodbath' McGrath (Ted Levine) lead them to the mastermind, a waist-high madman Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh). Dr. Loveless' plan? To take over the United States government!
The plot is nothing new, a madman threatens to take over the government with the help of a super machine created by kidnapped scientists. The only people who can save everyone are the two main characters. You've heard it before, huh? ""Wild Wild West"" was extremely interesting in the way they thought up of a way to combine lots of cool inventions and gadgets into a story of the 'wild west'. But it has its many downfalls. One being that the story seemed to lull at some points, like it's just something to fill in the time. There should have been more twists and turns, captures and escapes, or something!
The acting wasn't all that bad, though I must say I much more enjoy watching Will Smith in the ""Men in Black"" movies. He seems to have the exact same attitude, cockiness, and humor as he does in the movies I mentioned, except he lacks some smarts. He has a tendency to 'shoot first, shoot later, shoot some more and then when everybody's dead try to ask a question or two.' Unfortunately in this movie there really isn't given any chance for ANY of the characters to fully develop, let alone make you like and cheer for them. Kevin Kline for me was the best actor in the movie, him getting a chance to play two roles, one as Artemis Gordon and another as President Ulysses S. Grant. He was extremely charming and likable, a bit smarter and more sophisticated than his new partner. The bad guy played by Kenneth Branagh was nothing new, just your usual crazy madman. And though Salma Hayek is credited along with the main actors as Rita Escobar, you have no chance to see her much and for some reason was a very unlikable character. Though there was some attempt for Will Smith and Kevin Kline to vie for her affections, there is exactly 0% romance in this movie.
And the reason for the 0% romance is because of blatant sexual jokes and innuendos put into ""Wild Wild West"". For a PG-13 movie, I found it a bit too much, even resulting for me to fast forward and skip some parts. And I believe this is one of the main reasons for the downfall of this movie. There were some moments where there was some good, clean, and fun humor, but the movie seems to mostly rely on innuendos and dirty jokes to make the audience laugh. And I assure you that I did not laugh much. ""Wild Wild West"" should have had some romance. Even most of the best action and adventure movies have romance, including such hits like ""Matrix"", ""Top Gun"", and much more.
But I must give ""Wild Wild West"" the minimum of two stars for the action and special effects. Some of the action is pretty intense and exciting, especially the end. And the oh so super gadgets are VERY cool! I especially love the President's 'not-so-normal' train. Dr. Loveless's gigantic spider is dynamic, too. And Artie's numerous disguises are ingenious!
To sum it up, ""Wild Wild West"" had some potential to become a fantastic movie. But because of the empty characterizations, somewhat empty plot, and terrible and sick jokes succeeds in making ""Wild Wild West"" a flop for me. If you're thinking about watching ""Wild Wild West"", rent it if you're really serious about seeing it. But here are two other recommendations, ""Men in Black"" stars Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones who fight extra-terrestrial and ""Silverado"" stars Kevin Kline as a gunfighter who saves the town of Silverado.
Here an interesting bit of trivia for ""Wild Wild West"":
The movie 'won' 5 statuettes at the 20th Annuel Razzie Awards, including Worst Picture. Robert Conrad, who played the original James West in the 1960s TV series, accepted 3 of the awards in person as his way of expressing his low opinion of what had been done with his source material. :)",1030320000,7,4369,4.602564102564102

Will Smith plays James West, a secret agent man and Kevin Kline is his silly sidekick. The president who is also played by Kline, put the two men together to find a crazy Dr. Loveless (Kenneth Branagh). Who cares!? This movie is so stupid, I thought it was ""Dumb & Dumber 2."" Pure poo in a bucket. Then take the bucket and put it over a doorway so one of these characters can open the door with a dropping surprise! Oh man, they even threw in Salma Hayek (who is usually good), but smelled everything up in this movie.

It's not just that a black actor in this role is historically inaccurate to the extreme, Will Smith is a smart-alecky and flippant actor--totally inappropriate for this character.

1247965,5,B00001ZWTS,"WILD WILD WEST is one of the first films to take full advantage of the DVD format. From a visual standpoint, seeing this film initially in the theatre I just felt that too much emphasis was placed on special effects (which are now mostly computer generated) and development of the story and characters was sacrificed to this end. Subconsciously the viewer knows that many of these effects no matter how realistic they look can not be photographed because there is really no vantage point to place the camera. Our minds are just too sophisticated to accept this especially when seen on the large silver screen in a theatre. Somehow on TV these effects just seem more acceptable and palatable.  Perhaps it is all those commercials that are now filled with CG effects and proliferate our TV sets. In any event WILD WILD WEST looks great on TV and putting aside all the special effects it plays out as a very entertaining Western made from the same mold as the original TV series. It's basically a story of two secret service agents  (Will Smith and Kevin Kline) who report to President Grant. They travel by way of their own personal railway car and locomotive across the country pitting their talents against a villain (Kenneth Branagh as Dr. Arliss Loveless) who utilizes Twentieth Century technology in an attempt to conquer and rule the West. Director Barry Sonnenfeld has taken this format but now pits our two heroes against each other to see who will win the girl (Salma Hayek) and who ultimately get Loveless by the end of the film. This is a similar plot device that Sergio Leone used in successfully in FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE. As Will Smith and Kevin Kline develop in their roles they learn that they must combine their talents to defeat Loveless. Kenneth Branagh gives a brilliant performance as the devious and twisted Dr. Loveless that somehow strengthens the resolve of both Smith and Kline. There are some great moments in this film of action, surprise, comedy and bravado. All this is enhanced by Elmer Bernstein's first rousing Western score in years. Despite the science fiction elements Bernstein focuses his score on the West and Dr. Loveless' post Civil War Southern homestead. As for Will Smith's great performance of the WILD WILD WEST theme song, you can hear that over the closing credits and on the complete version of his music video included on this DVD.

Can you imagine how good this movie could've been if West had been played by Denzel Washington, and the plot played it straight?

Last time I heard, this film bombed at the national theaters. The chemistry between Will Smith and Kevin Kline isn't just there. Also, Salma Hayek in the role of an entertainer just isn't perfect.

And yes I'm well aware that this was the 90's and that movie producers had so run out of ideas that they felt they had to try and redo every movie that was ever made prior. I mean nothing racist about this when I say that it was a mistake to sign a Black actor to play this part. The traditional character of James west was played by Robert Conrad - a white actor. When they signed Will Smith they inadvertently made it a ""Black"" film and by doing so thus alienated a large part of their viewing audience. Its not that the fans were racist(although I'm sure some of them were) but you see when you remake a classic of any sort, you not only have to sell your product to the ever consuming adolescent masses, but also to at least some of the old fans to make it work. When they changed the color of the starring actor, they basically departed from the original so much that they were in effect making a movie that had nothing to do with ""The Wild Wild West"". And before you violently condemn me for my review, just think about say remaking the movie ""Shaft"" again and getting Ben Affleck to star in it. What do you think would happen?

Will Smith isn't too bad - he just doesn't have much to do. Kevin Kline, however, seems, as he always does, to be a completely blank slate of endless nothingness, the action sequences are sporadic and unexciting, and the film doesn't seem to have much of a point. Kenneth Branagh is just silly, and there aren't any other performances of note (Salma Hayek wears a nice bodice, but - like Smith - is just there to react to things). It's not really a comedy, because there aren't any jokes, and it's not a Ghostbusters-style 'comedic action film', because there's no much action. There are some nice special effects, Salma Hayek in bondage, and the music is suitably rousing, and that's pretty much the three positive attributes.

I mean, with pristine black uniforms never collecting any dust, silent, yet automatic wheelchairs, powerful electro-magnets, guys with metal brains, and giant mechanical spiders, you can't get closer the truth about how it actually was back then.

1247973,2,B00001ZWTS,"""'The Great Race' of the Nineties"" would best describe this exercise in overkill.  Like that film, ""Casino Royale,"" ""It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" and many of the other big-budgeted flicks of the late 1960's, ""Wild West West"" suffers from a poor script, an overemphasis on state-of-the-art special effects, a performance from Branagh that would make a first-year acting student cringe, and a lackluster turn from stars Smith and Kline.
The only refreshing aspect of the film is Salma Hayek who tries her best to do much with very little...clothing, as well as dialogue.",981936000,,572,5.021052631578947

The special effects were exceptional and extremely inventive, but they did seem to go a bit overboard at times as did the entire plot.  Kevin Kline, as Artemus Gordon, provides for some hilarious sidekick antics to West's straightforward but comedic demeanor.  The DVD contains commentaries from the producer and director as well as a look behind the scenes into creation and mishaps of the production.

1247977,3,B00001ZWTS,"In my youth the TV series ""Wild Wild West"" was one of my favorites.  Many times I rushed home from school to see the latest episode... So I eagerly awaited the release of the new movie onto video. (Yes, I waited a while to write my review.)
I must admit, I was a bit disappointed... but mostly because I know how good the original series was.
In the movie Will Smith is a questionable choice for the role of James West.  In the TV series, James West was a man with a cocky attitude and a reputation with the ladies, but Will Smith goes slightly overboard.  Smith does have a tendancy to bring his own brand of low humor to his movies (although ""Enemy of the State"" showed his real talent as an actor), and it almost seems as if Smith is starring in the movie as HIMSELF, not James West.
Kevin Kline, on the other hand, performed a wonderfully accurate rendition of the Artemus Gordon character of the TV show.  And all the costumes and gadgets that Artemus was known for in the series are here in the movie as well... including the tricked-out James Bond-style steam locomotive!
The villan's plot is even wilder than ever, thanks to modern Hollywood special effects.  Although a 80 foot tall mechanical spider might be hard to believe, the TV series was equally unbelievable at times.
The begining of the movie was a bit hard to follow... but the story becomes clearer as the film progresses, and introduces some drama at points, while keeping a sense of humor.
In short, it is a disappointment compared to the long-late ""Wild Wild West"" TV show... but not bad as a movie.  Even though it doesn't live up to the expectation of it's inspiration, it won't disappoint those who haven't grown up with the TV version.
The end of the movie seems to suggest there might be a sequel in the works... I nervously await its comming.  Hopefully the few wrinkles in the first movie will be straightened out by then",977097600,,1901,4.492753623188406
1247978,1,B00001ZWTS,"There's not much to say, except ""stay far, far away!""  There's so much hokum here, it's very tough to sit through the whole film.  I guess one could expect some aberrant film selection from Kevin Kline, Wil Smith, or Salma Hayek, but Kenneth Branaugh.... shame on you!
One of the worst films of recent memory.",971654400,4,309,4.6
1247979,1,B00001ZWTS,"Let's play guess the movie. I will describe a film and you guess it. Here goes. Somebody at Warner Bros. adapts an idea for a screenplay from god knows where, which involves 2 guys who has trouble getting along. One of them is portrayed by superstar Will Smith, the other, a familiar  caucasian.  The film has a lot of  special FX, corny jokes, ugly people, nifty looking vehicles and Will holding a gun. In the end these two have to put aside squabbling and fight against giant bug-like thing which stands on more than two legs. After that Will does his lil' rap when the credits come up.
What is the movie? Men In Black : The Prequel. Wild Wild West has nothing to offer except a head ache, a way of waste money and time. Will Smith disappointed us after he made people laugh with his show, charmed his fans in ID4, and had been a credible action hero in Bad Boys and Enemy of the State. Now he's in this appalling film that I keep wondering how could people waste money making this garbage.
 If you're a fan of ""Gangsta' rap"" and manage to see this nonsense, buy Eminem's, Dmx's and Dr. Dre's album and play it all night with loud speakers at high volume. Because if Will considers G. rap whack and choose to be a part of this, then it is best that kids of the world get a hold of the grimiest rap albums and see the nastiest movies with the most foul language around. The cast is totally wrong,  Kenneth Branaugh is a good actor but annoying villain. Selma Hayek's worst performance ever(sorry Selma).Kline puts more wit to the Gordon character but made him look like a sissy.
The screenplay is dumb and the 80 foot tarantula is just a distraction from that truth. Plus, Will makes a dreadful cowboy and the single ""Wild Wild West"" is a travesty unlike his ""Men In Black"" song. I was willing to see a Men In Black 2 but now I'm not sure Will and director Barry Sonnenfeld has it anymore.",971308800,4,1891,4.330508474576271

1247981,2,B00001ZWTS,"If you are a fan of the original, especially if you watched the show when  it was on in the 60s, give this movie a pass. Like The Avengers, the movie  misses the mark. Sorry, but a black James West in the 1860s would have  never survived in that era, no matter how good his talents were. Will Smith  seemed to forget that a cool, hip black dude works well in Men In Black  (e.g. modern-day movies) but totally unbelieveable in the post Civil  War  days. It's kind of tough to be hip and cool in the post war years when you  are constantly worried about some Southern gent wanting to hang you for the  least little thing (which they attempted to address in the film without  success).
Then there is the Kevin Cline role. Those two were at each  other's throats throughout the movie-certainly NOT the same relationship  that Ross Martin's character had with HIS partner! I think both Will Smith  and Kevin Kline are good actors but mismatched in this effort.
The evil  villian was just TOO evil-his killings were over the top for a  tongue-in-cheek, campy premise like the TV series. He certainly wasn't  clever like Miguelito, I mean, who the hell is Arliss? Isn't he on HBO  (Arli$$)?
Since everyone is so mismatched in this mess of a movie, being  a true fan of the TV show, the movie left me flat. Sorry, Will, maybe  you'll do better in Men In Black II!!!",968025600,3,1358,4.425101214574899

I'm guessing this film is supposed to be  a comedy, but most of the jokes are as flat as stale beer. The breast gag  didn't make me laugh, it made me cringe.  All the actors in this movie play  their parts as if they were asleep. The studio could have saved money by  scouting actors at a tree nursery. Even bushes would be more entertaining  than this.  In conclusion, it made me cry tears of pity for the poor saps  stuck doing this film, writhe in pain at the deliverance of those  ""jokes"", and wonder if movie studios let just anybody with a  script through.

1247983,1,B00001ZWTS,"This is a project that had everything going for it:  A terrific cast, a director with a proven track record, great special effects, a huge budget  and the promise of being the heir apparent of a successful television  series.  So what went wrong?  Because ""Wild Wild West,"" directed by Barry  Sonnenfeld, is...well, just not very good.  It's a case, apparently, of  everything being poised for greatness until it all went south.  And that's  pretty much the bottom line here; nothing about this film works.  Nothing.  Not that everyone didn't try hard, because it's obvious that they did,  right down to the last man and the last lame joke.  It reminds me of a line  from ""Mystery Men"":  Someone refers to another as being ""mysterious;""  someone else says, ""That's it?  He's mysterious?""  ""Well,"" is the reply,  ""He's VERY mysterious.""  Did they try hard in this one?  They tried VERY  hard.  But, very simply, nothing worked.  The usually charismatic Will  Smith (James West) didn't even have that working for him here; Kevin Kline  (Artemus) didn't fare any better, and Kenneth Branagh (Dr. Loveless) proved  to be one of the most forgettable villains in the history of the cinema.  His over-the-top performance could do nothing to salvage a character that  was anemic and uninteresting to begin with.  As for Salma Hayek, it's  nothing more than a case of a beautiful, talented actress being used as  window dressing; and here it's like putting curtains on the windows of the  Titanic even as it's sinking.  Sonnenfeld will have to accept his  share of the blame, since the director, above and beyond everyone else,  should have seen what was happening as filming progressed (or in this case,  regressed).  It's hard to figure how the man who gave us ""Men In Black"" and  ""Get Shorty"" (among others) could have let this one slip so badly.  It's  downright confusing as to how such enormously talented people could come  together and go so awry in their endeavors.  The principles here all have  proven themselves elsewhere as masters of impeccable timing, whether it be  in comedy, drama or action features, yet even that falls flat here.  It's  as if this project had a ""Jonah"" on it from the beginning.  As far as the  plot is concerned, I will not divulge any salient points; unfortunately,  there is nothing significant enough to divulge.  There are a number of  jokes scattered throughout the movie that are not only bad, but seem as if  they were an afterthought, possibly added to a scene only when repairs  could not be effected in the editing room.  If you have not yet seen  this movie, and if you are a fan of Will Smith, Kevin Kline, Kenneth  Branagh or Salma Hayek, or if you have fond memories of the T.V. series  that spawned this film, do yourself a favor:  Rent or buy ""Enemy of the  State,"" ""A Fish Called Wanda,"" ""Much Ado About Nothing,"" or ""Fools Rush  In,"" and let this one go.  Protect those fond memories.  If you absolutely  must have a taste of this, try to catch the music video with Smith doing  the title song.  That video is the best thing about this whole project, and  Hayek has a much more significant part in it than she does in the movie.  Twenty years or so from now, someone will ask Smith what went wrong with  ""Wild Wild West;"" and he'll probably reply, ""Who knows?  It just didn't  work.""  As for now, all anyone can say is, ""Who Knows?  It just didn't  work.""  And that about sums it up.",967334400,9,3430,4.648148148148148
1247984,1,B00001ZWTS,"`Wild Wild West' joins an increasingly long list of big bloated blockbusters, movies made for no possible reason beyond grabbing a quick  summer buck yet which, ironically, by their very cynical and slapdash  nature, utterly fail to connect with even the least demanding of audiences.  The result is a multi-multi-million dollar debacle that leaves studios  searching for answers and audiences shell-shocked into seeking out their  entertainment along the more audacious pathway of off-Hollywood,  independent filmmaking - the single positive outcome of these dull, empty  enterprises.
`Wild Wild West,' like so many films before it, looks to the  relics of television's bygone era for inspiration - as sad a comment as any  on the dismal state of current movie creativity. As one not familiar with  the original series, I cannot say what justice, or lack of justice, this  homage does to its source. What is evident, judging from the results on  screen, is that `Wild Wild West' is, as with most current blockbusters,  top-heavy with special effects and as weak in the nether limbs as its  legless villain. Straight Westerns being hopelessly out of fashion,  especially for a special effects-driven summertime extravaganza, the  filmmakers obviously felt that what was needed was a tongue-in-cheek  approach to the material, resulting in a bizarre, but completely unfunny  amalgam of fantasy and science-fiction gilded onto a Western format. The  disparate styles simply fight against each other, leaving no one in the  audience - neither Western nor science-fiction fans - satisfied.
The  alleged plot involves the attempts by James West (Will Smith) and Artemis  Gordon (Kevin Kline) to foil an evil Confederate inventor's plan to kidnap  all the world's most brilliant scientists and, ultimately, terrorize the  Union and President Grant into submission. This he attempts to do by  creating a giant mechanized spider which is, obviously, a last ditch,  desperate attempt on the part of the filmmakers to fulfill the seemingly  insatiable demands of the modern audience to be dazzled by impressive  special effects, no matter how inappropriate they appear in context. Here,  though, the miscalculation is fatal because even the audience is wise  enough to know when it is being had. Kline and Smith never achieve a  palpable rapport despite the usual abundance of lame wise cracks and  sarcastic asides designed to make them `hip' and `trendy' - two qualities  incongruous to the setting, which again shows the lack of real commitment  to the spirit of the project. There is exactly one clever moment in the  film - an astonishingly creative homage to the old RCA logo - that hints at  what might have been had the moviemakers been willing to really let loose  their anarchic imaginations and aimed for something truly sophisticated  rather than simply pasting together a series of confused, poorly written  blackout sketches.
Incidentally, even some of the expensive special  effects come across as surprisingly crude, especially many of the shots  utilizing rear-screen projection. Hence, this film strikes out even in the  one ballpark in which it might have stood a chance of emerging  victorious.
The artistic and financial failure of ""Wild Wild  West"" will, perhaps, help to put an end to the suicidal practice known  as the empty-headed summer blockbuster.  But don't count on it.",966297600,6,3390,5.264044943820225
1247985,4,B00001ZWTS,"the first time i saw this movie, i was amazed at how good it was. The special effects, the gadgets, the script, were all great. Will Smith is at  the top of his form, and Kevin Kline is having the best time in his double  role as Artemus Gordon and the President. I loved the breast touching  scene, the opening credits sequence, Artemus and James running like hell  through the field, Will Smith vs metal man. The writing committee, composed  by S.S. Wilson & Brent Maddock (*batteries not included, Tremors) and  Jeffrey Price & Peter S. Seaman (Who Framed Roger Rabbit, How the  Grinch Stole Christmas), come up with some very funny scenes and hilarious  situations. They have a great sense of humor, as you can also see from  their past works. Anyone who doesn't like this movie doesn't have a sense  of humor. WWW rules!",965779200,,825,4.589041095890411
1247986,3,B00001ZWTS,"OK, being an AVID fan of the original TV series, I was skeptical at best when I first heard that Smith and Kline were cast in the main roles. I like  both these actors, yet I couldn't envision Kevin Kline pulling off Ross  Martin's character. Was I ever surprised! What I really liked about this  film was that Kline did a fabulous job of portraying the quirky genious of  Artemus Gordon. And though the writers took a different tack on Dr.  Loveless' half-stature (albeit Arliss instead of Miguelito), it was  effective. Both Kline and Branaugh's characters tapped into that sense of  inventors of the fantastic that was evident in the series. After all, the  original wasn't a far cry from ""Gunsmoke"" meets ""The  Twilight Zone"". Even the scene where Loveless is spinning around in  his wheelchair at his New Orleans party was reminiscent of the reckless  abandon of Miguelito Loveless.
Still, the only thing Will Smith had in  common with Robert Conrad is that they are both hunks who look great in  Western outfitting. It's obvious that Smith is meant to draw the  contemporary audience, while in my mind, sacrificing the believability of  West by defying historical probability. Come on, that scene at the party  where he breaks down the meaning of ""redneck"" for the guests is  ridiculous. The best aspect of Will's character is his banter with  Branaugh's Loveless, again true to the original.
Overall, this isn't a  great movie, but it is fun. For those old enough to remember the series, I  think there are some elements that hold up. For the younger crowd, you may  well find it silly, but it's worth a look.",965088000,,1616,4.76173285198556

Kevin  Kline was probably in this movie to earn some money because you can't find  any compassion in his acting. If this movie should have been funny, it  failed!

I feel asleep after the first 20 minutes the first time and suffered through the last minutes the second time.  I  couldn't figure out why I didn't really like until I read another  reviewer's note that it was basically just MIB (which I didn't like)  married with sci-fi and a western.  I never saw the original series and I  felt like I never understood the high tech toys set in what was supposed to  be the 1860's.  Even my husband's explanation that the villian kidnapped  all the greatest scientists of that time wasn't enough to explain why  everything looked like it was set in Star Wars time but everyone decided to  be in a big post Civil War costume party. I also didn't like it because,  since the humor was on a low level, it could have been a family film, but  the filmakers just had to put in sexual innuendos and situations and  profanity.
Although the real humor came from the subtle inside jokes and  a few good lines from Will Smith and Kevin Kline, it wasn't a  laugh-out-loud-every-minute movie like the much better  ""Bowfinger"".  Plus, I'm always suspect when you have a white  straight man like Tommy Lee Jones, Tim Robbins and Kevin Kline opposite a  frenetic black comedian because the black character often acts like a  buffoon while the white character gets to retain his dignity and get a  lesson in black hipness.
Poor Kenneth Branaugh.  It would be better to  see him with Kevin Kline in the new Dreamworks cartoon.  Not only did he  have a bad Southern accent, but almost all of his lines opposite Smith were  offensive. Smith's clever responses were the only positives of the  film.
Smith has gone the way of Wesley Snipes, starting off doing  thoughtful movies(please see Smith in ""Six Degrees of Separation),  getting a big hit as a certain type (wisecracking action hero- Independence  Day) and forever being stuck in roles like the big hit.  The only time I  feel like the formula worked was in ""Enemy of the State"".  Even  though it wasn't really a comedy, it was a heck of a lot funnier than this  movie.

Let's just hope its 40% dropoff after  that first week was enough to enlighten Warner Bros. that Smith alone can't  carry the weekend - they actually need a script, too.
This isn't to say  the film had no redeeming qualities. Frankly, it's reasonably well-acted  and the effects are quality. What's being missed is character and reality.  I know what you're thinking. It's sci-fi/western/comedy, how much reality  were you expecting? How about enough so that a lynch-mob scene doesn't  culminate with Will Smith putting on a little Fresh Prince stand-up act  speech culminating with the line ""don't drum on a white woman's  boobies""? Let's give the movie-going public a little credit, can  we?

One of the factors that makes the movie so frustrating to watch is the fact that it is based on one of the most inventive and original shows I have had the  pleasure of seeing.  Inventiveness and originality are lacking in this mess  of a movie where the script is horrible, the one-liners stale and the  performances wooden(except Kenneth Branagh, whom you feel sorry for trying  so hard to be evil).
Will Smith is stripped of the charisma that is his  best selling point.  Kevin Kline, a talented actor is reduced to playing  second banana to an uninteresting hero and I have a hard time remembering  Salma Hayek is in the movie.
I didn't really expect it to be  ""good"", but I at least expected it to entertain me, instead of  providing rest I didn't need.  What a waste!",944438400,22,837,4.5
1248047,5,B00001ZWTS,"I don't really know why some people didn't like this film... I have seen it in cinema and I bought the DVD at the release date. Even if you don't like the film , the music is exellent and the DVD has a lot of good  things... The price is so low. Buy it and I am sure that you will enjoy it.  Will Smith is one of my bests and the video soundrack is really good.",944438400,6,361,3.675324675324675
1248048,2,B00001ZWTS,"I just couldn't get used to Will Smith as a cowboy.  The whole thing just didn't seem genuine, therefore disconnecting you with the characters.  Only a couple kewl parts, like when the man hiding in the portrait comes to life  and tries to shoot West.  Other than that, yawnfest U.S.A.",944092800,2,285,4.64
1248049,4,B00001ZWTS,Some ways I was disappointed - remembering the TV shows.  But basically I enjoyed it and thought it had its amusing times.  Kevin Kline is always good.,944092800,5,151,4.555555555555555
1248050,1,B00001ZWTS,Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen - and I'm a Will Smith fan.  Avoid this one like the plague.,944006400,4,106,4.0476190476190474
1248051,2,B00001ZWTS,"Just saw WWW on dvd and am I glad I rented it.  I could be more generous and give an added star due to its DVD content. It's quite a lot. But the biggest problem lies on the story.  It goes nowhere.  Its simple premise of  Loveless trying to overthrow the US Government became so stale halfway that  it seems Sonnenfeld decided to put a lot of action scenes (dull, by the  way) to lengthen the film.  Will Smith and Kevin Kline seems to try as hard  as they can to cherish their parts but you can tell they know this movie's  not going anywhere but down.  The fx were incredible though, especially the  giant mechanical spider.  Problem is too much effects with no story can be  compared to a book with a great cover but no substance.  Kenneth Branagh as  Loveless was pretty good but his talents, among others, were wasted due to  an attempt to make a big summer blockbuster.",944006400,7,876,4.314814814814815
1248052,2,B00001ZWTS,"Good talent gone to waste with a dreadful script. It's supposed to be humerous and off the wall, but nothing seems to work, the gags, the clever effects, and expensive production all gone to waste! You'd think someone  would have picked this up on the rushes! Anyhow, 2 stars for the expensive  sets and game try by the cast!",943920000,,325,4.491525423728813

1248054,3,B00001ZWTS,"Hollywood has a horrendous track record when it comes to adapting television to movies, with only two actual succeses--The Fugitive and The Untouchables.  For the most part they tend to vary between average (The  Addams Family) to thoroughly lame (Lost in Space).  After all of the  dissing Wild, Wild West received, I was expecting something of the Lost in  Space caliber.
Maybe I was just in the right mood, but this movie  actually amused me.  It isn't great, but it isn't as muddled or  heavy-handed as Lost in Space.  Salma Hayek is underused, and Kenneth  Branaugh's performance is hysterically awful, but it has a certain charm,  like a lesser James Bond movie.
Barry Sonnenfield keeps the pace light  & breezy, just fast enough to cover up those multiple plot holes.  All  in all, a silly movie to pass the time or provide a cheap chuckle.",943833600,4,847,4.751724137931035

I'm seriously trying to figure out why critics hated it. My best guess is that the Confederate villain makes fun of Will Smith's blackness. That seems to have irritated some people. HE'S THE VILLAIN people!

All the other criticisms I've heard about this movie are worthless. Someone said ""it's not realistic."" That's so stupid it doesn't deserve a response. Some other people say it's ""escapism"". You mean it's fun? For those of us who don't derive our sense of meaning in life from movies, or who don't look to movies as the source of our philosophies, ""fun"" is the reason we watch movies. And this movie really is lots of fun.",1518307200,,760,4.580882352941177
