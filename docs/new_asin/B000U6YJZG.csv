8212223,5,B000U6YJZG,"This is a great old-fashioned horror film. There's various nude scenes throughout the movie with some full frontal bits, but there's very little blood and nothing that I would label as being gore. It doesn't have lots of violence either, and the slow pacing in parts will be a problem with some. The purpose of the film is to concentrate on the excellent scenery and atmosphere, while usually keeping the tone of the film calm and then enlivening it with assorted nude scenes and occasional violence and action. The setting for most of the film with the mansion and nearby dilapidated castle in the isolated countryside is excellent. As mad doctor Howard Vernon wants to reconstruct his burned lover, she frequently roams the mansion with blurred vision in POV shots. The reason for her being disfigured is a confrontation that made her back up into a bonfire; I thought this was kind of silly and unconvincing because I don't see how she could just slowly back up into the huge fire without noticing. There's also a notable sequence when a woman is attacked and stripped by dwarves. She's then killed off-screen with only a little blood being shown on the remains. As I said, it's not a gory film. The title of the movie must refer to that rose with those poison prickles that kills that woman unconvincingly in about a second; they could've made this more convincing and realistic as you obviously aren't going to collapse and drop dead a mere second after being poisoned. Despite these problems, I still think it's a great midnight classic for fans of 60s and 70s horror. I thought it's really well directed, and the acting is pretty good also. The entire thing looks nice and with some exceptions with some scenes, the rest is really well done with all that midnight movie type scenery and atmosphere.

You get a segment about the film, and interview, bios, stills gallery and trailers for extras. The menu screen has animation, and the DVD quality is really good. I got the original pressed disc. Mondo Macabro is now selling it as a DVD-R.",1436313600,,2045,4.728291316526611
8212224,4,B000U6YJZG,"First off, this film is a retelling of Georges Franju's 'EYES WITHOUT A FACE' (1959), which was also a French flick, and a damn good one, and NOT 'The Brain That Wouldn't Die' as stated by one reviewer. It bares no resemblance to any Roger Corman film either that the French supposedly modelled their horror after. The other reviewer stated, ""long on talk, short on sex"" and promptly trashed it, but these types of Eurohorror cult flicks were deliberately paced this way, like it or not. Apparantly, neither reviewer knew anything about these types of films, letting expectations and predjudice speak instead. But I'm not picking on these guys, even Amazon has Howard Vernon incorrectly listed as the director, when in fact Claude Mulot directed. I can understand someone expecting it to be trashier considering the dubious epithet ""the first sex-horror film"" that's attached to it, though there is a reasonable amount of nudity here for the time. The plot is an elegant, mildly erotic take on a popular Eurohorror theme, as done by many, including Jess Franco's 'THE AWFUL DR. ORLOFF' (1962), which also starred Franco regular Howard Vernon. Actually, it exudes a rather classy atmosphere peculiar to French horror cinema, and though the film may be lacking logic at times, it is a compelling mixture of elegant sleaze and Gothic eeriness, similar to other Mondo Macabro releases such as 'MILL OF THE STONE WOMEN' (1960), 'THE DIABOLICAL DR. Z' (1965) (also by Franco before he became a hack), 'GIRL SLAVES OF MORGANA LE FAY' (1971) and 'SEVEN WOMEN FOR SATAN' (1974), all of which are worth checking out. As someone once said, ""A rose by any other name...""",1279238400,13,1658,4.925
8212225,3,B000U6YJZG,"Melot's effort might have helped the French improve their bad reputation of not being able to film a good horror movie. The short tells us he learned his style from Roger Corman's Edgar Allen Poe movies.  The plot stretches believability in several places, ie midgets able to trap extra tall glamorous women who could have easily knocked them over. The ending has a formulaic rescue to bump off the valliains which doesn't seem to have any motive behind it. The DVD is of nice quality for fans of this strange genre, plus some interesting extra features.",1230508800,2,554,4.770833333333333
8212226,3,B000U6YJZG,It's pretty trashy (with the midget rape scene) but overall it's long on talk and short on sex.,1191542400,6,95,4.333333333333333
