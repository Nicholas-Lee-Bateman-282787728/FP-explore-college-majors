Much effort was put into the perfect execution of kata to match the English translation of O-sensei Shosin Nagamine's definative text on Matsubayashi-ryu. Having been honored by Nagamine sensei to be the technical advisor for the production, it is gratifiying to see that it all transferred to film in such a useful and honest manner. The credit belongs to Nagamine sensei for his unrelenting desire to convey the information in his father's book with honesty and true dedication. It was a beautiful place to shoot and the production value represents the work of those days as if one were right there with us.",1297987200,2,748,4.8515625
8161558,5,B00005U8SB,"Part 1 of this series was a disappointment, so I didn't know what to expect with part 2. Well, I think this is the best tape that Tsunami has prduced since Uchinadi 1. Jam-packed with technical details, very practical kata applications, and unlike previous videos that have dealt with Matsubayashi Ryu, Takayoshi Nagamine's kata movements correspond perfectly with those in Shoshin Nagamine's textbook. This video is the REAL thing! Highly, highly recommended!",1040947200,6,460,5.402777777777778
