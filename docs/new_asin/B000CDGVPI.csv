2459206,4,B000CDGVPI,"I found this movie to be one of those little surprising gems that has the right balance of black comedy, rich characters and a wonderfully eccentric and talented cast.",1176249600,5,167,4.793103448275862
2459207,4,B000CDGVPI,"My husband & I saw this movie on a Princess cruise when it was titled PLOTS WITH A VIEW.  I tried buying it after I got home, but it was not available in the US, until last year, with the title changed to UNDERTAKING BETTY.

It is rated ""R"", but I think it is wrong.  There is no fowl language, but there are some scenes that young children shouldn't see.  In this day and time, I would rate it PG-13.

I have watched it three times and I still laugh everytime I see it.  It is a typical British comedy with hilarious situations.",1173744000,12,529,4.087378640776699
2459208,2,B000CDGVPI,"I think this movie had soooo much potential with christopher walkins character, but the rest was just unfunny, sorry chris.",1169337600,,123,5.2
2459209,4,B000CDGVPI,"Dry British Comedy, Excellent acting, Brenda Blethyn plays a roll far from ""Saving Grace"" however with the same Brenda Blethyn humor!",1168819200,,133,5.380952380952381
2459210,5,B000CDGVPI,"This movie is a riot. Stumbled onto it 15 minutes into it, but was immediately intrigued and had to watch. Watched it again a week later with my husband, and we laughed our butts off. The plot is ridiculous, of course, but clever and very funny. The casting was superb, as was the acting. It's great to see someone like Alfred Molina, who was such a...jerk...in Chocolat play such a tongue-in-cheek role, and Brenda Blethyn, as always, has fantastic comedic timing. This is destined to become a cult classic, just like her film Saving Grace. And Naomi Watts is great. Didn't even recognize her because she's so different in every role, but she plays the diabolical mistress to the hilt.

Highly recommend for a break from a stressful day.",1168387200,16,738,4.72093023255814
2459211,4,B000CDGVPI,"In this age of teen lust and endless sex orgies, it's refreshing to see the love of a mature couple.  UNDERTAKING BETTY is a lightweight, yet charming and oftentimes hilarious, look at a couple who have loved from afar for years.  Played delightfully by Brenda Blethyn and Alfred Molina, they are a joy to watch.  Alfred is a mortician whose rival is the impeccable Christopher Walken, who does some of his best recent work in this farce.  When the couple decide to fake her death in order to run away together, all kinds of complications ensue.  Versatile Naomi Watts plays the sleazy secretary to Blethyn's husband, and she is marvelous as always.  Add Lee Evans as Walken's rather buffoonish aide, and you have a marvelous cast to enjoy.  UNDERTAKING BETTY is one of those ""little"" films you stumbled on and are glad you did!",1143763200,8,828,4.708333333333333
2459212,5,B000CDGVPI,"The best movie about the funeral business since Rod Steiger played Mr. Joyboy in The Loved One. It's labeled, at the outset, as a Fable and that enables a latitude of theme elements. Love, hate, revenge: it's all here with absolute comedic overtones. A terrific job of casting overall with the added presence of Christopher Walken, at his demented best, and Naomi Watts excelling with flamboyant greed and nymphomania.

 Nothing R rated. Just a lot of fun with a happy ending.

 Don't miss it.",1141689600,5,493,4.833333333333333

2459217,5,B000CDGVPI,"I love both actors: Brenda Blethyn and Alfred Molina.  I also love seeing shows set in Wales (and Scotland).  And a story of 2 people missing out on  a potential good love, who knew each other since childhood.  This movie was very satisfying and very funny while getting viewers to its' happy ending!!",1479513600,,301,4.622641509433962
2459218,5,B000CDGVPI,"Hilarious and tender romance.  A really sweet, funny movie with very clever plot twists. Two shy people (Brenda Blethyn and Alfred Molina) who have loved each other since childhood but never had the courage to tell each other how they felt. She married a man who is a bully and unfaithful when suddenly fate brings Blethyn and Molina together and they confess they've been secretly in love all these years.  Molina is an Undertaker who always dreamed of being a ballroom dancer and he comes up with a plan where they can run away together and disappear.  Christopher Walken, who is hysterical and creepy  as the other undertaker in town discovers the lover's plan and agrees to help them.  I absolutely loved this movie. The plot is very clever and different, the actors are brilliant and the ending is very satisfying.  Absolutely deserves 5 stars and is a movie I'll watch any day I need to be cheered up.",1478044800,,907,4.672955974842767

2459220,5,B000CDGVPI,"Treats difficult moral subjects with a moral compass that is clearly lacking in Hollywood, USA.  I like to rib the Brits, but must really hand it to the makers of this wonderfully entertaining and morally redeeming film.  Even the sexually suggestive parts are NOT gratuitous and are important in order to show the wages of -- dare we use this word in a Leftists world? -- sin.  My wife liked it too; it's a very humorous & heartwarming chick flick in-disguise, and nearly as much a guy film too.",1477612800,2,496,4.550561797752809

2459247,3,B000CDGVPI,"We normally love British humor and comedies, but Undertaking Betty didn't meet our expectations.  The basic plot is convoluted enough to provide ample opportunities for hilarity (competing mortuaries in a small town, a harebrained plot to get out of a bad marriage, etc.).  Instead, we were regaled with silliness and marginal acting that turned us off instead of delighting.",1436918400,,375,5.338983050847458

Naomi Watts is so funny, and barely recognizable. Christopher Walken has never been this funny before or since. And Alfred Molina and Brenda Blethyn are not only funny, but charming and so romantic together. Thanks to all responsible for this great movie, from the writers, producers, director, to the cast. I love it-- I'm sure you will, too!

""Keeping Mum"" with Maggie Smith and Rowan Atkinson and ""Saving Grace"" with Brenda Blethyn and Craig Fergusen are close runners-up for great comedy picks.",1360368000,,672,4.843478260869565

An undertaker has a crush on a politician's wife. They go through extreme measures to be together. This movie along with the funerals had me rolling on the floor.

2459292,5,B000CDGVPI,"I was smiling throughout after a stressful day at work at this imaginative film.  It felt like the classic Ealing comedies of olde.  Director Nick Hurran adeptly juggles the demands of the film between the darkly humorous moments and the sweet but definitely not saccharine.  Brenda Blethyn and Alfred Molina are quite effective and affecting as the two unrequited lovers divided by circumstance.  Naomi Watts is deliciously tarty as Blethyn's husband's mistress.  Is there any movie that Christopher Walken can't steal?  Well, ""Wedding Crashers"" but I gather that was by choice.  As Molina's rival mortician, Frank Featherbed, Walken imbues his character with elements of a pimp and Vegas impressario.  He stages funerals that you'll never forget or at least try to forget.  My brother saw this on BBC America and recommended it to me and I'm going to pass on the recommendation.",1338681600,2,880,5.140845070422535

I run a movie club for seniors and ""Plots with a View"" (Undertaking Betty) is a riot of fun and very uplifting.  I just wish the movie industry would not change the names of movies to suit different countries.  I mean, the title sets the theme of the movie - would you really want a plot with a view if you were 6ft under?  The dvd was in good condition when viewed even though I purchased it used.  Well worth watching.",1337558400,2,501,4.123711340206185

2459298,3,B000CDGVPI,"In what could have been a hilarious movie, Undertaking Betty fails to take advantage of a great idea with tons of possibilities, a well-rounded cast, and the always superb Christopher Walken.  Instead, what's left is a few great lines and scenes with Walken shoved in between yawn-inducing drama and an uninspired love story.

In the small town of Wrottin Powys, there are two morticians: Boris Plots, the conventional, boring, and traditional option; and Frank Featherbed (Walken), a man with a vision.  Featherbed wants 2-for-1 deals on funerals, casket of the month specials, super discount coupons in the papers, and all sorts of specialized burials.  He wants theme funerals of Star Trek and Vegas showgirls; he wants the catwalk caskets, funerals nobody will ever forget.

When the opportunity presents itself for Boris to gain the love of his life, he devises a plan.  Since his love interest, Betty, is married to a counselor (although she seems more like a servant) with a penchant for philandering with his gorgeous secretary (Naomi Watts), the only way Boris knows how to win her heart is to pretend it stopped beating - he must stage her death.

The rest of the movie is nothing but sight gags loosely borrowed from Beetlejuice and Weekend At Bernies.  The two rivals must come together to teach bad people lessons and to ensure those who are pure and just get their rewards in life.

As Featherbed says, ""The root word of funeral is fun"", it's just too bad that the poor attempt at a sappy plotline ruined what should have been nothing but fun.",1207699200,3,1557,4.845283018867924

2459300,4,B000CDGVPI,"I wish Amazon allowed me to give 4.5 stars, because removing 1 star for a featureless DVD is a bit harsh to this charming caper comedy with a good-natured ""plot"", the kind you expect from pretty much anything that Brenda Blethyn decides to be a part of. An enterprising American funeral parlor owner wants to revolutionize the business by introducing theme parties, for instance, a Star Trek funeral for an old woman, replete with Dr. Spock ears. Some quirky competitive activity ensues. Funny twists of Cupid rear their head. The idyllic countryside is only a plus. Blethyn is a comic genius, in her own natural way, and even throws in an immaculate dance sequence in lacy chiffon. The surprise however comes from Christopher Walken, who sketches his slimeball businessman with insouciant timing. Naomi Watts is a pre-Hollywood one I suppose as her role is hardly worthy of a leading actress, but she, um, ""fits"" in well. One ruefully wonders whether this could have been a more popular film had things not gone so thick towards the end, but it's an entirely worthy rental if you're not looking for Hollywood histrionics and have been known to savor Steve Martin's romantic comedies, only set in the English countryside.",1194134400,4,1221,4.932038834951456
