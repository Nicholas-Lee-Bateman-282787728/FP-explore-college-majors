8052624,4,B0007WFUVK,"After a long winter of not exercising enough I was ready to get back into my Pilates routines. This workout is good if you are looking for a mild way of easing back into working out. This has two workouts but they are essentially the same workout with very few differences. The only difference I could tell was that extra clips had been inserted into the intermediate workout. I'd suggest the beginner workout for everyone because it is easier to follow. I would however not recommend this for beginners if that makes sense. I think the workouts are intermediate especially since they include an exercise called the open-leg rocker which requires a good deal of balance.

Also some exercises may not look difficult at first glance but must be executed with a sense of precision to be effective. Some of the exercises in this workout include the single leg stretch, criss-cross, double leg stretch, scissors, half roll-ups and full roll-up. To do the roll-up imagine doing a sit-up but going all the way up and over your legs to reach your toes. Trust me when I say this is not easy if you are a beginner. I struggled with this exercise for a long time before I could do it well. This workout  will help you to improve your posture and will make you lean and toned. I like that I can get a good workout in 20 minutes.

8052625,5,B0007WFUVK,This is a great workout. Very easy to follow. They also have beginner and intermediate levels. Very easy to graduate from beginner to intermediate. I would highly reccomend.,1218499200,,173,5.214285714285714
8052626,3,B0007WFUVK,"I almost want to give this product four stars because I do really enjoy the workout itself.  The dvd menu has three options: an instructional overview, a beginner workout, and an intermediate workout.  This is somewhat deceptive, as the two workouts are essentially the same as the overview, but with slightly different video clips that don't match the voice-over.  I find this annoying, so I follow the intermediate exercises on the instructional overview.  (After using this dvd for a couple of months, I also find the instructor a little bit annoying in some places where her ultra-perky tone seems a better match for an aerobics class.)

Initially I had a hard time doing the exercises without straining my neck muscles, even with my hands behind my head.  But after a couple of weeks of almost daily use, my abdominals were doing most of the work and I wasn't straining my neck.  It didn't take long to work up to the intermediate workout, and after five weeks, I find myself wishing there was an advanced workout.  I'm not terribly athletic, though, and I think I will continue to find utility in this workout for a long time to come.

8052627,3,B0007WFUVK,"I bought this DVD because it was a good price, but I'm not overly impressed with the quality.  There are two work-outs: beginner and intermediate, but they are taped at the same time, and the camera angle is just changed for them. There are also random sequence clips inserted that don't match what the instructer is telling you.  The audio instructions and the visual don't match a number of times, especially in the beginner.  The results seem to be okay, but not terrific for 20 minutes of work.  I wouldn't buy anymore pilates for life DVDs.",1207526400,4,545,4.645833333333333
