We were delighted to find out some time later that Netflix carried the 1951 Italo-French production of ""The Little World of Don Camillo"" on DVD.  Though in B&W, with English subtitles, this charming and wholesome movie was beautifully filmed in Italy and brilliantly acted by Fernandel, the actor who played Don Camillo.  The whole family enjoyed it!  To see a glowing 1953 NY Times review of the film during its U.S. premiere, click on this link:

3167552,5,B00175GAJM,"Back in the late 1940's and during the 50's, the entire world was dichotomized: Capitalism vs. Communism were the antagonistic camps, and much literature, both fiction and non-fiction, was dedicated to extolling the virtues of one or the other of the opposing world views, or describing post-apocalyptic scenarios from the unavoidable clash of the two great economic systems.  Somewhere in that feverish screaming, there was heard, read and seen a refreshing vision: one, in which the opposing camps could co-exist, and not only co-exist, but do so without resorting to violence and keeping within the confines of a respectful friendship and affection. Enter the novelist Guareschi's creation of Don Camillo, the parish priest of a small Italian town, and Don Peppone, it's Communist Mayor. The filmed version reviewed here is as close as any film will ever get to the author's vision, and the acting by the French Fernandel (Don Camillo) and Italian Gino Cervi (Peppone) makes the viewer want to stay in this town and continue to enjoy the company of such wonderful characters.  Recently, I read that the current Pope, Benedict XVI, loves the Don Camillo DVDs; but honestly, you do not have to be Catholic or Communist to enjoy these films - you just have to be human and have a heart capable of sharing the joys and aspirations of all fellow human beings.  As of now, only two of the Don Camillo films are compatible with American DVD players.  Would that the powers that be make all of these films available soon.",1296259200,6,1516,4.91015625

I am so sad that these brilliant versions on the 2 disc set didn't include
the Orson Welles English dub selection as an option select on the menu. Very surprised actually because that famous version is so well done too.
It is quite well done and is sorely missed on the DVD set. If you have seen the fine film, ""The Miracle of Marcelino"" ,which is also famous for the english dub version, done very well, offers both versions on it's DVD. Anyway, this DVD set is great to have and generally you would need nothing more, but anyone who knows the classic Orson Welles narrated version/dub will calmly sigh when they're happy to have this DVD, but so sad not to find it there with them there too like a perfect family. But, Enjoy! And somebody, Please, make the other one for the people too. Thank You.",1232755200,6,871,4.416149068322981

8264996,5,B00175GAJM,"It must have been over 40 some years when I was watching Don Camillo as an mini series on TV in Germany with my
children. Every week we saw the funny and amusing story, the ever lasting disagreements between the communist major
Peppino and Don Camillo the towns Your Holiness. Don Camillo speaking to Jesus on the cross in his church, Jesus
speaking back to Don Camillo reminding him to who he is and so fort....

A wonderful entertainment for the family, it is funny as well heart warming. I bought this for my now 49 y/o son, as an
Christmas present. He don't know yet, I sent it to him as "" FOR THE MEMORIES "" when we both were watching the show together. We enjoyed it with laughter.
I like to thank Amazon for having it in stock and in the English language. Money well spent. Monika Nilles",1354406400,5,794,4.293333333333333
8264997,5,B00175GAJM,"My best friend hails from Italy...and always insists that the ""Don Camillo"" films are on his top ten list. So...when these movies became available on DVD, I tried them and was overwhelmed how good they were.

Nothing like it in cinema.

Filmed in Italy during the 1950's, they showcase an idiosyncratic village priest (Don Camillo/played by Fernandel) who is always arguing with his ideological enemy, the communist mayor (Peppone/played by Gino Cervi).  As it turns out, the mayor looks suspiciously like Stalin, so the director has a lot of fun poking fun at the leader of the Soviet Union. However, Peppone is not evil, just misguided.  And at times, Don Camillo, as priest, is misguided himself as when he lets his emotions run away with him.  He is not above getting into a boxing match or cracking chairs over person's heads. Still Don Camillo is endearing to our hearts as a result of the enchanting incarnation by Fernandel.  His face shows every expression and his movements can be both awkward and strong. All the villagers certainly respect Don Camillo if they don't actually like him.  What makes Don Camillo so special is his absolute honesty - in his views on poverty, communism, the church, suffering, children, everything.

It is obvious that Don Camillo and Peppone must have been best friends at one time...and that deep bond never really disappears.  We enjoy their constant bickering because we are aware they won't truly harm the other.  Watching each Don Camillo film is like revisting old friends.

A striking aspect of the Don Camillo films is that the priest, from time to time, appears to be conversing with his statue of Jesus in his small church...and the statue gently but firmly gives him advice.  We are never sure whether Don Camillo is really hearing the words of God - or - his own mind. But the framework works beautifully.

Whether one is a Marxist, an intellectual, an atheist, or a Catholic, the Don Camillo films touch all these topics seriously and comically.  Sometimes both the communist and the priest are on the same side, as when they condemn the greed of the rich landowners. The films have a very European texture...rather than painting any side black or white. I also liked the cinematography which evokes true village life in a country town of Italy in the 1950's.

Most people in America have not heard of the Don Camillo films. They are missing something wonderful.",1342828800,2,2416,4.844282238442823
