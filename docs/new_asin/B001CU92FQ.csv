8529796,5,B001CU92FQ,This documentary is full of first hand accounts from the men that defended Wake Island until its eventual capture. They survived the POW camps & lived longer than any of their doctors ever thought possible. It is really something to see them return to the island & piece together each others memories.,1394582400,6,301,4.8076923076923075
