3427810,4,B00198X0UY,"I upgraded to Blu-ray from my well-worn DVD copy (the 2001 release).  I have not seen the previous Blu-ray release that came as part of the three-pack, so my comments below compare the stand-alone Blu-ray to the DVD.

The Blu-ray transfer is a definite improvement over the DVD, though not to the degree of some other transfers I have seen.  Much of the film was shot ""soft"" by Ang Lee to cover for wire-work and, basically, to suit his own taste.  Those scenes remain soft on the new transfer. Not much if any of the grain has been removed and it occasionally flares up.  So while it doesn't provide the ""digital sharpness"" (for a lack of a better phrase) of many recent releases, it does present what the director intended and I don't list that as a fault.

Black levels have improved and several scenes have had exposure levels altered (all for the better).  Coloring remains much the same as the DVD.  Most noticeably, the offensive random noise and dirt from the DVD release has been cleaned up.  That in itself is a good reason to upgrade.

Sound is now in Dolby TrueHD and emphasizes the clash of swords a bit more but it is no huge improvement.  I've never listened to the English audio track so I don't know if that's changed at all, but the sub-titles have been reworked and that is good news.  It seemed easier to follow some of the plot nuances (like the master-pupil concerns) which I had to piece out over several previous viewings of the DVD.  Extras are the same with one addition, a commentary track by Peter Pau (cinematographer) which is worth listening to.

Overall this is a definite improvement over DVD and fans should consider buying.  I always thought the DVD rushed and beneath Sony for a film that won so many Academy Awards; this is a good step up.  Oh, and Michelle Yeoh looks more gorgeous than ever in HD.",1280188800,31,1836,4.5181818181818185

3427852,3,B00198X0UY,"I don't share same enthusiasm as many others but respect the taste of everybody. one of the main complaint is the quality of  the 4K. there is a massive lot of grain in the footage sometimes. Can we consider this movie as 4k demo material?

3427853,4,B00198X0UY,"There seems to be an incredible amount of variance in how well this 4K/BD is being reviewed-everywhere from superlative to awful and the jury is spread all over the map. This is certainly among my favorite movies of the past 25 years so could everyone try to use my ""comments back"" section to simply give it a numerical score of 1 to 10(10 of course being superb) and a very brief reason why if you score it less than 8?

3427855,5,B00198X0UY,"I waited for a very long time before upgrading my precious dvd copy of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  For those unaware, for the better part of a decade (perhaps longer), Blu-Ray copies did not have the original theatrical subtitles that director Ang Lee is said to have written or supervised.  The DVD copy of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was the only way to enjoy what has been referred to by many as the more poetic interpretations of the Chinese language used in the film.  Other forums and sites have gone into depth about this subject, so without retreading too much of what has already been noted, the 4K Ultra HD copy that includes a Blu Ray disc does indeed include the original ""poetic"" subtitles that people have been waiting for (with only one small exception of a single piece of dialogue - If memory serves the scene is between Li Mu Bai and Jen Yu inside of a building during the scene where she returns the Green Destiny sword).

If you've been wavering on buying a copy, I would say go for it.",1497744000,14,1014,4.524590163934426

3427858,5,B00198X0UY,"I have enjoyed this movie for years, and the new 4K UHD version is a clear improvement upon previous releases.

3427859,1,B00198X0UY,What a disappointment! I watched the DVD back in the day so I was super excited to see that they released it in 4k.

3427891,4,B00198X0UY,"You can see the imperfections of the film used to film the movie, which in my opinion is a bit of a blessing and a curse, because if you are expecting a crisp, see the every grain on the concealer make-up movie experience, you won't see it, but it still looks beautiful at 4k, and the story is engaging and the special effects are a good escape. The English Voice dubbing is best done without the subtitles on though, as the subs are direct translations from chinese but the dubbing isn't.",1491868800,,489,4.384615384615385

3427922,1,B00198X0UY,"This is a review for the 4K UHD version of this.  I am a big fan of the movie, so this review has nothing to do with the movie itself but rather the quality of the 4K UHD version.

This title was disappointing in UHD, because when I compared it to the included regular blu ray, I could not tell the difference between the regular blu-ray and the UHD.  The picture had a bunch of snow and fuzz that was apparent in both the blu ray and the UHD disc.  The snow and fuzz were all over the picture, not just in the black or dark areas.  It was noticeable enough to be really annoying and ruin the enjoyment of the movie, which is otherwise excellent.

Perhaps if the film were remastered from the original 35 mm footage, it would be better, but absent that, I would get the regular blu-ray or even the DVD and save the money.",1486252800,47,821,4.132075471698113

3427953,5,B00198X0UY,"E.Garcia brought up a very good point of conversation about the differences in English subtitle translations between the theatrical version/DVD version versus the Blu-Ray edition that he purchased and reviewed in 2010.

This latest 4K Ultra HD + Blu-Ray and Digital Copy version, 2016, I just received today. I do not yet have a 4K player, so I have not checked the 4K disk (nor the digital download version), but as for the included Blu-Ray edition with this set, I am happy to say that the subtitles are as they were in the theatrical and DVD versions.

With the same example that E.Garcia used, the scene where Li Mu Bai first meets Jen for the first time during a fight with Jade Fox, Jade Fox leaves the two of them to fight, while she tends to the detective and his daughter. In this particular Blu-Ray version, Li Mu Bai tells Jen: ""Jade Fox can't be your master. Where did you learn that 'Xuan Piu' move? Jen responds: ""I'm just playing around.""

This Blu-Ray version looks incredible and I can not wait to see the 4K disk played on a Ultra HD Player. I'm already impressed as it is and I get the feeling that the subtitles will also be the same in the 4K version as they were on the US theatrical cut, the DVD and this blu-ray edition (fingers crossed).

Sound and visuals on blu-ray are terrific. No doubt this movie will be mind blowing in 4K. Buy this!",1477526400,,1364,4.444

3427957,5,B00198X0UY,"4K UHD Review:

Good news is that the original subtitles are back after the horrible version that was done for the 1080p Blu-Ray release.  Stuff like ""piece of cake"" during one of the fight scenes are gone.  Not sure what that version was about or why Sony did such a bad re-write of the subtitles.

Picture quality is good (I watched it on a Vizio P75 with HDR enabled).  However, there is noticeable digital noise (like color dithering) that should have been cleaned slightly.  It's very apparent on close up face shots in the skin tones.

I only use 3.1 audio so I can't comment on the full surround experience but everything sounded fine.

3428067,3,B00198X0UY,"This film is nearly as visually stunning as Hero (2002).  It's a complicated story and the characters are compelling (and very well played).

So much for the good part.

The wire-fu is excessive and the accompanying music makes it seem more like a ballet than a kung fu movie.  I don't like ballet (modern dance, yes; ballet, no).

The leading character (Jen Yu) is a spoiled brat who dishonours everyone she comes in contact with.  Even at the end, instead of cleaning up her wreckage she just flies away.  This is not a criticism of Zhang Ziyi or any of the other actors.  The desert sequence, which provides some useful background (but an extraneous subplot) is far too long and based on subsequent events does not cause Jen Yu to be more responsible.

This is worth seeing once or twice, but not more than that.  At this point I can't get through the first 15 minutes.  It's a pity:  this could have been a great kung fu movie.",1364947200,,931,4.476190476190476

3428083,1,B00198X0UY,"This review is for the Blu-ray version of the movie.

I saw this movie in the theater. I own the DVD version. The DVD subtitles match what I remember from the theater.

The subtitles on the Blu-ray are new, and they reduce the dialog in the movie to a bad B grade kung-fu movie.

This is one of my all time favorite movies. I give the movie 5 stars.

If you love this movie as I do, you will be bitterly disappointed with the Blu-ray release.

---Example: Original theater and DVD dialog

Isn't it a bit late to be out?

You've brought me the sword?

I do as I please.

Where is your master?

What's it to you?

Had enough flying?

You've got potential. You've studied the Wudan manual, but you don't understand it. You need a real master.

Do you think you are a real master?

Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword. All of it is simply a state of mind.

Stop talking like a monk! Just fight!

then tell me where Jade Fox is.

On guard!

(fighting)

Real sharpness comes without effort.

---New Blu-ray dialog from the same scene:

Isn't it a little late to be out?
You can give the sword to me.

I'll do as I please.

Where's your master?

None of your business!

Had enough flying?

You've got potential, but you've misunderstood Wudang's secret manual quite a bit. You need a real master.

A master like you? It's a meaningless title.

You're right, it's all meaningless. School is meaningless, the secret manual is meaningless, even this sword. It is just a stste of mind

Don't talk like a monk just because you're in a temple. Just fight!

Then tell me where jade Fox is!

Move!

3428084,1,B00198X0UY,"The media and the critics raved about it. Then the public went to see it, and realized they were conned. It was one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. This was made back when the Chinese film industry was still kind of amateur. They have improved vastly since then, which is admirable. Still, this movie is complete junk. Don't watch it.",1347408000,3,345,4.40625

3428087,5,B00198X0UY,"I agree with the superlatives stated in other reviews here, but would like to add that I saw the film as a hilarious comedy. When the wife gets done in at the end and the husband triumphs it is high brow humor. I laughed thru the entire second half of the film.

3428088,5,B00198X0UY,"This is a spectacular film about classic Chinese society, social values, philosophy, and martial arts.  It portraits clashing societal values with a girl born and raised in forbidden city.  As she ventures into the wild 'Jiang-Hu', she also uncovers the contrast between rich/poor, adolescence/obedience, freedom/duty, and right/wrong.

The action choreography is on the fantasy side, similar to 'Hero' and 'House of Flying Daggers'.",1333584000,,433,5.841269841269841

3428090,5,B00198X0UY,"I've seen this glorious Ang Lee masterpiece numerous times but this is the first time I've watched it (Blu ray) with the English dubbed in.  Sacrilege I know, but I was curious as to how they would do this.  Very well indeed.  In addition, I learned a few things that were always confusing.  For one thing, what's with the title?  In one scene we learn that the stunning Ziyi Zhang is Hidden Dragon, so I will presume that Michelle Yeoh is Crouching Tiger.  The movie ultimately is about the two women warriors and their great love affairs...no not with each other.  Set somewhere in the late Qing Dynasty (1880""s?), Yu Shu Lien (Yeoh) is part of the secretive underworld society of Jiang Hu.  The other major role is that of Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) a fabled Wudang swordsman.  They have a history of unrequited love due to the fact that Shu Lien had been engaged to Mu Bai's best friend who was murdered trying to protect him.  One of my favorite fight scenes ever occurs early in the film when Shu Lien chases down Jen Yu (Zhang) who had stolen a sword belonging to Mu Bai.  The scene is not brutal, but a poetic ballet done to the tom toms of Tan Dun.  It is quite hypnotic.  Some have snickered at the tree fights but I see these as elements of fantasy, no different than many movies.  In most cases the actors actually performed these wire stunts in the trees themselves.  While the primary love story is one of halting words and longing glances, the other gets a bit more physical with Jen Yu foregoing an arranged aristocratic marriage for a relationship with a macho desert bandit.  The many fight sequences are choreographed by famed Yuen Wo-Ping who did ""The Matrix"" among other films.  Yo Yo Ma adds his cello work to one of the greatest soundtracks ever.  This remains one of my favorite films of all time.  Its elegant, graceful love story has no faults.",1320969600,,1868,4.4733727810650885
3428091,5,B00198X0UY,"The sword fight between the two ladies is the best martial arts fight scene ever filmed, in my opinion. Bar none. Zhang Ziyi is a fiery ball of beauty, charisma, elegance and youthful exuberance all in one. Her performance is stunning.

This film deserves all the accolades it has received. It has a deep and multi-layered plot, some of the best action scenes ever filmed, romance, comedy, adventure and wonderful music. If you grew up watching Kung-fu Theater like I did, you will recognize many of the comic homages Ang Lee pays to the genre. The scenes at the outdoor eatery and inside the restaurant are uproarious comedy gold, particularly if you harken back to similar scenes from Kung-fu movies of days gone by.",1309478400,,718,4.790322580645161

3428146,5,B00198X0UY,"In my early teens, I was introduced to Asian cinema by Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, which I saw at the theater with my family. Before this, I had only watched a few Bruce Lee movies, which of course contained some excellent fight sequences thanks to Lee, not to mention that they were simply wildly entertaining due to the spectacle of watching a talented man at the peak of his craft practically tearing people apart with lightning-fast movements to the accompaniment of hideously upbeat 70's music. Even so, they were less than artful B-movies and so they did not fully prepare me for the majestic and wonderful experience of seeing a real Asian masterpiece like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.

The movie is well-paced and the acting and dialogue are superb.  Each character is fully realized and has nearly palpable motives and concerns, which serves to draw the viewer completely into the story.  Even the flashback sequence that takes up a large portion of the middle of the movie does not become tedious, which to me is quite impressive from a writer's standpoint.

There are two romantic stories in this movie that are opposites of each other; one is hardly acknowledged and has been growing with slow tenderness for many years, whereas the other is a passionate, tumultuous fling with an uncertain outcome.  The contrast between the expressions of love and the difference between the couples is very interesting and engaging to watch, and it seems to me that even the back and forth between courtly pleasantries and fight scenes serves as a parallel

Speaking of the fight scenes, they are not brutal or bloody, but they are very well choreographed and exciting to watch.  It's more like a kind of martial ballet, each participant gracefully attacking and dodging with surprising rapidity.  The only complaint I have is that the wire-work used to give them a gliding or flying ability does not seem as carefully implemented as I have seen elsewhere--they have a listless buoyancy at times that remind me of watching wirework during a stage production, where it's very obvious that the characters are suspended somehow.  Even so, the movie is so well done otherwise the dodgy wirework is easily overlooked.

As to the plausibility of their being able to fly in the first place, there is no reason to criticize the movie for what is obviously a mythological aspect.  In the orient, the idea of martial artists with such transcendent abilities is as common as wizards and elves in the West. It's merely a cultural distinction in the mythology.  Recognize that simple fact and there is no reason to become indignant over it.

In closing, I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys both excellent film making and martial arts, and it may even be surprisingly enjoyable to those who would otherwise avoid movies where there is a lot of fighting.  As the characters have achieved a state of transcendent ability, so has this movie managed to transcend beyond its genre limitations.

(Also, let me add that the blu-ray picture of this movie is serviceably good, although since it's a bit older it may not be the best reference movie for showing off your flatscreen.  Even so, still a beautiful film.)",1295481600,5,3205,4.896487985212569
3428147,1,B00198X0UY,"This cinematic masterpiece is ruined by the newly translated subtitles contained in the Blu ray version released July 27, 2010. The theatrical subtitles flowed smoothly and had a certain rhythm that helped the film win an Oscar. The new translations contain distracting juvenile language that ruins the original script and makes this an entirely different film. I doubt the director or writers approved of these new translations. The Blu ray version is not what the film makers had intended for audiences, and it should be pulled from the shelves until the original subtitles are restored. Buy the DVD version or wait til Sony cleans up their act.",1294617600,38,647,5.05607476635514

3428149,3,B00198X0UY,"I have the DVD version and saw this movie in the theater too.  Recently I got the Blu-ray version.  The subtitles of the Blu-ray are very suspicious.  They are significantly different from the DVD/theater.  Why is that?  Also, the subtitle translation for Blu-ray seem very ""Americanized"", as if the studio wanted to make it more accessible, perhaps, to U.S. audiences.  But having got used to the DVD subtitles, and not speaking Chinese, I can't say the subtitles for the DVD or Blu-ray are correct or not, or that one is better than the other.

Example: The scene where Jen meets and fights with Li Mu Bai for the first time.  Jen executes a move that astonishes Mu Bai, who exclaims ""Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn the 'Xuan Piu' move?"". Jen's response in the DVD: ""I'm just playing around"".  The blu-ray: ""Piece of cake.""  Now which reply by Jen seems more realistic for that time period, in that part of the world?  It seems more likely that Jen would say she's just playing around, or improvising.  There are two English translations on Blu ray, and they give the same translation, so there's no hunting for the ""better"" version on Blu-ray.

Throughout the Blu ray, there are many differences in translation compared to the dvd to make one wonder: which version is more correct, given that something is always ""lost in translation"" from one language to another?  These are glaring differences.  What's on the Blu-ray is very different from the DVD, and just feels wrong.  Anyone else notice this?",1290556800,198,1523,4.751908396946565
