8086222,3,B000BGH2KE,"Francesca Annis plays identical twins, Delphi and Diane, in this murder mystery. When Diane is murdered, Delphi becomes an unlikely suspect. The late Jack Cardiff was more known as a cinematographer than director. This film is actually pretty good. There are some minor flaws in it but the story becomes self explanatory by the ending. I had hoped they had a better more satisfying ending with questions about the characters.

The casting is first rate with Francesca Annis in the double role. Annis is one of Britain's most talented actresses. I'm puzzled why she hasn't been awarded Damehood yet. There is James Booth as inspector. Nicky Henson is fabulous as always. Dame Penelope Keith has a small role before becoming a television star. Ina Stubbs, Joss Ackland, Sue Lloyd, and Marianne Stone are also in the film.

In less than 90 minutes, you get a good drama and murder mystery with a great cast. They filmed in location in Berkshire and London, England in the early seventies.

I wished the DVD includes special features like a biography of Jack Cardiff or anything else. This film is great for fans of the actors and Cardiff.",1429833600,,1135,4.84020618556701
8086223,3,B000BGH2KE,English subtitles would have helped immensely.  The dialogue was virtually impossible to understand: James Booth particularly.  It was a real struggle to follow what was being said.,1271548800,,181,5.666666666666667
8086224,4,B000BGH2KE,"This is a pretty typical 1973 movie...  The music is very loud, and the voices of the actors are a bit hard to understand, especially the outdoor scenes.  (So much background noise).
I'm sure this has a lot to do with the fact that an old movie was made into a DVD, and I'm sure the editors tried to clean up the tones as well as they could.
Francesca Annis is beautiful, as always, and the ending was well worth trying to listen through the slow parts.
Overall, a pretty good movie.",1209254400,7,483,4.239130434782608
8086225,3,B000BGH2KE,"Despite obviousness of many plot elements within this work directed by renowned cinematographer Jack Cardiff, it is quite possible to enjoy the film for its merits that include expected polished camerawork and lighting, but also superlative design, plainly a result of competent research, and atmospheric settings about Windsor Castle, to the benefit of a somewhat unfocussed crime melodrama involving murder in the normally staid world of philately.  Action opens in a flat close by the Castle with a young woman, fresh from a shower, being bludgeoned to death, over two dozen blows to the face making her corpse essentially unrecognizable, and when Detective Inspector Matthews (James Booth) launches an investigation he learns that the deceased was one of a pair of decorative and identical twins, performed by Francesca Annis, the surviving sister, Delphi, employed by their guardian, a prominent stamp collector, with the titular item, a piece of enormous value, being target of a plot to steal it, this somehow connected with the homicide.  Filmed at London's Pinewood Studios complex and on location in the vicinity of Windsor Castle, including the House on the Bridge Restaurant atop Windsor Bridge, the windows of which offer an agreeable view of the Royal edifice (enjoyed here at lunch by Matthews and Delphi), the film suffers from credibility factors and an oddly structured use of flashbacks, but a John Scott score is reasonably effective (there is a seamless inclusion of police sirens!), and Cardiff leads his players well.  There is not a weak portrayal from among the cast, with even the monochromatic Annis being largely believable, Booth and Nicky Henson providing strong turns as the case investigators; Joss Ackland gains acting honours as Jones, supervising police official in the matter.",1140912000,13,1812,5.328671328671328
8086226,4,B000BGH2KE,"All things considered(price,quality and story), this is a good value.  The image quality is good.  The plot while a bit slow, did suprise me at the end.  Look for cameos by Penelope Keith and John Rhys-Davies. This seems like a British made-for-television movie.  Geneon [Pioneer] ver.",1135555200,7,285,5.130434782608695
