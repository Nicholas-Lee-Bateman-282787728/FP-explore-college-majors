I can't understand with the ""hundreds"" of
mini cartoon features WB suposedly created
of these two characters WHY they don't
release more original material.  it seems
WB keeps releasing the same six or eight
roadrunner shorts in every production.
LETS SEE THE OTHERS!!!!!! ALL OF THEM!!!",1304726400,,327,5.411764705882353
7866735,5,6304214618,"This compilation of classic Roadrunner/Coyote episodes is sure to amuse those who aren't so politically correct these days. These awesome cartoons came out in an innocent age where violence such as falling off of cliffs or dynamite blowing up didn't matter too much. Nowadays, our youth is looked at as too vulnerable. Aside from the political philosophy, this video is short, but has enough in it to generate some good laughs while getting ready for school or work, for example. I consider all of the Looney Tunes to be classics, but the Roadrunner reigns superior. There's just something about the frustration and constant failure of Wily E. Coyote in trying to capture the Roadrunner. Wily never seems to get too injured, either!! Oh, and he keeps the ACME people in business, too!! It's classic cat/mouse that's super-funny to watch. The kids should love these!!",1297728000,2,866,5.020833333333333
7866736,5,6304214618,"Right when I got this Roadrunner video in the mail, I knew that I was in for a looney treat!  I was right.  I watched it all the way through and the quality has never been better!!!  I laughed at cartoons that I hadn't seen before and cartoons I have enjoyed over and over again.  A must-have for any looney-tunes fan!

Includes:

""Gee Whiz-z-z""
An old classic that I have loved where Wil E. Coyote tries to catch Roadrunner with all new jokes that always backfire (and smash poor Wil E.)

""Zoom and Bored""
My all time favoite Roadrunner cartoon with all new gags!

""Fast and Furry-ous""
The very first cartoon ever made! (Be glad. It's restored this time!)

""Zip N' Snort""
The Roadrunner keeps the fun on track while at the controles of a train.  (Notice that Wil E. and Roadrunner are drawn slightly different at the beginning)

""Hook, Line, and Stinker""
All there is to say: Another VERY funny cartoon

""Hot Rod and Reel""
Where everything 'reels' back at Wil E.  This cartoon also provides the answer on how to stop a jet propelled unicycle (answer: you don't!)

Did you know that the Roadrunner says ""Meep-meep"" and not ""Beep-beep""?!",1181779200,2,1136,4.587064676616915
7866737,3,6304214618,"Chuck Jones creations, Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote, still is one of the longest running pair of cartoon chasers in animation history. The Stars From Space Jam collection, still shows that without any acceptions.
The cartoon collection consists of six cartoon the late Chuck Jones, who passed away in February 2002, directed in fullest bloom. His feel for the two is still shown in cartoons like Hook, Line, And Stinker, The Hot-Rod And Reel!, and Fast and Furry-ous.
Considering it is a welcome surprise to any fan. However, if you have Road Runner vs. Wile E. Coyote: The Classic Chase, and A Salute To Chuck Jones, both from Warner Brothers Golden Jubilee 24 Karat Collection, this collection isn't worth the extra money. Sure it still has good laughs, but five of the six cartoons were featured from the Golden Jubilee Collection. The only one that came to video for the first time is The Hot-Rod And Reel!
Still, this collection of the most unique pair of chasers can always know how to storm up an audience. The Road Runner and Wile. E. Coyote, are still known for that feel in thought.",1015372800,,1094,4.703125
7866738,5,6304214618,"This is an excellent choice of classic Road Runner cartoons. All six of these cartoons are restored with sound and picture quality.
GEE WHIZ-Z-Z-Z: How many ""z's"" does this have in its title. Note that this is the last time Chuck Jones will ever be called Charles M. Jones again. As for this cartoon itself, I'm surprised. This has somehow become a classic, even though there's nothing that special. Other than Coyote's batman impression, no a very special. However, this is the only time a cartoon was ended before Coyote got hurt.
ZOOM AND BORED: On the other hand, this is a great cartoon filled with some great new gags that have never before been done. The quality has never been better before. This a quite worth buying. There's no gags here that have been used before.
FAST AND FURRY-OUS: This is the first roadrunner cartoon ever made, and this is one of the best. The quality has been restored from it's original TV print. This was in desperate need of restorment. A great ending for the first cartoon.
HOOK, LINE, AND STINKER: Notice that both Coyote and the Roadrunner are drawn slightly differently at the beginning. This is another great cartoon, filled with some new ideas.
ZIP 'N' SNORT: The second best Road Runner cartoon next to TO BEEP OR NOT TO BEEP, my favorite. This has some hilarious gags and new ideas. The best Roadrunner cartoons are made in the 1960's and the streak continues here.
HOT ROD AND REEL: Other than copying the dynamite ramp from ZOOM AND BORED, this is a gem, with some great music and a restored soundtrack. This is great.
If you're a Road Runner fan, this tape's for you.",1014595200,4,1615,4.630662020905923
