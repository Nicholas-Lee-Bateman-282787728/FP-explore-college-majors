2516481,4,B000EDWKXI,"Casanova is an enjoyable film. Alot of fun and very entertaining. Everyone involved are terrific. I love Heath Ledger as Casanova. I think its so great that he has two very different movies out on dvd ( Brokeback Mountain & Casanova ) that showcase his talents and versatility. I enjoy him in light farce just as much as in drama. Casanova is a delight to add to Mr. Ledger's filmography and definitely to all Heath Ledger admirers, such as myself. :)",1145404800,4,451,4.580246913580247
2516482,4,B000EDWKXI,"the story itself is not good enough to make the film great. the classical monotonus rigid tempo sound track sometimes is quite annoying. the hairdo with the sideburns of ledger's casanova sometimes makes him look like X-man. his voice is too thick and too low and not attrative at all. sienna miller is a wonderful cast, very appropriate. the english actress who played victoria should  aware herself and pay more attention to her right lopsided mouth, she's too young to get that lopside habit. great cast, great costumes. all the ingredients were there for a great movie, but simply went flat by a mediocre screenplay and the lousy deadbeat sound track.",1145145600,,655,4.900900900900901
2516483,4,B000EDWKXI,"This is the first of Hallstrom's films that I've seen, and I gather it's by no means typical of his recent work. However, I found it immensely entertaining. It bears little reference to the Chevalier de Seingalt's life, but once you've got over that (ideally before you see it) it is highly enjoyable. The imaginative and brilliant photography of a Venice peopled with the colourful characters and costumes of the ridotto in the city's heyday makes the film worth seeing for that alone. Venice should always look this good; its inhabitants should always wear the costume of this period.

Then the acting is good and plausible. I spent some time trying to work out who it was that Heath Ledger reminded me of, and eventually realised that it was Russell Crowe, not so much in looks as something about his manner. Jeremy Irons is hilarious and others well up to par. The film was well-paced, building to a comic finale.

I think the great point is to grasp that the whole thing was clearly conceived as a sort of Commedia dell'Arte, knockabout farce with very little sex but plenty of misunderstandings, mistaken identities and laugh-out-loud moments. And, of course, love. I thought it was made in very much the manner that operas like The Marriage of Figaro or The Barber of Seville would have been conceived and performed in when they first came out - in fact it shed new light on those for me.

Not a great film - it's a bit too slight for that - but a good, well-made, highly enjoyable romp.",1141603200,18,1494,4.630188679245283

2516495,4,B000EDWKXI,"The critics hated this movie  but I really enjoyed it. Actually, I bought it a little while ago, lol!
OK, ""Casanova"" may not be Oscar material, but it's funny & charming, and a ""real"" love affair. (Of course - he IS Casanova, after all!) Unfortunately for him, the woman he falls for is a suffragette, & wants nothing to do with love. Especially if it's with a rouge with a bad reputation of seducing  then leaving  most of the women in Venice!
The movie is pretty easy to figure out, I.E. what's going to happen to each character, (except for a couple of scenes close to the end, they suprised & delighted me) but it's a fun movie, full of dry humor, and watching the hilarious antics of Casanova stumbling through the complications of loving the only woman who doesn't want anything to do with him...

I was pleasantly surprised that Heath Ledger played Casanova, as it wasn't quite his panache. But he dove into the role, adding his own wonderful style, and made the character his. Just those little flashes throughout the movie made me smile.

If you haven't seen it, you need too! It's a great ""feel good"" movie!",1482969600,3,1117,4.537313432835821

Jeremy Irons and Oliver Platt are superb. Director Lasse Hallstrm shows us, once again, his sensibility for describing tenderness, friendship and love. Beautiful music by Rameau, Vivaldi, Albinoni and other Baroque masters. Charming costumes. The whole movie was shot in Venice, which gives the film a lot of beauty and splendor.

2516539,5,B000EDWKXI,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  It's a romp, a spoof, an adventure starting with Casanove doing what Casanova does in an upscale nunnery for the daughters and nieces of the elite.  Signals indicate the authorities have entered the building.  He jumps into clothes, grabs the rest, and starts running down the marble hall with the nuns waving from their doors and shouting, ""Don't forget me!""  He climbs out a window onto the tiled  roof in Venice (where this movie was filmed).  The group of authorities follow.  One looses footing and plops into the canal below.  Casanova also looses footing, but stops his slide inches from going into the canal and escapes by leaping the canal, and clawing his way up over the window sill and into a lecture hall in the Doge's palace where the wigged and robed intellectuals are listening to lectures on the subject of women.  The lecturers include a Bernardo Guardi, already damned by the Catholic church as a heretic.  In his escape from the nunnery, he drops a shoe in the chambers of Sister Beatrice, niece of the Cardinal, and the the chief authority comes after him.

Next we're spectators in a trial of Casanove for fornication in a nunnery and hear him sentenced to be hanged at dawn.  The Doge enters and informs the judge that his witness (Sister Beatrice) is the niece of the Cardinal who will be mightily upset at this scandale in his family, The doge places Casanove under his protection and the case is dismissed.  As they walk outside along the arcade beside the Doge's plaice,  he informs Casanove that he's banishing him from Venice for his own good.  The only way he'll let him stay is if he finds a reputable woman of property and marries her.  Thus begins the shopping for such a woman all over Venice, by Casanove and his man-servant, and his finally settling for the girl in the window across the canal from a family that is destined to play a huge role in life.  Her father accepts Casanova's proposal, the young woman is smitten and can hardly wait.

But Casanova discovers he's engaged to the wrong young woman and falls head-over-heels for the young woman across the canal form his fiancee.  He  discovers that she is, in fact, Bernardo Guardi, the writer/heretic,  who disguises herself as a man.  She was, in fact, the lecturer in the Doge's palace when he jumped the canal and climbed into the lecture hall.  In his/her writings she rails against such men as Casanova who seek pleasure with women, and are destined to be untrue.

How he manages a duel, finds that his love does NOT have a secret lover as rumored,  how he survives a night at a Carnival ball with two women looking for him, how he elude the Pope's chief of the Inquisition (played masterfully by Jeremy Irons), wins his love and escapes another hanging. enliving the rest of the film.  The only  movie entirely filmed in Venice (in some of the most beautiful interiors in the world). this movie is gorgeous,  sexy, and fun.  The surprise ending leaves everybody but the Inquisitor very happy.  A must see!",1408838400,2,3050,4.657303370786517

2516541,4,B000EDWKXI,"I don't know why critics took this movie so seriously and rated it low.  I doubt anyone thinks it's cerebral so rate it as such.  Oliver Platt is fantastic!  Jeremy Irons, Heath Ledger, Omid Djalili, etc are all great.  The only cast member I don't like is Sienna Miller.  It's a sweet, lighthearted film.  When I'm having a bad day as I was when I rented this (just diagnosed w/MS), I like to watch it.  Especially the scene when Platt is being ""transformed"" by Ledger.",1400457600,2,470,4.458823529411765

No swearing.no major violence. One two second scene of nudity.

Cutesy film but nothing to be swooned at.
I like the premise. Strong female kicking primeval male butts.

2516543,4,B000EDWKXI,"Heath Ledger as Casanova is fantastic. I like that this movie is light hearted and playful. They could have took the movie and made it completely about Casanova's conquests, which would have been interesting as well, but they made it more of a historic-rom-com.

2516545,5,B000EDWKXI,"This is by far my favorite Lasse Halstrom film.  Cinematically it's sublime.  Heath Ledger and Sienna Miller are fantastic.  Lena Olin is gorgeous, as always.  Lots of funny scenes, some a bit slapstick.  ""Mistaken identity"" is a reoccurring theme throughout.  Music is wonderful (so I had to buy the soundtrack as well).  The director's commentary gives all sorts of interesting insights into the making of the film.  For example, they used smoke in some of the Venetian rooms for visual effect at first, but then unfortunately were not allowed to in later scenes for fear it would cause damage.  Also, they struggled a bit getting the wig worn by Heath Ledger just right, and Lasse points that out in some of the earlier filmed scenes where he does look a bit wild.  Making movies is not an easy task.  I love they way in the end, everyone gets what they want.  If only life could be that way!",1391385600,4,895,4.594936708860759

2516560,4,B000EDWKXI,"""Casanova""(2005) is directed by Lasse Hallstrom (The Cidar House Rules, Chocolat, What's Eating Gilbert Grape). Heath Ledger stars as Casanova in this fictional tale about a Casanova who falls in love with Francesca (Sienna Miller), who writes illegal feminist books under the alias Bernardo Gaudi, all the while the church is after Casanova for his crimes against sexual morality.  When the suitor from Genoa, Paprizzio (Oliver Platt), comes for Francesca things get complicated and the real fun begins as Casanova maneuvers the unwitting Paprizzio and others in an attempt to puts things into his favour with Francesca. Meanwhile the Venetian Inquisition, headed by Jeremy Irons, is closing in on the identity of Casanova, as the Casanova assumes a myriad of identities from the Genoan Paprizzio to the underground writer Bernardo Guardi.

2516567,3,B000EDWKXI,"At the dawn of an enlightened age the legend of Casanova
is somewhat twisted by this happy ending romantic comedy.
The period costumes are very good and the acting is well done,
but like all such romantic rewrites much of the plot seems
pretty hard to believe? For example, Casanova is rescued from the church
who is about to hang him by his mother the actress and her
friend the actor. The leading lady is a fem-lib writer
well before such texts saw the light of day, because
the church backed the family as headed by men
and women had nearly zero rights in an court.
The antics of Casanova with his womanizing madee him somewhat of a hero in his
time to many of male population.
I think that rewriting history for a romantic happy ending
is probably good for Hollywood and bad for history?",1261872000,,791,4.424657534246576
2516568,4,B000EDWKXI,"There are some reviewers who are disappointed that Shapespeare himself didn't write the script, or that Johnny Depp didn't play the lead role.  To them I say ""Be happy with what you get!""

This is a warm, amusing tale of a scandalous young man accustomed to using his rakish reputation to bed as many admiring young ladies as possible, and his efforts to thwart the authorities' attempts to control him.

It has the singular virtue that the viewer actually CARES about ALL the characters in the film, with witty dialogue, appropriately period music, and the stunning backdrop of Venice.  There are worthy performances by all involved, the comedic foils of  Oliver Platt and Jeremy Irons being outstanding.

Heath Ledger has a superficial resemblance to images of Casanova, and has an easygoing charm that is heartwarming.

The beauties he pursues are perhaps less engaging than the lively Sienna Miller, who plays his main love interest.

In real life Giacomo Casanova was an extraordinary man.  He was highly intelligent and managed to mix in the loftiest circles in Venice, and later Europe as a whole. He was handicapped by an aversion to boredom, and perhaps might have been classified ADD in the modern era.  He was later to say "" I have insufficient character for my intelligence, and insufficient intelligence for my character"".  He saw no inconsistency between his Catholic faith and his life long dedication to the pursuit of sensual pleasure.  His early career in the church enabled him to sidestep the moral censorship of the day, and he was always one step away from prison in his travels.  He travelled the length and breadth of Europe as an entrepreneur, spy, and diplomat, seeking adventure and romance wherever he went.

Many of the episodes in this film reflect actual events in Casanova's life, including a rooftop escape (from the Doge's prison, not a nunnery as in the film) and show an interest in science (he rode in a balloon later, and had a career as an alchemist), music (he was a professional violinist, and his conversations with Mozart resulted in ""Don Giovanni"") and international diplomacy (he was frequently employed as an agent by authorities in Venice and Rome).

While being a man of many parts (one in particular being well endowed and in regular use), he was also a man attractive to men for his persona, and to women for his attentive wooing.  He considered intelligence to be a woman's most lasting attribute, and in fact his one true love most delighted him by her conversation. Tragically, her death required him to continue the search.

After gaining and losing several fortunes (he introduced the lottery into France, and was an inveterate gambler), his retirement as a Librarian enabled him the leisure to record his autobiography. This, like Pepys' diary, gives us a fly on the wall look into his life and times.  Though voluminous, it gives only an overview of his amatory career, as he refrained from causing offence to the many patrons whose generosity had supported him in his prime.

All told, this film gives a small glimpse into the younger life of Giacomo Casanova, and most importantly, everything in the movie COULD have happened, and probably did!  Though the real man was no doubt more outrageous, the character portrayed by the late lamented Heath Ledger is much more to our liking.",1261785600,,3340,4.909252669039146

Like all the other reviewers I totally agree this was a wonderful movie. The sets, costumes, scenery ( the real and simulated Venice was stunning) were amazing. It's all wonderfully lush and full of colors. On Blueray, this movie will knock your socks off.  But what really shows that the film makers knew their stuff was the use of period music.  Not the typical Hans Zimmer 'helicopter chase scene' music ( regardless the subject of the film) but Vivaldi, Handel, Rameau, etc. THIS was the music of the time and the way in which the right piece was synch'd with the right scene shows that the director knew what he was doing. The entire effect is a visual and audio extravaganza  that makes you want to
a) hop a plane to Venice.
b) buy the soundtrack.
c) buy the movie.
d) watch it often.

2516576,5,B000EDWKXI,"This is a very good movie. Heath Ledger and Siena Miller are great as Cassanova and Francesca Bruni.

The story is an old Cassanova is writing his autobiography and is telling a story about a love that according to him is not his to tell.

Cassanova is already famous as a lover in Venice, Italy. He is caught with a novice nun (who according to Cassanova is hardly a novice.) THe Dogg is a friend of his and helps him out of his crapes. The Dogg was going to expell Cassanova from Venice, but then tells him to get married before Caravale a couple days later.

Cassanova and a person who works for him look for his future bride and found it in Victoria Donato. There is only one problem. Giovanni Bruni likes Victoria and is prepared to duell with Cassanova who gives his name as Lupo Salvato (the man who works for him.)

The next day Cassanova finds out that instead of dueling with Giovanni he spared with his sister Francesca. He is captivated by her and soon finds himself falling for her, but there are some compliocations.

One complication is that they are both engaged. Francesca is engaged to her fathers cousin Paprizzio (played by Oliver Platt). Also Cassanova thinks that she has a secret lover, but it turns out that she has been writing books and having a man named Bernardo Gurdi say that he wrote them.

Several days later Paprizzio comes to Venice and Cassanova meets him and ""helps"" him look better so that Cassanova can pretend that he is Paprizzio. Also Bishop Pucci comes to Venice to arrest Cassanova for being a ""vile fornacator."" Everything comes to a head at Caravale.

Why is it a story that is not the older Cassanova's to tell? What happens to Paprizzio, Cassanova, and Francesca? Watch Cassanova",1225584000,,1726,4.584415584415584

This time, he got caught.
 He will be hanged tomorrow. But wait! The Mayor of Venice is going to save his life, on grounds of mistaken identity.
You see, no one in the town of Venice really knows for sure who Casanova is, except for the ladies that are mums the word.  The town square even makes fun of this Casanova by staging of an outdoors play.
  The Mayor is expelling him from Venice. However, their is a reprieve.  casanova must find a respectable wife before Carnevale and must be on his best behavior until then.

2516582,4,B000EDWKXI,"This is an entertaining film, a light comedy of errors and mistaken identity, complimented by a talented cast, superb art direction and costume design.

The comical plot device of mistaken identity is ancient, showing up in the myths of the Greeks and Romans and Shakespeare's comedies. This film takes this strategy to the extremes with almost every leading character taking on the identity of other characters resulting in confusion and witty situational dialogue. Casanova takes on the identity of wealthy lard merchant Paprizzio so as to seduce Paprizzio's fianc Francesca. Francesca takes on the identity of a fictional male philosopher of women's rights. Francesca's clumsy, love-sick brother Giovanni takes on the identity of Casanova. As the film continues the intended lovers find new and more compatible lovers while the evil agents of the Catholic Church, such as Bishop Pucci, are confounded by all the switches and reversals of fortune and plot.

The cast is superb and Health Ledger does a good job of playing Casanova. However he is surrounded by exceptional actors, many of whom steal every scene in which they are placed. Sienna Miller plays Francesca, an early feminist who resists Casanova's attentions. Jeremy Irons shows his comic talents as he overplays the villainous Bishop Pucci. However there were four actors who were exceptional. Lena Olin plays Andrea Bruni, the beautiful widow plotting to have her daughter married to a wealthy man. Oliver Platt plays Paprizzio the wealthy lard merchant, and he steals every scene he is in with his delivery of lines and facial expressions and physical presence. Omid Djalili is superb as Casanova's put upon man servant Lupo, constantly trying to cover-up all the switched identities and double dealings. Charlie Cox is very good as the goofy, clumsy younger brother Giovanni who grows from love sick puppy to legendary lover.

The sets and art direction are exceptional. The re-creation of Venice was outstanding with exceptional attention to the grandeur and architectural details that permeate the city. Costume design was excellent and sumptuous. The sound track was also excellent - containing the light energetic 18th century works for which Venice is known and which perfectly match this comedy.

Overall this is an entertaining film of light comedy, containing enough plot twists to keep your attention, finely acted especially by some of the secondary characters, and beautiful to watch.",1208217600,,2462,5.305128205128205
2516583,4,B000EDWKXI,"With all the actors/actresses in this one.  It only adds a greater air of quality to this movie.  Casanova warrants a buy if only to see how Heath Ledger handles this role of a womanizing player.  Who can get any woman that he desires but he can't get the one that he actually loves played by Sienna Miller.  Who plays a researcher/writer with headstrong views on the place of women in the world at that time.  Also enjoyable is Oliver Platt who plays the man that she's signed and sealed to marry even though she's never met him.  Which is exactly where all the hilarity and fun ensue in this movie and without throwing too much out on this one.  Everyone has a thing or two going in this one and a certain someone from Heath's past will play a prominent role in this movie as well.

Even though he's passed on.  He plays the Casanova role with such energy, commitment and devotion.  I can't help but not being able to see him anymore new movies.  But as it stands for this one, its not only about his character but the vast array of people that bring the story of Casanova to life.

Well..here goes. I thought that CASANOVA was the best film of 2004 for lots of reasons. It is a sharp,snappy piece of elegance couched in a rollicking good time of a farce,sumptuous in look,articulate in wit,edited so tightly that there is no fat to cut,the best Alexandre Desplats soundtrack ever (SYRIANA), and acting from Heath Ledger,Sienna Miller,Oliver Platt and Jeremy Irons that has the absolute correct comical timing. Directed by Lasse Halstrom and filmed on location in Venice (the year is 1753),I loved it on the big screen and the DVD is outstanding for the proper ratio to keep this film at the look it had in the theatre and for myriads of interesting extras. It is rated R, but only for sexual entendre (lots of it,naturally), but shows no skin nor has any objectional language. You cannot beat the price as it sells on Amazon under $2.00.

But the cinematogaphy and the costumes are beautiful, so it is also a periord piece of the most charming kind.  There is sensuality and one extremely short but intense scene of the act of sex, this being Casanova, after all. And finally, the writing--The Writing--is superb.  It is-----so clever and full of things that you will probably miss the first few times you see it.  I say few times, because I have lost count--more than 10--of the times I have watched it, and even this morning, I am picking up a phrase here and there which matters in the story.  I must admit that Heath Ledger is delightful to observe, but his assistant, ""Lupo"" and his guest/protege, Paprizzio, are both hysterical.  In particular, the relationship between Lupo and Casanova, beginning with their first scence alone together, sets the comic tone.

2516599,4,B000EDWKXI,"The Australian actor Heath Ledger stars in this delightful nonsense, supposedly chronicling the exploits of a young Casanova in Venice during the eighteenth century. It's impossible to take seriously this costume farce, but it is great fun nonetheless. Outrageously, the movie ends up (spoiler included here) with Casanova settling down and discovering the joys of monogamy. A bonus: Jeremy Irons, who that same year played another period Venetian (Antonio) in The Merchant of Venice, here camps it up as an inquisitor who will stop at nothing until he captures Casanova (the constant mockery of the Catholic Church ends up being a little tiresome, though). Oliver Platt, playing a morbidly obese romantic rival of Casanova is very funny; less accomplished is Sienna Miller's performance as Casanova's love interest and a very improbable proto feminist. But the real star of the movie might be Venice itself, shown here as never before, a splendid feast to the eyes.

2516600,2,B000EDWKXI,"I always thought it would be a good idea to make a comedy about young Casanova - his incredible adventures, love stories, his struggle with church. Casanova was a fascinating historic figure, a soldier, spy, diplomat, writer, adventurer who will also be remembered as the greatest seducer and lover the world had ever seen (if only from his own words). His life and mystery surrounded him has made him an ultimate hero for many novels, plays, and movies. Sadly, not all Casanova's movies are good and Lasse Hallstrm's comedy belongs to the long list of not successful movies. Sure, it is gorgeous to look at - it is 18th Century Venice after all, and locations, photography, Vivaldi's music, costumes, wigs, make up are first class but beyond all this is just another typical chick flick or romcom with Heath Ledger whose Casanova is not that brilliant and fascinating figure but just a cute guy - no more, no less.

Heath Ledger does a surprisingly wonderful job of portraying the legendary seducer of women.  In many ways, the whole concept of Casanova is like an inflated male fantasy.  It asks:  ""What if?"" it were the case that women were to chase after us like we chase after them?  Insofar as that is concerned, the film is quite cathartic.

One of the biggest selling points of the movie is that it maintains a great sense of humor.  It's good to see how they were able to make a lighthearted film out of what was a rather dark chapter in world history.

2516606,3,B000EDWKXI,"Tonight, after reading serious books, and realizing that I needed something frothy, in went this film to the dvd player. And a story about history's most notorious lover and some of his escapades sounded like pretty harmless fun.

The film opens with a little boy watching as his mother (Helen McCrory) leaves him with his grandmother to join a lover in Venice. Tearfully, she promises him that when he needs her, she will join him.

Now we leap forward, to where the little boy has grown up into Giacomo Casanova (Heath Ledger), a fashionable young man without too much money, and who makes a habit of leaping out of bedroom windows. He's also in trouble with the Inquisition for his debauchery, and it's appearing that he's going a bit too far even for his friend, the Doge (Tim McInnerny), the leader of the city. The Doge, who actually likes our seducer, tells him that the best way to evade the Inquisition is to marry some modest young virgin and settle down a bit.

Casanova's servant, Lupo (Omad Djalili) also agrees -- the debts are mounting up, and the creditors hammering at the door. Considering a bit, Casanova settles on courting a very virginal, angelic little blonde, Victoria  (Natalie Dormer), and it doesn't hurt either that her father is going to settle a nice, fat dowry on her.

But across the canal, is Giovanni Bruni (Charlie Cox), gazing continually at his heart's desire, Victoria. He's a rather inept, graceless young man, too shy to speak up for her. Besides, his family is penniless, as his mother Andrea (Lena Olin) reminds him continually, and the way out is for the daughter of the house, Francesca (Sienna Miller). Casanova has seen her before, as she's a lively one, eager to reform the lot of Venetian women, but she's also being forced to marry a merchant from Padua.

Casanova just can't be sensible and resist Francesca, who is eager to spurn him, and soon he's in a complicated courtship of both Victoria and Francesca, and it appears that everything is going well, that is until Rome sends a powerful bishop Pucci (Jeremy Irons), and the real betrothed, Paprizzio (Oliver Platt) shows up.

Casanova duels, debates, woos, and generally leaves mayhem in his wake. Will the right girl end up with the right guy, and Casanova escape the hangman's noose? Sadly for the viewer, we already know how things are going to turn out. There are last minute escapes, bawdy content that is more of a tease than anything else, and by the end I was happy to have the film be finished and over.

But there are several small things that kept this film going. For one, the music is from the period, with plenty of Vivaldi, Handel and Corelli, and the more modern stuff written by Alexandre Desplat. The costumes are perfect, and correct for the 1750's, and downright breathtaking at times, along with authentic Venetian masks. But the best part of this film was that it was filmed on location in Venice, something that can't be recreated on a soundstage or in CGI. That's the real star of this film, and the only successful part of the movie.

Along with the charming piglets (credited as Bimba!) and Paprizzio's barge.

It's a very confusing film at times. Lasse Hallstrom's direction is fine, and pretty straightforward, with plenty of gorgeous scenery. But the plot is so confusing and there are so many players to keep track of that there's not really anything that gives any depth. Along with all that, the film falls completely apart at the end, with far too much use of deus ex machina and some truly stupid stunts -- one in particular make me wince, as anyone who actually tried to do that would be singing soprano for the rest of their days. Finally, there is one very glaring anachronism in this, with the balloon rising over the canals of Venice and modern fireworks. The first manned balloon flight wouldn't take place for another twenty or so years, and that at Versailles at the court of Louis XVI.

So if you don't mind a film that comes down heavy on the silly side, but is gorgeous to look at, this should amuse for an hour or so. In fact, I was more intrigued by the additional features on the dvd -- there are featurettes on the locations, costume design, an extended scene that should have been included in the film and not on the cutting room floor, a 'making of', and an audio commentary from the director. Additional languages include Spanish and French alternate audio tracks, subtitling in English, Spanish and French.

Curiously, this film got an R rating for the sexual content, where you actually don't see anything happening, just a prostitute acting coy, several naked legs in a brothel, and one very brief bit at the begining with Casanova in bed with a lover. You'd see more in most PG-13 films nowadays, so parents, use your own judgements.

Somewhat recommended, say three and a half stars. Let's just call it three and leave it at that.",1166227200,12,4891,4.686480186480186
2516607,4,B000EDWKXI,"Casanova is a great movie! I have noticed  they have made a lot of movies putting real life characters in fictional stories. Sometimes I think the movie played on the fact that in reality Casanova really WAS all the things Franchesca thought he was! Which to me makes if funnier! Even though the movie was fictionious, I would be willing to bet that there were true events in it. One more thing: While I believe Casanova really did love Franchesca, I would not be surpriesed if he could NOT be faithful to her. It never appeared that he actually PROMISED to be faithful to her. No matter what the reason was for him bedding a bunch of women, I still would never believe a womanizer could be faithful to one woman. Not to say that they could not have one true love though. I would be willing to bet that even Franchsca will wonder if he could be faithful to her. To me that will always be the unspoken question. I could actually picture Casanova promising to be faithful to Franchesca, and her telling him not to make a promise he knew could not keep. As I said though, great movie! Those are just somethings about the movie that could really make me double over in laughter!

2516608,5,B000EDWKXI,"I rented this film expecting from the reviews that it would be mildly diverting. In the event I found it laugh-out-loud funny: indeed I havn't laughed so much while watching a film for months if not years. And most of the time I was laughing with the film, not at it.

In more than one way this film was surprisingly similar to a film on the same subject which Bob Hope had made more than fifty years previously (Casanova's Big Night, 1954). In both cases the film is built around the same central joke, that Casanova's mere reputation as a great lover is enough to have every woman in Venice throw herself at him, including those who appear to be extremely respectable and virtuous, with precisely one exception - the woman he wants.

The quality of the acting, from the big names down to the complete unknowns, was superlative throughout - Heath Ledger in the title role and Jeremy Irons as Bishop Pucci, the inquisitor who is trying to hang Casanova, were particularly good.

The music, scenery and costumes were also fantastically beautiful. Venice is one of the most beautiful cities in the world, and the production team made full use of this, both in the scenes which were shot on location and in the backdrops. The latter included some beautiful buildings which we can appreciate today only in the paintings of Canaletto and his contemporaries, but which have since fallen down or been demolished. Some of the scenes which were shot on location in Venice had to have the dialogue re-recorded in a studio and added back in, as the background noise was too loud and modern - the production team did a brilliant job of this.

The set up research for the background scenes appears to have been very thorough indeed. During the opening sequence Casanova's mother (Helen McRory) leaves Venice while he is still a boy. A panoramic view of Venice is seen behind her barge: the most prominent building in this view, the Campanile of the church of S. Maria della Carita, actually fell down in 1744, twelve years before the main action of the film, but it would indeed have been standing in Casanova's boyhood. I didn't spot it again in the backgrounds showing Venice in 1756, which suggests someone did some very careful work on what would and would not have been seen at particular times.

The musical soundtrack is wonderful, and all of the Baroque style of the period. Of course there is a lot of Vivaldi's music used, but there is also excellent music from many other 18th century composers including George Frederic Handel, Tomaso Albinoni, Corelli, and Teleman. The music track is almost worth buying the film for on it's own, though it is also available as a CD from Hollywood records, and if I don't decide to buy the film I will probably buy the music CD.

The plot is essentially a romantic farce which does not attempt to take itself too seriously. At several stages of the story Casanova appears to be in grave danger of being executed, but the viewer can assume that he will somehow escape, because the film opens with a very elderly Casanova finishing his memoirs. We hear the voice of the aged rake referring to the ten thousand women with whom he had affairs, and then reminiscing about the one love affair, back in 1756, which he has left out - the love affair of Casanova and Francesca.

Each of the characters bring their own brand of humour to the film, but the film seldom goes for more than a few moments without something to make you laugh. After Casanova escape from a nun's bedroom one step ahead of the Inquisition, the head inquisitor Dalfonso, (played by Ken Stott) scowls at the nun and exclaims ""An eternity of damnation for one night with Casanova!"" As soon as he has left the room she pulls a wry smile and says ""Seems fair!""

Jeremy Irons as the far more dangerous Bishop Pucci who soon replaces Dalfonso, uses brilliantly dry understatement to underline the menace of his threatening statements, interspersed with throw-away lines. To make some of these work required equally brilliant support from Pucci's assistant Andolini, played by Ben Moor, who has to alternate from one moment to the next between playing Adolf Eichmann to Pucci's Reinhard Heydrich, and acting as Jeremy Irons' straight man.

Heath Ledger plays Casanova as a sophisticated English public school rascal, wonderfully supported by Omid Djalili as Casanova's servant and companion Lupo. I would suggest that Lupo is Jeeves to Casanova's Bertie Wooster except that Casanova, unlike Bertie, is the brains of the outfit. But the farcical scrapes they get up to are very P.G. Woodhouse.

Tim McInnery plays the Doge (ruler) of Venice so well that he finally banishes the ghost of Percy from Blackadder. I was unable to take McInnery seriously in some of his other recent roles because I kept thinking of his role as Edmund Blackadder's second hapless sidekick. However, this time, despite wearing a historically accurate costume which is as silly as anything he had to wear for the former roles, McInnery manages to summon enough gravitas to be plausible as the Doge. The Doge is Casanova's friend, but warns him that he will have to marry a respectable woman or leave Venice.

The apparently respectable virgin who Casanova decides to marry is Victoria Donato, played by Natalie Dormer. Her father is initially horrified when the notorious rake Casanova asks for the hand of his virtuous virgin daughter, and is about to refuse. However, as soon as she hears that Casanova has asked to marry her, Victoria throws respectability to the four winds and demands that her father accept the proposal. Natalie Dormer is a little under-used in this story, and her character is played strictly for laughs. But if she can reproduce in a wider range of contexts the performance she gives in this film, changing in a moment from the aspect of an innocent virgin to that of a woman who is positively smouldering with overwhelming desire, she is guaranteed a successful career om Hollywood.

Unfortunately, Casanova has no sooner agreed his engagement to Victoria when fate throws the proto-feminist Francesca Bruni, played by Sienna Miller, in his path - and the fact that she despises him seems to make her irresistible to him. Most male viewers will wonder why Casanova would make such an effort to win the heart of a woman who loathes him, even if she's as beautiful as Sienna Miller, when he's about to marry a firecracker like Natalie Dormer's Victoria, but it's all part of the film's central joke.

There are too many other excellent performances in the film to list them all, but they include those of Lena Olin as Francesca's beautiful widowed mother, Charlie Cox as her brother, and Olver Platt as her fiancee, the wealthy lard merchant Paprizio.

Negatives - it's obviously not a very serious film. Apart from the costumes, sets, and music it bears very little resemblance to historical reality. Some viewers with a more sophisticated sense of humour will find this too farcical. Others who were hoping for something more risque might be disappointed by the fact that this film is surprisingly innocent and has very little nudity.

However, overall I would have to rate this as one of the funniest films I have ever seen and very entertaining indeed.",1163721600,6,7247,4.800320769847635

2516611,4,B000EDWKXI,"This movie is simply rich and sumptuous to look at.  To these days, I can never comprehend why movies of substance are always spoken in English theatre accent particularly when this particular movie is set in Venice.  That aside, Heath Ledger seems to be enjoying himself playing the title role after Brokeback Mountain, and what contrasting movies they are.  Sienna Miller is simply brilliant as the head-strong, independent feminist whose character despises and abhors towards the reputation of Casanova but who in the end, would succumb to his sincerity and charm, and the one woman who would tie Casanova down to a monogamous relationships.  Oliver Platt is hillarious as the fiance of Siena's character but who in the end would fall in love with her mother instead; need we say anymore about Jeremy Irons and Lena Olin who are also tremendous in their portrayal of the Vaticans authority that is to bring Casanova to ""justice"" and Sienna's character's mother who wish for her daughter's marriage to the prince of Genoa to offset the family's mounting debt; and then, there are also Casanova's loyal sidekick, Sienna's character's younger brother who is infatuated with his neighbour's daughter and who, on the other hand is totally obsessed with Casanova.  The whole cat and mouse chase and of Casanova needing to be ahead of everyone else before he gets caught is what made this movie so pleasurable and funny to watch.

2516612,5,B000EDWKXI,"Set all in Venice, this movie is beautiful.  Many

scene shots that have probably not been used before.

As I do not know Venice well, I cannot appreciate the

beauty in this movie fully, or know which scenes were

for props rather than the actual Venetian environment.

 Many antique buildings with beautiful art inside, at

least one ancient room which was never filmed in

before.  St. Mark's Square I think it was, was used in

this.  And of course some bridges, gondolas, and

water, the veins of Venice.

Shots for Casanova were very difficult as to transport

equipment would naturally be cumbersome as everything

required a gondola or bridges to get around pretty

much.

There was much use of green screens for scenes which

were hard to light, especially if there was water

nearby.  Some things were digitally added for the

movie, but they did not overdo it.  The air balloon

with strings was digital, the colorful sail that opens

when a ship sails out is put in that way, and when

Casanova is running away from some guards near the

beginning, some enhancements are edited in as well.

Ledger, unsurprisingly, has some great improv skills,

though his choice to insist on wearing glasses in one

scene was bad as it really did not fit in with the

times at all or help fortify the movie's story at all.

The pig in the story was hard to manage as they could

not get a well trained pig for the movie.  Some movie

pieces were cut or modified because of the pig's

performance.  It would've been interesting to know on

the DVD which parts of the movie were cut because of

the pig.

Natalie Dormer's character, Victoria, has a great

curious look on her face when she hides behind a bird

cage and accidentally bumps the cage revealing her

hiding place.

Charlie Cox, who plays Giovanni Bruni, probably has

one of the best performances for this movie.  As ""the

boy who looks out the window"" he appears to not know

what is going to happen for sure when a sexy woman

approaches his sight from below winking subtly at him

to come to ""her"" place.

This movie ends up being barely rated R because of its

few sexual scenes, but they are so pertinent to the

movie that to take them out would be a sin unless you

wanted to release a PG-13 version with an R version.

Definitely a movie worth a watch and not ""just a

counter action to BBM by Ledger.""",1156896000,,2368,4.468085106382978

2516614,3,B000EDWKXI,"In this fast-paced historical spoof, Heath Ledger takes the part of Casanova, a man infamous for his womanizing ways. It seems no woman in Venice can resist him. But eventually his luck runs out and Casanova finds himself with a choice: either he must find himself a respectable wife by the time Carnivale rolls around, or he will be exiled from the city. He quickly arranges a betrothal to a girl well-known as the most virginal of virgins, and then promptly falls in love with another woman - the only woman, it seems, who simply won't have him. Francesca (Sienna Miller) is a woman ahead of her time, writing feminist literature under a male nom de plume, and she detests everything Casanova stands for. However, under a false name, Casanova does mange to woo Fancesca, only to have everything fall once more into disarray when her own betrothed - a corpulent lard merchant whom she has never met (Oliver Platt) - shows up to claim his bride.

The biggest mistake one can make is to take this movie too seriously. It is a mindless spoof and nothing more, and going into it with expectations of a period drama will only leave the viewer disappointed. Unfortunately, I found myself somewhat disappointed anyway. Even knowing that the film is intended as a comedy, I could not find the sequence of events even remotely plausible. Many of the plot twists are just too off-the-wall to wrap one's head around, despite efforts to suspend disbelief.

And worse, none of the characters seemed to display any real chemistry with one another. No reason - not even a ridiculous one - is given for why Casanova falls for Francesca instead of any of the many, many women he could easily have had. And there is little more reason for Francesca's eventually reciprocating the sentiment, and it is especially hard to fathom her almost immediate forgiveness once she discovers Casanova's true identity. He has seduced almost every woman in Venice, and now she finds that he has been courting HER under a false name, yet, with almost no deliberation, decides that she loves and trusts him anyway and that he is worth dying for. I just couldn't buy it. Even less could I buy the ""love at first sight"" scenario between Francesca's mother and the man Francesca's is supposed to be betrothed to. If only the characters had displayed genuine chemistry, all the far-fetched plot twists could have been more easily overlooked in favor of the human element of the story. But they did not, and I found it difficult to truly care for any of them. Though I am a fan of Heath Ledger, I found this to be one of his more disappointing films.

The plot, as others have described, is fairly straightforward. Casanova, who seems downright harrowed by all his responsibilities re: satisfying women (in one of the opening scenes an entire convent is bidding him good-bye) gets a reprieve in the request that he marry, which will restore his reputation and help him avoid the Inquisition.

He finds a young woman who exhibits a great deal of interest in getting into his pants, when, unexpectedly, he falls in love with another, who resists. Unfortunately, I saw no spark/sexual/emotional tension between Casanova and Francesca, an eightteenth-century proto-feminist who believes that for a man to gain the love of a woman all he has to say is ""what are your thoughts on the matter"" (this I quite liked :)

Francesca is betrothed to a rich man, whom she has never met, and some intrigue ensues as Casanova tries to win her attention. In the end, everything is sorted out, everybody finds his/her mate (odd in itself) and our feminist promptly stops writing his treatises about women on the side of her ""true love.""

2516619,4,B000EDWKXI,"If you are interested in the lreal ife of Casanova, and want to know something about him, this film is not the place for you. `Casanova' directed by Lasse Hallstrm (`The Cider House Rules' `Chocolat') disregards any historical accuracy in turning the life of libertine into an almost farce-like romantic comedy, which is full of -- at least four, as I remember -- mistaken identities. Take it for what it is, and you will find it quite entertaining with beautiful costumes and locations.

The film begins and ends with a series of routine tricks - voiceover by an aged man writing something, recollecting his younger days; the image starts to wobble; cue to the glorious days of Venice, the richest city in Europe. And Casanova making love in a nunnery. Lasse Hallstrm tackles these familiar setups in a bold manner, doing them as straightforward as possible, as if to shake off the dismal air of his previous films like `The Shipping News.' The scenes are not original, but still fun thanks to the good acting from the cast.

Heath Ledger is perfectly cast as Casanova, who finds his `true love' in a feisty woman with a progressive idea named Francesca (Siena Miller), right after he has got engaged to another girl Victoria (Natalie Dormer). And Francesca, who has engaged a Genoese merchant Paprizzo (Oliver Platt), also seems to keep clandestine meeting with someone else. Add to them Lena Olin as Francesca's mother and Jeremy Irons as Pucci from the Catholic Church, who is so eager to catch and hang Casanova, and the already complicated story gets more complicated to create some funny set-pieces about the mistaken identities.

In spite of the film's title, it is Oliver Platt and Jeremy Irons who are most attractive in the entire cast. Both play the characters who are constantly duped by Casanova, but that makes them all the more engaging. Heath Ledger's Casanova is OK. As a womanizer his portrayal looks rather tamed, but still good enough. Siena Miller's Francesca is the most disappointing for I finally couldn't find why Casanova has to be attracted to her. One courtroom scene that (intentionally, I guess) reminds us of one Shakespearian drama is weak and ineffective, and I also do not see why the film should have ended like this with two Casanovas.

`Casanova' is a light-hearted romance with gorgeous costumes and production designs. Actually, the film's comfortable feelings come mostly from the city of Venice and the delightful photography that captures it. You cannot say the film does justice to the real Casanova who, some say, is a much more complex person. I don't know about that; maybe I should read books. But as far as the film's content is concerned, it is amusing enough.",1153180800,,2710,4.8847826086956525
2516620,4,B000EDWKXI,"I really enjoyed this roantic comedy. Although this is a fictional film, the actors, costumes, and beautiful views of Venice makes this movie very entertaining to watch. Despite being a womanizer, you can't help but to love Giacamo Casanova!",1152576000,,241,5.205128205128205
2516621,4,B000EDWKXI,"If you're old enough to have seen the ""Carry On"" movies the first time around, or have watched them on DVD on ""oldies night"", (don't worry, we're not going to ask your age) you'll see the resemblance to this funny take on the world's greatest lover.  Slapstick, double entendres and misunderstandings abound, as Heath Ledger tries to fill the trousers of the legendary lothario without getting a broken back in the process.

It takes place in 1753 in Venice, a time when no woman is safe from the charms of Casanova, not even those confined to the convent.  Luckily for him he has friends in the right places and escapes being strung up for debauchery (a big word which in the movie means that he shakes a lot of bedsprings without the benefit of a marriage license)

After going one conquest too far, his friend the Doge insists that Casanova get married ASAP, or face exile from Venice.  Exile is not a possibility, as we learn early in the movie that he has a very good reason for sticking around, so marriage it is, and the lady to whom he pledges his troth is not only a virgin, but extremely willing to be wed.  In a classic case of bad timing, he then meets the one woman worthy of his affection, and she turns out to be a cross-dressing (but only when necessary to prove a point) feminist writer who hates every bone in his body.  She unfortunately is betrothed to a corpulent but very wealthy lard merchant (Oliver Platt) whom she has never set eyes on before, the union having being arranged by her late father as an insurance policy for the family fortune.

If you're still with me after all that, things get even more complicated when Jeremy Irons shows up as Inquisitor Pucci, out for the bewigged head of Casanova as a gift for the hangman's noose.

The important thing is not to attempt to take this movie seriously as a period piece, or as a factual account of the life of Casanova.  It is a historically set spoof of the life and especially the times of Casanova and should be taken with a pinch of salt - or was that lard?

2516622,5,B000EDWKXI,"Some viewers may not rate Casanova as highly as Lasse Hallstrom's 1987 masterpiece, My Life as a Dog, or his 2002 rendition of Annie Proulx' novel, The Shipping News. But I thoroughly enjoyed this comic adventure, set in 18th century Venice, and scored almost completely with period works by composers Antonio Vivaldi, Roman, Tomaso Albinoni, and Jean-Philippe Rameau.

The story is a fast-paced adventure of mistaken identities, and quickly engrosses the viewer. The story begins as the aged Casanova breaks off writing his memoirs to tell the story of one Francesca, a story, he says, that is not really his own. Then we are transported back to Casanova's childhood, as his mother sends him to live with his grandmother in Venice, promising to come back for him someday. We next find Giacamo Casanova (Heath Ledger) making love to a novice at a Venice convent, when a fellow nun knocks loudly at the door to warn him that the Inquisition officers are searching the convent for him.

After a chase over tiled Venetian rooftops and jumping over canals, Casanova is taken into custody, where the Doge (Tim McInnerny) warns him that unless he marries an upstanding woman by Carnival, within three days, he will be exiled from his beloved Venice, or worse. Thus Casanova, aided by his loyal page Lupo (Omid Djalili), begins his hurried courtship of the virginal beauty Victoria ( Natalie Dormer), who unbeknownst to her, has been secretly beloved for years by Giovanni Bruni (Charlie Cox), who has been admiring her through his window across the canal from her father's pillazo.

Challenged to a duel by the overeager young Bruni, Casanova finds himself the next morning facing an adept masked swordsman whom he shortly discovers to be Giovanni's sister Francesca (Sienna Miller). Casanova soon realizes he has made a terrible mistake; in fact he loves Francesca, whom he had seen earlier, while fleeing the Inquisition. He now begins to woo Francesca, first disguised as a wealthy gentleman merchant, Senior Salvatore and later, by assuming the identity of her promised husband, the wealthy Genoan lard merchant, Paprizzio (Oliver Platt), whom she has never seen.

Francesca and her mother Andrea (Lena Olin) accept Casanova's faked second identity until Inquisitor Pucci (Jeremy Irons) arrives on the scene and concludes that all is not as it seems. Francesca even seems to be falling in love with him.

The confusion that then ensues is sheer delight.

As a fictional film, a romantic comedy, this film succeeds beautifully. If you like period films, and enjoy romantic comedy, this film is a great piece of entertainment.

2516623,2,B000EDWKXI,"Giacamo Casanova is on the run from the Inquisition for the crimes of heresy, debauchery, fornication with a novice, and numerous others that have all been rescinded in the past.  His luck is running out on him, though, and he has been warned that he must find himself a respectable wife or face the consequences and be exiled from Venice.  This is not necessarily the easiest task for a known libertine, notorious rogue, and despoiler of virgins.

That is until he has a vision of the lovely Victoria, a rarity of sorts: a Venetian virgin.  While Victoria's father would prefer that she not fall for the licentious Casanova, his daughter overwhelms him with her requests to wed him.  And so, they are engaged.  All is well until Casanova sees Francesca Bruni, a feminist in her time, defending the rights of women to attend university and be something more than a man's plaything.  He admires her courage and wit and begins to court her--regardless of his pending wedding.

I'm taking this movie as a work of fiction and nothing more, so I'll make no comments about the historical accuracy.  The Venice sets are beautiful and the costumes are lovely if a bit inconsistent.  My favorite part of the movie is Lena Olin in the role of Francesca's mother and Oliver Platt as Francesca's errant fiance, Paprizzio, lard king of Genoa.  As a whole the film was fun to watch, with numerous comic sequences, but I couldn't help but wish the plot was a little more consistent.  It seemed to jump all over the place and there were just too many cases of mistaken identity for me to take it seriously.

One reviewer said that the script had some help from Tom Stoppard, but I don't believe it for one minute. And the cinematography is so bad that it makes the real Venice look like a cardboard set.

2516629,3,B000EDWKXI,"For a film that impeccably recreates 18th century Venice with such dazzling exteriors, sumptuous costumes and beautiful Baroque music, it seems a shame that the story at the center is just a frothy, mechanical series of mistaken identity situations and contemporary-pitched comedy (I groaned when one character actually says during a chase scene in a carriage, ""This is the last time I travel coach!""). After the lethargic family tensions of ""An Unfinished Life"", director Lasse Halstrom chooses to lighten up considerably with this fanciful account of the legendary lover, Giacomo Casanova. It seems that he is going for a ""Shakespeare in Love"" vibe but misses the depth of that film.

For a while, the farcical elements are entertaining, but as the 2005 film goes along, it refuses to congeal into anything that takes advantage of its historical period or sheds any light into the title character beyond the formulaic romance. While he has the looks and wit to carry off the role, Heath Ledger is the most interior of actors and fundamentally cannot emit the joie de vivre that Casanova must have, something a more magnetic swashbuckler like Errol Flynn had in spades. A similar problem exists with Sienna Miller, who has the Katharine Hepburn role of a proto-feminist writing about women's rights under a male pseudonym. She is certainly pretty and intelligent enough but somehow does not register memorably as Francesca. Luckily, there are some fun sideline performances with Oliver Platt as the pasty-faced lard magnate Paprizzio, Lena Olin as Francesca's socially ambitious mother and Jeremy Irons especially over-the-top as the dastardly bishop Pucci.

The actors, however, cannot escape the galloping momentum Hallstrom generates to produce the central halcyon of comedy shenanigans because screenwriters Jeffrey Hatcher and Kimberly Simi do not seem as interested in developing full characters. Regardless, there are some lovely scenes just to take in, even the obviously green-screened hot-air balloon ride amid fireworks over the Venice. Special credit especially needs to go to Alexandre Desplat's music score which mixes original compositions with Baroque masterworks from Vivaldi, Rameau, Albinoni and of course, Handel. The 2006 DVD contains a standard package of extras - an informative commentary track by Hallstrom, a brief making-of featurette, even briefer shorts on the costumes and Venice and an extended deleted sequence which goes into more specifics about the burgeoning love between Casanova and Francesca.",1148256000,,2532,5.440203562340967
2516630,4,B000EDWKXI,"Legendary lover, Casanova (Heath Ledger), is the amore' of many beautiful Venetian woman.  His predilection is to deflower innocent women, and his favorite market is the local nunnery.  He can be considered a popular or a notorious lover, depending on whom you ask.  Nevertheless, his escapades only get him into deep trouble with the local chapter of the Inquisition.  (Back then sins were crimes and could be negotiated at a high price.)  In all fairness the local bishop is kind and merciful, a safe haven for the frolicking young lethario.  But, the bishop's resourcefulness has limits, and it is at one point that he makes an ultimatum:  Casanova must avoid further trouble, marry someone, and stay chaste until his wedding day.  Predictably, it is then that he finds the love of his life, Francesca (Sienna Miller), but finds his interest unrequited.  (One of the great aspects of the movie is her mature philosophy about love.  She so articulately presents the difference between love and lust in all its forms and expressions.)  Ironically, just when he keeps his nose the cleanest, Casanova gets into the most trouble.  He takes several identities to allude the grasp of the Inquisition and weaves the greatest deceptions to woo the interest of Francesca, while staying out of the tangles of many courtship connections.  Casanova easily evades the grasp of the Inquisition until the head is replaced by the highly motivated Cardinal Pucci (Jeremy Irons).  Then, it starts to get tricky.

This movie is thoroughly pleasant and fun-filled.  The lines are often witty, the characters are enjoyable, and the costumes and scenery are eye-catching.  There is a formula at work, though:  The movie contains dueling and wooing, as well as several chase scenes.  However, the movie's execution is notably smooth and skillful.  The handling of the story is often original and not always predictable.  It must also be said the classical music (Vivaldi, et al) makes the mood magnificent, even more so than most movies.  Similar pictures are often tiresome, but this one is easy to follow.  The viewer can see this movie without having to concentrate too much on the plot.

2516632,4,B000EDWKXI,"Heath Ledger travels far away from Brokeback Mountain all the way to 18th century Venice, Italy to shoot a movie about a scandalous, womanizing writer named Giacomo Casanova.

Casanova's life is full of female conquests and pursuits of pleasures of the flesh. Subsequently, he pens stories of all the experiences he's accumulated, which apparently do not paint a pretty picture of the female species. Just down the canal lives the beautiful and intelligent Francesca Bruni, a young woman who challenges the archaic values that the Church and society hold against women. She does this by infiltrating university meetings held exclusively by men, and by writing seditious pamphlets touting the freedom and equal rights women should be bestowed. Of course, she writes beneath the guise of a nom de plume: ""Bernardo Guardi.""

Casanova's free-loving life takes a turn for the worse after he sleeps with a nun who also happens to be the cardinal's little sister. As punishment, the doge of Venice tells him to marry a respectable woman from a good family or else risk permanent expulsion from Venice. A series of events leads Casanova to meet the free-spirited Francesca Bruni, and he finds himself falling in love with her. Unlike the other women of Venice, Francesca turns out to be a conquest much more difficult to attain. The movie takes off with a flourish when Casanova's desires leads him into a brilliant tangle of clever lies and intrigue.

The film starts out a little slow, but once we get one third of the way in, it becomes exciting. The movie is clever, funny, and surprisingly adorable. Even Sienna Miller, whom I normally despise, is very likeable as Francesca. How can I hate a woman whose passion is writing?

The one thing that gets me, and it's hard to admit because I liked the movie, is that the ending is a little weak. Other than that, it's an easy, enjoyable film.",1147564800,,1884,4.859813084112149
2516633,4,B000EDWKXI,"Let's get one thing clear right off the bat: I really, really, really enjoy Lasse Hallstrom's films. The Cider House Rules, The Shipping News (one of my all time favorites), Chocolat, and What's Eating Gilbert Grape are a few that stand out. So I went into this movie expecting the typical Lasse-style film ...and I wasn't disappointed.

For those looking for a historically accurate recounting of Casanova's life, you best look elsewhere; this movie only touches on a few aspects of the great lover. Here we get a fun, raucous comedy with cinematic character (all filmed on location in Venice) along with sumptuous sets and startling costumes.

Heath Ledger (Brokeback Mountain, 2005) plays the starring role and does so with a wit and charm reserved for such a part. Indeed, I'm becoming more and more impressed with Mr. Ledger. His ability to play a confused gay cowboy in one film, then a slight historical figure in the next speaks well for his future acting career.

The story...

Casanova's life is in jeopardy. The Prince of Venice has been covering for Casanova's immoral behavior (fornicating and adulterating) but the Catholic Church has had enough. Inquisitor Pucci (played perfectly by the baritone-voiced Jeremy Irons) has come to Venice to hang the famed lover of women. But confusion reigns as Casanova misdirects the Inquisitor by taking on the (phony) mantle of Paprizzio, a famed pork lard salesman. Oliver Platt (again, perfectly cast) nearly steals the show as the real - and rotund -Paprizzio who comes to Venice to marry the beautiful Francesca Bruni (Sienna Miller). Casanova falls in love with Francesca while Paprizzio falls for another. But Casanova is promised to another ""virgin"" whom he must marry in order to save his neck. Can he go against his womanizing behavior and get married? Is his affection for Francesca just another set of desires? Or could it be true love?

Against all of this slapstick behavior is the beautiful backdrop of Venice. Its amazing streets, waterways, ancient buildings with staggeringly beautiful edifices, and, of course, the usual Lasse Hallstrom direction of all of it; this is what Mr. Hallstrom loves more than anything else: letting the settings become a character themselves.

This isn't to say the movie is perfect. It isn't. The script, although holding its own charm, was fairly shallow and predictable. For instance, when Paprizzio is rebuffed by Francesca, his future wife, everyone knows that Paprizzio will find another mate close by.

But even so, the film is packed full of great dialogue, great sets, even better costumes, and some wonderful actors (How could you possibly dislike a film with Oliver Platt, Jeremy Irons, Lena Olin, and Heath Ledger in it?) History buffs should avoid the film like the plague, but if you like slight comedies and, in particular, have enjoyed the Lasse Hallstrom films listed above, you'll delight in this flick.

a good bet for a pleasant afternoon.  True, it is not a realistic picture of Casanova, nor does it explore the social or personal dynamics of such a notorious womanizer.  Basically, it's good clean and abundant humor in the glorious setting of Venice.  Indeed, some the visuals are truly spectacular.  Casanova is getting into trouble with women, as usual, then he finds someone he truly cares for...and she thinks him a rake.  So he has to disguise himself as her bethrothed rich fiance whom she has never seen.  (The real fiance is an overweight merchant who sells the best lard in Europe).

The movie pokes some pleasant fun at intolerance, particularly by the Church. Jeremy Irons is well cast as the inquisitor who informs us that heresy is anything that he says it is. Given the choice, I really thought this picture was much better than ""Shakespeare in Love"" ...although it clearly is not in the same class as ""Dangerous Beauty.""

2516645,4,B000EDWKXI,"As we all know, Heath Ledger has been in many, many bad movies.  Will he ever live down The Order?  I don't think so--not with me, anyway.  So I was a little worried about this movie because, even though it looked exactly like the sort of thing I would like, Heath Ledger was in it.  BUT--so was Oliver Platt (is he making a living out of being in every movie about Venice or what?).  So I decided to give it a try.

Basically, this movie is GREAT!  It's a romp--a romp, I tell you!!!  Ledger is actually really good and believable (never thought I'd say that) as Giacomo Casanova, the guy who wouldn't be able to avoid getting into trouble if he tried, which he actually does for about five minutes.  The screenplay is very well-written and near-flawlessly plotted, and leans more toward slapstick who's-on-first type comedy than romance, which is good because it works.  There's also a twist at the end of the movie that I never saw coming.  Everyone loves a twist.

This movie also gets props from me for the scenery.  I love watching a movie and being like, ""Oh, I've been there!""

The movie does its down sides:  the ending doesn't really make sense (how did Victoria learn how to duel???), but did you really expect it to?  Also, I find it hard to believe no one's pissed at Casanova--but oh well!

There are so many great characters in this movie that it's difficult to pick just one that I totally loved, but at this point I'm going to vote for Victoria, the lustful virgin.  Hilaaaaaarious.  Of course, Oliver Platt was also great as the rotund, slightly dense, yet lovable lard merchant.  And Jeremy Irons (you didn't think this movie would be without Jeremy Irons in it, did you?) plays the 18th-century version of Pat Robertson.  Ha ha.

The only downer in this movie is Casanova's real life.  I kept waiting for him to be imprisoned in the Doge's Palace and for his true love to die of consumption while he's there.  Poor guy.  But if I hadn't known about his real-life adventures, I never would have expected the ax to drop, so to speak.

Overall, this is a really great movie.  If you like movies like St. Ives or The Scarlet Pimpernell, you will definitely enjoy this one.",1146528000,6,2188,4.5012722646310435
2516646,4,B000EDWKXI,"Heath Ledger proved his versatility as an actor in 2005 by playing very diverse characters in four different movies. Hot off the heels of his gay cowboy role in the 1960s in Brokeback Mountain, he went on to portray one of the world's greatest lovers of women in Casanova. With his matinee idol good looks, Ledger is well-cast in this role.

Ledger has a lot of fun with the role, much in the same way Johnny Depp did in Don Juan DeMarco. He gets to play a legendary seducer of women and showcase a deft touch for light comedy. Sienna Miller also does a good job as Ledger's romantic foil. Up until now she has had small roles in films like Alfie and Layer Cake but it is this role that finally gives this up and coming actress some serious screen time. The comic irony is that Francesca's suitor is played by the very unromantic acting and awkward looking Oliver Platt. Of course, he doesn't stand a chance against the dashing and witty Ledger.

Casanova explores the conflict between marrying for love and marrying for what others want. He is torn between marrying for business so that he can stay in Venice and following his heart which lies with Francesca. She is torn between marrying a man that will get her family out of debt but whom she does not love. Despite their pragmatic exteriors they are ultimately romantics at heart. Hallstrom has made another pleasant period romantic comedy a la Chocolat, although not quite as endearing as that film. Casanova is a well-made piece of entertainment.

""Creating an Adventure"" takes a look at the making of Casanova. They shot the film entirely in Venice which had not been done in 35 years, even shooting in some places for the first time.

""Dressing in Style"" examines the gorgeous costumes made for the movie. Inspiration was taken from classic period paintings. This department also had the daunting task of dressing over 400 extras for some scenes.

""Extended Sequence - `Hidden in Plain Sight'"" features additional footage of Casanova and Francesca on the run from the Bishop's men.

""Visions of Venice"" takes a look at this historic city. Much of its classic look has been preserved so exploring it is akin to going back in time.

Finally, there is an audio commentary by director Lasse Hallstrom. He mentions what was shot on location and what was done on a soundstage which tends to get tedious after awhile. This is a fairly bland track that could have been better if he had someone else to play off of.",1146528000,,2464,4.650574712643678

And that is clearly the best part of this adaptation of the life of the infamous womanizer Casanova.  The film sparkles, glows, and reeks of atmosphere, gratefully hiding the fact that the script is a mediocre mishmash of history and purged legend.

Casanova is played by Heath Ledger and while it must be said that he does a fine job of creating the character he is given to play, this Casanova is a rather bland, skinny, lustless ordinary man, not one that would make a city full of ladies swoon for his ardor.  Though we see a few very tame conquests in the first minutes of the film, this Casanova is pictured as a grown boy, pining for his harlot mother who left him as a child, and a man who really longs to discover the love of his life and settle down.  He encounters a true feminist in Francesca Bruni (Sienna Miller) who is disguising her considerable profeminist writing talents as one Guardi.  But alas, Francesca is betrothed to the Lard King of Genoa, Paprizzio (Oliver Platt) and Casanova becomes engaged to a sexually frustrated Victoria (Natalie Dormer) who is in turn desired by Francesca's nerdy virgin brother Giovanni (Charlie Cox).  To further complicate matters Casanova is pursued by the Inquisition in the form of Bishop Pucci (Jeremy Irons) and is tried and convicted of ribald acts with nuns, sentenced to hang etc etc etc.  Paprizzio arrives from Genoa as Carnivale is beginning, and though intended for Francesca, he is more attracted to Francesca's widowed mother Andrea (Lena Olin).  There are endless scenes of mistaken identities abetted by the wearing of masks at Carnivale and the bits and pieces of all the intrigues fall together in a humorous and entertaining fantasy fashion.

Venice is splendid as the star, especially as captured by cinematographer Oliver Stapleton and the story romps along to a glorious musical score by the very fine Alexandre Desplat with a lot of help from Albinoni, Corelli, Handel, Soler, Paisiello, Rameau and Vivaldi!  This is hardly a raucous picture one would expect about the wiles of the legendary Casanova, but once you accept the fact that the story has been cleaned up a lot it comes across as fleetingly great fun.  The stunningly costumed cast is consistently first rate, with Oliver Platt once again demonstrating that he can play almost any role he is given to perfection! This is a fun movie and a great travelogue for those of us addicted to the beauties of Venice!  Grady Harp, April 06",1146096000,2,2704,4.776824034334764

Heath Ledger plays Casanova, and he is very good in the semi swashbuckling role.  The role of Francesca is played by Sienna Miller, who does a fine job in her role as an early feminist.  The role of the Pope's inquisitor Bishop Pucci is played by Jeremy Irons, who does a solid job.  The scene stealer of the film is Natalie Dormer as Victoria, Casanova's fiance.  Think a younger version of Uma Thurman, and hopefully she will have that type of career.

The director says that he believes that the film got and R rating because of one scene at carnival where Casanova is trying to juggle his two love interests Francesca, and Victoria.  There is a scene where Victoria crawls under the table.  I personally believe that the film got a R rating from the scene in the nunnery.  It gives a whole new meaning to the old saying, ""Get thee to a nunnery.""

The film is visually stunning, but that is mostly because the movie was filmed in Venice, and you are seeing things that you haven't seen before, because they haven't been put on film in 80 years.  If you are like me you who feel like you were watching a little piece of history, or walking through a good museum, because the city itself becomes a character in the movie.

The soundtrack is reminiscent of Vivaldi, but surprisingly, it's not.  I would call this music baroque, but I am not sure it's that either.

To sum up, I found this movie, a highly enjoyable drama/comedy for adults.  Casanova would make a good double feature with Dangerous Beauty or Dangerous Liaisons, both of which are available at Amazon.com and all of which I can highly recommend.  So, sit back and enjoy an evening with these DVD's, and don't forget the popcorn.",1146009600,2,1847,4.498498498498498
2516652,5,B000EDWKXI,"Don't let the awful coverjacket fool you, this is the best movie of 2006.  All eyes were on Brokeback Mountain, another great film, but this is the Heath Ledger movie to watch -- and see what a great actor he is creating a totally different performance in the same year.

Any comparisons to shakespeare in love is ludicrous, this movie is so much better.  A great romantic comedy, a great comedy and a great movie period.

This movie is fun, heartwarming and hilarious.  I was completely surprised at how good this movie is and you will be too.  I've seen over a 100 movies last year and this tops my list.",1145836800,3,606,4.414414414414415

8108503,3,B000EDWKXI,"The Music, The Art, The Period.
I would have given this film 2-stars, if not for such a Beautiful and Romantic Setting.

The Production Value was truly Captivating.
The first half of the movie was even amusing, and light-hearted.

If this movie were made, in this day-and-age, it would likely be softcore pornography.
There really wasn't very much indiscretion in the film, which was a pleasant surprise.

The Casting was Great, but the Plot suffered about half way through the film.
When it was all about relationships, it made sense, but when they introduced the Catholic Inquisition, it quickly became a trainwreck.

Despite the adversity, all of the characters managed to keep things light, even when they were caught by the authorities, taunted with hot-pokers, or on the verge of being hanged, which is a huge flaw in the writing of the story-arc of the film.
The end of the movie basically turns this into a cheap action movie.

Chuck Norris could've made an appearance at the grand escape.
That really knocked this film down a star.

They should have focused more on the art, and beauty, rather than the Casanova somehow being an enemy of the Catholic Church.
It's interesting, though, in that the music seemed Baroque, and yet, Casanova lived during the Classical Period.

Still, there are some very sweet, and redeeming moments in this film, despite all the silliness.
Definitely worth a watch, but don't expect it to hit the mark.",1513209600,,1441,4.881147540983607
8108504,4,B000EDWKXI,"A delightful movie.  If only New Line (Shakespeare in Love) rather than Disney had released it!  The electric Natalie Dormer, just now reaching the stardom she has long deserved, is a great supporting player.",1511481600,,208,5.088235294117647

It's such a great love story. With female independence, hot guys, and plenty of action it's a great movie all around.",1510185600,,223,4.743589743589744
8108507,5,B000EDWKXI,"A fantasy romp through a long-loved legend!  A fun ride for all the romantic who live a comedic romance.  The incomparable Heath Ledger brings home the prize,again.  A pleasure to see there as very little graphic content, presented in the old world style.  Worth the watch,and probably a second watch! Enjoy!!",1507939200,,309,5.0
8108508,5,B000EDWKXI,"As the movie opens we approach Casanova from behind as he is about to reveal a story that is not his to tell. Based loosely on the known history of Casanova this play takes place and is filmed in Venice. It is one of those farces of mistaken identity and opportunity.

Everyone did an excellent portray of the characters and the time. However I must say I was very much taken by Victoria (Natalie Dormer) the Genoa virgin. I wonder how she makes her nostrils flair like that. And that was a cute scene when she broke the wooden bridge that was made just for that scene.

Aside from the great music, much of it original, there are some beautiful panoramas and sunsets. And for those that like adventure or S and M you will not be disappointed. There is even a scene with a real swinger.",1506470400,,785,4.333333333333333
