8449506,5,B004Z6N7VY,This is an amazing DVD. I am glad that I bought it for my 3 1/2 year old. She loves it and now she knows every instrument that is played in the DVD. She learned a lot foundational music. It's fun to watch her practicing tempo and rhythm. It's apt for the age group 3-5.,1426636800,2,269,3.909090909090909
8449507,5,B004Z6N7VY,"My son and daughter absolutely love this DVD. They are captivated by it and there's nothing I object to in the video that I'm thinking of trying another one to see if it has the same affect. This DVD is very well done. I can't stand all the whiny, bratty, back talking kid shows on tv. I'd rather invest in a few videos.",1410048000,,320,4.095238095238095

8449509,5,B004Z6N7VY,"I purchased this for my twelve month old daughter and she immediately feel in love with it. She tries to mimic what the kids on the video do. She will sit throughout the whole dvd and watch with amazement. I highly recommend this dvd. Now that she is more mobile, she is trying to do the dances that the kids do. So cute.",1368403200,2,321,4.111111111111111

Music can be a very complex subject, but Brainy Baby has not only made it fun, they made it EASY for a child to learn.  If you are looking to teach the subject of music, this is the ONLY DVD you need to buy!  My kids LOVE it!",1320883200,7,306,3.8253968253968256
