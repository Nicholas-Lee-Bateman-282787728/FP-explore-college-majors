3959453,2,B002NN7EYC,"I was highly disappointed after watching the wonderful first season to see this group of lackluster episodes. The addition of ""The Diner"" and it's manager the love guru, Parker's new steady girlfriend (a surefire shark jumper right there) plus the toned downed hatred and angst of all the other characters, Larry K, Parker's Sister, fleshing out of every villain in the show, made the season all about camera angles and which guest star can we spot.

The writing was FAR less witty and creative compared to the first, and I must say, I can't imagine season 3 being any better. That said, I treasure the first season, which was Gold.",1271635200,3,632,4.745454545454545
3959454,5,B002NN7EYC,"If you are a fan of Parker Lewis Can't Lose, buy this DVD set.  It has all of the first season episodes, and there are some good recent interviews with the cast.  Clever plots and creative writing.",1270598400,3,197,4.297297297297297
3959455,4,B002NN7EYC,"It was great to finally be able to watch all of these, since I was in boarding school when this first aired, wasn't allowed to watch TV there during it's time slot, and only could watch it a few times on vacations and stuff. yet......imho the first season only had one bad ep. (the one at the mall) this one had more than one...or at least not as much fun moments as the first season. There were more serious themed episodes in the second season, but for the most part, they were done well, and had good messages to them. I felt that the one where Mikey is almost conned by Sonny Bono as a con artist, and the one where Jerry joins the football team fell kinda flat, and indicated that the show was starting to wane. Another weak point was when Parker found his constant steady girlfriend, Annie, who really was a generic female character. She could have been given a more interesting personality. And the one where Parker composes a love poem to her, and there is romance in the air with everybody else-UGH. One serious ep. with a good message done well, I felt was the one where Mikey works at the diner, and has to deal with his emotional problems and responsibilities. Also the one where Jerry mentors a geeky awkward girl and has to rescue her from a hellacious netherworld for dejected geeks stands out in my mind as a great one that was both funny and poignant. As I recall, from what I've seen of the third season, the show lost it's edge by then. But in this season, the show still has some life left in it.",1268784000,2,1516,4.32280701754386
3959456,5,B002NN7EYC,"I keep this short and sweet. Back in the early ninties ""Parker Lewis can't loose"" was on here in Europe both on English Channels and on one that had it dubbed in German.. Only dubbed in German it lost a lot of it's humour.. That speaks volumes about the show. A bad show you can easily dub and keep the tone.. But in Parker Lewis every spoken Sentence has meaning and is so outragesly funny.. The other thing is how they produced it. They created camera angles and ways to film that were previously unknown..
It's really sad it lasted only 3 Seasons.. Part of it is, that the show was way ahead of it's time.. It would really do well nowadays.. The other thing is fox forced so many changes upon the show by Season 3 that it was doomed to fail.. Still it was the best thing on TV back then and I hope they will also release Season 3.. But I think t hat's a done deal.. By now you probably noticed that I haven't talked a lot about what the show is about.. Well like other Reviewers said, it's a lot like ""Ferris Bueller's Day off"".. In this case we have the ultra cool ""Parker Lewis"" who, portrayed by Corin Nemec leads the cast, we have Mikey.. the Rockn Roll guy and we have a geek who still is in this trio of best friends.. Their adversaries? Mostly their principal and her goon.. Luckily this isn't a Sitcom in the conventional way so we are spared a Laugh Track. Well, if you are interested read up before you buy but I can only recommend it.. Nothing bad to say about this show.. If I the money I would promise everyone their money back if they don't like it.. Sadly I don't .. Still I doubt that anyone would be unhappy with this purchase.. Of course you should start with Season 1 if you haven't already",1266278400,4,1712,4.206686930091186
3959457,5,B002NN7EYC,Parker Lewis Can't Lose: The Complete Second Season is even better than the 1st Season by a mile. Corin Nemec was one of my favorite actors in the early '90s - his comic timing was brilliant! Parker Lewis only lasted 3 seasons but what a treasure this little show was and they don't make dark comedy shows like this anymore. I highly recommend this unforgettable show about the misery and mindless pleasures of high school. Enjoy!,1265155200,6,430,4.671052631578948
3959458,5,B002NN7EYC,"This will be brief: we don't watch television anymore. We don't enjoy watching human stupidity on parade (aka reality shows) or violence. And news is not to be trusted, especially given who some of the sponsors are these days!
But if ""Parker Lewis Can't Lose"" was being broadcast again, we would tune into every show.
For now, though, we will joyously purchase the DVDs as they're released, even reserving copies before they're available, and hope that every episode of the show is put on DVD for our extreme enjoyment as soon as possible.
One reviewer noted that the additional characters seemed to be out of place, but I don't think kids spend all their time in school, the mall or working part-time jobs. They also socialize; they have hangouts besides shopping centers. I loved the changes, the actors and the excellent life lessons each show imparted without shoving them down ones throat.
I won't be happy until we own the COMPLETE series, not just 2 seasons worth of shows!
THANK YOU, SHOUT!",1262822400,6,998,4.808139534883721
3959459,5,B002NN7EYC,"This is a TV spin-off of John Hughes movie ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off."" Both NBC and Fox networks tried to cash in on this successful teenage movie into TV series; NBC failed, and Fox won in their bids to make successful TV versions. Parker Lewis Can't Lose became a huge success during the early days of Fox network and produced 25 episodes in the second season of its three year run. The story revolves around three teenage high school kids (The Buds); Parker Lewis (Corin Nemec), Mikey Randall (Billy Jayne) and Jerry Steiner (Troy Slaten) who handle day-to-day problems/setbacks as a team. Their adversaries are school Principal Ms. Grace Musso (Melanie Chartoff), school special helper Frank Lemmer (Taj Johnson), and Parker Lewis's sister Shelly Lewis (Maia Brewton), and occasionally school bully Larry Kubiac (a.k.a. Kube; Abraham Benrubi). In the second season the writers introduce a steady girl friend Annie Sloan (Jennifer Guthrie) for Parker Lewis, and the effect of this on the dynamics of buds relationship is explored.

In the episode ""Geek Tragedy,"" Jerry takes a young nerdish girl from school under his wings and tries to mentor her and show that he can be as cool as his buds. When she leaves the nest too early his eggshell-ego begins to crack. ""When Jerry met Shelly"" is one of my favorite episodes where Jerry's secret love for Shelly is explored. But beware; the protective brother Parker is one loose who tries to stop the budding romance. In the episode ""Glory Daze,"" an alumnus returns to accept an award. Harry Anderson of Night Court plays the alumnus role. In the episode ""Civil Wars,"" Parker's parents have a couple's spat when Parker's mother (Anne Bloom) takes a philosophy class, and Parker's father, Martin Lewis (Tim Stack) feels left out and his `man's ego"" kicks in. The kids feel the effect of the squabble. I very much like this episode since a serious problem in family life is studied in sitcom environment in a splendid way. In the episode ""Tower of Power,"" Grace Musso ask the buds to make a documentary about the school, but Parker has no time thanks to his new history teacher, known for strict discipline in educational system, wears off Parker as well as Frank Lemmer. Eventually Parker confronts the teacher about his exam evaluation methods and defends his adversary Frank who is supposed to be very good in history. Frank Lemmer is portrayed in the show as disciplined and school-rule enforcing, right-wing republican who wants to joint the Air Force Academy to serve the country.  In the episode ""Raging Kube"", Kube gets a girlfriend, who is big like him and loves animals like whales, preaches about protecting environment and practice pacifism, which turns Kube very mellow. The school becomes defenseless against Donald Yemano (Tony Nittoli), a fellow student who runs his affairs at school like God Father Vito Corleone and even buds get scared. A simple fight of will between Kube and Yemano drives the little God Father out of the school. This is another wonderful episode where the problems of bullies are examined in a high school in a situation comedy. In the episode ""Fat boy and Little Man,"" Jerry joins the football team and becomes king of the gridiron. When the school's football star Kube's brain is filled with game plans and can't think anymore, football coach asks for smart kid Jerry to assist in the game. Jerry plays in the football team excels in the game but fumbles on his friendship with buds and Kube, which alienates everyone. At last he sees the light. This is another favorite episode of mine. In the episode ""Father knows less,"" the impact on a kid's education is studied in a one-parent family and the toll it takes on the parent looking after the kid. When a local business man sponsors a family build-a-better-toaster contest, Mikey can't participate because his mother doesn't have the time; but his buds Parker and Jerry get lot of help from their respective fathers.

Character study of Grace Musso, Frank Lemmer and Parker Lewis suggest similarities to Major Margaret Houlihan, Frank Burns and Hawkeye of TV show MASH in terms of antagonistic interactions, but there is no romance between Musso and Lemmer. Corin Nemec, in the lead role does a wonderful job as a cool kid, and Melanie Chartoff as the bossy school principal, Abraham Benrubi as the school bully and Maia Brewton as a meddling sister have provided great performances. I was disappointed when this show was not nominated in the best series category for Emmy award during the first two seasons.

It is unfortunate that series went down hill in the third season as the creative content of the show failed. During the early years of Fox network, there was tremendous pressure from Fox executives to perform better in Nielsen's ratings. Hence, the writers introduced new characters to the show; but they did not fit-in with the existing characters in terms of the story lines. This had significant negative impact on the show overall.

8375182,5,B002NN7EYC,"Take high school, mix in Looney Toones, even slip in a little bit of wholesome morality and you have Parker Lewis. Here was a teenager who could both endear himself to his peers and annoy those in authority namely Principal Musso (Melanie Chartoff). Parker had his close friends namely Mikey who was the rocker and Jerry who was the geek who had a coat that could do everything.  There were two things that impressed me about Parker Lewis and the first was that none of the characters were malicious (devious maybe like Parker's little sister Shelly). The second was that the show was clean and that is something that you don't see much of these days. Like a lot of shows it was smart and went out on a high note.",1438992000,,713,4.442748091603053

8375186,4,B002NN7EYC,"Anyone who was around in the nineties, most likely at least noticed Parker Lewis Can't Lose.
Part Ferris Beuller, and part video game era 90's cheese stands the man who can't lose.

I was a big fan of this show when I was younger and was always excited to catch it on T.V. It normally involves some kind of problem with one of the characters who eventually with the help from their friends, overcome said problem. It's never very rational or realistic, but silly and with a ton of inside jokes to boot.

It's kind of hard to describe the show if you haven't seen it. The hi jinx and goofy humor, along with the 90's cheese is awesome, and still holds up if you ask me. The special effects in the show to make things seem wacky are fun to watch as well. And all in all, the best buds still rock on till this day.

This show should bring back some nice warm feelings for those who were kid's or teens watching it in the nineties, and it also has a good camaraderie feeling as well.

Video Quality: C-(I was dissapointed in the video quality on the first few episodes, they seem a touch better as the series goes on. It's decent enough for a show from the 90's =))
Audio Quality :B (Standard fare, seemed fine)
Aesthetics: B (decent cover art and box, the slim cases inside were nice and didn't take up a ton of room)
Price: B (for around $10-$20 you could snag a season each, for the 25 episodes and 570 minutes, it's well worth it )
Extras: B (The commentaries can be cool, but was hoping for a little more insight on the cast, but they pretty much filled that gap in the first season release.)
Overall: B+ (one of my favorite t.v. shows, a guilty pleasure of mine according to some. Besides the video quality being eh, it's a great set for a great show. Even though season 1 was a bit better, season 2 is still a fun romp.)",1328745600,,1823,4.2298850574712645
8375187,1,B002NN7EYC,"Hey, Parker Lewis Can't Lose is a unique show, and now has provided me with a unique experience in DVD purchasing.  I ordered them brand sealed new, and all four discs arrived with stains of some sort (don't really want to know what it is) on them.  Gross!  I think the spew, barf, whatever was bad enough to potentially cause damage to the DVD player had I put the worst of the four in.  I can't believe four separate disc pressing lines have the same problem, so it must have happened in the packaging process.  What's going on anyway?

Five stars for Parker, but a huge disappointment with the purchase.  Parker Lewis can't lose, but you can if you don't thoroughly inspect your DVDs when they arrive.

Update --

OK, that wasn't really fair, was it?  So, now that I've seen some of the season 2 episodes I'll say that the writing took a hit somewhere.  It seems the gags are overwhelming the story telling in the second season.  The gags are great when the purpose of the show is to not just show gags.",1318032000,2,1006,4.378378378378378
