8469714,2,B00062J148,"Firstly, Donald Trump DID NOT start the
underrated United States Football League,
which I played in briefly back in the
'80's. The New Jersey Generals were 1st
owned by J. Walter Duncan, who sold the
6-12 team to Trump on Oct. 3rd, 1983,
after the 1st USFL season had been played.

The rest of this film is a [...]
fest that relies on Trump's quirky ('I don't
like to shake people's hands' schtick). Trump
is an egomaniac of legendary proportions who
got his come-uppense in the fine ESPN 30/30
film 'Who Killed the USFL', Mike Tollin.

It does cover most of Trump's early achievements up to the mid 90's, shame it doesn't have information about his more recent conquests, like the apprentice and other more recent projects. It's a good watch.",1176940800,6,325,4.821428571428571
