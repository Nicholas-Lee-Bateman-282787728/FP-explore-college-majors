5722888,2,B00CIOG15E,"A documentary is fine I suppose but as fine as an artist Linda Ronstadt is she should have full concerts out on DVD.  I don't know that she ever had any professionaly taped, but I do know that there are fairly decent bootlegs out there from the late 70's and early 80's.  Maybe they could get the rights to these and remaster the picture and sound.

Personally, I would rather have live concerts on DVD than a documentary.",1372291200,14,422,4.384615384615385
5722889,2,B00CIOG15E,"I see that it's only 48 minutes long and I think people should be warned of this. $15 for a 48min documentary seems like a ripoff to me.

I gave it 2 stars based on the super short duration yet regular price, and based on feedback from others re the quality of the production.",1371600000,11,276,4.111111111111111
5722890,4,B00CIOG15E,It was very good though I like her better with the Nelson Riddle orchestra,1412380800,,74,4.357142857142857
5722891,3,B00CIOG15E,"I like Linda Ronstadt. So why 3 stars? I feel she established herself in the 70's (yes I know she started in the 60's).  The only way I can describe the problem for me with this DVD is - the 80's got in the way. I would have enjoyed it more if there was no picture I suppose, and only audio. A live CD I guess.

First off, like the other reviews state - This is ""not"" a Documentary as Amazon states it is. It's a live concert. Quality's good. It's just the whole band...well...I don't know? The hair, the clothes, the colors, the 80's! Don't misunderstand me, I have nothing against the 1980's. It just doesn't suit them. Ever see Linda perform in the movie ""FM""? Or see the bootleg ""Live in Atlanta""? Now that's the Linda Ronstadt and band I know and love. She still, in this DVD, sings amazingly, but if I ever put it on again, I'll have to run it through the stereo, and leave the TV off.",1412208000,,891,4.144508670520231
5722892,1,B00CIOG15E,"If you think music on your car's AM radio sounds good and low grade video is good too, then you'll like this DVD.  I am a fan of Linda's music, but the sound is so bad, it's not worth having.

I have over 100 rock concert DVDs, including as old as 1969, and this is the worst quality by far.  I have a high end A/V system.  Don't even try 5.1 sound - my Yamaha receiver will put it all out the center channel only.  Switched to stereo, you get better, but the better is what I've been describing.

Very flat, no bass, no treble, no dynamic range, hisses like a cheap store bought cassette tape.

Don't buy unless you have some fetish for Linda.",1410998400,,644,4.104
5722893,5,B00CIOG15E,"On the DVD Faithless Love (a musical documentary), Linda Ronstadt seemed to be at her peak in musicianship. Filmed at a concert in 1980, when she was 34, her voice seems more mature (a bit thicker perhaps) than on many of her earlier hits, which might not please some folks. However, each of the twenty songs is executed with exacting precision musically. The selections range across the years. However, what captured my attention was not her vocals, but the accompanying of the fine, tight band (and back up singers). Every musician was flawless and seemingly exuberant, especially some of the dueling between the guitars and the drummers performance. Said without reservation, this is an impressive DVD. For voice control and delivery in popular music, Ms. Ronstadt is peerless.",1409788800,,780,5.1015625
5722894,5,B00CIOG15E,Great Video a must for all Ronstadt fans and people who love great timeless music. The quality of the video is very good..,1408752000,,122,4.3478260869565215
5722895,4,B00CIOG15E,"Video quality could be alot better, but it's value to me was to see a great singer in her prime with all the energy of youth.",1408752000,,125,3.8461538461538463

5722899,5,B00CIOG15E,I am so impressed with this live concert from 1980.  Linda's voice is incredible and the set list includes many favorites.  Highly recommended.,1403222400,,143,5.173913043478261
5722900,3,B00CIOG15E,"Wish the visual was sharper.  Appeared to me to be a copy of a copy.  Also, I would not call this a documentary!",1399939200,,112,3.8260869565217392
5722901,4,B00CIOG15E,"There is very little I can add to the other 4-star reviews.  Read those ... they are spot-on.  The only reason I bother to say anything is to just lend emphasis to what a true find this DVD really is.  OK, it's early 80s recording quality.  OK, not a lot of bells and whistles in the menus.  Yep, it's mislabeled a ""documentary"" and probably cost 'em a LOT of sales because of that.  Dinged 1-star. Who cares.  It's nearly 90 minutes of a Linda Ronstadt concert, for Pete's sake !!!!!!!",1399507200,,486,4.333333333333333
5722902,3,B00CIOG15E,"I wanted this DVD purely as a visual record of a Linda Ronstadt performance. There is practically nothing else available that visually documents this powerful performer's strength and body of work through the seventies and early eighties. Video quality is poor by today's standards, and sound is just adequate, but it is a gem worth keeping despite its shortcomings.",1398384000,,366,5.220338983050848
5722903,1,B00CIOG15E,"I am able to play all other DVDs, but not this one, so I have not seen it.  I am frustrated and disappointed.",1397088000,,109,3.739130434782609
5722904,4,B00CIOG15E,Linda Ronstadt is a legend in the music world.  This early DVD is a good purchase.  She is so young and talented in this DVD.,1395878400,,125,3.96
5722905,5,B00CIOG15E,"Informative and entertaining, her shows are amazing!  I've been a fan for many years.  Great product, great price and excellent customer service.",1395619200,,145,5.545454545454546
5722906,5,B00CIOG15E,"Loved watching this video, brought back the retro in me.  Linda gives a great performance.  The DVD hasn't been enhanced and it is very raw.  Excellent concert.  Thank you for putting it out there for the world.",1393200000,,211,4.621621621621622
5722907,4,B00CIOG15E,"I would like to have given a 5 star rating, but the recording quality just can't support it. If you are a Linda Ronstadt fan, don't hesitate to get this DVD. Ronstadt and the band give a fine, spirited, performance. They perform most every Linda Ronstadt hit up to 1980, and perform them well. It was a pleasure to watch and listen as Linda sang with her trademark heartfelt emotion. Such a voice.

I don't know of any better option for Linda Ronstadt fans looking for these 1980, and earlier songs.

Buy it.",1391904000,,508,4.451612903225806
5722908,5,B00CIOG15E,"Linda is well-known for singing magnificently beautiful ballads, but this DVD shows just how great of a rocker she was.  She does a great version of Chuck Berry's ""Livin' in the U.S.A.""  She has also, over the years, covered a few other of his songs.  I wish she would have done an entire album of Chuck Berry's Greatest Hits.  I would have liked to hear her sing ""Roll Over Beethoven"" and ""Promised Land.""",1391731200,,406,4.52054794520548
5722909,5,B00CIOG15E,"I put this disc in the machine at the same time as the beginning of the TV network broadcast of the recent 2014 Grammy awards. Whenever there was a commercial, or the ""entertainment"" was too bad to stomach, which was frequent, I switched to Linda Ronstadt. It is a real revelation to hear current pop ""singing"" when it is compared to a true musician. In the past I had never realized just how badly out of tune Pink sings, even when recorded, and Pink was one of the best performers on the program. This is a sad time for music.",1391731200,,528,4.29
5722910,1,B00CIOG15E,I never got to see the film. The content of the DVD was a concert and not the rockumentary. You sent me 4 copies that were all faulty. Check my return chain of emails.,1391126400,,167,3.9411764705882355
5722911,5,B00CIOG15E,"I saw Ms. Ronstadt live-on-stage many times in the '70s, and what can I say: this DVD brings back great memories! The opening ""I Can't Let Go"" just leaves one breathless, and she's just gotten started. The woman didn't play an instrument, she wasn't a songwriter, she couldn't really dance, she wasn't even much good at on-stage banter, but oh-my-goodness could she sing the heck out of a song.

I have another, different DVD copy of this same in-concert event, recorded before an adoring audience at Television Center Studios in Hollywood on 24-April-1980. It has the closing credits that this disc does not, and I do believe--no disrespect meant to any of the production people involved--that the quality just did not pass muster with anyone much less LR herself, and as a result it's only leaked-out in bootleg and now ""documentary"" form by who-knows-who. I have no doubt but that Ronstadt has not made one dime in recording royalties from this as she no doubt hated it if she ever did see it. But isn't it wonderful that it still exists after all these years? Oh my would I love a good videographer from 2014 to get his/her talents applied to the master tape of this!

OK so it is a video (not film) recording of one of her last concerts before leaving her throne as the Queen of Rock; let's enjoy that we still have it and yes it is enjoyable especially for us fans. My wife? It makes her ears hurt. Me? I say ""crank it up""! Compared to my (Japanese, I believe) bootleg DVD of the same program, this one has somewhat muted vocals though a LOT more bottom and overall I have to give the nod to this disc. It also cleans-up the video somewhat but it's still VHS quality at best; blurry in long shots but in close-up, ooh she still melts my heart after all these years.

It's less than $20 bucks folks. Look and see what the fuss was all about. For us fans it's priceless treasure.",1389139200,,1883,4.468023255813954
5722912,3,B00CIOG15E,"After reading all the reviews, I purchased this video.  It was as advertised.  Not great sound or video and not a documentary.  I wanted video of Linda Ronstadt and this is all that is out there unfortunately.  Knowing all that it's pretty good.",1387324800,,245,4.627906976744186
5722913,5,B00CIOG15E,"I've had this non documentary since it aired on HBO back when they didn't even begin broadcasting until 5:00 PM and they filmed a  nugget of gold like this every month. None of these shows has made it to DVD as far as I know. Whomever produced this DVD left out any reference to the actual content, probably to keep HBO from filing a lawsuit. In any event this production is as good as you will find of this show and I've been looking everywhere. While it's not in HD by any standards it was recorded before the advent of Digital Video so the washout of some of the colors, particularly the outfit she performs in and the color of the stage floor has always been the most difficult color to reproduce. Criticism of the format aside this is clearly Linda backed by a great band at her very best. And if you can get over the fact that HD is not possible from a program that was recorded in 4:3 pure analog when 2 channel Dolby Audio was still absent from television and movie theaters I suggest you just purchase it and enjoy Linda at the top of her game. The audio is quite good so in that respect it's worth the purchase price for that alone. Maybe if enough people hound HBO they will either release this or at the very least put it on one of their VOD channels.",1386979200,3,1263,4.2190082644628095

5722915,5,B00CIOG15E,I really love Linda Ronstadt. She has been around for some time and her music is ageless. This was a good DVD to see in live in concert. This was in mint condition and it got to me within a week. Thanks!,1385769600,,203,3.857142857142857

5722917,5,B00CIOG15E,"I don't understand why there's a need to misrepresent this product, calling  it a documentary rather than Linda Ronstadt- Mad Love Concert! I'm so glad I found it, I happened to read the first review that sums up the product.  I also want to add that the video/ picture quality is a non-issue. I'm accustomed to the same hi def perfection that most of have these days, but I always find my eyes adjust just fine to a 1980 quality video picture and forget that it's not our current standard. That's all this is- perfectly normal quality for that time- remember back when we went to the movies and the picture quality was always better than tv?

I'm watching the DVD again now, as I type and Faithless Love just came on- it's perfection. The song has never been sung better- absolutely beautiful.  I'm grateful to whomever broke the rules or whatever is going on to make this product available by misnaming it.",1384214400,,908,4.552147239263804

5722920,4,B00CIOG15E,"First off I wanted to say for a bootleg Ronstadt concert is really enjoyable. Audio is clear. The only draw back that I can see is the picture quality is a little grainy. This concert was filmed in the early 80's during the Mad Love Album period. If your a fan of Ms. Ronstadt I would pick this DVD up. Here's the track listings:

1. Can't Let Go
2. Party Girl
3. It's So Easy
4. Willin
5. I Can't Help It
6. Just One Look
7. Look out For my Love

11. Lies
12. Faithless Love
13. Hurts So Bad
14. Silver Threads & Golden Needles
15. Poor Poor Pitiful Me
16 You're No Good
17. How do I Make You?
18. Back in the USA
19. Heat Wave
20. Desparado

Again this is an early 80's Ronstadt concert NOT an documentary of the artist. Over an hour of singing. Not 48 mins.as stated on product over view.",1380326400,3,833,3.923076923076923
5722921,4,B00CIOG15E,"As noted by others, the video quality is poor and the audio is mono but production values are quite high on this concert recording from 1980. The camera work is competent, the composition is classical and the shots are held long enough for the viewer to appreciate who's playing and what's going on; it's a style of concert recording one does not see often these days. The concert appears to have been switched live. The camera crew seems to be under the guidance of a skilled musical director who was skillfully anticipating every shot. For instance, the cut to the closeup of the guitarist happens a few notes before his solo starts.

Miss Ronstadt looks fabulous, sounds even better and she is so obviously totally into it and thoroughly enjoying being on stage. All of the other performers, who sadly are not credited on the DVD cover, are great, too.

'Tis a cold and lonely heart that can't enjoy adding this wonderful, if flawed and shamelessly over-hyped, disk in the Linda Ronstadtcollection.",1379980800,,1001,4.813953488372093
5722922,5,B00CIOG15E,"The other reviewers can b*tch b*tch b*tch but geez, it's Linda Freakin' Ronstadt!!  Live!  On my tv!  Is the video quality good?  No.  The audio might not even be stereo but the sound is clean, at least.  This concert is especially enjoyable for me since ""Mad Love"" has always been one of my favorite albums.  Until another dvd concert comes out of the woodwork, this is the best a Linda Ronstadt fan can buy.  So, quit yer b*tching and enjoy!",1379980800,,443,4.45

5722924,1,B00CIOG15E,"This is a extremely poor video quality, television special. No content that I could see, but all I did is next, next, next through the songs. A poor tribute to a fine lady and a great singer who can no longer sing because of Parkinsons. I was so disappointed in this. It might look okay on a CRT but on an LCD it looked like a VHS transfer. Enough said, save your money, find a real dcumentary.",1378166400,3,394,4.12987012987013
5722925,4,B00CIOG15E,"As other reviewers have pointed out this is not a musical documentary but a live concert from 1980. This in itself is a bonus as documentaries only tend to have parts of songs and not complete ones.

Live concerts on dvd by Linda Ronstadt are as scarce as hens teeth so this is a bit of a collectors item. The sound quality is good and the video image acceptable considering the age of the source material. The concert features a stellar band and has 20 songs including most of the hits. For the price this is a good buy considering there is very little dvd material of Linda Ronstadt available.",1377734400,3,595,4.409090909090909

5722928,5,B00CIOG15E,"I saw this show when it played the Warfield in San Francisco and have great memories of it.  Yes, this dvd is subpar in  sound and video, but on first play I was hyperventilating and singing along at the top of my lungs, so I think that rates it a 5 star.  Like others I hope that we will see more Ronstadt in our future.  I fear she downplays her accomplishments.  She is a great singer in many fields.  Her Mad Love album is one of my top favorites.  This tour was in support of it.  When she played the Warfield the album had not yet been released.  In this show she is enjoying herself and giving us a chance to come to the party.",1376784000,3,634,4.008
5722929,5,B00CIOG15E,"I purchased this on amazon and watched it last night on Sony HD (LED) TV.  Comments about poor video resolution are correct, and take some minutes to become adjusted to.  Audio is also less than what we get these days on DVD concerts.  DVD production standards are bare bone.  No details/history on disc and almost nothing on package.

I guess it makes a difference if you are old enough to have followed the career of Linda Rondstadt, and can remember the technology developments over the past 40 years.  I'm old enough.  I was one of the many young men who fell in love with Linda Rondstadt and purchased many of her records.  I also know enough about her contemporary musicians to appreciate the importance of the band that performs on this DVD.  She was and is an extremely important part of the story of rock and roll.  I find it hard to believe that her contemporaries who have remained in the spotlight haven't said more in her defense regarding Cleveland, Rolling Stone, etc.  Maybe she already let them know she doesn't want the attention.  Otherwise there's no excuse.

You'd have to be a miserable, tight fisted consumer to object to a $15 dollar investment for this product.  It's wonderful.  The 1980 concert as entertainment, and as history, is well worth the purchase.  Linda Rondstadt clearly was enjoying herself that night.  She sings powerfully, and she looks great.  By the time she sings ""Silver Threads and Golden Needles"" (and it's great), I was completely satisfied.  She was at a peak of her career, even though it was before much that followed.

I recommend you purchase this DVD for the entertainment, and as a single vote of encouragement and gratitude for the pleasure her talent has given to us all.",1376697600,40,1729,4.738255033557047
5722930,2,B00CIOG15E,"Reading here some other reviews; my question: if this is ""Linda @ her peak,"" where is Waddy Wachtel?  Inquiring minds want to know!",1375833600,3,131,4.695652173913044
5722931,4,B00CIOG15E,"As pointed out elsewhere among these reviews, the quality is not very good for this DVD but it's probably the best you're ever going to get for a Linda Ronstadt concert from this era, before she changed her style.

The video looks like it was taken off of someone's home VHS recorder and that's probably what happened since there's a Channel 52 station ID that is plastered across the screen for a few seconds during one of the songs. The video is fuzzy and looks old. Sound-wise, it's in 2.0 but sounds like a mono recording. The quality is decent considering it is from 1980. Dynamic range is narrow, tape hiss abounds and the instruments get congested when everyone is playing at once; it's also not that well balanced as Linda is loud at times and covered by the instruments at other times. It's a shame the sound wasn't better because the musicianship is first rate and of course Linda has such an incredibly good and powerful voice.

As was mentioned in other reviews, the menu screen is laughable and also insulting to Linda, showing her strewn across the bed on her stomach looking like a hooker. Absolutely no class. There's nothing to choose from in the menu except starting it, and at the end of the 78 minutes, it stops abruptly, shows no credits, and loops back to start the first song.

I give it four stars because of the quality of the concert itself - it's a joy having a DVD of a Linda Ronstadt concert (and, as others have said, this is not a documentary, it's just one song after the other).  The production quality of the DVD itself is laughably low class.  I'm surprised it even has a label on the disc rather than just being a blank Memorex with someone writing the title on with a marking pen. It's that bad. Whoever put this together should be ashamed of themselves.",1375315200,4,1791,4.498461538461538
5722932,1,B00CIOG15E,"The first two red flags--- ""Desparado"" misspelling--- giving away the low-budget nature of this dvd. Second, the main menu supposedly showing Ronstadt laying on a bed in lingerie---tacky. Lousy picture, lousy production. Musical documentary indeed. Just watched the latest Eagles Documentary. What a difference. This one is simply embarrassing. I might pay 2 or 3 dollars for this, but $15? What a ripoff.",1375142400,5,405,5.444444444444445
5722933,3,B00CIOG15E,"First off, terrific career-spanning set list, and great set of musicians...and Linda was in great voice.  My one complaint, and it's a big one, is that audio can be heard only out of the front speakers.  Given the 1980 concert, I can understand no surround sound, but why not allow dolby digital stereo sound through the back speakers of home theatre systems.  This greatly reduced the overall experience and performance quality.  Having said that, I agree with the other review saying this is likely the best we'll ever get....and at least we get to hear and see Linda in a full concert in her prime.  Given the audio limitations, IMO, the best productions were the ""softer"" classics in which Linda sang solo:  Desperado, Faithless Love, Willin' and Blue Bayou.",1375056000,2,762,4.868217054263566
5722934,5,B00CIOG15E,"Let's get this out of the way first.... a.)this is not a documentary b.) there is a cheesy unflattering title page picture that is an insult to a great artist c.) this is not a high quality documented disk but, the picture is not HD but not too bad and the sound is not 5.1 but clean and reliable.

Now.. this is a an energetic high quality performance. Linda is in as fine a voice as ever and is backed by (as is usual in her supporting performers)some of the finest in the business,  Dan Dugmore on electric guitar and peddle steel, Bob Glaub on bass, Russ Kunkel on Drums, Danny Kortchmar on guitar, Kenny Edwards on banjo, guitar (was in Stone Poneys with Linda), Billy Payne on keyboards (from Little Feat, note reprise of keyboard work on Willin'), backup vocals Wendy Waldman, and Peter Asher ( who was also Linda's producer and manager in mid 70's and 80's). The result of this groups performance is nothing short of fantastic with some extended individual showcasing that only adds to the fun. The set rolls uninterrupted for 20 numbers (below)and is over far too soon running for about 80 minutes. If you have any interest in Linda Ronstadt or performances and performers from that time you will not be disappointed with this. Only wish Linda would find a way to collect all of these type performances and publish a collection documented and in the quality manner that she deserves to go with her biography releasing in September.

UPDATE SEPT 2013
As Other reviews have now stated, this is a great performance. Though it may well have technical issues you don't like, it is still a stellar performance, which at the end of the day is the most important thing. It is very much worth the purchase until something better comes along, for the true fan.",1374969600,62,2100,4.4467532467532465
5722935,4,B00CIOG15E,"Lot's of misinformation on these posts.  First, I've had this DVD for years as a bootleg.  It is the only recorded concert on this tour which was the ""Mad Love"" tour in 1980.  This is a concert not a documentary, but I'm glad it's a concert and not a documentary.  It's not 48 minutes it's about 85 minutes in length, with many many terrific songs.  The band is one for the ages, as stated by others.  Every musician on here is famous in there own right.  I'm very sorry that Linda never had any professional quality concerts recorded by her own record company.  The HBO ""What's New"" concert might be the best recorded one I've seen but it's an HBO concert also.  If you love Linda as I do, you'll love seeing her in her prime, because in 1980 she was unreal live, I saw this tour. Hoping they re-master the ""What's New"" tour concert for DVD release very soon.  She did record for German TV a fantastic concert in 1976 that maybe will get redone, and there is also a recorded concert from the ""Simple Dreams"" tour in 1977 from the Fox Theater in Atlanta that could be re-mastered and fixed up.  Hoping all that happens.  But for a true Linda fan, there is no better concert DVD that's as good as this at this time.  Hoping for more, but you never know.  Linda is retired and I don't think she worries about her legacy very much, we ALL know how great she was.  To bad the Rock + Roll Hall of Fame continues to snub the Queen of Rock and Roll, she always was, and she always will be the original Queen Of R+R.  The first time I saw her live was in 1976 at the Summit in Houston Texas, after seeing her perform I knew that she had no equal, and she never will.",1374624000,149,1658,4.182965299684542

5722937,5,B00CIOG15E,"Being a big long time fan of Linda's I was happy with this. No its not in HD but still good quality. This is a 1 hour and 18 minute concert(not 48 minutes) with no interruption in between songs. I don't think die hard Linda's fans would be to disappointed. I'd like to see more concert DVD releases by Linda especially ""What's New"". Hopefully we will see more in the future.",1374537600,11,374,4.28169014084507
5722938,4,B00CIOG15E,"I totally disagree with the other reviewers.  Firstly, the title of the DVD is misleading.  This is not a documentary - thank God.  This is a 1980 concert, presumably shown on the then-new HBO, and covers all of her major LPs up to that point.  For that, I'm grateful.  Documentaries are usually short snipets of songs voiced over by some narrator.  Now granted, the video quality is not up to today's standards, but it is acceptable to me.  The audio I would rate as good to very good.  Linda is in fine voice and looks great, too.  The band is tight and includes some of the best session musicians L.A. had to offer.  Do the names Russ Kunkel,  Danny Korchmer and Peter Asher ring any bells?  The concert features several cuts from three of my favorite Ronstadt LPs, ""Heart Like a Wheel,"" ""Living in the U.S.A.,"" and ""Simple Dreams.""

Considering the dearth of Ronstadt concert material, available, I'm glad I took the chance and bought this DVD.  Highly recommended for Linda fans.",1374537600,50,984,4.645348837209302
5722939,1,B00CIOG15E,"Buyers beware!!! Just got this in the mail today and there is nothing documentary about it!!!! It's a very badly edited DVD of her 1980 HBO concert. I am not pleased at all!! The resolution is very bad and blurry!!! I Submitted a refund request as I do not want it!!! The concert footage does not have any credits, the DVD menu has her spread out across the bed like a hooker and there is a title across the menu that reads Linda Ronstadt: One Night Stand and to make it worse when the concert ends, it loops to the beginning. I am a DIE hard Linda Ronstadt fan, I HATED IT and I want to discourage any Linda fans (or anyone else for that matter)from buying it!! Musical Documentary? What a joke!!!!!",1374278400,28,700,4.2706766917293235

8582123,1,B00CIOG15E,Do not buy this DVD.  The audio is horrible.  There is a loud buzz that ruins the entire experience.  I have always loved Linda and have many of her CDs.  I really like the back up band on this tour but that is all negated by the horrible audio.  I have heard many pirated recordings that are much better than this.,1456790400,,315,4.098360655737705
8582124,5,B00CIOG15E,"Read JCB's 'Most Helpful Review' and others from Summer-2013.  We're two years down the road, this DVD is now apparently OOP and will set-you-back $50-$100, but this live concert performance from Linda Ronstadt's 1980 'Mad Love Tour' remains the best recording available from the height of her powerful R&R voice and sex appeal!  Yes the recording is all analog and 4:3, but the DVD's 'blacks' are really deep black, not a washed grey, and the performers are correctly-exposed with good clarity.  Though the audio includes some nasty hiss and limited dynamic range, with a tad bit of judicious EQing, you can attenuate some of the hiss, then crank-it-up and enjoy!",1440547200,,664,5.0181818181818185
