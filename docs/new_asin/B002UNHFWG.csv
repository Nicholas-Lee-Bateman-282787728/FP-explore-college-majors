3991325,4,B002UNHFWG,"I really enjoyed this movie.  It was inspirational and romantic.  The acting was great, and the plot wasn't lame like some Christian movies I've seen.",1264118400,,150,4.96
3991326,5,B002UNHFWG,"The movie No Great Love is about how amazing love is. The love that a husband has for his wife, the love that a father has for his son, the love that a person has for themselves to seek help from addictions, and best of all is the love that the Lord has for us. My family watched it and we laughed and cried. The Biblical truths, the drama, the romance, and the music in this movie rates a 10! We have been blessed by this movie!",1264118400,66,429,3.942528735632184
3991327,5,B002UNHFWG,"If you enjoyed Fireproof, you will love this movie.  The acting may be slightly poorer but the story line is excellent.  There are moments where it is not believable.  For instance, the idea that the son/husband would be immediately OK with the mom/wife that ran out on them 10 years ago would be a stretch.  But once you get past that, the story is gripping and the truths are so theologically sound.  I recommend this film for anyone that enjoys good Christian films.  I also recommend this for anyone who is sick of the garbage that Hollywood is putting out.",1264118400,3,561,4.56
3991328,5,B002UNHFWG,"This movie is the best that I have seen since........ well, since Fireproof. I would tell anyone to get this movie, as this is the kind of love that it takes to keep a marriage going, and (or) to restore both people to the same spouse. I highly recommend this movie as it told me a lot about what marriage is to be, what it is not to be, and how to keep a good marriage.",1264118400,,370,3.8815789473684212
3991329,5,B002UNHFWG,"no greater love is such an overwhelming example of what and how god uses us when we feel we have failed and there's no way back.  i prepurchased 5 copies to share and in two days i had to purchase 5 more because god and put so many in my path that this movie spoke to.  many, many kuddo's to all who participated in getting this much needed movie out to the public.",1264118400,,365,3.9863013698630136
3991330,5,B002UNHFWG,"The message of this movie is powerfully delivered. The main character, Jeff Baker, is faced with difficult situations that he must work through, and in the process he learns important lessons in what makes a great marriage. Heather, the lead lady, must work through what God expects of her as well. I  believe that this movie will be an encouragement to many who grapple with the same issues it deals with, which includes forgiveness, love and a second chance.  I highly recommend this movie for both married and single people because some of the lessons the characters learn are universal.

Being a lover of classic literature and having a bit of an artistic side, I have to say that the quality of this movie is excellent. The character development is well done and believable, and the acting is high quality. The plot moves forward at a good pace, keeping the viewer's interest throughout the movie. The filming techniques used are artistically beautiful and greatly enhance the movie.  I was very impressed and refreshed. This is not a cheesy or forced movie.",1264032000,9,1063,4.856353591160221
3991331,5,B002UNHFWG,"Can love survive betrayal? A broken marriage? Ten years of separation? Full of drama, laughter, and some exciting plot twists, ""No Greater Love"" reminds us that ""many waters cannot quench love, nor will rivers overflow it"" (Song of Solomon 8:7).

The screenplay, sound score, and production quality of the film are all excellent. With one or two exceptions among minor characters, the acting is top notch. Quinn and Bisutti are brilliant in their lead roles and relationship. Best of all, we find a picture of redemption that ascends even beyond the story of one man and one woman to the only One who perfectly characterizes love: Jesus Christ.

It's difficult to compete with the big budgets and hi tech equipment of Hollywood, but movies like ""No Greater Love"" show that Christian studios are finally coming of age and making it to the big leagues. How encouraging that the greatest story in the universe - our redemption through Jesus Christ - is finally being told in creative, quality, and winsome ways through modern media.",1263859200,121,1029,4.942196531791907
3991332,5,B002UNHFWG,"If you loved FIRE PROOF you will love this one even more . It will keep you on the edge of your seat.
 The message is clear. I would even say even better made. Great music too.
As with all of the movies that came before this movie you will laugh and cry .
It is a must see and if you have the other 4 movies that came before this one it is a must buy .

3991386,1,B002UNHFWG,"The acting was okay, but the story line didn't work. *SPOILER ALERT!!!*
It starts out with Jeff and his wife Heather arguing. Heather leaves Jeff and their baby boy, Ethan. Now, 10 years later Jeff is dating Katie. He wants to propose to her. But Ethan goes to a summer church camp where Heather is a volunteer. Jeff finds out and he wants Heather back as his wife. He talks to the pastor who says because Jeff isn't a Christian, it is not Biblical for a Christian to marry a non-Christian. Jeff asks, ""But what if a Christian and a non Christian are already  married?"" The pastor says that if they are married and non-Christian wants to stay in the marriage, then the Christian should stay. (That's in 1 Corinthians.) Jeff announces to Heather that he never signed the divorce papers, so they are still married. Um... wait. What? (See Problem #2)

Okay. Here are a few problems:
#1: Heather walked out on her family. After she got her life straightened out and became a Christian, why didn't she try to find her son? Even if she didn't want Jeff back, didn't she want her son? She said she tried to find them, but it seems she could have done more to find him if she had wanted to.

#2: Jeff was going to propose to Katie. Even if Heather wasn't back in the picture at that point, he knew he was still married. How could he consider proposing to someone else and making himself a polygamist?

#3: It was mentioned by one of Jeff's friends that Heather (prior to her leaving and becoming a Christian) was ""drunk on the floor"". But Jeff consumes alcohol in several scenes. Why would he want to drink when he knew that's what caused his problems with Heather?

#4: Heather isn't back in the movie until much later. The audience is introduced to Katie who is a wonderful person and cares about Jeff and Ethan. Ethan is happy Jeff is going to propose to her because he likes her and wants her to be his mom. When Heather comes back into the picture, this dumps poor Katie to the curb. The audience is introduced to a woman we like only to have her replaced by someone we haven't gotten to know until late in the game.

#5: Ethan sure welcomed his mom back easily enough. He called her ""mom"" right away even though he hadn't seen her since he was a baby. There should have been a longer period of him getting to know her. Maybe should have been a bit of resentment that she left him in the first place. That would have made more sense.

I was unable to finish watching this movie because the DVD was defective and failed about 3/4 of the way into the movie. But these are the problems I found up to that point. Honestly, I was ready to quit watching it anyway.",1425772800,4,2655,4.340725806451613

Nice portrayal of a father valuing his son and staying faithful to his love for his wife despite circumstances.  A good exploration of hurt and reconciliation.
Negative aspects include a lack of depth and the cheesy cringe factor. Also, the two main non-believers just seem more compelling and real than the other characters. A film that had the potential to be a great example of how to help people know God, but ultimately fails because the church community seems all snug smiles and confusing explanations. Unintentionally portrays the way many Christians interact awkwardly with 'outsiders.' It seems that the film was made more as a reflection of the way a church wishes people would interact with them, rather than a realistic view of how they actually do.
Verdict: Mostly positive but lacking true depth. Some great scenes and ideas which make an enjoyable movie. I only wish that it could have felt more genuine.",1421452800,3,1052,4.943502824858757

3991433,2,B002UNHFWG,"Wow. I really had high hopes for this movie: I hoped it would be a Biblical example of relationship, forgiveness, redemption, etc.  Unfortunately, No Greater Love is EVERYTHING wrong with Christian movies.  Stereotypically everything.  Yes, what you're thinking right now.

The most Christ-like person in the entire movie is the unbeliever!  Quinn's character is loyal, loving, a good father, quick to forgive, honest, and level-headed.  All of the Christians are judgmental, stubborn, afraid, insecure, preachy, over-reactive, slow to forgive, and worst of all, slow to ACCEPT forgiveness.

How can a Christian, whose entire worldview rests on Christ's forgiveness of their sins, first of all not be just as quick to forgive others, but at least quick to accept forgiveness from others?  That's just hypocritical.

When Quinn is reunited with his wife, her first response is ""I don't deserve your forgiveness"".  Right, you didn't deserve Christ's either but you took it from him.  Why not your husband?  Then her pastor just assumes her husband isn't a Christian AND assumes they were divorced, never asking any questions, never even offering the Gospel message because of those assumptions, just ""Get out of her life, sorry.""  His wife's biggest struggle upon finding out that she's still married is NOT ""How can I then minister to him and/or lead him to Christ"".  No, instead she breaks down into tears that he might force her into not going to church!  Never mind that he seems completely open to everything about Christianity, even searching the Scriptures for his answers and talking with her pastor AND her small group leader on his own compulsion.

This woman abandons her family and there isn't a word of support breathed for her husband.  On the other hand, his son nags him continuously about a video game while he's on the phone and he snaps at him ""Can't you see I'm on the phone?!"" and hell breaks loose.  The monster!  His wife weeps.  His son is DEVASTATED.  His friend stands in between him and his family as though protecting them from this hideous unbeliever who might at any moment turn into Satan himself, even as the man is trying to apologize.

If I were not a Christian and I happened to see this movie, I would never, ever, let anyone I cared about near such a damaging cult.  That should be more than enough reason to skip No Greater Love.  I know they meant well, but they failed miserably in their execution.

Listening to the Behind the Scenes, it became obvious where the problems lie: 1) The church was searching for a movie to make. Rather than having a story to share, they were grasping around for anything that might turn into a movie.  Why?  Beats me.  2) The producer goes on and on about how he didn't want to be preachy, just tell the story the best he could, but the entire film is just a sermon.  Either he's never told a story in his life or he's just so church-y that he's never seen how bad his blinders are blocking his vision.  It's as everyone involved had never read any book except the Bible itself, possibly with a few sermons from centuries dead preachers thrown in.

In summary, as a Bible believing, Christ following, Christian on the lookout for wholesome stories for my family, I was offended throughout the entire movie.  I will not be letting my kids see this movie.",1386028800,7,3323,4.765323992994746

3991463,3,B002UNHFWG,"As a Christian, I really hoped this movie would be good! And the entire first part of this movie was not just good, but outstanding: compelling plot, excellent acting, and a lot of emotional buildup, as we watch a woman get miraculously reunited with the husband and son she abandoned ten years earlier.

However... even though they're still married, the wife remains skittish toward the husband and refuses to move back in with him and her son, for reasons she never directly states. We are led to believe that she behaves in this manner because she's become a Christian and he is not. And also because of unresolved marital issues from their past, which she stews over but never directly discusses with him. She also wonders if she should continue with her plans to move to another city to start a ministry (and abandon her husband and son a second time in the name of Christ... huh?) This all makes no sense, in light of the fact that the wife claims to have unsuccessfully searched and searched for the father and son for years, wanting desperately to be reunited with them.

Unfortunately, the entire movie unravels at this point, digressing into scene after scene of increasingly unfocused relational ambiguity, with little dialogue between husband and wife, and even less character development. Finally, the movie resolves in a way that gives off the message that when a husband and wife are both Christians, all marital problems magically go away. That's not the way real life works--just because you're both Christians doesn't make all marriage problems disappear.

This movie was a disappointment, because it had such potential, but failed to realize it. Even so, I still give it three stars because the first part was so well done.",1357862400,6,1742,4.878378378378378

3991477,3,B002UNHFWG,"I normally love Christian films, and overall, I liked the plot in this - but the script does have some faults.

First, Jeff KNEW he had never signed the divorce papers, so legally he was still married... yet he is getting ready to PROPOSE to another lady?! Seriously??

Next, the reasoning behind Heather not wanting to move back in with Jeff is a bit twisted. She should've just expressed concern about the fact that she is now a Christian and he is not.  Instead they use the excuse that she shouldn't marry a non-believer, according to the Bible.  However, the reason many Christians don't approve of divorce and remarriage is because when we marry, we make our vows before God, so even if we divorce, in the eyes of God, we are STILL married.  Since they were previously married, they were technically STILL married, divorce papers or not.  I can't imagine ANY Christian pastor not encouraging a couple to restore their marriage.  It wasn't like she was wanting to marry someone ELSE.  Even if Jeff HAD signed the divorce papers, he was STILL her husband in God's eyes.  The movie has this part of the plot completely twisted and perverted, in my opinion!!

Lastly, throughout the movie, it shows Jeff's faults, of always putting work before family.  But there is nothing at the end to show he really changes from this behavior.  He does tell her, ""I want what you have,"" but if I'd written the story, I would've had Jeff eventually coming to church with her, and finally make an open profession to accept Jesus.

I was glad for a story about a restored marriage, instead of the usual ""forget the ex, find someone new"" story line we often see.  But in my opinion, the producers have not portrayed accurate Christian beliefs, and they missed an opportunity to make a really great movie.  For movies about marriage restoration, ""Fireproof"" is MUCH better.

One last thing - I couldn't stand the pastor in the movie - that creepy smile - he seemed very fake, and eerily reminded me of Warren Jeffs, the polygamist cult leader.  ICK!!",1344038400,6,2034,4.668539325842697

3991480,4,B002UNHFWG,"What a pleasant surprise to watch a Christian movie that is remarkably well done on  a very limited budget.  Strengths: the parts of Jeff and Heather are quite well acted; the plot is straightforward yet interesting and involving, and the ending, like real life, leaves some important things unresolved.  This points us back to what we saw and heard in the film.

Weaknesses:  (1) the overly positive picture of some of the church folk as people who seem to have it all together, and (2) the eerie feeling that the boy was often thinking and speaking like an adult.

It would serve well --perhaps too well-- as a basis for discussion in a small group, and the qualities which make it easy to discuss may be part of the reason why it is not completely successful as a work of art.

It's not one of the great films which draw me back again and again, but it is a fine and thoughtful piece of work, worth watching more than once and recommending to others.",1341014400,2,953,4.442528735632184

3991482,3,B002UNHFWG,"(This is not a review, but rather a critique.)

NGL is better acted than most Christian films--the leads did a credible job. And the story line of this little film had considerable potential: broken marriage, abandonment--a tragic backstory; reunion ten years later; the wife, now a christian, and husband deal with the challenge of being unequally yoked. However, there are two major problems which strike at the core of this film: Christian marriage/divorce and the gospel. I'll address each in turn:

Christian marriage/divorce: God does not honor divorce. In his eyes the divorced husband and wife are still married. SPOILER ALERT: It doesn't matter if the husband signed the divorce papers. The counseling pastor should know that God's laws trump man's laws. If the protagonist had ""legally"" divorced his wife, he could ""legally"" remarry her, if she has not been defiled (Deut 24:4). So, this is a completely artificial plot element. Further, in this case, where the wife is a christian and finds herself still married to a non-believing man, a Christian counselor should advise what Paul teaches in (1 Cor. 7:13,14) ""that the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife...: else were your children unclean, but now are they holy."" The 10-year-old son will also benefit.

The gospel: There was a lot of hemming and hawing, but no clear presentation of the gospel. Going to church, and attending Bible studies--these are the proper venues for equipping believers, not for evangelizing the lost. That's the job of each and every believer, to be ready to give an account to any man that asks a reason of the hope that is him with meakness and fear. (1 Peter 3:15). The following were conspicuously absent: Nothing about sin or the consequences of sin (Rom 3:23, Rom 6:23a); nothing about Christ's atonement for sin (Rom 5:8ff) (this would have explained the significance of the title ""NO GREATER LOVE""); nothing about what one must do to be saved (Act 16:30,31); and nothing about God's unspeakable gift (Rom 6:23b).

Who was this movie intended for: The believe or non-believer? So many missed opportunities. Some better writing could have integrated the gospel (or gospel elements) into the story line.",1331424000,6,2208,5.074380165289257

3991484,4,B002UNHFWG,"This review contains spoilers. The basic story is good but the pastor's character made me want to wipe the smile off his face; it was really irritating. (It was interesting to me, though, that his wife was very sensitive and I think she always gave good counsel.) I can't imagine a pastor saying the things this man said while smiling like that, even if he believed what he said was right. However, what he said was scripturally incorrect. The writer of this film had some things correct but even if a person is divorced and then becomes a Christian, if their spouse is not remarried and is willing to be reconciled, the word from the Bible is to be reconciled. For a Christian there is no marrying somebody else while your spouse is still alive. (Romans 7 makes that very clear.) But the ending of the film makes its message good because the unbeliever realizes he needs and wants what his wife has.",1326412800,6,900,4.52760736196319

3991487,2,B002UNHFWG,"This was a strange film. The basic premise is good. The life of single father Jeff, who's about to propose to his girlfriend, is turned upside down when suddenly he's reunited with his wife, Heather, who went missing ten years ago. Jeff and their son get to know her again and it looks like they may become a family again. But Heather is a changed woman; she's a Christian now, and that proves to be a challenge to their relationship. This is where the movie turns strange. This is clearly a Christian film, and yet the Christians in the film are anything but sympathetic. A very unpleasant pastor informs Jeff that a Christian cannot marry a non-Christian and therefore Heather and Jeff cannot remarry. (Minor spoiler in next paragraph) When it turns out they are still legally married because Jeff never signed the divorce papers, the church grudgingly agrees they can continue their marriage, which means Heather is ""supposed to submit to"" Jeff as the ""leader of the family"". (End of spoiler) Jeff's Christian friend David is the mouthpiece of much the film's message and he comes off as condescending, holier than thou and at times even rude.

The acting is good; Anthony Tyler Quinn especially delivers a very strong, emotional performance. Again, the basic story is interesting but the film as a whole seems confused. It clearly has a Christian message, yet the Christians in the film are for the most part unpleasant characters, which makes me wonder who the film is really supposed to appeal to.",1322092800,5,1503,4.825581395348837

3991489,2,B002UNHFWG,"I am not sure how to describe this movie.  No doubt, many Christians will enjoy this movie for the way ""true love"" and forgiveness is portrayed.  Indeed, the director highlights forgiveness as a core ingredient to the film, but is it?  Imagine, if you will, that your soul mate, your spouse, the mother/father of your child, suddenly disappears to leave you to raise your son.  Why?  According to the film, dad was too interested in his career - he missed the birth of his only child and at least one anniversary because of work.  Mom turns to alcohol and drugs and eventually leaves dad & son on their own.  Dad & son move to start a new life, dad meets a nice woman who cares about his son, but 10 years later, their paths meet again when mom suddenly appears at a church gathering.  Mom explains to dad that after she found God and cleaned up her act, she tried and tried to find them, but couldn't.  Hmmm...guess she's not too good with a computer.  Dad, no doubt an angel in disguise, wants to pick up where they left off.  It didn't appear he had too much anger, resentment, etc. after 1o years and says, ok, all is forgiven...let's be a family again.  The son takes mom back as mom without so much as a question as to where she has been and why.  So, dad dumps the girlfriend and dad, mom, son live happily ever after. Sorry, but I found it goofy and unrealistic.  The pastor in the movie has a grin you wish he would just put away.  Did you know, according to this pastor, Christians can't marry non-Christians, but if they're already married, it's OK?  But, it's OK to divorce.  Bottom line - I thought it was a sappy, idiotic movie, but hey, it's a religious film so it can't be all bad...can it?",1311811200,7,1706,4.331230283911672

Suddenly, the life both Jeff and Heather knew has changed. Heather disappears, not to be seen again for 10 years. In the meantime, Jeff is raising their son and has found someone new with whom to share his life.

What happens when Heather re-enters the picture? Numerous questions arise:  Will Jeff revert to his wedding vows of  ""till death do you part"" or will he hold on to the hurt that he faced when Heather chose to leave? And what about their son?

3991501,4,B002UNHFWG,"I found the movie uplifting and encouraging.  I thought that it really showed the true power of love, and I felt that it covered the doctrine of divorce very well.  I think the movie was recorded very nicely, and it seemed like good quality film.  One thing I see from watching many christian films is that they are poorly recorded; however, most have a great message.  This film was really top notch.  I also enjoyed seeing stars from Disney in this movie like the guy who played in Not Quite Human and the teacher from Boy Meets World.  I think it was a moving film but not the best that I have seen.  However, my father did cry according to my mom which in itself is a miracle. lol.

This is a spoiler comment upon the doctrine behind the movie so don't read if you really are interested in watching the movie.

I see that some people had a problem with the way that the marriage was treated in this movie.  I believe it was handled right.  The pastor thought that the couple was divorced.  Now, one was saved, and one was lost.  The husband wanted the wife back, but the wife felt she could not go back because then she would be unequally yoked with a sinner.  I think this is pretty Biblical.  Once the pastor found out that the divorce never went through.  Then, he encouraged the husband and wife to stay together which is also Biblical.  As long as the unbelieving spouse will strive with the believing spouse, then they are supposed to stick together.  I don't really see what problem people are finding with this.  It is straight up scripture.  The pastor thought that they had both divorced when they were unbelievers so requirements on avoiding divorce did not apply to them as non-believers.  I just really don't see what people are fussing about.  If you need the scriptures, I can give them to you if you comment on my review.  I am very schooled on this subject since I had to go through a divorce a couple years back at the request of my ex-wife.  Since then, I have read book after book analyzing the scriptures on divorce.  I have even studied the scriptures in greek and hebrew.  This was really sound doctrine.",1281398400,9,2131,4.427835051546392

3991506,2,B002UNHFWG,"This show started out very well, but ...

When Heather (the wife who left the protagonist, Jeff) is finally reunited with her husband, we find that her life has been transformed by God and that she has become a completely new person. She is sorry for what she did to her husband and her child by abandoning them and is desperate for their forgiveness and love.

Then, when Jeff decides that he can and does forgive her and loves her and wants her back, he is informed by her new Pastor that Christians can't marry non-Christians. And since this ""pastor"" could just ""tell"" that Jeff wasn't a Christian, there was no way that the pastor was going to let Jeff have his wife back!

Imagine this!!

It was at this point that I turned the movie off.

Here we see a redemption and reconciliation of a husband and a wife complete in every respect, except for another man standing in the way of this reconciliation: A man claiming to represent Jesus Christ!

""Nope, sorry Jeff. I don't think you're a Christian. Yeah, she might be your wife, and the mother of your child, but she listens to me now. Unless you join my church, I won't give her permission to come back to you.""

Please listen people: They were already married. They are married. In God's eyes, this never changed. She was this man's wife, the mother of his child. She begged forgiveness, he granted it. She repented of her sin, and God forgave her! Jeff deserved and needed to have his wife and child's mother back!! It would be God's will for them to join together again that very minute.

But no, this was not good enough. Some man in the name of Christ then puts a burden on Jeff and Heather that GOD did NOT place and this is completely wrong.

She was his wife and had the right, nay the *duty* to return to his grateful, needing arms.

1 Corinthians 7:13-14: ""If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he consents to live with her, she should not divorce him. For the unbelieving husband is made holy because of his wife, and the unbelieving wife is made holy because of her husband.""

I think that is pretty clear! Jeff more than consented to live with her, he begged her to! They were bound together under the law, as it says in verse 39: ""A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord.""

It also says: ""Wife, how do you know whether (you might not) save your husband?""

This is a clear implication from the Bible that the wife of an unbeliever is bound to him and ought to remain with him regardless of his spiritual condition because to do OTHERWISE is against the will and character of God.

This is not how God operates. He does not take your wife from you and then hold her hostage from you unless you ""become a Christian"".",1272153600,63,2797,4.333333333333333

3991512,4,B002UNHFWG,"Okay, I loved this movie there is only one thing I don't like about it. In the movie they said if they got divorced they could not be remarried because she could not be yoked with an unbeliever. At one time I would have agreed with that, except for our church did a series on divorce that made me think differently. You see, yes the bible says not to be yoked with an unbeliever and if they had never been married to each other before I would say she shouldn't marry him, but based on this scripture Matt 19:3 ""And Pharisees came up to him and tested him by asking, ""Is it lawful to divorce one's wife for any cause?"" 4 He answered, ""Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, 5 and said, `Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh'? 6 So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate."" 7 They said to him, ""Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away?"" 8 He said to them, ""Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. 9 And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery."" Now if you are divorced how can you commit adultery, I believe the answer is because moses allowed for divorce because of the hardness of hearts, but God doesn't allow for divorce. I believe once you are one, you are always one in God's eyes. God hates divorce weather or not you are a believer when it happened and the reason remarrying another is adultery (unfaithfulness) is because you are cheating on your true spouse. Also in 1 Corinthians 7:10-11 it says "" To the married I give this charge (not I, but the Lord): the wife should not separate from her husband (but if she does, she should remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband), and the husband should not divorce his wife."" If she divorces her husband she should be reconciled or reunited in some translations. My pastor who is also a professor at Moody says we should never take his word for it, but always check the scriptures. I loved this movie, I'm even going to buy it, but I feel that they misinterpreted scripture. I know a lot of people believe this, but I don't think it is right that if they were divorced, they could not reconcile because she is a believer now and he's not. The reason I even bother to write this is because if someone is out there that wants to be reconciled to their spouse who is not a believer and they are, or the other way around, I believe God would want you to be reconciled, I don't think you are divorced in His eyes. Now I could be wrong, but I strongly believe that is a correct interpretation. Don't take someone's word for it, even mine, study for yourself and pray.",1268438400,27,2901,4.305301645338209

Second, there is deception in not respecting an individual's or culture's beliefs especially when your subversive intent is to degrade or change those beliefs while holding your own beliefs as the divine & singular model of conduct.

My husband and I were given this movie to watch after we gave our own testimony of marriage reconciliation at a marriage retreat. The movie really touched our hearts and we could relate to it on many many levels.

UPDATE: We just saw this movie on the big screen and it is even more awesome!

My husband and I reconciled after 16 years of divorce. The emotions that ""Jeff"" and ""Heather"" and even the friends of Jeff and Heather are all right on. That is a lot of what my husband and I felt during the process. Sadly, most people (Christians included) do not know how to reconcile a marriage that has been broken. We were both told to move on, find someone else, ""she's never coming back"", etc. When God did bring us back into each other's lives and it was so obvious to us where God was leading us, there was still some confusion. But God's word in I Corinthian 7: 10-11 settled it for me: ""...let not the wife depart from her husband: but and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband.."" We felt as if we were still married in God's eyes as we hadn't remarried anyone else while we were apart. But we still got remarried again for legal reasons.

As a by product of her salvation, Heather is now able to love Jeff in a new way that she never could before. Heather has changed now that she is saved and her testimony makes Jeff want to be with her again. It also causes Jeff to want what Heather has: a relationship with Jesus Christ.

There are a couple of cheesy parts, and I thought the very last line was unecessary, not to mention a rip-off of a line in a immensely popular recent Christian movie.

3991525,5,B002UNHFWG,"Our family just finished watching NO GREATER LOVE.  WOW!  We have anxiously been awaiting its release and it was even better than we anticipated.  It is such a realistic, moving, genuine story of love, faith, loyalty, repentance, forgiveness and transformation.  It has provoked a wonderful discussion of many of the minor themes within the movie, as well as the major story line involving Jeff and Heather.  This film wonderfully demonstrates that the principles of God's Word are TRUE and broken marriages and broken families can be restored.  God IS sovereign! This is the message of HOPE and CHANGE that all America needs to see.  I can't wait to pass it around to every family we know, and I encourage everyone else to buy a copy and do the same.  I am already looking forward to the producers' next movie - Heartbook!",1264118400,5,823,4.787234042553192
3991526,5,B002UNHFWG,"A powerful story of love and forgiveness!  You will be engulfed in this story of a family torn apart by problems that we see in society every day - a man consumed in work and a wife that can't handle the pressures of being a ""single"" married woman.

There is no greater love than the love of Jesus Christ. As God gives this family a second chance, you'll laugh, you'll cry but most of all be challenged to pursue that love in your own life.

Well-scripted, Excellent Casting, Dynamic Score.",1264118400,4,490,4.4222222222222225

3991528,5,B002UNHFWG,"No Greater Love is a powerful movie that really portrays the power of love and forgiveness that God has available for all of us. Anthony Tyler Quinn plays Jeff the abandoned father whose wife Heather walked out on him after falling into a deep depression. Jeff is then left to raise his son on his own. 10 years have passed while Jeff has found a new love in which he seriously considers asking her hand in marriage. Even his son Ethan is accepting of his father's decision and gives his father his own advice as to ""Go for it!!"" During this time, Ethan has been invited to his friend's church for a summer ""Kid's Fest."" Little did Jeff and Ethan know, that Heather, who vanished 10 years before would be standing before them as a member of this very church. As the movie goes on, Ethan is able to see his own mother and even talks to her without realizing who she really is. (Both she and Ethan make a realization that they both love the same kind of pizza.) It turns out that Jeff suddenly realizes that his wife who left him so long ago was back into his life. After awhile, both Jeff and Heather have a tearful but extremely heartwarming reunion in a park, which was just the beginning of an amazing miracle, that only the love of Jesus Christ could create. This movie also shows the reunion of Heather and her son Ethan which also will bring you to tears and realize that God can and will mend a broken heart. While Jeff then has some struggles in many hard decisions to make after he finds Heather again after 10 years, it turns out that God was the One who made it all happen and it was actually His plan to have Jeff and Heather mend their broken marriage. This movie can be for anyone. Even if you aren't married or even never experienced a divorce, this movie will touch your heart. It will show you how God loves us all and how the Lord has given the power of love and forgiveness to everyone if we just believe, and trust the Lord for everything in our lives. It will show you how good God really is and how the Lord wants nothing but the very best in our lives. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I'd really recommend you getting the DVD. It will really touch your heart, and even bring you closer to your Heavenly Father.",1264118400,5,2236,4.288416075650118
3991529,5,B002UNHFWG,The depth of the story prompted many discussions and caused me to examine my own marriage.  My wife and I are more thankful for the love we have for each other and are more committed to honoring God with our marriage than ever before -- all because of the time we enjoyed watching this movie!,1264118400,2,292,4.3090909090909095
3991530,5,B002UNHFWG,One of the best films I've seen in a long time.  An excellent view of what true love is.  Don't think you have to be old to enjoy it.  Our 9 year old has watched it several times and loves it.  It was so refreshing to see a couple who sticks it out and beats the odds instead of giving up and calling it quits.  There is too much of that sort of thing these days and frankly the entertainment industry usually makes light of it and almost glamorizes it.  The actors do an awesome job of making their rolls real and believable.  Their passion for the message being presented is apparent from the first scene.  An excellent movie regardless of where you are with your walk.,1264118400,2,671,4.228346456692913

8381324,5,B002UNHFWG,"The power of family cannot be underestimated, nor can we fathom the love of God or His ability to change hearts and heal. No one is beyond His reach.

Wonderful love story that conveys those life awakenings we experience as we grow, sometimes as a natural part of a spiritual Christ-filled life and sometimes as a part of life where we don't recognize His love and presence. Heavenly Father has a way of shaking things up and if we let Him in, we become more aware just how He is in the details of our lives and how much He loves us individually. No matter where we fall in our spiritual growth - true discipleship with Christ is all about repentance and change. That process is humbling yet profoundly powerful, and helps us begin to know God.

This movie seemed to be a metaphor of Gods love for us, no matter how we wander from Him, He remembers, He loves, and never gives up on us returning to the family of God.  With Christ we can change and be reconciled to the family of God. We can come to know we are deeply loved and have great worth.",1508371200,,1045,4.267676767676767
