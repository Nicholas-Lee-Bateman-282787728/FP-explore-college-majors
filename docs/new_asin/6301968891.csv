406045,2,6301968891,"Judging from the other reviews--all of them laudatory--I know I'm cruising for a bruising for what I'm about to write. But my honest opinion is that Edmund Goulding's ""The Great Lie"" has dated dreadfully in the seven decades since its release, far more so than most films of its era.

I expected to at least like this movie, because I love both Bette Davis and Mary Astor. (Astor's performance--for which she won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar--is to my mind the only good reason to see the film today.) But the various plot developments in ""The Great Lie"" struck me as neither believable nor interesting. Davis was never at her best when she portrayed undilutedly noble characters, and her supposedly noble Maggie Van Allen was to my mind insufferable. Similarly, George Brent--surely one of the dullest leading men ever--struck me as the opposite of desirable. Only Astor's selfish, hysterical Sandra Kovack--a concert pianist with infinite talent for music but none at all for life or love--came fully to life for me.

As for the way African-Americans are portrayed in this movie, I will be kind and say merely that ""The Great Lie"" makes ""Gone with the Wind"" look enlightened. Hattie McDaniel's presence makes the comparison inevitable, and ""The Great Lie"" only increases my sympathy for a fine actress who was a victim of her times.

This DVD includes a ""Warner's Night Out at the Movies"" feature that includes various short subjects which might have accompanied ""The Great Lie"" when it was first released. The short subjects include a short B-grade crime drama, ""At the Stroke of Twelve,"" which I actually found more interesting than ""The Great Lie."" They also include the first-ever Looney Tunes cartoon that I actually found depressing. Nuf sed.",1334102400,3,1753,4.9965753424657535
406046,5,6301968891,"Davis is at her self-sacrificing best! Outspoken with her opinions,she drives her ""fiance"" into the arms of another woman.  Twists, turns, near tragedy, deals, and lies.

406124,4,6301968891,"At her country home, Maggie Van Allen (Bette Davis) is waited on hand and foot by Jefferson and Violet, two kindly black servants who do for her.  Watching the movie, one becomes gradually aware of how vast Maggie's farm is: it's so big that she claims there are whole rooms she's never seen.  In one scene she pulls a bellcord and it falls down from the ceiling, and she laughs. since this proves that it hasn't been used in a long, long time.  During a wedding scene you see Violet and Jefferson approach a large iced cake and carefully it outside into a whole from yard filled with jubilant black well-wishers, singing and harmonizing in gospel cadences.  Do they all work for Maggie?  There must be thirty or forty of them.  Maybe they're neighbors drawn to Maggie's farm for the festivities.  ""Nice music,"" speculates George Brent.  ""Yes,"" murmurs Bette Davis.  Later  it's revealed that Maggie's farm is twenty acres, but it seems enormous like San Simeon.  It's big enough for George Brent to use a side field as a runway for his plane.  I wonder what the point is to this slow buildup of Bette Davis as perhaps the richest woman in Maryland.  At first it seems she lives humbly, so we feel she's the underdog in her personal war against Mary Astor, who lives the wild, Lindsay Lohan playgirl lifestyle in a giant hotel suite in Manhattan.  It comes as a thunderbolt when Davis makes Astor an offer she can't financially refuse--until that moment, you'd never guess that Astor was suffering for money!

The only way you might possibly guess is that Davis' exquisite clothes are a considerable notch above Mary Astor's.  Astor favors tight, tight, playgirl jumpsuits flecked with bugle beads and glitter, like an Easter basket.  For her big scene at the end, she wears what looks like a Mao jacket and pants from the early 1970s.  She doesn't look awful, it's just that her wardrobe looks like it cost about 50 cents.  Well, there's one beautiful gown she wears for her Philadelphia piano recital.  She's got a meaty, meaty role here and she does everything she can with it, considering she's often missing from the action the script dictates.  The script is pretty shallow, but it's a rare movie that concentrates on the rivalry, then the alliance, between two strong women, and their scenes together are grand.  Davis must have been tiny--I never realized that until watching The Great Lie.  Next to George Brent (who tells her, ""You've shrunk"") or buried in Hattie McDaniel's arms, she's like a Bette Davis doll of herself.",1268697600,2,2532,4.74370709382151

406127,4,6301968891,"Bette Davis and Mary Astor duel splendidly in the 1941 melodrama THE GREAT LIE, based on a book by Polan Banks.  Mild-mannered Maggie Van Allen (Davis) and flamboyant concert pianist Sandra Kovak (Astor) strike a desperate bargain when Maggie's husband Peter (George Brent)--who was also briefly married to Sandra--dies in an aeroplane accident.  But Maggie's deception comes back to haunt her when Peter makes a miraculous return from the grave...

To some extent it's a re-tread of material that Davis had previously played in ""The Old Maid"", but THE GREAT LIE is notable for it's searing, Oscar-winning performance from Mary Astor as Sandra.  Davis had personally recommended Astor for the role, aware that she had in fact studied piano and could convincingly pull off the scenes in which Sandra performs her various concertos.  The one thing that Davis hated was Lenore Coffee's script (""It's soap opera drivel and it stinks in all departments!"" she complained); so she enlisted Astor's help in re-tooling some of the scenes between the two women.  Much of what they did on the screen was quite skillfully improvised, and the director Edmund Goulding was delighted with the resulting performances.

Of course, rumours flew that Davis was increasingly jealous that Mary Astor was stealing the entire film away from her, but Astor demurred, instead saying ""She handed THE GREAT LIE to me on a silver platter"".  The movie showcases both ladies to their full advantage, and Davis never had a cause to worry.  Davis and Astor continued a friendship right up until Astor's death; indeed, Davis pulled Astor out of retirement to play a small but very important role in the 1964 thriller ""Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte"".

The DVD of THE GREAT LIE is only available as part of Warner's third Bette Davis boxset, which also boasts ""The Old Maid"", ""Watch on the Rhine"", ""All This, and Heaven Too"", ""Deception"" and ""In This Our Life"".",1246060800,2,1925,5.044164037854889
406128,5,6301968891,"THE GREAT LIE is really Bette Davis at her finest. She and George Brent always seemed to make magic on film and a chemistry that is so intense the audience can't help but feel, and they didn't fail us with ""The Great Lie"". Bette Davis and fellow star Mary Astor work off of each other in a glorious way and keep you enjoying both characters and wanting to see ""just how much can you rely on a promise from a woman who loves the same man you do"". They make you laugh, they make you cry, they make you furious...they are AMAZING in this film.
As a side note, Mary Astor respected Bette Davis' work so much, when they made ""Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte"", even though Astor had a rather small (but very important) part in the movie and not even a scene together with Davis, she wanted Davis on the set because she respected her opinion so much! So check out ""The Great Lie"", it won't disappoint.",1238976000,4,888,4.291666666666667
406129,4,6301968891,"Bette Davis, Mary Astor, a love triangle, a child born out of wedlock, lots of great production values... what's not to be engrossed about? And I'm saying this as a guy who's really not the primary audience for this quintessential ""women's picture"".

""The Great Lie"" on DVD features a sharp picture and good sound, and a variety of extra features.  The bonus materials are not so much ""behind the scenes"" pieces about the main feature, but rather short subjects that movie-goers may have been exposed to if they went to see ""The Great Lie"" in theaters back in 1941.  All were interesting in varying degrees except for the newsreel footage of a banquet of some kind, which featured no sound.  One wonders why they included it here.

In any event, pick up this DVD for the good story and powerful character interaction between Ms. Davis and Ms. Astor during the movie itself. Everything else is just a minor bonus.",1227571200,16,912,4.710691823899371
406130,5,6301968891,"The Great Lie is a slick, classic ""women's picture"" which Warners were very much the specialists at by the early 40's.

Mary Astor is the perfect self indulgent, spoiled, and tempestuous concert pianist opposite Davis' more subdued character. The scenes between her and Davis are most enjoyable with fur flying exquisitely in certain scenes. Nice to see an artist with the talent and versatitlity to match Davis. Very much a Davis picture with Brent who is cast perfectly opposite Davis. He was a very versatile leading man at Warners opposite strong leading ladies such as Davis - they appeared many times together.

This film was produced at the height of Davis' powers and the handsome production values and sets show this. Topped off by another of Max Steiner's rich scores that make this unmistakably a Warners top production.",1221177600,13,831,5.0144927536231885
406131,5,6301968891,"This is one of my favorite classic movies.  I watch it over and over, and I never get tired of the story.  Mary Astor certainly deserved her Oscar nod for this!  Some of the best scenes are of these two formidable ladies and how they cat fight it out.  Bette is awesome and you really see why she is such an acting talent.  George Brent is great too, but the ladies fold the movie up and put it in their pocket.  You won't regret buying this one.  It's a keeper!",1216512000,13,462,4.066666666666666
406132,4,6301968891,"""The Great Lie"" is a second rate Bette Davis vehicle released in 1941 when she was at the height of her career. The merits of the film include:

- a charming performance by a natural Davis with a particularly warm and convincing relationship with leading man George Brent with whom Davis had great personal rapport
- a vibrant Oscar winning performance from a striking Mary Astor as Davis's rival
- great production values, with lush photography, sets and musical score.

The drawback, however, which almost sinks the film, is the sappy story which Davis and Astor tried to spice up with their own intervention on the script. The story simply is not worthy of the superlative treatment it is given.

The DVD contains an excellent print and a comprehensive set of dull extras from the Warner Brothers vaults. The newsreel, minus soundtrack, shows candid shots of famous people at Ciro's, a popular LA nightclub. It is fairly dumb. There is a short film based on a Damon Runyan story, a neat little thriller about a thug reformed by an elderly lady. There are 2 more, one about polo, the other about horse racing. Warner's were masters at recycling their product and ""Polo with the Stars"" combines documentary with excerpts from ""The Little Giant"" starring Edward G Robinson and ""Polo Joe"" starring Joe E Brown. The cartoon is amusing as Porky Pig is bombarded by a dog looking for a home. Two trailers are included - for ""The Great Lie"" itself which clearly aims the film at the women in the audience and ""Strawberry Blonde"" a rollicking Jimmy Cagney nostalgia fest from the same year.

The whole package is certainly comprehensive even if most of it is second rate. Therefore the DVD is good value but better if purchased as part of the Bette Davis Collection Volume 3.",1213920000,,1769,4.752442996742671
406133,4,6301968891,"By the time Bette Davis made THE GREAT LIE in 1941, she had already established herself as one of Hollywood's most formidable actresses whose edgy style of dramatics made her the logical choice to play Maggie, a wealthy woman who passes off another woman's baby as her own.  The plot is pure melodrama, of course, but it is not for that which stamps this movie as a near great.  Once the audience gets past the logical improbabilities of the coincidences needed to make one scene lead to the next, what causes that audience to remain fixed on the unfolding events is the titanic clash between Bette Davis and Mary Astor (Sandra).  And caught in the middle is George Brent, who first marries Sandra (Astor), gets her pregnant, flies off to the Amazon, crashes his plane, and remains off screen for the middle part of the movie.  Brent is Pete the aviator who recreates his essential screen persona of blandness, which does not allow him to seriously challenge his leading ladies as the dramatic center.  He and Miss Davis had similar parts in DARK VICTORY where he merely acted as a celluloid echo chamber for Davis to vent steam.  Here, he does much the same, but this time he vacillates between Davis and Astor, both of whom see him as far more interesting than does the audience.

It is the onscreen duel between Maggie and Sandra that keeps the audience thoroughly rooted in the seats.  From the moment that they agree to allow Maggie to raise Sandra's child as her own, the audience can sense Hollywood's Golden Rule # 1: any such agreement must wind up in catastrophe.  When Pete magically reappears in both their lives, Maggie and Sandra trade sarcasms and catty remarks.  But lurking beneath this all is the fear that both share--that they will lose both man and child that they thought they had, then could lose. Mary Astor plays Sandra first as a chronic drunk then as one who is fiercely determined to claim her own.  Miss Davis had the more difficult task of portraying Maggie as one who walks a fine line between being equally determined but not coming off as a heartless schemer.  By the time the film ends, director Edmund Goulding presents a too pat ending that suggests that one of the female leads can overcome her ego to enter the realm of magnanimity.  Yet, it is the slow growth of personal vision of both women that permits audiences to remain entranced even decades later as to who will give in first.  Few films exhibit such relentless probing of female primordial urgings as well as this one and that is why I call THE GREAT LIE a near great film.",1210464000,2,2571,4.609649122807017
406204,5,6301968891,"Why isn't this classic soap on DVD? The movie as originally written was ""lousy"" in Davis and Astor's words and both worked on the screenplay without credit. Davis is the good girl and Astor the bad. She was the more interesting role. Many say she stole the film which Astor refuted in her memoirs--the formitable Davis let her have the movie and a good thing. As brilliant as Astor always is, this is her finest performance and her Oscar was well-deserved. She's a tempermental concert pianist (and an accomplished one in her on right), round-heeled, spoiled, childish and perfectly wonderful. The sarcastic jabs between the two stars raise this above the suds to Grade A soap. A fine tearjerker. The plot has been reviewed and Astor who was always at her best doing character work cannot be equalled--this role would have been perfect for Davis but she would not have been as effective. Astor who later was typecast as the perfect mother, did not renew her lucrative MGM contract after spending years in this role which she so perfectly created as Judy Garland's mother in the classic ""Meet Me In St. Louis"" and by 1949 after playing ""Marmee"" in the sluggish remake of ""Little Women"" she left films for stage and television work appearing in movies too infrequently and usually as an overly doting mother. She was known in Hollywood when it came to casting ""Get me a Mary Astor type"", ""We need a Mary Astor"" and ""Who is Mary Astor?"". Fame knows no bounds. She later became a successful writer of two autobiographies including on her famous relationship with George S. Kauffman, her alcholism and her famous ""Purple Diary"" that the courts finally burned in 1952. She led a colorful life and her last cameo in 1965's ""Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte"" reunited her with friend and admirer Davis (although they did not share any scenes together), Davis on Astor's first day of work, told everyone to be be quiet and learn from a professional at work.

This is a fine movie worthy of preservation. Again, where is the DVD Warner Brothers?",1188518400,,2030,4.767045454545454

A gentleman lives his own affective crossroad: his actual wife (Mary Astor) is a consummated and renowned pianist, but simply the marriage does not work out, he has an ambitious mistress that pushes on him to divorce.

The dramatic nucleus will unfold since her ex wife is pregnant and he disappeares between the Amazon jungle.

406206,5,6301968891,"The Great Lie is an excellent melodrama with a wonderful cast. The story revolves around Peter (George Brent), Sandra (Mary Astor), and Maggie (Bette Davis), who are involved in a love triangle. We learn that Peter and Sandra have married on drunken impulse, but they are not legally married because Sandra's divorce from her previous husband is not final. Peter suddenly finds himself questioning whether he actually wants to have Sandra as his wife, as he's been chasing country girl Maggie for years. He goes to see her and decides that it is she that he wants to be with. The two marry and Sandra's jealousy poses a problem. She claims to Maggie that she was pregnant with Peter's child.

The acting is wonderful, especially by Bette Davis, whose emotions outwardly register quickly but not too overtly. Mary Astor is less likable in her arch-enemy type role, but she serves her purpose as the selfish rival. Brent's role is less demanding; he is a straight character and supplies the necessary believability for the role. Hattie McDaniel, who plays the maid Violet, has a decent part which allows her to be a matronly figure. She is lovable and sweet.

The story is filled with twists and turns in this elegant soap-opera-like extravaganza.",1127865600,4,1245,4.895734597156398
406207,4,6301968891,"Reading the recent biography of Edmund Goulding inspired me to see as many of his films as I can.  During 30 Days of Oscar on Turner, they showed THE GREAT LIE which I have not seen in probably over three years.  Age has not slowed it down much.  For many moderns, it's hard to understand the box office appeal of a man like George Brent.  (I put to one side the somewhat different reasons why we might be excused from wondering how Bette Davis and Mary Astor ever became stars.)  Brent plays a horndog in THE GREAT LIE who marries Mary Astor while he's drunk, and then lives to regret it once he realizes his ""true"" love is for Bette Davis, who happens to be Astor's friend.  See, it's a sordid little story, raised to true heights of elevation when Astor announces she's pregnant with Brent's baby and then Brent's plane goes down into the Amazon!

Thinking he's dead, Astor panics and with the baby's best interests at heart, Davis offers to bring up the baby as her own.  It's funny how in this film Astor plays the hard-hearted playgirl (a variation on her Brigid Shaughnessy role in THE MALTESE FALCON) while Bette Davis does surprisingly well as the ""nice girl"" from down South, when in truth she could have played the other part very well.

Hattie McDaniel is also in this movie--one of her better parts, though really they're all the same, however in this film both Astor and Davis treat her almost as if she was an equal, it's rather refreshing.  And Hattie's brother, Sam, is in the movie too, it's always twice the fun when this talented pair of siblings got to co-star.

There's lots and lots of music, as befits a Goulding film, for Sandra (Mary Astor) is supposed to be a concert pianist and actually looks as though she's playing some of the passages.  Did you know Goulding wrote most of the music for most of the films he directed?  His talents knew no bounds.",1110240000,4,1878,4.488235294117647
406208,4,6301968891,"George Brent is having a hard time managing the women in his life.  He spends years in love with Bette Davis, but she won't marry him because he isn't ready to settle down.  He marries fiery concert pianist Mary Astor, only to discover her divorce from her first husband isn't finalized.  When she won't bend to his will, he goes back to Davis and marries her, only to disappear in the Brazilian jungle, leaving behind a broken-hearted Davis and a pregnant Astor.  The story behind The Great Lie is, needless to say, a bit farfetched.  It relies a lot on the viewer suspending their disbelief.  What really keeps this film moving is the sparring between Davis and Astor.  I've always enjoyed and appreciated Mary Astor, and in this film she's given a character right up her alley.  She sinks into the roll, throwing out her lines with obvious relish and taking control of every scene she's in.  Davis is good in a quieter performance, letting Astor have the spotlight.  Brent is his usual self, and Hattie McDaniel is given more dialogue and character to work with than her standard maid role, and she is very strong.  The music is a bit overpowering and over the top, but then again, so is the whole scenario of the story.  The strength of this melodrama is Mary Astor in one of her best performances.  The film is never believable, but she makes it fun to watch.",1041206400,7,1364,4.563786008230453
406209,5,6301968891,"This 1941 film release is a superlative melodrama with a classic cast. The stellar ensemble of Bette Davis, George Brent, Mary Astor, Hattie McDaniel, and Lucille Watson lights up the screen in this story of true love. It is Mary Astor, however, who sends it soaring and leaves little doubt as to why she won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.
Mary Astor plays the role of Sandra, a temperamental concert pianist, who marries Peter (George Brent), the on again, off again beau of Sandra's rival, Maggie (Bette Davis). They get married while Peter is in an alcoholic stupor in New York. After spending the night together, it turns out that their marriage was not legal, as Sandra's divorce from her first husband was not final. When Sandra is faced with the choice of marrying him on the day the divorce is final or playing a concert, she makes a choice that leaves Peter free to marry Maggie.
Shortly after their marriage, Peter, an experienced aviator and cartographer, is called away on a governmental mission. In the interim, Sandra tells Maggie that she is carrying Peter's child and vows to use that fact to get him back. Peter's plane, however, is reported missing over a remote area of the Amazon jungle, and he is presumed dead. This, of course, throws a monkey wrench into Sandra's plans, as she does not want the baby without Peter. Maggie, who is not pregnant and has no hope now of ever having a child by Peter, strikes a deal with Sandra that will allow Maggie to pass off Sandra's and Peter's baby, as if it were hers and Peter's. It is like making a pact with the devil, as Maggie will soon find out.
This is an enormously entertaining film with great dialogue between the two protagonists, Sandra and Maggie. Ms. Astor does a decided star turn as the temperamental and  brilliant, world acclaimed concert pianist. Ms. Astor plays her as a diva of the first order, and she deservedly won an Academy Award for her performance. The role of Maggie, who is the good girl from the south, has its moments in the hands of such an accomplished actress as Ms. Davis. The dialogue between the two is always crisp and interesting. George Brent is perfectly cast in the role of Peter, a wealthy chap who is desired by two gloriously different women. Lucille Watson has a small part as Maggie's aunt, and Hattie McDaniel plays Maggie's ever present mammy. The film is topped of by the powerful music of Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto.
This is a film that lovers of classic melodramas will enjoy, as will lovers of classical music.",1011484800,39,2533,4.666666666666667
406210,5,6301968891,"Nothing more to add except that two of my favorite scenes are when Mary Astor loses it in the desert, she starts screaming and Bette Davis (looking beautiful in that sweater) promptly slaps her TWICE.

406212,4,6301968891,"After her great triumph in a bravura role as the murderess in THE LETTER, Bette Davis decided she would portray a sympathic heroine in her next picture, THE GREAT LIE. The plot is admittedly soap opera, but director  Edmund Goulding stages it with style, and the basically artificial,  contrived story comes across with surprising believability. Davis play her  role with great sincerity and Astor's performance a Sandra, the bitchy  concert pianist is a personal triumph. She is beautiful and authoritive and  offers a stunning portrayal of a temperamental musical artist; she entirely  deserved her best supporting actress AA.  An accomplished pianist in real  life, Astor played Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto  brilliantly and the  realism adds much to the picture as a whole. The film revived a renewed  interest in Tchaikovsky's haunting melody and it again swept the country  via radio broadcasts and records galore.",945820800,5,920,5.356643356643357
406213,4,6301968891,"Although the storyline is somewhat contrived and artificial, the acting in this 1941 film is excellent.  Bette Davis plays the sweetly sincere Maggie and Mary Astor won an AA (best supporting actress) for her exquisite playing of the bitchy concert pianist Sandra. They both love the same man (George Brent) and there is a baby involved which complicates matters considerably (the Great Lie of the title).  Astor really gives her role dimension as the brittle, bitchy and essentially selfish Sandra Van Allen: she entirely deserved her prize.  Bette is quite young looking and she's attractive and her playing is, as usual, excellent (she plays a nice, noble woman in this one). Mary Astor's short, mannish haircut became all the rage with women for a time after seeing this soap opera par excellence.",944438400,2,801,5.053030303030303
