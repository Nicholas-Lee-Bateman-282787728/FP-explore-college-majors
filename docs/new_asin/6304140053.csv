I could never find this movie at any local store so I just decided to buy it on amazon(it just arrived and I just finished watching it).This movie is excellent, many twists and turns, fine acting by Chris Reeve(R.I.P Superman)and the rest of the cast. Also, like I said before it features a very cool ending...kinda chilling...check it out!",1098144000,6,431,4.468354430379747
800811,4,6304140053,"When a police detective (Christopher Reeve) got shot and he becomes crippled from a bust gone bad. He fined to a wheelchair and clinically depressed. When his unfaithful wife (Kim Cattrall) Cheats on him with his brother (Edward Kerr), when he finds out, he goes on a revenge and everything are not as they seem to the Ex-Police Detective.
Sharply directed by Steven Schachter but the real winner goes to Screenwriters: Jerry Lazarus, William H. Macy (Boogie Nights, Jurassic Park 3) and Steven Schachter. Also actor Joe Mantegna gives a fine performance. Made for Television from the Home Box Office (HBO) Network. Grade:A-.",1010102400,23,625,5.077669902912621
800812,4,6304140053,"I liked director Steven Schachter's TV movie ""The Con"" very much so when this movie was on TV, I decided to see if it was as good as that one. It was. It's about Dempsey, a policeman, who gets shot and, as a result of this, paralyzed in his legs. He gets depressed and the fact that his wife and his brother have an affair doesn't make things better (it's sad and ironic that Christopher Reeve actually got paralyzed not long after this movie was finished).
The movie has a good story, I won't tell you too much and spoil it for you, and all of the actors are very good. The movie was co-written by William H. Macy who also appears in a small part (he also co-wrote ""The Con""). It works well both as a good thriller and as a drama. Enjoy!",995760000,6,738,4.131944444444445
800813,5,6304140053,"ABOVE SUSPICION is a good film. I give five ***** to the main characters including Reeve, Joe Mantegna, and Kim Cattrall. Ms Cattrall proves that nudity properly employed serves to contribute to the plot rather than distract you from it. Mantegna has to handle the old cliche role: ""I'm a better cop than college-trained Christopher because I'm a street cop.""  He does a top drawer job of keeping the ""street cop"" role on balance.  I thoroughly enjoy a movie when the writing is good.  In ABOVE SUSPCION the writing was good . . . super . . . the very best suspense entertainment. It was the best suspense movie that I've seen in years. You might find--as I did--that you'll be rooting at one time or another  for all of the characters along the way.",987465600,13,750,4.533333333333333

801052,5,6304140053,"I caught this on TV in 1995 and it's always stuck with me. Initially it was because the next day I read that Christopher Reeve was left paralyzed after a horrible horse riding accident which would eventually cost him his life.

""Above Suspicion"" is a first rate thriller that is very well written and acted. The script has a few twists up it's sleeve but on closer inspection it's more layered than intially perceived. I've been watching this movie with regular intervals for close to twenty years and my assessment of it's characters has changed drastically in that time.

Dempsey Cain (Reeve) is a dedicated and highly intelligent cop on the rise who's always looking out for his kid brother Nick (Edward Kerr) who's also on the force. Nick is having an affair with Dempsey's wife Gail (Kim Cattrall) and there's also a fellow cop, Alan,(Joe Mantegna) who's displeased at how much Dempsey is impressing the top brass with his investigation skills.

During a drug bust Dempsey gets shot and is left paralyzed below the waist. Understandably he is having a hard time adjusting to his new condition and seems to sink fast into depression. Gail and Nick continue their affair and both of them have their own problems (particularly Gail) with the whole situation. One night Dempsey asks them to do him a favour; he wants them to end his life so he can secure his and Gail's son's financial future and end his torment of living like this.

By this time ""Above Suspicion"" is barely halfway through it's running time and the plot thickens (and a spoiler filled synopsis will appear below).

Dempsey one-ups Gail and Nick and kills them both as he's known of their affair and is disgusted with his wife and sorely disappointed in his brother after everything he's done for him. Furthermore; shortly before shooting Nick he rises from his chair to demonstrate the level of his own deception.

Fellow cops buy into Dempsey's story that the pair were out to kill him but Alan smells something rotten. Alan pursues the matter all the way and manages to drag Dempsey into court where he's eventually found not guilty and remains free. Taking a last stab at proving he's right; Alan chances to prove that Dempsey is faking paralysis with disastrous results.

Upon first viewing I rooted for Dempsey and was glad he got away with it. I viewed Gail and Nick as repellent characters and Alan as a jelous S.O.B. who got what he deserved for not leaving well enough alone. But as the years go by (and hopefully some maturing) I've changed my assessment of the film and it's ending. For one thing; Gail and Nick aren't repellent individuals as much as simply flawed human beings. Nick is living in the shadow of his over-achieving brother and has mostly failed at everything he's attempted in his life. Viewing Dempsey's genuine love for him as hand-outs and reminders of his own failures; one can understand his resentment (while not justified). Gail seems to be a caring mother with a successful working career who's lost her passion for Dempsey but is probably afraid to leave him as she clearly knows what a good person he is but she, too, seems to resent his success in everything. And then there's Alan; in most movies these rogue cops who defy everyone else and go after the guilty party with a vengeance come up victorious but in this case he's simply up against such a resilient and clever foe that he comes up short. Now I admire Alan's bravery of following through on what he just knows he's right about; too bad it costs him just about everything.

I mentioned the layered aspects of the story; not just the characters. Dempsey is indeed a clever planner as he mentions to Gail and Nick to abort the plan if anything (he repeats; ""anything"") goes wrong. When Nick goes about securing a fake ID he clashes with the thug when he doesn't bring enough cash. Dempsey told Nick how much cash to bring knowing full well that it wouldn't be enough and the only way to come out with an ID would be with an incident; as one does occur. Gail convinces Nick to proceed with the plan anyway and that's probably when Dempsey's final judgement is clear in his head.

I really like this movie. It's stuck with me all these years and I enjoyed revisiting it recently. Christopher Reeve gives an excellent performance as Dempsey and demonstrates here how capable an actor he was when given good roles. Joe Mantegna and Kim Cattrall give solid support but I feel Edward Kerr is a little out of his depth here; not terrible but not very good. As said; the script is first rate but if pressed to name something negative it would concern the overly fast forward nature of the courtroom scenes; they could easily have had more time to breathe and a longer running time wouldn't have hurt.

Highly recommended.",1414540800,7,4779,4.665083135391924

801119,5,6304140053,"The movie involves Dempsey( Christopher Reeves), an intelligent, up to date detective who from beginning is getting under the  collar of fellow detective Alan ( Joe Montaga )who appears somewhat jealous of Demps abilities and accomplishments on the job. Demps doesn't show a lot of emotion but is aware that his brother Nick and his wife Gail( Kim Cattrall ) are having an affair. Quite a bit as the movie implies.
  Demps gets shot by a gunman hiding in a pile of clothes that his brother Nick had purposely overlooked. Demps gets shot and is found to be paralyzed from the waist down. He tells Nick and Gail he wants to die and sets up an elaborate plan which is really one to end the affair.
  Also, a case comes up that Alan becomes obsessed with just knowing that Demps is not even paralyzed. Alan's obsession doesn't bode well when dealing with such an intelligent rival.

801239,5,6304140053,"Very rare DVD of a Christopher Reeve movie that is not often seen on TV and hard to find in general.

801243,4,6304140053,"This is a pretty interesting crime movie that has been overshadowed by the irony of it: Christopher Reeve playing a man in a wheelchair, and he himself being paralyzed not long after this movie.

This story concerns a cop who gets paralyzed and then gets revenge on his wife and brother, both of whom were having an affair behind his back which he knew about. Joe Mantegna's role, I thought, was the best, as the pursuing cop on the case, although Reeve is very good, too. Kim Cattrall's garbage-mouth helps make her a convincing villain as the cheating wife.

There is one major credibility problem, however, with this film that might have you shaking your head. You'll have to check to movie to know what I mean, because I don't want to spoil it here. The film is a worth a look, however - definitely recommended. It will have you involved.",1247443200,,842,4.569536423841059
801244,4,6304140053,"A man and his wife lived on a farm. They were having financial troubles and one day the man went up to his wife.

He touched her b/reast\s and said, ""If I could get milk out of these, I could get rid of the cow.""

He then touched her between her l/eg\s and said, ""If we could get eggs out of this, I could get rid of the chickens.""

The wife then grabbed her husband's p/en\is and said, ""If I could get h/ar\d out of this, I could get rid of your brother.""

That's as close of a joke I could find to go with the film. It's pretty interesting, but still a ""B"" movie.

Christopher Reeve is a cop who gets shot and becomes paralized. He has a lusty wife who begins an affair with his flunkie brother who Reeve's character always calls ""a f@#k up."" But he cares about the ""f$%k up.""

I sided with Joe Mantegna throughout the whole movie because Reeve was just evil in my opinion. What kind of ego does a man have to have in order to kill two people he claims to love because they betrayed him. ""You betrayed me, therefore you no longer deserve to live."" I don't understand that mentality.

Still, it's a suspenseful and good psychological drama.",1160697600,2,1141,4.206422018348624
801245,3,6304140053,"What I find most interesting about this story is that it gives a virtual prediction in film of what happens in reality to Christopher Reeves' life.

Reeves' character, Dempsey, is a police officer who gets shot in a crime bust early in the film. This leaves him a paraplegic, confined to a wheelchair, and unable to use his lower body. He subsequently becomes depressed and suicidal. Does this ring a bell for anyone else here?

I was surprised the reviews I read below didn't mention the uncanny coincidence in the screenplay written five years before Reeve's tragic accident that left him a quadriplegic, a disability Christopher Reeves never recovered from and to which he finally succumbed.",1112572800,6,694,4.974137931034483
