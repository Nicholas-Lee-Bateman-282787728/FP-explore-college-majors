8210312,1,B000TQ9SIU,"Every great director is allowed one honest to goodness turkey, and this is it for Almodovar.  A tasteless, pointless, trashy satire of Iran's royal family (remember Soraya?  She's called Seraya in the movie), complete with look alike actors and actresses, goes nowhere and amounts to a great deal of sound and fury signifying nothing. A very young Antonio Banderas provides the only eye candy but not much acting.  I got this movie because I wanted to have all of Almodovar--now I wish I hadn't.  Beware: you must have an all-region DVD!",1256774400,2,537,4.868131868131868
