8174893,3,B000BM7YHO,"IN A NUTSHELL: 'THE FIGHT AGAINST PAIN' IS A CONDENSED REPORT ON THE STATE OF PAIN MANAGEMENT IN THE U.S.

All of what you'll see here is interesting, but it is rather difficult to apply what you will see to getting any pain relief. The show claims to ""report on the causes of pain, the impact it has on our lives, work, family and even our mental outlook.""

In reality, this ABC News series focused more on the tragic stories of several cases which illustrate the criminalization of pain medication distribution by both doctors and patients. In both cases, pain relief ended up as a 25 year jail sentence.

The series promises to ""better educate and assist those struggling with pain, the new and promising treatments on the horizon and the types of resources available for them."" It promises to explore the following issues:

 -----> Controlling Pain
 -----> The Next Miracle Drug
 -----> Pain Specialists
 -----> Alternative Treatments
 -----> Treating Pain In Children
 -----> New Treatments for Pain

BOTTOM LINE: TOO MUCH TIME SPENT REPEATING LEAD-INS AS IF WE JUST CAME BACK FROM COMMERCIAL BREAK.",1158883200,4,1104,4.9135135135135135
