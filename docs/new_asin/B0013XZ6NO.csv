3120429,1,B0013XZ6NO,"To use the name of Val Kilmer to draw the viewers to this film is a total con job.

VAL KILMER PLAYS A ""DEAD"" CORPSE AND DOESN'T UTTER A SINGLE SYLLABLE IN THE ENTIRE FILM. HE COULD HAVE BEEN EASILY REPLACED WITH A 100 LBS SACK OF FLOUR ... FOR THE SAME EFFECT VALUE.

3120432,5,B0013XZ6NO,"Sheesh!  I am so glad I stumbled into this artistically-done western.  Until seeing Dead Man's Bounty, I admired The Good, Bad, and Ugly as the most artistic film in the genre.  Dead Man's Bounty exceeded my expectations, particularly in the stylistic camera work and editing - notable in the character's viewpoints.  I found myself captivated by the story without even being able to understand all  of what was being said; it literally made me think of those old cowboys with broken ear drums from all that gunfire.

As a final note, I thought it would never get any more repulsively great than Clint Eastwood as Josey Wales spitting a big, black tobacco loogie on another guy's boot.  Dead Man's Bounty raises the bar with a scene in which a cowboy draws a naked lady in the sand with his urine.",1213660800,7,797,4.65

3. It helps to see the artistic approach to this movie.

3120436,1,B0013XZ6NO,"I will keep it short: They likened this to the ""Good, the bad and the ugly"".  What a deadly way to con viewers.  Dead man's bounty is beyond dead, it is totally rotten. Bloody gore without meaning!",1209513600,4,197,4.297297297297297
3120437,3,B0013XZ6NO,"Although his leading man days are history, Val Kilmer has held on to his sense of humor.  During his marquee days above the title, he appeared as Elvis in ""Top Gun"" director Tony Scott's adrenaline-fueled, 1993 comedy-thriller ""True Romance,"" with Christian Slater.  You never saw Kilmer's face.  You saw his physique and you heard his melliferous Elvis impersonation.  Kilmer stole the scenes with Slater when he appeared in the background as the King and counseled the delusional hero.

Later, Kilmer appeared briefly as a Los Angeles taxi driver in the independent British feature ""Played,"" a 2006 revenge crime thriller in the Quentin Tarantino vein about trigger-happy hooligans.  During the filming of a scene where Kilmer's cabbie rushes a wounded hero to a doctor, Kilmer's real-life cell phone rang and he conversed with his mother without breaking character.  The director of ""Played"" loved the spontaneity of Kilmer's improvised dialogue so much that he kept it in the film.  Anybody who enjoys Val Kilmer movies, however, may knit their brows in dismay about the new Lionsgate's DVD release ""Dead Man's Bounty,"" a symbolic but snake-bitten, frontier law & order western with an R-rating for violence, strong language and sexuality.

Originally, art house theaters showed ""Dead Man's Bounty"" in 2006 and 2007 under the unlikely title ""Summer Love.""  First-time writer & director Piotr Uklanski had already acquired a reputation as avant-garde conceptual artist, whose works appeared at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, Centre Pompidou in Paris, and the Venice Biennale, long before he went behind the cameras.  According to a reputable Polish Culture website, Uklanski ""recycles visuals, concepts, and cliches and gives them a new presence, both crass and seductive, precisely by questioning the politics of different visual worlds.""  The website adds that Uklanski ""uses stereotypical motifs and strategies from pop culture, art, and cinema to address issues of cultural identity and authenticity.""  Uklanski lives up to this reputation with ""Dead Man's Bounty.""  As an example of his ""insolence in the way he plays with audience expectations,"" Uklanski cast "" Tombstone "" lead Val Kilmer as a corpse.  Kilmer's dead man sprawls lifelessly in each shot, staring glassy eyed into eternity without a blink.  Never does he utter the first syllable.  You cannot say that you were not warned about ""Dead Man's Bounty"" in these hallowed pages.  Most people who either rent or buy ""Dead Man's Bounty"" are going to howl like a coyote!

Like Val Kilmer's guest role as a corpse, ""Dead Man's Bounty"" qualifies as bizarre, almost surreal.  Moreover, ""Dead Man's Bounty"" is being billed as the first Polish western!  The rugged, violent, and ignoble west of Piotr Uklanski blends the nihilism of 1960's Spaghetti westerns and the authenticity of HBO's trail-breaking western mini-series ""Deadwood.""  Uklanski depicts western violence as indiscriminate, sanguinary, and often satirical.  The sympathetic heroes and dastardly villains that you would expect to find in a traditional western are absent from ""Dead Man's Bounty.""  Indeed, Uklanski appropriates traditional western elements as a metaphor, but he retools the genre to accommodate his skewered ideology.  Happily, the scenic Polish landscape substitutes splendidly for the arid 19th century American Southwest, and lenser Jacek Petrycki's evocative widescreen photography provides a feast of striking images comparable to Frederic Remington.

""Dead Man's Bounty"" emerges as a mythic western.  The characters lack names.  Their occupation dictates their identity.  This symbol-laden saga opens as a Stranger in black (Czech actor Karel Rogen of ""Blade 2"") finds a number of dead bodies at a river crossing by a burned stagecoach.  He discovers the fly-infested corpse of the Wanted Man (Val Kilmer of ""The Saint"") among them.  The Stranger rides into an anonymous frontier town but loses everything, including the body of the Wanted Man--worth five hundred dollars--to a drunkard (Boguslave Linda), the town sheriff who behaves erratically.  As his favorite pastime, the sheriff dons eye patches and bets gamblers that he can identify them the second time they smash their fists into his face.  ""Dead Man's Bounty"" probably trots too off the trail for traditional cowboy movie enthusiasts.

The Stranger's next mistake is sleeping with the woman (Katarzayna Figura) who owns the town saloon.  Afterward, the locals confront him with their guns and try to disarm him.  When the Stranger drops his rifle, the weapon discharges accidentally and hits one of the locals in the leg.  A crazy gunfight ensues with bystanders becoming casualties.  One local wounds the Stranger in the head, and the drunken sheriff gathers a posse to pursue him.  Later, the Stranger cauterizes his bloody head wound with gunpowder from his own bullets that he ignites with a pair of matches.  Clearly, Uklanski has seen the Clint Eastwood oater ""Two Mules for Sister Sara.""

""Dead Man's Bounty"" mimics westerns in general and Sergio Leone Spaghetti westerns in particular.  The joke here is that most Spaghetti westerns featured an unknown or faded American star, and Uklanski exploits Kilmer with the same idea in mind for his Pierogi western but only as a corpse.  Uklanski directs with a heavy hand and the pace is often leaden.  On the other hand, ""Dead Man's Bounty"" is rarely predictable. Unless you fancy yourself a connoisseur of pretentious, postmodernist art, ""Dead Man's Bounty"" may give you saddle sores.  Meanwhile, Kilmer buffs who don't share their star's sense of humor may find ""Dead Man's Bounty"" too tough a horse to ride.",1209513600,9,5685,5.309843400447427

3120503,5,B0013XZ6NO,"First of all,  for all the typically self-absorbed yankees,  the film is a Polish product,  not 'Russian'.  A good amount of Slavic sarcasm was sown throughout the script,  and those who didn't at least suspect the presence of humour might consider a lucrative,  low-key second job as a cemetary headstone.

Second,  while gold can sometimes be found on the very surface of this planet,  available to those who are in the right place at the right time,  and looking down at the proper instant,  much more often we need to employ extreme means,  take great risks,  even sacrifice lives  to bring the purest of the yellow stuff to hand.  The same analogy can be applied to humor:  there are the Steve Martins and G. Gordon Liddys,  and then there are (were) the much more scarce and hard to mine Bill Hicks,  Fr. Guido Sarducci (Don Novello),  and  Andy Kaufman.

There were subtle,  hilarious moments in Dead Man's Bounty,  but I fear tha Roman Polanski was right about the singular,  ascerbic,  often incomprehensible nature of the Polish character,  especially where humour is concerned.  It does astound me that the same people who worship the overrated rubber-mug Tarantino's 'gonzo humor' were not able to extract a few nuggets to laugh over from this wide Polish parody of the American/Italian pasta/TV dinner western.  I might mean Hang 'Em High or I might be thinking of the tube's endless ""Bonanza.""  Or worst of all,  the terminally constipating ""Gun Smoke.""  (Btw the USA's Food And Drug Administration once did consider requiring a pre-broadcast, on-screen black box warning to be aired before ""Gun Smoke's weekly offering began to roll...cautioning the delicate and the elderly to have plenty of HOT prune juice within arm's reach just in case...)

But to return to ""Bounty,""  Kilmer in particular must have had a hoot on the set of this one---how many viewers noticed that he did make an obvious,  hard-to-miss PHYSICAL MOVEMENT,  an actual roll to his left,  about half way into the film?  So,  just to make if official,  he DID 'act' in the story,  and not just as a 'motionless corpse'.  Possibly that one move had something to do with an obscure paragraph defining 'star.'  'extra'  and 'cameo' roles,  and the pay scales afforded all three by the union.

I laughed,  often out loud,  at the efforts and sound effects of the gallows builder.  VERY Polish,  that kind of furious-at-self/furious-at-world  do-or-die construction undertaking.  The heart of the Slav,  like that of the gypsy,  is a strange and thorny place indeed.",1416873600,3,2544,4.9052132701421804

3120524,1,B0013XZ6NO,"Dead Man's Bounty, 2005 film

It opens with people lying on the ground near a lake. All dead? One man is carried away. Elsewhere a man carves a figure in the sand with the scabbard of a sword. A man enters a bar, he is blindfolded with leather goggles. This building has openings in the walls, like a barn. There is rain outside the Sheriff's Office. Elsewhere men laugh at a woman. A man brings in a wanted poster, but the Sheriff is a week's ride away. There are more strange events. Do they make sense to you? [Is this a bunch of lunatics who have escaped from an asylum?] The next morning a man leaves from the second story of a building. Another man points a pistol at a man with a rifle. ""Drop the gun!"" He does and it goes off wounding a man. There are more shots and men fall.

The next morning men ride out in pursuit of the man who got away. ""No hanging without a trial."" Is that man turning back? ""We'll cut him off at the pass."" ""Do you know what that means?"" ""Absolutely nothing."" [I'm not making this up.] They see a shack. A bloody man counts his bullets. [Does anything here make sense to you?] The men are riding further and further away from town. Another man is beaten. [Senseless violence again.] A man falls off his horse; only four are left. ""Where are those tracks?"" There is a shack alongside a railway. A man chops wood. Are those riders going in a circle? [Does that symbolize this movie? Can those men go on without food and water?] ""It's the Sheriff's horse."" A man asks for a drink. A train whistle sounds. That woman talks about her expectations. Her scars will be kissed. The man chopping wood makes a mistake and screams.

Would this movie get any better? I didn't think so and changed to another station. It is way too bad to be considered a parody of anything. The low budget for this film can be deduced from the limited number of actors, the cheap sets, and the script. A good story makes a good movie, this is like a collection of scenes produced and assembled by lunatics at random. Who wasted money on this project? I wish I could award this movie a negative rating.",1382227200,,2105,4.3106060606060606

But it does have an A-list (at one time anyway) American actor (Val Kilmer) in it who plays his part pretty well...  the dead guy that lays in the street for the entire movie!

This movie is so beyond definition, I want a copy of it for posterity. It is truly undescribable; you have to experience the film, uninterupted for all 94 minutes. I would use it to induce confessions, to replace waterboarding, incase torture comes back into vogue and is accepted by society as worthwhile behavior. It's even conceivable that it could be used to encourage one 'to end it all' if convicted and sentenced to life in prison and mandated to watch this film over and over again. It was rumored that Val Kilmer was accosted out of the blue with a bag containing $50,000 for one day's shoot without any spoken word. Who among us could or would resist that? But you had to be Val Kilmer to get that kind of offer. I should have taped it to show others. I could edit out the commercials so as not to interupt the flow of visuals and dialog.

They put Val Kilmers face on the movie only so you will be curious enough to buy it. Al Val Kilmer does in the movie is play being a dead guy, WOW!!! Now on to the other garbage about the movie.

The props in the movie look like they went to Home friggin Depot and bought a storage shed and put it in a remote location. I mean the props in the movie are so bad that at one point you see fly paper hanging over the bar in one scene (um correct me if Im wrong but I don't think fly paper even existed back then) lol, wtf?

Now on to the acting..OMFG they should have done it old school kung fu movie style and dubbed voices over the actors because at times you cant understand their version on the english language.

I cant really review the rest of the movie as I couldn't bear to complete watching it because what I saw for 30 mins was so terrible. I really want to know did Val Kilmer lose a bet with someone to have had a role in that movie (as a previous reviewer wrote) or were the guys in the movies friends of his and he was trying to do them a favor?

I found myself captivated by the story without even being able to understand all  of what was being said; it literally made me think of those old cowboys with broken ear drums from all that gunfire.

3354934,3,B0013XZ6NO,"Although his leading man days are history, Val Kilmer has held on to his sense of humor.  During his marquee days above the title, he appeared as Elvis in ""Top Gun"" director Tony Scott's adrenaline-fueled, 1993 comedy-thriller ""True Romance,"" with Christian Slater.  You never saw Kilmer's face.  You saw his physique and you heard his melliferous Elvis impersonation.  Kilmer stole the scenes with Slater when he appeared in the background as the King and counseled the delusional hero.

Later, Kilmer appeared briefly as a Los Angeles taxi driver in the independent British feature ""Played,"" a 2006 revenge crime thriller in the Quentin Tarantino vein about trigger-happy hooligans.  During the filming of a scene where Kilmer's cabbie rushes a wounded hero to a doctor, Kilmer's real-life cell phone rang and he conversed with his mother without breaking character.  The director of ""Played"" loved the spontaneity of Kilmer's improvised dialogue so much that he kept it in the film.  Anybody who enjoys Val Kilmer movies, however, may knit their brows in dismay about the new Lionsgate's DVD release ""Dead Man's Bounty,"" a symbolic but snake-bitten, frontier law & order western with an R-rating for violence, strong language and sexuality.

Originally, art house theaters showed ""Dead Man's Bounty"" in 2006 and 2007 under the unlikely title ""Summer Love.""  First-time writer & director Piotr Uklanski had already acquired a reputation as avant-garde conceptual artist, whose works appeared at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, Centre Pompidou in Paris, and the Venice Biennale, long before he went behind the cameras.  According to a reputable Polish Culture website, Uklanski ""recycles visuals, concepts, and cliches and gives them a new presence, both crass and seductive, precisely by questioning the politics of different visual worlds.""  The website adds that Uklanski ""uses stereotypical motifs and strategies from pop culture, art, and cinema to address issues of cultural identity and authenticity.""  Uklanski lives up to this reputation with ""Dead Man's Bounty.""  As an example of his ""insolence in the way he plays with audience expectations,"" Uklanski cast "" Tombstone "" lead Val Kilmer as a corpse.  Kilmer's dead man sprawls lifelessly in each shot, staring glassy eyed into eternity without a blink.  Never does he utter the first syllable.  You cannot say that you were not warned about ""Dead Man's Bounty"" in these hallowed pages.  Most people who either rent or buy ""Dead Man's Bounty"" are going to howl like a coyote!

Like Val Kilmer's guest role as a corpse, ""Dead Man's Bounty"" qualifies as bizarre, almost surreal.  Moreover, ""Dead Man's Bounty"" is being billed as the first Polish western!  The rugged, violent, and ignoble west of Piotr Uklanski blends the nihilism of 1960's Spaghetti westerns and the authenticity of HBO's trail-breaking western mini-series ""Deadwood.""  Uklanski depicts western violence as indiscriminate, sanguinary, and often satirical.  The sympathetic heroes and dastardly villains that you would expect to find in a traditional western are absent from ""Dead Man's Bounty.""  Indeed, Uklanski appropriates traditional western elements as a metaphor, but he retools the genre to accommodate his skewered ideology.  Happily, the scenic Polish landscape substitutes splendidly for the arid 19th century American Southwest, and lenser Jacek Petrycki's evocative widescreen photography provides a feast of striking images comparable to Frederic Remington.

""Dead Man's Bounty"" emerges as a mythic western.  The characters lack names.  Their occupation dictates their identity.  This symbol-laden saga opens as a Stranger in black (Czech actor Karel Rogen of ""Blade 2"") finds a number of dead bodies at a river crossing by a burned stagecoach.  He discovers the fly-infested corpse of the Wanted Man (Val Kilmer of ""The Saint"") among them.  The Stranger rides into an anonymous frontier town but loses everything, including the body of the Wanted Man--worth five hundred dollars--to a drunkard (Boguslave Linda), the town sheriff who behaves erratically.  As his favorite pastime, the sheriff dons eye patches and bets gamblers that he can identify them the second time they smash their fists into his face.  ""Dead Man's Bounty"" probably trots too off the trail for traditional cowboy movie enthusiasts.

The Stranger's next mistake is sleeping with the woman (Katarzayna Figura) who owns the town saloon.  Afterward, the locals confront him with their guns and try to disarm him.  When the Stranger drops his rifle, the weapon discharges accidentally and hits one of the locals in the leg.  A crazy gunfight ensues with bystanders becoming casualties.  One local wounds the Stranger in the head, and the drunken sheriff gathers a posse to pursue him.  Later, the Stranger cauterizes his bloody head wound with gunpowder from his own bullets that he ignites with a pair of matches.  Clearly, Uklanski has seen the Clint Eastwood oater ""Two Mules for Sister Sara.""

""Dead Man's Bounty"" mimics westerns in general and Sergio Leone Spaghetti westerns in particular.  The joke here is that most Spaghetti westerns featured an unknown or faded American star, and Uklanski exploits Kilmer with the same idea in mind for his Pierogi western but only as a corpse.  Uklanski directs with a heavy hand and the pace is often leaden.  On the other hand, ""Dead Man's Bounty"" is rarely predictable. Unless you fancy yourself a connoisseur of pretentious, postmodernist art, ""Dead Man's Bounty"" may give you saddle sores.  Meanwhile, Kilmer buffs who don't share their star's sense of humor may find ""Dead Man's Bounty"" too tough a horse to ride.",1209513600,9,5685,5.309843400447427

3355000,5,B0013XZ6NO,"First of all,  for all the typically self-absorbed yankees,  the film is a Polish product,  not 'Russian'.  A good amount of Slavic sarcasm was sown throughout the script,  and those who didn't at least suspect the presence of humour might consider a lucrative,  low-key second job as a cemetary headstone.

Second,  while gold can sometimes be found on the very surface of this planet,  available to those who are in the right place at the right time,  and looking down at the proper instant,  much more often we need to employ extreme means,  take great risks,  even sacrifice lives  to bring the purest of the yellow stuff to hand.  The same analogy can be applied to humor:  there are the Steve Martins and G. Gordon Liddys,  and then there are (were) the much more scarce and hard to mine Bill Hicks,  Fr. Guido Sarducci (Don Novello),  and  Andy Kaufman.

There were subtle,  hilarious moments in Dead Man's Bounty,  but I fear tha Roman Polanski was right about the singular,  ascerbic,  often incomprehensible nature of the Polish character,  especially where humour is concerned.  It does astound me that the same people who worship the overrated rubber-mug Tarantino's 'gonzo humor' were not able to extract a few nuggets to laugh over from this wide Polish parody of the American/Italian pasta/TV dinner western.  I might mean Hang 'Em High or I might be thinking of the tube's endless ""Bonanza.""  Or worst of all,  the terminally constipating ""Gun Smoke.""  (Btw the USA's Food And Drug Administration once did consider requiring a pre-broadcast, on-screen black box warning to be aired before ""Gun Smoke's weekly offering began to roll...cautioning the delicate and the elderly to have plenty of HOT prune juice within arm's reach just in case...)

But to return to ""Bounty,""  Kilmer in particular must have had a hoot on the set of this one---how many viewers noticed that he did make an obvious,  hard-to-miss PHYSICAL MOVEMENT,  an actual roll to his left,  about half way into the film?  So,  just to make if official,  he DID 'act' in the story,  and not just as a 'motionless corpse'.  Possibly that one move had something to do with an obscure paragraph defining 'star.'  'extra'  and 'cameo' roles,  and the pay scales afforded all three by the union.

I laughed,  often out loud,  at the efforts and sound effects of the gallows builder.  VERY Polish,  that kind of furious-at-self/furious-at-world  do-or-die construction undertaking.  The heart of the Slav,  like that of the gypsy,  is a strange and thorny place indeed.",1416873600,3,2544,4.9052132701421804

It opens with people lying on the ground near a lake. All dead? One man is carried away. Elsewhere a man carves a figure in the sand with the scabbard of a sword. A man enters a bar, he is blindfolded with leather goggles. This building has openings in the walls, like a barn. There is rain outside the Sheriff's Office. Elsewhere men laugh at a woman. A man brings in a wanted poster, but the Sheriff is a week's ride away. There are more strange events. Do they make sense to you? [Is this a bunch of lunatics who have escaped from an asylum?] The next morning a man leaves from the second story of a building. Another man points a pistol at a man with a rifle. ""Drop the gun!"" He does and it goes off wounding a man. There are more shots and men fall.

The next morning men ride out in pursuit of the man who got away. ""No hanging without a trial."" Is that man turning back? ""We'll cut him off at the pass."" ""Do you know what that means?"" ""Absolutely nothing."" [I'm not making this up.] They see a shack. A bloody man counts his bullets. [Does anything here make sense to you?] The men are riding further and further away from town. Another man is beaten. [Senseless violence again.] A man falls off his horse; only four are left. ""Where are those tracks?"" There is a shack alongside a railway. A man chops wood. Are those riders going in a circle? [Does that symbolize this movie? Can those men go on without food and water?] ""It's the Sheriff's horse."" A man asks for a drink. A train whistle sounds. That woman talks about her expectations. Her scars will be kissed. The man chopping wood makes a mistake and screams.

Would this movie get any better? I didn't think so and changed to another station. It is way too bad to be considered a parody of anything. The low budget for this film can be deduced from the limited number of actors, the cheap sets, and the script.

It's even conceivable that it could be used to encourage one 'to end it all' if convicted and sentenced to life in prison and mandated to watch this film over and over again. It was rumored that Val Kilmer was accosted out of the blue with a bag containing $50,000 for one day's shoot without any spoken word. Who among us could or would resist that?

3355027,1,B0013XZ6NO,I`m a hardy individual. This film made me fill dirty! It`s a crime to refer to this as a western. EURO TRASH with a .45.,1352851200,,120,3.84
3355028,1,B0013XZ6NO,"Hoo boy. Hardly worth the one star. I had the misfortune of seeing this one in the theater, believe it or not. Luckily, that theater was located in the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (and MoMA, I still love ya' - despite your decision to display this flick), and a friend of mine was a museum member. That meant I got in for free, thank goodness - because if I'd paid money for this dreck I'd have been batting down the box-office door and asking for a refund. Now, I know this flick is supposed to be an art piece - an homage to and satire of the Spaghetti Western - but *only* because the museum literature said so. Characters come and go with laughable dialogue and little motivation, while scenes often play out with what seem to be missing transitions.

And oh, yeah - Val Kilmer's in this one too. But like these two final sentences, his presence kinda feels like an afterthought.",1310169600,,890,4.393939393939394
3355029,1,B0013XZ6NO,This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life... do I need to say anything more?  Val Kilmer must really be desperate for cash!,1308441600,,147,3.9
3355030,1,B0013XZ6NO,"I love westerns....love Val Kilmer, but can't really recommend this movie unless you like kind of strange, slow moving (not much real action) westerns.

THIS FILM DOES NOT EVEN MERIT A SINGLE ARM OF A STAR. IT IS BYYYYYY FAAAAAAAAAAR THE SINGLE WORST WESTERN I'VE SEEN HANDS DOWN AND DEFINITELY IN THE RUNNING FOR WORST MOVIE OF ANNNNNY KIND I'VE EVER SEEN!!!!! GIVING KILMER CREDIT, I BET HE WAS EDITED BACK INTO THE FILM DEMANDING HE BE DEAD THE ENTIRE TIME BECAUSE HE PROBABLY REALIZED WHAT A PIECE OF TRASH IT WAS AFTER IT WAS TOO LATE. FOR PEOPLE TO THINK OF THIS FILM AS ""ARTISITC FILMMAKING"" IS SO LAUGHABLE. ENOUGH SAID I'VE WASTED 2 MINUTES OF MY LIFE ALREADY ON THIS.",1265068800,5,685,4.444444444444445
3355034,1,B0013XZ6NO,I love western movies. But this.....forget it. I don't understand how Val Kilmer got involved in this movie. It made no sense at all. It was stupid and rediculous. Some of the actors were hard to understand. Val Kilmer's charactor was easier to understand; and he was DEAD! I would never compare this movie to any of Clint Eastwood's westerns.

3355037,1,B0013XZ6NO,"This movie is absolute garbage. I bought this movie while on deployment out of sheer boredom and was pissed off not even halfway thru the movie. They put Val Kilmers face on the movie only so you will be curious enough to buy it. Al Val Kilmer does in the movie is play being a dead guy, WOW!!! Now on to the other garbage about the movie.

The props in the movie look like they went to Home friggin Depot and bought a storage shed and put it in a remote location. I mean the props in the movie are so bad that at one point you see fly paper hanging over the bar in one scene (um correct me if Im wrong but I don't think fly paper even existed back then) lol, wtf?

Now on to the acting..OMFG they should have done it old school kung fu movie style and dubbed voices over the actors because at times you cant understand their version on the english language.

I cant really review the rest of the movie as I couldn't bear to complete watching it because what I saw for 30 mins was so terrible. I really want to know did Val Kilmer lose a bet with someone to have had a role in that movie (as a previous reviewer wrote) or were the guys in the movies friends of his and he was trying to do them a favor? Well regardless if I EVER come across Mr. Kilmer Im sure gonna ask for my $19.95 back. To the other reviewers on here who gave 5 stars either they were friends of the people who made the movie, high on something they smoked when they wrote the review, paid to write a review, or all three.

Save your money cuz and as far as the star ratings on here if it was possible to give this movie negative star ratings that reach off to the left side it wouldve been ""-5""",1234828800,2,1665,4.006024096385542
3355038,1,B0013XZ6NO,"Apparently, you can't rate a movie zero stars.  In light of this film, Amazon should reconsider that policy.
In my nearly-50 years, I have watched tens of thousands of movies.  And yet I can't think of one that stunk as badly as this picture.  The makers of this film try to pass off as ""artsy"" a film that has no plot, asinine dialogue, thoroughly detestable characters and an unredeemed attraction to gore and ugliness. Val Kilmer should be shot for real for lending his name and photo to this picture. Comparisons to Eastwood's spaghetti westerns are ludicrous.
Just poke yourself int the eye.  You'll save a dollar and have essentially the same experience.",1220313600,25,660,4.814159292035399
