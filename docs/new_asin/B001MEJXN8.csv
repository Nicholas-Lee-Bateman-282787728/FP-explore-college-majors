8321118,2,B001MEJXN8,"I had every reason to enjoy this movie - in theory.  MUTANT CHRONICLES boasts a cast with actors I admire, the genre is of a type that typically appeals to me, and the storyline held promise, based on the blurbs I had read.

But my enjoyment ended with the trailers and blurbs.  Once I actually watched the movie I found it to be a hodge-podge of scenes strung together for effect, without real character development or a solid storyline.  The plot was as flimsy as Ron Perlman's accent, which changed from scene to scene.  Not what I expected from an actor whose work I have respected in the past.

Thomas Jane is another actor I usually enjoy, and he did play his part as the hero of the piece well.  Unfortunately, without the character development to engage the viewer's interest, we were left with a well-played hero that we never felt we knew.

The various heroes and heroines had random bursts of nobility, but we never really get a feel for why each of them has committed themselves to this suicide mission, with a few exceptions.

What hurt the movie most for me was that it started off in the midst of a battle scene that went on for far too long without first allowing me to learn a little about what was going on, or developing much empathy for the characters in the battle.

All in all, MUTANT CHRONICLES fails to deliver the cinematic thrill I had expected from such a cast.  It is one-dimensional with scenes that feel designed to titillate and shock rather than really add to the story.

You may still want to watch it for curiosity's sake, but I would recommend until the rental prices are considerably less or perhaps wait until it airs on television.  You won't be missing much until then.

**NOTE** This review is of the story only, as I watched the pre-theatrical release rental download from Amazon.  My review does not consider Blu-Ray quality or any features on the disc.",1240012800,2,1895,4.548672566371682

8321120,4,B001MEJXN8,"Hmm, well, its really a 3.5 out of 5, but I err on the side of generosity as this appears to be a British production. Visually, the film is really quite good, the World War 1 trench warfare scenes despite the fact that the film is set 700 years into the future are quite well realised, it has the sort of ""Sky Captain"" feel to it. What with steam powered helicopters and the like, it has that futuristic retro feel about it. So, top marks for that.

It is let down by rather poor plotting, with some sections of the film rather dragging on a bit, and again, I would always prefer a little more back story to explain the motivation of the machine and its makers, a little more about the monks, a little more about the world of 2707.

I had no idea if this film spawns from an RPG, it certainly feels like it does, but to be fair, it is done pretty well, and overall, I enjoyed the film.",1237161600,,885,4.109826589595376
8321121,2,B001MEJXN8,"Okay, so the only reason I bought this (and it is still available in Hong Kong!) is that the movie starts John Malkovich and Ron Perlman--so it can't be horrible, can it?  Well, it isn't utterly horrible, but it's hardly worth your time, and certainly wasn't worth Malkovich's--he's only in the first fifteen minutes, and not much of those.  Basically, this is an excuse to have tough guys and hot chicks blowing up and stabbing monsters.  Plotwise it makes no sense, visually it's barely okay.  Why the war in the year 2707 looks like WWI, even down to helmets and mustard gas, I don't know.  Nor do I know why the mysterious machine turns people into mutants, or why the prophecies lead them to believe that a particular device is a bomb that has to be put into the machine and turned with a key they don't have--if it's something that's MADE to be put into an infernal machine, and activated with a key, chances are really good that it is NOT a bomb!  And sure enough...it isn't.  But what becomes of this machine isn't entirely clear, or why.

SPOILER ALERT: This movie makes no sense.

But for many of the people who want to see it, that's not really much of a problem.  Personally, I've been watching Battlestar Galactica a lot recently, and I wish Mutant Chronicles had sprung for one of the writers of that series.  It's not the worst movie ever.  But it's really not worth the time, unless you're a prisoner, I suppose.",1236556800,,1428,4.5136186770428015
8321122,3,B001MEJXN8,"An entertaining (if gory) fan-boy movie, apparently inspired by an RPG game. The makers obviously made the film they wanted to make - and damn the length, or toning down the gore. The movie started off very well, and although the plot is hokum I like sci-fi and could suspend disbelief. But the plot gets markedly worse as the film moves into the second half. In the final third the plot just devolves into total cliche, although certainly it's not without entertainment value.  What's good about the movie? Well-cast, excellent character-acting throughout, and no unconvincing accents. Workmanlike camerawork. Solid sound-design. Excellent lighting throughout. Strong but unobtrusive costuming. A unique steampunk/sci-fi/horror setting. Almost all FX were convincing, apart from a few rocket-ship take-offs. Truly excellent set design throughout. All characters are adequately if rather sketchily portrayed, and there's no ""nameless grunt #8""'s. Throughout, you can tell a lot of British film-making craftsmanship went into the film. It's perhaps also good that they didn't have a big enough budget for some donkey-brained  accountants from Hollywood step in, take over, and ruin the movie. What's bad? The lacklustre plot in the second half, the plain dialogue throughout, the mediocre seen-it-all-before final scenes. The lack of the sort of convincing scientific detail that any sci-fi movie needs in order to rise above being essentially just a horror flick.  But you can tell everyone had fun making this film, and it's certainly fun to watch. Once.",1231027200,3,1555,5.443983402489627
