8085808,5,B000BF0CSO,"Bill  Clinton's  legal  birth  name  is  William  Jefferson  Blythe  Clinton .  I  was  a  young  teenage  girl  during  the  1990s  when  Bill  Clinton  was  President  of  the  United  States  and  AL  Gore  was  Vice  President  of  the  United  States .  However ,  I  remember  during  the  fall  of  1994 ,  former  President  Bill  Clinton  had  successfully  created  an  educational  program .  The  name  of  Bill  Clinton's  program  is  called  "" THE  PRESIDENT'S  EDUCATION  AWARDS  PROGRAM .""  Now  Bill  Clinton  had  created  this  educational  program  to  help  millions  of  young  teenage  girls  to  advance  themselves  by  getting  an  education .  Now  first  of  all ,  Bill  Clinton  is  the  one  who  had  carefully  developed ,  organized ,  and  created ,  "" THE  PRESIDENT'S  EDUCATION  AWARDS  PROGRAM .""  Therefore ,  Bill  Clinton  is  the  mastermind  behind  the  creation  of  "" THE  PRESIDENT'S  EDUCATION  AWARDS  PROGRAM .""  Now  during  the  1990s ,  Bill  Clinton  had  provided  educational  resources  for  many  female  teenagers  and  Bill  Clinton  also  did  help  a  lot  of  female  teenagers  to  get  into  college .  However ,  in  the  beginning  early  process  while  Bill  Clinton  was  developing  his  educational  awards  program  for  female  teenagers .  Bill  Clinton  knew  and  realized  that  in  order  to  enforce  his  educational  awards  program  into  the  high  schools ,  Bill  Clinton  needed  Richard  Riley's  approval.  When  Bill  Clinton  had  showed  his  views  concerning  his  ideas  about  providing  and  improving  educational  programs  for  young  female  teenagers  to  Richard  Riley ,  however  at  first ,  Richard  Riley  had  carefully  examined  and  evaluated  Bill  Clinton's  educational  awards  program  and  eventually  Richard  Riley  loved  Bill  Clinton's  educational  awards  program .  At  that  point ,  Richard  Riley  began  to  take  Bill  Clinton's  ideas  more  seriously .  Personally ,  Richard  Riley  thought  that  the  entire  concept  concerning  "" THE  PRESIDENT'S  EDUCATION  AWARDS  PROGRAM  FOR  EDUCATIONAL  IMPROVEMENT ,""  was  a  wonderful  idea  to  help  encourage  and  to  help  motivate  millions  of  female  teenagers  into  pursuing  an  education .  Well,  during  the  fall  of  1994 ,  the  former  42nd  President  Bill  Clinton  had  carefully  developed  and  created ,  "" THE  PRESIDENT'S  EDUCATION  AWARDS  PROGRAM ,""  and  Richard  Riley  just  plainly  enforced  Bill's  Educational  Awards  Program  into  several  local ,  private  and  catholic  high  schools  throughout  the  United  States .  Furthermore ,  in  case  you  don't  know  who  Richard  Riley  is ,  well  I  will  gladly  tell  you  who  Richard  Riley  is .  The  honorable  Richard  Wilson  Riley  was  born  in  Greenville ,  South  Carolina ,  on  January . 2 , 1933 .  The  honorable  Richard  Wilson  Riley  is  an  American  Politician  and  Richard  is  also  a  long  time  member  of  the  Democratic  Party  and  Richard  was  also  the  111th  Governor  of  South  Carolina .  During  Bill  Clinton's  Presidency ,  the  honorable  Richard  Riley  had  actively  worked  and  served  as  the  United  States  Secretary  of  Education ,  between  the  years  of  1993  through  the  year  of  2001 .  However ,  first  of  all ,  I  must  inform  you  that  I  have  never  watched  this  particular  DVD  which  is  titled :  "" BIOGRAPHY--BILL  CLINTON,""  which  was  created  by  James  Carville ,  but  I  am  pretty  sure  that  it  is  a  great  documentary  about  Bill  Clinton's  historical  political  lifestyle .  Well  anyways ,  for  the  record ,  I  can  still  clearly  remember  my  high  school  graduation  ceremony  which  took  place  in  the  year  1995 .  Well ,  I  had  graduated  from  Madonna  High  School  in  the  year  1995  ; therefore ,  I  graduated  from  high  school  twenty  years  ago .  Now  first  of  all  for  the  record ,  Madonna  High  School  was  not  named  after  the  famous  lovely  and  talented  1980s  singer  named  Madonna .  Actually ,  Madonna  High  School  was  built  here  in  Chicago .  Madonna  High  School  is  an  all  girls  catholic  high  school  which  was  built  in  the  year  1949  by  a  large  group  of  Franciscan  Nuns .  Well ,  now  I  will  continue  to  talk  about  Bill  Clinton's  Educational  Awards  Program .  First  of  all ,  during  my  high  school  graduation  ceremony ,  I  can  still  clearly  remember  that  Sister  Carol  Marie  Schommer  happily  and  proudly  gave  me  my  high  school  diploma  and  at  the  same  time  Sister  Carol  Marie  Schommer  also  gave  me  an  award  certificate .  My  award  contains  a  lot  of  huge  black  capital  letters  and  the  award  itself  contains  the  following  written  typed  inscription :  PRESIDENT'S  EDUCATION  AWARDS  PROGRAM .  THE  PRESIDENT'S  AWARD  FOR  EDUCATIONAL  IMPROVEMENT  PRESENTED  TO  ANGELICA  MARIA  VAZQUEZ  IN  RECOGNITION  OF  OUTSTANDING  EDUCATIONAL  IMPROVEMENT  IN  PURSUIT  OF  ACADEMIC  EXCELLENCE .  JUNE . 5 , 1995 .  Now  my  award  certificate  has  Bill  Clinton's  personal  autographed  signature  on  it  and  my  award  also  has  Richard  Riley's  personal  autographed  signature  on  it  too .  Now  first  of  all ,  Bill  Clinton's  personal  autographed  signature  is  located  on  the  bottom  right  hand  corner  and  Richard  Riley's  personal  autographed  signature  is  located  on  the  bottom  left  hand  corner  and  my  award  also  has  Sister  Carol  Marie  Schommer's  personal  autographed  signature  which  is  located  right  underneath  Richard  Riley's  signature .  Now  for  the  record ,  Sister  Carol  Marie  Schommer  was  the  former  high  school  principal  of  Madonna  Catholic  High  School .  Furthermore ,  my  award  also  features  a  lovely  silver  colored  picture  of  the  AMERICAN  EAGLE  PRESIDENTIAL  SEAL .  Now  the  AMERICAN  EAGLE  PRESIDENTIAL  SEAL  is  featured  right  on  the  center-middle  portion  of  the  award  itself .  The  AMERICAN  EAGLE  PRESIDENTIAL  SEAL  has  a  beautiful  and  extremely  shiny  silver  color  on  it .  Secondly ,  in  addition  to  receiving  my  high  school  diploma  and  receiving  my  award--certificate .  I  also  had  received  a  personal  typed  letter  from  the  former  42nd  President  Bill  Clinton .  Bill  Clinton  did  not  write  the  letter  with  a  pen .  The  letter  appears  to  have  been  professionally  typed .  My  personal  letter  from  Bill  Clinton  clearly  states  the  following :  THE  WHITE  HOUSE .  WASHINGTON  D.C.  JUNE. 5 ,  1995 .  CONGRATULATIONS ,  ANGELICA  YOU  ARE  NOW  THE  LUCKY  RECIPIENT  OF  THE  PRESIDENT'S  EDUCATION  AWARD .  AT  A  TIME  WHEN  MANY  YOUNG  AMERICANS  FACE  MANY  DIFFICULT  CHALLENGES ,  YOUR  LOYAL  DEDICATION  TO  EXCELLENCE  STANDS  AS  A  CONSTANT  REMINDER  TO  STUDENTS  ALL  ACROSS  THE  COUNTRY  THAT  THROUGH  STRONG  DETERMINATION  AND  HARD  WORK  AND  EFFORT ,  ALMOST  ANYTHING  IS  POSSIBLE  IN  LIFE  WHEN  YOU  PUT  YOUR  MIND  TO  IT .  I  AM  STRONGLY  ENCOURAGED  BY  YOUR  EFFORTS  AND  I  FEEL  CONFIDENT  THAT  AMERICA'S  FUTURE  IS  IN  GOOD  HANDS .  AS  YOU  REFLECT  ON  YOUR  MAJOR  ACCOMPLISHMENTS ,  I  HOPE  YOU  WILL  TAKE  THE  TIME  TO  REMEMBER  YOUR  FAMILY ,  TEACHERS,  AND  FRIENDS  WHO  HAVE  SUPPORTED  YOU  ALONG  THE  WAY .  MRS.  HILLARY  CLINTON  JOINS  ME  IN  WISHING  YOU  ANGELICA ,  EVERY  FUTURE  HAPPINESS .  SINCERELY ,  BILL  CLINTON .  Well ,  now  this  concludes  my  wonderful  review  on  Bill  Clinton .  Furthermore ,  I  personally  think  that  the  American  people  should  make  a  serious  attempt  to  completely  forget  about  Bill  Clinton's  sordid  past  history  concerning  his  constant  womanizing .  I  think  that  the  American  People  should  only  focus  their  attention  only  on  Bill  Clinton's  historical  educational  and  political  achievements .  Now  if  you  are  a  fan  of  the  former  42nd  President  Bill  Clinton .  I  strongly  recommend  that  you  purchase  his  2004  autobiography  which  is  titled :  "" MY  LIFE .""  And  you  can  also  purchase  the  biography  DVD  which  is  titled :  "" BIOGRAPHY--BILL  CLINTON,""  which  was  created  by  James  Carville .  You  can  also  purchase  other  written  documented  biographies  which  chronicles  the  political  life  and  times  of  Bill  Clinton .  Make  sure  you  purchase  Bill  Clinton's  biographies  and  DVDs  here  inside  the  AMAZON  MARKETPLACE .  Sincerely ,  Angelica  Vazquez .

8085809,5,B000BF0CSO,Written in a negatively biased way. Did not enjoy that much.,1416182400,,60,4.545454545454546
8085810,1,B000BF0CSO,"This ""biography"" does not really document the presidency of Bill Clinton. It is more focused on the overblown Lewinsky scandal. There is not much talk about his legacy in terms of a booming economy, reduced crime rates, balanced budgets, reduced poverty rates, etc. I was expecting a more complete picture of Bill Clinton. There was no objectivity. All I can say is: Soap Opera Digest.",1367884800,,385,4.938461538461539
8085811,3,B000BF0CSO,"Does cover his life through being president, but so much was taken up with scandals - eg. Whitwater, Paula Jones, Monica, etc. Maybe that really does summarize his life, but I don't think so.",1340409600,,191,4.647058823529412
8085812,2,B000BF0CSO,to short only 50 min . and to mach time on the  Negative not the Positive side of this President and not a lot time spend on early years,1288483200,,136,3.689655172413793
8085813,1,B000BF0CSO,"This is one of the cheapest DVD's you can buy about Bill Clinton and after viewing it, I can understand why. It covers some of his early life in a general sense but it is swattered with sarcastic tones and sensationalized theories about the man and his presidency.....which was covered to an almost nil.
This DVD gave the impression that even after you can graduate from one of the finest Universities in our country, be one of the youngest serving governors ever, twice, get elected President of the United States from sheer obscurity and then re-elected. You can still be called a looser and failure....which is what BIOGRAPHY is when it comes to this DVD.",1285286400,,658,4.730434782608696
8085814,1,B000BF0CSO,"I am a high school history teacher and I was looking for something somewhat useful about the Clinton presidency for the classroom.  This was the cheapest one out there, and well, you get what you pay for.  This is made for shall we say, not overly serious people?  It's all about sensationalism and just a few seconds about the issues the Clinton presidency faced.  I expected more from A & E.  But I've learned my lesson.",1270684800,,422,4.5
8085815,5,B000BF0CSO,"To my very personal opinion, BILL CLINTON was the best president of my generation. I love this documentary but is too short. Only 50 mins. This DVD shows very clearly how the REPUBLICANS wanted him out of office and wanted him out BAD, by showing how KEN STAR spent 70 million of the tax payers money in the republican inpeachment.

But this is the question. How many REPUBLICAN presidents have fooled around with many women, congressman and members of the senate and never made it PUBLIC??????

BILL was a great president. When he left office our country was in great shape which is something we could never say about the the past BUSH administration that left this country in such bad shape I don't know if it will be in shape in my lifetime and Im only 39 years old.

God Bless you BILL for what you did for this country!! Only the elite few know how good of a president you were. I really don't care how many women he slept with because the bottom line is that he did an amazing job with our country.

BILL CLINTON is dearly missed!!

8085816,1,B000BF0CSO,"This dvd is great if you think that Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky were the highlights of the Clinton administration.  There is almost no useful history in this at all.  It borders on tabloid journalism under the guise of a respectable documentary.  Dick Morris is interviewed quite a lot throughout this one.",1235174400,7,328,5.037037037037037
