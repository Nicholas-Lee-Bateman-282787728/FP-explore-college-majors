2831187,5,B000Q66Q56,"I tip my hat to Universal Pictures for, finally, releasing these two classics on DVD. Bordello of Blood tells the story of a wisecracking private-eye named Rafe Guttman who investigates a missing person report at a titilating bordello where the madam & her bevy of beauties want more than your money..they want your blood. Soon, Rafe finds himself up the creek without a paddle in the den of the hungry vampiresses and battling a televangelist named Reverend Jimmy Current who has a talisman & some despicable plans. On the other hand, Demon Knight tells the story of a drifter named Brayker who possesses the last of seven ancient keys that hold the power to stop the forces of darkness and protect all humanity from ultimate evil. The demonic Collector has collected the other six keys and he wants the last. It's up to Brayker and the strong-willed Jeryline to  lead the inhabitants of a run-down hotel in a gruesome battle against the Collector and his evil horde of ghouls & make it out alive. Although the movies are put on the disc alphabetically, they were actually released in reverse. Demon Knight came out in 1995 and was directed by Ernest R. Dickerson. It starred Billy Zane, William Sadler, & Jada Pinkett Smith. It turned out to be a success. Bordello of Blood came out in 1996 and was directed by Gilbert Adler. It starred Dennis Miller, Corey Feldman(The Lost Boys), Erika Eleniak, Chris Sarandon(of Child's Play/Fright Night fame), and Angie Everhart. Willam Sadler & Whoopi Goldberg have cameos in the movie. Sadly, Bordello of Blood didn't do as well as Demon Knight did at the box office and was considered a box-office failure. It is a movie worth watching, however. All vampire movies are worth watching. ;)  Both films are based on the hit HBO television series, ""Tales From The Crypt"" starring John Kassir as the voice of the Cryptkeeper.  I highly recommend these two movies to all Tales From The Crypt fans as well as those who like watching a good spooky movie on a Friday Night. For this low, low price; you can't beat it.",1207267200,,2051,4.739495798319328

2831189,5,B000Q66Q56,Both great movies if you like scary movies with humor and a good ending would highly recommend.,1197936000,,95,4.647058823529412
2831190,4,B000Q66Q56,"With BORDELLO OF BLOOD and DEMON KNIGHT, this dvd offers up in widescreen a fun B-movie double feature bill from the Tales From The Crypt line. Both movies came out in the mid-'90s, during the height of comedian Dennis Miller's success and when William Sadler and Billy Zane were merely mediocre instead of obscure and irrelevant, which is what they are now. The ill-kept and pun-afflicted Crypt Keeper adds much to the campy feel of both flicks as wraparound scenes have him providing ghoulishly humorous intro and post-mortem honors.

I actually saw these two films during their respective theater runs and had a hell of a time with both. DEMON KNIGHT, released in 1995, is a fairly gripping horror action/thriller, low budget sensibilities and cruddy special effects notwithstanding (c'mon, fluorescent green goo?). The story takes place one dark, stormy night in Wormwood, New Mexico as a fleeing man crashes into town. Frank Brayker (William Sadler) is guarding the last of the mystical seven Keys, these keys being ancient relics that together can be harnessed to master the cosmos. The forces of Hell, having already amassed six of the things, now aim to have the last key, and, so, Brayker is on the run from the relentless demon Collector (Billy Zane, who is devilish fun here). But, at last cornered in a broken down church-turned-motel, Brayker prepares for his last stand.

While DEMON KNIGHT has its quirky moments, it still overall espouses the more traditional horror conventions. On the other hand, 1996's BORDELLO OF BLOOD sacrifices its horror elements for its campy sense of humor. This film is decidedly tongue-in-cheeked, thanks muchly to Dennis Miller's wiseacre protagonist. Miller's indifferent approach to his role is typical of how he goes about his sporadic cinematic career. In movies Dennis Miller basically plays himself, and it's no different with BORDELLO OF BLOOD. Miller is irreverent private eye Rafe Guttman, who runs afoul of insiduous (but sexy) she-vampires who suck blood and other objects in a brothel disguised as a seedy funeral home.

It's impossible to take this film seriously (and I'm sure it wasn't meant to), what with Miller's zingers coming so fast and frequently and mockeries like the overzealous evangelist (a stubbled Chris Sarandon) and his Laserlight o' the Lord being trotted out before our eyes. BORDELLO OF BLOOD revels in its cheesiness and is so playfully awful that, frankly, it suckered me into liking it. Not to mention, all the naked girls in the film do not hurt at all as they prove to be as cheeky as Miller, though not in the same way. But there's a definite disconnect between Rafe Guttman and the scary goings-on about him. While Billy Zane is amusing and even magnetic in DEMON KNIGHT, Dennis Miller's character comes off as bemused and overly facetious (although his one-liners are funny). But, no, Miller doesn't at all lend credibility to his role, and maybe that even fits the tone of the film. I had this sense that Miller was trying real hard not to wink at the camera.

Familiar B-list faces dot these two pictures. DEMON KNIGHT offers a supporting cast of CCH Pounder, Thomas Haden Church, a very solid Jada Pinkett (not yet Pinkett-Smith), and an uncredited John Larroquette. BORDELLO OF BLOOD has Angie Everhart as Lilith the head vampiress, Chris Sarandon, and bottom feeder Corey Feldman. Perfectly in line with the star power, we get the dubious special effects, the weak scripts, the flimsy plotlines, the cheap and ineffectual scares, and the heady aroma of cheese. Yet somehow - and maybe it's because both films embrace their low rent, trashy stature with such gusto - BORDELLO OF BLOOD and DEMON KNIGHT contrive to be fun cinematic treats. Or guilty pleasures. Whatever. It's one or the other. Or to quote the very quotable Rafe Guttman: ""I feel like I'm in a bad Tales From The Crypt episode."" And that's good.",1194652800,13,3902,4.970903522205207

Yes, Bordello of Blood has a lot of T&A, and some great looking gals to pull it off. There is also Corey Haim who plays a badass in this. It's a very good movie, not great mind you. Now if you want great, you want Demon Knight, but then how can you go wrong with CCH Pounder, Billy Zane, and William Sadler that's like the A list of B movie actors.",1429488000,,507,3.8846153846153846
2831318,4,B000Q66Q56,"Two solid scarers from the crypt keeper, as only he could deliver them. In 'Bordello of blood', four party hard friends find out about a brothel with the 'best got-damn pu**y you'll ever have!'. But when Corey Feldman's (he's the lead delinquent) uptight, religious sister (Erika Eleniak) gets worried, she hires a detective (Dennis Miller) to find him. But he soon discovers this is no run of the mill brothel, its a Vampire haven! And run by a very powerful and beautiful Vampire (Angie Everhardt). Great from beginning to end with all the sick humor and blood chilling effects that made 'Tales from the crypt' so successful. Also with Chris Sarandon as a TV Preacher. In 'Demon Knight', a powerful demon is chasing a arch angel who is hiding the keys to heaven from him. He takes shelter in a whorehouse, where he and the employees wage war with the demon in order to prevent hell on earth! This one has just as much chill and thrill as you could expect and more from the 'Crypt' series. Both are worth the money.",1427414400,2,1016,4.587912087912088

I figured why not get an extra horror film for about the same price as buying Demon Knight separately so I picked this up. Universal did a poor job on this set, it isn't a terrible DVD but compared to their great job on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-People-Under-the-Stairs-Shocker-Double-Feature/dp/B000N4RAQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The People Under the Stairs / Shocker Double Feature</a>&nbsp;it is simply mediocre. This being said, both films are in Widescreen and even though they have no special features they do have good picture quality and also they are on a one-sided disc instead of a double-sided disc. Universal's other double feature DVD that I provided the link for was on two separate discs. Now lets get to the films. I won't go into the plots because you can just look them up, I am actually going to talk about the films themselves.

Demon Knight: This is easily the best out of the pack and features some great practical effects and solid performances from everybody especially Billy Zane in a very energetic role and you can tell he was having fun. The plot was not weak in my opinion and made for a truly entertaining horror film, while not a perfect horror film by any means if you want to watch a very fun B horror movie than this one is for you. 4/5.

Bordello of Blood: More of a comedy than horror, it is not a bad film and a pretty entertaining one but most of the cast seemed way over-the-top and while that did provide what I assume some unintentional laughter, it was overall disappointing. Dennis Miller is entertaining in his role and it was nice seeing Chris Sarandon in a post Fright Night role. Angie Everhart is smoking hot in her role but she is way overacting and Erika Eleniak is just plain miscast, she would have been better casted as one of the lead vampires. What really brings this film down is the horrible ending, it seemed that the film thought that it was clever and that it had tricked the audience, However, any horror fan(including myself) seen it miles away. 2.5/5.

Overall, buy the set if you are interested or want to own any of these films because the picture quality is pretty good and you are getting the pack for a cheaper price than buying the films separately. Demon Knight is worth multiple re-watches not so much Bordello of Blood though.",1408060800,2,2488,4.822014051522248

2831462,4,B000Q66Q56,"Let me clarify by saying Demon Knight is worth the price and Bordello is an almost throw away, but for collection sake is a small bonus. Demon Knight is an entertaining movie with good actors and some thrilling scenes. I saw this in the theaters with some friends and we felt that we had gotten our money's worth. Billy Zane arguably gives the best performance of his career and everyone else does fairly well, but Zane steals the show. I watched this movie a few months ago and it is a bit dated, some cheese in the special effects, but that is to be expected. I mainly watch it because of Zane and some nostalgia, that period of time was fun and it brings back good memories. The Crypt Keeper is funny and I liked Tales from the Crypt the series.

Bordello of Blood I saw in the theaters by myself and thought it was so-so. It generally got negative reviews, but I thought it wasn't as bad as people said. I am a little biased since I really like vampire tales, but there was a noticeable drop off in acting and writing compared to Demon Knight. This movie should have been a hit considering it was following up the well received Demon Knight. It had everything you could want: vampires, blood, boobs, a hot  hot hot female lead, but it had one fatal flaw a miscast Dennis Miller. He lacked the flare of a Billy Zane and came across a little bland and just couldn't deliver. So when you have that as your lead hero, the movie is going to suffer. If they had gotten someone with better acting skills and who could breathe some life into his character this movie could have been really good, instead of just being OK.

Demon Knight is a four star movie.
Bordello of Blood is a two star movie.

Look at this dvd collection as getting a good film with a mediocre side-kick thrown in as a bonus.",1336348800,,1792,4.324404761904762

2831494,5,B000Q66Q56,"These are my 2 most favorite Tales from the Crypt movies: Bordello of Blood and Demon Knight! When I found them as a double feature I was jumping up and down like an idiot. Billy Zane playing the Demon in Demon Knight is yummy to say the least! Quick summary of the movie: 7 keys were spread out all over the universe, the demons are looking for them, they have 6 keys... the 'hero' has the last one. the 'hero' is being chased by the Demon (Billy Zane) and hides out in an old motel/boarding house with a bunch of degenerates (the drunk, the hooker, the crabby motel owner, the girl out on work release from  prison(Jada Pinket Smith). Lots of things happen, the Demons come and only one is left standing. It's a great movie for what it is.
Bordello of Blood is about a Bordello (inside the basement of a funeral home) of hot vampire chicks, ran by Lillith - who is controlled by... the exact same key thats in the last movie.  Corry Feldman is in this too. The uber-bible thumping- extremely religious sister of Cory FEldman hires a private investigator to help find her brother. he finds a whole lot more. Another great movie if you're just in the mood for some gore and tata's.",1324080000,,1181,4.3881278538812785
2831495,4,B000Q66Q56,"I finally went to see ""Blood"" because I got tired of people passionately telling me that it was one of the worst movies ever.

But maybe I missed the point of the movie --- if there was one. Many of the folks sending in reviews seem to be taking the movie seriously. For me it is one of the all time send-ups of the vampire movie genre. I laughed throuout the movie. Not quite ""Dusk to Dawn"" but a good cast, good scripts, nice camera setups, and excellent direction. And amid the non stop mayhem there's Dennis Miller doing a stand up routine like he was in Las Vegas.

Well, maybe it's not a comedy. But maybe it is. One thing is certain --- it appeals to a wide audience of vastly different tastes and that, in my opinion, is the mark of a good movie.

(And believe it or not it even has a surprise ending.)

Much fun.

2831496,5,B000Q66Q56,I bout this primarily for Demon Knight and it being a double feature was a bonus. Couldn't beat the price,1308096000,,105,4.3
2831497,5,B000Q66Q56,"Two awesome horror comedies,in one awesomely priced double feature set...both movies are great,bordello of blood is pretty much like from dusk till dawn where a bunch of beautiful women lure men into a brothel than feast on them,then there is demon knight(my favorite of the two) in which a man is running from a very powerful demon(played by billy zane..excellently) who wants to get his hands on a key shaped flask with supernatural powers that will then allow the demons to bring on thousands of years of darkness and enslave the human race. Both are great horror comedies,so if you are a fan of the genre you will not be dissapointed.one little peice of info. is that all though the description says two discs, it actually has both movies on one disc.",1296777600,,755,4.7272727272727275
2831498,5,B000Q66Q56,Quick Review _ Bordello of Blood was a joke. Demon Knight was awesome. I like the effects and especially the colorful characters. Everyone seem to have some kind of past or secret and well exploited. Then you have Billy Zane who plays one demon with an odd sense of humor.,1290384000,,272,4.46
2831499,4,B000Q66Q56,"Good Dvd with no special features, Demon Knight is the better of the two, with Billy Zane in it,Jada Pinkett, and some funny scenes besides the horrible gore,It was scary the first time you watch it. Good movie still. other movie is not Bad, Dennis Miller is in this one,Corey Feldman as well. The movie Bordello of Blood is a Brothel full of Hot women who are of course hiding something very sinister. Highly Recommend getting this Dvd.you get both Ghoulish movies for the price of one!",1269043200,6,487,4.609195402298851
2831500,5,B000Q66Q56,"Dennis Miller is hilarious in his usual off-the-cuff way. The story is a hoot, gently mocking the whole vampire genre. The supporting cast is great, with Erika Eleniak playing a cynical client of Dennis Miller's PI who is investigating her case.",1234483200,,245,5.0
2831501,4,B000Q66Q56,"If you're a fan of ""Tales From the Crypt"" then this really is a no-brainer purchase. If you're not a devoted fan, well, that don't matter either 'cause these two cheesy, B-movie old school horror flicks do the trick anyway.

The better movie here is ""Demon Knight"". It's pretty suspenseful and creepy on occasion, it's stylishly filmed, has a decent amount of gore and is chock full of low-brow humor as well. The story here ain't half bad either, with a nice darkness vs. light plot that's fairly well written. Billy Zane is terrific as film's baddy and William Sadler is rock solid as the savior. In short; Very good horror film.

Less impressive overall but nonetheless very entertaining is ""Bordello of Blood"". It's more cheesy and comedy driven but it's fairly gory and atmospheric on occasion. Dennis Miller haters may find less enjoyment here but personally I think he does OK in the lead as the Private Eye who stumbles upon a brothel full of vampires. Also starring here is the criminally underrated Chris Sarandon, who here has a field day with a crazy preacher role.

This double DVD features solid transfers of the films but it's less impressive in the extras department, only offering the original trailers. But this comes recommend to all ""Crypt"" fans and (especially ""Demon Knight"") to all horror film lovers.",1231804800,2,1324,4.849557522123894
