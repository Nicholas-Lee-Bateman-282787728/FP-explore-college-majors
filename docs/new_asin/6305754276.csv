This movie had a good story according to my low-maintanance standards. Lots of family issues. Son hates his mother's boyfriend. Boyfriend beats the mother, the little boy, and threatens to beat the older son. Mother's boyfriend was an alcoholic and had a bad temper.  Two crooked cops were running around a little and they had bad attitudes.  The son, James, worked at a store where him and an Asian girl had a secret relationship. James hung with with some bad friends, and you can see where those bad friends got him in the end of the movie.

This is definitely a good movie that takes place in the streets of Houston, Texas. The movie starts off with a song by Willie D, formerly of the Geto Boys. They also have a reference or two of DJ Screw, one of the most highly respectable DJ's throughout Texas. I'd recommend the movie to people who are not picky when it comes to movies. If you picky, then stick with big budget movies. If you not picky, then check it out.",1110412800,2,1239,4.508928571428571

Anyway, I seen this movie and it is hilarious but I don't think that it was done purposely. The acting is so bad that you can't help buy fall out laughing. In one scene, they were supposed to be stomping on some guy on the ground but the only problem was that their foot never landed on the person. I highly recommend this if you are in the mood for a good comedy.",998352000,3,523,4.038461538461538
7893962,4,6305754276,"While not in the same range as ""Boys in the Hood"" or ""Menace to Society"", a movie that is down to Earth. It featured two things that most movies of this design do not. 1) filmed somewhere other than the standard inner cities that we hear about. It was done in Houston, Texas. 2) The cast of unknowns do a great job of acting. I would rather see movies like this than big budget movies with no plot, overrated directors and booming soundtrack (Belly-anybody?).",977875200,3,459,4.476190476190476
