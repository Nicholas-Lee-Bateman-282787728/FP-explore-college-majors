3520388,3,B000A1INFS,"I liked the film for its exploration of romantic, sexual love versus spiritual love, and how they don't necessarily always coincide, in the person of the main character. I didn't mind the low quality of the picture as the simplicity kept me focused on the inner dialogue of the main character, and it's definitely better than poor reception antenna television.
I felt the earlier ""immoral"" comment in a review suggested nudity and more, but there wasn't anything like that.",1379808000,,473,5.0
3520389,1,B000A1INFS,This looks like a home made film. The sound is poor and the image is bad. The quality made the story seem worse than it is and impossible for me to watch it through the end.,1379030400,5,173,3.8333333333333335
3520390,1,B000A1INFS,This movie is awful and immoral.  I cannot believe I rented it.  It was not a decent movie at all.  I would not recommend watching it.,1377216000,,134,4.076923076923077
3520391,1,B000A1INFS,did not like it all. it was to boring to even watching all the way through to the end of the movie.,1365033600,,99,3.5454545454545454
3520392,2,B000A1INFS,Awful acting.  poor story outline.  Attempts at seduction were so very awkward and robotic.  Not a good representation for French film makers.,1363737600,,142,5.363636363636363
3520393,2,B000A1INFS,"Among my collection this DVD has the worst picture quality. I had expected beautiful pictures underlining a romantic love story. The story itself seems little inspired and even a better technical quality would not add more than one additional star, particularly in consideration of the price.",1168992000,2,292,5.369565217391305

8290201,5,B000A1INFS,It was great story and very interesting.,1417392000,,40,4.857142857142857
8290202,4,B000A1INFS,Very nice portrayal of young woman becoming adult and the power of close friendship.,1405900800,,84,5.071428571428571
8290203,1,B000A1INFS,"What began as a film of promise - good background, storyline - soon displayed amateurish directing and production; too, the repetitive music from Madame Butterfly was inappropriate to certain scenes.  The actors were good enough but could have been better had they a better written script and direction.",1402358400,,303,5.3125
8290204,1,B000A1INFS,"boring waste of time the other character just lusts after her, criticizes her, nothing to see here no real story to draw you in",1395360000,,127,4.333333333333333
8290205,5,B000A1INFS,it is a must see film for you to see for your self and decide if you like it for your self,1391731200,,90,3.1363636363636362
8290206,4,B000A1INFS,"This was a sensitively done exploration of a young Chinese woman's decisions regarding gay or straight love and life (which should have been mentioned in the film summary).  It seemed to end abruptly without some issues resolved, i.e. whether she loved the Parisian woman for herself or because she could understand her art.  It was worth watching and thinking about.",1385510400,2,367,5.1
8290207,5,B000A1INFS,What a beautiful and thoughtful exploration of human nature.  I love the poetic spiritual passages as the main character reflects on her life.,1384214400,2,142,5.173913043478261
