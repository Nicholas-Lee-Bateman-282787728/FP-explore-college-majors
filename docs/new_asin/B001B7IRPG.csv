I also highly recommend his book by the same title as this series, and his fascinating ""Incredible Creatures That Defy Evolution"" series.",1394323200,,310,5.3061224489795915

8282156,4,B001B7IRPG,"I just saw Incredible Creatures that Defy Evolution, and enjoyed Dr. Martin's speech, he seemed very knowledgeable and eloquent.  It is clear to me that Christ's followers will be mocked, criticized and labeled as ignorants for their beliefs.  The teaching of the Bible, is to believe God's Word, even before leaning on one's understanding, if it says 6 days, and one believes it, then that's what it means to be a Believer.  This things are simple, but they are hidden from those who do not believe God's Word, and instead replace it with theories based on their understanding.  I haven't seen these videos, but I applaud those who stand in the teaching of the Truth, I may not understand the whole Bible, but that's no reason for me to make up my own theories, and rank them as more feasible than a Bible verse, wouldn't that defeat the whole Believer thing?",1298073600,5,860,4.675496688741722
