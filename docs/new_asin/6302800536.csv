515818,4,6302800536,A great movie with few slow spots.  My family enjoyed this film tremendlously.  My mom who usually doesn't like Red Skeleton (although she respects him highly) laughed at many of the scenes.  My brothers children (and mine too) laughed aloud.  They can't wait for another Red Skeleton movie.  This was a favorite when I was a child and it still is today.,1005782400,4,354,4.645161290322581
515819,5,6302800536,"Most remember Red Skelton for His weekly, self named, show that came on television so many moons ago. Unfortunaltely, many do not know that he also had a terrific film career that spun many hits and sequals. I as one simple fan, would like send my heart out to his family for his memory. Red Skelton did stand-up comedy long into his golden years, and always got big laughs. (Frogs....Frogs...anyone?) In The Fuller Brush Man, Red plays a man in love with a beautiful girl named Ann. He jumps from job to job, but brags that he worked for the fire department for 2 whole weeks! As a street-cleaner he smashes the Commisioners car and ends up becoming bugsplat wiper-bait on his windshield. One liner after another surrounding a great mystery makes The Fuller Brush Man a video that must be on your shelf. After the carsmashing incident, Ann decides to give Red one more chance to redeem himself before entirely surrendering her love. If he fails, then she moves on to another man. This makes Red bound and determined to succeed both as, you guessed it, a fuller brush man, and the one to win the heart of his Love, Ann. Fuller Brush man was introduced to me many years ago, and was excited when I found it on Amazon! I ordered it on the spot! You won't be displeased if you do the same.",996105600,6,1286,4.453389830508475
515820,5,6302800536,"Red Skelton was the comic that simply billed himself as ""One of America's Clowns""..actually I felt he was The..Best! Red would brag that he could make all audience ages laugh without using a dirty joke. He did it on radio,TV and in the movies ...and at personal appearances..for many-years. This film  is full of sight gags, wonderful fun  dialogue, and especially slapstick and a wild chase. What else would you want in a comedy movie? Jim Carey said he studied Red's old movies. And this one is a text-book on how to make people laugh. Made many years ago, it holds up so superbly today.",971740800,9,589,4.6

515865,5,6302800536,"One of Red's best movies.  Most people only think of him as the TV clown but Red Skelton made several great movies and was a player in many more.  His character's are similar to the ones Bob Hope played, always there is a beautiful woman and a straight man or two.  Red's comedic timing is without a doubt as good as anyone's ever was and his characters are almost always endearing.

515919,5,6302800536,Extremely funny Red Skelton comedy.  He plays the title character who becomes the prime suspect in the murder of an almost customer he had an altercation with.  The other suspects do their best to fob all the suspicion on him.  The suspects in the kitchen scene is great but the warehouse chase is hilarious.  Great comedy.  The Columbia Pictures DVD-R release is the one to get.  The quality is fine.  Highly recommended.,1392595200,,422,4.777777777777778
515920,1,6302800536,"As stated earlier, Reds best work was as a supporting actor and in his own television show where he was beloved throughout America.

516018,3,6302800536,the quality was good until the last 10 minutes of the film where it breaks up; you can not see the ending of the movie. evidently when the dvd was recorded from the vhs format there were no quality checks,1327190400,,204,4.125
516019,5,6302800536,"I've been waiting for this DVD since I first got a DVD player. Mr Skelton, the most American (and original) of slapstick comedians, was at the top of his form in ""The Fuller Brush Man"". Lots of fun intrigue, silliness, and good vs evil stuff going on. Red made a lot of films, many as a supporting player in many Esther Williams films, but when he went off on his own, he commanded the screen with confidence and energy to spare.

His TV show was a hit in our home when I was growing up, solid, wholesome humor, never giving in to raunch, as so many other good comedians found necessary. Red Skelton's brand of humor can be appreciated by everyone, young and old.

I'm waiting to order this DVD (DVD-R; printed on-demand) to see if the quality is better than simply a VHS put to DVD.
I will always love this film.

An afterthought: I have no objection to raunchy humor. It's just that with Skelton, you always knew that you could watch him with the kids in the room.

UPDATE: I broke down and ordered the DVD; glad I did. No complaints, very watchable, no problems. As funny as I remembered.",1326931200,,1091,4.359605911330049

516054,5,6302800536,"Red Skelton made many feature films in the 40s and 50s that were absolutely hilarious. I think that ""The Fuller Brush Man"" is the
best of the bunch. Red becomes a door to door salesman for the Fuller Brush Company. He has been set up to fail by being given the
worst sales territory that can be imagined. Skelton`s character is so inept that failure is a good bet at the best of times. But
if nothing else he is enthusiastic and persistent, making his sales calls a fun romp of classic comedy.
But the fun really starts when he is framed for murder.",1265414400,2,549,4.288461538461538

516056,4,6302800536,"Wow, this movie wore me out. It was almost non-stop slapstick action....actually too much; it could have used some lulls. Still, there were tons of funny moments.

Red Skeleton, in the starring role, provides most of the laughs with some corny-but-great lines and wonderful slapstick sight gags. Red, himself, must have been exhausted making this film.

My favorite parts were in the beginning when he gives door-to-door selling a chance. His mentor and nemesis ""Keenan"" (Don McGuire), sets him up with the worst houses on the block and poor Red takes a verbal and physical beating, even from a little kid! It's actually painful to see such a nice guy, such an Innocent human being, get treated so poorly by everyone. He can't catch a break, including making points with his wannabe girlfriend ""Ann"" (Janet Blair).

****possible spoilers****  The break comes, of course, at the end and after a lot of chaos when Red inadvertently becomes involved in a murder and has to clear his name. You know Red, somehow, is going to pull through a ton of messy situations, even though it looks bad for him at least a hundred times!

This film, and ""The Fuller Brush Girl"" with Lucille Ball and Eddie Albert, have never been put on DVDs and that's a shame. It would make a nice double-feature disc.",1242950400,,1285,4.77027027027027

His simple, charming, often self-effacing humor is something you could show to a young child and not be worried about corrupting influences.  His comedy was always clean and fun.

Unfortunately, this is on VHS, so the market supply is limited.  I hope they put all of his movies on DVD soon.  A comic genius like Red Skelton needs to be introduced to a new generation.",1190246400,,491,4.662790697674419

I laughed like an idiot back then and it's just about as funny today. Here is a movie you can watch with your kids and not have to worry about sex, violence and bad language. Really, think about it, how many movies can you say that about today. I really like the fact that Red Skelton never went dirty in his humor and when you see this film, you will know why he never had to - he was a great physical comedian. And despite the age of the movie, today's kids will actually get the gags.  Unlike the Stooges, the slap stick scenes are fast paced and often done on a grand scale (there is a great chase sequence in a warehouse that is priceless). The thing about slap stick, when done right, is that once you get laughing, you're hooked. The plot is classic '40s good vs. evil and unlike a lot of movies today, good wins. And the bad guys go to jail. And Red gets the girl. And they live happily ever after. If you have kids or are a big kid yourself, do yourself a favor and order this one.

The sketches are generally funny and inventive, with Skelton on the receiving end of the ""mean widdle kid"" for a change. There was a rash of these occupation based comedies in the late 40's, including  Fuller Brush Girl (Lucille Ball honing her slapstick), Yellow Cab Man (Skelton with fewer laughs), and The Good Humor Man (Jack Carson mugging and double-taking at the same time). Most end with whirl-wind chases through commodity laden storehouses that seem to mirror the nation's growing prosperity and surging spirit.
