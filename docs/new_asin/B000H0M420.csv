8135562,5,B000H0M420,"Love this short documentary. Gives a excellent analysis on Robin Hood. Better than the one later one with Russell Crowe, that one was just to promote Ridley Scott's new movie.",1472774400,,175,4.866666666666666
8135563,4,B000H0M420,"Everyone knows the legend of Robin Hood, but was it based on a real person?  And if so, does the legend hold true?

This documentary explores these questions, as well as other tidbits about the time period that I found quite interesting.  For example, I have read of ha'pennies and farthings often, but I did not know anything more than that they were a smaller form of currency.  But now I know exactly what they are!

The other reviewer is right, in that they don't go into a whole lot of detail, but the reason for that, as it's explained in the documentary, is that scholars still have a lot of work to do on the oldest documents of Robin Hood.  They've been read, but not really studied as other medieval literature, such as the legends King Arthur, have.  However, they do have a few 'suspects' in old records for who might be the real Robin Hood!

The documentary also goes into current attitudes in England (which are interesting, the two different towns that Robin Hood could have 'belonged' to argue over him!), and we even get a chance to hear from the current Sheriff of Nottingham!  We get to see some of the annual Robin Hood festivals held over in England.  (I want to go!)

Overall, a fun and interesting documentary.  You might not learn a whole lot of new material, but this will help you add depth to the knowledge you do have.",1264204800,10,1346,4.448979591836735
8135564,1,B000H0M420,"""True story?? Very few facts and a lot of unsubstantiated speculation about the real Robin Hood.  Too much repeated material.  I felt the sales material was misleading.  I am not glad that I purchased it other than to check it out.",1256688000,,231,4.585365853658536
8135565,3,B000H0M420,"This documentary reviews the legend of Robin Hood.  In it, there is debate on if Robin Hood was real, who he might have been, and where he actually might have lived.  Did he live in Nottinghamshire, where Robin is comingly attached?  Or did he live in Barnsdale located in Yorkshire?  If you know very little about Robin Hood, then this is a great documentary, and you might not know as much as you think...",1172793600,9,407,4.45945945945946
8135566,5,B000H0M420,"In the 1930's Al capone ruled all in chicago. He was untouchable, but Eliet ness and his Team proved to be the real untouchables!
from the untouchables there have been 2 TV shows, 1 theatrical films, and numerous other prints and film. few of them are very true. This was the most accurate storie of the untouchables. the great Histories mysteries series made one of it's best peices of work when then made this special. It describes Capone's early rain of power, how Ness and the untouchables took him down and everything in between.
from the bomb that was supposubly planted in Ness's car to the attempted ""High-speed payoff of 2 of the untouchables. It descibes what really happened, who Ness chose, what happened at every end and even what became of Ness and his men1
excellent! a must for anyone who is a fan of gangsters, the untouchables or Al capone films.",1016755200,8,864,4.65359477124183
