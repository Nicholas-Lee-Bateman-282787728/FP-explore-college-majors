8619328,5,B003BFQEWY,"The video reveals the finer points of throwing the javelin. Not suitable for beginners as it does not dwell on the basics but highly recommended for intermediate to advance throwers who wish to polish their throwing techniques. Tom Putskys is a good coach and cleverly uses Mike Hazle to demonstrate and explains how he feels and what goes on in his mind when doing the exercises and practising the techniques. Overall, it is an excellent video as not many coaches are able to present and explain as well as Tom Putskys. Two Thumbs Up!",1406505600,,535,4.702127659574468
