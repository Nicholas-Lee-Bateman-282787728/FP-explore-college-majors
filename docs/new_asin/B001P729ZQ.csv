Amazon has that DVD for less than half the price of this one.  Scholastic put all of the videos on this DVD on that DVD, except for The Talking Eggs--and you'll get 15 additional scholastic stories.  So, unless you are specifically looking for The Talking Eggs, there is no reason to buy this DVD rather than that one.
Now about the stories on this DVD
1. Rapunzel - There is no animation.  The camera just pans the illustrations from the book.  My experience as a children's librarian is that children don't like these static videos.  Also, be aware that this is the original version of the story, which is much darker in tone than the happily ever after story most people know.  It's not a bad story, but may not be what you were expecting.
2.  The Elves and the Shoemaker - This is another one where the camera just pans a still illustration.  The pictures are wonderful, and Patrick Stewart does a terrific job of reading the story, but the static pictures keep the video from being as good as it could be.
3.  The Talking Eggs - Even though the title of this DVD is Rapunzel and Other Classic Fairytales, this isn't at all a classic.  It's a retelling set in an urban world.  A little girl meets a poor old lady who gives her some magic eggs.
4.  The Three Billy Goats Gruff - Yet another one that has still illustrations panned by the camera.  Good story, but I really wish they would put the money into animation.
5. Lon Po Po - This story is basically a Chinese version of Little Red Riding Hood.  This has a dark, scary overtone, which kids love.
6.  Princess Furball - This is a great story about a Princess who really knows how to take care of herself.  Unfortunately, it's another one with static pictures.  It's still good.",1465516800,,1869,4.463126843657817

8332352,4,B001P729ZQ,"I really like this dvd, as do my kids (4 and 6). I guess I don't mind them being exposed to a little sadness, though, unlike the above reviewer. I'm the kind of person who prefers real fairy tales over rewritten ones and have done since I learned to read, so take that into account. This dvd is pretty mild in my mind. A little sadness makes a child more empathetic and gives him/her perspective on how hard his/her hardships really are. It did for me. When I was four, my parents sponsored 30 Cambodian refugees who were missing limbs and family members from land mines they encountered in their flight from Cambodia. When I think things are hard, I think of those refugees and realize that, no, they really aren't.",1381968000,4,716,4.473282442748092
8332353,2,B001P729ZQ,"I checked this video out from the library hoping for a fun collection of stories.  It was not at all what I expected.

There are several stories on this video.  The first was Rapunzel.  After a few minutes, I fast forwarded to the next story. (beware of spoilers ahead) Rapunzel was always a simple story to me. After watching the video, I looked up the tale of Rapunzel and discovered that this retelling by Zelinsky aligns with the story the Grimms told. If your child loved Tangled, I wouldn't read them this story--particularly if they are very young. In this retelling, the prince finds Rapunzel in a tower. One day when the witch comes to see her, she asks her loosen her dress because it was too tight. The witch responds that she's a wicked girl and casts her out into the wilderness--where she gives birth to twins! This retelling was not at all what I expected and wouldn't recommend. I love fairy tales, but we're going to pass on this one.

The next story was the Elves and The Shoemaker.  This story was just fine--it's a traditional retelling.  It's just the story you're expecting.

The next story was The Talking Eggs.  My children did not enjoy this story and were saddened by the first few scenes, so again we fast forwarded.

The other stories were The Three Billy Goats Gruff, Lon Po Po, and Princess Furball.  All three of these stories were fine.

These are not animated stories.  Scholastic has taken the illustrations from these books and then put the text on the screen as the stories are retold.  For the most part, this DVD is fine.  But, usually I prefer to purchase videos in which we like all of the stories and in this case we only liked 4 of the 6 stories (and had major issues with one of them).  I just wanted to write this review to give you a heads up about the stories on this DVD.",1329955200,6,1818,4.430722891566265
