568673,4,6303122884,"It seems that most of the Muppets disks are 2 out of 3 affairs- 2 good or great episodes, and one mediocre one. Sellers and Cleese are fabulous- the Sellers episode alone is worth getting the disk- but the Moore episode is just kind of flat, and his numbers aren't very interesting.

I have not had the disk problems that other reviewers seem to have. The audio on my disks is fine, and they play fine.

It is a shame that there isn't more ""bonus material"" on these disks, considering the price; they could be great ads for modern Muppet projects.",1092787200,8,547,4.405940594059406
568674,3,6303122884,"Since Childhood I have loved the Muppet Show (never missed one!) so I was very excited to start my daughter on the show.  The material of Jim Henson can't be matched but I was SO dissappointed with the Quality of the DVD.  I can barely get the thing to play, and when it does play there are several skips and digital ""mess ups"" throughout the DVD. I thought it was just a bad copy so I bought another brand new one only to experience the same problems, next time I'll go back to good ole video!",1075680000,5,494,4.135416666666667
568675,5,6303122884,"I own four Best of the Muppet Show. There's always an episode that you semi liked or just didn't like and the rest were wonderful.
This DVD was all wonderful. The three actors were funny, even Dudley Moore and I'm not too fond of him. Peter Sellers was the best, he is an outstanding comedian who fits in so well with the spirit and humor of the muppets. From being a gypsy to a singing preacher it was great.
John Cleese is always funny, his skit in Pigs in Space as a pirate from the 1600's with a jealous parrot always nagging him as he tries to take over the Swinetrek is a hoot.
Dudley Moore's was the least outrageous but it had it's moments. Especially when the Muppet band was out for blood when Dudley brings in a mechanical music replacment for them. I really enjoy the episode.
This is so worth 5 stars. I will enjoy it a lot.",1072396800,13,837,4.204968944099379
568676,5,6303122884,"It's astonishing to see Peter Sellers, arguably one of the best actors of all time, working so gamely with the Muppets. Like the chameleon that he is, Sellers throws himself into each sketch that he performs, be it as Boris the beleaguered gypsy musician, a Strangelove-esque masseuse who leaves Link Hogthrob tied up in knots, or even as himself, whispering quietly to Kermit that he has had the real himself surgically removed, then playing a pair of tuned chickens under his armpits while reciting the ""winter of discontent"" speech from Richard III. Positively fascinating.
Cleese, too, is a scream, especially as a sea pirate who has lost his way on ""Pigs In Space.""
Moore's show is apparently trying to send a message that was crucial at the time, but those not in on the joke are not going to get it as well. It's fun to watch Dudley at odds with Animal, though.
And in ""Muppet Extras,"" be sure to click on ""Movie Mania,"" for a [take-off] of ""The Godfather"" that is a sight to behold.",1047772800,25,990,4.630681818181818
568677,3,6303122884,"I saw this episode when it originally aired in the states. Although Vincent Price does appear, the real guest for this one was Alice Cooper. Setting aside the shock-effect of his concerts, Alice and crew went for truly monster-laughs. Using Alice's ""Welcome to My Nightmare"" to  set the mood, Jim Henson and company had the perfect opportunity to go wild  with the camp-scare monsters. This must be the most fun episode of the  Muppet Show ever done. Alice Cooper fans have been tracking this one down  wherever possible. When it's available again, don't miss it!

568738,5,6303122884,Enjoyed Jim Henson son's comments.  I also enjoyed the trip into humor kids and adults could enjoy.  Look forward to more of the Muppett Show.,1384560000,,142,4.64

568741,4,6303122884,I purchased this as a birthday gift and couldn't have been happier. The product was just as it said it was and the price was great. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is wanting to have a few laughs.,1314144000,,205,4.024390243902439

568743,4,6303122884,"I bought this as a gift for my four year old nephew.  I didn't know who would like it more, him or his mom.  As it turns out the whole family has enjoyed it, especially my 8 year old nephew.  Some reviews mentioned that the kids don't enjoy it because they don't know who the guest hosts are but I have to say in our case that wasn't an issue.  Actually I'm pretty sure I had no idea who Peter Sellers was when the show originally aired.  It is a classic for the whole family to enjoy.",1289001600,,485,3.9587628865979383
568744,5,6303122884,This is an older tape that was a little hard to find. It came very quickly with good communication. It is in excellent condition too! Thanks for the great transaction!,1247616000,,167,4.6
568745,2,6303122884,"When I was a child, I remember that very few things filled me up with such excitement and anticipation as when I was eagerly awaiting the latest episode of ""The Muppet Show"" to screen on tv after a hard day's slog at school.  However, it's amazing sometimes when you grow up and then look back at some of the things that you really enjoyed when you were a kid and then realise that they weren't quite as great as you thought.

This collection of episodes with the exception of what is by far the best one here, Dudley Moore's episode, doesn't age well at all. There is no denying the comedic genius of both Sellers and Cleese, however, either the material they had to work with was extremely poor or they were just unmotivated and it seemed to me, especially where Sellers and Cleese are concerned that they were totally uninterested and were only willing to put in the minimum of effort to fulfil a gig that their agent set for them.  The jokes for those two episodes while they may have made me laugh as a child are now so poor that I actually found myself squirming in my seat just hoping that they would put me out of my agony by ending post haste.

Dudley Moore's time at bat was a notable exception as he genuinely was funny and most of his jokes and skits actually age well and perhaps just for his work, this DVD may just well be worth the purchase price.  He actually looked like he gave a damn and was applying himself.  Could it be that he was a relatively new actor at the time as compared to Sellers and Cleese and so wanted to impress?  In any case, he showed he had a special talent for vaudevillian shows which is what the Muppet Show really is and I thoroughly enjoyed his episode.  I actually hated him in ""Arthur"" but strangely enough my perception of him and his talents changed after viewing this episode.  Great comedian and great musician too.

The picture quality is so poor that it's barely above VHS quality and the sound quality is not remastered well enough coming without any Surround Sound option, DTS with THX or Dolby 5.1 although whose of you with Pro Logic would have it a little better.  Really for a 25th anniversary edition, you'd think they would give this project a little more respect and restore both the visual and sound quality for posterity like Disney did for their other projects such as ""Fantasia"" and ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" but they didn't even bother here.  There are no special features of note here at all except for trailers of other movies where ironically the sound and picture quality for these are far, far better than for the main episodes.

Still for fans of the show who want a little token to remind them of the good old days without having to buy the complete episodes, this may just be it except that there may just be other editions with better episodes than this one where only the Dudley Moore episode is worthy of the tag ""best of"" here.  Ironically, you can't judge the quality of the episodes based solely on the reputation of the guests at that time.

Not recommended.",1207440000,,3048,4.447037701974866
568746,5,6303122884,"The Muppets are a great children's/adult/anyone can watch tv series.  People, young and old, enjoy the witty, slapstick humor that is present in all of the episodes.  The Talent that Jim Hensen has to perform with all these charachters, as well as the time it takes to put on a great variety show (even if they are muppet charachters) it takes a scheme and technique in order to have everything work well.  THis is a great buy and you and your kids will laugh like it was the first time all over again.",1107302400,2,502,4.376344086021505
568747,5,6303122884,"Cheesy title, I know, but the aforementioned poor audio quality and lack of special features simply don't take away from the biggest selling feature of this DVD: Peter Sellers.  I love John Cleese, and Dudley Moore is also talented man, but of the 3 episodes on here, Peter Sellers simply shines.  Must be seen.",1103673600,4,311,4.7407407407407405

7838594,3,6303122884,"When this tape was originally released in 1994 it was the equivalence of gold to muppet fans, finally muppet show episodes could be watched in its entirety even if there were only two. Now, 2 muppet show episodes on VHS for over $12, that is a rip off bigtime. Nowadays, this is not a good buy for the listed price. While both episodes are awesome especially the Alice Cooper one, this is a big scam. You are much better off buying The Muppet Show: The Complete First Season DVD for at most $25 at stores including tax, and that has the Vincent Price episode along with 23 more muppet show episodes plus the original pilot and pitch reel as well pop up behind the scene facts and the original promo gag reel for only double what you would pay for this lousy VHS tape or The Muppet Show Season 3 for about the same price as Season 1 which includes the Alice Cooper episode as well as 23 more episodes, and is loaded with special features. Also, this tape has cuts. The Vincent Price episode does not have the Talking Houses Sketch, the I'm Looking Through You number, and the You've Got a Friend number, in total that is 4 minutes and 49 seconds of the episode cut when in the season one DVD only 2 minutes and 34 seconds of the episode is cut. The Alice Cooper episode is without the Somewhere Over the Rainbow song which is 2 minutes cut, when on the season 3 DVD nothing is cut. Unless you come across this VHS tape at a thrift store for $1 or $2 at most then this is not a good buy.",1413676800,,1485,4.2140350877192985
