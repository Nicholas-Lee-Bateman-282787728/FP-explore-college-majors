The animation and sound are wonderful, and I'd like to mention that they did a great job dubbing the anime. Some dubs make me cringe but this one was very faithful to the original, and the voice actors were perfect in their roles.

Unfortunately the 13th episode leaves the viewer hanging -- believe me, you want to see MORE, but who knows when Synch-Point is going to finish the fourth volume -- IF they finish the fourth volume. I hope it comes out soon.",1143676800,,658,4.429752066115703
8041606,5,B0006HBJK2,"I find myself agreeing with the previous reviewer, I'm Gonna Be An Angel does continue to get better and shows the promise of being one of those guilty pleasure favorite series that you just can't quite place in any one category. As it does range from very dark and serious to almost over the top kids Saturday Morning Cartoon fair.

Personally I loved this volume, as much more of the story of Natsume comes to light, particularly about her brother and why she is so sure no one can fly. These episodes are a nice change as they do bring forward a character that up until now was always mentioned and almost always present but was not really that well known, so for that reason alone this disc is worth picking up.

It is also true, and I once again agree, that the unfortunate under exposure this series received in stores (after volume 1 I am not sure I saw any of the other volumes in more then my local comic shop that carries are sorts of hard to find anime) has lead to few people knowing about this wonderful series. It is one that I think starting with any volume, even this one, should instantly hook the viewer making them a fan of this great series, and as such deserves much more notice then it has gotten so far.

All of this said, with Synch-Point once again putting this series on hiatus and talk the next 13 episodes might never come out for a time if at all, and I too having only seen this volume in two physical stores I am left with a feeling that all these previous 13 episodes have just be a tease, but enough of one to whet the appetite and leave me hoping that the rumors Synch-Point might release the rest of this series in a bundle of remaining volumes all at once, is true. Therefore, even if this is the last volume of this series to be released, I still think it is worth picking up, as what is out is wonderful and good to watch on its own, though of course I truly hope the rest of the series does see release sooner then later.",1140220800,2,1960,4.235294117647059
8041607,4,B0006HBJK2,"I'm Gonna Be An Angel just keeps getting better.  This volume takes us to the middle of the series and things get pretty dark and creepy, especially when you consider that the series features day-glo mecha that look like Fisher-Price creations and a bubbly, perky wanna-be angel.

The first episode on the disk is a bizarre attempt by Dispel to drive a wedge between Noelle and Yuusuke with a pet that's nice to Noelle and rude and destructive to anyone else.  It's just odd.  But the next three episodes are a fascinating arc that tells us a lot more about Natsume.  The ending really makes me want to see more.

Unfortunately, Synchpoint is the slowest anime company on Earth.  I'd give this disk five stars if I thought the next disk would come out in a reasonable amount of time.  I have yet to see Volume 3 in a physical retail store, because this wonderful series has been forgotten due to the great gaps between release dates.  When other, longer series can be released in their entirety between volumes of this series, something is not right.

I want the rest of the series and I don't want to wait years to get it!",1105920000,9,1123,4.487684729064039
