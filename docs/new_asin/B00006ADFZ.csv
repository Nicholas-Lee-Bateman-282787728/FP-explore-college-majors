The film was very well put together. Cinematography was excellent as well as the acting and directing. It's a shame that hellraiser bloodline made theaters and this didn't. I like the new direction for the series. It played with my head, I enjoyed the ride. If you like dark horror thrillers this is for you. If you are into corny campy ""horror"" pick up jason X.

1736747,3,B00006ADFZ,"Well for those of you who have followed my reviews on the uk site (if they ever got posted) this is the promised review of the newest Hellraiser entry. Hellseeker.
This is a real tough review to do. As most of you will of realised and appreciated by now - the majority of horror films should always be rated on a different scale to that of normal films. There general crassness is something that can be savoured and enjoyed when pulle doff with cetain panache, or compensated for with wonderful characters such as this series Pinhead. The problem here, lies in the fact that it is still a far slicker, smoother, and downright better film than most horror flicks (and especially the poor status of most of this trashy but fun saga). But despite this - the movie lacks any true soul. Or evena r eal sense that the film-makers were really enjoying themselves.
The story itself is the main problem. It would be fine if it wasn't for the fact that it is sooooo damn close to the previous chapter Hellraiser: Inferno. and whether you hate it or love it (personally i found it by far the greatest Hellraiser film up there with the original)Inferno undoubtably boasted originality, style, and a brave sense of direction. This film is handled with the same amount of watchable intrigue, and i never really got bored, but the whole thing should of been made later on...maybe in a couple of sequels time - to distance itself from Inferno.
For Pinhead lovers, beware...he turns up here about as much as in Inferno, but delivers his usual panache in the form of Doug Bradly (starting to get a little too old for the role now maybe?? but hell - i love him). He does seem to be growing slightly less scary with each outing however.
The return of Kirsty Cotton is a welcome one, even if we don't see much of her either....her most enjoyable moment being the obvious set up at the end that leaves the film open to what could be some damn fine sequels (rumours are - they're trying to fiml Hellraiser 7 and 8 back-to-back...so here's hoping they're actually meant to be seen together as a double bill with the return of Kirsty vs Pinhead).
The director (although this is his first feature film) handle sit all finely enough - having worked on manymany good and bad horrorfilms (including the director of photography on the likes of House On Haunted Hill and Valentine) his eye for colours and contrast shines through, and whilst its still all a little untextured , its far better than most of the films he's merely collabarated on.
The DVD is good. With a crisp widescreen presentation and 5.1. surround, a bunch of trailers (though none for the film - as usual...come on dimension !) some pointless alternate takes, a brief look at the special effects and a commentary by the director. Oh - and by far the finest typography design on the front cover of the whole series ! It matter to me !
So then - a mixed bag. For a quick glance to my reviews of the whole series...check out my stared guide below....and until next time....send e-mails to dimension to make them make the double-bill !..
Hellraiser ...1/2 (sheer originality but slightly dated)
Hellraiser 2 : Hellbound ... (crass and tacky)
Hellraiser 3 : Hell On Earth ...(stupid but fun in a daft way)
Hellraiser : Bloodline ... (a mix of good and really,really bad)
Hellraiser : Inferno ...1/2 (a masterfull chapter, fantastic)
Hellraiser : Hellseeker ... (an adept but unoriginal telling)",1034640000,7,3428,4.630541871921182
1736748,3,B00006ADFZ,"I was suprised by this movie.  While it is far from great, it is an enjoyable little horror flick.  There is enough gore to please fans of the original (no skinless people, but plenty of other goodies).  Plus the hero from the first two movies is brought back, and although people may think at first that it was a cheap shot to have her in the film (a majority of her scenes are short flashbacks), but the ending makes up for that.  I actually enjoyed this a little more than the original (to be honest Hellraiser was a mediocre film to begin with).  A good rental, and a deffinate by for fans (Pinhead actually is in this movie more than the original and WAY more than the film before this.)",1034553600,2,692,4.292307692307692
1736749,2,B00006ADFZ,"I really can't believe what has happened to this series. I was eagerly awaiting this film like most fans of the other films after the dissapointment of Hellraiser 5, and the promise of Ashley Laurence (Kirsty) staring again just made it sound even better. The only problem, just like before in Hellraiser 5 the writer decided to go with a weird twisty detective story that didn't really explain anything new about the box or the cenobites. As a matter of fact you hardly ever see the cenobites let alone Kirsty. There isn't really any of the trademark gore or anything that will remotely frighten you, which I thought was kind of the point of these films.
The only reason I didn't give this film one star was that in the last couple of scenes we actually get to see Pinhead with his chains, and in one of the additional scenes in the bonus section of the DVD; Kirsty in a deja-vu scene with Pinhead, Chatterer and a few other cenobites where she strikes a deal with them again.
As with the other Hellraiser DVD's there isn't much in the way of amazing special features, and to any Hellraiser fans reading this you'll probably want this film like I did to complete your series, but like the last film your probably going to watch it once and then let it sit on a shelf to gather dust.
I really do hope this film is the last, it should have ended with Hellraiser 4...this WON'T tear your soul apart!",1034553600,3,1397,4.439688715953308

Much like INFERNO, trevor must find the answers to what really happened to kirsty as her body is not found and what is really happening to him. Once again Pinhead and crew have a small role and in the end we all learn the twisted truth about kirsty and her relationship to trevor as reality is turned upsidedown and nothing is as it seems.  Trevor must face his past that he has ""forgoten"" as kirsty has her revenge for all the heck shes been though.  The truth about how kirsty has been changed since HELLRAISER:HELLBOUND is shown and her true relationship to Pinhead and crew is brought to the forefront.

1736771,4,B00006ADFZ,"Overall, I was pleased with this as a direct-to-DVD horror film, but maybe disappointed as a major Hellraiser fan.  In either case, I'd still recommend it.  But only AFTER seeing all of its predecessors.

***************How it fits in the franchise***************

Directed by Rick Bota (Haven, Hellraiser VII-VIII), this sixth installment to the Hellraiser franchise follows in Inferno's (2000) footsteps by presenting another stand-alone story.  Hellraiser was a dark chamber thriller fueled by lustful desire, Hellbound more of a curious exploration of Barkers Hell-ish Labyrinth and his Cenobites, Hell on Earth was a troped-up action/horror movie chronicling Pinheads own escape from Hell, Bloodline was an anthology story illustrating the creation and lineage of the Puzzle Box, Inferno a crime thriller neatly packaged in the dark trappings of the Puzzle Box, and now we find yet another murder-mystery crime thriller. There is an admittedly significant drop in quality in the third and fourth films from the original two, and yet another such drop for the fifth and this sixth direct-to-video installments, but it remains comforting that we never seem to find the same story recycled and retold with different victims.

A major fault of Hell on Earth and Bloodline was the nuisance of over-exposition. I didn't find that to be a problem here.  But the most noticeable flaw was that this sixth franchise story is the first not to expand the Hellraiser mythology, rather operating on the same theme as Inferno. Whereas parts 1-4 revolve around the Box or Pinhead (Doug Bradley), parts 5-6 are illustrative of what experiences befall those damned souls who open the Box. As a result, we see much less of Pinhead and focus more on our curious and potentially damned soul. Trevor's journey begins as a rational investigation fogged by amnesia, shifts to something supernatural and psychologically pervasive, and ultimately steers us into what feels like a surreal dreamscape of his life.

Parts 1-3 of this franchise should be watched in order.  After seeing them, there seems to be no consequence to 4-6 out of order aside from the fact that Bloodline is much better than 5 or 6. This film is nothing special, nor is it even a good Hellraiser story. But I take it for what it is and appreciate of it what I can. I didn't regret watching it.

***************Review***************

After suffering a car accident and losing his wife Kirsty (Ashley Laurence; Hellraiser I-II, Lurking Fear), Trevor (Dean Winters; John Wick) awakens in a hospital mostly amnesiac and, for what he can remember, his story strangely doesn't match the police.

As if a mix of post-traumatic stress and disorientation, flashbacks and hallucinations occur in the form of brutally macabre surgical scenes, fond memories of his wife, scenes of infidelity and nightmare-like fever dream sequences of vomiting live lampreys, brutal beatings, murder scenes and electrocutions.

Pleasure and lust have always had a place in Clive Barker's Hellraiser canon but much as we saw in Inferno (2000), director Rick Bota (Haven, Hellraiser VII-VIII) takes a less inspired path to include such content in the form of affairs and intra-office trysts.  It's as if Trevor was being haunted by his mistresses although he has no memory of their exploits or drive to continue them.  Voyeurism becomes a new theme as well, and long-drawn creep factors have been replaced by loud noisy jump scares that abound in the form of barking pitbulls and drowning specters in vending machines.  None of them with any sense of context or build-up.

Our reintroduction to Pinhead (Doug Bradley; Exorcismus, Hellraiser I-V) is pretty fun.  He emerges from an anatomy poster, pulls a pin from his head which elongates, and ""acupunctures"" his relaxed victim.  It has an air of 90s badness to it, but 90s badness done right!  And when Pinhead properly meets Trevor, the scene is a distinct throwback to the original Hellraiser (1987).  Nice touch.

This sixth franchise installment links back directly to the original Hellraiser (1987) when we learn that Trevor, among his amnesia-lost past, had given a Puzzle Box to Kirsty as a gift.  And much like part 1, Kirsty makes a deal with Pinhead to spare her.  Also borrowing the style of part 1 is that in this film we see much less of the Cenobites than we did in parts 2-5, making this more about Trevor's journey of infernal self-discovery.  We only find Pinhead, a brief appearance by Chatterbox, and his four new infernal monks --one with coils of wire, one plus-sized woman, one with flash stretched over its face, one without eyelids.  Only two of them are named in IMDB as , Stitch and Bound.  But the Cenobites seem to hardly matter in parts 5-6 outside of Pinhead himself.  <<sigh>>

An unfortunate trend in this franchise is that the effects go from ""Holy S*** Awesome"" (for their 80s era and even today) in parts 1-2, to pretty good in 3-4, to typical direct-to-DVD in 5-6.  But fret not, it's all still quite entertaining and Pinhead's tissue-rending hooked chains get their pound of flesh.
Overall, I was pleased with this film as a direct-to-DVD horror film, but maaaaybe a tad disappointed as a major Hellraiser fan.  In either case, I'd still recommend it.  But only AFTER seeing all of its predecessors in order (at least 1-4).",1458864000,2,5332,5.030716723549488

1736791,2,B00006ADFZ,"I'm not quite sure what audience ""Hellseeker"" is looking for? Like ""Inferno"" this entry in the series feels almost like a spec script that had been laying around, and with a few tweaks it became the next installment of the ""Hellraiser"" series.

As the film opens we see Trevor and his wife, Kirsty (from the first three films) having a nice drive in the country. Trevor takes his eyes off the road and the car plunges off a bridge into the river below. Trevor escapes, but Kirsty is trapped in the car, presumably drowning. We suddenly switch to Trevor in the ER being treated for a nasty headache, when he has a vision of having brain surgery, then flash to his office cubicle and it appears he's having an affair with his boss, and we see that Trevor is a suspect in Kirsty's disappearance, then we flash back to his apartment with his young neighbor hitting on him....and it's just a mish-mash of scenes as Trevor is trying to figure out what is real and what is hallucination.

In the hands of a competent filmmaker, one of these scattershot type films can be entertaining, and we wait to see how everything pulls together, and what the central mystery may be. ""Hellseeker"" is the 6th installment in a franchise, that basically just told the exact same story with the previous installment ""Inferno"". We know the mystery going in, and we have to wait 90 minutes for Trevor to catch up to us. It's a slog to get through this one, even with Ashley Laurence returning to the series, this one is a waste of time.",1413331200,,1511,4.510948905109489
1736792,5,B00006ADFZ,"This one and Hellbound are for my tastes 2 of the best horror movies to date. Very similar movies, very nightmarish and document insanity with excellence.  Hellbound is my favorite then follows this one in the series.
  A shame Clive sold the rights before the 1st one but that's show business and Clive isn't doing so bad.  Great Film!",1390521600,,336,4.6440677966101696
1736793,3,B00006ADFZ,"If you threw together Hellraiser and Jacob's Ladder then Hellseeker is the result, unfortunately this is not as good as either of those two films, although it's not a bad film, compared to some of the other sequels at any rate!

Unfortunately as well the description for the film kind of gives the game away, which seems a little odd. The basic premise is that Kirsty's husband has survived a crash which kills his wife, he tries to get on with his life but is plagued by terrible visions. He's also plagued by lovely women throwing themselves at him. At first I thought it was simply a blatant act to add some sex to the film, but after the reveal it does make a kind of sense.

There's a detective trying to get to the truth of what happened in the crash (Kirsty's body has not been found) as well as a strangely behaving co-worker. The story comes together in bits and pieces, it doesn't really stand out as something special, although it's not terrible either.

The real problem is that it doesn't feel like a Hellraiser film (considering some of the sequels I can see why - although the first two are excellent horror films), you get some flashes of Pinhead and the other cenobites and it all does become clear by the end, so it does fit, but doesn't quite work.

It feels like this is an attempt to fit the Hellraiser mythos into a more cerebral horror and it's a fair attempt, the issue for me is that it doesn't sit well with the more visceral nature of Pinhead and his companions. It might have been better to have made this as a stand alone film, rather than a Hellraiser sequel, but it is what it is and what we have is an ok film that doesn't really build on the mythos.",1389484800,,1682,4.33015873015873
1736794,5,B00006ADFZ,It was a gift and they were surprised that I chose to give this gift because it is not my interest.  It did arrive on time with two other CD's like it,1389139200,,150,3.6875
1736795,3,B00006ADFZ,"When it comes to 80's horror, Hellraiser has always been just a little more dark and eclectic than the more obviously famous films(Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween etc..).

The first two Hellraiser films rank amongst my favorite horror films of all time. But then something weird happens... maybe the money ran out from the studio or something, but the third film (""Hell on Earth"") starts off really strong and then completely jumps the shark. The fourth film (""Bloodline""), is the last one (I think?) that even remotely resembles what was up until then what I consider a Hellraiser film to be. That film is like a weird amalgam of a really great horror flick (the story line of how the box came into being), and a really REALLY bad one (the current day and space-station sequences). Plus it has that kid in it from the Shining remake with the weird upper-lip. He just bugs me.

That brings us to the next three [direct-to-video] films, where this film, Hellraiser VI:Hellseeker, resides. I read somewhere that these next three films were all based upon scripts that the studio didn't think were strong enough on their own, so they threw in some Pinhead and ta-da, it's a Hellraiser movie! This makes sense to me at least, because I really like this and the film before it (Inferno), but always thought the placement of the usual HR characters in the films were nonsensical.

I guess where I'm going with this is that if you view this film as a stand-alone horror film, it's actually really good in a lower-budget sort of way (ditto for Inferno). I've seen way-worse come out of a studio with a much higher price tag. But if you try to connect-the-dots and fit it in with the first four films, it'll just leave you sad, alone, depressed and confused, yearning for the sanity of a horror franchise that once was.

Well maybe not all that.",1382572800,3,1856,4.649390243902439
1736796,4,B00006ADFZ,"Following the trend set by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inferno/dp/B004P7CMD2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inferno</a>, the 2002 addition to the ""Hellraiser"" franchise is largely a standalone story, albeit one featuring the return of the series' original protagonist - Ashley Laurence as Kirsty Cotton. Stylistically, it's more of a psychological horror outing than a gory rampage. This is probably not what the die-hard devotees wanted, but viewers who aren't overly loyal to the original features will probably agree that this is still a good, creepy adventure that clears the bar for direct-to-video horror.

The story: Following a car crash which killed his wife (Laurence), businessman Trevor (Dean Winters,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oz/dp/B000G6BL42/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Oz</a>) experiences amnesia, headaches, police persecution, and terrifying hallucinations that lead him towards the truth behind the crash.

Perhaps the most disappointing thing about the picture is how little screentime Ashley Laurence has. On the bright side, this isn't a situation like in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hell-on-Earth/dp/B004P7CMBY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hell on Earth</a>&nbsp;where the producers had to finagle her credit onto the main titles. She leads entire scenes in this one, but she's not the main character and most of her onscreen appearances are flashbacks. Behind the scenes, Laurence was reportedly dissatisfied with her compensation for her work, which may indicate why Kirsty hasn't appeared in any subsequent sequels. Nevertheless, I'm going to assert that her relatively minimal showcasing syncs with the style of the film and her brief reunion with Pinhead is definitely one of the best scenes.

While not the desired trade-off for Laurence, Dean Winters does a good job as the protagonist. The film does something unique to the series with his character: while previous movies featured no shortage of unsavory individuals, ""Hellseeker"" takes a reverse approach by presenting Trevor as a victimized husband before slowly backtracking to reveal what a crumb he actually is. Similarly, the movie keeps a shroud of mystery over the infrequently-appearing Cenobites. On one hand, I find this minimalist approach appealing, but the fact that creepy human characters become the most visible antagonists in their stead is disappointing.

That said, the horror aspect is well played. With the exception of a couple dates CGI scenes, this is one creepy film. It's co-written by Carl Dupre, who's best known for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Detroit-Rock-City/dp/B000031EFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Detroit Rock City</a>&nbsp;but nevertheless crafts an intriguing mindscrew. The scares are based on atmosphere and imagery rather than jumps and jolts, and remained effective for me even after multiple viewings. Scenes like having Pinhead reflected in the water are haunting and memorable, and much of it has to do with Dean Winters' believable reactions.

Director Rick Bota's future contributions to the series would be among the worst, and because the following&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Revelations/dp/B0056P6SOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Revelations</a>&nbsp;would earn the distinction of being *the* worst-received entry to date, I declare ""Hellseeker"" here to be the last hurrah for the series.

If INFERNO was HELLRAISER's take on ANGEL HEART, then HELLSEEKER is this series' version of JACOB'S LADDER. Notes from Lyne's film and Robbins' character can be found embedded all throughout the story, but this actually works in director Rick Bota's favor. Of the later sequels, HELLSEEKER is decidedly the best, with a clean visual style and several strong performances. Every step along Trevor's path holds meaning, and Bota has left us with enough clues so that we may anticipate the ending without completing guessing the shocking revelation in the final scenes. Dean Winters is reserved in the lead role, which allows the audience to identify with him while we share in his search for answers. Ashley Laurence also makes her triumphant return to the series as Trevor's wife Kirsty in a small role that carries a huge significance. Pinhead's highly anticipated arrival in the end brings the character closest to Barker's original intent while serving his dark justice. For anyone who may have given up on the series, HELLSEEKER will come as a welcomed surprise before heading back in to more tiresome sequels.

1736827,3,B00006ADFZ,"At first glance, 2002's HELLRAISER: Hellseeker seemed to be just what the horror fan ordered. A new Hellraiser movie was released direct-to-DVD and among the cast was the original hero, Ashley Laurence reprising her role as Kirsty Cotton. After the total disappointment of Hellraisers 3, 4 and 5, the return of Kirsty should have meant someone was paying attention and things were finally getting back on track.

Not so much.

As it turns out, Dimension Films owned a horror script that had nothing to do with the Hellraiser franchise, but in order to save money writing an all-new Hellraiser movie, they just did some revisions on this other script, added some Cenobites and changed one of the character's names to Kirsty. In reality, the original script most likely had more to do with the movie JACOB'S LADDER than anything.

In HELLRAISER: Hellseeker, Trevor and his wife Kirsty are driving down a highway one drizzly afternoon when Trevor loses control of the car and the pair go careening off a rail, over the edge and into the water. Trevor tries to get Kirsty out, but the doors have closed and he can't help her. Moments later he wakes up in the hospital and a month has passed.

Doctors have been helping him with recurring headaches and memory loss while the police are still trying to help Trevor piece together what happened in the crash and hopefully locate his wife. Since the accident, there's been no sign of Kirsty.

As Trevor tries to deal with his loss and get his life back in order, his headaches become more frequent and intense, causing hallucinations. He gets glimpses of his life with Kirsty, which just makes him miss her even more. But he also begins to piece together things about himself he doesn't remember, like the fact he was sleeping with his boss. And possibly a neighbor. As tension mounts with the police investigation, Trevor's grip on reality loosens even more and when his co-worker Bret reminds him of their ""plan"". Turns out Trevor discovered Kirsty had a large inheritance from when her father Larry was killed. Bret and Trevor had planned to kill Kirsty, make it look like a suicide, and split the money. The crash into the water nixed that idea, but the police are still awfully suspicious about the nature of Kirsty's death--if she's even dead at all; there's still no body.

This sixth movie in the Hellraiser franchise isn't a bad movie. In fact, I probably would have liked it more before the Hellraiser re-write. Dean Winters--""Mayhem"" in the Allstate Insurance commercials--is very good as the confused, memory-wiped Trevor, and considering he's in every scene of the movie, he carries the film well. With the exception of William S. Taylor as Detective Lange, pretty much everyone else in the cast is a non-entity, filling space and giving Trevor someone to interact with. But Taylor is the only one who occasionally risks stealing Winter's scenes.

Whoever wrote the original script (Carl V. Dupre' and Tim Day are listed writers), they turned in a solid movie, and whoever did the re-write managed to work in the Hellraiser aspects pretty well, especially the turning point scene when Trevor (the original dirt bag Trevor, not post-accident Trevor) gives Kirsty the Lament Configuration puzzle box as an anniversary present and wants to videotape her opening it. In all 6 (so far) Hellraiser movies, that scene probably carried the most impact, and it was only a minute or two long. And for once, Laurence's performance is what made it great, even though, as usual, she could have toned it down just a bit.

The production was relatively impressive on a $3,000,000 budget, but I think director Rick Bota didn't do quite as good as job as he could have covering up the fact this story didn't start out as a Hellraiser movie. I mean, I could tell halfway through it the first time I saw it in 2002 that this was NOT a Hellraiser movie. And this leaves me with a conundrum. HELLRAISER: Hellseeker is a pretty good movie. It's just a crappy Hellraiser movie. On its own, Dean Winter and company made a pretty decent low-budget horror movie. But as a Hellraiser franchise movie, it's only one step above HELLRAISER: Inferno, and that step is only because of the Kirsty Cotton connection, which does help re-establish the floundering franchise back into the world we came to it in.

I'd say I can recommend this movie, but don't go into it thinking you're in for a Hellraiser Cenobite-packed Pinhead-fest. Doug Bradley's got maybe a few minutes more screen time than Laurence, who was just barely in the movie. But it's certainly better than the last movie, and Dean Winter's performance does a lot to make that possible. It's very obvious by now that the day's of the old-style Hellraiser movie are over and what we're going to get from here on out is just a series of unrelated sequels with zero continuity. So each movie is going to have to stand on its own. Luckily HELLRAISER: Hellseeker seems to have a solid enough footing.",1343779200,,4979,4.793706293706293
1736828,5,B00006ADFZ,"The reason why my title entry is so long is because! Really, this particular movie of the Hell Raiser is the most profound one from a Metaphysical/Mystical point of view.

I know that everyone has their own favorite when dealing with the 8 hell raiser movies. However, do to the content,I personally favor this one the most! ""Because it mirrors ourselves.

(This Particular One)Is not so much about ""Pinhead"" going around murdering people. It's more so about how far Betrayal,Evil Negotiations,Wicked Deeds,Lust,Pleasure N Pain(Dualities)and circumstances go deep down the rabbit hole.(sort of speak)How they begin to take over people's lives. And from those various choices- How they lead us into either Paradise or Hell Worlds. Of course in this movie(They were strictly all Hell Existences)

I could've written far more extensive about this movie: However,I'm aware that some reviewers are simply seeking to get a good horror scare only. And one's equally aware- That, some reviewers will review this and say: That person took the movie way to serious. However, in reality, this movie has alot more truth in it than many people can possibly imagine!
This is being expressed from experience! Which causes one to speak the truth! Not from the point of view of being a horror buff(And theirs no judgement being expressed about that perspective either) I'm just spreading the truth about this in depth Movie!

When certain movies is deeply understood and ciphered from experience. Then ones written review gets typed from the heart!
Every choice we make in everyday life leads us towards whatever doors which we created for ourselves to become obligated to walk in! ""This is reality not Fiction!"" Not only is it important throughout life to become aware of the company you keep. As the wise sages say ""One can be around someone all their life and still not really know them.""
Furthermore, As the ancient writings on the various temple doors Say ""Man Know thyself.""

The movie goes on to show that the husband in the movie ""Didn't even know himself. He had no memory of his deeds or existence! And when we dont've any memory of our past then we can't know how it's directly connected to our present situations and circumstances. And furthermore, how it goes on and defines of future existence! Actually, not only did his wife sell out to evil. But the husband did as well! He was all along challenged with his own weaknesses. Because remember, the choices we make will sooner or later define our reality!

Their are deep seated issues which all of us have! And at some point we will be challenged with them.

Actually, He was already in a hell world without even knowing how he even got there in the first place. Why! is because, just like in real life. Their are souls who are trapped in between worlds. Which can cause fragmentation about ones own existence. They're constantly living their past while at the same time in their present horrors. Do to the life that they lived. Where ever we end up, It's an extension from how we lived in the flesh on the physical plane. The exception is: The experience becomes magnified many fold... Because during ones time which they had lived on the earth plane. They were accustom to just going thru their life on the most dense vibrational plane called planet earth.

But we must always keep in mind this: The same applies in the opposite! Meaning, if our deeds while being a resident in the flesh on the planet earth was about positive actions: Then after we cross over- We will reap the benefits many fold in that way. ""As yea sow so shall yea reap""

His wife was already reaping what she sowed. But as the saying goes, ""Misery Loves Company"" Though it appeared at the end that her soul was spared by bargaining for her husband's to be devoured. In reality, while she was still living in the flesh, her days would be numbered. Then she would face unspeakable terror and horror with her soul. Because no one is ridden from the responsibility of experiencing immense pain and suffering, that they ""purposely"" by ""knowing the choice they made"" ended up causing someone else to have to go through. Along with that, how she chose to hang onto evil ""by keeping the Hell World Cube"" (Its just an example of how people can still end up choosing to hang onto evil possessions,ways,habits,Etc;)

Though this movie depicts Hell Beings such as Cenobites and Pin Head. In reality, the way that they look, Along with what they could do! ""Was in honesty"" A very mild depiction! When compared to the evil that really exists in other worlds.

This is why though many dont've a clue as to who they were in their past lives. Yes, ""Past lives"" It's still the underlying truth! As the saying goes, ""Hell is Repetition"" The task is to break free from our lifetimes of negative patterns. The most important thing we need to currently know beyond anything else is: We need to become righteous citizens on the earth- By doing righteous deeds! As oppose, to remaining in our ignorance- by constantly doing negative ones. It's all a choice!

This review was written with the pure intentions of giving the reader a parallel of how the movie is trying to show how our choices and actions lead into many doorways. In fact, our own life, is a true so-called horror movie! Because we're constantly writing our own script. The choices we make- not only affect ourselves,but they also affect others! Which leads into either future existences of Heaven or Hell Worlds.

P.S.Like mentioned earlier. Although I could've written much more extensive on this very meaningful movie. However one just wanted to share their perspective as to why they see this one out of the other 7 as being the most serious and realistic by far!

And May your own journey throughout life become if it already isn't ""A Positive and Sincere One!

In the first, her uncle uses her daddy like skin so her can get close while his sister-in-law cheers this on and wants him. Strange people. The next one is a little trip to the Labyrinth, which hurt the series in some ways and helped it in others but that made hell a little small for my liking. Now we have Kirsty all over again, pulled from the wreckage of a vehicle and now having a bad day.

I have seen this movie on TV without a star and that really gets to me. This is one of the best storylines in the Hellraiser world there is. You have a Hellseeker and a Hellraiser shown to you, plus you learn some stuff you did not know. I personally like how everything seems weird, and I like the thing that is said later, when all the hooks come marching sunder. It is odd.

Speaking of odd, there are a lot of little things in here that are odd. The dog (doesn't that mean possession), the cops, the boy, the people she thinks she wants on her side. She seems so out of it - or does she. MS. Cotton has gone a few bouts, what's another?

I guess the first one would have it beat in my book, but I would say it's my second favorite of the series. A lot of these reviews compare it to Memento, but as some other reviewers have pointed out it is more than heavily influenced by Jacob's Ladder. The scenes on the bus are so close to the subway scenes in Jacob's Ladder it's totally obvious, the character of the good doctor is very similar to Danny Aiello's character, even that scene focusing on the hospital gurney's wheel, the doctors putting needles in the guy's brain, and the whole afterlife thing, well, yeah it's very very close. A homage only goes so far until it's a copy.

This time around, he shows up to explain what is going on (in style). He shows up like God Father with his mafia carrying his victim. The extras are pretty good.

1736835,4,B00006ADFZ,"Ahhhh.  Hellraiser's back!  Kinda.  The title of this installment is HELLRAISER / HELLSEEKER.  Yes.  One hellraiser divided by one hellseeker.  It turns out, that equals one pretty good movie, but without that much hell getting raised.

The hellseeker here is Trevor, who just so happens to be married to Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence, reprising her role from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/first/dp/6305972001/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">first</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/two/dp/B001FU792G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">two</a>&nbsp;Hellraisers).  They're a little too much in love, because they smooch while highway driving and, oops!, drive straight off a bridge and into a river.  Trevor manages get out of the car, but Kirsty isn't so fortunate.  She yanks on her seatbelt and bangs her palms on the window, but those things apparantly don't, you know, unlatch seatbelts or doors.  Trevor swims back to save her, but since the only thing he does is also bang on the window with his palms, the door never opens, and Kirsty drowns.  It's unsettling.  And also not a spoiler.

After that, Trevor's life gets weird.  You know.  HELLRAISER-weird.  Kirsty's body is never found.  Detectives begin hounding him suspiciously.  People at work are acting weird.  And dang it if he isn't having some pretty upsetting hallucinations.  Dean Winters' Trevor stumbles through it all at a numb remove, too slow-witted to understand anything, but also too poorly acted to be anything more than a figurehead for the audience's own confusion.

Because the movie isn't impatient to make any sense.  Scene two (roughly five minutes in) and the roller coaster is already barrelling down the first nauseating drop.  At this point, I glumly realized I had the movie figured out.  But then, just as quickly, I realized I didn't.  Then I did.  Then I didn't.  And we danced.  The movie definitely keeps you on your toes.

Also definite is that the plot of HELLSEEKER is almost too similar to that of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/fifth-film/dp/B00004Y634/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">fifth film</a>.  In both, flawed protagonists are forced to piece together the jigsaw puzzle of their lives, but the pieces are as dangerous as actual jigsaws.  In INFERNO, the picture on that puzzle wasn't hard to get, even long before all the pieces were in place.  HELLSEEKER, on the other hand, paints a far more satisfying picture, even if it does so at an indulgent, devil-may-care pace.

No movie since the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/fourth/dp/B000JW1LVG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">fourth</a>&nbsp;has really taken full advantage of the possiblities inherent in the Hellraiser mythos (and I'm not counting the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/third/dp/B000FEBWV2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">third</a>&nbsp;film, a campy misstep that was for Hellraiser what Joel Schumacher was for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman/dp/0790732912/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman</a>), and HELLSEEKER is no different.  Our resident demon (Cenobite?), Pinhead, is still not much more than a color commentator.  When he finally shows up in this film, he is introduced by a glowing crack in the wall that is shaped like an upside-down question mark.  Get it?  He's the Anti-Question, the answer, the deux ex machina (how ironic!).  In other words, he's not really living (or killing) up to his potential.  It's convenient.  Even a little shameless.

1736838,2,B00006ADFZ,"Sometimes I think the whole HELLRAISER series is actually a series of metaphors about us, its fans. In the films, some fool goes out and obtains the box, brings it home with high hopes as to what it will do for him, and is brutally disappointed. Substitute ""movie"" for ""box"" and you have our collective history. We know in advance what fate awaits us when we rent a HELLRAISER film, but we do it anyway. People like us keep Pinhead - that is, the studio suits who grind these flicks out twice a year - in latex and chains.

Ne'er has a concept for a horror series been cooler, or offered a richer and more complex backstory, than did HR. And seldom has that concept been more badly and consistently bungled in execution, leading not merely to films which were weird, flawed and not what they should have been, but in some cases unwatchably bad and stupid. HELLSEEKER is somewhere between the two of these categories. It aspires to great heights, combining plot elements from films like MOMENTO and ANGEL HEART, but as it's carried out it's just a mess - confusing, disjointed, boring, and unpleasant to watch.

HELLSEEKER is the story of Trevor Gooden (Dean Winters, the best thing about HBO's prison opera, OZ), a seemingly ordinary suit-`n-tie office drone who nearly died in a car accident which may, or may not, have killed his wife Kirsty (Ashley Lawrence, reprising that role for the fourth time). Gooden, whose head was badly injured when his car went bye-bye into a river, can't remember what happened to her, and the cops can't find her body. Gooden is anxious to discover his wife's fate - especially since said cops don't believe his story - but he's plagued by chronic pain and an almost continuous series of hallucinations which make him seem guilty of something more than careless driving. When the people around him begin to turn up horribly murdered, Gooden begins to hallucinate about a puzzle box and a certain highly stylizied demon with nails in his mug and a penchant for torture. But who did what to whom, and why...and what really happened to Kirsty?

Like I said, the story aspires to be much more than the standard spatter-`n-splatter horrorthon. And on a few levels, it succeeds. For starters, Ashley Lawrence is not only one of those women who gets hotter as she gets older, but her acting skills have improved dramatically over the years, and while her screen time is limited she has more to do than scream and run away from demons. Stylistically, the movie is appropriately noirish - everything looks washed out, shadowy and run-down, precisely the way a HR film should look. And certain events in the movie's climax are pleasantly reminiscent of ""Incident at Owl Creek Bridge"" and ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" in their mind-frakking, falling-into-place quality. But these things can't overcome the film's basic problems, a short list of which would include sluggish pacing, confusing, epilepsy-inducing editing, a completely confusing storyline, listless direction, a forgettable script, and needless departures from the HR series mythology (how, for example, can Pinhead lay claim to souls who did not ever use the Box and were murdered in an ordinary way?). The biggest mistake the editor made was the decision to keep the hallucinations going full-clip throughout the flick, rather than having them build slowly over its course: the end result is a disjointed, eye-glazing orgy of what Hollywood types call ""frame-[expletive]ing"", whose relatively satisfying and well-executed climax won't help the people who pressed ""stop"" on the remote after forty-five frustrating minutes.

I realize it's chump-ism to expect that HELLRAISER movies will be ""good"" in the classic sense of the word. The budgets are too low, and the talent levels of the people involved are too inconsistent to produce anything spectacular. But when a concept is this good, when you have a director with some aesthetic sense who clearly is trying hard, and when you can get solid, respectable actors like Winters to play your leads, the end result should be much better. The real ""puzzle"" here is why I keep coming back for more. I guess, like Pinhead, ""I prefer pain.""",1215129600,5,4175,4.917730496453901
1736839,3,B00006ADFZ,"As many have said, this one has not got a hell of a lot to actually do with Pinhead, but he is in it. This one seems to be more a Freddy Kruger adventure, but none the less, I enjoyed this one when it was done.

A man drives his car into a lake, via a Duke boys style jump over the bridge. His wife is trapped inside the car and he can not get her out.

The man then wakes up in the hospital, and seems to be suffering from memory loss. As the movie progress' you discover what is actually happening to him. It takes a few twists and turns, and a few things that make you go, ""huh?"" but in the end it all ties up and explains itself and it has a very interesting ending that I did not see coming.

the overall plot and story of this is pretty well written and portrayed on screen. Even tho many Hellraiser fans are dismissing it as being a true Hellraiser film, I think they are more unhappy with the fact that Pinhead is not in the movie a heck of a lot.

I think this is a decent sequel, it's different, it's fresh, and it is in no way ever boring during any of the movie like some scenes of the original Hellraisers. It gives the series a new perspective, and if you can just accept that, and see the movie for what it is, you may just enjoy it.

Also, I think anyone who has never seen a Hellraiser film, but enjoys a good suspence/horror movie, then you may just find this one to be pretty good. It's not going to please hardcore fans who would praise a film of Pinhead jumping rope for 2 hours and singing, ""i'm a little teapot"" nor will it appeal to the fans who care blood & gore in the movies, but I say just give this one a go, you may like it, you may hate it, but keep in mind, it's because it's different and Pinheads not around much, that you see so many Hellraiser fans bash it.

I've seen all of them and this one is my third favorite Hellraiser film behind the first two.  I think the main source of criticism comes from the idea that it is not a true Hellraiser film.  Well, the Hellraiser series is now about variety.  Seriously, who gets excited when a new just-like-the-others ""Friday the 13th"" movie comes out?

Well, not pure variety.  If you've seen both films, it's easy to see the similarities between this film and its predecessor, ""Inferno"".  This is little more than a remake of ""Inferno"", but this one is much better done.  This film emphasizes psychological horror and personal torment over gore and most of the scenes are very creative and memorable.  The creepiest scene for me was the one involving the video camera.  The images from that scene are forever burned in my mind and many of the other scenes are close to matching its effectiveness.  The entire film is genuinely scary and they even mix some nice eroticism into the mix (though little nudity).  The costumes and special effects are also well-done (except for the gunshot).

Complaints?  Well, some mention that the movie is kind of confusing.  It can seem so at first, but all is cleared up at the end.  It's not really a movie you have to rewatch to fully understand, although the movie is good enough to inspire you to rewatch it.  Also, some complain about Ashley's character (the heroine from the first two films) being turned into a villian.  Yeah, I was a little disappointed too, but it's nothing that killed the movie for me.

And I almost forgot the ""Chucky"" franchise, love the direction they went in, it revived the whole concept.  Keep em' coming!",1164585600,2,411,4.732394366197183
1736852,2,B00006ADFZ,"Dean Winters, doing his best impression of Ben Affleck, stars in this, the sixth installment in the constantly withering ""Hellraiser"" franchise. In ""Hellraiser: Hellseeker,"" his character, Trevor Gooden is married to good ol' Kirsty Cotton, who we remember from the first three films. Trouble is, she seemingly dies in a car wreck less than ten minutes into the movie and Trevor has one massive headache trying to figure out what happened.

Let it be known that history does repeat itself. Just like ""Hellraiser III: Hell On Earth"" and ""Hellraiser: Bloodline,"" this one takes the series further into shame and embarassment. It's a direct-to-video sequel, but c'mon, we expect better than this. Maybe ""Hellseeker"" was a good script at some point, but when they decided to throw Pinhead and Kirsty into the mix, it got lost. See, these characters serve little to no purpose in the plot. They are just gimmicks, placed within a story to draw in viewers and feed off a legendary title. This is not a ""Hellraiser"" movie. A healthy chunk of it just adds up to a sub-standard psychological thriller, nothing else. In fact, Pinhead and Kirsty hardly come into play until the final 15 minutes, which feel like a remake of the original movie.

I like to think I have an open mind when it comes to movies, and horror in particular. But this movie is a joke. The producers obviously masked an incomplete script to pass it off as a ""Hellraiser"" movie (ala ""American Psycho 2"") and shouldn't think for one second that we can't tell the difference. The end result is full of plot-holes, loose ends, inconsistencies, etc. etc. If you can make any sense out what you saw or if you can even call it a movie at the very end, you're a better person than me.",1163376000,2,1737,4.7105263157894735
1736853,2,B00006ADFZ,"Hellraiser: Hellseeker (Rick Bota, 2002)

Tell me: is there a single person who watched the climax of this movie and didn't say to him- or herself, ""Pinhead wouldn't fall for that again!""? Because if there is, then I strongly suggest an intervention and some forced classes in logic (not to mention film appreciation 101).

While it's the last (to date) of the Hellraiser series that actually deals with the real mythology of the thing-- Deader seems to have been a standalone horror film that got Pinhead written in at the last minute, and Hellworld is an amusing look at obsessive fandom more than anything-- it would be a travesty to let the Hellraiser mythology get to this point, which can safely be called a nadir, and then drift off into nothingness. Hellseeker is, to be as kind as possible, a terrible, terrible movie.

Ashley Laurence reprises her role as Kirsty Cotton, here married to Trevor Gooden (Dean Winters, from TV's Rescue Me). Gooden wakes up after a car accident, remembering nothing, only to be told that Kirsty perished in the accident. (And, thus, most of Laurence's role is seen in flashbacks.) After he goes back out into the real world, however, things seem... off, a little, and both he and we start to realize that Trevor Gooden is not at all the man he remembers.

The idea for the story, and its structure, could probably have been made into something quite good; hints of cleverness are continually poking out at the ages, waiting to be worried into fullness, and yet they never are. The acting is uniformly flat, the pace is turgid at its finest moments, and the most suspense to be found is in your decision as to whether to hit pause on your DVD player when you get up to go to the bathroom. Don't bother, you're not going to miss anything if you do. * ",1147910400,5,1789,4.613207547169812
1736854,4,B00006ADFZ,Hellraiser VI - Hellseeker~ Dean Winters is a really well made sequell in the hellraiser series. Ashley Laurence is back for the first time since hellbound. The special effects are quite well made and the script is great being that the movie has a 3 million dollar budget. The music is great for the movie and sets the mood perfectly even to well sometimes. The entire videoe camera scene is so frightening and the psychological drama is totally creepy. It is kind of ironic that he goes to a chiropractor considering that pinhead has pins all over his head. The dialogue is not as poorly written as most horror sequells and is quite good. Pinhead only plays a small part and can almost be seen as doing a small cameo. I highly recommend this movie to all hellraiser fans and fans of great movies.,1144972800,11,797,4.541666666666667

Her husband is the main focus in this one, as you see him on a journey after a car accident with Kirsty.

Apparently Kirsty is dead from the car wreck. But the police cannot find his wife. While he's being investigated by police, a lot of oddoties happen at his work place and his apartment. Some of the way people that he knew, treat him very differently than he thought previously before the accident.

There are a few more Cynobite scenes than Inferno, which is basicaly the same amount of time they were in Hellraiser 1. I still didn't find this character as interesting as the one from Inferno, so I care a lot less about anyway that this guy can redeem himeslf in anyway. I wish Kristy was in the movie a little more, but with Pinhead being more of a punisher again it's closer to the 1st one.",1140739200,2,976,4.357142857142857

But more of a film that didn't excatly live up to the original or 2nd movies creepiness or horror.  However, I did find the movie very entertaining and a nice twist at the end of the movie to make it a very compealing movie and sequel.  Although, it didn't have the complete horror or helplessness or despair that the first two films had it did hold its own in the creepiness and confusion section of the movie, which made it a very well done sequel.

1736859,4,B00006ADFZ,"This film is an excellent entry into the Hellraiser series. The entry of Pinhead, is so classic, and the final  denoument is just superb. But , as good as this film is, don't thank the Director, Rick Bota , for the positives in this film. He was handed the script, he was given notes by Clive Barker himself after a review of the semi-final  cut, and he threw out some of the best  scenes and kept them only as a deleted scenes set. This film succeeds in spite of the Director. The power of Ashley Lawrence as an actress is shown again in the film series. Compare this film with HELLRAISER DEADER... it is evident that Bota cannot do a Hellraiser film without Connect the dot instructions. He may be a good Cinematographer ( and in Deader, Bota had the benefit of one of the local cinematic  Masters who made sure that Bota's work at least LOOKS  good), and if Bota filmed DEMON KNIGHT, then kudos to him, since I love the film... but he fails in Deader, and this one succeeds because he had so many other masterful  craftsmen that he could not help but produce a decent product.

Doug Bradley appears as at least two characters in this film, and once again you get to see how powerful he is as an actor, and how immortal he is as PINHEAD.

I hope Bota is kept well away from HELLRAISER films  in the future.",1126396800,3,1308,4.3061224489795915
1736860,1,B00006ADFZ,"I am big fan of the Hellraiser films. I loved the orignal Hellraiser and the second film Hellbound: Hellraiser 2. I found Hellraiser 3: Hell on Earth to be okay but not as good as the first two. Even though many didn't like it, I enjoyed Hellraiser: Bloodlines. It wasn't great but it was in common was Pinhead and he had a decent amount of screen time in all of them. Now I never saw Hellraiser: Inferno because I had heard a lot of negative things about the film. The most common complaint being that Pinhead is hardly in the film. So I skipped ahead to Hellraiser VI: Hellseeker. I figured that by bringing back Ashley Laurence as Kirsty that the film would be more like the first two films. Well boy was I wrong. While Kirtsty is in the film for short periods of time, Pinhead is pretty much non-existant. After watching almost an hour of this film I started to wonder what connection this film had to the Hellraiser franchise. When you see the title Hellraiser and a picture of Pinhead on the cover of a DVD you expect a Hellraiser film. Well you won't be getting that with this film. This film is less like a Hellraiser film and come soff more like a rip off of Jacob's Ladder. This film looks like it was made very fast on a small budget. And the acting is just bad. Even Ashley Laurence comes off like she really wasn't putting much effort into the role. Overall if you are thinking of buying this DVD, don't. Rent it, or borrow it, but don't buy it. You will be very disappointed if you do.",1126310400,4,1499,4.30035335689046
1736861,3,B00006ADFZ,I bought this movie accidentally three years ago without watching it. I would have to say the acting wasn't that bad at all and the effects and story were decent. This was a hell of a lot better than Inferno w/ Craig Sheffer. Overall I thought it was an average underrated film.,1124323200,2,278,4.365384615384615
1736872,3,B00006ADFZ,"Although ""Hellraiser: Hellseeker"" is certainly watchable, even enjoyable, it's a big step down from the preceding chapters, all of which I felt were phenomenal (including the terribly underappreciated ""Hellraiser: Bloodline"").  It turns out to be a temporary setback, as ""Deader"" bounces the series part of the way back up. ""Hellseeker"" might have come off better if it hadn't had such a legacy to live up to.

  This sixth chapter of the saga brings back Kirsty Cotton (played by Ashley Laurence) to the series, and while this, combined with the enigmatic title, would lead one to believe there's something great coming, it's here that we run into trouble, because the character acts completely Out of character.  Having seen the earlier movies in which she appeared, nothing about her character strikes me as being consistent with what came previously.  Truely, it would have been better - if they were going to go and do it this way - to have that character not be Kirsty at all but someone entirely new.  Save Ashley and maybe bring her back for a script that's more in keeping with the way her character was previously?  Even Pinhead seems to be different - he's as visually impressive as always and Doug Bradley as always does a great job with the role, but....some of the grandeur has leaked away from the character.  And the Kirsty/Pinhead 'relationship' is all wrong.  I'm not going to go into details as to the endings of ""Hellraiser"" 1 & 2, but there has always been something there - definately NOT a romantic or sexual relationship (or any hint thereof that I can see) but the way in which these characters have interacted has had a certain special distinction to it, that would be hard to sum up even if one were trying to put it into words.  So again, the movie would have been better served if it had had a different female lead.

I've focused on the negatives first and can now continue on with what was right with the movie, which was actually quite alot.  The effects are, as always with this series, top-of-the-line, and some brand new Cennobites appear.  If you're a fan of the series, you're going to want to see it just to see what new weird and disturbing forms the latest additions to the Cennobite pantheon have taken on.  The plot focuses on the survivor of a car accident that Supposedly killed his wife looking for the answers to the strange happenings he's been experiencing lately, and the truth about the crash.  This had potential for a fine ""Hellraiser"" plot but only partly delivers on it. (Sorry)

  This is the 6th of 7 entries thus far, with ""Hellworld"" (Part 8) on the way September 6, and this is the least of them so far, so I have to say - if this is as low as the series drops it's doing great, because after six or seven installments most (not all but most) series - and not just horror series - have at least one chapter that hits the rocks harder than this; it just seems to be the law of averages catching up.  And ""Hellseeker"" is still a very watchable movie with a lot going for it; the main reason I was let down is the saga fell from such a staggering height, but in the end it didn't land nearly as low as it could have.  Definately worth giving it a chance.",1120953600,,3210,4.5190311418685125

The film was OK but was too similar to Hellraiser : Inferno for me and the end was too similar to previous films in the series as well.

Also the cenobites (pinhead in particular!) are just not on screen enough thats what the majority of fans wanna see and whats the point of introducing new cenobites if you never see them! They make Hellraiser!

Then came Inferno and Hellseeker and i'm wondering what went wrong with the original plot and storyline??.These 2 films are the worst i've seen in the series which is dissapointing.

A totaly new concept of the film emerged but wondered why? with hardly any reference to the box of demons. In both these films (Pinhead!) hardly appears which was frustrating as i expected him to be in them more as the series evolved as well as the other cenobites. Nice to see the return of Kirsty (Ashley Laurence)if only for brief moments,as she was a dominating charecter in the first two films.

1736875,1,B00006ADFZ,"As this sixth installment of the series opens, Kirsty Cotton and her husband Trevor are making a little road trip.  They appear to have gone through some rough times but are recovering.  A momentary distraction and their car is headed off a bridge and into the river.  Trevor escapes but can't get Kirsty out.  He can do nothing but watch her drown.

A month later he awakens in a hospital.  It's decided he's well enough and is released, although he continues to be plagued by headaches and horrifying visions of torture and murder.  Kirsty was never found, and the police are becoming increasingly suspicious of Trevor.

Though the preceding movies varied in quality, even the least of them had something redeeming, something that made each worth watching.  This one does not.  Trevor's delusions take up no less than the first forty-five minutes of the film.  Approximately every five minutes the viewer is treated to an ""it was all a dream"" moment.  Approximately every five minutes the viewer is tricked into thinking the story is going somewhere only to find that it hasn't gone anywhere at all.  This isn't clever.  This is padding.  And it's absolutely maddening.

As in the previous sequel, `Inferno,' Pinhead and his minions act as punishers of the wicked.  In fact, this film is basically a rehash of that story, which itself was lifted from the vastly superior film `Angel Heart.'  Why bother?  Unlike either of those movies, this one is an incomprehensible mess.  I'm not fussed that the Cenobites barely appear in the film.  (People seem to forget that they had relatively little screen time in the original, too.)  Just give me a good story.

Worst of all, it completely rapes the character of Kirsty by having her do things so out of character she is unrecognizable.  I suppose they thought bringing back Ashley Laurence might bring back fans who had abandoned the franchise, but all it's likely to do is make them angry.

With `Hellseeker,' (what the title means is anybody's guess) this series has finally hit rock bottom.  It flat-out stinks.

The DVD includes a director's commentary and some deleted scenes, but since I couldn't bear to watch one more single moment of this awful movie I did not explore them.  There is also a brief feature that demonstrates how some of the special effects were done.",1110672000,7,2322,4.8396946564885495

It's mainly about how the Pinhead torments Trevor into remembering what happened before the crash. He thinks that all was heaven with Kirsty, until associates and woman remind him of his adtulterous and kiniving past.

It's beautiful in a psychological way, where Trevor gets flashes and wonders about his encounters with others. There is only one erotic scene, and it is far too FUNNY, to be thought of as sexual. If that's what you are into then, you'll love this movie.",1108944000,4,762,4.637037037037037

1736880,4,B00006ADFZ,"The Hellraiser series is rather sad. I mean, the first Hellraiser had the potential to be one of the scariest films of all time, but failed due to spotty dialouge and some bad/so-so acting. The second installment was a brilliant concept, but was not paced right, and became rather silly towards the end. The third one was rather bad. The fourth, Bloodlines, was actually rather swell, except the story sort of contradicted the previous installments.

""Inferno"" gave a whole new look to Hellraiser (and was more in line with the novella, Hellbound Heart), in that it relied less on blood and guts, and more on charcter development and suspense.

""Hellseeker"" is an improvement over ""Inferno."" The film is paced perfectly. The viewer is sucked into the protagonist's twisted personal hell, and is led along many strange encounters. I felt like I was watching an old Twilight Zone episode at times.

The acting is not bad, I thought Dean Winters played his role quite well, as Kirsty's husband and Doug Bradley is brilliant as the always captivating PINHEAD. The director did a fine job in creating a twisted universe, and complementing the characters' anguish with thoughtful camera work.

I'm led to believe, based on previous reviews, that the people who bash this film are the ones who lean more towards Freddy vs. Jason style horror, rather than a, not to sound condescending (I enjoy all types of horror), ""deeper"" film that explores one's soul (ok, ok, this isn't exactly ""deep,"" but compared to most horror, it could be considered as such).

The only complaint I have is a two minute scene towards the end in which Pinhead and Kirsty exchange some dialouge which seemed very much out of charcter. But still, this is the best of the series thus far. Give it a chance.",1097280000,4,1771,4.8316831683168315
1736881,4,B00006ADFZ,"With each review I read, it seems that every Hellraiser fan hates Hellseeker. Well, I'm a big fan of the Hellraiser series and this is my third favorite (behind Parts 1 and 2 of course). The main reason why I believe this gets so much negative criticism is because the storyline is almost exactly like the previous Hellraiser movie, Inferno (Pinhead is barely in either movie as well). The first time I watched Hellseeker, I knew exactly what was going to happen after only 5 minutes in. Basically, if you've never seen either movie and have to decide which one to get, it comes down to this: Which actors do you like better? Craig Sheffer and Nicholas Turturro (Inferno) or Dean Winters and Ashley Laurence. Personally, I choose the latter.

This brings me to my next point, the acting. Many people hated Winter's performance and thought he was a terrible actor. While I'll admit that his acting wasn't the best in this film, he is an amazing actor. He did a great job on the show ""Oz"" and was the best actor in the film ""Snipes"". Also of note is the fact that Ashley Laurence (from the first three films) is back in the role of Kirsty Cotton. She looks absolutely stunning now and did well in her role.

If you don't over-analyze it, Hellseeker is just an entertaining film. There wasn't very much gore like the previous movies, but it's understandable due to the low budget and they did a good job with what they had. The DVD is nice too. It isn't loaded with special features or anything, but the menus look good, it has commentary with the director, and alternate/deleted scenes (also with optional commentary by the director). There's one deleted scene in particular that most fans of the old movies will like (It's one where Kirsty and Pinhead are alone, discussing the Cotton family). Overall, if you're looking for a nice psychological thriller that provides an original spin on the franchise, Hellseeker is well worth your time.",1092614400,5,1938,4.680351906158358
1736882,4,B00006ADFZ,"The Hellraiser franchise holds a special place in my heart. I will never forget the first time I saw the opening chapter in the series of films inspired by Clive Barker's nightmarish visions. Watching the original ""Hellraiser"" now is a mixed bag-some of those special effects look a bit hokey, but others still come across as chillingly effective. Who can forget the glistening visage of Uncle Frank? The lascivious Julia? Or the first appearance of the ominous and verbose Pinhead? The second installment improved on the first, as the film whisked the viewer away to the abode of Pinhead and the Cenobites. A gruesome, perverse picture, ""Hellbound: Hellraiser 2"" raised the expectations about future entries to a fever pitch. Up next came ""Hellraiser 3,"" a personal favorite of mine even though legions of fans have subsequently disowned it. The series moved into the latter stages of its life from this point forward, taking bold steps in an attempt to expand far beyond anything that viewers had come to expect. ""Hellraiser: Bloodline"" moved the action into the future while simultaneously looking at the past in an effort to tell the history of the Lament Configuration, the box that unleashes Pinhead and his infernal minions. Then came ""Hellraiser: Inferno,"" a film that toyed with concepts of memory in a way that is a sort of precursor to ""Hellraiser: Hellseeker.""
The sixth entry in the indomitable ""Hellraiser"" franchise employs techniques eerily reminiscent of films like ""Irreversible"" and ""Memento"" without showing scenes backwards. Trevor Gooden (Dean Winters) and his main squeeze Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence) aren't getting along that well. They argue incessantly about the things a couple always argues about, but unfortunately they do so while driving a car. When tempers flare Gooden takes his eyes off the road long enough for the car to do a header off a bridge into deep water. The story picks up from this point forward, following Trevor as he recovers from injuries sustained in the accident. Sadly, good old Kirsty didn't make it through the crash, and now Gooden faces questions from the police. The two detectives who question Trevor try and use the old good cop/bad cop routine to extract a confession from the man. Gooden has no idea why the police are voicing suspicions about the accident since he had no reason to try and harm his loved one. The ongoing investigation is a minor inconvenience anyway because Trevor Gooden feels bad physically and emotionally. He suffers from crushing headaches and other ailments as a result of the crash, although the doctors seem to think he shouldn't have any problems.
Then the hallucinations start, frightening visions of gory violence and weird apparitions that leave Gooden feeling confused and alone. His encounter with a cute neighbor in his apartment building leads to a murder he knows nothing about. In come the cops again, asking increasingly ominous questions about what Trevor knows. Everything is turning weird, with time skewing off into past, present, and future directions. Gooden worries he's losing his mind, and he's right. What he should have asked himself was to whom would his mind go. Fans of the ""Hellraiser"" movies already have a good idea who's going to turn up in the end to claim Trevor Gooden. Yep, it's Pinhead, that urbane, witty denizen of Hell who always finds time to pop up on earth to lecture the mortals on the evils of bad living. It turns out that that accident might not have occurred the way we thought it did, that maybe Trevor isn't the aw shucks sort of guy we thought he was. 'Tis a pity when a good seed goes bad. Or does it? I won't spoil the shock conclusion for you, but ""Hellraiser: Hellseeker"" holds its cards tightly to its vest. The film is a roller coaster ride that doesn't let the secret out until the final frames.
Director Rick Bota did a good job crafting yet another entertaining ""Hellraiser"" sequel. He imbues his film with a stark, washed out atmosphere that more than adequately expresses the bleakness Trevor Gooden feels after the accident. Bota also knows that a movie wishing to attach itself to the Pinhead canon must have a vicious bite in terms of gory violence. A whole host of sharp objects express themselves in various ways in the film, much to the delight of gorehounds looking for yet another movie to tease the palate. Even the acting is better than you would expect for a low budget straight to video horror flick. Ashley Laurence, returning to the role that made her semi-famous in the horror world, does a better job acting the seminal part of Kirsty Cotton than she did in the first two films. She might be a bit older, but she's still easy on the eyes. The only downfall to Laurence's appearance is that she doesn't have more than a few scenes. Pity. The director should have made greater use of this actress. Moreover, Doug Bradley as Pinhead once again appears only briefly, a big disappointment to fans of the man with the face of a million nightmares.
The DVD edition is quite good for a straight to video movie. You get a commentary from Rick Bota, a special effects featurette, alternate scenes that give Ashley Laurence greater screen time, and a bunch of trailers for films like ""Imposter,"" ""Backflash,"" and ""Hellraiser: Inferno."" This sixth installment is the last of the ""Hellraiser"" films that have been released; two more are slated for release within the next year and a half. I hope they give us more Pinhead and more over the top gore. I think I will go back and start watching the series from the start again. You should, too.",1086480000,29,5596,4.848484848484849

With every sequel, this series becomes less and less *Hellraiser*.  True fans of the film should just agree that the series ended with the second movie.  After all, if Pinhead had so failed that he was on the ""Pillar of Torment"" at the end, for what reason would Leviathan (pretty much the *Hellraiser* equivalent of the Devil) ever release Pinhead?
Dimension Films, for the Love of Leviathan, please STOP churning out these abominations!
P.S.  --  I'm not sure, but I think the ""Butterball"" Cenobite as well Chatterer can be very briefly seen in this one.  And I agree that generally speaking, the Cenobites were very poorly done this time.",1081036800,3,1172,4.74384236453202
1736886,2,B00006ADFZ,"This is going to be short. I didn't like this movie for a few reasons:
a) Little emphasis was put on plot explanation.
b) We didn't get to see a lot of Pinhead.
c) It wasn't obvious enough that the man had tried to kill Kirsty.
d) This movie was just stupid; most useless crap ever. Pinhead had little airtime, and I'm sorry, but they dragged that movie out way too much.
Screw you guys, I'm going home.
And oh yeah, Pinhead?

1736887,1,B00006ADFZ,This movie could have been better if they had decide not to release it at all. It was so bad that I got scared thinking of the how bad it was. Rather than seeing it I would recommend drowning yourself. It confuses you so much I can't even remember who I am. And Pinhead could easily get owned by my grandmother. This movie sucked. 1 star is generous.,1080432000,2,350,4.161764705882353
1736888,2,B00006ADFZ,"First off let me say that two stars is really being two kind. This is another one on the list of terrible sequels. It's probably just me, but it seems like the more of these movies they make, the worse it gets, and the less we see of Pinhead and the Cenobites. This wasn't scary at all. Frankly, I was bored to tears, and this is a total disgrace to Hellraiser fans. Inferno was already bad enough and they had the nerve to make another (horrible) sequel to add to the franchise. Let's admit it, Inferno was a cop thriller...not a Hellraiser (that was the first clue). They waited 4 whole sequels later to bring back Kirsty Cotton for Hellseeker, and that's the second clue that they are truely running out of ideas. I think the first Hellraiser was a classic, and now it's time to end the madness.",1077753600,,798,4.3624161073825505
1736889,5,B00006ADFZ,"This installment brings us back to the original Hellraiser, and is just as good. The first Hellraiser showed us how far one is willing to go to get what they desire. This film shows us the consequences of those actions. This film very successfully captures Clive Barker's vision of hellraiser. It is not about a slasher killer, but about dark desires and torment. Pinhead was never meant to be a Jason or Freddy or etc...He is a demon whom wishes to inflict suffering.
  It is refreshing to see a horror film based not upon special effects and bloodshed, but rather storytelling. You have to use your own imagination a bit. It is a much more mature film than many other horror offerings. I don't mean XXX mature, but more appealing than childish killing sprees as in Hellraiser 3 and Bloodlines. This movie is reminds me a bit of Books of Blood, even though Barker had nothing to do with this Hellraiser.
  Now this movie didn't have a mega budget, but the effects are still well done. This isn't a Masterpiece of Cinema, we have to remember it is Hellraiser and judge it upon that. This is the best horror film to come around in a while in my opinion. The horror aspect is more directed toward mental and emotioinal torture as opposed to physical pain. While pinhead has a minimal and elusive role in the film I found it satisfactory. Sometimes holding back is just as good as giving it all.
  I would put this film in the same league as Fallen, In the Mouth of Madness, and other such films. Overall I was really surprised with this film. I watched it with low expectations after reading so many negative reviews but it really pleased me. I would recommend this if you enjoy a thinking horror film as opposed to just watching blood run, though that can be fun at times also.

For all you Hellbound fanatics look at it this way, Arthraxiah (the female cenobite) mentioned to Kirsty how they always kept finding each other and how it seemed inevitable.  Well this movie finally set the finality of that, when Kirsty... albiet with the Cenobites help, commited premeditated murder.  Kirsty was always bad.  Selfish, prone to violence.... and this movie just cemented that.
Also, Hell on Earth, Bloodlines, and Inferno tried to go for the shock value horror icons of the series where this movie brought out the true nature.  It is a dark look into ourselves and what we primortally desire.  And Pinhead doesn't need to be ripping people apart through the movie to show that... the chains are just a sign of the most humiliating, suffering pain.

If you're gonna turn a movie into a cash cow then you might as well pimp its most popular character for everything it's worth and give the fans what they want to see.
Sadly, this movie which seems promising (especially with the return of Ashley Laurance) is just boring.

1736901,4,B00006ADFZ,"I was truly and pleasantly surprised by the sixth installment of the Hellraiser saga.  In the horror genre, it is typical for sequels to turn into parodies of the original (e.g., Friday the 13th and Leprechaun went as far as placing the hero in outer space!) as the producers struggle to create a bigger and ""badder"" version of the same story.  That is not the case with Hellraiser.  But while there is no attempt to make a bigger and badder Hellraiser, clearly the story has morphed from the sheer horror of Hellraiser 1 into a more surreal, suspenseful drama ending with the ultimate horror: the ironic hopelessness of being forever trapped in a living hell.  This transformation was most evident in Hellraiser: Inferno, which some found hard to follow with all its clever twists.  Hellseeker is easier to follow, but every bit as eerie and surreal as Inferno.  The strong points of Hellseeker are its ability to keep you guessing, the surprising yet logical conclusion, the overwhelming feeling of eeriness from beginning to end, and the scriptwriter's ability to keep key elements of the Hellraiser history intact while exploring new characters and a new approach.  The weaker points, and they are few, are some pacing problems about half way into the movie where the story almost crawls to a halt, and at the ending, where Pinhead literally has to tell you he is going explain everything.  It's almost as if the director felt that without Pinhead's intro, the movie would have been lost on the viewers.  (Please give us some credit!)
By the way, what was with the packaging?  The description of the story on the back of the DVD is way off target (did the person who wrote that even see the movie?).",1056844800,4,1703,4.761904761904762
1736902,5,B00006ADFZ,"I'm not sure I understand the hatred for this movie, the sixth installment of the Hellraiser film series. The negative online reviews I've read don't shed much light as to why they disliked this movie. At a guess, I'd say it's because Clive Barker has pretty much detached his name from the franchise.  After watching some of the recent sequals (ex: ""Bloodlines"" and ""Inferno""), it isn't hard to figure out why he'd wish to distance himself. ""Hellseeker"" on the other hand, while being far from perfect, took the essence of Barker's original story and began to tread new ground. At the very least, it was a far cry from ""Hell On Earth,"" where Pinhead was no longer an indifferent presence, but a malevolent participant.
Like all the other horror movie ""monsters"" emerging from the late 70s and 80s, I think Pinhead and the Hellraiser franchise has had its day. There are bigger, better ideas to explore. Most of the newer horror films out there are formulaic, and leaves the viewer bereft of any sympathy for the characters. Hellraiser was interesting, because there was no formula to the story. And at a guess, it opened up the eyes of many closeted S&M fetishests. Pleasures and torments of the flesh and mind. It has a sort of grotesque/horrifying beauty to it.
Anyhow, the flood gates opened a long time ago. S&M has a very open following, leaving the horrors of Hellraiser flat and under nourished. The essence of Hellraiser has lost its sting, which is why I believe ""Hellseeker"" to be a worthy final chapter in the series. Of the myriad sequals that followed ""Hellraiser,"" this movie seems to care enough about the characters to solidify itself as one of the better films from the series. And with the appearence of Ashley Lawerence, ""Hellseeker"" also radiates a full-circle aura.
And so...for ""Hellraiser"" completists, this is the film for you. For casual fans like myself, it's a good movie to have on the shelf next to ""Hellraiser"" and the first sequal, ""Hellbound.""",1056585600,3,1976,4.828908554572271

I'm grateful to all those involved.",1051228800,3,400,4.897058823529412
1736905,2,B00006ADFZ,"It seems like an eternity ago when Miramaxs' genre label Dimension Films had acquired the rights to continue the story of Clive Barkers' dark and sordid 'Hellraiser' series. It seemed like the perfect partnership: 'Hellraiser' had become a strong franchise with the first three entries and Dimension was building its catalogue with rough and ready hits like 'From Dusk Til Dawn'. Oh, we rejoiced. Oh, we were wrong. Yeah for every 'From Dusk Till Dawn' there was a plethora of 'Children of the Corns', 'Mimic' sequels, and oh my, what had they done to 'Hellraiser'? Okay, I could go on about how 'Hellrasier: Bloodline' was akin to watching paint dry, how 'Hellraiser: Inferno' seemed like an episode of 'NYPD Blue' spliced with a Charles Band quickie, but these things couldn't get any worse. could they? Surely, someone at Dimensions Films must have seen the original 'Hellraiser' and realised the awful mistake they were making? Well, judging from this entry suitably called 'Hellseeker', no one at Dimension was watching anything (least of all Parts 1-3), and soon enough for Dimension, none of the audience will be watching either.
The bland, bland story concerns Trevor (OZ's Dean Winters) who survives a car accident. However, his wife does not. And, so begins 90 minutes of tedium as Trevor hallucinates dark sexual fantasies, gory happenings and visions of 'ol Pinhead himself. It seems, that Trevor once purchased that damn annoying puzzle box and given it to his wife before their untimely accident. Oh yeah, did I mention who the wife was? Well, 'Hellraiser' fans she's Ashley Laurence returning as Kirsty from the original trilogy. But, don't let that second billing fool you - she only appears for about 10 minutes max and the rest of the picture concerns Trevor bumbling around, jolting from one fake dream incident to the next. The film itself seems like an unofficial remake of 'Hellraiser: Inferno' and the sense of deja vu hits you around every five minutes of the (overly)long running time.
This sequels plus points are minimal. However, cinematographer turned director Rick Bota does a stirling job at helming the material. Its just that his film (as with all of Dimensions previous sequels) doesn't feel like a 'Hellraiser' movie, and you wonder why they don't just drop the 'Hellraiser' headline and treat these movies as another entity altogether. Its a shame that the obviously tacked-on Pinhead trappings couldn't have been jettisoned early on, and Bota could have delivered a stronger movie without the expectation of another film. On the acting front, Dean Winters is fine as the lead, and Doug Bradley is always welcome to see in full Pinhead make-up. Even, Ashley Laurences' brief appearance is siatisfying (check out her confrontation with Pinhead in the deleted scenes if you need a flashback to the original trilogy).
The disc is fine, with an audio commentary from Bota and a selection of deleted scenes. Picture and audio quality is pretty good. The 'Seven-esque' bleached-out picture quality is due to the look of the film, rather than the DVD presentation. To sum up, another disappointment for 'Hellraiser' fans, not a particularly bad film in itself, just not a brilliant one. It would help if Dimension sold this property on to other parties who probably want to make a genuine 'Hellraiser' movie, instead of these similarly themed time wasters that ultimately please no one in the end, especially those who were actually looking for a good time seeking hell . . .",1050796800,2,3504,5.032702237521515

Pinhead is one of the biggest badguys, but that is not enough when the movies are way out of line. When the movies are made to show only blood and action, and no real story, it doesn't please me much. I'm glad that stopped with Bloodline. When I first saw Inferno, I couldn't belive it. It was a deep movie, and you didn't see almost anything of Pinhead. And it just got better in Hellseeker. I was looking foreward to see the goodgirl from the original Hellraiser and Hellbound in the Hellraiser-legacy again, but she was just acting in the beginning and the end...maybe 5-10 minutes, and surprisingly, I didn't care. Bouth Inferno and Hellseeker has a good, deep, Seven-alike and very differnt story than at least Hellbound, Hellraiser III and Bloodline. More of that.

This reminds me of a extremely bad X-files episode. The cenobites, if that's what you call them. The showing of them was so quick, hell it could have been Pamela Anderson and Howard Stern in Patent Leather Bondage Suits.
As for Pinhead he lost all his edge with these last two installments. He is no longer the Prince of flesh, pleasure, and pain who would tear your soul apart. He is the Dr. Do Good saying, ""Well it's O.K. this time, but next time i'll have to tear you apart"" or ""Let's make a deal. 5 souls for your soul"" . In since he is like the Grinch. His heart grew 5 times too much and that's alot when you didn't have one.
There was only one good scene and guess what???They cut it out. It gave more background on the Lament Configuration. They thought we didn't care about the Mythos..Hellraiser is Mythos.

1736930,3,B00006ADFZ,"Hellraiser: Hellseeker is not a departure for the series. It's basically an Inferno-like story but without a number of elements that made the predecessor work on its own terms.
I can't not like this movie though, as for one, it brings back Ashley Laurence to the series, and two, it throws a mean twist at us in the end. I'm not sure what I think of the writers turning Kirsty ""bad"", but I applaud the effort to combine a new story with elements of the prequels.
This movie is patched together from a number of familiar films--Memento, Jacob's Ladder, Angel Heart, Hellraiser. There's not much of Pinhead until the end and there is very, very little of the Cenobites. Of course someone ends up snagged by a bunch of metal hooks and ripped apart, but then we get a bizarre scene. Kirsty meets up with Pinhead and...offers him a deal which he accepts. Ashley Laurence looks even better today, but she still is not much of an actress. ""Wait! How about a deal?"" And then Pinhead thinks about it and says, ""Interesting."" Uh, are these the same characters we've seen in other movies?
The Hellraiser story is frustrating, but the rest of the film has a certain gritty appeal in its steely colors and quiet protagnoist. It's nowhere as noirish as Inferno was, but there's still a satisfying style for a low-budget straight-to-DVD release. There's really not much gore; the films have been getting more bloodless since Hell on Earth. And there's hardly any of the Cenobites. Disappointing.
I'm hoping the next installment of this series is better, period. I was looking forward to this and was disappointed, especially since they had Kirsty return and they had some liberty for creating a fresh story (after the one-off story of Inferno). Instead the film seems rushed, like they were running low on cash when making it and a so cut a small corner in every department. I do like the fact that Pinhead is used sparingly once again. After his over-extended onscreen time in Bloodline, they need to cut back. He shows up here longer than in Inferno but it's still a cameo and decent paycheck for Doug ""The Entire Hellraiser Franchise"" Bradley.
Whatever you think of Clive Barker being removed from the Hellraiser franchise, the folks at Dimension Films (who also own the Halloween franchise and the Leprechaun series) are keeping it going.
The DVD is really nice and features directory commentary, alternate scenes with commentary and a visual effects walkthrough.
Director Rick Bota is a cinematographer and he sets up some nice moody shots. However, he has some further explaining to do after you hear some of his director commentary on the deleted scenes. He decided to remove what would have been perhaps the best scene in the film because it would ""only appeal to fans of the series"". Huh?! This is a sad case of someone getting a shot at directing and then trying to elevate the genre flick he got into his ""work"". Did someone tell the guy that this was Hellraiser 6, and that the fans were the reason he was working?

Kirsty is sort of made into an opportunist, which I found disappointing, and a bit worse than her trading her soul for Uncle Frank's back in the opener.  The blurb on the back of the cover is really misleading, and I was expecting Kirsty to have more of a role in it.
I don't think it was as good as 1, 2 or 5.  (Yes, I loved Inferno!)  Better than 3 and 4 by a long shot.  The plot in this one does try to get back to the original (book) concept, too, which was a little lacking in 5.",1041984000,2,644,4.071428571428571

Hellraiser inferno was a better movie than this and that movie was lacking big time. The only reason to watch this movie would be for pin head and he is only in the movie for like 5 minutes. Also don't get exited over them bringing back kristie because shes barely in it and when she is shes totally different from the character you once knew. After I was done watching this peace of .... I became frusterated. The hellraiser series has gone to hell and I wouldnt mind if they quit if they keep on dishing out movies like this. I herd that there making another movie in the series lets just hope they reedeem themselves and try not to have some .... artistic vision and try to go back to the roots of the original and also put pinhead threw most of the movie.

1736935,1,B00006ADFZ,"Unlike some people I really enjoyed the HELLRAISER sequel that preceeded this one, INFERNO. It stuck more to the original concept (as in the original novel) than any of the other sequels, and actually had a new twist and a PLOT which is more than I can say for HELL ON EARTH (radio shack cenobites...ugg) and the idiotic, predictable BLOODLINE (Pinhead in Space, just like the stupid Leprechaun).
So after the series had been so greatly revived by part 5, I hoped, though doubted, that part 6 might be halfway watchable.
Firstly this movie is a rip-off of ANGEL HEART and JACOB'S LADDER. Secondly, it does the old ""it was only a dream"" trick every five minutes to the point where you cannot follow the plot at all. The only redemable moment is the ending which is commendable but isn't worth waiting for through the entirety of the boring, lame and redundant film.
Pass on this.
The interesting thing is that the people who own the rights to this series also own the rights to HALLOWEEN (or did). So if JASON VRS. FREDDY ever comes out and makes any profit, which it will no matter how campy it will doubtlessly be, then we will know whom Pinhead will eventually come face to face with. After that we can look forward to a reprise of the old monster movies like KING KONG VRS. GODZILLA which plagued the late fiftes and early sixties. Every horror movie icon will come back to fight another (which would also make for a great Playstaion 2 fighting game). THE FLY will fight LEATHERFACE. CHUCKY VRS. LEPRECHUAN is inevitable. THE THING could show up at SLEEPAWAY CAMP. Personally, I think once a franchise has reached up to part seven or, worse yet part 10 like FRIDAY THE 13TH, there is little left to do but go campy or call it quits. FREDDY went campy (super campy) by the first sequel. He knew what was up. Chucky and Leprechaun followed his lead, and Jason took his sweet time but he made it. Unless Hollywood finally lets PINHEAD and MYERS and the other greats finally rest in peace, then eventually they will be doomed to cinematic cheese. HALLOWEEN 8 (with Busta and Tyra) is an alarming warning of this.
Let's hope they let PINHEAD maintain his dignity and throw in the towel. Some horror icons are too magnificent to go cheesy. But as for Chucky and Jason, hey Hollywood: go nuts.",1040256000,2,2289,4.558252427184466

To the point were we started getting very frustrated with the way the movie danced around not alowing you to grab it and hold it. Without a doubt this plot was a tare off Jacobs ladder, a rip off The Others, with a back drop of a Xfiles maratathon. And of course a pinch of hellraiser (Because there was a total of 40 seconds of cinobites and a few mins of pinhead). No gore. No real blood baths. Just when the walls started coming down and classic hellraiser feelings started to flow though my body the movie was over. I was just really upset at how UNoriginal this movie was. maybe if Jacobs Ladder and The Others were never made would H6 be a movie worth bringing up. But those 2 movies exsist, and H6 totaly carbon copies them. Very disopointed.

1736937,1,B00006ADFZ,"Remember back when Hellraiser films used to, at least, be good gory B-movies, if nothing else. The original was a well made gothic noir and the first few sequels had interesting if not outright scary imagery. Of course, those days are long gone as evidenced by Hellseeker. A film that not only brings back Doug Bradley but also Ashley Laurence and proceeds to do absolutely nothing with them save for a few quick cameos. Despite what the back of the video box says, this movie is not so much about either of them as it is about Kirsty's husband, Trevor, stumbling from one leaden scene to the next in a repetative fashion for an hour and a half, searching for Kirsty who is missing and presumed dead. Depite the lukewarm reception fans gave the last Hellraiser, Inferno, this one essentually repeats that sequel's esthetic with a plot that owes a lot to Jacob's Ladder and revelations the viewer guessed long ago if he or she even still cares by the end. Without giving too much away, this film pretty much trashes anything that fans liked about the early films and those lementing that Pinhead was being turned into a Freddy Krugerish type of monster will look at those sequels as the good old days when at least the filmmakers gave him something to do. What's really sad is that while Jason, Chucky, and Michael Myers (which Dimension also owns the rights to)seem to be enjoying a revival in theaters, Pinhead is falling farther and farther down the abyss to made-for-TBS trashdom. The filmmakers seems to have lost any sense of what the Hellraiser films had that was unique or even a sense of what is scary (the new cenobites, what little is seen of them, are so cheaply done it's insulting) The franchise needs a blood transfusion fast.",1038096000,4,1740,4.652597402597403

1736939,2,B00006ADFZ,"Sad to say (although not unexpected) but the latest in the Hellraiser series is just plain boring.  The acting is fine, the directing is passable, the cinematography is middling but the story & pacing is pitiful.  As with the previous debacle ""Hellraiser: Inferno"", this film is plagued by too much exposition & not enough Pinhead.  It's similar to ""Inferno"" in that it's pretty much just a bland detective story with little of what made the initial films in the series so exciting.  I must admit the ending ""twist"" is mildly interesting but it take like eons to get to it despite the film's scant 85 minute running time.  Beyond the poor storyline I must take offense to the cinematography in that while it looks okay, it lacks the eye popping visuals of the past.  Where are the awesome set pieces, color schemes & general look of menace that graced the first few films?  I mean really...you have such an interesting palate to choose visuals from for a Hellraiser film & all you get here is a mostly straight-up, plain jane, vanilla shooting style.  Hellraiser should be exciting over the top crazy stuff & here it's just blah.  People return time & time again for the wild visuals & lots of cenebites.  With ""Hellseeker"" you get a little teaser here & there but then it's back to the lame-o storyline.  Nobody wants to see boring exposition.  We aren't here for ""Citizen Kane II"".  Get on with it & blow us away.  Make with the crazy Pinhead stuff & the fans will respond don'tcha know?  Why they insist on changing the formula is beyond me.  The fans are quickly dwindling for this once great series.  One last gripe...please oh please will someone stop with the ""quick cut, teaser violence for 5 seconds...followed by the inevitable ""Oh he was just dreaming & is now jarred out of the scene of terror while shaking his head in disbelief"""" schtick???  WOW, has that been done to death or what?  It's just a cheap way to get out of explaining what just happened.  That way they can show anything on screen & never have to rationalize it in a sane manner.  What a cheap & hackneyed out for the scriptwriter (not to mention cliched beyond flogging a dead horse idea of originality).  Every time there is a violent scene, the guy ""wakes up"" out of it like we've seen in all 1000 Freddy, Jason & sad to say now Pinhead flicks.  If you guys do another film...PLEASE for the love of all things horror fans cherish...get crackin' with the visuals, show more of our beloved cenebites & quit trying to bore us with your detective stories.

1736941,5,B00006ADFZ,I don't know why this movie is getting such bad reviews. (perhaps the lack of gore) It may well be the best since the original.

1736942,1,B00006ADFZ,"When the director of a film states in his commentary that ""we left [the best scenes in the movie] out because the only people who would appreciate it are the fans"", you know you are in for something bad. This film was horrible, and totally dissrespected the original Hellraiser, and Hellraiser II films. How Clive Barker could have approved of this piece of trash is beyond me.
Dean Winters needs to go back to acting school. The writers also need to take a few lessons in creating exposition that will keep the watcher's interest. In the audio commentary, the director says that he cut out most of the dialogue that made sense of the film and kept it interesting because he wanted to keep it short. At an hour and 29 minutes, the film could have sorely benefited from the extra scenes. Why they would chose to cut short Kirsty's scene with Pinhead at the end is beyond me - it is the best scene in the film.
One would think that they would have learned from Hellraiser:Inferno. This treads very similarly along the same lines. Pinhead has little screen time as well. The thing that most upset me about this film however was the fact they made Kirsty a somewhat borderline evil character. When you have a fan favorite in horror movies, a hero or heroine, the worst thing you can do is turn them into a villian.
Without ruining the plot, I will say that they totally betray what they portrayed Kirsty as in the first two films. Instead of the heroine, she takes on aspects of Julia from the first film and becomes completely unlikeable by the time the movie is over.
Also they chose to cut out any exposition explaining Kirsty's whereabouts since the last film at the risk of ""confusing people who have never seen the first two"". Who the heck would buy this unless they were a Hellraiser fan to begin with? Yet at the end, the film takes elements from the first two, that at the director's admission will only make sense to those who have seen the first two.
Again, a sore excuse to call a movie a ""Hellraiser"" and use Pinhead in it. It seems more like a movie that you would find on Showtime late night with B-rate acting and a really awful script. Poor Ashley Laurence.
And finally - what happened to Tiffany! (and I don't mean the 80s singer)
My advice to anyone considering watching or buying is to save your money and rewatch or buy Hellraiser or Hellbound.
I only hope that the next Hellraiser installment, which sounds somewhat like a copy of latest Halloween plot where they are stuck in a house with cameras and Pinhead, is somewhat better!",1037664000,,2548,4.505399568034557
1736943,1,B00006ADFZ,"Hellseeker had a lot of potential to be good. With Ashley Laurence returning as Kirsty, and Dean Winters, you have a returning characer and a good actor who could have stired up a little noise in a franchise that is getting more stale by the sequel, but unfortunately it didn't do it.
There are just too many problems with this movie. Most important is the terrible script. While the overall concept is alright, there are too many scenes that don't make any sense nor do they help the narrative; they are there simply to be spooky. Unfortunately, they don't ""spook"", instead, they just confuse. The script could have left out several scenes and it would have no effect on the overall movie.
Another problem with the script, is that Ashley Laurence has returned...but to do what!? Her character of Kirsty is hardly in it! This is where the movie could have benefitted from, but instead, she's hardly in the movie. This kills because the characters of Kirsty and Pinhead have a past together, and to have them both in a Hellraiser again would have made for some great scenes and dialouge, but they're only on screen together for no more than a minute!!
The third problem with the script is that it's written to be way too ""artsy-fartsy"". There really is no terrifing moments, so the film relies too much on editing and ""spooks"" that try to add atmosphere to the overall movie. What you get is a mix of Hellraiser:Inferno and Jacob's Ladder. This is really sad, because one of horror's most original movies has become another victim to ""Sequel-itise"". In fact, it's very close to being called ""Hellraiser: Inferno part 2"".
At this point you might be thinking that I'm going waaay into how bad the script is, but when you see it, you'll understand.
There are little things that don't help this movie, like the fact that Chatterer has returned(though, in a brief, and I mean BRIEF cameo), but the other two original cenobytes didn't. How could Chatterer return and not the other two?
I actually did have the chance to meet Pinhead himself: Doug Bradley, in Arizona a few Halloween's ago. He told me that the one thing he was most proud of the Hellraiser series, was that no matter how bad the sequels may be, they at least did something different everytime. Well, that was true, until now. Hellseeker is very close to being the same movie Inferno was, but only a few things difference.
Overall, this movie is a big let-down. If you hated Inferno (which is the response from most people I talk to), then Hellseeker isn't gonna make you smile either.",1037145600,,2543,4.665924276169265

Pinhead is back to torture more humans but this time Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Lawrence) is back to fight him.  Not quite.  You see in the very beggining she dies in a car wreck.  Ooh that can damper any good vs evil plans.  From there the movie spirals into a weird world where the main man Trevor (Dean Winters) is suffering from a major concussion and is having very strange dreams while ""getting it on"" with about every girl he meets.  Pinhead plays a small role once again but a larger role than in Inferno.  However like the first two and inferno there is no reference to the biblical hell that three and four tried to pull off, instead it is more in the realm that Clive Barker had origionally intended.  This one will not please fans just as Inferno did not please fans.  However if you are in the mood for some really strange stuff, and a dark yet compelling tale, than this is the way to go.

It is also very similar to Inferno.  True Hellraiser fans should add it to there collection, but be pre-warned Pinhead raises no hell.

Although I do own every Hellraiser that they have made, I personally don't agree with the direction the filmmakers have taken with the series.  I would rather them stick with what the first two installments was about.  I will say that the acting of this movie was great, but the story line was a bit poor.  I was I guess hoping for Kristy's character to save her husband, or save someone, instead of the direction it did take.  For those who haven't seen it yet, I won't give the ending.  I believe that the true Hellraiser fans will be a bit disappointed with this one, as it tries to incorperate the other hellraisers and then tries not to refer to them.  I guess of fear that whom ever will watch this movie won't be left out if they haven't seen the rest of the series.  Even though I was a bit disappointed with this installment, I would have to say that this movie was quite better than bloodline or inferno.

But do not be decieved, there is not a lot of Pinhead in this movie until near the end--and only then does it seem like like Pinhead isn't a sharp as he has been.

The only thing that did not make me give the movie one star was the ending.  I am not going to be blower and blow it away, but it was an incredible ending.

Hellseeker revolves around this man (who was awesome in TV show Oz, his character is weak and under-written here) having bad dreams and flash backs. When we think the movie is finally moving forward, it just jumps into another drawn-out, confusing flash back. It's like the director totally stole on Vanilla Sky where the viewers had no idea what was going on for an hour of the movie. Unlike Vanilla sky, the only difference in Hellseeker, is that the twist of the end does not nearly make up for it. Doug Bradly should refuse to star in such trash, where Pinhead is the least displayed and contained. These straight-to-video, cheap Hellraiser films could be so much better with a true to originals plot, some true graphic violence and gore, and NOT LIKE THE LAST THREE PARTS!
The director (Rick Bota) and people behind the recent Hellraiser sequels (especially this one) actually think and say that fans will enjoy this???! Thanks for ruining everything once again and pissing fans off everywhere! If these are not going to be in the theater, it is more the reason to make them insane, graphic, and powerful, like the first 3 parts! (especially 1+2, thank you Clive Barker) If your not going to make a true, stylish, dark, gory, violent Hellraiser like parts 1-3, then STOP MAKING THEM! And stop making crap that revolves around one victim the whole movie, it is B-O-R-I-N-G!
This ""Hellseeker"" sequel (I rented two days ago) only brings my impression of Pinhead down. These sequels are HURTING the originals. They stopped making sense with Bloodline. This is NOT how Hellraiser films are supposed to be! Pinhead says his one-liners for less than 5 minutes again!!! I waited two and a half years for this ...? A totally boring, repetitive plot. Pinhead is about total power, chaos, violence, intellect. In Hellseeker, just like in Inferno (but much worse) Pinhead is once again messing with one-persons head until we find out why the last 5 minutes of the movie. The cenobites were just there. They did not come through to our world at all. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!! Hollywood will do anything to make money. This is a perfect example. The director could have at lease gave some justice to the plot and how things happen. I could direct and write stuff much better than this. I have been a writer and a TRUE FAN since 1987, but I have lost all hope, especially after the unacceptable video-release of Hellseeker. True fans are very sad that the director and production have continued this weak, slow, non-violent, mystery-story approach regarding the follow-ups to a once classic series. Hellseeker is the worst in the series, I don't even consider them sequels anymore. Each chapter after part 4 (Bloodline) are like side these side-stories about one guy. It's just not Hellraiser anymore. It doesn't explore the amazing, interesting, violent unknown: as Clive Barker did it.",1035504000,2,3013,4.898238747553816

Inferno was a true step in the right direction, after the abhorrent 3 and bland 4. But what was missing was some good character dialogue between The Cenobites and the main character. This missing element is more than restored in Hellseeker. Dean Winter's acting is top-notch, while the plot will keep you dazzled. The Cenobites as a whole are barely in it, but Pinhead is more prominent in this one than in Inferno. Also, watch for Doug Bradley's extra role. It's his voice that gives him away.
My only complaint about this DVD is the features. While certainly a step up from the nothing on 4 and the 2-minute blurbs on 5, we only get teases of what could truly be. The menus are crap with no thought put into them whatsoever. The special effects feature is under 5 minutes. While the alternate scenes are most definitely worth watching, they left a bunch out. These detriments are the sole reason why I left a star off my rating.

Pinhead makes a small appearance, his makeup looks TERRIBLE, and they can't even hide his new ""beer gut"" in a girdle for the costume...it was horrible!  And the other cenobites were nothing more than quick cameos on the screen, and while this did work in ""The Ring"" (dont even get me started on this movie...wow!), it didn't work in this flick.

7966229,2,B00006ADFZ,Ashley Laurence returns as kirsty cotton. This movie actually made me mad. We could have had a film focusing on the relationship between kirsty and pinhead. Instead we got 1 great scene between them and the rest of the movie is forgettable . the director really failed fans of the series big time !,1523491200,,298,4.537037037037037

7966234,4,B00006ADFZ,"Hellseeker is frequently ignored because it's a later Hellraiser movie and, let's be fair, their quality varies wildly. But Hellseeker gives us the return of Kirsty Cotton and cements her as one of the most stone-cold heroines in the history of horror. And for that, it gets four stars.",1482192000,,286,4.857142857142857

7966236,1,B00006ADFZ,This movie was the worst of the series and probably was the reason the franchise stopped.  This movie was boring and almost nothing like the other movies in the series.,1479859200,,168,4.6
