8211447,4,B000TYV3BW,"I liked this one almost as much as the first installment of the series, which had less clips but better picture. On this one they kind of scrapped the bottom of the barrel in that department. Clips are musically fantastic with mostly very good LPCM audio but the pic leaves a lot to be wished either because of quality origin and/or video compression. 107' with lossless audio in a single-layer DVD, REALLY ?! Plus some of the clips are mastered at a way higher bitrate than others, so quality really varies a lot. Paradoxically The Lords Of The New Church live clip looks and sounds lightyears better than on the KTEL dedicated release with the full concert. Wished I could have that good a quality for that one. They really dropped the ball there but then again maybe Cherry Red had a better source from where to cull it.

A lot of the bands are the same as on the first one, just different songs/clips but others really called my attention because I love to give unheard-of bands a try. There are 26 clips from 26 different bands and I liked almost all of them, which is rare for a comp in which there's always material you press the skipbutton on.

BUT......I'd recommend getting it from a bargain bin or Amazon at a low price because quality is not so hot to pay top dollar for it.",1403136000,,1286,4.421940928270042
