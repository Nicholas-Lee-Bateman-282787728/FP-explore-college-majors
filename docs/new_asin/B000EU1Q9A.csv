The movie lasted only 33 minutes...thank goodness, and 8 eight those minutes was watching a helicopter fly towards an island.  Sorry Harrison Ford, not one of you best!",1352592000,,311,4.517857142857143

I didn't know what to expect from this film when I first got it.  After all, with a title like ""Lost Worlds,"" I thought this was a metaphor for lost places in history that had been re-discovered.

Well, not quite.  The ""lost worlds"" in this documentary are the worlds humans pay little attention too: the worlds or ecosystems found in nature like soil or ordinary dirt.  The film also delves into how we must protect these lost worlds of nature so we can ""protect ourselves.""

The film begins in, of all places, New York City.  But it ends by examining a ""biological island lost in time"" that is like a ""natural  laboratory.""

This film was first released to IMAX theatres.

The narrator is Indiana Jones himself, Harrison Ford.  There is also some narration by a scientist.  The narration does not attempt to overwhelm the viewer with to many details but highlights only that which is important.

Found throughout is fantastic cinematography, photography (microscopic, underwater, and aerial), and even computer graphics.

Research for this film was provided by a ""Science Advisory Group"" composed of an impressive list of fifteen names from outstanding institutions.  Filming was on location in Venezuela, Guatemala, Quebec, New York, and California.

Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2006) is perfect in picture and audio quality.  It has five extras.

In conclusion, this is a fantastic film with an important message.  I leave you with the printed onscreen words of one of the film's science advisors found at the very end:

""What could be more inspiring than to begin the age of restoration, reweaving the wondrous diversity of life that still surrounds us?""

(2001;  40 min;  wide screen;  12 scenes)

Here are a few of the things I liked.  The fact that they showed scenery with people around it so that you could get an idea of the scale.  The waterfall shot.  The black frog that cannot jump.  The way they put everything together in a ""circle of life"".

They also explained everything in a simple manner.  This would be a short film that kids could enjoy.",1208736000,,518,4.257731958762887
