8511500,4,B00772HRZK,"""Monsieur Lahzar"" (2011 from Canada; 94 min.) brings the poignant story of a school in Montreal rocked by the suicide of a teacher of 11 and 12 year olds. The opening scene, in which one of the school kids, designated to distribute the daily milk carts and then sees the teacher hanging from the class room ceiling, is almost shocking.

The school needs to regroup, and, more importantly, find a replacement teacher. Not surprinsingly, there is no ruch of applicants, and then out of nowhere shows ip Bashir Lazhar, literally off the street putting in his candidacy. Lahzar is from Algeria, and we only find out later in the movie why he is now in Canada (without wanting to give too much away, the political problems in Algeria are prominent). You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out, but the main focus of the movie is how Lahzar interacts with these young kids, in particular how they deal with the previous teacher's suicide, and that in and of itself is the main reason to watch this movie (it reminded me at times, on a different level of course, of ""To Sir, With Love"". Sophie N&eacute;lisse as the ""teacher's pet"" Alice and &Eacute;milien N&eacute;ron as Simon, the young troubled boy, give outstanding performances, as does Mohamed Sad Fellag as the teacher.

With this, I've now seen all 5 movies that were nominated for this year's Best Foreign Movie Oscar, and what a strong group it was. Iran's ""A Separation"" won the Oscar, but all other 4 movies are very much worth seeing. ""Monsieur Lahzar"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1336262400,,1547,4.725925925925926
8511501,5,B00772HRZK,"I saw the film this evening, and I was very impressed. Some of my friends are immigrants, leaving the home country to get away from violence, military rule, and more. I think the director has brilliantly captured the ""homeless"" immigrant who cannot go back and yet is faced with high barriers in the new country. Those who like a first-rate film and/or are interested in the immigrant experience should see this film.",1335657600,,417,4.805555555555555
8511502,3,B00772HRZK,"When a popular teacher hangs herself overnight in the classroom and is discovered the next morning, the pupils (all about 12 years old) are traumatised. No one wants to take over the class so the principal is relieved when Monsieur Lazhar, an immigrant from Algeria, turns up and volunteers to take over. This Canadian film is a gentle examination of grief and how children cope with the unexpected loss of someone close to them and how the effects last much longer than is convenient for the adults to acknowledge. Monsieur Lazhar's methods are unusual and unorthodox and yet the kids take to him and seem to be recovering. As we learn separately, Lazhar has his own emotional burdens, and this helps him understand what the class is going through and how long the grieving process can take. The acting by the children is uniformly excellent and Sophie Nelisse in particular is simply astounding. The film is worth watching for her alone.

  The problem with the movie is that the character of Lazhar is too flat and stripped of emotion and only at the end do we get a hint -- and it is only a hint -- of what he must be feeling. Without giving away too much of the plot, there are a couple of moments where the script is weak and detracts from the overall effect. That said, it's well worth watching.",1334534400,,1302,4.555555555555555
8511503,5,B00772HRZK,"This is a beautiful film, brilliantly acted.  There are many comic and touching moments.  The film brings to mind the saying that ""grief takes a thousand tellings.""  Often we forget that, especially when it comes to children.  I loved this film and look forward to seeing it again.",1331942400,2,281,4.791666666666667
