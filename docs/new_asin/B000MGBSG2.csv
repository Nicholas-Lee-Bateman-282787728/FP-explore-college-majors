8168934,5,B000MGBSG2,"My 5-year old daughter absolutely loves the Mysteries! She's spouting information that she learned for hours after each episode. ""Momma, did you know..."" These are great for a pre-K!",1218326400,,182,5.310344827586207
8168935,4,B000MGBSG2,"I like this video a lot, it is wholesome, pleasant and has nice story lines. No dark, sinister stuff here. My problem is that I bought this for my 27 month old, and the mysteries are a little beyond him right now. There are several mystery stories and a few ""non mystery"" stories, so we just forward to the ""non mystery"" stories and he enjoys them. I imagine he will be really into the mystery based in about a year, but for now, he's really just wanting to see Jay-Jay, Tracy and the gang in flight.",1214697600,,500,4.21875
8168936,5,B000MGBSG2,My son is 3 1/2 and my daughter is 1 1/2 and the both LOVE this movie.  They have watched it over and over and it keeps their attention.  We will definitely be buying more Jay Jay movies.,1208736000,,187,3.8947368421052633
8168937,5,B000MGBSG2,My daughter just received this video for her 2nd birthday and is obsessed with it.,1205712000,,82,4.533333333333333
8168938,5,B000MGBSG2,"When I first saw the show, I was simultaneously fascinated and horrified by these creatures. Who are they? Where do they come from? Where exactly does their world exist? How come there are no other sentient beings around, and where do they get their manufactured goods from? Obviously they have no means of production. I mean, airplanes with human faces?!?!?  Is it some kind of sick biomechanical experiment?

Then it hit me. What I'm about to explain to you is one of the best kept secrets in children's television.......

Jay Jay and his world are actually a virtual reality environment. In the far future, some segments of society, for a variety of reasons, will choose to upload their consciousness into a variety of VR environments, all housed in a massively powerful supercomputer. What we are viewing in the teletubbies is just one of those environments being broadcast backwards in time from the far future. Think about it, it explains EVERYTHING and makes perfect sense. Another good example of this is the teletubbies.",1201824000,,1029,4.97093023255814
8168939,4,B000MGBSG2,"When my son received this toy, he immediately loved it.  Not one to play with anything but balls, this toy sparked his imagination.  It is well built and my children love it.",1199404800,,174,4.40625
8168940,1,B000MGBSG2,"This Jay Jay dvd is fully different from PBS Kids episodes of Jay Jay the Jet Plane. Many episodes have a new character that speaks Spanish all the time. This DVD is great if you speak and understand Spanish. Otherwise, it is a waste of money. I would rather record from my PBS.",1199318400,,278,4.264150943396227
