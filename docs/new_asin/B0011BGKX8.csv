8241306,2,B0011BGKX8,"I am exteremly dissaponited with this purchase. If you have already previous Winsor pilates dvds , then don't buy this one. because all the moves are same except on this dvd all the same moves with the ball.. thats it ..
so there is nothing exciting about this dvd . I love Winsor pilates, it helped me alot . I was looking for new moves .
BUT if you don't have any other Winsor pilates video and you are new to pilates , then buy it .",1386633600,,435,4.011494252873563
8241307,4,B0011BGKX8,I really like this.  It does get harder and more intense after the first 30 mins.  Stretch out before you do this.,1365465600,,114,4.136363636363637
8241308,5,B0011BGKX8,I love Pilates as it has drastically helped back and neck issues I have as well as toning and weight loss. Adding in the core strengthening stability ball just makes this tape pop! It's a great no impact workout that hits those muscle's hard yet through gentle and easy to follow movements. Great addition to every fitness routine!,1217635200,2,331,4.724137931034483
