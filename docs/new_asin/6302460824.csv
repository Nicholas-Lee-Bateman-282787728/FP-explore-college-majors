The Rodney King Trial and subsequent riot have long been misrepresented in the Media and history. The Media portrayed the officers as violent racist thugs, when in fact they were in compliance with their agency's policies and procedures with respect to Use of Force, yet everyone including the President of the United States at that time (Bush 41) portrayed the officers as wrong. The officers were found not-guilty by their peers, who saw the entire incident, rather than the few seconds shown on t.v.. So to continue the pursuit of ""Justice"" the officers were tried in Federal Court, with an 'Urban Jury"", which is a code word for black jury, and justice was served by sending the officers and their Sergeant to prison. And it should be noted the Sergeant never struck a single blow against Mr. King. Too bad we fail to hold politicians to that level of accountability, so that if their subordinates do wrong we send the politician to prison. The video may be difficult for those who are not experienced in the reality of the law, since American Justice is not swift. However, anyone who sees this will learn much about the system of justice and Injustice. These officers were not racists. Others in the vehicle with King were not abused. These officers were sacrificed and slaughtered on the alter of Political Correctness, and as a result of that cowardice on the part of L.A.P.D. and the Media; dozens of people died needlessly. And I fear that history will repeat itself  in the coming days when a verdict is reached in the Trayvon Martin.",1372550400,,1693,4.719594594594595
