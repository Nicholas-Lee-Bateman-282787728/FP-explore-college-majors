8438096,5,B004QFS4TE,"I notice that I tend to love movies that many Indian reviewers don't like -- maybe it is a cultural thing. First, I love Akshay Kumar and try to watch everything he is in. Second, I love Anushka Sharma and I think they work well together. It's a classic story of father/son conflict with an Indian twist. For Americans, it may not seem very realistic because of the amount of control the father has over the son, but accept the cultural differences and go with it. Attractive and funny cast and some good songs.",1393804800,2,511,4.446808510638298

You go from depressed to happy and elated as he find's himself again, not to mention way better  looking again ....couldn't help it insert chuckle here.

 NRI Sikh Indians in London in the 80's were being brutalized by skin heads and after suffering the vicious murder of a family member Gattus (Akshay) father becomes a vigilant activist. Terrified for the safety of her child, Gattus mother ( Akshay's real life mother in law Dimple Kapadia) cuts her son's hair off to make him appear more overtly British .This is something a Sikh would normally never tolerate. He is allowed to continue this way in his youth and he is  raised in British schools as a British citizen .The story is told with sporadic vocal overlays by Akshay as Gattu . It is all pertinent and the tonal quality of his voice helps to keep an extended empathy in the story line. You see him become a cricket superstar at his schools . He has been raised by his parents to love the game of cricket and has the chance after school to play for his home team London southall. His dad screams and carries on and emotionally bullies and blackmails him into giving up his dream. No son of his will play for the British . Gattu points out that he can't play for India because he is a British citizen . This makes no difference to his father . His word is Law. Flash forward to the future and he's a wooden obedient convenience store owner. A dream in suspended animation trapped in an emotional wasteland. Everyone in the extended family has been bullied into doing what Gattus father, Gurtej, is comfortable with . Forget any aspirations you might have.  The constant once necessary battles with the police are now trotted out as petty habit.  You begin to palpably feel the oppression that the family is living under. The greatest victim is Akshay; caught in the crunch of  trying desperately to live up to his fathers expectations and his relatives dreams . Ostracized in his own home with no acceptance by anyone has wiped any semblance of his former self from his current life. He is shown doing a mind numbing routine of work to home, work to home and occasionally a ritual of cricket bowling in the night like a thief . Instead of gold he steals a semblance of peace for the lost dream screaming inside of him.  This is a fast progression story line, you're only about 15 minutes in so don't look away or it will be your loss.

Lest any viewers think this movie would be depressing , remember I said the first fifteen minutes or so. You also in the first five minutes get to meet the adorable Anushka Sharma pouring her heart and soul into a well written part of irritant / savior . Into everyone's life a little rain must fall but you have to be ready for the cloud breaks (especially in London ) and Anushka is a sure sign there is a little rainbow waiting to pop out. The rest of the cast is represented by some unknowns that do a great job and will keep you laughing when you aren't wanting to strangle them.

  A cricket strike is called and Akshay gets a second chance at tryouts. An old neighbor who saw him practicing at night mentions him to the board. They need a bowler while the strikers are out. He refuses but his family is incensed. This is their big chance to get their father to loosen up and stop holding up Aki as the ultimate example of biddable son. He had given up the adulation of his team , his family and his community for his fathers love. Something his father and his mother both forgot. You feel every moment of his desperation and then his joy. Akshay is emotionally invested in this film. Not to mention he produced it as well. Blood, sweat, and tears present and accounted for sir....Do not miss this one it's better than all the others put together.

  There are dreams aplenty in the Patiala House . Enjoy the end videos they are great.",1331769600,3,3968,4.4387895460797795
