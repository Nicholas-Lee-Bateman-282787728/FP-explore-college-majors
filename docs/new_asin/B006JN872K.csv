4994762,1,B006JN872K,One of the worst movies I have ever purchased. I should have known with this title what it was like. All it was is auditions for another movie put on dvd. I would call this soft core porn. No plot to this movie. Just actors off the street auditioning for a movie.,1363046400,,263,4.076923076923077
4994763,3,B006JN872K,"I saw this movie way back in the early 80's, and being a fan of Linnea Quigley, this is the earliest and most you will ever see of her, you can tell she is quite young because there is signs of teen acne on her face, overall the movie is quite amateur-est and poorly done, so if you are a Linnea Quigley fan check it out, if not you might want to skip this one.",1350864000,8,361,3.8266666666666667

4994776,4,B006JN872K,"OK, it wasn't the best thing that I've ever seen before. It basically has no plot (what passes for a plot is, as the name implies, an open casting call for a blue movie). The production values are more or less value-less. The only point of this thing is nudity and occasional weirdness, and it delivers on both--particularly the former. How refreshing to see all-natural women in all of their naked, bushy 1978 glory.

Linnea Quigley, in one of her earliest roles, is absolutely adorable here. Looks far more rounded out and full-bottomed than she was later, possibly because she wasn't living so hard yet. And yeah, she does full frontal just like all of the rest of the women (and there are a lot of them), plus she does this incredibly silly, spastic dance that would be fun to watch even if she wasn't fully naked.

It's worth viewing if you're interested in grindhouse fare. This also is really, really close to hard-core and includes more male nudity than any movie I've ever seen that WASN'T hard-core--so be aware.",1434240000,,1022,4.6722222222222225

It's even an awful example of an awful film.  Some of it is Hoot-and-holler bad, but mostly it's HoHum bad.  Waste of time, space and history.

Maybe if you had some friends in it, you'd want a copy for posterity and a souvineer, but that's about it.

4994781,3,B006JN872K,"Like others, undoubtedly, I was made aware of this strange little conglomeration of 'auditions' via the rap that Full Moon producer Charles Band has included on all of the recently released ""Grindhouse Collection"" DVDs.  Band 'purports' that the 'tape' was compiled from the out-takes of a series of casting call 'auditions' held for an 'adult' feature he was contemplating, back in the day.  With the exception of the 'discrepancy' surrounding the stated age of an ingenue Linnea Quigley  (pulling a Tracy Lords underage stunt) and a couple of appearances by individuals who appear to be just TOO weird to be real...  I pretty much took Band at his word that this IS/WAS an actual 'audition' experience... or at least SOME of it was.

Regardless - watching the parade of male and female Hollywood 'hopefuls' strip down and perform (often embarrassingly) intimate acts for 'the camera' is definitely amusing and amazing - what people won't do for a shot at fame (or a few bucks)!  The highlight(s) of the whole affair are the lovely young actress wannabes who disrobe (completely!) at the urging of the unseen 'directors' orders and demonstrate their willingness to do just about 'anything' to get a part.

As others have stated - the visual quality of this (full-screen) DVD is not great - looking pretty much like it was unceremoniously duped off an old VHS tape.  I've (unfortunately) noted this tendency to poor transfer quality on many of the Full Moon ""Grindhouse"" product - some are good and some suck.  Overall - I found ""Auditions"" to be a fun watch - regardless of its' 'authenticity'... and would recommend it for some light-weight entertainment.",1389571200,3,1657,4.97463768115942
4994782,3,B006JN872K,"Auditions is basically mock auditions for a possible sequel to Charles Band's Cinderella. Much of the cast would be featured in Fairy Tales, also from Charles Band. This movie is basically a soft core skin flick as almost every cast member appears nude. Auditions is notable for an early film appearance from 80's scream queen Linnea Quigley, who would have been around 19 or 20 when this was filmed.

Now for the quality of the DVD itself, it leaves much to be desired. The picture quality is somewhat poor for a DVD release, heck a VHS looks a lot better than this DVD. Did they use a third or fourth generation VHS dub for a master. Sound quality isn't that spectacular either. If you must have this DVD make sure you get it cheap. If you spend very much money on this you'll be disappointed.",1374537600,17,795,4.482758620689655
4994783,3,B006JN872K,"I bought this one a few weeks ago because...drum roll, please and thank you...of it being Linnea Quigley's second movie appearance (just after Psycho From Texas).

Linnea is 20yrs old in this one and going by the name of Sally Webster, regardless of the film's insistence that she's 15. Linnea was born in 1958 and this film was completed in 1978. The entire movie is a bogus interview/casting couch pastiche about as phony as all of the found-footage genre currently in vogue, even though Charles Band went out of his way to tout it as factual in a new opening found in the special features section. This movie has lots of nudity and sex, solicitation and an attempted rape, all staged and silly; virtually all of the actors appear a few months later in Linnea's 3rd film Fairy Tales, in which these ""auditions"" were directed for. If any of this were ""real"" the feds would hardly have allowed either its possession, reproduction, distribution or sale as the various ""crimes"" would have certainly landed the production crew in the clink.

I've added Auditions to my found-footage collection, even though it isn't a horror movie.

Linnea was a dream girl for me when I went through puberty and even though her Scream Queen status is not apparent here her girl-next-door allure is more than on display.

Thank you, Mr. Band for releasing this odd flick.

Now, I wonder who has the rights to Summer Camp, Linnea's 5th movie (following Deathsport and preceeding Don't Go Near the Park)?",1367020800,32,1482,4.796078431372549

8499723,1,B006JN872K,"This is a terable movie. Bad quality recordings of bad actors on 2 different sets. One set is supposed to be a French bedroom and the other a dungeon for BDSM.

8499725,4,B006JN872K,An interesting look at the audition proses of that time. The film is not the actual auditions  but acted out based on some of the craziness that has gone on during casting calls. If you did not know any better you would think it was real thats how well it was made.
