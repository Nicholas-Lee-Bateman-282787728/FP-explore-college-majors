632549,5,6303379117,"Fans of period drama will be forever indebted to Dame Eileen Atkins and Jean Marsh, for not only did they create the sensational ""Upstairs Downstairs"", but also the divine HOUSE OF ELIOTT.

Set at the dawn of the Roaring Twenties, THE HOUSE OF ELIOTT follows the stories of two sisters.  Left virtually penniless after the death of their tyrannical, uncaring father, Beatrice (Stella Gonet) and Evangeline Eliott (Louise Lombard), uneducated and unemployed, must make their own way in the world.  Beatrice finds an unlikely ally when she becomes the assistant to society photographer Jack Maddox (Aden Gillett), an unkempt, roguish playboy; whilst beautiful Evie - restricted in her attempts to contribute to the waning Eliot income by her stuffy cousin and guardian Arthur Eliott (Peter Birch) - considers becoming a paid dancer at a local academy.  Both girls have always enjoyed the pastime of making their own clothes, but the solution to their bleak financial situation doesn't present itself until the girls gain employment in two of London's high-fashion houses - and witness first-hand the sweatshop conditions of the underpaid workers, not to mention ruthless lead couturiers who have no qualms about taking the sole credit for Evie's dazzlingly modern designs.

Could they parlay their considerable dressmaking and design skills into opening London's most revolutionary new fashion boutique?  The 1920's are offering women untold new possibilities in the world of high fashion - bobbed hair, short skirts, scintillating bias-cut, bare-backed gowns--and the Eliott girls' keen sense of style fits right in!  Beginning with a small financial investment provided by Jack and his sister Penelope (Francesca Folan), Bea and Evie's dream looks set to become a reality...

The characters are all wonderfully-drawn - Stella Gonet and Louise Lombard are both quite unique actresses, and yet do manage to convince the audience of a true sisterly bond.  Elder sister Bea is almost Evie's surrogate mother in many respects, and is fiercely intent on protecting her from the attentions of unscrupulous men in a new social climate where Evie is considered a prime catch.  Supporting the Elliot sisters in their brave new enterprise are two steadfast young women - expert seamstress Tilly (Cathy Murphy) who is with the girls right from the start; and staunch workroom supervisor Madge (Judy Flynn).

From the very beginning, we can tell that Jack Maddox will be the established love interest for Bea, but I appreciate how the writers manage to create a welcome diversion by having Jack's best friend ""Piggy"" Garstone (Robert Daws) make a few adorable plays for her affection.  In terms of love interests in this first series, Evie has a few admirers, including Arthur (his proposal is appalling and heartbreaking in equal measures), Sebastian Pearce (Jeremy Brudenell), a young man who first appears on the Eliotts' doorstep claiming to be their long-lost half-brother; and, for a short period, even Jack.

The stories and subplots in this debut series of THE HOUSE OF ELIOTT careen along at break-neck speed.  As a result, several characters with lots of unexplored dramatic value are sadly disposed of far too quickly (""Piggy"", Daphne Haycock, Peter Lo-Ching, Arthur and Sebastian among them).  That is really my only criticism of a show that's almost insanely entertaining, even on repeated viewings.

Highly recommended.",1342310400,,3420,5.293900184842884
632550,5,6303379117,This is wonderful story of two sisters who establish a fashion house in London during the 1920/30s. I like to sew clothes and it was a delight to witness all the wonderful  clothes from that era. It also showed the difficulties women have trying to establish a business during that time. I appreciate all the rights women now have!,1280016000,,331,4.610169491525424
632551,5,6303379117,"Yes, watching The House of Eliott is quite a bit like watching paint dry... Farrow and Ball paint in Porphyry Pink, whilst sitting in a comfortable armchair with a nice cup of tea and a biscuit. Meaning this is lovely for those of us who prefer the slow drip of Englishy Atmosphere to a big shot of American Action. Unfortunately all of the BBC productions nowadays, even the new adaptations of Dickens and Austen, are filmed and cut in the requisite ""Law and Order"" style which in my opinion has become exceedingly tiresome indeed.  This was one of the last  BBC soundstage productions that has that  old ""I, Claudius"" or ""Pennies From Heaven"" look, which I have a strange nostalgia for. The pace, as I've said, is super-slow but somehow one sinks into it and is charmed  (even my husband begrudgingly admitted ""This show is alright""). Simply, it's the story of  two pretty sisters who start up a fashion house in 1920's London. The actresses are adorable and the clothes are all kinds of awesome.  Oh, and I have big love for any show that name-checks the great French abstract artist and designer Sonia Delaunay.",1208476800,,1115,4.6923076923076925

632553,5,6303379117,"The house of Eliott is an excellent British series about two sisters suddenly left penniless in postwar England. To make ends meet they take in sewing, and eventually open a dress shop. The two sisters are very good friends with the older sister (Bea) being the more practical sister and the younger sister (Evie) more impulsive and kind hearted.

I liked the series a great deal. The costumes, historic detail and characters are wonderful. At times I found myself annoyed by Evie (who I thought was occasionally inconsiderate and selfish), but that's what makes great characters. They are memorable and flawed. I also didn't care for the suffragette character who was a bit harsh in her judgement of her fellow man. Sometimes listening to her scolding other characters for their selfish ways ruined the mood (at least for me). While I concede poverty and inequity are serious issues, having her bray about it bored me.

5 stars. Excellent.",1158019200,7,940,4.943037974683544
632554,5,6303379117,"This fabulous series, a hit around the world, was not filmed in London, but in my ex home city of Bristol, in the Clifton district and in the country houses of Wiltshire, such as Stourhead, and surrounding countryside to be exact. Many locations I know well and recognise. Clifton is a mini Bath, with similar fashionable features, buildings and parks, and my distant ancestor, the Spanish Empress Eugenie also lived there in the 19th century. However, it provided  the BBC with an ideal place to film this series and it created a gripping rags to riches tale of two sisters making it in the 1920s fashion trade, and the stunning costumes were second to none. An added dash of romance, a horrible villan who got his just deserts, a gorgeous damsel, the perfect English rose at his mercy, plus lots of other characters providing fun and entertainment and plenty of meaty story lines, not to mention glamour by the bucket load, and you have a dvd set to treasure. Having the series on dvd now, means it is preserverd for future generations and the picture will never fade. Once again, this is the BBC at its very best, justly proving its reputation for great drama at home and abroad. The dvd set is a worthwhile addition to any home collection and I will certainly be adding each set as they come.",1150588800,14,1296,4.6103896103896105
632555,5,6303379117,"Although this series is from the early '90s, I only recently discovered it. A timeless story about coming of age - for both of the main characters, as well as the transitional time period of the 1920's for women. The story caught me immediately as I could relate to the characters struggle. While the two sisters have grown up comfortable and sheltered, their father's sudden death leaves them with an uncertain future. Their realistic fate greets them with constant challenges to be overcome. The older sister Beatrice has a great deal of emotional baggage from having to raise her sister and missing her chance at marriage. According to her time period she might be considered an old maid, so she is understandably a little bitter and uncompromising. However, she is a likeable character with much creativity and sensibility. Evangeline, the younger sister, seems intelligent but often immature. Portrayed as most young adults as being opinionated without experience, but her innocence makes her charming and creative. She is free from the baggage that her sister carries, however life will not leave her unaffected. Obviously it is on this age difference and maturity that the sisters often clash despite their close relationship. The series also delves into the 1920s lifestyle describing women on the verge of independence. Some are clinging to the outdated traditions, while others are embracing the change. Needless to say that the sets and fashions in the series are excellent.

The DVD visual quality seems adequate, although I agree with another review that the sound quality is poor. Music seems loud, while taking too low. I've had the volume at max as well. And a shame there are no captions or subtitles to make up for this audio lack. I also wish there were some extras to go with the series.

Overall, I would highly recommend the series. I watched it with my mother, so its a great show to share with someone else.",1149811200,15,1931,4.938461538461539

  The cast are all competant actors, the script and story well set up, not to mention the gorgeous dresses! This is a quality BBC production.

  I agree with another reviewer that the sound can be a bit variable at times. A minor annoyance. In every other way, technically sound.",1138579200,8,531,4.655913978494624
632617,4,6303379117,"For some bewildering reason, the transfer for this wonderful series has very poor sound. One has to raise the volume to the max, to even begin to hear it. Much of the dialogue is swallowed.

A pity. And no, I am not going deaf:  when you put another DVD title in, at the same sound level, the track is deafeningly LOUD.

Otherwise, a terrific romp through the '20s.",1123632000,31,365,4.338235294117647

632621,5,6303379117,My ultimate favorite series finally on disk.  I have been waiting for this set since DVD's have been released.  It's about two fiesty sisters in the 1920's who have become impoverished by their father's death.  It is mostly about the trials they have establishing their own fashion house called the House of Eliot.,1114992000,,314,4.886792452830188
632622,4,6303379117,"Before I had seen this show the only experience I had of 1920s drama was ""The Great Gatsby"" (novel and film). ""The House of Eliott"" is a lot different to the former story, being set in London, not New York, and the protagonists are two beautiful sisters - Beatrice and Evangeline Eliott.
""The House of Eliott"" concerns the two sisters' struggle to make a name for themselves in the face of poverty, officious, patronising relatives and social values that inevitably work in favour of men. Using their talents for dressmaking, and dealing with life and relationships at the same time, the Eliotts eventually set up a fashion house. There are clues dropped in the first episode, as we see the sisters sketching out designs in a cafe, which indicate where their future lies.
""The House of Eliott"" is an entertaining drama that isn't purely about fashion. Issues like class, etiquette and the perils of fragile romance are also covered. It can also, on a superficial level, teach you how to deal with clients and run a business. Even though I know next to nothing about fashion (there was a time when I thought ""chic"" was pronounced ""chick""), it's worth watching to see how the sisters will overcome the next obstacle Fate puts in their way. My mother's cousin is also an award-winning fashion designer, so there's a link there too.
""The House of Eliott"" is currently being shown on television on Sunday evenings at 6.30. We are now up to the third series. I keep thinking of the comedy sketch done by Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders, ""The House of Idiot"". That was a parody with French (as an overweight Evangeline) and Saunders (as a clueless Bea) combining bits and pieces from numerous episodes, as well as adding some obvious anachronisms. The central story involved a crisis over some missing buttons, while Jack Maddox was repeatedly fobbed off by Bea. French and Saunders got a shock when the real Eliott sisters (and Tilly) made a surprise appearance.
I'm not sure how realistic ""The House of Eliott"" is, as I'm too young to remember the 1920s, but the show still makes compulsive viewing. Acting, costumes and plot are all high quality.",1063411200,5,2144,4.797297297297297

632624,4,6303379117,"... why doesn't anyone seem to recognize the truth about the series?  It's a soap opera!  Just because it's from the BBC and has period costumes and a slightly simplistic feminist philosophy doesn't change the fact.  It's glamorous and melodramatic with lots of gossip, romance, and domestic strife.  Not to mention that the story progresses in weekly installments (no self-contained episodes), more than a few of which end in cliffhangers.  Lots of fun but I only gave it four stars since it's a bit slow-moving and confusing at times.",1030060800,3,536,4.977528089887641

7844709,2,6303379117,"I read MOST of  the Amazon reviews here and bought  the 1st (HOE) Series based on those reviews. I found this old series trite, overwhelmingly boring, dull, and dated. I wanted so hard to LOVE IT!!, based on the other reviews. The storyline is interesting, the female characters are not.  All of the Amazon Reviewers, who state that there are tons of 1920's clothing designs, and costumes are semi- incorrect. What there is in this series are two spinster, women (sisters): one who is ultra controlling and ultra bitter, and the other sister, (younger), is a mouse! She whines and whines endlessly,  about becoming an adult, but never really gets the job done. The younger sister, drones on and on about everything, while the older one controls her down to what the younger sister, wears, eats who she speaks to.. it's quite paranoic, really. (Yes! I realize this was de rigeur for the time period). The younger sister, constantly complains, and then fights back in little, twisted ways, all through the series. The storyline gets super tiring, very fast! I will not purchase any further into the series, it's too slow, too dated and too painful, listening to anymore of the Mouse Sister's whining. Normally, I love British Drama, and LOVE, LOVE DUCHESS of DUKE STREET! Talk about the costumes! And all of the ""Miss Marple"", and ""H. Poirot""! The entire Sherlock Holmes, from Basil Rathbone to Jeremy Brett to Benedict Cumberbatch, LOVE THEM ALL!  ""Miss Fisher Presents"", talk about endless 1920's costumes, and fabulous. Phyrnie, has got it all going on! That series is fabulous. Also, love ""Flame Trees of Thika""!!  And, LOVE, LOVE ""The Yellow Wallpaper"", Anne of Green Gables"", is an endless favourite..but  House of Eliot, misses the mark, at least this version does, by a mile...I do not hate or love HOE. It's just really old, boring, and dated all the way around. Sadly, I do not think that further expenditures spent on ""HOE"", will be worthwhile. I do not believe that this old series, unlike fine wine, will improve as these women move into their lives, as full adults living in the 1920's and 1930's......",1499990400,,2114,4.855555555555555

7844717,4,6303379117,"When it first aired in the early 1990s, The House of Eliott was considered an instant classic, winning over fans and critics on both sides of the Atlantic. Created by Dame Eileen Atkins and Jean Marsh, the revolutionary women behind Upstairs, Downstairs, the cultural phenomenon of the `70s, The House of Eliott tells the story of sisters Beatrice (""Bea"") and Evangeline (""Evie"") Eliott as they rise through the world of fashion in the Roaring Twenties to establish their own haute couture design house.

Bea is feeling emotionally lost at thirty years old, having given up her chance at marriage in order to raise her younger sister, Evie, who is now a nave and idealizing eighteen. Bea and Evie find their privileged lives uprooted upon the sudden death of their tyrannical and controlling father; but their hope of finally being able to live freely and independently is thwarted when they discover he left only a towering debt and a suitcase filled with secrets. With their only remaining funds - as well as Evie's guardianship - tied up in the hands of their enterprising cousin Arthur, the girls are left to make their way in the world without formal education or skills. As their passion for fashion design begins to set the course for their future, Bea and Evie face all of the complex challenges for women in the 1920s, finding love and loss, success and failure along the way.

There are several different aspects of The House of Eliott that are likely to resonate with viewers, but most especially is the show's depiction of the struggles women faced in the era. It's truly well-rounded in terms of portraying the female condition - quite admirably and thoroughly so, and with Jean Marsh and Eileen Atkins at the helm that's really no surprise. In many ways The House of Eliott is a celebration of the progressive energy of the 1920s and the world of opportunities that were blossoming for women to find independence. We see this world through a variety of eyes thanks to the story and casting, which makes the aspect of women's liberation feel even bigger. Even the women who didn't have such a progressive view of the women's suffrage movement are depicted here.

Being thirty and considered a ""spinster"", Bea presents viewers with a depiction of a grown woman's attempt at harnessing the new and evolving breed of independence for her life, a life which much of society would consider failed. Slightly embittered by her circumstances, Bea finds herself opened to the world in a whole new way. Meanwhile, young Evie shows us what it was like to come of age in the 1920s and gives the story a delightful touch of adolescent drama. Stubborn and opinionated despite her limited life experience, Evie gets herself into (and out of) all manner of trouble with the grace, creativity and intelligence that she and her sister both share. Together they illustrate the brilliant promise of women in their era - whatever their age - but their differences also drive a wedge between them on occasion. Their emotional and complex relationship is just another fascinating addition to the show.

The cast is lovely, featuring Aden Gillett, Cathy Murphy, Peter Birch, Barbara Jefford, and Francesca Folan in supporting roles while Stella Gonet plays Bea and Louise Lombard is Evie. The leads are immensely likable and their chemistry is wonderful. Filmed mostly in Bristol, the settings feel authentic and richly detailed while Joan Wadge's sumptuous, BAFTA- and Emmy-winning costume design completes the fabulous visual appeal of flapper-era England. On the whole, the first season of the show sets the stage for a unique and engaging drama to unfold against the very fascinating social climate of the Roaring Twenties.
