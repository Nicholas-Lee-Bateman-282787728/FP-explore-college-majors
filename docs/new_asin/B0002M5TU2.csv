8029116,2,B0002M5TU2,"One star for the price and one star for the trashy film making,zero stars for everthing else,thats how I'm going to have to rate this package. If they could have cleaned these up a bit I would have given a five star rating. I liked the movies just not the visuals as the picture looked so bad in some scenes I couldn't see a thing. They were almost completly black. I don't mine a little bit of a grainy look. The Beat up film sometimes adds to the charm but this is just unwatchable in some parts. What a shame cuz they were pretty funny. I 'm glad I only paid 5 bucks other wise I would have returned it.",1220832000,,606,4.058333333333334
