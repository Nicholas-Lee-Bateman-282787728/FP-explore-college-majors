2472891,5,B000CSRSGY,"Craig's in a tough spot, going up against Conan, who's been dominant for years.  Conan and his writers make for a very entertaing show, and it's just tough to draw fans away from it.  But I think Craig is actually quite funny himself!  The few times I have actually watched his show, I have been well entertained!  He has a unique perspective and brand of comedy, and it works!  Besides, it's not like he can be Mr. Wick anywhere outside ""The Drew Carey Show!""  Once Conan takes over ""The Tonight Show,"" I will gladly flip over to Craig at 12:35.

THAT SAID,

Any fan of ""The Drew Carey Show"" must buy this DVD!  (Even two or three copies, and give them to friends!)  Warner Bros. put out this DVD as a tester, to see how well it sells.  If it does well, they will most likely put the full seasons on DVD.  However, as there is no guarantee, you should buy this anyway in case it's the only Drew Carey DVD ever released!

The DVD contains some of the best episodes, though not all (of course!).  Every episode on it is great and very entertaining.  The only reasons you might be disappointed are (1) it's missing one or two of your other personal favorites, or (2) you get upset when a DVD does not contain extras.

For 10 bucks, it's well worth the price!",1147132800,4,1256,4.303418803418803
2472892,5,B000CSRSGY,"Every time I watch these old episodes, I'm reminded that Craig Ferguson needs to go back to his roots.  He was hilarious as Mr. Wick, but he's like, the worst talk show host ever (especially up against Conan O'Brien, who is awesome).  Sorry, but if you ask me, it's just not what he's good at.  But, he was great on this show, as was everyone else.",1146787200,2,348,4.242424242424242
2472893,5,B000CSRSGY,"Everyone buy this DVD so they'll start releasing Drew Carey in seasons, for 9 buxs, its worth it! It has 6 eposodes from different seasons, if you want the dvd in seasons u must buy this first to get WB to start doing it!",1142121600,10,221,4.045454545454546
2472894,5,B000CSRSGY,love this old tv show. I would love to get my hands on more. im searching everywhere to try and complete my set.,1364428800,,112,3.9130434782608696
2472895,5,B000CSRSGY,"I really enjoyed every second of this DVD :)
However, it made me a little mad that they haven't released a new season of the Drew Carey Show after all of this time! I watched all of the episodes online last year, i would have bought the entire series to watch it....but because it isn't released yet, i couldn't.

Please release more seasons of this show...I'm glad season one is out, but it's my least favorite out of all the seasons :/ The show keeps getting better as it progresses!",1360886400,,485,4.388888888888889
2472896,5,B000CSRSGY,You really need to keep going with the seasons...don't abandon us here!  Make more!  Never get tired of this show.,1354752000,5,114,4.65
2472897,4,B000CSRSGY,"The first season or two of the Drew Carey show her my absolute favorite series at the time. The show is very entertaining and I especially love Drew fighting with Mimi all the time. The other characters were also great matters really sorry to see Lisa go in the first season; I always thought she was hot.

What you get with this disc is a handful of episodes which seem to be mainly picked out because they had some sort of uniqueness. For example you have the first episode, you also have the wonderful music video that they did, one that had an animated Daffy duck, and the one where they go to drug Co. to rescue Drew's dog. It's a nice little sampler plate for the whole series.

If you can't get the individual seasons separately, this is about the best you can do.",1347753600,,771,4.310344827586207
2472898,5,B000CSRSGY,"I've only watched this show occasionaly and for those like me who want a few of their funniest episodes.....this one is for you! I must admit I bought this set just for ""Drew Blows his Promotion..."" because it's just hilarious! Although you can't get this DVD through Amazon, you can get it through a seller on the site--I got it for $4.47 w/ shipping and it is well worth the price!",1326412800,,383,4.408450704225352
2472899,5,B000CSRSGY,Drew Carey and the rest of the cast in this series of sit coms were absolutely hilarious in every episode I saw. Drew's big promotion was the funniest though. I'll add a few more episodes to my library later. They are great to watch after a long day. After all no one has it as tough as Drew.,1308700800,,292,4.051724137931035
2472900,5,B000CSRSGY,"I just found A show that I loved to watch and was able to find a compilation dvd of it. It is the DREW CAREY SHOW.I found it at the greatest website on the planet. If you want it,Chances are very possible that you are going to be able to find it on AMAZON.com I have bought tools,A ice-cream maker,A food processer,music that I had trouble finding,and can find anything my heart desires here. I also want to give a 5 star rating to all the dealers they work with selling all this wonderful items. My latest buy is from DnDBargains,and I was blown away by the fact,They sent me a e-mail the very same day,and were already getting my order ready to ship. I will definately do bissness with them again. Short,and to the point,If you are looking for something,or want it,Dont go anywhere till you check with amazon.com. Sincerly a incredibly happy customer.",1277164800,,853,4.509677419354839
2472901,4,B000CSRSGY,"Great complilation, and the only place you can find some episodes because only the first season was released on DVD.  Listed as ""unavailable"", buy this before you can't locate a copy, and maybe Warner's will release the rest.",1275955200,,225,4.921052631578948
2472902,5,B000CSRSGY,"Awesome collection of episodes throughout the series. I love this show and since they only released season 1, it was nice to see a few other episodes since they no longer air them as reruns in my area.",1270684800,,201,4.315789473684211

2472904,5,B000CSRSGY,"Last Monday, September 15, 2008, The Home Theater Forum had Warner Brothers home video (T.V. and Animation Divisions only) on their chat line.  Questions about a release for the 2nd season of Drew Carey Show were asked and Warner Brothers flatly said ""no plans"".  I think this is a disgrace!!!  Drew Carey is one of the best Comedy shows of the 90's!!  We need to write to Warner Brothers and bombard them with emails and letters to get this show on DVD!!!  Fans of the series Knots Landing did just that, and now Knots Landing (according to last mondays chat) Warner Brothers is giving that show another chance on DVD! We need to do the same for this show if you want more seasons of this show released on DVD!!!  GET YOUR VOICES HEARD!!!  The good news is Warner Brothers is planning to release another DVD set of Drew's other show: Whose Line Is It Anyway? Season 2.  Personally, I would prefer The 2nd season of THE DREW CAREY SHOW......but at least Drew's other show is getting recognized!!!",1221868800,,996,4.556179775280899
2472905,5,B000CSRSGY,"This is a fun inexpensive way to have some of the funniest Drew Carey Show episodes.  The best show is the one when Drew decides to remake all the office's old safety videos, and Kate redoes them for a birthday present for him.  One of the funniest shows ever! :)",1205193600,,263,4.24
2472906,5,B000CSRSGY,"This show put Drew Carey and Cleveland on the map.  I can't wait to get the complete first season when it comes out!  These episodes are pretty good ones, but definetly not the best.  Just wait for the actual season's to start coming out on DVD, then you'll see what I mean.  But this is ultimately a great purchase for any fan of the show, or Drew Carey for that matter.  Get it if you just can't wait for the season's to come out on DVD, or if you just need a quick fix!!!!  Cleveland Rocks!!!!",1176163200,,496,4.114583333333333
2472907,5,B000CSRSGY,I was a fan and have been trying to get the full series for a long time now so this is a foretaste of whats to come if Warner Bros put the full series out. You either like Drew Carey and his gang or not and the show always makes me laugh. Great buy and Cleveland really does rock.,1168819200,,280,3.76271186440678
2472908,2,B000CSRSGY,"Well, thier are a lot better episodes out there. Like any involving Michael Gross from Family Ties and his alcholic wife. The only two that shone at all were the 4 and 5 episodes with Adrienne Barbou, not due to her, she just happened to be in them.

  There are 6 episodes, and the first three are kind of stinkers,4 and 5 are good, and episode 6 is a special effects goofy deal.

  The DVD reflects poorly on a hilarious series.

  Im kind to give it a 2, and it pains me, because the show was one of the greatest ever.",1168473600,2,521,4.079207920792079
2472909,5,B000CSRSGY,"Drew Carey is a comic genius and his cast of funny characters and equally hilarious stories makes me laugh until it HURTS!  This treasure chest of comic fun has 6 episodes including the Pilot episode.  If you didn't know how much humor could be found in Cleveland Ohio, you do now!

Since there are a paucity of shows on this dvd, let's just say the market has been tested and we want the full series!  The Drag Queen episode makes me laugh until I'm wiping tears from my eyes and that episode about Drew's promotion had me laughing so hard that I thought I'd crack a rib.  This is what comedy fans have been praying for.  Please, please, PLEASE release the full season so we can enjoy even more laughs.  Drew Carey is here to stay!",1165017600,6,732,4.338235294117647
2472910,5,B000CSRSGY,"I recently bought the ""Best OF"" dvd and was freshly blown away by the genius of Drew's comedy. The episode showing Drew ""blowing"" his promotion had us literally falling on the floor with laughter (again) - it may not be sophisticated but it is great physical comedy. We will be anxiously waiting for the full season DVD's.  PLEASE!

A separate DVD with all the great musical dance scenes would also be great.",1159660800,4,408,4.652777777777778
2472911,5,B000CSRSGY,"Watched the whole thing from beginning to end the first chance I got and I laughed my head off.

Hopefully they will release the whole show with all seasons some time soon. I gotta have more!

2472912,5,B000CSRSGY,"Excellent selection of episodes from all the series of Drew Carey, but, it does have one drawback, it makes me angry that the powers to be haven't had the sense to release every episode of every series made onto DVD yet.
