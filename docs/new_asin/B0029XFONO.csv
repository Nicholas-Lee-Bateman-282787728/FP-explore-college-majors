8358470,5,B0029XFONO,"I recently began using this DVD, and I find it to be extremely useful.  The DVD's progression, which goes through  loosening the joints, awakening the body's natural energy Qi (also called Ki in Japan, ), and ultimately on to lower back strengthening while using Qi is well thought out and effective.  As a practitioner of Aikido for over 40 years, I can appreciate when a therapeutic program knows how to integrate the Qi of the body with physical movement.  this DVD is definitely not ""simple yoga"" as one reviewer claimed.  It is actual Qi Gong, and it is powerful when you do it correctly.

The best thing about this DVD is the way that Qi is integrated into every single move.  It's really important to understand how Qi circulates through the body and especially about the Qi center, which resides a  bit below the navel.  If you've never worked with  this kind of energy before, this DVD may not make as much sense to you...but if you follow along to the point where you are holding the 'sphere' you will start to understand.

This DVD is marketed for lower back issues, but since it's dealing with the core of the body, its a good general practice for anyone.",1517356800,,1167,4.5625
8358471,4,B0029XFONO,"I've used this Qi Gong method for two years after having a significant episode of not being able to stand for more than five minutes without significant back pain.  I've had a history of back pain since 1979, using various regular techniques to keep from having them again.  I always seem to heal and am not affected until--WHAM--I am hit hard with no warning.  I was given this DVD by a body healer and felt like what I'd been using had not been working.  So I started this regime almost every day.  I also started using an inversion table and one other very short exercise two years ago, so this DVD may not be the sole reason for my remission; otherwise I'd give it five stars.  I still use this Qi Gong method.",1299628800,3,714,4.330827067669173
8358472,1,B0029XFONO,This is not Qi Gong at all; it is some very simple yoga.  Not worth the money I paid for the DVD.,1268870400,3,97,3.409090909090909
