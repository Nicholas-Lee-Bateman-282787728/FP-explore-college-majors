8668549,2,B00LWG6Z1O,"The Abbess of Castro-Stendhal--Like many old stories, 'The Abbess of Castro"" by Stendhal, is retold from 2 older manuscripts.  This ""Romeo & Juliet"" story tells us that fueds, even local wars, were much more common than we moderns suppose.  Lovers were often kept apart.  The tale has its similarities and differences from 'Romeo & Juliet' , which I was surprized to learn several years ago, was taken from several older manuscripts, redone with a more dramatic flare.
  I will not give away the entire story, but only say, for whatever reason, modern writers do not have the command of language 19th century ones did, and it is a lovely, tragic tale which SHOULD be more widely known, and is aparently based in fact.",1456099200,,717,4.796747967479675
