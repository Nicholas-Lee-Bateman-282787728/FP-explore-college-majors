2627516,5,B000H5V8CM,"You wouldn't think it, but if you watch more than two episodes of this show you will get hooked.  It's a little cheesy, and the plots are, of course, very predictable, but still there's something about that draws you in and hooks you.  Miley Cyrus plays Miley Stewart an average 14-year old girl with a huge secret.  She's international pop sensation Hannah Montana.  With the aid of her friends Lily and Oliver and her family (With dad played by actual father, singer Billy Ray Cyrus,) she lives two lives trying to keep her secret from the world.  This show is witty, cute, and has a lot of heart.  The father-daughter tender moment scenes are endearing and feal more real than most (gee I wonder why?) I give this show five-stars.",1156809600,15,733,4.6
2627517,5,B000H5V8CM,"I saw this on pay tv a while back and completely accidentally got hooked.  It is for tweens and younger, but for some strange reason, I couldn't turn the station over.

Miley moves to Malibu and is secretly a singer called Hannah Montana.  Her friend Lilly sneaks into Hannahs dressing room so Miley is busted but other than that, no school kids know her secret life.  Her father/manager is played by Mr Achy Breaky Heart himself, Billy Ray Cyrus (this is what he's been reduced to).

There are 28 episodes on this disc and sure it's often corny and cheesy, but there is something cute and good about it that will have wide appeal to a lot of tweens and pre-teens.  It would make a good birthday or holiday gift to a little one.  I can see how this would keep them occupied for a couple of hours or so.",1155513600,7,802,4.306666666666667

2627553,4,B000H5V8CM,"My, how the world has changed! It's not been many years ago since we've lived in a world where ""Hannah Montana"" was quite prominent! It was a huge phenomenon and overexposed to an overwhelmingly degree. Alongside with ""High School Musical"", ""Hannah Montana"" was a juggernaut that was a part of highly successful Disney Channel franchises, tarnishing Disney's name and turning Miley Cyrus into a huge superstar. While several purists argues of which Disney Channel era is the best one, there's no doubt that ""Hannah Montana"" achieved a popularity that no Disney Channel franchise could match. This is truly a different world we live in!

There's no denial that ""Hannah Montana"" is a manufactured product specifically aimed to a certain audience. It's quite obvious in how it's structured, labeled and marketed. Why exactly ""Hannah"" achieved such a huge popularity is debatable. Of course being a right product at the right time, alongside with it's cynical marketable intentions. But another reason could actually be it's premise, being a popstar equivalent of Clark Kent and ""Superman"". That's really the catalyst for the show, though it does play too loose and lightly with the premise, which makes it unrealistic.

So considering how cynically shaped ""Hannah"" is, how exactly the most significant component, the show itself? Well, it's crass, goofy and corny, but actually has it's perks. Though it's rarely really laugh-loud funny, the show could be quite fun and enjoyable at it's best. Mostly because of the characters, actually! While Miley Cyrus may be boisterious and jarring, she had a certain charm and likability to her at her best. Though better was Emily Osment (yes, Haley Joel Osment's younger sister) as Lilly, being more subdued, but polished. Billy Ray Cyrus as Miley's real dad is actually a genuniely likable and charismatic dad. While Jason Earles' Jackson can be grating at times, he's likeable and endearing. Best is Mitchel Musso's Oliver Oken, the goofy, quirky, but enjoyable friend. What also made the show, really is it's trashy, fun tone and it's (mostly) enjoyable and catchy songs.

""Hannah Montana"" had several archetypical traits that was found in most teen sitcoms. It also relied heavily upon metaphors, celebrity puns, Southern stereotypes and moral lessons. The latter really was as much as a flaw, especially since at the end the messages became hypocritical. Especially when it came to Miley Stewart herself, who through the seasons developed to be a ruthless and reckless bitch. Who completely walked over her friends and family, regretting her mistakes and becoming the same bitch at the next episode. What also hampered the show is that it could be quite crass and frankly quite dumb at times. Especially grating was Moises Arias character Rico, a character that the show never needed.

Despite being modeled after ""That's So Raven"" and ""The Suite Life With Zack and Cody"", both ""Hannah Montana"" and Miley Cyrus has drawn comparisons to both Hilary Duff and ""Lizzie McGuire"". I guess those comparisons are fair, but despite having similar archetypical traits, both shows were different and had different premises. But probably because both were prominent ""it""-girls in their eras. While I've personally thought Hilary had a greater charisma and it-potential, there's no doubt that Cyrus has a certain spunk that differentiates her from her Disney Channel peers.

There's no denial that ""Hannah was a short-sell product, as such products are. The real problem with ""Montana"" was that it was overexposed to an overwhelmingly degree and milked for all it was worth (seriously, would it really kill Disney to at least wait to the show was over to make the movie, considering how the fourth season had the same conclusion). Personally I found the two first seasons to be the cutest, but there's no denial that ""Hannah"" was becoming more and more a product through the seasons. ""Hannah Montana"" really took the ""art imitating life"" premise to another level, by letting Miley's real dad, ""Achy Breaky Heart""-Billy Ray Cyrus to play a role of himself as a fallen superstar. And of course as Miley playing an already famous superstar in the show.

A fascinating thing, though, is that Miley played two parts, a fictional version of herself and an already famous popstar. The latter could really be a stigma that would be hard to break from, especially since many childstars and even actors have trouble to break from a certain character who can define you. It's quite obvious that Miley was not particularly comfortable to play Hannah during the last seasons and lacked entusiasm and spark. And while Miley hinted that she wanted to break from Hannah in a sexual way, she took it to the extreme afterwards and become as anti-Disney as possible.

So at the end, ""Hannah Montana"" has become history. The world grew tired of it after at the end. But the show itself could actually be quite cute for what it was. It's obvious that several of the current Disney shows mirrors ""Montana"". It was a guilty pleasure, but is mostly silly, trashy fun. Take it for what is! The first season was the best.

This dvd set had the short, but cute featurette ""Back Home Again with Miley"", which showed her real ranch with her dad. Cute and fluffy for the fans.",1438300800,,5276,5.021714285714285

EVERYONE needs to BOYCOTT buying those jumbled DVD sets, which are like buying a Disney movie which only includes scenes from the film (not the whole film), then another DVD with other scenes from the same movie...if we keep buying DVDs like this, they will never want/need to release the movie!!!

2627636,5,B000H5V8CM,"Even though this series is targeted at young teens, it attracted more younger kids (as young as 4 year old) because of supporting cast characters like Jackson and Oliver, doing silly things that make kids laugh and brighten their day. But even parents and grandparents who grew up loving the sitcoms in the spirit of ""I Love Lucy"" would love Hannah Montana the TV show.  Also rarely do you find a TV series where practically every episode showcases a new song, and the song goes from good to darn good, from being meaningful (lifting young kids spirit) to light-hearted romance, to cute music, and finally in later seasons lyrics focus more seriously on growing pains and inner feelings.

Disney should treasure this show/franchise for a while (and maybe reboot it in 50 years!). It's not likely anytime soon to repeat the feat of what this TV show able to attract and impact. For the rest of family, we can only wait for Disney Channel to release complete Seasons 2, 3, and 4.",1291334400,6,977,4.674418604651163

2627648,4,B000H5V8CM,"After being on for a few years, this show still manages to have a clean, positive appearance without any drastic character personality changes (despite what may be happening in the real life of the actors). Although all seasons so far have maintained this, the first one is probably the best. As a whole, it usually has a positive message, shows the consequences of doing something wrong and creates a good family image. The only negative thing about the series is the character Oliver. He is a pretty bad image for boys and never really sticks up for himself. But since the Disney Channel is more geared towards girls, it probably should be expected. And compared to Wizards of Waverly Place, which for the last two seasons seems to have an ""it's cool to be bad"" message, Hannah Montana has held it's course.

On a side observation, the Disney Channel tends to make shows that display kids in unrealistic situations, such as being a pop star, a wizard or getting to live on a cruise ship. I don't know that this is even a bad thing, but I have to wonder if it may have some negative effects in the long run.",1282694400,2,1108,4.512437810945274

2627669,5,B000H5V8CM,"I saw the promo for this show before it first premiered on the Disney channel.

As a kid, being a rock star was one of my fantasies. That was not unusual in itself I don't think. The thing in my case was that I wanted to be a ""secret"" rock star living a double life. So, I had to check out this show when it first aired.

Naturally, the show was aimed at younger kids. But I fell in love with the show during the first episode, ""Lilly Do You Want to know a Secret."" I think this is one of the best TV series to be produced in a long time. I bought the first season the day it was released on DVD and I am looking forward to season 2, 3 and 4 when they are released.

It's great to be able to watch the shows on demand or in series the way they were created. This is the perfect gift for any Hannah Montana fan!

Emily Osment, comes a long way from being Haley Joel Osment sister to Lily Truscott on the show.  Emily Osment looks like she was twelve years old in the show, what's her secret.  Emily Osment has the greatest resemblance of Heather Locklear and Zoey 101's Jamie Lynn Spears on the show.  She looks like more like a model than a actress in the show.  Miley Cyrus with or without the blonde wig she does look like Britney Spears and Hilary Duff all at once.  Miley Cyrus is like Lizzie Mcguire with a southern accent and her voice reminds me of Reba McEntire's character Reba Hart on the hit show Reba.  Even in the show the last two seasons, she sounds like Peri Gilpin's character Roz Doyle from Frasier and the third season she sounds like Reba McEntire's character Reba Hart on Reba.  That's who she sounds like, she is an excellent singer and probably a lot bigger than Britney Spears pretty soon.

2627686,4,B000H5V8CM,"Within weeks of the release of the wondrous Walt Disney Treasure DVD set, ""The Mickey Mouse Club Presents Annette,"" here we have her far more opulent descendant of teen stardom, ""Hannah Montana"" in its first full-season collection.

It's not like you can't turn on Disney Channel and see a multitude of ""Hannah"" shows at will, but they tend to be clustered without sequence, so it's a different experience to see each show one after the other without promos and other network clutter that even clogs the occasional series marathon.

Like ""The Monkees,"" when the furor fades and the songs fall from the charts, the show itself is left to stand on its own. While no one pretends this is ""30 Rock"" or ""Frasier,"" the ""Hannah"" series is a capable effort, with Miley Cyrus carrying virtually every scene with timing and confidence that develops somewhat over the episodes. What also becomes clear is the comic frenzy of Jason Earles as her brother, Jackson. Earles is actually older than he looks and his skill really comes through in the polished slapstick.

Each episode's title is a wordplay of some musical reference (""Miley Get Your Gun,"" ""Good Golly, Miss Dolly,"" etc.). The first few shows, which set up the premise, don't get as much airplay and are interesting to watch because, as in many early series episodes, the characters are not developed and the cast is getting used to the material and each other.  It would have been nice to have some audio commentary by this highly accessible cast. Instead there are episodes with a few inserted comments from Miley culled from other interviews called ""Hannah's Highlights.""

The Disney Channel Games kickoff episode and a vignette with Miley and Billy Ray Cyrus on their home turf round out the extras. The ""Games"" segment would be almost sure to be a fun thing for kids to watch a decade from now to see which stars they can remember and what a big deal it all seemed to be at the time.

It would be nice to see more of the Disney Channel shows get this kind of treatment, especially the very entertaining ""Corey in the House,"" which is now out of production.",1227571200,16,2109,4.717391304347826

I mean, Raven actually is hilarious, is a great actress, and can sing.
Miley Cyrus, on the other hand, can't act that good. She is an OK singer, she can only sing Rockish Alternative Pop music because her voice is so raspy.

Hannah Montana copies off of That's So Raven in these ways:

1. About a pop star, who keeps it a secret from everyone, but her family knows she is Hannah Montana. (Raven is psychic, only her family and friends know. It's a secret from everyone else.)

And, that's the biggest CLUE, that Hannah Montana is copying straight off of That's So Raven. Which is still Disney Channel's only show to have 100 episodes.
Plus, Hannah Montana's viewers have gone down to 2 million every new episode.
It music suck, because That's So Raven drew in over 3 million viewers every episode, and gets 1.8 million viewers on ABC Kids on Saturday Morning.

Let's just get THAT outta the way NOW.

Long story short, the Jonas brother, received a hit song in the making, from Miley's Dad, and Miley herself, got this super-genius idea to smash all that they (JBs) were going to achieve with that first single, and eventually the album. Her and her friend, decide to dress up as Dudes, and totally just mess everything up. They come out ready to rock, and start singing the song that was planned for the JBs. Nick and his brothers' jaws drop, and they consult Billy, to be sure this isn't some scary nightmare;

They get found out, and Miley and her friend look so stupid. Worth watching!

2627710,4,B000H5V8CM,"I have been on this earth for thirty-one years and I'm proud to say that I like ""Hannah Montana.""  My daughter is totally captivated by this series and by young Miley Cyrus, who heads up the cast of the show.  We already own ""Pop Star Profile"" and my daughter (and me) watch the series on the Disney Channel together.  The show is funny, light, girlishly silly at times and one of the safest shows for youngsters and pre-teens around.  Don't let the ""safest"" comment scare you.  This show is full of smart laughs for kids and in-jokes for their parents who know where Miley's dad, Billy Ray Cyrus, came from.

This particular DVD contains four episodes of the series.  They are ""Money For Nothing, Guilt For Free,"" ""Lilly, Do You Want To Know A Secret,"" ""Miley Get Your Gum,"" and ""I Can't Make You Love Hannah If You Don't.""  These particular shows revolve around Miley going to great lengths to keep (and in a couple of cases, revealing) her secret life as pop star, Hannah Montana.  Fans of ""High School Musical"" will recognize Corbin Bleu as a reluctant fan of Montana in one episode.

I have to agree with another reviewer that this show's characters have great chemistry on the tube.  Cyrus, Emily Osment (Lilly), and Mitchel Musso (Oliver) are believable as best friends.  Jason Earles is terribly terrific as Miley's goofy brother, Jackson.  The elder Cyrus does his part as well playing a father who thinks he's a lot cooler than he actually is and tries to deal with his daughter growing up.

The extras on the disc are okay.  There's a music video for ""Best Of Both Worlds,"" Miley talking about gaining the role of Hannah and following her dreams, and her audition tapes.

Overall, this entire series is perfect for youngsters to watch.  Hannah can be silly at times and she even makes some bad choices, but in the end, she suffers the consequences and deals with her problems like a fairly normal pre-teen.  She and all of the other kids in the show seem pretty grounded, don't expect everything handed to them, don't dress or act like sluts, and are all-around decent kids.  That's rare on TV these days, even in most ""family"" shows.

In a world where hotel heiresses who proclaim, ""That's hot,"" are applauded for their social status, it's nice to see that a few young ladies still know how to act like real young ladies.

Highly recommended.",1194480000,22,2354,4.63768115942029
2627711,5,B000H5V8CM,I bought this dvd for my tomboy stepdaughter and she just loves it! Hannah Montana is the best thing Disney has come up with (besides High School Musical that is!)...entertaining and uplifting. Hannah is fun!,1182902400,10,208,4.9714285714285715
2627722,4,B000H5V8CM,"Now I can review the DVD, having bought it and finally seeing the pilot. These episodes basically set up the series' format, and what I STILL like about HM is the on-screen chemistries between Miley and Lilly (Miley Cyrus and Emily Osment); you really get the feeling that these two are very good friends (something that is seriously lacking in a lot of shows). Also, Billy Ray Cyrus pokes fun at his own real-life career, which I find very funny.
Then there's the male best friend rounding out the trio (Oliver; played by Mitchel Musso), and the annoying (in this case, older) brother Jackson (expertly played by Jason Earles). And that's where, in spite of being done better, the sense of deja vu begins. It's like Disney is forever trying to find the next Hilary Duff (hence Hannah's blonde wig). This series could be a taste of what a third season post-Lizzie McGuire the Movie could be like. It's not a bad thing, but when you see and recognize elements from Lizzie McGuire and That's So Raven (including dialogue), then it's time for a rethink. I really like this show in spite of being mostly a kids' show, but I'd love to see more development than a rehash of 'Disney's Greatest Hits'. The music video and audition tapes are both neat. I've since bought both this DVD and  Pop Star Profile, and STILL recommend them in spite of this, because it is a good show in spite of minor shortcomings.

Miley is cute -she has the cutest facial expressions, and there's something about her that just makes her so fun to warch.  She isn't the best actress or the best singer in the world -she's young and can only get better though; and still I just can't wait for the next new episode. The show is funny in a way that sort of reminds of I Love Lucy; the way she always gets herself into situations and tries to get out of them in the funniest way. Like why didn't she tell the boy in ""I can't make you love hannah if you don't"" that she couldn't go to the Hannah Montana concert with him instead of trying to do the flinstones and be in two places at once? Not to mention rapping for him? doh di doh di doh. :) The songs are good too.. upbeat and I think they all have a good message. Parents might like that. They might also like the fact that family is an important aspect of Hannah Montana. Her father is also her manager and is like a best friend to Miley, and her relationship with her brother is like any other loving relationship between a brother and sister. -meaning they fight alot but are there for each other when it matters. I also love the fact that Miley does get the best of both worlds.",1162944000,4,1330,4.171206225680934

The only reason I gave it 3 stars was because it didn't work at first. The shows and the special features were good, though. But don't think that you should buy this movie. I think that it is just mine that didn't work. If you love Hannah Montana like me, then you should buy it.",1162684800,2,457,4.032967032967033

2627796,5,B000H5V8CM,"Can't actually review this yet since it is on pre-order but I can say that we enjoy the show. I am the mom, and I find the show is entertaining, one of the best on Disney Channel. Nothing objectionable ever, and the actors are well cast and work wonderfully together. We just saw Miley Cyrus as Hannah Montana in concert with Everlife and the Cheetah Girls, it was the last show for Hannah Montana to be on this tour, and Miley's show was excellent. She is amazingly professional at such a young age, and has a lot of charisma and talent. We will be purchasing this DVD, and we already have the soundtrack with bonus video dvd on pre-order.

YES at 91 minutes it IS POSSIBLE to have up to 4 episodes and still have room for a short interview and bonus footage. I know because I studied TV production though I chose to work in another field after college. The Hannah Montana episodes are shown during a 1/2 hour time slot, however when you deduct the opening and closing scenes and all of the commercials, you are left with about 18 minutes of actual show. Even if there are 3 episodes plus the bonus episode, that is only 72 minutes, leaving almost 20 minutes for the interview and bonus footage.",1161475200,9,1196,4.411764705882353
2627797,5,B000H5V8CM,"I love this show I have seen every episode so many times now when I watch it I say all the lines with them.

The bonus episode will most likely be Money for Nothing, Guilt for Free (which I have already seen 6 times, I downloaded it)

I can't wait for this to come out I already have the game, and have been to 2 of her concerts, so I am going to be first in line with both the CD and DVD.

For thoes who don't already know there will be 3 episodes + the bonus one.

This is my favorite show, and if you haven't seen it yet you should watch it, or if you think it won't be good at least give it a chance.

2627798,5,B000H5V8CM,"Hello everyone, I've been reading some of the reviews that other people wrote and noticed that many of you are expecting this DVD to contain several episodes of the show. The running time on this DVD is only 91 minutes...of which you would have to subtract the interview, a never before seen episode, and some other bonus footage. So it seems pretty much impossible to have several episodes of the show (other than the bonus episode) on this DVD. I'm sure that this DVD will still be good though.",1160352000,5,496,4.584269662921348
