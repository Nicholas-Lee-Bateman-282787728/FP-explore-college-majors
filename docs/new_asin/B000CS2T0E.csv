Snake People is a pretty decent Voodoo flick with Karloff, but Stanley, while a cool movie is almost unwatchable.
Clearly it was copied from an old VHS: It's warped at the top of the screen all movie long, fuzzy throughout, and the real kicker....about ten minutes before it ends the picture freezes up and it goes to the old VHS ""play"" screen then back to the movie.
Amazon wants $50 for it?! I found it at the second hand store for .50 and it's still not worth it.",1493078400,,490,4.336956521739131
