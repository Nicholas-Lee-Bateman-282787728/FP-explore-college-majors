7969456,3,B00006IUG2,"Otaru, Hanagata, Lime, Cherry, and Bloodberry have all arrived in Xian for vacation. Otaru is poisoned by a extremist faction that is trying to take over the government. After finding a cure, the Marionettes disappear and Otaru is framed for trying to assassinate the Emperor. As a fugitive, Otaru and Hanagata must go on a quest to find the Marionettes. The bad thing is that they have lost their memories.

Season 2nd isn't bad. The story is pretty good, and it's as fun as season 1. My complaints with this season are the terrible animation, and voice acting. Cherry is the only character that doesn't look deformed and have an awful voice actor. I was expecting way more. Especially since the OVA had such great animation. With a 5 star story and 1 star production quality, this anime is pretty darn average. I recommend renting or watching season 2 online instead of buying it. If you're not as disappointed as I am you may decide to buy it later.",1355961600,,952,4.633136094674557
