8043667,1,B0006VY6LC,"The production was fine until minute 43.36 of the match, at which point it froze completely - it could not be fast-forwarded, reversed, or moved in any way.

Three efforts to re-start the whole show yielded exactly the samer result - frozen at the 43.36 point.

If I knew how to do it, I would be demanding a replacement.",1377302400,,321,4.423728813559322
8043668,5,B0006VY6LC,Great rugby but the australian commentary is -- surprise surprise biased-- nevertheless a terrific DVD. I highly recommend this dvd.,1364947200,,132,5.65
8043669,5,B0006VY6LC,"England was favored (""were favored"" for the Brits) here, and this turned out to be a very exciting match.  Lots of momentum shifts and last-minute thrills.  England had a 9-point lead at halftime, and saw this lead squandered in the final minute or two of regulation when Flatley tied the scores at 14-all on a penalty kick.  In the extra time periods, both sides had successful kicks, and the score was tied at 17-all with only about 10 seconds to play in the second extra time period.

England got the ball from their scrum, successfully passed to Jonny Wilkinson, who drop-kicked the winning goal with 5 seconds left.  For any American football fans who say ""yeah, yeah.  I see that 5-6 times a seseaon--a winning field goal as time expires"", you need to understand that there aren't any time-outs, incomplete passes, quarterbacks spiking the ball.  So you need all kinds of things to go just right--the ball releasing from the scrum quickly, a good pass and catch, and finally, a successful drop-kick (which isn't easy--there are few decent drop-kickers, Wilkinson being one), and the Wallabies are charging at you in the meantime.  So a very dramatic finish, and a fine video with excellent production values--a running time of over 3 hours.",1212105600,,1246,4.872037914691943
8043670,5,B0006VY6LC,"The DVD label calls this a quarter-final match, which it is not--it's the final pool match between New Zealand and Wales, both 3-0 at the time, both going on to the quarter-finals.  The winner would play South Africa, the loser would play England (considered a tougher opponent than South Africa).  Wales had last beaten the All Blacks in 1953, and the Al Blacks were the heavy favorite here.

What ensued was a wide-open high-scoring match:  the score was 28-24 at the half, with plenty of more scoring yet to come.  You'll see some dramatic battles at the trylines, and you'll also see strategic decisions to spurn close chip-shot penalty kicks in favor of scrums in the hope of achieving tries.  It's all very exciting, a well-played match, with good production values.  Certainly an enjoyable match to watch!",1212019200,,812,4.883211678832117
8043671,5,B0006VY6LC,"2003, the year I found out about rugby thanks to Fox Sports.  If you dig no-holds-barred fighting as the ultimate expression of a man's ability, then rugby is for you.  It is brawn and finesse- strategy and a damned be all mentality.  Some matches are out of balace and the winners emerge in the first half.  Not this one.  I was seeing images of King Arthur on his second return versus the cool bravado of the Kiwi's.  This match contains the conversion qualities of the Letters of St. Paul.  I showed it in a class once as part of a geography lesson and sides were quickly drawn and the moments of brillance applauded.  Emotions ran high and it quietly demonstrated why I've lost interest in baseball.  Will you cast your pearls before the swine?",1168732800,,748,4.522388059701493
8043672,4,B0006VY6LC,"I really like this.  I like watching rugby, but I don't have to right channels to watch it on tv, so this is the next best thing.",1168473600,,129,3.7777777777777777
8043673,5,B0006VY6LC,"Definitely one of the greatest games of rugby ever. Even though I would have liked to have seen Australia win, this was still a great, edge of your seat game of rugby. I will remember this game for the rest of my life and now I own it I can re-live it over and over. My heart sank when Jonny Wilkinson kicked that winning field goal. The DVD quality is excellent so if you already own it on VHS i definitely recommend purchasing it on DVD. Congratulations to England, they deserved the win, afterall the whole team especially the forwards played really well, even though most of the points came from Jonny's boot.",1161216000,,613,4.433628318584071
8043674,5,B0006VY6LC,I bought all the semi-finals and the final.  The recording gave me an on-the-ground feeling.,1122595200,2,92,5.133333333333334
