8118424,2,B000F6ZPKO,"I actually did not buy this from Amazon, but bought it in a local record store.  While it looked amazingly awesome from the tracklist, it would not play in my regular (pretty new) Sony DVD player, because of a region error.

What is important to note is that, while Amazon has ""corrected"" their listing to show it is a PAL format, the ACTUAL DVD BOX SAYS NTSC.  I have a number of ""imported"" DVD's from metal bands, which have the Region 0 or all Region Code, and are NTSC, and work fine. In fact, that's the way their recent live DVD/CD release is, and it plays wonderfully.

But this one seems to have inherent problems in the region formatting for US folk, no matter where you buy it from.  Too bad, but good to be aware!",1309305600,,724,4.294117647058823
8118425,5,B000F6ZPKO,"This is probably a pal DVD and they should have listed that on the cover, but a lot of cheap DVD players here in America play PAL DVD's. I've had a philips and a cheap Apex that play pal DVD's. Enough of that, the concert is 2 1/2 hours of Grave Digger classics with good stereo sound. A great show if you have a DVD player that will play it. My philips is a DVP3960 from Walmart for $40 and it has 1080 upgrade. I have a lot of pal DVD concerts, so it comes in handy.",1260144000,,468,3.8350515463917527
8118426,5,B000F6ZPKO,"All german's heavy metal fans must have it. Watch PRO's. 2.5 hours of music. 5stars! You may need multimedia dvd player(buy cheap one for under $30 in K-Mart or Walmart stores, GPX or JWIN models)",1196121600,,196,4.628571428571429
8118427,3,B000F6ZPKO,my box says region 0 on it...plays o.k. in my old dell dimension 8200 (w/power dvd software)did freeze up in 1 spot about half-way through...plays fine in my xbox360...won't play at all in my jvc hr-xvc20u dvd player(only one of the few dvd's i ever bought that this won't play)...so kind of a mixed bag.if you are a grave digger fan and can put up with the few problems (and can buy it cheap) i would say go for it.great playlist of digger tunes.if you only have one device for dvd playback and no other options i might think twice about buying this one.,1193529600,,555,4.346153846153846
8118428,1,B000F6ZPKO,I just recently bought this and was disappointed to find out it doesn't work. You need a all region player to view this DVD. Only plays on computer.,1151971200,3,148,4.321428571428571
