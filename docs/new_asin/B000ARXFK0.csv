2390585,1,B000ARXFK0,"you cannot get quality for little money..should have known this.

boring, not useful at all!",1200182400,,92,5.133333333333334
2390586,5,B000ARXFK0,"At first I was like ""what is this guy doing?""  Then I realized that he is sort of a ham.  He is filled with energy and instills his enthusiasm into the teachings.  His teaching style blends humor, sound, and visualization to impart a lot of information in a short amount of time.  Some of it moves quickly, but that is the beauty of owning the DVD--you can replay it.

This is a perfect DVD for a beginner or someone who wishes to augment what they already know.",1197072000,10,462,4.264367816091954
2390587,2,B000ARXFK0,"Unfortunately the instructor assumes that because you do not know the language you must be stupid.  How else could you explain the style of delivery.  I think by definition that people who are motivated to learn a second language are not idiots - please don't treat us that way.  I would not describe the DVD as particularly effective, but in its favor it doesn't sour you to learn more (somewhere else).  I have heard CDs that almost made me want to quit learning spanish - at least this DVD does no harm.  I just wish it did more good.",1195603200,6,537,4.383838383838384
2390588,2,B000ARXFK0,old movie taken from vhs and put on dvd.,1178582400,2,40,3.5555555555555554
2390589,5,B000ARXFK0,I thought it was simple and entertaining. I am 45 years old and I was able to retain and repeat what I saw. It was fun and silly. I can watch it repeatedly and always pick up new stuff!,1175385600,14,185,3.769230769230769

8079174,4,B000ARXFK0,It was very helpful in learning to speak Spanish.,1440979200,,49,4.555555555555555
8079175,2,B000ARXFK0,Not what I was looking for.,1431907200,,27,3.6666666666666665
8079176,1,B000ARXFK0,Really!!!????  Why in the world do the use someone who has a very strong American accent to teach Spanish?  Couldn't they have contract a native speaker instead.  I would NOT recommend this video.  You should find something made by a native speaker instead if you want to get a better grasp of the correct pronunciation.,1411171200,,320,4.763636363636364
8079177,1,B000ARXFK0,"I was hoping to use this dvd in my middle school classroom as an introductory resource for my 6th, 7th, and 8th graders.  I was very disappointed.  It was probably produced in the 80s, and it's boring.  I didn't think the skits were interesting at all.  I know that this would not hold my students' attention.
I also didn't think the grammar choices were appropriate for beginning Spanish.  The present progressive - estoy preparando - does that really belong in a beginners spanish dvd?",1407283200,,487,4.75
8079178,5,B000ARXFK0,"THE DVD ""SPANISH FOR EVERYONE"" WAS VERY USEFUL TO GET ME STARTED LEARNING SOME BASIC SPANISH AND WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS THE BASICS, WITHOUT GETTING TOO INVOLVED IN THE TECHNICAL SIDE OF THE LANGUAGE.  APPEALS TO CHILDREN AND ADULTS AS WELL.",1367193600,,255,4.795454545454546
8079179,4,B000ARXFK0,"Very good instruction DVD for beginning Spanish.  Nicely structured, slow enough to grasp and understand, well planned and flows nicely.  Learned a good bit of basic Spanish...",1331424000,,176,5.481481481481482
8079180,3,B000ARXFK0,"The star of this video is a geek, no question, but he can at least keep you mildly interested.  He is very energetic and tries to introduce vocabulary via a little skit or demonstration rather than just stating the word and definition. I think this is a pretty decent start for a beginning student.",1279238400,,298,4.518518518518518
8079181,2,B000ARXFK0,"Sorry, but I agree with the comments about him being goofy.  I read that before and thought ""Ok, goofy might be good for me and my 4 year old"", but it is stupid goofy not entertaining goofy.  To begin with, he starts off acting like a doctor who is abusing his patient to make vowel sounds.  Then when a child doesn't get a balloon she kicks him in a campy way. He spends too much time lecturing in english, when I was hoping it would be scenes of real life to learn from.  He would be great at a weekly experiential learning lecturer/teacher, but the DVD is slow, not very funny and not sure his accent is very good - The Spaniards on the street thought he was the student!  I wish I had bought something more entertaining with more spanish than english.",1251590400,4,755,4.251748251748252
8079182,5,B000ARXFK0,"This video is totally cheesey and it gets the job done!  Completely straight forward and clear.  Love the fact that it has the words at the bottom of the screen-helps to learn to word when you read it as well as speak it.
This DVD will get you comfortable with the basics by simple watching and speaking along, then doing it again and again.
I am not looking for any award winning preformances in order to learn spanish...just wanted a DVD that would help me learn it-this one definitely does it's job!",1220486400,3,502,4.445652173913044
