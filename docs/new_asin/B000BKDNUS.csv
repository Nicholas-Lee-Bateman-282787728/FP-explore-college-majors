8087778,2,B000BKDNUS,A compilation of some typical american cars of the fifties. Those days america was the leader in automobile styling and had the monopoly in the USA. The cars were world famous and sold by the milions in the USA. So surprising that they are so hard to find in the USA of today. Visiting the USA today you'll won't see only cool Detroit cars. Chrome and metal have been replaced bij a whole lot of plastic and economic imported cars rule the streets. A piece of typical American culture has gone. This is a good quality dvd although the host is hard to understand by the way he's speaking.,1155945600,3,587,4.394495412844036
