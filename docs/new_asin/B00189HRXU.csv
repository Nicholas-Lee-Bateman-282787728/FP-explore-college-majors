8268980,5,B00189HRXU,"The former World Wrestling Federation InterContinental champion,
Greg ""The Hammer"" Valentine, builds up hostility and disgust after an unsuccessful bout.
Undaunted by that, the moderately flamboyant but unashamedly arrogant Hammer slams,
whacks, and pounds on his opponents, to the delight of hysterical fans and followers.

30 minutes of wrestling action from Congress Video.
