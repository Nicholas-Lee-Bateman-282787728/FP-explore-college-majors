7990854,5,B00009B8G9,kids love it and it keeps them quiet. Not a fan of caillou myself and I think it teaches kids how to be big brats but if the kids are quiet when watching it then they win and I can use it as a teaching tool as to how not to act.,1434326400,,228,3.4038461538461537
7990855,1,B00009B8G9,Disappointed that all the PBS DVDs have these puppets that come on throughout the DVD. My 2 yr old had no interest in that part which seems to happen after 10-12 mins of Caillou so suring our car rides we spend most of our time advancing the DVD.,1409961600,,246,4.145833333333333
7990856,1,B00009B8G9,DVD was not in the condition as written in the original posting. The DVD has a few deep scratches and it skips all the time (quite annoying!) Would have purchased from another vendor if i knew the dvd has scratches on it!,1317081600,,221,4.285714285714286
7990857,4,B00009B8G9,"This Caillou is one of the newer ones we have so it isn't
as familiar to me, I believe it has the puppets in between
stories, but the stories are new and interesting.",1270512000,,166,4.0606060606060606
7990858,5,B00009B8G9,"""Caillou's Treasure Hunt & Other Adventures"" is a superb DVD production that is great for any ""Caillou"" fan. Rather than airing individual episodes of the show, the DVD instead splices together content skits and segments for various episodes. Normally viewers might find this sort of editing annoying, but this works really well for ""Caillou,"" a skit/segment show by nature. ""Caillou's Treasure Hunt"" features delightful adventures in which Caillou finds a baby bird, goes a field-trip with his daycare and has a pretend-safari with Rosie and his babysitter Julie. The second portion is ""Caillou's Furry Friends,"" with animal adventures including, naturally, Gilbert and a very educational segment about dogs with jobs. Included throughout are are fun puppet segments and interludes featuring musical numbers or adventures with real kids.
The DVD menu is organized such that you can play all, or you can skip easily or if you or your kids have already seen certainly segments or want to bypass the non-Caillou material. Each includes a video-picture display that helps to quickly identify what's in each scene-selection.
Also included with the DVD are great bonus features. The best is probably the bios, which are segments pulled from the television series in which Caillou speaks on himself or one of his family members, or occasionally, a puppet-character does the talking. These segments are no longer aired on television, making this a nice bonus. There is also a matching game, DVD-ROM coloring and message to parents containing content found in the FAQ at the official website.
