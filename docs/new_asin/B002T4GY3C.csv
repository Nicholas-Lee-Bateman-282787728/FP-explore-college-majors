3983516,3,B002T4GY3C,"Positives:
Beautiful location.
Creative and somewhat interesting storyline where the capacity to influence the future when given an opportunity to change the past is more difficult than you would imagine. For a different take on this subject viewers should see ""Uncertainty"".

Neutral: Effective but timeworn use of ghosts that only our protagonists can see; wires or blue/green screen technique to suspend people; bloody stab-effect appliances.

Negatives:
Acting a bit shallow.
Story seemed disjointed (no flow) and incomplete particularly in showing the connectivity between scenes or offering enough explanation so that the viewer is not going ""huh!"".
Really dumb scenes like being chased by a truck while driving and not noticing it coming up behind you on a endlessly flat Patagonia road. Not asking for help at a busy diner when removing a kidnapped young girl from the trunk of the kidnapper's truck while leaving the mom there. Not calling police at first and later  the police not being responsive.",1278374400,4,1008,5.327044025157233

3983518,4,B002T4GY3C,"This movie was quite a pleasant and horrifying surprise! It was well directed with a pervasive sense of dread, nail-biting suspense, and delivers several jolting shocks of terror. The only problem I had with it were a few instances where characters suddenly do stupid things that go against all rational judgement under the circumstances. Aside from a few of these flaws (sure to be exploited by the haters) the movie overall is very tight and some scenes of suspense are VERY INTENSE. There are some stunning revelations as well, which makes it more interesting than your average horror movie. The political aspect of the story isn't overpowering and is only briefly discussed, providing a suitable backdrop for the horror. There are really no boring scenes and there is an abundance of stark terror that will surely satisfy those looking for real scares. Yes, this is a Spanish language movie with subtitles but those who won't watch movies just because they have subtitles will be missing a great movie.",1266969600,28,1006,4.994047619047619

3983521,5,B002T4GY3C,"I didn't even mind the subtitles in this taut ghost story/thriller.  Talk about atmospheric and intriguing -- this film has it all -- deeply creepy locations, excellent score, superb acting, and a plot that delivers despite a bit more gore than I really prefer.  Don't let that scare you off (!) however -- I think the little bit of gore here has meaning and purpose (seriously) in the context of what this film is ultimately about.  Elegant manipulation of time and emotions.  Highly recommended.  (BTW, contrary to the picture, this is not a movie about spirit possession.)

3983522,4,B002T4GY3C,"The plot makes use of a darker side of Argentinian history in this horror film.  The film also plays on the theme of time travel, and imposing non linear subsequent histories while maintaining an over arching linear time sequence.  That is, looping sequences of history while imposing conservative immutability on this, meaning what is doomed to happen will happen again and again once an event has taken place.  In the same vein as The Triangle.",1388102400,,446,4.92
3983523,4,B002T4GY3C,I've watched it twice so far and have still to figure out all the details.  I still have several unanswered questions.  A good psychological thriller.,1373760000,,150,4.96

3983525,3,B002T4GY3C,"I don't want to spoil this. It was decent enough. The subtitles are a little irritating, but you get use to it. The story was good. It tied it all together, even though I knew where it was going. The end was a little strange, but that happens in a ""horror"" movie. Overall it was ok. No real gory parts (in my opinion, you may disagree), but it did have some good moments. I would say it was worth watching for the price. If you don't like subtitles, don't get this movie. That's the one bad point with me in general.",1361145600,,516,4.118811881188119
3983526,5,B002T4GY3C,"If you don't understand the history of Argentina in the late 70s to early 80s, you probably won't get this film. You have to watch it with this context in mind. The movie slowly but surely builds in suspense, all the while you understand more and more of what this particular ghost story is about. The ""Desparacidos"" was Argentina's 9/11, but on a much larger scale and more horrific in that it was done to the Argentinian people by their own government. The ending tied it all together. The beautiful landscape is a surreal setting for the horror and somehow makes the wrongness stand out even more. I thought the acting was top notch.",1353715200,,636,4.587719298245614
3983527,4,B002T4GY3C,"WHAT KIND OF MOVIE IS IT???

Well it is a horror movie set in Argentina.  And yes it is Sub-titled... BUT do not let that take away from this movie!!!  If you skip it because of that YOU WILL MISS OUT!!!

THE MOVIE STARTS:

Siblings  Malena and Pablo, brother and sister, meet in a hospital to sign the order to pull the plug on their father.  He is a bastard and  Malena wants to just sign the papers, but Pablo convinces her to wait, until they at least see their childhood home.

THEN they find the diary.  The diary contains photos and details of horrible murders and kidnappings that took place twenty years before.

They stop for the night and PAST and PRESENT become like one.  They witness the horrible torture and murder of a family, just like it described in the diary!

They get out of there and HE tries to save the people, but they do not know if the people are even real or ghosts, or what!  They ""follow the diary"" by seeing where and what the next killing will be.  It is through this that they realize where and what the horror of ""The Disappeared"" is.

Even though this is the basis for what happened twenty years ago... the movie does not focus on this and just uses it as part of the story.

The movie has many scary scenes and places with very creepy ghosts and psychos!  There are a few places where the characters make choices that seem VERY far fetched... but they are small parts and can easily be ignored.  Like... WHAT? Don't go in there!  ...or why not turn around and run now???  DON'T let that stop you from having a wonderful time watching a great horror movie with a likable cast and a mystery stuck in for good measure!

Have fun!!!

P.S.  A FACTUAL NOTE:

So What was this murder business all based on???

The Argentina Military Dictatorship and regime where responsible for the disappearances and deaths of upwards of 30,000 people in the Anti-communism genocide in that country from 1976 - around 1983.  A horrible atrocity that the movie bases the premise and not the story.  You'll like it!",1353628800,,2028,4.4227642276422765
3983528,1,B002T4GY3C,"There's a scene in the movie Adaptation where Charlie is trying to explain to his screenwriter brother that he can't just create a plot with implausible twists just for the sake of making things seem complex. That's exactly what happens in this movie. Nothing makes sense on purpose (to try to cover the fact that the main plot points are highly predictable), it's frustrating on purpose, and it's annoyingly riddled with plot holes as a result. If you can get past that, or just knowing that going in, may help you enjoy the movie as a fun suspense film. The characters are fun, the acting is decent, it looks good, and the story had potential. But the plot felt like I was watching a first draft screenplay before someone actually looked at it to see if it made any sense.

And then there were moments like this:(this isn't a spoiler) We just rescued someone from a psychopath in public in front of other people. Don't call the cops, they'll think we kidnapped her... for some reason. Yes none of these other people who saw this go down can help. We probably shouldn't even tell these other people here that there's another victim alive inside this empty automobile parked in front of them. Drive a mile down the road, take a nap. AH!

That being said, I didn't hate the movie entirely. I would have given it another star, but didn't feel it deserved the 4-stars it currently has, so I thought I'd knock my review down a peg.",1345420800,,1427,4.5271317829457365
3983539,4,B002T4GY3C,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film, had a pretty decent plot. Although listed under a horror genre it doesn't come across like a typical horror/slasher flick, this movie has a more ghostly/thriller feel and there's an actual story behind it and not a bunch of teenagers being chased by chainsaws. A few bloody scenes but it is not scary. Took a little while to figure out for sure what was going on but towards the end it all starts to come together.",1341964800,3,455,4.493975903614458
3983540,4,B002T4GY3C,"I loved this supernatural-thriller.  The actors were great.  However, the story it did fall a little short when ""Dad"" was able to touch the living- ' cause it was like.... although the past could only seemingly be altered while Dad was brain dead, apparently when his brain activity suddenly became active, Dad could now hurt the living. But the movie caught up with itself, and the explanation was acceptable.
Overall- I think it would be a great made for TV movie. Kudos Amazon Studios!",1341446400,,488,4.7976190476190474

3983543,3,B002T4GY3C,"Shortly after the movie begins, you feel very fond of the extremely likeable protagonist, Pablo, though his hard-boiled sister, Malena, takes a bit longer to care about. It's hard to summarize this movie without giving away key parts of the plot - your anxiety and fear for the sister and brother accelerate immensely as the movie progresses and they begin seeing very clear and realistic ghosts from a past that increasingly seems connected to them.

This movie is well done, but it takes a very long time to tell the story and there are some pretty violent, repetitive scenes of the murder of a family that connects to their own past. I think the end did not tie up very strongly, though I found the the last moments to be very moving - showing in a very graphic way the sacrifices that have been made for Spain by the victims of its past. Although not as strong as Il Orfanato or The Devil's Backbone, this is another film that suggests a brilliantly developing film genre in Spain.",1336348800,2,985,4.564971751412429

3983547,5,B002T4GY3C,"well, i must admit i'm easy in that put the word ""supernatural"" in the description and i have to at least check it out.  but this was, if not entirely unpredictable, well told, and very well performed, with even an element of morality play - not overdone.  in the sense that the evil that humans do haunts us all, what indeed surrounds us?  the question is not philosophical, although it's symbolism is unmistakable.  i gave it 5 stars.",1332892800,4,436,4.551282051282051

3983559,4,B002T4GY3C,"Good acting and a decent storyline, but what most reviewers aren't mentioning is the way this tale of horror is conveying the tragedies of the many people who ""disappeared"" under totalitarian regimes - often tortured then killed.

3983564,5,B002T4GY3C,"This is a horror movie with the sub genre of haunting or ghost story and let me tell you, good ghost stories are hard to come by.  It had at least one or two ""jump out of your seat"" moments.  It was eery, intense with it's share of action, but what surprised me the most was that it was a very emotionally moving picture.

I like to multitask so for me to sit and watch a movie with subtitles the movie has to be well worth it and this one was! I know just enough Spanish to know that at least some of the subtitles were way off, but the visuals told such a good story I didn't care. I couldn't fold clothes or sort through my mail or Ebay or shop, but I am glad because it was well worth my full attention and I didn't lose interest. I usually don't want to watch horror before bed, but the ending didn't leave me too afraid to go down into my dungeon to sleep. :) That is not to say I won't have nightmares, but that's part of the fun!",1328313600,22,937,3.9210526315789473

3983567,1,B002T4GY3C,"I wanted to buy this movie for a long time because it looked scary,and after I did,I was sorry. I was totally disappointed in the acting and story! The movie brings nothing new to the table,it starts promising,but then it's a total hit and miss. I got tricked in getting it by the fact that in the description,it was compared with""the Devil's backbone"" which is an amazing movie.""The Appeared"" doesn't even come close to it-one of the worst""supposed to be scary""movie I've ever seen!

With tributes to 'THE SHINING' and Aussie road movies, Cabeza gives us a truly terrifying tale of hauntings and spatial time disruptions entering into the every day lives of brother and sister Pablo and Malena acted brilliantly by Ruth Diaz and Javier Pereira.  With a haunting music score by Oscar Araujo and chilling photography by Andrew Rebes, this is the best ghost story to arrive on the scene in many a year and I pray that Hollywood doesn't get its hands on it for an unnecessary remake.

8379831,5,B002T4GY3C,"I speak/read not an ounce of Spanish, but subtitles do not bother me. After years of taking film study classes, including graduate courses for my minor in film studies/criticism (PhD), I have become used to them. I shudder to think of the Italian, French, Swedish, and Asian films I would have missed out on had I not learned to rely on subtitles. Being hearing-impaired, I now use them for English-speaking films as well. That said, I have come to admire Spanish films in the horror genre -- possibly beginning with OPEN YOUR EYES (remade as VANILLA SKIES).

THE APPEARED, as it awkwardly reads in English,  is a challenging film and disturbing in a non-horror sense. It reminded one viewer of THE SHINING, but I was reminded of THE SIXTH SENSE, particularly at the end when the ghost girl touches the window of the car, leaving her heat print on the glass for a few seconds. No pun intended, but it  is quite touching, as is much of the film. I was beginning to tear up at the end, and this does not usually happen in a horror film. I didn't know about Argentina's political history but now, to a limited degree, I get the idea. Whether this happens in Argentina or in any country . . . the point is quite sobering. The reference to 9/11 adds an ironic (and chilling) touch to the denouement.

Someone mentioned Hollywood producing a remake of this film, as it did with OPEN YOUR EYES. I don't think it would be remade, not without be-headings or stabbings and gushing blood to satisfy the low-brows. (An American film that provided suspense without heavy duty gore is IT FOLLOWS, one of my favorite horror films of recent years. Another is the earlier THE MOTHMAN PROPHESIES -- a class act.)

This dramatic, time-twisting, suspense-filled thriller is certainly worth your time if you don't mind a film that does not dumb-down everything for you.",1455235200,,1848,4.656441717791411
