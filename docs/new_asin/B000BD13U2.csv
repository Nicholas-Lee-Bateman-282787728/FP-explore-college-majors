8085371,5,B000BD13U2,"Cute movie about Muzzy the Bear teaching French words to children... he speaks slowly with a cute story line.  My kids learned French as children, and now I bought this set for my grand-daughters!
I highly recommend, unfortunately these are in VHS tapes, but the little ones don't know the difference.  They still enjoyed it!",1365379200,2,325,4.890909090909091
