564149,5,6303120741,"Berthold Brecht was reputedly (by those who knew him) a first class swine and a phoney Communist - but so what?  He wrote the best poetry-play of all time in the Dreigrasschenoper - even if the did steal the story and plot - hr still did the best job of presenting it to the world and it still lives.
It would have benefitted from better sound reproducing techniques and color but that can't be nor can we haul the first-rate
actors out of their graves - - - but that is not to be so I'm satisfied with what we've got.  It's first-rate!!!",1399420800,2,538,4.213592233009709

564151,5,6303120741,"G.W. Pabst's version of `The 3penny Opera' is simply sublime with a formidable casting and a magnificent cast with: Ernst Busch as a street singer, Carola Neher, who died in a soviet prison, as Polly and Lotte Lenya as Jenny. The mass scenes (without the help of computer games) are nothing less than masterful. But, above all are the texts of Bertolt Brecht and the magical songs by Kurt Weill; just delicious stuff.

This eternal masterpiece doesn't paint a rosy picture of human affairs, with a city (pars pro toto - the world) in the hands of people with shark teeth, venal civil servants and a corrupt police force. Bertolt Brecht formulates in simple words the rules of the game, the basics of human society: first grub, then morals. If the primary conditions for human survival (food, safety) are not available, then there is absolutely no ground for any kind of morality. For Bertolt Brecht, in a `free for all' society the poor, the vast majority of the population, can only survive by (organized) begging and stealing, by dirty works (`Missetat').
After fighting one another, the crime bosses find a far better solution for the consolidation of their power. They make a super deal, pool their resources and create a financial syndicate of criminals, in other words, a bank, with the former corrupt police chief as CEO. What an awesome prophetic idea!
With brilliant theatrical histrionics and a perfect `London' atmosphere, G.W. Pabst shot an ageless movie masterpiece based on an everlasting opera.
A must see.",1372377600,,1521,4.94140625
564152,5,6303120741,"I've had the stereo album of die dreigroschenoper for many many years, and didn't know about the film until finding it here. Thanks!",1362528000,,132,4.782608695652174
564153,4,6303120741,"Once a staple of critics' ten best ever lists, neither version of G.W. Pabst's once controversial adaptation of The Threepenny Opera offered on this impressive two-disc set has quite stood the test of time as well as hoped. Shot in different languages and with different casts - fairly commonplace in the early days of sound - they do make an interesting contrast, though. The German version has a harder heart, more severity and the better rendition of Mack the Knife, but the lighter French version has a more charming Mack the Knife (or Mackie the Knifeman as they insist on calling him) in Albert Prejean: it's hard to see Rudolf Forster's German incarnation, more prop than performance, being able to dominate a housewife let alone the London underworld. Fine technique and great production design, but it often feels more of a technical exercise than a real cry from the streets.

Any disappointment in the films are amply compensated for with the great extras on the Criterion Region 1 NTSC DVD, though, including a rather interesting documentary on the doomed lawsuit Brecht launched against Pabst for distorting his work alongside both the French and German versions. Curiously another extra on the differences between the two versions reveals that Brecht was more excited about the casting of the French Polly Peachum (Florelle) than the German one (Carola Neher) because he and Lotte loved her voice. Unfortunately she's not as commanding as she needs to be when taking over the gang, but ain't that always the problem with screen musicals - you either get someone who can sing but can't act or someone who can act but can't sing. (Incidentally, Antonin Artaud turns up as the 'new beggar' in the French version.)",1292716800,7,1724,4.965397923875432

564276,4,6303120741,"The film is wonderful. The restoration of the print is shockingly beautiful. I have seen the film many times before, but watching this version was like seeing a whole new film.

The extras are a mixed bag--and aren't they a big part of why we buy Criterion editions? Some are interesting. (Having the entire French version is cool.) But the commentary is really bad. The two profs speaking have only a simpleminded understanding of Brecht's theory of Epic Theater, Gestus, Lehrstuck, etc so their ""explanations"" are more misleading than informative.

Also, some misinformation in the documentaries. For example, one film expert claims there is link between the stage musical and Weimar cabaret.  Lenya famously said that she and Weill never set foot in a cabaret and anyone familiar with what went on there would recognize there was little connection. However, someone who only knows the Weimar cabaret genre from the Kander and Ebb musical which borrows from Threepenny might imagine there is a connection. But shouldn't scholars correct misconceptions, rather than promoting them?

If there was a better commentary track and more accurate documentaries, this would be five-star.",1203120000,19,1180,5.26063829787234
564277,4,6303120741,"Several other reviewers here have complained about the substantial differences between the movie and Brecht's stage version.  If you review the bonus materials that come with this lovely Criterion edition, you'll learn that the main reason that the film is so different is that Brecht himself made vast changes to his own play after he was hired to be the screenwriter (so many changes, in fact, that he ended up getting fired and sued by the film's producers, who had wanted the movie to track the hit stage version).  Nevertheless, even though Brecht ended up at war with the filmmakers, most of the variations that exist between the film and the stageplay are based on changes Brecht himself made as a screenwriter.

As for the film itself, it's remarkable (at least, as long as you're forgiving of its differences from the play).  I particularly like the fact that Criterion has included both the superior German language version and a French version that was also created (with different actors) for release in France.  The superiority of the German actors' performance is why that version is so much better--but it's a novelty to be able to compare the two (which were shot one after the other on the same sets).

564279,5,6303120741,"I have been waiting for a quality restoration for DVD of this masterpiece for a long time.  As usual, Criterion Collection does not disappoint. It should be made clear from the outset, though, that this is definitely Pabst's cinematic reworking of ""Threepenny Opera"", and not really the work as Brecht intended it. Indeed, it is well-known that Brecht fought Pabst's interpretation fiercely, and was barred from the set of the film. Still, most of the score is still present, superbly performed, with Brecht's incomparably acerbic lyrics intact. {Brecht's poetry in general and his song lyrics in particular have never been satisfactorily translated, and can be fully appreciated only in German.) The major link in this film between Brecht's original concept and Pabst's version is surely the presence of Lotte Lenya, whose performance (particularly of ""Seeraeuberjenny""} is well worth the price of the DVD all by itself!
Pabst has created a film version of ""Threepenny Opera"" which, while not Brecht's own vision of the piece, goes a long way towaard showing us what musical theatre can (and should more often) be.",1193270400,15,1115,5.194444444444445

564282,2,6303120741,"I've seen the movie version of this, one of the best scores and scripts created in the ""musical theatre genre."" While Lotte Lenya and the supporting cast are very good, this version is hardly true to Brecht or his  style. Apparently Brecht did not understand that by selling the screen  rights to the script, he was also giving the producers liscence to do  whatever the wanted with it - and he had no power over it. The endind is  notably changed from any translation you are likely to find in print, and  few of the best songs remain - as a matter of fact, i recall only about  four or five songs in the film verison. Mr. And Mrs. Peachum, while  wonderfully portrayed, are far from the middle-class underlords we love  them to be - they were a mismatched pair, Mrs. Peachum in a fabulous dress,  and drop earings, and Peachum looking like one of his beggars.

564283,3,6303120741,"This is a far cry from the stage version with not only several songs missing but what seems to be a rewrite of the script and book. The acting is pre-1931--as one history of cinema puts its, a style we will never see  again--and the film techniques are from the silent days. But it has some  powerful moments, mostly when the Streetsinger is on screen. Among the  visual highlights are the confrontation of the Army of Poor with the Queen  (who looks too old to be Victoria), the marriage of Polly and Mack among  the purloined furniture and trappings, and the marvelous resolution of the  ex-police chief Brown, Mack, and Peachem becoming ""respectable""  bankers (i.e., thieves). So this is worth a good deal as a social document  is but is not worth much as a musical event.

7838195,5,6303120741,"Why is this movie so great?  Ill try to explain five of the reasons.

 Firstly its amazing for what it says  indirectly. The actual story is unusual enough, but the implications and overall meaning are still vibrant. And it started out as The Beggars Opera, a suggestion to his colleague (John Gay) by Jonathan Swift. Class distinctions, human rights, forms of government are thriving themes.

 Secondly, it captures the spirit of the times    premiering in Berlin in 1931. There are works of art that do this. The Zeitgeist is authentic. Its a time machine of a representation. As a member of  humanity, a person can look at this as where he/she came from; what his/her forebears in consciousness went through.

 The third reason is the challenge. The viewer can think about this and question to his/her hearts content. And its no waste of time or effort.  If the impulse to turn away is resisted (it doesnt seduce), it may just lead to original thinking. Thats Brecht. Granted, he thinks he has all the answers, and he doesnt. Its supposed to shock, and test conformist ideas. Alright its not for the  vulnerable. But it may also develop immunity to harshness.

 Fourth, the technical aspects shouldnt be ignored, because of the high art. The camera work is superb - panning, cutting, highs, lows, angles, light and dark, shadows, shadow outlines, etc. And theres a lot being said in the sets and gestures. Its all conveyed to the viewer, and in keeping with the style and themes. Further film was a new genre when this was done. The settings are visual studies, no doubt about it. Varied, full of meaning, conveying, communicating. Contrast the coronation parade with the warehouse wedding. Yet its all one with the whole.

 Fifth is the powerful symbolism, which seems impenetrable. But read the Communist Manifesto  (1864)  by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels and it will be clear as day. The gaze, the bowler hats, the statues, the thinginess are all degrading to the human psyche. Those objects are definitely more interesting than the characters. Man was to be merely a placeholder in society, changing roles, no self or basic identity. The eyes in this movie are not windows of any soul.

 You don't have to agree with the ideas, just appreciate the expressiveness, the artistry. But thats the point anyway  --  original thinking.",1512172800,2,2337,4.858227848101266
7838196,5,6303120741,"This is an early adaptation from play to film; being a different media one should be judged with that criterion in mind. Now you may pick on sound and picture quality; Yet again one needs to keep the time of production and copy quality in mind.

I also think that this makes a better stage play and the variations in performances intriguing. However as with listening to the radio in the car, it is the best we can do to keep the memory of the actual orchestra. So when we have to listen to Wayne Newton, we can still imagine ""Mack die Messer"" No time in 113 minutes for all the songs.

This play was not anti-Nazi in nature. The Nazi regime did not like this play because it showed how illegitimacy could rise to respectability. And as they say in ""Harry Potter"" books, ""you know who,"" thought that this was too close to the truth.

One of my favorite parts is the marriage of Mackie Messer (Rudolf Foster) a tad pernicious character to Polly (Carola Neher). They collected items from all over to create the perfect environment.

If you are into movies that irk Nazi's try ""Westfront 1918 (1930)"" Directed by Georg Wilhelm Pabst. You may have to search but it is out there.

Anyway, this is a good movie and worth watching. And watching again.",1501027200,,1244,4.462555066079295

7838201,5,6303120741,"Filmed just before the Nazis came to power, and banned when they did, DIE 3-GROSCHEN OPER is a brilliant version of the Brecht classic.

Set in a dystopian London full of dark shadows and concealed streets, director G. W. Pabst foregrounds the musical's satire of corruption.  Macheath's (Rudolf Forster's) gang patrol the streets looking for anything to steal, rivaled only by Peachum's (Fritz Rasp's) gang of would-be beggars who become thoroughly proficient at putting on an act so as to screw more money out of the punters.  In this stew of corruption concepts such as marriage mean little - although Macheath marries Polly Peachum (Carola Neher), he scarcely remains faithful to her, preferring to keep his regular Thursday date in the local whorehouse with Jenny (Lotte Lenya) in particular.  Sentenced to death by hanging, Macheath eventually escapes from prison and joins Peachum in a huge cartel that dominates the center of London.

Kurt Weill's music and Brecht's lyrics offer a stinging satire of contemporary life.  The tunes might be memorable, but here they are sung with an emotionlessness designed to make viewers reflect on their true meaning.  The narrator (Ernst Busch) addresses us direct to camera, not only prompting our responses but warning us about what will happen next.  Such techniques are part of the technique known as Verfremdungseffekt, or alienation, designed to prevent us identifying with the characters and thereby forcing us to concentrate on the text's social criticism.  Pabst manages this aspect of the film extremely well; by the end we fully understand the implications of living in a rapacious society where only the fittest survive.

Having said that, DIE 3 GROSCHEN-OPER is also a very funny film.  There is one particularly memorable set piece taking place in an isolated warehouse where Macheath and Polly are due to be married by a timorous Reverend (Hermann Thimig) who is looking for any excuse to escape at the earliest possible opportunity.  The fact that he cannot do so attests to the strength of Macheath's gang.

Brilliantly restored in the early 2000s, Pabst's film combines early sound techniques and a clever management of space to produce an acknowledged classic, as timely today as it was when it first appeared over eight decades ago.",1463011200,,2297,5.14247311827957

7838204,5,6303120741,"The movie came out in 1931 and was an adaptation of a Stage play of the same name.  This is mostly a musical, with less songs than the play, but the most enduring song form the play and the movie is ""Mack the Knife"".  The film has communist overtones and was banned by the Nazi's.  The story takes place in London and revolves around 'Make the Knife"" a dangerous criminal, whose deadly exploits are explained in the song Mack the Knife.  Mack marries Polly Peachum in an elaborate ceremony in an old warehouse down by the river.  Two of the Characters reminded me of Laurel and Hardy. There is very little dialog for the first 20 minutes or so.  I enjoyed the film and it is all in German.  After the wedding Polly father The Beggar King of London, decides to have Mack arrested an hung.  What follows is a series of events that revolve around the Queen's Coronation.  The actors do a great job and Lotte Lenya can sing and does not have a knife in her shoe. Her best known role, that most might remember is that of Rosa Kleb in From Russia with Love.  There is also a French version of the movie on disc two.  We don't understand fully why Mack and the Police Chief are such friends until the end of the film, when they sing the Cannon song.  The music is enjoyable and there is humor that keeps the movie interesting.  There is a police chase and a anti government march.  The communist overtones are very apparent when, Mr. Peachum, incites the poor to march on the Queen's coronation. Great movie.",1416528000,4,1501,4.371841155234657
