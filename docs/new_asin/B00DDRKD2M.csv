8592283,4,B00DDRKD2M,"This documentary provides a pretty good overview of the study of wolf behavior in the Sawtooth Mountains. Jim Dutcher's footage is some of the best I've seen of wolves. So why four stars instead of five? Most of this particular documentary is basically the same as ""Living with Wolves"", and the documentary felt a little like a shortened version of ""Living with Wolves"". A main difference between the two documentaries is that this one also includes some information about the wolf persecution, reintroduction, and education taking place when it was filmed. If you want the full story of the wolves in the Sawtooth Mountains, or if you just like wolves in general, I would highly suggest ""Living with Wolves"" (also available for a low price n Amazon). ""Living with Wolves"" is longer and provides the full story of the Sawtooth Mountain wolf project. This is still a pretty good DVD, but I personally prefer ""Living with Wolves"".",1452643200,4,928,4.917197452229299
