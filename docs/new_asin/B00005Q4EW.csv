1644617,5,B00005Q4EW,"Newly crowned the favorite video of my meager collection... I loved it. It was great to relive some of the older tag team matches and see the Hardys' reactions to them as well. The behind the scenes moments were also a welcome treat for the avid Hardy Boyz fan. All in all, fun for the whole family. Well, maybe not the whole family... fun for me at least. :)",1006732800,,359,4.217391304347826

1644619,5,B00005Q4EW,"Great DVD!  The extras in this make it all worthwhile.  It contains the historic ladder match from No Mercy '99 with Edge and Christian, both TLC matches, and even a the cage match from Unforgiven 2000!  Provides a really cool look into both of the Hardy Boyz's lives too.  Well worth the money!!!!!",1005264000,6,299,4.584905660377358

1644651,5,B00005Q4EW,"I DID ENJOY THE HARDY'S MOVIE AND WISH JEFF WAS STILL IN WWE, IF U LIKE HIGH FLYING MOVES THAT LEAVE U IN AWWW THEN I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS VIDEO.",1126569600,,150,4.033333333333333
1644652,5,B00005Q4EW,"This dvd has to be one of the greatest dvds ever put out. The documentary is very well done and doesnt feel rushed like other WWE documentarys seem to do, for example Hulk Hogans on Hulk Still Rules dvd is very rushed it seems. The best feature is the extra matches, all i can say is holy sh#%! Ive seen clips of the matches before but when I saw them in full I said that phrase alot, I was so amazed at this pheomonal tag team. They are were one of the greatest tag teams ever to step into the WWF; Its to bad Vince cant manage his company worth crap anymore, and they let Jeff Hardy go. Hell, they let alot of good workers go in the past few years and its a damn shame. Jeff is one of the bravest, hardest working wrestlers you'll ever have the pleasure to watch. I recommend this to wrestling fans or tag team lovers. Anyone who says wrestling is fake-watch this and tell me if you think after watching one TLC match-it might be scripted but the injuries are real.",1108080000,3,967,4.148936170212766
1644663,5,B00005Q4EW,"This DVD is #24 out of 130 greatest WWE DVD's.  It is a classic DVD and nothing less.  It has the greatest Hardyz matches ever and there hand picked by the Hardyz.

Hardy Boyz vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Edge & Christian was the first ever TLC match and it was awesome and if it is not in the top 5 matches ever I will never watch wrestling again because this is probably #3 behind the WrestleMania Triple Threat and HHH vs. HBK HIAC.

This is a great DVD and a definte pick up if you like high-flying action you will not be disappointed by the results.",1102204800,3,545,4.113207547169812
1644664,5,B00005Q4EW,"The Hardy Boys: Leap of Faith"" DVD is one of the best WWE DVD's to date.  The main portion of the DVD is a biography in the lives of Jeff and Matt Hardy.  It follows them from their childhood, their start as wrestlers, and where they stood at the time of DVD. (Unfortunately Jeff is currently wrestling in another organization). Included in the biograpy are Matt and Jeff explaining what was occuring in some of their matches while watching them on tape.  (The matches are the ladder match at No Mercy '99 and the triangle ladder match from Wrestlemania 2000.

The DVD extras include six of Matt and Jeff's favorite matches as handpicked by themselves.

1. Hardy Boys vs. Acolytes (7/5/99 RAW - WWF Tag Team Championship)

The Hardy's get their first taste of WWF gold.  Not the best match, but it is important for history's sake.  (7/10)

2. The Brood vs. Edge & Christian (No Mercy 1999 - Finals of the Terri Invitational Tournament/Ladder Match)

This is the match which put the four competitors on the map as main event wrestlers.  There are numerous amazing spots by all four men in this match.  Watch for Jeff's catapult on Matt and Christian. This is one of my all-time favorite matches.  (10/10)

3. Hardy Boys vs. Edge & Christian vs. Dudley's (Summerslam 2000 - WWF Tag Team Championship/TLC Match)

First TLC match in WWF history (although the triangle ladder match at Wrestlemania 2000 basically turned into one).  Once again, an amazing performance by all six individuals.  Every competitor had their fair share of highlights in this match.  The action is fast paced from the get-go.  Probably the best TLC match to date.  (10/10)

4. Hardy Boys vs. Edge & Christian (Unforgiven 2000 - WWF Tag Team Championship/Steel Cage Match)

Once again Edge & Christian appear on this DVD.  It shows the admiration and respect these four have for one another.  Kind of a slow match.  Amazing spot as Jeff does a moonsault off the top of the cage.  Watch for concierto on Edge on the top of the cage.  (8.5/10)

5. Hardy Boys (vs) Edge & Christian (vs) Dudley's (Wrestlemania 17/WWF Tag Team Championship/TLC Match)

The match is a little slower than the TLC match at Summerslam, but is still amazing nonetheless.  Spike, Lita, and Rhyno all make appearances in the match  Once again, numerous amounts of high spots.  Watch for the spear by Edge on Jeff of the hanging belt.  It may the best move in history of the WWE.  (9.5/10)

6. Hardy Boys & Lita vs. Two Man Power Trip & Stephanie McMahon (4/9/01 RAW)

I am not really sure why this match was included.  My only guess is because of Austin and Triple H.  Decent match.  Pretty crazy as well as sick ending.  (7.5/10)

There is also some candid video clips included in the extra features.

I definatley recomend purchasing this DVD.  One of the best WWE DVD's to date.

Overall rating: 9.5/10",1092700800,,2847,4.664646464646465
1644665,5,B00005Q4EW,"This is without doubt the best DVD offered by WWE Home Video.  If you like the Hardy Boyz and the infamous TLC matches with the Dudleys and Edge and Christian, this DVD is a must have.  It contains all of the Hardy's most spectacular matches in their entirety and also has comments and interviews with the Hardys themselves.",1047081600,2,324,4.568965517241379
1644666,5,B00005Q4EW,"I own several of these WWE DVDs that focus on specific individuals in the WWE. This DVD is by far one of the better ones, for its complete-ness (Bonus Full Matches-no skipping,
Footage that was banned from being replayed due to protests by the public, etc). Hardyz and Lita vs. HHH, Austin, and Stephanie.
Others in the series leave you wanting more, and constantly asking yourself (when the DVD is done) Is that it? If you are a fan of the HardyZ, buy this DVD! You will not regret it.
If you are not a fan of the Hardy Boyz, you should still buy it because it is a DVD you can watch over and over. It also gives the viewer a better definition of what makes wrestling what it is.

1644667,5,B00005Q4EW,"I really loved this DVD.  It gives you alot of backstory and old home videos of Jeff and Matt when they were kids.  It is really emotional in some points and crazy in others.  I wish it had more home movies, like the Lita DVD had.  Home videos of just Jeff, Matt and the gang hanging out and having a good time.  Instead it was just videos and pictures of Matt and Jeff as kids.  Other than that, it is one of my favorites.",1032825600,2,423,3.9761904761904763
1644668,5,B00005Q4EW,"This is a blast for any fan of the Hardy Boyz, which includes me. From a beginning scene of Matt and Jeff posing around ladders and the Hardy Boyz pendant to running commentary from the Boyz on some of their biggest matches, this has it all.
In the extras box is six matches, TLC I & II, the Unforgiven cage match, the Acolytes first tag-team title win, a six-person intergender and the ladder match that made the boys Superstars, as well as home videos of the boys in different locations. Some of the funniest moments happen in the home video scenes, which includes some homemade promos from their indy organisation, and a slightly weird scene of Matt and Jeff acting in what looks like a play (listen to the slap/punch...ow).
All in all, if you don't like the Hardyz don't get it, 'cause you'll be bored witless, but if you can even tolerate them and have a bit of cash lying around, get this DVD.",1025568000,,899,4.454545454545454
1644669,5,B00005Q4EW,"Most of the WWF DVD's are pretty good but as of right now, April 1st 2002, this is probably the best they have done yet. It is a good hour long feature that follows the Hardys around and goes into some detail about their roots. Plus the Matches on the disc are great. All of the Major Hardy Boyz matches are on the disc and a make it worth owning. I'm glad I have it.",1017532800,,367,3.9066666666666667
1644670,4,B00005Q4EW,"This is definitely a must get for fans of the Hardys, as well as those who enjoy something a bit different than the standard ""shill for the fed"" tape.  In fact, this DVD really lets you into the real personalities of the two Hardys, which are really not that different from what we see on-camera.
Of course, there is lots of good footage of their major matches, although for some reason, their Royal Rumble 2000 Table match with the Dudleys is ignored (possibly because it was on the TLC tape--although that doesn't stop them from going over the WM and No Mercy ladder matches).  Still, there is a lot of great stuff, including some footage of them even before they had WWF contracts.  They talk about how they learned from wrestling many of the stars whenever they would get a shot in the WWF.  If you look closely enough, you can even see Jeff Hardy taking a beating from RVD sometime in 97.  You also get a hilarious look at some of their home-made promos, and their independent work.
But even more important, you really get a nice insight to the guys.  Especially interesting is Jeff's obsession with motorbikes, which leads him to create a volcano in his yard, just so he can jump it.  The boy is truly insane.
And the DVD extras are pretty good as well.  They have their first tag title win against the Acolytes, the No Mercy ladder match that made their careers, the Summerslam and WM TLC matches, them winning the tag titles against Edge & Christian in a cage at Unforgiven 2000, and a six person match wth Lita against Austin, HHH and Stephanie.
As was suggested below,Ii would have replaced the TLC2 with TLC3, which was a better match, and one that has not been released on video yet, and it would have been nice to feature a singles match from each of the guys, but otherwise, a nice selection.
Go get it if you like these guys",1007769600,7,1839,4.4523809523809526
1644671,4,B00005Q4EW,Overall this was an extremely well put together dvd.  It contains a lot of home video footage of the hardy boyz that you cannot find anywhere else.  The dvd details their entire career from their days on the independant scene to their career in the world wrestling federation.  The dvd also has some pretty cool extras.  It contains six of the hardyz favorite matches and another section of home videos.  The only disappointment is that it does not include the TLC 3 match that took place on smackdown!  I was really hoping this match would be included b/c I felt that it was a better match than TLC 2 at wrestlemania.,1006819200,2,618,4.5225225225225225

7949720,5,B00005Q4EW,"As I said on their the recently released Hardy Boyz ""Twist Of Fate"" DVD set, The Hardy Boyz are without a doubt one of the most popular tag teams amongst this generation of wrestling fans.  After enjoying that DVD set, I decided to go back & view their first DVD in ""Leap Of Faith.""  Keep in mind that this DVD was made in 2001 when WWE was still WWF so you'll hear comments from the likes of Edge, Christian, Lita years before the whole Matt/Lita/Edge love triangle happened along Christian leaving for TNA.  Also throughout the documentry & in the DVD extras, you'll see footage from the Hardy's personal home videos they've made throughout their life dating back to doing backyard wrestling as kids to their recent road trips as WWF superstars.

The documentry kicks off talking about the differences between the two brothers in how Matt is more serious while Jeff is carefree & unique before going into highlights & discussion of their No Mercy ladder match including a funny story of how Jeff Hardy was a ""handyman"" during the match.  Their road to the WWF was heavily profiled next from how they fell in love with wrestling during WrestleMania IV, began wrestling in their backyard as kids, working the independent circuit, and part time jobbers in WWF until they got their contracts.  Their WWF careers were chronicled next from paying dues, being put with Michael Hayes, the New Brood with Gangrel, and how the ladder match at No Mercy made them go from WWF wrestlers to WWF superstars.  The story of their mom dying from cancer & effect their father had on them is talked about before moving on to showing highlights of the WrestleMania 2000 ladder match & SummerSlam TLC match with comments from both Hardy's on various moments along with going into the effect their entrance along has on the fans to the point where Edge admits that he gets caught up in it at times when he's suppost to be in character.  Jeff Hardy's motorcross fetish is discussed next before the Hardy's show highlights & give thoughts on their Unforgiven 2000 cage match against Edge & Christian along with reviewing the whole ""Los Conquistadors"" angle before closing out the documentry talking about what's in the future for the Hardy Boyz.

Along with the documenty, came six bonus matches...
vs. WWF Tag Team Champions Acolytes - Bradshaw was playing off a concussion given to him by Kane on Heat. Real short match that saw the Hardy Boyz gain their first of many World Tag Team Championships.
""RAW"" July '99
(Also available on ""Best On RAW Vol. 1 & 2"")

Ladder Match vs. Edge & Christian - This was the match that put both teams on the map that would eventually plant the seeds for the future series of ladder/TLC matches featuring various members. Since this was the first tag team ladder match, it was non-stop action & never a dull moment.
No Mercy '99
(Also available on ""The Ladder Match"")

TLC Match vs. WWF Tag Team Champions Edge & Christian vs. Dudley Boyz - The first TLC match and this was the one that topped their WrestleMania match months earlier. Again, this is one of those matches that I can't describe in words that you just have to watch.
SummerSlam '00
(Also available on the SummerSlam Anthology & ""The Ladder Match"")

Steel Cage Match vs. WWF Tag Team Champions Edge & Christian - Jeff Hardy got knocked off the top of the cage to the outside floor early in the match leading to Christian & Edge seperating the Hardy's from each other & double teaming one while keeping the other for a majority of the match until the Hardy's were able to comeback & use the same gameplan to win the WWF Tag Team Titles.  Various highlights include Matt being double suplexed off the top of the cage, Jeff using a ladder to knock Christian outside the cage along with doing a Wisper In The Wind off the top of the cage, Hardy's doing a con-chair-to to Edge on the top of the cage who then fell backwards off, and Lita doing a frankensteiner on Christian off the ladder.
Unforgiven '00

TLC II Match vs. WWF Tag Team Dudley Boyz vs. Edge & Christian vs. Dudley Boyz - TLC II followed the same patterns as their pervious matches with the exception this time being the involvement of Lita, Rhyno, and Spike Dudley. This match has the highlight reel of Edge (off the top of the ladder) spearing Jeff Hardy (who was hanging from the belt hooks) all the way to the floor that WWE still uses in some promotional videos today.
WrestleMania X-7
(Also available on the WrestleMania Anthology & ""The Ladder Match"")

w/Lita vs. Steve Austin, Triple H, Stephanie McMahon - This was a quick 10 min. match but was fast paced between both teams with the Hardys being able to hold their own against two of the top names in the WWF.  The ladies didn't get involved until the end but the real highlight here was the aftermath where Austin & Triple H gave Lita the most vicious beating to Lita that anyone has ever seen a man give a woman in the WWF (probably wrestling period) with her being assaulted with a steel chair along with recieving the Pedigree & Stone Cold Stunner.
""RAW"" Apr. '01

In the end, the documentry was very much like the normal WWF documentry was at that time where it was around an hour long & they mostly showed highlights of your big feuds & matches with comments from others.  This is actually a good DVD to pick up along with the recent Hardy's DVD as whatever wasn't covered here was covered there (details of their backyard/independent wrestling careers, tables match with Dudleys, and everything that's happened in the years after this DVD was released) but whatever the documentry may have lacked, the DVD bonus matches certainly heavily made up for it & more so if your a big fan of the Hardy Boyz, Edge & Christian (as they're heavily featured throughout the matches & documentry), or just the performances these four can put together then I heavily recommend.",1222992000,,5864,4.61671469740634
7949721,5,B00005Q4EW,"Like in my title, this is a ""MUST OWN"" dvd for any fan of the Hardyz and or pro wrestling.  It is packed full of some great extras, including the guys old home videos (Very funny stuff)",1194220800,,185,4.0
