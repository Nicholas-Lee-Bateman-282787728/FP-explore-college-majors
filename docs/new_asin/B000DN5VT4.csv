His exceptional acting ability and positive attitude comes through to reflect his glowing character.  His Robin Hood series brings to life one of my many childhood heroes who I emulated during my youth.  I urge any parent who would like to offer their family an inspirational video series they can watch together, or entrust to their children, this Robin Hood series is one-such collection.  Richard Greene gives his all to make this series one of the all-time greats and a must for all tasteful, quality, video libraries.",1295481600,,608,4.931372549019608
8102450,2,B000DN5VT4,"I got this for my 7 and 10 year old boys who are really into Robin Hood now.  They watched the old disney movie of Robin Hood and loved it.  However, the picture in this is often very dark making it difficult to see the actors.  Also the sound is very bad.  Some of the plots are a little boring.  But I think my kids would still be okay with watching them if it was better quality.  I wanted something not so violent or fraught with sexual innuendo, which this isn't.  I just wish it was easier to watch.",1169337600,,505,4.040404040404041
8102451,5,B000DN5VT4,"With one exception we see an awful lot of Friar Tuck in these four episodes:

The Traitor; tells of three knights trusted with the delivery of Gold to King Richard but one of them has decided to turn.

The Knight who came to Dinner; introduces Sir Richard of the Lea (Ironically played by Ian Hunter who played King Richard in the Errol Flynn version). who with the help of Robin and Friar Tuck tries to save his castle. Tuck gets his dream job as a food taster.

It's worth noting that this is the alternative version of the episode featuring John Longdon as Barron Emmet as opposed to the version normally seen elsewhere featuring Frank Royd as the Abbott that comes with all of the complete sets or as seen on Youtube.  I have not seen this version available elsewhere.

The Wager; Is a pleasant story as Robin & Tuck have a wager to see if Robin can bring in more money from begging than Tuck can by praying.

The Friar's Pilgrimage; The friar is on his way to Canterbury for a Pilgrimage, Robin tags along for a stop on the way and they become involved with a Count trying to seize Lady Margaret's land. If your eyes are quick you will notice Patrick Troughton in a very fast cameo.

In all of the episodes we discover a bit about the days of Robin Hood. It's a good bit of history.

BTW It's been said that one can buy the seasons at Amazon UK, that is true to a point. The problem is they are not American format DVD'S. A dvd player is set to a particular format and can only be changed so many times. Now if you have an old player that you want to set for exclusive use for those DVD's it's worth your while. But you have to make that decision. For me, at this time it's not.

If the full seasons become available in US format, nobody will be happier than me.",1147478400,2,1767,4.2195845697329375
8102452,5,B000DN5VT4,"I purchased from Amazon.co.uk each of the four seasons of ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" - all 143 episodes - for about $20 per season.

Digital transfer was excellent and our entire family has enjoyed the series. Packaging involved sturdy plastic cases, each containing 2 DVD's, with 8 episodes per disk. I found this a great value and wanted to recommend it to others interested in the Robin Hood series.",1147219200,,406,4.8
