3773389,5,B001R4SYYM,"Rory comes out ripping for his hometown, and this video catches it all. The interactive menus are good as well. This DVD is just more evidence of the talent that the world lost when he passed. Thanks to Donal Gallagher for keeping the footage coming! For those of us too young to see Rory before he passed, this is another Gem!",1256688000,10,327,4.377049180327869

8337357,5,B001R4SYYM,"Great show from Rory. The show gives a good representation of what Rory was all about. The set presents a good mix of Gallagher tunes from ""Tattoo'd Lady"" to the Sonny Boy Williamson tune ""When My Baby She Left Me"". Two acoustic numbers are stellar by Rory, ""Out On The Western Plain"" and ""Wanted Blues"" (which showcases Rory's resonator slide guitar). The camera work is decent here providing good examples of Rory's fretwork, something that was lacking on The Irish Tour DVD. Overall a big thumbs up. Buy it now you won't be sorry.",1527292800,,533,4.680851063829787
