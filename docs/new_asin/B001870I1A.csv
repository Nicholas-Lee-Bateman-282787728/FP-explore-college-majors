8268657,4,B001870I1A,"We haven't finished watching it yet. I purchased it for a friend in a nursing home that appreciates mental stimulation, likes discussions. So far it is very interesting, we are on the second of three discs. He fatigues easily so we watch a little at a time.
I am impressed with the diversity of people Moyers is interviewing. So far he has lengthy discussions with one person at a time.
The one thing I miss so far is an interviewee who has a deep abiding relationship with God.",1394582400,,478,4.443181818181818
8268658,5,B001870I1A,"Hoo rah for Bill Moyer

His video CDs and DVDs are worth every penny.  I wanted his Faith and Reason when it was first released some years ago but at $140.00 or so it was more than I wanted to pay.  At its lower price I jumped at the chance.  This release covers some religions without the holy-holy arm waving of many such talks.  Try it.  Share it with your family and friends.  Little to no proselytizing.",1357084800,2,408,4.220779220779221

I love Bill Moyers and was recently very excited when Amazon had his Power of Myth series with Joseph Campbell newest release at a Great Price. Then when I saw this newer series with Bill Moyers entitled ""Faith and Reason"" at a great price, I ordered it and just received it and immediately started watching it. So far, it is mesmerizing. Bill Moyers is one of our greatest Journalist and his interviews seem effortless. However, he is very knowledgeable and this can be seen in his questions and interplay with the person being interviewed.

It is a must have ""collectable"" series at an extraordinary price. I was a University Administrator when educational media like this came out much more expensively than they are available now. This series is easily watched over and over again through the years. With each watch, new insights and thoughts will be very stimulating. Such is the pursuit of knowledge and ideas and the many rewards of being able to think and express as human beings. Very inspirational and reminder of our precious gifts of life and miraculous bodies including the Marvelous Brain. Please don't be afraid to exercise your body and mind regularly. The rewards are EXTRAORDINARY.

This series furthers understanding of our worldwide ""connectedness"" which is crucial to have compassion as our daily focus.  May we all continue to feel and practice daily compassion with loving/kindness. Series like this one help shed light on ideas to expand worldwide needed awareness.",1299715200,9,1578,5.104651162790698
8268660,5,B001870I1A,"It's PBS. It's learning. Enjoyable. Sophisticated topics and conversation, but a vocabulary level understandable to most. Noted writers openly sharing their faith without preaching or demanding to be followed in their choice concerning faith (if they have one.) Some opinions you may relate to while others you will question. Each segment encounter will generate your own questions. My wife and I both would ask them aloud, as though the TV images could respond. It's that engaging.

SDH SUBTITLES provided in all 7 episodes. Episodes 2 to 6 comprises two separate  hr discussions with different authors. Episode 1 and 7 each are about an hour and consist of only one interviewee. Text biographies are provided for each person Moyers talks with. Also a booklet gives episode summaries/self-questions, an explanation of PEN, statistical charts, and a multi-page explanation of `fundamentalism.'

Episode1: Salman Rushdie (India, atheist, PEN American Center Pres, author) religion & its political force
Episode 2: Mary Gordon (NYC, Catholic, author) modern martyrdom
............  Colin McGinn (UK, atheist, philosopher) Catholic turned atheist; reason not faith
Episode 3: Jeanette Winterson (UK, Pentecostal childhood, author) myth heros
............  Will Power (USA, playwright & rapper) hip-hop `flips' old to new relevance
Episode 4: Anne Provoost (Belgian, children's writer) view the Ark as seen by the drowning
............  David Grossman (Israel, Jewish, author) Samson and being `chosen people'
Episode 5: Richard Rodriguez (Mex/Amer, Catholic, author) peace facing death by prayer
............  Sir John Houghton (Wales, Evangelical, scientist) at peace with doubt and belief. His was my favorite line from the series: ""I don't know."" He must answer sometimes both as a believer and a scientist.
Episode 6: Margaret Atwood (Canada) & Martin Amis (UK), both agnostics, both write of fundamentalism without a personal faith. They are true fictionalists.
Episode 7: Pema Chodron (USA, Buddhist nun, author) calm mind; warm heart (Grace?)

An educational event for the lay person as well as those aspiring to higher levels. Non-threatening, enlightening.",1286236800,31,2162,5.671826625386997
8268661,5,B001870I1A,"Pema Chdrn is a Buddhist nun and her writings are extremely popular, and for very good reason. She has an incredible ability to describe the ineffable in simple, down-to-earth terms - a rare gift when one is discussing the transcendent. She is also a very highly regarded teacher and her teachings and writings have helped make Buddhism accessible to a lot of Westerners. All of this comes through in this wonderful interview with Bill Moyers, who could not be a more appropriate interviewer. This is wonderful, magical stuff. Highly recommended.

When I came to buy my copy, there was only one new copy available from an Amazon Marketplace seller  [...], so I went to [...] and bought it for [...] plus shipping. All of the titles from this series are available there.",1248652800,2,769,4.818181818181818
