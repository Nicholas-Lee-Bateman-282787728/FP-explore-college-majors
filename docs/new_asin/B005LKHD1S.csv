4829163,5,B005LKHD1S,"Hilarious show, but it's clogging up my DVR. We can't bring ourselves to erase it. I hope they are working on getting a US Region 1 DVD of both seasons available soon. It's a gem.",1344556800,,179,4.142857142857143
4829164,5,B005LKHD1S,"This show was slow for me to understand and pick up their nuances and accents, but once I understood what was going on I absolutely loved it. Brilliant, made me laugh out loud, Series 2 was even funnier. My husband says its like ""The Office"" (which he hates) and he is right, that is why I love it so much. I sure wish they had been able to make more of them, its a 'once in a lifetime' series for me. Can't wait until a US DVD version is made, buying it in a heartbeat.",1344038400,,470,3.957894736842105

4829167,5,B005LKHD1S,Funny show with wonderful acting.,1458518400,,33,5.8
4829168,5,B005LKHD1S,"Who knew the Lord of Downton Abbey was also a great comedic actor?!? Great idea for a really funny Mocumentary, the team in charge of the 2012 Olympics in London. Another highlight is the actress who plays the role of a dim wit and incompetent PR person. If you enjoy this then check out W1A, the Mocumentary series that follows Hugh Bonneville's character after the Olympics when he is hired to work with even more incompetents at the BBC. A hilarious follow-up series to Twenty Twelve. If you loved the British version of The Office, this is the show for you (and W1A too)!",1454544000,,575,4.538461538461538
4829169,5,B005LKHD1S,"We loved ""W1A"".  Now, it's fun to go back and watch ""Twenty Twelve"" to see where everything started.",1453075200,,100,4.555555555555555
4829170,5,B005LKHD1S,"Very funny, endearing comedy.",1452729600,,29,6.5
4829171,5,B005LKHD1S,"Same team that did W1A spoof of the BBC. I have been involved in several endeavours closely akin to the subject matter of Twenty Twelve. Encountered precisely the brand of idiocy depicted here, especially the witless wonder from the PR agency. Oh, and the episode on the bus with the visiting dignitaries and clueless driver? Been there, suffered that. Priceless.",1447027200,,363,5.066666666666666
4829172,1,B005LKHD1S,"Silly premise, uninteresting characters, lame plot",1444780800,,50,7.5
4829173,5,B005LKHD1S,Heavenly. Wish it would never end. It's like the office in America.,1443139200,,67,4.666666666666667
4829174,5,B005LKHD1S,"A hidden treasure.  This is so funny and refreshing.  Not the lame one liners as in most American comedies.  Also fortunately missing are the innuendos that all American comedies constantly throw in as if they're written by 13 year old boys.

Clever and fun.",1441152000,,258,4.795454545454546
4829175,5,B005LKHD1S,ENjoyed this - looked forward to season 2,1419552000,,41,4.25
4829176,5,B005LKHD1S,Love this series.  So glad to find it on Amazon.,1407542400,,48,3.8
4829177,5,B005LKHD1S,Disappointing and boring,1405382400,,24,7.333333333333333
4829178,3,B005LKHD1S,"Probably a good series, but the sound quality was so poor we had difficulty understanding the British accents (not crisp or clear) and we gave up after the first episode.",1397088000,,170,4.7
4829179,3,B005LKHD1S,"Did Rahm Emmanuel imitate Malcolm or vice versa, or are guys in these positions just born that way? Either way, they are true to life jerks and we deserve what we get.",1396224000,,167,4.25
4829180,2,B005LKHD1S,Very light half-hour comedy (?) shows that are of interest to British about preparations for Olympics. Series was  disappointing and really tedious -gave up watching after the third show. Definitely not worth $10.99 for season of 6.,1394928000,,232,5.27027027027027
4829181,4,B005LKHD1S,"British comedy at its best.  The comedy is understated but becomes funnier as you think about each situation.  Good acting, good story, very humorous.",1393632000,,150,5.208333333333333
4829182,2,B005LKHD1S,"I found very few of the parts funny.  Boring in many sections and rambling.  If I had to hear Jessica Hynes say ""Oh yes cool, that's cool"" again, I would have smashed my screen.  Which is a shame, because I like her and have seen her in many great parts, but not this one.  The three reasons this got 2 stars instead of 1 are Hugh Bonneville, Olivia Colman, and the narration of David Tennant.  Hugh Bonneville, the much put upon boss was great in this and his facial expressions with the things going on were priceless. Olivia Colman as the PA was the only one of the staff who knew what they were doing.  Her lovelorn crush on boss Hugh was sad and funny.  Then their is David Tennant, his narration was the funniest part of this series, and besides I would sit and listen to him speak about anything - even a telephone book.",1391472000,,827,4.262820512820513
4829183,5,B005LKHD1S,It's rare that I laugh out loud with a TV program.  Several of the episodes in this series made it happen.,1388534400,,106,4.0476190476190474
4829184,4,B005LKHD1S,Very witty take on the run-up to the 2012 Olympics. Good performances all round. Great use of jargon and observations of organizational incompetence.,1369612800,,149,5.521739130434782
4829185,5,B005LKHD1S,"To this American, there is nothing like Brit Wit and this is the best of it.  The scripts are amazing.  Tongues deeply implanted in cheeks.  Only the Brits could make impending, but minor, disasters and truly silly bureacracy so funny. You will not like all of the characters but if  you have ever worked in any sort of large business or government organization, you will recognize.them.  The wonderful writers give us permission to laugh WITH some and AT some.  Hugh Bonneville is an extraordinary actor.  I have seen him as a vicious meany, Lord Downton and now the most amazing ""rolls off his back like water off of a duck"" Boss/Comic.  Not to be missed.",1368144000,2,657,4.6521739130434785
4829186,5,B005LKHD1S,"Twenty Twelve is a hilarious sendup to London '12 Summer Olympics. It gives you, the viewer, another view of how Lord Crawley from Downton Abbey has a great acting range.  It also improves the BBC's reputation for funny(yes, funny!) comedy and drama and has the added plus of being narrated by Doctor Who's David Tennant (before Matt Smith joined the Tardis).  If you struggle to find funny drama and can't find good mockumentary drama comedy elsewhere give this series a try!",1358899200,,476,4.864197530864198
4829187,2,B005LKHD1S,I bought the first season but only viewed the first two episodes. One and two were so boring and unfunny that I have yet to get back to view the rest of the episodes that I bought. In the first two the dialog sounds like improv performed by comedians who are all having a bad day at the same time. If a line isn't witty the first time it's delivered it certainly won't improve with repetition.,1358640000,2,393,4.184210526315789
4829188,4,B005LKHD1S,Very realistic and the characters are hilarious.  Amazingly realistic and soooo funny at times.  It's nice to watch something that isn't depressing for a change.,1356048000,,161,5.4
4829189,5,B005LKHD1S,"All the elements that make great British TV are here - great writing, wonderful actors and unique story lines.  Don't be put off because it's centered on the Olypics - it's just fodder for the cannon!  It could just as easily been centered on the manufacturing of widgets and been as amusing!  I stumbled on this by accident and couldn't be more pleased to have it in my library!",1355961600,,379,4.463768115942029
4829190,5,B005LKHD1S,"My son and I were in pain we were laughing so hard!! This is the best of British humor. Still funny, even if the Olympics have already taken place.",1348185600,,147,4.103448275862069
4829191,5,B005LKHD1S,"This series is terrific from the first moment, unlike many shows that don't hit their stride for several episodes.  The cast, including Hugh Bonneville and Jessica Hynes, is terrific.  The review complaining  that this is a streaming video rather than DVD that only gave it one star should be removed! It is unfair to give the SHOW a bad review for that reason!",1347494400,5,361,4.698412698412699
4829192,5,B005LKHD1S,2012 brought some humorous insight into Olympic Games preparations for a country.  The characters developed with each episode and we laughed a lot!  Great British fun!!!,1346889600,,169,5.461538461538462
4829193,1,B005LKHD1S,"My husband and I absolutely loved watching TWENTY TWELVE on BBC America - on our television.  We want to buy the DVD set, but it is only sold for European sets.  Glad that I only bought one episode - had to watch on my computer screen.  And, we certainly would not want to watch it on anything smaller, like our I-Pad.",1346889600,,318,4.180327868852459
4829194,5,B005LKHD1S,"I love this series!  The first season shows many of the issues involved in setting up the Olympics - - whether real or created for the series.  It feels as if you are involved in every meeting, every problem they tackle.  Although everyone, except for Hugh Bonneville, was unknown to me, I quickly felt as if they were real people involved with the Olympics.  If you like British comedy, you will LOVE this series!",1346716800,,414,4.554054054054054
8478223,5,B005LKHD1S,"If you enjoy the BBC comedy W1A about the BBC (lol), then you will enjoy this precursor. Hugh Bonneville is brilliant.",1522195200,,118,4.666666666666667
8478224,5,B005LKHD1S,"If you're a fan of W1A, the BBC send-up available in 2017, you'll love this earlier program which has some of the same actors and also spoofs ""corporate culture."" You'll laugh out loud.",1514505600,,185,4.636363636363637
