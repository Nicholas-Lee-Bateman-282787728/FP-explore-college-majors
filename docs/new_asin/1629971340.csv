201850,4,1629971340,1st episode was a great intro to CBT. Would have helped to get a roadmap/overview of entire series but still very good on its own.,1462147200,,130,4.24
201851,1,1629971340,"Too long and general...teaching CBT need not be so complex.... I bet 99.99999% of the people who would buy this book are NOT under the delusion that they will begin to practice Psychiatry or Psychology at the end, but are looking for some simple understanding of their own runaway thoughts and techniques to corral them a bit.",1458345600,8,326,4.7368421052631575
201852,5,1629971340,"I think this work is structured extremely well.  I like the content, the way it is taught, and the personal style of Jason Satterfield.  I have a PH.D.  in Adult Development and Psychology and have studied much of this work, but it was a refresher for me of what I already do. It is very practical and useful as a fully integrated program in working to change thinking processes and behavior.  I would definitely recommend this.",1451865600,10,428,4.592105263157895
201853,3,1629971340,"Very long, slow, not much info.  It's basically a commercial to try and get you to buy a series of videos.  (Notice I said YOU, not me)  If you enjoy spending your time listening to someone go on and on but getting nowhere this video would be perfect for you.  To be fair he also spends a lot of time hashing and rehashing his personal educational and professional back ground.  (SNORE)  I pretty much just wanted to stab myself after 3 minutes but I gritted my teeth and watched THE WHOLE THING.  I want my 32 minutes back.",1446854400,11,524,4.285714285714286
201854,5,1629971340,Loving all these courses so far.,1478995200,,32,4.5
201855,3,1629971340,not what i thought it would be.,1478044800,,31,3.5714285714285716
201856,5,1629971340,Extremely good content!  This content can be used mainly for helping students of psychology better understand cognitive behavioral therapy.  This series is also extremely useful for patients who are currently undergoing therapy better understand their treatments and how they can get better.  This series is also valuable for people who are considering therapy and what they can get from that.,1475625600,4,393,5.516666666666667
201857,4,1629971340,Very interesting. I like the examples,1474934400,,37,5.333333333333333
201858,3,1629971340,Teaches the techniques well but the instructor makes the material very dry. It's hard to watch more than an hour at a time. You have to be very motivated to learn the material to sit through all of this.,1473292800,,203,4.230769230769231
201859,5,1629971340,"I know several people who have benefited from CBT, and now I understand why. The principles are clearly explained and it's easy to see how they can be applied to a variety of situations, whether extreme behavioral or emotional issues, or to more modest efforts at self-improvement. Every lecture includes therapy sessions to see/hear how CBT is applied in practice with patients.",1466985600,2,379,5.129032258064516
201860,3,1629971340,"First ten or so lectures is all I could handle.  I think CBT may work for some conditions where you can control your brain.  But if stop happens in the middle of the night when you are sleeping, my doctor says this CBT will not work on my medical conditions.  It is good learning how the brain works, but seeing that CBT changes guises etc every ten years during the past fifty (even if the field is evolving) does not give me the confidence that I would like to have about CBT being settled medicine and science.  It too is artful.",1463875200,,532,4.237623762376238
201861,4,1629971340,"Helpful and goes through things about CBT but the price tag can be a little intimidating for some (like me, but maybe thats just me.) If you want an intro to CBT and to supplement what you have been doing but have forgotten them, then this one will help.

I received this product at a discount in return for an honest review",1463529600,,324,4.225806451612903
201862,3,1629971340,"I thought I was getting a DVD series, however I received a set of audio CDs. This set comes with an accompanying small paperback that functions as a text and follows the lessons providing a good summary and additional sources of information. While the instructor was definitely not dry, he wasn't particularly engaging either. The series is geared towards self help. There's a lot of compelling information in this course and the self help perspective made it more interesting than a purely clinical one. However perhaps it would have been easier for me to digest had it been a DVD other than just audio. I won't say it's boring, however I found the content was difficult to stay focused on, and I love audio books so I can't attribute it solely to the format. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I depend on reviews to inform my own purchases and will always leave sincere ones, good or bad.",1463443200,5,941,4.640718562874252
201863,5,1629971340,"I purchased this item at a discount for my honest opinion.  Took awhile to motivate myself but when I did start them - I was surprisingly consumed with it.  A lot of the topics are ones I have reviewed with my company in different trainings, however, these lessons dive a bit deeper and they are great about connecting the dots with processes.  I would recommend this to someone who needs direction on how to plan and needs to understand the why behind a lot of decisions.",1462838400,3,472,4.465116279069767
7800667,5,1629971340,Great course! I love how he explains the CBT process and reinforces the ideas with various counseling sessions with clients. We get to follow these clients through their initial assessment and through their homework. This course is good for counselors as well as anyone who wants to learn the CBT model to help with life skills.,1509062400,,328,4.875
7800668,5,1629971340,get to know yourself & learn to control your own mind!  least you turn into the town drunk.,1508976000,,91,4.055555555555555
7800669,5,1629971340,"Thoroughly satisfying and informative overview of CBT.  Very useful for people wanting to work at change in their own lives, or to better understand what happens in counseling/therapy, apart from the media depictions.  With recorded sessions demonstrating the application of the theory and techniques,  Dr. Satterfield exemplifies the empathy and compassion, hope and positive regard that underlie good therapy regardless the theoretical model.  I have found it a good resource for counselor supervision and for clients, the course linking to many useful tools on-line.
Thanks.",1506038400,,577,5.752941176470588
7800670,4,1629971340,"In the Great Course, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Jason Satterfield does a good job providing an overview of the CBT field.  Each lecture is comprised of  information about some aspect of CBT like Stress and Coping, Anxiety and Fear, Treating Depression, etc.  He illustrates how CBT is actually used by showing us his meetings with three of his patients.  The first patient has anxiety issues, the second has problems with anger management, and the third patient is depressed because she is dealing with a very sick husband.

These patients show up in each of the 24 lectures.  Dr. Satterfield applies the information he has discussed in his lecture to these actual patient problems.  For me, this was the best part of this Great Course.  I was impressed with Dr. Satterfields ability to involve each of his patients in the problem solving process of learning to use CBT techniques to heal themselves.  He asks relevant questions, listens carefully to the answers he receives often paraphrasing them to be sure he has understood correctly what his patients are telling him.  He uses a whiteboard to write important points made in the discussion to create a visual record of the work he and his patients are accomplishing.  Lastly, he gives his patients assignments to complete that are thoughtful and appropriate and apply CBT information to the patients problems.

Dr. Satterfield discusses other options in the treatment of his patients problems and the success rate for each of the interventions.  For example, drugs like Prozac and Lexapro are commonly used to treat anxiety and depression.  Dr. Satterfield is careful not to rule out drugs and includes them as one possible option in a well thought out treatment plan.  That said, CBT seems like a better option to avoid drug dependency if the patient is amenable to such treatment.

Readers of this review should know that this course is not meant to be a means of treatment for people with various psychological problems.  In this course Dr. Satterfield demonstrates how CBT might work with people with various mental health issues and discusses meeting with a competent health care professional to discuss the best course of treatment to begin the healing process.

As mentioned in the beginning of this review, I thought Dr. Satterfields lectures were well prepared and thoughtful, but more useful to me was his actual work with the three patients he included in all of his lectures.  In the hands of a competent professional like Dr. Satterfield, CBT can be a genuinely useful means of helping people overcome various psychological problems.",1503878400,,2603,5.053864168618267
7800671,5,1629971340,"This series is an excellent  primer for student counselors/therapists who are new to CBT.  I spent a great deal of time looking for a video that could provide client therapist interactions that were real, and not just students practicing techniques.  These videos provide what appears to be real clients in a real sessions.  If they are actors, they are very convincing.  This series really breaks down the nuts and bolts of CBT and was very helpful to me.",1502582400,,456,4.794871794871795
7800672,4,1629971340,"I had not known what CBT entailed. With this overview in Episode 1, I now have a good working idea. Clearly presented.",1501718400,,118,4.409090909090909
7800673,5,1629971340,"This is for the series of CBT ""how to"" training and explanations. The whole series is well presented, clear, and examples are provided throughout. Due to ethics, I imagine the cases are role plays, but they were pretty realistic from my experience. I would have liked to see some examples for clients that have more severe difficulties such as psychosis or cognitive deficits. Overall I felt it was a good use of my time and worth the money for the whole series.",1487548800,5,462,4.646341463414634

7800675,2,1629971340,was not helpful and I was apparently to late for returning. Would be good for professors of psychology,1481328000,,102,4.722222222222222
7800676,2,1629971340,"Interesting stuff, but more for a class than the amateur exploring psychology.",1479600000,,78,5.583333333333333
