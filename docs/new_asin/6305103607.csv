Mind you, I have a LOVE of the lurid hodgepodge of genres that some of those  Brit ""horror"" films were. This is camp and cheese and still quite  enjoyable.

967668,3,6305103607,"I've been a fan of this movie since I saw it late one night on TV years ago.  Now the DVD is available.  The transfer is coarse - looks like somebody filmed a projected 16mm print, but it's good enough.

The old british bikes are great, the scenes are funny - especially the grocery store demolition, and George Sanders as the butler is great - evil, spooky, tall, cool, lean and pompous.  If Dracula was a British butler, this is what he would look and sound like.

The ending is tremendous.  Filmed from some distance, George Sanders gets out of an old Rolls limo wearing a long cape in a stiff breeze, and walks over to the seven sisters (a Stonhenge-like rock structure), all the while with a Black Sabbath-esque music groove going.  It is an eerie and very cool synthesis of the occult, Britishness and doom metal, I can A-B that short scene over and over as it is very well done outro to the movie.",1315353600,,904,4.377245508982036
967669,4,6305103607,"A troublesome bike gang called The Living Dead (with skull designs on their helmets to boot), wreck havoc on the roadways. Their ideas of fun include running mothers with baby carriages off the sidewalk and playing chicken with unsuspecting drivers who crash through the windshield afterwards. You know, to kill some time. Yet, for gang leader Tom, time in human life expectancy terms is way too short. Lucky for him he has a mum that made a deal with the Devil years ago that includes assured life after death. Rest assured, after Tom ends a police chase by going off a bridge into the river, his following burial in the ground of the Seven Witches (a mini Stonehenge of sorts) will not be his final resting place. Nor will it be the last suicide among Living Dead members.

967672,4,6305103607,"There's copies of this out there on vhs which contain the entire movie and are in pretty good condition. If you can find it, the Euroshock Collection disc - now sadly discontinued - also contains the entire movie. This version, which appears to be sourced from two different prints, is well worth snapping up even though a short sequence containing a seance which reveals quite a bit of background info about three of the films most important characters has been left out - presumably due to damage of the prints used (?) other than that its still a great movie. In fact I think its safe to say that its the only British Biker Zombie movie - with the possible exception of the terrible I Bought A Vampire Motorcycle (itself being a spin-off from British tv series Boon) and therefore should need no more description.
Also of interest, if you can find them, would be Dead of Night, The Sorcerers, Witchfinder General, The Wicker Man, Death Line, Captain Kronos Vampire Hunter, Blood on Satans Claw and the strangely erotic Vampyres. British horror movies weren't all about the Bray studios output and Psychomania is a great example.

967673,3,6305103607,"Here's another ghost from my misspent youth returning to haunt me!  It's still a hoot after all these years.  A gang of bikers discovers the secret of eternal life.  The catch is, you have to kill yourself.  Not only that, but you have to believe that you are coming back so much so that you actually want to die.  A bit tricky, no doubt, but all in a day's work for these renagade hooligans.  I love the scene where the gang buries Tom, their leader.  As flowers are strung together and everyone is serenaded with a groovy hippie tune, old Tom sits astride his bike in a shallow hole like some crazy wax dummy.  I would think that the hole would only allow him to be buried up to his neck - imagine the picnics that would be ruined by a the sight of a dead biker's head sticking out of the ground! Before long though, Tom returns from the dead and, after roaring out of his grave like a poster boy for Meatloaf's next album, is off on his mission to live (un)life to the fullest & to recruit his fellow gang members.  Not surprisingly, most follow along.  The sole exception is Abby, Tom's girlfriend whom we all know is not so bad because she only enjoys the gang's wild antics to a point.  Yes, she'll help cause an accident that probably killed the other driver but, to return from the dead...?  A girl's got to have limits!  I'd like to think that if I were to return from the dead, I, too, would spend my time zooming down the highway like a maniac, killing anyone who looked at me sideways, & harassing old truck drivers by calling them Father Christmas.  The truck driver's retort is priceless: ""Stupid Kids!  Stupid kids!""  Yep, this movie is pretty crazy but, to tell the truth, I still like it.  It retains a kind of clunky charm and the soundtrack (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Psychomania/dp/B00009EFVF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Psychomania</a>) is killer.

967783,5,6305103607,"I bought this movie for 2 reasons.  The main one is that I ride old Triumphs and any time I hear about a movie from the 60s or 70s with bikes in it, I always try to get a copy to see if there are any Triumphs.  The other reason is because my boss told me that this movie has some excellent riding in it.  I sell motorcycles for a living, so we're always talking bikes... what a find this was.

I didn't have super high hopes about this movie, because 1. it's called ""Psychomania"" which is cheesy at best, and 2. it's a motorcycle movie made in the early 70s - enough said.  Nothing against these types of movies, but most of them have utterly miserable production value, the story is always the same for some reason, and the bikes in them are always ratty and junky looking.

Boy was I in for a surprise...

The bikes in this movie were all Triumphs and BSAs, and are some of the nicest ones I've ever seen outside the confines of a bike show.  They aren't all chopped, bobbed, or otherwise junked up like the bikes in all the other movies from this era.  That alone made this movie worth the purchase price.

In addition, the production quality was pretty decent, and although the storyline of the typical evil biker gang was in place, the twist of being able to come back from the dead if you just believe that you will was interesting.  Not sure what all the frog imagery was about though.  And I thought it was pretty hilarious that whenever they wreck their bikes and come back from the dead, their bikes are good as new also... haha when the guy rides through the brick wall and the bike has no damage, that's classic.

Anyway, buy this movie.

For under $10, this was a great purchase, and since the main reason I bought it was for the bikes, it certainly delivered.",1203033600,3,1773,4.285285285285285

967788,4,6305103607,"From Elite Entertainment's Euroshock Collection comes the film Psychomania (1971) aka The Death Wheelers, a curious feature that followed the tail end of the motorcycle genre popularized in the mid to late 1960s (Amazon indicates the film released in 1974, but I suspect that was when it was released in America, as I believe it was originally released in England in 1971).  Directed by Australian Don Sharp (The Kiss of the Vampire, Curse of the Fly, The Face of Fu Manchu), the film features Nicky Henson (Vampira), whom fans of the British television series ""Fawlty Towers"" will most likely recognize given he was prominently featured in a 1979 episode titled `The Psychiatrist' as the character Mr. Johnson (he played a swinger of sorts who snuck a chippie into Basil's hotel claiming it was his mother).  Also appearing is Mary Larkin (The Razor's Edge), Ann Michelle (House of Whipcord), Robert `Cornelius Fudge' Hardy (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets), Beryl Reid (Dr. Phibes Rises Again), and George Sanders (The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, A Shot in the Dark).  Appearing in a bit part is John Levene, best known to `Dr. Who' fans as the character Corporal/Sergeant/RSM Benton from the long running series.

The film opens with a groovy, instrumental tune played against a slow motion motorcycle montage used as a backdrop for the opening credits.  After this we meet a young mop head named Tom (Henson), the anarchistic, death obsessed leader of a coed motorcycle gang known as The Living Dead.  Members of the gang include Tom's main squeeze Abby (Larkin), Jane (Michelle), Hatchet, Chopped Meat, Hinky, Bertram, and one or two others.  Learning their names wasn't difficult, especially since they're spelled out in large letters upon their jackets, which, I must say, made them seem about as threatening as that gang of hoods Ritchie Cunnigham and his friends crossed in the television show ""Happy Days"", and needed the Fonz to save their cheese by the end episode.  Anyway, Tom has gotten the notion it's possible to come back from the great beyond, most likely from his mother Mrs. Latham (Reid), who holds sances, and her butler Shadwell (Sanders), who appears exceptionally well versed in all things occult.  Turns out there is a way, and it somehow involves a mysterious, locked room in Mrs. Latham's house, the same room Tom's father had ventured into some eighteen years earlier and never returned (um, okay).  Tom enters the room and some weirdness follows involving a smoky mirror, some visions, and a...frog.  The next day Tom and his cohorts set out to blow some minds, eventually leading up to a chase with the police and Tom launching himself off a bridge and ending up all dead and such...or is he?  Apparently not, as a few days later, after a unorthodox memorial service, Tom rises from the dead with some strange, new powers, and is now intent on sharing the secret of his return with his friends as you see, once you die, you can't die again...

This was definitely one of the more peculiar films I've seen in a while, and I suppose that's probably why I enjoyed it as much as I did...from the outset there's difficulty in seeing where the story is going as the path is often muddled and frustratingly indistinct at times, and often open to a good deal of interpretation (I'm still in the dark with regards to the aspects of the story involving the frog).  The film is listed in the horror genre, but one should know there's absolutely no blood and very little violence, although quite a few people do die throughout the feature (most all of the deaths are of the off screen variety).  My favorite part of the film comes after Tom returns and starts convincing his friends to kill themselves (and they do, in various ways), if only so that they may share in the benefits acquired once one returns from the beyond.  I won't detail the secret provided in the film of how to return from the dead, but know it doesn't seem all that difficult as long as you have a certain amount of faith.  While the story does involve characters returning from the dead, this doesn't involve them becoming flesh eating zombies or anything like that.  The characters are as they were before they passed, only now they seem to have a great deal more strength and lack any of the fears they possessed while living.  Another great bit comes as Tom's friends, after his death, request from his mother to bury him in their own fashion, one that includes digging a hole in a field and placing Tom, atop his motorcycle, in full motorcycle gear, into the ground (this, of course, sets up a memorable bit once Tom returns from the dead and blasts his way out of the ground on his motorcycle).  As far as the performances go there really wasn't much there, but in terms of a film like this they capable.  A note of interest... George Sanders, who appeared in this film, took his own life about a year after the film was released, but, unlike the characters in this film, he did not come back (as far as I know), so either he didn't follow the path detailed in the film, or maybe he did and it just didn't work, you know, because this is just a movie.  All in all I thought this a fun film, but then I'm partial to oddball features from the 1970s.

Seems there's a couple of DVD releases out there for this film, but the one I own is the Image Entertainment release, which appears to be out of print at the time of this review.  The picture, presented in the original theatrical ratio of 1.66:1, looks decent enough, but minor signs of age are present from time to time.  The clarity of the picture looks slightly dingy, but I've seen a lot worse.  The Dolby Digital mono audio, available in both English and Spanish, comes across well.  There are absolutely no extras on the disc, but chapter stops are provided.  There's another, inexpensive DVD release out there from a company by the name of Geneon [Pioneer], but I haven't seen that release so I can't comment on the quality, but I suspect it probably isn't as good.

967789,5,6305103607,"This film is one of my all-time favorites... There's just something about it that's so deliciously kooky it's completely priceless. It's the very definition of a cult film - it's certainly not for everyone, but those who love it love it with a passion. For me, it's part of a small group of films (including the likes of 'The Abominable Dr Phibes', 'The Omega Man', and the 'The Asphyx') that I saw on late-night TV many years ago and have loved ever since.

It's a virtually bloodless, blackly comic journey into the bizarre that concerns the leader of a gang of bikers - prophetically named The Living Dead - who discovers that the secret of eternal life is to commit suicide in a state of mind of absolute conviction that you will return. Once a couple of members of the gang pull this trick off, and quite literally become the living dead, the rest of the gang kiss their doubts (and their mortality) goodbye in a suicide free-for-all that's as amusing as it is inventive.

Throw in black magic, frog-worship, stone circles, Beryl Reid (!), an undead biker leaping from the grave bike and all, and the devil himself ... and you have the ingredients of a film like no other that's a genuine-article cult item.

And finally, there's the soundtrack - an unforgettable dose of psychedelia without which the film just wouldn't be same and might even not work at all, it's that integral to the atmosphere. The recurrent riff that runs through the film is every bit as much a part of the 'feel' of the movie as anything that's on the screen. The thundering bass-line, towering minor-key organ chords, and funky 70's wakka-wakka guitar riffs are more than just the icing on the cake.

Fans of the film's soundtrack may be interested to know that is available on CD in the UK, released 2003 on the Trunk Records label. Head on over to Amazon.co.uk and you'll find it there. :)

The film's only on DVD in the US and the soundtrack's only available in the UK - go figure - but hopefully one day there'll be a Special Edition of this film which includes the soundtrack as a bonus disc.

967863,4,6305103607,"The much ballyhooed biker film genre is one I rarely, if ever, visit on my cinematic excursions. I have never seen more than ten minutes of ""Easy Rider,"" nor have I witnessed Marlon Brando donning the leather jacket and rebellious attitude in ""The Wild One."" Forget ""Quadrophenia"" or even Herschell Gordon Lewis's ""She-Devils on Wheels."" If it's got a guy throwing caution to the wind on the back of a hog, I have not been there to witness it. The closest I get to a motorcycle movie is when I happen to catch a James Bond film where guys on bikes try to chase down 007. Heck, I can't stand watching that motorcycle show on television where the blowhard screams at his sons all day. That is why I am so surprised I not only rented ""Psychomania"" but also liked it immensely as well. Here's a movie every lover of low budget cinematic sludge can fully endorse. Here's a movie loaded with ugly guys sporting atrocious haircuts zipping around the highway. Here's a movie where reanimated biker gang members can ride through a brick wall without putting a scratch on their choppers. Here's a movie with characters named Hatchet and Chopped Meat. What are you waiting for?

The Living Dead is the name of the game in a small English village as far as threatening motorcycle gangs go. An equal opportunity employer, the group includes both men and women in their reigns of terror throughout the countryside. What do they do? Oh, just your everyday harmless antics like chasing cars off the road, buzzing pedestrians, and speaking bad English. The leader of the gang is Tom (Nicky Henson), a goofy chap with a psychic mother and no father figure. His girlfriend Abby (Mary Larkin) provides a few kicks when fellow member Jane (Ann Michelle) isn't trying to muscle in. Tom's greatest thrill isn't his girlfriend, however, but trying to figure out a way to live on the wild side. Thanks to his mother (Beryl Reid) and their aging butler Shadwell (George Sanders), he's about to do just that. Mum is part of some frog cult (!) that vigorously promotes the idea that anyone may return from the dead if only he or she wishes to hard enough. You've got to be careful that you don't change your mind at the last minute, though, or you won't ever return. Tom's father apparently wasn't sure, probably because he remembered his son's haircut at the last second and decided he couldn't take coming back to that, but Tom is all for trying out the secrets of the frog cult.

Tom, sad to say, moves on to another plane of existence after soaring off a bridge during a police chase. His friends gather at the gravesite for a truly poignant and memorable service, with the high point being the acoustic version of ""Ride Free"" played with all due seriousness. Tom's demise crushes Abby, but hope blooms anew as her beau bursts out of the ground alive and kicking on his motorcycle! It worked! He goes on a rampage through the town, killing several people who just happen to irritate him, and then begins to pester the other members of the group to commit the final act. Most of his pals take him up on the offer, dispatching themselves through a variety of methods including skydiving without a parachute, diving into the river weighted down with chains, and taking a freefall out of a tall building while calling out to a police officer below ""I'll be right down."" Abby even attempts to join Tom's brand new version of The Living Dead by taking a heavy dose of pills, but her heart isn't really in it and she survives with the help of the authorities. The cops, mystified why a few deceased gang members killed morgue personnel and then walked out of the building, put pressure on Abby to bring down the group. ""Psychomania"" ends with a series of spectacularly cheesy special effects.

It's rare to see a movie as ridiculous and over the top as ""Psychomania."" It's also rare to enjoy a movie as ridiculous and over the top as ""Psychomania."" But enjoy it I did. I can't decide which I liked better, the motorcycle gang or Tom's mother and the creepy butler Shadwell. I probably should go with the former since we spend the most time following their exploits. I howled with laughter watching these dolts tool around the countryside while wearing little skull shaped masks. You'd think they would know that blocking their peripheral vision could result in an accident, but even if they did they wouldn't care. Part of being in a motorcycle gang is learning how to live life on the edge. Besides, those haircuts are more dangerous than any riding mishap! It's truly amazing to see how society defined bad behavior even a few decades ago. Nowadays we have to worry about all manner of depraved behaviors. Indeed, you only need open your newspaper to see the latest list of atrocities committed right outside our homes. In ""Psychomania"" the worst behavior seems to be speeding, nudging cars off the road, and being disrespectful to private property. Sure, things worsen after the gang comes back from the grave, but that's only because it's a crime against God and humanity.

I'm a tad disappointed in the DVD. There weren't any extras, and the picture quality was truly dreadful. You'd figure a laugh a minute schlockfest like this would receive the five star treatment from a company like Blue Underground or Anchor Bay, especially considering master thespian George Sanders starred in it. Sadly, the actor took his life a year or so after ""Psychomania"" was unleashed on the public. Despite this tragic turn of events, I dare you to despise this film. It's too much fun to really dislike it.",1104364800,10,5564,4.691914022517912
967864,4,6305103607,"Ah, wait a minute....there isn't any such genre; this movie is one of a kind!  How could I say no to a film with the plot premise:  zombie biker gang terrorizes small town's inhabitants.  To be far to the lack of quality in the movie, I didn't so much as love this film as I was fascinated by the sheer weirdness--the back acting, the occult counter-culter plot, and oh yes, the bad acting!  As the Amazon review for this film pointed out, Psychomania avoids the extremes of any particular theme:  it isn't particularly scary (there is no blood whatsoever), it isn't all that violent (there is lots of riding around, but that's all Tom and his gang seem to do--there is, however, a great scene where Jane (a gorgeous Ann Michelle), one of the biker members, mows over a baby carriage [that kid's going to be bitter when it grows up!]); you sure don't get much in the line of social commentary either--in fact the morality of Tom and the gang's actions isn't never directly addressed at all--so cautionary tale it is not!  The believability factor is pretty extreme also.  Hatchet's suicide onto the freeway should have left him a barely recognizable scrape, but lo and behold, he's in the morgue perfectly intact; ditto for the skydiver biker--eeeyouch!  he wasn't even dented!  As for the occult, it would've been nice to have had five minutes more of exposition devoted to the source of that frog cult or have a little more light shed onto Shadwell's identity.  Still it's probably best not to look too far into these kinds of movies.  Interestingly, some of the talent cast have been in many other films.  As another reviewer pointed out, Nicky Henson was in many other films (I saw Conquorer Worm awhile ago, but don't remember him).  I happen to be a huge Doctor Who fan, so I recognized John Levine and Beryl Reid from those shows.  If you are a fan of the biker horror genre, then by all means go see Werewolves On Wheels as it has many of the same elements:  the cheesy song halfway through, the surly biker gang, the nonsensical plot, and an ending even more bizarre than this movie's.

It's all done with a droll British manner, and is perhaps tongue-in-cheek, but it simply isn't funny enough to really care. There's a reason why movies like this were shown on late night TV - they put most people to sleep!",1080950400,5,539,4.625
967866,4,6305103607,"Psychomania (Don Sharp, 1971)
Perhaps the most amusing thing about Psychomania is that it wasn't the first film with that title (a previous film about an axe murderer called Psychomania was released in 1964. The two are completely unrelated).
Avengers TV series director and veteran horror-film helmsman Don Sharp get behind the camera for this tale of a biker gang called The Living Dead. One wonders how, exactly, a town as small as the one in the film could sustain a biker gang, but there you go. Tom (Nicky Henson of The Conqueror Worm, There's a Girl in My Soup, etc.), the gang's leader, is almost too stereotypical for words; rich kid gone bad after catching a case of terminal hippie-dom. (Because, after all, all hippies are bikers.) Tom's mother (veteran TV and film actress Beryl Reid) and her sinister butler Shadwell (George Sanders, the voice of Shere Khan in The Jungle Book, in one of his last screen appearances) are members of an odd cult of frog worshippers who believe they know the secret to coming back from the dead, something they're quite anxious to keep from Tom. Or so we're led to believe. But he manages to trick it out of them...
To call this movie ""cheesy"" would be understating the case in a major way. When two people commit suicide by jumping to their deaths--one via skydiving!--they're not going to show up in the morgue all in one piece. And yet, through the magic of filmmaking, they do. Lovely. Amusing little goofs like that are scattered throughout the film. And yet, somehow, Psychomania is one of the good bad films, rather than one of the bad bad films. Perhaps it's Nicky Henson's charm. Perhaps, in hindsight, it's playing ""spot the bike gang member"" (one of them has been in about half the James bond films, always uncredited, always playing a different walk-on character; two others are Shakespearean actors; etc.). Perhaps it's wondering how Don Sharp got George Sanders and Beryl Reid to take these roles seriously. Perhaps it's just the oddly catchy ""Riding Free,"" which drifts through the movie like the wind. Who knows? In any case, this is one of those rare bad films with entirely too much rewatch value for its own good.
Unfortunately, like most of the other Euroshock Collection DVDs I've encountered, this one comes with a dearth of special features (and it looks as if the film was simply transferred without any cleanup being done from a degraded master, just like Oasis of the Zombies). I know there aren't nearly enough fans of movies like this to make a major restoration project worth anyone's while, but it would have been nice to see it as a labor of love. In any case, if you've never seen Psychomania, now's your chance; don't miss it. ***  (lost half a star for the lackluster DVD presentation.)",1074038400,4,2765,4.748440748440748
967867,4,6305103607,"I don't know what it is about Psychomania, but I'll be doggoned if I didn't enjoy this movie.  This low-budget motorcycle gang horror movie made at the hands of one-time Hammer director Don Sharp looks rather cheesy, revolves around a rather porous storyline, and comes up empty in the special effects department, but it works for some reason.  I hate biker movies, but this one is just kooky enough to capture my attention.  Tom is not your typical motorcycle gang leader, and The Living Dead is not your typical motorcycle gang.  These crazy kids like to hang out and motor around the local cemetery sporting their ridiculous skeleton-like helmets, taking periodic breaks to run drivers off the roads and to terrorize the local community.  Tom himself lives in a grand manor house, though, with his s&eacute;ance-conducting medium mother and an ever-present serving man named Shadwell.  Tom is somewhat obsessed with death, always asking his mother how to come back from the dead.  He has now finally been given the key to the manor's mysterious locked room, the room in which his father died mysteriously eighteen years earlier.  This is a scene that is never really explained, but soon Tom has learned the answer to the question he has been asking.  It turns out that all you need to do to come back from the dead is to believe wholeheartedly that you will do so while you kill yourself.  He actually manages to pull the whole thing off, and the new and even more dangerous Tom soon has the whole gang committing suicide in various ways in order to really live up to the gang's name.
Naturally, such goings-on do not take place without the devil's full knowledge, and ignorance of a debt does not preclude the devil from making his clients pay for their wrongs.  The truly awful special effects put a real damper on an already less than exciting ending, but the devil and I seem to be fairly happy with the overall results.  The man downstairs seems to have quite a penchant for frogs, by the way, but this is just another aspect of the film that is never really explained.  As long as you don't take this film seriously and prepare yourself for some plot elements that go AWOL along the way, Psychomania is quite capable of providing you with an hour and a half of strangely satisfying, albeit rather lame, entertainment.",1072137600,6,2326,4.713580246913581

7883198,5,6305103607,"PSYCHOMANIA (aka: THE DEATH WHEELERS- 1973) is the cheery tale of a gang of bratty bikers called THE LIVING DEAD, and their infantile leader, Tom Latham (Nicky Henson). Growing dreadfully bored w/ the hum-drum world of anti-social thuggery, Tom decides to delve into the realm of occultism in order to gain immortality for himself and his trouble-making turd brigade. Luckily, his mum (Beryl Reid) is a medium, and their butler, Shadwell (George Sanders- VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED), just might be more than he appears to be- hope you guessed his name. So, Tom attains a toad talisman, gets a crash coarse in his diabolical family history, and gathers the gang together. After a day of murder and mindless mayhem, including a game of baby-pram-pinball, Tom takes the final plunge, literally. This leads to Tom's motorcycle-riding-resurrection scene, which must be witnessed to be fully appreciated! Tom even has his own hippie-dippy theme song! You haven't lived until you've seen bikers weaving flower wreathes, and wearing crocheted vests! The next thing you know, undead Tom's killing innocent pub patrons, and spreading the gospel of topping one's self to his still-warm comrades. In no time, their out finding novel ways to croak, like driving through a truck, or tossing themselves into the drink, covered in battleship chains! The gang names are rad! There's Hinky, Hatchet, Gash, Chopped Meat, and, of course, Bertrem! One member, named Abby (Mary Larkin), is a hold out. She's a real drag, man! With or without her, the others have tasted the good life... er, death, and Tom's got big plans for the law abiding living! Just wait until they visit the local grocery store! Is that another pram?
