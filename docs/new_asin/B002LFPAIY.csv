8372628,4,B002LFPAIY,"First off, let me state that the synopsis provided is mistaken on many counts, but we have only MYA to blame, as this is what`s stated on the back of the DVD cover. I`m getting weary of trashing MYA releases for retitling, repackaging, regurgitating without remastering, recklessly releasing films without any extras, improperly stating aspect ratios (this is one of them), etc.  The story is solid, the performance given by Virna Lisi ('How To Murder Your Wife') is fabulous (she won an award for it), and the other actors (always liked Tony Franciosa) are all more than competent, and this is much more than the sleazy exploitation it`s being touted as. That said, the noteworthy nubile physical attributes of Clio Goldsmith and Barbara De Rossi do elevate the quotient of exploitation considerably, but a few of the nude scenes appear to be edited (again, blame MYA). But eye-candy abounds, so don`t be discouraged, if that`s why you`re interested.  Now, back to bashing MYA - the picture is grainy at times, the colors washed out, some scenes are too dark and without contrast, no effort to find a decent print to release, no attempt at remastering, the subtitles are full of grammatical errors, it`s in full screen and not the 1.77:1 aspect ratio stated on the cover. On the plus side, at least it`s in Italian w/ subs and not horribly dubbed like most releases, and there`s a poster gallery. Too bad Severin or Synapse didn`t release it instead...",1268784000,11,1453,4.854838709677419
