8394540,4,B003CWRKSS,"If you are a railfan of the San Jose area, this video is for you. However, despite the title ""San Francisco Bay Area Rails, Featuring the South Bay"", there is very litle on the railways in northern Santa Clara County. Perhaps this is nit-picking, but I was hoping to see some of the rail stations in Palo Alto, Mountain View and Menlo Park. That said, the video is well produced and is a good addition to my collection of railroad videos.",1348272000,,438,4.419753086419753
