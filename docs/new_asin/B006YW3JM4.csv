8582777,4,B006YW3JM4,What a great series on DVD.  I especially love the complete teaching guides for my students.  The London Philharmonic Orchestra performing some of the great works with explanations is invaluable.  I can also use the two bonus programs with my early grade students as a fun way to introduce them to music and the orchestra instruments.,1490227200,,334,4.928571428571429
