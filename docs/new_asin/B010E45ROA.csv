7310402,5,B010E45ROA,"The Origin of Flight was the winning disk in this set. Astonishing photography, has all my visitors in awe. And boy is the 3D amazing on my 78 inch Samsung 4K set with its active shutter system. A shame Samsung has withdrawn from offering 3D TVs. Anyway, if you love nature stuff and love 3D, this is as good as it gets, or at least the flight disk is. The visit to the British Natural History museum disk in this set was just so-so.",1485129600,5,433,4.166666666666667

7310404,5,B010E45ROA,"Having seen these on TV in 2D, the 3D versions were mind-blowing. As long-time 3D buffs, we consider this some of the best technical quality 3D we've seen and the content, of course, is marvellous. Although the story-telling in the penguin video isn't always quite convincing, it's a sweet way to hang an wild-life movie. All three are very good viewing.",1476316800,11,354,4.819672131147541

8722192,4,B010E45ROA,"Two of the DVDs are great.
""The conquest of the skies"" was our favorite of the three.
""The Penguin King"" was also great.

The ""Alive 3D"" was cheesy and boring.  We didn't even watch the entire DVD.
If you can find them for sale separately save some money and skip the Alive 3D.",1512518400,,277,4.2075471698113205
8722193,5,B010E45ROA,"Finally a reason to use my 3D TV again!!

While this isn't quite as interesting a collection as the other volume, it's still excellent and 5-star worthy.  I love Attenborough's voice and I love BBC's take on nature documentaries.  They're the gold standard, no ifs ands of buts.  The use of 3D is excellent and really pulls you in.  No flicker or jarring layer pop-in here.

Beautiful movies, beautiful 3D effects, and a reason to dust off those 3D glasses from 4-5 years ago.  It looks even better in the Playstation VR helmet, which is now my preferred way to watch 3D bluray content on my PS4.",1512000000,5,596,4.514018691588785

8722195,5,B010E45ROA,"David Attenborough does it again.  All 3 are good.  My favorites was ""The Penguin King"".  ""Conquest of the Skies"" was very instructive.  For Darwin fans (?) the Galapagos was instructive and poignant especially in respect to the giant tortoises.",1489968000,3,245,5.205128205128205
