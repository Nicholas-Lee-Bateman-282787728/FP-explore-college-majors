4374229,5,B004GTVU7S,"If I missed the boat and didn't own the original DVD's and Box sets (which I do) And didn't want to pay a ton of ""earth monies"" on the secondary market, this would be Ideal.

But any filthy earth monkey can clearly see.......ZIM WILL NEVER DIE!

( It will just take another 5 zillion years for the masses to catch up to the brilliance of ZIM!!!)",1296432000,3,345,4.212121212121212
4374230,1,B004GTVU7S,"As I understand it, this DVD is an experiment to see if there are enough people willing to pay for a Zim DVD to warrant a revival of the show. The only problem being that there are already millions of people who have every episode on this set on one of the two whole series sets that have been released already, there is no reason for a hardcore fan to own this DVD except that NICK says that they might bring back the show. As an owner of the original DVD set, I really can't really justify paying for this item, not with my income, and I can see many other fans having this problem.
If you do have the disposable income, and especially if you don't have the series dvds, then seriously buy this, because a shot at a renewal is so sweet. My low score is for the idea behind the DVD, not for the quality of the product, I havn't seen the DVD, nor do I know what episodes are on it, though for all of you who don't have the dvds already, I'm sure they are awesome, they are all awesome.",1296432000,16,985,4.056410256410256
4374231,5,B004GTVU7S,"If you don't get this, all will be lost! The hope of getting new Invader Zim episodes, and the sake of humanity! Get this or Zim will destroy all of your little worm-baby souls!  Get this to help Invader Zim to come back!",1296345600,5,221,4.1395348837209305
4374232,5,B004GTVU7S,"Nickelodeon tried to give Invader Zim a chance by bringing it back in March 2010 to see if it would get high ratings, but that went down the tube. Now, thanks to Operation: Head Pigeons, Nick is giving us one more chance to bring new episodes for Invader Zim, with this DVD, Operation Doom. We have to spread this around as much as possible if we EVER want this series to return with new episodes. So, if you like this show, then buy the DVD, so we can get new episodes on Nick!!!",1295654400,4,480,4.172043010752688
4374233,5,B004GTVU7S,"This opportunity is most definitely worth the money and the wait. I recently discovered just how much I LOVE this series and it has rapidly become one of my all-time favorites. It would be a shame (and a huge letdown for thousands) for them to decide against creating new episodes. With the purchase of this DVD, we are collectively showing our love for the series and the desire for more.",1295568000,5,389,4.571428571428571
4374234,5,B004GTVU7S,Invader Zim was canciled in 2001? And yet its fan base is still in the thousands after 9 years! Even if you own the DVD series or think this is just NICKS attempt to get more money out of you PLEASE BUY THIS DVD... Its worth a shot what is thier to lose? 20 dollars? thats not much! And if it really does bring Zim back with new episodes wouldn't the meesly 20 dollars be worth it?!?!?!! I think so...,1295222400,43,401,4.025
4374235,5,B004GTVU7S,"I was on my iPod one night and I heard about Operation: Head Pigeons. I had absolutely no idea what it was but after some research I found out that it's a group to help promote Invader Zim getting back on air by getting Nickelodeon to sell this DVD. And if it sells well, then they will bring the show back on air. So I looked around and many many sites all say the same thing. So it can't be a hoax. So I immediately broke out my credit card and ordered this! I really can't wait! I already have all the episodes that I bought from iTunes, but this DVD isn't about the episodes. It's about bringing the show back! So please, if you're an Invader Zim fan, please buy this! It's pretty cheap, and it will get the show back on air!",1294790400,19,729,4.069444444444445

He and our sons sit and watch it and enjoy it and bond so how could i possibly complain?
