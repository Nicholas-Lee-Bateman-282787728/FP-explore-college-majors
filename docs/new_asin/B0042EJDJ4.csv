4249559,5,B0042EJDJ4,"This series gives you the information to view in amazement the sky we live in. You will see the great unknown in a form you never imagined. We are such a small spec in both time and space and we will never get to visit the outer reaches beyond earth no matter how long we live. This series can take you there and show you how it all happened. It certainly leaves you wondering where did it all start billions of years ago and where will it all go billions of years from now? It quickly shows you how little we know about the skys above us and where we came from. Are there other life forms out there, probably, but you quickly find out how lucky we are to have a planet with all the right conditions to support mankind. You will quickly learn how much we have learned about the last billion years in the last 50 years since space exploration began. The series shows us why we need to explore space to survive the next billion years. It also shows you how much more we need to learn about the heavens.",1293580800,17,1000,4.15979381443299
4249560,4,B0042EJDJ4,"The fifth season of The Universe is, by far, the shortest season with only 8 episodes:

""7 Wonders of the Solar System""
""Mars: The New Evidence""
""Magnetic Storm""
""Time Travel""
""Secrets of the Space Probes""
""Asteroid Attack""
""Total Eclipse""
""Dark Future of the Sun""

It's a little disappointing -- as a viewer, I feel a bit cheated out of five episodes this season, given that previous seasons had 13 or more episodes each.

This has been a good series thus far -- perhaps the best on TV since ""Cosmos"" in the 1980s. But it is apparent, based on the last two years, that the producers are running out of new ideas and angles. Now, with this short season, one can't help but wonder if viewers will be seeing a season 6.

Still, with all the discoveries and tantalizing hints revealed by the new particle accelerator, coupled with observations and discoveries from the space-based telescopes, you would think there'd be more than enough ""science fuel"" from just 2010 for new programs. I'd like to see an episode chronicling the Voyager spacecraft journeys now that they're leaving the fringes of the solar system and heading into true interstellar space.

Bottom line: If you like the series thus far, it's worth buying Season 5. The price is right for the short season. The science is still good and the series, as a whole, holds up even after five years in terms of relevant and accurate information.",1293408000,62,1399,4.7407407407407405
4249561,2,B0042EJDJ4,"I'm not reviewing the content of this set, but what I did notice is the amount of run-time this years series has. Just over six hours, while every other season is between 14 and 10 hours long. They show a retail price of $40.00 and selling right now at $20.00 I do like this series but it seams like the content is running out or something, being about the universe, how can one run out of material??? Anyway, I'm just stating an observation and hope someone else reads this and helps them not to buy this at full price.",1292889600,17,520,4.262626262626263

4249575,5,B0042EJDJ4,"If you are reading this review you have no doubt read many other reviews of the series in general. All 6 seasons are top quality productions and you can't go wrong buying ANY of them. A word of advice. If you can control the desire for immediate gratification the entire series can be found VERY affordably by shopping back & forth between eBay and Amazon. New is nice but I have found that dvd's in the grades of ""Very Good to Like New"" are a great deal.",1395187200,,455,4.241379310344827

4249580,5,B0042EJDJ4,"Excellent series. Written for the lay person, it give one an understanding of the wonders of the Universe. There is some repetition, you only notice it if you watch them one after the other.",1354320000,,190,4.617647058823529
4249581,5,B0042EJDJ4,"Blu-ray really does justice for The Universe series.  Filled with great facts and awesome visuals.  The further this series goes, the deeper the subjects get.  But the creators continue to find ways to make the content understandable without melting your brain too much.  I think it's great.",1329868800,,291,5.127659574468085
4249582,1,B0042EJDJ4,once upon a time in a galaxy not far enough away there was a thing known as the big ban and no theory will tell you otherwise,1327795200,,125,3.6666666666666665
4249583,3,B0042EJDJ4,"The 5th season is worth watching, but like the 4th season there is much less science and much more speculation and sensationalism. The first three seasons were really much better. Given that and the fact that there are only 8 episodes in the 5th season keep me from giving it any more than 3 stars.
Still, as I said, it is worth watching. The price is reasonable, and there are a LOT of worse shows out there in the modern tv waste land that you could blow hard earned cash on.",1307145600,2,477,4.252747252747253
4249584,5,B0042EJDJ4,"I have been watching The Universe for years now. Granted all their new episodes are starting to look like reruns, But I love watching all the information and physics behind the planets, and other celestial bodies. I fully recommend this product to any raising scientist or just someone who loves watching science shows. When I got the DVD it was completely Scratch-Free, so do not worry about scratches here, even if they are used.

I have been researching science for over 4 years now, and I still recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to know more about science. Even I am still learning more on these DVD's.",1305936000,,611,4.657407407407407
4249585,5,B0042EJDJ4,"I thought given the shortness of this season and some of the topic titles, which seemed to be repeats of what they'd already covered in previous seasons, that I would be terribly disappointed. But on the contrary, these are some of the most well-made episodes in the entire series. I just hope there are more seasons to come.",1305676800,,325,4.620689655172414
4249586,5,B0042EJDJ4,"I read many of the other reviews, and while the ""Universe"" series does suffer from being melodramatic, and sometimes repetitious, I still feel it is an excellent program for providing a broad-brush introduction to the sciences and physics that the show addresses.  My high school sons enjoy the show immensely, and wonder when their science classes at school are going to start talking about cosmology, astronomy, and nuclear fusion!  This show is a great way to stimulate young people to become interested in the sciences.",1303862400,2,523,5.141176470588236
4249587,3,B0042EJDJ4,The Universe series made a huge mistake with audio ... just being 2.0.  My God ... Star Trek Next Generation was one of the first TV shows to come out with surround sound ... and boy did that add 14 dimensions to my audio space.  It probably threw in a couple more parallel universes in there at the same time.  I can't understand how a great series like this is so technologically backwards ... it's just a crying shame.  The only reason I can think of is they do not care what people think of their product.  Outer space has such great envelopment with 5.1 audio.  It's almost boring to watch knowing it could be so much better with 5.1 audio.  I just hope they do not make a 3D version without including 5.1 audio.,1302739200,,717,4.266666666666667
4249588,2,B0042EJDJ4,"When you compare season 5 with season 2, 5 is a ripoff.
Season 2 had 19 shows on 4 disk.  Season 5 has 8 shows on 2 disk.
It is like they just rushed through to get a season out no matter how incomplete it is.
I am very dissapointed.",1302739200,,233,3.66

Then you will have to tolerate the superfluous special effects that are overused and constantly repeated for no other reason than to fill time to extend out a small amount of information to fill an entire hour on TV.",1302307200,3,267,4.680851063829787
4249590,5,B0042EJDJ4,The Universe season 5 is a great season i really enjoyed all of the episodes in this season..only wish it were longer 6 hours of content is pretty short but it's still a wonderful season and the price is pretty cheap :) and the universe on blu-ray looks amazing on my 40inch sony tv the detail is just amazing..i would recommend this to anyone who loves learning about space.,1300320000,,375,4.449275362318841
4249591,1,B0042EJDJ4,"I've Got to say, that After watching & Enjoying seasons one through to season 4 of ""The Universe"", I Found A couple of things wrong with this, The complete season 5...

Firstly, the length of the series, in comparison to the previous sets, And secondly, The Content in Season five... In an age when doomsayers are flourishing from EVERY corner of the world, This was one series i did NOT expect to go down the ""End Of the World"", & The ""Mayan Calender"" Crap... It was not what I wanted to watch, Nor was it something I was expecting...

The Series had gone so well, Untill We came to this, ""The Complete season 5""... After watching the first 2 or 3 episodes, & Reading the titles of the other episodes, I was completely uninterested in watching the rest.

Everyone goes on and on and on about the world ending because of the Mayan calender, Did any ""scientsists"" Bother to question why the calender would have stopped where it did? Did the Ever, For instance stop & think, that Maybe, Just maybe, The Mayan Astrologer, Who wrote the calendar, Just couldn't go on to complete it? That maybe he was working on it, & Just passed on the next day, Leaving his fragile work Unfinished? Where is the research that proves the belief, beyond a reason, beyond a doubt, that the world will end on December 21 2012?

Seriously, All these doomsayers, need to get a REAL J-O-B... And Stop Wasting everyone's time with this useless innuendo... Ugggghhhhh! The World will end when it does... Neither I, You, The Scientsis, Nostradamus, Or The Mayans are going to be able to do anything to stop that... Sad fact is, It AIN'T happening on that pre given Date...

A Little off topic there, But you get the point, I'm Sure...",1300147200,7,1705,4.54071661237785
4249592,5,B0042EJDJ4,Thank you for carrying the Universe series.  You make it more affordable than the History website.  I realize it might not seem like much but when you figure the cost of the dvd and the shipping over time it figures out to be quite a lot.,1298678400,,238,4.1521739130434785
4249593,5,B0042EJDJ4,"I am sorry that this season was so brief but the shows were still incredible. The entire run of all five seasons is an excellent show, with every season showcasing the wonders that are up there.

WITH SEASON 5 AS WITH PRIOR SEASONS IT BECOMES INCREASINGLY CLEAR THAT WE HAVE SO MUCH TO LEARN AND UNDERSTAND IN REGARD TO OUR PLACE IN THE GRAND DESIGN AND HOW THE EARTH CAME INTO BEING AND THE EVER DEVELOPING IDEA THAT WE ARE NOT ALONE. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND COLLECTING ALL THE SEASONS YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED WITH WHAT IS REVEALED WITHIN THIS EPIC PRESENTATION OF THE UNIVERSE. THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE HUMAN RACE HAS MORE IN COMMON AS A PEOPLE CAN UNITE US RATHER THAN DEVIDE US AND BY STUDYING THE UNIVERSE WE WILL BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND OUR ORIGIN AND HUMANITY WITH EACH OTHER.

4249595,4,B0042EJDJ4,"I love this series having bought all of them, must say one of the best so far. My only complaint is this 5th season is short, which is why it does not get 5 stars.",1295481600,,163,3.6857142857142855
4249596,4,B0042EJDJ4,"It seems that the creators of this show are running out of ideas for new episodes.  I don't see how that is possible seeing that our universe is infinitely large and filled with constant new discoveries.

The content from this season is first class, which is to be expected from this great series.  Each episode is well researched and presented in a format that is easy to understand.  If you've enjoyed the previous seasons of The Universe, the content of season 5 will not disappoint.

I hope this short season is just a bump in the road for this otherwise excellent series and not the end of the line.  Thank you Amazon for giving this abbreviated season an abbreviated price.",1294444800,18,679,4.616666666666666
