I grew up in a world where individuals with Down Syndrome were called ""Mongoloids"" or ""Mongoloid idiots"" and hidden from pubic view by fearful/guilt ridden parents.  One such young man (also name Jon) lived in our neighborhood and was a mysterious character... for the most part, his mother kept him hidden away in the house - we only knew he lived there because we could hear his frequent outbursts of temper. ""Strong Love"" shows a wonderful 180 degree turn - Jon and Holly are contributing/participating members of society, fully backed and well loved by their parents and many others, but most notably by Jon's coach. In her inimitable fashion, Bonnie Burt is able to capture the full gamut of emotions so that I felt teary eyed at times and pleasantly amused at others. For me, the biggest plus from seeing this film is to notice that I feel very positive emotions (rather than discomfort/shying away) whenever I come across an individual who happens to have DS.",1436832000,,1010,4.872093023255814
