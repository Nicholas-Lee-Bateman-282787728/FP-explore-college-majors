8517614,5,B007IJD0N0,"Interesting and well-done documentary of David Livingstone, Scottish missionary and explorer to Africa. Good introduction to his life and extensive missionary travels and expeditions.",1449532800,,183,6.666666666666667
8517615,5,B007IJD0N0,"A good documentary.  But I desperately want ""Secrets of the Dead, The Lost Diary of David Livingston"".  Can you find it for me?",1438041600,,127,4.478260869565218
8517616,3,B007IJD0N0,I was looking for something that was more story based.  If you are looking for a documentary then this is for  you.  I learned some new things about the missionary that I had not known in the past.,1370908800,3,197,4.131578947368421
8517617,4,B007IJD0N0,Really interesting. However concentrated much more on his explorations than it did on his faith. I found myself wanting to hear more about this side of the man than was included in this documentry.,1338595200,6,197,4.823529411764706
