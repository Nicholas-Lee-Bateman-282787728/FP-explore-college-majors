8171694,5,B00005BGSU,"Loved the variety of corny clay creatures from all the different horror shows combined together.  They blend well known horror charactors from memorable horror pictures together to create a satire on those films.  You will recognize your favorite ""CLAY CREEPS"" instantly as they are so well crafted and their  personalities are a DEAD give away.  Definitly recommended this for horror heroes, satire snickerers or anyone else who wants to walk through Blair Witch Lane again!!!!
