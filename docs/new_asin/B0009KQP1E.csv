2299292,4,B0009KQP1E,"It's unfortunate that so many people took this film to be a strict historical treatment of the Zodiac crimes, but given the film's title, that might be understandable. However, beneath that awesome cover is a disc that is really something of a gem. Once I realized that Lommel's film was more of a personal vision talking about how society, by and large, views itself through the media looking glass, among many other things, it became perfectly clear to me why Lommel had chosen the Zodiac killer as a metaphor with which he could depict said vision. After all, the Zodiac was someone who was personally able to shape the public's perception of him, and was one who didn't accept the media at face value to the point of actually toying with them.

Personally, I have no problem with the ""zero budgeted"" movie 'industry'; it often makes for stuff that is far more entertaining than some $30 million dollar piece of Hollywood booboo. Ulli Lommel's THE ZODIAC KILLER is one of those films in my personal view. It was great to see David A. Hess, and Ulli himself did a pretty good job in his performance. This is a great little work for those who remember Ulli's films from the golden era of the 'slasher flicks', and Lommel incorporates many themes from many of his earlier movies; indeed using actual footage from his previous films to depict one or more of his cinematic obsessions. I enjoyed this film and even enjoyed it more the second time when I wasn't expecting any real life Zodiac stuff at all. It may not be for everyone's taste, but I had a good time with it and am looking forward to Lommel's upcoming releases.",1124236800,,1622,4.612456747404845
2299293,1,B0009KQP1E,"Terrible beyond words, this horribly ""directed"", scriptless, budgetless antifilm filled with painfully bad ""acting"" is so wretchedly bad that it makes sleazy direct-to-video exploitation flicks from the 70s and 80s appear (almost) watchable. You would probably find more entertainment (not to mention professionalism and factual research) in those awful quasipornographic ""detective dramas"" than you could ever hope to fish out of the rotting celluloid corpse of ""The Zodiac Killer"". German hack Uli Lommel, fresh after his months-long ""reign"" on the #1 position of IMDB.com's Bottom 100 (the list of the worst movies of all time), decided to invade the US with this new ""film"", apparently determined to prove that Ed Wood may not be alive, but his spirit was reincarnated in Germany and is currently shared between the bodies of Lommel and Boll (both with eerily similar first names... coincidence or curse?). Mission accomplished, herr Lommel! In fact, you outdid yourself, for compared to you, Ed Wood looks like Ingmar Bergman.

(Oh, and herr ""Wils..."", err, Lommel? Take it easy with the planted positive reviews, would you? That does not become even your sort...)

Finally, a helpful hand for those few who might want to torture themselves by trying to see this ""film"" just to find out what identity Lommel gave to the Zodiac - if you want to know the ""great twist"" of ""The Zodiac Killer"", read on...

Lommel (yes, he has a prominent ""acting"" role in this ""film"" of his) is the Zodiac. A retired Zodiac filled with - drums, maestro - remorse. Hilariously enough, this is supposed to be a surprise, even though the very first second that we see Lommel's character, we're not only told that he knows every detail of Zodiac's life, from the earliest childhood to his post-1960s undetected murders, but we're also immediately drawn to the black-rimmed, square glasses that he's wearing (for some reason, he has no Zodiac-brand watch - perhaps Lommel thought that it *might* be too much of a hint?). We're also left wondering why the Zodiac would speak broken English with a horribly pronounced and annoying German accent, but such details are of no importance to Lommel. He's an independent director, you see. Ergo, he's un artiste extraordinaire - in his own mind, anyway...",1123027200,10,2277,5.066666666666666
2299294,4,B0009KQP1E,"Absolutely, one could take apart any movie and declare it unfit, and of course the cowardly will use the excuse of a small budget film with little resources at its disposal, and rip it to shreds based on its status as a small budget movie. Such an easy target for the smallminded. And yet, watching this ""impossibly bad"" and ""worse than a high-school production"" feature movie, I'm reminded of how a little resourcefulness can make one wonder about how the Zodiac killer, as a person, might have ended up. He stopped killing many years ago. Some people insist that he is dead, otherwise it would be too much to accept that he lives and works in our community. The smallminded have their safety nets of thought in which they sleep and dream of worlds in which people like the Zodiac cannot/do not exist anymore. But what if he *does* live, what if he does live and work around us. Who is he? Is he a monster, an unstoppable killer....still? Or is he someone who is among the rich and famous or celebrated of us, in one fashion or another. This little ""nothing"" of a movie that to some is ""worse than vermin"" and ""impossibly bad"" puts forward the possibility that the man is celebrated among us. Some of the other critics of this little movie are quick to dismiss anything that dares to make them question preconceived notions about these ""what if...."" questions. And yet this little movie successfully answers most questions of how could such a vicious killer continued to operate in a society such as ours. How did he survive? Easily answered. Watch the movie.",1122508800,,1560,4.635379061371841
2299295,1,B0009KQP1E,"Hands down one of the worst movies I have ever watched.  It wasn't factual, the actors stunk, and the quality was horrible.  A total rip-off.",1122422400,6,141,4.6
2299296,1,B0009KQP1E,"The movie was horrid. My sister saw it and rented it for me,knowing that I read the Robert Graysmith books and found the Zodiac to be intresting. I had a hard time even watching a few minutes. I went and grabbed my computer and looked it up. From the promo on the DVD and the title it looked like it was something recording the Zodiac murders, like the the Graysmith books. I was mistaken, this wasn't about the movie about anything. It was a poorly written film and looked like CSPAN filmed it using the same planted camera. Not only was it bad in that sense, but bad in all the others. The poorly spoken ""copycat"" that didn't really copycat anything. His claiming to be the ""real"" Zodiac killer (who would be in his 50's at the earliest and more likly in his 60's or 70's and almost beyond doubt dead). Then there is the whole other parts of the plot. Simon Vale was dumb and that isn't even mentioning the whole little ""jury"" of hooded men. I wish I could rate it lower and get my 3 dollars I spent renting it back.",1122163200,6,1018,4.252577319587629
2299297,4,B0009KQP1E,"A low-budget movie with an intelligent speculation about the identity and fate of the Zodiac Killer, the serial killer that frightened the San Francisco Bay Area back in the 1970s. This movie will probably upset those looking for a gory spectacle, although some of the still photos used are very gruesome. The movie unfolds in the style of a murder mystery rather than a wind-up-killer flick. The acting is above average and David Hess is very amusing in a straight role. The people who whine about the low budget have no imagination. Rather than simply document the Zodiac's murder spree, which would be unimaginative, the filmmakers have opted to understand the motives of the killer. There is still plenty of horror for those looking for some, but most of the running time is spent constructing an unusual and interesting pathology of Zodiac. The revelation of exactly who the Zodiac is will put off those expecting to see a standard movie monster. Those of us with patience and insight will appreciate this offbeat take on the serial killer phenomenon.",1122163200,,1056,4.938202247191011
2299298,1,B0009KQP1E,"UGGHHHH...... is it possible to really TRY to make a film and have it be this bad ?

Seriously !",1122163200,19,166,4.0
2299299,1,B0009KQP1E,I was extremely dissapointed after watching five minutes of the film.  The story line has no relation to the actual case and the acting is terrible.,1122163200,4,148,4.6923076923076925
2299300,1,B0009KQP1E,"Terrible.  Awful. Has nothing to do in any way, shape, or form with the actual case.  I could not sit through the first 10 min. of this waste of time and film-making.  Besides the content being incredibly bad, the actual footage itself looked as if it were shot by the same type of people who film porn movies.",1121990400,5,310,4.310344827586207
2299311,1,B0009KQP1E,"And that's not saying much.  Believe it or not, I actually liked this movie.  Well, to be honest, I liked the concept behind the movie, but this flick otherwise sucked.  The history of the Zodiac Killer as recounted in this movie was almost completely fictitious, and it looked like some of the ""crime scene photos"" were pulled from a website specializing in gruesome pics (which made the Zodiac Killer seem to be more like the Zodiac Butcher.  He didn't seem to have a problem dismembering his victims in this flick).

There were holes in the plot big enough to drive a truck through.  Simon Vale, the retired Zodiac Killer, wrote a book in the 1970's in which he detailed the life of the Zodiac, and yet it never occurred to anyone how he could possibly have known anything about it.  No one suspected that Vale was the Zodiac Killer despite the intimate details he revealed about his young life that only the Zodiac could possibly have known!

The Zodiac ""copycat"" (he wasn't really) buys a nerve agent in pill form (at $50 each!), uses it to knock out prospective victims, then kills them.  In one absurd scene, a gasses a pizza delivery girl, decides against killing her, then chows down on the pizza!  In other words, he just blew $50 on a single pizza and didn't even kill anyone!  Riiiiight...

Then we find the Zodiac Killer, who for years never had a problem murdering and butchering his dozens of victims without a second thought suddenly feeling remorse when he sees how a family member of his last victim was traumatized by his crime!  Huh?  Then he turns his back on his evil past, becomes good and writes a book about himself, and no one figures out who he really is?

The cabal of black hooded men are suddenly thrown in for good measure (although I still can't figure out why they're in the movie in the first place), but the gratuitous gay sex scenes left me feeling like I'd accidentally walked into the wrong theater and was watching a cheesy porn flick instead.

The acting was terrible, the dialogue trite, and it looked like it was shot on Lommel's camcorder.  It was especially amusing to see the copycat Zodiac, a good 30-40 years younger then the real Zodiac, suddenly cower in fear when he realized who Simon Vale really was and try to escape, but how often do we see this kind of clich in the movies where the characters suddenly turn stupid and don't know what to do?  Why he didn't pull his gun or even just punch the old man out is beyond me.

That being said, I liked the idea of the original Zodiac Killer stalking the younger Zodiac ""copycat.""  It's too bad Lommel otherwise had no clue what he was doing behind the camera.  Give this one a miss.",1170547200,5,2680,4.507246376811594
2299312,1,B0009KQP1E,"What a waste of time this movie was. I could not wait for it to end. To call this an amateur film is an insult to amateurs.

While I was watching it, the power in my house went off. I kinda hoped it would stay off.

What I liked about it was the cover, thats it. I think they should just sell the case without the DVD. Or throw a blank DVD in the case.

Here is the movie in a nutshell: horrendous acting, garbage script, filmed on what appeared to be a $50 video camera.

AVOID THIS TRASH! The 1971 Zodiak Killer was bad too, but it was the kind of bad that was worth watching. Not this movie.",1167264000,8,594,3.925
2299313,1,B0009KQP1E,"... and I didn't even get paid for it... despite the director's (ulli) promises. So - maybe that's a measure of how bad a production it was...? But I thought I'd get this out to the public - just let people know what sort of production and director this is... I played the computer hacker. (it was fun to do, though! - and I'm not even an actor!)",1159920000,12,346,4.102941176470588
2299314,1,B0009KQP1E,"When it comes to cheap productions, this awful little mess should rank near the top of the (garbage) heap.  Script, acting, and production values are nil, and it appears that the whole thing was shot with a home video camera; however, it is far less entertaining than the average home video.  It is an utterly pointless waste of time and money, and should be marketed only as a cure for insomnia.  When compared with the bozos who made this film, Ed Wood looks like Cecil B. DeMille, and that is a notable accomplishment indeed.  The size of the budget does not determine the quality of the film; however, when coupled with a dull and pointless script, sleepwalking actors, and the incredible ineptitude of the writer/director, the low budget doesn't exactly recommend it.  Admirers of this film are certainly welcome to it; those of us who are evidently not as intellectually gifted can live without it.  The debate over this film is rather like the story, ""The Emperor's New Clothes"", in that those who look hard enough for something will generally see it, whether it exists or not.  This sorry mess isn't worth the pomposity and arrogance with which some persons choose to approach it.  Personally, I find this film to be an abject waste, so number me among the numbskulls.",1150329600,,1276,4.7681818181818185

2299318,1,B0009KQP1E,"Ulli Lommel, the director, was quoted in Fangoria as saying he made this film for $200,000 on digital. This film looks more like he spent $200. A real utter piece of cow droppings. Ulli Lommel ranks right up there with Uwe Bolle as the worst director of all time.

I am banning all Lion's Gate products from now on. Now and again they give us a good one like Saw, but they release so much junk. They will buy anyone's film as long as it's horror and release it in a nice package. Stuff like S.I.C.K. and this junk film, Zodiac Killer. Almost all of it shot on mini dv. They have a nerve. Junk.

Maybe they are ""B"" movies, or alternative, or otherwise ""artsy"" Cannes Film Festival movies.

This movie is a total waste of time. It is not even remotely related to the Zodiac as I understand the case, the acting terrible, and could perhaps be the worst movie of all time.",1126569600,2,529,4.453608247422681

This is without a doubt the worst movie I've seen in years & yes the look of it & the acting does remind one of a porno movie - save your money ,I actually bought this thing because I am somewhat of a True Crime buff.

Yes, it's a low budget film and it shows. It's not very well filmed and there are inserts from earlier Lommel films, but I found the story to be interesting enough to make up for most of it.
