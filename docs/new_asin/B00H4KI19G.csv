8629964,5,B00H4KI19G,"The Rich Mahogany edition is the best version of this movie. The t shirt is a men's large and looks and fits well. The ice cream coupon was way expired,  but I'm not a huge fan of butterscotch.  The Ron Burgundy book excerpt was brilliant and I had to go buy the whole book after reading just a few paragraphs.",1414108800,,310,4.15
