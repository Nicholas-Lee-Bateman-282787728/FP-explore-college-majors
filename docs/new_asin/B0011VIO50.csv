3069698,3,B0011VIO50,"To begin, I must compliment Sony for taking the initiative of releasing this program in full season DVD sets (as opposed to the unsettling trend of many companies to nickel and dime their customers with 3-episode releases).  That said this set represents the first ten episodes of the first season with three bonus episodes (13 total) across 2 discs.  Collectors looking for goodies will be a bit let down as there isn't even a DVD card enclosed in the set (although there is, strangely enough, an offer to order a subscription to Sports Illustrated Kids to make up for this).  Fortunately some sets do come packaged with a limited edition film cell shrink wrapped against the back of the case.

The story structure, for those unaware, is in my opinion what happens when you take a big budget, a whole host of talent, and have absolutely no story to tell. The presentation in this show is second to none, with backgrounds that are absolutely gorgeous! The problem is that the program, um, often tends to go nowhere. Each show consists of a fairly simplistic plot structure (someone gets kidnapped for example) and the heroes go off to rescue them. Fair enough I suppose but with visuals this compelling, this show could have been something very, very special.

About ten minutes of each 22-minute episodes focuses entirely on race segments, sword fighting, or intricate flying sequences, which further dilutes an already watered-down plot.  Don't get me wrong, these displays continue to dazzle time and time again, literally raising the bar for what is perceived possible in modern animation.

Individuals who enjoy Japanese animation (anime) or even recent domestic works (Justice League, Teen Titans, etc.) will likely long for a bit more character development/ interaction/ maturation as time goes on. Kids who happen to watch these types of shows simply for the visuals will find much to delight in here.  I found the set quite entertaining but stick to my assessment that anime-style writing coupled to this show's visuals could have been magnificent.",1228521600,,2057,5.011730205278592
3069699,1,B0011VIO50,theres a reason this show airs in the morning now. it makes you want to leave the house. keeps me on time for work i guess.,1221177600,,123,3.769230769230769
3069700,4,B0011VIO50,"Jaded teenagers full of angst, beware!  This is not the show for you.  There will be no swearing, no innuendo, no gratuitous violence.  When someone gets shot out of the sky, they are careful to show that they parachuted to safety.  If someone acts unkind, they are not rewarded for it.

The characters are likable and very interested in being the good guys.  There is lots of little quips and moral stories, though its not so overbearing that it detracts from the show.

Nothing deep, nothing adult.  Its silly and I couldn't live on it anymore than I can live on cotton candy, but its refreshing.  If you're a parent who is concerned with what their kids watch, this is a show you can enjoy with them and not worry about, and you can both enjoy it together.

The graphics are even top notch, better than most kids shows go for today too.",1215820800,6,839,4.42483660130719
3069701,5,B0011VIO50,"Storm hawks has become a regularly featured show at our house. Everyone from Mom to the two year old loves this show.  It combines some of the best elements from other scifi and fantasy shows, especially Star Wars and the series Firefly.  There are also elements of  World War I aerial combat, and a little bit of World War II French Resistance fun thrown in.  In addition it gives a whole new universe concept.  Instead of planets to fly between there are raised pieces of land called terras.  These terras are surrounded by clouds and far below is a waste land.  Most every thing in this world is powered by crystals.  There are crystals for everything from sliming to cloaking.  For Dad the best part is the cool motorcycles that turn into planes.  Every time they takeoff and land you can't help but want one.  All the episodes are great but of particular fun is the episode title ""The Black Gorge."" The two year old in the family can't seem to get enough of the cute little creatures in it especially at the end of the episode.  Highly recommended for anyone into Scifi and amusing character interplay.",1213747200,3,1107,4.563451776649746

8242688,5,B0011VIO50,Now I have both the Storm Hawks DVDs and loving every minute of it I hope there another one out there,1377043200,,101,3.857142857142857
8242689,5,B0011VIO50,My 7 year old absolutely loves this dvd. It is a real treat for him to watch a little after he completes his homework.,1370217600,,118,3.9583333333333335
8242690,4,B0011VIO50,Not sure when this was originally aired but this is a good show and I like the combo of science fiction with archaic knights and chivalry.,1364428800,,138,4.346153846153846
8242691,5,B0011VIO50,My grandson enjoys this series and watches them quite a bit.  Good story line and not overpowering for the younger children.,1360022400,,124,4.904761904761905
8242692,5,B0011VIO50,"The show is very well-done in all aspects. The only bad thing I want to point: season 3 remains unveiled and the producers don't say a thing about it.

In fact a magnificent production!",1358726400,,185,4.4411764705882355
8242693,4,B0011VIO50,"Instead of having 5 episodes on 1st disc and 8 episodes on 2nd, I wish they had put 7 episodes on 1st disc and 6 episodes on the 2nd disc. Or other way around I don't care. There is no opening and closing credits per episode. There is one opening and then all the episodes and then the closing credits for all the episodes. The 3 bonus episodes come on automatically after the last episode on the 2nd disc.",1353542400,,406,4.151898734177215
8242694,5,B0011VIO50,"I happen to chance upon this cartoon series when looking for a suitable (early)Christmas gift for my nephew & niece who are around 14 and 11 years old and was pleasantly surprised by it. Both of them are fond of cartoon series like Teen Titans, Secret Saturdays and Ben10 which are mostly shown on Cartoon Network. This Canadian cartoon series is produced by Nerd Corp and was recently shown again on Disney XD. The episodes revolve around a group of friends led by the last decendant of the Storm Hawks, Aerow, who battle the evil Cyclonians on 'sky cycles' in a fictional world populated by 'terras' known as Atmos. However, the stories don't only center around their (spectacular) aerial fights and battles with the Cyclonians but showcase the relationship and friendship between members of the group (which reminds me of Joss Whedon's 'Firefly' and 'Serenity')and their encounters with other inhabitants or monsters on the other 'terras'. The computerised/cell animation is top notch, the characters lovable, the story intelligent and often humourous & no harsh language or inappropriate content for children/teens. Highly recommended.",1320796800,,1139,5.263736263736264
8242695,5,B0011VIO50,"I love this show - I caught a glimpse of one of the episodes on TV when I was in the USA back in 2007, and ever since have been fascinated with the style and look of it.

Finally, I buy the first season on DVD, and along with the cool 3D-2D style that it has, its actually got an interesting episodic storyline...  Sure, so far its been 'meet a different squadron each episode'-type stuff, but its bound together with a common enemy - the Cyclonians.  Each episode, the team gets up to something different.

The characters are very likeable, and there's a really good range of personalities that always lead to often action-packed-yet-comical-situations.

Nonetheless, I got hooked in.  Great show, great characters, great visual style and definitely worth checking out the website ([...]) as it has trailers for each episode if you're unsure about what this show is.",1241654400,3,867,4.785234899328859
8242696,5,B0011VIO50,I used this as an incentive prize for my 4-year-old son to learn to clean up his messes.  When he filled in his chart he got the video.  HE LOVES IT.  Even I enjoy watching it with him.  It has lots of action with flying vehicles that turn into motorcycles on the ground.  The characters are well-acted and have unique personalities.,1229040000,,333,4.39344262295082
