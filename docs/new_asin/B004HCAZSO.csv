4375568,5,B004HCAZSO,"The Rogues was an interesting story about good bad guys, as far as I can tell. The formula of the show seems to be a British family that appears to be wealthy by means of stealing.
However, though they are thieves they end up robbing from other thieves thus justifying their actions. They travel to exotic places and end up helping others in need with a touch of humor.
For something a little different and entertaining, I would highly recommend this.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rogues-Volume-One-TWO-DVD-Set-10-Classic-Episodes/dp/B004HCAZSO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rogues-Volume One-TWO DVD Set-10 Classic Episodes</a>",1341878400,,673,6.488888888888889
4375569,5,B004HCAZSO,"It was my mother's and my favorite show and we looked forward to it each week. We loved those charming con artists! The acting from real talented Hollywood stars! Gig Young, David Niven, Charles Boyer, Robert Coote and last but not least Dame Gladys Cooper. The stories are still fascinating and pulling off the capers are exciting to watch after all those years. As I have been waiting years for Vol 1, I can't wait for Vols 2 and 3 to complete the collection. What a great show. We were just sorry the series didn't last longer.",1331251200,2,530,4.474226804123711
4375570,5,B004HCAZSO,"Sometimes old classics are as you remember them, and this DVD made with refreshed copies are well worth the money. The humour is classical, too, and of the best quality with such brilliant actors! Fun pun with language and situations. A feel good DVD from the good old TV-days.",1326412800,7,277,4.673469387755102
4375571,4,B004HCAZSO,"Loved ""The Rogues"" when they were first on almost 50 years ago.  They still hold up exceedingly well.  Also enjoyed Colonel Flack back then which was shorter and less elaborate but along the same lines.  The actors in this series were already legends working in the fairly early days of a new medium.  It is so great that past history like this is preserved

I also remember at the time that I was very angry when The Rouges was cancelled and replaced by the TV version of ""Wackiest Ship in the Army"".  But they did such a good job on the new series that I became a fan of it as well mainly because of Jack Warden.",1313366400,5,614,4.205128205128205
4375572,5,B004HCAZSO,"This was a short-lived (one season, thirty episodes) series about a family of conmen, the chief members of which are played by Gig Young (American branch), David Niven (British) and Charles Boyer (French), with Gladys Cooper as the matriarch and Robert Coote as a British secondary player.  In each case, the mark is a greedy, often dishonest and always unsympathetic character; the interest is in seeing how this otherwise shrewd ""victim"" can be successfully duped.  Ten of the shows are on these DND's and they are of passable quality.  Before now, the only way to see these was to buy German-dubbed versions with English subtitles.  The plots and the acting are excellent - the series won the Golden Globe award - and if you haven't heard of it or seen it since the sixties, you are in for a pleasant experience.",1304380800,35,815,4.75886524822695
4375573,5,B004HCAZSO,"I am really enjoying this dvd set that I recently purchased. The show is a comedy/thriller about con artists and really brought me back. Lots of legend actors in this show-Daid Niven, Charles Boyer. I was surprised to see a very young Larry Hagman in one of the episodes.",1296518400,12,271,4.551020408163265

4375576,4,B004HCAZSO,"This is not an official studio DVD release, which this cult series deserves.  In fact, the episodes look to be assembled by some crafty editor from digital versions downloaded from Youtube, in various levels of quality ranging from poor to okay.  Better than nothing until the real thing arrives, but be aware.",1417996800,5,310,4.9423076923076925
4375577,5,B004HCAZSO,I hope we get to see the other ten episodes in the next volume well done,1417910400,,72,3.5625
4375578,5,B004HCAZSO,"Loved these playlets when I saw them years ago, love them still. David Niven, Et al are phenomable talents and bring a light hearted delivery that is truly delightful to stories that intrigue. Lot time but not old fashioned.",1417564800,,224,4.769230769230769
4375579,5,B004HCAZSO,"Ever since I first saw the TV series many decades ago, I have been searching for it on DVD. Finally, someone figured out that making a little money is better than making none at all! Or whatever it took to release the series. When I saw that The Rogues was available, I immediately ordered it, didn't even care about the quality of the copy. But as soon as I fed it into the DVD player and heard that iconic theme music, I was transported back in time. Absolutely terrific! Good quality of the copy (at least the episodes I've enjoyed), good sound, wide screen, and very entertaining.",1401494400,17,584,4.4672897196261685
4375580,5,B004HCAZSO,"This is an excellent series that won a golden globe award.
It was produced only a single single for a total of thirty episodes.

The production values are extremely high. The writing is superb - even if the characters do not always take themselves seriously.  The  ""Star Power"" is unequallled in any other tv series of the period. I can only assume that it cost so much to produce that they ended production after one season.

Ii have recently been watching many different series from this period. Of all the contemporary dramas,  this one has best stood the test of time.  The writing is engaging even after fifty years.

I would encourage you to watch a sample episode on you tube - then get the complete series.. You will be glad you did.",1400716800,,741,4.526315789473684
4375581,2,B004HCAZSO,"Not as entertaining as it was when the series was made. Much better plots, technology, and acting in present productions",1397779200,,120,5.05
4375582,5,B004HCAZSO,One of the best series ever. Hustle does not get close - but still is good attempt. With the actors changing due to their busy schedules it kept the interest going. Been looking for this copy for many years and it runs on type 1 - (so not just for US - or type 4 recorders),1391385600,2,273,3.892857142857143
4375583,4,B004HCAZSO,"I watched this series when I was a young teenager with my mother. It was her favorite program, and won awards. Now, somewhere between 40 and 50 years later, I find it dated in a way that Marx Brothers movies are not. My greatest pleasure came from watching David Niven and Robert Coote. Robert Coote's wistful sweetness and affection and David Niven's charm, distinct from the series, are evergreen.",1383436800,4,399,4.797101449275362
4375584,5,B004HCAZSO,"I watched these great tv episodes way back in high school, and there had never been any television like them! Fine acting, lots of humour, nice twisted plots, and of course, great acting by wonderful stars like David Niven and Charles Boyer!",1371254400,,241,4.761904761904762

4375586,5,B004HCAZSO,... To find this.  Promptly despatched.  Bought as a gift so I have not watched it all myself but I think it was the perfect present.,1360454400,,133,4.076923076923077
4375587,5,B004HCAZSO,"GREAT STUFF ..... VERY CLEVER.  I REMEMBER WATCHING THIS AS A KID.  I ONLY WISH THAT THIS SHOW WOULD HAVE GONE ON FOR MANY YEARS SO I COULD AQUIRE MORE OF THESE DVD'S,  BUT IT ONLY LASTED 1 SEASON.  HARD TO BELIEVE, SINCE IT WAS SO HIGHLY ACCLAIMED.

IT COULD BE A LITTLE BIT BETTER QUALITY, BETTER TRANSFER FROM ORIGINAL FLIM, BUT STILL GREAT TO WATCH.  IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE THEME OF THESE SHOWS, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED !",1359849600,5,429,4.3
4375588,1,B004HCAZSO,"My Husband was beside himself that I had purchased this volume as well as number one in the series, he had them on tape and wanted the DVD's to add to his collection.  Very pleased with the DVD's and quality of the item.",1357603200,,220,4.116279069767442
4375589,5,B004HCAZSO,"I have been a great fan of The Rogues since they were broadcast.  Had the opertunity to tape practically every episode on VHS.  Trying to copy to DVD, but tape is shedding and clogging the heads.  Was so happy to see that these were available.  Excellent transfer and well worth the money,  Hope all will be released.",1356480000,,317,4.491228070175438
4375590,5,B004HCAZSO,I loved the show when it was on and truly love being able to see them again from time to time.,1355443200,,94,3.5238095238095237
4375591,5,B004HCAZSO,"My late dad's two favorite television shows were The Rogues and Mister Peepers.  I had never seen either, so I purchased DVDs of both.

The Rogues was broadcast only one season, 1964-65.  It received the Golden Globe Award for Best New Television Series.  Gladys Cooper and Robert Coote were nominated for Best Supporting Actor Golden Globes.

The ten episodes in this box are classic television.  Every one makes you laugh when it is over.

Each episode is a caper, usually an attempt to swindle a swindler.  I imagine that aficianados of 60s caper movies will particularly appreciate this box.

In my view, the real star of the show was Robert Coote who received secondary billing.  He was a talent!

Highly recommended.  Too bad a box of the complete series is not available in the US.",1349568000,13,788,4.7555555555555555
4375592,5,B004HCAZSO,I remember this series from childhood and was delighted to see them again! The age shows in the clearness of the photography but it's no worse than black and white television was in the day. I have been looking for this for years but with the wrong title in mind.  What I want to know is where is volume II!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1348012800,,328,4.466666666666667
4375593,4,B004HCAZSO,"A classic cast of actors. These are actors who have earned their fame through years of classic pictures and the theater.
The series is based on solid character building and simple, but twists in the plot.
It was the first series I watched after my return from Vietnam, which was soothing for me and entertaining. It is in black & white and starts a little slow, with bits of humor, builds the plot with some twists. It is a mystery with clever and humorous writing. Never a violet scene, but has its moments of suspense. It is one of the first mysteries where the con folks are really decent.
If you want to watch a non-threatening, non-violet , witty, humorous, mystery, with a cast of well-known classic actors, try this, you'll like it.",1345420800,4,739,4.56390977443609
8429439,5,B004HCAZSO,"This was one of television's finest, if all too brief, moments. When I saw that it was available I simply had to snap it up. I loved every single episode.
Sadly, they don't make television shows like this any more.",1521417600,,214,4.375
