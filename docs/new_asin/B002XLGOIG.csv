5152784,5,B002XLGOIG,"A true insider's look at Wall Street.  Wrote and filmed this before Enron and Madoff.  Story founded in truths, most scenes based on actual events.  Was criticized for ""unbelievability"" of events - people can be naive.  Wish the digital quality of film was better, my one regret.  Rent, buy or do both!  Enjoy.",1267056000,5,310,4.754716981132075
5152785,5,B002XLGOIG,Partially cheesy. But altogether fun to watch in the feel-good / light drama category while doing my laundery.,1408320000,,110,5.166666666666667
5152786,1,B002XLGOIG,Don't bother.  You know the entire plot after ten minutes.,1406419200,,58,4.8
5152787,3,B002XLGOIG,"Another movie made about Wall Street money, fraud, sex, lies and mergers. A self made guy is engaged with the daughter of the firm, but falls in in love with a waitress/artist. She also opens a gallery with the help of the same rich man. Both leave him after a failed and fraudulent merger, and meet again happily....",1403222400,2,317,4.482758620689655
5152788,5,B002XLGOIG,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film. You really shouldn't compare it to the movie ""Wall Street"" though- it's a very different film from the plot, to the actors, to quality. But I do think it was entertaining. Surprised that it's not on Netflix.",1401235200,,248,4.659090909090909
5152789,5,B002XLGOIG,If your looking to learn a bit about doing the right thing in relationships this is a great movie. Actors well done this movie as it does have a great storyline and execution.,1401148800,2,175,4.333333333333333
5152790,1,B002XLGOIG,"If you are expecting ""Wall Street,"" ""Arbitrage,"" ""Margin Call,"" or a movie of that ilk -- buyer beware!!!  I don't watch Lifetime TV but I doubt that even they would claim this loser.  Some low-budget films are quite good.  Not this one though.  Every aspect of this dud was below par.  I almost stop watching several times, but I'm too cheap to waste $1.99.  However, watching it meant that I did.",1400803200,,398,4.535211267605634
5152791,5,B002XLGOIG,"Sorry to say that I am totally biased where Elizabeth Banks is concerned. My favourite actress bar none !!!
I am lucky enough to have all her movies. Whether it be rom com, drama etc etc she excels. Check out
The Trade you won't be disappointed.",1361232000,,245,4.3478260869565215
5152792,4,B002XLGOIG,"This move had a lot to it, a character study of someone trying to make it to the top, the complications, the moral ambiguity, and the harsh world of trading.  I have many friends who work for Hedge Funds and Investment Banks, and the world was captured vividly.  The characters come to life, though a few things fall flat, for  7 dollars, the movie easily makes it worth it.  Then we come to the end, where the moral play comes to a point.  I've met people on Wall Street, I've talked with them, I've hung out with them, and gambled with them, let me tell you, the end ruins the movie.

Attempting to do something in the vein of Wall Street (the film) where the character learns his lessons, the movie comes up with a contrived ending, that just doesn't work well.  Look, I don't want to give away anything, but, had it ended when him settling into a life, set to become his girlfriend's father, rich, successful, and slightly sleazy, with us knowing that he put himself there, it would've been more realistic.  I do not believe it is a surprise to say that everything works out for the good guys and falls apart for the bad ones.  But we know today that the bad guys get billions of bailouts, and the good ones get laid off, get investigated by Eliot Spitzer, and then get the shallow victory of being right.",1284508800,8,1309,4.37603305785124
5152793,4,B002XLGOIG,"The Trade is a wonderful, real New York movie. It captures the beauty of the city in a unique way. The cast is great, and Judah Friedlander as a Wall Street guy is a hysterical change from his role on 30 Rock. Elizabeth Banks is super cute as well. Definitely worth checking out!",1272844800,2,279,4.283018867924528
5152794,4,B002XLGOIG,"I enjoyed watching  Elizabeth Banks before she hit it big, the story also sheds some insight on the world of a wall street trading desk..",1268784000,,137,4.48

8526833,1,B002XLGOIG,"Not sure why it's called ""The Trader"". The story has nothing unique about being a trader..the story line can apply to any one in any profession. The title is just a catchy phrase to grab attention. It is a shallow love story, low  budget movie.",1481500800,,244,4.4222222222222225
8526834,2,B002XLGOIG,acting was terrible.,1417219200,,20,6.0
8526835,3,B002XLGOIG,Its a pleasant romantic story with the edge of what happens to some degree in the Stock Market.,1415577600,,95,4.333333333333333
8526836,2,B002XLGOIG,this movie is a thriller,1413158400,,24,4.0
8526837,1,B002XLGOIG,"Wow Amazon, I want my money back for this one. A high school drama class could have put out better material. I could not finish it. Low budget amateur attempt at film making. I rent several movies each month and I can confidently say that this was the worst movie that I ever rented.",1410307200,2,283,4.2592592592592595
8526838,1,B002XLGOIG,Waste of money and time. They obviously didn't have a decent budget for this film.,1410220800,,82,4.533333333333333
8526839,1,B002XLGOIG,"Looks are deceiving, I saw Elizabeth Banks and I was sold...however, the cinematography was something that I could've produced with a 1984 handheld camera, I couldn't even watch 5 minutes....DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!",1410134400,2,215,5.352941176470588
8526840,1,B002XLGOIG,A word of advice; don't waste any of your precious time on this poorly written & equally inferior acting.,1409788800,,105,4.578947368421052
8526841,1,B002XLGOIG,"Wow was this was a bomb. The acting was horrible and really forced at times. Because I like E. Banks, I thought I'd give it a try. Big mistake.",1408320000,2,143,3.9655172413793105
