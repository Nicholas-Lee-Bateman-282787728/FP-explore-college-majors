Plot SPOILERS begin:

This time, Saif Ali Khan plays Rajveer Singh, a lowly pit crew tire changer who dreams of being a race car driver. One auspicious New York day, Rajveer inadvertently impresses a racing team manager with his driving skills AND bumps into (but then loses) the love of his life. Rajveer ends up being hired as the new driver for the downtrodden Speeding Saddles team. Finding the girl again proves to be more problematic. But Rajveer and the girl do meet again, and in that very same night. Her name is Radhika (Rani Mukerji), a pianist and daughter of a wealthy businessman. As Radhika and Rajveer (or RV, which is supposed to be a catchier name) fall in love, Rajveer's racing career skyrockets and, shortly, he becomes the nation's top car racer.

Even though her father predicts doom and gloom for her relationship with RV, Radhika marries him. Years elapse, and she gives birth to two beautiful children, Priya (aka ""Princess"") and Ranveer (aka ""Champ""). Life is beautiful for the Singh family, but, then, tragedy strikes when RV has a grievous racing accident which takes him out of competition for a year. Upon his return to the sport, it's quickly evident that RV has lost something (courage?). After several losses in a row, RV is let go by Speeding Saddles, and this ruins him financially. He's forced to auction off his posh home and move his family into the slum tenements of Cabby Alley. Wishing not to burden their children, RV and Radhika tell them that they're competing in a reality show called ""Don't Worry, Be Happy"" and that their move to Cabby Alley and their state of poorness are merely temporary. Thus, Radhika takes up tickling the ivory keys at restaurants and birthday parties while RJ picks up whatever menial jobs he can. But, as the bills mount and things become even more desperate, how long can RV and Radhika keep up the facade?

SPOILERS end.

It is absolutely the oh-so-compatible pairing of Saif Ali Khan and Rani Mukerji which makes the movie work. They're perfect foils for each other. Saif's casual, off-the-cuff charm naturally balances Rani's poised approach. Their characters, when together, present that ideal fusion in which individual flaws (RV's flighty, fun loving nature & Rani's too focused practicality) actually become strengths. Saif is able to use his imagination to endlessly lighten their grim situation. Radhika is the rock, steadfast and devoted to her husband and children. These are good parents.

TARA RUM PUM is instantly ingratiatingm, right from when a child's voice begins her film narration (""I love papa and his bad habits..."") and the flashbacks begin. Pretty much every character in this film is likable, with the exceptions of the sneering Rusty Finkelstein and the nasty Speeding Saddles owner. I've mentioned Saif and Rani ad nauseam, we know how good they are. But Jaaved Jaffrey (the Crocodile Dundee Hindi in SALAAM NAMASTE) also makes a mark as Harry, Saif's manager and friend. Meanwhile, the kids are cute, deliver solid performances, and don't get in the way.

TARA RUM PUM informs of the lengths parents will go thru to shield their children from the harshness of the real world. But it also tells of the sacrifices children will make for their parents. The movie's not as hokey as you'd think, thanks mostly to the quality of the acting and, by extension, the directing. Rani and Saif know when to restrain themselves while presenting a certain level of sincerity. When the dam does break and tears are shed, and the arguments and accusations fly, they are all the more effective. Yes, there's crying and arguing. Had to happen, they're only human. But, still, in this family's unflagging attempts to cope and overcome and maintain cheerful, positive dispositions even as life gives 'em dirt, the film becomes an engaging celebration of life. The racing sequences are competently staged. The song & dance numbers are mostly upbeat, including a live action/animated musical number in which tradition-mired Bollywood doesn't even allow CG bears to innocently kiss. I like the contemporary feel; it doesn't hurt that the story takes place in New York. TARA RUM PUM ends up being an endearing family feature with a hopeful message to impart. I've said this before, here it is again: Saif Ali Khan and Rani Mukerji need to team up again. And again. And then maybe one more. Although what am I talking about? I think Saif Ali Khan has chemistry with everybody. I wouldn't at all mind seeing him on the silver screen also paired up again with Preity Zinta or Deepika Padukone.",1329350400,,5585,5.2685393258426965

I found the racing scenes very realistic and thrilling. Overall, I truly enjoyed the chemistry between the main characters, and the co-stars, the children, made them seem like a real family.

This movie has a perfect medley of comedy, drama and action. This is one that a family could watch together, even with the English subtitles.",1289260800,,481,4.865853658536586
2893688,4,B000T2MZ2A,"... looks more like a real race car driver than most real race car drivers and he is very believable in TaRArumPUM.  I am a poor person to review this movie because I am burnt out on car racing of any kind - real or pretend. The first time I watched this DVD I fell asleep during the first race sequence. The second time I watched this DVD I selected Play All Songs and found it very enjoyable and worth the purchase for the music and dancing alone.  Then I watched the movie from beginning to end while fast forwarding through all the race scenes and found a pretty nice full length film still left.

Rani Mukherjee is again perfect in every way. Early in the story she plays a very cute tipsy girl stuck in a date with a useless yuppie type. Her magnetism from this scene carries over into a wild street dance with Saif Khan. All the actors (including the child actors) turn in 5-star performances in what I see as a 3-star film so I give it a 4.",1266278400,,948,4.169398907103825
2893689,3,B000T2MZ2A,"This is a sentimental cheesy family movie.
In brief it starts with a romance between a rich girl Rani Mukergee) and struggling young man (Saif Ali Khan) who, with her support, becomes a famous racing driver. Needless to say, there is a setback and the family faces challenges before a late rise in fortunes.
The couple's 2 kids feature from early in the movie so the story is about a family maintaining cheerfulness through the ups and downs of life. It is very much 'family in focus and includes a Disneyesque fusion of animation and the family dancing in one song.
There is one very catchy dance number near the beginning. The rest were Ok but, for me, not as memorable.
All the actors were good. I like Saif and Rani as actors and there chemistry always works when paired up (as they have been in several movies). Support actors are also good (particularly Javed Jaffrey who plays a friend of the couple).
The cinematography is good and race scenes suitably well-filmed and tense.
It was fine to watch once and I enjoyed the performances but I didn't feel a compulsion to revisit it. I felt a little disengaged and I'm not sure why. Despite a few tears shed by Rani my emotions weren't hooked enough. This may have also been because of the resolute upbeat quality of the characters that didn't make give me a heartfelt message (which I like) but rather seemed more like a more two-dimensional kids movie about being nice. The main characters seemed stubborn at a few crucial points and this ended up being celebrated as 'going with their pride' in a way that undermined sympathy. Did they really learn of were their fortunes just magically restored for a happy ending.
However as this movie seems to often rate around average perhaps others had that reaction. Fine family viewing but I have movies by Saif and Rani that I enjoyed more.",1235260800,,1838,4.641104294478527

Meanwhile, the kids are cute, deliver solid performances, and don't get in the way.

Sensing that I'd enjoy this movie, naturally, I purchased the handsome 2 dvd set. Disc one has the feature film. Disc 2 doesn't have English sub-titles but does contain the following: the 21-minutes-long ""Making Of"" feature; a ""Making of the Animated Song"" featurette; almost 3 minutes of outtakes; 46 seconds deleted from the melodic title song; 16 minutes of deleted scenes, which are worth viewing as they do serve to fill in and round out several moments in the film (why the kids sleep in the hammocks, the intro of the Cabby Alley folks, Radhika and RV doing accounts in his cab, etc.); and the theatrical and TV promos. The dvd package also comes with a ""Family Photo Frame"" in which you can stick on pictures of your family. Overall, not bad special features. And the cast and crew converse in enough English that you do get a sense of what's going on, even if you don't speak Hindi (like me).
