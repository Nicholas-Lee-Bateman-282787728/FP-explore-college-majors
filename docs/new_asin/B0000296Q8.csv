1252277,5,B0000296Q8,"We have viewed Baby Einstein and Baby Bach with our 1 yr old daughter since she was 3 months old.  This series of videos is DIFFERENT from anything I've ever seen on the market today.  Their content is based on  research around what BABIES actually LIKE to see, what THEY find visually  stimulating.  The real world items, toys, and both animate and inanimate  object which appear on screen, viewed UP CLOSE, in very short segments  (10-20 seconds), on alternating BLACK and WHITE backgrounds LITERALLY  CAPTIVATED our infant daughter.  The classical music on Baby Bach even  soothed her (and us! ) to sleep sometimes...a miracle for our, then, very  fussy newborn.  We enjoy the various languages spoken on Baby Eistein and  actually learned a few catch phrases through repetition.  While Baby  Einstein is clearly NOT designed to teach children how to speak a foreign  language, they ARE designed to stimulate areas of the brain which would  otherwise be ignored in a child not exposed to such foreign  sounds/language....the idea being that perhaps later in life, should she  choose to learn this language, it would be easier for her to orally produce  the sounds of the foreign language not present in her mother  tongue--English.  Primarily these videos are a pleasure to watch, they are  fun, we LOVE and anticipate the arrival of the various segments throughout.  I take great joy in knowing that these videos can be enjoyed by our family  without comprising our keen desire to provide primarily only educational  viewing content.  I HIGHLY recommend these to friends/families and they  make a VERY UNIQUE gift to those who are expecting.",954547200,21,1645,5.014869888475836
1252278,5,B0000296Q8,"I am a Grandmother of twins, boy and girl, and they received the Baby Einstein video when they were about 3 months old and they loved it.  Since I have bought them all of Julie Clark's videos and they will sit, watch,  laugh, jump and interact with those video.  I recommend them highly.",952646400,4,287,4.377358490566038

1252280,5,B0000296Q8,"I first purchased Baby Bach for my granddaughter who absolutely loved it.  I then purchased her the other two videos:  Baby Mozart and Baby Einstein. All three are excellent for not only their music, but also their content.  She sits mesmerized by each of them for the entire video.  (Each one is  thirty minutes long.)  They are excellent for parental (or grandparental)  interaction.  She has learned colors, objects, and counting along with the  nursery rhymes and music. I would highly recommend them to anyone with a  young child. I am now purchasing them as baby shower gifts.",943315200,69,582,4.907216494845361
7915566,5,B0000296Q8,"First time mother of a 3 month old: I started my daughter on baby Mozart at 1 1/2 months and she loved it! Her eyes about sprung out of her head and her bouncy seat went-a-bouncin away! She was very quiet and absorbed every bit of it. I think it is the bright colors, music and action she loves about it. I just last night bought her baby Van Gogh and she seemed to like it. Her eyes were glued to the tv but she made a lot of noises so I assumed she did not care too much for the music and voices. As for baby Einstein- HATED IT! She cried till I turned it off and believe me I keep trying her on it and she will not budge. I have not given up yet! I am sure when she gets a little older she will enjoy it. Great tapes! Baby Doolittle is my next purchase along with baby Shakespeare. If you want a little time to yourself or to take a shower or to even eat, buy these tapes! Very stimulating and entertaining for a baby!",1012348800,2,921,3.878306878306878
7915567,5,B0000296Q8,"These video's are a life saver!  I received these videos as a shower gift and thought at first they were a silly present.  I put one in when my daughter was four months old and could not believe her reaction to it!  She loves them!  She will sit and watch these videos the whole 30 minutes that they play for!  She will cry when it is over and I have to put in a new one.  It gives me a little free time to get things done around the house!  I feel the first review for the videos, by american working mom, sums it up perfectly!  The Erin girl that wrote the review has no clue what she is talking about.  Wait till she has kids she will buy every video they make for her children!  I now give these videos as shower gifts to people too.  My daughter is one now and still enjoys them! These videos deserve 10 stars!!",1009670400,,816,4.0062111801242235
7915568,5,B0000296Q8,"My best friend gave me the baby Mozart video when my son was just 2 months old. Believe it or not he actually sat through and watched the whole entire video. The older he gets the more he loves it. He can be really fussy and I put in baby Mozart and he is at peace. I love the fact that it is classical music and teaching him shapes and colors. I just added baby Doolittle, baby Bach, baby Einstein and baby Santa to our collection. My son who is now 4 months adores all of them! I would reccomend them for anyone!",1004918400,4,514,4.0
7915569,3,B0000296Q8,"Moms and Dads, I have been browsing the Internet and came upon this item and decided to read the reviews.  While I am not a parent yet, I have babysat for many years and was curious to see what people thought of these videos as I watched them with the one year old I babysat for and was not that impressed.",1004486400,,306,4.016393442622951
7915570,5,B0000296Q8,"I bought these videos after my son was visiting a prospective babysitter.  She had one of the videos on and he couldn't take his eyes off of it.  Now we have them at home and it's great.  I'll put him in his pumpkin seat in front of the TV while I'm doing housework - and he'll sit and watch a video for 20-30 min. at a time.  When he's watching them, he'll start screaming in excitement - kicking his arms and legs.  I can't believe a video can be so entertaining for such a young baby.  They're great.",1001030400,4,503,4.081632653061225
7915571,3,B0000296Q8,"We purchased this exact item from Amazon, not long ago, because our baby (like everyone elses'!) LOVES the Baby Mozart video.  It's a sure-fire cure for anything that ails her, and I highly recommend it.  I won't bother repeating the praise already written here.  Our daughter was a bit *less* thrilled with the other two tapes included in this pack.  Baby Bach is enjoyable, but nowhere near the magic of Baby Mozart (I hate to say it, but Bach's music isn't as fun for babies, either).  I agree with the other reviewers that creator Julie Aigner-Clark featured her children FAR too much, to the extent that you may feel you're watching her home videos.  Her older daughter cannot be understood in the cutesy audio clips.  It will drive you a little crazy.  Our daughter enjoys the tape, but not as much as her #1 choice above.  She is actually frightened by part of it (the sledding kids), though I'm not sure why.  Baby Einstein was a disappointment for me, because I'm a foreign language enthusiast--I didn't expect to find it boring, but I do.  Our daughter still enjoys watching the images on the screen, however.  *Most Importantly* -- I feel that potential purchasers should know--the videos come shrink-wrapped *together*.  We already had a copy of Baby Mozart, so I had planned to give the new one away as a gift.  This wasn't possible, since once I opened the pack, it wasn't ""new"" anymore.  Also, the CD included is a 20 minute long *sampler* of the other soundtracks available from the Baby Einstein company.  It comes in a cardboard envelope.  I purchased this set for $40 (it has dropped in price since then) and ended up feeling like I should have bought each item separately, and skipped the CD altogether.",973814400,68,1723,4.709030100334449
7915572,5,B0000296Q8,"At first, our 8 month old daughter did not pay much attention to this video series. She liked the Baby Smart Start and So Smart! videos that she was already familiar with. We played the video while she was playing on the  floor and within a week she was watching the videos and enjoying them.  Ditto to the other reviewers about the poor audio and the over use of the  producer's kids in the Bach video. This set completed our infant video  library so our daughter would have variety.",962928000,8,484,4.404494382022472
7915573,5,B0000296Q8,"These videos are GREAT!  My 7month old is absolutely mesmerized for the entire 30minutes of each.  We started her out at 1month and she seems to enjoy them more each time she sees them.  Good to buy tired Moms & Dads  a 30min break now and then.  If your kid is going to watch TV anyway, this  is prob better than the rugrats....  Only prob was the recording tape  quality was poor in place .. might be worth getting the DVD version.",960336000,4,433,4.195121951219512
7915574,5,B0000296Q8,"I sent this video series to my grandson Jamie when he was six months old.  I visited him last week and watched as he was transfixed for 2 of these tapes. He responded to the screen by laughing and kicking his feet.  I  enjoyed it as well, the toys are adorable and the music is very soothing.",956793600,4,292,4.087719298245614
