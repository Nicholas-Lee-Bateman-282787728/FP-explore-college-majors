I would recommend it for children as a form of entertainment.",1321660800,,153,4.5
7898668,5,6305951527,"Of all the power rangers episodes I've seen, the writing of this video is one of the best. The mysterious appearance of an evil ranger turns out to be the long lost brother of the Pink Ranger, and their father runs the Power Ranger operation! Please ignore the fact that although the monsters recently escaped their prison, somehow they got a hold of Ryan (the Titanium Ranger) some 15 years ago. Think to deeply and you'll ruin the fun. These shows remind me of the hokiness of Ultraman(if you're under 30 - don't ask)with the morality of the Brady Bunch. These guys just kick more butt. Definately a keeper.",996624000,4,609,4.5963302752293576
7898669,4,6305951527,"I picked up this video a few days ago, and its awsome. It features four lightspeed rescue episodes. Its almost worth the money I spent, becuase it has no commercials, and its beats the tv quality 10 to 1. Its really worth  it, espetially if you don't have the episodes on tape, since it features  the titanium ranger!",961891200,4,317,4.448275862068965
7898670,5,6305951527,"Since I am a power ranger fan I enjoyed this movie a lot.  For a person  who watches Power Rangers the content shouldn't be a surprise.  there is  fighting and there is a moral to the story.  Parents that are concerened  about the violence for their children needn't worry if their kids are Power  Rangers regulars.  Your kids however will get extremely excited when they  see this movie, it's action packed and it adds to the mysterious story of  the Titanium Ranger.",960681600,,468,4.597560975609756
