1647337,5,B00005QCV8,This DVD is GREAT for anybody who likes a BSB song. You get to see the whole music video(no clips) of their greatest hits! The quality is GREAT. The music videos are just wonderful to see on your tv - No more frustration trying to see it on the Internet.,1005868800,,254,4.1
1647338,4,B00005QCV8,"This is an awsome DVD.  I've been waiting so long for the boys to release something with all their great videos.  I'm very disappointed that they didn't include ""Drowning"" on it.  I think it should've been a part of this collection since it's on the CD. It's also one of their best songs ever.  I do think, however, if you are a devoted Backstreet fan like myself, this is a must for your collection.",1005782400,,400,4.364864864864865
1647339,4,B00005QCV8,"this dvd is really good,it's a great source for all the videos, it could of been better if they put all the videos they have ever made including drowning and we've got it going on. DVD's are supposed to be filled with extra stuff and this is just the videos so if you want behind the scenes stuff this isn't for you,if you just want a video library of their popular songs this is the best. don't expect anything more than the videos though. I recommend buying it,if you love em get it!!!",1005782400,,487,4.247311827956989
1647340,5,B00005QCV8,"I think this is great..every video ready to watch at just the pop in of one VHS tape.  All their videos are classics, who wouldn't want to own this and relive all those video moments? My only complaint is this (not really a complaint, but something to wonder about)..the Drowning video was not included on here, I feel as if it needed to be a part of this tape.",1005436800,,361,4.231884057971015
1647341,5,B00005QCV8,Hey guyz don't miss the chapter one they all look gorgrous in the Drowning video this time the Backstreet boys are really BACK!! Because this dvd or vhs will let you dance off the cieling of seeing them so beautiful!!!!!,1005177600,,220,4.525
1647342,3,B00005QCV8,"The Boys know how to do a good video, and this is a good transfer of their body of work.  Unfortunately, that's it.  There's nothing special about this DVD that takes advantage of the medium.  No stills, no interview footage, no timeline, two web links (both official sites).  There's also no excuse for the complete absence of ""Drowning"" from the disc (at least an audio track would have a nice touch if the video wasn't ready in time to be included).  Well worth having if you're a fan, especially if you've got the other videos on tape, but it is only the minimum of what should be expected of a major DVD release.",1005177600,4,617,4.424778761061947
1647343,5,B00005QCV8,"I'm so glad the guys finally made a collection of their videos.  I've been wanting the ""I want it that way"" video ever since it came out, and now I've got it!  I hope everyone who buys this video/DVD loves it.  Keep on supporting the BSB!!!  I love you Nick, thanks for meeting me in Chicago!!!!",1005004800,2,295,4.214285714285714
1647344,4,B00005QCV8,"As soon as I read the back of the CD ""the hits-Chapter One,"" I deemed it an instant classic and one of the best compilation CDs ever compiled.  This band has had so much success--and now here is the companion to the CD, the music videos for each song.  This is a great DVD if you love the Backstreet Boys.  I think the only people that will even consider buying it are people like me that love everything Backstreet.  I've always loved Backstreet videos, and I finally have all of the hits in one place, and I don't have to watch hours of MTV to get them!  The only reason I gave this 4 instead of five stars is that I think they should've released a more ""concert"" type video with live performances.  I love music videos, but nothing beats the Backstreet Boys harmonizing on a stage.",1004832000,23,784,4.299319727891157

Buenas canciones y buenos videos que se pueden ver en familia. Lstima que no hayan puesto todos los videos que el grupo haba hecho hasta ese momento, como ""Drowning"" y ""Get Down"".

1647399,5,B00005QCV8,"As usual, the American edition contains fewer videos than the European counterpart. In addition to those on the US cut, the videos for We've Got It Goin' On, Anywhere For You and Get Down (You're The One For Me) are in the Euro pressing.

A different style is used here. There's a short presentation with the boys introducing themselves. Preceding each song is also the name of the song and a short sample, so you know what to expect. There are subtitles too, for those who want to sing along. I am very pleased with the excellent audio and video quality here.

With 15 groundbreaking videos, The Greatest Video Hits - Chapter One is a great companion to the European CD comprising 16 of their best songs.",1312848000,,705,4.543307086614173

Watching this DVD made my head go nutts on childhood memories.  I remember being a kid, dancing infront of my t.v along to their moves. This BSB DVD will not dissapoint.

1647403,2,B00005QCV8,"Well as a Backstreet Boys fan I'm glad to have a dvd of all their music videos but I am very disappointed that for the videos of ""Everybody (Backstreet's Back)"" and ""All I Have To Give"" they only have the short edited versions and not the full versions. I find this to be very ridiculous. And also that the video for ""Drowning"" isn't on there. It's on the ""Greatest Hits"" cd so why not be on the DVD as well?

This DVD is a real disappointment. Only get it if you don't have high expectations.",1255996800,,493,4.189473684210526

So i've got it out now and i'll get a chance to watch these music video and there's one missing on this hits---- Drowning (three other music videos are missing as well: We got going on, Anywhere for you & Get down (you're one for me)on this DVD).
Might could wait longer for the another hits in the near future soon.",1226620800,,534,4.095238095238095

They really did a great job of compiling they're videos to get the best of the best.  Also, I prefer not to have concert scenes, they can do that in a seperate disc. If you love the Backstreet boys, you've got to get this DVD! I love it and I'm 46 years old!  So its just not for a certain age group! Great DVD!",1219363200,,450,3.806451612903226

The only reason why I give this DVD a 4-star rating instead of five is because of the fact that the region 1 disk here only has the American/ Canadian hits. Hits like We've Got It Goin' On or Get Down (You're the One For Me) aren't present. Another disappointment would be the lack of the new song on The Hits CD - Drowning. The music video for Drowning isn't on this DVD, so if you wanted to buy this DVD for that purpose, you should look elsewhere for it. The DVD is amazing, though, and included my favourite video: The Call. Check it out!",1206489600,,801,4.34

I admit, I was a fan back in by college listening to this stuff, and it's really good stuff. Sure, it's very cheesy and the little girls liked them too at the time, but I'm 33 years old now and even I can appreciate the musical talents of these 5 guys. This DVD package includes their hits from their first 3 albums and it's truly their best stuff. The crazy video ""Everybody"" is worth the price of admission. It's the Ultimate Halloween video. The classic ""I Want It That Way"" sounds better than ever and you'll want to play it over and over. Larger Than Life, Show Me The Meaning of Being Lonely, Quit Playing Games W/My Heart, As Long As You Love Me and tons more--- what's not to like?

The best part of this DVD is hearing in Dolby Digital 5.1 and people with high end speakers will want to jam hard with this stuff. People make fun of these guys all the time, but the fans know this is music worth listening to and with their new album out too, it shows they still have a niche for music lovers.

The only new track from 2001's THE HITS CHAPTER ONE is DROWNING. The BSB's female fans were admiring the group seeing and reading about them in magazines such as 16,Bop and Teen Beat.

It is also a chance to see them grown up from boys into men and how they their style changes over time. The later videos, larger then life, shape of my heart and many of the latter ones are great whilst some of the earlier ones look a bit the same and the music is the only difference like they were not quite sure what to do with the music and not quite sure what to do with the band in these videos.

Also, if you are able, I recommend you purchase the European version which also includes three videos never released in the US ""We've Got It Going On"", ""Anywhere For You"" and ""Get Down"" all released in 1995-1996 just before BSB really begin to break through here in the states.",1035244800,2,692,4.372093023255814

I admit I was a little disappointed that ""Drowning"" is not on the DVD but then it was still on TRL at the time so they must have wanted us to vote and watch on TV instead.  I recorded it the first time I saw it any way, LOL!  All the Backstreet videos are just sooooo incredible, I have been a fan for a long time and it moves me so much to see their musical and physical changes through all the videos from We've Got It Goin' On (YES, WE HAVE THAT ON OUR AUSTRALIAN VERSION NOT THE USA VERSION BECAUSE THE SONG WAS NEVER RELEASED THERE!) all the way through to More than That.  I'm overwhelmed with pride for all this group has achieved and will achieve in the many more years to come.  I knew from the first moment I heard them they were going to make it to the big time and boy was I right!
This is indeed a DVD that all BSB fans must have, it is a milestone in the Boys' career, a compilation of their success, creative flair and wonderful imagination.  We all know Backstreet videos have always captured us because they are so well made, SO GO AND BUY IT, WORTH EVERY DOLLAR YOU SPEND!!!!

You can literally see the boys grow up in front of your eyes and every stage they go through by their music videos and songs! It's truly AMAZING and every Backstreet fan should get it! It's the BEST out there and it brought back many great memories for me :0) So if you don't have it yet, GO GET IT! Also, don't forget to get Nick's album ""Before The Boys: 1989-1993""... Peace!

Most likely if you're deciding whether or not to purchase this video you're a Backstreet fan, so you've seen all these videos. You may have even had all of them recorded from TRL and some of them you may already own on other BSB home videos. So you may ask yourself, why buy this? One reason is because it has a different version of Everybody (Backstreet's Back). It's the video to the original version instead of the extended version which is on the All Access video. Even though the song itself is shorter, this version includes scenes that were not included in the other one. This is also the first time the videos from Millennium and Black & Blue have been put on home VHS or DVD. Even if you recorded them from the TV like I did, if you buy this, you will get all those videos with better sound and picture quality. The only problem is that Drowning is not included. I recorded the TRL premiere of that, with the bad sound quaility and the TRL and MTV symbols on the screen. Well, I would also have liked them to use the Neptunes remix of The Call because it has even more footage than the original, but that's OK. Buy this video and you will get perfect versions of almost all of their videos.",1009756800,3,1274,4.225409836065574
1647448,5,B00005QCV8,"I was hyped when New Kids on the Block came out with a Greatest Hits video, and now BSB.  I feel like I'm in pop heaven.  Due to the way how TRL works, I haven't seen over half of these videos without those annoying interruptions.  I just bought the video today, and I absolutely loved watching the videos of their greatest hits.  The videos of ""Quit Playing Games"", ""Everybody"", ""Larger Than Life"", and ""More Than That"" are my favorites.  I was just surprised that neither version of ""Drowning"" was on the video as the guys filmed two versions of it.  Nevertheless, the video was a great buy, and I am very pleased with it.  I hope the guys keep up the good work!",1009411200,,664,4.349593495934959
1647449,5,B00005QCV8,"I've been a huge avid fan of the Backstreet Boys since '97, and I own all their albums. I've seen all their music videos on MTV and the Disney Channel. And now, after they recorded HITS - CHAPTER ONE, the album, they came out with this amazing complication DVD featuring all of their hit music videos, except for their new song, ""Drowning"" (which can only be found on the CD-Single and the hits album). That is the only disappointing thing about this DVD. Oh well. I actually think the music video is on the CD-Single for ""Drowning"" because I think the CD-Single is enchanced, so it might show the video. But anyway, this is the full-list of all the music videos you will see on this DVD (not in the correct order):
""Quit Playin' Games (With My Heart)"" ~ BACKSTREET BOYS (1997)
""As Long As You Love Me"" ~ BACKSTREET BOYS (1997)
""Everybody (Backstreet's Back)"" ~ BACKSTREET BOYS (1997)
""I'll Never Break Your Heart"" ~ BACKSTREET BOYS (1998)
""All I Have To Give"" ~ BACKSTREET BOYS (1998)
""I Want It That Way"" ~ MILLENNIUM (1999)
""Larger Than Life"" ~ MILLENNIUM (1999)
""Show Me The Meaning Of Being Lonely"" ~ MILLENNIUM (1999)
""Shape Of My Heart"" ~ BLACK & BLUE (2000)
""The Call"" ~ BLACK & BLUE (2000)
""More Than That"" ~ BLACK & BLUE (2000)
Of course, they always miss out on some of their hit songs like ""We've Got It Goin' On"" (the very first single in late 1996, which is off their BACKSTREET BOYS album); ""What Makes You Different (Makes You Beautiful)"" - I don't think they've made a music video for that but it was a single for some short time, and possibly one of their best love ballads ever, and several other songs that were International singles. I do not understand why they cannot put International music videos on a music video DVD that is released in the US. That only forces the hardcore fans to buy the International versions of the DVDs instead of the US version.
I also feel as though this complication DVD is not complete because they could have added more to it like interviews with the Backstreet Boys, snipets of their concerts, photo galleries, biographies, some extra bonus BSB footage, and other things that would make a fan pleased. But all in all, as far as the music videos go, this is an excellent collection of all the BSB's hit music videos and a must have for all die-heart BSB fans. Now, you don't have to go rushing to tape all of their music videos every time you see them on MTV or the Disney Channel!
~P.S.: The DVD sound and picture quality is excellent and top-notch. The BSB deserve all the credit and success they have achieved and more!!~",1008633600,15,2578,4.498933901918977
1647450,5,B00005QCV8,"It captured a quite long history of one band that actually very good careers in music industry. Personally, I consider this as great greatest hits compilation among others and Backstreet Boys actually has proof themselves as one of big band around the world. Drowning also a very nice song and after I saw the clips, it's very sad to not have them in the DVD.",1008201600,,359,4.538461538461538
1647451,3,B00005QCV8,"This is great but the complants seems to be the same and there are that some of the first BSB album videos are not on the disk.
This may be due to the first album only comming out in Europe and it was a huge sucess in my country of England. On the region 2 version of this those videos are included there is more than the 12 inculded on the region 1 disk. Downing however is not on the region 2 either but We got it going on is and the other video mentioned by reviewers. So go to amazon.co.uk and get the region 2 disk and while you are there get the UK version of Chapter 1 on cd as well its got more on it too.",1008028800,,613,3.75968992248062
1647452,4,B00005QCV8,"This video rock, i can see all the greatest BSB music video in just 1 dvd.  But I would give this video 4 stars, becasue I think they should include thier latest music video Drowning, I love this song so much, and the video is beatuiful.  Also I think they should put some very early music videos from the guys like their 1st music video ""We've Got It Going On"", because many BSB fans never have a chance to see this video.",1006473600,2,423,4.146341463414634
1647453,4,B00005QCV8,"This DVD is excellent! It gives you a chance to see just how much the boys have changed over the years from their early videos to their most recent. Only one thing prevents me from giving the DVD 5 stars, and that is that despite there being 16 songs on the CD, there are only 12 videos on the DVD. Very early songs such as 'We've Got It Goin' On' and 'Get Down (You're The One For Me)', are not on there and neither is the video for the latest single Drowning, despite what it says in the editorial review! (Did anybody actually review this or just read the back of the CD?!)
Despite this however, my personal favourite videos of Everybody (Backstreets Back), The Call and Larger Than Life are on there meaning I can watch and drool over the boys whenever I want!
All in all, a good DVD and one I definitely recommend to any BSB fan.",1006214400,2,834,4.21875
