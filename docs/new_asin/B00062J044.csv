8214781,5,B00062J044,I found this story to be very educational as far teaching the story of courage and interesting to teach us the story of how the love of a dog knows no bounds as to how far he will go to show a boy how to reach out and accept certain cicumstances and limitations on ones surroundings. Elmer will touch your heart and make you cheer for the hero(even when a skunk is involved).You'll love it.,1256515200,,390,4.213333333333333
