527021,5,6302986338,"This is the second film that teamed director Delmer Daves and teen idol  Troy Donahue. Despite its notoriously poor reviews, this is a very good  film in the context of the soap opera genre and extends beyond many  inherent bounds of that genre for its sheer entertainment. This is good  filmmaking. Delmer Daves was the consummate professional, being a  meticulous craftsman. His films were beautifully photographed; many times  employing difficult crane shots to incorporate the characters into their  environment from which he contrasted their own conflicts. This film is no  exception as it deals with the struggle for control over Connecticut's  tobacco farming industry. The main antagonist is the all-powerful Judd  Raike (Karl Malden) who intends to buy out the entire valley. His main  nemesis is the noble Sala Post (Dean Jagger) who stands for uncompromising  integrity. Parrish MacLean (Troy Donahue) and his mother, Ellen (Claudette  Colbert) arrive in tobacco country from Boston and become involved in the  conflict. Along the way Donahue finds three love interests: Connie Stevens,  Diane McBain and Sharon Hugueny. Critics at the time criticized Malden's  maniacal performance, but in light of today's cutthroat business tactics it  seems right on target. However, I always best admired Jagger's mild but  dignified performance. Much of the location photography was filmed in  Connecticut (the Sala Post house in Middlefield, the Charles W. Morgan  whaling ship at Mystic Seaport, the Connecticut River ferryboat  photographed from Gillette's Castle, the Congregational Church in Essex for  wedding scenes, the Tara Mare Resort Hotel and Marina at Saybrook Point,  the United States Navy submarine base at Groton and Tobacco Fields and  Sheds in Hartford County were all featured). Having lived in Connecticut  all my life, I can really appreciate the authenticity and craftsmanship  that was put into this film. It is a beautiful film very much enhanced by  Max Steiner's evocative young-at-heart score. They don't make them like  this anymore. This film was based on the novel by Connecticut's own Mildred  Savage. I highly recommend this motion picture. This print on Warner's VHS  is very good.",965865600,94,2215,5.391812865497076
527022,5,6302986338,"My mother first saw this film when she was 10 or 11 years old.  She knew from then on she would have a daughter named Paige.  My mother purchased a copy of this film as a gift for my 29th birthday.  We watched it together.  The symbolism and the moral message of the film are applicable to today:  money, power & sex.  Not necessarily in that order. In my opinion,  Father Rake was in dire need of lithium.  The fact the word pregnant was  used in an early 1960's film dropped my jaw. I would love to read the book,  but I have not been able to find a copy.  This is not much of a review.  If  it were, I would far exceed the 1000 word limit.  Those who find this movie  sappy and stupid should overlook the acting and delve a little deeper into  the message.",943574400,11,759,4.027027027027027

527024,4,6302986338,"I saw the movie when it was first released and I must say I enjoyed it at a younger age than I am now; however, what I do recall was the musical score.

The film is soapy and, at times, downright stupid, but for whatever reason, I enjoy it more each time I see it! Diane McBain is great as the super spoiled Allison.  Sharon Hugueny made her film debut here as the sweet Paige Raike.  Also recommended, ""A Summer Place"" and ""Rome Adventure"".",911692800,5,445,4.620253164556962

527241,4,6302986338,"Troy Donahue was not a great actor, but his good looks were enough to get him cast in several popular films of the early 60s, the best of which is Parrish, the movie adaptation of the Mildred Savage novel of the same name. And Donahue was perfect for this role as Parrish McLean, the handsome blonde lad who showed up in the tobacco country of Connecticut for reasons not spelled out,  setting several hearts fluttering in the processthree different types of women -- from the sweet innocent school girl to the not-so-innocent spoiled debutante to the sleep-around farm girl.

Parrishs mother, Ellen, is played by Claudette Colbert with stylish grace, and this was to be her last movie, even though she lived to age 96. Karl Malden, as the ruthless tobacco magnate, Judd Raike takes a shine to Ellen and the two are married, though not forever, as Judds drive to own-it-all becomes fully apparent to the disillusioned Ellen.

Parrishs three love interests come in the form of Connie Stevens as the highly available field hand who initially gets Parrishs attention until he is distracted by the scheming Alison Post, played by Diane McBain, who reminds one in many ways of Kim Novak. The scenes in which she appears are a superb example of some of the best cinematic lighting ever seen. But great lighting ultimately exposes her devious and user nature . . . and Parrish turns to a different choice of women at this films end.

We are also treated to the always satisfying presence of Dean Jagger, Alisons father and the most level-headed grower in this rich tobacco valley.

Parrish is an entertaining, well-written and directed motion picture and holds its own quite well all these years since its debut in 1961.

Tobacco is no longer king or even prince in the USA..so the emphasis on the beauty, power, and obsession with tobacco growing loses impact.

The three women in the film are stereotyped ad nausea: the ""fast"" (as mother used to say) with the good heart who can't say no to the bad guy; the beautiful, spoiled girl who really is the ""slut"" in words and actions; and the sweet, innocent, untouched and pure ""good"" girl.  All three are supposed to be providing the protaganist, Parrish (Troy), his first expereinces in love.  From fast, to sophicated slut, to good girl innocence.  Whose idea of expereince is that?  Purely a figment of a romantized imagination..obviously the author of the book upon which the movie is based.

But, got to admit it is worth watching if only for the excellent performances of the ""older"" cast namely Karl Malden, Dean Jagger, and Claudette Cobert.  and the fact that it does reflect some warped social attitudes and prejudices of the early 60's.

This is really a Troy Donahue film. I never really cared for Karl Malden but I have to say(in his defense) that he was really well cast in his role.

The story is about 3 families in Connecticut that farm Tobacco plants for the leaves for Cigars. Karl Malden plays a ruthless power hungry man who wants to own it all and will stop at nothing. Claudette Colbert plays the woman he marries and Troy Donahue her son from a previous marriage who shows Karl Malden what its like to fight back.

But, it was a story and movie that I always remembered so when it became available on DVD I ordered it. It's beautifully remastered. The only fault that I found with the movie was that Claudette Colbert just didn't seem to me to quite right for the part. I had in mind maybe Olivia DeHavilland who would have been much more likely to have won the heart of someone like Judd Raike  but then, again, maybe not. Rather than thinking, as some have said, that Carl Malden overplayed Judd Raike, I thought he did a wonderful job and I don't even like Carl Malden. Could never get past the nose. But he was Judd Raike as if the part had been written for him. Connie Stevens brings her own vulnerability to every role she plays and she was perfect for this.

I believe it describes the social history of that time very well and think it was one of the best movies from the 1960's era; and Troy Donahue was such a gorgeous hunk. From that time I have been wanting to watch it again and for all those years I have inquired about it in every Video/DVD store I came across. The movie made such an impression on me at the time 15yrs later I named my daughter Paige after the young girl in the movie.
Thank you Amazon for allowing me to see it once more as it is not available for sale in Australia, however I believe it has been shown on cable TV very occasionally.

Beautifully filmed and you can almost smell the lush soil and budding tobacco plants. Romance flurishes with Parrish having his share of beautiful young ladies wanting his attention. Connie Stevens, Diane McBane and Sharon Hugoeny all do great jobs as the young ladies. If you like Connie Stevens as I do, check out Susan Slade which she stars in and is another lush and fun movie, with a message which was unusual for the early sixties. Okay, back to Parrish, great performances by Claudette Colbert in her last movie and also Karl Malden as the power hungry tobacco tycoon. Although remembered as a ""coming of age"" movie to some at the time I understand, I liked how the Parrish character held his ground and stayed true to his word and didn't sell out to the big corporation - a good message that is an important message in the film.

Or those ""late night"" comedies where it's either Wayne's World clone ""dewwds' on a quest for bimbos and pot, or feature-length copies of today's mean-spirited sitcoms. To most people, ""adult fare"" does not mean maturity, it means it's tawdry--the more tawdry the better. So I knew they wouldn't be interested in this one. So I use the term ""mature"" for this one--it inspred me to read the book and it's a good story in which twentysomethings act like real grownups rather than extended adolescents. The kind of thing you'd expect of Hollywood's original ""non-brat pack"". Here we've got Troy Donahue in the title role as a young guy who wants his independence, not necessarily to ""par-tay-har-tay"". Reviewers of this film (and the book) describe Parrish as a ""youthful rebel"", possibly to lure a viewerbase already becoming jaded and spoiled. Dean Jagger plays Conneticut tobacco grower Sala Post (this film teaches you that his name is pronounced a lot like ""sailor""), whose debutante daughter (Diane McBain) Parrish's mother (Claudette Colbert) has been hired to prepare the girl for her ""coming out"". Karl Malden plays Sala's biggest competitor Judd Raike, an ""empire-builder"" tobacco tycoon in the process of taking over and crowding out all other growers in the area. He has two sons, one a pale imitation of the father with all of the arrogance but none of the drive or backbone, the other a legitimate ancestor of today's ""par-tay-har-tay"" type. His drug of choice is expensive booze--today he'd be snorting coke, with weed as a chaser. Which is to say, the sons are two sides of the ""spoiled rich boy"" coin. Raike's youngest is incongruously a ""sweet young thing"" type daughter (Sharon Hugueny). Parrish variously romances Post's daughter, a girl he works the fields with (Connie Stevens) and the Raike girl, who we know is Miss Right even if she has a real S.O.B for a daddy. So here we have a film with four members of Brat Pack: The Previous Generation (Donahue, Stevens, McBain and Hugueny), who aren't as ""cool"" as the later `80s bunch were, but they were cool enough for the times. Guys like my housemates would be loudly and whinily bored with this flick, but it comes from a time when movies were about characters with real character. People you could respect rather than them impressing you with how shocking for its own sake they can behave. There are a few movies like that nowadays, but very few.

We were very pleased to know that they wanted Troy drive it in a movie. (and Claudette too) When we got it back, everyone took turns sitting in the drivers seat where Troy did. It is still an experience to see him drive it in this film even today. I was just 5 or 6 years old but I have a vivid recollection of this time period. When we drove this car with its top down, people would stop what they were doing. They would look as we drove by just because it was probably the most beautiful car of its time.
The movie was rich in music and color. The scenes are classic Conn. and its Tobacco industry. Mystic Seaport, Tara Mar Marina and Hotel where many movie stars docked their yachts for a few days. Many times we visited when Frank Sinatra docked, Marlon, Katherine Hepburn and countless others. Connecticut in the 60s was a nice era.

527465,5,6302986338,"Passion shared is still intensely interesting to behold. This romantic idea is conveyed with care, astute deliberation, and intelligent scriptwriting in this classic, beautifully-photographed romance (1961 vintage). Of course, there is only one Parrish in the movie vault. Our versatile suitor is portrayed by the handsome actor Troy Donahue. He is the immediate focal point for three women (Connie Stevens, Diane McBain, and Sharon Hugueny) in this professional film (directed by Delmer Daves). Nuances abound as Parrish connects with each woman with the utmost sincerity; as the story unfolds, frustrations mount, tempers flare, and feminine angst surfaces with the unfolding plotline.

His presence upsets our heroines; his smile drives the romantic plot right through the roof and into the blue sky above. Parrish presents the audience with subtle dramatic flurries. Each actor and actress (to their credit) provides an excellent interpretation of character and intent. And, we have not even mentioned passionate kissing. Waiting for that first kiss establishes good tension; which drives the crescendo from Act I to Act III. Truly excellent romantic dialogue, emotional pitch, truth, patient observance (by certain women), conflict, passionate embrace, acceptable intimacy (for that time), and humility are fully conveyed in this film. All non-romantic subplots dispense their importance by Act III for the final dramatic empathy (for the audience) within the controlling theme, one man-one woman-in love, by curtain time.

Just to watch this film is to revisit memories from that era; to see what it was like back then. Within that retrospection, it becomes easy to admire the beautiful country setting, the stunning cinematography, the emotive soundtrack, the simplicity of this almost-pastoral romance, and the richness of the film itself. These classic romances do herald a bygone era; yet they remain firm in their high standards of a professional storyline, a true crescendo, and a refined denouement. A true date movie if ever there was one.",1245196800,,2053,5.535031847133758
527466,5,6302986338,"PARRISH is the second film that teamed director Delmer Daves and teen idol Troy Donahue. Despite its notoriously poor reviews, this is a very good film in the context of the soap opera genre and extends beyond many inherent bounds of that genre for its sheer entertainment. This is good filmmaking. Delmer Daves was the consummate professional, being a meticulous craftsman. His films were beautifully photographed; many times employing difficult crane shots to incorporate the characters into their environment from which he contrasted their own conflicts. This film is no exception as it deals with the struggle for control over Connecticut's tobacco farming industry. The main antagonist is the all-powerful Judd Raike (Karl Malden) who intends to buy out the entire valley. His main nemesis is the noble Sala Post (Dean Jagger) who stands for uncompromising integrity. Parrish MacLean (Troy Donahue) and his mother, Ellen (Claudette Colbert) arrive in tobacco country from Boston and become involved in the conflict. Along the way Donahue finds three love interests: Connie Stevens, Diane McBain and Sharon Hugueny. Critics at the time criticized Malden's maniacal performance, but in light of today's cutthroat business tactics it seems right on target. However, I always best admired Jagger's mild but dignified performance. Much of the location photography was filmed in Connecticut (the Sala Post house in Middlefield, the Charles W. Morgan whaling ship at Mystic Seaport, the Connecticut River ferryboat photographed from Gillette's Castle, the Congregational Church in Essex for wedding scenes, the Tara Mare Resort Hotel and Marina at Saybrook Point, the United States Navy submarine base at Groton and Tobacco Fields and Sheds in Hartford County were all featured). Having lived in Connecticut all my life, I can really appreciate the authenticity and craftsmanship that was put into this film. It is a beautiful film very much enhanced by Max Steiner's evocative young-at-heart score. Steiner's score is very distinctive and musically iconic for the Troy Donahue films directed by Daves. They don't make them like this anymore. This film was based on the novel by Connecticut's own Mildred Savage. I highly recommend this motion picture.

Why has the status been not yet released suggesting that it is intended to be when the status hasn't changed in actually longer than six months? Are the producers just pulling our chain?  Will somebody make a decision now! I think there has been enough stalling on moving on this. Make it a DVD now! It is better than the multitude of garbage I see today on DVD that linger on the rental shelfs for eternity. Anybody who knows great films and appreciates films throughout the era of filmmaking knows of this film and wants it on DVD. So act now and stop the indecisiveness that seems to have the producers in the grip of indecision. There are many more great films that should have by now been on DVD.

And, Why can't the producers make a complete version of the films recorded on DVD instead of their sham of placing the deleted scenes on another section of the disk calling it a extra feature when the real version would be the extra feature. I want the original uncut, entire undeleted version of the movie and not this scam feature that actually is a deleted artificial version of the true film. This a is borderline crime to movie watchers. What's up with these people who seem to want the original version for themselves to possibly make money on later.

It is done in the disguise of censorship. Most movies I am talking about children don't watch. Second, the undeleted version is shown in the theaters. There are deletions that are done before relesase into the public. Why is there not director's cuts on every movie made? This sounds like greed or ignorance in action. It is about money. Make the full film and skip the feature of deleted scenes on another section of the disk. This is disingenuious to all movie watchers.

 I think ""Parrish"" has run into this because they are deciding which scenes to delete from the classic DVD because with the TV technology people will not have to see movies in theaters anymore when they can have a simulation of the theater in their home. Also they want to decide what scenes are deemed unsuitable for children when children won't watch them but even if they do, there are no unsuitable scenes. It's called don't let the people enjoy the movies, just think about how much more money they can make on them by reshowing the true uncut version in a movie theater later. These films will never be reshown in theaters again but later they can sell the true version and make people buy another copy, and they know people will buy another copy. This is conservative thoughtlessness in action. This is hypocrisy. Summing up we have inaction,ignorance, hypocrisy, greed and thoughtlessness, That sounds like the GOP, like many of those people with money.

So much junk is put out in DVD format yet a film like Magnificent Obsession is not.

Each character or relationship had it's own theme music which would swell as a new scene faded in from black, it was very subtle,but very effective. It put the audience back in contact with the characters without using additional dialog. In the first viewing you may not even be aware of what Daves and Steiner are doing. The same thing happens in A Summer Place,Rome Adventure,Susan Slade It really adds to the enjoyment of the film. Of course it only works when someone of Max Steiners talent scores the films. Delmar Daves,best known perhaps as a director of westerns certainly had the touch to direct romantic films with a message.

That being said, this is a good solid movie with exceptional acting from Malden, Jagger, Claudette Colbert, Dub Taylor and in his own way, Donahue, as the battle for control of prime tobacco land is fought out.
Malden may seem a little over the top in his portrayal of Judd but it is a perfect definition of a man who will stop at nothing to get what he wants.  It is this single-mindedness that strikes throughout the film.  Unfortunately, Malden is saddled with two ""nitwit"" sons who do little to take the pressure off.  Maybe this is part of what makes Malden's character what it is; the inability to delegate with confidence and so he is doubly forced to compensate for lack of talent in his own organization.  Donahue is seen as an unlikely allie for Malden.  However, Donahue is unable to acquire the ruthless instincts of Malden and eventually rebels.  He is seasoned by an enlistment in the Navy and the submarine service and then returns to do battle with Malden and his family.
There are a number of surprise topics that are tackled, Jagger accepts that he is a rather low key personality, so low key that his wife left him.  She was killed shortly thereafter leaving him to raise a daughter single-handedly.  He acknowledges that he has not been successful and the assistance of Claudette Colbert to manage her is of little avail.  Pregnancy, and if you like, adultery are openly talked about.  Loveless marriages litter the landscape of Connecticut throughout this film.
Jagger sees Donahue as a someone can resist Malden and stakes him to land and the opportunity to attempt to hold off Malden's attempts to control the land.  Donahue appears to be succeeding as the movie ends.  He has met the challenge of Malden, but you don't know if he will win; you think he will but you never really know.
This is an excellent film, capturing an industry and region that is little known.  The supporting cast is outstnading and gives the film depth that it needs to succeed.  The depiction of migrant labor is especially interesting; again because it is taking place in a region that one wouldn't expect to see it.
Parrish is a must for those with a love/longing for New England as it gives you a little of everything.  I highly recommend this film to all.",973814400,51,2552,4.6252771618625275

7832958,5,6302986338,"This turned out to be a good quality DVD with good picture and sound, no hissing, scratching, etc.  I'm not at all familiar with much in the way of technology, and there are so many little things to be aware of, so buying even a DVD is not easy for me.  When I saw the box, I was afraid I would be forced to endure those aggravating subtitles that are so very distracting (and ruin the movie for me), but to my pleasant surprise you have the choice of displaying them or not. Nothing to worry about with this DVD, it's in English with options for English, French and Korean subtitles, and has a region code of ALL.  Was fun to watch Troy again after all these years in this campy coming of age saga.",1519689600,,699,4.162962962962963
