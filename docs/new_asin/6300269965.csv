288247,4,6300269965,"I remember having a comic book based on this movie, but, I never got to see it when it was released.
Its been a long wait to see this movie, but, it was worth it.  If you want to see an alternate story of the race to the moon, then this is the movie for you.",1267315200,,258,3.607142857142857
288248,5,6300269965,"Countdown has been a long time favourite of mine - and like Marooned or the BBC series Moonbase 3 - one of the few attempts to present a realistic portrayal not only of the actual mechanics of space flight, but its politics as well. I've waited for Countdown to appear on DVD for years, and finally thanks to the Warner Brothers Archive imprint, it has finally happened. The menus are basic but perfectly functional, and the quality of the amamorphic widescreen transfer is well up to standard. All I hope is that this is a sign of things to come and that other studios begin to offer other titles which are wanted but not in sufficient numbers to justify a full scale DVD realise to market.",1255219200,23,691,4.492063492063492
288249,5,6300269965,"Many thanks to Warner Brothers for releasing these older and perhaps obscure movies in limited or on-demand DVD-R releases. I now have several of these films now which would otherwise not have been released. As someone who has been a video junkie since the late 70's and spent a small fortune on the pursuit of higher and higher quality copies of film and television materials, twenty or so dollars to purchase a near perfect quality dvd is one of the few modern miracles out there. For anybody sitting on the fence wondering about these relaeses, go for it! Thanks again!",1253318400,3,572,4.73
288250,3,6300269965,"Countdown, an early directorial effort by the legendary Robert Altman, is a solid little adventure story that is much better than most critics would have you believe. Top billed Robert Duvall and James Caan are astronauts preparing for a flight to the moon. They must deal with intense training, the inherent hazards of the mission and the concerns of their families. The plot is a familiar one and the attendant melodrama is old hat, yet this film, by virtue of its visual appeal and deliberate pacing, manages to build quite a head of steam before the final fadeout. Altman uses the panavision screen effectively, and the special effects are good for their time. Look for many familiar faces in the cast, including Ted Knight and Charles Aidman.",1246665600,2,747,4.889763779527559
288251,5,6300269965,"I think this movie is a precursor to several popular historical and realistic NASA based movies such as Apollo 13, The Right Stuff, and Marooned. It has the feel of the times in the 1960's during the build up to the first landing on the moon. The plot is somewhat dated and fictional but the interaction of the characters, the settings and locations, as well as the overall ""feel"" is realistic. It did come out in 1968 so it was made during the time when NASA was racing to meet President Kennedy's vision. The movie has some big names including Robert Altman the director, stars James Caan, and Robert Duvall. It also starred William Conrad, Barbara Baxley, and Ted Night and other familiar faces.

When is this coming out on DVD?",1237420800,10,731,4.580152671755725
288252,5,6300269965,"I agree with everything that's been said, and I'd also look to mention the completely lack of conflict within the movie. It's amazing, there's almost nothing to work against, and very little tension. Maybe it's because we know now that space flight was possible, but it's still amazing to see a movie about the moon landing where the plotline is: We wanted to go the moon, we trained to go the moon, and then we landed on the moon. There's about five minutes there where it looks like James Caan isn't going to find the docking station on the moon and die from a lack of oxygen...but then he turns around, and oh yeah! There it is! Just behind me.
Totally different style, but the only other movie I can think of like this is ""Payback,"" where Mel Gibson just kind of walks in and starts kicking .... He never gets capture, never gets put in trouble, just kinda shoots his way through to the final boss.
I wonder if the simplistic linearity of this film was created by the studio's re-edit of the film, or if that's largely true to Altman's idea? During the last five minutes of the film, as the character announces that he has five minutes of oxygen left and doesn't see the docking station, I thought it was going to be an Altmanesque last-minutes-to-live-final-soliloquy ending. But no. The space station was there all along. All you had to do with click your heels together, three times...",1039564800,2,1392,4.549800796812749
288302,3,6300269965,I didn't find this film particularly satisfying. I felt the melodrama leading up to the third act was drawn out and did little to wratchet up the tension. James Caan and Robert Duvall aren't bad in this film but they honestly don't have much to do beyond look stern and serious - they really have no character moments to speak of. The third act could have been something decent if they had any SFX to speak of... not one exterior shot of the space capsule... and once James Caan gets to the moon... the sets aren't bad but nothing is done to demmonstrate the difference in gravity... in other words you definitely don't feel like the character is on the moon... granted SFX aren't the point of this film.... it isn't a thrill ride but a fictional  exploration of the behind the scenes drama of getting a man to the moon. The film itself really does not have the RObert Altman trademarks you would come to expect such as his use of conversational dialogue.... all in all not a bad film but kind of boring and not overly satisfying. Hit Apollo 13 for the real life thrills and the Right Stuff for the true story and space race drama.... with those two in hand you can easily skip this.... this isn't terrible just not worth it.,1429833600,,1225,4.420353982300885
288303,5,6300269965,Great old movie. You can not beat Duvall and Caan for quality.,1426896000,,62,4.25
288304,4,6300269965,I first saw this movie on TV when I was 7 years old. I loved it then and I completely enjoy watching it today. The story is based on a real-world plan to get an American to the moon in the event that the Russians pulled ahead in the race to the moon. James Caan and Robert Duvall were superb.,1412467200,,292,3.8833333333333333
288305,5,6300269965,"A little-known classic that really evokes it's time period. Nice companion to a double-feature with ""Marooned"" or ""The Right Stuff"".",1404432000,,132,5.65
288306,5,6300269965,A great movie for all Robert Altman and James Caan fans. This movie was shot in the scope format so it looks great letterboxed.,1388534400,,127,4.333333333333333
288307,5,6300269965,"Excellent plot about overcoming all sorts of obstacles and taking a chance on finding shelter on the moon.  James Caan was excellent in his roll as an austronaut being selected to land on the moon.  Right up until the very end, you didn't know if he was going to successfully make it to the shelter containing food and oxygen for an extended stay on the moon.",1383436800,,359,4.424242424242424
288308,5,6300269965,"It was good to see this film again.  A good cast and to see a what if type story.  And to see the lives of the people that lead to the mission.  It is a movie I recommend, especially if you watch this movie along with Marooned for a double feature.  You get to see the politics with the decision on who to send and the personal lives that went on.,",1371254400,,348,3.859154929577465
288309,4,6300269965,"I remember watching this as a late, late show when I was a kid.  As an space race enthusiast, this movie gives a good glimpse into the 1960's Apollo moonshot era.",1355702400,,162,4.225806451612903
288310,5,6300269965,"Probably one of Robert Altman's least known film.  Two years before Armstrong set foot on the moon Altman made this wonderful movie.  It is not filled with special effects -- though the sequence on the moon is really terrific.  It is a human story with fine performances by Caan, Duvall.  These are people you care about and are drawn into the story.  Caan finding the dead Russian crew is an effective moment.  This is a Warner Archives DVD-R so you don't any extras beyond the trailer.  Still a good addition to anyone who loves Science Fiction movies.",1294531200,,554,4.649484536082475
288311,3,6300269965,"This early feature by Robert Altman (who had been doing strong work on TV for 10 years) is a mostly good, solid, well acted (especially by Robert Duvall and James Caan) story of behind the scenes politics among astronauts as we raced Russia to the moon.

It gets a little soapy at times, some of the politics and science seem a little cheated, and a few key incidents are too convenient or co-incidental. Production values, especially the special effects, are pretty weak.  And Caan's astronaut is a little too open with his fears to be completely believed as a man in his position, at that time.  The macho 'right stuff' idea was till very much in effect.

On the other hand it's impressive that in 1969 someone made a space movie focusing on complex emotions and human behavior, not technology. The climax is a bit `Hollywood', although at least a little more bittersweet than usual, if predictable (and a cheat).  The small roles are well cast and played.  Not recognizably an Altman film, but shows real talent, and is definitely worth seeing, especially if you're interested in the arc of Altman's career.

I'm very glad Warners is making some of these catalogue titles available, and the transfer was of nice quality, although the prices are unfortunately high for medium profile older films.  I'll get them, since I'm a film fan, but with these titles also generally not being for rent, most people will miss out on them entirely.",1281139200,3,1437,4.766129032258065

7807888,5,6300269965,"Other than an OVERLY macho (if that was possible given the time and program) temper tantrum by Robert Duvall's character, this was an excellent examination of the Moon race.  The very real possibility of using Gemini to achieve that goal is well illustrated here.

If you're looking for ""shoot 'em up, bang bang"" in space, then this is not for you.  If you're looking for a calm and realistic treatise on the space race, this is all for you.",1509667200,,441,4.556962025316456
7807889,5,6300269965,Classic made around the Apollo program. Very realistic and well done!,1498867200,,69,5.363636363636363
7807890,1,6300269965,"Watching it on TCM literally as I type. Never having seen it before, I had high hopes, but this movie is BORING and slow as molasses running up hill. It's going nowhere and taking forever to do it. It's a low budget soap opera with a few cool NASA scenes in between.",1498521600,,266,4.134615384615385
7807891,3,6300269965,Early Robert Altman movie that isn't like his later work except for the occasional scene of multiple people talking at the same time. Movie isn't exciting but not bad.,1486944000,,167,4.793103448275862

7807893,4,6300269965,"While this small, nearly forgotten film will never be rediscovered as a lost masterpiece, it's still quality work that's well worth watching for several reasons:

- Even though tampered with by the studio, it's still an early effort by Robert Altman, and the viewer can already glimpse touches of the director's signature style, such as the overlapping dialogue & the deliberately undramatic fades & transitions from one scene to another.

- It boasts an impressive cast, with Robert Duvall inhabiting his role like a second skin, ably supported by the likes of lead James Caan, Charles Aidman, the underrated Steve Ihnat, and a very good Ted Knight. Actresses Joanna Moore & Barbara Baxley are sadly underused, though.

- It captures the atmosphere of the Space Race superbly, from the fashions to the inter-agency politics to the cultural attitudes, all in a way that films made decades after the fact can never hope to duplicate. And it subtly asks questions about the urgency of that race, and the potential human costs.

- It presages a good portion of ""Apollo 13"" in its depiction of ground support striving to help an astronaut alone in space -- many of these scenes will resonate with anyone who enjoyed Ron Howard's film. It's interesting to see the heroic face of the space program dropping just a bit to reveal the shadows of doubt & fear that must have been there at times.

- Considering the times & the lower budget, the special effects are quite good. More importantly, they're secondary to the human beings, which is as it should be. I'm especially struck by the basic decency of James Caan's dedicated astronaut upon finding the Russian moon lander, as well as his decision as to what to do with their flag.

All in all, it's an entertaining story with a bit of food for thought -- recommended!",1433203200,,1811,4.788461538461538
