3730790,5,B001ON57MS,This is one of the best musical Movies I have seen in a long time. Me and my son both love it.,1246233600,3,94,3.3181818181818183
3730791,4,B001ON57MS,"This one is a made-for-TV teen musical and it's made by Nickelodeon for not to seem behind Disney which had great success with the High School Musical series of films. However, it's a completely different cup of tea. To begin with, the story focuses on a high-school show-band on the one hand, and on the main character Nikko's (Nolan Gerard Funk) journey of self-discovery. These two points really make the film less appealing for the younger viewers for it doesn't involve a cheesy love story (even if it has hints of it) or a basketball team and team camaraderie, or completely cartoonish characters. On the other hand, it's not too appealing for the older siblings and parents group either for it lacks many elements of a proper movie for grown-ups. It's somewhere in between, hence it doesn't appeal to as wide an audience as it should. The songs are so-called rock'n'roll which means upbeat pop with electric guitars, and that's not what it should be... So, you don't have a great storyline to appeal to every age group and you don't have the musical backup to support the weak structure.

Which is a pity, because there are very good performances, especially from Nolan Gerard Funk and Greg Germann. As Greg Germann is around for ages, I believe it's important to have a few words on Nolan Funk here: The young man is good looking, has a strong, good-looking body, and has a voice which can convince people he can sing -at least in a prerecorded format. On the other hand, Nolan Funk is an interesting young actor, because, unlike Zac Efron or other male leads in such films -or his female costar Tammin Sursok for that matter-, he can act, sing, and dance all at the same time! I hope he has a remarkable career ahead of him and his recent co-starring performance at Castle TV series' pilot was promising...
However, the rest of the cast, with Mssr. Germann and Avan Jogia as major exceptions, are not really helping to keep the acting quality where it should be.
All in all, it's a fun film to watch, it has a rational enough storyline, it has above average acting overall compared to the competition, it has catchy tunes and a decent message for a younger audience and not too bad ones for those who like pop, and a great performance from Nolan Funk. The problem with it is that it doesn't really make you wish to watch it over and over and over again. I would still recommend it to buy just to watch Nolan Funk, though.",1244764800,6,2430,4.573394495412844
3730792,5,B001ON57MS,"I tought this movie was a great movie, my 4 year old son absolutly loves this movie he watchesit at least 2 to 3 times a day.  my son sings alng with every song and with every word.  i watch it with him and i have to say that i like this movie to, almost like he does.  its a really good. movie.  the actors are great, i hope if they make a second part to this movie, i hope spectacular wins this time.",1236816000,3,402,3.75
3730793,5,B001ON57MS,"This movie is so hilariously bad you just have to see it. I cant believe people actually take it seriously and think its cool lulz. This is one of those rebellious-but-safe-at-the-same-time-psuedo-cool type of movies marketed to the new breed of teens and tweens who think they are cool and edgy but are really lame, ubercomercial and mainstream. You know the type. This is the type of movie that plays up the generational gap in order to sell products to kids. Pseudo-rebellious cliches like ""breakin all the rules"" abound. The type of rebelliousness that screams ""i dress the way i want to express my individuality as long as im totally conforming to social standards in an acceptable way in order to seek approval from others and keep buying products from companies who lower my self esteem in order to hock an endless conveyor belt of products to me over the years just so i can fit in"". The main characters trendy androgynous mullet is hilarious its almost like its own character. The musical numbers are absolutely hilarious you have to see them to believe them they are so bad. The reason i give this movie 5 stars is because it is executed perfectly. The campy cheesiness of this movie is heavenly and should be an endless source of amusement for those of us who find this sort of faux-rebellious cheese funny. Im guessing the lame kids its marketed to will absolutely love it since the people who made it probably spent gobs of money on marketing research. Kids can like it because the characters have the right ""sex appeal"" these companies are known for exploiting and the scenes depict attractive kids having fun and doing their own thing in a safe enough yet rebelliousness enough way for parents to not consider it harmful but at the same time seem rebelliousness enough for kids to like. The songs mix all the popular commercial styles from ""rock"" to ""hiphop"" but of course not in an authentic way that actual real fans of those styles would appreciate. I thought when south park made fun of these teen musicals it was only making fun of high school musical until i saw this and realized one of the songs they did is from this. Its the song at the end of the episode that goes ""you can do what you want to do...as long as its what everybody else wants you to"" which pretty much seems up this movie/genre precisely. ""i dress the way i want as long as im thin, attractive, fun, smile a lot, have enough money, have an outgoing personality, and everything else that most people aren't which sets them on an endless quest to get... yet failure is inevitable which leaves most in a state of status anxiety etc which brings us to the conflicts of interest between marketing companies and people trying to sell us crap we don't need and actual satisfaction...which is where the real magnetic underlying dark side of seductive controversy really lies. The hypnotic affect this has on the human psyche is really fascinating especially when its presented under the guise of healthy fun-loving and life-affirming entertainment.buy this if you like to lAUGH AT soul deadening conformity presented as cool and campy dance numbers. Yeah i know what you're going to say ""its just a movie don't take it so seriously"".I Know. RelAX. hAVE fUN. Enjoy! ;) ""you really tore up that beatbox"" lulz",1235088000,5,3288,4.710069444444445

Now the meat and potatoes. Who knew that in addition to being a fine actor that Nolan Gerard Funk could sing! And very well too. The story is a simple one, egomaniac joins small ""group"" to get money and money only and then learns there are things more important. Lovely and attractive cast, lovely and toe-tapping music and just a lot of fun, for the kinds and the grown-ups, too.
