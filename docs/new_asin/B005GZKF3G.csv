If you speak english, you might want to make sure that the DVD you're getting is in english or whatever language you want. Mine ended up being entirely in German and I only understood some of it but my primary language is now english. But the documentary itself is nothing more than a narrator, slideshow of pictures, and an under score of instrumental music. The editing just looked like it was done by a high school video production class. There are no segments of live performances or dialog from family, friends, or amy. I would recommend 'I Told You I Was Trouble' instead because although it came out a couple years ago or so, at least it showed some sort of dimension of amy's artistry and personality by cutting in pieces of a live performance she had done and allowing various people that she knew give their insights on the type of person she was or talk about what they had to do in order record this or that etc etc. But 'Love Me Tomorrow' is one that I should have skipped.",1329436800,,1059,4.380710659898477

The only problem encountered was that the DVD did not play in my player....I had to use a computer program to record and play back. I did not exchange it though...I see it as being ""meant to be"". A ""Decrypter"" was needed...but the video was quality on ce I did that. I highly recommend it just the same. Charlie P",1324598400,2,412,4.294871794871795
