7481639,5,B016ZGY94A,Thanks for having this!  I am proud to add this to my DVD collection!,1458777600,,69,3.9285714285714284
7481640,1,B016ZGY94A,"I absolutely loved this campy, gory slasher when I saw it on cable, but I'm not a fan of paying 17 dollars for a DVD-R. I could make that myself by recording it from cable onto a 25 cent blank DVD. And the movie and music industries wonder why their sales are tanking and projects can't get funded.",1458518400,7,298,4.155172413793103
7481641,3,B016ZGY94A,"I'll get right to the point - LUMBERJACK MAN looks great, has lots of over the top violence and t'n a, and is papered over with constant attempts at juvenile humor and winky-nods to the conventions of the slasher genre, some of which are hilarious and some of which fall a little flat.  The last 20 minutes or so meanders along in an odd, confused manner which suggests to me that the filmmakers ran out of ideas.  And the demonic Lumberjack, while he looks pretty damn cool, has this dumb flapjack gimmick that sorta gets in the way as he goes around the woods bumping off hypocritical bible camp attendees, whilst being pursued by Michael Madsen, who phones in his ""Dr. Loomis""-like role affably enough.

This ""After Dark Horrorfest"" is a fun diversion & totally worth checking out, and is sincerely one of the MOST satisfying '8 Films to Die For' entries that I've ever watched.  It doesn't disappoint, delivering plenty of one-liners (and at one point, pretty fun food fight sequence), good-looking naked chicks, and stylish, above-average slasher antics. It's sorta pricey on here for a very bare-bones/no frills release, at least it was the last time I checked, so it's advisable to ""try before you buy"" if at all possible... but if you can, give it a look.",1457827200,,1263,4.7272727272727275
7481642,1,B016ZGY94A,Horrible stupid...and I'm a fan of campy stupid horror movies...but this wasn't entertaining in the slightest...pretty forgettable movie ..the only thing memorable about this movie is how bad it was,1457049600,,198,5.633333333333334
7481643,4,B016ZGY94A,"Cheesy, Low-Budget 80's Style Horror Movie. One of those So bad, it was good movies.",1450396800,4,84,4.666666666666667
7481644,4,B016ZGY94A,"A religious camp is invaded by a massive lumberjack who wants to do nothing more than spill blood and eat pancakes. Not even joking. This movie is so corny, but man, I really did get into it. Not a first, took me a little while to get into the humor because I typically don't get into the really cheesy jokes, but this movie won me over. Eventually. The acting is okay, but it fits with the cornball nature of it all. The direction is pretty good, nice pace. The story is, again, totally cornball and deals a lot with pancakes. Youll get it when you see it. But theres also a lot of nudity and bloody deaths. The deaths are also corny but damned if they're not creative though. Took me a little while for this movie to win me over but it eventually did. You may like it even sooner if you're into this type of humor. 3.5/5",1448668800,3,822,4.176100628930818
7481645,1,B016ZGY94A,"Bad acting, bad story, bad villain, and no surprise bad movie!",1448496000,,62,4.7272727272727275
7481646,5,B016ZGY94A,"A group of Church Camp leaders are preparing for their child campers at Good Friends Church Camp near Big Timber State Park, Texas. Dr. Peter Shirtcliff (Michael Madsen) in on the trail of a monster of a man (Brandon Ford) who attacks this area every 30 years over a stolen flapjack recipe.

The film is a spoof of 80's slasher films complete with blood, body parts, nudity, and irreverence. The church group is greeted by Theresa who was played by porn star Andy San Dimas. The film has numerous pancake and flapjack references...that tie into the unseen twist ending which again spoofs 80's slasher films. Great fun film for cheese lovers.

Guide: F-bomb, sex, and ample nudity.  5 stars for nudity and cheese. Not for everyone.",1448064000,,730,4.777777777777778
7481647,4,B016ZGY94A,"First let me just say, do not take this movie seriously. If you go into it thinking it's a good, old school, serious slasher, you might be disappointed. It's silly, campy, and has some fun, violent, mean-spirited kills. Counselors at a bible camp are being stalked by lumberjack demon who was murdered years ago for his pancake recipe ( i'm not joking). There's plenty of boobs n blood to be found. Michael Madsen is the only recognizable name here. And as usual..he looks disinterested and like he rather be anywhere else. Just a silly, campy, fun movie that doesn't take itself seriously.",1446422400,6,590,4.794117647058823
8737668,3,B016ZGY94A,Not a bad body count film. if your looking for plot or good story this isn't your movie but if you like fun gory very bloody slasher films with a unkillable hero this is your movie,1517616000,,180,4.027777777777778
8737669,5,B016ZGY94A,Surprisingly good for a slap stick horror film.  Packed full of gore and a shockingly high number of beautiful girls. It's more of a spoof of a horror film. Lumberjack man has tree bark for a face and carries around a cart of giant pancakes. It's brutally ridicioulous and at the same time worth a watch.,1504828800,,304,4.428571428571429

8737672,4,B016ZGY94A,A great spoof on the slasher film,1470700800,,33,3.857142857142857
8737673,3,B016ZGY94A,"I did like the movie,the acting was well done,the picture quality was very nice,l and there was a lot of gratuitous nudity but we're really getting screwed with this price of $20 for a b grade horror movie made on demand on a DVD r recordable disc.instead of just making a decent profit and selling a few more copies at a better price they would rather have us sit here waiting for drop that will never come. 3 stars for the movie 1 for Amazon",1469836800,,443,4.223529411764706
8737674,1,B016ZGY94A,"Wow how many sins can this movie actually how, it was even worse that they drew in a bunch of bible kids into a mess that have honestly not been studying the bible considering the curse words that they use,  the number of sex scenes in this.  I swear it was probably made by a but of sex crazed teens that have no idea how to make a good movie without a mess of the movie",1469318400,,371,3.8684210526315788
