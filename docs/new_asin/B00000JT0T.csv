8604313,4,B00000JT0T,"I am a physical educator and my dream was to bring dance into schools.  I bought this VHS several years ago when teaching a variety of dance units (folk, square, line, ballroom dances (swing, salsa, cha cha)) to my middle school students.  I needed a resource to help me learn easy to teach moves so that my 6-8 graders could pick-up the moves quickly during the 6 week unit where each unit focused on a different type of dance.

I specifically liked the Swing Dancing Today Made Easy for Teachers because it progressed at a comfortable pace for teachers unsure of the swing dancing with all the necessities I needed to choreograph an easy swing combination for my students to perform with a partner.  I think my students thought I was an expert swing dancer by the end of the week because of my ease with the moves and comfort with the dance all due to the teaching techniques I learned from this great VHS.

The only downside is that it is on a VHS and most schools are moving to DVDs as am I at home.  I wish I could get this on DVD!

-Enjoy!",1242864000,,1045,4.301020408163265
