Not only is it carefully narrated but also it's almost impossible to tell what they're doing. Not sure if there's an easy way to say this but ""hin yin""=waste of money.",1428278400,,287,4.433962264150943
8261653,5,B001690X24,"Nice to see Neil Tucker's best selling self-help video digitally remastered on DVD.  I was a friend of Neil's and he was a unique visionary and teacher of men's sexuality. He influenced a whole generation of men. A little bit more information about this production: Steven Arnold did the set design and is known for his innovative, operatic like erotic images, and is the publisher of many books. Tragically he died in 1994, as so did Neil Tucker.  Also music for this production was provided by Steve Jolliffe, a founding member of Tangerine Dream.  One of my favorite erotic videos of all time. And by the way, the model shown on the front is in the DVD",1428192000,,655,4.581196581196581
