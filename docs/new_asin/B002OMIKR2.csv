8376156,3,B002OMIKR2,"I took an additional star off because there was a chip inside of the case that part of the device to hold the disk in place so now it's loose:(

Otherwise everything was fine.

These movies are not amazing or good by any means. They're pretty cheesy and slowly paced. They're not scary but it's still a fun watch especially if you enjoy J-horror.

The first two discs were watchable. I enjoyed the story ""Diet"" which is a pretty popular manga since Hisashi Eguchi remade it. ""The Wish"" is probably my favorite. I found disc three to be hard to watch. It was disgusting and violent with hardly any plot.",1516838400,,602,4.454545454545454
8376157,3,B002OMIKR2,I only received two discs in my set but it was too late to return. I usually like J-Horror but the four movies I did watch were definitely low budget. Poor effects. Too many stories about children. Meh...,1476662400,,204,4.394736842105263

8376159,5,B002OMIKR2,"Im so glad I bought this set. My favorite story is ""Diet"". An emotional story with a horror twist ending. I first discovered this on youtube and decided to add it to my collection. If you like unique Japanese horror stories, this six-episode set is for you.",1365465600,10,257,4.48936170212766
