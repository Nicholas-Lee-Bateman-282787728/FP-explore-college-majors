8367739,5,B002EIJ9BM,"Mockumentary is the hot genre right now. From 1984's This is Spinal Tap to Ricky Gervais's The Office, and now Silence Ca Tue, the mockumentary is an intriguing genre. It gives a realistic view into something, allowing for objective points to be made, and still provide subjective storytelling.
Silence Ca Tue (the box proclaims it was banned in Belgium, but I'm not sure if that's actually true) is edgy and exciting. It follows a movie crew, as they try to make a movie. The youthfulness of the cast is what makes it so fun. It's a brief film (just under 70 minutes), but they breeze right by. It's truly entertaining, and amusing. Great cast, great improvisational script, and great little film.",1263513600,,698,4.776859504132231
8367740,5,B002EIJ9BM,"I've been waiting for this film to be released on DVD for quite awhile now in the United States. Silence Ca Tue! is a film that has been banned in their home country of Belgium and France for the brutal killing of predominant filmmakers. I guess they don't want people to get the idea that if you can't get financing for your film, you kill the people who won't fund your film, and make a documentary about it. Like Man Bites Dog, this is a film that will shape how filmmakers in the 21st century do guerrilla filmmaking. The humor is dark, sick, and smart. I truly think this film will become an instant cult classic, and after viewing the film no filmmaker will be safe.

I recommend that if you are a fan of cult films with very sick dark humor you should definitely pick this up! You won't be disappointed.",1252368000,,810,4.328947368421052
