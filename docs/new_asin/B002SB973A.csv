3980607,3,B002SB973A,"This fireplace is very nice but I was disappointed that the only music option was Christmas music.  It would be nice to have the option for something different. The fire is very nice and realistic.  Music aside, we really like it!",1269648000,3,230,4.585365853658536
3980608,5,B002SB973A,I really enjoy listening and watching my fireplace dvd.  It's exactly what I hoped it would be ~  Thank you!,1266796800,4,108,4.35
3980609,5,B002SB973A,This video is realistic and has added such joy and peace to this wintery season. I sit for hours  listening to the crackling fireplace while reading or knitting and enjoy the ambiance. The music is good but I had rather just listen to the sounds of a real fireplace. I especially enjoy seeing the fire logs burning down. What fun and no mess to clean up!,1266624000,12,354,4.363636363636363
3980610,5,B002SB973A,"Apartment dwellers and anyone who doesn't want to bother with a real fireplace, this is for you. Love the crackling sounds and optional music. Everyone swears the video warms up the room.",1265414400,5,187,4.875
3980611,3,B002SB973A,"If you like roaring big fires you'll probably like this one. True, about half way through the flames die down enough so that it no longer seems like your house might catch on fire, but it takes until at least 2/3 through for it to get to the point where it's what I like for a nice relaxing fire. At least the sound appears to be real rather than artificially created. However, that creates its own problems since the huge fire sounds more like howling wind until it starts to die down. There are three basic view options, but two of them include the surrounding -- do you really want to see someone's Christmas tree or all of their mantel and reflections on each side in glass doors?  Even the one closeup which shows just the fire is not in a 16:9 format and thus on my 50 inch HD set I ended up with 2.5 inch (I measured it) band both on the top and the bottom. The fire itself, although appearing to be real wood, also obviously has been very much staged since all the flames came from the center and rear of the fire while upfront are three pieces of almost vertical wood with charred edges that are not on fire and do not become progressively more charred as the fire burns (see photo I posted since the image on the DVD I got is not like the other photos here). Also, take care if you have a plasma -- after about an hour I could see some image burn in. Overall not bad as a novelty item for a party, but not really great for actually enjoying a quite evening in front of the fire.",1265241600,27,1488,4.14878892733564
3980612,5,B002SB973A,"This was a real hit at my holiday party! I loved that it had variations that you could try (modern v. traditonal) and you could even have it burn ""real-time"" v. eternally. Totally worth it!",1264118400,5,189,4.428571428571429
3980613,5,B002SB973A,This is the best fireplace scenery you'll ever need.  There are a number of features and options that make it useful for different situations.  You can hear the wood burning and crackling.  Or you can have it muted and put some of your own music.  You can have it on a loop to keep your room cozy for hours.  The video quality is great.  Another recommendation is the Jingle Belles Fireplace which packs some naughtiness to your living room when grandma is not around.,1261612800,5,468,4.511904761904762
3980614,5,B002SB973A,"I love this DVD! Whenever we have guests over to the house during the holiday season and are entertaining, the wife loves to have the Ulimate Fireplace going in the background.  I like to get it on while drinking a nice glass of wine and cozying up with the missus. U.F. really adds to the ambience of the room.  The picture quality is top.  You'd swear it was the real deal.  Well worth it.",1260230400,12,391,4.243243243243243
3980635,5,B002SB973A,"My mom bought this for me as a surprise and it has 3 fires to choose from.  Holiday, Campfire and a Fireplace that reflects in the glass doors.  Very well done!",1323907200,,160,4.129032258064516
3980636,5,B002SB973A,"I love this DVD and the choices offered for various fireplace settings and sound options. Lovely full screen crackling fire that allows one to vicariously experience the glow if not the warmth! I've used the ""eternal fire"" option which works wonderfully well, a few seconds pause after an hour and a half and away it goes again! Highly recommend the DVD.",1323820800,2,354,4.819672131147541
3980637,5,B002SB973A,"Ironically, after having been in the fireplace business for several years, I do not have a fireplace in my home.  I have missed not being able to stoke up a fire on a cold and damp day.  The Ultimate Fireplace DVD has been an amazing replacement for the real thing.  My wife and I are voracious readers so we curl up in our favorite chairs nightly with our latest books in front of the crackling fire.  We have two dogs and it is funny how they start to pant when the fireplace DVD is running.  It is so realistic that they are sure they must be getting hot.  With Christmas around the corner we put on our favorite Christmas music and the Christmas fireplace scene and our home takes on an idyllic presence with us curled up with a steaming cup of tea or hot cider and the dogs resting beside us.  Truly a Rockwell moment.",1323043200,2,823,4.237179487179487
3980638,2,B002SB973A,"This was given to us as a gift after purchasing a new HDTV. My husband & I were soon disappointed because we could not figure out how to switch between the different modes as there were no instructions to follow (as with other DVDs we've used).

Although the fire looks nice (HD? not so sure), we found a different fireplace DVD on Amazon that we enjoy much more.",1320278400,,363,4.338235294117647
3980639,5,B002SB973A,"If you don't have a fireplace and want the look, this is a very fun option. Realistic flames in ""modern"" and ""old fashion"" style of fireplace, also a pretty long loop adds to the realism. Looks fantastic on a good LCD or LED screen!",1306108800,5,232,4.295454545454546
3980640,4,B002SB973A,"Overall pleased with the purchase.  The video is crisp and clear and crackling noises sound very authentic.  The only reason I rated this four out five stars is because the holiday music soundtrack is only available on two of three scenes,  My favorite is the Christmas tree with the fireplace off to the side.  It' beautiful.  I would definitely recommend this DVD,",1295395200,5,366,4.838709677419355
3980641,1,B002SB973A,"This was money wasted.  There are no instructions with the DVD so changing from one mode to another - screensize and sound - is by guess and by golly.  I also doubt the claim that this thing is in HD.  The picture quality is nowhere near HD.  It barely is digital quality.

My wife and I are pretty tech-savy and still cannot activate the features we are led to believe are present on the DVD.

Be careful before buying this thing.  In fact, we'd suggest you not buy it.",1295308800,3,470,4.213483146067416
3980642,4,B002SB973A,"TO BE HONEST, I BOUGHT THIS AS A JOKE TO PLAY WHILE WE OPENED CHRISTMAS PRESENTS.  WE ALL LOVED IT, ESPECIALLY MY GRANDSON WHO SAT ON THE COUCH AND STARED AT IT FOR ABOUT AN HOUR. IT HAS A CALMING EFFECT AND AFTER A WHILE I FORGET THAT IT'S NOT THE REAL THING.  NOW WE PLAY IT IN THE EVENING WHEN THE COLD NORTHWEST RAIN IS LASHING PORTLAND.
THE QUALITY OF THE PICTURE IS EXCELLENT.  MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT I CAN'T HEAR THE CRACKLING OF THE FIRE VERY WELL.  OTHERWISE, EXCELLENT!",1294963200,4,482,4.206521739130435
3980643,4,B002SB973A,"We wanted this video  to add some atmosphere at a Holiday party.  Beyond the basic classic fireplace view, the two there views did not appeal to us at all.  Same with the music--I think buyers will have  plenty of music they will like better than that on this DVD.  The bottom line though is that we put it on a replay loop, put a bunch of our music on the player and it did the job--drawing favorable comments from guests.  We would buy it again.",1294444800,4,447,4.2
3980644,5,B002SB973A,"Fantastic ,Loved it ,Great Continous Play . Only One problem ,Couldn't smell the smoke . Wife said i can almost feel the heat off of it . Not into the Music so we didn't try it much . Great Job hope to see more .",1292976000,4,212,3.7333333333333334
8379263,1,B002SB973A,"I must have been drugged when I bought this.
I can't imagine even on my worst day ever considering buying this, but I know I did.
I threw it away a few years ago when cleaning up the basement.",1519689600,,192,3.948717948717949
8379264,3,B002SB973A,It works.,1406073600,,9,4.0
8379265,5,B002SB973A,So real I want to stand in front and warm my hands.  Love knitting in front of my fireplace on cold nights.,1386892800,,107,3.8636363636363638
8379266,5,B002SB973A,"We miss our fireplace, and this is about the best we can come to experiencing a fireplace over the holidays right now. I'm glad to have it, but boy do I miss the real thing.",1382745600,,173,3.9714285714285715
8379267,3,B002SB973A,"I am deducting stars because the description is misleading. Yes, you do get 14 options, but there are only 3 scenes. 1) normal fire 2) modern fire 3) Christmas bonus scene.

The normal scene and modern scene can be viewed with different audio options (4). Also, each has an eternal mode with 2 audio options. So, in total they count this as 12 options. But, in reality, it is only 2 scenes.

Like other users, I never got the pan in/out option to work. I have a Sony DVD player. Although I don't care much for it really...

I don't regret the purchase, I think it is neat! The fireplaces are pretty. I purchased this as a novelty to setup as romantic dinner at home with my girlfriend. She liked it, so the product is ok. However, I do want to point out the fact that there are only 3 scenes in this DVD so you know what you are getting into. I would have also liked something other than Christmas music.

If you want lots of scenes, go for a different product.

If you want long lasting fires, you can try this DVD or the Fireplace XL perhaps.",1381795200,,1044,4.226130653266332
8379268,5,B002SB973A,"I bought this DVD to play when I was sitting in my living room.  I loved it so much, I ended up going out and buying a TV Stand with a built in fake Fireplace...now I can use this DVD in my bedroom.  The Christmas music can be turned on or off...along with the sound.  This is a wonderful Christmastime addtition.",1370995200,,313,4.098360655737705
8379269,5,B002SB973A,We use it on one of the TV's in our restaurant. Works Great. Actually makes you feel warm and cozy.,1361750400,,99,4.0
8379270,5,B002SB973A,the logs actually burn down over some time!  The Christmas music was pleasant and the crackiling fire noise was also notriced by guests.  Got one for Mom and another for the wife; both were tickled!,1357516800,,198,4.628571428571429
8379271,5,B002SB973A,"Had a hard time deciding which DVD to choose from, but the fact that it was in HD sold us. Wow, soooo glad we did. The grafics are great. We love the sound of the fire along with the fact that we can watch it as it burns slowly down. So relaxing and romantic! We also like the way the DVD will loop back to the begining all by its self. Once we are settled in to relax and enjoy the evening, we don't have to keep track of the remote. This was a great purchase!",1330992000,,461,3.8125
8379272,5,B002SB973A,"The video gives a really nice ambiance without the expense of having a real fireplace installed.  We live near Hilton Head, SC so there is a limited need for a real fireplace.  Love the cozy feeling while sitting and reading.  Not crazy about the music so we put a cd of our choice on the Boise and sit back, and enjoy.

I find shopping at Amazon a great convenience.",1328227200,,367,4.27536231884058
