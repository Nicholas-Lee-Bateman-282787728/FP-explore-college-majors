This is nothing more than putting a widely available copy of Zvenigora, available for free at the Internet Archive and on YouTube, onto a DVD and splitting it into equal chapters for viewing. There is no restoration, no explanation, the soundtrack is either ridiculous or inappropriate, and the film quality and translations from the Russian are both extremely poor. You shouldn't have to pay for this.

The film itself is mostly a boring hodge-podge of inscrutable episodes punctuated by items of historical or anthropological interest. There are a few interesting ""special effects"" scenes. I was bowled over watching this in the wake of some wildly overstated praise that I read on the Internet. Comparing this to anything by Eisenstein or Tarkovsky is absurd, let alone to the Western greats of silent cinema. The experience would be greatly enhanced by the following:

* An appropriate soundtrack
* Film restoration (if this is the great classic that some claim it is, someone needs to do a restoration)
* Better translations of titles from the Russian
* Additional materials such as interviews with film and history experts on the importance of the film and its themes

As someone interested in Slavic history, this was a big disappointment.",1426377600,,1296,5.10377358490566
8424110,5,B004CZ6I0A,"Wacky sureal soviet era film about an old man and his search for a legendary treasure in the Ukraine during the red revolution in Russia. If you like ""Earth"" or ""Arsenal"" or other films of that era you'll like this one. B+W or course and silent, with classical music added. Only problem is its PAL so if you are in the USA and need NTSC you will have to watch it on the computer ... but it was cheap so WTF ! LOL ! Enjoy another wacky attempt by red film makers to be profound !",1416528000,,478,3.9895833333333335
