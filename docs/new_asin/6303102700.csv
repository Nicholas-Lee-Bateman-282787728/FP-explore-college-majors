7838984,4,6303102700,"I was looking for a movie with Leif Garrett in it because the only movie that I knew he was in was ""Skateboard"".  ""Long Shot"" is a fun, but really badly acted movie.  Don't get me wrong, this gives the movie it's charm. Leif plays a soccer player who must win a foosball championship in order to get the money to be able to play soccer in Europe.  It's what classic drive-in movie fare was made of! The picture quality is OK, but it's not crystal clear.  It has that foggy, early '80s filming technique to it.  The sound is really bad, as mentioned by a previous reviewer, it really does sound like an AM radio heard through a pillow!  Once you get used to it, you can make out MOST of the dialogue, but not all.  I thought the movie "" Chained Heat"" with Linda Blair had bad sound, but this movie takes the cake!  On the box cover of ""Long Shot Kids"", it states that this movie is a great family film.  The only thing is that there is bad language throughout, which may prove offensive to some viewers and not be considered a movie for family viewing.  If you want a good laugh and some entertainment along the way, ""Long Shot Kids"" hits the mark!",1061942400,4,1147,4.220183486238532
7838985,5,6303102700,E. W. Swackhamer got it right. The finest portrayal of the electric world of foosing. I dropped out of highschool to follow my dream of the ultimate foos. Now I got it all - a great job at the 7Elevin and a '92 Subaru stationwagen. It just doesn't get beter than this. One day I hope to code Perl by day and foos by night.,1033603200,3,322,3.9692307692307693
7838986,3,6303102700,"The sound on this tape is THE WORST. It's like AM radio being played through a pillow. The movie follows two friends as they try to earn money for a trip to Europe (they dream of becoming pro soccer players). They play foosball to win the money for their trip and along the way Leif Garrett falls for a French girl. That's about it. Oh yeah, a young Linda Manz (the mother from Gummo)is also in it. It's got some humor, but it is mostly a drama. Garrett is ok in this, but his best film is still the 1978 Tony Alva classic, Skateboard: The Movie. Find it if you can. Foosball anyone?",1025740800,,583,4.168141592920354
7838987,5,6303102700,This cinema masterpiece captures the thrill and glory of thesport of foosball as well as the passionate emotion of my favoritetrapping teen idols. This movie is an emotional rollercoaster with cinematography that still ceases to amaze me even after 19 years of watching this at least once a week.  This movie has given me the strength to go on and the motivation to be the best fooser I can be. Long Live LEIF GARRETT! The Only Rule of Longshot - NO SPINNING!,954028800,14,459,4.597560975609756
7838988,5,6303102700,"As a Leif Garrett fan I really enjoyed this movie. The action was nonstop,some parts of the movie were funny and  the  charactors in the film were great! Leif looked fantastic! I love this movie and  and  would watch  it again and again! I highly recommend this cool movie for Garrett fans and  foosball fans alike.",935971200,2,315,4.535714285714286
7838989,5,6303102700,"With a soundtrack too good to be true (featuring a live performance by Oingo Boingo), a script full of quotable lines (""I'll play! I can tape my hand to the bar. We can do it!""), and a quintessentially early-80s  cast, Long Shot delivers.  Long Shot does for foosball what Rocky did for  boxing.  This is the perfect party movie.",932860800,,329,4.52542372881356
