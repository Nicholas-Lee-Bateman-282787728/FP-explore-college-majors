1396532,3,B000056AYF,"Under Nevada Skies, 1946 film

The film begins with a song while the credits roll. The story begins at the ""Bear Valley Indian Reservation"" where there is an Indian Pow-Wow. Roy strums a guitar while singing. A car speeds across a stream, then stops. [Splashing water can short out the distributor cap, or cause the brakes to slip.] There is subtle humor here. G. Whittaker repairs watches and clocks. Tom Craig has a problem with his safe. Helen Williams drops by for help; she is a singer. Tom has worries. Helen sings a song for the audience. Two sinister men show up. A burglar is surprised, and is too slow on the draw. ""It was self-defense."" Roy suspects Tom knows more than he says. Tom finds Marty in his house, they draw and fire at each other. Roy and Sheriff Gabby find Tom, but he won't talk.

People listen in. Helen wants to find some jewelry that was stolen from her father. We learn about Courtney's plans. One of the men watches Roy and Helen. Three is a surprise for Helen. Marty shoots real bullets! There is another song to pad out the movie. Courtney shows up to offer help. The coroner said Tom was strangled! A letter provides a clue about the murder. Courtney wants to buy Tom's ranch. Roy has a plan to learn more. There is a comic scene and a song for entertainment. Will the trap work? One man aims a rifle at Roy, but Marty shoots him! After this there is another song. Courtney wants to question Roy about that crest. Gabby looks at a stopped clock. Two armed men take them away so Courtney can question them. But there is a fight, and Roy leaves for Craig's ranch. Helen calls from Tom's office, but stops speaking. Roy asks for help from ""Flying Eagle"" and his boys. The big chase is on! The Indians attack the house. [Don't you find this unintentionally funny?] We learn the secret of the crest: a hidden map to a treasure of valuable minerals. [The name reflects current events.] A song ends this movie.

This search for a valuable item is similar to ""The Maltese Falcon"". Using foreign spies adds a change to the traditional Western, which was usually involved in domestic politics. All in all, an average movie with some interesting scenes and plot, and enough songs for a musical. This movie has more gunplay and dead bodies than in earlier films.",1283990400,,2283,4.523002421307506
1396533,4,B000056AYF,One of the few full length movies. It has the full  69 minute run time. The quality is good and I would have given a full five stars except for the RE logo in the bottom right corner all through the movie. For this reason I will give Reel Enterprises a no vote and buy somewhere else.,1200268800,4,284,3.982456140350877
