His set on Comedy Person starts off a little slow, but once he gets his rhythm, its really good.  I found myself laughing so hard that I almost spat out my drink (a few times).  I can't wait to hear more from him.  I hope he finds great success, because he's damn funny.",1323993600,,429,3.7752808988764044

8442055,5,B004UR1R6U,"Hands down, favorite stand up routine ever! It's his monotone delivery of jokes that adds the punch to his realistic views and stories of life.",1363219200,3,143,4.76
8442056,5,B004UR1R6U,"I was delighted to find this DVD after having seen Wyatt Cenac performing live in NYC. He is a brilliantly funny (if understated) comedian. If you only know him from the Daily Show, be prepared to be blown away! His humor challenges your preconceptions without being 'in your face'. He subtly winds his way into your psyche until you are both intellectually stimulated and laughing your bleeding head off. If you're looking for a raunchy, ni**a a minute routine, keep looking. If you're looking for comedy that stands up to repeated viewing and gets /better/ the more you think about it, grab this DVD. It's a brilliant and insightful look into life, love, race and box-jumping cats.",1330214400,2,683,4.846153846153846
