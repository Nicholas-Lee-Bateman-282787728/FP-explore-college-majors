7878689,2,630488429X,The only part of this movie that is good is the shower door scene with Mark Damon. OH MIO DIO! SO HOT!,1452384000,,102,3.6818181818181817
7878690,3,630488429X,"I read an on-line article several years ago that Radley Meztger's ""Little Mother"" was inspired by Mary Main's ""The Woman With the Whip"", a biased biography on the life of the controversial First Lady of Argentina, Eva Per&oacute;n - Evita. This film is a tale of fiction and despite the synopsis of the film on the VHS and DVD back covers claiming to be the real story of Eva Per&oacute;n, it is not and I do not think this was meant to be an exact biography of the legendary Evita since far too many liberties were taken and the country which this sordid tale takes place in is not even named.

The film chronicles the life of Marina Pinares, a corrupt, murderous First Lady of an obscure country. The beautiful and conniving Marina, claws and kills her way to the top and upon discovering that she has a terminal illness, plots to have herself declared a saint by the Catholic church.

Despite some similarities between the heinous ""Blood Queen"" portrayed in the film and the real Eva Per&oacute;n (the films leading actress Christiane Kruger looks identical to the real thing in certain scenes), this is pure, ""soft-core"" fiction but despite the inaccuracies is still highly entertaining.

Those viewing this for the eroticism may be disappointed as there is very little of it here. I am not a Metzger fan or pretend to be an expert on his films, so I can't really compare this to his other works. I did see most of his film ""Score"" several years ago, and sexually speaking, ""Little Mother"" is pretty tame in comparison. The performances are interesting. I do think Christiane Kruger did a fairly good job in this and as mentioned previously, there are scenes where she is a splitting image of the historical Evita. She plays the title character well projecting just the right amount of eroticism and malice which was needed for this particular role. Not a good biography of Evita and definitely not the greatest soft core film ever produced, as their is far more violence than eroticism, but as a curiosity piece, it is worth watching.",1388620800,,2039,4.705882352941177
7878691,3,630488429X,"This is not the best way to watch a Radley Metzger film. Wait until a new remastered edition comes out. This film is called an anomaly in Metzger's career, and it was indeed a big surprise for me! This is more a political drama and much less an exploitation film! If you are new to Metzger, this is clearly not the film to start. Nice film with an amazing leading actress, but it just doesn't deliver! The film could be much more daring and erotic. I guess that Metzger wanted to make a more regular and ""serious"" film.",1376524800,,519,4.3061224489795915
7878692,2,630488429X,"Very few of Radley Metzger's flicks deliver the exploitation goods properly, and this is one of them. He's always reaching farther than his talents can take him, so most of his films are half-assed attempts at art house exploitation that bare too little skin and are devoid of any art. In the early 60's he was almost onto something, but then veered off into X rated territory, and even that stuff is tame. His mid-70's work while utilizing the name 'Henry Paris',well, those are his finest achievements. This 'Evita' soft-core spin is uninspired, uneven and unequivocally lacking sexuality for a flick of its type. The plot is dull, the acting weak, all of which is forgivable IF you deliver the sexual angle you're promoting, but this one makes us wait far too long between scenes to make this a worthwhile venture. This flick makes 'Score', his latest re-release and first to get a blu-ray treatment, look good, and it too is bland, boring and reeks of a homoerotic vibe that will perturb most men who buy this for the nekkid babes. Skip this and look elsewhere for your jollies, 'cause I'm fairly certain you won't find them here...",1288051200,3,1136,4.742424242424242
7878693,4,630488429X,"I've been a fan of Radley Metzger since I saw 'CAMILLE 2000' back in the seventies.  This film may not please fans of Metzger eroticisms but it shows a mature film maker at his best when confronted with good material.  The 'EVITA' legend gets an interesting upgrade and Metzger uses his cinematic power to bring it to fruition with a powerful performance by Kruger.  Fans of Euro Horror will be pleased to see Matt Damon and Anton Differing popping up within the tangled web.  Don't get me wrong, Metzger spices things up with some erotic moments of which he is known for but this film is so much more.  The quality has average sound with some scratches and splices at the reel changes but why quibble?  Here is the maestro with a different twist and I do no one thing about a Metzger film, it is never disappointing.",1274313600,,817,4.486486486486487
7878694,4,630488429X,"over the years, certain movies are made and never 'released' to theatre's for one reason or other.
than years later, these films suddenly appear in the form of video tape.
""Little Mother"", which on the box is clearly stated is based on the life of Evita Peron, was one
of these films.  as usual the women are beautiful, the nudity is plentiful, but the story line is
weak.
how this could be based even loosely on Evita Peron is beyond me.",1268784000,6,438,4.407407407407407
7878695,3,630488429X,"I like Christianne Kruger so I took a chance and bought this one. I didn't expect much and so I wasn't disappointed much. This is more of an art film. Good photography as these things go, but a murky plot and a lot of artistic pretense. Buy it for the photography.",1222905600,2,264,4.196078431372549
7878696,5,630488429X,"I am a Radley Metzger fan, and as such I am interested in this film. But I can find no info on it, and desperately want to hear some feedback on it first, as I am a starving student. I don't want to buy the tape if it is  trash, a bad transfer, cut to blazes, etc
Thanks in advance!",955929600,,282,3.7
