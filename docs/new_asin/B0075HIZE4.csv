5057222,5,B0075HIZE4,"I followed the production of this film as closely as I could over the internet, so I was really excited to see it when it got finished.  It definitely did not disappoint.  Very well done film, very informative and interesting documentary, and an overall excellent product.  The extras in the box were awesome!  I will absolutely be recommending this film to my friends and showing my copy off to as many people as I can, whether they like boardgames or not.",1330992000,2,457,4.604938271604938
5057223,5,B0075HIZE4,"As a gamer, I found this documentary to be riveting. Interviews with some of the biggest names in the designer gaming world, behind-the-scenes looks at how publishers work and the impact that Kickstarter.com has had in the industry... it's all here. Also included: tons of bonus clips and a board game!

A caveat.. I have shown this to several non-gamer friends. They said they felt it was too ""inside baseball."" Though enjoyable, they felt like they were missing out on a lot because they weren't familiar with the games and people mentioned. That being said, they did actually enjoy it and are now more open to designer board games. Seems like a ""win"" to me.

Grab some friends, pop in the DVD and be ready to bust out some Settlers of Catan after!",1330905600,8,750,4.631578947368421
5057224,5,B0075HIZE4,"If you are a hobby gamer, know one or are interested in starting off this is the DVD for you.  The main feature mixes a series of story lines quite well.  You get to see the hobby from the point of view of players, designers and publishers.  It Goes to show that while hobby gaming may just be catching on in the US that we are behind many areas of the world.  There is info on and interviews with many of the established designers and the tale of an aspiring designer as well.  There are many mini-bonus clips.  These are all relatively short but well focused.  Each does a great job of covering it's topic without going overlong.  These show additional interviews that were cut form the main film.  They also showcase how some of the earlier Eurogames came into the US.  There is also a game timeline and history of the Spiel DES Jahres winners up until the time the movie was completed.

As a bonus you get a copy of Shoot Out a game by Reiner Knizia.",1330732800,7,954,4.273743016759776

8510585,2,B0075HIZE4,"This is actually pretty terrible. The video and sound quality are atrocious and it just feels disjointed like it started out as one thing (read the IMDB synopsis) and ended up being about a dude who pulls his own teeth out (literally). Only, there wasn't enough to fill up the rest once it became a less about boardgames and more about the difficult journey of one individual. Yet, these odd pieces from the original footage are still slapped in around it as disjointed filler.",1424822400,,477,4.690476190476191
8510586,5,B0075HIZE4,"Going Cardboard delves into the resurging world of boardgames, focusing on the European competitions and the new games that are at the forefront of a revival of an old family tradition - game night. The documentary touches on collectors, makers, designers and players of some of the new and exciting games that are really worth checking out.

The Board Game is not dead, it has merely been resting. And now it's woken up.",1404691200,,421,4.767123287671233
8510587,2,B0075HIZE4,"I expected this to be kind of a board game version of Indie Game: The Movie, (about computer games) but it is pretty inferior to that documentary. This is little better than home movie material. The subject matter deserves much better than this. I would love to see in-depth interviews with some of the great game-designers, as that is not to be found here.",1404086400,,357,4.59375
8510588,3,B0075HIZE4,"While I appreciate the concept, I can't give 5 stars due to the amateur-ish hack-job that this video is. If you're interested in board games it's still worth a watch though. The content is definitely there.",1392595200,,206,4.75
8510589,4,B0075HIZE4,"I'm not much of a gamer, and I only ran into this interesting DVD because I was checking the King County Library System (Washington State) for Esperanto materials, and this was listed as one. Turns out it has subtitles available in several languages, including Esperanto. The Esperanto translation in the subtitles is quite well done, but occasionally a bit wordy, with the result that the text doesn't remain on the screen long enough to read it all. This is especially the case with some of the faster-speaking interviewees. || Mi ne estas ludmaniulo, kaj mi nur renkontis tiun i interesan DVD-on ar mi kontrolis la Esperanto-materialojn en la katalogo de la Biblioteka Sistemo de Kantono King (Vaintonio, Usono), kaj trovis tion i en la listo. Montriis, ke i havas subtitolojn en pluraj lingvoj, interalie en Esperanto, pro kio i tiel listiis. La esperantaj tradukoj estas lerte faritaj, sed kelkloke tro multevortaj, a tro multesilabaj, pro kio rezultas ke la teksto ne restas sur la ekrano sufie longe por legi ian tuton.

8510590,5,B0075HIZE4,"This is a great documentary! It gives tips on how to get newbies into gaming, the history of gaming, interviews with seasoned professionals. Everything you need to know about gaming and how awesome it is, is in this doc.",1367107200,,220,4.666666666666667
8510591,5,B0075HIZE4,"Going Cardboard really conveys the buzz that is exploding in the growing board game community. These modern games build social capital in the face-to-face community, provide great times for family bonding, and, best of all, are really FUN. An incredible renaissance is going on, and the general populace is beginning to catch up with it. (See recent articles from WSJ, BBC and others.) This film lets key players tell the story of their involvement - great human stories. It also balances industry insiders with average people whose lives have been enriched through the board game revival. That may sound trite, but it is not hyperbole. The analog game revolution is great stuff. Watch this film and learn why more and more individuals and families are ""going cardboard""!",1362528000,,771,5.078740157480315
8510592,5,B0075HIZE4,I have been an avid boardgamer for over 30 years.  I often have a hard time explaining my hobby to my friends and family.  This movie is a great way to explain the hobby.  Really great purchase.,1356048000,,194,4.1891891891891895
8510593,5,B0075HIZE4,"If you have an American background in gaming (Monopoly, Battleship, Sorry, etc) this will be an eye-opening documentary for you. There is a whole world out there of high-level board games with exquisite craftsmanship. The included game - Shoot-Out - gives you a taste of just what the whole movie is about. Since watching my wife and I have taken the dive into some of the games featured and are having a blast!",1332288000,,411,4.6438356164383565
8510594,5,B0075HIZE4,"There are not that many documentaries that I find interesting, but one about board games got my attention right away. I have been waiting for almost a year for this one to come out, and it was worth the wait. The movie explores the world of hobby board gaming. It looks at the history of gaming, how companies have been founded, the process of designing a game, trade shows, game nights, and anything and everything that the hobby involves. Lorien Green, who directed the movie, interviews major players in the industry. She talks with publishers, designers, podcasters, reviewers, and many others as she takes the viewers down the road of understanding why board games are so great, and why they have exploded in the last couple of years.

As a board gamer and lover of history, I absolutely loved this movie. It was great to see how games have evolved over the past fifty years. The movie does a great job of explaining how games went from being the standard roll and move style games of Monopoly and Life to the designer games that use a multitude of different mechanisms. It's interesting that the evolution of gaming took a real turn when they started handing out rewards to games--that directly affected sales. Lorien also does a great job of  finding out how a game is created and how different designers entered the industry. It's also great to see the faces of these designers. We know the names, but there images are usually clouded in mystery. I love seeing behind the scenes stuff like that.

I loved the scenes from the trade shows and the interviews and shots of just different people. I doubt I will ever get to go to Essen or even one of the big conventions in the states, but it was great to see what that experience is like and what it encompasses. I think you also get a good idea of how big Essen is. It is really unbelievable how many people and how many vendors are at that show.

As I said, I waited for almost a year for Going Cardboard to come out, and I can tell you that it was well worth the wait. The movie was awesome. It does a great job of exploring the hobby. It will be great for non-gamer friends of yours to watch to better understand why you love games, and you and your gamer friends will enjoy seeing all the behind the scenes of how games are created, what the designers are like, and how a game is published. It was a great film. I strongly suggest you pick it up. It also comes with a game, Reiner Knizia's Shoot-Out. So for about $30 you get a great movie and a cool little game. Well worth it.
