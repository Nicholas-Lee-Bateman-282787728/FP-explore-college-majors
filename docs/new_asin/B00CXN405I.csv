8587301,2,B00CXN405I,"I found this dvd to contain nothing but drawn-out dialogue without much substance. It's merely a series of interviews centered on a few different topics. Philip Gardiner makes 2 attempts to create visual presentations of his 2 books but to accompany religious topics like the Shroud of Turin and The Ark of the Covenant with loud, blasting, heavy metal music just doesn't work and serves as more of a distraction than anything else. The interviews are way too long and stray into  unrelated areas.  Not recommended.",1522022400,,515,4.976744186046512

75% IS TALK,TALK AND MORE TALK. I PURCHASED A DVD FROM THEM BEFORE,SAME THING. THEY SHOULD AT LEAST ADVISE YOU OF THAT FACT,BUT OF CAUSE THEY DONT. IF YOU ARE EMPLOYED IN THE FIELD ITIS GREAT, OTHERWISE FOREGET ABOUT IT",1376438400,3,315,4.3559322033898304
