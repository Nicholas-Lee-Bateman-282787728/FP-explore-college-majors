In fact, some of the aircraft from the WW2 footage are actually Axis planes despite being labeled American bombers and fighters. The music is campy, repetitive and kludged together. You will gain nothing but buyer's remorse from the purchase of this DVD set.",1339113600,,370,4.796875
7934729,1,B00005A07X,"In recent months there have been a whole heap of these sort of DVD's, and for the most part they have been pretty good. Most have had no speech and just constant footage of planes and weapon systems.  This one falls short of the mark. The music is bad, the footage jumps from one thing to another so quickly sometimes that it fails to show the aircraft in detail. That is my biggest complaint for this DVD. They will show a f-16 on a landing approch and just when you can really see the detail they jump to something else. With weapon system shots they jump to a new shot before the explosion has finished.  Overall it just does not come up to the standard that the others have been. If you want to get some of these DVD's then I suggest giving this one a miss and grabbing one of the other ones.",997660800,7,796,4.162337662337662
