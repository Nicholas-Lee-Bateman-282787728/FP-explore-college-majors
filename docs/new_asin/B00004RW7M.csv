8168968,4,B00004RW7M,"Just recently I purchased the pilot in English and I have to say it's a pity this show was killed off after just one season. It's a shame it has never been aired again since 1997/1998 and I wish I could get my hands on the rest of the season!
If anyone knows where to purchase the rest of this, kindly YELL!
Keith Carradine and Duncan Regehr were good in this, Keith was funny and Duncan was quite charming. It had a great storyline in the pilot, the ending COULD have been a little better, but it's worth a watch if you are a fan of these two or Sebastian Spence. 4 stars out of 5. Again, I want this series so I hope it does get released one day!",1198454400,,648,3.9923076923076923
