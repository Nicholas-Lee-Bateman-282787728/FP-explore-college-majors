8269946,5,B0018L8XKE,Provides a lot of useful information for an intermediate to advance dancer. Not for beginners.,1480377600,,94,5.333333333333333
8269947,5,B0018L8XKE,"I think the information is very clear in a lovely way. Mario ad Saida love the dance and you can it very clear.
The dance combination are easy if you are an experienced dancer, but I think they are useful because you can see
it with uncomoun rythms, like Mosales Iraqui or others. Recomended",1422489600,,291,4.407407407407407
8269948,5,B0018L8XKE,"All that Saida does is perfect! And Mario is a gorgeous musician, so... I love this dvd! I recommend it!",1380326400,,104,4.25
8269949,5,B0018L8XKE,"As a performer and instructor, I found this dvd set to be very educational and inspiring.  The lecture portion on rhythm with Mario was very informative and useful.  The dance instruction with Saida was clear and easy to follow.  I do enjoy her style so I found a lot of inspiration in the rhythm combo section, the baladi choreography section and the performance section.
Mario and Saida  convey a genuine intent to educate and share their pride and knowledge of this art form.  They present the material with warmth and clarity.  They really know their stuff.
There is a lot of useful material in this dvd set.  It is very good value for your money.",1364860800,2,651,4.608695652173913
8269950,4,B0018L8XKE,"The title menu there are two flags representing the language you want to see the dvd in. Spain/spanish flag and England/English flag. I'm loving the fact that its Bi-lingual. The English section is all in subtitles so you will have to pay attention to the screen.
After pressing the flag I came to a page that had Part 1:Rhythms and Taqasim

Rhythms :
Mosales
Mosales Iraqui
Samai
Karcilama
Georgina (Yuryuna)

Saida opens the rhythm section by giving a welcoming message . Her and Mario tell how they did their best to present new rhythms and new choreographies. I loved the rhythm sections simply because in the beginning Mario goes over the rhythm as if you were actually in a music class. He has a board with the rhythm notes written out like a music sheet. He gives a little background of each rhythm then lets you hear a clip. The band then plays a demonstration while Mario points at each note so you can see how it looks while being played out. The dancing technique comes after the demonstration. There are three total Saida shows you a mini choreography  to dance with the rhythm too. The  Combination rhythms comes next, that is  where Saida dances  using the movements she taught as well

Taqasim:
The taqasim and baladi: Mario opens first by giving a lecture on what the baladi and taqasim is and where it cames from. The segment is really a lecture on the baladi and taqasim. In this segment he plays the keyboards a bit then has the band play a demonstration.

The taqasim played on the Kanun: He talks about the song for which Saida choreographed and the song  taqasim on a kanun which Mario made. He also talks about the Kanun how its made the different sounds it produces etc.  Saida is also there in costume

Dancing to a taqasim: This is where Saida actually performs  while Mario is playing the Kanun

I really liked this section as it had background information about these rhythms that I had not previously known. His explanations are in depth and clear.

Part 2
Choreography is broken down into 18 sections, about every 4 or so sections there is a rehearsal of the new information. Then there is a complete rehearsal followed by a complete choreography. The song the choreography is too is called little baladi.
Performance: Seven in all including a  bonus performance
There is no breakdown of movement she shows the movements once of twice then you practice with music. The breakdown seemed a little brisk but the movements are not overly complex. In my opinion they are movements a beginner dancer could get. There were two moves I liked in the choreography at turn she  did near the end and her shimmying up from a knelt position. Other than that I didn't find the choreography to interesting.

The picture is bright and clean. The camera angles work well with the dvd, no weird camera angles. The instructors and band are facing you the entire time. The lighting is really well. The sound was excellent. I think this dvd is learner friendly .The production quality is also very good. Sometimes that last sentence on the screen overlaps with things in the background which may make it hard to see for some.

Is this dvd worth it?
.think this information is very useful, but this is not a dance all the way through drill dvd.  There is no warm-up. There is really no safety advice. Some dancing background is to be expected. Saidia does go over the moves, but she doesn't really do  movement breakdown. The instructions for the movement and musical breakdown are clear. I think for this kind of dvd the depth of the movement breakdown was well enough. The pacing of the dvd was excellent. Not to fast not to slow. Saida and Mario are very warm and friendly. This is one of those dvd were you actually feel like you are working in the studio with the instructors.

I think the dvd stayed true to its purpose to help the student learn different rhythms and their application to the dance .But I am not sure this was as easy system of learning music and techniques of belly dance. An easy means of learning rhythms and music yes but the movement technique breakdown was just not there. The instruction she does give is good. But this is not a learn to bellydance movement format. For the music section I would say this is open to every level of dancer. For the choreo I would say ""TOO ME"" the movements were not difficult and a beginner intermediate would catch on at a good pace. Whether or not you will have the grace as Saida in executing them is another matter :).

I respect saida as an artist but am not a true fan of her dancing, the second half of the dvd was all performances and choreography which made it not so useful for me. I won't take off point for this Because for Saida or similar style fans of dancing this dvd will be more than well worth the price. With that said I do enjoy performance footage simply because you never know when you might see a nice combo or new way of expressing a move. With seven performances and a full choreography  I think purchasers will be very satisfied. The first part of the dvd that had history, lessons as well as musical lessons was well worth the dvd. The actual shelf life is going to depend on how fast you absorb information. The first part of the dvd was very much lecture style. I feel Mario was very generous with the information that was given.  I do wish more rhythms had been added. I think if the dvd had went over about 7-10 rhythms this dvd to me would be one of the best dvd's on the market. This is the only Saida dvd I own so I am unsure whether material has been repeated or not. I would definitely like to get other dvd's by her that goes over musical content. His information on the taqasim and baladi adds to ranya renees information. I paid $13.97 for this dvd And I would say it was worth it.

Pro's:
Excellent rhythm breakdown
Performances and choreo for those who enjoys Saida's style.
Lecture style for those who love to sit and listen to lectures.
Indepth lectures
Live band playing

Con's:
Only a few rhythms
Performances and choreo for those who are not a fan of her style.
Movement breakdown scarce.
For those who enjoy movement, First dvd is made up with a lot of talking. May be off putting to sit through the talking parts.

4/5 because I honestly believe the learner would have benefited more, as well as the increase in shelf life had more rhythms been presented on the disk. Other than that I am completely happy with the purchase.",1347148800,7,6442,4.497857754927164
