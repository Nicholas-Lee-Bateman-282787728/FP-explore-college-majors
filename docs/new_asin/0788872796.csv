79474,5,0788872796,"The eighteen episodes of Commander-in-Chief are very entertaining. The acting by the entire cast is superb. Geena Davis is an excellent model for how a female President might behave, running the country, tackling the enormous issues that arise day after day and doing so without completely destroying her female attributes. Speaker-of-the-House, played by Donald Sutherland, is the perfect, conniving Congressman, the foil and competitor (villian) in this drama. The sets and editing are excellent, the walks and talks outstanding. The supporting cast all fit their roles and delivered excellent performances. The music fit the play.

79477,4,0788872796,"""When we heard there was going to be a series on a woman US president we watched it.  When getting DVDs  of West Wing we saw we could get DVDs of Commander in Chief.
We thought Geena Davis was excellent as the president  and Donald Sutherland was at his smarmiest...maybe just a little too much.  The kids weren't very believable to me.  They were a little to risque for high school students in my opinion.  I like to think they would have higher morals.",1334188800,,454,4.345238095238095
79488,5,0788872796,"I ordered Part 1 and 2 and I just watched them.  The acting was great, I was not disappointed with any of the actors or the scenes.  I do believe this view on Capital Hill could be more realistic than we realize.  I love that a woman became first lady, I believe in the ERA.  We are so far ahead of other countries, but yet still backwards.  I could not have been more please with this series entertainment.  I wish this could have continued.  United States is a proud country, but are we proud of our human entities.",1332892800,,517,4.214285714285714
79489,4,0788872796,"Commander in Chief is obviously attempt to ride the wake of the success of West Wing. Unfortunately, it didn't quite succeed. I can see why. It's a good how, but has some flaws. Here's the rundown:

GOOD

The acting is all around strong. Of course, Geena Davis gives a strong performance as the first female president with a mixture of strength and motherliness. Donald Sutherland as her arch-nemesis Speaker Nathan Templeton is brilliant, combining regal dignity with deviousness. All of the characters are multifaceted and most have a realistic mix of motivations. Even Templeton is never portrayed as simply a villain but rather a politician who believes the country would be better off with him as president.

I also appreciate that the plot lines don't become two ridiculous (with one or two exceptions). It's tempting for a show like this to simply feature a foreign or political crisis every week, but Commander in Chief doesn't overdo these.

BAD

I think the biggest problem with the show is its self-righteousness. The show always portrays the president as morally and politically superior to anybody around her. Her policies are portrayed as the right ones, even when they're questionable (particularly the first episode, which seems to endorse a vision of American imperialism and interventionism). She always finds some out-of-the-box policy solution to outwit her opponents. However, I think the show would have been more interesting if we see the president or her team trip up occaisionally.

Another issue is that the president is both the first female president and a political independent. It's a bit too much and the show sometimes seemed undecided as to which aspect to emphasize. Especially after the 2008 election, it's pretty easy to imagine a female president. However, an independent is less realistic and the show doesn't quite pull it off. More often it becomes the president against the Republicans.

The show isn't quite as wonky as West Wing. More of the episodes focus on the first family. Obviously, this is natural with the first female president, but I can understand why much of the West Wing audience didn't care much for the episode where the teens go wild in the White House.

UGLY

A few episodes in the second season went far off the deep end. The Democrats poison the first gentleman, Speaker Templeton serves as acting president for a day and goes power crazy, and a terrorist threatens to blow up Air Force One. It seems like the producers wanted to raise the ratings by throwing in some plot twists, but it comes off looking too much like Desperate Housewives.

Overall, it's a good show, but I can see why it was never great.",1325808000,,2670,4.939732142857143
79490,5,0788872796,"This is a fantastic series. Even though off the air for a year or two it is
up todate and the material
 is current with political scene today.  Gives us
an insight to how Washington works. I don't understand why this series was
taken off the air.",1310515200,,246,4.212765957446808
79491,5,0788872796,"Well, i just don't understand why ABC never gives any shows a chance.  You can't expect for any show to survive by moving the day to shows around and only airing it for 2 seasons.  Just like V, ABC canceled it after only two seasons also.  They left so many unanswered questions that we will never know the answers to.  Commander in Chief was so interesting and Geena Davis as the first woman president was so cool and she always had to watch her back around donald sutherland's character.  If ABC doesn't want a series to be long they should at least have one more season of the show to truly end it.  Have more respect for your audience than that.  Don't always listen to the ""critics' ratings""  Tell you what everyone should not watch ABC for time to show them what would happen if they didn't have an audience.  ABC  give us a break or stop making shows that you will never finish!!!!!!! Well, abc has done it again.  They canceled ""missing"" after only one season.  ABC, give us a break.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1307836800,,1080,4.873626373626373

79494,5,0788872796,"This is an excellent an gripping as well as an etertaining TV series that should have lasted longer.  Geena Davis is great as the first woman president.  Not as Hillary Clinton might have been, but more a Sarah Palin type.  The only real problem is that series 1 and series 2 should have been packaged together - more money for the distributor, I suspect.
GET IT, YOU WON'T BE SORRY!",1235779200,,383,4.442857142857143
79495,3,0788872796,"I loved this series (not as much as the west wing), but was extremely unhappy that they split the first season into two parts (forcing two purchases).  I was also unhappy with the season ending.

Overall, Geena Davis was great.  The plots were great.  The funny aspect needs work, and the other characters could have been much better.

The writers and producers did an acceptional job of showing how a female president could be both hard nosed and yet still be a wife and mother in a stellar way.

My only complaint? I think the series should be packaged together. There are only two disks per box and each one is priced at around $20 bucks...it has less episodes than a full series and yet we are asked to pay over $40.",1228176000,,581,4.225225225225225

79508,5,0788872796,"This series is about the the political drama created by the first female president of the United States. The Female President Mackenzie Allen is played superbly by Geena Davis, who does an amazing job in demonstrating how a female would handle difficult situations. For us, this series has become a favorite to watch with teenagers, stopping the DVD at every question to ensure understanding of government, politics, and acronyms. A superb learning tool.

The situations are excellent, the acting, especially by Davis and the Speaker of the House Nathan Templeton, played by Donald Sutherland. As usual, Sutherland is simply magnificent playing a bad guy, in this case a deceptively genial snake, who is after the power of the presidency, thinking that Davis will be easy to beat, but at every turn realizing that ""she is a force to be reckoned with"" and ""smart as a wip!""

Kyle Secor plays the First Gentleman, and he too provides a candid view as to the difficulties a man would encounter if ever in this situation. The staff players are all amazingly interesting, with us hating and loving the White House official and political consultant Dickie McDonald, played by Mark-Paul Gosselaar.

Don't know why this series went off the air, but we sincerely hope it is resurrected. We enjoyed each and every episode!",1195862400,,1312,4.981735159817352

This was definatetly a marketing scheme to make extra cash. However, that being said if you have Part I, you NEED Part II.",1175040000,,375,4.267605633802817
79515,4,0788872796,"Back during its original hopscotch run all over primetime, there was so much gossipy scuffle about ABC's incompetent handling of C-IN-C  that I inferred the quality of the episodes suffered after Bochco took over control from its initiator Rod Lurie.  But all of the episodes except the last retain the quality of the contents of the first DVD set.

My problems with the final episode mainly involve a forming plot line that was as improbable when WEST WING also adopted it.  When Nixon lost Agnew, can one really imagine his party not looking for a VP candidate in a state that would bring delegate votes, but instead deciding on making Ehrlichman or Halderman the new VP?

That BOTH presidency TV series selected the sitting president's internal employee as a VP candidate always seemed lazy and far-fetched.  On the surface, both men bring qualities that presume America is brighter, more liberal, and less assaultive than the realities of our history suggest. (In the era of torture in war, how does one account for America's embrace of HOSTEL and the SAW franchise?) On WW the VP candidate is an alcoholic with a serious heart condition; on C-IN-C he's a Black mensch who abandoned his own party to graft onto a woman Independent.  We in the audience appreciate the sensitivity, loyalty, and complexity of both VP choices, but would political parties really not insist on a more pragmatic (and probably less sterling) candidate from a section of the country that is more lucrative to electoral college concerns, and someone the American public already knows from (probably) ""his"" record as a governor or member of Congress?

Late C-IN-C showed other signs of WING weariness.  The teen daughter's budding romance with someone in the political opposition was another WEST WING echo, and the OTHER candidates for VP included a Jimmy Smits clone.  So, my enthusiasm for the second DVD flagged a bit as President Allen's decision-making began to look flaky for the convenience of the writers and as situations began to plow territory similar to WING.

If memory serves, Allen defends reintroducing ERA legislation by citing a sage homily:  Once your hands are on the plow, don't let go until you've reached the end of the row.  Given the VP and other situations budding in the last episode here, the series ended at the end of its row.

Okay, so now our appetites have been whetted by an excellent (but cancelled) politics series, how about DVD-ing Rob Lowe's LYON'S DEN?",1174521600,5,2471,4.9228915662650605

79531,5,0788872796,"I really enjoyed watching the full 17 episodes of this series, only some of which I saw during the original (and all too brief) television run.  I found the series innovative, thought-provoking, and entertaining.  Admittedly, it at times lacked for realism.  For example, an Acting President who assumes duties under the 25th Amendment for a brief incapacity of the President would not likely occupy the Oval Office, take a public oath of office, or be addressed by the press corps as ""Mr. President.""  To do so would be considered so over-the-top and offensive that it would destroy that politician's career, but Nathan Templeton paid little price for it.  And the episode on the revival of the ERA ignored the issue of whether it can be revive since the congressional enactment had the amendment expire in 1982.  But these are relatively minor points.  Overall, I think the series was very solid, and I truly regret that it was not continued and extended by the network.

In the meantime, people can enjoy it in this format.  If I had a young daughter, I would surely like her to be able to see that women can be credible leaders at any level.  Perhaps this show brought us a step closer to that day.",1168300800,5,1202,4.680952380952381
79532,5,0788872796,"I am so impressed with the quality of the writing and acting in this series.  But I must be stupid, since it's been canceled.  I am having a very hard time with this.  I'm a guy, but I appreciate the story line and I'm been sucked into caring for the characters.  It really hurts that this is all there is.",1163808000,3,306,4.05
79533,5,0788872796,"This was one of my favourite shows of last season but after being treated like crap by ABC the show got cancelled. A TV movie is in the making and I can't wait to see what happends to President Allen and the rest of the cast. Geena Davis is perfect as the first female president of the United States and the cast, including Donald Sutherland, are also wonderful.

Since the show ended prematurely we never got to see what happend in the election but the episodes, from the pilot and on, leading up to the series finale is an interesting journey filled with good plots and wonderful acting. I for one am still hoping for this show to return if the TV movie does well but in case it doesent the first and only season is a good buy of it's own.",1163030400,2,741,4.21830985915493
79534,3,0788872796,"Yes, this is basically West Wing light,with good enough acting overall,though I still think Geena Davis(first female President of the United States) only truly shines in the very first episode of the series(which is also on this Part 2 DVD,but this time with the choice of listening to show creator Rod Lurie's commentary or not).It could perhaps be because that happens to be my favorite episode. She's fine in the other episodes but I enjoy watching the rest of the First Family much more. Geena Davis' character is under so much pressure as the President of the United States,that she rarely gets a chance to flash her great smile and showcase her friendly nature.

I like all of the First Family actors,and also like the way this series mostly focuses on their relationships with each other rather than getting too deep into political issues. Both the eldest daughter,played by Caitlin Wachs, and the the youngest daughter,played by Jasmine Anthony, are top-notch and greatly add to the show. Matt Lanter(son) and Kyle Secor(husband) are both solid as well. Later on in the series,the grandmother is added to help keep the family more secure.

Both Ever Carradine(Robert Carradine's daughter),who plays  press secretary Kelly Ludlow and Harry J. Lennix who plays Chief of Staff Jim Gardner are both great additions to an already stellar cast.

Any political issues discussed in this 18 episode series(only episode #1 and episodes #11-18 are on these 2 discs from Part 2) are very basic and most have been done in much more detail on the far superior West Wing(this is also what creator Rod Lurie says on his commmentary track;so we agree).

Notes:
-Luckily,the final episode doesn't end in a cliff-hanger,but rather sets up the upcoming battle for re-election against a worthy opponent.

-There will also be an upcoming Commander In Chief Tv movie that I heard Geena Davis mention,when she was being interviewed on The View Tv show,fairly recently.

-The President's son played by Matt Lanter was actually CGI'd (his face was placed over the other actor's face using Computer Generated Imagery),into some scenes from the pilot episode because he replaced the initial actor they hired(since they later decided he didn't look good enough-as I learned from Rod Lurie's good audio commentary).

-In episode #17 @ 18:38 point in the episode,the Chief of Staff wryly says,""I'm betting this President can handle a bow and arrow"",obviously referring to Geena Davis placing 24th out of 28 semi-finalists for the Olympic Archery team in 1999.

-Geena Davis can speak Swedish and is a member of Mensa (her IQ is 140). My IQ is very near 45 on a good day.

DVD EXTRAS:
-A Conversation with Madame President: An OK interview with Geena Davis,featuring her nice smile and friendly nature along with some insight;as well as some clips from the show interspersed between her comments (5 minutes and 53 seconds in length).
GRADE: C+

-Deleted Scenes: 20 deleted scenes(21minutes and 38 seconds in length) taken from some of the 18 episodes of the entire series. Most are short but sweet,with only a few perhaps that shouldn't have been deleted from the actual episodes. Thankfully, there is a 'Play All' deleted scenes choice.
GRADE: C+

-White House Humor,Bloopers and Outtakes:You get to see Geena Davis clown around and make faces before she starts her scenes,as well as seeing many other cast regulars make mistakes. Nothing hilarious,but still funny and enjoyable. I'm sure you'll at least chuckle from time to time and wish there was more than just the 3 minutes and 35 seconds of it.
GRADE: B MINUS

-Audio Commentary for Episode #1-commentary by show creator Rod Lurie: As mentioned before, they included episode #1(the pilot) on this Part 2 DVD set(you can only access it from the Special Features:Commentary section),so they could add Rod Lurie's fine and informative commentary. You learn some behind the scenes secrets(such as Matt Lanter replacing the initial actor chosen for role), roughly what goes into getting a pilot ready for Tv and get to hear some very opinionated comments by Rod Lurie as well. He did however mention that he didn't want to get into any scandalous issues about the show,but still I learned enough from his commentary to recommend it.
GRADE: B

-Audio Commentary for Episode #16:Elephant in the Room-commentary  by writer/producer Dee Johnson: Informative enough but still dull at times.
GRADE: C

SUMMARY:
I enjoyed the entire 18 episode series(only episode #1 and episodes #11-18 are on this DVD Season 1 Part 2 set)of Commander In Chief,with episode #1 being my favorite. I also enjoyed all the episodes that focused on the President's children.

Unfortunately,having seen the far superior West Wing Tv series as well,Commander In Chief pales in comparison. However,the lighter nature of Commander In Chief makes it a more relaxing and less cerebral minded show that focuses more on family values,as well as how a close-knit family deals with being in the spotlight 24 hours a day,without completely falling apart. It has a strong heart and enough solid acting to keep you rooting for this First Family and all those they care about. God Bless America (and Canada too).

79535,5,0788872796,"My husband and I could hardly wait each week to see this show.  We totally believe it is one of the BEST shows ever.  Geena Davis does an AMAZING job acting out her role and character.  What class.

I agree, some of the problems and their conclusions may not have been exactly realistic, but hey, who wants total realism??  Take a look around gang...  check it out.  Our ""real"" government has so many crooks running things, it is just refreshing seeing how it SHOULD be done.  I would NOT have watched this show if it had been written and portrayed as things are now in the political world.

Let me also say that I am proud and thankful to be an American.  A citizen.  I am thankful for the freedoms we enjoy in this country.  Seeing this show makes me want to protect it even more.

I agree, the cover art sucks.  It looks cheap and B-rated. This show was a class act, and I too, hope that someday it will be picked up by some cable channel and continued.  Can we vote on that?",1157414400,11,978,4.210810810810811
79536,3,0788872796,"""Commander in Chief,"" ABC's 2005-06 series starring Geena Davis as Mackenzie Allen, the first woman president of the United States, started off like a sure fire hit and then went slowly but steadily down in the ratings. The show had three different producers, starting with creator Rob Lurie, who helmed the first three episodes, followed by Stephen Bochco, and finally Dee Johnson. However, the vision of the show remained the same, which was to put a woman in the Oval Office and stack the deck against her at each and every opportunity. Obviously the show was compared to ""The West Wing,"" which also offered a look at politics from the perspective of the White House, and provides an interesting perspective for today's post mortem.

The flaw in ""The West Wing"" was the office of the Vice President. In these modern times no President is going to take a Senator from a state like Texas, who was his party's presumptive nominee, and ignore him the way Jed Bartlet did John Hoynes. Then, adding insult to injury, the show had the Republican Speaker of the House force Bartlet to nominee Bob Russell, basically a joke candidate from Congress, so that there would not be a strong Veep positioned to replace Bartlet. The real Congress deal with having a qualified vice president who would not run for re-election when they picked Nelson Rockerfeller and the idea the Republicans would push for and consent to a qualified Vice President a heartbeat away from a President with MS is despicable. But that it nothing compared to what Republicans do on ""Commander in Chief.""

I watched this series just to see how much it would infuriate me each week with its depiction of how politics is played. The nadir of the series is reached in Episode 16, ""The Elephant in the Room."" President Allen suffers a burst appendix and has to be operated on. Her Vice President resigned in the previous episode, and just like on ""The West Wing,"" something happens that forces the Speaker of the House to temporarily be President. But here we are talking about Nathan Templeton (Donald Sutherland), who has never forgiven Allen for not stepping down when the previous president died and letting him become president. There is a crippling airline strike going on and Allen has been trying to negotiate a settlement that will actually work and not lead to another strike down the road. As acting president Templeton solves the problem the way he wants.

Now, when ""The West Wing"" had this situation Josh Lyman went off the deep end accusing the Republicans of wanting to exploit the situation (the kidnapping of Zoey Bartlet) to push through their agenda. His Republican counterpart shot back, ""We're not stupid, Josh. We try to use this to our advantage, it will blow up in our faces. We'd seem callous and unfeeling . . . And anyone who thinks otherwise has a particularly craven way of looking at politics."" Well, ""Commander in Chief"" proved exactly that point in this episode, but their craven way of looking at politics is found throughout the entire series and not just these last eight episodes.

Davis did not deserve to have an opportunity like this ruined because the people who put together this show keep deciding that having a villain like Templeton, whose primary object each week as Speaker of the House was to damage the President in any way possible. In Episode 13, ""State of the Unions,"" somebody supporting Templeton's side slips the ""First Gentleman"" a mickey so that they can publicly embarrass him and the president. Apparently there are no limits to what Republicans will do and because the title character is not a Democrat but an Independent, the show thinks it has insulated itself from attacks for being liberal apologists. However, Allen revives the Equal Rights Amendment in the final episode, which in some circles would get the whole duck comparison thingy going.

The funny part, such as it is, would be that the Washington Press Corp never notices anything that Templeton and his cronies are doing, let along calling them on it. They just roll over and play dead for Templeton, but challenge everything and anything Allen does. I know this is just another indication of how far over the rainbow this show ended up going, but if you whole thesis is that a woman can be president, then it would be nice if the United States she was being president of bore more than a passing resemblance to our own.

Episode 18, ""Unfinished Business,"" was the final one and they actually made some smart movies here as Allen decides that she will run for president by doing her job and never campaigning. If we are going to totally avoid reality, then this is an interesting way of doing it. Of course, when the show has been cancelled and you are wrapping things up you can be bold, say like having three of your kids announce they are having twins. This ""7th Heaven"" reference is not gratuitous, because they got renewed after their ""final"" episode and at this point a ""Commander in Chief"" television movie has apparently been confirmed. I could hope for something different for the encore, but I fully expect more of the same. What a wasted opportunity.",1152748800,6,5145,4.794813979706877
79537,5,0788872796,"I so agree with the rating right above mine. It is not about a person who tries to win a 5 or 6-figure money, job, or love on most of reality TV shows, but offers a lot more. This is one show which is portrayed and produced the closest to our reality as a nation. Granted that a female president is running the country, but other parts of the world are already on line with this concept. I am not sure about others, but if there is a commander-in-chief like the TV show, I would not have any problem following such a leader. If nothing else, the TV show makes me really patriotic every time I watch it.",1152316800,8,602,4.110169491525424

In fact there is no ""Presidential' movie better than this.
White House, Marines, Presidential Entourage, Air Force One, great acting, a cameo with Peter Coyote, but Geena Davis carries the part so damn well that I hope Hillary Clinton will be the next president.
Oh yes..the magnificent although short notes of the background music is so 'Presidential' as well. Everything in this movie slots in nicely and the best thing is that it is so TODAY, with Hillary going for the White House.
