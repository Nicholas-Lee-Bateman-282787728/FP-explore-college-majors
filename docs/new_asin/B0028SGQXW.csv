8357036,3,B0028SGQXW,"I did not have a serious problem playing this DVD, although I could not get track 8 to play at all on my new Blue Ray player. The others played OK, and Track 8 also posed no problem when I played it on my PC. I'm not surprised, however, that others had problems. This is most definitely one of those ""temperamental"" DVD's that seem to have a mind of their own.

Now to the content itself: Very uneven.

The Organs: Two historic instruments. The first, at Amorbach Abbey, is a much rebuilt 18th century original which now has four manuals and a rather homogenous sound. There is nothing wrong with it, but it lacks the spunk and character I like in old organs. Waltershausen, a Trost organ, is more like it. It has that wonderful South German sound with great individuality that one associates with the contemporary Silbermann organs. The pedal stops are especially gutsy and distinctive. It is quite a different sound world from Amorbach.

The program: Well selected with big and small scale pieces chosen to highlight the instruments and the variety of Bach's compositions.

The playing: Whiteley is almost always acceptable, and at times very good. His registrations are well chosen. My big problem with him is a virtual addiction to mordants not found in the score, and a similar predeliction for trills and other ornaments that, for me at least, do nothing but detract from the music. It's as if we are reading a book full of ink smudges and blurs. We don't know if Bach played this way but that's not the real question, which is ""does it work now?"" For me the answer is generally no. I know these pieces very well, so I admit I am imprinted on  a ""straighter"" way of playing them, which is not necessarily the ""right"" way, but certainly has served the majority of performers and listeners very well. Bach was a careful scribe of his music, and I can't escape the conviction that if he wanted to doll up his music to this extent with all these frills and flourishes, he would have written them in, as he does sparingly in many of his works.

The video: Yes, that's a bust of JSB half covered with bees all right. They are live in the video for a short opening segment, where they are accompanied by some cacophanous string chords which seem to have strayed from a Bartok quartet. What any of this has to do with Bach (other than the bust) is beyond me. The producers have also adopted the ""torture the consumer"" mode, not uncommon, of making it impossible to fast forward through this monstrosity, or avoid it when keying up a new selection.

Outside of this, we see Whiteley, the organs, inside the organs, and the churches in great detail and splendor. There seem to be 4-5 cameras in each location. We see the interior working of the keys and trackers moving in real time with the music, which is something not normally seen. There are occasional split screens to good effect, and almost everything works (although I'm sure Whiteley would not object to deletion of a grotesque shot of him from below the chin which makes him look like something from a grade B monster movie).

Despite the excellent video once the playing starts, the producers, perhaps in a stupid attempt to stretch out the time, spend a minute or two before AND AFTER! each piece with shots of Whiteley walking across the church, up to and down from the organ, and back out the church, all in (reverent?) silence with only the LOUD click of his footsteps. They also roll the credits after each segment, no matter how short. This is very inane and annoying, but fortunately, it is possible to fast forward through it, unlike the bee attack.

The Wolff Interview: Five stars for content. Wolff is perhaps the greatest living Bach scholar, and his knowledge is made very accessible in this interview. His English is excellent. Whiteley is the interviewer, and he does an acceptable job. Production: Minus two stars. It is unbelievable that despite the creative and interesting filming of the organ playing itself, the video for the interview is done with a stationery camera that does not move from Wolff's head and torso so much as a millimeter throughout, even when Whiteley is asking his questions, which seem to echo from somewhere off stage. Wolff, of course, is obliged not to move either. To appreciate this interview, turn off the video and just listen to the audio, as there is nothing to see anyway. In contrast, Ton Koopman has a wonderful discussion with Wolff and others (in German) in his fine DVD of the St. Matthew Passion. It is a model of how such things should be done, as this DVD's interview is a model of how NOT to do it.

It's hard to say whether we will see more of this project. There is much to commend in it, and its idiocies seem to me easy to correct for the next installment. It would be nice if they could include other organists in the project, but I fear we are probably stuck with Whiteley. Anyway, I suppose it could be worse.",1273363200,5,4935,4.585034013605442

Neither play except in my computer's dvd player.  Product info on Amazon and on the package itself indicate ""Plays in all regions.""",1257379200,2,294,5.23404255319149
