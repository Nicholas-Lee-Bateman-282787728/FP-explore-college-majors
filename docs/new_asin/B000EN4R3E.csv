2523711,5,B000EN4R3E,"I thought both Nightwatch and Daywatch were great movies... Nightwatch is darker, where Daywatch is much lighter (funny how that works). Daywatch has more humor and more clever effects, but maintains the story perfectly... There are plenty of twists and quirky dialog... I saw it at the theaters with subtitles, but I am interested to hear how well the DVD is dubbed. I can hardly wait to see the next instalment of the series!",1188259200,11,427,4.783783783783784
2523712,2,B000EN4R3E,I agree with the previous review from ohio.  It could have been sooooo much better. Read the books kids.,1188000000,4,104,4.473684210526316
2523713,2,B000EN4R3E,"Let me just start by saying that when I first saw Night Watch, I was really impressed; so impressed that I immediately went out and bought the book Night Watch, Day Watch, and Twilight Watch.  I'm definitely a fan and absolutely love the books.

I just finished seeing this in the theatre and walked away very disappointed. The action sequences seem fewer in this film as compared to Night Watch and the special effects have been cut back for some bizzare reason.  Aside from the end of the movie, I can't realy say that I was impressed with any of the action or special effects sequences.  Now before anyone says anything, keep in mind this is a world inhabited by witches, vampires, Others entering the Twilight,werewolves, shapeshifters, magacians, etc.  There were no vampire sequences, there were no interesting ""magic"" sequences. I believe that there was a 3 second sequence where a parrot turned into a human but that was it.  No werewolves, no vampires (at least not doing anything besides talking!), no spells, nothing.  This is a world built on magic and things ""not of this world"" yet we see hardly any of it!

Aside from those complaints, I was disappointed that the movie followed very little of what was actually in the book.  Even though the movie is called Day Watch, the ideas that are touched upon are based off of the first book, Night Watch.  Don't get me wrong: I know that most movies take liberties with the script and change things up from the original but Day Watch really takes it to the extreme.  I'm surprised the author let the director take such liberties with his work (although I noticed in the credits that the author, Sergei Lukyanenko, also had a hand in writing the screenplay).  In my opinion, I can't see anyone saying, ""Hey, this movie is so good and compelling I think I'll go out and buy the book.""  I felt that the first movie, Night Watch, was fascinating enough to warrant reading Mr. Lukyanenko's work.  What happened this time around?  I should also point out that the story is extremely confusing.  If you haven't read the books I'm afraid that you'll be left thinking, ""Now who is that and what exactly are they trying to do...and why exactly are they doing that?""

Maybe it's just me but I definitely felt that there was a weird sort of campiness injected into the movie.  It felt reminiscent of what many American action directors do: someone does something and then the character makes some sort of witty, comedic remark.  It seemed like there was a 20 minute span were the diretor felt that the film needed to be injected with some artificial and goofy humor (let me just point out the bath/waterfall love scene between Anton and Svetlana...am I the only one that thought that was ridiculous?).  I was left feeling the humor was poorly done and really detracted from the movie.

If you're expecting the movie to bear any resemblence to the book series, then you'll be in for a big disappointment.  As for anyone out there who is saying, ""Well, you just wanted the movie to be idential to the books,"" that's just not true.  The movie Night Watch took quite a few liberties with the actual book but I still felt that it was very entertaining and it left me wanting to see the next installment.  I was hoping for an entertaining, action-packed movie with an engrossing storyline, much in the same vain as the first movie, Night Watch, but instead I left the theatre feeling very disappointed.  I waited for over two months for this film to be released in my town and am really surprised that director/screenwriter, Timur Bekmambatov could make the world of Night Watch so unentertaining this time around.",1187913600,35,3653,4.679186228482003
2523714,5,B000EN4R3E,"Just a heads up, the Pathfinder DVD has a intro preview of Day Watch and it says it's coming to DVD soon, so for those who might think of buying a R5 import, just hold off a little while.

I rate this review as 5 stars because the trailer on the Pathfinder DVD looked awesome.  Much better than Night Watch.",1186358400,,307,4.1
2523715,5,B000EN4R3E,"The basics don't sound like anything special: ""They"" are among us, supernatural forces in opposition, poised for all-out war. Some object of huge mystical power is in play, the only thing that can save humanity from the vampires and others. You know, the usual.

That's the last thing that's usual about this outstanding movie. It's tight-paced - a cliche I may never use again, but if you miss a minute of this movie, you've missed something that matters. Effects are exceptional, from the minor touches you might miss up to set-pieces you might never forget. Some of the characters go almost (but not quite) over the top, possibly in terms of uniquely Russian stereotypes. Even the subtitles have a little extra going for them - a bit of fun that could easily have been driven into the ground.

Lots remains unexplained all the way to the end, but might have made sense if I had seen the first movie. No matter, it's dark, powerful, and exciting. And somehow, I think only a Russian creative team could bring such mastery to scenes of urban desolation.

2523717,4,B000EN4R3E,"Well, not as impressive as the first one. Partly because Nightwatch (first part) showed off all the great ideas in their movie making.

 Acting is much better that in Nightwatch.

 Soundtrack could use some editing : sometimes action on the screen does not confirm to the music on top of that. Good followup story, but sometimes dialogs are too complex to follow. Seems like with this movie director falls to a trap of ""short shots"" 1-3 seconds shots - personaly for me it's a little annoying, but it's everyone's personal preference. Giving it four stars.

Great job - keep it up!

2523718,3,B000EN4R3E,"Very free fantasy, continuation of the adventures of Light and Dark bands of super-human Russian (or something like it) trying to salvage their relationship.  Everything is inconsequential but also extreme.  It represents well the Russian character, or at least its stereotype: it looks like a hard night drinking, a lot of lights and nothing really happening.  But in its own terms is better than the feeble attempts of the American industry to impress us with CGI that is done cheaper in Eastern Europe.  The director of this film would do an incredible second unit helmet in greener lands.  Is this cinema?  Well, is more cinema than some script-based attempts at drama which I saw lately (""Transamerica"", for example).  At least the man here thought about something called frame.",1148860800,5,783,5.0703125

2523742,3,B000EN4R3E,"After the tough ending of the last film, Light Other Anton Gorodetsky is back in emotional doldrums. He has been partnered with Svetlana to train her in Night Watch duties and abilities. She flirts with him but he's too grumpy and self-absorbed. They are called to investigate a Dark Other who is attacking an old lady in public. On the scene, Anton recognizes the boy as his son, who has joined the Dark Others because he thinks his dad wanted to kill him in his mother's womb (it's complicated, see the first movie). Naturally he wants to protect his son from harm, but the son is very powerful and could trigger the end of the world. The Others have the ability to go into the Gloom, a sort of alternate dimension of human reality. There is a sub-level of the Gloom that only the most powerful Others can enter. The son flees there and Svetlana follows. Anton can't go there, so she is clearly more powerful (she almost triggered the end of the world in the last movie). The boy escapes and tension mounts as Anton tries to cover his son's tracks and avoid a murder rap for a Dark Other who has mysteriously died.

One possible tool Anton could use is the Chalk of Fate, which allows the user to go back in time and do things differently. The movie opens with a scene in ancient Asia where a guy named Tamerline breaks into the fortress protecting the Chalk and steals it. He eventually dies and legend has it the Chalk is buried with him in his tomb. Can Anton sneak off to Samarkand and save his own family, if not the whole world?

The movie has a lot of story elements woven into it and not all are fully developed. At one point the Inquisitors show up. They are a group of people who keep the treaty between the Dark and Light Others, which is fully explained in the books but comes out of left field in this movie (they were not mentioned in the first film and it seemed that the Dark and Light were enforcing the treaty on each other). Other parts of the storytelling are choppy as well. The ending is satisfying morally but does feel like a cheat narratively.

The special effects are amazing but not as inventive as in the first film. The scale is much larger and more things happen in the real world, less in the Gloom. The highly stylized subtitles of the first film are gone, though I'd say that was because the first film didn't do well at the American box office so they put less effort into subtitling the sequel. It's a shame because the subtitling added to the mystique of their world.

If you liked the first film, definitely watch this one to see the end of the story. But this film doesn't really stand on its own and is not as good as the first film.",1452729600,,2674,4.342

2523790,5,B000EN4R3E,"Ok,, to all my Americanski friends, Daywatch has just made into my all time top ten movies... OMG insanity spectacular....... You have to watch Night Watch and then Day Watch.. Truly some of the most interesting and creative movie making I have seen in a while. : Timur Bekmambetov is a visionary master..... The vampires are refreshing change from the romance chick flick love stories that have come out of America over the decades. There are good and bad vampires, and the bad ones are just mischievous evil buggers. I found my self really on my toes wanting to find out if Anton makes it out alive. I loved the special effects and overall imagery. Timur and Channel One did such a great job on these two movies. I love how when things get crazy, they crank up the rock music and speed up the action in the scenes. At the end there is one final bet between good and evil and when you see the result you just want to say hell yeah Anton. Konstantin Khabensky is a great actor who brings you into his character, even with the English subtitles. then the coolnees of who they did the subtitles of the dark ones, with fading red like blood, the subtitles reacted to the scene like when Kyotos father was playing the drum and the words bounced with the beat or when they throw meat on the wall and the subtitles splatter on the wall. Such a great movie, and series. Night watch and Day Watch are two of a trilogy though the third is either still in production. If you like to see Russian culture and the sites and sounds of Moscow you will enjoy this movie for that fact as well. The scenes of Moscow destroyed from the various battled of the great dark & light ones is epic. Definitely worth renting... break away from vampires of the US who have strange love triangles and babies, an watch a movie with dark twist and truly evil bad asses.",1425254400,3,1838,4.392961876832844

2523797,5,B000EN4R3E,"Very good movie.  Lots of nuances.  It starts quickly and takes a few minutes to get caught up, but once you figure out the plot, it's tough to stop watching.  It took me a while to get the basics of the rules they have to follow; dark vs. light.  And after using the glasses at the beginning, they didn't use them much.
It is a whodunit with clues as the movie moves along.  The characters from both side are very well developed; I cared for some and not others.  And the movie moved from one character to another well.  There is a primary protagonist, but we see the progression of other characters as well.
The visual effects are terrific; there's some blood, which usually I don't enjoy, but there's not much too gruesome. You really have to pay attention to the whole screen.  There are effects with the subtitles and some of the effects cross over into the scene.  For instance, there a photo of a soccer player and he animates to wipe away a kiss.

I understand this movie was released on DVD with ""plain vanilla"" subtitles, and if so that's just a travesty. The original subtitles add so much to the film, maybe even enough to offset the loss of nuance that necessarily occurs when one doesn't understand the original language of the film.

The film itself is also stellar. A fascinating twist on the old vampire stories, with lots of creative supernatural tricks of the sleeves of both the Day and Night Watches, but used judiciously rather than as a crutch for the movie to lean on. It borrows so much from decades of sci-fi, fantasy, and adventure, but mainly in the way that all the best films do: taking a good idea and making it its own.

Likewise its style. There's plenty of John Woo, Guy Ritchie, and others here, but at the same time, the final amalgam belongs to the Day Watch itself.

Like a lot of highly entertaining sci-fi and adventure, it's good being able to suspend disbelief. These folks are _supernatural_ after all. Even so, one of the things that makes the movie so good is that the characters are so human, sympathetic and with depth.",1410739200,,1225,4.714953271028038

You can watch with a decent English dubbing or in the original Russian with a great English subtitling job.  Your choice along with Spanish and French dubbing and subs in Spanish, Cantonese, Mandarin and Korean.

Even for being sub-titled, I really like both movies.  These movies are both classic examples of the battle between good and evil, with a Russian twist.  If you watch one, you will most likely want to watch the other.  The Chalk of Fate is just a little bit better than the first movie, as the special effects are incredible in the sequel.

2524029,3,B000EN4R3E,"Daywatch is the sequel of Nightwatch, a movie that created a whole new and interesting take on movie monsters.
In Nightwatch Anton is part of, what else, the Nightwatch. These are daywalkers who police the nightwalking monsters (as the nightwalkers police the Daywalkers).
As an example, if a vampire wants to feed he has to have a permit and there are restrictions, like no witnesses, and usually the victims cant be killed just drained enough. Anton discovers his son is starting to manifest his powers. This means that he will have to choose to be a daywalker or a nightwalker.

I'll leave the first movie there except to say that visually it is incredible to watch and the story keeps you interested.

In Daywatch Anton's son has chosen and Anton is very unhappy with how he feels his son was manipulated by both sides. He decides he needs to rescue his son from his new friends and thus this movie, which I'll also stop now.
Viually this movie was not as impressive as the first but then second movies are more about plot than grabbing an audiences interest.

There was to be third movie (Twilight watch) but complications and conflicts in scheduling and the usual crap going on with denying an audience of the resolution of a cliff hanger occurred.

A couple of things.
these movies were directed by Timur Bekmambetov, a Russian director who was supposed to make the 3rd but didnt, although I have seen that when he was pressed for a time frame on the 3rd , by a Russian interviewer after he directed Wanted, he said that if you wanted the 3rd sequel watch Wanted.
These movies are Russian and dubbed. If you're peavish about how good or bad dubbing is then you aren't really interested in seeing the film so I'll leave that there.
The movies are all based on books; NightWatch, Daywatch, Twilight watch, Last watch, and End Watch.
these books have so much more going on in them, if you compare it to say Peter Jackson's Hobbit, each book would likely be 5 movies to a book to stay faithful to the entire story. So Im not going to say read the books to understand the movies (cause if you cant understand a movie without reading its source book then the movie is just a badly written mess.) to understand the movies.
However the books are phenomenal on their own. the books each have lots of characters with lots of interweaving that always get wrapped up satisfactorily but do make you want to read the next to find out more about the characters.  So definitely read the books if you are into this sort of fiction. It took forever for them to be translated to English from Russian. I had to wait about 3 years for each book even though they had been out for awhile in Russia. And they were worth the wait.
the movies are enjoyable on their own and watching them will not leave you puzzled about who that character was or why did she say that. they stand alone very nicely.

Lastly this director has probably made movies that youve seen and didn't know he was that guy; Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, 9, or Apollo 18.
He is good at fantasy movies, monsters, and tension, and this and Nightwatch were 2 of his first.

2524034,5,B000EN4R3E,"I've stumbled upon this fantastic Russian movie, due to searching for subtitled movies specifically, because of Amazon's severe lacking of Closed Captioned content.  This movie was a pleasant surprise.  Even this movie's subtitles were very well done -- it doesn't have that standard ugly ""yellow font"" look - but rather a bolder white font with thin outlines, and even reverses itself in black against the white scenes.  The subtitles themselves were surprising, because the movie director has decided that the English subtitles would interact with the scene, such as some words going poof up in smoke, words bouncing to the beat of a drum in one scene, some words becoming blood during a vampire scene.  Very cool effects done to the subtitles.  This was a huge pleasant surprise for this Deaf movie watcher.

The story itself was a fantastic surprise -- I didn't know what to expect of a movie out of Russia.  This was a fantastic story.  It was very enjoyable, since there were no ""big name"" actors in this -- virtual unknowns, at least to me.  I love watching movies when I don't know the actors, which makes the characters very enjoyable to watch.

I can't do it justice... it's just something that's gotta been watched.  A fun ride indeed.  I've just discovered there's an earlier one, ""Night Watch."" Which I am planning to watch asap.  Just a fun all-around movie.",1377648000,,1372,4.836909871244635

One of the most notable aspects of this movie was the subtitles actually.  I do not speak Russian and I am thankful I don't so I can see these subtitles.  I have never seen subtitles that added so much to the movie, they move, they are colored in spots, they help add to the story and just do something I have never seen done in a movie.

2524081,3,B000EN4R3E,"I speak Russian and English, the latter more fluently than the former. The translations in this movie were god awful. Most of the translations were no where near accurate. This is for all the dialogue not just expressions that were hard to translate. Of course, you could still watch the movie, read the English subtitles and understand the movie but quite a bit is lost.

Also, I viewed this movie before I viewed the previous movie in the series, since I didn't know that a previous movie existed. Also, I'm reviewing this movie as a singularity and not as part of a series. Thus, this review should be taken with a grain of salt. With that said, I'm assuming the movie relied heavily on the previous movie to make connections because I left the movie rather confused. Great special effects but a lot was left unexplained and a lot of the film didn't have continuity. For example, at one point, two characters are fighting. One character, from the side of dark we'll call him V, is fighting to capture Anton and another from the side of light is fighting to save Anton, we'll call her A. So, A is standing next to V, crashing buses into him, and basically cutting up his face while V is trying to capture Anton. Anton manages to escape. Later and near the end of the movie, we find out that the dark side is trying to start a war and that in order to do this the light side needs to make someone from the dark side bleed. So, the dark side puts this great plan in motion in order for this to happen. But wait.... didn't this already happen quite a while ago? As far as lack of explanation an example is the gloom. Anton has limited powers and can only travel into certain depths of the gloom. This is as far as the movie goes into this explanation. The gloom seemed like a cool facet of the movie but it was hardly touched upon. What was it? What was it's purpose? And if Anton had limited powers and couldn't travel far into the gloom why do we see him waltz into the very center of the dark sides fortress with absolutely no problem and without any sort of increase in power? These are just some of the things that left me boggled at the end of the movie. Still, the movie had great action scenes and great special effects which made me give it a few stars.

In all, I'm hoping that the movie will make more sense once I go and watch the previous movie in the series.",1349136000,,2371,4.302013422818792

either way, understanding is not essential. much of both films feels like the story is made up as it goes along...that's it strength AND weakness. in places, it's fun; at other times, you're rolling your eyes. there are occasional great visual moments. and the old story of good-versus-evil comes thru...albeit with a ton of distraction, loose ends, and artifacts thrown in out of nowhere.

if you don't try to make sense of it, and take it as entertainment...it's fairly entertaining. but it's no 'matrix'...it's not even 'southland tales'.

I believe there is a 3rd 'Watch', but I've yet to pick it up.  If you are a fan
of films such as ""300"" or the ""Lord of Rings"" where there is an epic struggle
between good and evil in the world as it is projected, they you have to catch
both of these films.  As an older viewer of movies of all types, I expected
the fist one to be turned-off after the first 15 minutes.  Not so folks, these
2 are just great, and I watched each one from start to end trying to get a
handle on the story as well as keep focused on the rules of the game and the
vision of the director.  The characters are all developed and one has to keep
up with each of them and who and what they represent.  I'm really sure that
the younger viewers will find this series interesting:  the 'dark ones' have
relationship to vampires, but not necessarily is that the main theme of the
films.  The struggle and rules that keep things in balance and who breaks the
rules, makes the 2 epics quite interesting.  I watched on a 34"" Vizio with
an ancient surround system with monster sound. The visuals and virtual surround
fills the entire room with action and the screen has the feel of the projected
objects moving in 3D.  If you can get these in 3D or Blue Ray they are well-worth
the investment.  Being foreign, they're just a bit different:  dubbed and sub-
titled, but either way, it's a great show.  Rich Holst, Phila, Pa",1317772800,2,1548,4.260273972602739

This is a great story about fatherly love (not only Anton and Yegor relationship), responsibility and sacrifice.

Day Watch tries to succeed, it really does, but it's not that the movie is too ambitious. The main fault with the movie is that the concepts introduced in Night Watch only make for one movie. Any further movies and the concept is exposed as being, for lack of a better word, stupid. Nothing is really explained.

Yes, it's visually impressive (though less stylised than Night Watch), yes it's packed full of action, and yes it's amazing that all this was done on a tiny budget.

The crammed and convoluted plot is constantly manipulated in order to fill the action quotient.

The trailer made the movie look really cool, with Rob Zombie music, neato bullet time effects, sharp colors. So the next night I went out and bought it for $5 used at blockbuster.

an hour and a half later, it was in my garbage can.

This is by far the worst movie. And I'll tell you why.

One thing the trailer neglected to mention. The movie....its Russian. Woulda been nice if the trailer had even one line of dialogue from the movie. Now I see why it was left out of the trailer. Ugh.

I don't hate Russia or anything, but they look like they tried to spice up the location shooting and all everything else, make it bright and futuristic. But you see right through that...in the end, everything looks like cheap, depressing, uninteresting post communist filthy Russia.

The plot is non existent. Something about vampire hunters, but i never saw one vampire. In fact, i remember the entire plot being centered around finding a magical artifact that holds the fate of the universe....and that artifact is....

A piece of chalk.

no joke. literally, its a piece of chalk. and...it just so happens the whole time its in this filthy little restaurant the main character happens to frequent. its been there the whole time. i think. i wasn't paying much attention.

ya know..bullet time effects are done man. the matrix was cool when it had it, but now those are everywhere, in every movie. even the russians are using them in their terrible action epics. maybe action movies as a whole should just lay off bullet time effects.

Some dumb girl drives a car on the side of a building. lame. and its only a mazda.

there was this really long scene where nasty old people are drinking and laughing at a party in slow motion with close ups of their faces. it was gross. and some demon kid with a yo-yo...with a chase in an old crappy truck in the snow....if you make it to this part of the movie, im sure you will have the mad urge to shut it off ASAP like i did. this is where my dvd went in the trash.

2524114,3,B000EN4R3E,"Timur Bekmambetov's ""Day Watch"" has the look and feel of a deliberately manufactured ""cult phenomenon.""  This in-your-face, aggressively stylish sequel to the hit Russian film ""Night Watch"" tells a hyper-kinetic but largely incoherent tale of vampires from another dimension who keep crossing over into the ""real world"" to wreak all sorts of havoc on the people who live there.  Anton and Svetlana are two law enforcement officials trained to combat these otherworldly terrorists.

It doesn't much matter if the story itself doesn't make a whole lot of sense, since ""Day Watch"" is really all about atmosphere and style anyway.  The ginned-up editing, the frenetic camerawork, the subtitles dancing all over the screen, and the twisty/turny scenario involving shape-shifting, body-switching secret agents all add up to a full two-hours-and-eleven-minutes worth of migraine-inducing sensory overload (not unlike a Robert Rodriguez film on crack).  Yet, for all that, the film is never boring and, indeed, all the visual and auditory stimuli makes it virtually impossible for one to tear one's eyes off the screen even for a moment.

2524119,4,B000EN4R3E,"I'm not usually one to harp on the differences when a book is turned into a film.  The fact that the author of the books worked on the screenplay shows that perhaps he was able to make changes that were needed for a book to film translation. I was surprised at how many differences there were however but I guess on the flip side this kept things surprising, as the plot was not the same as the novels.  As others have said the movie will be very hard to follow if you haven't seen the first movie, Night Watch.

The Good

As in Night Watch the visuals are excellent. I especially liked the scenes at the Dark party near the end. There were a lot of frenetic scenes however. I'm a fan off the director's style but these scenes work best when contrasted with slower paced sequences. When there is a constant barrage of these action scenes it film becomes monotonous and tiring. Night Watch seems almost calm compared to the amount of active scenes in Day Watch. It felt like the director had to top himself from the effects in the previous film. I would have traded many of these sequences for more focus on the plot and characterization.

The acting was well done, many of the characters have different motivations but there personalities were interesting. The character of Zabulon received a much more fleshed out role in the film.

The Bad

The script was frankly a mess. The books are difficult to translate to film since they mostly consist of short episodes but parts of stories were taken and mixed in with others, some characters were changed or excluded. The movie felt like it was made up as it went along. Some of the transitions and pacing are very awkward.  An example is when Anton and Olga are on a plane to find an item. She tells him its not there and suddenly Anton is back in Moscow and Olga is nowhere to be found. In some ways it feels like two movies condensed into one, I enjoyed it but the pacing is all over the place.

I recommend reading the books. They are much more evenly paced and as books allow for greater depth with the characters. Day Watch was entertaining but lacked the focus of the first film.  I would give the visuals a 5 and the pacing, script a 3 so 4 is the average.",1216598400,,2209,4.365853658536586
2524120,5,B000EN4R3E,"A few years ago I saw Nightwatch in theathers accidentally and left feeling confused and not really liking it, but days later  still had that movie on my mind. I soon realized why I didn't like it-at first. These movies are probably the most original movies since the early 1980s when Bladerunner, Aliens, Star Wars, etc...popularized the new genre combination of action sci-fi horror. Unlike those films, and the millions that copied them, Nightwatch delivers the same package but in a totally different and selfish way.
Daywatch is a much better movie than Nightwatch. The budget and effects are like night and day between the two respectively. After I eventually appreciated Nightwatch, the only flaw I could give it is that it had low budget feel in terms of production and design. Here Daywatch ramps that up exponentially and also ramps up the action, style and plot exponentially!
I love the originality of both  movies and Daywatch must be the best sequel in the history of sequels. The saturation of Russian culture, style and personality into these films is a bit of a shock at first but you get to love it and appreciate the way its done. I've never seen a Russian or Eastern European movie that made me think ""hey, I should go visit there"" until these movies. I expect more goodies like this from Russia and this director/producer in the future. The cast was also brillant in acting and carried the plot well. I  also like the decentralization of the main character. In Hollywood or western story telling everything centers around good vs. bad and good is usually our hero and we follow him/her for 2 hours on the screen whiles him/her try to stop the bad.
In these films good can be bad and bad can be very entertaining! The story follows everyone and that makes everything in the story count for something. I know it sounds confusing but when you see this film you will get what Im saying around the time they Lights try to hide Anton.
5 stars!!! Definately in my all time top ten movies next to Bladerunner (for pace), 2046 (for cinematography), Alien (for kick azz-ness), Brazil (for wow factor), THX1138 (for originality), even the timeless classic Casablanca is well rivaled via the sweet romance we get in Daywatch.",1214870400,18,2234,4.752577319587629

One of the first draws to Night Watch for me was the subtitle play.  The fact that they were actively incorporated in the film itself was really cool.  I saw the sequel in the theaters in the first week and walked away feeling that it was even better than Night Watch.  For one thing, it developed many of the background characters much more thoroughly.  For another thing, the subtitles again were really fun to watch...almost advancing the plot themselves.

Then...I saw the DVD.  Had I seen this on DVD first, there is no question about it...I would have probably HATED this movie.  The plain white subtitles really took a LOT from the movie quality.  I may also be mistaken that other things were removed (though I can't think of any example).

2524127,3,B000EN4R3E,"Let me first start this review by saying that you have to have seen the first film ""Night Watch."" Though its sequel ""Day Watch"" begins with the introductory section explaining what happened in the original, it is too short and fast, quite tough to follow even for those who have seen the first one. Moreover, you cannot fully understand the meanings of the concluding chapters of ""Day Watch"" without seeing some of the episodes in the predecessor.

In ""Day Watch"" there are so many things going on - vampires, sorcery, etc - plus so many characters - some interesting, others just dull. There are also ""Chalk of Destiny,"" an impending war between the forces of Darkness and Light, and a very campy shower scene. Whatever you have seen in the preceding ""Night Watch"" such as the father-son theme between Anton (Konstantin Khabensky) and his son Yegor, is almost forgotten or takes a different turn in the second film.

What you see here instead is a series of loosely connected episodes. So Anton is now seen training a young intrepid partner (Mariya Poroshina), but Anton is accused of what he didn't do and next we are told that his son is ""Great Dark One"" and there is also ""Great Light One"" and ... in short, the overwritten script is simply a mess.

Still you can enjoy the film for what it is, a Russian dark fantasy with many imaginative and entertaining set-pieces. The director Timur Bekmambetov certainly has great visual style and the film's playful subtitles are also unique and interesting to see. I sincerely wish that he uses more coherent storyline for the third installment.",1203206400,3,1590,4.774545454545454

Although unnecessary, they way they do the subtitles in the first two work well (far better than dubbing). I advise you to see Night Watch first, you kinda hit the ground running with this one.

Anyway, I really like the look and feel of these two movies and the take on the Vampire genre is really cool, just when you thought the Vampire thing was played out, this comes along. Maybe I am just easily amused, it's just that I didn't want the movie to end.",1203206400,,557,4.407766990291262
2524129,3,B000EN4R3E,"Who knew the russians could make decent movies???  Anyway, I was fortunate enough to have heard of Nightwatch before the advetisements came out for this sequel.  It uses the same cast in both movies and I guess someone could watch this and enjoy it on it's own.  The entire final 1/3 of this movie refers back to all the events that happened in the first movie.  In this you only get tiny little clips to show the connections, but none of the whole back story of the lead character, his wife, his nearly unborn son and why this ""apocalypse"" was approaching.

I honestly do not consider this to be a true horror movie or it's predecessor, but it does have some very cool special effect scenes and the storyline is at least logical and fairly easy to follow if you watch both movies.  I also think that since the story is ""over"", they do not need to make any further sequels.",1202688000,,873,4.391304347826087

2524131,3,B000EN4R3E,"A few things you need to know about Daywatch: it's a dark urban fantasy made by Russians, a sort of World of Darkness (if you're familiar with White Wolf's eponymous game line) or, if you prefer, Underworld.  In this version of urban fantasy, which now seems to be its very own genre, every Halloween-type critter coexists: ghosts, vampires, werewolves all live in unhappy harmony just outside human perception.

There are two factions at work: the Daywatch, the dark-type bad guys who lurk in the night, and the Nightwatch, the beings of light who watch over the evil that supernatural monsters do.  The two sides have made a truce of sorts to keep the other in balance and avoid all-out war.  Each side has its own Chosen One, and if these two Chosen Ones happen to fight, it will be the end of the world.  Our hero, Anton Gorodetsk (Konstantin Khabensky) just happens to be the connection between the two: his girlfriend and partner, Svetlana, in the Nightwatch team and his son, Yegor, who is corrupted by the Daywatch gang led by Zevulon. The two forces threaten to tear Anton apart.  Literally - at one point, Yegor and Svetlana pull on Anton's arms as the building splits apart beneath him.

The first mistake I made was assuming that I could watch Daywatch without watching Nightwatch.  I didn't read the book. I have no idea if Nightwatch established more information about the characters, but I hope so, because I was very confused by the end of the film.

The second mistake I made was my assumption that Russians always sitting around in grubby apartments drinking Vodka is a stereotype.  Either the director (Zuberbuehler) was intentionally pandering to the stereotype or that's how it really is there.  Whatever the case: there's a lot of smoking, a lot of drinking, and a lot of partying in Daywatch.

What's so refreshing about Daywatch is the complete disregard for American film tropes.  It reminded me a lot of Brotherhood of the Wolf, wherein a director takes his vision and sculpts it without kowtowing to the ""way movies are supposed to be."" Special effects are used on things no American director would even bother with: there's a thrilling scene where a car drives up a building that seemingly exists for the sole purpose of showing off how cool the driver is. At various times Daywatch is beautiful and grotesque, frenetic and achingly slow, overdramatic and subtle.  The film starts, stops, and starts again with little regard to whether or not the viewer can keep up.

The subtitles deserve their own mention: this is the first film I've ever seen that animated the subtitles themselves, so that they do neat things to emphasize what's happening on screen: fading away, appearing in front of and behind objects, appearing in a particular order, and turning from red to white and back again.

Nothing's what you'd expect in Daywatch.  For all the shapeshifters and vampires, there's just one shape shifting parrot (?!) and no neck biting at all. Baba Yaga is accompanied by a coterie of dolls mounted on spider bodies. There's some business with magic chalk.  There's time travel. There's a whole sequence involving body- and gender-swapping. And the world nearly ends through the use of a really deadly yo-yo. No, really.

It's difficult to discern what the rules are that governs the supposed catastrophic war.  Perhaps in the same way Godzilla embodied fears about the atom bomb, Daywatch seems to be more concerned about the apocalyptic event when the two Chosen Ones meet than the war that ensues anyway - Daywatch and Nightwatch regularly clash, mobilize troops, and destroy large chunks of real estate.  For two groups supposedly trying to avoid a war, they sure don't act like it.  Maybe that's a statement on the Cold War itself.",1202169600,3,3764,4.857589984350548

2524139,5,B000EN4R3E,"but this time around, Bekmambetov and the gang take themselves rather less seriously.

This is the second installment in the film trilogy based on the series of fantasy novels by Russian writer Sergei Lukyanenko. There's much less physical pain and spurting blood than in the first movie, Night Watch (which really should be seen first for one to fully understand Day Watch), but the special effects are still over the top, and everybody seems to be having a lot more fun.

Konstantin Khabensky returns as Anton Gorodetsky, the brave but bumbling Night Watch agent who can't seem to stay out of trouble. His life hasn't improved much since he found out that he has a twelve-year old son, Yegor, who is potentially the most powerful Other of all time. The boy is now under the tutelage and watchful eye of Zavulon, the malevolent leader of the Dark Others, and Anton believes that it's his own fault that Yegor has chosen the Darkness. He's also in love with his beautiful, much more talented Night Watch trainee Svetlana but too insecure to declare himself.

Svetlana unknowingly puts Anton on the trail of the Chalk of Fate and the chance to correct his biggest mistake and save the World from the ultimate mega-battle between Good and Evil.  Khabensky makes Anton even goofier and more charming than he did in Night Watch, rushing head long into the mystery of the Chalk (by midnight flight to Uzbekistan), barely avoiding being arrested - and worse - by the Day Watch for a murder he didn't commit, finding himself in someone else's body, trying to reconcile with Yegor, and fessing up to Svetlana.  We viewers find ourselves as out of breath as he is as he runs every where in his desperation.

2524143,4,B000EN4R3E,"Set in the universe established in the movie NIGHT WATCH, DAY WATCH follows Anton Gorodetsky as he struggles with his own inner demons while saving the world from destruction. It has been a few years since Anton's confrontation against Zavulon (Viktor Verzhbitsky) when Anton's son, Yegor (Dmitry Martynov) chose to join the Dark Ones. Anton has had little contact with Yegor since that day, but misses him dearly. In the meantime he has risen even farther in the ranks of the Night Watch and is helping to train Svetlana (Mariya Poroshina). He's extremely attracted to her, but hasn't told her that Yegor, now a powerful member of the Dark, is his son.

Meanwhile, Zavulon believes that Anton has become too much of a distraction, especially to Yegor who is on the verge of maturity and sets into motion a plan to rid himself of Anton for good. When members of the Dark are murdered, the Day Watch files a warrant with the Inquisition for Anton's capture. His friends attempt to protect them as best they can, but the only way that Anton can reverse the things that have happened is to find the fabled Chalk of Fate and reverse all the chaos his life has caused.

I was extremely excited to see DAY WATCH. I had seen NIGHT WATCH and was blown away by it. However, after watching the film a couple of times through, I am still disappointed. Like NIGHT WATCH, DAY WATCH is filled with some remarkable special effects, for example the car driving around the building, the party scene, and the split in the hotel that threatens literally to rip Anton apart. The visual elements of the film are almost as impressive as some of the things in the first film. But, only almost. Other than one or two scenes, things really aren't as impressive.

I also found the story to be rather confusing. For instance, there is lots of talk about something called the Gloom, something I'm still not really sure what it is; there's a completely unnecessary scene between Anton and Svetlana beneath a waterfall; there's a toy aluminum ball that Zavulon and Yegor play with throughout the movie that turns out to be a deadly weapon; etc. These things in and of themselves aren't all that confusing, but when placed together along with the mostly psychological aspects of the film as Anton struggles to find a balance in his life and not fall into the Dark make for a somewhat haphazard movie watching experience.

I also found some of the comic elements thrown into the film to be a bit distracting, especially when Anton and Olga (Galina Tyunina) switch bodies. I understand the reason that the characters do the switch, but it really doesn't achieve much of a purpose other than for laughs and to have a borderline lesbian scene between Anton-as-Olga and Svetlana.

There was some protesting about NIGHT WATCH when it was released that the movie was too American and Hollywood and wasn't a true Russian movie. I thought that NIGHT WATCH was very little like a Hollywood picture. However, DAY WATCH has all the undertones of a big budget Hollywood movie, including breaking box office records (DAY WATCH was the most watched Russian film of any in the post-Communist era) and a poorly written script.

It was a little confusing but it was easy to piece together the story line. The vampire bit was a little interesting point, because that's when my brain went ""huh?"" but dutifully it filed it away to be thought of later.

The Dark Forces are winning because the Chosen one has decided to join them. Is it possible to change the destiny, to undo one deed in the past that could destroy the universe?

The second movie in the series was as entertaining, dark, and funny as the first one, and the ending really made it for me. The scene of apocalypse - Moscow style was very impressive but behind the eye-popping effects and crazy car races, there was really an interesting story about the mistakes we make and how it is almost impossible to predict their significance, leave alone to correct them. There were also stunningly beautiful girls on both sides of Good and Evil, running and fighting on high (very) heels.

I find it baffling that someone made the decision to not include them even as an option.

2524164,5,B000EN4R3E,"I was blown away when I initially watched Nightwatch, and eagerly awaited the sequel--and of course the marketing geniuses managed to foul the release up. I think it played in 2 theaters when it was released. Anyways, everything but the kitchen sink was thrown into this production.

The dvd comes in a 2:35 anamorphic widescreen--5.1 DD, director's commentary, making of featurette. It's a mini special edition, oh and it's Unrated too.

I've read a few reviews that condemn its story structure. I'd suggest watching this and absorbing it. This film (and Nightwatch) are visual collages. Both films were made for 4 million dollars a piece. Hollywood should take notice. These are epic tales--and succeed at every level.

I have not read the books, so I can't comment on that. There is no trailer for Twilight Watch--and Daywatch pretty much wraps up the entire original story arc.

What's even cooler is that the director's new film comes out in March '08, called ""Wanted"". The actor that plays the lead in Nightwatch/Daywatch is the main bad guy in that.

I look forward to more of Timur's work.

A final note, Fox opted not to include the ultra cool animated english subtitles into this release. This version has regular white font subs.

2524165,1,B000EN4R3E,"The novel ""Night Watch"" is split into 3 stories. The first movie, ""Night Watch"" is an adaptation of the first story (with a snippet of the prolog from the 2nd book). The second movie, ""Day Watch"" is a mish-mash of the 2nd and 3rd stories in the first book.

There are two essential plotlines in Day Watch and neither is given enough attention to really flesh things out. The first story involves someone killing dark others without permission. This threatens the balance between Night Watch and Day Watch, particularly when Anton is framed for the crimes.

The second story involves the Chalk of Fate and the struggle over its use.

Both of these stories are fleshed out and interesting in the novel but are completely incomprehensible in the film. Had they simply focused on one or the other (and ignored the story about Yegor and his birthday and all that) this could have been a fine successor to the first film.

As it is, it's a noisy mess filled with action sequences that don't make any sense, characters that lack motivation and development, and a non-sensical almost Star Trek like happy ending where everything is reversed.

I haven't been this disappointed in a movie sequel since ""Faraway, So Close"" and that includes ""The Matrix: Reloaded"".

I thought Night Watch was great, this is a poor follow-up. Read the books instead.",1193875200,13,1337,4.791304347826087
2524166,5,B000EN4R3E,"This was a highly enjoyable movie.  Now, mind you, it has little to do with the book series outside of the same characters - it was (very, extremely) loosely adapted from the latter part of the ""Night Watch"" novel, so don't expect it to at all relate to ""Day Watch"" the book.  Like the first movie, there was a lot of great action and watching Anton get his butt kicked all over the place - which hey, that's why we love him, right?  Not to mention the whole scene at Yegor's party.  But you'll have to watch it to see that - it's just a good thing the old witch wasn't holding a grudge after her 12 years in the zoo as a toad (definitely HAVE to WATCH IT *grin*).

We watched it in Russian with the subtitles.  They weren't as much a part of the movie as the original - but they still occasionally were created so be a part of the scenery.

(EDIT): After watching the added features, I am even more impressed with this  movie.  The birthday party scene was filmed in a most unique manner.  The director simply rounded up a bunch of people (if I recall correctly, it was a business conference) and gave them free food and drink.  After a couple of hours, when everyone was nice and buzzed, they started filtering in the actors and filming.  This sort of off-the-cuff manner of filming was an enormous risk but it paid off brilliantly - most of the people in that scene, in the background, are really just people at a party, doing what people at a party do.  I was VERY impressed! (/EDIT)

Fans of good sci-fi/action/thrillers will enjoy this, as will people who enjoyed the first movie.  If you haven't yet read the books, do watch the movies FIRST; which is pretty much good advice for any movie adapted from a book.

However...

For those wanting to buy this DVD and expecting to see the animated subtitles that were included in the theaters (And on the US Night Watch DVD) you will be disappointed.  Apparently Fox decided that the subtitles were not worth releasing in their animated form for this first dvd launch, so we are stuck with normal player-based subtitles (white and plain).

A bit of a let down, but perhaps we will get a definitive version later down the line.  Here's to hoping, nyeh?",1193788800,5,707,4.571428571428571
2524168,4,B000EN4R3E,"With an intricately clever story filled with love, hate, revenge, and chalk, and heightened by an abundance in imaginative imagery bordering on visceral assault, Day Watch manages to cement itself in the rare circle of sequels that surpasses their predecessors in quality and entertainment. And as the perfect companion piece to his previous sci-fi fantasy, Night Watch, Timur Bekmambetov succeeds magnificently. The good versus evil storyline is more prominent this time out, and with the same dark and moody atmosphere (punctuated frequently by bouts of refreshingly bizarre humor) but sporting crazier, more refined special effects and action sequences, Day quickly eclipses Night.

Futuristic Moscow is a place secretly populated by two sects of vampires (Light and Dark) that have long been honoring a shaky truce of peace. Picking up where the first film left off, Anton's (Konstantin Khabensky) son Yegor (Dmitry Martynov) has joined the side of evil, upsetting the delicate truce between the two sides, but not destroying it. Now the side of good has their own Great Other in the form of Svetlana (Mariya Poroshina), and as Anton assumes the task of training her, he also falls in love with the hopeful savior. Still desiring bloodshed, the Dark leader Zavulon (Victor Verzhbitsky) frames Anton for murder and uses Svetlana's feelings for him to create a climactic confrontation with Yegor to ignite a war that will leave the world in darkness. Luckily for the forces of good, there's a fateful piece of chalk that can save them all.

While the synopsis may leave an eyebrow raised, Day Watch manages to organize its bevy of wondrously strange concepts into a surprisingly cohesive storyline; though viewing of its predecessor is strongly recommended. A rather simplistic plot of good versus evil lies at the heart of this epic fantasy, but director Timur Bekmambetov's exponential layers of fictitious history, modern mythology, and futuristic anomalies construct a complexity that may leave anyone who blinks for a second too long scratching their head in confusion. Though both films require a suspension of disbelief as well as a rain check on most explanations of the phenomena that populates this gothic world, it's astonishingly easy to accept due to the fantastical nature of everything presented. There are several levels of attuned awareness in each force, the laws of gravity and physics rarely remain intact, and human transformation into animals is a common occurence. Once introduced to the bizarre elements and loose laws that govern the possible and blur the line of plausible, it's far more beneficial for enjoyment's sake to stop questioning any realism and just accept the oddities that reign. It is fiction after all. Like the Matrix, anything can happen so long as that character believes in it; so too can mindboggling events occur in the Day - the difference being the audience's willingness to accept it.

Though some may negatively critique the complex storytelling foundation upon which the film stands, it would be far harder to justify an ill word against the insanely creative visuals that seem nothing short of inspired. Even if fatal flashlights, using telephone wires as bullwhips, or driving cars along buildings isn't your thing, there's still pounding car chases, exploding buildings, massive battles, and a yo-yo ball of hate-fueled death to vie for your approval. Nonstop movement saturates the film (whether it's an omen or a curse is up to you to decide) and keeps the relatively long running time from halting the pace. Frenetic motion can be witnessed in everything from the camerawork, to the editing, to the subtitles. Even the slow-motion sequences barely feel like a change. The unique usage of moving and morphing captions that almost act out the very actions they represent adds to the breakneck speed, but serves as a reminder to the tragedy of reading subtitles during a movie as visual as this one. And of course said visuals provide an unpredictable display of unrelenting imagination - from a truck crashing through a semi to the hyper-kinetic speed of second level gloom, one can never be too sure what they'll see next.

Another vast improvement over its predecessor is the ample amount of quirky, bizarre humor. Dimitri Kiselev's choice of cuts combined with some truly awkward moments, and Tibur's appropriately inappropriate imagery make from some laugh-out-loud moments - something unexpected but entirely welcome from the normally macabre fantasy. Highlights include a freefall tango, a wimpy parrot-like henchman, and an unlikely body switch that inevitably leads to a shower sequence that begins in a bathtub and ends on a waterfall.

If you knew you could only make one movie before you died, you'd cram every last one of your ideas into it, whether they're good or bad. One might get the feeling that Bekmambetov was under a similar mindset as Day Watch is so jam-packed with insane concepts and ideas ranging from parallels to the Matrix, the Force, and Lord of the Rings to vampires mixed with shapeshifters mixed with jedi. What sets Day above Night is the higher success rate of this culmination of ideas; not all of them are perfect in their outcome, but far more can be categorized as innovatively unique rather than absurdly inconceivable. Basically, what works is far greater than what doesn't, a ratio much less positive in Tibur's previous chapter. And combined with a compelling time-altering love story set against the powers who seek to destroy the world, even relatively asinine concepts like a piece of chalk that can change its user's past, start to fit in with the rest of the surrealistic overtones that lace the whole affair. With all the presumably unanswerable questions raised in this futuristic Moscow, my only one is where will the third film go from here? I wouldn't expect, or want, a simple answer.

2524170,5,B000EN4R3E,"As has been said, the movie has very little to do with the book that shares it's title. Rather, most of it is from the second two ""books"" of Night Watch. Understanding that, I still whole-heartedly recommend this movie to any science fiction or vampire fan, and even fans of the original written series. You may be disappointed by the dissimilarities, but if you keep an open mind, and judge the movie on it's own merits, I think you'll enjoy Day Watch.

I saw this in the theatres, and the subtitling was excellent, as always, and continues to be creatively used and made a living part of the movie. I agree that overall, the movie isn't as dark and depressing as Night Watch, and I'm not a fan of the ending, since it closes off any logical continuation of Anton and Svetlana's story in Twilight Watch. But that's really the only big problem I have. The special effects are NOT overdone, in my opinion, they are used to good effect, and although the plot is complicated, a second or third viewing cleared up a lot of questions. So does reading Night Watch in it's entirety.

Bravo to Fox for not totally ruining a great foreign film, and I'm not sure what the differences will be in this unrated version, but hopefully the DVD will also include interviews with either Sergei Lyukanenko and/or Timur Bekmambetov like Night Watch, where they go into how they designed the movie.
