""Is that a Titliest?""

One of the best scenes in the history of television.

2411855,5,B000BBOUEU,"Not to be a bug, but in the episode ""The Wife"", I distinctly remember the scene of George actually standing in the shower and a quick view of his feet as the pee is supposed to be going down the drain while 'flyboy' is watching in disgust. My DVD copy does not have it. I'm surprised it's not there or at least showing up as a deleted scene. I'm positive that scene still runs on syndication. This is a bad omen. Does this mean the episode about the Puerto Rican Parade will be eliminated from the last season's box too? How about it Castle Rock...Sony...why no pee scene?",1135123200,,572,4.305555555555555

2411859,5,B000BBOUEU,"The laughs just keep coming with ""Seinfeld: The Complete Fifth Season"". ""Seinfeld"" follows the mad-cap misadventures of stand-up comedian Jerry Seinfeld (Himself) and his close group of eccentric friends going through everyday life in New York City. In this season, Jerry becomes the unsuspected spokesperson for a new clothing trend. George (Jason Alexander) uses his marine biologist skills to save the day. Elaine (Julia Louise Dreyfus) discovers a store mannequin that looks like her. Kramer's (Michael Richards) bungling has a profound effect in the mayoral elections of New York City. Created by producer Larry David and star Jerry Seinfeld, ""Seinfeld"" is the breakthrough award-winning comedy series that became one of the most popular television sitcoms. The fifth season is certainly one of the comedy series' best and features some well developed storylines with clever subplots and hilarious comic situations. The season also includes guest appearances by Courteney Cox, Jon Favreau, Jami Gertz, Al Roker and Rudolph Guiliani. This great box set includes such fun episodes as ""The Puffy Shirt"", ""The Non-Fat Yogurt"", ""The Dinner Party"", ""The Hamptons"" and ""The Opposite"".

There is so much to see in ""Seinfeld: The Complete Fifth Season"" Box Set. All 22 episodes are presented in their original full screen format. The box set contains a carefully detailed picture quality and a clear 2.0 Dolby Digital sound. This 4-Disc collection includes 13 hours of supplemental extras like informative audio commentaries by cast members and crew on selected episodes, ""Jason + Larry = George"" featurette, deleted scenes, fun outtakes, series promos and exclusive stand-up comedy footage. Overall, ""Seinfeld: The Complete Fifth Season"" earns an ""A"".",1132531200,15,1748,5.522388059701493
2411860,5,B000BBOUEU,"These shows will be kept in my top shelf for ages and Im sure they're something my kids will watch later in life n love.

Cmon, we cant really choose a favorite show or season even. tey're all so very very good! The briss.. that guy is so akward.

See, one of the great things about Seinfeld is that the main characters are great but the side-kicks, eventual characters or even once-in-a-lifetime apearences are so impressive. The oposite is fantastic, George tops himself again in the Marine Biologist episode. ""its not a lie...if you believe it"" the motto for his life is really paying off on thi season. GREAT, all in all its the middle part of a 9 year MASTERPIECE!",1128902400,6,669,4.520661157024794

2411862,5,B000BBOUEU,"Just when I think I've settled the title of ""favorite"" on a few shows, this set comes out.

The Bris, with the Mohel, is one of the funniest shows I've ever seen on TV in any decade. You have the Mohel, who is brilliant, and the Pig Man Kramer rescues from the hospital...

The Mannequin episdoe with the Elaine weirdo fan she meets on the subaway and sees herself replicated in a store mannequin with a snotty salesgirl with some unknown Middle European accent, great stuff.

The Accountant; who can't stop sniffing so Kramer thinks he is a drug smuggler (allergic to his sweater) and takes a picture of him sitting on the toilet, another classic.

And of course, the Hamptons, which has the gang weekending at the home of friends in (where else?) the Hamptons and we are treated to an ""ugly baby"" the sight of which causes everyone but the doctor and the parents to grimace at the sight of him, and Kramer bringing several lobsters to the dinner table, not knowing they were in commercial traps...and then, of course, the ""shrinkage"" incident.

The Puffy Shirt (I don't WANNA be a pirate!) is yet another favorite; the Low Talker g/f of Kramer's gets Jerry (although he couldn't hear her) to agree to wear her ""puffy shirt"" design on the Bryant Gumbel show...

And the Glasses, George thinks his glasses are stolen at the gym and shows up at Jerry's wearing his underwater goggles which prompts Jerry to address him as Aqua Boy. Kramer takes George to an optometrist who owes him a favor and George picks out lady's frames...Jerry sees him in the new glasses and says ""I don't know what to tell you, Elton.""

Yet another great set to brighten up the worst day...",1127347200,7,1664,4.582491582491582
2411863,5,B000BBOUEU,"Thanks to a very strong fourth season, Seinfeld's fifth season saw the show go from a cult phenomenon into an entertainment juggernaut. This year represented the direct middle of the show's 9-year run, and by and large it was excellent. Not quite the equivalent of season 4, but still more than passable.

There's no doubt that the fifth season of Seinfeld ended strong. Three classic episodes close it out: The Fire (with George's hysterical reaction to a fire), The Hamptons (with an ugly baby), and The Opposite, which I think is the show's all-time best episode. What a way to end the season: George in the throes of success, with a new job, apartment and love interest, and Elaine losing all that. The scene where George screams at the thugs in the movie theater is hilarious, although people who have only seen later episodes might wonder what the big deal about George screaming at other people is. At this point, Larry David's onscreen surrogate was known for his inability to let out his anger, which made him more angry. There are great moments all throughout this season: The Puffy Shirt deals with the ramifications of Jerry's decision to wear the titular garment on the Today show, The Marine Biologist has George pretending to be of that profession, and there's the operatic The Barber, which focuses on the much-overlooked relationship between a man and his barber. Any trace of previous insecurity or hesitancy was eliminated: the show went boldly on, carving out an immortal place in pop culture.

Although this was the first season that Seinfeld enjoyed massive popularity, we can now look back historically to see that it was not the show's best (nor its worst). My particular gripe is the episode The Mango. Don't get me wrong, I like the taboo-busting, but I found myself cringing far too often during this episode at things that were supposed to be funny. Your mileage might vary, though. In short, it's worth buying.",1127174400,20,1939,4.854984894259819

2412164,4,B000BBOUEU,"For hard-core Seinfeld fans, Season 5 is when the show starts to go downhill.  As Jerry Seinfeld admits (in the commentaries), it was at this point that the writers felt they were running out of ideas, at least based on the original Seinfeld premise: that the show would be about nothing, about the mundane, ordinary day to day life of people.  As a result, the writers decided to try a new approach, switching to a far more plot-oriented style, and one that is more outlandish and more based on broad, physical, slapstick humor, especially centered around Kramer's antics. This new direction is begun in Season 5, though increases over the next few seasons. (Though arguably, the low point of the Seinfeld series is their decision to bring in a midget for laughs (sorry -- ""little person"")).  To take one episode as an example, George pretends to be a marine biologist to impress a woman.  But then when they're on the beach, there happens to be a beached whale, and George proceeds to walk out to save the whale -- and does so, retrieving from its blowhole a golf ball that had been hit by Kramer.  This is not the Seinfeld of the first 4 seasons (so much for a comedy about nothing!).

  It must be admitted that this new slapstick style did bring in many more viewers, and made Seinfeld into a mega-hit.  Still, Seinfeld purists are not impressed.

  Despite this, Season 5 still has some classic episodes, including The Hamptons (shrinkage!) and my favorite, The Pie.  And even the weaker episodes have brilliant moments in the unique Seinfeld style.  So overall this season is worth owning, even if it is the beginning of the downturn for Seinfeld.",1305763200,,1654,4.697916666666667

2412168,5,B000BBOUEU,"There's nothing dated about this classic sitcom, which defined the late '80s and early '90s TV comedy as Jerry and his buddies traipsed through New York life and its various little adventures.

As the creators promised, Seinfeld is indeed largely ""a show about nothing."" That said, it's often the little daily annoyances, ups and downs that make for the most entertaining stories in our own lives, and it certainly held true for Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer.

Particularly memorable episodes include the classic hilarious ""The Puffy Shirt,"" where a misunderstanding between Jerry and Kramer's new girlfriend causes Jerry to get stuck wearing a ""pirate shirt"" on national television; ""The Stall,"" where Elaine, stuck in a public restroom stall without toilet paper, begs her neighbor to ""spare a square"" and is refused, only to learn that it's Jerry's new girlfriend; ""The Marine Biologist,"" where George pretends he's a marine biologist in order to impress a woman, only to find himself in a situation where his career skills are required; and ""The Opposite,"" where George starts doing the opposite of what he'd normally do in any given situation, and finds his life turning around.

2412172,4,B000BBOUEU,"Seinfeld is, in my humble view, the greatest television series ever. In fact, I have almost religiously ignored TV for the last decade or so, believing it a major drain on society, culture, and thought. Seinfeld and The Simpsons are the only things I have let myself watch. Seinfeld is not only hilarious, original, and ever-inventive but did nothing less than revolutionize the very idea of what a TV sitcom could be. In stark contrast to shows before and since, it proved that a show could succeed and be funny without a conventionally likable character or clich&eacute;d, sentimental endings. ""Anything goes"" was truly the rule; famously called ""a show about nothing,"" it was really about everything. Nothing was safe; nearly every subject was tackled, from mundane to profound. Seinfeld encompassed every type of comedy, from allegory to slapstick. It was often satirical, poking fun at many cultural aspects and also influencing popular culture greatly, introducing many famous catchphrases and some of the most well-known recent fictional characters. Seinfeld broke just about every conventional TV sitcom rule and was the better for it. I can say without hyperbole that there is more comic brilliance in one Seinfeld season than in nearly all sitcoms' entire runs - and more in one episode than in many. TV has not been the same since - but even a cursory look at current shows depressingly proves that it is more admired than imitated.

But everyone knows this, and anyone reading this surely knows it well. The twenty-two episodes contained here are of course worth five stars. The real question is, Should you buy this DVD set? Seinfeld is after all in heavy syndication; anyone wanting to watch can find it easily and often. It depends on how much one likes the show and how one wants to watch. It is of course convenient to have permanent copies in order to watch whenever one wants. This aside, there are many advantages. For starters, the footage has been remastered, resulting in higher quality - but many do not care about such things. More important is that these are the original episodes, which occasionally differ from syndicated ones in several ways, most importantly in being a minute or two longer.

However, the real treat, especially for fans, are the many extras not available anywhere else. There are not as many as could have been wished, and there are problems with some, but overall they are substantial. They include ""Notes about Nothing,"" subtitle commentary for each episode revealing interesting facts about cast, crew, location, etc. They are always informative and often entertaining with revealing trivia and surprising insights. We learn much about the inspiration behind episodes and, surprisingly, much straight information about real things mentioned in passing; these last are almost like historical footnotes. This is certainly not what one expects from a comedy and is a pleasant surprise. The most revealing information, though, relates to deleted scenes. All this is good, but the notes can be distracting. They go by too quickly, and it is sometimes a struggle to keep up; one can occasionally even lose track of the show. The overly annoyed can simply not turn them on, but those who appreciate them may be disappointed by the less than ideal presentation.

The majority of episodes also have optional audio commentary, usually from writers, sometimes from the cast. It is of a piece with that of most DVDs and will be appreciated by fans. More notable are the deleted scenes - from one to three or so - that come with most episodes. A few were cut because of writing or acting deficiencies, but most were simply dropped for time or because something better came up. This means they are often as funny as what was used or nearly so; a few are even superior. Particularly interesting are alternate endings available for several episodes that sometimes change the whole plot; none are better than what was used, but several are close. The deleted scenes are probably the biggest lure for Seinfeld fans, and it is a shame there are not more. Some are certainly being held back, because deleted scenes referred to in the notes and elsewhere often do not appear. It is hard to imagine why this is but easy to regret.

Most episodes also have an ""Inside Look"" - a two to five or so minute mini-documentary about the inspiration behind the episode and the making of it done via cast and crew interviews. They are often very illuminating and sometimes even quite entertaining - a definite plus for anyone wanting additional material. However, the brevity disappoints; they really whet our appetites more than anything and end too soon. It is also strange that not every episode has one, as this could have easily been done.

There is also a longer documentary - about half an hour - about how the character of George is partly based on co-creator Larry David. It is also done with cast and crew interviews, and much interesting background material is given. Deleted scenes aside, this is the funniest of the bonus material and perhaps by itself worth the price for hard-cores.

Finally, there is additional Jerry Seinfeld stand-up footage, much of which is as good as what was used and thus quite funny. A hilarious and fairly long blooper reel rounds out the extras, as does a series of NBC promomotional spots featuring uncharacteristically pedestrian humor of interest only to completists.

Assuming all this interests you, the question becomes, Which DVD set should you buy? The answer is of course obvious if you have the money - buy them all. Even those able to purchase only one at a time should probably start from the start, despite universal agreement that early episodes are not the best, just for the benefits of chronology. It is interesting to watch all the story arcs in order and see how characters are developed. Needless to say, those unable to do this or who do not want to should buy their favorite season.

Those unsure where to start could easily do worse than season five. Chronology is of course ruined, but episodes are deliberately designed to be funny even to those seeing the show for the first time. Some jokes and other things will inevitably be missed, but nearly all of it will still be funny. Season five is notable for several reasons - some obvious to casuals, others important only to hard-cores. It has some of the best and most famous episodes, including some of my personal favorites such as ""The Puffy Shirt,"" ""The Cigar Store Indian,"" and ""The Hamptons."" Perhaps the most important is that this is when the show began moving away from its famous focus on the mundane. This surprising thrust came primarily from new writers Tom Gammill and Max Pross, who mixed the surreal and bizarre in with the trademark focus on ""nothing"" and inspired older writers to do the same. Later seasons expanded this, but watching it unfold in embryo in fascinating. The season is also notable for introducing some of the best-known and funniest recurring characters, including Jerry Stiller's immortal role as George's father and Danny Woodburn as Kramer's friend Mickey from among the ""little people."" Guest stars are also abundant, including notables like Courtney Cox as Jerry's girlfriend/""wife"" and Judge Reinhold as Elaine's boyfriend. Season five is not least notable for introducing several of the show's famous catchphrases, including ""low talker,"" ""close talker,"" ""shrinkage,"" and ""the opposite."" Finally, several other things are of note to hard-cores. For example, season five was a season of farewells. Tom Cherones, director since season one, made his bow, as did Larry Charles, one of the primary writers, who went out in flames - in a good way - with ""The Fire.""

In summary, anyone wanting a season's worth of comedy could hardly do better. As for the many who have already seen it all, the extras are enticing; there could be more, but there is plenty to attract fans, and the price is very good for a four DVD set. This comes highly recommended for all.",1263081600,2,8033,4.918141592920354

I have to admit that the character of Kramer sometimes became a bit tiresome as the creative team milked him for every possible quirk, but Michael Richards is such a talented physical comedian that he is almost always entertaining to watch.

2412204,5,B000BBOUEU,"I love every single episode of Seinfeld and seem to associate almost everything in my daily life with something from either Seinfeld or the Simpsons. That being said, this season of Seinfeld contains one gem after another. A rundown on my favorite episodes: Episode 5, The Bris: The most hilarious part of this is the moyle that doesn't even make it as a kosher butcher is now tasked with circumcision of infants. He is unsteady, has a fear of loud sounds, is generally anal retentive, and doesn't like children...and yet he is the person they let do the deed! So funny I can't even describe it. In the extras, Jason Alexander says that he didn't think it was good for the moyle to hate children, but I differ with him and think it was a very funny, subtle touch to the episode. Episode 7, The Non-Fat Yogurt: I appreciate how Guiliani actually came on the show...I'd say more, but don't want to give it away. Episode 8, The Barber: Sheer comic genius. Take one part Seinfeld, one part Newman, and two parts Rossini and mix them all up, et voila! Although it's never mentioned, I have a feeling the old Looney Tunes with Bugs in the comedic roles had an influence on this. Episode 13, The Marine Biologist: The extras indicate that many consider this a classic episode and you can easily tell why: just funny from start to finish! My favorite part is when George is giving his ""Melvillesque"" telling of how he saved the whale (""Easy big fella!""). Episode 22, The Opposite. The title says it all.

2412205,2,B000BBOUEU,"Let me be the innocent child in ""The Emperor's New Clothes,"" and proclaim:

Jerry Seinfeld is not funny!

Oh, I know what you're thinking: Here's  a guy who thinks Seinfeld was unfunny, but his cast was hilarious.

No. At best the rest of the cast was mildly amusing (although Jason Alexander is a talented actor, he is not necessarily hilarious, hence the two stars).

Because, when it comes down to brass tacks, ""Seinfeld"" *was* a ""show about nothing"" -- in every sense of the word:

The contrived semi-plots, with choppy one-liner segments.

The cloying, annoying, ejaculatory bass riffs between shots.

Jerry Seinfeld posing as this hipster: Yeah, right, a hipster with a ridiculous bushy mullet.  At best, Seinfeld was an Upper West Side Jewish version of Jeff Foxworthy.  You want to know why people think Jewish men are smug, metrosexual wimpish know-it-alls?  I submit Jerry Seinfeld as ""Exhibit A.""  If a WASP played a Jew such as Seinfeld, he'd be accused of bigoted racial slurs against the Jewish people. Grating, like fingernails down a chalkboard.

Oh, and speaking of freakish hair-do's:  Is there anyone alive who thinks that Michael Richards as Kramer would even inspire a single chuckle if shorn of that ridiculous Brillo-pad hair?  Within three episodes, he'd have been out of the door, after having been reduced to haranguing black hecklers in the studio audience:  He's a [n-word]! He's a [n-word]!

Pathetic.

Puleeze! She makes Gwyneth Paltrow look like Kate Winslet, she is so flat.

2412226,4,B000BBOUEU,"Seinfeld-Season 5 would be the first season where the sitcom would be among the most popular shows on TV. Filling the void left behind by the end of the very successful sitcom, Cheers, Seinfeld would finish #3 in the Nielsen ratings during Season 5, thus continuing NBC's dominance on Thursday nights. The writing was still creative and continued to push the envelope of what could be shown on network television. This was also the first season to prominently Frank and Estelle Costanza as well as the season where Jerry actually held on to a girlfriend for a whopping 3 episodes. Disc 1 is very good with the best episodes being ""The Mango"", ""The Sniffing Accountant"", which features one of Kramer's most memorable scenes, and ""The Puffy Shirt"", one of several classic episodes from the season. And as with Seasons 3 & 4, Disc 2 is another winner as all of the episodes are very strong, the best being ""The Non Fat Yogurt"", which is featured in two different versions, ""The Barber"", and ""The Cigar Store Indian."" Disc 3 is also very good with the underrated episode, ""The Conversion"", and two classics in ""The Stall"", which gave us Elaine's most famous catchphrase, `I can't spare a square', and the season's best episode, ""The Marine Biologist."" Disc 4 ends the season on a high note with the excellent episodes, ""The Fire"", also known as ""The Pinky Toe"", ""The Raincoats"", which features a memorable appearance from Judge Reinhold as the close talker, and the finale, ""The Opposite"", probably the only episode in the entire series where things actually work out for George in the end. As with the other volumes, the special features are awesome. In addition to bloopers, inside looks, deleted scenes, and the notes about nothing, there is also a great segment on the evolution of the George character. Also worth noting is that for the first time since Season 2, not every show is top notch as noted in the mediocre episodes ""The Dinner Party"" and ""The Bris."" All told, Season 5 continued Seinfeld's winning streak which would ultimately lead to the sitcom becoming the #1 show on television in Season 6. Highly recommended.",1159142400,6,2126,4.843406593406593
2412227,4,B000BBOUEU,"This was my first foray into the world of ""Seinfeld,"" and I have to say I was greatly impressed. Of course my expectations were high as this show is revered as no other sit-com in my lifetime is. It may be too soon to call it the greatest sit-com of all time, but there is a case to be made. Despite that, my heart still lies with ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" the spin off of this show that follows around the nothingness of a producer as opposed to the nothingness of a comedian. ""Seinfeld"" is a more populist show. It goes easier on humanity and because of that the humor doesn't cut as deep.

One thing ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" certainly does not have is the splendid physical humor of Kramer. I got more laughs out of watching him than any other aspect of this show. Whether he was auctioning himself off or trying to save a baby he could squeeze a laugh out of me just with a simple contortion of his body, and that takes a lot of skill. The other characters all play their parts perfectly. Jason Alexander as George, the born loser who is angry at the world and wants the world to know it was the one I identified with the most. He is obviously playing the Larry David character. The bald head, hatred of humanity, and complete lack of luck . . . all the pieces are there. Much of the joy of the show comes from figuring out how fate will boomerang around on there characters and smack them on their behinds. Everything you see on screen is possible exposition for the cruel twists the writers have in mind. And like great comedy often does, it will have you cringing for the predicaments that Jerry and Co. find themselves in. The guest characters are nothing more than a parade of New York neurotics. This one talks to close, that one has an unhealthy dependence on TV Guide, etc. You'll laugh because it's true and not true at the same time.

This show, like most sit-coms, has a memory problem. The only sign of continuity is in the last episodes when the greatest hits of this season make cameo appearances. All of the beautifully crafted episodes have at least a few laughs. The Puffy Shirt will probably be the legacy of this season and rightfully so. Still, I watch that scene and wonder how they pulled it off. I just know that if ""Two and a Half Men"" were to try that stunt it would be botched terribly. The opening comedy bits by Jerry Seinfeld are also entertaining. I felt especially vindicated when he called out people for their hypocrisy on water. The fact that people love water unless it's falling from the sky is a point I have been making for years. And I have also heard people make the point that you have to be a New Yorker to enjoy this show, but it's just not true. Sure, we're a little weird, but none of the humor is New York based. It could take place anywhere with fruit vendors and thrift shops. The eccentrics may have been a little harder to come by had it taken place in Minnesota, but that is beside the point. I may lament the fact that this show went for the biggest audience ever but the fact remains: This show was a huge hit with fans and critics alike, and that is the rarest breed of TV show.",1157500800,,3132,4.315789473684211
2412228,5,B000BBOUEU,"The fifth season of Seinfeld has arrived, and as someone who saw Seinfeld for the first time last year, I'm more convinced than ever that the genius of this series is still unparalleled.

Season 5 was a significant year for Seinfeld, for many reasons. First of all, of course, it was the first season that would have to withstand the critical eyes of a huge audience all over several countries. The big question was: would Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld be able to carry over the pure Seinfeld humor of the almost abnormally perfect season 4, and present Seinfeld as the ingenius idea it originally was, the show about nothing?

It would be very easy to say ""yes, they were"" because obviously the show became a huge phenomenon, and needless to say, season 5 is indeed brilliant again.

But I still think this season was not the best year for Seinfeld to ""catch on"", and maybe the remaining seasons would have taken a different route, had the show become successful one year earlier.

Now don't get me all wrong; there's nothing wrong with the episodes per se, they just don't carry on the spirit of Seinfeld as properly as they could have.

It's not a decline in quality, it's a change in style.

For one, the show has now a larger scale with more sets and bigger settings. Again, this is not bad, but Seinfeld is always at its best on small- scale things.

Then, there were some changes made in the writing. Tom Gamill and Max Pross have now entered the show, along with Carol Leifer. I believe the turning point of Seinfeld came with ""The Glasses"", written by Gamill and Pross, when George, due the loss of his glasses, mistakes Jerry's cousin Jeffrey with a horse. That's the point where Seinfeld became a little like a parody of itself. Gamill and Pross often talk on the DVD about taking funny bits out of their own lives and turning those into episodes. This is all very good and fitting, but what they failed to realise is that Seinfeld goes beyond ""my high school friend used to eat his Snickers bar with a knife and fork"". Starting with season 5, Seinfeld relied more on actual jokes and over-the-top plot twists. Remember, this is all perfectly fine, as it is really funny, but it ain't Seinfeld.

The first 4 seasons didn't need actual jokes, the characters were so strong and dynamic and complemented each other so well that they weren't needed. Seinfeld was always at its best in lengthy face-to-face scenes or coversations.

Why? Because the essential Seinfeld humor is something you can neither construct nor describe; it's a humor that only exists because of social dynamics; and because of a humor and cynicism that society created itself.

Like Larry David said, it's based on the ""absurd profanity of life"", and the setups in season 5 onwards are anything but profane.

Season 5 does have some great face-to-face scenes, but unfortunately, because the writers came up with more and more complex stories, scenes often change too quickly.

Now, not everything's different. There are a couple of things that are superior to season 4. For instance, the characters of the show are now so well established that they could do a little thing or a small gesture, and you know what's going on. Jerry Seinfeld himself says that in a commentary track. The writers could give a line to a character and just know how it would play out. That's great, to know your characters, knowing how a weapon can cause the most damage.

Now, this may all sound negative, but it isn't meant to be. Jerry Seinfeld said they had to change the show somehow because they knew they couldn't sustain the level of the first four seasons, and I think he's right. I just regret that it had to happen in this important year.

Season 5 has enough of seasons 1-4 to make the new audience ""get"" Seinfeld, but it has also a couple of things that water the original idea down.

The extras are excellent, as usual, with 20 minutes of bloopers, roughly 8 minutes of exclusive stand-up material, a great featurette, deleted scenes, and audio commentaries and inside looks galore.",1156464000,2,4052,4.671348314606742

2412230,5,B000BBOUEU,"If you're a T.V. Seinfeld fan you will absolutely love the DVD's.  The scenes that are cut to insert commercials by syndicators are restored on the high quality DVD versions.  I grew up in the United States and had always liked the series from television.  I was married while living/working/studying in China in 2002 and bought the DVD's for my wife on our coming to the United States in 2005.  She had never seen Seinfeld before and had never been exposed to this style of humor or the slice of American life that the series presents.  We have watched the DVD's over and over again and they never fail to make us laugh and lift our spirits when we've had a bad day.  We utilize the closed captioning option and it has been a great help for my wife in acquiring an understanding of casual English usage including slang, and idiom.  On a more serious note, owning so many seasons and watching the episodes regularly makes you realize the sad truth that much of American life really is focused on the themes of myopic self-interest presented and ridiculed in this series. I sometimes worry that individuals may actually see the series as a validation of their lack of ethics, morals, and connection with the Creator instead of as a revelation and jabbing at today's inappropriate social dynamics; just as the Archie Bunker/All In the Family series did in the 1970's.
The DVD sets include great special features from ""How It Began"" to ""Making a Seinfeld Episode"", deleted scenes, behind the scenes commentary from cast and creators, never-before-seen standup footage of Jerry, original NBC promotional ads and trailers, outtakes and bloopers, and much, much more.  It's obvious that a lot of thought and work went into producing the DVD sets and I can't wait until the remaining seasons come out for sale at Amazon.  After all; ""Who wouldn't love Jerry?""
Episodes included in this set are:
Season 5 - The Mango, The Glasses, The Puffy Shirt, The Sniffing Accountant, The Bris, The Lip Reader, The Non-Fat Yogurt, The Barber, The Masseuse, The Cigar Store Indian, The Conversation, The Stall, The Marine Biologist, The Dinner Party, The Pie, The Stand-In, The Wife, The Fire, The Raincoats, The Hamptons, The Opposite.",1150502400,7,2215,4.838624338624339

My point in writing this is to warn people who want access to their purchased material to seriously consider whether to make an investment in this DVD series.

I just popped in the DVD and was stopped several times by un-fast-forwardable warnings.

1. First there's an FBI anti-piracy warning.

2. Then there's an Interpol warning in English.

3. Then there's an Interpol warning in FRENCH.

4. Then there's a black screen with white lettering telling us something useless about the commentaries and opinions not necessarily being those of Sony Pictures in ENGLISH.

5. Then there's a black screen with white lettering telling us something useless about the commentaries and opinions not necessarily being those of Sony Pictures in FRENCH.

Finally, after enduring their threats to you, the consumer, who have just paid a great deal of money to purchase YOUR DVDs, it begins.

So if you are looking to pop a DVD in and check out that funny scene that you love in The Cigar Store Indian, you'll have to endure threats and warnings that threaten you with imprisonment. You can't do anything but wait. You can't jump ahead, you can't fast foward.

Other DVDs are MUCH better at showing the warnings.

In HEAT, with Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino, the movie lets you jump right to any scene you want without all the threats. Heat is one of the best DVDs out there in the way they handle forced copyright warnings.

2412251,5,B000BBOUEU,"Although season four is probably my overall favorite season, season five contains my all-time favorite episode of ""Seinfeld,"" ""The Puffy Shirt."" The whole season is well crafted, interrelated (plotlines from previous episodes recur frequently), and tightly written.

By this point in the series all the characters are fairly well developed (except perhaps for Kramer) and the cast obviously fits together perfectly as the most complimentary foursome in television history. Several of the episodes are all-time classics. ""The Puffy Shirt"" and the concept of the ""low talker"" is my personal favorite, and contains all the hallmarks of a great episode: I am especially amazed at how the writers tied the hand model and low talking plots together in the end. My other favorite in the set, ""The Marine Biologist,"" is another pure delight. Again, part of the magic of that episode is the re-convergence of the plots at the end of the show when George reveals the golf ball to the others.

There isn't a weak episode in the season, and the DVD set contains numerous extras of note. I am particularly fond of the bloopers (""Not That There's Anything Wrong With That"") and the ""Inside Looks"" sections where principals recall interesting information about the particular episodes.

This is what a box set should be: it is entertaining, complete, and has loads of quality extras for the true fan. This is comedy genius, and I can't recommend it highly enough.",1139184000,3,1448,5.050209205020921
2412252,5,B000BBOUEU,"Essentially this is a repeat of my Season 4 review but with different favorite episodes.  I will add though that this is the best seasons so far, the writers, producers, actors and directors are all in a groove. They know the characters, the story arcs, and the desired comedy experience all combining to a synergistic Seinfeld experience.

Seinfeld is network television comedy at its best. 10 years later as I watch these episodes, despite seeing them countless times on syndication, I laugh out loud. Each show is original, tightly written, well acted and of course freaking hysterical. Even better they have memory...or in more technical terms a long story arc which intermittently continues themes across episodes and seasons. This adds to the richness of the humor and the fullness of characters, it allows the characters to develop and even though they are frequently reprehensible, we also see ourselves in there behaviors and they become very likable. Most television comedy consists of static episodes with contrived jokes and pratfalls where the only laughing you hear is the laugh track. Not Seinfeld!

Some of my favorite episodes from Season 5 include:

The Hampton's

The Puffy Shirt

The Sniffing Accountant

The Marine Biologist

The Stand In

The bonus material is generally excellent:

- The deleted scenes are interesting, you get to see more of the show, but they generally are unfunny jokes or extraneous/redundant material, (its obvious to see why they were deleted). It helped me appreciate the creative process of comedy

- I have not watched all the commentaries but the few I did watch were not very stimulating. The commentators are too busy watching the show, such that there are long pauses between comments and when they do comment, it something like...that was funny, how did we get away with that...over and over again. Stuff you want to know they don't tell you, for example, what was it like working with Bette Midler.

- The Inside Look featurettes are very insightful as we see and hear about the creative process and the inspiration for the stories. An added bonus is the actors' anecdotes, especially Michael Richards. During the show I thought he was the weakest actor, present to just add some `low brow'. Now I how good an actor he really is; In the featurette we se a so soft spoken, relaxed, and well mannered Michael Richards (almost bordering on shy and reticent) vs. his hyperkinetic spastic Cosmo Kramer. The contrast is illuminating; he really created and made the most of that character. The other actors you can easily see inhabiting the characters but Richards was the biggest surprise.

- The menus are creative and unique per each disk, mimicking a well known local from the show. While they are interesting to watch, occasionally its hard to find the specific menu you want.

- The packaging is good as well but I disliked the packet photos which are cheesy artificial actor promo shots.

- The bloopers are hysterical, you'll be begging for more.

- Jerry Seinfeld's stand up is top notch as well.

In review this is the best network comedy out there; if you want to laugh, buy it.",1138924800,2,3137,4.8998109640831755

2412268,5,B000BBOUEU,"Might be the best season released.

Many classic episodes (Marine Biologist, Puffy Shirt, Pigman), and some pretty good extras this time around.

Good stuff from the actors/writers with their takeson classic episodes and a great segment that features Jason Alexander vs. Costanza vs. Larry David.

Seinfeld's speech at the Smithsonian, along with some funny insights about Jerry Stiller helping to give Frank Costanza a little flair.",1138579200,2,433,5.53030303030303

2412270,5,B000BBOUEU,"Yes, Seinfeld is always funny.  Here's what he said about his comedic inspiration:  ""[Lois Nettleton] was married to Jean Shepherd.  He's the guy who invented talk radio and really formed my entire comedic sensibility.  Yes.  I learned how to do comedy from Jean Shepherd."" He said this in his commentary for ""The Gymnast"" episode on the sitcom's DVD set, sixth season.  Who is Jean Shepherd?  See the book EXCELSIOR, YOU FATHEAD!

2412272,5,B000BBOUEU,"Once again Seinfeld is represented in timeless form via the Season 5 DVD release. I loved watching Seinfeld when it was on TV but I love it even more the second time round on DVD.With classic episodes such as The Bris and The Puffy Shirt, Seinfeld really starts to go from the show about ""Nothing"" to the show about everything. In season 5 we get even more intimate with the characters as they become part of our own everyday TV viewing activity. This is a must in any DVD collection!",1137283200,,484,4.388888888888889
2412273,4,B000BBOUEU,"I received this as a gift which was good, as I won't personally buy any Sony products because they just plain suck.  I wouldn't even think about putting this DVD into my computer.

As for the DVD's themselves, they are awesome.  All of the extras, deleted scenes, bloopers, notes about nothing, etc.  Jerry had a lot to do with these DVD's and he did a great job.  I love every episode of this season except for The Bris.  My favorite would have to be The Sniffing Accountant.",1136592000,,476,4.413793103448276
2412274,5,B000BBOUEU,"I don't know what to say about Seinfeld that hasn't been said a thousand times before by people far more analytical and intelligent than I am.

All I know is what I like. And I like -- no, make that LOVE -- Season 5 of Seinfeld.

The Mango

The Puffy Shirt

The Glasses

The Sniffing Accountant

The Bris

The Lip Reader

The Non-Fat Yogurt

The Barber

The Masseuse

The Cigar Store Indian

The Conversion

The Stall

The Dinner Party

The Marine Biologist

The Pie

The Stand-In

The Wife

The Raincoats (1)

The Raincoats (2)

The Fire

The Hamptons

The Opposite

All right. You got me. That lists includes every episode in Season 5. They're all favorites. (Okay, special favorites include ""The Marine Biologist,"" ""The Conversion,"" ""The Hamptons"" and ""The Sniffing Accountant."")

The DVD set includes hilarious outtakes and informative, entertaining behind-the-scenes featurettes.

If you love comedy, and I mean some of the wittiest comedy ever to hit the little screen, Seinfeld Season 5 is just what the doctor ordered.",1135641600,2,1222,5.005025125628141
