8203535,5,B000S0GYPC,"Loved this video effort. Even though the heroic revolution is well documented, as history is proving it, the current Nicaraguan administration is destroying the efforts of a revolution by establishing themselves as the oppressive, intolerant and egocentric power they once fought against. History will teach us nothing I guess.",1372550400,,327,5.6938775510204085
8203536,5,B000S0GYPC,This was very informative on the revolution in Nicaragua.  We learned a lot from this DVD and recommend it to anyone that is interested in Latin American history.,1366934400,,162,4.785714285714286
8203537,5,B000S0GYPC,Sad how dictatorship held these people in fear for so many years! Glad they got rid of Somoza though. Viva la Revolucion,1363824000,,120,4.5
8203538,4,B000S0GYPC,I am a fan of photographer Susan Meiselas' work and was very excited to find out that this classic film was being re-released on DVD. I was blown-away - Susan returns 10 years later to the places in Nicaragua where she shot her iconic and now-famous photos of the Sandinista Revolution. Not only is this film moving but very powerful.,1191283200,4,334,4.583333333333333
