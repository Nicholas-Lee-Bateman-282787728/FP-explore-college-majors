6583884,5,B00MK1RCBC,"As good as it is, even this program has some drawbacks.  I've never even heard of half of these people, but I'm well past prime demographic age. Fortunately, that doesn't detract much from the overall quality of the program.
Personally, I preferred Season One where most of the episodes only had two guests. That allowed much more time to go into more depth. Eighteen minutes per person is simply not enough time to present the data, much less discuss it.
My only real criticism of the show is that it makes genealogy look too easy. (Who Do You Think You Are is even worse in that regard.) They don't tell you that each of those books took a full staff of professional researchers months of work and thousands of dollars to assemble.
Still, I wouldn't miss it.",1414281600,2,760,4.547445255474453

6583890,5,B00MK1RCBC,"Celebrated guests learn about their family trees, and we the viewers learn much about history.  The guests for season two are,
Stephen King (really interesting)
Gloria Reuben
Courtney Vance
Derek Jeter (very interesting history)
Billie Jean King
Rebecca Lobo
Andersen Cooper
Ken Burns (related to some big names in history)
Anna Deveare Smith
Ben Affleck
Khandi Alexander
Ben Jealous (the former head of the NAACP is mostly Caucasian, LOL  I really like him, probably the best guest.)
Tom Colicchio
Ming Tsai (very interesting history of people caught in Mao's Chinese revolution)
Aaron Sanchez
Nas
Angela Bassett
Valerie Jarrett
Alan Dershowitz (very interesting story about Jews trying to escape Hitler)
Carole King
Tony Kushner
Deepak Chopra
Sally Field ( Related to very famous figure from American history, and she'd never heard of him. I could hardly believe she'd never heard of him.)
Sting
Tina Fey
David Seddaris
George Stephanopoulos (very interesting)
Jessica Alba
Gov. Deval Patrick
If you are like me, you won't have heard of some of these guests, but I found that didn't matter, the histories were still interesting.  Along with learning about these people's family you learn a lot of fascinating history, both American and European.  The program delves into why guest's ancestors immigrated--wars, famines, oppression, poverty. So, for instance, I found myself fascinated by how intellectuals were horribly treated in Mao's communist revolution, how some African Americans discover their ancestors were not slaves, how some guests found their ancestors on the wrong side of the law.  Some of the programs followed a theme.  There was the Jewish history show, the Greeks show, the chefs show, the athletes show, etc.  The producers of the show find some amazing historical photos and video.  The pictures of little slave children and Jews in concentration camps are haunting--not to mention film of Chinese people being executed during their revolution.",1477353600,,1967,5.363636363636363

6583918,4,B00MK1RCBC,Most are very interesting and thoughtful.  My only concern is the emphasis on so much negative history to the point that it detracts from the positive.  It's as if they want persons whose 2 or 3 great grandparent was a slave holder to be ashamed of him or herself for something that they had nothing to do with.,1463011200,,311,4.344827586206897

6584098,4,B00MK1RCBC,"I really enjoy watching this show.  I like the way they take three celebs and research their backgrounds and then find a common point where they tie it together like ancestors in the civil war, etc.  It makes you want to sit down and research your own family tree. I have done some research for myself but unfortunately I haven't uncovered anything quite so interesting.",1455580800,,370,4.676923076923077
6584099,5,B00MK1RCBC,"Love this series, please add the other season to Prime",1455580800,,54,4.5
6584100,2,B00MK1RCBC,It's not as good Who do you think you are?  The host is obsessed with slavery and discrimination.  It makes the show too political.  They should just focus on telling a story instead of condemning people who are long dead and assigning blame for everything.,1455580800,,257,4.666666666666667
6584101,5,B00MK1RCBC,I love this series. I wish all the seasons were available on Amazon Prime.,1455580800,,74,4.357142857142857

6584119,5,B00MK1RCBC,"The entire season is worth watching.  For those who think it is just about ""genealogy"", that is just the vehicle for learning about history, American history and its roots elsewhere, in an interesting and engaging manner.  It really hooks you and pretty soon you need to see Season 1 and then you need to watch the current season and then you watch it again.",1455408000,,358,4.578125

6584125,5,B00MK1RCBC,By far one of my favorite shows! This has been extremely helpful in doing some of my family research. Especially in looking for black ties during times of slavery.,1454976000,,163,4.655172413793103

6584148,5,B00MK1RCBC,"This show is absolutely amazing! The things you learn about the celebrities' ancestors will tell you about yourself and your history as well. The surprises are astounding! My grandfather did our genaology and as these famous people are profiled, I'm learning that I'm related to some of these celebrities going back hundreds of years. We're all cousins 20 times removed in this country. So amazing! Not only is it spellbinding, it's very moving to watch these people we've seen in the movies, on TV, in government, sports, music, etc etc etc learn about their families tragedies and triumphs. If they had 10 stars to click on, I would give this 10 stars!",1454544000,,654,4.848214285714286

6584154,5,B00MK1RCBC,"This series is amazing as it covers the well known individuals, but also broader connections and
genealogical methods. By tracing the lineage of 2 or 3 guests it shows links and similarities between disparate
people and backgrounds. I think it promoted deeper empathy for each other as a people by sharing the struggles
and triumphs of each family tree.",1454457600,,353,5.0

6584178,5,B00MK1RCBC,"Very interesting entertainment. The use of artist renderings, old photographs and video reenactments add to depict the passion within each ancestor, navigating here as new immigrants is compelling. Learning about the bravery and struggle toward building a life in the US, humbles today's generation to appreciate how they came to be, and common genealogical traits. Tracing ancestors reveals surprises which can lead to royalty or ancient leaders.",1454198400,,447,5.686567164179104

6584181,5,B00MK1RCBC,"I am always a huge fan of genealogy research so it is no surprise I give it five stars.  But what I like in particular about this show is how they showcase 3 guests that all have a connection, either they are professional comics, or they all have Irish ancestry, or they are African American with slaves in the family tree.  They try to bring the ancestors alive with stories about the time period (famine, fire, Holocaust etc) as they share the information.  Very informative.  I love how they use DNA to confirm or debunk assumed family stories.",1454198400,,547,4.551020408163265
6584182,4,B00MK1RCBC,Well done PBS series,1454198400,,20,4.25
6584183,5,B00MK1RCBC,I always enjoy this show and it's amazing how often they find articles in the newspapers about people's ancestors. I also think the DNA testing is interesting.,1454198400,,159,4.925925925925926

6584196,5,B00MK1RCBC,"I truly love this show and I feel that every American should watch it. Each of us go through life not realizing how big our small contributions... good or bad, are to the society around us. What amazing history has been discovered, just by researching one persons ancestral story.... Each episode that I have watched so far has made me laugh, has made me cry and has further allowed me to appreciate those who have left their indelible mark on all of us today.",1454112000,,460,4.488095238095238

6584199,5,B00MK1RCBC,I love all the episodes of Finding Your Roots. I have been extensively researching my own family roots and find these shows fascinating. The shows give me ideas about how to research my ancestors when the paper trail seems to have ended.,1453680000,,237,4.666666666666667
6584200,5,B00MK1RCBC,Loved it!,1453680000,,9,4.0
6584201,5,B00MK1RCBC,"Found the program highly entertaining. I would prefer to follow each story from beginning to end, like 60 minutes, rather than fracturing them into bits and pieces as is so common today. Who do you think you are makes the guest do some of their own research so I think the results are more meaningful as opposed to FYR which basically hands guests a finished, albeit a lovely product. Like that both sides of tree are explored as well as dna testing.",1453593600,,450,4.5
6584202,5,B00MK1RCBC,The only complaint is they make it look so easy and research is not.,1453593600,,68,3.9285714285714284
6584203,5,B00MK1RCBC,"This is a very good program and the lengths they go to are,amazing. It holds our interest from start to finish. It must be amazing to find all of these facts about your ancestors!",1453593600,,179,4.294117647058823

6584244,5,B00MK1RCBC,This is one of the best perks to Amazon Prime!!! I love this show and will probably buy it on dvd sometime in the future.

Neither focuses on regular people but I am sure that celebrities and others well-known, for whatever reason, are a bigger draw than  any of us regular Joes and Janes, though most of us have many of the same sorts of stories in our background. For those of us who have searched through endless records in courthouses, libraries, local historical society files, etc. these shows give us hope that there is more information out there somewhere and, if we are persistent, we just might find it.",1429833600,,581,4.631067961165049

6584619,3,B00MK1RCBC,"I've only seen 5 episodes of the 2nd season.  It's an interesting genealogy show, but so far has had a narrow focus of the civil war & slavery on all but one of the episodes.  I prefer to see a variety of historical settings.  Plus I like to hear more about the actual research and how they found the information.  Otherwise, it's well done.  I plan on watching the rest of season 2.

Update:  I did not watch any more of Season 2.",1429056000,,431,4.120481927710843

6584624,3,B00MK1RCBC,"I really liked the idea of this show and found the first show entertaining. After watching the second show a pattern developed. This show is focused on how our Americans ancestors fit into the slavery issue during our countries history.  Personally I was disappointed that the show was focused on that. I found that the scope was just narrow, and I lost interest after the third or fourth show.",1428710400,5,394,4.7101449275362315

8672813,3,B00MK1RCBC,"Mostly very interesting and entertaining except for one racist statement made during episode 7; ""The first thing you have to do when you get to England is get a white man to shine your shoes"" unacceptable. That is not progress just more abuse from a different abuser. This is the only reason for the 3 star rating otherwise it would be 5 stars.",1533081600,,344,4.476190476190476
8672814,5,B00MK1RCBC,"I'm really incredibly appreciative that Henry Louis Gates Jr delivers the show without injection of flashy entertainment in both production and delivery and doesn't shy away from having the guests confront some realities of people histories no matter if they might feel uncomfortable.

In Season 2, Ep 5. Angela Basset was confronted with the fact the last name was taken from her ancestors slave masters and she asked if it was voluntary. I may be projecting, but it seemed she was caught off guard due to the fact that history wasn't so straightforward. I wondered thought why that threw her off more than the fact that her ancestors also adopted the religion of her ancestors' slave masters so much so that there were a lot of preachers in her family.

It's questions like these that pop into my head that make me love this show so much. It provides so many rabbit holes of questions about anthropology, sociology, and history.

I do wish there were more East Asian guests because there's so much of Asian American history not talked about. What about the coolies or the exclusion laws? It would be so interesting to find out through a guest's genealogy.",1532563200,,1157,4.775

8672817,2,B00MK1RCBC,"I tried to like it, Mr Gates is a well spoken and empathetic host, and while there are some parts that are truly interesting, there seems to be a rather heavy handed focus on the Civil War and slavery that gets repetitive.  I understand that that is probably where Mr Gates interest lies, but there are millions of stories in America, and as a genealogist myself, I would like to see a broader focus and a bit more variety, perhaps there are more in season 3 and 4, if I can bring myself to watch them.",1525824000,,502,4.229166666666667

8672821,5,B00MK1RCBC,"I have recently begin to do my genealogy. Because of that this show had some interest to me. Essentially Henry Louis Gates Jr. meets with an actor, an author, a politician....someone famous... and shares their genealogy with them. He shares stories, pictures, dates and information about the past with these people.

What was interesting to me was that this was not just about finding the names of long lost ancestors but in piecing together stories about the past and events that happened in history. For example, they might find out that someone was in this place at this year and then they will share information about that town in that time.

Because of who is hosting this show and because this is a continuation of Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s earlier show ""African American Lives"" a lot of this show focuses on the African and African American ancestry of many of the people on this show. Often the people on this show find out their history included slaves or slave owners and many times both.

One of the things this show brought home to me again is how close the past is to us and that what we think of as happening a long time ago really didn't happen that long ago. IT also brought home to me the importance of stories and family history.

One note: if you have heard about this show in regards to the Ben Affleck controversy then I suggest you go read his press release about it. He is very clear that he felt terrible about hearing his family in the past had owned slaves. He also points out that this show requires a lot of personal information and this leaves the participants very vulnerable. I never thought of it in that way. But it is worthy of thinking about prior to watching this show.",1515456000,,1703,4.501618122977346
8672822,5,B00MK1RCBC,The whole season is great. All of the seasons are. You will always learn something new and be entertained. The Jessica Alba episode was my favorite.  I enjoyed learning about the genetic diversity of peoples with deep roots in Mexico.  I had no idea that many Mexicans/Mexican Americans carry Jewish and African ancestry. This prompted me to watch Dr Gates other program Black in Latin America.,1515283200,,394,4.954545454545454
