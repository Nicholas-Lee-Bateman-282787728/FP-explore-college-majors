7918377,1,B00003DJQS,"Bought this tape for people who do not speak too  much English. It says there are 100 review questions. Guess what, there 50 questions to tell what is the captial for each of the 50 states. For each person, only one captial city of his or her own state needs to be remembered. There is no need to know the other 49 state's capital city. It means 49 questions are waste of time. Therefore, you only get 51 questions out of this tape. It is not good at all!!!",1104278400,,457,4.134831460674158
