The narrating was boring.....I was actually looking forward to this DVD ..
The narrator seems like a nice guy ..... but ... there is just absolutely
no way on earth that a person who enjoys surf DVDs and the art of surfing
would every say that this DVD is best in their collection.  Unless the surf DVD
is the only one in the collection.  I mean to say this is just an insult to
the many solid and wonderful surf DVD out.

10 mins into the documentary/movie I kept telling myself something is off.
The narrating was pretty bad.  One reason I feel this is that the movie really just doesn't have a solid story.  The ""storyline"" is sort of a forced fabrication.  Plus, I just didn't feel that the experienced George ""meshed"" well with the very talented Joe Curren and talented and attractive Holly Beck.
I can watch Jack Johnson's Thicker than Water and September Sessions on repeat - literally all day and each time I watch .... it just brings this warmth and raw emotion every single time I watch those two ---- it is really a beautiful movie by J.Johnson.

Oh well. Is what it is.",1398384000,,1153,4.410377358490566
8213893,1,B000UNYK0S,This movie is terrible....If you are a surfer...DO NOT BUY THIS...This is about Sam Georges' personal conquest to surf with a young african boy and thinks that it will somehow fulfill all his hopes and dreams...If the crappy surfing (except Joe Curren which is limited due to Georges' ego I'm sure) isn't enough to keep you away then just imagine listening to Sam George narrating for about 50 minutes or so...they should play the narrative to this in the mountains of Afghanistan to drive out Bin Laden out!!!,1209081600,2,510,4.806818181818182
8213894,2,B000UNYK0S,"The idea of a film/document about surf culture in coastal African countries is a great one and a necessary one....too bad this particular document was made by ignorant over privileged white people whom couldn't stop saying f***ed up things.......like.......""i tried everything to contact him--from the internet to jungle drums"".....

wtf?

8213895,5,B000UNYK0S,"This is a gem of a movie. I have had the opportunity to view it in a number of different live venues and it never fails to evoke an emotionally visceral response from the audience. It's secret? Uniqueness, Audacity and soul. Take the concept: Renown surf adventurer Sam George travels to the islands off the congo and discovers an indigenous African tribe of surfers. Only to discover that the very waves that they have been surfing for hundreds of years is threatened by a tourist development that harkens back the horrors of the islands cruel slave history? Clearly, This is a must see film for any surfer. It is told from a startlingly personal view from each of its characters (Sam is Accompanied by surf stars Holly Beck and Joe Curren) but the big surprise is the heartwrenching story of the friendship between Sam and a young African Surfer named Shun. Sure, the waves are small and the action not mindblowing tahitian death tubes, but who cares? Any surfer with a heart, any person with a heart for that matter is guaranteed to have a catch in their throat when Shun is re-united with Sam for a surf session with Sam on his modern Longboard and Shun on his board, a rough hewn wooden plank wrested from the jungle and built with blood, sweat and an axe. It is when they surf together and start trading equipment in the water that this movie begins to move it's audience to tears.
This little movie is important to all surfers, important to anyone who wishes to take a journey of the heart, travel to one of the most exotic locales on the planet and witness what it means, regardless of color or creed, what it means to be a human being. A remarkable feat that must be seen to be felt and believed. This movie takes nothing...it only gives.",1193616000,6,1747,4.514195583596215

8213897,5,B000UNYK0S,Best DVD in my collection.  For anyone who ever dreamed of adventure or surfing or both.  You will love this movie experience.,1192838400,,126,4.681818181818182
