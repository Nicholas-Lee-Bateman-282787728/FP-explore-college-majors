4271113,5,B0046UY4N4,"Stunningly beautiful, artistic and inspirational.  Flow through vistas frozen in time.  Be drawn into the evocative landscapes of the American Southwest.  A Walk in Beauty, Desert Star, Living Temples, Rain Dancer, Sea of Mescalero, Sun Chasers, Ancient Voices, Temple Dance - they're all here.  Complemented with an equally lush soundtrack composed by David Lanz.  Walk in beauty, dance in beauty, fly away in beauty.",1289001600,18,418,5.46875
4271114,5,B0046UY4N4,"Sacred Earth is the most moving and relaxing movie I have ever seen!  If you enjoy watching beautiful places with no signs of human interference, this is the movie for you!  Nothing but the wilds of Arizona with soothing music in the background and occasional soothing, insightful, thoughtful words by the hauntingly unusual voice of Linda Hunt.

I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who needs to relax with the aid of soothing music and beautiful, unadulterated natural scenery.",1275004800,20,480,5.050632911392405
4271115,5,B0046UY4N4,"I had seen Sacred Earth before ordering it. If for some reason you didn't think much about this wonderful planet we inhabit, this film will certainly change the way you look at things around you. Watching it lifts my spirit, and makes me so much more conscious of things around me. I can't imagine anyone being dissapointed in Sacred Earth if they order it.",1272326400,19,357,4.59375
4271116,5,B0046UY4N4,Beautiful and unusual scenery,1440201600,,29,6.5
4271117,5,B0046UY4N4,"Great scenery and calming music. Loved the option of spoken words and loop playing
Great overall DVD. Highly recommend this for relaxation and just good calming
entertainment on a night TV programming is crumy",1437696000,,209,5.176470588235294
4271118,3,B0046UY4N4,The content is a selection of beautiful and artfully presented images.  The video quality is way below what I expect from a well mastered Blu-Ray.  It probably will look good on TV's 40 inch or smaller.,1437350400,,202,4.583333333333333
4271119,4,B0046UY4N4,"If you buy this also get ""Echo's of Creation"" as both videos are GREAT!!!! A feature I like is you can play with music & narration or MUSIC ONLY!
Also,you can do ""endless loop"" which is good background viewing at parties leaving you free to enjoy the party! See the ""Red Rock"" wonders so beautiful on Bluray ! Also comes with DVD too! I know that Sacred Earth Productions LLC may have ""new"" packaging that is different that the white box that says:As Seen on Public Television. Also it may not have a slip cover with the new packaging but I can assure you that the Bluray and DVD content is the same,no matter which packaging you may recieve. Jan Nickman videos are much better than most ""nature"" videos on the market today. I hope there are more to come as they are so beautiful and relaxing.",1437004800,,793,4.401360544217687

At the end of a day that might be more grueling than others, I put this on and go ""Ahhhhhhh"" with a smile on my face.",1435276800,,267,4.408163265306122

4271126,5,B0046UY4N4,Beautiful scenery with a relaxing soundtrack.  Can be played in a continuous loop with music only soundtrack.  I actually play this quite often for my dog while I am away from home.  He has separation anxiety & the music seems to help.  My only complaint would be the portions of the show that has a dancer in the shots (probably only about 10-15 minutes).  It just does not seem to fit in with the rest of the show to me.  I would prefer that it be entirely shots of nature only.,1434067200,,480,4.21978021978022
4271127,5,B0046UY4N4,Great show! We enjoyed this DVD/Blu-Ray presentation. It is truly beautiful --- and we recommend it without the music - when you just want to relax. With the music and discussion it's truly beautiful - but for total relaxation - turn the music and commentary off!,1433548800,,263,4.739130434782608

4271134,3,B0046UY4N4,"The photography is good.  Not quite like being there, but good enough for ""on screen"" viewing.  However, the soundtrack and the ""interludes"" are just... well... kinda sappy.  Kinda new-age sparkly and glimmery... which is not the way that landscape really is.  It's rough out there.
However, I understand what they're reaching for.  If you buy this DVD then also buy Harold Budd's CD ""By The Dawn's Early Light"".  Turn down the sound of the DVD and turn up  ""By The Dawn's Early Light"".  It's amazingly more fitting, especially if you've been to these places before, you'll know what I'm talking about.
There's a certain dreamy hauntedness of the desert landscape that David Lanz just didn't quite capture.  However, Harold Budd gets it right with  ""By The Dawn's Early Light"".",1425772800,,777,4.953488372093023

4271152,4,B0046UY4N4,"Absolutely beautiful.  The photography and presention is excellent, except for one thing.  There are two scenes with a dancer--to me it just doesn't fit, these scenes are a jarring note to the wonderful scenery.  For this reason alone I give it 4 stars.
This is a video that I'll watch many times (just fast-forward through the dancer).",1348358400,3,336,4.859649122807017

When I watched this film for the first time I was instantly relaxed, refreshed and renewed.  The tension I felt in my body disappeared immediately and I couldn't believe how good I felt and the feeling continued for the rest of the week.
I have recommended this film to all of my Clients, Friends and Family.  Now I am recommending it to you!

However, for me the narrative was unnecessary and a distraction, so I kept turning the sound off whenever it came on.  I could have also done without the interpretive dance at the end.  The images speak for themselves.  Trying to improve them with narration and dance is like putting legs on a snake.",1440806400,,362,4.609375
