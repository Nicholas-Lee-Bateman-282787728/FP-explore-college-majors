The case was intact and the disc had no scratching.
I was skeptical about purchasing a film used for the first time through Amazon, but this completely proved me wrong and exceeded my expectations!",1456012800,,251,4.8604651162790695

8111193,3,B000EMGF3K,"Ros Tyler has been brutally raped and her roommate murdered, yet she has no recollection of the tragic night. Enter the handsome and compassionate police detective who quickly oversteps his professional bounds with the victim. LIE WITH ME is not one of the more exciting British police dramas but it does have an interesting premise. What if the victim has absolutely no memory of the incident but the evidence is pointing the direction of one man? The evidence is there so is there anything wrong with pretending to ""remember"" to keep a criminal off the streets?

Unfortunately, there is not much enthusiasm for a good story here. A lot of potential is missed and a lot of time is spent on an inappropriate relationship between the victim and the police detection. Andrew Lincoln from THE WALKING DEAD and Eve Best from NURSE JACKIE star. It's good to see these great actors in role pre-dating their American TV series. Not much to praise here but interesting enough to watch if you have some spare time.",1312156800,,1005,4.775862068965517
8111194,3,B000EMGF3K,"Drugged with GHB, Ros Tyler (Eve Best) has no recollection of her weekend activities.  When she awakens, however, she discovers that she has been raped, and her roommate has been murdered.  Will (Andrew Lincoln) is assigned to the case as Lead Investigator.  When Will and Ros slowly find attraction to one another - she for the security and he for the frailty - their desire for justice, and vindication, leads them towards a difficult and illegal action.

Lie With Me does a superb job of bouncing a viewer's perception back and forth despite some slow moments.  Support and derision can easily be directed at nearly every character; protagonist and antagonist are interchangeable.  Despite the somewhat early villain reveal (towards the middle of the second act), the drama fleshes out well enough to hold attention to the end.

Most important about this movie is the dichotomous approach to victims of rape and victims of false rape accusations.  The politically correct approach seems to always paint the male as a villain, but as we learned with the Duke ""rape"" case, an accusation shouldn't be a public conviction.  While amnesia played a role in this movie's plot development, that is not always the case, and there should be definite repercussions for those who ruin another's life.  Determining the truths and lies are the keys to any rape case, and the mysteries behind each are as integral parts of reality as they are this movie.

Overall average, this British suspense doesn't stand out in any specific way, but it is probably worth a rental.
