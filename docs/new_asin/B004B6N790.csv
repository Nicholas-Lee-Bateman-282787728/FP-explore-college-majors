It comes with a guide book about toy story characters, some lithographs, and a sticker book. If you want to give a kid a nice gift to go along with the movie this would be it. The lithographs are from all pixar movies, so expect Up, Monsters Inc, and other pixar movies to appear in there also the sticker book as well.

The combo pack is also a nice touch considering when I take this to my cousin's house I will be able to play the DVD version for them to watch while at my home I can watch it on Blu-ray.  The box it comes in is nice and holes everything securely so if you are going to give it as a gift to someone it will be easy to wrap. All in all a great price for a pretty nice product.",1357516800,,789,3.8641975308641974
