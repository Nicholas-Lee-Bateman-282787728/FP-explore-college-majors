No, I'm only serious. ""Snap Famous"" catches Mitchell performing his brilliant stand-up routine, and it shows a side of him that you don't get to see on Saturday nights. There are no skits here, no group performances - it's all Mitchell all the time, and he gets to stretch out a bit. If you watch the comedy channel, you'll see a lot of stand-up, but Mitchell is a cut above the rest. His style is conversational and he isn't afraid to make a fool of himself, but in a way that endears him to the audience. He discusses his move to NYC, and his experience as the new kid on the block of the longest-running comedy series on television, including encounters with Halle Berry, Brad Pitt and Prince. Also hilarious is his recollection of white people dancing, black names for children, transsexuals, and especially his stories about growing up with his teenaged mom (God help him when he goes back home to visit...). His closing bit - which happened to be his audition for Saturday Night Live - about a black crowd watching a movie with subtitles is one of the funniest things I've seen in quite a while.
In a few years, Finesse Mitchell will probably be as famous as those stars who now left him tongue-tied. When you are this good, it's inevitable. If that happens, he will no longer be able to relate to everyman in the way that he does during this stand-up routine, so see this DVD before things change. I'm only serious.
