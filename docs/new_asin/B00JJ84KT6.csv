8651215,5,B00JJ84KT6,"So, here is my review of budget bucks.  Its GREAT to see a couple of hunters hunting on public land and scoring some really nice bucks.  And, I think the Jolly bothers did a great job on their first DVD and also they show you can get some big mature bucks on public land.  You just need to put the time in scouting, and walking more than a mile off of the main road.  If you're looking for a hunting video with GREAT kill shots and them telling you HOW GREAT scent blocker is, or how they only use this type of hunting product then this video is not for you.  But if you're looking for a video of guys hunting and scoring some really nice bucks this is it!
 Also the package arrived fast and included a really nice letter, and some decals. I am looking forward to VOL 2.",1423180800,,770,4.066225165562914
