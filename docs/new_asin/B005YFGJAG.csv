4905995,4,B005YFGJAG,"Just saw the show on the History Channel.  Quite well done, though without the commercials and repeats it was more like history of the world in 60-70 minutes.  It would have been much better had they cut down on repetitions and added more details on human history.  They did talk about the role of religions in our development.  Well done, entertaining and without any major fabricated parts and, as far as I could tell, everything was based on evidence at hand.",1322956800,28,462,4.666666666666667
4905996,4,B005YFGJAG,"DVD starts from Big Bang. It's a great overview for both science and social history. The default audio setting does not work in the car, so we have to change it. my 4th Grade kid likes to watch it.",1506384000,,197,4.076923076923077

4906002,3,B005YFGJAG,Remember what happened at the end of THE MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES by H. G. Welles?  Or Orson Wells?  Either way you spell his name--I always forget--the Earth slows or stops spinning and everything flies into space.  History crammed into 2 hours instead of maybe 2 million years is a hard task.  Nice try.  Well done but I feel I have entered space without a vacuum-protection suit on.,1492387200,,388,4.565217391304348

4906017,3,B005YFGJAG,"Not the best history show, but the 3-D is the benefit.  The ""Two Hours"" is an advertising ploy.

4906028,1,B005YFGJAG,This should be called history of the world in 1.5 hours because it aired with a half hour of commercials originally. It had some interesting stuff in the last half hour but the 1st hour is basically a lesson on the theory of evolution. As someone who doesn't subscribe to the idea I found it annoying to sit through but learned how silly some of the ideas are. I like most of the history channels programs but not this one.,1465430400,,423,4.3

4906033,1,B005YFGJAG,"I bought it mainly for the 3D. Where's the 3D? Also there is more science than history...or science fiction, since it is mostly evolutionary propaganda. It tries to explain how all of this energy came from nowhere, then life spontaneously formed from non-living matter, then bacteria that became amphibians, that became reptiles, that became mammals, that became man. 58 minutes into the program it FINALLY gets into history. (History is the stuff we know because there is written documentation to support it...not just atheistic speculation and imagination.)  Overall, don't waste your money...especially if you are buying it for the 3D and are not an atheist.",1456012800,4,661,5.295238095238095
4906034,5,B005YFGJAG,Interesting for folks like me who can't stomach commercial. Also the film was very informative with great graphics and a professional production. Well worth the money.,1455062400,2,167,5.461538461538462

4906046,2,B005YFGJAG,"History Channel- It starts out fine- talking in terms of geological events and theories of evolution- but once they get to the middle ages this ""movie"" turns into a liberal speech on Evil conquistadors killing 95% of all the indigenous tribes with guns and disease.,and Evil rich white countries like ""United states polluting mankind into extinction""- I really wanted to know History not opinions , and especially opinions that have only one wing... Left",1450137600,7,454,5.148648648648648
4906047,3,B005YFGJAG,"This video should be re-titled to:  The History of the World in one and a half hours, because that's how much time it takes from beginning to end.  It does have some interesting scenes of ancient peoples re-enacting possible scenes.  And it has arrows showing how ideas spread throughout the world.  At least this video has the scientific perspective of how the world developed so maybe more people can give up the religious myths about Earth creation.  It doesn't have anything supernatural in it.  But obviously you have to gloss over a lot of material to make a short DVD on such an enormous topic.",1448064000,,601,4.6761904761904765
4906048,5,B005YFGJAG,"I found this single disc DVD, produced by the History Channel, to be very interesting and worthwhile. It's a monumental task to explore 13.7 billion years of earth's history in just 2 hours!  As the cover introduction tells us, we will get the entire story of where we came from and how we got to where we are now.  It tells an epic story in a brilliantly concise but understandable and thorough manner. If you find COSMOS to be too long (over 9 hours) for your attention span, this ""rapid fire view of history"" may be just what you're looking for:  earth's history ""from the Big Bang to the present day""  covered in (actually) about 90 minutes in a manner that is understandable, lucid and intelligible.",1447718400,3,704,4.563492063492063
4906049,5,B005YFGJAG,Obviously a very condensed program; how else can the history of the world be explained in 88 minutes? But it is a quality production that I'm sure to enjoy repeatedly.,1447372800,2,167,4.6
4906050,4,B005YFGJAG,"I really enjoyed this! However, it moved a little too fast and provided way too much information in the 88 minutes provided. My brain couldn't keep up with the wealth of information that flew by! It was like the presntation was stuck in ""fast forward"" mode. However, it was well done and is a good ""quick look"" on how the Earth was made and how we got from the Big Bang to the presnt time.",1445558400,2,389,4.2
4906051,5,B005YFGJAG,"I saw this previously on television and bought this from Amazon just to add to my video library and watch again and share with others. Beautifully put together not only visually, but topically as well.",1444521600,2,201,4.771428571428571
4906052,2,B005YFGJAG,It is geared more to the creation of the earth instead of cultures of the world.,1443916800,,80,4.0625
4906053,5,B005YFGJAG,"I cant tell you how refreshing it is to have the ENTIRE history of the world told from a mans point of view  and talk about intersectionality  from a White, European mans point of view!  So many clever, ironic ways of pointing out how the entire Universe, starting from the Big Bang to Modern Technology could be seen as a steady march of progress toward the creation of the White Man.  First, the witty usage of Mankind instead of Humankind throughout helps remind us that history was not always just the story of women giving birth, nursing, raising kids, gathering the first seeds for horticulture, inventing everything from pottery to textiles, and preparing their sons for rape and pillage. Second, the use of an almost entirely male set of experts and commentators shows how many inroads men have made into every possible academic discipline from physics to archaeology. It is also kind of cool how we see that history can be told almost entirely in terms of destruction of the environment and warfare from a POSITIVE point of view, rather than the usual dreary, pessimistic view we get from other, less enlightened sources.

The scope of this documentary is amazing, in it shows us the true purpose of Creation. We learn, for example, that hydrogen spreading from the Big Bang was destined to be part of the male body; that carbon was going to be helpful in creating hamburgers for men to eat, and that silicon from all those supernova was destined to become rocks that could be shaped to throw at unsuspecting beasts and each other. From the point of the first shaping of a stone axe, men can be seen here doing all the things we often forget that men have done to contribute to modern society, like killing off all those pesky megafauna that flourished in the Pleistocene to make way for mini-pigs and poodles and figuring out ways of guarding food stores and wives by cutting up rivals with weapons made of bronze and then iron  (originally made in the STARS!). I loved watching the spread of Mankind across the planet, with the really smart guys heading for the middle part of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe where all the best animals for steak and best grains for making beer were, and the losers turning left or heading south to just get burned red, brown, or black and become poor savages, until discovered by white guys and shown how to live. I was awed to find out the Universe with assistance of a cast of billions of men, had done so much great stuff.

Although, of course, this documentary will be appealing mainly to men, there are plenty of reasons for women to get down off their high horse and watch it.  Little girls can learn to respect boys for their contributions to history, and women can be forcefully reminded to make room for them in all disciplines and domains so they can bring their gifts for dominance and aggression even into the cabinets and boardrooms of the most powerful institutions on Earth. The History of the World in Two Hours has given me a whole new perspective on science, history, and the shaping of contemporary society that I was robbed of by being brainwashed into my feminist, multicultural, queer-friendly point of view.",1440288000,16,3177,4.691202872531418

4906055,5,B005YFGJAG,"It lacks things in a few areas, but at less than two hours that is unavoidable.  What it does present is very well done, actually beginning before the world existed, with the Big Bang and tying that into the developing history of the world.  To me, this should be required viewing for folks stuck in narrow views.. like normal teenager, for example.",1437955200,,349,4.612903225806452

This movie is an example of just that. And it's bad processing at that. Areas that should be toward the rear were in the foreground, and vice-versa.

Now about the content, I was also left flat. They were often redundant, both in words and pictures. Even at $9 it was overpriced. Don't buy it.",1431907200,2,443,4.211764705882353

American natives are dismissed as having to remain in ancient (see:inferior) traditions, with a passing mention of the 'great' civilizations of the Mayans and Incas. Christopher Columbus is made a hero without question.  The story of sugar gets more attention than the innovations of the Americas (which aren't mentioned at all, as if maize grew planted itself).  Disease is casually lumped in with guns as the reason for European success, despite the fact that disease cleared away a vast majority of natives before they even had to pull a trigger.  Asia is mentioned only in its relevance to trading with the west.  Not surprising giving the channels history, but can we please just call it as it is ""The Story of How Incredible and Deserving White People Are in Two Hours"".

I just wish they had talked a bit about some of the other prehistoric mammals besides the shrews and rats during the dinosaur ages.

There's an entire period of some seriously huge, madly carnivorous mammals----all while we were still cat food! But I'm probably biased, because I find this lesser explored time period so fascinating. But, still great documentary.",1371340800,,625,4.89622641509434

They've condensed the entire 13.7+ billion years of the universe and the 4.7+ billion years of the earth's existence into an information packed 2-hr program.

You will want to watch this show over and over again, because there is so much information in it, that you will surely learn something new each time you see it.  Nothing has ever put it all-the physical and human development processes- into such a poignant and cogent framework.  This should be a must see program in all middle and high schools, possibly even earlier.  If believe that after seeing this program you'll feel that you have a much better grasp of where mankind has come from and how; and, where we are likely to be headed as a species.

4906186,5,B005YFGJAG,"A more accurate title for this History Channel presentation would be 'A History of Planet Earth' instead of 'A History of the World', since its focus is not on the world created by man but on the development of Earth as a planet uniquely suited to sustain life.  That said, this movie is supremely effective as an overview of -- and an excellent vehicle for generating interest in -- the origins of our amazing, life-filled planet.

Who needs Creationism when the science alone proves the existence of Intelligent Design with respect to the creation of our beautiful planetary home?  And this documentary emphasizes that reality at every turn, even though it is ostensibly secular and scientific.  It unabashedly reiterates the theme that there was an INTENTION for our planet to evolve into a fit home for man, referring often to ""how the planet prepared for the rise of man.""

Despite that it has taken human history 13.7 billion years to unfold, ""everything is connected and the path leads directly to you.""  I love that, and find it far more in tune with the nature of God than the idea that humans 'magically' appeared on the planet 10,000 years ago.  A God who reminds us of patience, endurance, tenacity to stay a difficult course, the journey of a 1000 miles begins with a single step, etc., would be far more likely to create mankind IN THE WAY THAT MANKIND WAS NO DOUBT ACTUALLY CREATED than by the magical and unnatural ideas promoted by Creationism.  I'm just sayin' . . . .

Watch this film, watch it with your children, let it peak your interest in science and biology, check out books from the library related to the areas of interest which have been peaked, and make yours a household which studies together and discusses great ideas -- reveling in the ecstasy which accompanies the attainment of real knowledge. [Note that 'real knowledge' does not include sports statistics or what Kim Kardashian wore while shopping last week.]  The religion of God is education, study, the pursuit of real knowledge about life and the world around us, and then the application of that knowledge in furtherance of making human society God's Kingdom on earth.  Note that this religion has little in common with 'the world's religions' created by man.

And if you are a parent, remember that EVERY child is, in fact, a home-schooled child, whether they additionally attend a school outside the home or not.  The question is ""What are you teaching your child at home,"" not ""whether you are teaching your child at home.""  Are you stimulating your child to think and learn for him/herself, or simply repeating what others have preached to you?  Or, even worse, drifting along with the pop cultural flow at home because you mistakenly assume that it is at school that your child is being primarily educated?  Again, just sayin' . . .",1357516800,2,2829,4.7782340862423

4906190,5,B005YFGJAG,"I initially decided to watch the History Channel's documentary, 'History of the World in Two Hours' just to confirm my skepticism that it would not even come close to achieving its purpose.
Not only was I proven wrong; I was so impressed that I immediately went on-line and purchased the CD which, by eliminating the commercials, actually abridges 13.7 billion years of history into 1 hour and 28 minutes while managing to entertain, educate, and astound in such a clever, simple format that my adult children and adolescent grandchildren enjoyed it as much as I.
If you're curious to know why stars had to die so that we humans could live, the critical role bacteria played in the creation of life, or how fire and grass expedited human and social evolution, and many more such bits of scientific knowledge, I highly recommend that you invest an hour and a half of your time in watching this documentary.",1350432000,43,905,4.770700636942675

4906194,5,B005YFGJAG,"Critics of this video are a little misguided.  Of course the theme is deserving more time, but the title explains that it is doing it in two hours - so why criticize it for being shorter. Also the critic who titles his review as a ""half baked history of the world: seems to have an axe to grind as to the findings of modern science. Appeals to ""other  explanations"" smacks of  ""everybody-has-a -right-to-their-opinion"" half-baked (to use his/her phrase) post-modernism.

What the video does really well is place human history in a clear context. That Earth is possible is due to a series of remarkable events. That we, as a species, are here is also the result of a series of equally incredible events.  That evolution could have shaped our brains and behavior to be the only species that could understand all this is something to be celebrated and a source of wonder, whether you are an atheist (as I am) or a believer in a higher deity (although I would hope that if you are so, that you would be open to a lager view of creation).

My view is that all journeys benefit from being viewed both close up and from afar. This macro-view helps the viewer that has only studied American History (the common experience of many Ameicans) gain a wider view of history. Standing back and and looking at the larger view, then focusing on the narrower view, has in my opinion, great intellectual and value.

In conclusion, this video enables viewers to have a truly global (if not universal view of history).  There are many books that do the same , but they are tomes that require a great deal of time. Read then, but see this video first !!
