Unholy Alliance-Episode One: The Blue And Red Abyss.
What the hell is this unprofessionally written and filmed story?
Nevermind.
This is crap.
Mine is on the way out.
Look for it soon.
I am not kidding.",1472169600,,324,4.416666666666667

8627824,4,B00GV8B1EO,"Not so much new, except a change of scenery, century, and switching of characters...the occupations are new, but the names are still the same. Each new avatar has to have its own deviations because the story's so well-known, it's becoming a cliche. This one is more psychological than grisly but nevertheless entertaining, with a bit of an irony at the end.  Jonathan Harker's dimples aren't to be missed.",1421020800,,405,4.955882352941177
8627825,1,B00GV8B1EO,"Dracula re-bored more like it!! This has got to be one of the worst vampire movies I have ever seen. The star looks like an older Tom Cruise and his ""powers"" just involve his face and eyes getting old and creepy. Seriously? I kept waiting for stuff to happen and when it did, I kind of wish it didn't happen. And FYI, not much DOES happen. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. Just buy a Tom Cruise poster, make his eyes black and draw lines around them. You have just created Dracula Reborn, LOL.",1407888000,7,493,4.2
8627826,2,B00GV8B1EO,"Jonathan Harker (Corey Landis) is a boring real estate agent with no decent lines. He drives a Prius. He recently sold a downtown abandoned building to a convincing Vlad Sarkany (Stuart Rigby) and his side kick Reinfield (Ian Pfister). It just so happens Harker's wife Lina (Victoria Summer) looks like an old companion of our vampire. Add a guy named Van Helsing (Keith Reay) and I think you get the idea...with his wife's life at stake (pun intended).

I liked the cheap but effective vampire effects. There wasn't much in the way of horror. The plot was simplistic enough without twists, except maybe that very end thing. The characters were bland. When the vampire confronted the Latino gang, they could have done something better. Likewise they could have gave Quincy (Krash Miller) an expanded role and given Van Helsing a personality.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs. No sex. Bad oil painting nudity. $9.96 Walmart.",1396137600,4,918,4.993464052287582
