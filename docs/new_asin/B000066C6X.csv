It has that effect on you. The most documentary-like of the many Liberace DVD's, this one gives you a lot of Libby ""history."" It features Jo Ann Castle, a Libby ""clone"" herself, decked out in red feathers, enthusiastically and delightfully narrating the many segments from the crisp B&W early TV shows of the sweet baby-faced Libby winking himself practically to death, thru the Las Vegas extravaganzas of Libby's last days, fabulous capes, furs and colored fountains galore. Lib's longtime friend and stage manager adds to the nostalgia and tears with his many reminiscences. Generous bonus extras include a visit to the Liberace Museum and lots of glitter, classic cars, and tidbits for us fans. A MUST BUY for a fan!",1334707200,5,884,4.822368421052632

1712540,5,B000066C6X,DVD came as agreed and in great shape.  Loved watching Liberace from child to his wild Las Vegas shows.,1221436800,8,103,4.421052631578948
1712541,5,B000066C6X,"I was too young to see these great shows when they 1st aired, but to have them forever on dvd is a true joy.  His music is so moving and inspiring that it brings tears to your eyes.  A MUST have for any fan of classical, jazz, piano, or Lee Liberace in general.  You won't be disappointed.  The story of his rise to fame and fortune is most captivating.  When ever I need cheering up I will play this disc and feel uplifted.  Lee passed away on my mom's birthday, so I he will always be remembered by me, now and forever!!  He's in heaven now, playing loud and proud...",1027382400,50,569,4.118181818181818

7962252,5,B000066C6X,I enjoyed watching the DVD movie.  I could see it clearly and I had a good picture.  I had informative information about Liberace and it was a good telling of Liberace.  I really like the story told by Jo Ann Castle and it gave good information.  The DVD movie played well with a good picture.,1434931200,,293,4.2727272727272725
7962253,1,B000066C6X,"Most damaged DVD I've ever bought. Recommended Not to resell ; it is just not worth it to see, ""skipping over damaged areas"" constantly. Box is great but not bought for the box. Loud ""hum"" when first starts then goes downhill from there.",1432944000,,237,4.534883720930233
7962254,3,B000066C6X,His music remains the same. The various styles with the same energy.  I was disappointed to realize that this is a PBS broadcast featuring Jo Ann Castle and that they dubbed her in playing simultaneously with one of Liberace's recordings. It sounded great but I thought they had played piano together at one time. My mistake. The music is good and worth listening to. His talent is amazing.,1414627200,,390,4.735294117647059

7962257,5,B000066C6X,He's one of the world's greatest entertainers.  Very enjoyable video.  I highly recommend this for all the fans of Liberace.,1392422400,,124,5.15
7962258,5,B000066C6X,"Great DVD in perfect condition.  We look forward to watching it from time-to-time and enjoying it all over again.  It helps to keep me remembering Liberace as he was, not as Michael Douglas.  He was a great entertainer.",1390953600,,219,4.7105263157894735
7962259,3,B000066C6X,"I could have done without Joann Castle. She really didn't add anything, but oh, well. Anything with Liberace on a DVD is appreciated.",1390089600,,133,4.826086956521739
7962260,3,B000066C6X,More of a documentary than anything else. Mostly old stuff from his black and white TV show during the fifties.  Almost nothing from his acts later in life. Too much moderator talking to suit me.,1354060800,6,195,4.571428571428571
