8731535,5,B014Q67LQ4,"I have an old dvd that was watchable, but honestly not great by any means. Calling it watchable is as polite as I can be about it. A real ""best available"" kind of thing. I love the movie, and when I looked into this Warner Archive copy, I had to gamble that it would be better than my print.

And, well...$18 well spent!

The picture really is incredible. At first, I couldn't believe how good it looked. I went back and forth between my old copy and this one, and it is like night and day. Warner has done an amazing job with the restoration and remastering.

There are a few caveats:
- As is clear from the other reviews, the subtitles are closed captioned. Now, while seeing (music continues) pop up in the middle of scenes is annoying, the movie is too good to let that ruin it.
- The subs themselves do differ from my other copy, but I couldn't tell you which is a more accurate translation (It's been a bit since I watched the movie, and only skipped around on this copy when it arrived)
- It is a DVD-R. There is still a top disc label stamped on it, so you aren't getting a disc that says Verbatim on it with Pedicab Driver scribbled in sharpie. It looks fine.
- The disc menu is a picture of the box art and a ""Play"" button. That's it.

So, it's clear that Warner took their time making this (and I assume the other Golden Harvest releases) look great, but had no idea how to market it and didn't want to sink a bunch more money into the catalog. Regardless, the cut corners don't ruin the experience. The movie has never looked better, and, more importantly, won't look better anytime soon unless Warner does a proper blu release.

So, you can track down an older print, which will have ""better"" subs, but sub-par picture quality, or this version, which has superb picture quality with some mildly irritating subs.

The movie itself is fantastic - sincere, exciting, hilarious, and genre-bending. A real microcosm of 80s Hong Kong cinema. It's one of those movies where you aren't really sure what to expect going in, and you really aren't sure what to expect once the movie starts, but it just kind of sucks you in. It's goofy, but also serious, and there is a love story, but also some brutal fights. It's got everything you could want out of a movie and, until otherwise, this is the copy to own.",1489017600,3,2309,4.370629370629371

8731537,4,B014Q67LQ4,"long waited release, one of the best Sammo Hung's production from the 80s HK cinema!
Great picture quality. hope Warner will release more GH titles on blu-ray.",1460937600,,159,4.925925925925926
8731538,5,B014Q67LQ4,"Great movie, thank you Warner Archive for helping preserve HK cinema for new and old audiences alike!

My only complaint is that the subtitles are closed caption for the deaf so you get annoying text like ""sad music continues"" that really kills the mood when watching the film. A deaf and non-deaf subtitle option would have been nice.",1460592000,,335,4.775862068965517
8731539,5,B014Q67LQ4,"Be forewarned this is a MOD (movie on demand) AKA burned disc.  You do get a nice snapcase and a label on the disc.

Movie-wise, this is awesome.  If you're reading this you probably already know what this movie is, or have seen some bootleg over the years.

The picture quality is really pretty good.  It's better than most, if not all, Fortune Star released Golden Harvest movies that I've seen.  Heck, it's better than some of the Fortune Star Blu-ray I've seen, but maybe that isn't the strongest compliment.  Don't expect to be blown away, but there is minimal print damage, a nice encode, vibrant colors, and good blacks.  I've seen much better looking DVDs, but not very many better looking Golden Harvest DVDs from this era.  I have no complaints in the audio department either.  Original audio that doesn't appear to be tampered with.  That's what I want.  There is no english/dub available.  As another reviewer stated, the subtitles are subs for the hearing impaired [music intensifies] and [thwacking] throughout.  Would have been nice to have two sets of subtitles, once without the CC.

No special features or anything like that.",1453075200,3,1143,4.849740932642487
8731540,4,B014Q67LQ4,"Ok. So, what do we have here. Yes, the A/V quailty of this is the highest this film has ever had. True Kung Fu fans will definitely want a copy. Let's go over the negatives about this release though. It is as the description says a 4.5 gb DVD-r disc. You get the original Cantoneses track and removal subtites ( from the remote, not the painfully bare menu which looks like it was home brewed by your buddy). That's it. Barebones as bare bones can be. The translation for the subtitles is just barely above the original 'engrish' one from the laserdisc. Also, the subtitles are closed captions subtitles. So be prepared to read ""[grunting]"" and '[music intensifies""] a lot. It's fairly annoying. Still as I stated earlier, this is a must buy it's a true classic of the genre that has never had a legitimate DVD release before. We can only hope this leads to Warner Archive putting out more of the 200 Hong Kong films that they have releasing rights. To sum up, It's got some issues but it's still totally worth your money. So, pick it up and show WB that there is a market out there for these Hong Kong classics!",1449964800,11,1112,4.429268292682927
8731541,5,B014Q67LQ4,"I can't Believe Warner is releasing Pedicab Driver on DVD. This movie has only seen a the  light of day only in bootleg form. For some weird reason this Golden Harvest movie fell in into Warner Bros copy rights hands and hasn't let it go since 1989. So Golden Harvest could not release a remastered DVD. I can't wait. Anyone who is a fan of Golden HArvest and Shaw Bros knows this movie has the iconic fight scene of Sammo Hung vs Lau Kar-leung the Director and star of such movies as :Mad Monkey Kung Fu, 36 Chambers trilogy, Heroes of the East and many more Shaw Bros classics. I hope the quality is clean and the audio comes with optional Cantonese with English Subtitles.",1449014400,4,675,4.4
