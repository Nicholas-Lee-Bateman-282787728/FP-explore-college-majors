7910360,4,B00000ID0V,"I have to admit that pretty much the only reason i bought this dvd was because it featured Lucy Lawless in a very little-known role.

I'm verty glad to say i was pleasantly surprised.

Peach is a magnificent, picturesque, quaint and passionate insight into an everyday situation, taken from a very personal perspective. Although short, every second is made to maintain the standard running throughout.

A Bitter Song (Lucy Lawless' first film role) is intoxicating. I was unable to tear my eyes away from the powerful childs view of the world, showing so many unique situations in a brand new way that is rarely even thought of.

Very highly recommended.",1173744000,5,654,4.918181818181818
7910361,5,B00000ID0V,"I must admit that Peach is indeed a must to have for Lucy Lawless fans.  I followed that same advise and it really is a must to have it.  Allthough it is a shortfilm, it is a very nice and tempting small movie.  Lawless in one of her first performance already put a very strong acting there.  Same kind of manner, same kind of talking, just all Lawless as we will see her later on in Hercules and ofcourse Xena, going further in X-files and BSG.  A very nice acting on the edge of romance and tempting love.

I advise strongly to buy it if you are a Lucy Lawless fans.",1151452800,7,568,4.072072072072072
7910362,3,B00000ID0V,"For any Lucy Lawless fan, or GLBT drama fan, ""Peach"" is a must see.  Short, but artistic, it is worth seeing.  For the price, however . . . I guess it depends on your fandom-ness.  My friend bought it about four years ago.  We were both obsessive Xena fans, and were both coming out of the closet, but I guess she was slightly more obsessive in both areas.  Great video, but I wouldn't pay more than 12 bucks for it.  Then again, she always called me a cheapskate.",1012694400,9,464,4.215909090909091

It is the stupedist, dreariest, most boring thing i have ever sat through....Lucy Lawless Fans Beware,  if you blink you will miss her...please save your money...and if you think there are gong to be titillating sex scenes,  forget it...anything sexual is implied,  you see absolutely nothing....",984700800,12,300,5.340425531914893
7910364,2,B00000ID0V,"I wanted this movie, i bought it, now i regret it. Not worth that money. This MIGHT be a good movie for people that like to think and analyze about the consept of the motion picture. ""Peach"" is more enjoyable, it catches your attention and you anticipate what comes next. BUT there's no NEXT - movie just ends. I like Lucy Lawless, but i didn't like those movies. Then again - tastes are different...",972345600,5,400,4.418918918918919
7910365,1,B00000ID0V,"Pass this by, folks. Unless, like some of my friends, you need to pull a joke on someone. It is simplistic, yawning, and cartoony.  LL barely appears in both films. And just when you think something interesting may  happen, it's the end. When are they going to offer XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS  videos?",928368000,4,298,4.6923076923076925
7910366,1,B00000ID0V,"Lucy Lawless in the movie PEACH: Peach is a very low buget movie and it shows. lots of smiles from the girls, but very little touching. No lip action at all. Lucy Lawless does more touching and kissing with same sex on  her show XWP. Save your money, tune into XWP.",927417600,8,265,4.196078431372549
