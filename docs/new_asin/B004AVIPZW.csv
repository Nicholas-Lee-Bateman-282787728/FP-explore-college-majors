8421001,4,B004AVIPZW,This is a great video that shows how the presenter makes one of his knives. Production quality is very good. The maker explains what he's doing clearly and takes you through the whole process starting with a piece of round bar stock right through to the finishing of the blade and the construction of a leather sheath to go with it. That's a lot of info packed into one DVD.,1366156800,,374,4.357142857142857
