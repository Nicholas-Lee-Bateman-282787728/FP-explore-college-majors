2612700,3,B000GHIVNU,"We have Baby Signing Time Volumes 1 and 2.  Volume 1 is much more fun and engaging - at least to our baby.  The music in Vol. 2 is a little less catchy, and the signs taught aren't as relevant (other than ""Please, Thank You, Sorry"")  Our baby loves Volume 1 so much, and seems less interested in Vol. 2 that we mostly play Vol. 1 for him.",1175558400,24,338,3.9411764705882355
2612701,5,B000GHIVNU,"I recently purchased Baby Signing Time Vol 1&2 along with Signing Time Vol 1 & 2. My son is 18 months old and my husband and I have been trying to teach him a few signs on our own for months. He was picking them up, but slowly. He's been watching the 4 videos off and on for 2 weeks and has picked up 16 new signs. I have been amazed with his progress. He really enjoys all of the videos; it is great the way they incorporate other children signing. I am planning on buying the rest of the series as well as the Baby Signing Time Vol 1&2 for my niece who is 4 months younger.",1170892800,10,575,3.8813559322033897
2612702,5,B000GHIVNU,"I highly recommend Baby Signing Time. We started watching the fist volume when my daughter was 12 months old. She was immediately captivated and by 15 months (with parental reinforcement) she knew all the signs (vol 1 and 2) and was using many of the signs on a daily basis. I like Baby Signing Time best (we also own My Baby Can Talk) because it's entertaining for baby & parents. And although you'll get the songs stuck in your head, they're fun and you won't mind when your child wants to watch again and again, and again!",1163462400,4,525,4.422680412371134
2612703,5,B000GHIVNU,"If my son could crawl off in the sunset with Rachel, the host, I doubt I would ever see him again.  I bought this on the recomendation of a friend with an older child, and have been impressed with how the tapes connect with a baby.

My son will probably never be fluent in sign language, but that wasn't our intent.  We hope he will communicate with us before having a meltdown.  While that goal might still be some months off, the DVDs have given this mommy something more valuable:  20 minutes to shower.  Priceless.",1159488000,12,518,4.4

2612705,5,B000GHIVNU,"My 2 year old grandson loved the first volume. Now we watch this one together also, learning the signs together.  The combination of real people including little ones signing, with songs, combine with animation make the videos fun, attention grabbing, and an easy way to learn and reinforce the signs.definintely a winner. Will also be purchasing the next 2 volumes.",1507507200,,366,5.1

2612710,5,B000GHIVNU,"My son asks to watch this all the time. He knows all the signs now from both this video and the one that came before it. I know some people don't like that this video also shows other babies (poorly) signing the words, but I found it super helpful. It helped me recognize what my son was signing. He started this at 1, and his coordination was only so good. So his signs looked a bit strange. He just turned 2 and now his signs are a lot more accurate.  Since I could see variations of how a baby might make a certain sign, I easily recognized what my son was trying to say even if his signs weren't exact.

My son communicates with signs a lot, and he also tries to say the word along with the sign. This has helped his vocabulary, and it also helps us better understand him and what he wants or needs. He gets so happy when we understand him so easily and he likes being able to communicate so well even though his speech is still limited.",1500163200,,941,4.108695652173913

She has learned countless signs from watching this & she loves the music; I catch her singing the songs all the time! Currently she knows probably around 100 signs! @ 14 months she knew around 30 words and it makes understanding what baby wants, sometimes it's easier for baby to sign rather than say.",1487980800,,395,4.424657534246576

2612725,5,B000GHIVNU,"Before my kids were born, I knew I wanted to teach them some basic sign language to help with the language development, communication, and all that jazz that people say is good for kids. I'd gotten a few sign language books and was trying to learn some basic stuff on my own. Then, I sent a photo of my pregnant belly to a friend and in the background was one of my sign language books. She said I HAD to buy some Signing Time DVDs. I trust this friend and her advice, so I looked into it. Wowsers! I certainly could not afford the Signing Time package...it was like $200 or something...so I decided just to collect the DVDs as I could. I ended up finding a ton at thrift stores and kid consignment shops.

So, I was able to put together a pretty substantial collection of Signing Time DVDs without actually buying the full kit.

Then, when my oldest daughter was 8 months old, we took a trip. At this point, she was so addicted to Signing Time and actually starting to use some signs, so I wanted to keep the entertainment and lessons up...both for myself and for her. Because we just had an iPad for traveling, I bought an entire season of Signing Time on iTunes. Love it. Use it. Worth it. Even though each episode is only about 10 minutes and 2 minutes of that is the introduction EVERY SINGLE TIME. Ugh!!!!!!!!

Then...we got a car with a built-in DVD player. At the same time, we put cupboard locks on our entertainment center so our kids couldn't get into our DVDs and stuff. All of our DVDs went to the car and we basically stopped using DVDs altogether, in favor of Amazon Videos, Netflix, and Hulu.

For about a minute, you could watch Signing Time on Netflix. Awesome. Then that stopped and the only way to stream Signing Time was through Amazon Videos. And you couldn't BUY the videos...you have to actually rent them at what I consider to be an outrageous price for only a few days.

FORGET THAT!! I'm so annoyed with Signing Time for chasing the dolla dolla. At this point, my kids love the episodes so much and are actually learning so much from them, that I see the value and would actually spend a ton of money to buy the episodes if I could stream them because we keep the DVDs in the car. I'd rather them watch Signing Time than any other program while I'm making dinner or nursing the new baby or something. But instead, we've just stopped watching Signing Time altogether unless we are in the car.

I really, really love Signing Time for so many reasons and am frustrated that I have to rent--not buy--episodes to stream. I've got more kids coming and can't afford to rent these episodes on Amazon every week for the next 5 years!

I'd encourage everyone to buy the DVD set, which I would have done originally if I had known how great it would be for our kids. However, who does DVDs anymore?!",1468108800,5,2814,4.379310344827586

2612728,5,B000GHIVNU,I was so surprised how fast my son picked up on all of the signs. I really helps him communicate with us and prevents him from getting frustrated. The only bad thing I can say is that baby signing time song will get stuck in your head FOREVER!,1465862400,,243,4.083333333333333
2612729,5,B000GHIVNU,We are convinced that our son developed strong language skills early on in part because of these videos. They really helped him communicate basic needs to us when he was little and reduced his frustration level a lot.,1463788800,,217,4.7368421052631575

2612736,5,B000GHIVNU,"My 1 1/2 year old daughter watched these over and over until she knew all the signs.  It taught us both the basics and am I so glad because now that she's almost 2, she rarely has communication melt downs.  She can express herself much more easily than other toddlers I see around with less grunting and whining or crying.  yay signing time. I highly recommend it for any parent to toddler aged kiddos, as long as you're willing to learn too.  When I am out and about or at play groups, there is a big difference in her ability to communicate with me and her happiness around that.  Without the confusion or lack of being understood, we can just keep flowing.  Other little children often (from what I've seen) get upset when what they are saying isn't understood.  Even the simplest little things can be a trigger for a fussy scene.",1457222400,,833,4.440789473684211

As for quality of the video and the content, there's nothing better. This is the only screen time our daughter had, and she started watching it around 3 months old. She was recognizing our signs around 7 months old, was actively communicating with us via sign language at 12 months and was 100% verbal at 17-18 months, but she still always uses signs along with what she's saying which makes it so helpful when deciphering her cute little toddler jibber jabbers.

He doesn't use a lot of the signing but is learning the words instead and he loves to sing and dance along. I sometimes sing the songs to him while driving, it really calms him down when he's having a fit. I'm glad that at least the music is well composed and of great instrumental quality. That makes it a little easier to bear when the songs get stuck in your head, which happens often and most likely will continue to happen for the next couple of years.",1446681600,,582,4.114035087719298

2612776,5,B000GHIVNU,We love Signing Times! My son was signing 30+ signs at 9 months because of these DVDs. Signing was such a huge help dealing with a child that can't talk yet. Highly recommend the series,1406246400,,185,4.314285714285714

Compared to the Signing Time which are geared to older children, the Baby Signing Time use songs for each mini lesson which is so helpful for teaching the signs to my daughter who seems to be a musical learner (she has Trisomy 21/Down syndrome).  This video has great songs and fun signs about cars and toys and bedtime routine.  Very helpful.

I make certain to watch the videos with my daughter so I can not only learn the signs but see how she actual signs them so I know when she is using them.  She picks up the signs quite easily and uses them daily.  And contrary to what I have heard from some, she has increased her vocabulary through signing.  She says every word that she signs and those were her first words, too.  She even signs Baby when she wants to watch Baby Signing Time.",1400025600,2,829,4.337662337662338

Baby Signing Time in general is a wonderful product. The mixture of an upbeat host, easy songs that really get in your head, signs repeated and demonstrated by both an adult and other children, plus reading the word on-screen, a mixture of live shots and animation all make it a frequent request at our house.",1398902400,4,542,4.474747474747475

It took a while for my kiddos to get it, but they were interested and wanted to watch it all the time.  After that it was only a matter of time before they started to sign as well.  The whole set is the best signing DVD's out there.  I agree that some of the signs are a bit difficult for kiddos to learn, but as a parent/ guardian/ caregiver you will learn what their sign is for that particular word.

My baby gets all exited when she hears the intro music now because she knows what is coming!

We used this DVD and volume 1 since my daughter was about 8 months old (she is now 17 months) and it REALLY helped her develop great communication.  I like this volume because it offers many useful words for a young toddler.  People often comment that my daughter communicates well with me and it's mainly because of sign language and now her knowledge of basic vocabulary.  This DVD has really helped establish some basics.  Aside from being a great teaching tool, the songs and production quality of the DVD is top-notch.  I find myself singing the catchy tunes a lot!  My daughter also loves to sing and sign along with Rachel and the other characters.  I would highly recommend Baby Signing Time Volume 1 & 2.",1374192000,,818,4.586206896551724

It is never too early to start working on loving communication with your child & these videos really help young children learn to communicate their wants & needs & joy to parents & caregivers. Volume 2 did not disappoint!  Our 11 month old granddaughter loves all the videos & has learned many signs already. Based on American Sign Language, or ASL, the children (as well as parents & caregivers!) not only learn to communicate with more than just words, but are also learning a 2nd language that can be used to communicate with others as well.

Now she is 16 month old and she is able to tell us what she wants or what she needs. And it is absolutely amazing that she can sign please,thank you and sorry in right time and meaning it. If I need to do anything, I know those dvd's will keep her busy and she will have a fun time watching it. No more wining and bored child in our house.",1362009600,,663,3.742857142857143

2612825,5,B000GHIVNU,"Besides showering our baby with love, teaching her to sign was one of the greatest things we have done for ourselves and our daughter! No joke!

I had always wanted to teach my child how to sign long before it was the new, cool thing to do. I had taken a course in college about signing and it just ingrained into me the need to do this with children.

When my baby was born we waited until about 10 months old to start teaching sign language. I realized that me teaching her was great but it took longer then I thought for her to catch on to it. My sister bought me this DVD for my daughter's 1st birthday and I was so excited! I was going to have a helper on this journey!

Within the first week my daughter was signing 12 signs!!! We have since purchased I think just about every Baby Signing Time & Signing Time there is! My daughter could communicate with us so early on and was so much more happy because of it. She is also crazy smart which I attribute somewhat to helping her sign early.

This is the best thing around when it comes to signing. Rachel, the kids, the characters, the songs are all done right. My daughter is now 5 and speaking up a storm, but we still use signs to communicate in a quiet place, or if we are trying to communicate without drawing attention.

Since my daughter has mastered this DVD, I have not had it on my DVD shelf because everyone seems to want to borrow it! Please, please invest in these DVDs....its beyond worth it!",1356480000,,1461,4.222222222222222

The oldest has been able to communicate with us using some of the basic signs like eat and more for at least four months now. While the youngest is just getting the notion of what the signs mean.

2612834,5,B000GHIVNU,My son was a late talker and at 15 months wasn't saying anything yet. Not even Mama and Dada. Within a week of beginning this series he had already picked up 10+ signs. At 2 years he is still a little behind on speaking but has played tremendous catch up and we think its because of the signing. He still loves to sign while he talks and will ask for these videos. Great option if you don't want your child to just sit in front of the TV and watch uneducational programming. Would highly recommend the whole series!,1328745600,,515,4.26530612244898

And when she was around 11 months old, she literally woke up one day and started baby signing ""MORE, MILK, BANANA, DOG, BOOK, CEREAL, WATER"", etc...  Clearly, she got so excited with communicating to us that by the time she turned 1, she began to say each word as she signs.  We couldn't be more pleased and happy with this wonderful educational DVDs!

It's good for the little ones to see kids their own age doing the signs.  It shows them they don't have to do it perfectly and while we love the regular Signing Time DVD's we find the Baby ones are at a little better pace for her for now (for us too!) Definitely one of the best gifts she been given ever!!!",1312588800,,626,4.08130081300813

2612842,5,B000GHIVNU,"My son started watching these videos when he was about 10 months old. Some of the words that they teach are very helpful like ""eat"" and ""more"" (volume 1), especially at that young age when they can't speak but want to communicate. The songs are very catchy so they keep his attention. It's a good mix of cartoon characters and real kids, which he loves. Even if you aren't focused on teaching baby sign language, I think it's a good vocabulary builder because it focuses on simple, everyday words that are reinforced by pictures/videos and the actual word flashes on the screen. My son is now 2 years old and we still watch the videos every now and then. This time, he says the words as they appear on the screen. I've also given this as gifts to my friends. We bought volume 2 because our son loved volume 1.  At first I thought the songs weren't as good as volume 1, but they eventual grew on me and love this as much as the 1st.  One of the chapters is about washing hands and we actually sing the song as we wash hands - sort of as an alternative to singing ""Happy Birthday"" or whatever song to get them to keep lathering up for 10+ seconds.",1306713600,,1145,4.271889400921659

Although she is no hearing impaired my daughter and son-in-law as well as myself felt it was important for her to learn a second language, i.e., sign. She started watching Volume I when she was only 2 months old, she watched it at least every other day until she was about a year. Suddenly one day at the dinner table she signed for more and starting using all the signs that she had previously learned. It is a great way for her to communicate since as a 20 month old some of her words are difficult to understand. She started watching Volumes 2, 3 and 4 and her vocabulary has already expanded  in just 10 days.",1304812800,,662,4.296

Just remember to watch it with your kids so you can learn the signs, too. They will catch on really quick. My son remembers every sign in both of our videos and does them while he's talking. Sometimes he is hard to understand so if he signs at the same time, we know exactly what he is talking about.",1304121600,,606,4.278260869565218

The Signing Time Story is inspirational, the videos are educational and fun.  I enjoyed using them with my 3rd and 4th babies, but the older kids liked them too and they helped all of us (and grandma) learn how to sign with our little ones.  My 3rd child could sign 60+ words before she could speak - what an amazing window into her little world that I might not otherwise have had.  I also love the the videos show children of all abilities.  Great series - 3 and 4 came along too late for us to use with little ones, but if I had a older baby/toddler, I would definitely be interested.",1303171200,,715,4.115107913669065
2612846,5,B000GHIVNU,"The Baby Signing Time videos are fantastic. They are entertaining, engaging, and educational, and completely bearable for adults (even on a loop in the DVD player). I have given Volumes 1 and 2 as a first birthday present to many, many friends' kids, and it has always been a winner. Kids really seem to click with the songs and they pick up the signs with great ease--as do the parents, thank goodness. The signing helps kids communicate before they're vocally capable, which really helps to avoid teary outbursts from frustration and full-out tantrums. Naturally, I got the DVDs for my own daughter, and the signing has been a great help to her in both learning to communicate period, as well as verbally. She is 21 months now and still signs a bit, but as she speaks (some people seem concerned that signing impedes verbal development, but I have not found this to be the case with my child or with my friends' kids). I highly, highly recommend these DVDs.",1302739200,,959,4.680473372781065

She didn't start doing any signs until just before her first birthday, but the DVD always kept her interest and made her laugh so kept playing it for her. As soon as she learned her first sign she began using at least half of the signs in the DVD within a month. At that time I got her volume 2 and she loves it just as much. I will say these signs aren't as practical as the ones from Vol 1, but still very engaging and fun! She is now 14 months old and seems to use a new sign every day. I am especially impressed that she uses signs that I hardly ever use myself (the first few she picked up were ones that I really tried to reinforce by using daily when I talk with her). She also has caught onto a few signs that I started using that were not in either of the videos because she's used the the idea of using sign language. I love being able to know what she is thinking and asking for and knowing that she understands me when I want to say something to her through signing. It makes me a little sad for other parents who don't get to experience this kind of communication!",1301616000,,1168,3.9957264957264957

Plus it gives me 20 minutes to fold laundry, do the dishes and other minor house work while in the same room.  These are great DVDs.  And even if she doesn't pick up on it 100% I'm happy to have those 20 mins to catch up.

We were getting tired of watching the Baby Signing Times Volume 1 and My Baby Can Talk, so this was a refreshing addition to our collection. He really took to some of the signs right away. He started signing hat a lot, and now we are always playing with hats and pointing out strangers that have hats on. He likes the transportation song. He enjoys watching these sign language videos much more than other things like cartoons on TV. I think it's because he can understand what's going on, so he stays engaged. Volume 2 is less upbeat than Volume 1, but it's a good expansion to the vocabulary.",1292371200,,645,4.47457627118644

Our 18 month old son absolutely LOVES these DVD's!!!  If we let him he'd be perfectly content sitting in front of the TV all day long doing nothing but watching these DVD's.  His signing (and ours) has improved immensely.  After just a few viewings his signing and speaking vocabulary has tripled.  He throws out new signs or words every day.  He even sings and signs the theme song every time he wants to see the video - which is pretty much 24/7.  As of right now he has roughly 50-60 ASL signs and close to 50 spoken English.

2612861,5,B000GHIVNU,"I recognize that is a big thing for someone to say, but I am serious.  We tried several Baby Signing DVDs and none of them held my baby's attention.  Within a very short time of playing the Baby Signing Time DVDs, my child began signing. She is non verbal for reasons not related to learning sign language. In fact, because of the signing she has learned, she is making sounds to try to say words with her signs.  My daughter is 2 1/2 and has Down syndrome. She can sign up to about 200 words and recognize the written word for many of the signs and respond with the sign. It is our main form of communication with her.

Additionally, these products demonstrate inclusion - they include children with and without special needs. They also teach many of the things children need to learn like how to set a table, what to do at school, what is in your neighborhood as well as the basic baby signs - more, eat, milk, etc.  And, from an adult perspective, the music and songs are wonderfully performed and I find myself singing to them even with my daughter isn't with me.

By 12 months he knew all the signs on the first dvd and now at 18 months he is able to ""sign and say"" all the signs on both videos.

She always enjoyed the characters and was engrossed from the beginning. I saw that there was a Vol 2 and bought it when she was about 10 months. I highly recommend these DVDs. They're extremely well-made for being non-branded (ie Sesame Street, Baby Einstein). The songs are produced at a quality that's much higher than a lot of kids' music out there.

She began signing ""all done"" and ""water"" at about 9 months. The repetitive, catchy songs helped me remember all of the signs and reinforce them as we went about our day. She has picked up more signs and surprises us almost weekly with a new sign! She is also very verbal, saying about 8 words already. I think the DVDs have played a huge role in my daughter's ability to sign so early. The repetition helps tremendously. Overall using baby signs has been a great bonding tool for our family and I can't help but believe she is much less frustrated than she would be otherwise, without a way to communicate her needs and other thoughts. The other day I walked in the room wearing a hat, and her first reaction was to look up at me, smile and sign ""hat."" She also surprised us the other day by signing ""wash hands"" when the phrase came up in conversation. It's such a special way to promote early learning and supporting babies' ability to communicate.

My husband & I watch it with him in the evening to help him ""gear down"" for bed. He will sit on our laps for the whole 30 minute show!! (unbelievable, really!) I think he could watch it on repeat day & night. The songs are super-catchy...so much so that Mommy & Daddy were ready to see what volume 2 had to offer. We knew it was time when he were quoting ""Where's your owie?"" to each other! ha!

It is fascinating to see that your child comprehends much more than you might think.  For instance, my husband always walks in the door and says ""I'm going to wash my hands"" before he picks her up.  After watching the video once or twice, the next time her daddy walked in the door, she began doing the sign for ""wash hands"" before he even said it.  Sign language gives you insight into what your child might be thinking.  My daughter loves bananas, a sign she learned in the first video.

My daughter has been signing all her life and it's so second nature for her. Yes, at times she only signs, but most of the time she says the word as she signs it so no need to worry about it delaying speech.",1234483200,3,334,4.0
2612889,3,B000GHIVNU,"My 15 month old has loved the Baby Einstein ""First Signs"" video for months now.  She, therefore, knows all the signs and was getting bored with it so I thought this one may be comparable.  Not so much...
The signs are accurate and the presentation is ok, but it does not interest my little girl.  The music and fast pace of the video is also annoying if you're used to the calmer theme of the Einstein video.

I will continue using this video in hopes that she may start to like it one day - but no luck in the month since we got it!  The signs taught are good ones for little ones to know - but this video series (I also have the Signing Time Everyday Signs video) does not get the attention of my little one.

UPDATE 2/2/09- since my review just a few days ago my little one has decided she likes this video!  she has 'asked' to watch it for 3 days in a row now and she has started imitating some of the signs.  it still annoys me and my thoughts on the video are still the same, however, i will reconsider my plans to not purchase any other ones....we may end up with another signing time video in our house one day.",1233187200,2,1119,4.077625570776256

He gets bored and walks off.  He sits and watches the whole Volume one though which is literally the only thing he'll watch.  He hasn't learned any of the 2 signs because he won't watch it.

2612900,5,B000GHIVNU,We have enjoyed this DVD a lot.  Our daughter is captivated by it and has learned many of the signs.  The songs are catchy and both my husband and I sing them to our daughter.  The format is great for younger kids who are interested in watching other kids sign.  Some of the signs are a little too difficult for our child at this age but that only means the DVD will grow with her as she gets older.  We will be buying the other Signing Time volumes as well.,1222560000,,458,4.044444444444444

Plus we have volume 2 of baby signing time. It has helped me to learn ASL as well. I'm really glad I found out about Signing Time. My twins are almost 2 years old now and were starting with tantrums and it was all because of communication problems. They almost never throw tantrums now because they can communicate with me. It also helps me understand what they are saying since so many of their words are not easy to understand yet as their speech is not developed enough. For example dada and kitty sound very similar but now I can tell the two apart when they use the signs with the words. If you are using ASL in your home or are interested in using baby sign language you have to have signing time videos. It cost me a couple hundred dollars to buy the 15 dvds and the sing alongs but I would do it all over again. They have paid for themselves over and over with hours of fun and learning and a less-stressed mommy, too!",1213574400,,1144,4.228310502283105

He has also been able to tell them when he was hungry, thirsty or hurt.  The ability to communicate before they are really able to speak all these words is absolutely invaluable and avoids much frustration and acting out due to an inability to make themselves known.

I had read a review of the Baby ST that said they didn't like it as well as the regular ST dvds.  So, I was reluctant to purchase them.  Fortunately our library has vol. 1 of the Baby ST, I thought it was Great and since my son has mastered most of the signs in vol. 1, I purchased vol 2.  HE LOVES IT!  perfect for bedtime, as the 'bedtime' signs are at the end of the dvd.  It is more animated than the regular ST dvds, but ever bit as good.

But I get sick of the same thing over and over, and the later Baby Einstein videos with sign language don't really teach babies the signs--there is not enough reinforcement.  So I looked around for another series and bought this DVD and a ""My Baby Can Talk"" at the same time.  This DVD was not interesting to my 8-month-old.  He likes the ""My Baby Can Talk,"" but this one spends too long on one idea to hold his attention. We will try it again in several more months, though.",1196640000,,610,4.224137931034483

A song accompanies each sign  along with various babies and toddlers signing them and pictures.  My son loves dancing to the music has learned many of not all of the signs.  Watched them practically every day  and used the signs to communicate from about 1 or so (eat, more, milk).  He had a language explosion at around 16 or so months and started speaking and signing a lot of the words.

I started letting her watch it at 5 months--not too interested.  I let her watch a few more times when she was 6 months, she would watch about 10-15 minutes before she lost interest.  Around 7 months, she was hooked!  She sits from the time I put in the dvd, until the credits roll.  She is very engaged and we try to review the signs with her as we watch.  She LOVES hopkins the frog.  The kids are adorable and they demonstrate how a child may interepret the signs (their interpretation is not always exact I've learned!).  She is now 8.5 months old and I just introduced the vol. 2 and she just loves it!  It gives us great time together, I sing the songs to her about ""its time to eat"" and ""diaper dance"" and ""mom has a mom..."" and she just smiles with delight and recognition.

The music is great, even my husband sings it around the house, and the older children watch it and help reinforce the signs with the baby.

I would highly recommend it.

They used Singing Time DVD's at our middle child's preschool and she picked it up so fast.  So once I saw the Baby Signing Times DVDs I knew it would be great.",1188604800,5,583,4.034782608695652

Older kids as well as adults find them fun!  After a few viewings, with assistance from family members, baby soon gets the idea.  Soon baby will start making crude signs for things like ""milk"" and ""eat"".  Then everyone knows exactly what baby wants, and baby gets gratification with minimal tears.

I wish these were available sooner.  Everyone should try them, they are wonderful !  We love ""The Diaper Dance!!""",1183852800,3,564,4.742268041237113

The songs are catchy (a little TOO catchy maybe--I've found myself singing them more than once while out and about . . .), the DVDs are stimulating but not OVER-stimulating, and they are just right for teaching little ones the essential signs to communicate basic needs and vocabulary.

My son is 16 months and has over 20 signs, as well as nearly that many words (not common at his age, and I attribute that to the signing as well).  We all LOVE these DVDs, and he will come running as soon as he hears the music.

DEFINITELY worth buying--being able to REALLY communicate with such little ones is absolutely priceless!",1182470400,2,760,4.525547445255475

At first she was used to the format of Signing Time Vol 1-3 so it took her a couple of times to show interest in Baby Signing Time. The beginning of the video is more upbeat, with more movement and towards the end it mellows down, in terms of music. The signs are super easy for babies and the songs just tie everything together. Highly recommended for the under 4 crowd.",1177632000,4,488,4.373626373626373

He loves seeing the little children and babies on TV and he watches pretty intently for about 1/2 the video; pretty normal at this age, I think. When it show a sign for something, like a shoe, it says the word, shows shoes and kids playing with shoes, as well as everyone signing the word shoe. So it doesn't only teach sign, it actually teaches vocabulary. Personally, I love it for me. I'd been wanting to take classes to learn sign and these are easy and fun. I highly recommend it, and the other signing times videos to the whole family. They're short, only about half hour, so no time to get bored.
