6256585,5,B00IBKXT3G,"The Music is slightly more upbeat in the Second Season as you move towards the end.  Nothing beats the music for the Third Season as its obvious this is where Marine Boy hits his stride as a series.  However in Season 2 Marine Boy settles into a predictable pattern. The villian types are very well established.  Most of the bad guys are just plain straight our crazy people who want to use the oceans as a platform to take over the world.  Yet these bad guys aren't the Pinky and the Brain kind of megamaniacs. The Brain felt he would lead the world to greatness if only he could dominate us all for our own good.  NOPE the mad men in the Marine Boy Universe are the fun kind of evil who want to take over the world because; they are greedy sociopathys bent on weird twisted ideas of riches and glory like Caligula.

The bad guys in the Marine Boy Universe simply had to be stopped.  Generally the bad guys in the Marine Boy Universe were created during when the National Associaytion of Broadcasters had in place something called the ""Television Code"" that said in effect on TV bad can never be shown to prevail over good in a socially negative fashion. Remember Marine Boy was created in the 1960's long before cable and the loosening of TV standards we take for granted today. If you notice most of Marine Boys enemies are eventually consumed by their evil. Marine Boy ever the gentle kid seldom if ever directly kills his enemies.  Marine Boy's enemies are so crazy for power and world domination that they often kill themselves or get caught up in their evil creations.  Bad guys that get away return to be fought later which is a good thing.

The best thing about Marine Boy's enemies is they are all funny in their extreme evil stereotypical natures. They lust for gold, power, resources, money, real estate or just the hearts and minds of the world. Marine Boy, his Dolphin Friend, His mermaid assistant and the good hardy men of the P1 together are the Marine Boy force.  I love how Marine Boys father Dr Mariner always reminds Marine Boy of the danger he faces yet allows him to go into dangers path.  He was some real faith in that indestructible suit he created for his sone to wear.  I always loved the P1 ship too, wish they made a model of it, I'd be a buyer for sure.  I've also always loved Dr. Fumble he is slick in his own way. Dr. Fumble always knows more than he lets on.  I like the almost Stan Laurel & Oliver hardy act put on by the crew of the P1 they are always good for a laugh but to the best of their ability they always have Marine Boys back as true honored friends.

If you already love the Marine Boy series you really don't need me to tell you to buy this awesome quality set.  If you never heard of Marine Boy hopefully what I share here will give you the desire to see the fun and frolics of Marine Boy the undersea super hero kid & his friends for yourself.  This is primative anime by todays standards but the morality tales Marine Boy tells are in their own ways timeless, awesome and most of all worthy of your attention.",1398038400,7,3061,4.330998248686515

8640688,5,B00IBKXT3G,"After I watched the first season, I saw the second and I was impressed by the amount of maturing the characters did in their second season! Marine Boy shows more daring and their is more humour with Splasher, especially when in one episode he talks!! Later he gives up speaking english when Proffessor Fumble's talking invention proves to be more trouble then it's worth!!

There is also an emphasis on James Bond action with the Undersea patrol and Marine Boy fighting it out against the bad guys with boomerang eleatric action!! This is very different from the black and white ASTROBOY adventures which I watched earlier! Those adventures had a Max Fleicher kind of feeling while these have a slicker, anime look to them!

Whether Marine Boy fights the villains of the sea or makes peace with Qui Qui and Neptina the mermaid(Connie Orr sounding like a younger version of Trixie, Speed Racer's girlfriend!) Marine Boy rates an additional star for it's second season! I'll buy it's third and final season!!",1409702400,5,1006,4.87719298245614
