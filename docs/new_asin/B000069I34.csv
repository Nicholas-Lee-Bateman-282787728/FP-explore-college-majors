7965896,5,B000069I34,The music and location are beautiful. Alanis's voice is pure and strong. I had this DVD and lost it. I'm so glad I was able to find it here!,1372464000,,140,3.8620689655172415
7965897,5,B000069I34,Wonderful Arizona backdrop for this multi-talented artist. Her style of music resonates with the primitive desert surroundings. Beautifully filmed and orchestrated-,1356739200,,164,6.857142857142857
7965898,4,B000069I34,Loved seeing Alanis perform in this natural setting. Having had visited these locations it was wonderful seeing them again with her and her band. I wish there had been additional 'scenes & interviews' included. What is filmed is repeated again in extra footage....a disappointment. If you are only interested in the music you will be pleased.,1220659200,,342,5.125
7965899,4,B000069I34,"I own several in the MIHP series, and while the production on all of them is excellent, I'm really disappointed in some of the titles that are not anamorphic.  This one IS letterbox, but require zooming in to fill a 16:9 set, which reduces the video quality greatly.  Thus, I give it 4 stars instead of 5.

See the Goo Goo Dolls or India Arie for a difference.

Love the tunes, though.",1134345600,,385,4.305555555555555
7965900,5,B000069I34,Was good to see Alanis in a more natural environment and experimenting. What will she come up with next?! I had seen snaps of this and just had to own it. Nature and Alanis just fit right in and you actually get to see her speak. I love it!,1128038400,,240,3.9183673469387754
7965901,4,B000069I34,It's okay. Much better than most other Alanis DVDs.,1116460800,,51,4.777777777777778
7965902,5,B000069I34,"The main reason i purchased this DVD was to see her perform 2 of her best songs... ""UR"" and ""I Was Hoping."" These unsung gems from her 2nd American release, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, are exquisitely performed against beautiful backdrops.",1081987200,,247,5.2
7965903,2,B000069I34,"You are a big fan of Alanis then you will certainly like this DVD. Do not expect exciting stuff. It's not really a documentary about Alanis but mostly about Indian culture and Great Canyon beauties. Alanis is here to sing some songs (UNPLUGGED) in the middle of mother nature in front nobody except the camera !!! She loves it but I wonder if it's really interesting. For sure, it really shows that Alanis must be a simple and kind person with a great talent. So if you like Alanis to death or Indians or great canyons, then this stuff is for you. I recommend Feast of Scraps if you really want great music and great documentary.",1074124800,,629,4.431034482758621
7965904,5,B000069I34,"I really enjoyed watching this DVD. It is great. Alanis is an amazing artist and this DVD shows just how great she can sound without the magic of a recording studio and production. The special features are cool, too. This DVD is pretty much an outdoor ""Unplugged"" concert, but without the audience. My favorites are ""Ironic"" ""Uninvited"" and ""Heart Of The House."" I really liked also that you learn history about the Navajo Indians as well as an Alanis treat. I learned a lot about the Natives and history of the different famous places that Alanis visited. The scenery was breath-taking and the music was spectacular. I wish she would've sang ""Hands Clean"" though. Otherwise this is a great DVD, one I will probably watch over and over endlessly! It is a must have for any Alanis Morissette fan or any fan of the ""Music In High Places"" series. It's great, you'll love it. I reccomend it to anyone! Enjoy!",1041033600,,904,4.65625
7965905,5,B000069I34,"Todo lo que hace ella es excelente, este DVD lo debe de tener cualquier fan de Alanis.",1039305600,,86,4.117647058823529
