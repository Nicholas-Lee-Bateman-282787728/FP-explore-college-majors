230531,4,630020992X,"""In Name Only"" is a poignant look at an unhappy marriage that provides Carole Lombard with arguably her finest non-comedy performance and film.  Based on the novel ""Memory of Love"" by Bessie Brewer, this 1939 film casts Lombard as Julie Eden, a young widow who rents a summer cottage in Connecticut near the estate of Alec Walker (Cary Grant).  The two have fallen in love and Alec wants to get a divorce from his wife, Maida (Kay Francis), who only married him for his position and money.  Maida appears to give in and promises to obtain a divorce in Paris, but when she returns after a long absence she announces that she will never divorce Alec and threatens to sue Julie for alienation of affection should Alec sue for divorce.  It looks like Julie and Alec will never life happily ever after, but that same night Alec develops a serious case of pneumonia.
It is rather surprising that this film is generally devoid of humor, given the two stars, but the subject matter does not lend itself to comedy.  When Julie and Alec talk about Reno, there is an overriding sense of melancholy, because the dream seems so far beyond their reach.  Talking about it is a way of keeping the dream alive, but the situation seems so hopeless.  True, this hopelessness seems alien to us, but the Walkers live in a world where reputation apparently matters more than money.  Lombard's performance is fascinating simply because she is doing a lot of what she does in her comedies, what with the bewildered look in her eyes and the melancholy voice, but now it works to evoke a sense of tragedy rather than farce.
Then there is Kay Francis as the manipulative Maida, an unpleasant character who presents herself as understanding and patient to Alec's parents (Charles Coburn and Nella Walker) as she tries to drive a wedge between them and their son in order to get her father-in-law's fortune.  Grant's character is the minor figure here, because what matters is the two women.  While Maida stretches out the trip to Europe, clearly intending for Julie to doubt Alec's resolve and to cause fatal cracks in their relationship, our focus is on Julie's face and what we can read about what she is thinking as her chances for happiness slip away.
The flaw in this film is the conclusion, although I do not know if the fault for this is with the original novel or Richard Sherman's screenplay.  But the ending because traditional Hollywood melodrama.  Alec is dying, but Julie, the only one that can give him the will to live, is not allowed to come to his bedside.  Then Maida shows up and is instructed by the script to suddenly snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and in the rush to provide a happy ending ""In Name Only"" throws away everything the two actresses had so successfully created until that point in the film.",1076371200,3,2805,4.642424242424243
230532,5,630020992X,"Cary Grant and Carole Lombard both broke out of their comic molds to make a very poignant romance, and the result was unforgettable movie magic. The plot quickly draws you in as the chillingly sinister Kay Francis seeks to thwart the happiness of lovers Grant and Lombard.
It's not just a story about good versus evil, however. This is also a movie about the battles that good people fight within themselves. Lombard convincingly struggles throughout the film with the realization that her love for Grant is going to break up his home. The film's resolution is very satisfying, very believable and undeniably romantic. You must see these two stars playing some of the best roles of their careers.",1029024000,29,696,4.906779661016949
230533,5,630020992X,"Generally, I am not a big fan of ""mushy romantic movies."" This, however, is one of the few romantic movies I really enjoy. It is very sweet, charming, and for the most part believable, mainly because of the great performances of the two stars, Cary Grant and Carole Lombard.
Essentially, In Name Only is the story of a debonair and wealthy man named Alec Walker(Cary Grant) stuck in a loveless marriage with a woman interested only in her husband's social position and money (Kay Francis, in another excellent performance). When he meets innocent and sweet Julie Eden (Carole Lombard), Alec decides to divorce his wife and remarry. The evil wife, however, has no intention of allowing her husband to leave her without money and influence.
Although this movie could easily have been too sentimental, it is saved by the wonderful performances of the stars. Ironically enough, Grant and Lombard, the greatest screwball comedians of the era, were only together in this one movie - which is a serious drama, not a screwball comedy. Still, Grant and Lombard's wit and talent shine through in this movie, and it is touching and at times quite funny. There are not many strictly romantic movies I would recommend, but this is one of them! It is good for the whole family. So, get this movie and discover a little known gem from 1939.",1026518400,56,1325,4.790393013100437
230534,4,630020992X,"An intelligent, funny and diverting little love triangle obviously filmed on a Grade ""A"" budget.  Kay Francis plays Maida, the heartless wife of Grant who married him for his money and social position.  The performances in this all but forgotten little 1939 gem are generally excellent with Lombard taking the acting honours.  Carole plays her role of Julie Eden in a refreshingly natural and unaffected way which was quite uncommon in the late thirties;  her performance still looks fresh today. As the mercenary Maida, Francis is more affected, but she had the ability to make one dislike her instensely;  hers is a typical thirties leading-lady performance.  Grant is his usual devil-may-care rascally self and there's really nothing surprising about him in this, however his comic timing is superb as usual.  As Maida's ""best friend"" Suzanne, the largely forgotten Helen Vinson is both funny and bitchy in an obvious yet amusing way.  The best scene has Kay admit to Carole that she's been conniving to get a huge settlement after Grant's Dad (the great Charles Coburn) passes away - however, she made a stupid blunder - she says this confession within Coburn's presence (which is unknown to her)  and he at last he realises what a witch his perfectly charming daughter-in-law really is!  Lombard's daughter is played by a very young Peggy Ann Garner and Carole's sister is played by a familiar actress - whose name escapes me - and she overacted in her histrionic playing.  The photography was beautiful and the quality of the VHS print was sharp and clear; even the musical score was engaging.  A harmless little movie which can give viewers some insight on the the dramatic side of the uniquely gifted Carole Lombard who was equally adept at Screwball comedies.  Clark Gable and Lombard were married the year this flick was made; she tragically died while going on a war bond tour (which was highly successful) when the airplane in which she and her mother were travelling in crashed into the side of of a mountain in either Nevada or the Sierra Nevadas in California. Gable was never the same after her death and kept seeking women who had the same qualities - in looks and character - as his beloved ""Ma"".  President Roosevelt gave her a heartfelt eulogy and the nation mourned for this beautiful, unaffected lady who died too young at 34. Lombard's last picture was arguably one of her best: TO BE OR NOT TO BE, a Lubitsch satire on the Nazis in which she co-starred with none other than Jack Benny (!)

The first few minutes has Carole Lombard standing waist deep in a stream, trying to fly fish. She does her usual comedy bit with the fishing rod when, suddenly, appears Cary Grant. So you're thinking, ""Okay, here comes the funny situation"", when, in fact, the film takes a sudden turn and becomes a melodrama.

If it weren't for the fact that ""Bringing Up Baby"" was considered a box office failure Katharine Hepburn would've been cast as instead.(Cary Grant) plays a rich man named Alec who's stuck in a loveless marriage to money loving vindictive wife Maida (Kay Francis) till one day he meets a kindhearted widow named Julie. (Carole Lombard)  When a friendship starts to blossom into more Maida will do anything to put an end to it, even use Julie's daughter if Alec won't walk away.
Great film for Carole Lombard fans, and Cary Grant fans since he has sense of humor but it's not a comedy it a romance or melodrama and o course there's no downplaying  Kay Francis she's wonderful in this as Maida the woman you love to hate. also starring Charles Coburn.",1436227200,4,802,4.601398601398602

230874,5,630020992X,"Alec Walker(Cary Grant) is unhappily married to ravishing but money grubbing Maida(Kay Francis).  The ice cold Maida married Alec only for his money and doesn't care that the love of her life committed suicide when she jilted him.  Alec meets and falls in love with beautiful young widow Julie Eden(Carole Lombard) who is as warm and loving as Maida is cold-blooded and grasping.  Their affair becomes a scandal and Alec's rather naive parents(Charles Coburn and Nella Walker), who have been won over by the conniving Maida, take Maida's side.  Alec demands a divorce and, being a gentleman, will let Maida file for it.  Maida agrees but with a stipulation:  she is going to spend the fall in Paris with Alec's parents and will file for it there so as not to become a ""gossip holiday for my friends"".  Alec, who is a bit naive himself, agrees, not suspecting Maida is going to double cross him.  Summer turns into winter and Alec and Julie learn from Maida's best friend Suzanne(Helen Vinson in a deliciously catty performance) that Maida never had any intention of divorcing him.  You guessed it:  in movies like this when all seems hopeless the hero always comes down with pneumoia at a big holiday and Alec does not escape his Hollywood ordained fate.  As Alec lies dying in the hospital on Christmas day his doctors tell Julie to lie to him and tell him that Maida has finally consented to a divorce.  The hope it gives him will ensure his survival.  Maida and Julie have it out at the hospital.  Maida tells Julie she doesn't want just Alec's money but his father's too.  Alec's parents overhear this and finally wise up.  Julie and Mr & Mrs Walker go into Alec's room and Maida is left alone outside.

1939 is considered Hollywood's greatest year.  This movie isn't one of the reasons why.  Not much of a plot, even by the standards of chick flicks.  What elevates ""In Name Only"" is the quietly intelligent direction of John Cromwell and the sophistication of the three leads.  Grant, Lombard, and Francis were masters of subtle power and all were at their peaks here.  Call it a ""weepie"", ""woman's pic"", or ""chick flick"" --  this is how it should be done, even if it isn't to be taken too seriously.

230959,5,630020992X,"I don't really know what I was expecting when I put on this film the other night.  I had never heard of the film before and I'm not essentially a gigantic fan of the film's lead actor.  Truth be told, Cary Grant is one of those actors I don't really `get'.  Much like his modern-day equivalent, George Clooney, I only adore Grant some of the time (`Bringing Up Baby', `North by Northwest' and `An Affair to Remember' spring instantly to mind).  In fact, the only thing that truly intrigued me about this film was the year in which it was made; 1939.  Beings that 1939 is often toted as the `Best Year in Cinema' I felt the need to see everything I could from it, and so I decided to sit down and watch this rather unknown film (at least to me) after it aired in TCM.

It is easily one of my favorite films from 1939; easily!

I was initially stunned that the film wasn't a comedy.  Grant has had his hand in a fair-share of romantic dramas as well, but for the most part I think of Grant as a comedic actor.  `In Name Only' is far from comedic though.  In fact, this film is one of Grant's darker and more mature films.  Despite the films melodramatic ending, which teeters on the farfetched, the film works marvelously.  In fact, even the ending works in spite of its saccharine overtones.  It's a forgivable `sign of the times' that is to be expected from films of that era.

The film follows a wealthy young man who falls for a beautiful widow.  The only hang-up is that this young man is currently married to a seemingly kind hearted woman who has gained the sympathies of friends and family thanks to her husband's apparent indiscretions.  The ugly truth though, is that this `kind hearted' wife is nothing more than a manipulative gold digger who will do anything in her power to maintain the control in her `relationship'.

The development of the key relationships presented here is phenomenal.  You really get the warmth and sweet aspects of the budding romance between Grant's Alec and Lombard's Julie and you also get the cold calculation that passes between Alec and Francis's Maida.  All three stars shine very brightly here, the females definitely duking it out for your attention.  In the end, it was Kay Francis that struck me the hardest, like a cold slap in the face.  She manipulates the audience in the same manner that she manipulates Alec's parents (in the films first few frames I actually thought her to be the `suffering' spouse).

In the end, `In Name Only' is certainly a treat; a gem of a film that NEEDS a proper DVD release!",1300320000,6,2553,4.492407809110629
230960,5,630020992X,"Just rewatched this movie for the gazillionth time and am starting to worry that my vhs copy (which still produces a sharp image) is going to die from blatant overuse.
An uncharacteristic drama for the usually comedic (at this point in their careers) Grant and Lombard. Carole and Cary shine in this one as two star-crossed lovers facing an uncertain future due to complications caused by Grant's estranged wife aptly played by the wonderfully cold and calculating Kay Francis. Added to the mix is cute little Peggy Ann Garner as the widowed Lombard's daughter and a hard-nosed Edward Arnold as Grant's domineering and rigid father. The plot is by all accounts 30's melodrama, but the acting and direction makes this movie a standout. The principal actors play their parts with such earnest conviction (and good dialogue) that it left this viewer feeling as though I was evesdropping rather than watching a movie.
I'm a Carole Lombard fan and also have a soft spot for virually everyone featured in this movie. Lombard was never lovelier and she and Grant had incredible chemistry in this movie. It is a wonderful example of great film making without technical tricks and special effects.
My only gripe and concern: WHEN IS SOMEONE GOING TO PUT THIS ON DVD?",1276214400,5,1257,4.906103286384977

230962,5,630020992X,"*Sept 2011 update- Finally, it's coming out on DVD!! There is a God!! I won't have to look at the DVR copy from TCM I recorded two years ago.
This is one of the best from its time.  Pure melodrama.  Grant, Lombard and Francis are in their prime here.  It is interesting to see how our world viewed marriage and relationships in this era, the late 1930's.  The storyline for its time was basic.  Man is in a bad marriage (why do these people get together in the first place?). Man meets the right girl but current wife has other plans (his money and his name).  Current wife plays every card to stop true love (can't a woman take a hint?  He doesn't want you!).  Turn of events (usually a tragedy) trips up current wife and destined couple come together.
I just wish that this would come to DVD.  I would love to see how this could be remade but given Hollywood's penchant to completely miss the mark on these things, maybe it would be best that it be left alone.  Besides I really don't want to see George Clooney leave Catherine Zeta-Jones for Jennifer Aniston. Do you?",1141948800,10,1070,4.358585858585859
230963,4,630020992X,"""In Name Only"" is a poignant look at an unhappy marriage that provides Carole Lombard with arguably her finest non-comedy performance and film. Based on the novel ""Memory of Love"" by Bessie Brewer, this 1939 film casts Lombard as Julie Eden, a young widow who rents a summer cottage in Connecticut near the estate of Alec Walker (Cary Grant). The two have fallen in love and Alec wants to get a divorce from his wife, Maida (Kay Francis), who only married him for his position and money. Maida appears to give in and promises to obtain a divorce in Paris, but when she returns after a long absence she announces that she will never divorce Alec and threatens to sue Julie for alienation of affection should Alec sue for divorce. It looks like Julie and Alec will never life happily ever after, but that same night Alec develops a serious case of pneumonia.

It is rather surprising that this film is generally devoid of humor, given the two stars, but the subject matter does not lend itself to comedy. When Julie and Alec talk about Reno, there is an overriding sense of melancholy, because the dream seems so far beyond their reach. Talking about it is a way of keeping the dream alive, but the situation seems so hopeless. True, this hopelessness seems alien to us, but the Walkers live in a world where reputation apparently matters more than money. Lombard's performance is fascinating simply because she is doing a lot of what she does in her comedies, what with the bewildered look in her eyes and the melancholy voice, but now it works to evoke a sense of tragedy rather than farce.

Then there is Kay Francis as the manipulative Maida, an unpleasant character who presents herself as understanding and patient to Alec's parents (Charles Coburn and Nella Walker) as she tries to drive a wedge between them and their son in order to get her father-in-law's fortune. Grant's character is the minor figure here, because what matters is the two women. While Maida stretches out the trip to Europe, clearly intending for Julie to doubt Alec's resolve and to cause fatal cracks in their relationship, our focus is on Julie's face and what we can read about what she is thinking as her chances for happiness slip away.

The flaw in this film is the conclusion, although I do not know if the fault for this is with the original novel or Richard Sherman's screenplay. But the ending because traditional Hollywood melodrama. Alec is dying, but Julie, the only one that can give him the will to live, is not allowed to come to his bedside. Then Maida shows up and is instructed by the script to suddenly snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and in the rush to provide a happy ending ""In Name Only"" throws away everything the two actresses had so successfully created until that point in the film.",1135641600,8,2795,4.642424242424243

This movie is a romance drama, and I think that both Cary and Carole did a good job. The storyline was well done and believable. Kay Francis co-starred as the conniving, gold-digging wife of Cary who tries to thwart the love of Cary and Carole. In the end though, Kay's character gets her just do.

The imagery and cinematography was crisp and the lighting was very good.

This is not a movie that one sees on a usual basis (on tv or in the video stores), so this would be a nice addition to your classic movie collection at home.",1119916800,13,720,4.240875912408759
230967,5,630020992X,"This is one of the most subtly performed dramas of the ""classic golden era"" I have ever seen in my life. The three leads: Cary Grant, Carole Lombard and Kay Francis are truly magnificent in their respective roles, giving supreme, skilled, understated performances.

This involving film tells the story of the beautiful love that is born and developed, between fashion designer & widowed Carole Lombard and rich, unhappily married, Cary Grant, and how the principal ""obstacle"" in their path, Grant's selfish wife, played by Kay Francis, tries to destroy this strong bond, not for the love of her husband, but because she won't give up the money and social position that this marriage grants her. Francis plays one of the ""least apparent"" villainess ever, manipulating everyone, especially her in-laws, for her own sake.

This is classic romantic drama at its best, released in that glorious year of 1939, in which Grant and especially Lombard, achieve top-dramatic performances. This film, like the magnificent 1941 Penny Serenade, really demonstrates the acting range of Cary Grant as a dramatic actor. On the other hand, if you liked Carole Lombard in 1939's ""Made for Each Other"" with Jimmy Stewart, you'll love her here.

It is sad that this was Lombard's and Grant's only romantic pairing, because they've got great chemistry. They had previously acted together in two films: ""Sinners in the Sun""(1932) and ""The Eagle and the Hawk"" (1933), but in the former Grant had a small role and in the latter, both stars hadn't scenes together.",1101340800,7,1538,5.071146245059288
