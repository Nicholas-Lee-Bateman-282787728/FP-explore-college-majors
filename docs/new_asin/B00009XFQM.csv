I can see why all the reviews have been 5 stars.  Now I wish I had the the ""full"" Vegas Editor and time-line envelopes and scripting.  A great, great Workshop.

Go buy this set!",1079136000,3,277,3.793103448275862

It's a great value as you can watch them over and over again and still pick up new stuff.  Can't wait for the next set.",1063065600,5,305,3.75
