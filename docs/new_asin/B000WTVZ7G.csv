8325860,3,B000WTVZ7G,"As a first video for infants, this video would be valuable. If children imitate the sounds they hear, they will catch on to speaking some of their first words. If the child is used to videos that are lively, full of music and dance, it may not capture and hold their attention. I would suggest playing the video while the child is engaged in active play so that the child will hear and imitate the sounds without really focusing and will attend to the parts they find interesting.",1377388800,,480,4.465909090909091
8325861,5,B000WTVZ7G,"I have been using this DVD for my daughter since she was 6 months old. It was a real value for money, though I got it at a discounted price. She has picked so much of words from this video and yeah,she did pick up the accent as well!! Everytime I play it, I sit with my daughter and repeat the words for her and explain about it. She is 18 months now and she almost utters half of the visuals even before she hears it. I think it was a great buy for her!!",1256601600,,455,3.8
