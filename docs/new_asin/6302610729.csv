7829438,5,6302610729,"Coming of Age or......The Horrendous Psyche Test at the Academy
Another Wesley Crusher episode.  In this one we get to see him as a finalist at Starfleet Academy.  He meets other students his age and discovers he's not the only one who couldn't fit in.  He meets a Benzite called Mordock; who proves to help him with insider info on the test.  Wes and his other classmates take the infamous psyche test.  It means facing your greatest fear in the holodeck simulation.  He follows his instincts and meets the test with unexpected bravery.  I wish that the Crusher character was given more episodes like this.  It would have been better if the writers took him through the academy instead of turning him into another time traveler entity.
The writing staff never followed up on this concept.  What happened to Wes other than him becoming one of those hocus-pocus magical Q-like entities?  The more I think of this episode; the more I say the right direction for his character would be for him to become a commander like his mentor Picard or a research doctor or scientist like his Mom.
The B story in this one is when Remmick starts poking his nose aboard the ship; he discovers Picard is a much better captain than expected. He convinces another friend of Wes's not to run away from his problems.  We also discover that Picard was not successful after the first attempt on his Starfleet entrance exams.
The B story with Remmick jump-started what could have been an otherwise slow moving episode.  It's too bad they killed him off in the ""Conspiracy"" episode.  He played a good devils advocate and would have been a good foil for Picard when starship inspections came up.",980208000,,1669,4.694158075601375
