3066151,5,B0011KQSWM,"Besides 'charmed' and '227', this is my other favourite tv show!... Not the original Law & Order, Criminal Intent, Trial By Jury. SVU is Riveting! Edge-Of -Your-Seat Entertainment! But u got to watch it from the first ever episode, and do not talk, or go to bathroom breaks, switch ur phones off!... With these type of shows, u need full concentration. Only then u will feel it! Trust me!....",1207872000,4,392,4.695652173913044
3066152,5,B0011KQSWM,"SVU recreated the spin-off, this is a parallel series to the war horse Law & Order.  The only character in common between the shows is the peripheral character of Captain Cragen (Dan Florek) who commands the squad (as he did in L&O) but he is not a main character, more like a sounding board for the other character to come to.

This series focal point has always been Detives Stabler and Benson (the incredible Christopher Meloni and Mariska Hargitay) with Detectives Munch and Tutuola (Richard Belzer and Ice-T) as the back-up detectives.  B.D. Wong returns as the forensic psychologist and Diane Neal comes back for a second season as the departments ADA.

This season has the following 23 episodes:

Birthright - A kidnapping uncovers a scandal at a fertility clinic (probably inspired by the UCI scandal). Future Oscar Nominee Abigail Breslin and Lea Thompson guest.

Debt - The investigation of a disappearance of a mother and daughter lead to illegal immigration and forced prostitution. Ming-Na and James Hong guest.

Outcry - When a teenage girl is found beaten and tied up who raped her, college students as she stated, her stepfather who Benson believes or some one else. Blair Brown and Michael O'Keefe guest.

Conscience - Detectives get played by the murder suspect and then by the victim's father. Peter Reigert, Kyle McLachlan and Novella Nelson guest.

Charisma - A cult is protecting their leader a serial con artist and forger who has turned to murder and pediophilia. Another China Beach Alum, Jeff Kober guests.

Doubt - It's a he said, she said rape investigation.  Benson initially taking the girl's side and Stabler the professor's side.  But as the investigation proceeds, they both change their opinions. Bill Campbell and Mariette Hartley guest.

Weak - After a fight with Stabler, Benson turns to a former officer, now a psychiatrist, to help solve the serial rape of disabled women. Amanda Plummer and Mary Stuart Masterson guest.  (This episode won SVU its first Emmy)

Haunted - Fin is reunited with his son while saving two other children.

Contagious - When a girl is examined after a car crash, it is discovered that she had been molested.  Out of fear she blames her soccer coach and this snowballs when other team members also accuse him. Daniel Hugh Kelly guests.

Identity - The investigation of the death a gang member who fell off a building takes a strange twist when a tagger confesses but the physical evidence points elsewhere. Charlyne Woodard and Peter Firth guest.

Quarry - When the body of a seven year old boy is found, the team tries to link it to a convicted serial killer. John Savage guests.

Game - The grisly murder is blamed on a video game. Barry Bostwick guests.

Hooked - The body of a girl is found with her older cousin's ID.  It turns out that she had an online hookup with an older man.  But he too is found dead.

Ghost - Alex Cabot returns to testify against the drug dealer who sent her into hiding. Stephanie March returns.

Rage - Stabler gets a second chance to nail a child molster but will his hatred blow the case? Matthew Modine and Anne Pitoniak guest.

Intoxicated - A statutory rape charge results in murder of the mother. Cathy Moriarity and Glenne Headley guests.

Night - When a young woman is found raped and dead, the trail leads to a leading family.  This is a crossover episode with L&O: Trial by Jury.  Angela Lansbury, Alfred Molina guest. With crossover guests Bebe Neuwirth, Kirk Acevedo and Rita Moreno. (This creates another Oz reunion with Meloni.)

Blood - A baby is tossed out of a car window. During the investigation, Benson and Stabler link it to drug dealer who turns up dead. (A side story Stabler intercedes when his daughter is picked up for drunk driving.  This will haunt him later in the series.) Melinda Dillion guests.

Parts - A woman's head is found in a junkyard.  Oscar winner Marlee Matlin guests.

3066387,1,B0011KQSWM,I just can't believe that Amazon would offer this product to it's faithful customers.  Just played the 1st disc of this season and it froze in several different spots.  The labeling of each disc is peeling off.  Doesn't Amazon have any quality control on the products they sell to the public.  Now the consumer has to go through the process of returning and because it has been paid for in advance they have to wait for a credit.  Poor business practice on the part of Amazon subjecting their customers to poor quality products. I don't blame the supplier put the blame on Amazon where it belongs for not looking out for their customers. I just read other reviews on this DVD with the same complaint and yet Amazon continues to offer this product to its valued customers.  As a business owner I would have dropped this supplier immediately.  This DVD was supposed to be Brand New but you would never know it from the appearance of the discs.,1368662400,2,941,4.565476190476191

So far I have had a couple ""freezes"" but I am so unsure what to do because obviously the manufacturer of this season sucks. One would think that those making these would catch on with all the returns. I have sent the first 2 back and debating on this set.

3066416,4,B0011KQSWM,"Law and Order SVU Season Six is exactly what the title says.  The 6th season in a very popular television series.  And even though it's the sixth season, I would say that you could probably watch this without watching any of the other seasons.  But why would you want to?  Even if there isn't a ton of backstory, there's still some, and it's always better to start at the beginning.

Law and Order SVU deals with the tougher crimes in NYC.  Those crimes that involve rape, the elderly, and children.  So often they are the saddest and toughest to watch.  But thanks to a spectacular cast, these episodes aren't as dreary and devoid of human compassion as they could be.  Instead of glorifying these crimes, they instead support a sense of justice, and a want to prevent the heinous crimes.  For plot, there wasn't a lot of continuing story from the other seasons in this one, although Stabler's family did come into a few episodes, but largely these were one off episodes.  As such, they were complete on their own and most of them were very interesting and well done.  ""Birthright"" was almost devastating in the choices that family has to make, especially with the law not being caught up to technology.  ""Doubt"" made the viewer decide who was telling the truth between accuser and accused, and made you think of the reasons why you came to that conclusion.  And ""Goliath"" has the team taking on the US Army.  I can't really think of any episodes I didn't like in this season.  Sure there were a few that were just so-so and not standouts, but largely it kept me watching.

Characters:
Christopher Meloni: Elliot Stabler
Mariska Hargitay: Olivia Benson
Richard Belzer: John Munch
Stephanie March, Alexandra Cabot
Diane Neal: Casey Novak
Ice-T: Fin Tutuola
B.D. Wong: George Huang
Dann Florek: Don Cragen

I still have to say I prefer March to Neal as far as ADAs go.  But in her own way, Casey Novak is an intriguing character.  More brash, and not as sophisticated as Cabot, she gets the job done, but learns a lot in all of the episodes.  Meloni and Hargitay were their usual great selves, and as always, still got more airtime than Belzer and Ice-T.  Although I was happy to see that those two were involved a little more in this season.  Florek though, while making token appearances, didn't get involved in too many of these episodes.  The same goes for Wong.  The bad guys once again were varied and it was hard to tell where your sympathies lie when the whole story is given.  There is a lot to think about anyway when judging these people.

Because of the brutal and hard topics this series covers, it may not be for everyone.  It all depends on what you're comfortable with, and what you're comfortable having your children watch.  There is violence, blood, sexual content, and a whole lot of other things that can be tough.  And the camera doesn't shy away from a lot of it.  Even though the filming is mainly done following the detectives around, it still does show the bodies and other evidence that is used in investigating a crime.

But in summary, this is a good season.  It keeps things fresh but still maintains that compassion and want to spread knowledge about these topics.  And with the great cast of actors, it's no surprise that this is a long lived series.

3066504,5,B0011KQSWM,"This is a great series and has remained so. This is an offshoot of the original Law and Order series. This series focuses on sexual crimes, normally not dealt with on television. The main crimes are rape, child molestation, and everything in between. I am very glad the Law and Order series decided to tackle this once taboo topic and I believe this series has helped open the discussion of rape and sexual abuse which is one of the reasons why I love this series so much.

The acting is great, the plots are amazing and draw in you from the first ""dum dum"". Since it deals with sensitive subject matter, the episodes may not be appropriate for all viewers. There is high replayability with these episodes which is why it is worth the purchase. If you enjoy crime dramas, especially crime dramas that help open debate and deal with taboo topics, then this is the show for you. I guarentee you will enjoy it.",1228867200,2,907,4.496969696969697

3300884,1,B0011KQSWM,I just can't believe that Amazon would offer this product to it's faithful customers.  Just played the 1st disc of this season and it froze in several different spots.  The labeling of each disc is peeling off.  Doesn't Amazon have any quality control on the products they sell to the public.  Now the consumer has to go through the process of returning and because it has been paid for in advance they have to wait for a credit.  Poor business practice on the part of Amazon subjecting their customers to poor quality products. I don't blame the supplier put the blame on Amazon where it belongs for not looking out for their customers. I just read other reviews on this DVD with the same complaint and yet Amazon continues to offer this product to its valued customers.  As a business owner I would have dropped this supplier immediately.  This DVD was supposed to be Brand New but you would never know it from the appearance of the discs.,1368662400,2,941,4.565476190476191

So far I have had a couple ""freezes"" but I am so unsure what to do because obviously the manufacturer of this season sucks. One would think that those making these would catch on with all the returns. I have sent the first 2 back and debating on this set.

3300892,5,B0011KQSWM,this show is exhilerating...always keeps you on edge with the story lines and characters.  the good guys don't always win. sometimes the bad guys win.,1356566400,,150,5.0
3300913,4,B0011KQSWM,"Law and Order SVU Season Six is exactly what the title says.  The 6th season in a very popular television series.  And even though it's the sixth season, I would say that you could probably watch this without watching any of the other seasons.  But why would you want to?  Even if there isn't a ton of backstory, there's still some, and it's always better to start at the beginning.

Law and Order SVU deals with the tougher crimes in NYC.  Those crimes that involve rape, the elderly, and children.  So often they are the saddest and toughest to watch.  But thanks to a spectacular cast, these episodes aren't as dreary and devoid of human compassion as they could be.  Instead of glorifying these crimes, they instead support a sense of justice, and a want to prevent the heinous crimes.  For plot, there wasn't a lot of continuing story from the other seasons in this one, although Stabler's family did come into a few episodes, but largely these were one off episodes.  As such, they were complete on their own and most of them were very interesting and well done.  ""Birthright"" was almost devastating in the choices that family has to make, especially with the law not being caught up to technology.  ""Doubt"" made the viewer decide who was telling the truth between accuser and accused, and made you think of the reasons why you came to that conclusion.  And ""Goliath"" has the team taking on the US Army.  I can't really think of any episodes I didn't like in this season.  Sure there were a few that were just so-so and not standouts, but largely it kept me watching.

Characters:
Christopher Meloni: Elliot Stabler
Mariska Hargitay: Olivia Benson
Richard Belzer: John Munch
Stephanie March, Alexandra Cabot
Diane Neal: Casey Novak
Ice-T: Fin Tutuola
B.D. Wong: George Huang
Dann Florek: Don Cragen

I still have to say I prefer March to Neal as far as ADAs go.  But in her own way, Casey Novak is an intriguing character.  More brash, and not as sophisticated as Cabot, she gets the job done, but learns a lot in all of the episodes.  Meloni and Hargitay were their usual great selves, and as always, still got more airtime than Belzer and Ice-T.  Although I was happy to see that those two were involved a little more in this season.  Florek though, while making token appearances, didn't get involved in too many of these episodes.  The same goes for Wong.  The bad guys once again were varied and it was hard to tell where your sympathies lie when the whole story is given.  There is a lot to think about anyway when judging these people.

Because of the brutal and hard topics this series covers, it may not be for everyone.  It all depends on what you're comfortable with, and what you're comfortable having your children watch.  There is violence, blood, sexual content, and a whole lot of other things that can be tough.  And the camera doesn't shy away from a lot of it.  Even though the filming is mainly done following the detectives around, it still does show the bodies and other evidence that is used in investigating a crime.

But in summary, this is a good season.  It keeps things fresh but still maintains that compassion and want to spread knowledge about these topics.  And with the great cast of actors, it's no surprise that this is a long lived series.

Well when I got it it was still in the factory seal but the DVD's look used they were scratched plus the ""picture"" on the DVD's are not right the way they are printed on the DVD's right along with the scratches plus it looks like the paint or what ever they use to put the picture on looks like it got wet.  It's hard to discribe but I am just hoping these are not copies!!!!!  Anyway they did come ontime I think they came even a day early .  Oh and one of the episodes stops in the middle of it and goes back to the beginning.  You never get to see the end.  I know I only paid 11 dollar for this season so I guess I got what I paid for.

I bought it because I want to pass it on and because I am tired of endless commercials breaking up the story: 2 minutes of show and 3 of commercials is not my idea of entertainment. Now I can enjoy a full hour of real viewing.  When my collection of DVD is complete, I will kiss those TV fees goodbye.",1262995200,,444,3.933333333333333

3301000,5,B0011KQSWM,Law and Order SVU is one of the gest shows on TV today.  The two main characters interact so well together along with the other supporting cast.  Together they make the best Law and Order series on TV today.  I would recommend it to anyone that enjoy this type of show.  Season 6 stays on the same level as all of the other seasons.  Fantastic!,1234742400,,344,4.230769230769231
3301001,5,B0011KQSWM,"This is a great series and has remained so. This is an offshoot of the original Law and Order series. This series focuses on sexual crimes, normally not dealt with on television. The main crimes are rape, child molestation, and everything in between. I am very glad the Law and Order series decided to tackle this once taboo topic and I believe this series has helped open the discussion of rape and sexual abuse which is one of the reasons why I love this series so much.

The acting is great, the plots are amazing and draw in you from the first ""dum dum"". Since it deals with sensitive subject matter, the episodes may not be appropriate for all viewers. There is high replayability with these episodes which is why it is worth the purchase. If you enjoy crime dramas, especially crime dramas that help open debate and deal with taboo topics, then this is the show for you. I guarentee you will enjoy it.",1228867200,2,907,4.496969696969697
