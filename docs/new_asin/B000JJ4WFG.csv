8150547,5,B000JJ4WFG,"FMP TSR is the 3rd season of FMP. It follows FMP, and FMP Fumoffu. The animation quality is way better in this season than in the previous 2. All of the characters return and so do the Arm Slaves. The AS's are even more awesome in TSR. The voice actors are all the same and the music is still great. My only complaint is that the ending leaves you hanging really bad. It pretty much ends with all sorts of bad guys ready to pounce and the team of the TDD ready to take them on. I loved this series but was very disappointed by the ending. Ive been waiting for them to end it for years, but no luck. I still have hope though. Even though it's not resolved this anime is incredible. You should definitely give it a look see.",1353888000,,722,4.091549295774648
8150548,5,B000JJ4WFG,"I really loved FMP season one, but The Second Raid improved on what was already great. Needless to say, i love this series and cant wait for another season. Highly recommended.",1211414400,,176,4.709677419354839
8150549,4,B000JJ4WFG,this is a must have for any full metal panic fans. the down side is that it's only 3 episodes and it's diffently hard to understand nearly anything if you've never seen full metal panic before.... however to counter that would be to simply state that this is the 2nd seasion! get back to the first seasion and be wowed there!,1179792000,,325,4.344262295081967
8150550,5,B000JJ4WFG,"What can I say this anime is one fun ride.  Full Metal Panic is one show that has everything you want: action, drama, love, comedy all wrapped into one anime.  I am not sure how they do it but they do it so well.

  I love the two main characters Kanami and Sousuke.  They are strong characters that you can't help but love them in action.

  Story is well done.  Beautiful animation.  Some funny stories.  Some action pack stories.

  I hope there is a fourth season for this show.",1178841600,,482,4.258426966292135
8150551,5,B000JJ4WFG,"Still the best high school comedy/mech anime out there. This last volume of The Second Raid is definitely a fitting way to end this arc, but it also leaves the door open for more FMP.  If you haven't seen the first Full Metal Panic things might be a little confusing, and I would definitely recommend watching it on Youtube or something, but they do a pretty good job with flashbacks and getting you up to speed on the older characters. If you have seen the whole series than you'll definitely enjoy volume 4 of TSR. So to all the die hard FMP fans: definitely pick up volume 4, and keep your fingers crossed that another series is released soon because a world without FMP is certainly no world at all.",1178323200,,703,4.407692307692308
8150552,5,B000JJ4WFG,"I don't often write reviews or opinions, outside of myspace of course, but i just finished Tactical Ops 4 and i am left disappointed...THAT IT'S OVER!! This is my opinion, I have grown to love this series more than any other in my meager collection and i fell a great sense of lose at the fact that this is over. All of the characters is this entirely too short series are so well thought out that i believe that anyone would be hard pressed to find another anime with more character depth (again my biased opinion). Well....if i don't stop myself there i will spend too much time writing something that you will probably skim, so i will leave it at this: BUT THIS SERIES!!",1177977600,,673,4.392
8150553,5,B000JJ4WFG,"Having watched the entire FMP series, and I mean all of it (FMP, FMP fumaffou - sorry for the misspelling - and FMP the second raid), I shall present to the reader the following review scheme:

- A complete story outline of FMP the second raid, something that I also did in the last three volumes, but SPOILERS WILL BE INCLUDED!!! (Therefore, if you are not familiar with the series, skip this section or otherwise, everything will be given away to you. If you have not watched the final volume of the series than avoid the last part of the story outline or otherwise you will know how the show ends).
- Extras of the DVDs
- An overall opinion of all three FMP series so that for someone who just comes across these series to grasp a complete picture of it (as much as this is possible of course); and finally,
- Buying it or not? And if yes, how to buy it!

STORY OUTLINE (SPOILERS INCLUDED):
First of all, the story starts where the first season ended (with a few `modifications' made). The anime begins with Mithril being involved in military attacks in the Baltic region while its leader has acquired advanced weaponry technology anti-ECS missile (missile able to detect systems with ECS invisibility). In order to protect hellicopters filled with refuges Sousuke must use the the Arbalest's Lambda Driver, which he still tries to learn how to control. Later on, the viewer will be introduced to the main villain of the series, Gates, who is a member of an organization called Amalgam and basically opposes Mithril and was the one which provided the leader of the Baltic nation with the advanced weaponry. We are also introduced to Xia Yu Fan and Xia Yu Lan, twin sisters who we later learn were raised by Gauron.
After a school side-story, the next mission takes us to Nanjiing, so that Mithri can safe hostages. There, Mao wil hide between the hostages by pretending she is one of them, will have to fight against Xia Yu Lan; Kurz Weber (who is piloting the only Zy-98 Shadow-type Arm Slave in the battle) will have to fight against Xia Yu Fan and Sousuke (who asked to take a M9 instead of Arbalest was denied because he is the only one who can operate the Arbalest and the Lambda Driver) will be left alone with the unreliable Lambda driver to deal with Gates, who is operating a Venom-type Arm Slave. During this battles we will also witness some betray going on (sorry guys, if I say more I will take the suspense away).

Yet, we should also not forget that a love-story between the two main protagonists is going on which will become apparent during Sousuke's constant absences from school and that Kaname becomes worried about him in many aspects; while Mao will start to worry about him as well. Sousuke, starts to reflect upon his own feelings about Kaname and would prefer to remain a student by her side instead of being a soldier etc. Furthermore, and going through various `misinterpretations' that Sousuke Sagara usually does, Kaname and him get closer and he realizes how much Kaname is depending on him. The specific episode ends when Sousuke (who is beginning to realize his feelings for Kaname) is ordered to withdraw from guarding Kaname immediately, with all guard duties being entrusted to another agent, codenamed ""Wraith.""
After being called back, Sousuke falls into a slight depression, not wanting to pilot the Arbalest and wishing he were back at Jindai High. We are introduced to the new Uruz-1, Lieutenant Belfangan Groseaux. He tests Sousuke's ability with the Arbalest, a test Sousuke fails miserably. Meanwhile Kaname is becoming increasingly suspicious that someone is following her. She discovers that Sousuke has left for good and realizes she is now completely alone. She decides to find out who is following her, and through a series of events discovers Wraith, who informs her that aside from himself, someone else seems to be following her. We discover this person is Xia Yu Lan, the younger twin. She shoots Wraith and then attacks Kaname. Kaname escapes, but is pursued and manages to surprise Yu Lan and shoot her with a Taser. After this she is met by Leonard Testarossa, Tessa's brother and a fellow Whispered. He is an agent of Amalgam and has orders to kill Yu Lan. He orders one of his bodyguards (a miniature AS unit) to kill her. When this is done he expresses that he seems to have fallen in love with Kaname and steals her first kiss, which infuriates her. In exchange for her forgiveness, Leonard allows her to take back Wraith who seems to still be alive.
To make the long story short the viewer will follow the Mithril team to another mission, this time in Hong Kong, in which power games and betrays will go on and someone is piloting an AS unit eqiuped with a Lamda Driver as well. In terms of `performance' Sousuke will hit rock bottom and fails completely because he cannot concentrate due to reoccurring thoughts of Kaname. These distraction eventually cause him to crash the vehicle he is driving. Mao tells him she won't work with him unless he can focus. Sousuke realizes he can't and abandons the mission. Meanwhile tensions between North and South China force Mithril to order an assault on the enemy AS before it is found. While they battle the AS, Sousuke wanders through Hong Kong, eventually meeting a Chinese Woman who resembles Chidori. He goes with her to her apartment, most likely to have sex, but due to her appearance thoughts of Chidori constantly fill his mind; (don't worry, He decides to leave) ending up wandering in the streets and meets an old enemy who amongst other things tells him that Kaname died. Sousuke kills him, this time for good. Meanwhile, Mithril is in great need of Sousuke and Tessa orders that Sousuke is been send the Arbalest so that he can rejoin the team and defeat the enemy; but, his will to fight is gone. Without Kaname he is lost.
As Sousuke tries to leave he is confronted with Kaname, who used Wraith to find Sousuke. After beating him up she tells him he needs to pilot the Arbalest and save everyone. Feeling renewed confidence at seeing Kaname alive Souske finally realizes that he is the only one who can pilot the Arbalest and works together with the Al to fully make use of the Lambda Driver.
The final episode, is basically the climax of the show and when the main villain is about to kill everyone Sousuke arrives just in time, makes full use of the Lamda Drive and saves everyone.
The Second Raid ends with Sousuke finally understanding what he wants to do with his life: Pilot the Arbalest for Mithril and attend school with Kaname. He works out a deal with Mithril that allows him to do just that. We are left with both Kaname and Sousuke having realized their feelings for each other, but neither of them being able to admit it.

Extras of the DVDs: Well, because I bought these DVDs separately and a box-set is not out yet, I can speak of what comes along with the separate DVDs that a potential buyer will get. All four DVDs come along with a small booklet that gives you additional information of various characters that appear in the show, of various missions, of Mecha types or circumstances, like, why China is divided in two regions. Besides it, another booklet is included in the DVDs that basically advertise other anime shows that are out there and that you can buy. As far as the DVDs extras concerns, well, other anime previews, some character drawings (I think that is how it is called), some interviews with the creators of the shows, non-credit opening and ending etc. and the first three have previous of the next episode to come; basically, nothing special.
The dub and sub are perfectly down (therefore, if you prefer the English version you are lucky) as is the animation. As for the opening and ending songs they are similar - I am referring to the music - to the ones that you already know from the first and second FMP.

OVERALL OPINION:
 OK, for simplicity reasons I will call the series FMP 1, FMP 2 and FMP 3 (which stands for FMP the second raid) accordingly.
FMP 1 starts off with a pattern very well known to the anime viewers, especially when it comes down to Mechas (giant robots etc.), which is: good vs. bad guy, love triangles (FMP 3 has actually a love quadangle, man my English is bad, well you get the picture), high school students with special powers and sometimes serious issues, action, people die etc. So, what makes FMP different at all? Well, in my humble opinion I cannot provide you with a clear cut explanation but for some reason the chemistry in these series works perfectly and differentiates FMP from the rest of its genre. It does indeed have something for everyone, from comedy - or should I say, slapstick comedy - to drama, twists in the scenarios (especially FMP 1 and FMP 3), fan service and a lot of slapstick comedy (especially FMP 2) and so forth.
In other words: FMP 1 keeps a balance between hardcore action, romance and comedy and on character development. FMP 2 concentrates more on the everyday life of the high school students, to the development of the feelings that the love triangle share with each other and on slapstick comedy. FMP 3 on the other hand, gets straight to the point (only 13 episodes long). In all three shows the action and how the mechas spread out or fight is professionally done as in real circumstances. I do not know if the creators had planned to develop like this FMP from day one but if you start watching FMP 3, there, it is assumed that you are familiar with the main characters and of what is basically going on (let us say, the Lamda drive of the Arbalest).
Now, because I have posted this review in FMP the second raid, volume 4, a few words about these specific four volumes. FMP the second raid is a very good series and I do highly recommend it to everyone. Here, everything will be tested: How strong is Kaname's and Sousuke's (but spoken like Soske) love? How will Mithril fight against corruption amongst its own ranks and Amalgam? How will the team make it? Can Kaname fight back without Sousuke by her side and can she save him? What will Sousuke decide to do and can he safe them? Well, in the end, all of these questions and more will be answered. FMP 3 is packed with action, romance and emotions all over the way. Furthermore, because of the circumstances that the main protagonists are encountering and probably because of its `short length' it remains almost serious through the entire series and there are no filler episodes at all; meaning, that every episode advances the show straight to the final confrontation.

Buying it or not? And if yes, how to buy it:
 My personal recommendation would be to buy it. However, buying all three FMP may be a little bit expensive for everyone; especially for anime fans like me who sometimes cannot wait and buy the DVDs as soon as they come out. Lucky you, specifically the ones who just stumbled upon these shows, FMP 1 and FMP 2 are already available in Box Sets and compared in buying them separately, will be cheaper. Therefore, buy the Box Sets of FMP 1 and FMP 2 and not the DVDs separately. As for FMP the second raid, if you haven't bought any volume yet, then wait a couple months and it should come out in a Box Set as well (something that usually happens with all shows). If on the other hand you have already started to buy the DVDs separately probably means that you are familiar with the series, love them and will continue till the end.
Bottom line is: That I do highly recommend the entire FMP series and it probably is a `must have' in your anime collection.

I hope that I could help you...",1174694400,22,11588,4.5996131528046424
