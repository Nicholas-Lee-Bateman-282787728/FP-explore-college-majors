8665311,4,B00LD0VCVM,"If one can get past the ber-British bonifides and early Thirties, theatrical-pedigree production values, Silent Partner makes for a rewarding foray into the classic British cosy. A young Donald Wolfit appears as a menacing villain, Lilian Odland and John Loder make an appealing leading couple, and train buffs will appreciate the scenes on and around the rails. But the real attraction here is (third-billed) Peter Haddon, who plays Lord Peter Wimsey with comic aplomb in quintessentially eccentric, old boy fashion, quite a contrast to the takes on the character by Ian Carmichael and Edward Petherbridge. But once I settled down and adjusted to Haddons acquired taste Wimsey and the vintage qualities of the early production, Silent Partner turned out to be a most enjoyable cosy romp as well as a good exemplar of the British train mystery. Four stars, just barely.",1479772800,,869,5.170212765957447
