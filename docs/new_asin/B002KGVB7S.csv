3940241,3,B002KGVB7S,"The title of The Merry Gentleman, Michael Keaton's directorial debut, comes from the beginning of the film when hitman Keaton helps secretary Kelly MacDonald, who has fallen under a Christmas Tree she is trying to bring into her apartment.  Earlier, MacDonald saw Keaton standing on the ledge of a building across from her office.  Keaton had just made a ""hit"" and was contemplating suicide. It turns out that Keaton is a tailor who kills people on the side and hates himself for it.  Does he show up at MacDonald's door to kill her because she might be able to identify him?  After helping her bring her tree into her apartment, he walks away, only to return the next day to visit her.  Unfortunately, he has pneumonia and falls senseless the ground outside her apartment.  MacDonald finds him, gets him to the hospital, and a beautiful friendship is born -- on Christmas Day, no less.

  All this described action takes place in the first few minutes of the movie.  The rest of the film explores the relationship of Keaton and MacDonald, and it is well done.  If the film doesn't make much sense, we don't care because we are genuinely interested in what is going to happen to this odd couple.  The police are after Keaton and MacDonald's abusive husband is after her.  Will the police catch Keaton and will MacDonald's husband find her?  We care about the answers to these questions and watch with some interest as the plot plays out.

  As mentioned in the beginning of this review, this film is Michael Keaton's directorial debut.  He directs his cast, particularly MacDonald, reasonably well, but the story is confusing, particularly his own role as hitman.  All the characters related to the hitman part of the story are given marginal status in the film.  They appear, disappear, and are forgotten.  We have no idea what motivates Keaton and this is a problem.  How are we to understand his behavior towards MacDonald?  He kills people mercilessly, yet he is kind and caring toward MacDonald.

  I have been careful to avoid mentioning any spoilers in this review.  I recommend the film because the Keaton/MacDonald story is genuinely interesting and well done.  At the very end the viewer can decide what sense it all makes.  I must admit confusion and some slight disappointment.",1255651200,21,2289,4.812339331619537
3940242,2,B002KGVB7S,"Definitely well acted, but it had a perfectly lousy ending.  It was full of disturbed characters, non of which had (those that lived) any resolved issues.  I was completely left hanging, and feeling like I had just eaten a steak without any seasoning -- it wasn't satisfying.",1520294400,,275,4.829787234042553
3940243,5,B002KGVB7S,"Watch it when you have time to enjoy a original movie with good writing, directing and acting.",1519171200,,94,4.588235294117647
3940244,5,B002KGVB7S,"I'm a huge Michael Keaton fan, one of the most underappreciated actors out there. Don't know why he was absent from movies for so long but it's great that he's back. Like Clint Eastwood, he just gets better with age.  Keaton directed this movie, an allegory of the devil, who flirts with redemption in the form of a troubled young woman.  This film takes its time unfolding and a lot takes place in the silences between the characters.  Keaton can do more with a glance, a change of expression, a twitch, than many actors working hard to emote. Movie buffs will recognize the lead actress, Kelley MacDonald, from her starring turn in HBO's "" Boardwalk Empire"", which also featured Bobby Canavale, cast here in a brief appearance as the abusive husband.  For those who want nonstop action and snappy dialog, this is not a good choice. But for a quiet, well-acted and satisfying story by a couple of master actors,  I highly recommend it.",1518998400,,936,4.682926829268292
3940245,5,B002KGVB7S,The subtleties in the actors' performances; especially in Keaton and Macdonald's characters are well done. The movie doesn't take short cuts and expects the audience to really think about the characters and their motives. The soundtrack is amazing and well timed as well. I fell in love with this movie and could watch it anytime. You can really see how intelligent Keaton is as an actor and a director here. Bravo on Keaton's first directorial debut. I'm glad he did the movie how he wanted.,1516838400,,492,4.8
3940246,5,B002KGVB7S,very similar to the part she plays in boardwalk empire. lots of synchronicity in this movie.,1516147200,,92,4.8125

3940248,4,B002KGVB7S,"It was a great movie. It had enough suspnse and a balance of drama; no physical, sexual scenes. The human connection was real and mellow and internal. I also thought if i was a hitman or played one; Michael Keaton portrays a good one. Big UpS! I thought it was gonna suck.",1513987200,,272,4.25
3940249,2,B002KGVB7S,maybe if keaton and his character (who had no back story and made no sense except as being the 'hit man' ~ for whom? no informaton) had kept his wooden appearance out of the movie it may have been better. kelly mcdonald and bobby cannavale both delivered and i do not think it was necessarily due to keaton's directorial expertise. they are both terrific actors. the whole jesus/religious thing was a drag for me. do not watch as the movie does not allow you anything substantial how? what? why? and the end is even more confusion. very disappointed.,1513814400,,550,4.622448979591836

3940251,5,B002KGVB7S,"A wonderful little movie. A touching story wrought beautifully. There were no giveaways, no tipping off about where the story would lead. I'll watch this one again in a year or so, I hope. I'm glad that I came upon it during this Christmas season, as that made the setting of the film even better for me.",1513123200,3,304,4.350877192982456

3940253,5,B002KGVB7S,"I am just delighted to have found this gem. If you appreciate a  well-acted and understated film, give this one a try. The script is in temperament more European than American; It is for those who can think for themselves and appreciate subtle excellence. If all you want is to be force-fed the standard no-thought American slice-em, dice-em, blow-them-up fare or indie navel-gazing, take a pass.",1511654400,4,396,5.0
3940254,3,B002KGVB7S,"Just OK, watched because I'm a Michael Keaton fan.  Detective reminded me of Ray Ramano, both in appearance and personality.  The whole plodded along at glacial speed and I kept waiting for the action to pick up, but alas it never did.  Then the movie ends leaving me to wonder what in the hell was the point of this entire movie?",1511136000,,330,4.377049180327869
3940255,3,B002KGVB7S,It starts off slowly as a trope that picks up nicely and I enjoy Keaton playing the understated role. If you close your eyes Kelly Macdonald sounds good but once you open them you wonder why all men are attracted to her. I was a little confused at the ending and that wasn't a good place to leave the viewer with a doubt. Not much happens but its a drama with a little mystery and its concise so it worked for me.,1510963200,,413,4.048780487804878

3940259,4,B002KGVB7S,"I enjoyed the slow, thoughtful pace of this movie.  I wasn't able to predict any of the scenes, which was a pleasant surprise. It was nice to see Michael Keaton in what for him was an unusual role. I did feel ambiguous about the end.",1510272000,,233,4.177777777777778

3940266,5,B002KGVB7S,"A different kind of Christmas movie. Lots of underpinnings, including abuse, excuses,salvation, shame, privacy, the kindness of strangers, the power nearly total strangers can have on one's world view, the pursuit of different kinds of attraction, the solace of snow, and more. This film, directed by Michael Keaton, is nuanced and not afraid of understatement, nor unfilled spaces without dialogue. The pace is pitch perfect, not too slow nor is it action packed.
True to life finale. I find so many movies that center around Christmas to be pithy and vacuous. This one is none of those things, and unlike other films with a holiday backdrop, this does not limit it to a Christmas time frame. Bittersweet, it 'tis.",1509235200,4,715,5.016806722689076

3940271,5,B002KGVB7S,"This was stunning! I was blown away by Michael Keaton's acting ability, and even more so when I read that he had directed it. I am struck speechless by the beauty of this movie. How perfect to match Keaton's character with the fragile beauty of Kelly McDonald's character, so perfectly portrayed by this magnificent actress.  I'm just grateful for the privilege of this experience.",1508457600,,381,4.953125
3940272,2,B002KGVB7S,"Watching this is like watching two porcupines make love, it's slow, and boring and everyone is just glad when it ends. The plot is laid out in the first 30 minutes, and thats it, the whole movie just kind of plods along.",1508457600,,220,4.261904761904762
3940273,1,B002KGVB7S,"Another movie with a NON-ENDING, so don't waste your time!  If that's not enough:
1.  The girl's accent is so thick that you'll need sub-titles to understand her dialogue at times.
2.  The greasy cop is revolting.
3.  There's yet another portrayal (from jewish Hollywood) of a Christian as a nut-job.",1508371200,,300,4.823529411764706

3940279,5,B002KGVB7S,"Very, very well played. Depth of characters was crafted by acting (imagine that). Less is more in situational story telling and this tale does not rely on contrived dialogue. Dialogue was artful, well written, well delivered, judiciously understated and.often awkward, as it is in real life. The story might be described as slow but more accurately it was at a realistic pace - instead of some super hyped action that might be needed to keep your attention if the story or acting were deficient as in so many movies. Addresses issues of who is good, who is evil, who is an angel, who saved who, who is the kindest man you ever met? Some reviews complained that it had no ending- it had no usual canned ending. It had lots of endings, He left to protect her and alleviate her conundrum of his duplicity. He left because the detective had figured him out. He stayed and he was just walking back. He was just taking a walk in the woods. He was walking to the dry cleaners to clean his favorite old hat. He was......",1507939200,2,1012,4.475675675675675

THE SUPPORTING ACTORS (POLICE DETECTIVES) brought the film full circle (totally convincing).... Even the female friend was excellent...........All-in-All  AMAZING CHEMISTRY... However cliffhanger ending is exasperating... I, sort of, created my own conclusion (smiles). ... *Could be: HITMAN wanted the cops to think he committed suicide to put them off his scent.....*Final Note:  HITMAN found it easy to snuff out the lives of others - Although, when it came to killing himself - COWARD...",1507766400,3,886,5.844961240310077

Then meets a suicidal hit man (Michael Keaton) who has a tailor shop as as cover. A pushy detective who is more interested in dating her than solving crime, which kinda creeped me out. He also lied about his habits (smoking and drinking) and still seems like a jump that he figured out who the hit man was.

Keaton was in his acting element. The acting is superb, compelling, & the best chemistry between these two characters/actors. Both gentle souls in his & her own way. The only part I didn't like was the pushy detective, who was more interested in dating the woman who was clearly not his type, than solving his cases; othervise, I loved this film & wish it had turned out differently for the two main characters. The writing enhanced the story to the point of wanting more from or perhaps between the two. Highly recommended.",1506988800,,670,4.938053097345133
3940306,5,B002KGVB7S,"Kate Frazier (Kelly Macdonald) escapes her abusive husband and, in her new town, is unknowingly drawn to a seemingly kindly, notably fragile assassin, Frank Logan (Michael Keaton).  Pulled into the mix by a variety of events, is the self-deprecating, romantically obvious, much-smarter-than-you-thought Detective Murcheson (Tom Bastounes), who also digs Kate. The piece models quality filmmaking, as all disciplines shine and execute in sync. The mystery, just the right degree of far-fetched, reads curiously plausible. There are no obvious throw-away lines or action, so little feels arbitrary or extraneous. Atmosphere is brimming. The story isn't rushed, the pacing just right, characters building along the way. The cast is impressive across the board, with a serious nod to Darlene Hunt.  Writing, cinematography, editing, and music are exceptional. And saving the best for last, directing by Michael Keaton is first-rate, and his first time. It's a winner!",1506902400,4,963,5.680555555555555

She has an undefinable depth and power and subtlety within her which, for me, puts her in the realm of the all-time greats. Michael Keaton's great range and versatility is a worthy match for her in this film, which he also directed. It's a slow, sensitive, dark example of the long line of Christmastime romances which have emanated out of Hollywood since it's early days. This one has NO sex or nudity shown AT ALL - not even a kiss! It's deep, thoughtful, moody, and mostly features introverted characters. Fortunately I watched it on a day I was feeling that way too. It's NOT an action film and the violence is mostly implied, not much shown. Its an out-of-the-ordinary actors' film with an intriguing story line, appropriate dialogue, solid supporting cast, and a masterful soundtrack.",1506816000,11,936,4.748466257668712

3940316,5,B002KGVB7S,"For some of you this movie will go right over your head. The Merry Gentleman is a euphemism of the Devil. If you watch this film and keep that in mind you will understand Keaton's character much better. He is the devil himself, there are several references to fallen angles and Kelly McDonald is a lost soul that Keaton has stumbled upon and is finding salvation within her character. During one scene McDonald talks about God and if the Devil asked for forgiveness what would God say. The answer was thoughtful. Well written, well acted, and just a great story. At least that's my take, I have been known to be wrong before. But I thoroughly enjoyed the dialogue, even the character scenes had hidden meaning you just had to be listening for it. It is a definite watch by those of you who like the struggle between good and evil and the blurring of the lines.",1506470400,22,860,4.484076433121019

3940334,4,B002KGVB7S,"Unusual story, and great acting. This film has a lot of ""stalkery"" dudes in it. The female lead - Kate leaves one abusive relationship,(her husband is in law enforcement), and is then stalked by an alcoholic cop in a most unprofessional manner. The hit-man, played by Keaton seems to care for Kate (Kelly Macdonald), but even his behavior is similar to a stalker. Poor Kate is very quiet, and (while she is brave enough to leave her abusive husband) has a difficult time telling these guys what is on her mind. We the audience aren't quite sure what is on her mind, but she looks extremely uncomfortable in the presence of these men.

It is a good film, and while it did pretty poorly at the box office - I am glad I took the time to watch. The rental fee right now is 3.99 so it was a bargain for an unusual script that was well acted.

But the pauses in this film serve to take a good story line and turn it into a forgettable experience. This is a story of guilt, and loneliness and sadness. The battered wife at the center of the movie escapes her husband to begin a new life in a new city all alone; her horrid husband is left alone; her closest colleague at work is single, craving affection and lonely; the hit man with a kind streak is so lonely and rueful as to be suicidal; the overbearing police investigator has countless reasons for his own loneliness.

3940397,5,B002KGVB7S,"When I keep going back to a movie and watching it again and again over a period of time then it must be a 5 star movie.  The first time you see this movie, you just think how strange it is, how underplayed all the parts are, how slow moving it is.  But, it stays in the mind so that you keep going back to watch it again and finding more and more in it.  I always liked Michael Keaton though some of his movies were not well suited to him.  I remember going to see him in Batman and thinking that he simply did not fit the part.  Then I read a review of the movie that said that the reviewer had thought he was not suited for the part but that early in the movie someone asked him who he was and he said ""I'm Batman"" AND HE WAS.  That stuck with me.  No matter what movie you see Keaton in he inhabits the role totally.  If you have not seen the movie ""MY LIFE"" where he plays a man dying of cancer you should get it and look at it.  It is amazing.  So, anyway, I love this movie and look at it fairly often.

3940398,4,B002KGVB7S,"This  movie wasn't exactly what I was expecting.  I don't know what I was expecting to tell the truth, but it worked somehow.  Michael Keaton is usually larger than life in the films that I've seen him but in this one even though he has a major role, he has very little dialogue.  That might be troubling to some people who have a certain impression of this actor from films like Beatlejuice, Mr. Mom, even the Batman movie.  He plays an older mature and troubled guy whose job is starting to get to him.  Kelly MacDonald of The Girl In The Cafe fame plays opposite as a woman on the run from an abusive husband.  In fact that's what's so interesting about this film--it's that both characters are on the run and they provide a refuge for each other. The other incidental character is the police detective who interviews Katie(MacDonald) and becomes attracted to her while trying to obtain more information about the man on the ledge plus the man in her apartment.  The background music of the movie is sedate for the most part and like a lot of Indie movies there is not much action, but the moods and the isolation of the streets and the aloneness of these two main characters make it effective.",1352937600,8,1197,4.483870967741935
3940399,5,B002KGVB7S,"The thing that most stays with you after this movie for me was - yet again - why in the HELL doesn't Michael Keaton make MORE MOVIES...?? I mean, the guy is a genius and certainly one of the best actors on film today. He has a depth and a presence that few in his craft possess, yet he hasn't been active in years. The Merry Gentleman is an unlikely story, unfolding slowly but deliberately. As usual with Keaton's more dramatic roles, you've GOT to pay attention to the details. The other MAJOR reason I wanted to see this movie was the excellent Kelly McDonald.... I mean, who ELSE could steal a scene in an already intense film like ""No Country for Old Men"" the way Kelly did? And that demure southern accent from a girl who is so obviously Scottish? Excellent. Sorry.. back to the movie. I really liked the character development of the detective character in this film, obviously the result of good writing. But the lead character brought to life so much more depth than police in ""crime thrillers"" are won't to bring to screen, and it was refreshing. Thumbs up on Keaton's directorial debut, which was entirely by accident, given that the intended director was laid up in the hospital at the time. Definitely not your hollywood blockbuster, but a lot of thought went into this picture and it is certainly worth your time to see.",1351987200,6,1333,4.558333333333334

It is sad that he has not appeared in better fare, but such is life it seems. This movie has his touch, after all he is the director, though the star is Kelly MacDonald. I enjoyed how though he is a hitman in this story he is still nonchalant even if suicidal. It is what it is, a mellow story about a hitman who seems a bit transformed by a lovely lady.

In the scene that made me stand up and step closer to the TV, Michael keaton is cold..., very cold..., to the detective without being, (whats the word I seek?), obvious? Michael Keaton's S-L-O-W delivery in response to the Detectives astute 'observations' sent shivers down my spine as I witnessed one of those rare cinematic moments (for me) that I will never forget and and I will FOREVER tell people about this movie so they to (as well as you, now!) can witness Michael Keaton deliver this role of UNDERSTATED ELEGANCE...

From madcap comedies like Night Shift and Mr. Mom to harrowing dramas like Clean & Sober and Game 6, Keaton is one of our most valued cinematic resources all but ignored in modern Hollywood. And yet, he was somehow able to secure financing and helm this touching character study about loneliness. It's a quiet film, the kind you have to lean into and meet on its own terms. While it may involve a hit man, an abused woman and a meddlesome policeman, The Merry Gentleman is independent to the bone. The pacing is very deliberate and static. And though it may not be for everyone, if you favor stillness over bombast, character over action, you should be pleasantly surprised by it.",1296259200,56,785,4.737226277372263
3940404,4,B002KGVB7S,"If you must have action and sex and comedy in every scene of a movie, you will not appreciate this one. On the other hand, if you like subtlety and nuance and understatement, this is the movie for you. If you liked ""Dinner Rush"" with Danny Aiello, you will like this one too. If you liked Coppola's ""The Conversation"" you will also like this one.
A movie full of absolutely wonderful scenes (blown seal joke, Christmas tree in farm field, hospital room, church, restaurant dates, scenes between the two cops), great dialogue, magnificent acting. Kelly MacDonald is fabulous, Michael Keaton tremendous as actor and director. His lined face, under that cloth cap, is a roadmap of pain and regret.
There is little or no exposition in this film. The ending is open, so don't expect all your ""t's"" to be crossed. You may have to think a bit. If you can handle that, you will find this to be a fascinating movie.
""I don't really notice the people as much as I notice the suits."": great, revealing line by Keaton's character. Noteworthy performance by Tom Bastounes as the cop interested in Kelly Mac's character.",1286841600,4,1106,4.706185567010309
3940405,5,B002KGVB7S,"""The Merry Gentleman"" is a fine movie that deserves your support. It has a well-wrought, intelligent script you haven't seen before filled with complex, interesting characters. And, as the story unfolds, you are given glimpses ""like flickering candles"" into their personalities. Shown only enough to care, be enthralled, and glean some understanding, you are then left to come to your own conclusions about each character's actions and inner motivations. The effect is a mysterious, enigmatic story that mystifies and thoroughly entertains. In short, ""The Merry Gentleman"" makes you feel and makes you think, and isn't that what a fine film should do?
Michael Keaton, who also plays a contract killer in the film, makes his directorial debut with this production. He is to be commended for choosing such a fine script and so beautifully bringing it to life. As director, he seems totally focused on doing justice to the characters and the story. It is a fine first film, and I hope there will be many more. It is also to his credit that he chose Kelly Macdonald for the film's leading role.
Ms. Macdonald's performance is a study in what fine acting should be. Her character has wonderful internal integrity and evokes genuine empathy. She doesn't miss a beat in the film, and her sure, unaffected mastery of her role makes it look easy. Well, it isn't, and her work is of the highest order. Include Mr. Keaton's fine acting and directing and the outstanding work of fellow actors such as Tom Bastounes, Guy Van Swearingen, Mike Bradecich, Debbie Burns, Darlene Hunt, and others; and you have great film you won't forget and will want to watch again.
As you can tell, I liked this film. I liked it because I like dedication to the art of making the best film one can. ""The Merry Gentleman"" strives to be the best film it can be because of the care and love the director, cast, and crew put into it. Thanks for a fine film.",1269475200,21,1922,4.740298507462686
3940406,3,B002KGVB7S,Why isn't Keaton doing more? He is controlled and mesmerizing. Surely there must be roles for this guy. A watchable entertaining little movie.,1266710400,2,142,5.217391304347826
3940407,3,B002KGVB7S,"Keaton is fun to watch in this film as a reticent hit man with more than a little trouble relating to people, and Kelly Macdonald is fine, as a Scots woman on the run from an abusive husband. There's a cute meet as he finds her under a fallen Christmas tree, and the unlikeliest of tentative love affairs blossoms between them.

Meanwhile, two police detectives slowly put the two of them together with some unsolved murders, and a born-again abusive husband makes a sudden and unnerving appearance. The surprise for me in the film is Tom Bastounes as an overweight cop who befriends Macdonald's character and is a warmly endearing presence, clear if unsuccessful in his intentions, while all the other characters swim in a kind of foggy mystification that keeps us guessing about where it could all possibly be going.

Shot in Chicago under dismal winter skies, where blue-green is the dominant color, this oddly misnamed film is quirky and slow, though not without its moments, some of them a bit self-conscious as Keaton and Macdonald dispose of a Christmas tree by burning it in a harvested cornfield. The writers go entertainingly far out on a limb but didn't find a good ending for their effort. The DVD has a short making-of documentary.",1264204800,2,1244,4.808411214953271
3940408,4,B002KGVB7S,"The caroling reference in this movie should have been to ""Silent Night"" rather than ""Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen."" That's because both nascent romances in this film are marked by long, brooding silences. Man and woman sit in the same darkened room, but exchange only sporadic, terse clichs - making them look like the isolated figures in a Hopper painting.

By contrast, the movies of the 1930's were usually marked by rapid, witty exchanges - by words that tickled upwards like champagne bubbles. There should be a happy medium somewhere between such unrealistic loquacity and the suppression and taciturnity of films such as this one. Neither is how people really try to get to know each other on a first date or in a developing relationship.

It's also a bit difficult to understand in general why both of the lead male characters in this film - police detective and hit man - might be attracted to the young Irish secretary. Yes, she's pretty and suggests innocence. But her innocence isn't very interesting apart from one early scene where we see her standing enchanted with the falling snow - while other people are just rushing home in it, indifferent to its magic. After that though, her naivet seems heavy, downcast, and somewhat implausible in this day-and-age. We later learn that there is a reason for her weighted demeanor - that she in fact has baggage. But this doesn't serve to make her any more interesting.

There is also a layer of impressed religious belief running through this film that sometimes seemed to threaten to cross the line into preachy religiosity. It occurred to me that this might be one of those films sponsored by a religious denomination to subtly promote its beliefs. But no, this is apparently a film project spearheaded by Michael Keaton, the star, without any ulterior motive.

In spite of this film's overall tendency to drag a bit under some unseen, oppressive weight - there still is good reason to check it out. While most female characters we get in films nowadays have to be saucy, sassy, and kick-ass - it is refreshing and startlingly different to see a young woman of simple goodness.

Then there is the element of suspense created by the predicament the hit man finds himself in vis--vis the woman who might be able to implicate him in a murder. We get a low-key version of the tension generated between killer Richard Crenna and blind woman Audrey Hepburn in the 1960's film ""Wait Until Dark."" Which impulse, which necessity will win out in the killer - his commitment to his profession - or his tender attraction to a young woman?",1262822400,3,2580,4.78876404494382
3940409,1,B002KGVB7S,"Yes, even you can write a screenplay! All you need is one page of dialogue in 99 pages of ""he walked slowly down the aisle, his shoes clicking on the tile,"" and ""long shot of killer standing alone in an alley."" Pitty Macdonald for wasting her talent in this tripe. She barely says ten lines of dialogue. Art should be more meaningful than life, not less so.",1259107200,3,357,4.343283582089552
3940410,4,B002KGVB7S,"Michael Keaton has one of the best hit man faces out there, and I enjoyed watching this slow paced tale unfold and in the end, embrace a certain ambiguity.

The story follows the unlikely crossing of paths between a professional hitter and a Scottish secretary who inadvertently sees Keaton after he has sniped someone. We never get too much background on him, nor why he does anything that he does, but we do get a relationship development theme. What made this stand out was the writing regarding the police, they were shown as actually figuring out the mysteries surrounding the story (instead of them being oblivious and looking dumb). Not the most conclusive ending for the characters, but I liked it.

The DVD clarity is good and the sound is adequate; the supplement is a 16 minute making-of that had some good behind the scenes about Keaton's thought process on both sides of the camera. 3.5 for the film and DVD quality, .5 for the supplement.",1257984000,14,952,4.728915662650603
3940411,5,B002KGVB7S,"A quiet, powerful story of two people with different cases of post-traumatic stress.  One is a suicidal killer, the other a battered wife who is afraid to trust anyone.
Frank Logan (Michael Keaton) is really good at being a hitman and is also an excellent tailor with his own store.
Frank is conflicted: think ""Gross Point Blank"" middle aged and without comedy.
He also methodically kills any possible witnesses. Frank's hit jobs are not at all emotional, they are done with a sense of workmanship and inevitability. Even one of Frank's victims said he was wondering when he would finally come.
Frank meets Kate Frazier (Kelly Macdonald) in person after she saw him from afar trying to commit suicide after a technically well executed hit job. It's likely he has come to kill her but he collapses outside her door with pneumonia. She takes him to the hospital and then spends Christmas day with him there.
Kate has been trying her best to stay away from prodding questions and to remain alone because she has been badly beaten by her policeman husband and has left him to start a new, safer life.
Kate doesn't realize that Frank is the hitman. He is at least as alienated and closed off as she is and she somehow feels some safety in his quiet presence. He asks no prying questions and seems as alone in the world as she is. They bond over little unspoken kindnesses and events of everyday life.
Frank and Kate slowly develop a solid companionship together. He is quietly sensitive to her and tries to take care of her.
Kate's husband finds her and terrifies her again. Unfortunately for him, Frank finds out.
The apparent suicide of Kate's husband brings unwanted attention to Frank from the police. A policeman who has been interested in Kate (without success) informs her that Frank is probably the hitman and likely also killed her husband.
Frank must leave and he does leave,as much for her as himself.  But he does not kill himself or anyone else as he leaves.

OR was he intrigued by her angelic appearance in the window. Several nuances were left to the watcher giving the whole movie a mystique which I liked.

Don't know why he's a merry gentleman. It's different from the other detective movies where all the cops do is yell at you and say you're guilty, confess. That has become so tiresome. Creativity anyone? Please?  Anyway, I'd say, it's almost normal. She's a good crier. Face is all wet. Tears streaming. Wonder who she's grieving while acting. Ordinary people going about their lives.

If you watch, I think you will find the cop rather ""stalkerish "" and insensitive. The acting was first rate, delivery of the dialogue was excellently timed and the visuals were incredible. Mr. Keaton has always been one of my favorite actors and now one of the directors I look for when deciding to watch a movie.  Well worth the price of admission.",1525392000,,635,4.521739130434782
