8011307,5,B0001DYVS8,"I thought this was a TV movie and could never remember the name. Can't believe it isn't on dvd. I found a great quality version online and
it's as good as I remember. So much better than any of the gory bloody sexed up CGI garbage the make now. Crenna is great as always
and Andrew Prine is too and has the best death scene in horror movie history. The story of a haunted house is very well done and has
some great scary creepy scenes. Most of the death scenes are done very well instead of using blood and gore which there is a little.
The movie moves at a fast clip and one thing after another keeps you on your seat. Victor Bruno makes a great Devil in the last 1/2
hour and is the best scene in the movie. The ending is a little disappointing but not terrible. Instead of them just driving off it would
have been better at least to hear how they explained how all those people were killed to the police! but hey still a classic horror movie.",1500163200,,945,4.113513513513514

8011309,5,B0001DYVS8,"Despite the patchy story line and the cheesy special effects throughout, still a good scare. The entire movie is made worthy in my mind by one, the scene in the beginning where the wooden fireplace bust of a demon turns its head. If all of the other special effects in this movie were of this magnitude the movie might have done much better. And two, Victor Buono's stellar performance at the very end of the movie. No piano playing, tea sipping nagging mother here! The aforementioned first scene was so haunting to me I can still vividly recall it 25 years later.",1387843200,2,565,4.549019607843137
8011310,2,B0001DYVS8,"The movie is wasted only by scenes of people sliding around and people getting killed by electric shocks. There isn't enough to qualify this as spine-tingling fun. It is also laughably dated in visual material! Try to watch that sick girl shake all over the floor in her undies for a change and you'll see why! The only exception would be Andrew Prine sinking in mud and attempting to commit suicide.

At first, I was expecting a shrieky classic haunted house spook show, but this wasn't it. Granted, THE EVIL suffers from a serious lack of diversity, or a story. You know a movie that has a conflicting situation between good and evil, and the end always turns out to be quite simple.

Any low-budget horror movie can do A LOT better than this, but for the moment, give THE EVIL some extra credit for its dark and thunderous setting that lives up to my expectations. This one spoils the most hardcore horror fans for not being frightening enough though.",1386633600,,954,4.605882352941176
8011311,2,B0001DYVS8,"I saw this when I was in my teens. Yes, that was a long time ago. But I remember this movie.

Why?

Because it scared me down to my toes. And then did something so inanely stupid as to break that mechanism within me that could get scared watching movies. Completely broke it. It's still broken.

Not since that movie have I ever been scared, or even had suspenseful feelings, watching a horror movie. Because this one so terrified me, then lost it due to what has to be not just Horror Film's stupidest endings, but the stupidest ending in all of filmdom.

When you see the end... and I pray you don't go that far... you'll see what I mean. And I'm not going to spoil it here. But... wow.

If there was one movie I could unsee in my life, it's this one. Then perhaps I could enjoy a horror movie again sometime.

Really. This was a very very scary movie, and if you want to enjoy it, watch it until the hero jumps down into the trap door. Then hit STOP and enjoy your memory of what was a great, suspenseful horror film. But please, hit that STOP button!",1278374400,2,1054,4.193069306930693

8011313,5,B0001DYVS8,"Saw this on T.V. in 1981 and loved it. A group of do-gooders take over an old mansion so as to use it as a drug counselling centre. Before long , one of them starts to see a ghost and the others come up against an unseen force which has been unwittingly released. Keep an eye out for Victor Buono cackling his way through a scene stealing part. Can't say much more without ruining it , but i love 70's horror and this one is pretty special to me.",1206748800,,446,4.022471910112359
8011314,3,B0001DYVS8,"While looking into movies that I loved as a kid I ran across this one that I first saw on late night cable just after we got it. I really enjoyed it then and now but it's NOT THAT GREAT!

  Professor(Richard Crenna) takes students to house and IT'S HAUNTED!!!

While it does entertain, It's in a campy way, not as a great horror movie. I'm a lover of the old T.V. horror movies, so you know that graphic gore isn't what I look for. This one has a story line that is filled with every cliche of the ""Haunted House"" genre and it goes step by step through every one of them. like I said it's fun , But ""Gone With The Wind"" it ain't!",1176940800,,629,4.008
8011315,5,B0001DYVS8,"If you are a horror fan like me, you have to watch this movie.  The special effect are super cool, still cool for modern times.  A little slow in the biginning but man, it pick up right away.  I don't understand why they haven't made a remake of this movie, instead they make remakes of BAD movies of shows from the 70's.",1140912000,6,321,4.145161290322581
8011316,5,B0001DYVS8,I really enjoying watching this horror film during 1988. This is the best movie I've watched during that time. I don't understand why the producer never re-create this into DVD...Hope that they read this and decided to remake it to DVD movie.,1127347200,4,242,4.785714285714286
