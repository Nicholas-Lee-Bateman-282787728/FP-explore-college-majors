6936660,2,B00RYZFPLI,"Alices Restaurant, 1969 film

Arlo Guthrie answers questions about his health for the draft board. Huntingtons Chorea is hereditary. Arlo plays his own music in class. The police question him about his friend. There is a scene in a restaurant, a fight caused a broken window. Arlo is suspended and hitches a ride with a trucker; on the road again. A church is de-consecrated and sold. There are changes inside. Other people arrive for a visit. The story runs on. Alice Brock owns her restaurant in Stockbridge Mass. Arlo sings his song about it. They show a dirt bike race. [This pads out the story.] There is a scene in the restaurant. Arlo explains Huntingtons Chorea - its not a war wound, but hereditary. Arlo visits his father in a hospital. Pete Seeger sings about migratory workers who pick crops. Then another scene in a kitchen

Alice visits Arlo in New York City. Arlo plays the music for his song. Two friends arrive. Ray invited people to that church for Thanksgiving. Things will be different, he says. [The gasoline prices and automobiles date this movie.] Arlo brings a donkey to the gathering. After the feast the garbage was taken to the town dump. [Do they still have these?] But the town dump was closed for Thanksgiving. So they dumped it at another place. Somebody reported this to the police. Officer Obie called Arlo, an envelope with his name on it was found under the garbage. They are arrested and taken to the scene of the crime. Littering is a crime. [Not a joke.] Alice bailed them out, their friends meet them outside. They plead guilty, were fined $25, and had to pick up the garbage. [No seat belts in cars.]

Where can they dump the garbage? On a barge that is taken out to sea. Arlo gets summoned for his Army physical in Whitehall in Manhattan. Was he ever arrested? Yes - for littering. He is sent to Group W, then fills out a form. One member has a problem with the police over his behavior. You promised! Shelly is told to take his junk away, and leaves. Cars drive on the highway. Arlo learns of his fathers departure from the hospital. There is a scene in a graveyard; a friend died in a flophouse from an overdose. There is a wedding between Alice and Ray, then a celebration and a feast. They show the activities in the building. [This pads out the story.] Ray plans to sell the building and buy hundreds of acres in Vermont. Are his dreams realistic? People drive away. Can you get anything you want at Alices Restaurant? Not really.

The song ran for 18 minutes, this adaption runs for over 100 minutes. Which was better? The movie is not as good as the song; your opinion may differ. Would you watch this movie twice? Its like a documentary about life and attitudes circa 1969 for some people. What did they accomplish?",1488067200,,2764,4.55533199195171

6936682,5,B00RYZFPLI,This was not a musical score as I expected but it is a good movie with the Arlo Guthrie of the 60s era in it as the main actor.  His facial expression is more energetic that is the older (more mature) Arlo Guthrie. Pete Seeger made an appearance in the movie with a guitar which he played in addition to singing in the company of Arlie and the actor playing Woody Guthrie (in his sick bed).,1462147200,,390,4.131578947368421
6936683,2,B00RYZFPLI,"Well it was awesome seeing/hearing Pete Seeger singing, if just for the short time he did and if you love Arlo Guthrie, you'll likely find something to like in this really dated film.

6936684,4,B00RYZFPLI,"Alice's Restaurant was director Arthur Penn's 1969 hit after the tremendously popular Bonnie and Clyde, almost a follow-up to his previous instant success.  It's based on Arlo Guthrie's ballad about the attitude of law enforcement in general to the hippies of the times, and a run-in he had which eventually gets him out of the draft on a legal technicality.  It wasn't the joyous love-in a lot of the audience was expecting.  A likeable but usually recognizably skittish ""reformed"" heroin addict comes to his predictable conclusion (at least the funeral's in a snowy winter ceremony), a perhaps 16 year old half-naked groupie near physical starvation for her hormones appears near the beginning;  Ray and Alice, the proprietors (played by burly James Broderick and quite buxom enough Pat Quinn) have their marital tiffs.  On the whole, though, director Penn keeps things under control, sending Guthrie from New York City to Montana, then to an old church his friends have purchased in Stockbridge. Massachusetts, and back and forth between rural Massachusetts and New York, Shelley's (the addict's) rehab center and the then Whitehall draft board headquarters (and the hospital where Arlo's father, Woody Guthrie, a famous Depression balladeer, is wasting away with Huntington's Chorea).  But the Alice's Restaurant ballad is all there and performed to perfection.  As you see Alice at the door of the church at the end, Ray off for perhaps a better deal in rural Vermont, you get the feeling Penn would like like  like hell to comfort this band of wandering, sometime flower-children, but he's a New York born-
and bred professional.  I've never heard scriptwriter Venable Herndon's name again.",1461369600,7,1696,5.205882352941177

6936695,4,B00RYZFPLI,"It's hard for me to give a completely subjective review of this film since it was shot where I grew up and in fact I saw it being made on several occasions . What I can tell you is that the vibe and verisimilitude of that era are spot on . Alice (Brock ) was a real person, Chief Obie (played by himself) was the real police chief  when I was a kid and Arlo is ,well, Arlo.  It's fun to note that Norman Rockwell's studio was less than a 100  feet from where some of the scenes were shot , scenes  which in many ways ,were a complete repudiation  of  ""Rockwell's America"".

6936705,3,B00RYZFPLI,"The original MGM Home Video DVD has a wonderful Arlo Guthrie commentary track which explains what IS and what IS NOT accurate to what actually happened in Arlo's life as told in his original song.  It is unforgivable for Olive Films to not include this explanation of the film.

Olive does include Arlo Guthrie's special 3 minute promo film that he made for the movie.  The picture on the Blu-ray cover is from this promo film.

Even though the old MGM DVD is widescreen but not anamorphic (to fill 16x9 widescreen TVs) it is far better that this incomplete presentation.  I will end up keeping my old DVD and zoom the picture while listening to Arlo tell his side of the story.

For those who have this new version without Arlo's informative comments, here are a few things you should know:
*SPOILERS*
1) In Arlo's words: this film is an Adult's perception of Hippie life, we never lived like this.  The squaller is a set designer's idea of what we lived like.
2) The only reality is what was in the original 30 minute song, the other hour of the film is made up to pad the story.
3) The real Ray & Alice appear in the film as extras, their characters are played by professional actors.
4) That is not Arlo's real father on screen, he had passed away before the film was made.
5) The original 1965 Thanksgiving dinner talked about in the song was a small event with just a few friends, it was re-created in 1966 for this movie with a large group of friends.  This has confused some of his friends as they 'remember' being at the original Thanksgiving dinner, which they weren't.  It was not the big party affair as depicted in the movie.
6) Tina Chen plays Arlo's fictional girlfriend in the movie, not real.
7) The drug-addicted character of Shelly was made-up for the film because the film needed some tragedy.
8) The film suggests some intimate relationship between Arlo & Alice that was never there in real life.
9) Arlo never had a club owner come on to here, they just needed weird stuff for the movie.
10) The VW Micro-bus was really Ray's, not Arlo's.",1433721600,19,2060,4.472
6936706,2,B00RYZFPLI,Had forgotten how bad a movie this was. I must've been wasted when I watched it the first time or I never would have bought it!,1432857600,4,127,3.923076923076923
6936707,4,B00RYZFPLI,I love this movie from way back - my coming of age era so much is familiar. I was very disappointed that this copy didn't have the  commentary by Arlo Guthrie about what was going on behind the scenes and how the community of that time is still present today. I wanted to share that with other folks. ;-(,1431561600,6,304,4.1525423728813555
6936708,3,B00RYZFPLI,"I recently wrote that the movie THE BEAT GENERATION was an interesting film because it felt like a time capsule that showed the world what it was like back in 1959. The same can be said of this film as well. For those who weren't around to see the world as it was in the late 60s with the hippie movement and the rest, you get a glimpse of it here. You also get a glimpse of the fact that while some movies present an intolerant society when it came to that group here you discover that it wasn't as bad as most present it.

The movie is based on the hit song by Arlo Guthrie who stars in this film. As it opens he reports for the draft and then heads off to college to avoid joining the service. When things to bad there, he hitches rides back east and ends up in Stockbridge, MA where his friends Alice and Ray Brock have just purchased a failing church and are moving in with all of their friends. Bell bottoms and suede vest abound as well as headband and beads. Except for Ray who seems more blue collar in his appearance and more hippie mode when it comes to his way of life.

At the same time the couples friends are all there to help out fix up an old building that will serve as the restaurant Alice is planning on opening. Everyone seems to be one big happy family, living together and helping one another. No one goes hungry and everyone joins in to help where they are needed. Honestly my only question while watching through this part of the film was where the money was coming from to buy the buildings, supplies and more needed to fund all of this. But thats something never addressed.

Into this world also comes Shelly, an old friend of the group who they pick up when he is released from Bellvue. Shelly was in for drug addiction and is now battling his own demons while the world around him preaches love and peace. There is an attraction between Alice and most of the males in this group but in particular with Shelly. At times you wonder how Ray feels about this but he seems as intent on helping Shelly battle his demons like most parents would with tough love to the point you're not quite sure he isn't aware of the attraction or that he ignores it in hopes Shelly will get his act together.

Back and forth throughout the movie is Arlo visiting his father, Woody, now in a hospital and dying of Huntingtons disease. While Woody can no longer speak you can tell he enjoys seeing his son again. Arlos mother stands by her man, taking care of him and keeping Arlo informed as to what is going on. One visit in particular finds folk singer and friend Pete Seeger in the room playing banjo and singing a folk song the two once did together. Arlo joins in with him for another.

The story moves back and forth from one to another eventually culminating in what was termed by Arlo as the Alices Restaurant Massacre. Having invited all of their friends for a huge Thanksgiving dinner, once they finish they clear up the mess and head to the town dump to dispense with it all. Unfortunately the dump is closed for the holiday. On the way home they find a spot where it looks like others have dumped their trash and follow suit. A local witnesses this and call the police who then arrest Arlo and his friend and take them to the sight. There they find tons of police officers from various groups taking pictures, taking tire tread imprints, collecting garbage and more in an attempt to arrest this group for something more heinous that simple trash dumping. I won't tell you what happens but if you know the song you know already.

The last long portion of the film also ties into the song with Arlo showing up for induction into the military. It becomes perhaps the funniest moment in the film and again, if you know the song you know what happens.

While the film doesnt do any harm I also don't see it doing much good either. The display of a group of people who believe in peace, love and understanding sounds great but in the end someone has to pay for it all. Ive seen reviews of the film that talk about how great it would be if this was the world we lived in while slamming making a living, but they never seem to talk about who will pay for it all. Its a great idea but completely out of touch with reality.

One thing of interest to me was that the film showed people smoking marijuana but when it came to hard drugs the group was dead set against them. While other films portrayed this lifestyle differently it was nice to see a more realistic take on the whole drug scene of the time and a negative one at that for harder drugs.

The most stunning thing about the film though was that it was directed by Arthur Penn. I found it difficult to believe that the man behind this film had done BONNIE AND CLYDE two years prior and a year later would direct LITTLE BIG MAN. When you look at those and other films to his credit it is hard to believe he could have been involved with this one. Perhaps it was an experiment on his part. In the end its not a bad movie but not something Id revisit time and time again. It does make for an interesting time piece and would be great (with a few scenes trimmed) to show kids today what the whole hippie movement was like back then. Not a bad movie but nothing great either.",1431043200,,5236,4.270161290322581
