5855557,2,B00DTUF49A,"A mediocre and predictable plot trajectory imprisons and counteracts fine performances in the flawed Breathe In.  Guy Pearce stars as a bored suburban music teacher and father longing for his youth, when he played in a band and led a more intense life in the city.  Amy Ryan is his wife, and Felicity Jones is a British exchange student and prodigious pianist who enters their home.  The (creepy?  romantic?) dynamic which will unfold is clear from an early scene:  driving from the airport to their home, the well-intentioned Ryan hamstrings and teases Pearce with pragmatism while Jones stares at him from behind, her eyes alight with old-soul understanding of the pain felt by this hipster-turned-square.  Pearce and Jones, both talents of the highest order, deliver fine performances.  A type of masculine, untidy melancholy is a note he can play with ease.  So is reserved, yet seductive elegance for her.  And the film has an apt aesthetic, with its quiet, tree-lined streets and a general color palette of muted and overcast blues, greens, and greys.

Despite these qualities, the film frustrated me with its insistence on traversing a route of forbidden romance; what was at once amusing, exciting, and perverse in Lolita decades ago is now rather bland and generic in hyper-earnest independent films such as this.  So much time is devoted here to building quote-unquote sexual tension and then acting out the uncomfortable scenes of almost-touching and almost-kissing AND THEN later the inevitable post-canoodle fallout, complete with much smashing of household ceramics.  It is by and large time wasted.  I would respect the film so much more if it constructed a fresher thematic sandbox for its gifted cast to play in.  Groan-worthy lines of dialogue such as, ""Don't let fear become your profession"" and ""It's hard to know how to be...truly free"" do not help the film's case.  Nor do a few instances of extreme contrivance, the most egregious of which finds a key character randomly chancing upon the Guy Pearce character's liaison with the exchange student in the forest.",1409184000,4,2083,5.0852941176470585

Rating: 1.5 out of 5.0

Keith Reynolds was a rock musician when he was younger but now aspires to be first cellist in a local symphony orchestra in suburban Westchester. That way, he can quit his regular job as a music teacher at the local high school. He's a grim-faced sort of guy who never laughs (nor do any of the other characters in 'Breathe In', a lugubrious melodrama starring Guy Pearce as a wayward musician). He's married to his non-descript wife, Megan and they have a daughter, Lauren, who attends the same high school Keith teaches in.

The Reynolds decide to sponsor a British exchange student, Sophie, for a semester, and right off the bat you can guess where the plot is going. Sophie, only 18 years old, is the prescribed home wrecker. The only question that remains is what kind of home wrecker is she? Perhaps a demon seed who ends up murdering a principal or two in the household? Not quite. We finally find out that Sophie is a near genius pianist who demonstrates her extreme competence, when Keith insists that she introduce herself by playing a classical piece before his high school class.

After that it's a long drag as Keith and Sophie grow closer to each other. Eventually, they find themselves cuddling by a lake in a local park and there's finally one rather chaste kiss. Much to daughter Lauren's chagrin, she spies her errant father canoodling with the sultry exchange student. Since Lauren was also rejected by her first time sex flame, the combination of the two bad actors (daddy and ex-boyfriend) is too much for her to handle. She gets behind the wheel of her car after swigging some alcohol, and gets into a possibly fatal accident as she veers off the road into the woods, to avoid an oncoming truck.

Of course this dark moment at the end of Act 2, occurs precisely around the same time Keith lands the job as principal cellist in the orchestra and is playing for the first time in the big seat. He's also decided to run off with the young Sophie but just as he meets her, he learns of Lauren's accident.

After Megan trashes the house after realizing that Keith has run off, she meets him at the hospital, where she gives him a decidedly negative reception. Fortunately, director Drake Doremus doesn't go as far as to kill off the daughter, and make this a real heavy-handed tragedy. Instead, poor Sophie gets a double dose of bad stares from both Keith and Megan when they return home and her days in America have decisively come to an end.

David Lee Dallas of Slant Magazine perhaps puts it best in his review: ""Breathe In masquerades as a sensitive character study, seemingly high-brow because it's so low-key, but underneath that veneer is an inert, thinly plotted melodrama premised on trite characterizations that would be offensive if they weren't so absurd.""

Part of Breath In's problem is that most of the dialogue feels like it's improvised. Indeed, director Doremus worked from a 60 page outline and not a full-blown script. After numerous takes, Doremus has been quoted as saying that the actors simply ""knew what to say."" Some may find that inventive, but I do not.

As Breathe In plods along, one finds oneself mildly interested in how the story resolves itself. But once all is said and done, this earnest little tale of infidelity proves to be ordinary as they come.",1408406400,7,3369,4.677364864864865

5855560,3,B00DTUF49A,"""Breathe In"" (2013 release; 97 min.) brings the story of the Reynolds family, mom, dad and HS senior Lauren, who are about to host an exchange student from England. As the movie opens, we see the Reynolds getting together for family portraits. Soon thereafter, mom and dad are going to the airport to pick up Sophie, the exchange student. She turns out to have some serious classical piano talent, something dad picks up on, himself the music teacher in HS and part-time cellist player in the local symphony (and getting ready to audition for a full-time chair in the orchestra). The attraction between Sophie and dad is palpable from the beginning, although Lauren suspects Sophie from making a move towards her ex-b/f Aaron. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-director Drake Doremus, best known for his 2011 film ""Like Crazy"", which was quite good. But here he misfires badly, none more so than by casting Felicity Jones (who also starred--to great acclaim--in ""Like Crazy"") as the 18 yr. old Sophie... mind you, Jones is 30 yrs. old in real life! I'm sorry, but I just couldn't get over that. At one point in the movie, during a ""deep"" conversation between dad (played by Guy Pearce) and her, he comments ""you don't seem as young as you actually are"", well duh! The entire premise of the movie is simply bankrupted by this, and what a waste of Felicity Jones' talent, whom we just recently saw excel in ""The Invisible Woman"". One of the better aspects of the movie is the soundtrack, containing both the (delightful) original score by Dustin O'Halloran and various assorted classical music pieces, which play a big role in the movie.

This movie premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival and I have no idea why it took over a year to be released. The movie opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I went to see it right away. The late matinee screening I saw this at was not particularly well attended. All that aside, ""Breathe In"" is a so-so movie. If you are a fan of Felicity Jones (as I am), you may want to check this out, but beware, it may not fulfill your expectations.",1396569600,2,2253,4.644110275689223

Full of mysterious glances between the two but no emotion behind any of it. For a while it seems like the young woman is running from something but that never really develops. The daughter is either very ditzy or attention-seeking. Overall, it doesn't make any sense because the husband, Keith, is a music teacher who aspires to play with the symphony and when things finally look like they're turning around for him is the time he chooses to run away with Sophie.

5855577,4,B00DTUF49A,"Well into this movie about a May-December romance - although it is more appropriately an April-September affair - things began to feel familiar.  I didn't know much about the film at the time, but a quick check of the Blu ray case provided the clue.  Drake Doremus, who directed and co-wrote (with Ben York Jones) the film also helmed one of my favorite movies from 2011, ""Like Crazy.""

Felicity Jones, who plays a similar character in ""Like Crazy,"" is Sophie, a foreign exchange student from England and a piano virtuoso.  She will live with the Reynolds family in suburban New York.  Keith (Guy Pearce) and Megan (Amy Ryan), have a same-age daughter, Lauren (Mackenzie Davis), a high school senior.  Sophie is a bit surprised when she discovers they aren't actually in Manhattan but ""about an hour and a half away by car.""

Keith teaches music at the school and has a part time gig at a local symphony as a cellist.  He doesn't like teaching much and has a big audition to play full time which would also take him to the city.  Megan would like for Keith to remain a teacher as the job is steady and she prefers her suburban lifestyle.  Lauren is a typical teenage girl.  She's on the swim team, smokes a little, drinks a little and has a little sex with a guy she likes.  By now, I suspect you know where this is all going.

After Sophie dazzles Keith and his class with her musical ability, he starts to pay attention.  And Sophie becomes sympathetic to Keith's desire to fulfill his musical dreams.  In a brief sequence we see Keith, alone, sifting through old photo of his teen years playing a guitar in a rock band.  If only... Frankly I was mesmerized by the longing glances, brief touches and wordless energy between the clearly attracted Sophie and Keith.  Moralistic and ethical issues aside, I've rarely seen such pent up emotion, which of course must be contained, if only for a while.  Doremus and his cinematographer use a lot of close-ups of the couple's faces, hands and especially the eyes.  The movie had a hold of me right up to the 3rd act when a series of ridiculous coincidences had me shaking my head.  Still the sexual tension is palpable in the will-they-or-won't-they dramatic dance.

The Blu ray transfer looks exceptional.  It comes with a 1080p encoding and a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, close enough to the original theatrical release.  The movie seems to be purposely shot with a soft lens.  Colors are fine but not a central focus.  Detail is excellent as is the overall look.  The audio includes a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and is very good.  What is especially noticeable is Dustin O'Halloran's score.  He's a carryover from ""Like Crazy"" as well where he composed and played piano throughout that film.  The rest of the audio is very clear without any bombastic sound events beyond the music.  I did have to crank up my AV Receiver quite a bit louder than usual for whatever reason.  There are only English SDH subtitles available on the version I watched.  Extras include a trailer, and interview with Doremus and a short ""making of"" piece.",1417737600,3,3073,4.6437847866419295
5855578,5,B00DTUF49A,"Surprised by some of the feedback. Really enjoyed this movie. If you're into this kind of story-line, then you won't be disappointed. Great acting, excellent build up, and sizzling chemistry between the two leads.",1416614400,,213,5.294117647058823

Maybe not an easy film for women to watch, though the film itself is quiet eye candy, scene after scene. Multiple betrayals that *do* result in actual consequences. Guy Pearce adds a new film genre --adult drama-- without violence, and all about what family means, to his extraordinary career.

If I were a marriage counselor or shrink, I would make this quietly brilliant, non-sappy film REQUIRED WATCHING FOR COUPLES. It's never sappy, but shows real consequences of the stupid choices we make that make us miserable. Kudos for no serious physical violence.",1414454400,6,833,5.072992700729927

Many things have changed since I was there - an imported hand-carved fireplace from Germany is no longer present - at least from what I can see.  My great grandfather built that home in the early 1900's for $6000!  It sits on an acre of land, and had a beautiful garage/apartment of the same design that burned in a fire when I was a teen.  Very neat to see a home in a movie that you know all about and remember mowing the grass and painting the porch as a kid.  My 90-something old grandfather would paint the sides and use aluminum paint on the roofing. Just one of the many old beautiful homes in the Sea Cliff area.

It left me with the impression that Guy Pearce's character was immature and cowardly.  It takes great courage to tell a spouse you are leaving them, but to run off like a child running away from home is a ridiculous choice for a grown man.
