949771,1,6304877528,"Have you ever wondered why their weren't more horror films made based around golf? Well that would be because the only one ever made blows so haaaaaaard. This movie seriously made Sid want to smash his computer in with his new graphite driver. The premise alone had us wondering why on earth we were even going to bother, but then became inspired by our recent hilarious trip to Colonial Terrace. Southern Sid came up to visit Northern Sid to have the typical fantastic day filled with golf, brew, Al Green, & food. First stop was the old CT at the fine hour of 9 am for a nice round of 18. Unfortunately the blue hairs were out in full force and pushed Sid's day back at least an hour and a half. After being harassed by Fulton's brother we hit the greens, had a blast, and got yelled at by the park ranger for skipping holes. So yeah, that's the reason we watched Blades.

This nightmare movie is centered around Mr. Screams dad as he gets prepared for the annual Tall Grass Country Club pro-am tournament. A couple days before all the geezers and golf machines show up, a couple bodies turn up mangled in the sand trap. Obviously this would be bad for Colonial Terrace, and out of fear Santa wouldn't show up to shank countless shots into the woods, they do all they can to cover up the murders. Eventually news of new murders spreads sending panic among the golf community. As they seek out a killer they come to realize a possessed lawnmower is the murderer. Yeah a lawnmower....pancakes. Despite numerous failed attempts Mr. Screams dad finally takes the death machine out with an explosive golf ball.

This movie is honestly one of the most useless pieces of cinema ever created. It's a disgrace to the world of B movies. The real downfall was the story being so pointless and uninteresting in every sense. When the scariest concept you can conjure up is a lawnmower cruising around chopping up dim whited golfers, you're not speaking our language. It would have been scarier to have Max running around in his sky blue Nike shirt smacking people with his Taylor Made 9 iron. Or maybe you could have just videotaped Santa getting his cart stuck in the mud followed by crying for an hour and a half, that would be a five star event there. They could have even had the quicksand that Santa lost his shoe in as the killer.",1305676800,,2325,4.507109004739337

Squirming for protection as each Golfer is chased by a Vengeful Power Mower that has no time or inclination to talk to you about it's personal  problems.  So, sit back, make sure your relaxed and prepare yourself to  enjoy a true snipping, snapping, biting, chewing, power tool with a mind of  it's own...",943574400,2,374,4.606060606060606
7880846,4,6304877528,"Even though not much killing or gore was involved it kept me watching it til the end. Another film by Troma that provides you with all the ok actors, cheap props, and  cheesy lines you come to enjoy from them. One of the better films I've seen so far.",1506988800,,251,4.122448979591836
7880847,4,6304877528,"Blades is about as slick, polished and professional looking as it gets from Troma. A classic from the VHS rental age, Blades is an enjoyable way to kill a few hours if you're into B-movie horror, T&A and gore. The film is produced on demand (meaning they don't press the disc until you order it). As far as I can tell from my copy there is no menu screen. The film begins at the 5 minute mark. Preceding it is a snazzy little video featuring snippets from several Troma movies backed by the music of Motorhead (I think, sure sounds like the late great Lemmy Kilmister- RIP).",1502150400,,574,4.373831775700935
7880848,5,6304877528,"Budget but faithful lampoon of Jaws. Cheesy fun, gratuitous blood, and a clipping-catch bag opening scene. A true gem from the dollar VHS bin.",1477526400,,142,4.958333333333333

7880852,2,6304877528,"I would say this isn't the worst movie ever made.  In fact, for Troma, this is pretty decent.  I am not a fan of most of their other ones but this is one of my favorites.  The constant references to Jaws was pretty funny but they definitely missed out on the best line they could have used when they offered Deke 20,000 to kill the lawnmower.  I think Deke should have said, ""For that, you get the wheels, the blades, the whole damn thing!"" That would have been hilarious!",1440806400,,472,4.269662921348314
7880853,2,6304877528,Didn't really like this Troma film.  The killer lawnmower didn't kill many people and it way too much dialogue for me.,1440201600,,118,4.619047619047619
7880854,1,6304877528,"I wasn't prepared for the vulgar filth in the previews and my son was sitting here with me but even if he wasn't I didn't want to see it!
I threw it in the trash!
The only reason I gave it one star is because it was required to send the message",1413849600,,244,3.7115384615384617
7880855,2,6304877528,"While I loved The Toxic Avenger, Class of Nuke'em High, Terror Firmer, Even Invasion of the Space Preachers was pretty funny, I could not love this movie. The actors were unlikable, I found I didn't care about them. The jokes were too corny, and all of them were generally unattractive. Stupid decisions, too much predictability, and not nearly enough going on. Most of the time you had no idea who/what was killing people. Sure the body pile of teenagers was great, and made me hopeful, off to a good start, but then it was followed by blah blah blah. You never really ""saw"" anything, and when the monster machine was revealed, I rolled my eyes. This one was a dud! I couldn't even finish it! I got to the part where the two main characters and the red hearing were waging war in the van, waiting out and baiting the machine with bales of hay and balloons, and hit fast forward. I would have hit stop entirely but after investing so much time I was hoping the machine would win in the end. It didn't. The only thing that really got a rise out of me happened after all the credits had rolled and the hedge trimmer revved on it's own, the screen said ""just when you thought it was safe to trim"". This isn't even one of those so horrible you have to see it types. Take my advice don't waste your time, and certainly don't waste your money!",1335744000,2,1337,4.352
