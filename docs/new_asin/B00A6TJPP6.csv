8547130,4,B00A6TJPP6,"Kai could of done a much better job. It does however have Jordy ripping at a bunch of premium places with insane full rotation airs. Only Tom Curren talks about him., one interview???? I wanted more Jordy, more history but it is really a short film only 6 chapters. His airs supermans, and rail surfing are unreal but the detail and who Jordy is is yet to be seen. The Bruce Movie and especially Scratching the Surface really do a great job of offering a personal bio perspective. This film is short lived due to length, lack of bonus footage,  and Kai's obvious lack of attention to the overall story. I still gave it a 4 because the slow motion cam of Jordy and Julian is incredible. Next Jordy movie should be longer, with more friends talking and more questions to Jordy. Modern collective much better andactually has parts of chapter 26 from modern collective?? in movie. Aloha",1360454400,2,882,4.582278481012659
