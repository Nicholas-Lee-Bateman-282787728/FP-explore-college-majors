5103021,5,B007PF5U8A,"The documentary itself is outstanding. One of the best sports documentaries I have seen. It is narrated by Daniel Stern and has some great unseen footage, at least by me, of Bird at ISU and his early days with the Celtics. No complaints. Awesome.

The games they included?

Come on!

If you are going to include a Portland game, include the 1985 game with the greatest buzzer beater ever. That game was awesome. It was epic. It was huge.

I agree with his 60 point game. He was hitting all kinds of shots. It was great.

I agree with the last quarter of the shootout with Wilkins.

But no games against the Lakers or Sixers, which were his most epic and memorable? That's where they went off the rail with this set.",1340064000,8,715,4.378787878787879

5103024,4,B007PF5U8A,I love Bird. He was a total hero of my childhood. Made me appreciate hard work and hillbillies. I missed this great video so I recently purchased and watched again. Makes me wish instead that they would have had better quality video back in the day and I'm hopeful that 30 for 30 or some other franchise will retell the Bird story.,1450915200,,331,4.354838709677419

On the other hand, there doesn't seem to be much in the way of story line, just clips of greatest wins, plays, etc. I didn't even bother to watch the second video and gave the set away.",1426550400,,304,4.648148148148148

5103041,5,B007PF5U8A,"This is an incredible documentary about one of the greatest to ever play the game. Bird went to 5 NBA Finals capturing 3 titles, and is the only player ever to win 3 consecutive MVP Awards. The documentary is incredible, tracing Bird's humble beginnings as a poor rural kid from a dysfunctional home, to college dropout, to College player of the year and NBA greatness. But the best part about this Special Edition is the inclusion of a second disc with three of Bird's greatest games. This is a must have for young and old, and a reminder of the NBA's greatest era.",1418688000,,566,4.504854368932039

Amazon customer service is really head and shoulders above anyone elses.  The menus and such are terrible, with only the most basic navigation.  The video quality was excellent however. It really took me back to watch some of these old games, what a treat.",1407542400,,406,4.757142857142857

5103053,5,B007PF5U8A,This video is a must for young and old alike!  I'm a mom and I was even glued to the t.v. while my husband and kids were watching it.  Very interesting and motivating.  L.B. was such a good role model...great attitude/work ethic etc.  Video leaves that impression with the kids.,1389398400,8,278,4.5
5103054,5,B007PF5U8A,"Really well done...The Hick from French Lick....to me, one of the five greatest players of all time. And since I graduated from Indiana University, I was chagrined he signed, left, and then went to Indiana State Teachers College. I was never much of an NBA fan, yet when Larry and Magic rebuilt the NBA, I watched the Celtics until Bird retired.  He is just so great, it's hard to explain. And this video brings back his superb work ethic, and uncanny talents. Really happy I bought this DVD. Kent Oram",1388016000,2,502,4.5777777777777775
5103055,5,B007PF5U8A,"""Larry Bird: A Basketball Legend"" is a superlative documentary!  I first saw this stellar documentary on VHS.  Yet, in any format it illustrates, documents, depicts the pure essense of one of the greatest basketball players in the history of the game...Larry Joe Bird!  Before I became a NBA basketball fan, I was a college basketball fan.  Specifically, a ""DePaul Blue Demon's"" fan.  During the era of Mark Aquirre, Teddy Grubbs, Terry Cummings, Skip Dillard...and the crew.  And, what a crew it was!  Yet, after seeing Larry Joe Bird in the ""Final Four,"" I was like...who is this guy?  I mean, 6-9 and passing like a guard! Prolific scorer!  Did I mention rebounding machine?  I mean this guy could do..and did it all!  And, even though Indiana State loss against Magic Johnson's Michigan State team, you knew from seeing this man, that he was going to be something special in the NBA.  As result of Larry Bird, I became a ""Boston Celtic Fan.""  As a result of becoming a ""Boston Celtic Fan,"" I learned about Boston's great basketball tradition: Big, Bad Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, Sam Jones, Dave Havlicek...Red Auerbach and all the rest!  Also,an Antione Walker fan! For me, Larry Bird epitomizes what it is to work hard, to apply oneself and get the optimum result... becoming the comsummate player, the complete package!  Yet, there is so much more to this man that they called ""Larry Legend.""  He was and is a very honest, candid man.  A very genuine, sincere..good person.  Who was and still is not afraid to say what he feels.  And, I love that about him!!  But don't take my word.  Do yourself a favor and see for yourself!",1380844800,,1630,4.709219858156028
5103056,5,B007PF5U8A,"My husband grew up in French Lick at the same time Larry Bird did.  He is always interested in all things Larry Bird, not just because they are from the same town, but because Larry Bird is the type if person that other people look up to.  He has amazing skills and honesty and integrity.  This dvd is a favorite of my husband, not only for the portrayal of Larry Bird, but also the footage of French Lick back in the day.",1378512000,4,422,4.121951219512195
5103057,5,B007PF5U8A,"It's Larry. Unless you are a 76ers fan or a Laker degenerate How could you not love it?

It's not the most amazing movie ever. It's the same music you hear on every NBA Entertainment Movie and Daniel Stern's narration veers into the Cheesy, but the incredible interviews with Bill Walton more than make up for it.

If you love Larry, you need this movie.",1372032000,,354,4.430769230769231
5103058,5,B007PF5U8A,"I love this DVD. It's pretty well done, and does paint a well-rounded picture of the legend, but I was left wanting more... I feel it covers a breadth of information, but could benefit from another 30-minutes of time spent on some of the key events in his career. I would recommend this as a staple in any Celtics fan home DVD collection.",1371686400,3,338,4.380952380952381
5103059,5,B007PF5U8A,"I grew up an Atlanta Hawks fan. Dominique Wilkens, John Drew, Pete Marovich, etc. Never liked Boston and especially Larry Bird. Watch an ESPN special about him and was like, Wow, this guy is pretty amazing. I ordered this and have watched it at least a dozen times. He is truly one of greatest sports legends of all time of any sport.",1370995200,5,334,4.403225806451613

5103061,5,B007PF5U8A,This video shows how amazing and brilliant Larry Bird was to the game of basketball. It highlights how he had the uncanny ability to be 3 steps ahead of the other ball players and outsmart them to win games.  Great presentation and game highlights show how he is arguably the greatest all around basketball player ever to play.,1370131200,4,327,4.637931034482759

8520312,5,B007PF5U8A,"My family has watched quite a few basketball documentaries.  There's something about the combination of this particular story, this human being, this career, and the way the documentary was put together, (the editing, shape and build of it) that make it something special, and our all-time favorite.  Really well done.",1497398400,2,318,5.34
8520313,5,B007PF5U8A,I purchased a VHS version of this about 25 years ago and watched it more than I probably should admit.  I'm thankful to have it on DVD so I can finally watch it again. This is a well made production covering the life of Larry Bird. Great highlights and commentary throughout. The three bonus games included are great to watch....not only to see Bird but the rest of the Celtics who together played the game as it should be played.,1492300800,2,430,4.375
