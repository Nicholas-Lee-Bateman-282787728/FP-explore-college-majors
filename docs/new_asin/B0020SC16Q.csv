This is a great volume. It's probably one of the best volumes yet. That's a really hard call to make because all of them have been excellent. This anime is getting better all the time, and I think I'm getting addicted. It's one of those that makes you want to stay up late, even though you have to be up before the sun comes up tomorrow. I definitely recommend watching it, but probably on the weekend.",1357776000,,1015,4.342105263157895
8348669,5,B0020SC16Q,"This review should be for the whole series.  I had to buy Vol 7 and 8 here, and the discs are pristine and play back smoothly.  The packaging is slim cases with a cardboard keeper... which can get tattered over time.  But they came in good shape.  No complaints.  As for the anime, it's fun and intriguing and you start to fall in love with the characters pretty quickly.  7 and 8 are the final volumes and well worth owning.  The show ends in a good way, leaving the viewer satisfied with the outcome.  No strange endings leaving you to feel as if the last episodes were written by entirely new writers.  Sure, it has sad moments, and maybe some people would like the adventure to continue for 15 seasons like that other garbage Japan pumps out like oil, but if you understand the characters, then you can enjoy this as a full series, complete and whole.",1302998400,,855,4.3949044585987265

The volume 7 DVD started sputtering from the beginning credits and finally stopped playing during the first episode.  Fortunately, Adult Swim finally finished the series the third time they started showing it.  The volume 8 DVD played fine.  Media Blasters is handling the DVD distribution in the US.  They need to improve their quality control in DVD production.  I have already ordered a second volume 7 DVD.  Let's hope this one plays.",1272067200,,1268,4.589285714285714
8348673,5,B0020SC16Q,"Moribito is a great anime mini-series.  Based in an alternate Japanese setting, it is the story of a female guard and her last commision, the younger son of the Mikado.  Good graphics, solid story, good pacing.  As good as, or better than, The Twelve Kingdoms.",1264550400,,260,4.733333333333333
