8332342,5,B001P7YDV4,"I've seen several versions of Hamlet, and this is the most effective as tragedy of them all.  There is balance among the parts of it and a personal touch with the characters that makes it so compelling.  My first experience of it occurred in 1949 when I saw it multiple times.  The same personal sense of the predicament came through to me then, and now after all these years I'm even more touched by what real lives must go through when they meet with conflict not of their own (or in a sense their own).  Now, more than 60 years later, I'm more accepting of the need not to judge others in their problems.
The black and white photography is effective in this version of Hamlet, as is the feeling of doing a play in the open echo-like halls of the bleak castle Elsinore.  The timing of scenes, and Olivier's freedom with some of the lines and succession are appropriate.  In a novel that came out not long after the Hamlet movie (Catcher in the Rye) the kid who narrates the story says Olivier acted too much like a general.  This is a true assessment in some of the scenes, but it doesn't harm the sense of playing a part and caring whether audience can relate to the tragedy.",1408665600,,1178,4.351598173515982
8332343,5,B001P7YDV4,"A play by William Shakespeare. The story is of the decision and indecision of the Prince of Denmark, Hamlet, he is informed of an evil deed ""Murder most foul"" by the ghost of his father.  The perpetrators are his uncle and mother who remarry before the funeral meats are cold. How will Hamlet cope and are there further plots against him?

Just as when you think about the Ten Commandments, you think of Charlton Heston as Moses in ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956). Everyone knows that Hamlet looks like Laurence Olivier. There are longer and flashier versions out now, many quite good however this is the one that will always come to mind. I will not attempt to interpret the meaning behind the story however most of the acting and all of the words are quite clear. If you are afraid of misinterpreting the play, take a course on it. Otherwise this will play stands on its own merit and you will be fascinated.",1347580800,,908,4.564417177914111
