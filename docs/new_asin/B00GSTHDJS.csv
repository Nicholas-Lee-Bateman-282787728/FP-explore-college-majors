8626923,3,B00GSTHDJS,I really like biblical movies but this movie is done with voice narration explaining what happens in each scene. I'm not fond of movies where the actors are not speaking their lines in the movie. Sorry but I give it 3 stars.,1523318400,,224,4.357142857142857

Some of the background music was not needed, but overall this is a great way of teaching the bible and encouraging faith.",1468713600,3,263,4.617021276595745

8626928,5,B00GSTHDJS,"Gem or a product showing you the difference of 1950's and Faith compared to the movies today like the TV's ""Bible series"" and movies like Noah and Exodus. Truly something the whole family can watch and quotes scripture, something it seems today that most don't like to do. Maybe the power of the scriptures is too much for the ungodly to hear.",1447891200,5,343,4.548387096774194
