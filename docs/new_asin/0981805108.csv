If you like David Cook's book ""Seven Days in Utopia: Golf's Sacred Journey"" you will like this DVD.
Jim Hardy and Stan Utley are great and you will recognize some of the story lines from the book and the movie when David Cook does his segment.",1386201600,,318,4.406779661016949

Found the portion on Utley to be really really helpful.  I was also pleasantly surprised by Mr. Hardy's explanations of the 1 and 2 plane swings.  I had heard his theories before, but didn't really understand them until watching this DVD. I've since purchased his DVD's and books.  And still find this DVD to be he best of the bunch when it comes to simply explaining the two swings and why someone would choose to try one over the other.

I agree with the first poster, the only thing that would be better is if they could have had some shots of actual swings using either Mr. Hardy or Mr. Utley's techniques.  All in all found the video to be a great addition to my library.

7795018,4,0981805108,"Absolutely phenomenal DVDs.  The only way they would be better is if they were a bit longer and included videos of Utley actually chipping or pitching.

The two DVDs are a recording of indoor sessions that Hardy, Cook, and Utley gave to an auditorium audience. Hardy starts off explaining two-plane and one-plane swings.  He shows you how to tell which of the two is natural for you.  What I found most valuable was his pointing out things that you shouldn't be doing for the type of swing you had (i.e., if you are a one-plane swinger then you shouldn't be doing xyz). Very good session!

Cook then has a sports psychology segment, which is great.  I just wish it were longer.  (A friend has Cook's the four-CD ""The Psychology of Tournament Golf"" and says it is fantastic). Cook is a very inspirational speaker and does a good job. If you haven't already done it, get his ""Golf's Sacred Journey: Seven Days at the Links of Utopia"" book. Wonderful!

The second DVD has Utley explaining his approach to chipping, pitching, and putting.  It is very good and complement to his ""The Art of the Short Game"" book.  I only wish that he hit some balls, even into a net.  He just talked and swung a club. Utley has some unconventional techniques that I've come to love over this past year.  Genius stuff.",1225065600,2,1295,4.558441558441558
