5722538,1,B00CI622PA,Too much about  xtianity and not enough about the Jewish Temple.  If I wanted to watch a promotion for xtianity I would of went to church.  Perhaps they could of had it be more from a scientific and archaelogical perspective combined with old testament scripture.,1381795200,2,263,4.8
5722539,4,B00CI622PA,"It seemed plausible to follow an eyewitness, Josephus, to establish the exact locations of the temples.  If their hypothesis be valid, I wonder why the Jewish people still consider them under the Mosque.  The documentary was well done and certainly was informative. I would like to have access to more scholarship on the subject.  I would have given the film five stars had I been thoroughly convinced that the information was trustworthy,  I would recommend the documentary to teachers and bible scholars,",1380844800,10,506,5.134146341463414

5722541,5,B00CI622PA,"ABSOLUTELY a must see DVD. Makes a very compelling case that the ""approved"" site of the Jewish temples was actually the site that was the Roman fortress Antonia. Makes the case for the true location of the temple site being located just south of the ""approved"" site in the old City of David. The DVD visit's many sites, gives many illustrations and explanations of how and why the original Mt. Zion isn't there any longer, and goes into great detail about the Spring of Siloam. How did the water get up to the temple area? There is an answer to that question. You'll see some of the actual plumbing that made it happen. BUT - - - if you decide to order this DVD do so from outside of Amazon. My order was on hold for three months while Amazon ==> tried <== to locate a copy. In frustration I finally just ordered the dang thing from the original producers along with the companion book ""The Temples That Jerusalem Forgot"".

5722542,5,B00CI622PA,"There will be many who review this without watching it.  It is therefore my duty to offer my review as someone who watched it and will watch it many times.

Take it for what it's worth.  This film presents a theory about the actual location of the first and second temples, and Jerusalem itself.  The evidence is compelling and provides the viewer with references and the opportunity to back it all up.

The images and footage around Jerusalem are HD and the best I have seen short of actually visiting the Holy Land.  Even if you want to watch it simply for the tour and not the information presented, you will not be disappointed.",1378944000,49,632,4.5

5722544,2,B00CI622PA,"Interesting that this work is subtitled ""The Last Sign of Christ's Return"" yet is produced by a Ken Klein who as a Jew, assumedly does not believe in a supernatural return from the dead of Jesus. This tips its hand to what it really is, another in a long line of control devices used to trick fundamentalist Christians into believing that Jewish and Israeli power is something they're obligated to aid and abet, and will somehow benefit these duped Christians. These fundamentalists should know that their TV evangelists who push this same line, (that they should support israel), are bought and paid for by (or blackmailed by) organized Jewish power. Also interesting is that in producer Ken Klein's exploration of this coming Jewish temple, he has nothing to say about how the hate-filled Jewish holy book, the Talmud, espouses how Jews are to gain rule over all the world and the soulless non-human animals in human form who will serve them (that would be all us non-jews) from a world capital in Jerusalem. International Jewry has been working towards this is in an organized way for hundreds of years using their financial control of usury over the nations of the world, and will eventually cause unimaginable suffering through catastrophic war and deliberate economic crashes to bring people to a helpless submissive state of surrender to Jewish world rule from Jerusalem. THAT'S what your fundamentalist christian preachers are supporting when they tell you you should want to see a powerful Israel and another jewish temple.",1378598400,3,1532,5.035433070866142

I was interested to find out Chuck Missler goes into this view also, if you haven't seen it, and you're inserested in the place Yeshua (Jesus) calls ""My Father's House,"" this could be a good video for you.

5722548,5,B00CI622PA,Very interesting especially having read Dr Martin's book and investigating all the facts myself in a trip to Israel in 2010.  Directly East from the center of the Old City of David is a high hill with large trees which gives a direct view into the Temple.  I imangined Jesus hanging from one of those trees with two others.

5722555,5,B00CI622PA,"We watched this video several times via Amazon Prime and finally decided we needed our own copy. Shipping was very fast from Questar, Inc ! This video is controversial in that it  goes against ""the established, conventional wisdom"" of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem,  However, the presenters make a very powerful case about the location of the second Temple. Please keep in mind that many, if not most academics, are heavily invested in the accepted belief that the site of the Al-Aqsa Mosque is the site of the 2nd Temple and not the Fortress Antonia. This video makes powerful arguments that the ""Western Wall"" is actually a supporting wall for the site of the Roman Fortress Antonia and that Herod's Temple or the Second Temple was, in fact, located in a different part of Jerusalem near the Gihon spring.

5722567,1,B00CI622PA,"This theory is absolutely rubbish. It ignores Biblical passages, such as when the Bible specifically provides the location of the Temple Mount in 2 Samuel 24:16, ""When the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD relented from the calamity and said to the angel who destroyed the people, 'It is enough! Now relax your hand!' And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.""

First, the angel was outside the City of David and had to be at a higher ground in order to stretch out his hand over the city. Second, the Angel was standing by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. Threshing floors are located on high ground in order to use the wind to separate the chaff from the wheat. It is also for this reason threshing floors are located outside the city.

Another reference to the Temple Mount is in the Torah. In Bereishis (Genesis) 22:4 ""Abraham raised his eyes and perceived the place from afar."" The location of the Temple Mount is a high place that can be seen from a distance. The location of the Beis HaMikdash (Temple) in this theory does not meet that criteria.

This theory and movie severely misinterpret Jesus' words when says in Luke 21:5-6, ""And while some were talking about the temple, that it was adorned with beautiful stones and votive gifts, He said, 'As for these things which you are looking at, the days will come in which there will not be left one stone upon another which will not be torn down.'"" In context, Jesus (and again in Matthew 24:1) is specifically speaking of the Temple and the Temple buildings (e.g., the Azarah) and not the supporting structure. In addition, since there is no archeological evidence to back up this theory, they have an easy out by saying everything was destroyed because Jesus said it would.

In addition, this theory highly values certain estimations by Josephus regardling the size of the Temple Mount but discards other estimations given by him. In his work The War of the Jews, Josephus says that the square area for the Temple Mount was widened on three sides and, thus, doubled the size of the original Temple Mount, Accordingly, in the fifteenth year of his reign, Herod rebuilt the Temple, and encompassed a piece of land about it with a wall; which land was twice as large as that before enclosed. (The War of the Jews 1.401). The Temple Mount in this theory does not take into account the expansion of the Temple Mount. This is due to the fact that the site of the Temple Mount in this theory cannot contain such a large area.

This theory also supposes that the Jewish people have only been visiting the Western Wall (i.e., the Kotel) since 16th century. However, Jewish people have been praying at the Kotel for centuries before. A document entitled The Scroll of Achimaatz dates back to 1050 CE and references the Kotel as a place of continual prayer.  It also mentions a synagogue at the Kotel. Lastly, the Midrash records in Eichah Rabbatti (written between 400 CE to 600 CE) that three of the Temple Mounts retaining walls were destroyed, while the Western Wall remained.

As a side note, why does Kevin Klein wear sunglasses all the time, even when in front of a green screen? Regardless of content, this movie could have benefited from some professional editing.",1465430400,3,3305,4.678141135972461

5722584,5,B00CI622PA,"Is the Temple Mount in Jerusalem the site of the 2nd Jewish Temple constructed by Herod, and eventually burned by Titus in 70 AD?  Probably not.

This very well done on-site documentary takes the viewer back in time and discusses the probable location of the site of the 2nd Temple from the writing of historian Flavius Josephus (Joseph Ben Matthias). Ken Klein concludes that the Temple Mount is in actuality the Fortress Antonia, and that the Temple site and old City of David (as prophesied by Jesus) has be utterly destroyed (not one stone left upon another).

The documentary is based on Miller's work and is carefully and critically produced. If the thesis is correct (very compelling arguments) then the conclusion changes everything regarding the reconstruction of the Temple about a third of a mile South East of the Temple Mount (actually the fortress Antonia).

I very much enjoyed the documentary not only for the search for the Temple site, but also for the on-site cinematography and present day perspective; very well done.",1457222400,,1038,4.982658959537572

The topics of the City of David, Mt. Zion, the Gihon Spring, and others make this film a ""must have"" for your home. To me, the film fits in the ""documentary/education"" genre, and provides good visual aids and historical, archeological, and current-day evidence to support its claims. Although I have a different eschatological view than the film, I strongly encourage people to watch it because it makes Matthew 24 and other passages like it come to life and the specific claims of Jesus Christ regarding the Temple are shown with clarity. In this sense, it is a ""faith-building"" film that would be great for a small-group Bible study, or to show to a group of friends.

Cornuke's ""The Temple."" Cornuke's book also uses Scripture, both the Tanakh and the New Covenant to show that the Temple was below the much larger Fort Antonia and many other interesting facts. The real key to understanding the location of the Temple was the need for abundant source of flowing water. The Acra has none, but it has plenty of cisterns. The fact that the Acra stands has a very simple explanation, that is, the city of Jerusalem was pretty much destroyed and the Temple site was leveled... why would the Romans destroy their own Ft.

This despite years and years of excavations all over the Gihon and City of David area. There is however conclusive proof for the site of the temple mount...this being the stone of trumpeting found at the southwest corner of the temple mount years ago.

5722610,2,B00CI622PA,"I have watched this DVD a couple months back. Which is based off of Dr. Ernest Martin's research on Solomon's Temple in his book, ""The Temples that Jerusalem forgot."" The film heavily focused on Josephus, it gave very little about Avi Yonah's background who did Herod's Temple Model, and it had very little Scripture as well. It has about three to four interviews, the main interview is a scenic route in Israel, and has Computer Graphic Animation about the Temple location being over the Gihon Springs. It also shows a Crescent Moon curve in on a specific area where they claim that Herod's Temple was built. As for the visuals, they are in high definition, which is nice for those who have never been to Israel. However, I'm gracefully giving it 2 stars, because the information brings in some questions. Also, their is Logical Fallacies in the film though, so be prepared to see them. If I were to bring the Logical Fallacies into view, then we have some more questions to answer, but I will just do the Basics with this film..

How many times in Israel's Land has been changed and/or decimated in her history?
Whenever the Jewish people were captured in Babylon, Assyria, and the Diaspora. The first time was about 50 years that the Jewish people were living outside of their Land.
If the Jewish people weren't living their, then Gentiles were placed in Israel who were also captured by other nations in the Land of Israel. This would be recorded in The Bible in The Book of 2nd Kings, Chapters 14 through 24, or do a Word Study for Israel captured and Judah captured.
The following was about 2000 years when Rome destroyed it.
It became a desert after that happened and we simply don't know the location of Solomon's Temple and Herod's Temple because of Israel's past History, so it's speculation and theory...

As for Josephus, he was writing for Rome, so is their a bias as well? A lot of Jewish people reject the writings of Josephus because they felt betrayed by him when he surrendered to Rome, and he was writing for Vespasian. So the answer is yes, their is bias their.
Example: Who has more control of a movie project? The producer or the writer(s)? In other words, who's paying for the film to be made? The Producer. This same principle applies because we are talking about Josephus' life here, and Vespasian could have him murder at any point in time..

This film brings in other factors as well, such as Eschatology (Future Events, Last Days/Things, Prophecy) views. The film favors the Covenantal point of view, that when this Temple or temple is re-built that Christ will come back. At the same time, the claim is the Muslim Mosque is the Anti-Christ temple, but who is Anti-Christ? I mean, shouldn't the whole world know by now who the Anti-Christ is? The Books and Chapters in The Bible counter this film: Daniel 7:25, 8:25, 11:36; Isaiah 14:14; Ezekiel 28:2; Revelation 13:5.
In 1st Thessalonians, Chapters 4 and 5 explain the situation differently about the Temples. The same can be said in 2nd Thessalonians as well. The factors of Doctrines come into view, such as: God, Jesus Christ, Salvation, The Church, Rapture, Israel, Gentiles, Jews, The Holy Spirit, 8 Major Covenants in the Bible, The Ages (Timeframes, or the word that Covenantalists don't like or hate: Dispensations) in the Bible, The Great Tribulation and Tribulation Temple, and Millennial Kingdom, and Millennial Temple.
The Book of Zechariah, specifically Chapter 14:4 how Christ will come back to the Earth, and The Land of Israel will be changed.
The Book of Ezekiel, starting at Chapter 40 through Chapter 48, or for a shorter read, go to Revelation 21, which shows The Millennial Kingdom, the Millennial Temple, the Millennial Jerusalem in Israel. After the 1000 year Rule and Reign of Christ, this Millennial Kingdom is really The Eternal Kingdom.",1439510400,,3842,4.80060422960725

This documentary prompted me buy the Ernest Martin book that is its basis, which then led me to do some reading of Josephus, Aristeas et al to see for myself what they had to say about the temple they saw as eye witnesses.  There is no question that the true location of the temples (Solomon's, Zerubbabel's, Simon's and Herod's--in that order) was lost or at least misplaced until a small handful of people apparently picked up the thread again just a few decades ago.  The current so-called Temple Mount under the Dome of the Rock is really the old Roman Fortress Antonia, not the site of any of the temples, and the rock under the Dome is the Praetorium where Jesus stood before Pilate.  That factual history became blurred with time and then lost to the institutional memory of the Jews as they were forbidden from entering Aelia Capitolina and then Jerusalem for very long periods of time.  By the time of the Crusaders, the legend of the so-called Temple Mount was well established while the real temple site languished as a nearby refuse dump.  There is also the story of how a charismatic Jewish mystic established the current Western Wall as a special place for faithful Jews--in 1570.  Up to that time, there was no such reverence for the SW section of the wall that surrounds the Dome of the Rock.  The story is much better than the quality of either the book or the film, but both are worth spending some time with if you are someone who values the Hebrew Testament, the Christian Testament and the historical context of both treasures.",1432944000,4,1573,4.673913043478261

Klein readily admits this, and gives well-deserved credits to Dr. Ernest L. Martin's research, and even shows a video clip of Dr. Martin in this film, and also interviews one of Dr. Martin's associates. So you may want to check out who Dr. Ernest L. Martin was by looking up his biography on Google, and perhaps even reading Dr. Martin's book. Dr. Martin had experience working on Archaeological digs, but his theory was based primarily on ancient literary sources, particularly the works of the ancient Jewish historian, Josephus, who was an eyewitness of the destruction of the 2nd
Temple by the Romans in 70 A. D. and who was personally thoroughly familiar with Jerusalem and its Temple before their destruction.

You may also want to check out this Biblical Archaeology Society video,: ""Locating the Herodian Temple: Old and New Theories in the light of Ancient Literary Evidence,"" by Dr. James Tabor of the University of North Carolina. This video was Copyrighted in 2000. Dr. Tabor was a close friend of Dr. Martin, and in this video he outlines Dr. Martin's theory and discusses the evidence for it, with pictures, charts, and quotes from Josephus and other ancient literary sources, in the context of at least four other scholarly theories about the location of the 2nd Temple.

5722647,5,B00CI622PA,"The host presents enticing evidence to support his research that the current ""Temple Mount"" is indeed, NOT! If his research is accurate, that would imply the Jews could build their temple now on a site he feels is the actual site of the biblical temple mount, a site currently in Jewish hands and not sought after by the Muslims.
Though his reasons are compelling, I am not fully convinced they are accurate.  The Temple Institute in the past couple of years has reported on findings such as a bell that would have been worn on the bottom of a priest's robe.  The bell was found in archeological rich leavings that were dumped in the Kidron valley by the Muslim Wakf  digging under/into the mount itself to create a greater Mosque.  Here is one link that denotes findings of wood beams dated 3500 years old.  https://www.templeinstitute.org/archive/25-07-13.htm  My opinion is that they (the wakf) are systematically removing all Jewish history or anything that could be possibly declared Jewish history.
If such findings are coming out of the current mount (though the host of the documentary, Ken Klein, claims that the current mount was actually the Antonia Fortress found in Jerusalem,)  then perhaps his research and evidence have been based on the wrong criteria.

5722652,5,B00CI622PA,"This is a video documentary largely based upon the work ""the Temples that Jerusalem Forgot"" by Earnest L. Martin and Michael S. Sanders of biblemysteries.com.

The following is my summary of their argument:

The present day Temple Mount and wailing wall had to be part of fortress Antonia, as described by Josephus and the testimonies from a couple Masada Jews who survived Masada and claimed that the temple was destroyed completely as Christ said, not leaving one stone upon the other. Of course if the outer wall of the temple still stands then Christ's prophecy was wrong in detail.(Jews used to claim that the wailing wall was actually the wall of the temple and then they conceded it wasn't possible and that it was just an outer wall.) By all accounts of Josephus' works it cannot possibly be the temple, but Temple Mount fits perfectly with his description of fortress Antonia.

In 1973 a professor designed the common model today seen of ancient Israel (Israeli museum in Jerusalem) but his designs are based off traditions established by monks hundreds of years after time of Christ. In his design of a small fortress Antonia would not be able to hold the 6000+ soilders history tells us was there. Also the models design is contrary to Josephus' detailed description of the layout of the area in its proportion to the Temple.

Another issues explained is of the understanding of Gihon Spring which prohibits the placement of the temple on Temple Mount.

Also they discuss some forgotten and overlooked history of Simon the Hasmonean who tore Mount Zion down to the bedrock before the time of Christ (during time of Maccabees) and spread the fill dirt around in the valleys and to the new Mt. Zion spot.

Common problems in our understanding are three distinct places often taken as the same place. Those places being Mt. Zion, the City of David, and Jerusalem. David's citadel was on top Mt. Zion with the temple in the city of David next to Mt. Zion. Jerusalem refers to the city that grew and expanded around that.

Around 70 A.D. the city of David was what was completely destroyed (not one stone upon another) with everything in it, including the Temple as verified by the eyewitness account of Masada Jews who escaped for their lives along with that of Josephus.

The wailing wall still stands today because it was outside of the city of David and it was a Roman fortress which the Romans would not have destroyed.

Fascinating stuff to say the least, though I have left out many details.",1421366400,2,2504,4.751152073732719

5722654,1,B00CI622PA,"There are so many inaccuracies and outright fabrications in this video that it is ridiculous to even consider it to have any validity.  How their supposed experts can hold a straight face while supporting such absurd ideas is astounding.  They start off by saying Titus, in 70 AD, destroyed Jerusalem to the ground while quoting the Bible as reference.  This is outrageous. The Biblical references to this destruction was clearly and absolutely referring to Herod's Temple and not the city of Jerusalem as a whole.  They purport that the scripture cannot be true because the Temple Mount wall still exists (it wasn't torn down to the ground).  Read the Bible and see for yourself.  The use of the Gihon spring as necessary for the function of the Temple is not supported.  The Hebrews did not build the Temple in a location so it could be supported by the spring, it was built where is was because the sacrificial stone of Abraham (on the Temple Mount) was the holiest site in the Hebrew world.  The Temple water supply is well documented and includes a large number of cisterns that provide water for the Temple functions.  To build the temple any place other than the Temple Mount and the sacrificial stone of Abraham would be an offense to God.  The ideas for this video apparently came from Ernest L. Martin and his book The Temples that Jerusalem Forgot.  An incredible amount of information is available to anyone who really wants to know the truth about this Temple, it's siting and history. The reason the producers of this video continue to support and publish such a ludicrous theory as Martin's is baffling.

5722702,4,B00CI622PA,"The modern authority on the layout of first century Jerusalem is Avi Yonah who in 1973 created a model of the ancient city, which is in the national museum of Israel. Yonah is believed to have determined the location of the Temple as it is currently understood. But was he wrong?
Ernest Martin and David Sielaff maintain that Yonah was wrong. Although he claimed to be influenced by the writings of the first century Jewish historian Josephus, Yonah actually seems to have ignored him in favor of medieval Christians who decided that the Via Dolorosa, the path of Jesus toward the cross, went through the Fortress Antonia which they located in the wrong place. By following them and the tradition that the Muslim Mosque, the Dome of the Rock, sits atop the location of the Jewish Temple, Yonah conformed to tradition, not historical facts, according to Martin and Sielaff.
No one has been able to continuously keep track of the topography of Jerusalem over the past two thousand years. The Romans destroyed the city twice, first in 70 AD and then in about 130 AD. Jews were banished for centuries after that. Naturally, new structures were built on top of ancient ones. Most notably, in the early second century, Emperor Hadrian built streets and buildings in what was called Aelia Capitolina after the banishment of the Jews. It is these streets, and nothing intact dating to the first century, that form most of the oldest structures in Jerusalem. Also, the landscape of the city has changed over the millennia not only due to natural forces such as erosion, but due to deliberate landscaping on a monumental scale, notably by Simon the Hasmonean, a century and a half before the time of Christ. Simon actually removed a large hill that may well have been the original Mount Zion. (Today, the so-called Temple Mount where the Dome of the Rock is, is erroneously considered to be Mount Zion.) Indeed, it was chiefly this removal of Mount Zion that infuriated the Essenes, the Jewish sect that left Jerusalem and moved to the desert locale called Qumran and left written records describing Simon as an evil priest.
One of the effects of Simons project was to remove the place where archeologists might later have found the Citadel of David, the fortress of one of the most famous Hebrew kings of the first millennium BC. Consequently, archeologists did not realize that the original City of David was not on the southwest hill of Jerusalem until the 1880s when two boys discovered Hezekiahs tunnel to the Gihon Spring, near the southeast ridge. If you have ever wondered why Jerusalem was built in such an otherwise inhospitable, hilly place, the proximity of an abundant spring is the reason. That was where King David built his citadel, and later Solomon built the Temple nearby. Not only that, but Ward Sanford, a hydrologist who works for the U.S. Geological Survey, has noted that the Gihon Spring is one of only a dozen natural siphon springsin the entire worldwhich means that it became possible, with only a little engineering, for the Hebrews to divert the flow of water upward through the earth and into the floor of a building they built next to the spring. This was the Temple. It was actually located near the real location of the ancient City of David, about 1/3 of a mile south of the Dome of the Rock.
What was located where the Temple Mount is currently supposed to be, then? Answer: the Fortress Antonia. Yonahs model makes the fortress much smaller than the Temple, but it was, according to Josephus and other eyewitnesses, much larger than the Temple. Josephus even said that, in approaching the back of the fortress, it was so large that it blocked the Temple from view. Further, at the southwestern corner of the fortress, was an observation tower much taller than the towers at the other corners of the fortress. This was so that the guards of the Tenth Legion who manned the fortress, could easily see into the courtyards of the Temple. At the northwestern corner was a colonnade or bridge connecting the fortress with the Temple. This allowed Roman soldiers to quickly go into the Temple courtyard if there was a riot. Yonahs model leaves out the tall tower and the colonnades.
Historical records indicate that the fortress was built on a 75-foot rock. Where is it? Underneath the Dome of the Rock, there is a deeply buried rock base. If you start measuring it from below ground, it is about 75 feet high.
Despite being smaller than the fortress, the Temple was not small. Josephus said that it extended for six hundred feet from valley to valley, meaning the Kidron Valley to the Tyropoeon Valley. This, again, would put it one third of a mile to the south of the Wailing Wall, which is at the foot of the Dome of the Rock. Here, currently, Jews from all over the world assume they are facing the original wall of the Temple rather than that of a first-century occupied military installation. If true, this analysis would mean that the Great Mosque is built on top of the location of the Fortress Antonia, an alien structure in Jerusalem to begin with. Meanwhile, the actual location of the original Temple precincts would be securely within the Jewish Quarter, where no conflict between Jewish and Muslim uses of the real estate would currently arise.
The authors and filmmakers associated with this theory are believing Christians, and consequently put store not only in reason but faith, as well. They note that Jesus, according to the gospels, predicted the destruction of the Temple: Not one stone will be left on top of another (Mark 13:2; Matthew 24:2: and Luke 21:6). As believing Christians, they are troubled that, if the Wailing Wall is really a wall of the Temple, then Jesus prediction did not literally come true, because many stones of this supposed Temple wall have been left one upon the other down to today. Was Jesus incorrect in his prediction? They would rather think not.
Meanwhile, many skeptical scholars have declared categorically that since they don't believe in psychic predictions, Jesus could not possibly have made such a prediction. Still others have noted that the idea that the conflict between Rome and the unruly people of occupied Judea would probably come to a cataclysmic end was, in the modern parlance, a no brainer. Any pessimist and even an intelligent optimist might have seen clearly that, sooner or later, the Judeans were going to revolt and the Romans would come down on them so brutallyas they always didthat they would lay waste to Jerusalem just as they had destroyed other cities such as Carthage. In other words, Jesus did not have to be a psychic to predict the destruction of Jerusalems Temple.
Indeed, it was the stated intention of the Romans both in 70 AD as well as 60 years later during the Bar Kokhba revolt, to demolish everything. So why would they have left a single wall of the Jewish Temple standing? The Romans generally did not leave a task like that half or even one-quarter unfinished. The likely explanation seems to be that they did not destroy the first century wall that remains standing because it was not the Temple but a fortress, built by King Herod for the Romans and occupied by them.",1402704000,3,7190,4.780546623794212

5722704,5,B00CI622PA,"If this is verified by the Temple Institute it will completely change how the Jews view the temple mount and where their temple really stood.  The first hand accounts from those at Massada, by Josephus, and by Mimomedes is undeniably strong evidence for where the temple really stood and where the Roman fortress is standing now. There will be a tendency to bury this information because of the ramifications of overturned traditions within all 3 religions.

5 things will occur if this information is verified by Jewish scholars:

1. The struggle to build the third temple on the Roman Fortress where the Dome of the Rock mosque stands will end after thousands of years. This Fortress once housed 6,000 Roman troops, food to feed them, horses, and other logistics.

2. The Jews are finally free to build their third temple in the correct location without disturbing any Muslim structures.

3. The Muslims will at once discover that where they built their Mosque is not holy ground at all but the location of where Herod's palace used to stand 2000 years ago.

4. The Jews will at once realize that where they have been praying at all these decades is the wrong location.

5. The Christians will at once realize that the stations of the the cross and the church of the holy sepulcher is not where Jesus walked at all on his way to the crucifixion. Evidence shows he walked east.

Very inconvenient facts very likely will be kept quiet for awhile longer.

Update: 6/17/2014  I watched it 2 more times now to get truly understand Josephus and Mimomedes was saying. It makes even more sense.

I highly recommend viewing this video, which takes a fresh look at the question of the location of past and future Jewish Temples.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Building-Health-by-Design/dp/0983012946/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Building Health by Design</a>",1382313600,6,906,5.81203007518797

5722761,4,B00CI622PA,"Informative, well documented, and thought-provoking.  If Ken Klein's arguments hold up to scrutiny, I can see how a new Temple might be built without an Israeli-Muslim confrontation.",1381795200,9,182,5.7407407407407405

To a Christian on top of all the points brought out the fact that Christ said not a stone would be left standing seals the facts.",1507766400,,179,4.294117647058823
8581951,5,B00CI622PA,I love Ken's theories. They can be shocking and yet completely plausible when viewed through the lens of scripture.  With what I've learned of God's character I have found it hard to believe He would allow the true location of His holy temple to be desecrated by the worship of a false god.  This video provides a viable explanation as to where he believes the real temple mount to be.,1505865600,,385,4.485714285714286
8581952,5,B00CI622PA,"Fascinating, engrossing video about where - exactly - the First Temple was.  This video claims that the Islamic mosque in Jerusalem is NOT actually on the Dome of the Rock.  Christianity teaches that Christ will return after the new temple is built on top of the Dome of the Rock.  Christians have always wondered how this could be accomplished - without tearing down the Islamic mosque - one of the most important mosques on the planet.  This video offers some pretty convincing evidence that the original Dome of the Rock is NOT where the mosque now stands.",1505779200,,559,4.731958762886598

8581954,5,B00CI622PA,"Excellent film and very interesting to watch, because of his presentation of evidence of the location that is correct for where the Temple of the Jews was truly located.  The film makes a lot of sense and is very relevant to anyone who cares about the coming of the Lord, and the Jews Temple location and its significance.  It is a serious much watch if you are interested in the facts surrounding the Return of Christ and the current situation of the Jews in line of rebuilding the Temple which Scripture predicts, and the amazing discovery that the location everyone has assumed is the temple site, is actually incorrect.  And the original location of the City of David and Mt Zion.  I was glued to the film, and watched it three times.",1496707200,,738,4.568181818181818
8581955,5,B00CI622PA,"It is a very basic simple, and believable, idea of where the true location of the Hebrew temple is.
Because of this discovery we now know there is an agenda to keep it secret. But for what reason?

8581957,4,B00CI622PA,Interesting.  They have to go so far down in the earth to recover their past history.  Jerusalem has so many cultures living in the city.  This film was quite the eye-opener.  It is well done and easy to understand.,1482192000,,215,4.435897435897436
8581958,4,B00CI622PA,"This film in a Biblical sense, makes one very crucial flaw.  The fact that the Bible records Jesus discussing the destruction of the temple saying, Not one stone will be left on top of another.  The film uses this to conclude that since the Wailing Wall is not completely destroyed, it must not be the temple.  Heres the critical flaw in that argument.  The film ASSUMES that the Bible was referring to the destruction by the Romans in 70 AD.  Thats a BIG assumption.  There was nothing written saying the destruction will occur in a few decades, centuries, or even millenniums.  The film makers (and many others) just assumed that the burning of the city by the Romans must have been what Jesus was talking about.  It very well might not have been.  For all we know that spoken about destruction has yet to occur.  Perhaps that spoken about destruction will occur 500 years from now.",1482105600,,884,4.608974358974359
