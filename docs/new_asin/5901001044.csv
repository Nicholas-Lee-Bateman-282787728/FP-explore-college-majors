7802652,3,5901001044,"I always enjoy Joyce Meyer's cds, books & dvds, but this one was a disappointment.  I expected more tough love, I guess.  My addictive behaviors run to gambling & drinking, but she seemed to address worrying about what others think more than anything...It was basically a rehash of other topics & books.  Definitely not worth what I paid for it!  (And, the company was AWESOME about refunding my money!)",1465862400,,403,4.797101449275362
