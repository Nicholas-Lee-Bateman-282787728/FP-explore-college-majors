8516916,1,B007HW8S2Q,"What a disappointment! Do not purchase this edition of ""Barrio Salvaje"" from DistriMax Inc., this is a cut version; missing around 10 minutes of its approximately 90 minute running-time. I was so looking forward to this one too, since it's one of the few times Maria Cardinal (my favorite Mexican beauty), plays a villain in her long film career. Oh, well! I'm staying away from low-priced DVD's, especially if they're from distributors I am not familiar with. Fair warning to all!

Love and Peace,
