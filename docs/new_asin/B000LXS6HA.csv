2717654,5,B000LXS6HA,"I've been considering doing some real estate investing and I came across a mention of this film on a Wikipedia page about gentrification. I had no idea that 1.5 hours later I would out of my seat cheering the code-violation victory of a Yoruba Priest (and amazing artist) or sobbing with grief over the death of a 39-year-old woman I have never met. Nor could I have predicted the contempt I would feel toward my own kind--white, liberal, upper-middle-class urban bohemians. And yet this documentary is not heavy-handed, and your loyalties are not foregone conclusions. They let people speak for themselves, and sometimes what they say is ugly. I hope the lessons of this film guide my every step as I venture into the real estate world.",1336176000,16,737,4.811023622047244
2717655,3,B000LXS6HA,"This movie was good, not excellent.  I was in the mood for a documentary, and through searching found Flag Wars.  Residing in Columbus, Ohio I found this  movie particularly intriguing.  I moved here after 2003 when it came out, so I had never heard of this movie.

The movie depicts the Old Towne East area of downtown Columbus, historically black in ethnicity.  A mostly gay, professional group of individuals began buying homes in the area in a sort of urban renewal project.  With housing codes being passed, many of the long time black residents were unable to repair their homes, thus forced to move.

I really wanted to take sides in this movie, and I figured that by the end I would choose one.  It's hard.  The gay characters often come off as elitist as they encroach into this blighted area, taking homes at bargain basement prices to fix up.  However, the blacks, admitting their own struggles with race and poverty, are outwardly homophobic and unwelcoming of their new neighbors.  The characters all have their flaws, and that's really the only issue I had with this documentary--I was unable to make a connection with any of them.  The moral of the story is, everyone is prejudice in some way or another.  White, black, gay, straight--we all have these preconceived notions in our head of what ""the others"" are like, blinding their true likenesses when we do finally come to encounter them.

Decide for yourself.  I'd definitely recommend this movie to anyone familiar with the Columbus area.  Those with backgrounds or interest in civil rights, gay activism, property law or real estate-especially flipping properties, urban renewals-will find this movie very appealing.  All in all it was good, not great.  Shooting over four years, you'd expect a little more.  Though most scenes were good, it left me wondering if ""this is the best the have??""  Even if I didn't live here, I would have probably enjoyed it.",1238630400,16,1925,4.861538461538461

8165251,5,B000LXS6HA,"Watch this film.

Flag Wars is set in Olde Towne East, a historically Black neighborhood of working-class homeowners in Columbus, Ohio. Many of the old homes in Olde Towne are gorgeous big family-friendly Victorians set back from the street with big steps, generous yards and 2-car driveways.

The film is spliced with scenes of gay residents discussing excitedly how many new gay couples are entering the neighborhood, or how to fix up their new fixer-upper, and these chatty sessions are then contrasted with scenes of African Americans incumbent residents more seriously sitting around discussing how their neighborhood is changing, and they have no power to stop it. How they might pull their children from a classroom taught by a gay teacher, or clucking tongues at the privilege that would come with having two male incomes in one home.

This makes neither side appear ""innocent"" because both are dancing the line between ""underdog"" status, because of their race or sexual identity, and ""bigot"" status by expressing racist or homophobic opinions. The Flag Wars story is one of complex cultural conflict where planning code and neighborhood policy is used as weaponry to arm the newcomers with even more privilege than they already possess.",1421539200,3,1245,5.1840796019900495
