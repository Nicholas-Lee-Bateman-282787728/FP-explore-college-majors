3894169,4,B002BFFDLS,"I enjoyed this movie.  It was well done and I liked the little fellow who played the ""Little Traitor"".  He acted very naturally in the role.  Alfred Molina was also quite good as the caring sergeant.  The little boy hated the British and yet found a friend in the British sergeant.  It shows that different worlds can get along if we look at people as individuals.  The viewer was also given a bit of history of the Jewish state.",1444867200,2,429,4.367088607594937

3894171,5,B002BFFDLS,"Found this to be a charming film with excellent performances by the leading actors. Although I studied this period of history in a couple of international relations classes ages ago, this light-hearted film cast an interesting and enlightening angle on a crucial period in the region's period. It's a rare thing for me to say, but I actually wanted to watch this movie  again the next night!",1444176000,,391,4.835820895522388

3894173,5,B002BFFDLS,"This was a fair and balanced view of the occupation of Israel through the eyes of a young boy. The acting was exceptional and the suspense kept me captivated. This is a wonderful movie, but I recommend that viewers with children would be ready to fast forward through some mature parts, if young children are watching. I loved the innocence of the boy and the British soldier. There is so much sex and violence in most movies. It was refreshing to watch kindness and generosity develop between the soldier and the young boy.  These two captured my heart with their open-hearted friendship. I wish we all could be so accommodating with those we don't know. This is a great movie and I highly recommend it.",1443916800,,704,4.632

3894178,5,B002BFFDLS,"I liked the evocation of Mandate-era Jerusalem, as well as the character of the little boy. I love the book that the movie comes from, ""Panther in the Basement,"" by Amos Oz.",1383436800,,173,4.4375
3894199,5,B002BFFDLS,This movie is a sleeper; what a wonderful story about a little boy befriending an English sholdier during the English occupation in Israel. A must see.,1365811200,,151,4.846153846153846
3894200,5,B002BFFDLS,"I have watched this movie over and again, and I never tire of it. The story is unique, yet believable. The characters play their parts extremely well, and the little boy hero of the movie reaches out to those who are watching in a way that is different and refreshing. His personal brilliance comes out when he speaks three or four languages onscreen without effort. He is a little ambassador to three different nations in this film, but in his innocence he doesn't even know it. I highly reccommend this movie and congratulate the filmmakers.",1365379200,,543,4.726315789473684
3894201,5,B002BFFDLS,"This movie was, in my opinion, one of the best I have seen in years. It was re-written for the screen from a book by a famous Israeli author named Amos Oz. It shows a sensitivity that goes beyond words with respect to a child's relationship with a singular member of his people's enemy, namely a British Sergeant who was a part of the Palestinian Protectorate force that was established after WWI. The movie was moving and the characters were portrayed with skill and emotional perfection. It showed a positive relationship between Arab and Jew and even a slight possibility of peace for when the UN granted the Jewish people the right to have their own homeland in Palestine. It encapsulated actual scenes from the celebration that took place following the vote of the United Nations and melded these black and white scenes with precision into the context of the movie. Fantastic, Moving, Emotional, Educational are just some of the adjectives I could apply to this film.

3894202,5,B002BFFDLS,"I haven't read the Amos Oz novel this is based on, so I don't know how faithful it is to the novel, but it's an absolute gem of a movie, one of my favorites out of many years of movie watching. Another reviewer has done an excellent job of summarizing the story of the movie, so I will just comment that the production value of the movie -- the directing, the cinematography, the acting and the music are all really Oscar worthy. Alfred Molina gives a warm and subtle performance as the British officer and Ido Port as the boy Proffy Leibowitz is very natural in the role and adorable! There are times when just his facial expression alone says so much. The supporting cast are also excellent. This movie does a fine job of making you care about the characters and what happens to them and the ending is so touching. On the bigger stage of world history, it gives us a glimpse of the complexity of Jerusalem in 1947 through the experience of one family and their neighbors. If anything, it is missing the violence of the time from attacks by Arabs on both the native born Jews and the Jewish immigrants, instead focusing on the friendly relationship between the boy and the Arab merchants, which is also true to historical fact that many Arabs were quite friendly to the Jews. It also doesn't go into detail about the many hangings of Jews arrested by the British, which accounts for Proffy's hanging of one of his British toy soldiers. I wanted to mention the violence of the time because while I agree with the moviemakers' decision to leave it out, knowing more of the history does help to understand Proffy's hatred of the British",1339804800,5,1634,4.523648648648648
3894203,5,B002BFFDLS,"This is the story of a friendship that blooms between Sgt. Dunlop, a British soldier and Proffy, a Jewish boy born in 1947 Palestine.  The British and the Jews of Palestine were opposing forces in 1947.  The British opposed the Jewish occupation  of what became the state of Israel in 1947.  The British opposed and prevented the Jewish refugees fleeing WWII Europe from  emigrating to Palestine, the Jewish homeland. Jewish armies fought the British soldiers so a friendship between a member of the British occupying forces and a young Jewish boy was unusual.  Proffey was a member of a group of 3 boys called the FOD for Forces of Death that tried to sabotage the British by setting off home made bombs with the goal of blowing up a British motorcade.  They weren't successful.  Proffey and Sgt. Dunlop studied and discussed the book of Samuel from the Old Testament.  Proffey was criticized by his fellow Jews and even tried in a Jewish court for espionage.  He was acquitted, but he was viewed with suspicion from then on.  He paid dearly for what was an innocent and lovely friendship.  Sgt. Dunlop sympathized with the Jews who celebrated when the U.N. gave them their state.  Sgt. Dunlop was tranferred home and because of mishaps, neither got to say their goodbyes.  I won't write about a spoiler, but the film ends charmingly.  I highly recommend it. There is a very good film based on this book.  I don't know its name, but it too is highly recommended.  The acting is first rate, and the script is first rate.  The character  actor who plays Sgt. Dunlop is excellent.",1319414400,3,1578,4.693430656934306
3894204,5,B002BFFDLS,"I rarely give 5 star ratings to movies, but this one demanded an exception. It is touching and funny (sometimes at the same time as being touching), while communicating a profound message.

BTW, if anyone is confused by the one review already here that mentions the book of Matthew as being of mutual interest to the British soldier and the Jewish boy, it is the book of Samuel. The former is one of the Gospels, while the latter is sacred to both Jews and Christians. With that minor correction, that review does a great job of describing the movie that I won't try to improve upon.",1317945600,,583,4.5
3894205,5,B002BFFDLS,"THE LITTLE TRAITOR is a touching little film based on the Amos Oz novel 'Panther in the Basement' and adapted for the screen and directed by Lynn Roth. Made in 2007 but for some reason not commercially released in the USA until On Demand films became popular on television, it is now available in DVD and deserves attention, especially in the current situation of the Middle East situation. This is one of those films that may be small or low budget, but carries a rather profound message that transcends political restrictions or biases.

The story takes place in 1947 Palestine before the formation of Israel as state in 1948. Proffy Liebowitz (Ido Port) may be only eleven years old but he is very bright and has insights into the political situation of the times. He was conceived in Poland but born in Palestine when his parents immigrated in hopes of forming a Jewish state of fellow WW II survivors from the concentration camps. Proffy resents the presence of the British in Paelstine who inflict curfews on the citizens of Jerusalem and joins with his buddies to plan bombs and other ordinances to terrorize the British make their motto of Freedom Or Death meaningful. Proffy's father (Rami Heuberger) is a harsh disciplinarian: he and his wife give sanctuary for immigrant homeless Jews and don't want Proffy to disturb the British policing of the city for fear of altering their roles as protectors.

Out beyond curfew time one evening Proffy encounters British Sergeant Dunlop (Alfred Molina) and somehow the two connect: Dunlop does not arrest Proffy but instead returns him to his home with the promise that Proffy will join him for lunch the next day! Proffy's father grounds him for a week, but finally when Proffy is released he looks up Dunlop and the two share literature and conversation, times that allow each to understand the other's stance and personality, and Proffy begins to see the warmly generous Dunlop as a father figure - a man who psychologically replaces Proffy's own cold and remote father. Their friendship becomes a strong bond between what Proffy had once considered a clash of enemies. As their friendship builds Proffy's young friends discover the relationship and begin to spread rumors that Proffy is passing Jewish intelligence to the British. Proffy is interrogated (Theodore Bikel) and how the Jews and the British deal with this is the climax of the story. We do see years later the old Dunlop meet the now adult Proffy (Natan Ravich) in a very touching scene.

Alfred Molina once again proves that he can make even a small film rise to a fine standard and his interaction with the young Ido Port is memorable. The film is in English and Hebrew with subtitles. Recommended for all audiences. Grady Harp, May 11",1304208000,3,2755,4.857446808510638

3894207,4,B002BFFDLS,"I went to see this movie in a Jewish Film Festival a couple of months ago, and for the next few days, I couldn't help phrasing a bunch of the funniest lines with them (""So I don't need anything for that?"" ""No, all you'll need is your binoculars."" Its funnier when you see the movie.). Amazon's description of the movie may make it sound all serious, but there are quite a few of jokes in it. Anyways, the plot is really good. It is about a 12-year-old boy named ""Proffy"" (I don't remember his actual name, but that was his nickname.) who is living in Israel in 1947. Anyone who knows a little about Israeli history knows that that was an important point in time. Anyways, Proffy was hanging out with his self-band club, FOD, (Freedom Or Death) when the curfew alarm rings. Proffy runs back home, where he is stopped by British Officer Private Dunlop. Dunlop starts talking to him and mentions something out of the book of Mathew. Now, at this point, I thought I had went to one of those uber-religious movies, but mentions of the book of Mathew is pretty much as religious as it gets. Anyways, Proffy notices that he mentioned that and starts cracking on him that that is the Jews' book. Eventually after talking for a few minutes, they strike up a friendship and Dunlop decides not to throw Proffy in jail. After a few FOD schemes to stop the British and Proffy visiting Dunlop a few times, Proffy gets accused for giving military information to the British, and is held a trial. I'm not saying anymore because it spoils the ending. I really like this movie, but there are some scenes that are in Hebrew (with subtitles) and there are some scenes that aren't very appropriate for younger audiences, but nevertheless, it is a great movie.",1302307200,2,1738,4.538216560509555
3894208,5,B002BFFDLS,"Without a doubt, ""The Little Traitor"" is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The acting is superb, the lines are clever and very humorous and it tells a story about tumultuous times, without showing any violence. It's a feel good film with the most moving ending I've seen. A MUST-SEE. I am waiting for it to come out in NSTC.",1271548800,2,331,4.26984126984127
8361225,5,B002BFFDLS,"This film is taken from the novelette by the renowned writer Amos Oz called ""The Panther in the Basement.""  The film is true to the story, which is partially autobiographical.  It's a marvelous little gem, filmed in Jerusalem, set in 1947 when Israel was neither a state nor not-a-state.  The British were in the last months of their Mandate and were particularly hard on the Jews, seeming to favor the Arabs.  British patrols enforced daily curfews; Jews had to be in their houses by eight o'clock p.m.  At this hour, the Irgun, the secret army, began its operations.  Adults talked about this constantly, children listened, and three little boys formed an organization to fight the British: ""FOD-- Freedom Or Death.""  The only problem was that one of these little boys happened to be caught by a British soldier when the child was running home after the curfew siren had sounded-- so he was stopped.  And there began a friendship between the child and the British soldier, a decent, kindly man whose father and brother were vicars, and the soldier interested not in fighting but in languages.  So he employed the boy to help him learn Hebrew, because the only Hebrew the soldier knew was straight from the Bible, antique and not at all modern Hebrew.  And naturally, because the boy was going to see the soldier at British headquarters in Jerusalem, the child was noticed and trouble ensued.  The acting in this film is marvelous.  The tragi-comic life of a Jewish child in the final days of the mandate were actually lived by Amos Oz, who was born in 1939 as Amos Klausner in Israel to emigrant parents of a scholarly family.  He is the grand-nephew of the renowned scholar and former activist Yosef Klausner of The Hebrew University.  This film is historically accurate as well as highly entertaining.",1513296000,,1805,4.799352750809062
8361226,5,B002BFFDLS,"It is a beautiful movie set in Israel during the year leading to independence and tells the story of a young Jewish boy who befriends a British soldier. The acting is superb and the dilemmas the boy faces speaks to us even today. It is a story of hope and understanding, of family, community and politics. I have watched it more than a dozen times and never tire of it.",1468713600,,369,4.285714285714286
