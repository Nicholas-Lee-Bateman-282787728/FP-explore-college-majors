4464000,5,B004SMTO7G,"If you are a fan of Robot Chicken, and especially of the previous two installments of the Star Wars Robot Chicken, then you will really enjoy this iteration.  I purchased the BluRay mainly for the advertised extras - which are great!  However, what I had not counted on was that by purchasing the Blu-Ray version, the video would actually fill out my tv screen.  This was surprising because since the Robot Chicken series is produced for television and has a 4:3 aspect ratio, apparently they produced this 3rd version specifically for home video.  As such, the aspect ratio is that of a widescreen television (which most are nowadays).

This is a very entertaining video all around, with a lot of funny segments.  I enjoyed the extras as well with various interviews of the creators and some voice artists.  This is definitely one for the collection.  What's more, Amazon.com has it available at a very reasonable price.",1313193600,2,921,4.858974358974359
4464001,4,B004SMTO7G,"I really like RC.  This is a funny DVD, but unfortunately not to my expectations.  Don't take this the wrong way, I think you'll still enjoy it.  It just doesn't beat the Jar-Jar bit in the second one.",1313020800,2,201,4.2368421052631575
4464002,4,B004SMTO7G,"i bought this DVD and I've loved robot chicken for years, but i was a bit confused when my copy of this dvd went for 35 mins when i know that it goes for 45 mins. i noticed that from a certain scene the next 10 minutes are missing. the scene where obi wan uses Jedi mind tricks in the mirror. from there the next 10 mins are missing. did anyone else have this problem or should i return it to store and ask for another copy?

PS i bought this item elsewhere.

My favorite scene was cut :(  Palpatine on the escalator",1312934400,,516,3.9902912621359223
4464003,4,B004SMTO7G,"Just so you know, the first installment were all random skits. The second one focused on the bounty hunters and this installment focuses on the whole story but from The Emporer's point of view. Nice one Robot Chicken! Well done.
Funny side note:
I walk into Meijers (store) and ask the entertainment section employee, ""Do you have the Robot Chicken Star Wars episode III DVD?"" she replies, ""The what?""...I reply, ""How do you work in this section and not know what that is? It's even a new release."" Instead of checking the new releases or even the computer stock logs, she scratches her head and says, ""I don't know what that is. Star wars?"" I then turn and walk out of the store. I purchased it at F.Y.E. in the mall.
The show is approx 45 minutes but the abundant extras will entertain for hours. Comic-con panels, interviews with George Lucas and much much more had me laughing through the whole thing.
Did anyone else feel Gary the Stormtrooper was no longer a funny guy but now he is a jerk? (shrugs)
I gave it 4 vs. 5 stars because some skits went by so fast, I had to go back and watch them again to see what was so funny. That was the only bad thing.
Enjoy",1312416000,,1164,4.344036697247707
4464004,4,B004SMTO7G,"I pre-ordered this from Amazon as soon as it was available.  The wife and I are RC fans, and SW geeks.  RCSW I and II were hilarious!  My wife still laughs whenever she thinks of a Sand Person in a restaurant.  So when this finally arrived we were stoked!  Well, I won't say we were disappointed with our purchase; RCSW III had plenty of funny stuff (Seth MacFarlane's Lord Palpatine stands out), however you get the feeling that the writers were going to a well that's running dry, and just kept digging until they found moisture.  Some of the gags were based on SW characters and themes that were so obscure that even we had trouble getting the joke.  And the whole episode was formatted differently with an Emperor death freeze-framed voice over at the beginning, a shtick that periodically pops up until it's conclusion at the end.  So instead of a DVD consisting of a bunch of skits dreamed up by a simian commity of post-adolescent derps on some Caf-Pow! hangover, filmed with a technical elegance reminiscent of the finest shoebox dioramas, Frankenstein-stitched together by editors who've never heard of the word ""emergence"" and vomited onto video, what's delivered is an ""en total"" episode that appears as if somebody tried to put some thought into a cohesive product in order to craft a classic piece of comdie outre...meh.  I preferred the derp.",1311552000,2,1356,4.785407725321888
4464005,4,B004SMTO7G,"RCST 1 was good,RCSW 2 was great,but RCSW 3 is an absolute classic. It captued the STAR WARS saga in a hilarious manner. A top notch hilarious special.",1311206400,,151,4.428571428571429
4464006,4,B004SMTO7G,"Michael Stailey, DVD Verdict-- As is often the case when a joke runs too long, it gets stale. So is the case with Robot Chicken: Star Wars. These specials started off as inspired, fought to be wildly creative, and have now run outta gas. You can't fault Seth Green and Matt Senreich for trying. I mean, hell, they've lapped the Family Guy creative team and their shot-for-shot Star Wars remakes ten times over, and there are still some laughs to be had.

Credit the production and animation teams for continuing to take existing molds and creating new characters/sets to bring Lucas' universe to life. The care and attention that goes into even the shortest of these bits is phenomenal. At 10-15 frames per second--depending on the subtlety of the character movements, complexity of the sets, variety of camera angles, and number of visual fx--even the briefest of these segments require hundreds if not thousands of shots. These guys have been at this a long time, and Robot Chicken continues to look better and better with each season.

Speaking of looks, presented in 1.78:1 1080i (packaging claims 1080p) widescreen, the depth of detail is astounding; the whole series should look this good. The blacks are fairly solid and the colors pop, but the eagle-eyed among you will spot a number of digital glitches. The True HD 5.1 surround track won't come close to impressing anyone, as it's basically a plussed 2.0 Stereo track with little in the way of ambience or a robust soundscape. Hey, it works for me, but I'm not that demanding of HD perfection for a release like this. And I can't imagine anyone's looking for reference quality material from Adult Swim.

The bonus material, on the other hand, makes Robot Chicken: Star Wars III well worth the purchase.

4464007,4,B004SMTO7G,"I do not watch regular Robot Chicken episodes.

As a long time Star Wars fan & collector I purchased the 3 DVD's.

This one is funny, not a bulls eye however.  Some bits do not work or just did NOT make any sense.

A lot of use of Boba Fett if you like the character.  The Emperor, Vader.

Gary the Stormtrooper, several bits on that.

BUT, THE ONLY WHEN THE FEEL LIKE IT LANGUAGE CUTS.  They let some adult language go through, some they cut.  Curse words.

IT IS A DVD WHY CUT ANYTHING?  Badly done.

Several good extras on it.  Be warned the video on the Skywalker ranch premiere is NOT professional so IT IS DARK & HARD TO SEE.

But, I always complain about these.  The CHEAP, DO NOT CARE PLASTIC DVD CASES WITH THE INTENTIONAL HOLES SO YOU HAVE TO GO PURCHASE ANOTHER.

Overall a good job, ruined by editing when editing was NOT needed.

Amazon customers-be warned  They did NOT drop the price release week like they do on pretty much any other DVD.  So you could find better deals, I pointed this out to Amazon & got lip service  They then DROPPED THE PRICE AFTER I ORDERED IT.",1310774400,2,1083,4.241379310344827
4464008,5,B004SMTO7G,"This hilarious 44-minute show first aired on Adult Swim on the Cartoon Network in December 2010. The entire show is included here on this modestly priced DVD with the addition of 4 hilarious commentary tracks with different groups of actors, producers and production staff. It's worth the buy just to hear Billy Dee Williams say he hates Jar Jar Binks in front of Ahmed Best!

If that wasn't enough, the deleted scenes and animatics are great additional material. A lot of sketches got cut for time, not because they weren't funny, and several high-quality pieces of material made it into this featurette. There are also great featurettes showing the most recent San Diego Comic-Con panel, a meeting with George Lucas at Skywalker Ranch, entertaining footage from the Skate Tour promoting the show, and much, much more. This DVD will provide many hours of enjoyment with high repeat viewing value. It's a winner!",1310428800,12,912,5.0
4464009,4,B004SMTO7G,"I saw this when it came out on AS, so I don't know about DVD extras, extended scenes or anything from the DVD.

I love the whole Robot Chicken franchise anyway, but I've really been loving the Robot Chicken Star Wars stuff. In the other editions they covered the rest of the movies and basically wrapped up the series, but here they come back and tell everything from the Emperor's point of view, which I thought was cute.

There were some things that looked a little choppy, but it wasn't too bad, and the hilarity of it all more than made up for mess ups.

This was great.",1307404800,7,574,4.296296296296297

4464034,4,B004SMTO7G,"I do not understand why some people who have reviewed this product seem to hate it. As a prerequisite of course, one must love Star Wars. Then again if you hated Star Wars you might enjoy the jokes in a different way, as you can think they are making fun of the series of movies instead of them having fun with it. So win/win? First off I do agree that at times the jokes get a little thin, but then again that's Robot Chicken, some episodes are awesome and you'll find yourself laughing even though you know you shouldn't be laughing at what you are seeing. And how many times/ways can they tell the same Linsay Lohan jokes? But the concept and the delivery of said concept works for the most part. This is something that you should watch with a group of people. Preferrably Star Wars fans. The inside jokes, the real world observation of how real people would react to the fantastic events of the star wars stories all are generally funny. Sometimes creepy (see the scene where Anakin gives Padme flowers to know what I mean). And as with Robot Chicken's general premise and humor you sometimes find yourself laughing when normally you should be repulsed. Somehow they have a talent at making the most horrendous behavior or life-altering actions somehow seem funny and disturbing at the same time. I am pretty critical about parodies, as with non-star wars parodies that seem to flood the market these days, there is so much effort put into either telling a normal story or grossing us out with disgusting humore that you don't find youself laughing. Gone seems to be the days of Airplane and Mel Brooks movies (except when those directors actually make a new movie of course). Everything seems to be shoved down our throats and shoved in our faces that we find ourselves wanting the movie to end sooner than it actually does. With Robot Chicken Star Wars whether the jokes hit or miss, you find yourself wanting it to go on even longer. You see a clip and think that was ingenious, then of course you might see a clip that makes you go wtf?, or huh? but you find yourself wanting to actually sit through the misses in order to get to the hits. I have previously had this as a download from xbox marketplace, but I plan on buying this blu ray. The overall quality of the video I've seen is great so I'm assuming it's a no brainer on blu ray. If you just sit back and relax and watch this movie you will most likely enjoy it and will be glad you purchased it. I find with humor it's best not to overthink things. With Robot Chicken you basically get guerilla styled humor, it's quick in do the joke, then quick out. By the time you've decided whether or not you liked the clip or not, you are facing a totally new clip, so either it can make up for the one you didn't like or keep you laughing to keep the momentum going. Any fan of Robot Chicken or Star Wars should get a major kick out of watching this. Though I should warn viewers it's not exactly kid-friendly, but then again it's more for the people who grew up with Star Wars (from the beginning) You can tell that the writers really love the Star Wars Saga, and you will find yourself laughing a lot during this hilarious send up.",1340496000,,3190,4.408474576271186

4464040,5,B004SMTO7G,"Television, as any other form of media, and for that sake any sellable product, is a process of improvement. Quality in programming over the years has peaks and valleys on the graph of quality. As a form of media, our generation has been lucky enough in the last 20 years to see some of the greatest television and movies ever produced.

We are both blessed and cursed to have adult swim. The programming lineup in in the middle of the night on carttoon network is like the nightly superhero that sheds his disguse to show his true form. Buried in near television obscurity is the greatest gem most people will never comically or intellectually understand.

You see, our blessing is that television has culminated to this point; and this point is adult swim. We are so lucky to see this point in the history and future of this media. No one will recognize it, and few will be willing to admit that the brilliance of adult swim is, and always shall be, the brightest spot in television history.  And this, also becomes our curse. Everything ends. And when adult swim does, it's all down hill, for nothing could ever reach this apex of mastery on all media again.

4464049,2,B004SMTO7G,"Don't get me wrong, I love Robot Chicken, but releasing this as a single episode and a bunch of rubbish extras really get's under my skin. It really annoyed me the first time Robot Chicken released a Star Wars episode on DVD and filled it with a bunch of crap for extras, and now this is the 3rd time they have done it. The 35 minute long main feature is a good episode, it is funny, maybe not as funny as the first two, but it's decent enough... but like I said... it's ONE EPISODE. Why can't they just include this episode with the rest of the season of the whatever series of Robot Chicken this aired in? Or, at least combine all 3 Star Wars episodes and at least have barely an hours worth of a main feature to present?

What you get here, is a 35 minute episode, and then hours of extras that are not worth looking at. There is a few featurettes, which I skipped when I saw what the content of it was... they are things like the creators of this show talking about their first memories of Star Wars, their first toys, and what Star Wars means to them... ummm... sorry, but I DON'T CARE! I have no interest in hearing that kind of thing from anyone. It's filler time for ""bonus features"". Then there is deleted scenes... or should I say ONE deleted scene, and a bunch of sketch ideas for other scenes... I might have gotten through all of them and found a scene that I thought might have been funny had they shot it, but in order to get to them, I had to see the creators talk endlessly about the scene and why it was cut or not shot or what they thought of it... and again, I DON'T CARE... it became really annoying having to see them all sit around laughing and smiling obnoxiously loud about it before seeing a sketch drawing of the scene that doesn't last as long as they took to introduce it. It was annoying because the audio quality of amateur recordings to film themselves saying this, and then going into a more professional tone to show the clip really made my head hurt from the clear sounds going to bad quality sound of a bunch of things I don't want to see or hear from any of the crew involved in making/writing/producing the cut scenes. Would an extra option to say ""Play All with"" or ""Play all Without"" the introductions been so hard to include here? Some of us really don't give a damn about the introductions and find them irritating to have to watch, seeing as how there is quite a number of deleted scenes in sketch form.

There is also a few commentaries, but I did not care to listen to any of them, especially if it's going to be the same old ""Oh, this show was my favorite"", ""I was drinking coffee during the time we shot this"" or ""I had a really bad case of the clap when I wrote this""... again, I just don't care. I also don't care for them to film themselves answering questions no one asked... nor could I stand more then 15 seconds of them repeating the same things they had already said from the footage of them at Comic Con talking about the release of this episode and promoting their stupid tour program in the process. The only thing that I might have watched would be the crew meeting George Lucas and running a few questions by him and their ideas for this episode, but unfortunately no one gave George a microphone, so you can either turn your volume up all the way to try and hear what he has to say amongst the obnoxious and nauseating talk of the crew sucking up to George and telling him how much they want to carry his baby, or you can do what I did and roll your eyes and hit the skip button of your remote.

The rest of the DVD is promos and TV spots.

All in all, the bonus content is a complete waste of time... if you've seen one Star Wars Robot Chicken DVD set of bonus material, you have seen them all. It just made me scream WHO CARES and be thankful I only rented this and not wasted my money buying it, or else I would feel completely ripped off. In future, if Seth Green and AdultSwim wanna get this right, they should release all 3 together and add whatever bonus features the public think are worthy of including, not just what they want to include like thinking people care what happens in their day to day lives... half the bonus features felt like watching a blog video rather then bonus content... until they do this, I can not give these DVD releases a higher rating. They should have come with the seasons they aired during, or combine all 3 and release a worthy DVD of purchasing, and I don't mean combine the 3 DVD sets as a box set, I mean put the 3 episodes on ONE DVD and make a product worthy of selling.",1313539200,4,4576,4.220319634703197
