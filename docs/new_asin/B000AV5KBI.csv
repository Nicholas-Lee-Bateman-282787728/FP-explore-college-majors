8324978,5,B000AV5KBI,"Mike may come off a little quirky to some folks, but I liked his presentation and have gone back to it over and over and over.  He gets high marks on taking me through each step from field dressing to the kitchen table.  He doesnt assume that you know anything, and that's just what I needed.  My first (and sucessive) attempts at field dressing and butchering my own vension were based on his instructions and I really appreciate knowing how to do it the exact same way a meatcutter would.  I liked this video so much after borrowing it from a neighbor that I bought my own copy.  If you want professional advice, this video will deliver it.",1226448000,,642,4.406779661016949
