8608802,5,B00ERNEJ44,I bought Cats for my granddaughter who loves cats.  She was mesmerized and played it over and over again.,1512432000,,105,4.526315789473684
8608803,3,B00ERNEJ44,"So it's not terrible, still a very enjoyable movie though the musical is soooooo much better. I wouldn't have bought this had I known that the entire Growltiger's Last Stand scene was not included. I can't imagine why it would have been cut and this is called the Ultimate Edition? I'm so confused. It's still good but I loved Growltiger in the show. This should not be called the Ultimate Edition of anything :(",1495152000,,412,4.581081081081081

8608807,1,B00ERNEJ44,"Please do not buy this Blu ray disc of Cats from this seller. It is not even dvd Quality. As a matter of fact, an old slow VHS tape looks better. There is a fuzzy film overcast look on this disc. First, I had to contact them several times because a month passed and I could not locate it's where it was. All it said was is that it had shipped. Now I know why, they were bust trying to find me one, or make it themselves. It sounds great!
The quality of my gear is all 4K upgrade-able, I only buy 3d Blu ray movies, with the exception of Cats. I really like this play. Seller Movie Emporium.",1421798400,,590,3.966386554621849
8608808,5,B00ERNEJ44,"cats!  I saw the live broadway production twice and fell in love at once.  being a cat lover myself, I really get it.  cats are such special creatures, and Andrew Lloyd Weber once again brought such a personal touch to his cats.  they really are all very different from each other, just like people.  so I highly recommend it to everyone, even if your not a cat person.  It's highly entertaining.",1407628800,,396,4.507042253521127
8608809,5,B00ERNEJ44,"I just noticed that Amazon made a serious mistake, as the picture is supposed to be CATS the musical, somehow it has reviews from a totally differnet movie ""The Cats"" (1968).
And there is another item for ""Cats: Ultimate Edition [Blu-ray]"", but the reviews were mixed with the older DVD movie, what a mess!

Anyhow let's do a quick comparison:
DVD, Ancient navigation menu.
Audio track: Up to Dolby 5.1
Extra: The Making of Cats.
Subtitle: For some reason, I can't get my bluray players (as well as Xbox One) to show any subtitle. It does work with VLC software player, though sometimes it has horrible lip sync issue.

Bluray: Better video, granted it's not up to current Bluray standard (Could be that it's recorded with none HD camera), but still a noticeable improvement. On DVD there are horizontal black bars on top and bottom of screen. On Bluray there is none!
Audio: On top of Dolby 5.1, it now has DTS 5.1.
Extra: It has two more, ""Interview with the original creative team"", which has quite some very insightful information. ""Character Makeup Featurette"", a little comparison of before and after makeup.
Subtitle: Oh my gosh, it now has 29 languages! I honestly think that's too much. It's kinda fun to see how they translate the lyrics into different languages though, some of them are silly.

If you're a fan of Cats, I'd wholeheartedly recommend this fantastic bluray.",1400457600,5,1382,4.798319327731092
8608810,1,B00ERNEJ44,"I have the DVD of this show and the video quality is awful.  I was therefore hopeful that the bluray version would be better.  Wrong.  It is just as awful. And it thoroughly spoils any enjoyment of this awesome show. Nothing has been done to bring us the pristine high definition quality that we expect from bluray. What a shame for not only people who purchase this, thinking they will get bluray quality, but for the fantastic cast, and the effort that went into staging this for video. Surely there must be another re-mastered version coming out later ............But on the plus side, the sound is not too bad, and better than the DVD.",1389571200,3,639,4.587719298245614
8608811,1,B00ERNEJ44,"Video is horrible! Blu rays are supposed to be visually better than DVD- not in this case! Why bother!
Production company of this bluray should reissue the blu ray",1382140800,14,163,4.655172413793103
