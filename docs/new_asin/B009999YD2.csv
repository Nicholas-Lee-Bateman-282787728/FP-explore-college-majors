5286495,5,B009999YD2,"Has broad appeal even for those who know nothing about horses; anyone can appreciate that the difficulty in training a wild horse that's never been handled by a human in just 100 days.  The dedication of the trainers and their love for the horses is inspiring.  This is a movie I will watch many times.  Oh, and there is an interesting twist at the end involving one of the horses and its trainer . . . no spoiler here!",1355097600,,419,4.2784810126582276
5286496,5,B009999YD2,"I saw this movie at the Dallas Film festival and was immediately moved by the compassion these people have for saving Mustangs.  Exquisitely portrayed and well told, this is a must see for anyone who has even a little interest in horses and how they are gentled and trained.  Horses are incredibly smart and personal and this documentary exposes their loving nature as well as the passion their trainers and owners have for them.  George and Evelyn Gregory's story brought tears of sadness and joy.  Rest in Peace George!  You have changed my perspective and my life!",1355011200,,567,4.804123711340206
5286497,5,B009999YD2,"I became aware of the Extreme Mustang Makeover this year, when a friend competed at the event in Salem, OR. I came away from that event stunned at the beauty of the horses, and amazed at the abilities of the trainers.
This is a beautiful film, that will fill you with emotion and leave you in awe of these trainers abilities.
I watched this film with a nephew who is not at all horse crazy, he was just as engrossed as I was and cried right along with me.
Special mention has to go the New Hampshire brothers, who did such a fine job with their mustangs. Those two boys, have real talent and so much heart. I hope they get the recognition they deserve.
The trainer who is aptly named Jesus, takes his horse so far, it has set a record for EMM auction sales. He is a natural horse trainer and a pleasure to watch.
The Chee Father and son duo, will leave you with a lump in your throat, and cheering wildly for them.
George and Evelyn with Waylon & Willie, you would swear was a cinematic set up, but following the rules of EMM, you can be assured it was not.
Wylene Wilson, a gifted cowgirl, who though a little brash, knows her stuff and carries on the tradition of the Western Cowgirl as a heroine.
The biomed engineer, who bravely brings home a wild mustang, to train as a first timer, will surprise you with her horse Zero.
I loved this movie and hope you will enjoy it as we did.",1354838400,3,1383,4.203007518796992
5286498,5,B009999YD2,"This movie is a must see for anyone who loves horses. 100 professional and amateur horse trainers receive a BLM mustang and have 100 days to train the horse before a national competition in Texas.  You see all different approaches, trainers and horses working together with the common goal of winning this competition.  The actual motivating factor is people working with majestic mustangs as a labor of love.  The horses are auctioned off after the competition, which is important but sometimes heartbreaking. You will get to see a wide variety of training techniques all with the common denominator of people training horses they love. This is an important movie as the point is that wild mustangs are amazing and can be trained to do what few other horses are capable of doing considering their wild beginnings. You will love the trainers. You will love the horses. This movie is well worth a watch. It will capture your heart and have you looking into how you can enter the next competition. My only criticism of this movie is the lack of attention paid to Lanny and Logan Leach,  father and son trainers, who both scored in the top 10 winners of this competition. I bought a half dozen copies of this film for friends.  If more attention had been paid to Lanny and Logan I would have bought three dozen.",1354752000,8,1308,4.6943231441048034
5286499,5,B009999YD2,"This film is more than a film about horses and horse lovers. It is one of the most moving documentaries I've seen about human compassion and the desire to connect.  The various persons followed in this film have chosen to take in a wild mustang, train it and bring it to competition in just 100 days.  These are not polished or wealthy people with time on their hands. These are ordinary people who are passionate about horses and willing to take on what at times seems an impossible task.  From an old Navajo man who is terrified to get on his horse to 2 young brothers in New Hampshire who learned to work with horses by observing and imitating the horses natural behavior, -every single one has a wildly different approach to achieve the one goal they all share: developing a trust with their horse.  At times it is heartbreaking just knowing that all their intuition, creativity, commitment- and the deep love that inevitably develops is all with the purpose of getting the horse to competition and being auctioned off for adoption.  This is what unconditional love really means.",1354579200,44,1083,4.708994708994709
5286500,5,B009999YD2,"I never thought much about horses until seeing this film and now feel as though I have a MUCH better understanding of these beautiful animals!

5286501,5,B009999YD2,Absolutely the BEST horse movie ever!!!  You will laugh and you will cry.  So touching and so well done.  There is something so magnificent and spiritual about wild horses; about the connection between horse and human.  This is an absolute must see for all horse lovers.  My husband and I have both been anxious to see it for a second time and can't wait for it to come out on DVD.  What a great gift.  I will be giving it to relatives as well as our horse loving friends in Switzerland. Yahoo!  Don't wait; order it; you will not be disappointed!,1352419200,51,547,4.346534653465347

5286526,5,B009999YD2,"This is about as wonderful as a horse documentary gets. It's inspiring and heartbreaking - sometimes almost at the same time. The filmmakers chose a disparate group of trainers- some professionals, some amateurs- and the bond they established with their horses was truly inspiring even if they didn't all have classically happy ending. I could (and have!) watched this movie over and over again.",1499990400,,395,5.1875
5286527,5,B009999YD2,They should make a show like this every year! A bunch of these techniques are also used in dog training too. It is always fun to see the emotional connection that people develop by pouring their time and effort into saving a life.,1499472000,,230,4.372093023255814

I bow my head to these amazing horsemen, just broke my heart that those two brothers could not buy the horses they trained.

I don't think I've ever seen a better rider than the crazy blonde trainer. It broke my heart when a few of the trainers couldn't win a bid on the horse they loved, and bonded with. The amazing young man, crying so much, because his family couldn't keep, or afford a horse, was devastating to watch. The old, Native American man, shouldn't even own a horse.",1482364800,,482,4.682352941176471

5286596,5,B009999YD2,"Kids like horses, right? Well, adults and kids will like this movie. It's all about a competition to see who can do the best job of taming and training a wild mustang. Adults will appreciate the different methods the trainers use in training their wild horses and the life stories of the trainers. Kids will be entertained by how the horses behave and show their individual personalities. They will also appreciate seeing the life lesson of the trainers' hard work, patience and commitment to a job and acceptance of win or lose, knowing you did your best. A lot of movies are not engaging enough to hold my attention, but this was the exception; I think it is definitely five stars.",1481760000,,683,4.652892561983471

5286601,5,B009999YD2,"Full disclosure:  I'm an English rider.

What I loved:

Almost every second.  Doing this is on my bucket list.  The sacrifices of heart and money is tough, but saving an animal is priceless.

What I hated:

Awful representation of dressage.  The dressage rider annoyed me constantly. She lost her patience quickly.  The woman with grey hair (representing the Pickens couple who bid via phone) later in the film who claimed lead changes (in this instance they were two-tempe by rider Wylene) are an advanced movement and extremely difficult. I would recommend to her to watch lower level dressage shows.  Two-tempes aren't basic/beginner, but they certainly aren't advanced.

The older gentleman riding the little bay gelding (I think it was Waylon, but could have been Willie) was too big to be on that horse.  Also, his training method is too aggressive, at least as shown.

Overall, 5 stars and highly recommended.

About me (if you're curious):  10 years eventing through Prelim (trained through Intermediate), 5 years of Classical Dressage and AO jumpers (trained up to 5'8"").  Also, this account is under my husbands name, Mike. I'm Leslie, should you choose to comment or ask questions.",1481241600,,1192,5.06701030927835

5286614,5,B009999YD2,"A+ very well done movie...nice blend of challenging aspects of training a mustang as well as the immensely talented men and women horse whisperers who have a gift for working with these animals so that they trust and want to please!  There are emotional aspects which are tough to watch near the end when the horses are sold.  In many ways, these trainers become emotionally attached to these horses but I can only imagine how these horses become bonded to their trainers and I wonder if they will be truly happy being captive without the gifted trainer that they bonded with so well.  Deep down, I still feel that these horses were born wild and are meant to remain so....a question that deserves more thought in our present day culture!",1480636800,,738,4.661538461538462

5286617,5,B009999YD2,"This documentary speaks to the heart of anyone who has ever been involved with horses.  Nowhere is the bond one can form with a horse more evident than with these mustangs and their riders who have a scant hundred days to turn a frightened, wild, prey animal into a trusting and useful companion.  It brought tears to my eyes so many times not just from the emotion the developing trust between horse and rider evoked but also with the knowledge that these horses will have homes and care and not live out their days in a holding pen or starve to death on rangeland burdened with too many horses.  My husband and each have adopted mustangs and our boys are some of the most sensible and trainable horses I've been around.  I hope those who view this documentary and are able consider adopting one of these amazing creatures.  My hat is off to the trainers who shared their lives in the making of this movie, to the Mustang Heritage Foundation for promoting adoptions, and to the BLM for the difficult job they do.",1479686400,2,1013,4.5136612021857925

5286642,5,B009999YD2,This is a fantastic documentary with profoundly deep messages about relationship and trust which yes is on the surface about horse and trainer but really about surrendering to the hand of God in our lives and the great distance He will go to bring us into a relationship where we trust Him to guide us for our good!!!!,1478563200,,318,4.5
5286643,5,B009999YD2,To see these wild animals develop a close bond with humans in just 100 days is simply amazing to me. It is instructive that this bonding was accomplished with just love and patience. I saw no whip been raised during the whole duration of the film. There is an important lesson or two riding on this documentary: (1) the way you treat an animal is the way it will end up treating you. And (2) there is a life force that we share with all animals. Respect the difference and embrace the sameness.,1478390400,,494,4.32258064516129

5286802,1,B009999YD2,"When you put a horse's training on a timeline, and then put a cash prize on it, you are encouraging ""trainers"" to cut corners and bully horses into performing purely for human greed.  The winner of the contest was despicable.  The horse she ""trained"" had dead eyes by day three where she was bragging about riding him down the street by the second day she had him.  Just because we can do things to horses, doesn't mean we SHOULD.  At the competition this woman was being praised by the crowd and an idiot judge from the Mustang Heritage Foundation for her lead changes.  They were horrible, the horse was changing front to back and zigzagging-a sure sign that they were produced from force and hard weighting from the horse's back and not from carefully taught and executed leg aids.  Most of the horses followed in this documentary had gaping mouths, showing a clear sign of lack of acceptance.  I guess I shouldn't be surprised since mainstream horse industry is so terribly misinformed and abusive as a whole, but it seems to take the injustice to a whole other level when it's done to a wild horse (AND in 100 days).  I hope one day people will see that this type of ""training"" is on the wrong side of history.  If you want to ride a horse it is YOUR burden to get the horse to understand his job, it doesn't mean that you just throw a saddle and bridle on and let the horse eventually figure out what you want by getting punished and pained for ""wrong"" answers.  Good training is the human using his brain, not the horse damaging his youthful body, crushing his beautiful spirit, and torturing his kind heart.  If a horse is unhappy in his work it is the fault of his human, period.  I hope people don't watch this and get ""training"" tips from it.",1460505600,3,1753,4.44375

The trainers are conflicted because the better the horse shows, the more money they are likely to bring in the auction and many of the trainers are bidding on the horse they trained themselves.
The depth they go into about the people who train them is outstanding and their sense of loss when they sell the freshly trained horse is readily apparent . It is a really good film for any horse lover or anyone who is concerned about the plight of the wild mustangs in the west.",1457913600,,688,4.333333333333333

They then compete against each other in front of a crowd to display the horse's ride-ability and learned behaviors. At the end of the competition, the horses are auctioned to the highest bidders. Many of the trainers have  become emotionally attached to their horses and several successfully bid for the horses they've trained and are able to take them home. Sadly, not all of the trainers who would like to keep their horses can afford to acquire them. The entire process helps promote the adoption of wild horses that are rounded up each year on federal land. It is a well done and informative movie that conveys the difficulty, courage and even danger involved in this process, coupled with the emotional connection that is established between horse and trainer.",1457913600,2,931,4.855345911949685

5286852,5,B009999YD2,"a very beautiful and impressive documentary . it will make you laugh and cry. absolutely thrilling

every year tons of mustangs get round up by the gouvernement ( in order to control the population).

for those who are not familiar with mustangs and the BLM ,this is from the official MHF website :
""The Mustang Heritage Foundation mission is to increase adoption of wild horses held in the Bureau of Land Managements corrals and long term holding facilities. The BLM is currently responsible for more than 50,000 horses in short term and long term care. The Mustang Heritage Foundation works to promote the Mustangs versatility, trainability, and worth as an equine companion through innovative and exciting gentling programs and competitions in the Extreme Mustang Makeovers""
for those who are interrested to see it live , i included the official schedule for 2016 at the bottom of the review.

having those mustangs train and adopted is a wonderful idea. they make tremendous endurance horse , trail horse ,western horse , roping horse etc.. once train properly.

now lets talk about this documentary. its about real people ( not professional and reknown trainers ) trying to tame a wild mustangs in a 100 days. you can see each person has a horse with a different temper. each person handle and train their horse different.

i own horses. i got mines green, and did the whole training but they weren't wild and i put couple YEARS into them and lots of miles. since mustangs are wild  , the horse will have a lot more spook and self preservation instinct kicking in. i know from personal experience how hard it is to train a horse i can only imagine how much harder it is to train a wild horse.so i have a lot of respect and admiration for each one of those people for the amazing things they have accomplished in surch a short period of time . Hat's off to them !

it takes a lot of patience , a lot of love , a lot of bond and a lot of passion to train them.you really have to try to understand their mind and body language . this movie shows beautiful bonds the human and those gorgeous mustangs .

you don't have to own a horse to watch  and appreciate this movie. Anyone can watch. its very instructive and yet so emotional . i strongly recommend this great documentary to any horse lovers

also if you liked this documentary i strongly recommend watching ""Unbranded""",1455062400,3,2375,4.606635071090047

Now I see that the techniques I implemented are called ""natural horsemanship""  As a young girl, I did not have the overpowering strength of the men doing this type of training so had to use my intuition and the patience of a feed salesman who got me started.  That was in the 1950's.  It is awesome to see these trainers who truly love horses take on this challenge.  I personally know a gentleman who participated in the Mustang Makeover and he is an exceptional horseman.  He placed in the top 10 a few years back with his horse Castro.  Castro lives on a dude ranch in Wyoming and is a fabulous horse.  It is a tremendous story of heart felt dedication to these beautiful creatures.  And, as in most cases, the trainer learns more about themselves while gaining the trust of this wild creature.  The anguish they experience at the end of their 100 days is so compelling.

5286925,5,B009999YD2,"Great documentary showing the exceptional skill with which trainers have gentled, trained, and ridden wild mustangs in just 100 days.  So many of the trainers got very attached to their horses and could not afford to buy them at public auction.  So, even though I sat here bawling  because I had been in their shoes, I prayed that each horse that was auctioned to the public received a good home where it would be loved, cared for, and ridden to its potential.  And, I cried for happy for those who could afford to buy their horses and take them home.  These horses really seemed to enjoy performing.  God bless all those who trained these horses because it means these horses will live.",1445472000,,687,4.590163934426229

It chronicles the experiences of several individuals who adopt wild mustangs with the challenge of training them, then competing with other trainers, in only 100 days.  Some are experienced trainers; some are simply horse people who want to do their part to preserve the mustang and what it represents to our heritage.

In my opinion the movie is over simplified. I can say that you will encounter more issues than you see here on the movie. But if you think 90 days, for 2 hours a day, is 180 hours, and the movie is only 2 hours it is still a WONDERFUL movie that gives a lot of info.
Talked with RR at an event in person (the lady with the golden cape) that indeed she is the Queen of Horses as is shown in this movie.
Man she is Good. Tears did flow because true horse-lovers will feel the connection the trainers made with those Mustangs.

5287256,5,B009999YD2,"Love the movie.  The horses, given a chance, showed their abilities.

It's a shame so many of these horses are warehoused in lots, taken away from their natural lives.

We hear the reasons given such as they are not ""a natural species to the lands they were removed from.""

Yet, no mention is given of the multiple numbers of cattle that use the same lands, nor the multinational corporations that profit from taking the minerals from the soil of the United States of America.  Cattle and foreign-owned corporations are native species?

The removal of these wild horses from these lands is not for the horses benefit, but for a small number of people who have profits to make.

The very few horses who came out from the huge captive formerly wild running herds stuck in dry lots are the lucky ones.  Most people don't know what the truth is, I wish the movie had a little more information on the numerous captive wild horses.  A picture is worth a thousand words, a few seconds of video worth even more.

The movie was great, and hopefully will inspire some to learn the truth - and inspire more people to work with their horses or to help mustangs get back to their wild lives - after all, their numbers are but a small fraction of the cattle and they give spiritually more to the American people than do foreign owned mining companies.",1390867200,3,1337,4.533333333333333

What the mustang trainers accomplish in a mere 100 days is truly astonishing -- witness the young trainer Kris Kokal riding his mustang at a full gallop around an arena with the horse blindfolded and proceeding entirely on trust; the amazing Wylene Wilson riding her mustang through a maze of tarps then executing flying lead changes with beauty and precision; the elderly Native American struggling to mount the mustang he fears yet loves, the immigrant Mexican trainer whose magnificent mustang proudly projects their shared prides in their heritages.

Each of the trainers, riders, clinicians were very talented, patient people and should be congratulated for taking on the task of training a wild horse that could have all sorts of different traits. They, the humans, adapted to the individual equine's ebb and flo of learning, which is what it is all about. Bravo!",1376784000,,447,4.670886075949367

I wish I didn't have to retrain and help so many horses that have been through this program myself. Time, there is no substitute for it and you can never take too much of it while building communication ad understanding with another speces. A buyer.

I would watch this again, and in fact, I will, since I bought myself one on Amazon as well.
Also purchased one for my Dad for Father's Day, since we rode horses together in my youth

Rounding up the wild mustangs results in numerous injuries and even death for the horse....how ridiculous is it that the govt spends money to round up wild horses?  It is nice to see these people training these wild horses into amazingly docile animals.  This is sadly a sport, with nice purse for the winner.  Ranch owners complain of the wild horses ruining their crops/property.  Who cares?  You have tons of money figure it out yourself.

Each year, 100 professional horse trainers and ordinary people across the country attempt to tame a wild horse in only 100 days. At the end of that time, there is a contest to determine who has done the best job. After the contest, the horses are put up for auction. This documentary follows 9 trainers and their different approaches and personalities as they strive to develop an emotional bond of mutual respect and trust with their horses. The movie does an outstanding job of showing the beauty of the land and the horses themselves, and the impact of the varied personalities of the trainers on their success. The most heartbreaking part of the movie is seeing the young trainers having to bid to keep the horses they have learned to love as a member of the family.

5287439,1,B009999YD2,"Misleading title, ""Wild"" horse, ""Wild"" ride.  A wild animal is one that has never been domesticated, such as bear, deer, elk, moose, coyote, etc.  A feral animal is one that is domesticated, but allowed to run at large as a nuisance, such as cat, dog, horse.  These horses running loose on BLM land are domestic horses that over time, owners that could not feed them have turned them loose on public BLM land, thus feral horses.  They are not a particular breed, such as Mustang, Quarter Horse, Morgan, Arabian, etc.  They are ""grade"" horses of hodgepodge random breeding, with no selection for quality in conformation with straight legs, sloping shoulders, big eye, good disposition, etc.  These feral horses breed with no responsible management, until their numbers damage public BLM lands forcing roundups putting over 40,000 into holding pens to be fed, medicated, feet trimmed, trained, all at the extreme cost to the taxpayer.  The BLM then dumps these feral, low quality horses onto the horse market at give away prices, ruining the prices of good horses for the private breeder.  How can the private horse breeder compete with the Federal Government in the same market place, with selling horses in this scenario?  There is no shortage of horses in the US market to justify the Federal or State government to be producing low quality feral horses in this number, to be dumped onto the public at give away prices.",1363046400,,1420,4.907949790794979

We developed so much interests in the mustangs that we plan to go to one of these makeover events. The horses are absolutely beautiful and the trainers are very interesting people. The love some of them have for their mustangs is so touching. A great feel-good documentary.

It follows the progress of a few mustangs and the people who gentle them from their initial meeting as wild horse and person to competing in a show competition a little over 3 months later.  It films how they are worked with to prepare for the competition where they will show what they have accomplished in just 100 days.  Amazing IS the word for what they have accomplished.  I have watched this film about 6 times since I received last week and thoroughly enjoyed each viewing.  My husband really likes this movie and has watched it with me every time!  It is a really good viewing experience!  The horses and their ""horse whisperers"" are sometimes funny, sometimes sad but always interesting.  Some of the people who participate will surprise you.  The expressions of the horses caught by the camera are priceless, especially the look of the horse in the ""pool table scene.""

I think they are nice enough, but if I hadn't gotten free tickets with my film festival pass, I probably would have skipped this movie. This film was the best one I had seen the entire festival. It was so good, I looked up the future festival schedule and called out-of-state family members to tell them they had to see it when it hit their towns. I obsessively checked the Facebook page, waiting for news of a DVD release. The film is beautiful and the stories are touching.

5287529,5,B009999YD2,"""If you can find something you love to do; and you're good at it, you're blessed."" This film uniquely demonstrates what committing to that 'horse-connection' so many of us sense but can't put into words can be like. It showed success as an inner, living experience chock full of miniscule failures, bruises and patient rewards. This is demonstrated taking wild mustangs and training them for public auction within 100 days. The effort and win is set apart from materialism; even the grand winner gets only $5,000. Hardly a lot for over 3 months worth of work, feed, travel, etc. There's real-life demonstration that there's no success without failure (Teddy Roosevelt) - there's a part in the movie where a horse previously seen able to practically cut-meat suddenly lays down in the competition. The Extras are well-worth watching as well.

I was so utterly taken with the film that as soon as the rental was over, I ordered it from Amazon.

It also reminded me to get more involved with some people who use horses to help the emotionally damaged.",1356912000,,1048,4.849162011173185

5287531,5,B009999YD2,"I loved this movie; I liked how real everyone in it was, how they weren't painted to look like horse whisperers, and I liked that all the filmmakers' commentary was written and not voiced over. This movie really showed the trainability of the Mustang and how a wild horse levels the playing field amongst trainers. I've spent years looking for a place to show horses that wasn't about money or breeding, and even the small schooling shows I go to are now being used to season young top-dollar horses, making it difficult for myself and my little unregistered quarter horse gelding to be competitive amongst the flash and sparkle. I've been around Mustangs for years, and thought about adopting a Mustang before, but this movie and the Extreme Mustang Makeover have really motivated me to do it. The movie itself was extremely well done, I wish there were a lot more like it!

*A little bit of a spoiler alert* As a side note, there's been some flack about Wylene's part in the movie being annoying, but I personally found her to be a nut and one heck of a horsewoman. I would love to send a horse to the two brothers or Jesus Jauregui to train - all three have exceptional gifts. The older gentleman who wouldn't let his wife keep her mustang, but then kept his was....well... you could tell why he'd been married seven times.",1356134400,,1326,4.571428571428571
5287532,5,B009999YD2,"I've loved horses for more than 50 years now, and I've owned a Mustang and I will again.  This movie shows you the bare bones of what it takes to take a wild horse and show him/her that it's okay to trust a human.  I don't use the word ""break"", I don't want to ever ""break"" one, that means it needs to be fixed.  I want to gentle one, to teach him how to be my partner.  You will see that same attitude over and over in this beautiful film, and you'll see the amazing results kindness and patience brings.
The movie follows just a few of the 100 people who get 100 Mustangs; they have 100 days to turn the horse into a willing, trustworthy partner.  After the 100 days, the trainers compete in a special event with their mustangs.  After the event, the horses are auctioned off to the highest bidder, and that is where the tears come in.  Some of the folks spotlighted have trained before, some are total newbies, one or two will leave you shaking your head and talking to the TV screen, particularly if you know how to train; a few will make you smile and nod.  The brothers from the East Coast are nothing short of phenomenal, the Spanish trainer from Wisconsin, and the brash blond from the Southwest all blew me away.  Yes, she was brash, but she knows her job and was riding her horse after just 3 days; you can't argue with such success and the obvious love she has for the Mustangs.  It's that love the movie features from beginning to end.
If you love horses, if you know someone who loves horses, this is the movie to get them, hands down this IS the definitive horse movie of all time, imho. :))",1356048000,16,1605,4.25

5287534,5,B009999YD2,"We rented this movie tonight, and loved it so much we wasted no time signing into Amazon to purchased three ""Wild Horse, Wild Ride"" DVDs as gifts for fellow horse lovers including a natural horsewoman, who has a gift for horse communication, and two ladies at our barn who are as crazy about horses as we are!

Can't wait to dig out from under holiday bills to get a copy of our own! If you spend as much time as we do with these magnificent, sensitive beings, or if you just want to better understand the nature of horses, and the path to the bonding with the people who love them, this is the movie for you.

Warning: If you have a child who yearns for a horse, this movie could be the trigger for relentless begging. It's now late at night, and I can hardly wait for tom'w when we can again spend time with our horses. :)

8538031,5,B009999YD2,"As someone who has trained and rode horses before I could walk, this was very endearing.  A couple of the trainers made me cringe, especially George.  There is a reason he was married 7 times and that horse figured him out from day one.  I don't think Waylon ever will fully trust him or give him full respect.  The only reason that horse submitted was George is extremely heavy weight wise and heavy handed.  Which is why they carefully edited his scenes in the documentary.  I was sorry to learn of his cancer, I lost a father to cancer, but empathy only goes so far when you are rough with a horse.  That girl that was green and had never trained a horse before, you know that she definitely did NOT train that horse herself, that professional trainer did most of the work.  It was clearly evident when she rode.  My favorite trainer was hands down Jesus.  I got very teary eyed when I watched him ride Compadre in the auction.  Tugged at my heart strings.  You could tell he absolutely loved that horse and that horse respected him 1000%.  If you are new to horses, watching George ride is a ""what NOT to do"".  Watching Jesus is definitely a ""what to do"".  Horses are very sensitive and intelligent animals.  They can figure you out within seconds.  They can tell if you are nervous, scared, compassionate or someone who is not patient and rough.  Watch the horses ears, they speak volumes, watch the body language when the humans are near them.  Compadre leaned into Jesus, that speaks volumes.  Waylon tried to pull away from George.  Total opposites.  I hope George beat the cancer, I would never wish that on anyone.",1517184000,,1624,4.527586206896552
8538032,5,B009999YD2,Awesome movie. Get to see the different approaches to training. I have always been one to train from above the horse.  Get them to trust me and bond first.
