8349442,4,B0021TVZ2A,"I was impressed by this film most kung fu movies made in the early 70's had fairly good plots with low quality martial arts because they were beginning to understand proper techique and film editing. But this film has a good plot and the fight scenes are of high quality. Sammo Hung appears in this film as a bandit and does a good job, the main character is played by Chang Yi he fights well throughout the film and gives a great performance in the final action scene.",1372809600,,469,4.340909090909091
