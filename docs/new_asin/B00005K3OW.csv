7943107,5,B00005K3OW,"VHS movies for your VCR is a fantastic place to buy from!!!! The package was wrapped extremely well so no damage was done to the tape. My son has autism and loves to shop online (with mom's help). He seems to have a knack for wanting items that you cannot get easily. And he has a very hard time waiting for the ""present"" to come. VHS movies for your VCR sent the package right away!!!! And we received the tape quickly so it made my son Twice as happy!! He got an tape in excellent condition and got it quickly. I will order from them again and highly suggest them to others",1372982400,,575,4.142857142857143

7943111,5,B00005K3OW,"I found this video on clearance at a drug store and wasn't expecting much for my $4. Since this was my first exposure to the Book of Pooh, it took me a little time to get used to the puppet animation. We have some of the cartoon animated Pooh stories, and at first I was a bit of a snob about them being more ""true to the original."" Now I'm shifting my efforts to find more videos in the Book of Pooh series.
I think this is an original twist on a classic, and the animation is well done. I can't figure out exactly how they blend the puppets and computer animation, but it's like eye candy for my toddler. I'm also happy that the voices in this video are identical to those in the classic series. The character voices really add a lot to the Pooh stories.
Fun With Words is a great way to get toddlers more aware of language. It's not a phonics lesson, so put away your flash cards. Instead, language is presented as one of many ways to express one's self. I like this approach to pre-reading skills a lot.
One thing I find particularly notable about this video is that the songs are refreshingly different than the usual mass-produced children's fare. ""Where Do Words Go?"" is an interesting harmony piece that sounds like it's sung by a contemporary group (though I'm not sure who sings it). The video also features a funk piece that really turned my head the first time I heard it. It's fun and somewhat comical, and I like the fact that my son can listen to the same genre of music I listen to in a friendly context. Also, I find it very amusing to watch the puppets dance to this music, especially Rabbit, because it's a little out of character.
All in all, I really like this video, and I'm not tired of it yet, even though my almost 3 year old wants to watch it several times a week.",1070582400,,1790,4.252199413489736
7943112,1,B00005K3OW,"Although I haven't had cable TV for some time now, it seems that Disney has decided to bring Pooh & Co. back in yet another incarnation, this time as a series on the Disney Channel and as puppets with computer-generated backgrounds. Kanga and Roo are MIA, but the rest of the gang (Pooh, Piglet, Rabbit, Tigger, Owl and Eeyore) are still around, and are joined by a newly generated (and blandly generic) bluebird character named Kessie. Each ""episode"" (of which there are four on this release) claims to have a lesson to impart, but these are pitifully simple lessons, such as that everyone has a special sort of laugh, or that communication can be accomplished without words.  Perhaps the developmental psychologists can do better than I can in determining how all of this educates our youngsters--for my part, I think it's probably as worthless as all television, if (in this case) relatively harmless.
Regardless, my daughter loves all the ""Book of Pooh"" tapes (there are, as of this writing, three of them, including this one, ""Fun with Friends,"" and the ""Book of Pooh"" general release). Viewers should be warned of the high variability in quality among these tapes--and also that this tape in particular is by far the worst of them.  ""Fun with Words"" is from a different world than the worthwhile ""Fun with Friends""--the stories are pointless, the songs forgettable.  One musical number in particular is astonishing, a faux-soul bit called ""Make a Sign"" that has these beloved characters grinding their hips like dance-floor divas; one can only hope the puppeteers were doubled over laughing as they did it.
I would advise any self-respecting adult to avoid this; on the other hand, any adult interested in purchasing it is doing so with a very young child in mind.  A very young child will not realize how bad this video is--certainly mine doesn't, and while this is not her favorite video, the fact that it has Pooh in it means she'll watch it through with rapt attention.  Go ahead, if you must.",1015632000,2,2003,4.845029239766082
7943113,5,B00005K3OW,"It does not get any better then this video. I have all the Book Of Pooh series and this one is on top. My 18-month-old girl LOVES it! There are four 12 minute stories plus a Rolie Polie Olie story. All in all it is 1 full hour long! Since most children's videos are 30 minutes or less, it is nice to get one a full hour long. And she is entralled with the show for the entire hour- That's a lot to say for this tape with my highly active toddler! The stories are all fantastic. The first one is about Eyorre who gives everyone a special Valentine card and they try to give one back to Eyorre but make him gloomier. It is a wonderful story. The second story is about nothing. There is no story happening so Mr. Narrator makes one up. This is my childs favorite story by far. The third story in about the adventures of Don Poohotay as he seeks his honey. The forth story is about trying to find what Eyorre does best and finding out that he is pretty special after all. Then the Rolie Polie Olie short is about Peek-a-boo. Nothing funner then that for a toddler! I only wish these tapes were on DVD then it would be perfect.",1014768000,3,1122,4.127853881278539
