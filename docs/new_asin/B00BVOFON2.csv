8574568,5,B00BVOFON2,Martin Hall is a master of golf instruction. I am watching this video religiously to improve my putting game. He is one of the most highly respected golf instructors around. This video was definitely worth buying!,1524614400,,213,4.944444444444445

8574570,5,B00BVOFON2,"If you watch the Golf Channel at all, I certainly do not need to sell you on martin Hall as a teacher.  he is simply one of the best around.  the thing that I love about his style of teaching is that he not only easily explains what you need to do, but he tells you exactly why you get the bad results you get when you do what you do natrually.  I especilly like the training tools he introdces, including a metrodone to keep the pace and tempo of your swing.  ""hearing"" the tempo in your head actually relaxes you and takes all the other stressful thoughts out of nailing that 12 foot putt.  he teaches you to learn the techniques, then just ""lock it in""

  Since the driving range i frequesnt most  does not have a putting green, I really hadn't gotten a chance to work on my stroke, so therefore didn't study it much.  But after seeing this DVD, I ordered a putting mat (from my good friends at amazon :) ).  You can get the metronome app from the iTunes or Google apps store and load it to your phone for free.  (I have mine on my Ipad.)  so on the most recent rain day, when i couldn't get out to the range, i had my mat and iPad, and Martin's DVD, and I could really feel these things getting ingrained.  I highly recommend this DVD if you want to really improve your putting.  stroke AND tempo, which are the hallmark of this part of the game.  enjoy!!

By the way, Mr Hall is also one of the instuctors on the ""Touch and Tempo"" DVD in this series, which is also outstanding.",1370908800,,1482,4.125874125874126
