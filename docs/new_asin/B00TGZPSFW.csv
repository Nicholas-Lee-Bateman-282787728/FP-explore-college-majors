7009595,5,B00TGZPSFW,"The saga of the slightly dysfunctional, highly entertaining Doyle family of St. John's Newfoundland came to a much-lamented end in this, its sixth and final season, and it did so in spectacular fashion.
For those who are unfamiliar with the series, a little background is perhaps in order: Former cops Jake Doyle and his father Malachy run a small private detective agency in St. John's. The family includes Jake's niece Tinny, who started out as a troubled teen but is now a cop; Des Courtland, a former graffiti artist who is now a member of the agency; Sloan Daniels, Jake's previously unknown daughter from a long-ago affair; Malachy's wife Rose, who keeps the books and sometimes helps out on investigations; Jake's sister Kathleen, who is Tinny's mother; and his brother Christian, a former lawyer and former drug addict.
Jake has been trying - without success - to add one more member to the family: Police Sergeant Leslie Bennett and he have had an on-again, off-again romance through the first five seasons and just when it seemed that they might finally get together for good she was kidnapped and buried alive at the end of Season Five.
In the sixth season opener Jake is in prison after being arrested for the murder of a former St. John's mayor - who was once Leslie's boyfriend; Leslie is in a coma; Sloan has disappeared after stealing all of the family's money and things are not looking good for the clan. That forces Malachy to take on any case he can to earn enough income so that he can try to keep pace with the family's bills and some of them are just a little weird. Jake, meanwhile, is having a tough time in prison because he is surrounded by men he helped put there.
Season Six brings back some favorite characters from previous seasons including Jake's ex-wife, Dr. Nikki Renhold. It also ties up some loose ends from previous seasons and ends in what was, for me, a very satisfying way. As always, the scripts contain the right amount of drama and comedy and the narratives move along smoothly. St. John's, which qualifies as one of North America's most beautiful cities, serves as the perfect backdrop for this final season, as it has for the previous five.
Highly recommended.",1430438400,7,2206,4.717616580310881

7009598,5,B00TGZPSFW,"I have really enjoyed this series. I've been to St. John's and Trinity and have driven around Newfoundland and Labrador. It's beautiful and the people are lovely. This program captures so much of that. This is a fun program, not to be taken as a serious police/PI procedural at all. Just enjoy it for the fun characters and interesting stories as well as for the great cast and guests.",1460419200,,385,4.594202898550725

7009608,5,B00TGZPSFW,"I have always loved this program !!  I came in on the second season and have since purchased all the seasons since this show, while shown at rather anarchic times here in the US, has never been fully embraced. Besides, it's much better to enjoy a show that can really only be described as a cross between THE ROCKFORD FILES and NORTHERN EXPOSURE on DVD. When it was announced by creator-star Allan Hawco that he was ending the series,buying the final season not only made sense, but was a must !! And, frankly, it did not disappoint. The show will be missed, but it does go out on a high note. You couldn't ask for more about a show you richly enjoy.",1443830400,,650,4.327868852459017

7009612,5,B00TGZPSFW,"An incredible final season to an incredible series. It was nice to see so many guest actors that appeared in the series over the years brought back for one last "" curtain call "". Though I'm sorry the show has ended, it's probably better to go out while there is still some life left in the show than to have to "" jump the shark "". I hope we haven't seen the last of the ""Republic"".",1439337600,3,381,4.026315789473684

7009617,2,B00TGZPSFW,"I liked the first several seasons, but the producers clearly were running out of ideas by season 6, and they started putting out more outrageous plots. The romance just got to be too ridiculous, too much of the same romantic frustration, too much unnecessary running around, criminals getting too nasty. The plots just got too extreme and (more) unbelievable for my taste.",1435449600,5,372,5.016129032258065
