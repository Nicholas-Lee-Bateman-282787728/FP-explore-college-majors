7900690,5,7885166635,Great!  Even though the story gets repetitive at times and the first couple episodes got a bit irritating...the characters finally evolve and become interesting.  SSH is wonderful as well as being super to look at.  Enjoy the variety of characters and multiple plot lines.  It is 56 episodes..so be prepared for many hours of good entertainment.,1397088000,2,345,5.107142857142857
