8084951,5,B000BC8T1Y,"The Biggest Little Star is a jam-packed Shirley Temple Fest featuring a full-length biography as the main program. Many old time stars, and co-stars, give their insight along with clips from Shirley's famous movies as well as photo's and clips of newsreels from Shirley's era.

What makes this DVD a treasure is the special features. First you get the original trailers for Dimples, Heidi, Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, Little Miss Broadway, and The Little Princess. You also get the Movietone newsreel(clips include Shirley accepting an award, riding a small pony, having a picnic, mailing a letter, etc.) along with footage of a grown-up Shirley in the White House with then-president Gerald Ford.

And finally, you get the 6 mins or so deleted scenes from her 1938 movie, Little Miss Broadway. The extra scenes include Shirley cross-examining Jimmy Durant along with a dance scene where Shirley is swooped up onto a podium. For this scene, there is an alternate camera angle.

Overall really a great DVD that features a ton of Shirley Temple treasures some of which probably has not been seen for decades. Please do not hesitate to purchase this DVD if you are a fan of one of the biggest childstars of all-time, Little Miss Shirley.",1204243200,5,1234,4.951690821256038
8084952,5,B000BC8T1Y,"What is so great about this DVD  is the extras!!  The biography  which was shown on  the A&E channel in 1996 is the same , its 90 minutes but, what  has knocked me out is the fantastic extras!!!

There are some  movie trailers which  are  DIMPLES and HEIDI and  REBECCA OF SUNNYBROOK FARM and LITTLE MISS BROADWAY and LITTLE PRINCESS. now of course LITTLE  MISS BROADWAY is the great one because of its alternate camera angles  not used in the movie.

Well, the  great  other extras  is  a number-of Movietone Newsreels andTHERE ARE SOME NEW ONES NEVER BEFORE AVAILABLE ON  VIDEO OR DVD!!!  I  totally  was in shock  to see these. to have these new ones is a real treasure to me!! Also the picture quality for these is super!!  One of the new  newreels has Shirley  on set of STOWAWAY outside and the Dionne Quints Guardian  is talking to her  about  the girls and Shirley  asks him  a few  questions and then he asks her what  her dog's name is  that she is holding  and she says ""Ching Ching"" and he asks her what  that  means in english  and she says ""Precious"" and he says ""just like you!"".WOW! and the way  she talks and how so adorable she is here is a real knockout!  There is a newsreel  from the time of Little Miss Broadway  where she is outside and is mailing  an envelope for March  of Dimes and she talks about  how 10 cents is not too much.  Some newsreels are the ones  that are common but some seem to be extended a bit which is nice!!

Now ,these new newsreels which are fantastic and a real treasure is just  the tip of the iceburg! What  is totally  a real knockout is  the complete deleted  scene from LITTLE MISS BROADWAY!!! This  lasts for 6 minutes and 25 seconds!!!!! it starts with just  Jimmy  questioning himself on the stand, this last  about  2 minutes and then Shirley comes into the scene!

its so cute!!  What it is is the exact part that was to be used in the movie, as there are segments where there is no sound.  Also,  there is  a great  alternate camera angle thats on Shirley as they do the 'Hop ,Skip  and Jump"" number.  The part where there is no sound is  where Jimmy  sings the ending parts  of ""thats the dance of tomorrow today"". and then, What is shown next  is where Ole comes into the scene and he has a foot up as he comes into the scene. and then  he and Shirley  and Jimmy  sing  and do a little  skate dance.  The 3 of them  then sing  the ending of the song  which is great  and we then see them  from the front of the room some feet away  from them.  When this ends, it then  shows  most of the footage shown  on the  biography where  you hear the director and  Shirley  plays around with  the clapper  thing and then she stands there with Jimmy  seated and has her finger pointing at  him  and then  after a bit, she sings the song but its not shown  complete and then  as she sings this, theres  footage of her standing  and smiling  and its at  a fast  speed and then it goes to normal  speed as we see its an alternate camera angle of when Jimmy  picks her up and she stands on  one foot.  There is more  then what I  described  to these scenes but I am just  so in  shock  at  seeing  this new stuff its like  I have opened a treasure chest of little Shirley  lost footage and I feel I am dreaming.

This is truly  a great  DVD for this  great  6 minute deleted scene and for the great new newsreels!!!!  This  is a real keeper of a DVD that  all fans of  little Shirley  will want!

A real gem of a Shirley  DVD goodie!!",1134864000,23,3479,4.117557251908397
