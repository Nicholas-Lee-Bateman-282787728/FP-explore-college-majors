420757,3,6302041147,"I recommend this movie for its beautiful romantic story with historical backdrops (WWII, Japanese interns, etc), great chemistry between the 2 leads (Dennis Quaid and Tamlyn Tomita) and the lovely photography. Dennis Quaid looked so handsome and wholesome here (I don't understand - how could Meg?!)
Tamlyn Tomita shines here as well (she's also adorable in movies like ""Karate Kid"" and ""The Joy Luck Club"").",980640000,4,408,5.292307692307692

420760,5,6302041147,"Come See The Paradise is a film that looks deeply into cultural differences when a white Irish-American man becomes interested in, and ulitmately marries a Japanese-American woman.  Dennis Quaid and Tamlyn  Tomita portray their charecters extremely well.  The movie looks at the  impact of World War II on Japanese-Americans as they are sent to camp.  The  effect that this treatment has on the families is examined in great detail  amd with great objectivity.  It is a vivid lesson on emotion and hysteria  overpowering logic and common sense.  The impact of internment on the  Japanese-Americans who underwent this violation of constitutional rights is  still being felt today.  It is a piece of American history that has been  muted, if not ignored, for decades.  This movie is an attempt at getting  the story of Japanese-American internment out to a broader audience than  those interested in constitutional law or domestic history.  It is a movie  that is well worth seeing, not once but several times.  The acting by all  is exceptional and leaves a listing imprint on the mind's eye.  It is a  bright light on a dark chapter in America's history.",927417600,57,1154,4.98941798941799

420769,5,6302041147,"I've never seen this film in its entirety until I noticed it on Amazon Instant Video. I was very moved. My mother is Japanese so it resonated with me on a cultural level. While our family was not part of the Japanese/Californian relocation, one can sense the deep emotion of what war does to all of us. There are chillingly similar relocation scenes that remind me of various Holocaust movies. I didn't realize Alan Parker directed this and there are scenes of labor incidents that surprisingly remind me of scenes from Evita. Dennis Quaid and Tamlyn Tomita are perfect leads for this historical epic. The soundtrack is emotional and striking with some great popular music of the era.

420805,5,6302041147,"I enjoyed the movie very much. One of the things that it focuses on is the distressing injustice that Japanese-Americans were subject to following the Pearl Harbor attack. I found myself projecting upon myself the trauma that these people faced being pulled from their homes, losing virtually all of their worldly possessions in the process, then being force-moved to camps and living conditions that were appalling. How they coped and remained at least mildly positive is hard to fathom. The thought that this country did that to an entire ethnic class of citizens is appalling and you can easily sense some of the parallels to today's world and fears. I think the movie is a must-see to acknowledge this history. Tamlyn Tomita's role is convincing and beautifully acted; And she's absolutely, positively a gorgeous woman.

420839,4,6302041147,"We have seen a number of films on the interment of Japanese Americans written from the viewpoints of American, British and Japanese authors.  This film adds to our knowledge of American history by capturing realistically what life in the interment camps was like for the 110,000 who were interred there.  The Author and director, Alan Parker, did extensive research to ensure the historical and cultural authenticity of the events in this film.  The Japanese American actors and Dennis Quaid gave very effective performances in this film.  The only lapse in cultural authenticity (which must have been added by Hollywood for romantic interest) was the kiss on the first date scene would have been culturally extremely unlikely back then.  We hope that seeing this film will help Americans to avoid unfair treatment of loyal immigrant residents because of America's outsized fear of terrorism.  The state laws back then prohibiting interracial marriage are fortunately laughable and nonexistent in this age.  The surprising thing is that many of us in our generation did not learn about the interment camps (or those prejudiced marriage laws) until we reached college age.  Films like this one bring us a sensitive understanding of new immigrant citizens.  Almost all of them came here legally for a better life, not to harm or take away opportunities from other Americans.",1388448000,,1372,5.2

A study of cultural differences, and how the American government became no better than those with whom they fought in WWII, ""Come to the Paradise"" is also a love story.  Over the one hour + a mother re-tells her story to her daughter.  It is in the substance of that story the viewer finds meaning;  meaning not only for the child to build a positive and productive life, but meaning for the viewer to - perhaps - re-think and re-interpret some of their own live-changing events.

Unfortunately some of the performances, namely Quaid's, felt over-the-top, lacking nuance.  His outrage to strangers, in front of his daughter while arguing with his wife, etc was way too intense.  As a parent, watching him yell in front of his young daughter, oblivious to her presence, made him seem more of a bull-headed moran rather than, in his case, someone fighting for workers rights.

This story is about a interracial marriage and what happens in this time of war and the times before the war.  Dennis Quaid did a very good job of acting and so did the Japanese actors.

420874,3,6302041147,"This was an OK movie. I was required to watch this movie for school for I am currently taking a course about the US Government. The movie deals with civil liberties violations that the japanese-Americans went through after the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. The Japanese-Americans were subsequently rounded up and placed into internment camps throughout the American west.

My instructor made a big deal about this movie so, once I saw it, I was quite disappointed for I was expecting American troops, police, etc crashing into homes in the middle of the night and herding American citizens off to the train station and such. Nope - none of that. The movie is based on a love relationship between a white American male and a Japanese-American woman. They have a child together. The husband does something wrong, is given parole, is then forced to join the military.

Meanwhile, his wife and child are sent to the Manzannar Japanese-American Internment Camp in California. Throughout the movie, various questions about civil liberties violations do arise, but those questions are not dwelled upon nor answered very well. IF I had not needed to watch/review this movie for a college class, then I may have rated it higher, but I was focusing most of my attention on the civil liberties violations aspects and was dissapointed.

Ordered this movie via Amazon for it was really the only place that I could find this movie, and have it sent to me in a timely manner. If not for some recent snow storms that passed through my area, movie would have arrived as promised, but it actually arrived 3 days later.

Quaid and Tomita are authentic, and if there is any flaw in the film, it would lie in the fact that it did not show the true ugliness of denying Americans their civil rights, due process and property.

The other point that truly made me think relates to the fact that I am a white male who is married to an Asian woman. Given the laws of the period, my marriage would have not been legal. When that hit me, it truly made me think. To think that during the twentieth century, society was still segregating people is nothing short of abhorrent. The scene involving the store Santa Claus brought tears to my eyes, as did the dialogue where the daughter was speculating if her father would remember her.

420933,4,6302041147,"I first saw this a requirement for a history class, when we were studying the effects of Japanese internment in the United States on those who were forced to stay in the barracks, due to Executive Order 9066, authorized by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in 1942.  This order allowed local military commanders to designate ""military areas"" as ""exclusion zones"", from which ""any or all persons may be excluded."" This power was used to declare that all people of Japanese ancestry were excluded from the entire Pacific coast, including all of California and most of Oregon and Washington, except for those in internment camps.  The seizure and relocation of all people of Japanese ancestry surged following the bombing of Pearl Harbor, when anyone of that background was viewed potentially as a spy and ""anti-American.""  COME SEE THE PARADISE takes a look at that part of United States history.

Irish-American Jack McGurn (Dennis Quaid) gets a job at a movie theater and falls in love with his boss's daughter, Lily Kawamura (Tomlyn Tomita).  This enrages her father who fires Jack and forbids him to see her.  Despite this, the couple continues to see each other and they leave for Seattle.  It is at this time that all people of Japanese ancestry are being forceably placed in the internment camps.

This film is well-acted and I think it's wonderful to see the story and experience of the internment camps brought to life as an engaging film.  This part of our nation's history needs to be acknowledged and I think that this film really pays tribute to all of the people whose lives were turned upside down because of the government enforced order between 1942 and 1946.",1187395200,8,1677,4.897526501766785

420937,4,6302041147,"When Come See the Paradise first came out late in 1990 in played in a very limited release.  In it's first weekend it only played in 5 theaters, widening to a whopping 25 theaters by it's third week which ultimately led to a grand total of $947,306.00 at the box office in it's theatrical run.  This one flew completely under the radar, and that's a shame.

Why?  Because Come See the Paradise is a fine, well crafted movie with a subject matter that hasn't gotten much attention, even though it should have.

Dennis Quaid plays an Irish-American in trouble with the law who moves to Los Angeles and ultimately falls in love with a Japanese-American girl.  This is just prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese.  The girl's father wants her to have nothing to do with Quaid, but Quaid's Jack McGurn (McGann while ""hiding"" from the law) persists and ultimately wins over the girl, if not her family.

The script is well written, touching on prejudice and racism in a restrained, sober way.  The movie doesn't hit you over the head with messages on the evils of prejudice and racism, instead it shows the results of such beliefs and behaviors and lets the viewer come to his or her own conclusions.  The story between Jack and Lily (played by the wonderful, and quite beautiful Tamlyn Tomita) is quite touching and played in a very sensitive manner.

Of course, the movie shifts to the post Pearl Harbor events, and Jack and Lily are separated as she and her family are forced by the U.S. Government into a Japanese Internment Camp, and Jack ultimately ends up in the Army.

The ending of the movie is a bit anti-climactic, and not quite the resolution that the movie deserves (as the movie runs out of steam dramatically).  But, then again, in real life would the ending of such a story have been any more satisfying?  Probably not.

Alan Parker's direction is fantastic, and his script is moving and quite touching.  The acting in Come See the Paradise is also quite good, as Dennis Quaid is in top form, and Tamlyn Tomita is excellent as well.  The supporting cast - too many to name individually - is also quite good from top to bottom.

For a different perspective on the World War II era, or just for a really solid drama, you can't do much better than Come See the Paradise.",1166918400,27,2290,4.54390243902439

420940,5,6302041147,"This movie is an excellent introduction to a fairly recent period of American history-the internment of Japanese First Generation and Second Generation Americans in concentration camps. I loved the atmosphere of Little Tokyo as presented here. The love story which is at the heart of this movie is good. In the background WWII and how it changed the lives of Japanese Americans. How did this happen in a land which prides itself on being a symbol of democracy and freedom? The acting, photography, and story are all excellent. Truly a moving experience!

The included documentary, ""Rabbit in the Moon,"" is a very personal memoir of living in the camps. It also explains why some first generation Japanese refused to give up their Japanese citizenship. They were NOT allowed American citizenship! They would have become stateless persons! Damned if you do! Damned if you don't! In addition, it explains the antagonism between the JACL(Japanese American Citizens League) and the older Issei leadership. For example, parental discipline and family ties almost completely broke down in the camps. The U.S. government, indeed, fostered this by promoting the power of the JACL(composed of young, born-in-the-U.S.A second generation Japanese-American citizens)over the first generation who were not allowed to become citizens. It was kids vs. their parents! As one of the interviewees states, children were allowed to run free and, if they wanted, they didn't even have to stay with their parents. Of course undisciplined children quickly form gangs with their peers. These are examples from ""Rabbit in the Moon.""

420962,5,6302041147,"I was both surprised and very pleased today when I received ""Come See The Paradise"" to find that it was a special edition with commentary by Sir Alan Parker, the director, a feature length documentary and other features including a short essay on the making of the film by Sir Alan Parker.  However, none of the special features were ever listed on any web sites nor were they advertised by 20th Century Fox in any press release.  Worse still is that this important film of an important subject matter has been released without any promotion or proper marketing usually given to dvds of films that are far inferior.

I can only assume that, in these times, any film depicting America as not the land of dreams and liberty, but more a country that was racist and not to disimilar to the countries it was fighting is not welcome.  We may justify how we treated the Japanese by their attack on Pearl Harbour, or cite the war mongering on the Chinese, especially at Nanking, but two wrongs do not make a right.  Why were Italians and Germans in the United States not treated in the same manner as the Japanese?  In fact, there were many Germans who were actively spying In America for the Nazis and yet the community as a whole was left relatively untouched and intact.  In Europe, Germans, Italians and other pro-nazi Europeans were responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans and yet it was only the Japanese in the United States who were treated so disgustingly.  In addition, not only were they exploited by the U.S. government, but also by many of it's citizens, especially when the Japanese were forced to sell belongings.  Former neighbours who once said 'good morning' thought nothing of taking advantage of a community's misfortune and amassing property left behind or sold off at bargain basement prices.  When the Japanese returned they returned to nothing and were forced to start again.

Furthermore, how then do we justify our treatment of African Americans, especially when we were supposed to fighting for freedom from tyranny and yet were montorous to a people who had just as much right to America as 'White' counterparts ?  Much of the entire United States and all of the South was built on the backs of African-Americans and yet it was only forty years ago or so that they were first allowed to vote without getting lynched.  An active system of apartheid lasted in the United States well into the seventies and even now race is still the major issue in America.  One only has to look at last year's disaster in Louisiana and it's aftermath to realise that racism is alive and well in 21st century America.  Even now there are many in the White race that think that they have a god given right to subjugate, disenfranchise and dominate other ethnic commmunities.  In fact, the only true 'Americans' are the Native American Indians.  The rest and their children were all immigrants or descendants of immigrants.

Much of America during the war was simply racist and,  while there were many within who fought the good war against such despicable beliefs, most were no better than their German counterparts.  This may be difficult for many to accept but if you were to examine American history in detail, what I state is absolutely correct.  What is sad is that we never seem to learn from history.",1150329600,7,3328,4.72318339100346

420965,5,6302041147,"""Come see the Paradise"" is an amazing film in essence this film does what Michael Moore and ""Fahrenheit 911"" do remind us of an ugly of American history commited by several

 abusive bureaucractic leaders imposing their form of corrupted civil governments and laws.

 The film takes place during WWII and like ""Snow Falling on Cedars"" (another great story about the anti-Japanse movement during this time) is about an American, who falls in love

 with a Japanese women. The two fall in love regardless of their race backgrounds.

 The girls fathers does not like the White Man, but eventually the family accepts him as partof the family, and this LOVE IS TESTED during the war.

 Dennis Quaid stars as Jack McGurn a liberal Irish activist who is trying to believe form a union, now forming a Union back then was like being a Communist in this warp

 view of America. It was pure nonsense and people like disgraced military men like MacArthur and other abusive military leaders wanted to quite down people who spoke out against governemnt corruption. This of course has been the case across history , even movie directors like the late great Elia Kaza have been targeted. Back to the movie:

 Tamyln Tomita as the love interest, Lily Yuriko , is absolutely great portraying all the anguish of a women in love, but then feels pain and sorrow when she sees her own people being put in Concentration Camps by the Americans and are given no rights, no real jobs (except menial low paying ones) and no hope.

 (Spoilers)

 During one dramatic and painful sequence that has to be seen the father is arrrested for no reason and taken into custody, he is then released and is then labeled as traitor leading

 into a great depression which eventually hurts his spirits and he dies. Quaid deserves a great recommendation for his performance as one of a few Americans who sees whats going and realizes that this is wrong. At one point, like many men he

 is forcibly drag into the war, and then goes AWOL to see his love and her Japanese family to provide support its very touching still the US carries it's vendetta with the Japanese

 leading to Atom bomb being dropped on Hiroshima and the bombing

 of Pearl Harbor.

 If you don't cry watching this movie there is something wrong with you as ""Come See The Paradise"" by Alan Parker has great dramatic performance , a great score by Randy Edelman and a true life story that SHOULD NOT be forgotten.

 The movie is also told primarily through the narration of Lily

 the main character does giving us a very intimate and real

 portrayal of the evennts unfolding onscreen.

 Truly an amazing movie, in fact see it with ""Fahrenheit 911"" so you can see some historic, dramatic events that we as Americans should not forget and learn from.",1090972800,8,2777,4.6770186335403725
