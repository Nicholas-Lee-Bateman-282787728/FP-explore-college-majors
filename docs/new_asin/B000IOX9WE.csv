The film adaptation is surprisingly faithful to the original -- although the doctor and waitress do not exist in the original story, everything that was in the original -- including ALL the images! -- appear in the film, accurately. Another thing in the film that doesnt appear in the book is the part about the student ID number, but again this is a good addition -- who would have thought that the image of someone shouting out a 7-digit number on a city street would be so moving?!

The ending of the film is slightly different to the book, but is done that way in order for the final image of the book to be possible (you will understand if you see the book images).  I also like the way that the book does not explicitly tell you they live happily ever after... until the final back inside page, where you see a small picture of the two umbrellas resting together.  Beautifully understated.

Highly recommended to anyone who likes romances.",1295654400,5,1192,4.49537037037037
8147172,3,B000IOX9WE,"In short, this film will give you insulin shock with how sweet it is. It's a romantic comedy in the classic Asian tradition. Two people are meant for each other and - time and time again - miss each other by inches. Fate keeps sending them in opposite directions and on a series of near misses. It's a fairytale and so light it will have you floating above your sofa after you finish watching it! It has some really silly comedic moments in it as well. Fans of When Harry Met Sally or Sleepless in Seattle type movies will dig this for sure. It helps if you are familiar (and prepared for) Asian film stylings as well. If you like romantic comedies, pick this up. You'll like it.",1247011200,4,679,4.3125
8147173,5,B000IOX9WE,"This is an adorable love story about two people who are destined to be together, and are always in the same vicinity, but never meet. One, a violinist, lives in one flat while his neighbor, the translator, lives in the next flat over. They both leave for their respective jobs in the morning, but never meet because when they leave, one turns left and the other turns right, hence the name of the movie. Kaneshiro-san is an amazing actor, and nails his character perfectly. It's a must-see for those who are suckers, like me, for a romantic comedy.",1230163200,7,548,4.6020408163265305
