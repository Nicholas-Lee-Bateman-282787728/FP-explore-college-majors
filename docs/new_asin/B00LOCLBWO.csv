6496812,5,B00LOCLBWO,"What a great story about finding love after loss.  I haven't received this movie yet, however I have seen it on TV and I find it very entertaining and light hearted.",1409788800,4,165,4.32258064516129
6496823,5,B00LOCLBWO,"""The Christmas Ornament"" (2013) is my favorite movie (so far) in the ""Hallmark Christmas"" genre.

Kellie Martin plays a young widow determined to maintain her husband's Bicycle Store, despite poor sales. Meanwhile, she loves baking batches of delicious Christmas cookies for everyone she knows.

Cameron Mathison plays the handsome, single, and hardworking owner of a Christmas Tree Lot. (He loves Christmas so much, he will even deliver your Christmas tree and set it up for you.)

Jewel Staite plays the Best Friend who prompts Kellie the Widow: it's OK to get a Christmas tree for yourself this year, and it's OK to start dating again.

Will Kellie get a Christmas tree? Can she keep the sad Bicycle Store in business? Or will she realize her dream-career of baking and selling Christmas cookies instead?

Will Cameron get back together with his disloyal Ex-Girlfriend? Or will he date Kellie, who bakes, and who helps him keep his business going? Will these two small-business owners live happily ever after in financial stability?

This Hallmark movie stands out with its good writing, solid storytelling, and engaging performances from the two lead actors.

(Another great Hallmark movie starring Kellie Martin is ""So You Said Yes."")

(Other Hallmark Christmas movies I enjoyed are ""A Princess for Christmas"" starring Katie McGrath, and ""A Royal Christmas"" starring Lacey Chabert.)",1515542400,,1387,5.244343891402715

6496825,5,B00LOCLBWO,"With the economic downturn, it's not been good for small retail businesses. Somewhere maybe in Iowa can be found Dream Cycle, Kathy Howard's underperforming bike shop on Elm Street. Kathy (Kellie Martin) and her one employee, Graham, are crossing their fingers that business will pick up come Christmas, which is only two weeks away.

Actually, Kathy isn't much looking forward to Christmas. It'll be the first one without her husband, Scott, who passed away last year only one month after they'd launched Dream Cycle. Nowadays, Kathy spends her early mornings skating in solitude in the local rink. An avid biker, she pedals everywhere. She's always losing her mittens.

Kathy doesn't plan on putting up a Christmas tree or decorating the house. You can't blame her. She and Scott had this tradition where, every Christmas, they'd give each other a Christmas ornament. This year she can't bear to look at those ornaments, those ""memories on branches."" Scott dearly loved Christmas.

The impetus to the plot proves to be Kathy's meddlesome best friend Jenna Lowe (Jewel Staite) who talks Kathy into going to the local tree lot, Tim's Trees, to help her snag a Christmas tree. On the lot, Kathy wanders into the adjoining gift shop and is bemused by the chaos of the place and, then, by the warmth and easy charm of its proprietor. Right away she gets on well with Tim Pierce (Cameron Mathison), as they good-naturedly commiserate over their plight as fellow humble entrepreneurs. That's the start of it.

The bike shop had always been Scott's passion project, not Kathy's. Kathy is keeping the business alive because of how much it meant to Scott. Kathy's passion, to be honest, lies in baking. She makes these phenomenal cookies. Her childhood pie in the sky was to operate her very own bakery. Obviously, she'd let that dream go.

Hallmark Movies & Mystery launched this movie, The Christmas Ornament, back in 2013, and it's been on steady airplay rotation since. I know this because I watch it every time it comes on the idiot box around the holidays. There seems to be more emotional weight to this movie than other typically breezy Hallmark offerings. It helps that Kellie Martin isn't all glammed up. She looks like a real person here. She looks like she's lived life, and that life, at times, had sucked tremendously. There had always been something likable about Kellie, something down-to-earth, and it's this trait that helps sell the story. You believe her as the grieving young widow who has closed herself off to love. And you believe Cameron Mathison as the kind of sensitive, caring, patient, gently-humored guy who could get thru to her. Cameron is a guy I wouldn't mind having for a neighbor, as someone I'd have over to watch the game and barbecue with. Watch him as he embarks on his delicate courtship.

- Tim (referring to a Christmas tree): ""It's still living, even though it's cut down.""
- Kathy: ""I can relate to that.""

While it feels like this movie is a two-actor showcase, I can't help but single out the supporting cast, specifically Jewel Staite (as ""Jenna""), Laura Mennell (""Rebecca""), and Cole Vigue (""Graham""). Jewel Statite's character, in particular, comes off as someone who, even when off-camera, is carrying on with living her own life. Mennell, as Rebecca, Tim's ex who dumped him for a guy she met in spinning class, is obviously there to disrupt Tim's romance with Kathy. Except Rebecca isn't a bad guy, just a person who chose poorly and is now back in the picture remorsefully trying to win back the guy she let get away. And Vigue as Kathy's sole employee, Graham, is the sort of awesome, upbeat, supportive person you'd want to work for you. I really like all three of these people.

The Christmas Ornament feels like it's telling the story of a real-life couple. It captures genuine emotion and charts the pangs of uncertainty and how two people who'd been hurt in the past may experience cold feet and second thoughts, and how they tend to sabotage their own paths to happiness. When the melodrama isn't peaking, there are moments of levity. There is even a cheesy snowball fight. But the fine cast makes good on this tender story. And Kellie Martin, absent of the trappings of Hollywood glamour, barely any make-up on, has never been more captivating.",1509840000,2,4298,4.846049046321526

6496864,5,B00LOCLBWO,"Hallmark has always made genuinely feel good movies, though in the most recent years, some of them seem to lack the depth of plot and exploration of feelings.  This has long been one of my old time favorites, and often miss it during the ""countdown to Christmas"" marathons.  It is so relatable because not all of us have those perfect holidays, nostalgia, and family gatherings.  This portrays a widow having difficulty experiencing the holiday. It also explores a woman trying to start her own business, her love of baking cookies.  That a 2nd chance at love comes around is done sensitively.",1485475200,,593,4.841584158415841

6496931,3,B00LOCLBWO,"O'kay, right off the bat, all you 5-star reviewers, please don't shoot me; if you loved this movie, I'm delighted for you.  I'm writing this review for those of us who may be more sensitive than you are and may find it a little disturbing.  I didn't hate the movie, but it wasn't my favorite, either.

I just got this as a Christmas gift and was really looking forward to watching it.  It's always advertised with ""A Very Merry Mix-Up,"" which I LOVED and have watched a couple times already.  I was excited to get this one.  Yes, it's Hallmark so a little syrupy, but that's OK, as that's what I was expecting, but this movie wasn't as much fun for me as the Mix-Up, and having lost my dad at a young age and having watched my mom learn to cope and heal, I found it a bit unrealistic that a woman so obviously madly in love with her husband and still holding deep feelings for him (she still teared up when she thought of him or viewed his picture) would even be able to entertain the thought of falling in love with someone else that quickly.  (Her friend, who is pushing her to open up her life again, is an air-headed numb-skull, in my book.  If she really had Kathy's best interest at heart, she should have allowed her enough time to mourn her loss and helped her do that by allowing her to openly express her feelings for Scott and how much he meant to her.)  The fact that Tim fell in love with her instantly wasn't a problem, but if he really were the caring and tender guy he's portrayed to be, he would have been willing to keep his feelings under control until she caught up to him.  The fact that he started planning her life for her (with him in the center of it) was both sweet and at the same time disturbing.  Any man who wants his woman to shut down her feelings and instantly hop on his horse is functioning from a very self-absorbed angle, in my book.  (Watch the way this same subject is handled in Country Remedy; the new-widower doctor is falling in love with the 10-year-widow mayor, yet she gives him permission to grieve the passing of his wife.  He comes back to his office after a ""date"" with the widow and reinstates his wife's photo on his desk, obviously knowing that the widow is going to wait for him to heal.)  ANYWAY, I can't say I didn't enjoy the movie at all, but I likely won't watch it again and will be looking for a good home for it.",1451347200,3,2374,4.235033259423504
6496932,3,B00LOCLBWO,"I liked this movie, but frankly, I'm surprised that it's received so many 5 Stars. For me 5 Star means brilliant, and it certainly isn't that. But I DID enjoy watching it. It's quite unrealistic in parts, and it's a little corny (and I have a high corny tolerance) and it was super predictable. However, it was fun and the sound track was great. I know I will enjoy watching it again in a year or two.

6496993,5,B00LOCLBWO,"I bought this movie as Kellie Martin is one of my favorite actresses.  I've enjoyed Kellie Martin since the 1990s TV show Christy in which she played the title character.  I love that show!  Since that show, Kellie seems to have been mainly doing TV movies.  In this film Kellie plays a widow who is having a very difficult time with Christmas as it was her late-husband Scott's favorite holiday who always specially ordered an ornament for her every year, hence the title The Christmas Ornament.  Kellie is also struggling with her late-husband's bike business which isn't doing very well.

I won't give away too much of the plotline.  Kellie's character ends up meeting a man who sells Christmas trees and owns a small Christmas giftshop.  He's the one that helps encourage her to start a new business as her bike business is failing and the two of course fall in love.

Of the recent releases of Kellie Martin TV movie's I've watched, I like this better than her film Smooch but I do like her in Dear Viola better ONLY because I really like that storyline.  That's not to say that I dislike this film, because I very much do.  Its' a decent TV Christmas movie.",1430265600,2,1163,4.570048309178744

6497115,5,B00LOCLBWO,"Another winner from Hallmark.  This is a sweet Christmas romance that sees a young woman who is running a bicycle shop that was her late husband's dream, and a young man who has a store that sells Christmas trees and much else.  He loves Christmas; she used to love Christmas, until she lost her husband.  The bicycle shop is about to die, but the other store is doing splendidly!  He's even invested in a tree farm so he can cut his own trees.  He's not only a seller but a great lover of Christmas trees, and willing to help people put them up if needs be.  Don't you just love the idea of a full-service Christmas tree lot that stands behind its product?

  They seem a little bit at odds with each other:  he loves Christmas, she can barely stand the thought of it.  But there is a little chemistry that is growing between them and the question becomes, can he help her in getting on with her life?",1421366400,,902,4.27810650887574

6497227,2,B00LOCLBWO,"I love and collect the Countdown to Christmas movies by Hallmark.  This one had the good Hallmark production values, nice Christmas shots, good actors, and some romance; however(and it's a big However), the script in one particular but very important part soured the whole movie for us.

The heroine(expressively played by Kellie Martin) mourns the loss of her beloved husband.  She wants nothing to do with Christmas traditions, other than making yummy cookies.  Ornaments hold a special meaning for her(thus the title).  She meets a tree shop owner who hits it off with her, and she starts to open up to life again.  It's all done nicely, gently and very sentimentally.

Ok, now my issue ***SPOILER ALERT***  Nearing the end of the movie, after she's started to open her heart to him, his beatuiful, model-like ex-girlfriend, who left him and broke his heart, comes back and wants to start up again.  Fine.  He withdraws from the Kellie Martin character- they don't go skating together like usual, he's cold and distant- and she doesn't know what's going on.  That is, until she happens to see them together.  He's apparently trying to figure out what he wants, so he pretty much blows her off.

Nothing happens between him and said old flame, and, of course, he realizes he wants the new girl.  In the meantime, she's heartbroken, throws out her Christmas tree, and accidentally breaks an important ornament.  He returns to her with an attitude of pretty much 'What's the matter with you?'.  She tells him what she saw and that she can't handle the relationship.  He, more or less, chews her out, instead of apologizing for his insensitivity, and storms off.  Later, she runs back to him, after receiving a 'sign', and apologize profusely to him.  Ta-ta, Hallmark happy ending. ***END ALERT***

Well, the whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth.  The movie, otherwise, is alright, and up to typical Hallmark standards.  Perhaps, they needed a woman screenwriter on this because it just doesn't sit well with me. Or perhaps, they wanted to show what happens in real life, so just get over it. I don't think so.

Please, with all the great reviews, somebody convince me that I'm off base here.",1419033600,21,2195,4.825737265415549
6497228,5,B00LOCLBWO,one of my favorite christmas movies.,1419033600,,36,5.166666666666667
6497229,5,B00LOCLBWO,"What a tremendously gifted actress this Kellie Martin is. Here she is portraying a grieving woman who is facing her first Christmas without her much-cherished husband. She does so much with just her face. Her expressions tell a large part of the story and in no time you are feeling with her and sorrowing with her and hoping for her and cheering for her. She really brings you in. I can't imagine how she could have done a more beautiful job. I literally got my Christmas Spirit watching this, which is saying something because I have been in a kind of Scrooge-mode of late.

The story is simple, the characters are not overdone, and the chemistry between the leads is convincing. I could have recorded this off the TV but I came here to Amazon to see if it was on DVD because I wanted a better quality/more permanent copy for my media library.

This one is a KEEPER!",1418947200,,868,4.452830188679245

The only thing we had a hard time getting past at first was that Kellie Martin ""looked"" too old for him.  Even though in real life, I'm sure they are around the same age.  It's a cute holiday romance movie.  We will definitely watch it again next year.",1418688000,,331,4.09375
6497233,5,B00LOCLBWO,"A surprisingly effect holiday romance that isn't quite as formulaic as most of its kind.
A widow (Kellie Martin) is loathed to celebrate Christmas.  Left behind, she struggles to keep her dead husband's dream alive, in this case a bicycle shop she only supported because it was his dream.  Unfortunately, it's not a success, leaving her in financial straits.  She has an opportunity to give it up or sink with its failure.  A chance meeting with a Christmas tree mogul in the making (Cameron Mathison), gives her a spark of hope.  There just might be life after death.  But only if the memories of poor dead husband Scott don't keep her inert, lost in the need to preserve them no matter the cost.  To that end, she is encouraged to bake herself out of her doldrums.  Cookies anyone?

Naturally, this being Hallmark, many of their Keepsake Ornaments are featured.  I found that a bit gratuitous, the worst form of product placement imaginable.  And there are a couple of plot points that don't make much sense.  The widow Kathy's pushy friend (Jewel Staite) finds a sweater in Kathy's kitchen cabinet, making one wonder what kind of baker Kathy is, does she never look in her cupboards when she bakes or is she in the habit of keeping laundry in the kitchen!?  There's also a cringe worthy plot ploy involving an old flame who pops up at the last minute threatening to screw up the romantic angle.  Like that hasn't been done before, incessantly.  (""Are you seeing someone?""  ""Not exactly, maybe.  Just friends."")

Otherwise, a very pleasant film suitable for the holidays.  It could have used a bit more cheer though.",1418688000,,1618,4.734767025089606

A lot of them are light, fluffy movies which I enjoy, but this one had much more depth to it with a few lighter moments thrown in.  The romance between the two leads was very believable, and by the end of the movie I wanted nothing but the best for this couple.  The actress Kellie Martin handled her character with such care, I actually believed everything she was going through, and I understood her reluctance to give love a second chance.  There were so many parts to this movie which I loved, and I could easily quote my favourite pieces of dialogue, but I will not give away any spoiler alerts.  I will say one thing - keep an eye on the many Christmas ornaments which appear during this movie, because they are all original ornaments which have been made by the hallmark company over the years.",1417910400,2,865,4.548387096774194

The movie centers on a newly widowed woman named Kathy (Kellie Martin) who has lost her husband, Scott. Christmas is coming around the bend Kathy does not feel like celebrating Christmas this year without Scott. Christmas was Scott's favorite holiday. Kathy can get herself to put any Christmas out. Every Christmas Scott would give her an ornament of something they did together that year and another one of something he wants them to go do during the coming year.  Kathy meets a guy named Tim (Cameron Mathison) who owns a Christmas tree lot called Tim Tree.  Kathy and her husband owned a bike shop together. In the beginning of the movie Kathy believes she loves owning the shop without Scott. Kathy loves baking cookies for her friends and her town. Tim tells Kathy she should into the cookie baking business. Tim and Kathy become close.  Watch this movie to see which path does Kathy take. Does she stay at the bike shop or does she go into the cookie baking business.  This is a  can't miss movie!",1416268800,,1083,4.73936170212766

6497342,4,B00LOCLBWO,"Not long ago, FredCritic was bamboozled by an acquaintance of the female persuasion into watching a bunch of Hallmark Channel holiday movies. FredCritic was under the impression that he was going to be watching a Raquel Welch double feature on DVD consisting of One Million Years B.C. and Myra Breckinridge that his lady friend was going to borrow from her brother. When FredCritic got to her place, she informed him that her brother didn't deliver and asked FredCritic if he would be interested in watching a bunch of Hallmark Channel holiday movies instead. To which FredCritic replied, ""Let me get this straight. You wanna know if I wanna swap a couple of Raquel Welch flicks for a bunch of Hallmark Channel holiday movies, do I have this correct...?"" ""Er...uh..yes."" ""And you realize that you're asking me to switch gears in a major way, right?""

As it turned out, several months later the lady friend let it slip that she didn't have a brother, but that didn't bother FredCritic in the least, because he had very much enjoyed the best movie of the lot, The Christmas Ornament. So much so that he has now seen it a number of times.

At any rate, here are some of FredCritic's thoughts in regard to that movie:

In regard to the characters. There's something about Tim (of Tim's Trees) that defies categorization as a typical Hallmark Channel movie ""nice guy."" I mean, the guy doesn't cry once throughout the film. And he gives the impression that he could live the life of a single, unattached guy for as long as need be. There is nothing about him that spells ""desperation."" He seems to be willing, at one point in the film, to go back to his evil ex, Rebecca, just for the sake of having sex with her. Also, at the end of the movie, when Kathy (the Kellie Martin character) informs Tim that she is ""ready,"" he somewhat glibly asks her, ""Ready for what?,"" instead of opening his arms wide and picking Kathy up and twirling her around while wailing, ""Thank you! thank you! thank you for choosing me and taking me back!"" To me, all of this seems to prove that he's not your typical Hallmark Channel nice guy-dream boat who is putty in a woman's hands.

The Connor character (Tim's nephew that helps him run Tim's Trees) appears to take after Tim personality-wise. He doesn't seem over-eager to please, has a sense of independence, and keeps his perspective on things. And he's old beyond his years - but not in an annoying, cloying, arrogant way.

As for Rebecca, Tim's ex, the filmmakers were going straight for the jugular here. She left Tim for an attorney she met at a spinning class (how much more humiliating can you get?), but she is so drop-dead gorgeous with her short skirt and bare legs you can understand why Tim missed her as much as he did. At first Tim was on the fence about taking her back, but then he came to his senses and reminded himself of the personality behind that great face and bod! None of this is made explicitly obvious, but ask any guy that has watched this movie and I'm pretty sure he'd probably agree with my assessment of that situation.

Then there's Jenna, Kathy's best friend. Gently prodding Kathy, attempting to get her moving forward. She spared us all of the homilies about giving life another chance and forgetting the past and all that other stuff that I thought I saw coming but thank God never materialized. Thank you for your restraint, Jenna.

Finally, there is Kathy, the grieving widow. The best thing about this movie, and I focus in on it everytime I see this movie, is the look that they gave her. I mean, I can't get over it. She actually LOOKS LIKE a woman who has been grieving the death of her husband for 11 months while bearing the extra-added pressure of attempting to keep her business from going down the drain. Throughout the entire movie she looks a bit...haggard. She has a stressed out look, with the anxiety face and the unkempt hair. In most movies similar to this one, the grieving widow would look like she had just come back from a lengthy visit to a spa, you know?

In regard to the plot, the entire movie fairly much consisted of Kathy struggling to emerge from her grieving widow state. In other movies similar to this, the grieving widow would emerge from her shell by the end of the first half-hour. And then she would spend the next half-hour playing the field, dating as many guys as possible. Then she would spend the half-hour after that attempting to settle down with her favorite of all the guys she dated. The last half-hour would be spent breaking up and then getting back together with that guy. And all of that adds up to too much damn action. Too much movement. Too much damn change. What Kathy goes through is much more believeable, in my mind. I believe that it would take a great deal of prodding and self-challenge and loads of time for most people to find their way out of Kathy's type of predictament. I was tremendously relieved by the path this movie chose to follow. It felt so much more real.

But at any rate, of the six or seven Hallmark Channel holiday movies that FredCritic has watched thus far, he found The Christmas Ornament to be easily the best of the lot. Four stars out of five.",1415836800,20,5261,4.611111111111111

While it's not the absolute best Christmas movie (I'm still waiting on Snow Bride and Let it Snow to come out on DVD), it's one of the better ones. I've always liked Kellie Martin. And Cameron Mathison, while he's pretty much the same in every movie, is okay. Not my favorite, but he'll do. This movie is clean, it's good and sappy like you want in a feel-good Christmas movie, and it has a happy ending. I could've done with a little less blatant Hallmark keepsake ornament advertising, though. Please. It was so obvious, it was distracting. Other than that, I'd recommend this movie to Christmas movie fans.",1415232000,3,783,4.406896551724138

She meets a man and her life goes for the best. This is a great Christmas romance and if you like love stories you should enjoy this,1414800000,,285,4.017543859649122
6497380,5,B00LOCLBWO,"I originally saw this movie last year just before Christmas.  Both my husband and I thought it was one of the best Hallmark movies we had ever seen (and we have seen a few.)  While I enjoyed Kellie Martin in this movie, I was utterly charmed by Cameron Mathison - an actor I had not seen before.  The chemistry was right and the growth of the relationship between their characters was believable.

Ms. Martin plays Kathy, a woman who has been widowed recently.  She is struggling to keep afloat the bicycle business she and her late husband owned together.  It is almost as if she is afraid that if it fails, she will lose her husband all over again.  She is in a very fragile spot and the Christmas holiday approaching is making it even more difficult for her.  The truth is that she doesn't enjoy the business she is involved in but she does love to bake, especially Christmas cookies.

Mr. Mathison plays Tim, a single man who owns a Christmas tree lot and is really filled with the joy of the holiday.  He meets Kathy and is instantly attracted to her and tries to help her find the Christmas spirit again.  He helps her by pushing her to expand her dream of baking cookies and wants to become a more important part of her life.  The story ensues from that point as Tim is ready for more and Kathy is afraid of moving ahead without her late husband.

Once I saw that the movie was available for sale on Amazon, I purchased it.  We just watched it again and were as captivated this viewing as we were the first time we saw it.  I am sure that it will become part of the movies that we watch every year at Christmas time.",1414627200,35,1623,4.292763157894737

I have been a fan of Kellie Martin since she starred in the television series ""Christy"" way-back-when.  I have a collection of her work, and was pleased to add ""The Christmas Ornament"" to my collection.  The story-line is a familiar one for Christmas movies -- learning to let go of the past and love again after experiencing the pain of losing a loved one. Kellie Martin gives a good performance as the newly-widowed Kathy; and the chemistry between Kathy and Tim (Cameron Mathison's character) is believable.  I also like the theme that doing something you enjoy, whether it's selling Christmas trees or baking cookies, can become a marketable skill.  Wouldn't it be great if everyone could earn a living while doing something they enjoy doing?
