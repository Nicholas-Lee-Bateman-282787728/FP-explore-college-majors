7607886,5,B01ARYG0H0,"I've been a Johnny Winter Fan since 1969 and I must say this is a great Live recording and fine example of Johnny at his best! The Jamming and Musician Interaction with one another is Classic and a Must Have for any Johnny Fan!---Having Dr. John in the Mix is just more Icing on the Cake!--You won't be sorry for buying this, if you love the Blues!",1464048000,8,348,4.208955223880597

7607888,5,B01ARYG0H0,"A must for any Johnny Winter fan. In his prime. Smoken hot blues. Most underrated blues man,guitar player that ever lived. Dr. John nice bonus. Excellent dvd,",1462752000,8,158,4.888888888888889
7607889,4,B01ARYG0H0,"This 58 minute DVD contains eight songs performed by Winter and two backing musicians for a televised concert in Sweden in 1987. He is joined about half way through by Dr. John on piano. Dr. John has lead vocal on his own composition and helps out on piano on others. Winter does a short welcome to the studio audience and then its off to songs by blues greats.

There is a Bonus song Prodigal Sun from 1972 and that one is filmed and the image is not very sharp.

Be aware that the image is in square format  not even 4:3 so you get WIDE black bars on either side of the screen but the image is not distorted. The sound is decent on the central program.

Winter fans will probably want this to see him play with Dr,  John (Mac Rebennack). Dr. John fans may find it a bit to much hard blues for their tastes.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8748104,2,B01ARYG0H0,"Johnny Winter is great and so is Dr. John. But this DVD is TERRIBLE! There is no real video to speak of, just four small windows that keep playing short clips over and over. You have NO CONTROL over the menu at all. You cannot get a menu, you cannot select what song to play. All you can do is hit ""play"" and go along for the ride. And the sound volume fades in and out too. This DVD sucks. The people who produced it should never be allowed to produce another one!",1523145600,,465,4.010752688172043

8748107,4,B01ARYG0H0,"excellent performance by J.Winter and Dr. John is added delight, really great performance up close and personal, just a bit weird as the venue is like half a high school gymnasium? just seems off to me, weird in that way? I had a DVD of Johnny Winter that was totally awesome, still looking to replace that! Not his best DVD, tho its Great! ****",1487548800,3,345,4.40625
