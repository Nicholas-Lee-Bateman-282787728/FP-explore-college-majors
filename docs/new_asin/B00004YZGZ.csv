7927852,5,B00004YZGZ,"This film had many moments which were mirthful and entertaining.  I feel the story was very lighthearted and flowed well.  The waiter, played by comedian Jim Gaffigan, provided a hysterical physical comedy supporting performance.",1453334400,,229,5.705882352941177

7927854,5,B00004YZGZ,"This film is an exemplary romantic comedy, but be ready for something much more than what's typically offered from a major studio rom-com. ""The Personals"" was independently produced (with a very limited budget) in the early 1980s, before the independent film movement even existed. And it's lack of Hollywood influence is one of its major strengths. It's also a wonder to watch as the acting is not only terrific throughout, but the film's stars look like regular people with whom everyone can identify and they act and react in ways that typically avoid the usual kind of movie nonsense. However, perhaps what struck me most is the astonishing lead performance delivered by Bill Schoppert. Not only is his character (also named Bill) believable and very likeable, his performance is not in any way derivative of any other film star, personality, comedian, character, etc. In other words, it's a completely unique (as well as fully realized) ""Bill"" who exists in the film. A truly wonderful viewing experience.",1393372800,,1010,5.090361445783133
7927855,4,B00004YZGZ,"It has been a long time since I saw this movie, so it brought back some wonderful memories. The movie itself is pretty good - very low key, a pleasant unchallenging watch. Sometimes that is just what is needed. Mostly, though, for me the movie is nostalgic. Part of it take place around the lakes in Minneapolis. Even the very first time I saw the movie, it brought back memories of my own ""dating days"" around those lakes.",1366156800,,423,4.435897435897436
7927856,4,B00004YZGZ,"The movie stars Malik Yoba, Rhonda Ross-Kendricks and Stacy Dash.  Malik plays Keith wgi us a struggling journalist with a story idea.  His idea is to take a personal ad out to get 30 dates in 30 days. During the 30 days, he discovers a variety of women.  He dates Stacey Dash (who sees through him and his mind.  His story idea becomes a quest to understand woman and their issues of dating.  He struggles with the idea that she just might be a good woman and one that he wants in his life.

This is a good (black) movie that shows every woman type (good or bad).  A must for your collection.",1194220800,,593,4.1946902654867255
7927857,4,B00004YZGZ,"I had the pleasure of catching this film during a film festival in DC and I then ordered a copy from Amazon.  It was hilarious at times, heartwarming at times, and just downright entertaining.  The main character is a reporter who decides to date several women that he meets through personal ads for a story.  He assumes that he will learn something pertinent about women but ends up finding out even more about himself, his behavior, and his emotional needs.  I would suggest this movie to anyone who wants to discuss the male-female thing with their mate.",1002672000,9,557,4.711340206185567
7927858,4,B00004YZGZ,"This is a film, I feel, that anyone who has ever dated in the 80's, 90's, or 00's can relate to.  Anyone who has gone to the edges of the earth and tried every tactic availabe to find true love can relate to this.  Especially someone who had dated someone from the personal ads or online.  I really enjoy the message of 'sometimes true love can be staring you in the face.'  I recommend this film to anyone single and especially to those who are dating.  You might just see yourself in one or many of the characters.  Excellently written, directed, and edited this film is easy to follow and really keeps your attention and your emotions at their peak!  Malik Yoba and Stacey Dash both give excellent performances and the surprise ending will leave you with chills and possibly a tear of happiness.  This film is a must for anyone's DVD or Video Library.  A work of art that you can't help but watch over and over and over again.  'Personals' is definitely worth every dollar and then some.",979689600,19,990,4.45
7927859,4,B00004YZGZ,"Malik Yoba stars in this sleeper about a commitment-phobic journalist who writes a personals ad and goes on series of interesting dates, then writes about them as a way to keep his journalism career alive.  In the meantime, he gains valuable insight about himself.  The dates are interesting and funny, with Yoba playing off the performances of the widely-varying temperments and personalities of the women he meets.  If you missed this one in the theater, rent or buy it, an additional treat being a performance by Jim Gaffigan of the TV series ""Welcome to New York"" as an everyman waiter who sees Yoba, on his many dates, as a Don Juan to be revered, not knowing the true chaos going on in the man's life.",978652800,3,707,4.64
