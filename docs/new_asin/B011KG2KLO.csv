7333497,4,B011KG2KLO,"Roger Moore was my favorite Bond growing up in the 70s, then I matured and appreciated Sean Connery's original performance in the role, and Daniel Craig is killing it as the current Bond seeming to come right out of the pages of Fleming's books.

But back to Moore.
He's sillier and campier than Craig or Connery.  He's better than Lazenby, Dalton and Brosnan, but only in the early ones.  My favorite of his is either MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN featuring Christopher Lee as the villain or THE SPY WHO LOVED ME which is the most lavish of the series and features the great assassin Jaws.  Truthfully, Carly Simon's theme song makes me cringe when I hear it, but I just fast forward through the credits.

Also included on this set is Moore's first outing as Bond in LIVE AND LET DIE which is equal parts black exploitation film, creepy voodoo film and probably the straightest Moore ever was as Bond-- there are very little quips and silly parts in this one, but it's also a bit less fun because of that.

Still, this is the set to get if you want to see Moore at his Best Bond.",1450137600,3,1074,4.371859296482412
7333498,3,B011KG2KLO,"Roger Moore used to be my favorite James Bond when I was younger, (because he looked more like Ian Fleming than the other Bond men) plus he was the most suave.

7333505,5,B011KG2KLO,"I truly have to agree with other reviews of this James Bond set Roger Moore first three movies as James Bond amazing movies, great plotline, and the opening scene on the movie The Spy Who Loved Me great camera working by the film crew.  The three movies in this set is Live and Let Die, The Man With The Golden Gun, and The Spy Who Loved Me.  Come next week I will have the whole James Bond collection from 1962-2015, out of the seven Bond films I have watch or re watched only didn't care for two of them which is pretty good.  In closing threw out the years there as been some great James Bond actors and at times just decent actors for the role, but if your a true fan of James Bond in general then you'll end up doing what I did and just collect the whole sets from year 1962 to 2015.",1487376000,13,788,4.038461538461538
