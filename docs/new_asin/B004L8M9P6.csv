8433927,4,B004L8M9P6,"This DVD was well-done, beautifully shot and narrated - but I found myself wishing that it had covered far more about Santa Fe than focusing so much on the history of the Catholic church in the area. Yes, I learned a lot, but didn't realize that non-Catholic topics would pretty much be ignored in favor of laser focusing the film on the church. If you're interested in the history of the Catholic church in New Mexico and Santa Fe, then you'll love this DVD - I just wanted more variety. So, my 4 stars isn't about the quality, just reflects my own lack of interest in the topic.",1353974400,3,580,4.37962962962963
