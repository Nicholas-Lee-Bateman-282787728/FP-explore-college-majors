1083316,3,630585548X,"Ooookay. Where to start on this one.............. A supposed hollywood actor is magically transported to a lost world of stop-motion dinosaurs and brainless, busty cavewomen. Admittedly, probably the only place you'll get  an array of scientifically correct dinosaurs other than Jurassic Park, but  nothing to offer beyond that. The girls, despite being 'well endowed', are  rather boring. Give 'Dinosaur Island' a look.",963792000,,420,5.741935483870968
1083317,3,630585548X,"This movie had the potential to be so much more than it was. The stop motion dino effects good but the addition of live lizards (to save money I'm sure) is a bit distracting. The girls in this are all very good looking  and for the ""little parts"" they were given, they did fine. Which  brings me to  one of the problems I had with Dinosaur Valley Girls, the  girls didn't do enough. Their characters were not developed in any way and  the supposed romance between Tony and Hea-thor just happens. There's no  building to it. I realize in movies like this plot is usually not their  strongest point but this movie needed that especially because the cave  people speak in cave talk and we, the viewers, can't always figure out  whats going on. Why do the cavemen dislike the one  member of their tribe?  Why does Hea-thor not mind Tony sleeping with ever other cave girl? You'd  think she'd be extremely jealous. Lastly, why does the big caveman hate  Tony? If he's in love with Hea-thor, he never shows it. Other things in  this movie I could have done without were the stupid sound effects that  were intended as comedy but seemed out of place and the music video for  ""Jurassic Punk"" that comes out of nowhere. Speaking of which, the  resolution to the dinosaur problem is just plain silly. There are some  points to this movie I do like. The story does move along at a good pace.  There were only a couple of slow parts for me. The women are all very good  looking and I did laugh at many of the jokes. I also like the special  features. If you like B movies, I'd say rent this before you buy it. If you  like every B movie ever made, I know you'll love Dinosaur Valley Girls!",963792000,,1677,4.341935483870968

1083385,3,630585548X,"Dinosaur Valley Girls is one hour and thirty-four minutes and was released on video on September 16, 1997. The movie tells the story of actor Tony Markham who star is eroding due to his pack a day smoking. His wife or live in girlfriend (the movie does not say) is whinny and uses Tony to try to advanced her career. Tony is also somewhat miserable with his life. While practicing his martial arts, a vision of a cavewoman flashes before his eyes. He decides to head over to a dinosaur museum after sparring. While at the museum, he is shown an unusual artifact and it transport him back a million plus year in time. There the movie really begins to fall apart. Basically a cave girl named Hea-Thor takes Tony in after he rescues her. Tony meets several other cave girls back at the cave and his new life begins. Tony begins to like this new life and even starts dressing in that time period. One evening cavemen capture the cavewomen and take them back to their cave and do a period cave rape\sex. No matter how you look at it, it is corny either way. Tony and Hea-Thor come to the rescue but the cavewomen have everything under control. In the end Tony decides to stay with Hea-Thor. Dinosaur Valley Girls does not have a really good story nor is the acting really great. The only thing this movie has going for it is sexy topless girls. Dinosaur Valley Girls gets a C-.

1083386,1,630585548X,"I bought this thinking it would be a fun ""B"" Movie but the acting in this movie was so bad it was funny. I don't know why it is getting so many tags making it seam like it's a sexy movie with nudity.  There is one scene, don't blink or you will miss it, dumb story, dumb writing, did I say bad acting......junk......it was over priced at 99 cents",1234569600,,346,4.0144927536231885
1083387,5,630585548X,"This movie is funny as well as borderline erotic. the actresses were all enjoyable to watch as the sexy cavewomen, and the late William Marshall(the original Blacula)was at his best as the scientist/researcher.

1083388,3,630585548X,"Although no classic Dinosaur Valley Girls contains enough silliness to make it a watchable Saturday afternoon time waster. Writer/director Donald Glut makes darn certain that the viewer knows that this is a joke (he all but pummels us over the head with it) and that makes up for the really bad special effects (considering that this was made for a measly ...though I think that it is understandable). The cast is obviously having fun goofing off in front of the camera and it's contagious. The music video intermission (a song called Jurassic Punk, hehehehe) alone is worth the price of admission.",978652800,4,598,4.930693069306931
1083389,5,630585548X,"This is your dino-dream come true!  It's a video about a ""primeval"" fantasy land inhabited by dinosaurs & cavebabes created by Don Glut, an expert on dinosaur film history and the science of dinosaurs.  Karen Black is still ""cave-babe-alicious"". And, for inexplicable reasons, those scenes featuring cavemen passing gas had me and my wife in hysterics.  It's not exactly One Million Years B.C., but then it's perfectly suited for your next planned Halloween dino-monster movie marathon.  Hey, it's a genuine cult film already & the price is right, so pop open those brewskies & enjoy!  Also, viewers will find Don's book, ""Dinosaur Valley Girls - The Book"", about the making of the movie, highly entertaining.",971481600,5,709,5.130434782608695
1083390,2,630585548X,"The thing that stands out for me most in this flick is ""Just a little part"", which all the gals in the movie keep begging Tony Markham for.  Also, William Marshall gives a very good but brief performance as the paleontologist.  I like the music score, especially ""Jurassic Punk"".  I bought the Family Version, so I don't know if there are any truly violent scenes in the movie which may have been excised.  Dickens' animated and animatronic animals are realistic in design if not movement.  In all honesty, I wish I knew what Don Glut and Kevin Glover had been trying to say with this movie.  Is it a satire of Hollywood mores?  It would be neat to see the proposed sequel.",971395200,3,673,4.467213114754099

1083392,1,630585548X,"This movie was a waste of film and money spent on bad actors! There is absolutely nothing about it to recommend. Hardly any naked girls, whats the  point of it being an adult film!  More like rated R. Avoid this film!",966816000,,217,4.2682926829268295

7896347,4,630585548X,"There are three different DVD releases of this film listed on Amazon, and they all have the same reviews?! Also, reading that a 2-disc set has no bonus materials doesn't make too much sense. The two-disc version I bought did have a lot of extras, including some charming test footage of the young ladies. The film as such is okay if you want to spend some fun time with some stone-age cuties!",1482710400,,392,4.458333333333333
7896348,3,630585548X,"""Dinosaur Valley Girls"" is a campy comedy from director Donald Glut with amazing casting like Ed Fury as ""Ur-So"", Bo Roberts as ""Mak-Muff"", and easily my favorite, Karen Black as ""Ro-Kell"" (as in Raquel Welch...oh, my ribs). It also features the genuinely great actor William ""Blacula"" Marshall as Dr. Benjamin Michaels, a dinosaur researcher. The star is washed up actor Tony Markham (Jeff Rector) who is starring in ""Feet of Fury 4"", and who has visions of girls in loincloths. Surprise! Tony is transported back to dinosaur days by a talisman, and when he meets some cavemen he actually says ""Hi guys"".

The dinosaurs are wonderful; I especially like the pterodactyls, though nothing can rival the scene of an Allosaurus unfastening a bra! Enjoy the extensive caveman conversation (a helpful translation guide is furnished with the DVD) and flatulence scenes, and note the creative use of ""Wild Thing"" on the soundtrack, as well as the hilarious song about dinosaurs (think it of it as a promotional music video for dinosaurs). There is an obligatory love story and some very amusing weapons training, but there are also long stretches of tedious tawdriness; I was bored for much of the movie, and that's the worst thing that a filmmaker can do to his audience, especially with a film like this. Tony does some awful (and I mean awful) Hollywood impressions, leading to an exciting conclusion involving using exploding gourds as hand grenades against the Allosaurus, and a time travel plot resolution that will not surprise anyone.

The DVD has lots of extras including a commentary track with director Glut, which is just OK; it's neither informative nor entertaining enough to justify a second viewing of the movie. Also included is a ""Making of 'Dinosaur Valley Girls'"" feature narrated by William Marshall (which is the best part), some screen tests featuring pretty women in bikinis with spears (this is more boring that you'd expect), and deleted scenes, which were also a snoozefest.

This is a giant reptile exploitation film that fans of the genre may enjoy: it does have moments that are intensely enjoyable from a camp perspective, but it also has long swaths that not only are not titillating, they're just boring.",1473465600,,2229,5.018918918918919
7896349,1,630585548X,"I saw this movie on cable when it came out on showtime or something. I got it for THE best worst song ever ""Jurassic Punk"". I only got it because that song got stuck in my head 15-20 years ago. I was expecting dinosaurs and titties. But it barely delivers on that. Most of the movie is watching people fake caveman talk in a cave. The movie is SO boring and slow. This movie was probably shot in a matter of days or a week at best. The acting is beyond amateur. I can't stress how boring this movie is. It looks like a tongue and cheek cave babe movie. But its really a bad porno from the early 90's with all the porn/sex scenes cut out it. All the lines fall flat on the ground. Especially the stupid jokes and quotes that remind you of actual movies. I really wanted to like this movie. But its so devoid of personality and boring I can see why it was forgotten by everyone.",1441670400,,876,4.098837209302325
7896350,3,630585548X,"The movie arrived on time and played fine.  As for the quality of the movie, well it was what I expected.",1416873600,,105,4.0
7896351,4,630585548X,"Denise Ames is quite nice, as is Griffin Drew as they portray characters a million years apart in ""Dinosaur Valley Girls"" and of course, Zaina Juliette Ark'Keenya, Caree, Staci B. Flood, Donna Spangler, and Michelle Stanger are starring in this video presentation also, each contributing according to her gifts.  There are other actors and actresses that play extra parts I suppose.  Filmed in California USA, this video set comes with the ""director's cut"" R-rated version, and the ""family viewing"" PG-rated version, with a special features disc also in the case.  The acting is of course very campy and lame, but any guy over 5 years old will want to watch it start to finish, regardless of which version being shown.  Produced by Frontline Entertainment, directed by Donald F. Glut.  Spoiler alert - it's pretty much just exactly what you think it is.

7896353,4,630585548X,"While it is standard knowledge in the scientific community that humans and Dinosaurs never met face to face, film makers continue to place them in the same time era. In this one, a man travels back in time to meet dinos and naked cave women. He also has to fight off the cave men as well as dinos. It is done rather campy. The dinos are not of Jurassic Park quality, but are authentic enough to watch. Followers of hitech dinosaur recreations might want to pass on this one. Followers of camp movies  and half clad women will want to view this most likely.",1304985600,,556,4.346153846153846
7896354,1,630585548X,"I don't think I've ever seen a more disappointing excuse for a 'T&A' movie than this exercise in stupidity. I like seeing attractive women come out of their clothes as much as the next red-blooded guy, but there are far better DVD's for that than this one. I did not expect much of a story line with a title like this, so at least that wasn't a shock. A modern day actor gets 'magically' transported back to prehistoric days. And oh, what luck. The stone age men and women have had a little tiff and are now living apart, and our 'hero' (cough, cough) ends up in the girls' camp. But none of the cast could act their way out of a wet paper sack if their lives depended on it. The so-called 'dinosaurs' are among the cheapest, most cheesy looking I've ever witnessed in a film. You can see better effects done by amateurs on YouTube. As for the women, most are decently attractive, but for me, it was the dusky-skinned Arkeni (Ta-mee) who stole the show. And what WAS it with the retard names? Deb-bee, Bar-bee, Mee-shell, Ro-kell, enough already. If you catch this one on sale or in your local big box store's bargain bin, it's money that won't be terribly wasted. Otherwise, avoid at full price.",1268784000,,1196,4.4409090909090905
7896355,3,630585548X,"'Dinosaur Valley Girls is pretty obviously a low-budget film.  But that doesn't mean this 1996 comedy, written and directed by comic-book writer, dinosaur
expert, and novelist Don Glut lacks merit.  I've watched it three times in preparing this review and I think it's a hoot.

Action-film star Tony Markham [played by Jeff Rector, who looks and speaks a bit like Charlie Sheen] is haunted by dreams and visions of a beautiful cavewoman in a valley of dinosaurs.  When an ancient artifact transports the actor back in time, he soon learns that Hollywood heroics won't be enough to protect the cavewoman and her tribe from the perils of this time-lost world.  It's a decent
premise with a satisfying conclusion, and that's not something we always get from movies with much bigger budgets.

There are two versions of the movie.  The director's cut has boobies.  Lots of boobies.  They're quite nice, but, on occasion, they slow down the film.  The family version covers up the boobies, but still has sexual elements that probably wouldn't be appropriate for young viewers.

Rector is good in his role, but the outstanding performances come from Karen Black and Ed Fury as an estranged cave-couple whose split also split the tribe into separate male and female tribes. Again, it's an amusing concept and Glut and his actors work it for many laughs along the way.  An anti-smoking running gag gets a bit old, but it leads to a painting-on-the-wall sight gag that had me
laughing out loud.

Most commentary tracks put me to sleep, but Glut's impressed the heck out of me as he described how much bang he, his cast, and his crew got from the minimal bucks that financed this movie.  It's practically a course in low-budget filmmaking.

Glut takes justifiable pride in his film's dinosaurs, as well he should.  Aside from a couple modern lizards made to look huge, and that's more an in-joke homage to the low-budget dinosaur films of the past that anything else, all the dinosaurs in this movie are scientifically accurate.  I thought the lightning-scar allosaurus looked particularly swell.

The second disc features a bevy of special features: a ""making of"" documentary, deleted scenes, actress auditions, music videos, and more.  Special note must be made of some familiar folks who had a hand in this movie:

The uber-talented Pete Von Sholly did some art for the film and co-wrote the annoyingly catchy ""Jurassic Punk"" song and other ""Dinosaur Tracks"" tunes.  Frank Brunner did dinosaur and storyboard art.  Author Bill Warren makes a cameo appearance and ""Uncle Forry"" Ackerman has a walk-on while clutching a copy of Famous Monsters of Filmland.  Even Roy Thomas gets a ""thanks to"" nod as the end
credits roll.

Dinosaur Valley Girls is an entertaining way to spend a couple hours.  It wasn't going to win any Oscars, but all I ask of most movies is a few hours of fun and this movie delivers that. It earns a respectable three out of five Tonys.
