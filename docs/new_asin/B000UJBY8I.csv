8213418,4,B000UJBY8I,"1.  Off the bat, I'm not that much into documentaries, however I've seen more than my share.
2.  This is very good documentary for the following reasons:
  a.  It's not boring; that's saying a lot because a lot of documentaries are just... dryer than dirt.
  b.  It's engaging (and thus not boring) because instead of trying to tackle a complex issue (ex: Nisei internment), the documentary rather focuses on one specific nisei and explores his life / experience.  Furthermore, you have first person interviews not only with the subject of the film, but also with his brothers in arms.
  c.  It's educational without the typical tendency of documentaries to moralize.
3.  All in all, an excellent documentary that will likely be appreciated by folks who normally don't like documentaries.  Well done.",1277856000,6,800,5.00763358778626

This documentary is a marvelous account of Mr. Kuroki's story. You can't watch this program without feeling inspired. Ben Kuroki is truly a great American, and a true patriot.",1200009600,7,332,4.946428571428571
8213421,5,B000UJBY8I,"The documentary about Ben Kuroki tells a great story about an amazing person who perseveres against all odds!  Bill Kubota captured the very heart of the events that took place during that time.  It is a story that needed to be told.  Our family watched this documentary intently and is in awe of Ben Kuroki.  Simply, this is a wonderful documentary and is highly recommended to all.",1190160000,9,383,4.6716417910447765
