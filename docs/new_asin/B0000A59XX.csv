1902534,2,B0000A59XX,The product shipped to me was defective and it is not easy to return per Amazon policies.,1123718400,15,89,4.294117647058823
1902535,5,B0000A59XX,"Get it!  I even got my fiance to do the workout with me and he didn't think he'd like a Richard Simmons workout video.  The good part is that further on down the line, you can switch to heavier weights and it's like a whole new workout.",1123286400,28,236,4.0
1902536,5,B0000A59XX,"I am surprised by how much I like this video.  I tried the Disco Sweat for some cardio, and I didn't like it at all. However, this is another story!  He does a fantastic job of walking you through the use of the weights.  The routine is varied just enough to give you the exercise, then the relief, when you need it.  You use two different sets of weights, and then it finishes up with floor exercises, working the abs.  The pacing and instruction and workout are excellent.  I look forward to working out with this video every other day, and am happy to say that it's working really well!  Would highly recommend this...even to people who are amused by Richard's ""quirkiness.""  He's only minimally quirky in this video, and I am appreciative of the job he has done with this one!  This would be a good gift item for friends, I think.",1116115200,39,834,4.398692810457517
1902537,5,B0000A59XX,"I bought this DVD even though I already had Sweat and Tone and thought it might be more of the same - but it's not.  You use two sets of weights in this routine - a lighter set for endurance and a heavier one for strength, then there's an Ab floor routine and cool down.

I started out liking the routine, but the more I do it, the better I like it.  This is one of his more recent tapes and features a more muscular Richard.  As usual, he has an assortment of shapes, sizes and ages of people doing the routine with him and they all look so happy and seem to be having a lot of fun - and you find you do too.

The music is great and between the motivational things Richard says and the words in the songs, you really feel good when you get done.  I've seen some definite improvement in tone and attribute it all to this tape and Sweat and Tone that uses toning bands.

Richard Simmon's queuing on this tape is very good.  I enjoy doing this tape and that says a lot from someone who doesn't enjoy exercising!!",1105142400,157,1010,4.065656565656566

1902692,5,B0000A59XX,"Blast and tone is, overall a great workout video. It's extremely low-impact, goes nice and slow, reminds you of proper posture, and doesn't pressure you to keep up if you are struggling. The video is all about going at your own pace. I am recovering from a back injury and this was PERFECT to get me back into the workout schedule. You have to be okay with a certain level of silliness though. For the most part silliness isn't a big issue, but there are two parts that I just didn't like. One is the Simmons out right SCREAMS in more than one section of the video, not screaming instruction, just outright screaming. This is less of an issue if you keep the volume down. Another is the cool-down at the end of the video. It's really campy and I personally felt ridiculous doing it. Again though, this is easily remedied, don't do the cool-down on the video; just do some basic stretching. Overall don't let the few negative things I said about this dvd affect your opinion too much. If your doing this in the privacy of your own house it really doesn't matter, and it's a great introduction to strength training. The dvd isn't overwhelming and it's highly unlikely you will feel discouraged by this video, it's meant for beginners and it's meant to hold your hand while you get use to how strength training feels.",1392681600,,1314,4.525210084033613

1902778,5,B0000A59XX,"I've had shoulder and knee surgeries, so I have to be careful in using weights. I like that this DVD doesn't overdo it and suggests using lighter weights than most. There aren't too many reps - just enough. If you feel the workout is getting too easy, increase your weight. I love the floor workout. Just what I needed. I alternate this DVD with a couple of Richard's Disco workouts and my treadmill. 40+ pounds gone so far and I feel SO much better!",1374278400,3,450,4.369047619047619
1902779,4,B0000A59XX,"I am an Intermediate Exerciser who likes to have a nice selection of Beginner DVD's for for my early morning easy breezy workouts. I workout two to three times per day and I prefer my early morning workout to be just a little something to burn a few calories and get my metabolism going. So this morning I got up and walked my dog as usual in my neighborhood and after we got back I did this video...MON/WEDS/FRI are my Resistance Training Days. This video was easy to follow, the time FLEW by, it felt more like 15 minutes instead of 30, and Richard is very cheerful so there was no dread factor. I wore my heart rate monitor and it told me that I burned 131 calories. So, that coupled with my walk allowed me to burn a total of 240 calories. Later in my day I will burn another 500-600 calories or so by doing some vigorous cardio and in the evening doing a much more intense Resistance DVD, maybe a Kelly Coffey DVD. Overall this is a good video for someone who is a Beginner and wants to start strengthening their bones, do some toning and burn calories more efficiently. The ab section actually burned my abs a bit and may be a little tough for a beginner BUT if you stick to it and just do what you can, resting when you need to, you will build up to being able to do it all. I didn't break a sweat, only a bit of moisture on my face but again I am a strong Intermediate Exerciser. I have about 200 fitness DVD's and this one will go on the Beginner Shelf for morning workouts...I enjoyed it a lot!",1372636800,2,1504,4.154109589041096
1902800,5,B0000A59XX,The weight workouts are great. I'm a little older and has lost a lot of weight. The workouts with the weights and abs is just my speed with wonderful results. Most of all fun!!!!!,1370131200,3,179,4.294117647058823

1902803,5,B0000A59XX,"Richard Simmons makes it easier to get it done.  He starts off with some easy stretching movements, goes into several minutes of working with two sizes of weights to build muscle, and ends up with floor work on your core.  A little bit of everything.  And he's so positive.  It's the ONLY exercise program I've ever been able to stay with.  It has a little bit of everything so you don't get bored doing one thing over and over and I feel so good when I get finished.  A real find.",1368230400,2,481,4.230769230769231
1902804,5,B0000A59XX,"I really like Richard Simmons. His work out takes about 25 minutes. There are neat smiley people to lift and exercise with; and it is more fun to complete the program with company. You just need weights to participate. A gym and classes are the best; but if you're at home in the winter, this is a fun motivating group session.",1365897600,,327,4.377049180327869
1902805,5,B0000A59XX,"I really like how this workout uses hand weights to help tone muscles! As usual, Richard uses great music and encouragment to make the workout fun and fly by! It does include about a five minute floor section, which would be better if it was broken up into a separate chapter, so it could be quickly skipped on those days when I just want to do the weight sections and then jump to the cool-down! Overall a great video which adds variety to some of the other workouts!",1363478400,,468,4.329545454545454
1902806,5,B0000A59XX,"RICHARD SIMMONS NEVER LETS US DOWN.  WHAT MAKES RICARD'S VIDEO FUN IS THE PERSONAL TOUCH.

1902807,5,B0000A59XX,"This is a fantastic toning workout especially if you are just starting out. It can even be tailored to those who are stronger just by increasing the weights used. There is no limit to how much weight you could use if you progress slowly. The first time I did this I hadn't done anything for a while and I hurt the next day, especially my abs. It got easier the next time but still challenging enough for me to feel I was working out. I highly recommend this DVD.",1358208000,2,462,4.202247191011236
1902808,3,B0000A59XX,This video was OK.  It was kind of boring (believe it or not) - there are some exercises where you are on the floor.  I can't do that so I cut out the stomach part.  I only did it twice and then put it on the shelf.,1355875200,,215,3.5319148936170213

I started smaller and in a week I had to buy new dumb bells.  If you want a simple yet effective video, this might be the one.  Richard is as always, Richard.  If you can put up with his impossible positivity, you have it made!",1353456000,,385,4.0
1902830,3,B0000A59XX,"Obviously strength training and floor work are important parts of any workout. I was hoping to get a great Richard Simmons type workout, while focusing on these all important areas. The workout, however, is ok. I find that it is not very long, so I barely break a sweat. Also, I don't particularly like the music. I was hoping to find something more along the lines of his other exercise videos where the music is fun to sing and dance to. It doesn't even have the fun and excitement of the other videos because there are not so many people working out along with him. However, because I don't have a lot time to spend working out, Richard's video works well. You can pop it in early in the morning before you start your day. But if you are serious about strength training and floor work, I would find something else. This is not Richard's strong point.",1352851200,,853,4.439490445859873
1902831,4,B0000A59XX,"Loved it!  Beginners and seniors (50+ crowd) like me can go at a slower pace and still get a great workout.

The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that there is only one 30 minute routine so I felt a little cheated given what I paid; would like to have seen two workouts on the video.  Nonetheless, it's a fun, challenging workout for beginners and intermediates.

This is a great video for me since I'm just starting my weightlifting routine.  The people in the video are all shapes and sizes and seem to be having fun.  Richard is always fun and motivational, I love everything about him.  I do this video every morning, very early before the family gets up, and it gets me ready for the day with an upbeat, ""ready to take on the world"" attitude.

When I got this dvd and tried it, it was short and fun but the ab work was tough and the 30 minute workout made me sweat. You can add more weight as you go to keep it challenging and its short enough to use as an add on to your daily workout. I really love this type of routine Richard is energetic and the people he uses are every day people and it makes you feel like if they can do it I surely can.

His words are more inspirational than amusing.  I sent this DVD to my friend who needs to start getting in shape and who finds the starting part to be quite daunting.  The DVD is much too easy for someone who has been exercising for many years; yet, absolutely perfect for someone who needs the motivation to start and continue.",1258243200,28,531,4.75

1902839,5,B0000A59XX,"I really like this workout.  I recommend that you have some 3# and 5# weights to begin, then get heavier ones as you progress.  For a beginner in strength training (as a result of some heart issues), I found this to be a great start coupled with some other sort of aerobic type exercise every other day to get your heart rate going.  This workout includes some ab work toward the end, which I also like.  When I master this one, I'll move on to one that is more difficult",1238630400,4,471,4.2
1902871,5,B0000A59XX,"I bought this tape after reading the book ""Younger Next Year for Women: Live Strong, Fit, and Sexy--Until You're 80 and Beyond"". The authors of the book insist that everyone needs to add weights to their workout routine. This is the perfect routine for beginners. Richard does a great job of showing you what to do and giving enough time for you to get set before he begins. The first part of the tape is stretching, then you move to the light weights where you need from 1 to 5 pounds weights, then it moves to the heavy weights which are from 3 to 8 pounds, then you end with a floor mat activity. The entire routine only lasts 30 min which is great when you don't have a lot of time. I usually do another workout tape after completing this one, my favorite is sweating to the oldies 2 but I vary it with any of the sweating to the oldies. I like 2 the best because it has one song with weights and a floor routine at the end. When I purchased the blast and tone, I didn't know that I needed two types of weights and a yoga mat but as soon as I had completed one viewing, I was back on Amazon to order them. I started with 2 and 3 pounds and after a couple of weeks have moved to 3 and 5 pounds weights. I use the 2 pound weights with sweating 2 now so they don't go to waste ( which is probably why I like the sweating 2 tape the best of the series). I decided to start exercising when I turned 45 and though I have only lost a couple of pounds ( because I am not on a diet), I do feel so much better. I would recommend this tape to anyone who is just getting started or who is bored with other tapes. I find myself watching Janet Preston as much as Richard ( she is the older woman to his left on the tape who looks like she is having so much fun-----at the end of the tape you find that she lost 145 pounds-------wow)",1236470400,7,1822,3.9673024523160763

Good 'ol richard simmons does it again!!! he may be quirky but he knows what he's doing!,1231718400,3,246,4.040816326530612
1902876,5,B0000A59XX,"I only wish I had heard of these videos sooner !!!!  I love this product and all the Richard Simmons' exercise videos that I have purchased so far(Disco Sweat and Sweating to the Oldies -- entire set), they all make exercise the most fun I've ever had when exercising -  thus, I will and have been sticking to it for once !!!  Now that I've learned some of the moves he uses - from time to time I put in my own favorite music and do it myself, incorporating some of the moves on the videos and also think up some of my own!  But the Simmons' videos include everything -- warm up, stretching and cool down..... all to the right pace of music.  Linda",1231286400,3,648,4.152

1902878,5,B0000A59XX,"This is a great toning workout, I alternate this with Sweatin To The Oldies which is an hour long, but you're having so much fun that you don't realize how long the workout is.  I also ordered Richards Blast Off and can't wait to get it.  It's only 20 minutes long, and will fit into my workout schedule better since I workout before work.  You can't go wrong with any of Richard's workout videos..(old or new) the inspiring music reaches out to you..which is so awesome.  You're having so much fun, that you forget that you are working out. Don't waste any more time, start your Richard Simmons library and get into shape the fun way.",1226361600,4,635,4.448275862068965
1902879,5,B0000A59XX,"You'll probably get bored if you do it 5 days a week.  But it's typical Richard - he makes the workout fun and the time fly.  The weight segments are effective - I noticed a different in my suit jackets within the first couple of months.  If you're really out of shape - like I was - it's a great routine to start with.  Not hard on joints, quick and fun.",1223942400,,355,3.9577464788732395
1902880,4,B0000A59XX,My husband and I work out to this at least 3 times a week.  I used to work out with Richard Simmons when he was on t.v.  He is motivation and fun.

We also walk on the days we don't work out.,1206057600,4,323,3.3698630136986303
