Yes, most of the time the dead dog was portrayed by a fake. But the scenes of the dog twitching as it was dying? That was a real dog having real neurological problems. And no matter how generous I am, I cannot conceive of a 1952 French Humane Society representative standing there as a licensed veterinarian gave the dog a dose of something harmless and reversible that would produce that behavior. Not when doing something far more gruesome would produce the same results far more cheaply.
And oddly- in the scene when she retrieved the dog from the bushes to go bury it, that was either an unconscious dog or a dead dog, not a replica. No way.
I call animal abuse.
I would love to be proven wrong as it haunts me.

And yes, I understand worrying about one injured then dead dog while speaking of the horrors of war exposes me an an animal nut.

As of now, there are thirty-seven films on my spreadsheet with five stars.

Which, depending on how many movies you watch, may not seem like an unreasonable number. But to give you a sense of scale, <em>Jeux Interdits</em> (released in English-speaking countries as <em>Forbidden Games</em>) is the 3,175th entry on that spreadsheet, and that's only movies I (a) remember seeing and (b) remember well enough to confidently be able to rate. (For example, I know I saw <em>A Fish Called Wanda</em> on the big screen when it came out, but other than that it stars Jamie Lee Curtis, I couldn't tell you a bloody thing about it right now.) So I've seen at least a handful, in the sense of ""a few hundred, probably"", more than that. And the number of five-star movies on that list is closer to one percent than to two.

When I thought about it, I realized that there are two kinds of movies to which I've given five stars over the years. There are the films that are, simply, perfect: the acting and directing are impeccable, the soundtrack complements the action precisely, the cinematography is grand without being grandiose, etc., etc. The three movies at the very top of my thousand-best list--<em>Before Night Falls</em>, <em>Hotaru no Haka</em>, and <em>Closetland</em>--all qualify in this regard, as do such other five-star stalwarts as <em>Casablanca</em> and <em>Eli, Eli Lema Sabachthani?</em> and Gilliam's <em>The Fisher King</em>.

And then there is the other, far smaller, group of pictures that got five stars in spite of their flaws, movies so overwhelming or so unexpected or so groundbreaking or so... that I couldn't help but sit there with my jaw hanging open wondering how one person, or one small group of people, was able to come up with something like this. <em>Night of the Living Dead</em> qualifies. <em>XTRO</em>. <em>Lord of Illusions</em>. (Yes, I hear the squawking now. Remember what Ebert said about best-of lists.) And now, <em>Jeux Interdits</em>.

Is it a perfect film? Far from it. Neither Georges Poujouly(<em>Diabolique</em>) nor Brigitte Fossey (<em>The Honey Flowers</em>) is an especially good actor at this very early point in each's career, and they're the main characters. There are times Fossey, especially, is painful to watch. (IMDB notes that while Poujouly went on to almost instant success, Fossey's career over the next decade or so was spotty at best, and she didn't really become a star until the seventies.) And yet, well, what the hell?

Like <em>L'arme des Ombres</em> (elsewhere this ish), this is a French war film that is not a French war film. Instead, it is a gentle comedy, though oddly I have never seen anyone else call it a comedy. I was expecting something dark and thick and unbearably heavy, like a Georges Franju short on rye topped with blackstrap molasses. But it became obvious to me pretty early on that Ren Clment spent his days hanging out with Jean Renoir drinking themselves silly, eating small chocolates, and smoking Gauloises, or whatever it is French artists did after World War II (and the unfortunate, albeit temporary, banning of absinthe); there is very much a Renoir feel to this movie, though Clment has a much lighter touch with the comedy than Renoir does in <em>La Rgle de Jeu</em>, which is what this film put me in mind of time and again as it went on. Not because of any sort of similarity in subject matter or the like, but because Clment and Robert Juillard, who seemed to specialize in war films at the time (his previous job was lensing Rossellini's <em>Germania Anno Zero</em>), captured that same atmosphere--bucolic yet absurd, with a dozen little plots running around trying to upstage one another like the party guests at Renoir's mansion, and my god, but Clment gets us to laugh at the saddest moments. What the hell was he thinking? I have no idea, but whatever it was, it worked, and it worked gloriously.

The main plot--at least, Netflix informed me this was the main plot out of the batch--is pretty darned simple; Paulette (Fossey), a six-year-old girl, is in the process of fleeing German planes with her parents and dog. The parents are killed, and the dog soon after; Paulette wanders the landscape, clutching her lost pet, until she meets up with Michel Dolle (Poujouly), who takes her home to the family. The two bury her dog, and Paulette becomes fascinated with the trappings of death: the rituals of burial, the trappings of the graveyard, etc. Soon the two of them have turned an abandoned, bombed-out mill into a full-scale pet cemetery.

This is far from everything that's going on here. There's a Romeo-and-Juliet subplot with Michel's sister and the son of a rival family from town who may not be the war hero everyone assumes he is. There's Michel's (much) older brother, convalescing after being kicked by a war horse in the early part of the film. There is Paulette, who has presumably been raised atheist, coming to terms with the religion that the rural folk deeply hold. (I don't think I'm reaching there; it seemed to me Clment was definitely drawing a parallel of cosmopolitan atheism and peasant religion, though he never really indicates which he sees a a ""better"" option, a fence-straddling which is in itself worthy of great praise.)And there is more, but I've already droned on too long. I cannot recommend this film highly enough, if you've not already seen it. It is beautiful and funny and gentle and sad and thought-provoking. It is a masterpiece of filmmaking like we rarely see, and as far as I'm concerned, it's one of the greatest films ever made. *****",1333065600,,5644,4.933684210526316

640007,5,6303413161,"Over the past several weeks I've been listening every day to a Pandora station created for twentieth century classical guitar music.  If you don't know Pandora, it doesn't matter.  All that matters is that I kept hearing Tarrega's ""Recuerdos de la Alhambra"" over and over.  It made me terribly upset, and I could not understand why.  I wanted to, and did, hear it again and again, but the reason I needed to do so escaped me.  And then I realized that long, long ago it had been in a movie, on a soundtrack.  What movie I could not recall.  It bothered me.  I kept trying and trying to remember which movie.  And at last it came back to me, in bits and pieces, first one connection then another until finally, at last, from very far away, I realized it had come from an old French movie that I had seen long ago.  I couldn't remember the name.  I went through Wikipedia and various movie websites, trying different titles, directors' names and years of release.

And, of course, finally, I found that it had been ""Jeux interdits"" (Forbidden Games) by Rene Clement, with its soundtrack played on the guitar by Narciso Yepes.  I had seen this movie four times in 1965, first on a date and then three times by myself.  It had almost literally blown me away all those many years ago.  It was so powerful and so overwhelming that I had blanked it out, repressed it for almost fifty years, and had I not by chance run into the Tarrega piece played over and over and over I would have finished this life without ever remembering it.  And now I can see it again, and share it with my wife (a Frenchwoman) and our friends, as I most certainly will.

Is there any more recent film with anything even approaching the power and artistry of this poor old black-and-white, narrow screen, monophonic movie?  I don't know of one.  Yet there isn't anything about it that feels in any way dated when you watch it.  Believe me, within minutes of the beginning one entirely forgets that it's in black-and-white, that the old cars and old clothes now seem funny or strange, even that it's in a foreign language.  If you see one film this year, only one, this film very much ought to be that special one.  The Criterion version is of excellent quality.  There are no technical faults whatsoever, let alone faults that can distract the viewer.  This is a keeper.  Something you'll feel better to possess, to have as your own.

640083,5,6303413161,"Given the task of rating the 25 best movies of all time,  I would include Rene Clements  ""Forbidden Games"" along with ""The Seventh Seal"" and 'La Strada"".  I was knocked off my feet by the movie.

1940 France...the Parisians are fleeing the Nazi bombardment and the parents of a sensitive girl are both killed by the Nazi planes. Her dog is another victim. Wandering aimlessly, she is befriended by a country family and particularly by a slightly older boy who forges a ""love"" if not a real attachment to this little girl.

To give meaning to her loss, to mourn, to comfort her dead pet, to avoid confronting the enormity of the events, the girl buries her dog and then buries other animals next to the the dead animal...stealing bits and pieces of gravestones or crosses from a cemetery. Her accomplice is the young farm boy.  Eventually, they are discovered and separated.

What are the ""Forbidden Games"".  Of course, stealing from other graves is a forbidden game...but the war and intolerance and narrow mindedness of the adults is the ""other forbidden game""  After all the second ""game"" created the first.

Yes, this is an anti-war film...but it is far more than that. It's a piercing psychological examination of the effect of war and parental loss on a young child. I thought the film was exceptional in every way - the acting, the molding of music to events, the photography, the truth of the picture.  It is the equal of Hitchcock, the equal of Kurosawa, the equal of Kubrick's best pictures.  No film addict - particularly someone who values foreign films - can complete his or her collection without this masterpiece of cinema.

Brigitte Fossey - the young girl - gives one of the best child performances in film, as does the older boy, George Poujuly. The director (and his wife) who helped to shape the film are to be commended for their ability to get such exceptional performances from ones so young.  In France, Brigitte Fossey was awarded ""best actress"" - an achievement unmatched by any other five year old - Oscars or otherwise.

640084,5,6303413161,"The Bottom Line:

A wonderful, simple story of two children during wartime who become friends and attempt to understand war and death, Forbidden Games is an accessible and involving story that culls good performances from its young leads and ends on an appropriately downbeat note: it's quite a film.",1238803200,,300,5.122448979591836
640085,4,6303413161,"Forbidden Games is a sad tale of war. A little girl (Brigitte Fossey) witnesses her family killed while fleeing the bombs of WWII. Even her dog is killed, but she carries him with her as she wanders away. She stumbles upon a rural family with a young boy named Michel (Georges Poujouly). The Dolle's take her in, and Michel becomes her closest friend. Paulette has an obsession with death, and when she buries her dog, she insists that other animals accompany him near his grave so that he will not be lonely. Michel does his best to oblige her but cannot easily find crosses to decorate the graves. Paulette becomes his eyes and requests every pretty cross that she sees.

A moving film with two wonderful child actors, Forbidden Games is depressing but very well done. It is a strong arguement against war and a plea for war orphans everywhere. Director Ren&eacute; Cl&eacute;ment utilizes an untraditional way of opening and closing his film. Although the story follows a logical progression, it opens abruptly and ends without the story being concluded. In this way, we are presented with a slice of life and are able to relate better to the story and to the characters.

In spite of the grim subject, there are a few moments of humor, even in spite of the seriousness of the actions. Laughter in times of crisis is often therapeutic, and Cl&eacute;ment gives us a few of those moments.",1218758400,,1390,4.716049382716049
640086,5,6303413161,"When I was a kid in the sixties this movie appeared on TV; I was not allowed to watch it, I guess because of my parents' then traditional catholicism; I just saw at that time a glimpse of the two children with the crosses.  Those images, the soundtrack which my much older sister listened to almost constantly, and the name of the movie have haunted me ever since, forty years ago.
I recently bought the DVD and I was not disappointed. The movie is so lyrical, the children's acting so heartfelt, the inevitability of loss so heartbreaking.  All the rituals we invent to alleviate loss, the images seem to suggest, are an illusion at best.  The somber cast of  WWII in Europe is just a scratch beneath the buccolic setting, reminding me that that senseless evil is still as close to all of us as it ever has been.",1207526400,,813,4.436241610738255

640088,5,6303413161,"""Forbidden Games"" was never a film I wanted to see. I didn't know anything about it, but I saw it on video store shelves a couple times. This movie is a perfect example of why a person shouldn't judge a ""book"" by its cover. The cover is, usually, the first thing someone notices about a film and the cover of ""Forbidden Games"" doesn't scream ""see me!"" Too bad, because it is (as you probably already know) a masterpiece. Opening in France, in 1940, during the German blitzkrieg of Paris;

We watch as hundreds of people flee for the countryside. Then we see a young girl named Paulette, whose parents are hurrying her along. She's too preoccupied with getting her dog Jock. As planes fly overhead, Paulette chases after the dog, which leads to the death of both her parents and her dog. After the corpse of the dog is thrown into a river, Paulette retrieves it and wanders into the countryside home of the Dolle family. There she meets a child a few years older than her named Michel, whose family has enough problems that they are hesitant to bring in a child. After all, Michel's brother Georges was just kicked by a horse and lies in bed dying. But the father of the Dolle family allows Paulette to stay. The title ""Forbidden Games"" refers to what begins to happen midway through the film between Michel and Paulette. After burying her dog, Paulette becomes obsessed with burying other animals around him. She enlists Michel's help in doing so, as well as retrieving crosses for the burial sites no matter how he gets them. Death is the theme of the film and it is a theme that is hammered into the ground. Anyone who watches this film should realize that it's a great film, but that doesn't always mean you'll enjoy it. After all, a lot of great films aren't necessarily entertaining. This film, however, is entertaining. If Jean Renoir's ""Grand Illusion"" was the most important film about World War I, than ""Forbidden Games"" is easily the most important about World War II. It's a wonderful, beautifully photographed, and superbly acted film that is largely unseen today. I urge you, if you're reading this and have not seen the film, to go see it.

GRADE: A",1173830400,,2163,4.615584415584416
640089,5,6303413161,"How? By inviting the viewer to interpret the weird things going on, and thus reveal his own heart and mind (the dark side of them). The story, mind you, stands on its own feet if you don't interpret it and only bear witness to the superficial facts, which are innocent enough, tender for sure, and sad as any other story of war time can be. And that's it... at first sight. But evidently the director has made every little detail fit an ambivalent agenda. He hints at more; what more? That's the trick.

On the surface, if you disregard everything said above, the film is still beautiful and haunting. The charming little kids play their ""secret"" games. Games that would be macabre if they themselves were not so young and innocent to realize it. (Is the boy really that young and innocent?) One thing that makes me think, after watching the interview to the director in the extras, was that he intended to have as the little girl star an older gilr, more 9 or 11 than 5 years old as she was. Well, that would have made a lot of difference. The ambivalence wouldn't have been so; I mean, what is underlying now would actually be the meaning of the story.

In any case, the little kids do their parts wonderfully as I haven't seen in any movie with kids until now. The cinematography is gorgeous, the guitar (splendid 'Gardens of Aranjuez by Rodrigo) music is enchanting and the overall mixture of tragicomedy and macabre allegory is really haunting. I did not like the ending very much, though, but I can't come up with a good way to end the story but abruptly, since it has such an oneiric quality about it.

Another important thing is that if you focus too much on the two little leading stars you are going to miss a lot of other imprtant things going on. Every character (& groups of characters) is worth attention and study. A great film.",1173139200,,1843,4.479166666666667
640090,5,6303413161,"A small French girl orphaned by attacking Nazi planes is taken in by a farm family where she and the boy she bonds with establish a hidden animal cemetary.

No need to detail the plot since others have already done so. Just a few comments on points generally uncommented on by others.

Yes, the movie's main point concerns the invisible scars war leaves on the young. Little Paulette and youthful Michel will likely never recover from their psychic wounds, while the shot of little Paulette wandering helplessly among the chaotic tide of refugees is one of the most quietly searing in film annals. The harm already done her by the Nazis is in fact compounded by the unfeeling way she is disposed of by both the farm family and the orphanage. The film's brilliance lies in making us feel what she feels in a wholly unsentimental way.

That, I think, is the basis of the film's near universal appeal. However, there is a second less universal theme overlooked by most. In fact, as many French critics complained at the time, the two farm families really are depicted in unflattering fashion. Some called the portrayal of the Dolle's and Brouard's an unfair and vicious slur on French peasantry. Unfair or not, daddy Dolle comes across as a small-minded tyrant whose chief means of communication with son Michel amounts to a blow to the head, while the final beating in the barn is truly brutal. Then too, he flat out lies to Michel by sending Paulette away, seemingly indifferent to the boy's emotional trauma. And when the easily overlooked younger daughter tries to bring something ""beautiful"" into her life by reading in a dim light, he sends her to bed with the admonition that ""light is not for reading"". Also, the older surviving brother has dodged military service by faking an illness, while the Brouard son has deserted the army claiming a lack of leadership. As someone in the film wryly observes: with material like this, no wonder we lost the war. And no wonder some Francophiles complained loudly. There are many other unflattering instances as well, and somehow I get the feeling that this aspect of the script results from an entrenched hostility between city sophisticates and countryside traditionalists. Anyway, it's a testament to the mysteries of human personality that such a profoudly intuitive boy as Michel could emerge from such unpromising family fodder.

The other neglected point surrounds the film's often understated humor. Much of it passes quickly and so is easily overlooked. But it's there, particularly with the Brouard boy, and his lusty relationship with the older Dolle girl. He's a faintly comical character to begin with. Our first view of him is of a deserter returning home in baggy uniform, announcing his arrival by standing outside the Brouard hovel and blowing sour notes on a stolen trumpet-- a parody, I guess,  of `The Hero's Return'. The graveyard scene between the feuding families also has a faintly comical undertone. It's not the kind of brawl to take seriously, and when daddy Dolle refuses to reciprocate by helping daddy Brouard out of the coffin hole, a rather humorous point is made about Dolle's selfish character. Anyway, look fast, because there are unexpected deposits of humor in an otherwise very somber story.

By and large, anti-war films are not known for their understatement, often relying on one form or another of visual or verbal shouting. `Games', however remains a masterpiece of unadorned understatement. Except for the rather stagey graveyard scene, it's told in simple and straightforward fashion, allowing audience emotions  to build quietly until the final shattering scene. All in all, it's very effective. Of course, everyone wonders what is to become of little Paulette. But the same question could be asked of the disillusioned Michel. For it's clear in his final scene that while throwing away the graveyard crosses, he's casting aside more than mere pieces of wood.",1166659200,,3949,4.992401215805471
640153,5,6303413161,"Hollywood film critic, Leonard Maltin, nails it with this movie. The child stars of ""Forbidden Games"" (Juex Interdits) absolutely blew me away! The acting was so superb! The movie was SUPERB! Although a war drama, I think that it was a great comedy film, too. The two child actors provided the best lines--and the scene where Paulette (played by Brigette Fossey) buried and blessed her deceased dog was one of the most outrageous and funniest things I had ever seen. The ending, however, was tragic and very sad. I almost cried.

As for the music, I loved listening to Narciso Yepes's version of the enchanting Spanish folk melody, ""Romance d'Amour."" It was a delight to hear throughout the entire film. (By the way, just a correction: Yepes didn't play with a lute; it was a classical guitar!). And though I really enjoyed Yepes's playing, I still prefer Christopher Parkening's rendition of this beautiful tune. His musical interpretation of the piece is exquisite!

The DVD bonus features were a wonderful surprise--especially the archival interviews with Rene Clement and Brigitte Fossey, in addition to the alternate opening and ending scenes of the film. I especially love the comment Clement made during his 1963 interview. When asked if he liked actors, he said simply, ""Yes, when they're not actors. Those are the great actors.""

""Forbidden Games"" will definitely be considered as Christmas gifts for both family and friends. I highly recommend watching it. Ultimately, this is one cinema classic you don't want to miss!",1165276800,,1529,5.083665338645418
640154,5,6303413161,"Recently, when discussing our mutual love of art house films, a friend's wife asked me if I had seen Forbidden Games. When I said I had not, she gave it a fervent recommendation. So I looked it up here on amazon and ordered it from an amazon partner.
It arrived quickly and I viewed it twice the day I received it. I found it to be an intensely interesting film as a charming tale of childhood innocence in the face of unfathomable loss. I won't rehash the story line, most who are reading this already know the basic plot. But the film for me left a lot of unanswered questions.
While Brigette Fossey is undeniably excellent in her role as the orphaned Paulette, the manner of her parents' death and the matter-of-fact way in which she accepted their deaths without any outward show of emotion seems odd. Paulette seems almost less willing to accept that her dog is dead than that her parents are! She also seems to just fit in almost seamlessly with the family that has taken her in after she is found wandering by young Michel Dolle as he trying to recapture a cow that has gotten loose. Of course, it helps that Michel is there for her in her time of greatest need. And I don't see why in the chaos of war that Paulette was ultimately sent to an orphanage rather than being allowed to stay with the family that had taken her in. Of course, if those questions were answered, there would be no film.
Both child stars, Brigette Fossey and Georges Poujouly are superb in their respective roles as Paulette and Michel, and director Rene Clement managed to wring equally superb performances from the remainder of the major players. The haunting score by Narciso Yepes imbues the film with the aura of happy sadness that makes the movie so satisfying . Also appealing are the glimpses of French farm life in the bucolic countryside and the comical relationship the Dolles have with their neighbors.
I recommend this edition of Forbidden Games to all who wish to own one. Why? Because the Criterion Collection edition provides the extras that give value for money. Interviews with director Clement and with actress Fossey provide useful insight and the historical backdrop for the making of the film. Clement often comes across as a pompous popinjay, but Fossey is thoroughly charming and forthcoming in her commentary. There are also alternative beginnings and endings which while interesting, were thankfully dropped for the ones that made the final cut. A couple of other extras add just a bit more value as well.",1165276800,,2512,4.6855203619909505
640155,5,6303413161,"Of the small handful of world cinema's certified gems, Ren Clment's FORBIDDEN GAMES (Criterion) is the perhaps the outstanding masterpiece on the loss of innocence.

Simple in its premise and brilliant in its execution, the somewhat inaccurately titled story is set in World War II France.

In order to survive the madness around them, a newly orphaned five year old girl and a slightly older local farm boy are forced to reinvent their world of sudden death with pseudo religious coping rituals.  Unfortunately, their actions put them in dangerous conflict with the adult authorities.

Amazing naturalistic performances from the two child stars helped secure a much deserved 1952 Oscar for Best Foreign Film.

Forbidden Games informs our most basic experience of what it means to be alive -- and to die.

640156,5,6303413161,"In ""Forbidden Games"" a capricious little girl named Paulette gets her parents killed, then meets Michel Dolle, a boy not much older than herself who's willing to satisfy her every wish.  Dolles welcome Paulette into their family, while she and Michel forge a strange bond.  Paulette is fascinated by death and the act of burying, so Michel - who treats Paulette as a kind of pampered pet -- devotes all his time to creating a private cemetery just for her.  When the children's grotesque game goes too far, the adult world threatens to separate them.  ""Forbidden Games"" is a great movie that somehow manages to be cynical and unrelenting in its realism, even as it stays sweet and sentimental on the surface.  The way this movie weaves drama, social commentary and comedy into a perfectly subtle and disturbing little fable reminded me of another great French title released by Criterion: ""Le Corbeau"".  Watching ""Forbidden Games"" will almost certainly make you want to see other films by Rene Clement.",1150934400,,1002,4.934523809523809
640157,5,6303413161,"I completely relate to this film.  It's one of the best looks at childhood and children that I've seen put on celluloid, in that it doesn't assign to them a significant moralized side, but shows them working out and discovering the world around them, a world that is chaotic and ultimately unable to handle their moral questions.

Surely anyone can relate to the desire to form a cemetary of all the dead, and the appeal to mark all the graves--and of course, there's nothing wrong with that.  These children do things that aren't really wrong, but which are misunderstood by the adults... people who are less than graceful and very problematic morally too, but the characters don't question them because they're the adults.  Remind you of childhood at all?  ""But but but..."" ""No buts!""

It's certainly, of anything, a better and much more interesting take on what innocence really means.  It means innocence from the evils of the world, but it also means a lack of understanding of the icons and symbols that people have put so much weighted meanings into.  Ultimately a cemetary for every dead animal found is a much more idealistic understanding of death, but of course adults just don't have the time for that.

It's a portrait of childhood akin to the earlier chapters of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, fully comprehending the confusion and anxieties of childhood which compels the little kid to do things he knows will get him in trouble, but deeper inside feels a need to carry out.  Some have called this movie anarchistic and iconoclast, but it's really not.  It's a return to the selfish constraints of people too young to express themselves or understand what they're even supposed to express.

640158,5,6303413161,"Death, an abstract concept with much mystery surrounding it, has countless people pondering what happens next.  In the shadow of war, death becomes a tool of success, as the body count races towards an obscene amount while it augments fear in those who try to survive.  However, in the light of a child's nave understanding of the world, death has an oblivious meaning, as young children have just begun to discover their own existence.  Thus, it is a consensus that children should be spared the agonizing awareness of death, and many children are consequently sheltered from the notion of death and other dark themes.  Yet, director Ren Clment purposely shatters the life of innocence by portraying the taboo topic in Forbidden Games, as death exposes itself to a young girl in a close and personal manner amidst the Nazi's Blitzkrieg on Paris in June 1940.

The acoustics of a lute plucking an ancient and playful tune accompanied by a hand thumbing through the opening credits in a book launches Forbidden Games.  It triggers the atmosphere of an innocent fairy tale, but it is not a fairy tale in the modern sense.  Instead, the film delivers a darker and much grimmer story similar to those of the Brothers Grimm.  As the final page of the book is turned, a caravan of cars, people, and other vehicles in a great hurry struggles to cross a river on a narrow bridge when a large number of Luftwaffe's death messengers begin to attack the escaping Parisians.  In the middle of the fleeing convoy, a family with the daughter Paulette (Brigitte Fossey) and the dog Jock are stuck, as the car just broke down. In panic, people push the broken car out the way, as the father and mother witness their situation worsening.

With the car broken and off the road, the family has no other choice than to continue on foot across the bridge while the aerial war machines attempt to kill everything that moves.  Amidst the chaos, Jock runs off crossing the bridge with the little Paulette chasing him.  In terror, both the mother and father run after Paulette, and halfway across the bridge the parents throws themselves over Paulette protecting her from the bullets cutting through the air.  When Paulette opens her eyes, both parents rest peacefully next to her on the dusty gravel road, as they have been pierced by large caliber machinegun shots.  Carefully, Paulette studies her mom, as if she were sleeping.  It is evident that the situation is foreign to her.  The scene's culmination arrives when she notices Jock twitching uncharacteristically; as the poor dog's nerves send their final twitches through its limbs.

The bridge scene presents powerful and gripping symbolism in multiple ways. For example, the scene suggests that Paulette is still unaware of life's mysteries, as when she reaches the bridge's midpoint.  However, it is clear that she notices that there is something unusual with the situation, as she begins her journey across.  Her reaction to the situation indicates that something new is happening, as she appears somewhat stunned to the gruesome event. It is not until a small wagon pulled by the old man picks up Paulette that she learns about Jock's condition when an old woman tells her that the dog is dead.  Innocently, she responds, ""It's dead."" as the woman tosses the corpse into the river underneath the bridge.  It is seems as if she has heard about death before, but is also apparent that she oblivious of the meaning of death.  All the audience can do is sit and watch in sorrow, as the little girl fetches the dead Jock out of the shallow river.

Many people usually discuss death with their children at some point in their lives, but when Paulette recently became an orphan, she no longer has the luxury of being educated in the mysteries of life by her parents.  Instead, she embraces the departed Jock while her footsteps aimlessly lead her into the woods.  More symbolism surfaces here through the aimless wandering in the forest, which suggests that she is facing some confusion in the new situation.  Nonetheless, the wandering also symbolically implies that she is wrestling with the idea of death.  Her drifting eventually leads her to the farm boy Michel Dolle (Georges Poujouly) who brings her to his family.

In a crude and tactless manner, the poor Dolle family welcomes Paulette, as they seem more troubled with the basic needs than providing shelter for the little girl.  Nonetheless, the Dolles takes the little girl in, as they quickly begin to school her in the farm life.  It is a lifestyle that many might find unusual; some might even go as far as advocating that it is outlandish.  It is a straightforward no-nonsense approach without any pretense of what ultimately will happen to all living beings, as death belongs to the everyday routine on a farm.  It is not that the family is not concerned with death, but how they deal with it.  The family's pragmatic approach to death feels awkwardly insensitive that brings thoughts of people being uncivilized, selfish, and immoral.  Much of this sentiment emerges through the son Michel when he provides Paulette with what she desires.

The combination of catechism, word of mouth by the Dolles, and Michel's willingness to support of Paulette's newly acquired ideas begin to form a bizarre concept of death.  Meanwhile, there is no safeguarding of what might seem appropriate and inappropriate, which allows the Michel and Paulette do whatever they want.  It leads to the two starting a morbid game that has its roots in Paulette's unguided discovery of death.  She has developed her own idea that Jock should not rest alone in the little grave.  Without much thought, Michel provides all the help he can, as his childish infatuation with Paulette motivates him to do whatever it takes to ease her newly found agony.  It leads the story into a ghastly direction that stains the basic notion of children's innocence, but it also provides an intriguing proposition of how children learn from their environment.

Ren Clment breaks the taboo of death and children by telling this story, but he does it tactfully and brilliantly through clever symbolism and remarkable scene framing.  What truly emerges in the film is the corruption of innocence, a concept that Clment shows through ignorance and feverish emotions.  In addition, he proposes that children display their view of the world through play.  Furthermore, children learn from those around them, as they begin to reflect on their own experiences.  Ultimately, it provides the foundation of a child's world perspective, and they begin to form their own ideas with or without guidance - sometimes these children are misled.",1138492800,,6678,4.912655971479501
640159,5,6303413161,"Forbidden Games deals with the reaction of a couple of children -Paullette, who losses both her parents as the consequence of an air attack, and Michel, the youngest of a peasant family in which Paullete finds refuge- in the context of the horrors of war, in this case, the second world war, in 1940.

The movie (unlike others dealing with children and war, like ""Germany, Year Zero"") does not portray a miserable and deadly environment. Certainly, war is sensed all the time, and the danger of falling bombs is ever present. However, the movie is set in the seemingly peaceful countryside, not among ruins and combats. That doesn't diminish the tragic context of the movie at all. Because we have witnessed what Paullette has gone through. And although Michel doesn't seem to have had any kind of traumatic loss, he's old enough to know what's going on, and what Paullette is suffering. Maybe, this explains the way Michel wants to please Paullette, in her way to direct her pain. Their game of stealing crosses to complete a ""big"" animal cemetery could be seen as a morbid and macabre play by chlidren spoiled by the war, transformed into monsters. However, we never question the innocence that remains in the main characters as children that they are: what's macabre is not what they do, it's the war that they are witnessing. They just channel the influence of war and its implicit dead without malice.

Whether this topic is analized as the simplicity of an ill influenced child's play, or through any psychological or mental connotations or meanings that could be applied, Forbidden Games is still, even today, a very original piece of cinema, that would hardly reach the same meaning if it's filmed today, without the context and recent history that influenced it back in 1952. Anyway, nowadays, any director that would try to make a movie like this would find himself being very cautious, and I think he would end up doing something too tragic or too simplistic. Ren Clement did the right thing with the material that was handed to him, and the story and its meaning is so powerful and well executed that can still be enjoyed today. And what seems to be an open ending, is useful to reminds us that in war, for children there are no happy ending stories.

Unlike what one might think about a movie made in 1952 and with children as the lead actors, acting is flawless. I said that we never question the innocence of the children, and that is due in great part to the looks and great work of Briggitte Fossey and Georges Poujoly, whom give great credibility to that premise.

Criterion Collection has made available this magnificent movie on DVD for the first time. As usual, it's a commendable work of restoration in many senses: in the sense of allowing more people -like me- to get to know this movie, and in the sense of giving it the best quality that the latest techniques allow.

The original French soundtrack is included, along with the english dubbed, both of them monophonic. Of course, english subtitles are included.

As Bonus materials we have alternate opening and ending, that would have given the movie a different context, less realistic, if you will. But I cannot help but think that they also could have given the story some more contrasting connotations. Also, there are interviews with the director alone and him with Briggitte Fossey (both from the 60's) and an interview with the actress in 2.001.

Unlike some other Criterion releases, there is no additional track with an expert shedding some light on aspects that might be of interest, but a little printed essay is included in a booklet.",1135728000,,3622,4.776357827476039
640160,5,6303413161,"The Criterion Collection has issued a superb transfer of Rene Clement's masterpiece about how warfare affects children, ""Forbidden Games."" If you can watch it without being moved you have no business watching it. It's a fine piece of filmmaking by the director of such works as ""Gervaise"" (Maria Schell in the Emile Zola novel), ""Purple Noon"" (Alain Delon in the first of the three ""Ripley"" films), and the all-star docudrama ""Is Paris Burning?"" Place this one on the shelf beside DeSica's ""Shoe Shine,"" Truffault's ""Small Change"" and Malle's ""Au Revoir les Enfants.""

A lost orphan (Brigitte Fossey) and a farmboy (Georges Poujouly), caught up in German attacks on the French countryside, react to the horror by creating a hidden cemetery for dead insects and animals, making and stealing crosses for the tiny graves. It's an indictment of war and of adults who fail to see how death on such a scale can scar children. When  their secret is discovered, their bond goes unnoticed and they are cruelly separated. At the end, the sorrow is so profound you will sit there speechless.

Clement presents the farm folk as stereotypes so that the children, the enormity of their isolation and disorientation, are seen in stark relief. Guitarist Narciso Yepes is heard throughout playing a lovely ballad. And the director has drawn from little Fossey and Poujouly performances of great beauty. Judges at the Venice Film Festival were wowed enough to name the five-year-old the Best Actress of 1952 (the adult Fossey is interviewed in a disc extra.)

640161,5,6303413161,"One of the first films to see the horrors of war through the eyes of children, Forbidden Games was a critical smash, winning prizes from the New York Film Critics, the British Academy, and the Venice Film Festival. Adapted by Francois Boyer, director Rene Clement, and two others from Boyer's novel, the story focuses on Paulette (Brigitte Fossey), a five-year-old refugee from Paris taken in by a peasant family after her parents are killed during a bombardment of a civilian convoy. Michel Dolle (Georges Pujouly), the family's 11-year-old son, becomes her best friend, and they create a cemetery in which Paulette's dog is interred, along with other animals and insects, some of whom the children kill themselves. The Dolle family is too busy feuding with the Gouards, their neighbors, to notice the absence of the children. Eventually, authorities locate Paulette and insist that she be placed in an orphanage for legal adoption. Unsentimental and yet heartbreaking, Forbidden Games demonstrates the strategies of children who witness war to deal with the constant presence of death. It's also a bitter condemnation of the selfishness of adults who could offer their charges more love and protection

It should come as no surprise that filmmaker Rene Clement spent five years in search of financing for this unsparing look at the ravages of war on children. It's not that the violence in the film is so intense; even both of the story's young protagonists, Paulette and Michel Dolle, survive without a scratch. But the portrait Forbidden Games paints of its adult characters is unsparingly disdainful; this is not exactly a tribute to the imperishable spirit of the French people during wartime. Paulette and Michel have their own way of dealing with war, by building a cemetery for animals in an abandoned mill. Michel's parents and older siblings and their neighbors, the Grouards, have their way, too, by sniping at each other and jockeying for position among the community as to who is perceived as the most generous - or least selfish. The Dolles' decision to take in Paulette is based in part on their fear that if the Grouards do the same, they'll earn another civilian medal. There is more than one set of forbidden games being played here: The secret that Paulette and Michel share runs parallel to an affair between Michel's teenaged sister, Berthe, and the Grouard's son, Francis, a soldier on leave. But even here, the children come off as more noble than their furtively groping adult counterparts. For a story with the potential to drip with easy sentimentality (generous peasant family takes in adorable war orphan), Forbidden Games offers something more bracing: a clear-eyed view of the innocence of children and the myopia of adults amid the ravages of war. Nothing else in Clement's career matched the achievement of this classic.",1134604800,,2853,5.0702127659574465

640176,5,6303413161,"In French the title of this movie is perhaps appropriate, but in English it is misleading.  What is ""forbidden"" about the games that the children play has nothing to do with sex (the usual designation of ""forbidden"" in English).  Instead what 11-year-old Michel Dolle (Georges Poujouly) and 5-year-old Paulette (Brigitte Fossey) do that is forbidden is they steal crosses, from the cemetery, from the top of a horse-drawn hearse--Michel even attempts to steal the rector's crucifix.  They do this as a way of coping with death.  The crosses are for dead animals, her dog, some chicks, a worm, etc. that they have buried in a little plot under the mill near a stream.

But this is not a horror show or anything like it.  Instead, Ren Clment's celebrated tale of childhood love is actually a strongly religious anti-war movie of incredible delicacy, laced with humor and poignancy.

It begins with an air attack on a stream of people (presumably Parisians running from Paris) along a country road trying to escape the encroachment of the Nazi army.  Little Paulette is in a car with her parents and her little dog, Jock.  They are gunned down by a German fighter plane. Paulette's parents and the dog are killed.  Paulette is left alone carrying the dead dog in her arms.  Eventually she wanders onto a farm where she is met by Michel who takes an instant liking to her and becomes her protector and her friend.  His is a peasant family of farmers who really don't need another mouth to feed, but they take her in.  She is so clean, they exclaim and she smells so good.  She is from Paris.  She has just undergone the most horrible terror, the death of her parents and her dog, and now she must somehow come to grips with that loss.  What transpires is a child's interpretation of the healing power of religious ritual and symbol.

Clment uses the world of the children as a counterpoint to the war in the background and as a gentle satire on the church.  The children make a game of religion and in doing so demonstrate the healing power of ritual and sacrament.

What makes this totally original and deeply symbolic film work is the uncluttered and naturalistic vision of Clment and his wonderful direction of his two little stars.  Fossey in particular is amazing.  She is completely unaffected and natural, an adorable little girl suddenly alone in the world who must make a new world for herself against great odds.  Her sense of personal integrity and her strong will makes us believe that somehow she will succeed.  Incidentally, Fossey's performance here in conveying the creative world of the child should be compared with 4-year-old Victoire Thivisol's performance in Jacques Doillon's Ponette (1996), as should the skill and vision of the directors.  Both are deeply religious films that rely on the pre-socialized world of the child to show us our own spirituality.

Also very good is Poujouly as the farm boy who loves little Paulette and shows that love by assuming the psychological and spiritual responsibility for helping her to overcome the tragedy of being so brutally orphaned.  He is himself experiencing a pre-adolescent coming of age, a transition exemplified by rebellion and a growing independence of mind and spirit.  Poujouly is intense and fully engaged, so much so that in one scene we can see him mouth in unison Paulette's lines in preparation for his time to speak.  Clment left this in perhaps because he knew it would further characterize Michel's intensity.

This film won the Grand Prize at the Venice Film Festival in 1952 and an Academy Award the same year as best foreign film.  It is one of the wonders of the French cinema, a masterpiece of the human spirit not to be missed.  See it for the children, whose strength of character can inspire us all.
