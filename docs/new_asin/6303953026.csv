749640,4,6303953026,"Probably one of the best (or the best, actually) of the television series based on R.L. Stine's novels aiming to scare teenagers and pre-teens. This eerily effective and scary GOOSEBUMPS episode delivers enough thrills and chills to actually scare more serious horror fans who find movies like HALLOWEEN and THE EXORCIST scary. Just the thought of this normal Halloween mask (which first of all, is extremely scary looking to begin with) being stuck on your face as you slowly become the monster is just frightening. The script is nicely written so that it doesn't cross the line into extreme horror, but it does maintain excellent atmosphere.",1074124800,,643,5.0754716981132075
749641,5,6303953026,great movie for the tough 5yr old who isn't so tough after all.  just make sure they don't watch just before going to bed as you will surely be sleeping in their room tonight.,1028160000,3,175,4.147058823529412
749642,5,6303953026,"picked on at home, picked on at school, 12-year old Carly Beth is going to teach chuck and steve a lesson they will never forget. there's a new store in town and and she buys an ugly, hiddeist mask. it's everything Carly Beth hoped it would be. and more, and even more! mabye TOO much more! because halloween is almost over. and Carly Beth is still wearing that mask!",996883200,,367,4.333333333333333
749643,5,6303953026,"Although this is a 'childrens series', this story is facinating and terrifying for all ages.  The Mask itself would probably be the most frightening thing, if it was not for the amazing acting skills of Kathryn Long as Carly Beth Caldwell.  In truth, I purchased this tape to see Cody Jones, who portrays her little brother Noah, but Ms. Long's preformance was believable and frightening.  Definately a tape for all.",987724800,,416,4.914285714285715
749644,4,6303953026,"I enjoy watching the Goosebumps videos with my son and husband, although I enjoy reading the books to my son more. While my son is 6, younger than the usual Goosebump-fan age, he does like the Goosebump videos and books.
Stay Out of the Basement was entertaining albeit a bit hokey. However,  the hokiness seems to draw younger viewers in. This is the story of the  scientist-father who, while attempting to get his university job back,  develops new (and terrifying!) plant life.
The Haunted Mask was less  hoky and really fun to watch. It is a bit spooky, especially the idea that  the lead character, Carly Beth, becomes ""possessed"" by the  haunted mask. Still, love saves the day--nicely providing excellent grounds  for good discussion with your children about the importance of family and  love.
Night in Terror Tower actually spooked my husband and me! Eerie  images and spooky music work their magic while you view this story. The  whole concept of traveling through time works nicely with the good (the  children) vs. evil (the Lord High Executioner) concept. Some of the  build-up to various scenes can be a bit intense for younger viewers,  though. If you're into English history or Shakespeare, you'll recognize a  wonderful correlation with King Richard III and the young princes he  allegedly murdered while they were imprisoned in the tower.
Out of all  the Goosebumps videos I've seen, I would say Night in Terror Tower is one  of the best, if not *the* best.",939859200,8,1475,4.883064516129032

749873,5,6303953026,"As a child, I loved this episode! I still consider it my favorite Goosebumps movie! Carly Beth is sick and tired of being scared all the time by Chuck and Steve, so she decides to get even. She goes to a Novelty Shop and finds the scariest mask she's ever seen. On HALLOWEEN night, Carly and her friend, Sabrina go trick-or-treating and Sabrina notices that Carly has changed ever since she put the mask on. Later, after she gets her revenge and scares Chuck and Steve, she tries to take the mask off, but it has become her new face. Carly goes back to the store and asks the manager for help. He tells her that only the symbol of love can help take the mask off. The other masks like Carly's start to come alive and try to get Carly Beth to join them. Can Carly Betn find the symbol of love in time? If you love Goosebumps, HALLOWEEN, and masks, you'll love THE HAUNTED MASK!!!

7858013,5,6303953026,"So, I got this because I keep a VHS collection and it includes a lot of movies that are special to me. The Haunted Mask is one of them. My daughter and I have a tradition of watching certain movies around Halloween every year and this has always been one of them. We are both adults now and yes this is for the younger crowd but we still love it and look for it every season. It's cute. It's about Carly Beth, a young girl who is known as the chicken, scared of everything. She gets teased by the boys in school. Halloween is coming and she wants payback and wants to get a scary mask. It backfires on her...I don't want to give away too much. :) Perfect for younger kids and not really scary. I enjoy it still. Tape plays fine and is as it should be, and the price was right. I recommend this movie if you have kids..around Halloween. In any format.",1440633600,,850,4.126506024096385
