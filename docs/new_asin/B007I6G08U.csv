8749337,4,B007I6G08U,"For those who have read Baba Yaga stories, this is an interesting bit, a curiosity.  It shares elements with Cinderella, Snow White/Sleeping Beauty, Hansel and Gretel, Beauty and the Beast, and other old tales.  The reverse action shot are hokey, yet amusing.
Even in big budget movies tire tracks and footprints from prep work can often be spotted, so I am pleasantly baffled when a magic pig sled travels a swerving route over fresh snow.",1497398400,,440,4.8533333333333335
8749338,5,B007I6G08U,"Is this a great movie? Maybe not, but it has an ""interesting"" art style, weird characters, bizarre special effects, an attractive leading lady, charming leading man, and a moral ta boot.",1483315200,2,186,5.032258064516129
8749339,3,B007I6G08U,Kind of chintzy but a cute story and an interesting glimpse of Russian moviemaking.  It's basically a Cinderella story ala Russ.,1483315200,2,128,5.095238095238095
