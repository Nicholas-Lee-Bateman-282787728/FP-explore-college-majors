7876315,1,6304672500,"This movie is LOW BUDGET in capital letters! The acting is a horrendus. The direction is scattered and I don't know what's going on. This is the kind of movie that would have been featured on Mystery Science Theater if there was some sci-fi involved in it.  I only rented this because it had Lela Rochon as the main character. Unless you are one of those viewers who appreaciate unintentional laughs and campiness, don't let the cover of this video sucker you into renting it.",1022025600,,476,4.6
