8435867,2,B004MALMBU,"what i didn't like was that i was not told the region that it was in and when i received it, i could not play it because it was not made for the american/canadian market, but for some other region in the world, probably europe.  If i had known that in advance, i would not have ordered it.  I do like most of the bloodrayne series and hoped that this was an extended or continuation of the previous release, Bloodrayne, The Third Reich. so i was very disappointed when it was not able to be played and seen.",1381104000,,507,4.163265306122449
