8614407,3,B00FCAK346,"This oddly titled DVD is a real mish mash and Im not sure why the producers made it so. The DVD runs 53 minutes and contains 15 performances.  Eight of these are by Dolly Parton and were taken from an Austin City Limits TV show in 2001 where Dolly spent half the show and Nickel Creek had the other half. This is the Dolly portion with Nickel Creeks Chris Thile on mandolin - and its a great performance.

But inserted between each of Dollys songs are clips of other country artists from different sources  many going back to the 1970s. I was able to recognize a YOUNG Lynn Anderson on Hollywood Palace and  though I don't know the source  the Charley Pride and Brenda Lee clips are obviously from the 1970s and Willie (with Leon Russell) and Loretta Lynn clips are from the 80,

The Austin City Limits Dolly scenes are more than watchable with standard TV resolution. The others have distorted sound and image issues  including an annoying green line on right side of screen for Willie/Leon.

Had they just released the 30 minutes of Dolly  and priced it cheap, this would have gotten 4 stars but  with the junk mixed in (thank goodness for chapter stops) Im giving it 3 stars cause of Dolly.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

So don't expect Dolly to be on the screen at same time as the other ""Guests"" listed on the package.
