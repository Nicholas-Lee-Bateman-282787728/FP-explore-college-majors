4258333,3,B0043X1FN6,"Harpoon: Whale Watching Massacre is a foreign horror film that is all about the gore. Without the gory death scenes, Harpoon wouldn't be the least bit worthwhile. Heck, it's barely worthwhile even with the gore. It's pretty slow, actually, even towards the end of the film. For gore fans only.",1300752000,,293,4.88
4258334,1,B0043X1FN6,"This Icelandic flick is half book since you have to read much of the so-called ""dialogue.""  In any language, this movie sucks.
Incoherent...sloppily made..horribly acted...boring and unimaginative..pick any negative adjective and it will fit.

4258335,3,B0043X1FN6,"This is Iceland's attempt at a slasher/ horror type film. It is in English or subtitled where not. A group of tourists go whale watching, but there are no whales to watch so the captain radios for help. He is lured to another vessel location under the ruse of seeing whales. Along the way, an obnoxious drunk Frenchman (Apparently Icelanders have the same respect for the French as the British)accidentally shish kabobs the captain of the boat. As the captain lays there dying, the first mate, damages the boat, takes a small craft and leaves them stranded. The adrift group is ""rescued"" by a family who used to whale, but can't because of international treaties etc. They hate whale watchers and foreigners. Once they are on board their ship, a woman's cell phone starts to work. She is quickly killed by one of the family as the rest of the rescued group scatters about the boat playing a deadly game of hide-and-seek, with the pretty blond tied up by a religious member of the family who wants to sacrifice her for the lord- go figure. Contains blood, killing, and nudity.

This movie is certainly better than many of the low budget B horror flicks, but fails to generate any real tension. This is perhaps I have seen so many of these things I have grown numb to people being harpooned or burned alive. The Japanese are stereo-typed with their taking photos, male chauvinism, and kamikaze ability. The Frenchman is obnoxious, you want him dead.

Yes, Gunnar Hansen,native of Iceland, (Leatherface) is in the movie. He plays kindly old Captain Petur and dies early in the movie. I didn't recognize him without someone else's face on his head.",1292025600,,1644,4.724738675958188
4258336,3,B0043X1FN6,"A routine whale watching trip ends in bloodshed when a family of ex-whale hunters board the ship and begin ruthlessly slaughtering its passengers. This Icelandic import is filled with grisly murders on the high seas, including a harpoon through the chest that leaves one of the victims hanging off of the side of the ship like an anchor. Gunnar Hansen makes a special guest appearance as the ship's captain that kills over early on in just one of the film's many links to TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. The psychotic family members also draw distinct similarities to the Sawyer family; each were forced out of their occupations that involved animal killing, and each are composed of three members with one parent and two dysfunctional youths. HARPOON's familiar plot does not take away from its overall enjoyment, but the uneven pacing and unlikable victims do make it harder to connect. By sticking with traditional practical effects aboard the cold and cramped setting, Julius Kemp builds a dark and suffocating mood that reflects many of his grindhouse influences with this brutal and bloody Slasher.

8415432,1,B0043X1FN6,"A group of international tourists (Japanese, German, French, American) gather on a boat in Reykjavik, Iceland to go whale watching, an increasingly popular activity in the area now that whale fishing has been banned. Things don't look too good when the ship's captain can't find any whales to view, but they become exponentially worse when he's killed in a freak accident that leaves the boat adrift.
The passengers think that their luck has changed when another boat arrives, but unbeknownst to them, the rescuers are a deranged family -- a mother and two adult sons -- who have a harpoon to grind with foreign ""animal huggers"" who've cost them their whale hunting livelihood.

NOTHING in this film works. The characters are as annoying as any I can think of in recent memory -- and that's saying a lot for a horror movie fan. They're an ugly lot, comprised of lecherous men, catty women, drunken jerks and backstabbers who constantly bicker and scheme for their own benefit. Practically every character is so reprehensible, it's hard to know who we're supposed to be rooting for.

Perhaps most irritating is how passive they are as victims. They outnumber their less-than-intimidating attackers (one of whom is a 60-year-old woman) three to one and never bother to organize in self-defense.

Not only are the characters written as unlikable, but their actions are also wildly irrational and/or inconsistent with their own characterizations. Why does the captain's mate suddenly abandon ship before the crazed family even arrive? Why does one woman not help another when she's being raped? Why does one man send others off an a life raft and stay on board the ship when he could easily have jumped on? Why does one woman who is initially set up as a sympathetic heroine do a complete 180 and turn into a villain?

It's a sloppily written story that revels in the worst that people have to offer (racism, xenophobia, rape, murder) and can't be redeemed by action that's surprisingly bland for its sensational title. There is really only one harpoon scene, and it's not nearly as explicit as the gore hounds among us would hope for. The site of a body hanging from the side of the ship is much more impactful, but thanks to awkward direction and derivative action sequences, the impact of the gore and mayhem -- the primary selling point of the film -- is minimal.",1363996800,,2363,4.841584158415841
8415433,2,B0043X1FN6,"Here's a movie guaranteed to alienate everyone.  The presentation, supposedly humorous, is instead quite abrasive and not a little offensive.  Uncontrolled potshots are taken at the French, whalers, whale watchers, Greenpeace, Japanese tourists, Blacks, Gays, and at one point one of the killers evokes a plea to ""the lord, our father, the fuehrer.""  It's basically a free-for-all, playing to the stupidity of the characters who do little in the way of trying to save themselves or others from an assault by three vicious morons.  It's this cynical aspect that dooms this project.  Few of the characters rise above the scorn they're meant to deliver as mere ciphers not people.  In fact, some are dispatched so quickly, off screen, that forgetting them is an easy task, they never registered to begin with.  This is a movie about types of people and their obnoxious prejudices.  It's an obvious commentary put forth with little finesse.  And sadly, there's also little in the way of horror involved (I could forgive their snideness if there were).  But it's just a lot of running around with people getting axed in the usual manner.",1363737600,,1132,5.005347593582887
8415434,3,B0043X1FN6,"I watched this movie recently on Chiller and assumed it would be a complete waste of time. However, it was better than I expected. I can't picture myself running off to buy my own copy, but it's worth a watch if you can't find anything else. I thought the ""villians"" were very creepy people, so that helped sell the film.",1361923200,,321,4.366666666666666

8415436,2,B0043X1FN6,"What do you expect from the film ""Harpoon: Whale Watching Massacre""? Or ""Reykjavik Whale Watching Massacre"" (its alternate title)? Whether a straightforward slasher film or a horror spoof of the genre, you will naturally expect something fun and exciting. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but the best thing about the Icelandic movie is its clever title.

The basic storyline is a familiar one, but not without some twists. A group of whale watching tourists is trapped in a whaler owned by a murderous family having a grudge against environmentalists. There is so much bloodshed, but no memorable killer like Leatherface. Characters are all stereotypes, the killers or the victims.

You will find that not many characters are likable, and that is probably intentional. The script is penned by Sjn Sigurdsson, acclaimed author and poet, also Oscar-nominated (with Lars von Trier and Bjrk) for the song ""I've Seen It All"" in ""Dancer in the Dark."" Like Bjrk's dark musical, the story is told with a cynical view on human nature.

That means you will never know who will survive in""Reykjavik Whale Watching Massacre"". That should be a good thing, but as the film suffers from the heavy-handed narrative, bad editing and wooden acting, the end result is dull and uninteresting, except in a few scenes where hapless tourists get killed in a very stupid way.

Icelandic-born Gunnar Hansen (""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"") appears as Captain Ptur, but his role is rather small and may not be what you would think.",1328054400,3,1502,4.996
8415437,3,B0043X1FN6,"Man, Icelanders are still taking the international ban on whaling pretty hard indeed.  A few of them apparently have way too much time on their hands, what with the all the cold weather and long dreary nights with nothing to do but complain about the ban and fashion little whale models out of wood to hawk to the wretched tourists whose zeal for whale watching just pours salt in the wounds of those no longer permitted to mindlessly butcher those beautiful creatures.  It's just too much for some of them - well, three of them, at least, who go strange in the head and decide to keep practicing their murderous ways on an entirely different animal.  I think you know where this is going.  It makes for a dark and depressing film that relies far too much on gore and the casting of Gunnar ""Leatherface"" Hansen for its appeal.  This movie makes Iceland look like the most depressing country on earth, and its treatment of foreign tourists can do nothing but hurt the Icelandic tourist industry as a whole.  You think you've had a bad day - try waking up late, getting raped, witnessing a horrible accidental death, being tied up and tortured, and then being hunted down by a family of inbred lunatics in the space of a few hours.  That's just part of one poor young lady's experience in this movie.

This definitely isn't your standard horror movie, especially given the fact that the cast of characters doesn't even share a common language.  Those boarding the whale watching boat of death include three middle-aged German broads (I don't mean to be offensive - there's just no other way to describe these women); a Japanese family made up of a male chauvinist husband, his wholly submissive wife, and their sullen daughter; a young and nave German lass; a bereaved American young woman; a drunk and troublemaking Frenchman; and the only black man in Iceland.  After a highly unfortunate series of events, they find themselves stranded at sea.  Rescue soon comes in the form of a local whaler, but instead of returning the tourists to the harbor, he takes them back to his whaling vessel to be tortured and killed by his insane family.

I must warn my fellow animal lovers that the opening credits of this film feature vintage footage of whaling operations, so you might want to look away until the opening music ends.  As for the story itself, the best thing it has going for it is its unconventionality - what little bonding there is between characters is tenuous at best; even the most vulnerable of individuals can end up being hateful little smegheads when their lives are on the line; and the ending certainly didn't play out the way I expected it to.  As for the gore, you have a case of quantity over quality, and the filmmakers really push things too far toward the end, making the most horrific deaths much more comical than I'm sure they intended.  The whole dreary atmosphere of the entire film was a major downer for me, as well.  This really is one of the most depressing horror movies I've seen in a long time.  If you want something different, Harpoon: Whale Watching Massacre can certainly fit the bill - but that doesn't mean you're likely to enjoy watching it.

By the way, stick around for the closing credits to hear one of the most unusual songs you've ever heard - it's downright schizophrenic.  And while you're there, watch for the names of Clint Eastwood, Brad Pitt, and Barack Obama in the list of those the filmmakers wish to thank.  Perhaps it is Obama's duplicitous efforts to end the whaling ban for Iceland, Norway, and Japan that secured his spot on the list.  Of course, it must be said that Iceland actually resumed commercial whaling in 2006 - the self-imposed quotas may be small, but the action still flies in the face of the long-standing international moratorium the country accepted in the past.",1315958400,,3837,4.671619613670134
8415438,3,B0043X1FN6,"Set mostly at sea, in the waters around Iceland, Harpoon: Whale Watching Massacre (2009), is a strange little suspense thriller, that probably won't do much to promote tourism to the small north Atlantic republic.  The film follows the adventures of a group of tourists, who unexpectedly find themselves in a grim struggle for survival.  There are a few messy kills, some tense atmospheric moments, and even the appearance of a semi-frisky killer whale, but overall the film isn't as cohesive or nearly as frightening as it could have been.  A bit hard to follow in places, and with a few plot twists, the movie's unconventional finish leaves many questions unanswered.  Spoilers follow, so abandon ship if you feel the need.

An assorted group of tourists board a small boat with the hope of catching a glimpse of some whales.  The party of ten includes three middle-aged female tourists, and a Japanese couple and their aide.  Out in the open sea, the captain (Gunnar Hansen) is has a spear run through his chest in a freak accident.  Upon hearing the news, the criminal-minded ship's mate disables the craft, and then departs in a rubber raft, leaving the tourists to manage on their own.  Icelandic hospitality seems to be seriously lacking, until a small boat arrives, and ferries the survivors over to a larger fishing boat.  When the visitors are gathered on deck, the crew of the whaling ship, a mother and her two sons, suddenly whip out weapons and begin attacking the tourists.

Two of the middle-aged women are the first to go, one takes a hammer through the skull, and the other is tossed overboard after having her throat slit.  Tryggvi (Helgi Bjornsson), one of the whalers, tests out shooting skills, sinking a harpoon into one of the tourists attempting to swim away.  The rest of the tourists have scattered inside the ship, and the remainder of the film is mostly a game of hide and seek, as the crew attempt to hunt down and kill their prey.  There doesn't seem to be any motive behind the carnage, although Siggi (Stefan Jonsson) the other whaling brother, has more than a casual interest in Annette (Pihla Viitala).

The survivors manage to get things together, and begin to take action.  Endo (Yuuki Nae), the aide to the Japanese couple proves to be rather resourceful, turning her employer into an incendiary device that manages to partially roast one of the attackers.  Fortunately for those on the run, the whalers aren't very efficient at hunting, and some of the survivors even manage to escape from the ship.  There's not a lot of cooperation among the group, but Leon (Terence Anderson) does his best to save blondes Annette, and Marie-Anne (Miranda Hennessy).  When the authorities arrive on the scene, it looks like the game is over for the killers, but there will be several twists more before this tale is over.

With the whalers proving to be such inept killers, Harpoon: Whale Watching Massacre isn't quite the splatterfest that it could have been.  Except for being set on a ship, this is a rather routine little slasher, that doesn't quite live up to its name, or make the most out of the situation.  The various plot twists, feature some of the tourists being killed by others in their group.  The brief and not particularly impressive appearance of a killer whale, is the only instance of whale watching, but frankly doesn't add very much to the film.  The production values and cinematography are good.  The screenplay has bits of humor, but mostly plays it straight, and the acting is generally very solid, with native Icelander Gunnar Hansen, Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), probably being the most recognized name.  It's not an outstanding entry into the genre, but if you are into hunt and kill type thrillers, you may want to give this a look.",1314403200,,3811,4.8246153846153845
8415439,5,B0043X1FN6,"I LOVE this movie!  The script is excellent, it also has dark humor, which kept me laughing (it's difficult to mix humor and tragedy, but this movie managed to  do it!).

I've watched this movie 10-30 times, and each time, I still laugh at the dark tragedy and enjoy the characters.  The acting is great and I'd say this producer/director pulled off a most successful movie script, with high, engrossing entertainment.

I'd highly recommend this movie to those who enjoy horror, trauma, mixed with dark comedy.

GREAT MOVIE !!!",1305849600,2,527,4.865168539325842
