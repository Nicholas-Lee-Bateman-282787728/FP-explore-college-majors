4987944,5,B006GVN2CA,Ricki and Abby did it again!  The videos are amazing and empowering!  I will encourage my colleagues and friends to view and share them!,1350172800,,136,4.625
4987945,5,B006GVN2CA,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this DVD - tons of content and great information!  If you own the Business of Being Born, I would recommed adding this to your library as well...its a great addition!",1349654400,,183,4.545454545454546
4987946,2,B006GVN2CA,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE ""The Business of Being Born""!!  I had high hopes for ""More Business of Being Born"" and was hoping that it would contain more indepth information and interviews than it's predecessor.  Unfortunately, I found it to be lacking in content and honestly, quite boring.  I was really disappointed and would not recommend.  I do however give ""The Business of Being Born"" 5 stars!!",1345680000,4,389,4.848484848484849
4987947,5,B006GVN2CA,"Just finished watching.  Such a great follow up to the first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Business-of-Being-Born/dp/B0013LL2XY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Business of Being Born</a>.  A must see for anyone having a baby because it truly gives you information for an informed decision on your birth and the choices out there.  For me it just solidified my thoughts and feelings about having a VBAC, switching from a traditional practice to a Midwife, and hiring a Doula for my second birth (first was a nightmarish C-section for a breech that was missed by 4 doctors!).  My husband enjoyed getting the information too, and amazingly it sparked a conversation about our plans, and makes him feel empowered as well.  I have three friends in line to borrow DVDs already.

Its funny how your feel so connected to the celebs in their video because they are women too just trying to make the best decisions for themselves and baby!  Really cool spin.  VBAC video was personally my favorite because even after all my research, I still learned a few new things.",1344384000,6,1105,5.421052631578948
4987948,5,B006GVN2CA,I loved this video.  Even better than the first one which I also really enjoyed.  So many great minds and also celebrities makes it informative and entertaining.  It is about time we had an honest discussion about the problems in our culture related to birthing choices for women and their families.  A great testament to the power of grassroots activism!,1331510400,10,355,4.866666666666666
4987949,5,B006GVN2CA,every woman needs to watch both the Business of Being Born & More Business of Being Born these documentaries are mind expanding for all and packed with information. I highly recommend them especially to anyone having or planning to have a baby wether its you first or your next child. Also great for Doulas and or Midwives to have as part of their video library.,1330905600,9,362,4.584615384615384
4987950,5,B006GVN2CA,This is the best doc I have ever seen!!! I had a natural birth and this just confirms I made the right decision! Thankful they took the time to make this!!! Looking forward to seeing the other parts.,1329782400,3,199,4.2631578947368425
4987951,5,B006GVN2CA,"Rickey and Abby did it again.  This was wonderful and less home birth heavy.  Loved the famous women telling about there birth experiences. Lots of very good info including VBAC, doulas, and c-sections.  Must see for all women who plan to give birth for the first time or the 11th time.",1328572800,17,286,4.568627450980392
4987952,4,B006GVN2CA,"I ordered this DVD set from the The Business of Being born website. I paid close to $60 for it. I didn't want to wait for it to become available on Amazon because my baby is due before then and I really wanted to watch this with my husband beforehand. There are two DVD's. Each one has two sides. When I got the first one in the mail, side ""B"" of the first DVD wouldn't work. I even tried it in 2 different DVD players. I e-mailed the company and they immediately sent me a second one. Well, the second one had the EXACT same problem. I'm really frustrated at this point. On a good note, the three parts we watched were great and really informative. Not quite as good as the original documentary, but much more educational.",1328400000,5,723,4.246376811594203
8497874,5,B006GVN2CA,Much recommended ! Awesome book,1508198400,,31,5.4
8497875,5,B006GVN2CA,This was one of the best documentaries I watched about child birth!,1464393600,,67,4.666666666666667
8497876,4,B006GVN2CA,"I probably would not have bought this DVD if my library had had it. I had already watched 'Business of Being Born', so I had to catch this one.  I enjoyed the stories and plans discussed, but as I soon learned, when it's time for baby to make his first appearance, birth plans can very easily go out the window. I would still recommend checking out this movie, earlier in the pregnancy the better.",1420243200,,397,4.364864864864865
8497877,5,B006GVN2CA,Awesome! I use this often for my clients. I highly recommend for anyone looking into information on birth in America.,1416873600,,117,4.9
8497878,5,B006GVN2CA,The first Business of Being Born is a huge reason I decided to get a midwife! The rest of the movies are also full of great information and stories from other moms. I tell everyone I know to watch these!,1405900800,,203,4.1
8497879,5,B006GVN2CA,Great movie! All four dvds. Spanish subtitles available. It has a lot of important information about birthing. I Loved it!,1401580800,,122,5.15
8497880,5,B006GVN2CA,I liked the original documentary and I had to see these too.  Very glad I did.  Very informative and empowering.,1374624000,,112,4.55
8497881,5,B006GVN2CA,"This series just continues what was brought up in part one. Only this time you see more information from a research stand point from experts like the mother of modern midwifery  Ina May Gaskin herself. You also get to see interviews about the various birth experiences of celebrity moms like Cindy Crawford, Alanis Morissette, GIselle, Layla Ali, Mellisa Joan hart and others who discuss their experiences. They talk of homebirth, hospital birth, birth center births, coping techniques, c- sections what labor felt like to them, and how people reacted to their birth choices. It is thoroughly enjoyable whether you are pregnant or not.",1371081600,2,635,5.165048543689321
8497882,5,B006GVN2CA,I loved the first movie because all the questions i had were answerd. And this one had so much information too. Definitely worth buying!,1363996800,,136,4.708333333333333
8497883,5,B006GVN2CA,"The 4 Cds that make up this movie are phenomenal. Everything is broken down and explained in a neutral manner. They are not anti-hospital or anti-medical establishment, but they clearly show us that there are many different birthing options out there and women need to be more informed. I didn't see this until I was preganant with my third. I wish someone had given it to me when I was preganant with my first.",1351382400,4,411,4.5675675675675675
