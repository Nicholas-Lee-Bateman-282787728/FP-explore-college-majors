4994685,5,B006JN87QG,My son likes watching this movie.  He learns Godly values from the Veggie tale gang in a fun learning manner.,1334448000,,109,4.45
4994686,5,B006JN87QG,"I love all VeggieTales, but this one is very cute.  I love how VT's is starting to do Prince and Princess themes, like Disney (can I say that;)  I love Disney, but I would rather show my child(ren) VT movies on a daily basis, then to subject them to the violence that seems to be in every Disney movie.  I am not a Disney hater, they make some amazing films, but lets be honest, every film has evil stepparents and/or villains.",1334188800,,427,4.246913580246914
4994687,4,B006JN87QG,"I like VeggieTales use of classic stories to convey spiritual truths. Initially, they may have resorted more to Bible stories, which got them into trouble with those who did not like the liberty they took with Scripture. Biblical purists will have a harder time complaining when classics are used to illustrate biblical values.

This DVD starts with a coming attraction that captivated my interest. Various individuals involved in making The Penniless Princess: A Story of True Worth, slated for release in August 2012, discuss the story, which is adapted from A Little Princess by Frances Burnett.

The fascinating analysis shows the commitment and professionalism that goes into each VeggieTales production; not least of which is the communication of spiritual values. In a recent article for Christianity Today, VeggieTales' founder Phil Vischer points out why this is important, ""There is no God on Sesame Street.""

VeggieTales deserves applause for introducing children to God and Christian values. They do it in a way that is entertaining to little ones and adults. The stories follow a simple but effective formula: start with timeless values derived from Scripture and mix in excellent production and witty humor.

Robin Good also starts with a bonus short, ""Lenny & The Lost Birthday,"" starring Junior Asparagus, which almost steals the show from the main attraction. Bob the Tomato narrates this lesson on worth. It is so well done that I would have been satisfied with this alone.

However, if I had stopped there I would have missed plungers that become arrows and seeing the terrible dungeon of despair. In Robin Good fundraising from the rich during tough economic times (note the social commentary on current events) leads Robin's men to take up stealing, something Robin is against because stealing is wrong. Robin feels the hurt of being abandoned by his men, but it leads to the central theme, which is no hurt is too big for God. Psalm 55:22 directs us to cast our burdens on God, and He will sustain us. In this story, and in the bonus short, we learn that the best way to handle disappointment and hurt is to give it to the Lord.

What would a VeggieTales episode be without a Silly Song with Larry? It is unthinkable. ""Bubble Rap"" is the newest Silly Song, which is found here and on If I Sang a Silly Song ... (DVD).

VeggieTales is getting better with age, which says a lot, since from the beginning they set a high standard. The commentary on The Penniless Princess is a treat, and the themes conveyed in the short and the main feature are a treasure.",1334016000,2,2576,4.867579908675799
4994688,5,B006JN87QG,"I was poohed on by others for giving this movie a great review prior to watching it.  Well, take your scorn and plaster it on your mantle because as I anticipated this is yet another hit by the bigs at Folk's Idea.  As usual an accurate depiction of a Biblical event told in a jolly funny, educating, funny display attributed to both adults and children alike.  They know their stuff and I doubt a bad movie is able to emanate from their wayside.  So there!",1333670400,,457,4.341176470588235
4994689,5,B006JN87QG,"This movie had a good solid message that was presented in a creative and entertaining manner.  It was not the normal dumbed down kiddy twaddle.  It wasn't big ideas best ever in the Veggie Tales series, but was still worth owning.",1333584000,,230,4.585365853658536
4994690,5,B006JN87QG,"My boys have only seen one other Veggie Tales DVD but they love the silly characters.  I mean who wouldn't love and laugh at a dancing/singing tomato, cucumber or squash!  Veggie Tales is a wholesome DVD that features all sorts of vegetable characters and does reference God.  Don't think this DVD is full of religion as it really isn't but it does have references when they are pointing out how to be good or what was wrong.
The DVD starts out with ""Lenny & The Lost Birthday"" which is an adorable short episode on Lenny who thinks everyone forgot his birthday.  He goes about his day sad and made, but then his mom points out that it is Leap Day and explains that.  It made it perfect to explain Leap Year!  Next up was a Bubble Rap video featuring Larry singing with his friends about bubble wrap!

My boys laughed and laughed and the show made it easy for them to understand what was going on.  The main part of the DVD is ""Robin Good and His Not-So Merry Men"" which showed how sharing and working together is good.  It is the tale of Robin Hood with a wholesome spin.

Overall, the DVD is full of fun songs and great lessons for young kids.  My boys have watched it a few times now and laugh every time!",1331769600,7,1208,4.277533039647577
4994691,5,B006JN87QG,Thanks again Larry and Bob for showing our children that with scripture we can always be better!  This story appeals to my 6 and 9 year olds as well as to my 12 year old son.  Thank GOD for Veggie Tales!!!,1331337600,2,205,3.975609756097561
4994692,5,B006JN87QG,"Oh Veggie Tales, how I love you! And then I love Robin Hood too, so to combine the two and end up with Robin Good. *sigh* I am one happy mama. Entertaining for all ages (from my six month old to my parents) - Veggie Tales is well loved in my family. This video starts with a great short perfect for celebrating Leap Year and President's Day. Then we have the Robin Good story full of value in moral and entertaining songs. (Who knew ""Big Brother"" was with so much in common with Prince John? hmm...) I love the humor and the entertainment for my toddler is priceless. Oh what a joy to, in a way, introduce her to the classic story I love with a Biblical message.

Definitely recommended!",1330646400,8,687,4.2846153846153845

4994713,4,B006JN87QG,"I'll be the first to admit that VeggieTales is not what it once was.  The shows featuring computer animated vegetables used to be pretty funny and have morals that were organic to the classic stories they were ripping off.  Now, the lessons often seem a bit forced and the jokes aren't quite as good.  But that doesn't keep me from enjoying the latest, Robin Good and His Not-So-Merry Men.

As the show opens, our co-host Larry the Cucumber is sad because his hamster Squeaky has run away.  Then we get a video chat from a kid who is sad because he's moved and doesn't have any friends.  Bob the Tomato, our other host, has two stories that will be perfect for both of them.

Up first is ""Lenny and the Lost Birthday.""  Lenny (Junior Asparagus) wakes up thinking it is his birthday, but no one says anything to him about it.  Did they forget or is he wrong?  The solution to this one is very timely and quite good, but before we get there, we are reminded that God loves us no matter what else is happening in our lives.

We take a short break for a new silly song - ""Bubble Rap.""  I should have seen it coming, but they bring back their boy band Boyz in the Sink (or B.I.T.S. as they are called here).  While they start out singing about how safe their dishes are for a move, they soon start talking about how much fun it is to pop.  I've got a love/hate relationship with the Boyz, mainly because I'm not a fan of the hip hop style they are always closest to with these songs.  The lyrics and visuals are pretty funny, however, so I'm sure most people will like it.

Finally, we are ready for the title feature.  But we can't have a hero who robs (which has always been my biggest problem with the Robin Hood stories), so here Robin (Larry the Cucumber) and his friends fund raise from the rich to give to the poor.  But when that doesn't work well enough for his friends, they leave him to rob Prince John (Mr. Nezzer, of course).  Can Robin figure out a way to overcome his hurt as his friends leaving him in order to help the people of Bethlingham survive under Prince John?

As I said before, the humor isn't quite what it once was, but that doesnt mean it's not here.  I laughed a few times, usually at throw away lines that were blink and you miss them type of things.  Even so, there is one potential gag they could have done much more with.  You'll know it when you see it.

The songs were better than they've been for a while; they were actually worth thinking about getting outside of a DVD is they are still even doing that.

And the moral is good.  When the world seems against you, it is important to remember that God does still love you.  However, I wish it didn't feel like they were forcing that into the stories.  At least in the Robin Good portion of the story, Robin has to hear that several times before he starts to reach out to others, acting on what he's been told.

So in the end, Robin Good and His Not-So-Merry Men is an enjoyable entry in the VeggieTales series.  I just wish it recaptured the old magic.",1432598400,,3034,4.253496503496503

Then the second half is the story of Robin Good, who gets betrayed by his band of not-so-merry men, but like the boy who lost his birthday, learns that God is still with him.

4994759,4,B006JN87QG,"First off, I wanted to start off my post by saying how much I love Veggie Tales. If you've ever seen our DVD collection, you'll see that we have almost every Veggie Tales DVD. I love their parodies of movies and the way that their movies teach good morals and values. I loved the movie, but I was slightly upset with their newest silly song that is entitled Bubble Rap. The reason that I am upset is because of a couple of the lyrics in the song. I know some people might think that it is crazy to be annoyed by these lyrics, but as Christians we are not supposed to give even the appearance of doing that something that is wrong. We're also called not to conform to the world. Which is why it bugs me when people take a bad word or phrase and tweak it so that it sounds a little different. It's still wrong even if you change one or two words. With that being said, I will tell you the two parts in the song that I was irked about. In the song Boyz in the Sink say, ""oh, snap"" and ""What's up, BITS?"" What does snap rhyme with and what is a word that means the same thing as it? I admit that I might be stretching a little bit here. But the other saying- say ""what's up, BITS?"" out loud and tell me what it sounds like you're saying. It sounds a bit like the B-word phrase. Yes, I know that BITS is an acroynym for Boyz in the Sink, but I still have to wonder what the writers were thinking when they came up with that phrase in the song. Imagine a 2-3 year belting that phrase out in the grocery store at the top of his or her lungs. And couple that with the fact that they don't always pronounce things correctly. HMMM.... So not a good combination!! Maybe it was just an honest mistake like the original lyrics to the Veggie Tales ""The Bunny Song"" that went something like- ""I don't love my mom or my dad, just the bunny. And it's such a shame about the phrase used in the song, Bubble Rap, because other than that it's a cute song! Okay, enough ranting!!",1342569600,17,1958,4.088311688311689
