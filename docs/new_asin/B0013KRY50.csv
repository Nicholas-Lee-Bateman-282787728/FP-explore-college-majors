8251608,4,B0013KRY50,This is an easy to follow way to learn to play some songs immediately. It does not help with learning to read music....but that is another issue. If you want to learn to play some some song...right now...this is a great DVD system,1358985600,,230,4.372093023255814
8251609,3,B0013KRY50,"the dvd is not what most buyers expect...see... the ad about the dvd is very vague..reviews about only one dvd rather the five...the instruction is in my opinion not for a beginner, and specially for a person that has never touched a guitar before....It would be great for me to get my money back when I return the item...please advise..Neo-mesa",1350259200,,345,4.766666666666667
8251610,1,B0013KRY50,"This is only for one DVD, volume 5.  I thought I was getting 5 DVDs because at the bottom of the page it says NUMBER OF DISCS:  5.  Amazon.com you screwed up!",1324425600,6,158,3.875
8251611,5,B0013KRY50,"This dvd set is awesome at teaching you how to play the guitar at a slow and detailed pace so that you can keep up and not get behind. It is user friendly. I believe that anyone could learn how to play. He starts out with the basics and then gradually advances to other things. He gives good advice and tips also. I would recommend this dvd set, if you are thinking about it.",1271289600,8,375,4.081081081081081
