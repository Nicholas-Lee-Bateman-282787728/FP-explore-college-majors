5915274,2,B00EI3Y1RS,"I watched this film primarily motivated by the opportunity to see some excellent shots of Italian beach scenery -- but didn't have high hopes for an original storyline. Overall, it was ... well ... a ""quiet"" film with no big surprises. Not that I need crap blowing up all the time (sooooo over the current state of the movie industry -- hello, we're not all 15 year old boys). But, it was definitely cliche given the oh-so-empty marriage narrative, and the characters themselves weren't really that compelling. All in all, though, it wasn't too terrible (again -- ITALY scenery) -- and Kate B pulled off a somewhat decent character study. As for the other reviewer's disappointment in the ending? Well, if it made you so upset, then the movie probably succeeded more than you thought it did. I personally think it ended just as it should have == it was realistic and in perfect alignment as to what the main character needed to do to truly move forward in her life journey. Bottom line? This is an okay rental (I actually would say 2.5 stars if Amazon had a 2.5 option) -- but maybe wait 'til it goes down in price a bit.",1378080000,4,1121,4.527093596059113
5915275,2,B00EI3Y1RS,"I'm a pretty open-minded movie watcher, and find great things in just about every movie. So even with the 2.5/5 stars on IMDB, I thought hey let's give this a try.

NOPE. Without giving anything away the movie follows main character (Kate Bosworth)on a trip to Ischia with her husband (super sweet and nice guy/violin player), and she has an affair, for reasons you will find out VERY EARLY in the movie if you actually decide to watch it. All whilst she is writing a book and listening to tapes of her grandmother (which I didn't feel did anything for the story line).

This movie upset me, and that is the reason I gave it 2 stars instead of just one, because the ending will surprise you, and no matter who you are (and who you choose) it will upset you. Which I think is hard for any writer or director to accomplish.",1377216000,2,821,4.359477124183006

5915277,4,B00EI3Y1RS,"This film enchants us with the caliber of performances by the three lead actors and by the gorgeous locale in southern Italy.  The plot itself is rather simple and little more enters into it than you might guess from the first 20 minutes.  Kate Bosworth has never looked more pent-up and restrained--I almost didn't recognize her here.  But that, of course, changes as the story develops.  What we encounter is not so much an affair as an awakening.",1410480000,,449,4.717948717948718

5915280,4,B00EI3Y1RS,"I liked this movie, but probably won't ever watch it again.  It was one of those films that has a good story, fine acting, but never quite reaches fullness.",1401840000,,156,4.379310344827586
5915281,4,B00EI3Y1RS,And While We Where Here is a lovely tale of one woman's journey set in the gorgeous backdrop in Italy. Jane was in an uninspiring marriage and trying to get inspired to write a book about the life of her grandmother. Her inspiration awoke upon meeting the carefree Caleb who showed Jane how to be herself and love herself again.,1398124800,,328,4.483333333333333
5915282,5,B00EI3Y1RS,I really enjoyed this film. I came across it in the recommended section from amazon after I finished watching closer and after seeing the trailer I was interested. I really liked it. The ending was great. It is a slow moving movie but that is the purpose I think. I hope everybody gives it a chance. It is worth watching till the end.,1392422400,,334,4.317460317460317
5915283,5,B00EI3Y1RS,Kate bosworths best performance. Beautiful story and Italy looked incredible. Loved it. Highly recommend. Black and white version is best.,1391731200,,138,5.95
5915284,5,B00EI3Y1RS,.... the journey of the main character is well depicted in this movie; without it being predictable. The ending was surprising yet very fitting. While Kate Boseworht may not be the greatest actress her performance did not tear at the greatness of the story. Well worth watching.,1388275200,,278,4.9361702127659575
5915285,4,B00EI3Y1RS,"The others reviews complained about not enough explanatory dialogue. I found it clear  what the characters were thinking and feeling without  that added dialogue. The addition of which would not have illustrated the bleakness of the state in which all of these characters find themselves. A child who is not fully developed is swept into some sort of black hole of grief that is being suffered by a woman who is seeking a child and for the time being is consumed with only her own need and disregards the consequences of her actions. The other review states the grandmother's recorded story adds nothing to the plot however  I found it to be the true narration of the story. The grandmother is telling of her experiences during the war while Jane begins her own war and destroys her own homeland in some sort of path of self destruction. I found the film to be riveting and interesting, nothing I would watch again as none of the characters are particularly likeable nor do they elicit much empathy - particularly Jane.",1387065600,3,1019,4.713483146067416
8605592,2,B00EI3Y1RS,"Dry, Boring, To many moment's if silence, nah pass. Scenery was pretty but that was about it to be quite honest.",1531699200,,112,4.380952380952381
8605593,4,B00EI3Y1RS,"Kate Bosworth caught my eye in the TV miniseries THE LONG ROAD HOME.  She has an angelic visage, a lithe cheerleader build and she plays the ""wounded doe"" persona well.  In this film she plays Jane, a British woman who is traveling to Rome with her husband (Leonard).  Leonard is a viola player in an orchestra that is on tour.  His extensive rehearsals leave little time for the couple to be together.  Jane is also coming off of a miscarriage as well as news that her body is incapable of carrying a fetus to term.

With plenty of leisure time on her hands, she happens upon a young American named Caleb.  While her husband Leonard is not an evil man and he does not mistreat her, he does come across as a bit stodgy & boring.  Everything with Leonard must be structured.  Caleb, on the other hand, is cantankerous, fun-loving, spontaneous & full of life.  She feels alive & vibrant when she is with him;  feelings she is altogether lacking in her passionless marriage with Leonard.

Such is the plot outline of the film.  It includes some spectacular scenery of an Italian castle as well as the Pantheon, which was designed by the Roman emperor Hadrian himself.  Unfortunately, while there were plenty of opportunities, the movie whiffs on the skin-o-meter as unfortunately Ms. Bosworth keeps her clothes on for the duration of the film.",1518998400,,1340,4.670940170940171

8605596,5,B00EI3Y1RS,This is a very interesting film .  It was a beautiful and thought provoking window into everyone's life or perhaps only mine. It ended with me being totally invested.  I am going to watch it again.  The acting was superb as was the scenery.,1494720000,,240,4.409090909090909
