8153973,5,B000K2PIH8,"Another pair of Clinton Anderson's great self help DVD's.  Very easy to follow and understand. Clear instructions on what he is going to teach, he talks you through the process as he performs it.  Clinton also discusses possible horse or rider problems that could arise and possible solutions.  Excellent DVD's.",1346112000,,311,5.18
8153974,5,B000K2PIH8,"English riders can have a tendency to look down our noses at cowboys.  Well, get over yourself.  Clinton packs more common sense - that apparently isn't all that common - into 5 minutes than most jumper clinics do in an entire weekend.  If you want to clear 4' courses you have to have the groundwork down first.  Thanks Clinton.",1338336000,2,329,4.52542372881356
