664593,3,6303464572,"Although this film captures the feel of NYC in its much grittier days, I nearly rate it 2stars because of its dismal plot. I love Richard Hell here. The one thing this film lacks is fun, which I have no doubt the punk scene was then, and is now. Granted, there are always lots of lazy moochers in a music scene, but this borders pathetic. She feels young and invincible, even in her desperate, selfish state. It could've been a cult classic if it were not for the depressing ending, and more amusement thrown in.",1365120000,2,512,4.4
664594,2,6303464572,"I remember 1982 well and this really doesn't capture the spirit of those times at all.  There is not much plot, character development, or style to be found.  It's just clueless, aimless, jobless, witless young people in the big city hoping to find who knows what.  The script and acting are bland and predictable.",1364774400,,313,4.7592592592592595
664595,3,6303464572,"Thought this might be one of those underground cult gems, but it's just a sad little tale of a wanna-be who strings some schmuck along, and ends up no where herself. Actually too realistic. Really a downer. I prefer when the characters rise above their faults, even if they don't succeed. These folks just allow them selfs to be swallowed up by the circumstances of their lazy lives.",1260489600,,383,4.647058823529412
664596,5,6303464572,"I can watch this film over & over. It is about the heart at the end of the rainbow - the million miles between what we want and what we get. Wren(Susan Berman)shows us the difference between charming and nice - so much to offer - so little to give. When a nice-guy-boy-next-door who really loves her invites Wren to Maine, she says, ""I don't even LIKE trees.""  Powerful music in the film glues these smithereens of people's existence together. Wren reminds me of another great own worst enemy: Jane Fonda's Gloria in ""They Shoot Horses - Don't They.""",1116633600,10,550,4.555555555555555
664597,5,6303464572,"I'm so glad they decided to release Smithereens on DVD.  It's great to see it in widescreen (who knew!), and share all those dark moments with the punk from hell, ALL over again! The DVD is fantastic, every Smithereens fans fantasy come true.  The actual DVD even has artwork.  Thank you to the makers of the film and the DVD release!",1112400000,4,334,4.442622950819672
664598,4,6303464572,"Long before ""Party Monster"" or ""Slaves Of New York"" explored the underbelly of the NYC downtown arts scene, there was ""Smithereens"". A young woman hustles her way through the early 80's NYC punk scene in an attempt to grab her ""15 minutes"" any way she can. Basically a more nihilist, East Coast version of the standard ""Bumpkin Getting Off The Bus In Hollywood With Stars In Her Eyes"" tale. This gritty little independent feature was the debut for then unknown director Susan Seidelman, who is perhaps best known these days for her involvement with ""Sex In The City"". Good performances from the mostly unknown cast. Music fans are sure to recognize Richard Hell (of the Voidoids, who penned the memorable punk anthem ""Blank Generation"") playing an arrogant,self-absorbed musician (wow what a stretch!) ""Sex In The City"" fans will get a hoot spotting the future 'Mr. Big', Chris Noth, in a (very) small part as a transvestite. ""Smithereens"" was undoubtedly a blueprint for Seidelman's next film, the much more slickly produced ""Desperately Seeking Susan"", which I would go so far as to call ""Smithereens"" with a higher budget! I am hoping that the release of this little ""skinny tie era"" gem means we will see ""Ladies And Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains"" and ""Starstruck"" available on DVD sometime before they put us in the home?!",1100822400,11,1328,4.959641255605381
664599,5,6303464572,"Besides capturing the gritty reality of New York City and eighties punk nihilism (unlike Times Square, which makes NYC seem like the innocuous Disneyland it now sadly is), Smithereens captures both the intimacy and estrangement of the punk experience to the jangling beat of such notables as the Feelies, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, and Television. Susan Berman delivers a stellar performance as a vulnerable, [angry], terminal misfit/victim/enfant terrible ambiguously coveting celebrity status and the affections of Richard Hell, who also shines as a punk icon and sexy-but-worthless cad. Fun, edgy and disturbing, with a harrowing conclusion and a heartfelt sympathy for its desperate characters. Includes Kitty, my fave cameo, as a sultry, manic-depressive downtown Bardot. If you weren't there, this film will make you feel like you were.",981849600,28,846,5.565891472868217
664600,5,6303464572,"This film is a classic! It has a raw street like feel to it, and a sense of urgency and desperation that runs rampant throughout the film. Susan Berman plays a pathetic groupie-type set out to become famous. She will step on anyone's toes and stab anyone's back and burn all her bridges along the way in order to achieve this goal. She meets a boy along the way willing to help her and love her and shelter her even though he hasn't got a pot to pee in himself. But she is hell bent on getting her way and in turn becomes a mean, self absorbed street weasel. She pushes away the people who love her most and ends up walking down that dreadful path of self destruction. Amazing to watch the transformation nonetheless, all set to early-eighties street rhythms and a pinch of the punk scene thrown in for good measure.",940118400,9,816,4.339869281045751
7848786,5,6303464572,"I lived in New York during this time, which is why I must revisit this film every so often. I especially love the scenes in the
Peppermint Lounge (The Pep, as we called it) although I'm glad I was never tossed out!
The film captures this era of the city and makes no apologies. All the characters make me homesick for those crazy times.",1514073600,,336,4.265625
7848787,2,6303464572,Poor video quality and characters / script are unbelievable. Would not recommend or watch again.,1507161600,,96,5.466666666666667
7848788,3,6303464572,"Okay, this movie isn't the greatest.  But to be fair the music ia iconic and a young Richard Hell is smoking hot.  I'd still buy it again.",1470614400,,138,4.074074074074074
7848789,3,6303464572,"I lived in New York City from 1980 to 2013, in Hell's Kitchen for 7 years and later for 22 years on the Lower East Side; this film accurately represents the gritty NYC Eighties.  Though frankly the pace and depressing atmosphere of ""Smithereens"" almost made me stop watching.  But I decided to keep going with it and I'm glad I did because the film, while not great, ends up having some redeeming value.  I identify with the struggles of Wren [Susan Berman] as I went through experiences similar to hers -- Surrounded by garbage and living in filth in the dilapidated NYC apartments of that time run by slumlords; frequenting the punk / post-punk scene i.e. waiting outside the door to get into the overrated Mudd Club, getting locked out of apartments, being broke all the time, being 3 months behind in the rent and having shady hustler friends.  New York was mean back then!  And as much as everyone, including myself, pines for the good old days when NYC was still funky and non-gentrified, if I had to relive those days in Manhattan in the 1980s -- I wouldn't.

I agree with some other Amazon reviewers of this film that the performances are lackluster.  Still, Susan Berman (whose seems to have disappeared after ""Smithereens"") as Wren was well-cast; she typifies the kind of hanger on one would encounter in places like The Peppermint Lounge (which is featured in this movie).  I've never listened to Richard Hell's (Eric) music, but I found him to be credible in his role.  The score is great and the best thing about this film; the movie could have used more music.  If a soundtrack for ""Smithereens' were to become available, I'd definitely buy it.  In Closing: the desperation of the lead character Wren gives this meandering movie its focus.  As for the quasi-European film-type ending, when things aren't looking good for Wren -- It's hard to say whether she'll make it.  That being said, she's a survivor and puts up a good fight, for someone who can't catch a break and appears to have neither advantages nor opportunities waiting for her on the horizon.

7848792,3,6303464572,"This review is for The Blue Underground version of the 1982 film, ""Smithereens""! I must admit that I had some high hopes for this film, considering it was directed by Susan Seidelman, who would go on to direct the 1985 film, ""Desperately Seeking Susan"". In addition, the film was the very 1st American Indy film to compete at The Cannes Film Festival. Susan Berman plays Wren, a self-promoting Jersey girl who is desperate to break into the downtown Manhattan music scene. The problem is that she really doesn't have much musical talent. The film also features Punk icon Richard Hell, who looks cool but really can't act. Brad Rinn plays Wren's boyfriend, who is an artist. The film is a time capsule of the early 80's East Village Punk scene. It was one of the very 1st Punk dramas. The problem is that Berman, Hell, and Rinn, really can't act as well, either. The best thing about the film is the film score by The Feelies, featuring Glenn Mercer and Bill Million. It's really just their great ""Crazy Rhythms"" LP, without their vocals. I really wanted to like this film more but the acting and script are just too downbeat and poor. The extras to the dvd are very good, however. They include an Audio Commentary with Director Seidelman, interviews with Susan Berman and Richard Hell a Theatrical trailer, and a Poster and Still Gallery. I enjoyed the extras more than the film itself. It is in Color, Widescreen, with a running time of 93 minutes. For fans of this type of early Indy NYC Punk films, I would bounce the rating up to 4 stars. The film transfer is pristine, and the Dolby Digital sound is Very Good!

7848793,5,6303464572,"I lived in the East Village in 1982, and this film captures the mixture of ambition, beauty and self destruction wrapped in black humor that permeated downtown New York in the early eighties.  I brilliant document of a time and place.",1445040000,2,234,4.7073170731707314
7848794,3,6303464572,"So I really dig Richard Hell and it was cool watching the movie now (never saw it before) to contrast the setting of dirty, gritty early 80s New York with the clean, gentrified New York of today. Dug all that. Young Richard Hell was as beautiful as ever. The plot was kinda dumb and the characters, totally unlikable. So see it if you are on a punk/new wave nostalgia trip like me. Otherwise, shine it on!",1438300800,3,405,4.342105263157895
