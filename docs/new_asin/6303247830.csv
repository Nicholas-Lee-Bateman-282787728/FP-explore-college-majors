606159,4,6303247830,"This is a 1987 film about a bored alcoholic and metally

disturbed houswife from South Carolina named Linda(Theresa

 Russell). She is trapped in a marriage to Henry(Christopher

Lloyed) who would rather play with his toy train hobby then make

love to her. Meanwhile Linda is haunted by flashbacks of her

teenage rape that produced a son and is disturbed by her regrets

of giving up her son for adoption. Ironically a man named Martin

(Gary Oldman)mysteriuolsy comes into her life & claims to be her

long lost son. However linda and her friend Arlanda(Collen Camp)

are the only one who can see Martin ???? The film is unlikable,

yet oddly facinating. The film also has a good casts, including

Sandra Bernhard.  The ending of the movie has remained with me

for years. This movie is not for mainstream buffs, as it is

strange, campy and frustrating all rolled into one. The film was

direceted by legendary filmaker Nicholas Roeg(Don't look Now,The

Witches), who is known for strange and perverse filmaking.

Although  this may not be one of Roegs best films, it is however

a thinkers film. Which is totally Roeg. Movie trivia alert.. The

film was produced by Beatle George Harrison ""Hand Made Film""

Company. This was also one of Roeg & ex wife Theresa Russell's

last known Colaboration before ""Cold Heaven"" in 1990.",1311552000,3,1329,4.834821428571429
606160,4,6303247830,"This meeting of writer Dennis Potter and filmmaker Nicolas Roeg is, as others have noted, nearly indescribable, surreal, outrageous, sometimes confusing but never boring.  I don't think it gives anything away to say that Gary Oldman's character is a hallucination conjured by Theresa Russell's character (this is made clear in a bar scene fairly early in the film), which for me accounts for much of his bizarre and over-the-top acting - he's not supposed to be a real character so why should he act like one? She has imagined him and everything he does so he can do whatever she wants - he is an extension of her.  There are some ways in which this film reminds me of Robert Altman's excellent and overlooked ""Images"" in that both films chart the emotional disintegration of the heroine and you are never sure in either film whether what you're seeing is real or not.  If you enjoy Roeg films like ""Bad Timing"" and ""Insignificance"" you may like ""Track 29"" as well.  If nothing else the film would be worth watching just for the glee on Sandra Bernhard's face as she spanks Christopher Lloyd's bare bottom with her rubber-gloved hands - she makes every film she's in something special.  Now we get to my real reason for writing this review, to caution people about this DVD.  This is my first experience with a made-to-order DVD and I'm not impressed.  It is merely a copy of a videotape, you can see the old tracking static in the bottom portion of the screen from time to time.  To say there are no special features is putting it lightly, there isn't even scene selection, which has become so ubiquitous that we don't notice it unless it is gone. Picture quality is bad as is sound, but it is watch-able and  it is the only way I have found to get this wonderful and unusual film on DVD, other than a $25 Danish version. So the DVD gets one star while the movie itself gets four stars; good, but not great Roeg.",1305331200,8,1913,4.521739130434782
606161,5,6303247830,"I was glad to have the chance to view this movie.  I regret that I had to get a VHS copy as that was the only type available and hope it will come to DVD soon.  This was an unusual story about a drifter who comes to town to find his mother and meets a lady that is a bored housewife with an unusual past.  I thought that considering the story and the character, Teresa Russell did a good job in her role.  Gary Oldman who is my favorite actor was excellent as Martin the drifter.  A lot of times he was over the top but not enough for the movie to not be enjoyable.  It was easy to see how he became the actor that we know of today.  This movie doesn't follow the standard Hollywood type of movie and plays more as an indendent film.  It is not for everyone but is very entertaining and a must see for any Gary Oldman fan.",1260576000,,822,3.9393939393939394

As always Roeg surprises us with his challenging handle camera and shot angles .

Terrific cast and a well elaborated script make of that bizarre story a very hard to watch movie .",1099353600,2,500,4.461538461538462
606164,3,6303247830,"Most people who watch this go away mumbling ""where was the plot"" it was there, buried, but there. I love this film. Then again, I'm a huge Oldman fan. This was one of his earlier performances and you can see the  actor that was to come. His portrayal of Martin, an alcoholic's fantasy  version of her long-lost son, is magnificent. He shifts from man to boy,  lover to child brilliantly. I wish I could praise his co-stars as highly.  Theresa Russell's stiff performance as the bored alcoholic housewife left  me cold and, for my money, Christopher Lloyd and Sandra Bernhard could have  been left out completely. The only reason to watch the film is Gary Oldman,  but his performance makes it worth watching again and again...just keep the  ffwd button close.

606165,2,6303247830,"...says the truck driver to Oldman, in one of the most oddlyquotable lines, in a film built upon scene after scene offrustratingly strange action.  Described as a black comedy, I don't remember laughing except in awe of its disregard for coherence . . . The climax scene is indescribable, and I'm not sure if it is weirder in or out of context.  It is fitting that the title is a random snippit, explaining nothing and then being less than trivial even after seeing it.  If you have an innate desire to see each starring male character's hindquarters, buy this film and enjoy it from the safety of your padded cell.",957052800,7,615,4.572727272727272
606166,2,6303247830,"I have only been able to sit through this film once. I picked it up because I saw that Gary Oldman was in it, but I couldn't make heads or tails of the characters or plot. Apparantly, there's an unhappily married  woman (Theresa Russell) who keeps fantasizing that the son she gave up for  adoption has come looking for her.  He appears in the form of Oldman, but  he acts like a bratty three year old, and the sequences involving him and  Russell are just too odd to explain.  And then there's her husband  (Christopher Lloyd), who has this weird fascination with trains and  masochism...but that's a different story.  The ending makes no sense, but  then, the whole movie makes no sense so I guess it doesn't matter.",944697600,4,718,4.5390625

Gary's baby-face pretty/Teresa is visually stunning in turquoise Lycra exercise tights & although young I've never seen any purpose of C. Lloyd being in the world of film.

Heads up Sports Fans:  we've got Gary Oldman hitch-hiking in a knit cap w/braids under a cowboy hat screaming ""Mother"" at possible rides & Leon Rippy as the truck driver who picks him up...aka the angel who ""Saved Grace"" aka the detective in ""Midnight In The Garden"".

7841717,4,6303247830,"With the well-deserved Best Actor Oscar attention Gary Oldman is getting for TINKER TAILER SOLDIER SPY, it's fun to take a look at this forgotten 1987 Nicholas Roeg film that showcases his immersive acting style.  Oldman plays a character that may or may not exist in reality but is almost a demonic force in the mad mind of Theresa Russell.  This twisted, frustrating and weirdly mesmerizing story about a woman caught in a sexless. Cold marriage to a preoccupied, miniature train-loving doctor (Christopher Lloyd) who fantasizes about the son she gave away after being raped as a teen.  Or is Oldman's drifter a monster who takes advantage of a crazy, vulnerable woman?  Or is he the seducer of his own mother?  No matter what the reality, it's hard to take your eyes off Oldman in one of his more galvanizing early roles that has been compared to his work in SID AND NANCY.  Some critics hated this picture as hopelessly ambiguous, but that's the whole point of it all.  Dennis Potter wrote the screenplay.",1332979200,,1009,4.764367816091954
7841718,5,6303247830,"Watching this film was a requirement for a class that I am taking on pschoanalysis and film.  Not sure how I have missed viewing any of Nicolas Roeg's films until now, but I plan on seeing all of them.

Track 29 was such a great film, Gary Oldman was superb, as always!  Filled with laughter, suspense and lots of subtle detail, this film is worth watching at least twice to make sure that nothing has been missed the first time.  All the more reason for those who are confused by it to give it another go.

Christopher Lloyd was perfectly cast in his role as Henry, the 'daddy' figure 50ish spouse who is more interested in his train fetish than his beautiful, young wife.  Theresa Russell as Linda, the 30-something wife is a neurotic alcoholic who yearns to bear another child after being forced to give up one when she was in her mid-teens.  Sandra Bernhardt has a fairly minor, but meaningful role.

Gary Oldman plays his part with such gusto, perfection, and perfect timing, vascillating from sane, to crazy to childlike, switching personalities at the drop of a hat.  It is evident from watching him portray Martin, Linda's son that he would have quite an acting future ahead of him.  A must for anyone who is a Gary Oldman fan.

I rented this film online using Amazon Instant Video and viewed it using my old Power Mac without any problems.",1332633600,,1348,4.551867219917012
