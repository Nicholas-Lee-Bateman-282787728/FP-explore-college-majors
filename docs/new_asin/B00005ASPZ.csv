8095459,5,B00005ASPZ,"My son loved all of the Bibleman videos until he was ten years old.  He provides a great substitute for other more violent hero types.  In this video, a young boy is dealing with anger.  Bibleman is able to stop him before he gets into a fight.  My son was dealing with anger when we bought this video.  The Bible promises that God's word will not come back void.  God's word presented by Bibleman really got my son's attention. It helped start some anger management lessons.  Thanks, Bibleman.",1310774400,,494,4.545454545454546
