7958868,5,B000063BLK,Wonderful insight into how food was produced.  Just wish the formats were universal - had to purchase a dvd player that would read it.  Would be interested in more BBC productions.,1500681600,,180,4.774193548387097
7958869,5,B000063BLK,"This is one of the all time best garden programs we have ever seen. Too bad it has never been promoted in the USA. PBS where are you??? The discs were not for our region. However, my laptop did play them and we used Chromecast to throw it up on our TV screen. So - it can be watched in the USA with a little luck and ingenuity. I have now ordered the other 2 series that were part of this original project.",1487721600,,406,3.9036144578313254
7958870,3,B000063BLK,"For those who don't know the series (as I didn't), this is from a 1987 TV series.  The DVD was made in 2006 but there doesn't appear to be many changes to the original.  Not really a how-to instructional, more a reality TV look at the past in a (very) small section of an old English manor garden.",1477612800,,297,4.103448275862069

7958872,5,B000063BLK,"I have watched parts of this show on You Tube, but to view the episodes in it's entirety this is a  must have. If you own  a Sony Vaio it will play region 2 DVD. That is if you don't already own a DVD player that plays all regions. It doesn't work on a Dell or Hewlett Packard, but I am not sure about Macs.",1413590400,5,307,3.707692307692308
7958873,5,B000063BLK,"One of the loveliest and informative series you can watch.  From the fascinating history of how the Victorian's used their gardens to the fabulous soundtrack and narration, this is a series to delight the soul.  Highly recommend it to anyone wanting an escape from today's fast and furious culture.",1412726400,7,298,5.061224489795919
