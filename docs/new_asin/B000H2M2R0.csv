2625863,5,B000H2M2R0,"There's a lot of complaints about this DVD set containing various South Park episodes, and they are all correct in their criticisims, but for those who don't own any of the single season sets and just want a compilation of great episodes, this is worth picking up.  The Hits: Vol. 1 features ten episodes that creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone compiled, along with four bonus episodes and the infamous short ""The Spirit of Christmas"", which in itself is worth checking this out for (if you haven't already seen it on the internet that is).  Some of the best, recent episodes of the series are here; including the Paris Hilton bashing ""Stupid Spoiled Whole Video Playset"", ""The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers"", ""Good Times With Weapons"", ""Red Hot Catholic Love"", and ""Scott Tenorman Must Die"", as well as ""Best Friends Forever"" and the controversey causing ""Trapped in the Closet"" which aren't available on DVD yet.  The bonus episodes are a blast too, including the fittingly titled ""It Hits the Fan"", the debut of Timmy in ""Timmy 2000"", ""Death Camp of Tolerance"", and the hilarious ""Fat Butt and Pancake Head"".  There's commentaries by Matt and Trey too, but everything on these discs is nothing that hasn't been seen before.  As I said before, the Hits: Vol. 1 is worth picking up if you just want an assortment of great episodes and don't want to lay down the cash for the single season sets, but for those who do own seasons of the series, this can be left on the shelf.",1162080000,44,1500,4.645283018867924
2625864,2,B000H2M2R0,"I will admit that many of the episodes chosen for this top ten DVD are excellent, although some of them are questionable for the top ten. I can think of a myriad of episodes that are way better than Red Hot Catholic Love and I didn't even care for the much overrated Trapped in the Closet, which seems as if it was only put on here because it raised a lot of controversy; it was probably for that same reason that it was nominated for an emmy despite Cartoon Wars (the two-parter that should have been nominated) being far funnier and having a stronger message.

One of the advantages of owning this DVD is that you'll get Best Friends Forever and Trapped in the Closet a little earlier than if you were to just wait for Season 9 to come out, and as I said before, the latter episode isn't that great anyway. The other advantage is that you'll get the Spirit of Christmas short that started the whole South Park phenomenon, although it's easy to find online (just check YouTube). Everything else on this DVD is already available on the previously released seasons.

One thing that bothers me is the neglect of the older seasons, which might be tame by today's standards and dealt less with political matters, but there are myriads of very good episodes in those seasons. Nothing from the first four seasons is on this set except for Timmy 2000 from Season 4, which is merely included as a bonus episode and is not part of Matt and Trey's top ten.

In conclusion, this would be an okay set to own if you're only somewhat of a fan of South Park and just want a nice little collection of episodes but don't feel like dishing out the money to buy all the different seasons. As a hardcore fan, however, I see no reason to own this set as I already own the first eight seasons and will own all future seasons as well. I find this DVD pointless and would have liked it better had Season 9 been released in its place.",1161475200,3,1909,4.356741573033708
2625865,2,B000H2M2R0,First they put out all of these tapes and dvds with scattered episodes with no rhyme or reason. Then they finally get it right and start doing it season by season.  Now they are going back to the smattering of various episodes with the chance to own the gay Tom Cruise episode earlier and the pilot. I have to agree with the critics on here... I am a fan but I think it's time for them to start releasing the seasons faster rather than give us these redundant compilations.,1160092800,9,473,4.314606741573034
2625866,5,B000H2M2R0,"Ive watched South Park since it first began. I think the newer seasons like 6-9 are much better then the previous seasons. This set might be a money making scam, but I don't own any seasons of South Park. All the epsiodes on this dvd set is from season four and on (sorry fans if im wrong about this, im sure you'll correct me) and Im sure more fans will point this out in futher reviews. The only problem I had with the set is why is the curse words still edited out? I don't see the point of releasing a set on dvd if its edited. All in all, a great set with a few epsiodes that I enjoy missing. A great buy if your a causal fan of the show, not a die hard fan.",1159920000,8,663,3.846715328467153
2625867,2,B000H2M2R0,"This release is just to milk the series and make more $$ for Matt and Trey and of course Comedy Central.

The hardcore South Park fan already owns seasons 1-8 and there is no point of buying this (except for the Spirit of Xmas pilot) because eventually there will be Season 9, 10, 11 etc on DVD.

Why couldn't Matt and Trey release the ""Spirit of Xmas"" pilot on ANY of the previous box sets? because they just want the money from South Park fans like me who want to have it all. Period.

Good box set for new South Park fans but for the rest of us, this is just a basic example of re-selling episodes for money.",1159833600,7,611,4.117647058823529

This process cuts off a lot of imagery from the sides of the screen and is very noticeable. It also cuts out certain scenes that were removed when the episodes air in the syndicated timeslots.

2625870,3,B000H2M2R0,"I got this 2-DVD set of greatest hit of the South Park series, but found that on each disk, I could only successfully play the first episode and maybe part of the way into the second episode before the DVD player would freeze and refuse to play further.

I contacted the seller, who advised that the item was factory sealed and had not been used or damaged before sale.

After resolving the purchase with the seller and Amazon, I was left with a non-playing set of DVDs (but my money refunded). I was about to throw the DVDs away and order a new set, but decided to Google the problem (I agreed with the seller that the DVDs appeared to NOT have been actually damaged, and were instead defective from the factory, and I did not want to order a replacement only to find that it was also mis-manufactured in the same way). Sure enough, I found LOTS of complaints about this specific DVD set.

All complaints matched mine, in that the playing surface of the DVDs seemed to have a cloudy finish that the DVD player's laser could not read through properly. The cloudy finish was not present near the center hub of the DVDs, and since DVDs (like audio CDs) play from the center outwards, this explains why the first episode on each DVD played correctly.

Most complaints that I found described the same cloudy surface, and the troubles that the customers had in getting the problem resolved. But a few people mentioned that the cloudy finish seemed to actually be a thin plastic or paint/varnish coating, almost as if they had been sprayed with something, and that isopropyl alcohol was effective in dissolving it.

I obtained some technical cleaning wipes that can be used to clean optics without scratching (I suppose those micro-fiber cloths sold for cleaning plastic eyeglass lenses would also work). I applied the alcohol to the cloudy side of the DVDs and wiped firmly for about 30 seconds (always wipe optical disks from the center out, NOT in a circular pattern UNLESS you are making small overlapping circles as if doing a polishing operation). After the alcohol dried, it was obvious that the coating was now smeared but not at all removed. It ended up taking me a few repeated operations, each time with a new wipe cloth and fresh alcohol, before it seemed that only a few thin residue streaks remained. I removed those using lukewarm water and dish soap, and gently blotted the DVDs dry (by the way, I had initially tried using just the soap and water without the alcohol, but that did not work). After this laborious treatment, both DVDs played perfectly.

By the way, although it is not apparent to the eye, it seems that the label side of the DVDs also have this cloudy coating (on top of the silkscreen label), and while this does not affect playability, it did impart a slight sticky aspect to the top of the disks, so I cleaned that side as well. Not that the alcohol slightly damages the silkscreen label in the process, but it still looks pretty good.

This is apparently all due to some sort of problem at the DVD manufacturing facility. Just be aware that if you buy this item, you might also find it unplayable unless you take similar steps to remove the coating. Hopefully newer ones will not have this same problem.

Caveat: DVDs and CDs are made in a laminate of a plastic disk, a metal reflective layer, and a clear varnish top coat. Recordable DVDs and CDs also have a dye layer on top of the metalized layer. Using alcohol on recordable optical disks is generally not advised because the alcohol acts as a solvent on the dye, possibly ruining the disk. When necessary, the alcohol should only be applied to the bottom (non-label) side of the disk, as this is the thick plastic layer and it is impervious to the solvent. If you apply even a small amount of alcohol to the top/label side of a disk, it can soak through the varnish and get into the inside layers of the disk. This is not good treatment for a factory 'pressed' disk, and it can be ruinous for a recordable disk. In this case, since the South Park DVDs are commercially pressed and not recordable, I felt safe using the alcohol on both sides of the disk. Still, be aware that excessively applied alcohol can damage the disks; don't soak them with it!",1402358400,3,4235,4.563157894736842

ASA I opened the Fedex package I realized that this was something totally different than I thought but it was when opened the box that i realized it was certainly not worth the money I payed.
First of all it is imported, and there is all over more Japanese than English...this obviously didn't make it easy for me to understand what season and which episodes are on each DVD. The quality of the DVD used is visibly poor and the way everything is presented inside (a whole bunch of DVDs individually wrapped in some kind of plastic sleeves)is really unprofessional.

ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICES
I asked to return the ""collection""the morning after i received it but I've been told that i couldn't because I opened the plastic that was sealing the box. But  how would I have ever been able to realize the quality of the DVDs inside without opening the box???

2625887,5,B000H2M2R0,"When SOUTH PARK first hit the airwaves a decade ago, I had no desire to watch the show.  At the time, from those I talked to the show just didn't sound like something I would enjoy.  Over time my tastes have changed a bit and after having heard a few months ago about a lesson taught about the educational benefits of SOUTH PARK, I decided to watch an episode on television.  I watched one and I was hooked.  I wanted to become more acquainted with the series without yet buying a complete season and therefore was able to get my hands on this DVD collection, SOUTH PARK--THE HITS:  VOLUME 1.

For those who are already familiar with the show, this DVD collection is will probably be redundant because all of the episodes in this set are now available in each one of the season's collections.  The only reason a serious fan might be interested in owning this set is that it includes the short ""The Spirit of Christmas"" which started the series.  That short pilot is available on the Internet, but if I'm not mistaken this is the first time it's available on DVD.  That short has Jesus and Santa Clause fighting each other over who will control Christmas.

Though this DVD collection probably won't hold much appeal for series fans, it is a great collection to introduce someone to the series.  There are ten episodes selected by Matt Stone and Trey Parker.  Each of these episodes includes a brief commentary by Stone and Parker.  In addition, there are four bonus episodes and ""The Spirit of Christmas"" short.  As Stone and Parker point out on the commentary to ""Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset"" they had a difficult time coming up with ten episodes that were their ""favorites"" because they tend to view the newest episode as being their favorite one.  However, the collection does include at least three episodes that seem to be their favorites as well as some episodes that were landmark episodes in the series.

My favorites in the collection include:

""The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers""--Cartman, Kyle, Stan, are sent to take a video from Stan's parents to Butter's parents.  The video is supposed to be ""The Lord of the Rings"" but turns out to be a very hot, and in some states illegal, adult tape.  Cartman, Kyle, and Stan do not know this.  But everywhere they go people start freaking out when they come in contact with the tape.  So, they leave on an epic journey to return to the tape to the video store two towns away.  This episode is both a great homage to ""The Lord of the Rings"" as well as just being a show about the kids just being kids (with a little bit of twisted humor thrown in).

""Best Friends Forever""--Kenny is one of the few lucky kids in South Park to get a PSP when they first arrive in stores.  He finally finds something he is good at when he begins playing a war game called, ""Heaven Vs. Hell"".  Kenny reaches level 60, the highest level in the game.  While celebrating, he is killed.  It turns out the Satan is planning on invading Heaven.  God has a plan though and created PSP and used the game ""Heaven Vs. Hell"" as a way to find a person who would be able to lead the armies of Heaven versus Satan's forces (THE LAST STARFIGHTER anyone?).  Kenny is that person, but just as the battle is about to begin, Kenny disappears.  Even though he is mentally a vegetable, his body is being kept alive through machines.  Cartman wants Kenny to die so that he can get his PSP, but Kyle and Stan think that's just wrong.  Cartman thinks he has the power to pull the plug because he and Kenny were BFF's.  Thus, a huge national legal battle drenched in media coverage begins.  This episode won an Emmy.

""Good Times With Weapons""--Cartman, Kyle, Stan, and Kenny purchase real ninja weapons at a local carnival.  They pretend to be ninjas, get in a fight with Butters, and end up going on a journey to return the weapons so they won't get in trouble.  The anime style of animation when the kids imagine themselves as ninja warriors is great and the theme song from this episode, ""Let's Fighting Love"" is a great parody of Japanese pop music.

""Casa Bonita""--Kyle is having a birthday party at the best Mexican restaurant in the world, Casa Bonita.  The place has great food, cliff divers, Blackbeard's cave, and a place where you can get your photo taken as an outlaw in jail.  Stan and Kenny are invited, but Cartman isn't.  Kyle can only invite three people and since Butters invited him to his birthday party, he's just returning the favor.  Cartman is furious, but cooks up an unbelievable scheme to get Butters out of the way just so he can go in his place.

""Trapped in the Closet""--this is the episode that has probably received more attention than any other in the South Park collection.  The show has Stan joining the Church of Scientology.  The people in the church believe Stan is the reincarnation of Ron L. Hubbard.  The media surrounds Stan's house and Tom Cruise, John Travolta, and R. Kelly end up living in Stan's closet because Stan doesn't like TomCruise's acting very much.  Paramount had the episode pulled from syndication before the release of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE III.  The episode is hilarious, but isn't that different from many other SOUTH PARK episodes.  If it wasn't for the controversy surrounding it, it probably wouldn't be a part of this collection.

""Scott Tenorman Must Die""--Cartman has a trick played on him by an older student, Scott Tenorman.  Cartman attempts several times to get revenge, but is embarrassed further each time by Tenorman.  Stan and Kyle tell him over and over to just let it go, but he can't.  He then sets into motion a plan for revenge reminiscent of something from TITUS ANDRONICUS.

Overall, SOUTH PARK THE HITS: VOLUME 1 is a collection that major fans of the series will find redundant, but is a great set of episodes to introduce someone to the series.",1179100800,10,5866,4.584053794428434

2625893,4,B000H2M2R0,"I love all these episodes an if you don't have the money to own every season, I strongly recommend getting this. I love the episode where Tom Cruise goes in Stan's closet and won't leave since Stan insulted his movies. Then we get that line ""Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet"" lol. I wish he would too so I'd have a chance with Katie lol. You also have tons of other brilliant jokes from this season. I love the Paris Hilton episode where he insists on owning Butter's and making him her new pet. Well since all her dog's...committ suicide.

  You also get Cartman disguised as a robot to trick Butters. But the joke has to get dragged on when he discovers Butters has a tape of him dressed like Britney Spears kissing a Justin Timberlake cardboard stand-up. So he has to find out where that tape is. The dvd also includes one of the most twisted episodes ever. Where Cartman is feuding with an older kid who...tricked Cartman into buying his pubes. That's one of my favorites due to the pretty insane ending. However I might have to call the Lord of the Rings episode my favorite. Since it shows how kids are innocent until...they see porn. I love how Butters accidently sees a porno when he's supposed to be watching the Lord of the Rings. Which leads him following it back to the video store saying ""my precious...my precious"". Jimmy also has an hilarious Gandalf scene where he's trying to say ""you shall not pass!"". Since he studders he never really gets that out though.",1167955200,,1482,4.5018587360594795

2625895,5,B000H2M2R0,"As I sit back and watch some of this anti-politically correct subject matter, all I can say to myself is Thank God for Matt Stone and Trey Parker. Their work with South Park is far more important than that produced by all the non-conformist social and cultural commentators in the world because they influence people in general--even those who despise reading. They place PC in its proper perspective by ridiculing its mumbo-jumbo constantly. These episodes are so witty that they could even be confused with the skits of Graham Chapman and John Cleese. I do agree though that the best practice is to purchase the yearly boxed sets as this installment has far too few episodes to properly do justice to the greatest television show ever made. Anyway, if you're unfamiliar with South Park, I truly envy you. I wish that I could see some of these episodes again for the first time.",1167696000,2,879,4.751633986928105
2625896,4,B000H2M2R0,"This set, like any hits compilation, is subject to scrutiny.  Like many fans have stated, if you own the season sets, it's a dent in the pocket for a handful of things you don't already own.  For fans who don't shell out for the seasons, but have really liked some of their recent episodes, this is a deal for less than 20 bucks and having 14 episodes.

Of course there's almost no denying this was released because of the hoopla around ""Trapped in the Closet"" and South Park scoring its best ratings since it started.  This collection also highlights something the creators note in their brief commentary: many of the episodes on here are recent.  Matt and Trey like to feel they're getting better and their selection reflect their feelings and pretty much how I know I feel about the show as of late: that it has gotten better.

As for the selection of episodes:  I think it's pretty good.  There are few South Parks that I don't like, so any collection would do.  I was pleased that they included the infamous Scott Tenorman Must Die and the Death Camp of Tolerance (and that one's a bonus ep), as those were two of MY faves.  I don't think there's any episode included here that isn't good.  Given, Trey and Matt don't go back really far into the early seasons into the ""classic"" episodes, but that's okay.  This selection shows how good South Park has become and also reflects how topical South Park can be.

Overall, it's a good collection and a steal for casual fans.  If you've been buying the boxed sets and don't want to drop too much money, I'd stick with the season sets.  But don't knock this one - it's still pretty good, even if it does merely serve casual fans.",1164326400,11,1677,4.470394736842105
2625897,2,B000H2M2R0,"I loved just about every episode on this set it felt like it really did encompass whaty make south park great. of cource i felt trapped in the closet was only here because of the brew-haha it created. i would have liked to see the earlier seasons honored.

biggest gripe would have to be the commentaries they were 4-5 mins they felt really tacked on and i know ive heard that Trey and Matt hate doing commentaries but it felt like they really phoned these in just so they could brag that all the episodes have commentaries. i have heard that doing commentaries for animation can be hard as there really is no mishaps on set or ad libs but you can talk more about the concept and how it became an episode rather then ""this is a great episode because cart does something evil hehe well on to the next episode""

they actually said that on some of the commentaries ""well on to the next one""",1162339200,,887,4.3053892215568865

We've taken every grandchild to Casa Bonita for his or her birthday because it is exactly as bizarre and cool as the South Park episode portrays. This is an excellent handy emergency collection.",1522368000,2,311,4.271186440677966

8136029,1,B000H2M2R0,"This disc set is damaged and doesn't play in the dvd player, on the computer, or on any device. Worse, apparently since I have been going through a comedy of errors with printers and labels and ink with Amazon, now that I finally have a working printer and ink and labels, my accounts history says the return window for this product, which is nonfunctional, is past its return date. What's the window these days? I haven't had this thing a month, I don't think.

Tragedy for me. Oh well. Out money for a disk set that won't play. NOT happy.",1486771200,,540,4.4

Most of the movie worked but it came in with an oily substance on the discs and they only worked for some of the episodes. I was disappointed, but I bought off a cheaper seller rather than Amazon itself. Other then that, the episodes were funny and all together it was a great buy!",1463875200,,346,4.17910447761194

However, when we opened the box to put in the dvd, we found that both discs were covered in a sticky film that made them unreadable. We tried to clean them, but they still skip and freeze. Had these been used, I could understand something like this but it came wrapped and sealed. I've never had an issue before so I'm really upset that this happened. I'd return it but he already threw out the return form.",1451347200,,513,4.244897959183674
