4504407,5,B004Z1HY5E,"The Clinic is a smart film in the slasher sub genre.
It's not a gore fest but it has it's moments,there are a few surprises nothing revolutionary but clever none the less. I found it to be extremely well acted and orchestrated.

There is a purpose to all the madness but you will have to see this for yourself. It's a mad search for the women to find out which baby is there's when they wake up in a tub filled with ice after a C section is performed and the babies are stolen and placed in cages. Meanwhile someone or something is watching all of this on TV monitors.

It takes place circa 1978 before there was DNA
testing so there's only one thing that distinguishes which baby is who's and some are willing to kill to find out. Mix in a touch of saw and a bit of Inside and a lot of creativity and you have a gem of a movie.

There is nothing as dangerous as a woman protecting her young....Lot's of action lot's of heart and some genuinely scary moments.",1313366400,15,959,4.172972972972973
4504408,2,B004Z1HY5E,"A **must see** if you like Tabrett Bethell (Legend of the Seeker).
Oh and Clare Bowen (Nashville TV show) is in it too using her real voice.

Overall the acting was fine, the story just didn't grab me, not much horror.  At 1:17 in, they could have ended it and nobody would have noticed. What happens after that is really the most interesting part to me.

It wasn't BAD, but I don't feel better for watching this movie and didn't find it very entertaining. Can't really say more without disclosing the plot.",1430870400,,507,4.489130434782608
4504409,4,B004Z1HY5E,"The storyline goes smoothly...a logical horror movie.
If you like similar stuff as Triangle, then you should try this one.

4504416,5,B004Z1HY5E,"this movie is pretty good, super creepy, and sad that the guy dies, (main character from spartacus season one, bought this movie after finding out the actor passed away in real life from cancer :( so sad, such a good actor!). but the movie is pretty good.",1396656000,,255,4.446808510638298
4504417,3,B004Z1HY5E,"I only got this because Andy Whitfield is in this movie.  Andy Whitfield was the original Spartacus but died of cancer when the first season was over. Now Spartacus is on dvd, so that's a better buy.",1393977600,,199,4.378378378378378
4504418,3,B004Z1HY5E,I selected this movie because I wanted to see more of Andy Whifield's work.  Script was lacking and he had very little dialogue,1393718400,,127,4.521739130434782
4504419,3,B004Z1HY5E,"The Clinic (2010) is an Australian suspense thriller that doesn't quite hold together, but some original elements and odd plot twists, help to make it a little more memorable, among the many entries in the horror and suspense genres.  Some spoilers follow.

The story is set in the year 1979, some six years before DNA testing became common.  Cameron (Andy Whitfield) and his pregnant girlfriend Beth (Tabrett Bethell) are travelling cross country, and stop at a motel for the night, where Beth is abducted, and awakes naked in a bathtub, with her baby surgically removed.  Beth discovers that she is at a livestock facility (there is no actual clinic), trapped with a group of women, who have also recently had their babies stolen in a similar fashion.  The new mothers determine that another mother is in hiding, and is killing members of their group, in an attempt to discover the identity of her baby.

The Clinic tosses a few curve balls, as what starts out as abduction, turns into an examination of maternal motivations, and a test of survival.  The level suspense and gore increases, as a twisted master plan unfolds, featuring some tense moments, including one with attacking dogs.

Although very physically active, the women somehow manage not to tear open their recently sutured abdomens.  There's not a lot of logic involved in what happens, but if you can ignore some rather large plot holes, the story is fairly engaging.  A really crucial turning point occurs, when the mothers discover six infants trapped inside wire framed cribs, but instead of staying with them, they decide to leave them, in order to try and determine which child belong to what mother.  Even in the pre-DNA era, this is a questionable act that few real mothers would probably consider.

The Clinic is an uneven thriller with an overdramatic conclusion, which mixes some standard horror clichs, with a number of unexpected developments.  With some scary moments and decent acting, this 3.5 star effort is worth a watch for horror buffs, but with too many pieces that conveniently fall into place, the movie just doesn't quite reach its potential.",1392508800,,2133,4.957865168539326
4504420,5,B004Z1HY5E,This dvd is in great condition thank you I just got it today thank you and I appreciate this I will probably buy more soon,1380672000,,122,3.92
4504421,3,B004Z1HY5E,Had potential but too many slow scenes. Plot development good. Plot execution not so good. First half OK. Felt obligated to finished the second half.,1378857600,,149,5.0
4504422,4,B004Z1HY5E,This movie is really kind of creepy in some spots & more eerie in others when you're not paying attention.,1373760000,,106,4.35
4504423,1,B004Z1HY5E,"I bought this because it had the late Andy Whitfield in it.  Well, he's barely in it, although they use his name to advertise the video quite prominently.
The story is gruesome, and barely makes sense.  Don't waste your time.",1365033600,,225,4.6
4504424,5,B004Z1HY5E,I would recommend this to everyone. I cannot believe it. It is a sad movie that shows the cruelty in some people trying to make a buck.,1360540800,,135,4.037037037037037
4504425,4,B004Z1HY5E,I bought this movie mainly because it had an actor in it whom I have enjoyed his other films. Was pleasantly surprised.,1355356800,,119,4.454545454545454
4504426,3,B004Z1HY5E,"Ok while I find this movie mildly entertaining, the fact that it could even be loosely based on something real is quite scary. That being said, I think the movie missed a key compenent in the end.  **SPOLIER ALERT**  While it is great that Beth was able to get her baby back, what happened to the other 5 babies?  Were they placed in foster care, were they reunited with the fathers, were they left to die?  Seems like such a far fetched idea to pit 6 women against each other to see who is the strongest therefore knowing which baby would probably have the best genes.  What a morbid way of picking out a baby to adopt!!!!  And why only tell one of the six women the truth?  How is that a fair fight to determine who is the best woman?  Even more disturbing then not knowing what happens to the 5 babies, Beth was number 608, so if only 1/6 babies get selected, what happened to all those other babies over the years?  I hate that this movie left that an open question to ponder.",1346889600,,980,4.225806451612903
4504427,2,B004Z1HY5E,It was not one of the top ten on my husbands list. It was slow & didn't have that scary or gory storyline that most people who buy these movies like. I wouldnt recommend it at all.,1341964800,,180,3.891891891891892
4504428,3,B004Z1HY5E,It wasn't exactly what I had expected but it was good movie. I love Tabrett so the movie was entertaining to me.,1340236800,,112,4.136363636363637
4504429,1,B004Z1HY5E,"I watched the entire movie which was a waste.  I rented it because of Andy.  It is a shame that he lost his life before he had a chance to bring his talent to the world.  He will be always be remembered for Spartacus first season.  If you haven't seen that, it is worth watching unlike this.  He wasn't in the movie long enough to find one thing worth watching about it.",1336348800,,370,4.083333333333333
4504430,2,B004Z1HY5E,"I bought this movie because of Andy Whitfield AKA Spartacus.  Also, I'm not too hard to please when it comes to low budget horror movies.  But I have to say, this movie was just boring.  I actually didn't finish it, which is unheard of for me to not even finish a movie.  I'll probably go back and watch the end one of these days.  The movie is so unrealistic in so many ways.  They could at least try to make it believable.  Just one example, the girl who was pregnant had her baby removed, and she awakes with a tight flat stomach not to mention unsightly implants.  Didnt look like a girl who was 9 months pregnant 1 hour ago.  Hard to buy into the storyline of a movie when they didn't even attempt to make the situations realistic.  Another example, when the 5 girls were walking around (the completely empty) facility, they all had the exact same little blood stain on the front of their shirts.  Can they at least try to vary the blood stain?  Seems like no thought was put into the details here.  And what is this, some kind of reality show, the way the girls are allowed to walk around this facility freely, killing eachother and doing whatever they want, while some men are in a room somewhere just watching it all on monitors?  But I can look past all that in a low budget horror movie; my main problem here was just that it was so boring.  Watching these girls walk around the faciltiy with not much action or even suspense.  Matter-of-fact, I think I need to finish watching it just to see if Andy Whitfield is going to come to the rescue or what.  But my main point here, this is a boring movie.  Might be the only time I've ever watched 2/3 of a movie, took it out, and put something else in out of pure boredom.",1334361600,,1727,4.2615384615384615
4504431,1,B004Z1HY5E,"So these women wake up in a tub of ice, slits in their stomachs....babies removed.  they all wake up and start running around this huge abandoned factory that is fenced in.  They cant climb this fence or dig under it, yet wild dogs hang out in this desolate area of course.  One of them is stalking the others, trying to rip out the bands in their stomachs...you see, this is what indicates whose baby is whose. Why she doesnt think to ask the other women instead of killing them, is beyond me.  Ohhh...and in 1978, early 20 year old pregnant girl have fake breasts, of course!  I was kinda hoping to see lactating marks on their gowns to highlight the blood slits.  Yeah....and the main actor (stud) simply dies from a flat tire....useless.  The ""twist"" at the ending attempted to make this a decent movie, but the horrible acting and completely awful plot destroyed this movie, putting it in my Top 10 worst horror movies of all time.  One good thing...the main actress is really hot!",1334016000,,986,4.5625
4504432,4,B004Z1HY5E,"This movie took me by surprise.  I thought it would be a slasher movie and even tho there are bloody scenes (not many), there was an actual plot to the movie.  You have to wait till the end to find out tho.  I may just watch it again!",1333497600,3,234,3.8333333333333335
4504433,3,B004Z1HY5E,"I bought this after my daughter kept asking about it,,,I own over 700 dvds & I'm not upset that I bought it. It wasn't what I was expecting the most disturbing thing about it is when I found out its based on true events. Not alot of action but not real boring I always hate when reviews give the movie away so I never tell about the movie but the ending was a surprise. Not a lot of scares or gore but not a bad movie either.",1328572800,3,425,3.896551724137931
4504434,2,B004Z1HY5E,"THE CLINIC is basically an unpleasant ""thriller"" focusing on a pregnant woman who finds herself battling a woman who sells babies on the black market.  But her methods are quite nasty, involving a game of murder and competition.
While the script tries for an inventive approach, it still manages to utilize many of the standard cliches:  the sleazy motel manager, the corrupt redneck sheriff, the 40ish spinster villain, the retarded son, etc.
Tabrett Bethell does a good job as Beth but the late Andy Whitfield as her fiance Cameron, who plays a pivotal role in the first half of the movie, is suddenly removed from the film in an unsatisfying manner.
THE CLINIC is set in 1979 for some inexplicable reason purportedly something to do with pre-DNA testing.  Ultimately, it's merely an unpleasant film with little redeeming qualities.",1326412800,,834,5.028985507246377
4504435,5,B004Z1HY5E,"The Clinic Movie was great, a bit scary in some places.  We purchased this movie as Andy Whitfield was one of the actors in the movie.  A great actor who passed away far to young. The sellers provided fast deliverly.  I would recommend the seller and purchase from them again.",1326326400,,276,4.48
4504436,5,B004Z1HY5E,"The Clinic is a REALLY disturbing horror film.  Yes it falls under the category of ""torture, rape and physical and mental abuse"" similar to the Hills Have Eyes, but even *worse* on an emotional level.

It's about a man/father and his pregnant girlfriend/wife who spend the night at a hotel, and upon the man momentarily leaving his hotel room and coming back, he discovers his girlfriend is missing without a trace, so he goes around the small town asking people concerning her whereabouts.  It turns out he asks the wrong people and makes trouble with the law enforcement.  However...

Where his girlfriend/wife ends up is the WORST place imaginable.  She wakes up in an ice-soaked bathtub at what appears to be a rundown and secluded abortion clinic and she's alone, cold and frightened.  We soon realize that... uh this is hard to write... that her baby was ripped out of her stomach and stolen.

Eventually -without spoiling much more about this surprisingly enticing storyline- the woman meets 3 other women who've also had their babies stolen and looking for some answers/revenge.  From here, it's a mad quest for the mothers to retrieve their babies and find out what happened to them, and who's responsible.

An interesting element is that the man/father doesn't play much of a role at all after the beginning 30 minutes, which I honestly did NOT see coming.  The best part without a *doubt* is the REALLY intense ending.  Talk about loads of heavy and emotionally unbearable atmosphere!  Everything will make sense by that point.

Besides this, I'd just like to point out that Tabrett Bethell has a REALLY beautiful face.  She's honestly someone I now have a crush on thanks to her appearance and performance in this film.

A must watch movie for the more graphic-loving horror fans out there, this is NOT for the faint of heart.  Watch it under extreme caution if you're a huge baby lover.",1324944000,6,1899,4.829721362229102

8449227,2,B004Z1HY5E,"Well made but tripped itself up... when you're wanting to have a baby girl why would that child having secret Ninja qualities ever be a consideration? (Especially in the more practical 70's). My guess is no one has ever thought about that EVER! The odd twists and turns are quite interesting but the dark premise is so ridiculous it takes all that away. Kinda like melting down a $million in gold to make a club so you can mug a guy for $20... there is no way to make any sense of the core plot. Has the usual idiot scenes (like, you have a loaded shotgun, then you start using it as a stick). Nothing about the acting or production is wrong with this movie, the plot is mildly interesting but ruined by an idiotic core premise... but despite everything, in the end, its just plain boring. Very, very boring. Most of it is a group of women trying to find their way out of a factory complex. Lackluster, dull, could have been something maybe but isn't.",1493424000,,951,4.378531073446328

8449229,4,B004Z1HY5E,This movie was different than I expected.  It had that old school horror look and vibe.  But it went above and beyond that.
