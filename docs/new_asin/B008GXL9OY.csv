5160734,4,B008GXL9OY,"i watched a cadaver christmas earlier today. quite an entertaining movie. energetic, funny, and smartly aware of the tropes it satirizes. the three leads are hysterical, and i laughed out loud early and often. a modest zombie outbreak occurs on the campus of a small college, and it's up to the janitor, deposed police officer, and town drunk to solve the crisis. this delightful flick also contains a pretty graphic and funny necrophilia sequence. great camera work, also. the movie wisely scuffs up the print, a la grindhouse, to give the movie a seventies look, which, to me gives it instant cred and weight. highly recommended.",1359763200,6,631,4.962264150943396
5160735,2,B008GXL9OY,"The idea behind this movie was a winner, but it was unfortunately executed rather poorly. I wanted so badly to like this movie. I mean, a Christmas time zombie holocaust sounds like it should make a great movie. I found this movie to be too slow. The zombie effects were bad, even by low budget standards. The acting was okay considering it is a B movie, and all the actors were likeable enough. This movie just seemed to be missing something and I can't quite put my finger on it. It ended up being kind of boring and forgettable.

I will say that the cover art for this movie is amazing and really drew me in to purchase this item. I was tempted to keep it on my shelf for that reason alone, but I ultimately decided to give this one to my brother (a bigger zombie buff than I am). He had a similar reaction to me and said it was ""alright, but should have been better"".

Rent this one before purchasing it if possible.",1356825600,8,920,4.221590909090909
5160736,5,B008GXL9OY,"A Cadaver Christmas is the rare movie that manages to mix gory horror, humor, and genuine sweet holiday sentimentality and sadness into a film that is far more than the sum of its parts. Composed of two sides, each distinct is a film that amply satisfies both. On one hand you have a film that shows the down sides to the season with people having to work through it while others  drown out their troubles at a bar and with out family. On the other side of the coin you have a great horror romp that never allows itself to be taken too seriously. I definately recommend this film for those who like a little heartfelt sentiment with their irony or a little humor with their horror.",1352764800,13,681,4.362204724409449
5160737,4,B008GXL9OY,"A blood soaked janitor walks into a bar to clean up on Christmas eve with only two patrons in the bar. He calls the cops while the janitor tells them why he is covered in blood. He reminds of a hillbilly version of Bruce Campbell. Anyways, the cop shows up & they go to the school to investigate his claims. It's a fast paced, moving story that looks straight from the 80's. The ending had me surprised but it was smart & something i've not seen before.

Overall, if you love horror comedies, then you'll like this. It's fast paced, funny, & gory. I watched this right after the great film, The Sleeper, & the two go good together. Both films should be watched back to back.",1350432000,6,674,4.307086614173229
5160738,5,B008GXL9OY,"Recently there have been a lot of new Zombie fans brought about by bigger budget movies like Zombieland and movies of that nature. But Cadaver Christmas is a true, low budget indie zombie movie, the kind that makes the genre great. It knows what it is and it embraces it and the entirety of its genre. If you don't like B-movies you may not fully grasp the humor of Cadaver Christmas. But if you love witty humor, zombies, and B-movies make you feel all warm inside, then Cadaver Christmas might be for you.",1350345600,16,507,4.462365591397849
5160739,3,B008GXL9OY,"I read some reviews for A Cadaver Christmas that made it seem like this is some kind of new classic. It isn't. Not even close. It's a zombie comedy that doesn't bring anything new to the table. It's not near as funny as some other zombie comedies, such as Zombieland or Zombie Strippers. It's not a bad movie, mind you. It's just average, and average isn't good enough.",1350000000,8,369,4.4411764705882355
5160740,2,B008GXL9OY,I wanted to like this movie but Damn it Jim I can not. I liked the sound track but this movie is boring. There are a few scenes and a few lines that are funny and that is it (the funniest lines are in the closing credits). It's not worth sitting through the whole movie even if you're having a B-movie party night. You can find something more entertaining.,1350000000,5,356,4.173913043478261
5160741,5,B008GXL9OY,"Saw this movie locally, really enjoyed it and would totally recommend it to anyone looking for a fun goofy horror movie.",1347580800,4,120,4.761904761904762
5160742,4,B008GXL9OY,"Really dig this little grindhouse zom-com with an old school horror feel.  If you're a horror-comedy fan, or just love a good zombie flick, don't miss it!  Plenty of Christmastime gags and gore to fill your home with holiday fear... I mean cheer!",1346716800,7,246,4.6976744186046515
5160743,5,B008GXL9OY,"I saw this movie in the theater when it was privately released by the director in the Quad City area.  Going into the showing, I had no idea what to expect, but I walked out a *HUGE* fan of Zerull and this film.  His vision for the film is spectacular; he uses camera angles to create a texture to the piece that is hard to come by.  There is a grainy, old-time feel to the movie that is somewhat cliche at the start, but then I got into the storyline, and loved how the ""scratchiness"" of his filming lent to the overall feel.  Though I don't watch too many zombie movies, I loved this one!  I don't know how much humor is typically included in the zombie genre, but I found myself laughing so hard at times that I couldn't breathe.  Additionally, there is one scene that pulls at your heartstrings almost to the point of tears.  I can't wait for Oct 9, so I can get my hands on a copy of this film!",1343174400,24,899,4.102857142857143

5160750,5,B008GXL9OY,"A Cadaver Christmas is a fun low-budget zombie flick.  The film has solid b-movie style acting and is stylized like old worn film.  The story reminds me of characters in a table-top rpg zombie horror game where each character has a type they play and flaws that are portrayed.  Mix the characters together in a story, add some random funny bits, some bickering banter, and a dose of humor and you have this film.
The following is a list of movies that have a similar elements:  Planet Terror, Dead Alive, Shawn of the Dead",1430006400,3,522,4.5212765957446805

Kudos to whoever had the idea about making a zombie christmas film, however! Because of this, it's likely thathat more people saw your film than most other low budget zombie films. That's good marketing strategy!",1419897600,,314,4.7272727272727275

5160755,4,B008GXL9OY,This movie was unexpectedly entertaining. The plot was simple and the characters sort of realistic. Unusual twist on a genre that is usually just a blood-fest.,1402012800,,159,5.153846153846154
5160756,5,B008GXL9OY,"Campy, Campy, Campy!!!!! This movie has the appearence of a college student film project. It's a slasher movie and you know it is. You know it's so fake that it is really funny.",1390003200,2,177,4.393939393939394
5160757,5,B008GXL9OY,"This low budget grind house style ZomCom is better than a great number of the big budget zombie movies I have seen. It has the right amount of not taking its self to seriously; while taking its self just seriously enough to not be truly stupid. The acting from an unknown and barely having acted before cast is surprisingly good.

You love zombies, like Christmas, and want a mash-up of the two. This is the one to get!",1389052800,6,419,4.371794871794871
5160758,1,B008GXL9OY,"This movie commits the ultimate cinematic sin. IT'S BORING.Okay. first off, i love independent, painfully low budgeted horror films. I wanted to like this movie. trust me, i can tell that the film makers put incredible effort to make this movie and it shows. Horror comedy a la evil dead 2, which is obvious after watching the scene where the janitor gears up for the zombie fight, but he's no Bruce Campbell. Cool, i get it. Heres the problem, theres not one likable character in this entire movie and the best part of enjoying any movie is to cheer for the good guys and hope they live. In this movie, I was cheering for the rarely seen ""cadavers"".  Also, this movie wasn't funny, just annoying. There was nothing to hold my interest, and when theres a scene where the cadaver has the broken end of a plunger forced through its head and its obvious that the actor doing the so called forcing is  holding the plunger behind the cadavers head to make it look lie it has gone through it, then thats when i get bored. Worst off was the script, especially the dialogue,(nobody talks like that), Like i said, i love bad movies,(Plan 9 from outer space? LOVE IT!!! ) But the final and deadliest problem with this film is that the characters were so annoying I couldn't wait for them to die. Its rare that I want to turn a movie off 20 minutes into it, but this was one of those times, even though i forced myself to sit thru it,(i didn't want to waste the money.) Good film making, bad script. Zombies? Cadavers? Blahhh...",1377129600,,1517,4.453237410071942

5160760,5,B008GXL9OY,"Brilliant movie, IMO. Horror/comedy done right, with strong and well-executed humor throughout. For me, this movie reminded me somewhat of movies such as ""Dead Alive,"" albeit with slightly more slapstick and not quite as gore-filled. Highly recommended film!",1369785600,4,258,5.815789473684211
5160761,4,B008GXL9OY,"The budget and acting hamper this film a bit, but over all it's funny and fast. The zombies themselves aren't particularly scary, but they represent a collective threat that works well in the context of the film. And I have to say the director is pretty brave about going in absurd directions...like when one of the characters has sex with a cadaver in a science lab. Of course it comes back to life! Don't say i didn't warn you.",1364169600,4,429,4.443037974683544
5160762,4,B008GXL9OY,"It is obvious a ton of money was not spent on this film.  It is low budget all the way.  That aside, the writer concentrated on telling one story. This is a story that has a beginning middle and ending, with all the loose endings tied neatly up for the audience,  Multiple plot lines is the downfall of many a monster movie that have the potential to be really good.
Also, the actors had a good time and tossed in a few one-liners that are priceless.  If a little more money had been spent on production and advertizing it would have done much better.  As it is, it will be a guilty pleasure for the ones who can appreciate the twisted little gems hidden in this film.",1361318400,7,668,4.228346456692913
5160763,1,B008GXL9OY,"I attempted to watch this horrible movie. I always go into a movie looking for something new and budget forgiving.

8527755,4,B008GXL9OY,I saw this movie at the Oshkosh Horror Film Festival and I have shown it to countless friends.  It's funny and has just the right amount of gore and offbeat humor to make it the perfect Xmas horror movie.  You won't regret renting it!!!,1513296000,,236,4.340909090909091
8527756,5,B008GXL9OY,"I agree with all other reviewers who find this low budget film a well written, well casted, well acted gem that is better than many other big budget horror films.  It is a tight story with a blend of horror and zombies and large doses of humor that takes place at Christmas.  Be sure to check out the ""behind the scenes"" special feature to see the work involved in making this film.",1513296000,,382,4.291666666666667
