3043626,5,B000ZS8GXA,"Thanks to a marathon TBS aired last year around Oscar time, I finally got to see some back-to-back episodes of the TBS original series My Boys. But not all of them. Just enough to get me hooked on the show.

Thanks to the Sony DVD release of My Boys - The Complete First Season, I can finally watch all 22 episodes from the show's brilliantly funny first season completely unfettered. The marathon, of course, was just an appetizer. With this Season One DVD, you get the main course with all the fixins. My Boys - The Complete First Season is a 3-disc set featuring all 22 episodes in Anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) video; English 5.1 audio; English, French subtitles; Closed Captioning; plus a host of bonus features including featurettes, deleted scenes and more.

My Boys stars lovely Jordana Spiro (who sounds like Kristen Johnston from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3rd-Rock-from-the-Sun/dp/B0007WQGVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3rd Rock from the Sun</a>) as Penelope Jane ""PJ"" Franklin, a tomboy sportswriter for the Chicago Sun-Times whose life is surrounded by men, both professionally and personally. Playing the pivotal roles of PJ's guy friends are Kyle Howard (The Drew Carey Show) as rival sportswriter and former love interest Bobby; Reid Scott as pretty boy radio DJ Brendan; Michael Bunin as odd and quirky memorabilia store owner Kenny; Jamie Kaler as excitable skirt-chaser Mike; comedian Jim Gaffigan as PJ's married, sarcastic and sardonic older brother Andy; plus Kellee Stewart as Stephanie, PJ's best gal pal, who schools her on the fine art of modern dating. Look for memorable guest appearances from Johnny Galecki (The Big Bang Theory) and Nicole Sullivan (The King of Queens) as Kenny's hipster friend Trouty and very pregnant girlfriend Kimmie.

Though presented from a female point of view, My Boys, replete with baseball analogies (narrated by Spiro) and naturally witty dialogue exchanged over ritual poker games and drinks at the bar, offers plenty of fun and entertainment to both male and female viewers. Not to mention great production values, not unlike those of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sex-and-the-City/dp/B00004RFCM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sex and the City</a>.

Both Season 1 and My Boys: The Complete Second and Third Seasons ([...]) are jam packed with a nice amount of episodes.

The sad thing is that My Boys - Season 04 ([...]) was cut short and although it is the most expensive, it only has 8 episodes total, where is Season 1 has over 20+.",1360281600,,445,3.9775280898876404
3043655,5,B000ZS8GXA,"My Boys was the best show that TBS ever produced. Sadly, it was always under-watched and unappreciated, which is probably why this is the only season to be over 9 episodes. As with all the other seasons, special features are basically non-existent, but this set is worth the money for the show alone. The cast all have great chemistry together. No matter which combination of the crew is onscreen, you know you're in for a laugh. I'm not gonna say this one is necessarily a 'family show,' but it's one that, as an adult, you can watch with your parents without being embarrassed by what's going on onscreen.",1356048000,,607,4.62962962962963
3043656,5,B000ZS8GXA,Excellent first season of a sit com.  Relationship issues discussed in a manner that is very appealing to both males and females.  Creative use of sports as they relate to love.,1353456000,,177,4.67741935483871
3043667,5,B000ZS8GXA,"Love the charaters, cast and the plot line of this series.  Was very happy to find it on DVD after TBS cancelled the show prematurely.  It takes a little time to really appreciate where everyone comes from, but the comedic talent and lines in this show are just great.",1321228800,,268,4.448979591836735
3043668,5,B000ZS8GXA,"I wish I would have found this series before. I think it is delightful, and have ordered the 2nd & 3rd season. With all the poorly written- Two and 1/2 Men- shows on TV, it is too bad that this gem wasn't renewed.",1301097600,,213,3.9767441860465116
3043669,5,B000ZS8GXA,"This is a great series, and I'm so bummed the show was canceled. Being from Chicago, I loved all the references to the Cubs and the city. But even so, it's just funny and isn't at all crude or full of cussing. Very funny!",1290729600,,221,4.045454545454546

3043671,5,B000ZS8GXA,"P.J. and her buddies are funny and realistic.  Set in the great city of Chicago, this series will hook anyone who enjoys comedy, references to baseball (and other sports), and can relate to interactions between the opposite sex.  This show really grows on you!",1283472000,,260,4.886363636363637
3043672,3,B000ZS8GXA,"this ""odd man out"" story is well enough done to provide pleasant enough viewing. the cast is competent. Certainly there are no surprises here.  Formulaic isn't necessarily bad- but when they make it this obvious it does take away from the enjoyment. The characters are all sprung fully formed from the ground. PJ is the only one with a sibling and she makes passing reference to parents but no pictures of them are in evidence. she seems totally oblivious to the existence of her niece. the rest of her gang other than her brother might have been raised as orphans or by wolves. the prime ""activity"" seems to be obsessing over sports while consuming a vast quantity of alcohol. If she was an orphan you could better understand why she is so invested in her ersatz family. when her old college guy pal tries to alert her to the fact that one day her place as the female center of the group  will be replaced by their girlfriends or wives she seems stunned. She dumps her boyfriend because he and the guys don't hit it off. like her college pal he tries to tell her  ""hangin' with the boys"" is just a phase but she ain't  having it. guess she thinks if she's married with children at 35 she will just drag the toddlers with her to get hammered and talk sports with the dudes in the bar. even in my twenties i knew that hanging out in bars wasn't the be all and end all. i also knew that friends come and go into your life. you hold on to them as best you can but often you just drift apart. if the show had dealt with the inevitable forces which cause groups to naturally drift apart it would have made for more interesting viewing.",1261699200,,1630,4.316993464052287
3043673,5,B000ZS8GXA,"LOVE THIS TV SHOW!  Witty, well-written, likable characters, built around sports.  Love a show that has such great dialogue on how guys think.  We have been anxiously awaiting the release of seasons 2 and 3.  My kids and I all watch this show, and quote the lines.  This show is better than anything on network or cable tv.  SO awesome!",1256774400,,336,4.516666666666667

3043687,5,B000ZS8GXA,"This show is awesome!  I just discovered it as I didn't get the channel tbs when it was first aired but knew it would appeal to me as the title character seems a lot like me, unlike most shows with a very girly and trendy lead.  I love the one-liners, especially Jim Gaffigan's character Andy.  The service from amazon is awful though.  I ordered this item on May 19 and it is in stock and it says it won't be delivered until June 4th.  16 days?!  Seriously?!  All other companies I use for ordering (huge retailers to mom & pop shops) have delivered within a week and I usually get the item much faster than expected.  So 5 stars for My Boys and 1 star for amazon!",1243900800,,665,4.181102362204724
3043688,5,B000ZS8GXA,"My Boys is such a refreshing comedy.  The banter between PJ and her boys is light and flows easily. It feels liek being out with a group of college friends and raises a lot of concerns that face 20/30 somethings.  Especially if you're a woman that works with a lot of men, you'll understandthe particular frisson that comes from that environment.
My Boys doesn't try to be too deep or overly serious.  It's just a nice comedy and one that you'll feel comfortable watching with friends or family.",1238716800,2,495,4.6022727272727275

3043690,5,B000ZS8GXA,"This great TV series is lost to a majority of potential viewers because of it's cable channel association, but luckily it can be enjoyed commercial free through this DVD package.  Great interaction between the cast of characters to along with a well thought out story line.  Anyone who is a fan of sports, particulary baseball will find this series to be well worth their time!",1233878400,2,377,4.7846153846153845
3043691,5,B000ZS8GXA,"I started watching this show when it first began and instantly LOVED it, it is such a great show, and is different from alot of shows nowadays... PJ is such a great character, and all the guys in her life are so quirky in different ways that it makes for a great and funny show :)",1233446400,,280,4.017857142857143
3043692,5,B000ZS8GXA,"I loved watching this. I missed the first few episodes so it was fun catching up and getting some missing background. I love the relationships and their disfunction demonstrated through the story. The cast is so believable and real. If you love Chicago that makes the story even better.
The special features with the DVD were nice to become more familiar with how the story happened and to get to know the actors and the creators themselves.",1231200000,,441,4.740259740259741
3043693,5,B000ZS8GXA,I agree with everyone else.  I love this show!  I was totally hooked from the first episode.  Worth buying the DVD for sure!!,1228435200,,125,4.3478260869565215
3043694,5,B000ZS8GXA,"This show is so good, I miss it when it's off the air. The cast is so funny and the basis feels real. I recomend this Dvd o anyone with ears and eyes who want to laugh. What could be better than friends who don't hold back?",1219190400,,223,3.765957446808511
3043695,5,B000ZS8GXA,"This show is fun to watch.
The characters quickly feel like the guys next door; I find myself looking forward to their next escapade.
Check out a show on iTunes & then buy the season here for $15.00 less.",1216252800,3,204,4.256410256410256
3043706,5,B000ZS8GXA,"A must have for those looking for a comical true to life story. A tomboy personality girl named Pj tries to keep both a social life and at the same time hang out with her four close friends and older brother. The only guide to her feminine side is her friend Stephanie who is more girl than the norm. The first season trails through with Pj just trying to find a man who can adapt to her unusual environment of close friends.

You won't regret the purchase, I still watch this non stop to this day =)

3043707,5,B000ZS8GXA,"I got to see this show on a weekend marathon at TBS and loved it. I don't get that station where I live because I reside outside the USA, so I hadn't seen it before, but got determined to get it when it came out. Now I am a proud owner of a great show that I hope lasts a long time. I find it funny, entertaining and very relaxing. Oh, and the characters are a good ensamble, each bringing something interesting to the show.",1215216000,,424,4.0
3043708,5,B000ZS8GXA,"If you're a lifelong Chicagoan AND a Chicago Cubs fan like me, this is definitely a show for you! Not only is this show one of the best written on the air right now, creator and writer Betsy Thomas must be a native because every other line is a deep down reference to Chicago and it's surrounding areas. I mean, come on - sushi bars in Skokie's Old Orchard area? Pizza and chicken wings on Southport?? Peter, Paul and Mommy in Elgin??? The Sybaris in Northbrook???

Also, for a show shot in LA, they've got Chicago's Wrigleyville down pat to ever square inch! They've gotta be doing at least a few exterior location shoots. These ""sets"" are too perfect.

But don't let my second city bias delude the fact I also feel this is a brillaintly executed show! The writing is top-notch, Jordana Spano is perfectly cast as the tomboy Chicago Sun-Times sports writer (who covers the Cubs!) and has friends who are not only locals, but talk with local accents! Spano's character ""PJ"" is the heart of this show and someone any guy can fall in love with at a moment's notice, whether a baseball fanatic like she is or not.

I'm hooked, just like anyone else watching this fantastic comedy will be!",1215043200,,1185,4.52803738317757

3043710,5,B000ZS8GXA,"Don't be fooled by all the five star reviews on here, this show is not a classic, at least not the first half (of season 1). I must admit when i started watching this show i thought 'there is no way this show will last, theres just not enough chemistry between the characters' but somehow it has got a second season, and i think this show has a future, mainly thanks to the beautiful and talented Jordano Spiro (PJ)",1213315200,2,415,4.265822784810126
3043711,5,B000ZS8GXA,"I love this show to death. I'm glad it's on DVD now.

3043712,5,B000ZS8GXA,"hi! not much to add to others comments,just wanted to voice my agreement with all the great reviews. watch this show once and then set some time aside for watching the new season that starts on june 12th. you'll be glad you did!",1213142400,2,228,4.325581395348837
3043713,5,B000ZS8GXA,"I started watching My Boys from the very begining and absolutely LOVED it.  The characters are quirky, but that's what makes the show.  They could be some buddies down the street.  PJ is very likable and you're always pulling for her.  The guys are funny and just want to hang out and play poker and drink beer.  I'm glad season 1 finally came out on DVD so I can re-watch it (it's almost been a year since I saw it) before season 2 premiers.  I just want to know who is on the plane with PJ!!!!  If you watch, you'll be wondering the same thing.",1213056000,2,546,4.142857142857143
3043714,5,B000ZS8GXA,"My Boys has instantly become one of my favorite tv series.  I downloaded the complete season 1 on Itunes and came instantly addicted to the series.

It follows the life of Penelope Jane ""PJ"" Franklin, a Chicago Sun Times sportswriter and tomboy who is surrounded by men in her work arena and her personal life.  Her boys include:
-Andy, PJ's older married brother whose constantly complains how his wife Meredith keeps a short lease on him
-Brendan (nickname Brando), one of PJ's oldest best friends and good looking radio DJ who constantly crashes at PJ's house
-Bobby, newcomer to the group and rival sportswriter as well as one of PJ's former love interest
-Kenny, owns a memorabilia sports store
-Michael, who worked in sports front office/works at Kenny's store

To balance out all this testosterone is PJ's best girl friend, Stephanie, whom she met in journalism school.  Stephanie is always trying to get PJ to dress like a woman not a tomboy all the time.  She is also helps her navigate the world of dating.

This series is told from PJ's point of view on the single life and the modern dating world with baseball analogies used through out.  PJ and her boys all get together at PJ's place for their weekly poker game or at their neighborhood bar, Crowleys.

This series reminds me of Sex and the City with the female lead who narrates the show and takes place in a big city.  The difference is that she has friends that are mostly guys instead of girlfriends.  I enjoy the witty batter exchanged between her and her boys.  There are definitely some laugh out loud moments.  It is also about real life and making friends.  These boys are like her family and she loves them.  She stands up for them and also tells them when they are acting like idiots which is pretty often with this group.  They would do the same for her.

Season 1 left us with a cliffhanger.  Stephanie and PJ had been planning a couples Italy trip.  Stephanie had her date.  Who is PJ going on the Italy trip with?  She had more than 3 possibilites so it is anybody's guess.  I can't wait to find out when the new season starts in June.",1207440000,17,2115,4.525065963060686
3043715,5,B000ZS8GXA,"This is a great show.  Instantly fell in love with PJ and the guys.  It is a new show that will soon be a classic.  Cannot wait till more episodes of My Boys air.  Should watch, will soon fall in love.",1207094400,3,201,3.8292682926829267

The sad thing is that My Boys - Season 04 ([...]) was cut short and although it is the most expensive, it only has 8 episodes total, where is Season 1 has over 20+.",1360281600,,445,3.9775280898876404
3278152,5,B000ZS8GXA,"My Boys was the best show that TBS ever produced. Sadly, it was always under-watched and unappreciated, which is probably why this is the only season to be over 9 episodes. As with all the other seasons, special features are basically non-existent, but this set is worth the money for the show alone. The cast all have great chemistry together. No matter which combination of the crew is onscreen, you know you're in for a laugh. I'm not gonna say this one is necessarily a 'family show,' but it's one that, as an adult, you can watch with your parents without being embarrassed by what's going on onscreen.",1356048000,,607,4.62962962962963

3278169,3,B000ZS8GXA,"this ""odd man out"" story is well enough done to provide pleasant enough viewing. the cast is competent. Certainly there are no surprises here.  Formulaic isn't necessarily bad- but when they make it this obvious it does take away from the enjoyment. The characters are all sprung fully formed from the ground. PJ is the only one with a sibling and she makes passing reference to parents but no pictures of them are in evidence. she seems totally oblivious to the existence of her niece. the rest of her gang other than her brother might have been raised as orphans or by wolves. the prime ""activity"" seems to be obsessing over sports while consuming a vast quantity of alcohol. If she was an orphan you could better understand why she is so invested in her ersatz family. when her old college guy pal tries to alert her to the fact that one day her place as the female center of the group  will be replaced by their girlfriends or wives she seems stunned. She dumps her boyfriend because he and the guys don't hit it off. like her college pal he tries to tell her  ""hangin' with the boys"" is just a phase but she ain't  having it. guess she thinks if she's married with children at 35 she will just drag the toddlers with her to get hammered and talk sports with the dudes in the bar. even in my twenties i knew that hanging out in bars wasn't the be all and end all. i also knew that friends come and go into your life. you hold on to them as best you can but often you just drift apart. if the show had dealt with the inevitable forces which cause groups to naturally drift apart it would have made for more interesting viewing.",1261699200,,1630,4.316993464052287

I just discovered it as I didn't get the channel tbs when it was first aired but knew it would appeal to me as the title character seems a lot like me, unlike most shows with a very girly and trendy lead.  I love the one-liners, especially Jim Gaffigan's character Andy.  The service from amazon is awful though.  I ordered this item on May 19 and it is in stock and it says it won't be delivered until June 4th.  16 days?!  Seriously?!  All other companies I use for ordering (huge retailers to mom & pop shops) have delivered within a week and I usually get the item much faster than expected.

Especially if you're a woman that works with a lot of men, you'll understandthe particular frisson that comes from that environment.
My Boys doesn't try to be too deep or overly serious.  It's just a nice comedy and one that you'll feel comfortable watching with friends or family.",1238716800,2,495,4.6022727272727275

The first season trails through with Pj just trying to find a man who can adapt to her unusual environment of close friends.

3278205,5,B000ZS8GXA,"If you're a lifelong Chicagoan AND a Chicago Cubs fan like me, this is definitely a show for you! Not only is this show one of the best written on the air right now, creator and writer Betsy Thomas must be a native because every other line is a deep down reference to Chicago and it's surrounding areas. I mean, come on - sushi bars in Skokie's Old Orchard area? Pizza and chicken wings on Southport?? Peter, Paul and Mommy in Elgin??? The Sybaris in Northbrook???

Also, for a show shot in LA, they've got Chicago's Wrigleyville down pat to ever square inch! They've gotta be doing at least a few exterior location shoots. These ""sets"" are too perfect.

But don't let my second city bias delude the fact I also feel this is a brillaintly executed show! The writing is top-notch, Jordana Spano is perfectly cast as the tomboy Chicago Sun-Times sports writer (who covers the Cubs!) and has friends who are not only locals, but talk with local accents! Spano's character ""PJ"" is the heart of this show and someone any guy can fall in love with at a moment's notice, whether a baseball fanatic like she is or not.

I'm glad season 1 finally came out on DVD so I can re-watch it (it's almost been a year since I saw it) before season 2 premiers.  I just want to know who is on the plane with PJ!!!!

3278211,5,B000ZS8GXA,"My Boys has instantly become one of my favorite tv series.  I downloaded the complete season 1 on Itunes and came instantly addicted to the series.

It follows the life of Penelope Jane ""PJ"" Franklin, a Chicago Sun Times sportswriter and tomboy who is surrounded by men in her work arena and her personal life.  Her boys include:
-Andy, PJ's older married brother whose constantly complains how his wife Meredith keeps a short lease on him
-Brendan (nickname Brando), one of PJ's oldest best friends and good looking radio DJ who constantly crashes at PJ's house
-Bobby, newcomer to the group and rival sportswriter as well as one of PJ's former love interest
-Kenny, owns a memorabilia sports store
-Michael, who worked in sports front office/works at Kenny's store

To balance out all this testosterone is PJ's best girl friend, Stephanie, whom she met in journalism school.  Stephanie is always trying to get PJ to dress like a woman not a tomboy all the time.  She is also helps her navigate the world of dating.

This series is told from PJ's point of view on the single life and the modern dating world with baseball analogies used through out.  PJ and her boys all get together at PJ's place for their weekly poker game or at their neighborhood bar, Crowleys.

This series reminds me of Sex and the City with the female lead who narrates the show and takes place in a big city.  The difference is that she has friends that are mostly guys instead of girlfriends.  I enjoy the witty batter exchanged between her and her boys.  There are definitely some laugh out loud moments.  It is also about real life and making friends.  These boys are like her family and she loves them.  She stands up for them and also tells them when they are acting like idiots which is pretty often with this group.  They would do the same for her.

Season 1 left us with a cliffhanger.  Stephanie and PJ had been planning a couples Italy trip.  Stephanie had her date.  Who is PJ going on the Italy trip with?  She had more than 3 possibilites so it is anybody's guess.  I can't wait to find out when the new season starts in June.",1207440000,17,2115,4.525065963060686

Jordana Spiro does a terrific job in playing the major female role. Mike Gaffigan is perfectly cast as her brother. The other castmates all do a terrific job from the beginning and that you slowly develop to care about the characters.

The first season is done particularly well for a TBS comedy. Too bad, it only lasted four seasons. On three DVDs, you get to enjoy the 21 episodes and the special features as well. The special features includes ""Life in the Press Box"" where we learn about behind the scenes of the show. There is a quirky sports quiz and a favorite sport quiz?
