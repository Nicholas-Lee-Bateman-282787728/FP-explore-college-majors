4989161,3,B006H4I7HQ,"With early memories  (1940+), I hoped for more of the old songs made famous by Tauber! Two or rhree were there, but the programme as a whole could only be described not bad, but not wonderful! The singers wer quite good, but the nostalgia was not there. Nor was there a need for still more Straus in a LEHAR GalA CONCERT!

  Verdict- passable but not 5 star.",1342656000,,358,4.298507462686567

4989164,5,B006H4I7HQ,"I so did not want to review this performance. Why not? Well, gentle reader, it requires that I confess to being, in addition to a bel canto addict, an operetta freak, as well. Well, it may be that a ""musical outing"" like this builds character or is ""good for me"" or whatever. But the real issue is whether or not you should shell out some buckaroos for this 94 minute gem, which preserves the 2011 New Year's Eve concert from the Semperoper in Dresden. Naturlich, I think you should, and here's why:

The music: Most (but not all) of this concert features the music of Franz Lehar ( you think that Germans would have a New Year's concert without some of the Strauss boys' waltzes??) Lehar, once he had started composing for tenor Richard Tauber (What?? You draw a blank on that name?? Go immediately to the CD Dept. and order a couple of his discs! He was a remarkable singer.)produced music that drew from all the Strauss guys, including Richard and Johann Sr. and the sons. This disc contains several orchestral pieces by Lehar as well as the vocal works, and the Straussian influence is quite clear there. I know that the operettas on stage define schmalz, but a bit of sentiment in our hectic world might be a dose of the good thing, IMHO. But the tunes offered here are meltingly lovely.

The singers: here we have two sopranos, both unknown to me before experiencing this performance, and tenor Piotr Beczala, with whom I was familiar. Angela Denoke's first song is """"Liebe, du Himmel auf Erden"" and she does well with it. She should have warmed up a bit more, because some of her early notes are a bit tenuous. The second soprano is Ana Maria Labin whose rendition of ""Ich bin verliebt"" is simply superb. Beczala is first rate throughout, and his rendition of ""Dien ist mein ganzes Hertz"" brings down the house, albeit in a well behaved and reserved Germanic fashion. Maestro Thielemann, a noted Wagner interpreter, prove that he can conduct the more melodic and heart warming fare offered on this disc.

Disc quality is what I have come to expect from DGG: clear and crisp picture and DTS sound that will be culturally enhancing to my neighbors once it warms up and I can open windows. One caveat: while the video of the performers is excellent, there seems to be a need on the part of the German video techies to add a color filter to pics of the audience. Maybe it's a form of schmalz that I don't understand, but it can be a bit of a distraction to have that blue fog come up. (Why there is a need to pan the audience at all is a question that someone at DGG might address.)

In sum, this is a dandy performance of many well known and beloved operetta gems that will enjoy many playings here. I think that you will enjoy it, too. If you keep the sound down and the windows closed, you can enjoy wallowing in operetta and no one else will know. Unless you do a review.",1331424000,22,2878,4.445075757575758

8498125,4,B006H4I7HQ,"I am not an operetta expert though I have seen many.  I also don't understand German.  Despite this I enjoyed this DVD.  I thought that the orchestra and soloists did a first rate job.  The program explored some aspects of the operetta repertoire with which I was unfamiliar.  The concert venue is beautiful.  The DTS sound was very good.  The picture was excellent even on my 53 inch edge lit LED.  There are subtitles in multiple languages.  Angela Denoke's rendition of ""Warum soll eine Frau kein Verhattnin haben"" was particularly entrancing.",1365379200,2,546,4.912087912087912
8498127,2,B006H4I7HQ,"So here it is, the Emmerich Klmn gala from Dresden's Semperoper on CD. Christian Thielemann is conducting the forces of the Staatskapelle Dresden, and his two soloists are Polish tenor Piotr Beczala and last-minute stand-in Ingeborg Schpf from the rural Staatsoperette Dresden (she replaced Diana Damrau who fell sick on the day of the performance).
Anyone who saw the live TV-transmission of this concert on New Year's Eve will remember that the soloists looked very attractive in a retro kind of way, in fact, the whole show had a definitive retro-touch bringing to mind the (in)famous seventies operetta shows on German TV with Anneliese Rothenberger and Ingeborg Hallstein. Any fan of that sort of operetta - and that sort of operetta singing - will love this new CD. Beczala with his elegant slim tenor sounds a bit like a re-born Fritz Wunderlich though he's not as emotionally gripping as the famous sixties predecessor (yet). Schpf looked better on screen than she sounds on CD, her voice is a bit anonymous and shrill at the top, her delivery of the songs on the dull side of things. But again, if you like seventies operetta, you will probably enjoy the two soloists and you won't mind their very passive treatment of the song lyrics.
Conductor Christian Thielemann devoted the 2012/13 gala entirely to Klmn, after two Lehr galas in the years before (the last one is included as a bonus DVD) I personally find his conducting of operetta and Klmn in particular a bit too broad and languid to be exiting; also the sound on CD is slightly blurred so that details often get lost. In addition, the most sensual number Thielemann did conduct, the intermezzo from Die Bajadere, is cut from the CD. No idea why. (Instead, the Robert Stolz song ""Ob blond, ob braun, ich liebe alle Frau'n"" is included.)
Anyone who wants a modern digital version of these standard hits and some rarities - such as ""Carrambolina, Carramboletta"" from Veilchen vom Montmartre and ""Mein Traum, mein Traum"" from Kaiserin Josphine (not couting ""Ein kleiner Solowfox mit Mary"" from the jazzy Herzogin von Chicago) - will want to have this CD. True aficionados of retro-operetta might prefer to stick to their recordings of Csardasfrstin and Grfin Mariza with Rudolf Schock/Margit Schramm and Robert Stolz conducting. Maestro Stolz, in direct comparison with Thielemann, demonstrates a far securer grip of this repertoire and is more convincing all round. And when it comes to ""Gr mir mein Wien"" ... no one beats Fritz Wunderlich singing that. Sorry, Piotr!

8498128,5,B006H4I7HQ,"This 2011/2012 New Year's Eve concert from Dresden continues a new 'tradition' started as recently as the previous year. On that occasion the concert also focussed on Lehar, but was, in effect an abbreviated concert version of Merry Widow highlights led by Renee Fleming. On this occasion the net is spread far wider with a representative selection from several of Lehar's operettas drawn from various periods of his life. The Merry Widow is not included here having been so extensively highlighted the previous year.

Thielemann, who is an ardent believer in operetta, is joined by sopranos Angela Denoke and Ana Maria Labin plus tenor Piotr Beczala. All three of these soloists clearly enjoy Lehar's music and this communicates well to the packed audience. The two most experienced singers, Denoke and Beczala, perform well in their duets together as well as in their solo arias. Both display a total ease with the genre which greatly adds to the occasion. Ana Labin sings her solos with absolute security and her top range rings thrillingly around the hall with apparent ease. No wonder she is in increasing demand at this relatively early stage in her career.

One of the joys of the concert is to hear the music played so well by a really top flight orchestra. They get four chances to play without accompanying the singers in addition to the final waltz, Strauss' An der Elbe, which is obviously going to be a regular finale item for all such future concerts. The chorus also rises well to the occasion although they have relatively little to do, this being a night that belongs mainly to the soloists.

The ballet company also gets a star spot and on this occasion they are introduced by watch a delightful young girl apparently leaving her mother on the rear row of the stalls to go through the swing doors. Here she meets members of the ballet and is able to watch and ever so slightly join in towards the end of the piece. At this point she returns to her 'mother.' This entire section makes for a delightfully imaginative and charming section of the concert. The dancing itself follows much the same format as the well-known Viennese version within the New Year's Day concerts and is excellently done.

The repertoire itself includes excerpts from Giuditta, Paganini, Der Graf von Luxemburg, Friederike, Land of Smiles, Der Gottergatte, Eva, Der Zarewitsch, Schon ist die Welt and Zigeunerliebe. The concert concludes with three non-Lehar items - an aria by Oscar Strauss, not related, plus a polka and the final waltz, as previously mentioned, by J. Strauss II.

The recording quality is clearly in HD and delivers excellent visuals of crispness and clarity with good colour definition. The equally fine soundtracks are presented in DTS 5.1 and stereo.

I would suggest that this very enjoyable concert warrants serious consideration by anyone interested in the repertoire and makes for a good continuation of the new Dresden 'tradition' started the previous year.",1360195200,4,2976,4.953907815631262

I was delighted from beginning to end; and, as a matter of fact, wished it would have gone on and on.  Thielemann and the Staatskapelle Dresden are spectaclular, producing one happy moment after another.  I found Angela Denoke a little ""long in the tooth,"" but good nevertheless.  This is simply one of the best recordings I have bought the entire year.",1349481600,4,501,4.7011494252873565
