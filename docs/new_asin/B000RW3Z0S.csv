2875718,5,B000RW3Z0S,"If you actually want to learn some Raider history from the best Raiders ever, then this is for you.  These documentaries are riveting, and make you proud to be a member of the Raider Nation.  This is what its all about people, Stabler, Casper, Branch, Villapiano, Alzado, Plunkett, & Allen.

You get to see what makes up a champion team and what your team and our values stand for within this illustrious franchise.

I watch them over and over.  If you know whats on these disks then you will have a pretty good idea about what this team is about.

Only problem is the NFL thinks we have short attention spans and limited intellect.  I guess for the details I have to resort to reading Raider books.

Former Raiders linebacker Phil Villapiano is featured in this video along with many other Raider greats including John Madden.",1256515200,4,325,5.037037037037037
2875722,5,B000RW3Z0S,"Again, The Sabol Family and NFL Films proves why no one else should be documenting the National Football League.  Part of the Emmy Award winning series AMERICA'S GAME, these 3 segments are outstanding, whether you're a Raiders fan or not.  Most moving is the tribute by Todd Christensen (""The only sin is the sin of ingratitude,"")in the 1983 segment.  The Raiders Theme by Sam Spence is dynamic and played throughout, as it should be.  The only thing that could have made this series better is (the late) John Facenda (The Voice Of God) narrating.",1246752000,6,547,4.787234042553192

2875733,5,B000RW3Z0S,"The series ""America's Game"" on NFL Network may be the best series on TV at the moment (since Breaking Bad finished).  1976, 1980 and 1983,  those were the years for us Raiders fans. Each super bowl season is on a separate dvd.  You get documentary from Ken Stabler, Phil Villapiano, Marcus Allen and many more of the greats.  You won't regret buying this box set, especially for the price.  I'd suggest you hardcore Raiders buy the ""History Of The Oakland Raiders"" dvd set as well.  That one has it all!",1399939200,,503,4.533333333333333

8202633,5,B000RW3Z0S,"I'm not a Raiders fan, but I am a fan of sports stories. The ""America's Game"" series originally shown on NFL Channel is an excellent, well produced series of documentaries.

This three-disk set covers the three Super Bowl winning Raiders Teams. The first, the 1976 Raiders, is the story of the original ""renegades"" told by John Madden, Ken Stabler and Phil Vallapiano. The second disk is about the 1980 Raiders told by Jim Plunkett, Gene Upshaw and Matt Millen. The third is the 1983 LA Raiders whose story is told by Marcus Allen, Todd Christiansen and Howie Long.

The stories you hear about these athletes as they chase a championship! The often hilarious quotes! Ken Stabler on having a night life on the eve of games: ""How much sleep do you really need to play a three hour game? A lot of the time, I studied the game plan by the light of the jukebox."" Matt Millen on his teammates when drafted by the Raiders: ""All I knew about John Matuzak was that he was supposed to be crazy...and he didn't disappoint.""

The Raiders was the team that was often the only hope for players cast off by the other teams and as Guard Gene Upshaw pointed out to players who found themselves on his team, ""We told people there aren't many stops after this one.""

These basically hour-long documentaries are studies of men in a competitive endeavor and as such they reveal much about human nature. They're well made, well produced and have excellent music and cinematography. The three-disc set was a bargain to boot!",1512604800,,1501,4.631578947368421

8202641,5,B000RW3Z0S,"The ""America's Game"" series is unmatched in it's production & and elegant presentation of some of the most iconic moments in sports history, and is again well represented in this feature of the historic championships of the Oakland Raiders.

With the familiarly iconic music score accompanying the always dramatic footage of NFL films, you get complete and sometimes behind-the-scenes look into the journey of all 3 championship teams, accompanied by in-depth interviews with some of the actual players & coaches reliving some of their greatest moments for your pleasure.

Entertaining at the least, enthralling at it's best.  You almost can't help but get a little emotional when Todd Christensen gets choked up as he reminisces about Marcus Allen galloping through the Redskin defense for a touchdown in the Superbowl XVIII:

It's things like that which make this series so great, and a necessity in any fan's collection.",1470182400,,929,5.256756756756757
