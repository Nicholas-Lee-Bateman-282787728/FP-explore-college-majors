7859137,2,6304031572,"The Public Enemy-Nasty Boys tag team match was entertaining crud to say the least. The TV title match between Johnny B. Badd-Diamond Dallas Page was good also to say the least. The World tag team title match between the team of Sting & Lex Luger against Harlem Heat was garbage. The United States title match between Konnan & One Man Gang was like the movie,Ready to Rumble:a Dud. The ""I Respect You"" Strap match between Brain Pillman & Kevin Sullivan was short and will leave a bad taste in your mouth. The 2nd World Tag Team title match between the team of Sting & Lex Luger against The Road Warriors was lame and boring. The Cage match for the Worlds title match between Randy Savage & Ric Flair was trash. The 2nd Cage match between Hulk Hogan & The Giant was also trash. I give this PPV a 2 out of 10.",1363996800,,806,4.309210526315789
7859138,5,6304031572,"I guess I'm on a WCW kick because here's another old tape I found.  Around this time, there was an alliance between the 4 Horsemen & Dungeon Of Doom to rid themselves of Hulk Hogan & Randy Savage...but there was tension between Horsemen member Brian Pillman & Dungeon leader Kevin Sullivan.  Also, the Road Warriors returned to WCW to challenge for the WCW Tag Team Titles against the new champions in Sting (who had no problems being a fighting champion) & Lex Luger (who wanted to avoid the Warriors) while the previous champions Harlem Heat wanted their tag title rematch.

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Nasty Boys vs. Public Enemy - This was a hardcore feud in 1996 that is constantly overshadowed by the over big main event feuds, storylines, & events that happened during the year.  With both teams having a reputation for being hardcore brawlers & with their first match at the Clash Of The Champions getting way out of control, you knew to expect chaos & you got it.  Tables were broken, chairs were used, and trash cans were being piledriven on within the opening minutes.  They were fighting in the ring, isleway, concession stands using every & anything they could get their hands on.  What a wild brawl & a heck of an opening match.

WCW Television Champion Johnny B. Badd vs. Dallas Page - DDP lost the TV Title & ""Diamond Doll"" Kimberly in back to back PPV matches so if he loses this one, he'll lose his $6.6 Million that Kimberly won at a bingo game.  This match wasn't like their previous encounters that went back & forth as DDP dominated the first half of this match but kept focusing on Kimberly whenever he was in the position to win before Badd started to build up some offense.  This match didn't live up to their previous two matches as the match had a heavy slow pace to the point where the crowd started to chant ""boring"" before the ending where Badd once again defeated DDP.
As a side note for those who don't remember or know, this ended up being the last WCW PPV appearence of Johnny B. Badd as he had a heavy disagreement with Eric Bischoff which lead to him dropping the TV title to Lex Luger & walking out of WCW to debut in WWF at WrestleMania XII the next month as ""Wildman"" Marc Mero.

WCW Tag Team Champions Sting & Lex Luger vs. Harlem Heat - The winners of this match would go on to face the Road Warriors later in the night.  This was a good match between both teams as the obivious tension between Sting & Luger kept playing a part along with the presence of the Road Warriors in the end to insure they get the team they wanted to face later on.

WCW United States Champion Konnan vs. One Man Gang - This was the only flop on the card as One Man Gang just wasn't a good worker & while Konnan made the match decent, he couldn't carry the match alone.

Respect Strap Match: Kevin Sullivan vs. Brian Pillman - This is the one incident that this PPV was remembered for as Pillman & Sullivan tangled together with some stiff lashings from the strap for around a minute before Pillman broke kayfabe saying ""I respect you BOOKERMAN! (the word ""bookerman"" was edited off the VHS)"" and walking off.  From there, Arn Anderson came out & had took Pillman's place for a few mins. before Flair came out & had both sides make peace.  This was a crappy match but this wasn't about the match, it was all about establishing Pillman's ""loose cannon"" character...and mission accomplished.

WCW Tag Team Champions Sting & Lex Luger vs. Road Warriors - This was a very slow but physical match between these two & was very similar like the previous one in that there was tension between Luger & Sting but also the story was made clear that the Road Warriors had respect for Sting & wanted their hands on Luger.  Overall, good match.

Steel Cage Match: WCW Champion Randy Savage vs. Ric Flair - The way to win this cage match is by either pinfall/submission.  This was one of the best cage matches I remember in WCW (not NWA, just WCW) history as it had it's a good mix of wrestling & brawling with moments like Flair attacking the referee early, Savage jumping off the top of the cage, and Flair being busted open.  However, the ending came with Ms. Elizabeth turning on Randy Savage to give Flair her high heeled shoe to nail Savage & win the WCW Championship.  The only real bad thing I can say here is that the camera angle missed the ending but that didn't take away from the match itself.

Steel Cage Match: Hulk Hogan vs. Giant - Unlike the previous cage match, this could only be won by escaping the cage.  This encounter was better than their previous Havoc match as Hogan dominated it until Giant went after Hogan's injured eye (which was also injured by Elizabeth's heel shoe on an earlier Nitro) but Hogan recoved in the end for the victory & ended up fending off the entire Dungeon Of Doom (minus Luger).

In the end, this PPV falls in a short time period in WCW (from World War 3 '95 to here) where they focused more on the inring product & scalled back the cartoonish gimmicks which resulted in one of WCW's best PPV's.  I would recommend this at a reasonable price.",1219104000,,5180,4.455026455026455
7859139,4,6304031572,"Pretty good.  Here's my analysis:

Hogan vs. Giant; steel cage match- Meh.  Wasn't worthy of being the main event.  It demonstrates how badly the WCW did steel cage matches.

Flair vs. Savage; steel cage match- Flair and Savage were definitely in their element.  Two of the best wrestlers of all time when it comes to the cage.

Brian Pillman vs. Kevin Sullivan, ""I Quit"" strap match- Sadly, the actual match was shortlived after Pillman quit within the first minute of the match.  He was being degraded because of his plans to leave WCW for the WWF.  Luckily, Arn Anderson came in and fought with Sullivan for a little while until Flair came in and decided that Arn and Sullivan should stop fighting and the horsemen and Dungeon of doom should align agains the Mega powers (Hogan and Savage)

Konnan vs. One Man Gang for the US title- I always liked Konnan's matches in early 1996.  Too bad the One Man Gang was crap.  Oh well, Konnan owned.

Johnny B. Badd vs. DDP for the TV title- This was back when DDP was a mega-heel.  Expect what you would expect from a couple of midcarders.

Sting & Lex Luger vs. Harlem Heat- Great if you're a fan of Sting or matches that contain power.

Nasty Boys vs. Public Enemy, street fight!- OM...G, if it weren't for Flair/Savage, this would've stolen the show.  This match was just excellent.  Extremely entertaining... it probably IS the best match.  These two teams had a great feud and the matches they put on were very hardcore and extreme.

Ignore the second main event, and you'll enjoy this one.",1059868800,,1539,4.588235294117647
