5345102,5,B009KU2MAM,"I really love the music of ""The Lords of Salem"" and will buy the soundtrack. The acting in The Lords of Salem by lead character, Sheri Moon Zombie, as ""Heidi,"" is good. There is some beautiful artistic imagery in this movie which highlights the horrific visions of Heidi. Much of the story line takes place in a apartment complex and reminds me of the 1977 horror classic entitled, The Sentinel, starring Cristina Raines, which also takes place in a apartment complex. Cristina's character also suffers from a history of personal problems. Rob Zombie made a good choice having Meg Foster play the role of leading Salem Witch. She did a great job and has an excellent, dark, and foreboding voice.

The Lords of Salem is not a typical psychotic, murder, slasher, type movie. It is really Rob Zombie's first OCCULT horror movie thriller/drama. There is some blood, but not much. There is some partial nudity of Sheri Moon Zombie, who is a very attractive woman, and some frontal nudity of the Salem Witches. Some of the Occult Themes include: A child born of sin, symbol of the inverted cross, the dark Catholic Church, possession/pornography, the Goat, ceremonial satanic music, the eternal nature of evil, rebirth, Christ/G-d as the great deceiver, the dark witches coven, and Satan/Lucifer as the great liberator. One final thing to mention is the usage of a record recording in the main plot of The Lords of Salem. This was done very well and created the atmosphere of a dark Witches Sabbath throughout the entire movie. Not since the 2005 horror movie entitled, The Skeleton Key, starring Kate Hudson, have I seen a record recording used so effectively in the story line of a horror movie.

I highly recommend The Lords of Salem for horror movie fans. Buy it today!!!",1366588800,8,1769,4.8349834983498345
5345103,4,B009KU2MAM,"This film is proving to be a divisive one among critics and fans, but that's to be expected coming from Rob Zombie. If you like his other movies, I'd wager you'll like this one as well. If you are not a fan of Rob Zombie, there's less chance you'll enjoy this, however I'd recommend still giving it a try and not dismissing it outright. When he's in top form (Devil's Rejects) Mr. Zombie can craft unique, high energy works; when he's not in top form (Halloween 2) his work can tend to be self-indulgent, weird for weirdness' sake and needlessly vulgar. Nevertheless, as hit-or-miss as he is, I find it impossible not to love Rob Zombie, due to the clear passion he has for his work, his desire to make something unique, and his obvious respect and love for horror films of all eras.

I'd say this film represents Zombie at his best; he's created a fascinating, horrifying, uniquely creepy ride full of grisly imagery that will embed itself in your brain and stay there long after the film ends. The film is beautifully shot, especially considering the low budget, the score by the wonderful John 5 is ominous and chilling, and the atmosphere evokes the work of Kubrick, Friedkin and Bava.

Now, as I said, this is a divisive work, and you may very well not like it as much as I did; the story is thin, the subject matter is ruthlessly explicit and by the end the plot (such as it is) mostly disappears and the film resembles a long and evil black metal music video more than a movie. Nevertheless, I think this is a beautifully grotesque work by Rob Zombie and I'd recommend all horror fans at least give it a try.",1366502400,88,1615,4.452702702702703

This movie is one of his best ones yet!!! It does start out slow and doesn't really have the fast paced scare the shit out of you scenes in this one. But, this one has a more realistic approach to it. This movie keeps you intrigued because, if you're like me and really believe in spirits and demons, it just keeps you glued to the screen because I could actually believe things like this could really exist!!

5345114,3,B009KU2MAM,"Ok, so no one is going to watch this unless they are a fan of Rob Zombie.
Good stuff: Sheri Moon Zombie plays it straight pretty well. The three sisters (why is it always three? Is it because of MacBeth?) are played by scream queens who are enjoying being scream queens, so they're doing what they do. The ambience is really heavy here, lots of wide shots and visuals that emphasize that you're in Massachusetts, contributing to the slow-burn creepiness. The music is also appropriately creepy.
Bad stuff: The ambience isn't maintained as well as it could have been. There's flashback sequences that could have been avoided with a little more in the introduction. The three sisters aren't given enough to do to establish them as villians. The historian is not a bad character per se, but he is superfluous. All his lines are expository and his part could have been accomplished by cutting his character and using better visuals. The ending felt rushed, and didn't really line up with the direction the film had taken.
As a whole, the movie feels exactly the way it had been written and produced: a good idea that needed more time to develop before execution. Even though Rob Zombie had full control over this movie, he didn't have enough time to really make it work. The production was plagued with funding issues, rewrites, and reshoots. There's still the spirit of a better movie within that carries through but at the same time it also feels like one of those ""what could have been"" sort of films.
Like all of Rob Zombie's films, it's polarizing and if you're a fan of his it's worth a watch. If you're not a fan of his, maybe check out one of his better movies instead.",1516924800,,1673,4.617449664429531

He'll always get some stars from me, but this lacked something. To give you an idea of how I generally rate his work: House of 1000 Corpses was great, gory camp. Devil's Rejects was great in a very different way; though it was technically a sequel, it went its own way into the realm of a violent comedy, rather than than horror, and I loved it. I liked the first Halloween. I liked the second Halloween quite a bit less. This seemed to be an attempt at an art house horror film. I thought the visuals were beautifully disturbing. I have never been disappointed in Sheri Moon's acting; she always does just fine, if not great. However, the plot was lacking, and the lengthy sequences that were, I think, meant to be creepy and build tension, got boring. I still own it, as I will always own Zombie films. And it gets three stars for the attempt, and because it's Zombie. But, sadly, this one is not among my favorites in any category.",1509321600,,1055,4.333333333333333

5345128,5,B009KU2MAM,"It's the 26th of September and it's also Ms. Sheri Moon Zombie's birthday. Not only is she known as the wife of Rob Zombie, but she has played many amazing characters in all of her husband's films. She is an icon and a queen of horror, and an actress who I have so much respect for. To celebrate her special day, I watched one of my personal favorite movies of hers, 2012's The Lords of Salem, written and directed by her husband, Rob Zombie. Sheri Moon Zombie played the iconic psychotic killer, Baby Firefly, in House Of 1000 Corpses, with it's sequel, The Devil's Rejects, and her recently badass character Charley in Rob's 31 (2016). In The Lords of Salem, she plays the good character, Heidi, a rock DJ at a radio station in Salem, Massachusetts. She receives a mysterious record from ""The Lords"", a record which is an ancient curse from the evil witch, Margaret Morgan (played by the legendary Meg Foster), and her coven of 6. It also features Jeff Daniel Phillips, Ken Foree, Bruce Davidson, Dee Wallace, Judy Geeson, Patricia Quinn, Maria Conchita Alonso, and many more. Horror legends, Sid Haig and Michael Berryman have cameos too. Sheri's performance is incredibly intense, with the emotions showing in her character, and I just do not know why some people never give her the credit that we, the fans, know she totally deserves a hell of a lot more. She should be doing more movies than most of the overrated and boring actors working in Hollywood today. Also, a massive comeback for the legendary Meg Foster (John Carpenter's They Live, Masters Of The Universe, Stepfather 2, and Rob Zombie's latest flick, 31), with her mindblowing performance as the main villain, Margaret Morgan. In my opinion, this is Meg Foster's best performance ever. Lords Of Salem is a feature filled with eerie elements, visuals, vivid atmospheres, an amazing soundtrack, etc. It's a slow-paced, shocking tale of horror that was made in a beautiful and artistic way. I know that not many people love or even ""get"" this movie as much as I do, but when you are actually, really in the mood (paying attention, that is), you'll definitely enjoy it; it's a very different and unique film from Master Of Horror, Rob Zombie.",1506384000,,2206,4.762402088772846
5345129,5,B009KU2MAM,"This is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. The script--what the actors say--is the main reason for its scariness.

5345131,4,B009KU2MAM,"Rob Zombie has such a twisted mind. I love it. And obviously many many many more people do too. He creates heavy, solid music and crafts some awesome, intense, twisted films. (which are mostly based off songs by him) I've been a Zombie fan since I was a little boy jamming to White Zombie. I love everything he's put out, Music & Film. I even got to experience his haunted mazes at his Great American Nightmare a few years back which was a month long gig he did at the Orange County CA fairgrounds for Halloween which had heavy live bands play every night and 3 haunted mazes that were designed by him personally.
Anyways, this Movie was interesting. Very dark. Very chilling. Takes a couple watches to understand what exactly the imagery was explaining and what exactly happened. But it was overall a good film. It's actually based off his song ""Lords of Salem"" in case you didn't know. It's nothing like House of 1000 Corpses or Devils Rejects but it's still a must watch for dark evil twisted horror fans as well as Rob Zombie fans like myself.",1503792000,,1047,4.515789473684211

If you truly understand this movie it is evil, blasphemous, a work of art and very old school horror. This is by far my favorite Rob Zombie movie.",1503532800,4,416,4.2784810126582276

5345138,2,B009KU2MAM,"Quite boring.

I hope my taste is getting better as I get older, because a lot of stuff stands out to me now that didn't used to when I was younger.  15 years ago, I would've said ""heck yeah"" to naked chicks in a movie, but now...it's just so forced and lame; it seems like nudity is to filmmakers what cussing is to dumb people; they use it because they can't form a better argument/story, so it becomes filler.

Why do we need to see Sheri Moon's butt?  There's no problem with people sleeping naked, but why not have a sheet over that part of her or something?  Why do we need to see a naked woman in a trance?  There were plenty of other people to choose from that were in the same state of mind.  A good filmmaker can sell the illusion of something without having to provide it.  There were just a lot of unnecessary shots in this movie that didn't do it any favors - but really took a lot away.  I think Zombie fell far short on this one.

I also thought it would've been better to make make the cult a bit more obscure in their beliefs, giving only subtle hints to it aside from their actions and dialogue, as opposed to showing them outright as worshipers of Satan.  Stuff like that is really played out, I think.

All in all this was a really boring movie and tough to make it through.  Both story line and cinematography were lacking, I thought.

I think one could find something better to watch.",1494720000,,1406,4.217228464419476

I was really disappointed since someone recommended it as a twisted horror movie but I did not find it twisted or scary.

There is a lot to like about this movie visually. Then again there is a lot that is visually silly, can cause one to laugh aloud in what should be a tense moment.

5345176,3,B009KU2MAM,"Aside from completely misunderstanding the Salem witchcraft crisis, this film is typical Zombie.  Witches weren't burned in the American colonies; they were either hanged or pressed to death.  Come on!  A tiny bit of digging would have made this more credible.  Also, the chief antagonist of the witches in the 17th century is named ""Jonathan Hawthorne.""  Yes, Nathaniel Hawthorne's ancestor was one of the great witch persecutors, but his name was ""John Hathorne.""  The nineteenth-century author of The Scarlet Letter (to name just his most famous work) added the ""W"" to change his name and distance himself from his infamous great great grandfather.  Zombie could have avoided these silly problems either by doing five minutes of research or by changing names and situations.  Movie seems to revel in filth, not that there's anything wrong with that, but the hatred of women that it exemplifies ignores that fact that men, too, persecuted the witches.

That being said, I've always enjoyed Rob Zombie's films accepting that they will most likely have much more style than substance, much like his musical career after White Zombie. This one bored me. It had a few trademark Zombie moments, but without the over-the-top gore and cartoon sadism, the weak dialogue and meandering story was much more noticeable and to me, annoying. Also, this one felt like it was shot with a low budget (not the campy, fun low budget, just cheaply made). The reason I gave it three stars instead of a (generous) two, is that I know there are many fans of the witch/possession genre and I'm not one of them.

See The Witch if you want a challenging examination of the tensions among genders, religion and good and evil. See this if you want the germ of an idea bogged down in a miasma of Ken Russell-esque imagery that doesn't really have much to do with anything except possibly extending the runtime.

Imagine a poor attempt to replicate the feel of 2001: A Space Odyssey, except with an awful horror movie.  The plot is... I don't know, was there even a plot?  Sure there was a story, but it certainly wasn't enough to fill 1h40m.

I don't know if Zombie was going for a joke or not, but when he shows 'Satan', I basically checked out of the movie (Google it, I think my review might get flagged if I attach an image - what you can't see is in most of the images online is that Satan was only about 2 1/2 feet tall).  Was that supposed to be scary?  I don't know.

And I'm sorry, but I'm going to give a spoiler - NOTHING HAPPENS!  tons of build up, and in the end, it just stops, you don't get to see what happens. The movie ends with a voice over of a news report about a mass suicide, and the disappearance of Sherry Moon's character.  Thanks for not showing us that part.

Anyone who loved Under The Skin, will love this.

I loved this movie and I have watched many many movies. Rob Zombie never lets us down (fans that is). This movie has it's own unique style, themes and indubitable truths all weaved together like a Donnie Darko throwback. This movie uses the atmospheric tension to build upon the recurring theme of satanism and transparency of consciousness in the twenty first century. Most people will not understand the story completely and to be honest, I didn't either to begin with. So I watched it again, read the book and voila! The entire theme behind getting taken advantage of in a weakened state, that ultimately leads to the characters demise by being tucked away to the darkest depths of the earthly dimensions. The deconstruction of nature through empiricism. The portrayal of the immortal figure himself, Satan, is well done as he represents a fallen angel instead of the Hollywood, poltergeist half man/half goat/ half (insert here) demons. Just as Jan Van Eyck revolutionized the Tempera style painting, Rob Zombie revolutionized horror and brought back the good old H.P. Lovecraft cosmicism theme. You know, that ""there is no recognizable divine presence, such as a god, in the universe, and that humans are particularly insignificant in the larger scheme of intergalactic existence.""",1474416000,,1521,5.100401606425703

5345276,3,B009KU2MAM,"I like Rob Zombie. Been a fan since the 90s, love both of his bands, and eagerly awaited House of 1000 Corpses when it was first announced and was disappointed with its two year delay. Loved The Devil's Rejects. Got excited when he ws announced to remake Halloween. Loved every film.

And then he made Halloween 2, which was awful in so many ways. Nobody's perfect, so I just wrote it off and never returned to the film. Buzz around this film was pretty low compared to earlier works. I was interested because the song the film shares a title with is one of my favorite post film debut Zombie songs. But I just never got around to seeing it.

Until recently.

The movie starts off by introducing you to our main character, a female late night DJ in Salem, Massachusetts played by Zombie's wife and permanent female lead, Sherri Moon. Sherri does well in the role, easily coming off likeable. The world gets built for a good 15 minutes or so before things get set into motion when she receives a vinyl record in a wooden box. When she plays it, visions of haggard women, witches from the town's history, flood her mind. She brushes it off and later plays the record on the air, sending most women in the town into a trance when they hear it.

Sounds like it's interesting so far, right? It is. Everything up to this point is methodically slow and in doing so builds up the tension. But this also happens to be where the movie falls apart. It goes into this Rosemary's Baby zone that just goes way over the top with the Satanic imagery and cheapens it as a result. If things had been scaled back a bit and the writing tightened up in the second and third acts, this could have been a really good movie. But it becomes such a muddled mess by the end that I was thankful it was over. This will always be interesting subject matter to me, but oversaturation throughout a film can kill it and actually make things boring.",1471046400,,1915,4.385915492957746

This one started with the poem The Hollow men That talks about what Brings forth the end of the world, and it got me thinking about this movie that I hadn't seen since last Halloween, and had become even more fascinated with then before. But fair warning, this is an Unrated film series called Daughters of Salem a sequel to The Lord's of Salem and is the Darkest movie I've made. But don't let that scare you off!

It's a delight to spend time with these people as they talk s***, listen to music, do drugs and maybe have sex with a 3-foot-tall Satan.

The movie falls apart towards the end, but the ride there is fun, in a queasy 70s Euro-horror by way of a trailer park way. Zombie's typical excessive gore is toned way down, in favor of a general (and generally effective) atmosphere of dread.",1445299200,,613,4.894230769230769

Zombie did something right here, especially the visual and stylistic approach that brings to mind movies like The Exorcist and The Shining.

5345442,4,B009KU2MAM,"This RZ film flew under the radar and is quite different in tone and approach than House of 1K Corpses, Devil's Rejects, and RZ's remakes. I admire it because I heard it uses 0 CGI effects, which is pretty remarkable in this day and age. The viewer should also understand obvious influences for this film: Altered States, John Carpenter's The Thing, and The Shining. LOS tells the tale of witches in Salem, Mass, reconnecting with one of their descendants in modern-day Salem, a radio dj who receives a spooky, creepy record in a wooden box in the radio station's mail. The story is a creepy, atmospheric slow-burner, and some of the imagery of Satan and the witches' cult is pretty amazing. The only thing missing from LOS that I enjoy in RZ's other films is a sense of humor: LOS is very serious, with the exception of a few funny scenes in the radio station, including a jab at the band Rush that's hilarious. I can see why people struggled with this film more than RZ's over the top other films, but if you appreciate creepy horror from the 70s and 80s, and appreciate a film not relying on CGI, and agree that the scariest kind of horror is cerebral, subtle horror, then you might like this.

Unfortunately, I have to agree with the majority on here and chalk this one up to the bottom of my favorites list.  As others have noted, it is heavy on the blasphemy, and scarce on any real substance or cohesion.  On a positive note, you can tell Sherri's a hottie under the dreadlocks and tats.  But that's secondary to the plot that pulls from various films from the 70's and 80's, but does nothing to build on that theme and appears lackluster.  As others have mentioned, why does Zombie never venture into virgin territory with his films?  We need fresh ideas in films these days, not re-makes of classics from yesteryear.  I enjoyed his Halloween films despite the lack of originality, but Lords Of Salem just didn't grab my attention.",1437177600,,846,4.490196078431373
5345454,3,B009KU2MAM,"Definitely different. It kept drawing me in the more I watched it. The imagery is wonderful, the atmosphere is great. The way you can feel the net growing tighter and tighter around this poor girl. Sheri Moon Zombie plays Heidi great. She gives her a lot of life and personality  in the beginning that you can't help but feel for her as the downward spiral begins. I love the image at the end and how it is capped by a happier picture of her.

Slight Spoiler Alert
Even knowing that it is a Zombie movie I couldn't help but hope that something in the fateful hour would come to her aid. Silly me.
End Spoiler

The cons:
 Sheri, near the middle of the movie, just really has nothing to do but look half out of it (which she does well) and desperate(which, again, she does very well). With such a great character it was a little annoying to watch her slide down so rapidly with nary a peep of argument.  The character seemed stronger than that to me.
 Her friends, also, were just dropped at the end. No follow-up was given  on them, not even a mention in the wrap up. It was a little disappointing.
 The pace was very slow, it didn't really build it just stayed at a fairly even pace which I can imagine would turn off some viewers.

I wouldn't recommend to everybody but certain horror fans will like it. It reminds me very much of the seventies witchcraft movies. Horror Hotel (with Christopher Lee) and some of the Italian witchcraft movies particularly.",1435536000,2,1456,4.4232209737827715

I do have to say that I feel this is his best work to date as far as mood, theme and cinematography are concerned. I couldn't help as I watched this film unfold get a Kubrick and Lynch feel, as things were happening finding myself going ""what the hell!?"", as well as its general use of working the camera.
Don't get me wrong though, as much as I liked this film, it is not for everyone. There really isn't a whole lot for scares, but, the imagery is very intense. It makes movies like Eyes Wide Shut, look very tame.
The best thing about this movie, was the music as soon as Venus in Fur began playing I was hooked!
Overall, this is a movie I would say is more for the horror lover, I have a hard time thinking that if you aren't a big fan of horror that you are really going to find this niche movie to your liking.

5345469,5,B009KU2MAM,". . . As I do, then this movie is a fantastic treat. I originally rated this baby 10 stars, but after reading a few reviews I agree on one thing, the story is a bit predictable. Take away that, and this movie to me is everything perfect about cinema. I love movies most when I am attacked with numerous unsettling images and sounds. The scenery, cinematography, atmosphere, color schemes, is overwhelmingly magnificent. Plus, it has more of a plot for the average movie watcher to enjoy then something like House of 1000 Corpses.
This movie is dark and beautiful, and the little details are what make it an outstanding achievement. I love Rob Zombie's style, and this movie succeeded on pretty much every single aspect. It did more to impress me than most of the big blockbusters, and Zombie did it on a tiny little budget. How can you not applaud this work of art?

Loudwire calls this movie ""Rob Zombie's masterpiece"". This is the horrific story of a female radio personality named Heidi(played by Sheri Moon Zombie) living in Salem, Massachusetts which is well known to be a dark magic hotspot(even in real life!). Heidi receives a strange gift from a group called The Lords. When Heidi plays the music she finds she sees the past horrors of the town which opens her up to demon possession. MANY horror movie stars from the past 30 years star in this movie like Dee Wallace(The Howling), Bruce Davison, Jeff Philips, Ken Foree, Patricia Quinn, Maria Alonso, Judy Geeson, and Meg Foster. This is Rosemary's Baby with a modern and HORRIFIC twist! This is...THE SCARIEST MOVIE...I HAVE EVER...SEEN. I have seen everything from The Amityville Horror to Nightmare on Elm St. Everything from The Exorcist to Mama and Insidious but NONE of those others came this close to actually scaring me! This movie is rated R for violence, sex, nudity, drugs, language, and anything else you will find in this type of twisted, Satanic, dark magical, unbelievably frightening type of movie!

Its most definitely not a movie for everybody, and you have to be very patient through it in order to see the pay off. The Lords record that is played really grated on my nerves while watching it.

Sheri Moon gives her best serious performance. There's some disturbing images. I was underwhelmed. Still scratching my head but I'm one of the few I guess.

You'll love it or you'll hate it. This doesn't rate as much as my hate for Paranormal Activity 3 but its not far behind it.

Sheri Moon is a recovering addict to the horse & she works as a Dj with her friend who likes her & Ken Foree as the boss. She receives a copy of a demonic record by ""the Lords""
The story gets crazy when the tape plays it posesses the women of the town,Sheri is haunted by it as she descends into the mouth of madness & the whole town of women get posessed by the tape. There are old ladies in the building that keep her sedated & locked out of this  ""vacant room"" . There is a story of demonic power from an ancient order of satanists.

5345521,1,B009KU2MAM,"I thought this movie was a disappointment.  Everyone who loves this film repeatedly that it isn't for ""mainstream"" horror fans, and supposedly one needs a ""deep love of the genre"" to truly appreciate it, but don't be fooled.

The plot was predictable and rather ridiculous.  Yes, it's set in Salem, and yes, there are witches, and yes, they are coming back for blood.  I swear I've seen a similar plot in 80% of the Bloody Nightmares 50-pack I bought for five bucks.  And there's nothing new in this movie, either.

We have the smart, scholarly guy who figures it out and will inevitably attempt to stop it.  We have the nice-guy friend/love interest who strangely doesn't get any (funny how when the director is the main character's hubby, the main character does not get naked or sexed like every other female character in the film).  We have the ever-troubled yet ever-hip lady who we are supposed to believe was a total junkie at one point and still landed a super awesome job as a late-night shock jock.

Yeah, did I mention she's a drug addict?  That detail seemed to be thrown in for absolutely no reason or real payoff, other than to establish that she is ""troubled"" and angsty.

There are also some of Rob's loveable old chestnuts: mouth rape, ungainly nudity, and images that attempt to shock (but never quite succeed) because, like, he can.  Also, I don't know how many flashbacks to screaming, naked, not-young women (shocker....not) a person needs to watch to get the gist of the backstory, but apparently Rob thinks you need at least five.  (Or maybe they were to pad out the film, my suspicion.)

Finally, that scene where the nice-guy put on the Velvet Underground's ""Venus in Furs"" will have you yearning so hard for Gus Van Sant's Last Days that you will begin laughing.  Hard.  I feel bad for Lou Reed's soul.",1420848000,,1828,4.665625

This movie is nothing more than a compilation of 'oooky' scenes from a number of other, better movies and ,genuinely insults the intelligence of its target audience-  12 year old boys.  Insulting them is no mean feat and that's why it got the one star.
It's gotten so trite with the devil/god thing. In this age of anything goes, why rehash, poorly, an old tired formula?

Nepotism is part of life but I think he might have been better off using a manikin as leading lady.  The clothing and hair and tats tried hard but just couldn't get past that bored junkie/waitress/aging stripper vibe. I'm sure she's very pleasant in real life. I suspect Rod is as well.

I don't know why. The day I watched it was a unusual day. The feeling and the ""vibe"" (sorry a silly term I know!) the movie had on me and how I felt that day stocks with me. For some reason I think back to that day and don't like it or how uneasy I felt while I watched the movie. It just had lots of aspects that were shocking and not something I was used to seeing in a film. Rob Zombie is a smart guy, I may not be a huge fan but he know how to create a film that is unforgettable (not always good!) I get a huge kick out the fact that he always ""showcases"" his wife's rear end in the films she is in. It's a bit too much, but funny. I have to say she is a decent actress.

Sheri Moon is ready to make other movies, horror & beyond. If I had put as much passion into the film as Rob Zombie did, I would give it a re-edit, take some clarifying details from the novel-of-the-film he co-wrote & save some of the special effects, building up to the finale more slowly instead of repeating scenes & effects until they lose their impact.

Rob Zombie is a known fanatic of old, low-budget, cult-classic ""creature features,"" and this is reflected in all of his films and much of his music.  It was absolutely his intention for this movie to be over-the-top, blasphemous, shocking, and even cheesy. I think he is doing a nice job of straddling the fence between cult classic and today's trends.

The entire movie is supposed to take place in the late 70's and half the stuff in the movie breaks from that period. Examples: They didn't have modern day remotes for televisions back then. I never once saw a girl in those days completely filled with tattoos and white girls having corn roll dreadlocks. No one talked about being lactose intolerant or going gluten free. Every time I see the next scene there is something modern that completely breaks the whole image of it being in that time period. It seems Rob's movies are getting worse and worse or he just didn't care enough to make it right. Oh and by the way Mr. Zombie, stop casting your wife in every movie. Is she that bad of an actor that she can't find her own work. Also half the other actors from the other movies you have made. It has gotten ridiculous that I see them in every movie you make now. Either that or you are too cheap to hire other actors out there. Please folks do not watch this movie. The scariest scene is a bunch of naked old ladies dancing around a fire. Rob Zombie has become just another mainstream trash like the rest since his original band left him behind. This movie is absolutely pathetic in my honest opinion.",1406246400,,1293,4.369294605809128

5345646,4,B009KU2MAM,"I ""get"" Rob Zombie's films, I just don't usually care for them. His films are deeply rooted in the dark psychological horror films of the 70's, where the future is bleak and good guys usually don't win... I've got to be in the mood for that sort of thing, and usually I'm not.

I have to admit though that for ""Lords of Salem"" everything I saw and read was SO all over the place that I had to sit down and decide for myself exactly what this thing is. And I think overall, while it does have its problems, I have to admit that I liked it. My wife hated it--but I thought it was entertaining, and it stuck with me more than a lot of other ""better"" films. I love Gothic horror, and I crave novelty. This film has its share of both.

It really does have a ""Rosemary's Baby"" sort of feel to it, but with one major issue: I really have to agree with a lot of these other reviews that Sheri Moon Zombie, at 43, is getting more than a bit long in the tooth for these sorts of roles. She's just too old, heck, it happens to all of us. In ""Rosemary's Baby"", I felt real empathy for the young and victimized Mia Farrow, attempting to make sense of what was happening around her. In ""Lords"", however, Sheri Zombie is really hard to feel anything for at all... I found myself thinking for most of the film that she looked and acted like an ate-up (and selfish) old junkie, so when she went out and finally copped some heroin, I just didn't care.

BTW, people in NA, those who take it seriously at least, don't spend the rest of their time drunk. Call it a faux-pas, you just don't do that.

With that being said, the only other issue I had was the bad CGI of everything melting at the end, during the whacked-out ""concert"" montage. To the film's credit, it doesn't use any [noticable] CG effects up until this point; it's very old-school in it's approach, which I like a lot... so when those effects were stuck in the end, it felt cheap, like a music video or something.

My complaints are minor. The way I look at it, if I put on a film and that film keeps me interested until the end, then that right there is worth the price of admission. And this film did just that. The story, while somewhat clich, kept me engaged. And I like that.",1404000000,,2225,4.1892523364485985
5345647,4,B009KU2MAM,"I am not a Rob Zombie fan.  I thought HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES and THE DEVIL'S REJECTS were indulgent and hopelessly immature, not to mention just plain sadistic.  Saw his first take on HALLOWEEN and thought the prologue shouldn't have taken up a third of the movie.

But I just saw THE LORDS OF SALEM.

I was ready to dismiss it...but...I'm still trying to figure how I feel about it.  I found myself repeating, ""Ooh, nice shot.""  ""Great lighting.""  The cast was excellent and it was good to see some familiar faces.  It was so great to see Dee Wallace, Bruce Davison, and Meg Foster in some meaty roles.  There was some really imaginative imagery as the film progresses.

The film gets more bizarre and surreal but I found it so much more thoughtful and interesting than what I expected.

I hope Rob Zombie continues in this direction with his filmmaking.  This was a bold horror film with strong visuals.  To me, it played like an American take on THE WICKER MAN that draws on shady American history.

It's not so bad it's good. It does have some good music but that's no reason to buy or watch a movie. It's a 70s style movie but it's a 70s style of a really boring movie. Most every scene is dark and by dark I mean there just isn't much light. This is not anything like House of 1000 Corpses or The Devil's Rejects. Those movies were different and fun. The Lords of Salem is just boring. It starts out nice and you can tell there is going to be a slow build but it builds up to exactly what you thought it was going to build up to. No huge plot twist or anything. Maybe somewhere along the line someone told Rob Zombie what kind of movie to make and he came up with The Lords of Salem. Zombie should go back to making the kind of movie he makes. Fun movies with over the top characters that aren't for everyone.

Relying almost solely on the painfully hackneyed christian blasphemy angle for shock value was a total yawn - I guess it might disturb or frighten people who believe in christianity, but they probably wouldn't be checking out a Rob Zombie film, so, what was the point.  Anyway, it seems like the original idea wasn't that bad, but RZ went nowhere with it.  And I'm surprised that they got so many notable Hollywood veterans to perform, but the dialog and plot were so bad, not even those vets could do anything to help save this mess.",1402704000,2,573,4.490384615384615

5345654,1,B009KU2MAM,"This is one of the worst films that I have ever seen. The genre is horror, but the best word to describe this mess is horrible.  The story plods on and on in a confused way. The characters are completely flat and unbelievable. Religious viewers might be offended by the misuse of religious symbols. The casting director managed to find some of the least attractive extras appearing (naked) in a film. It was interesting to see Judy Geeson (To Sir with Love) again in a supporting role.  For me the only bright spot was hearing The Velvet Undergrounds  All Tomorrows Parties with Nicos distinctive voice at the end of the film. My best advice is to avoid this movie. If this type of story appeals to you, I recommend a similar but much creepier film, Horror Hotel (""City of the Dead""), made back in 1960. Even with its primitive special effects, this Hammer film is superior and even has Christopher Lee playing one of the main characters.",1401667200,3,938,4.604790419161676
5345655,1,B009KU2MAM,"I just finished watching this movie, and although I found it completely insulting to my Wiccan beliefs, I decided to put that aside and attempt to enjoy the movie for what it's worth.

I did like Sheri Moon's character in the first half of the movie, but her character's pov seems to switch to the three sisters in her apartment building and everything you take away from Moon's character comes off as flashes of bizarre imagery. At this point I couldn't care less what happened to her. I cared about Bruce Davison's character the most. I did like her boyfriend and the other DJ but the movie never expanded their characters beyond to the point of some people who were ""just around waiting for Heidi"". The movie itself feels like they ran out of ideas and decided to wrap it up early and edit in some dysfunctional imagery to expand on the horror.

Overall I think this is one of Rob Zombie's more original films, but there's nothing I can take away from it that would force me to think beyond the message of the movie ... If there was one. There was no awe-inspiring moment, no jaw-dropping conclusion. Nothing, except horror and revolting death revolving around a paranoid delusional view at commercial witchcraft. Or even worse, the views of what a fundamental Christian society would confirm through a warped and idiotic mind of Rob Zombie.

But, over all I think Id rather just watch ""9th Gate"" again, at least there was a little more of a plot ... and less naked old women, Im not referring to Sheri Moon with that last statement, with in the first 10 min of the film a bunch elderly, nasty, dirty looking dark age witches get naked and true to all stereotypes, dance around a camp fire ... or what ever you want to call it.

5345665,1,B009KU2MAM,"Ahhh, where to begin?  My husband is a huge fan of Zombie, and even though he heard the horrible reviews, he decided to give it a go. What a waste of our time.  This movie is nothing more than an artsy-fartsy shock film.  It's interpretations are awful, the story progression is inexplicable at times, and the acting is so dry, I felt I needed a glass of water just to swallow it.

Now, onto the insulting parts of the movie.  If you are a dabbler in occult arts, or witchcraft, you may be mentally bludgeoned by the straight blasphemy of the entire film.  I know I was insulted with the depiction of Satan/Lucifer (he looked like a chubby dwarf/baby/goat thing), and I am flabbergasted as to why there was a Sasquatch in a room with a neon cross.  I mean, I get that they're trans-dimensional beings and stuff, but c'mon...  If you want to see a bunch of middle aged women dancing stark naked around a fire, this is your film.  Not only that, but they appear naked in almost every scene!  Huzzah!  You can also check out faceless priests jerking off with multi-colored jelly dildos!  I mean, who WOULDN'T want to watch this piece of 'art'?  And just wait until you see the anti-Christ.  I couldn't tell which end was up, and I am pretty sure Cthulhu is looking for it's spawn.

The flash scenes are hardly shocking (more like expected) and most of the time are scattered and make little to no sense whatsoever.  Literally halfway in, and I was begging to watch a different movie.  I despise gore, but I watch these types of movies with my husband.  Even though there WAS gore in this movie, it wasn't as emotionally disturbing to me as other movies.  I think the dryness of the acting contributed to the non-believable aspect of it.

Of course, it seemed that the flashes of gore are the remnants of Zombies past, trying to scream for resurrection from this vile pit of filth they were dropped in.  (This movie, of course)

But my husband is stronger than I.  He pushed through to the very end, hoping for a light at the end of this never-ending tunnel of drudgery.  Alas!  There it was.....we were saved.  The credits began to roll...and for the first time in two hours, I was actually excited.",1397952000,16,2196,4.482323232323233
5345666,4,B009KU2MAM,"Easily Zombie's most ambitious film to date, The Lords Of Salem is much more restrained than his past efforts. After a promising directorial debut (House of 1,000 Corpses) and an impressive follow up (The Devils Rejects) Zombie had some growing pains when he took on Halloween 1 & 2.

The Lords of Salem is like nothing the director/writer has done before, it plays more like Rosemary's Baby than any of the more brutal films he has helmed. This time Sheri Moon Zombie is the star, but as always Zombie loves to find familiar faces to use in key and small roles, this time we get Bruce Davidson, Meg Foster, Judy Geeson and Dee Wallace.

Unlike Zombies past films which punch you in the face from the moment they start, ""Lords"" is a slow burner with ominous music and dread. Lots of nightmarish imagery, but a lot less gore.

The DVD has a nice transfer, but not a whole lot of extras. It' may not be every Zombie fans cup of tea, but I was happy to see a different type of horror film from the man.",1397606400,2,999,4.360215053763441

It actually had beautiful visuals and it was much less ""trashy"" than his other films. The tone is great; it feels like Rob Zombie took an old horror film and amped everything up. It was very disturbing. If you like horror films, you should watch this. If you like Rob Zombie, be prepared for something much different than usual.",1395187200,3,926,4.722222222222222

5345680,3,B009KU2MAM,"Actually, its not about religion in the general sense of the wordmore specific, pretty obvious.  However, Im glad in the beginning of the movie Bruce Davisons character differentiates between Wicca the earth religion and witchcraft, which is comparable to delusions, madness, etc.  This is a horror movie, but it could have been more shocking.  I think Rob Zombie held back.  Beyond the scenes of nudity, religious symbolism, blood, and other content solidifying the films R-rating, I took this films message to heart.  The John Hawthorne character wanted to kill the Lords of Salem for being wicked in the eyes of God, and then a similar fate occurred to his descendent, Adelaide (Heidi) and the daughters of the other bystanders who supported Hawthornecompliments of those three women, which made me think of the three witches from Shakespearean plays.  As usual, God gets the brunt of everybodys anger and is blamed for the fallen nature of man.  People aren't the problem.  Its ideologies like superiority that are the problem.  I started thinking of all of the people that have been hurt by people doing and saying things in Gods or Jesus name.  What a shame.  I apologize on behalf of their ignorance.  While I don't believe we have to pay for the sins of our fathers, we do need to apologize when things have been done in the name of a deity that had nothing, nothing to do with that deity.  At the end of the film I was left with the thought that violence begets violence and where does it end?

And the almost love story was a nice thing to hope for.  The male character tried to be the knight in shining armor (albeit too late) for Heidi in scenes.  I'm glad there were not close ups--too intimate.  Zooming/panning the camera out was better to take in the environment/atmosphere of the scenes.  I thought the dialogue between them was real and it held my interest.  I liked that part where he showed mild irritation of Heidi talking to another man and she told him not to be jealous.  I thought it was cute.  I believe Mr. Zombie could write a romantic comedy someday if he wanted to.  Anyway, thats my review.  Thanks for reading.",1393027200,3,2142,4.668449197860962
5345681,1,B009KU2MAM,"What the hell is wrong with Rob Zombie? I get that the guy grew up on Heavy Metal and old black & white Horror movies, but there is twisted and then there is insane. The things that must be going through this mans head, that encouraged him to write something like this, is the true definition of horrific. The film follows a radio DJ in Salem, Massachusetts, who has been seeing some strange things. One day a weird record shows up at the station and the DJ plays it on the air. The seemingly innocent record becomes the most requested song on the station, but not without consequences, as it posses the local female population. I am a fan of his music, so I know how strange and twisted Rob Zombie can be, but even I have my limits. Following one of the best horror films I've ever seen, The Devil's Rejects, I was really looking forward to Zombie's next project. That film was a good story, with strong characters, and an amazing ending. This film is pure garbage, meant to shock and disturb audiences, and it does a very good job of that. From nude elderly women, spitting blood on babies, and opening gateways to hell to scary psychics and beast like creatures running around in the dark, this movie is full of things you just never want to see. Rob's wife, Sheri Moon Zombie stars and the once beautiful, up and coming star of the Devil's Rejects, is now covered in tattoos and looks like she hasn't eaten in months. Her performance is flat and unbelievable, adding to the mountain of manure that this film is offering. I love Horror movies and I love weird stuff, but this was just above and beyond freaking weird. I should have turned the film off when nude witches were spitting blood on babies, but I didn't, I stuck with it and I'm sorry I did. I don't know if I'll ever be able to get some of the horrific images out of my head.",1392768000,5,1839,4.364431486880466

The soundtrack is great, the visual effects are great and the performances are great. I would put this film right up there with Suspiria, The Exorcist and The Omen.

However, it's very slow paced & again Zombie cast his wife in the lead role. Yea she's good looking but not that great of an actress. After sitting thru almost half the movie with nothing but good visuals, stuff starts to go down, but it's a decent payoff.

5345687,1,B009KU2MAM,"I appreciate the fact that Rob Zombie has a love of horror both modern and classic, and thats what makes this review sad to write.  After seeing The Lords of Salem, and Zombies two ill-fated Halloween remakes, you have to wonder if this is the same guy who directed the depraved but entertaining House of a 1000 Corpses and its sequel The Devils Rejects.  If Zombie was looking to leave an impression on viewers he certainly succeeded.  The sight of a half dozen fat, naked elderly women has definitely left me scarred for life.

The Lords of Salem gets its fuel from the infamous Salem Witch trials in the 1690s.  Zombies wife Sheri plays Heidi Hawthorne, a distant relative of Reverend Jonathan Hawthorne who presided over the witchs executions.  Heidi is a recovering drug addict and co-host of a local talk radio show along with partners Whitey (Jeff Daniel Philips) and Herman (Ken Foree).  A strange wood box arrives for Heidi at the radio station containing an album by a band known only as The Lords which they quickly dub the Lords of Salem.  The strange, rhythmic music has a hypnotic effect on several women of Salem who become almost entranced upon hearing it.  The music is also heard by a guest on their radio show, Francis Matthias (Davidson) a local writer who penned a book about the Salem Witch Trials.

After hearing the music, Heidi begins to experience terrifying visions.  She investigates a supposedly empty apartment in her building where she finds a neon crucifix and sees a hag-like witch named Margaret Morgan.  Heidis visions become more and more alarming, causing her to slip back into drug use and miss work.  Whitey attempts to help Heidi but runs into opposition from Heidis landlady Lacy and her two sisters.  As Heidi descends further and further into madness, a concert by The Lords of Salem becomes the stage for a ceremony for the witches to summon Satan with Heidi as the covens leader.

The Lords of Salem is as about as disjointed a film as I have seen in some time.  Its a rambling wreck of incoherent scenes completely lacking in logical narrative.  The film is like one of those 1970s Satantic themed movies as if it were written by a 10 year-old on hallucinogenic drugs.  Zombie borrows liberally from films like Rosemarys Baby and The Sentinel but without a shred of those films style and horror.  Zombie is also wildly off with his facts about witchcraft trials and executions in Salem.  Witches were hung, not burned.  One of the presiding Judges in the case was John Hathorne, not Hawthorne.  The early American writher Nathaniel Hawthorne was related to the judge and added the w to his name in order to distance himself from his notorious ancestor.  Perhaps this is nit-picking on my part but at the very least, Zombie could have got the history correct.

Sheri Zombie has appeared in all of her husbands films but in supporting roles.  Here she is asked to carry the film almost entirely and she is simply not up to the task.  Shes emotionless and lacks charisma and spends much of the film mumbling her lines even in the scenes where she is not supposed to be under the influence of drugs.  Oh and when shes not mumbling and stumbling about, Rob makes her feign performing oral sex on a priest.  Nice

 I will credit Zombie for featuring several 1970s and 1980s horror stars like Ken Foree, Meg Foster, Dee Wallace, and Michael Berryman.  But its just a shame that they all show up in such a disaster of a film.

5345720,1,B009KU2MAM,"The Lords of Nothing

A woman, who is a radio DJ and also the descendant of a man who executed suspected Witches during the time of the Salem Witch Trials in Salem, MA......encounters some strange occurrences and things further develop from there.
Heidi (Sheri Moon Zombie) is a DJ at a local Radio Station in Salem, MA.  The movie starts off ordinarily enough, introducing you to Heidi's daily life as well as Heidi's co- worker's and landlord, etc.  However not long into the movie, Heidi receives a mysterious box containing a record from a little known band known as ""The Lords"".  The record is then played on the air during Heidi's radio show.  There is not much actual music, rather mostly weird distortions and nonsensical vocals that seem to have no point whatsoever.  However the sounds do have a very profound effect on Heidi.  As the movie further progresses, Heidi (a former drug addict) has a relapse and things seem to fall apart.  There are further weird and unexplained occurrences involving Heidi, a guest who appeared on one of Heidi's broadcasts, as well as Heidi's landlord and her Landlord's two sisters who just `happen' to be visiting from out of town just when things are starting to really get strange.

That's about all I can really say about the plot or movie without really giving too much away, however the sad truth is - there is not really much at all TO give away about the movie!

I had considered for a while buying this movie on Blu Ray brand new, even at a regular retail price if I had to - because it was a Rob Zombie movie and I have loved what I have seen him put out....UNTIL NOW.

 I was very glad that I did not actually buy this movie, and that I instead rented the movie on PPV.  The movie had no real point or plot to it so far.  No real attempt at any kind of special effects or even just cheap makeup done correctly!  The movie was not scary, nor entertaining in any way, shape or form.  There was no point whatsoever to this movie. No structure, no explanations, just one confusing scene after the next with no point whatsoever in the vast majority of scenes in the film.

Did Rob Zombie intentionally make a bad film as a way to get out of a contract with a film studio?  Even so, how a man such as Rob Zombie with such incredible talent and potential could put out such a poor quality product is very puzzling indeed.

Most horror films are not very good, however there are usually at least some good moments in the film or some great special effects and so on......this film had neither of those nor anything with any redeeming entertainment value whatsoever.

I don't want to get too specific for those who have not seen the film.....but there is one sequence where Heidi has an encounter with what is supposed to be something non human......
That sequence, scene....whatever you call it was so bad I really struggled to force myself to watch the rest of the movie.  I debated for a moment even calling my Cable Company and demanding a refund on the PPV charge for the movie.

I was very disappointed to see such a scene from a film involving Rob Zombie, who is someone I still have a lot of respect for - though I will be very skeptical of his next movie.  I hope Rob Zombie wakes up and gets back to making great horror films again, as there are not very many directors out there anymore who are even capable of making a great horror movie.

If you must see this movie for yourself, fine....I had to see it too despite the bad reviews I had read......however do not buy this movie!  Rent the movie if you must see it, or better yet watch it for free if you get a movie channel or whatever that happens to be showing it, etc ,etc, etc.

Take a look on imdb to see just how many people were involved in the making of this film.  If this had been a small film made by Rob Zombie's friends and family....I could understand and I would be more forgiving about how bad this movie turned out to be.  However this was actually a much bigger production than a lot of other Horror movies which are far better usually have......there is no reason whatsoever this film should have turned out as poorly as it unfortunately did.
Of course with a filming budget listed as only 1.5 million......that does explain a lot - but for that amount of money there is still no excuse for the movie to have been as bad as it was.  The movie focused on things it could in no way achieve with such a small budget and in turn was horrible beyond belief.  Instead of reaching so high, they should have had a much better script and focused more on the actors and actresses involved and then the film may have been amazing.

5345729,4,B009KU2MAM,"I'm here to defend this film. I will agree with many reviewers that not much happens until Act 3, then it gets flat-out surreal. But why are people so hung up on that? This may be Rob Zombie's most artistic film yet. It does become basically a Zombie music video by the end, but guess what? I LIKE THAT.

Is there a plot? Only a thin one. Do I care? No. Zombie is trying some new techniques. The camp and splash are still there for sure, but he has some understated, quietly building horror as well. By the end, he's clearly inspired by Kubrick, pairing classical music with hugely spacious, opulent sets in which the characters are intimidated to the point of cosmic despair.

Is Sherie Moon Zombie an adequate actress? She doesn't need to be. Her lines aren't great, nor does she have many of them, but she holds her own. She's not there to be breasty or stark-raving mad. She's not Harley Quinn, which is basically who she played in House of 1000 Corpses. This is, believe it or not, Mr. and Mrs. Zombie's ""quiet"" horror film (again, the Kubrick inspiration).

As far as casting, Zombie outdoes himself by going beyond the genre-savvy stunt casting of his previous films and getting better genre actors. Dee Wallace (the mom from E.T. and Critters, the lead in The Howling) and Patricia Quinn (Magenta from the Rocky Horror Picture Show) are phenomenally good in their supporting roles as motherly witches and do the most with their lines. Are they good witches or bad witches? You'll have to watch to find out. Meg Foster and Bruce Davison also give strong performances, though Ken Foree's presence in the film is wasted.

In the director commentary, we learn how many challenges Zombie had in making this film. I wonder how much better it could've been if he'd been able to retain little nuances like the scenes of Sid Haig and Michael Berryman, or ""Frankenstein vs. the Witchhunter,"" a film-within-the-film a la ""Werewolf Women of the SS.""",1386374400,3,1945,4.678362573099415

If you're like me and are getting tired of the same formula for horror being repeated over and over again you should check this out. Anyone with a weak stomach however should probably skip this one.

5345755,2,B009KU2MAM,"Where to start? First and foremost I believe Lords of Salem to be easily one of the worst movies Zombie has ever done. It does not begin to approach his best work. The Devil's Rejects and both Halloween remakes are light years ahead of Lords in nearly every important critical aspect. THE PLOT? It's feels completely derivative. In the vein of other better and more respected films like Rosemary's Baby, Servants of the Twilight, The Wicker Man, the Skeleton Key and the Omen, this script simply never builds any meaningful momentum. THE DIALOGUE? Unimpressive to say the least. The writing wasn't clever or inventive and was not elevated by the WOODEN ACTING that accompanied it. Zombie forgoes genuine scares and brooding tension in favor of  visual gimmicks centered around arcane symbolism and blasphemous imagery. When used properly these would normally be an acceptable means to achieve an absorbing, atmospheric film, especially for this subject matter. However, despite copious amounts of nudity, blood, profanity, weird lighting techniques and an occult themed heavy metal soundtrack, the movie felt dull and uninvolving. Seriously, there are some TV shows that capture the look and feel of this genre much more convincingly than Lords of Salem does. If you're a Rob Zombie fan and can't resist the urge; go ahead an rent it but please, do not buy it.",1384041600,,1360,5.071428571428571

5345757,3,B009KU2MAM,"I've read another reviewer aptly describe Rob Zombie as the best horror director who has never made a great film. It's a clever description that I think has a ring of truth to it. Zombie really does have a unique, somewhat visionary approach to horror. Everything from the music he chooses to the way he cuts and splices scenes together, and even to the sequencing of the opening and closing credits has a flare that is truly his own. The trouble is that he seems to have difficulty translating that flare into a coherent and cohesive finished product.

The Lords of Salem isn't the polished, fully realized film that has eluded him, but it is definitely a step in the right direction. It's a film that shows Zombie honing and refining the traits that make him a good filmmaker. He's (almost) entirely dropped the relatively corny red-neck/white-trash aesthetic that has permeated his past work in favor of a more subdued, muted, and foreboding tone. There's still that characteristic layer of grit and grime over the characters and their surroundings, but it's no longer quite as cartoonish and feels mostly grounded in reality (or at least until it jumps headfirst into the avant-garde horror wormhole).

And as he dialed down that hokey characterization, he's simultaneously dialed up his visual craft. This film really looks quite stunning. It has an almost Kubrickian obsession for symmetry and slow-panning, meticulously composed wide-angled shots. It actually takes a lot of nods from The Shining as well, emphasizing tight corridor shots as well as title cards for the days of the week as the film progresses. The greatest achievement of the film is its ability to use these filming techniques to create very surreal, haunting moments and set-pieces. The lighting is absolutely fantastic as well and creates a ton of different atmospheres and textures (orange flames, yellow fog, red neon crosses, blinding spotlights, glowing stained glass etc.)

As I alluded to before though, this film isn't quite the true culmination of Zombie's filmmaking gifts. It definitely suffers from some pacing issues and although his typical corniness is greatly subdued, it isn't entirely absent. There's also a little too much time devoted to a relatively uninspired, investigator/historian character that ultimately goes nowhere. And although many of surreal scenes here definitely succeed in being very haunting and visually striking, occasionally he does cross the line into frank absurdity that takes you out of the moment and stops you from completely taking it seriously.

At the end of the day, Lords of Salem is definitely a Rob Zombie film through and through both in terms of strengths and weaknesses. Thankfully, Zombie has seemingly identified his strengths and successfully focuses on them enough to mostly outweigh his weaknesses. He isn't quite there yet when it comes to creating a film that is the full package, but he's definitely on the right track. I'm excited to see him further explore this abstract, artistically-minded style in future films.

5345758,5,B009KU2MAM,"THE LORDS OF SALEM is Rob Zombie's entry in the ""satanic panic"" sub-genre. As such, it scores quite high. Mixing elements of the psychedelic, the semi-pornographic, and the horrific, Zombie deviates from his usual formula of ""white trash"" lunatics committing random violence (which works well for his other films). The plot of LORDS develops slooowwly, mingling reality w/ nightmare imagery. Then, hell is unleashed in Salem, as a coven of witches, led by Meg Foster (THE STEPFATHER, THEY LIVE), heed their master's call. The atmosphere remains bleak and sinister throughout, while the chaos builds. In this way, it is similar to Ti West's HOUSE OF THE DEVIL. It also has a wicked, hallucinogenic quality like Dante Tomascelli's SATAN'S PLAYGROUND. Toss in some Kubrick, Argento, and a twist of Polanski, and you get the general idea. Anyone expecting HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES, DEVIL'S REJECTS, etc., could be very disappointed. If, instead you have a craving for a filthy, dirty, utterly blasphemous, eeevil movie -the way devil movies are supposed to be- then this is a masterpiece! Even Sheri Moon Zombie plays her pivotal role w/ subtlety and understatement! TLOS is Zombie's ode to all things hideous and ghastly.

5345763,4,B009KU2MAM,"If Stanley Kubrick, Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci got drunk and decided to make a horror movie together, Lords Of Salem would probably be close to what youd get. Even back in the White Zombie days, rocker/director Rob Zombie has always shown a heavy influence from movies, especially horror so, its no surprise to see such influences in his films. And this time, Zombie sheds the 70s grind-house style that his earlier films have had and goes for something that evokes the work of the previously mentioned filmmakers and also some of the 70s occult themed flicks like the infamous Mark Of The Devil. To a degree, it is Zombies most solid effort as director but, also his most experimental as Lords gets downright head trippy and surreal at times, especially in its last act. If you liked his dream sequences in Halloween 2, theres lots more where that came from. Todays impatient audiences weaned on cookie cutter horrors and endless sequels may not appreciate what Zombie has done here but, to me it was a disturbing breath of fresh air. In a time of CGI phantoms and overused jump scares, I really like that Zombie had the courage to make something that aims to simply unsettle and disturb you with its atmosphere and imagery and doesnt rely on cheap scares and elaborate post production hocus-pocus. Lords tells the creepy story of late night Salem DJ Heidi (Sheri Moon Zombie) who receives a wooden box with a record in it from someone referring to themselves simply as The Lords. When she plays the vinyl album she suddenly starts to have increasingly disturbing hallucinations and her life starts to spiral out of control. When author Francis Matthias (Bruce Davison) begins to investigate, he finds that an ancient evil in the form of a devil worshiping witch coven, once burned at the stake, may be returning to Salem and Heidi might be key to their vengeance. Director/writer Zombie tells his disturbing tale with a deliberately slow burn yet, never at any moment does he ease up on the atmosphere that something sinister and very wrong is going on here. Whether its the haunting visuals that he fills the film with or the excellent use of Griffin Boice and John 5s score which evoked Fabio Frizzi and Goblin at times the film oozes atmosphere and keeps us involved even if the films narrative flow doesnt always follow a tradition path. And as for the visuals, they range from haunting to shocking and as disturbing as they can be, they are also beautiful. This is certainly, at the very least, a visually striking film. And despite all the shocking imagery, I actually feel Zombie showed some restraint at times which made the horror elements all the more horrifying when they arrive. And Rob is not the only Zombie to watch here, Sheri, who proved she had some acting chops as Deborah Myers, is again very effective here as Heidi, a woman with emotional troubles and past bad habits who is being drawn into a living nightmare that she is not equipped to fight. Jeff Daniel Phillips is also good playing one of the two Hermans who DJ with her, a man with feelings for Heidi who tries to help her without knowing the true cause of her emotional down-turn. And Zombie also peppers his film with genre vets like Ken Foree (the other Herman), Meg Foster, Sid Haig and the effectively spooky trio of Dee Wallace, Patricia Quinn and Judy Geeson as Heidis neighbors, who are more then they appear. Overall Zombie has created his most interesting work yet and one that won't appeal to everyone. It evokes a type of horror in the vein of Argentos early films or Fulcis The Beyond, that they don't make anymore. But, thats why I liked it so much. Zombie remembers a time before the MTV generation when horror films took their time to draw you in and had loads of atmosphere. He also knows, like those films, that there is a time to shock you too, and he does that well. And finally, he knows that sometimes the best way to make sure you leave the theater spooked is to not wrap everything up in a neat little bow and thus leave you looking over your shoulder when you are home at night. I would recommend this film highly for those who don't mind a slow burn and a splash of avant garde with their horror. Not perfect but, a really spooky flick for those that can appreciate it.",1383696000,,4279,4.6094364351245085

From the goat clearly not caring even a little bit as Sheri Moon Zombie mimes riding it, to the blowjob scene, to the absolutely ridiculous mutant baby tentacle thing, to the dildo masturbation this movie is a right riot.

In all seriousness though the movie is unintentionally funny, and tries to borrow way too much from older better films like Rosemary's Baby, and The Shining. It almost succeeded too it has some atmosphere and build up rarely seen in today's trashier horror films, but unfortunately the unintentionally hilarious writing, and the haphazard shoving of every religious taboo you can think of into 101 min. drops this movie from being potentially ok to downright silly. However I wholeheartedly recommend this movie because it is so silly and fun.

This one is barely any better. Some of my major complaints is that Sheri Moon Zombie is the lead in this and I think she really sucks at acting and needs to stop being in Rob Zombies movies just because shes married to the guy, second there is just so much randomness in this movie that just doesn't make any sense to me at all and makes me wonder why its even in the film to begin with. The only answers I can think of is because this is suppose to be some kind of art house movie and/or the images are just thrown in to shock or something but I think it takes away from the movie and makes it look dumb. Hopefully Rob Zombie can redeem himself someday but right now he is not that good anymore. What a shame.

There are a lot of bad reviews on this movie and I really don't know why. Compared to horror movies today this was great. They don't make good horror movies anymore and this was needed.

I feel there were a number of things I missed upon first viewing since there is often so much going on in the shadows. The film is beautifully photographed, and some have compared the more surrealistic sequences to Dario Argento's ""Suspiria"". The film often has a very theatrical quality reminiscent of Argento's film with its striking lighting effects. The weak link may be Moon Zombie who is an okay actor but seems rather uninteresting and somewhat unconvincing as an actress. I watched ""The Conjuring"" just after watching this film and thought ""The Conjuring"" was a much more frightening and flawless film with consistently strong acting, but unlike ""The Conjuring"" I do feel I want to watch ""The Lords of Salem"" again simply because overall it is a more audacious and interesting film.",1382572800,,873,4.865771812080537

It's not scary, it's not creepy, and there -might- have been 5 whole entertaining moments in the movie all together. One of the minor characters, the author, was infinitely more interesting than the main character or her friends or enemies. It felt like Zombie tried too hard to go all artsy-fartsy on this one, and the resulting movie was a total disaster.

I kept watching. And watching. And watching. I was waiting for the precious moment when things turned, when this movie actually became something other than a total waste of time. It never came.

5345813,2,B009KU2MAM,"I missed the opportunity to see this in theaters so, I immediately bought the DVD and got a few friends around to watch.  I was very excited.  Lords of Salem however, turned out to be disappointing for me.  The story isn't as strong as it could be.  It's not convoluted per se but, tries to be a little bit more cryptic than it actually is.  While there is no question that Zombie and crew are capable filmmakers, Lords of Salem just falls short.  Cinematically, it has a lot of attention to detail and allure.  Although, once you have seen one camera dolly shot of a hallway at a snail's pace, you've seen them all.  Since the hallway is the conduit between Sherri Moon's apartment and her nightmares, this shot happens all too much...  The film builds and builds at a very slow pace but, never has the pay off we were looking for.  At some point things that were (I imagine) meant to be a bit alarming or creepy, came off as more comical.  The film has a much more comical view if you look at it as a character study doc about what happens to you when you turn to a life of being a juggalo... You become a very fundamentally unlikeable person to some people around you and eventually collapse.

Sherri Moon Zombie did a very good job in Zombie's Halloween remake.  She wasn't the highlight of House of 1,000 Corpses but, a more tamed version in Devil's Rejects was much more tolerable.  While she is a capable actor, I think it's time we see another leading lady for a Zombie story canon.  I personally am getting a little tired of seeing her bare backside inexplicably every chance we get and Lords of Salem was not her best performance.  While the cinematography stands out here, it goes off the rails with some very strange surreal sequences that are strange because of their stylistic choice and not for their content.  At one point the film breaks out into music video territory.  The score and sound design are all great and the rest of the cast deliver some really great performances albeit some are indeed, over-the-top.

Zombie paints a great picture here but sadly, the meaning of it is not as enjoyable to sit through.  I hold out high hopes for every Zombie feature that comes our way because he is an exceptionally smart and stylistic storyteller.  Lords of Salem will have to rank with the likes of Halloween II and The Haunted World of El Super Beasto for me.  If you enjoy Zombie's films, than you will find something to enjoy here.  If you feel his entries in the cinematic world have been a little spotty, then maybe pass this one up and wait for something a little more stellar to come along from old Rob.",1381881600,,2626,4.459119496855346

5345818,4,B009KU2MAM,"In many respects I guess I had a lot of expectations for this film. The promo I had seen was well edited, and was very likely put together by the studio. To the basics: the Blu-ray + DVD plus ""ultraviolet"" combo is mostly a great idea; the Blu-ray give you lots of space, and I was expecting a lot of extras. The DVD is a nice bonus if you want to see the film on a different unit. What still drives up The wall is the UV download, or more to the point the ""stream""; I registered at one stage and tried to get this ""UV""
running but the two biggest frauds are firstly there is no file to download, and secondly there is a limit on how long you have access to the so-called cloud version. The one really nice thing I liked about this combo pack was the hologram cover: very well done, looks great.
 So for the most part Rob zombie seems to have progressed a lot. Stylistically the visuals in about 60% of the film work very well, and I like what he has done since it conveys what I think is a unique vision, and definitely a unique narrative. I suspect that some people will find the disjunction between the real and the unreal somewhat hard to deal with in the way Rob zombie has edited this together. I am primarily a fan of Rob's work from his music, and some of his music videos have definitely shown some
visionary styles. It's hard to tell from the commentary just how Rob is trying to present this to people watching his work since by his own admission he seems to put things together in a kind of ""decopage""[sp?] Technique where he says in the commentary that there is a montage of elements but the connection from the original Salem trials up to the events in current time sometimes fall apart it seems. I really hate to say that because I buy Rob zombie's CDs and DVDs to support his work from my point of view as a fan. But when he has a huge Blu-ray and all he can bother to throw together is commentary, and fortunately feel a little let down. In the commentary Rob talks about some of the side stories with different characters that he thought might've been good but he did not film them, or if he did he has not let it be known. In some cases it sounds like there may have been a lot of deleted scenes, or alternative material, and I would've liked to have seen that on the Blu-ray. Also, he talks about different actors having fairly unique
reactions to some elements in the film, and even how some of the name actors could not get along; well, it would've been nice to have some interviews with these people, and see what they have to say about the experience. As much as I have enjoyed seeing the film, I feel like he could've packaged more into the Blu-ray. I wish I could give a five for this combo but it feels like I shelled out close to full price to something which they could've easily packaged for under $12, and that's just my pecuniary complaint, if
they had added in some making of features, design features, interviews with Sid Haig and other Rob zombie film regulars, as well as an interview with the wonderful Barbara Crampton, maybe the price would have been worth it.",1381622400,,3099,4.2793867120954

I did like it a little bit it was entertaining in some parts but it was a little bit confusing as well. I would have to say that the witch's costumes were good. the story was pretty weird I guess that's what he was aiming at. it was not what I expected it to be but all in all it was okay and I probably will buy just for my rob zombie movie collection. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you don't unless you are a hard core zombie fan then give it a shot,1381104000,,758,3.8037974683544302

Dear rob zombie,

That sucked. As a fan of house of a 1000 corpses and devils rejects I am extremely sad and hurt that you subjected me to that. I stuck it out. Stuck it out through the bad acting, the big foot devil, and the midget baby monster in hopes that it would at least end on somewhat of a good note... but... it most certainly did not.

Which is why I regret to inform you that I am revoking your production license until such time that you submit your next script to me for proofreading.

I guess after House of 1000 Corpses, Devil's Rejects, and the Halloween movies, there is a certain expectation going in to a Rob Zombie film, so maybe that is where some of the negative reviews come from. This is a throwback to early horror films, a time when it didn't take buckets of blood, cheap jump scares, ""instant gratification"" to thrill and scare an audience. I thought the atmosphere Zombie created in this and the sense of dread he instills in the viewer was phenomenal. The way it gradually builds up throughout the movie, I thought it was very well done.

If you are a fan of older horror films, you owe it to yourself to watch this one. You will love it. Don't let the overly negative reviews fool you.

The rest of the film was a jumbled mess of imagery (farm animals, bigfoot, a neon Jesus, squid babies,
bad dental practices) and boring, aged hipsters, trudging through their predictable lives.

Zombie's muse & Wife, Sherri Moon, was a constant source of distraction within the film, because every
second she appeared on screen, i just wanted her to wash her hair.
Those dreads were more threatening than the shrieking witches summoning Lucifer!

The film itself plods along, at a snails pace, going in all the obvious directions.
Zombie, who'm i do enjoy as a director, seemed to be going for ""atmosphere"" on this one, but
clearly, his skills are better utilized in more graphic displays.

The filming is dark and sometimes grainy and colors are muted. There are a lot of surreal images, symbolism and some images that may be too over the top sexual for some. So, it is not a movie for everyone.

The overall atmosphere throughout this movie is creepy and tense. In some ways, it reminded me of Rosemary's Baby, one of the first American films to follow the European style of horror. Lords of Salem has that same slow pace and build up that manages to create and maintain a sense of foreboding and suspense. There is even the creepy neighbor, played by Judy Geeson, who is reminiscent of the Ruth Gordon character from Rosemary's Baby.

5345863,2,B009KU2MAM,"The problem with Zombie is this: in his effort to create shock value, he creates no shock value. Basically, if you've seen one Zombie film, you've pretty much seen them all.
His strength is in cinematography and lighting techniques. In that respect, this film sort of reminded me of Argento films (namely ""Susperia""). This aspect was (almost) enough to keep me interested. In truth, I finished watching the movie because I dished money out for it.
Zombie fails in creating likeable characters. He consistently puts his wife (Sherri Moon) in roles that exploit or demean women. If we are not raving lunatics with guns and knives and homicidal fathers, we are too stupid to live and join Satan worshiping witches covens who sacrifice babies. I'm not personally opposed to dancing around a fire in the buff, but it's highly unlikely I'd do it with the intent hooking up with Satan. In fact, I have a pretty colorful group of female friends of all faiths (or no faith at all) and not one of them would be inclined to have sex with Satan and give birth to a baby octopus. Speaking of which...an octopus? Really?
And then there's the whole burning of witches in Salem thing. I dabble in fiction. I get it, but fiction does not mean that you can just randomly change history. Those accused of witchcraft in Salem were hung and, by the way, there were no witches in Salem. One lady may have practiced Voodoo, but that's not the same thing.
I wanted to like Sheri Moon's character, but couldn't. The two guys she worked with at the radio station were okay, but the character development wasn't quite there. The other characters were predictable. Oh wait...you mean I wasn't supposed to know that the three ladies downstairs were witches too?
I get that his characters are fringe characters. They are supposed to live on the outskirts of society. I think, however, repeatedly telling the same story over and over again gets old.
Lastly, let's talk about Satan. One of the most fascinating things we read in college is ""Paradise Lost"" because for a while, we are duped into joining Satan in a hero's journey. We actually sort of like him until we figure out that he's really just a big phony. He is dynamic though.
I wish people would stop taking that character and doing stereotypical persona of him. Think, oh ye writers in Hollywood. Satan's ugliness came from within. Nothing says he's ugly on the outside. Nothing would ever indicate he's a short little man who looks like a troll and inseminates women through long protruding tentacles. If the goal was to create a little Satan baby, would it not have been better to make Sherri Moon's character more easily seduced by a being who looks like a young David Duchovny?
I know there were some people who really liked this movie and I have no problem with that -- or them. This is simply one opinion and in the greater scheme of things, means nothing. I know that too.",1380412800,,2908,4.659533073929961

It is slow, but the pace fits perfectly into the movie.  Sherri Moon Zombie is perfect in her role as a former junkie, late night radio shock jock.

Zombie creates some very interesting imagery in the movie and there are no over the top gotcha scares that seem to inhabit every other horror movie made today.

Modern audiences don't realize how scary and shocking satanic cults and covens were back in the 70's and 80's. Stories of baby sacrifices, ritualistic murder and black masses were covered in the news a lot. Hollywood ran with it and made some very scary and well, not so scary movies. RZ tips his hat to scenes, actors and actresses as well as quotes from some of the best vintage devilish horror classics. Beautiful cinematography and Rob Zombie's signature dark artistic visions make this a film I will revisit often. Mercyful Fate fans will notice a lot of lines from ""Don't Break The Oath"". The story also references the Devil's Quatrain: the once forbidden chord that Black Sabbath embraced and Heavy Metal is indebted to.

Possible cameos and nods may include:

 Magenta from Rocky Horror as the palm reader, ""The Manitou"" may have been the inspiration for the ""being"" in room 5, the witch burnings harken back to ""Black Magic Rites"", the LP magic: a possible nod to the 80's films ""Trick or Treat"" and ""Halloween 3"", and I believe I heard Jello Biafra doing a voice over during a dream sequence but I could be mistaken....",1380240000,,1199,4.7272727272727275

5345876,5,B009KU2MAM,"Rob Zombie's The Lords of Salem is incredibly unsettling. In my opinion, it is the crowning achievement of Rob Zombie's cinematic career.

Zombie's films have grown on me over the years. I first saw House of 1000 Corpses upon its initial release, and at the time, I didn't think that it was anything particularly special - but I kept returning to it. I'm not exactly sure why. There was just something about the inherent, unapologetic campiness of it that kept me coming back for more. It was a mess of a film, and it appealed to me precisely for that reason.

The Devil's Rejects was released shortly after that. I missed it in theatres, but rented it on DVD. I couldn't make it through the entire film on my first attempt. Sure, Zombie was paying homage to some of the great grindhouse films of the seventies, but this film was relentless in its brutality. At the time, it was unwatchable for me. Years later, I sat through the film in it's entirely and was surprised by how good it actually was, even though it still made me squirm.

Along came Zombie's re-imagining of Halloween in 2007, and I loved it. While I missed the subtle, nearly gore-free nature of the John Carpenter original, I knew going in that we were dealing with an altogether different animal in Zombie's version. It was shocking and visceral, providing a back-story of Michael Myer's tortured childhood. As he did in both House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects, Zombie populates the film with willfully ignorant, aggressive rednecks, ramping up the discomfort level. All in all, Halloween was an absolutely terrifying thrill ride, featuring an unusually touching performance from Zombie's wife, Sheri Moon Zombie.

Halloween II was an unfortunate misfire, inspiring lots of unintentional laughter with none of the intensity of the first installment.

However, nothing could prepare audiences for what Zombie was going to do next.

The Lords of Salem opens in Salem, Massachusetts on a gloomy night in 1696, as a coven of six witches hold a satanic ritual in the woods, led by a woman named Margaret Morgan. They disrobe, dance around the fire, roll around in the dirt, and shout blasphemies. Meanwhile, the Reverend Jonathan Hawthorne plots their demise in his journal.

We then dissolve to present day in Salem, as a local DJ, recovering drug addict, and descendant of Jonathan Hawthorne named Heidi (Sheri Moon Zombie, dreadlocks and all), receives a mysterious vinyl album from a band named The Lords.

Heidi and her boyfriend take the record home that night to listen to it. As the needle touches the vinyl, the music begins, flooding the room with an eerie jumble of ominous music and strange incantations. Almost immediately, Heidi begins to hallucinate. She experiences visions involving the murder of an infant, an evisceration, and sexual assault at the hands of a deranged priest - as well as strange apparitions which appear in her apartment.

Speaking of Heidi's apartment, it is almost unbearably claustrophobic and eerie. Her landlord is an older woman with two strange sisters who seem all too interested in Heidi's comings and goings. Heidi also notices a dark figure at the end of the hall in room number five, which, according to her landlord, is vacant. As the hallucinations become increasingly intense and sacrilegious, Heidi's health begins to decline. The women of Salem are also overcome with a sort of hypnotic spell, after one of Heidi's co-workers plays the Lords album over the radio.

Heidi gradually begins to realize that certain forces are plotting against her and using her as a vessel to bring about an unspeakable evil. It all leads to a horrifying and unforgettable finale that left me speechless.

The Lords of Salem is one of the best horror films of 2013. It is a no-holds-barred experience, and if you are sensitive to satanic material, then you should avoid this film like the plague. It was almost too much for me, and I like to think that I've seen it all. There is imagery contained within that will shake you to the core, especially if you are not prepared. Other films tread lightly around the subject of witchcraft and devil worship, providing only enough exposure to remove you from your comfort zone and advance the plot. Rob Zombie holds absolutely nothing back, making this one of the most effective horror films of its kind, featuring a totally committed performance from Sheri Moon Zombie, who shows some incredible range here.

Zombie has obviously been influenced by Kubrick, Polanski, and Lynch here, borrowing from some of the greatest minds in the history of cinema. At the same time, he has created something uncompromising and quite unique that hardcore horror fans should not miss.

The Lords of Salem is a major success for Zombie as an artist. He has set the bar pretty high with this film. If you think that you can handle it, see it.",1380153600,2,4885,4.869879518072289

The main character (Rob's wife) acts horribly in this film which when coupled with the massive amount of time spent on her character development; is a waste of the movie. The foundation for a which curse ""reviving"" itself in modern Salem COULD have been a nice climax, however, upon realization of the plot variables..... no final slaughter, no real impact to the town, and no actual horrific death until the final credits that you would expect from a flick from Rob Zombie.

Possibly marks are to be given on some artistic presentation on ritual and satanic worship, but again, no real intriguing in-depth dive into the occult simply a superficial Wikipedia overview of the Salem trials.

Could have been done better on Character development, witch trial historicity, occult behavior, climactic fruition of the setup of the movie and even a cliffhanger at the end might have been nice. Several un-answers questions but no reference to a follow up.

A familiar yet outside of the box artsy horror masterpiece, that Years down the road, will be appreciated on a different level than his previous films. Rob Zombie is an elite horror film director and The Lords Of Salem is an excellent horror movie, fog thick with atmosphere and drenched with indelible images that do for me exactly what a good creepy movie should do, and that is, to make me forget all about the sometimes harsher realities of real life and at the same time appreciate them when the movie is over.",1379635200,3,1204,4.738095238095238

And it can't be my attitude, because I sat down to watch it, all primed to love it.  I even admire Sherry's acting, where I've met many people who trash it.  She played such a great ""annoying twit"" in Ho1KC,  she played a great deadly little vixen in Rejects.  She played a good, ""Down and out Mom doing the best she can with what she's got"" in the first Halloween movie.  So, I was interested in seeing where she would take this role.

Her acting wasn't bad, at least I didn't think so.  But the movie was just... awful.  I can understand and appreciate that Rob makes the movies Rob wants to make, but he should remember that his audience are the ones that are going to go see them and buy them.  It came across like one of those movies that if you asked Rob, ""What the heck did THAT mean?"" he'd say, ""What did it mean to you.""  No, Rob, the movie isn't good enough for that.  I get the plot, I really do, I just don't get how you tried to show us the story.

I didn't appreciate the whole ""Is this taking place in modern times or in the late '60s, early '70s?"" game either.  At first I didn't mind it, it was sorta interesting.  ""Oh, so maybe that's the radio's shtick, to act like it's the '60s, and even their receptionist must dress like it's the '60s.  And maybe Hedi just really digs the '60s and that's why she dresses like that. It's kinda cute that they have all this '60s stuff and then you suddenly see the coffee maker, which is clearly quite modern.""  I was enjoying it, until Hedi's co-Dj mentions that his Grandmother is a product of the The Great Depression era.  Huh?  No, that is MY generation's grandparents and I'm in my mid '50s.  These people are supposed to be in their late '20s, to early '30s, their grand parents, at the earliest, would have been mere children during the depression. If the movie had desperately needed this character's grandmother to be a product of the Great Depression, I would have forgiven it, but it was a total throw away line.  It served no purpose other than to give a time of reference.  He could have just as easily said, ""My grandmother grew up in the shadow of WW2."" Or even, ""I had tuna fish for lunch.""  It just came across as an attempt to be overly clever.  ""Oh, now I'll throw THIS line in and really mess up the time line.""

If you liked the movie, I'm glad.  I wish I had liked it.  It's been a long time since I found a movie I really liked and wanted to see over and over again.  I was really hoping this would be it.",1379635200,,2610,4.170340681362726

There is a lack of clear story and you have to think that Rob wants this to be a thinking artistic movie.  You have to figure it out a bit on your own.  There are intense visuals but sometimes they are just silly.  Other reviewers mentioned Bigfoot and the sweet potato baby and these are some of the things that detract.  Perhaps Rob is trying to show that hell does not fit any form and is totally obscure compared to what we consider normal.  Perhaps he was just relying on shock factor.  The movie seems disjointed and just when you think it may be intriguing then there is the scene of Matthius meeting the book author and having the plot of the film given to him (and us).  Only the author sophomorishly dismisses the most important part about Satan's Spawn.

The movie is slow moving at first but picks up.  You have to watch to decide if it's an artistic ground breaking film or if it just wants to be an artistic ground breaking film that tries to hard.

I wax excited and intrigued by the synopsis of this movie.  It seemed that he was branching out to something more original than taking the classic movie Halloween and putting his unusual ""alternate universe"" spin on the movie, and ybe tired version of evil, demented family in creepy house going on a killing spree.  Not so.

This movie could have been so much better.  It just seemed to lose steam.  I found the ending to be abrupt and confusing.  I was grateful for two things ; the ending of a disappointing movie and the fact that Sherrie Moon Zombie did not cackle hysterically and annoyingly through the entire movie.

Wish I had better things to write about this movie.  About the only things that I liked about it was Sherrie Moon Zombie's sweet nature and her hair, bizzare as that may seem, and the love from afar relationship that she had with her fellow disc jockey.

I thought the main actress was good, and there were engaging moments, but I spent the entire film waiting for it to heat up into something that was truly scary. It didn't. It was artistic, the graphics were very good, and it had eerie moments, but not scary, and most of the movie was too slow to even draw you into the satanic aspect of the film. If you enjoy movies that have creepy graphics and themes delivered artistically, you might enjoy this movie. If you begin a horror movie as I do, expecting to be put on the edge of your seat with anticipation of what is going to happen (or behind it hiding), or at the very least horrified by the sheer tormented nature of the story, then this film will fall short. Satan's spawn was reminiscent of the creatures in Tremors, and I believe Tremors had more scary moments than this film did. The characters were largely undeveloped. The movie moved too slow. The witches cackled and danced around naked, but never crossed the line from gross and psychotic or horrifying or terrifying. I did not know enough about the characters to care much that they lived or died, and I never cared that the main character was taken by the witches, as she didn't seem to care too much either. There was no tension in the story at all. No sexual tension between the main character and the man who seemed to appear and disappear randomly throughout the story, and who simply walks away when the modern witches shoo him. No tension or good versus evil struggle in the main character, she just blobs along until she is impregnated with satan's spawn and shortly after, the movie is over. My favorite part is when she walks of her own accord into Room 5. Her painted face along with the way she appears in the shot, is the most pleasing moment in the movie; no wonder it is on the cover! This movie left me floating from sleepiness and a wish to go to bed, to thinking it might finally start to build into something scary, back to being sleepy.

5345909,4,B009KU2MAM,"(Maybe even 4 and a half stars? Dunno, seen it once but have to watch it again) This is a horror movie for horror movie fans with sophisticated tastes. If you like Satanic-Supernatural themes with a generous dose of WTF?!?! moments (did I just really see THAT?!) then you should enjoy it. It is like a demented fever dream where scandalous happenings of past and present meld together.

HOWEVER, if you're looking for a BOO-Fest of predictably timed jump-scares, or if you need your Hollywood horror plot points spoon-fed to you or require mindless murder of young, plastic, talentless ""actors"", then skip this one; it's over your head. But make no mistake, there is enough gore and grotesqueness (and blasphemy!) to go around.

It starts off a bit slow, but once it gets rolling there is no turning back!
Rob Zombie is well-schooled in horror and takes off where some Satanic classics (Rosemary's Baby, The Omen, The Church, The Devil's Daughter and To the Devil a Daughter) left off. He brings this genre of horror up-to-date... in a way that would've made William S. Burroughs proud.

It could have stood a little more time / work put into it (as R.Z. himself admitted in some interview I read); but given what Rob Zombie accomplished given the time / resources he had to work with, I think he did a really nice job. It's rare to get a film like this made these days; one where the filmmaker is given so much license to do whatever he wants to do (and not what the bo$$es tell him to do). Great performances. Sherri Moon Zombie is FINE as Heidi; but the lion's share of plaudits must go to the witches themselves: Patricia Quinn, Judy Geeson, Dee Wallace, Meg Foster ... WOW! Really great actresses! I'm not familiar w/ J.Geeson but she is marvelous as the landlady Lacey. All of them (Witches) are worth the time / money of watching this.

But what the Hell is happening at the end?!?!? Maybe best we don't try to figure it all out, it's meant to be a dark fantasy of evil and it's power, and not supposed to make any rational sense. But I would say it has an ""Assumption of Maria"" vibe, but more like the ""Consumption (Descent) of Heidi"" frozen in Satanic icon. Gonna have to watch it again.",1379462400,2,2196,4.537878787878788
5345910,2,B009KU2MAM,"I have actually just finished watching ""The Lords of Salem"" (TLoS) this evening.  I have been curious ever since I saw the original artwork at UHM.com, and I finally caved in tonight and payed the $3.99 rental fee.  We live and learn, right?
  As an avid watcher of Horror Movies; and having watched more than I can possibly count; I'd like to think that I'm fairly good at picking out what is and what isn't good in any Horror Movie.  It's not always easy; sometimes, a movie has a lot going for it and fumbles in the final moments; sometimes, what looked to be a flop turns itself around and becomes a classic.  Going into this, I thought it likely that it would be at least somewhat challenging to decide what I really thought at the end.  Some of the clips looked promising, and yet there was this inherent undertone of ""Witchcraft = Satanism"" (stars and stones, it's not as if we've seen that before), and so it looked as if my rating would be a tossup between the Horror elements winning my heart and the ridiculously cliched premise coating me with apathy ...But, it seems, Herr Zombie took pity on me and chose to make it easy: he made a terrible movie (well, at least a bad one).
  I suppose it's worth saying what IS good about this film prior to ripping into it; after all, what fun is it to kill a starry-eyed little productions hopes and dreams if one hasn't at least dangled the possibility of flight tantalizingly in front of it?  Some of the shots and scenes are quite effectively constructed and initially lend a great deal to the atmosphere of the film.  Several times, I was tempted to poke fun at the incredibly thick characters (oops, getting ahead of myself) only to be distracted by a clever camera angle or well chosen vista and caught myself saying, ""hey, that looks pretty cool.""  On top of that, there are almost constantly scenes involving the nudity of a ludicrously filthy old woman that help to inspire discomfort and a certain aura of unease; but I suppose that should have been a tip-off.  After all, if the scares of your movie have to revolve around a certain character wiggling their wizened bum around on screen and moaning about Satan, you probably don't have much to go on - and how true that is here.
  I won't bore you with details.  Some chick is tied up - because of that fiendish assailant, genealogy - with this secret cult of devil worshiping nutters which harkens back to the days of the of the Salem Witch Trials, and she is inevitably drawn in and turned into a Satanic sex-toy.  I suppose the fact that it DOES go back to ""ye olde days"" is supposed to somehow legitimize the affair; as if this movie and ""Rosemary's Baby"" are kids in the schoolyard arguing about who got here first, and whether or not that means that they get to take the other's favorite spot.  The whole thing is quite straightforward, and if you couldn't predict where it was going from the first 5 minutes of the film then you probably enjoyed it a lot more than I did (hooray for you).  Bad music plays here; barely glimpsed dead lady is placed there; various classic (read: ""clearly ripped"") ""evil"" or ""Satanic"" images pop up there; and Satan is played by Oswald Cobblepot.
  What the film (and Zombie (what kind of name is that?)) does not grasp is that what takes place just isn't scary.  Unsettling sometimes?  Yes.  Disgusting sometimes?  Yes.  But if I wanted to see loosely connected, popularized Satanic imagery and cupfuls of blood, then I could have just gone to a Gorgoroth concert and had done - no pretension there, I can promise you that.  Even the fact that characters interact fairly well fails to make up for (a) them being about as intelligent as the goats that show up from time to time (perhaps to help with contrast); and (b) the total lack of clarity in what happens.  Actually, it's that last part which gets me the most: for a film that seems determined to show as much as it can (as if we'll be scared by it thrusting scary things in our faces and shouting ""boo!""), it seems just as determined to make sure that, in the end, you know a fat lot of nothing about what actually happens.  ""What? that's it?"" I said.  ""You don't even tell us what this OBVIOUSLY EVIL event accomplished?""  One of the few upsides to living in the age of the Modern Horror Movie is the fact that they don't leave us hanging with those dopey ""or DID he die?!"" conclusions that just make you wonder how anyone more clever than a potato-peeler thought that would give you nightmares.  But this movie goes back to ""ye olde endings"" AND displays all of the bad habits of our generation's scary movies - like you were unfortunate enough to pick up your least favorite things at a ""Buy one crappy thing, get one crappy thing free"" sale.
  In short, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but fans of Rob Zombie who think that everything he does is worth owning.  If you were missing that certain special ""Satanic-themed"" something this Halloween season, just go buy Slayer's album ""Reign in Blood"" and then watch an actually good Horror Movie.",1379376000,,5062,4.5131578947368425

No rhyme or reason for telling this persons story.  The make-up was interesting, the sound was good, I think John 5 could have done a better job with the music; I know him personally and he is an awesome guitar player but this fell flat for me.

5345919,5,B009KU2MAM,"Rob Zombie has long been a name synonymous with horror, and for very good reason.  Any horror fan worth their weight in blood knows that Zombie has given us some terrifying modern-day classics.  His latest film, THE LORDS OF SALEM, takes us on a bit of a different ride, although the central horror elements are still present.  And while this film is a change from what we are used to seeing from this master of horror, it is still vastly entertaining and worth checking out.

I can't tell you just how much I was looking forward to this film.  Rob Zombie has been one of my favorite horror directors for a decade now, ever since I caught HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES back in 2003.  I knew then that Zombie was destined for horror greatness.

THE LORDS OF SALEM is not what I was expecting, but it is an excellent movie nonetheless.  I've read some reviews that didn't like it, saying it was way too artistic and not scary enough.  I disagree; Rob Zombie brings horror to a new level with this film, blending a skillful concoction of art with horror, much like Argento's SUSPIRIA or Kubrick's THE SHINING.

This film is shot well and the acting is superb.  I continue to be impressed with Sheri Moon Zombie and her acting ability; I hope to see more of her in the future.  Meg Foster, Dee Wallace, Judy Geeson, and Patricia Quinn give amazing performances as well, which greatly accents the terrifying situation Moon Zombie's character finds herself in.

The storyline in THE LORDS OF SALEM is what truly wins me over.  The plot is a thick combination of urban lore and history, which does nothing but lend credibility to the movie's gothic overtones.  I do not want to say anymore, because I do not want to ruin anything; this is simply a movie that you must see to appreciate.

THE LORDS OF SALEM is a definite win for me and I highly recommend giving it a look.  Fans who already enjoy Rob Zombie's work should be impressed, and newcomers will definitely want to check out more of his films after seeing this one.  Be sure and watch it on Blu-ray, as the HD picture and sound quality are tough to beat.  The film is available now.",1379289600,3,2126,4.475324675324675

But all in all the cinematography was much more thoughtful than any of Zombie's other films. Really nice to look at while the story was interesting though not strong. There wasn't enough stamina for a full feature length film, but it wasn't terrible.....just not all that exciting either.",1379289600,2,536,4.826086956521739

I will tell you this though, hardcore fan or not this movie is a complete disappointment. Its 101 minutes of sheer boredom that comes off looking like a  film students school project then a season pro. Its like he watched the entire Stanley Kubrick, Roman Polanski film library of the 60's and 70's and thought ""If it worked for them I'll just copy that!"".",1379203200,,532,4.428571428571429
5345925,1,B009KU2MAM,"I am all for daring to be different, but this is not different, this is just plain bad. I get that Rob Zombie is different, he's dark, he's sick, he's depraved and twisted, but he is also a Director, so that type of hype only gets you so far before you are expected to prove to people you are talented at Directing ""good"" films.

First of all, The House of a 1000 Corpses was Rob Zombie's first movie and even though it wasn't perfect I still gave him the benefit of the doubt just because it was his first. Despite it being clear that he was ripping off the Texas Chainsaw Massacre trying to put his own little spin on it. Plus, the acting was horrendous.

After that, he moved on to The Devil's Rejects which was supposed to be the sequel to the first movie, but way better. It was better, and I liked it even though I knew it wasn't going to win any awards. Plus, the acting was still bad.

Then he goes on to show us his vision with the Halloween movies. This is when I was certain that he had finally ""arrived"" so to speak. I loved... loved... loved what he did with Halloween. He had finally won me over. The acting was great!

Alas, we have the Lords of Salem which I couldn't wait to see, so I thought I was in for a real treat. I was wrong! The problem is that he tries to go for shock value, and sometimes it works, but sometimes it doesn't, and this didn't work at all. Even if you put aside the fact that his premise about the Salem witches returning for revenge is a plot that has either been made reference to many times before, and is just another vastly overused plot at this point in time. What about women being forced to carry and bare Satan's spawn? I can think of several movies off the top of my head right now that is about the exact same thing. What about the empty rooms with no tenants even though the lead character swears they've either heard, or saw, someone in the vacant apartment? Does any of that sound familiar? It should.

With that said, where's the shocker? There is nothing new about any of this, so I fail to see what others find so impressive. I get that he tried to create a creepy atmosphere, but the Sasquatch...really! Are you kidding me? That's the best he could come up with. The only thing this movie did have going for itself was Sherri Moon Zombie, although, she looked like she needed a shower the entire movie. I think she has really blossomed as an actress though, and she shouldn't just confine herself to only starring in her husband's film's. Don't get me wrong, I like to keep all the profit within my own camp as well, so I totally get it, but her and hubby have to do better than this or she may not have a choice.",1379203200,4,2672,4.2109375

5345929,4,B009KU2MAM,"Heidi (Sheri Moon Zombie) is a friendly recovering addict and a very alternative-meets-Bohemian-looking Salem radio DJ. She is anonymously sent a box containing a record inscribed ""the Lords.""

Heidi plays ""the Lords' greatest hits"" on the air--which sounds like playing a death metal band's record backwards--and women across Salem become possessed instantly over the air ways.  Francis Matthias (Bruce Davison), an author, witchcraft historian and guest on Heidi's show chatting about the Salem witch trials and how witchcraft is a psychotic practice, is a little apprehensive about the Lords' song.  Francis tasks himself with investigating the ""Lords of Salem,""

Written and directed by Rob Zombie (Halloween 1 & 2, House of 1000 Corpses), this movie aims for gravity and an artistic journey into Heidi's possession and why she was chosen.  One device which Zombie uses differently than most masters of horror is nudity.  We see a lot of nudity, but often not on women you'd find ""sexy"" as they are occasionally older, heavy and/or filthy, nearly corpse-like in some cases.  Neither one of Zombie's typical gore fests nor a cookie cutter teeny bopper horror film in which brutal death is prescribed by premarital sex or underage drinking, Zombie set out to really make a film.  Great lengths were gone to capture powerful shots, eerie transitions and haunting lighting.  At times Zombie's attempts to be dark and artistic were overdone by a hand not yet sufficiently practiced behind the camera.  But I appreciate what he tried to do and his less elaborate attempts (generally in the first and second acts) felt effective.

You can't get too critical over this film.  You need to let go and take the ""trip,"" because increasingly psychedelic is exactly what is produced before your eyes and ears.  I feel that Zombie clearly had difficulty tying together an adequate ending from an otherwise very effective serious of weird events.  Even though I had no clue where these events were leading me--and, evidently Zombie didn't really know either--they had my attention and interest, making the ending all the more abruptly disappointing.  At least the ending really only takes about 10 minutes.

If you know Rob Zombie's work, then you know that pretty much everything stars his wife and shows her fun parts.  Neither of these are bad things.  I've been generally please with Sheri's acting and...her ummmm...you know.  But one thing I love about Rob Zombie beyond his vision for horror is how he loves to cast horror icons.  We get horror cameos galore, over 20 in fact, including Heidi's cohosts Herman 'Whitey' Salvador (Jeff Daniel Phillips; Zodiac, Halloween II) and Herman Jackson (Ken Foree; Halloween, Death Spa, Dawn of the Dead), along with Dee Wallace (The Howling, Cujo, Critters), Meg Foster (They Live, Leviathan, Masters of the Universe), Nancy Linehan Charles (Bram Stoker's Dracula, The Stepfater), Bonita Friedericy (Paranormal Activity 3), Andrew Prine (Witchouse II: Blood Coven, V: The Final Battle, Amityville II: The Possession), Richard Fancy (Species, Spellbinder), Michael Berryman (Weird Science, The Hills Have Eyes Parts I & II), Judy Geeson (Inseminoid), Sid Haig (Galaxy of Terror, Creature), Barbara Crampton (Re-Animator, You're Next, Puppetmaster), Clint Howard (Halloween, House of the Dead), Udo Kier (The Theater Bizarre, Mother of Tears, Iron Sky), Camille Keaton (I Spit on Your Grave, The Butterfly Room), Richard Lynch (The Sword and the Sorcerer, Puppet Master III: Toulon's Revenge), Silvia Moore (Chillerama), Maria Olsen (Paranormal Activity 3), Michael Shamus Wiles  (Hellraiser: Inferno, The Puppet Masters, Puppet Master 4), Lisa Marie (Sleepy HollowMars Attacks!), Maria Conchita Alonso (Predator 2, The Running Man) and Daniel Roebuck (John Dies at the End, Final Destination).

I am generally pleased with Zombie's body of work and this represents an important step for him.  He has sidestepped shock and awe in lieu of character-driven story development.  That didn't go well from start to finish in this case, but he certainly had my attention and interest beyond the first 60 minutes.  His attention to lighting, Sheri's acting and a lighter approach to intensity make me eager to see what he does next.",1379203200,2,4257,5.2804154302670625

The sheer polarization in these reviews actually hints at this movies eventual cult status, and I personally feel Rob Zombie knew exactly what he was doing and how people would react to this creation and really didn't care.

It was plainly obvious from the first fifteen minutes that Rob did not want to do the ""traditional"" horror movie.  No, this was a historical film about a generation crossing curse cast by the head of a coven of witches as she was executed in Salem.  There was plenty of eeriness, tons of atmosphere, and lots of character building.  You got to understand who Heidi is, and why she is the one that the witches waited for.  You get to understand the character motivations.

Rob also took no easy paths when it came to filming the way the christian church would be mocked and mimicked in satanism.  Just wait until you see the seated priests.  I found myself saying ""damn...wow Rob...you're not gonna be popular for this..."", the scenes were highly effective and drove the point home.

This is a film for someone who wants to be rewarded with investing time in a story.  It is not for teenagers looking for a date movie, or those looking for a quick bang for their buck with regards to gore and ""horror"" as it is traditionally regarded.  It is very clear that Rob had complete creative control in this effort, as it was his most expressive effort I've seen.  The imagery was simply amazing.

5345957,3,B009KU2MAM,"If you know me at all you know that I am a horror fan. I've written about enough horror films and talked about how much I enjoy the good ones but take to task the bad ones for being just that, bad movies. Of course the horror genre has also had its share of so bad its good films too, but for the most part bad is just bad. This week's release THE LORDS OF SALEM doesn't fall into that category but for me it didn't reach the status of classic either.

The story revolves around Heidi Hawthorne (Sheri Moon Zombie), a local DJ who with partners Herman ""Whitey"" Salvadore (Jeff Daniel Phillips) and Herman Jackson (Ken Foree) have the hottest show going in Salem, Massachusetts. A combination shock jock, funny folk and music playing trio they're on late night and garner great ratings. One night as they're leaving the station Heidi is told she has a package, an oddly made box that contains an album in it by someone calling themselves The Lords.

Heading home with Whitey the friends have dinner and get stoned then put the album on. Immediately Heidi begins to go into a trance and have strange visions while Whitey experiences nothing. From that day forward Heidi continues to experience odd things, especially while dreaming. Most of the dreams center on the room at the end of the hall in the house her apartment is in. The landlady, Lacy Doyle (Judy Geeson) tells her no one rents that room but the dreams make her believe otherwise.

The next night they have a guest on the show, an author named Francis Matthias (Bruce Davison) who has written a book on the witches. As his piece on the show ends, they play the album on the radio station and it begins to affect women all over Salem. Could this somehow tie in to the witches seen during the films opening sequence where they were attempting to bring for Satan?

Matthias, hearing Herman call the group the Lords of Salem begins to worry. He's read that name somewhere in his research. Digging deeper he continues to seek answers to his questions, eventually going to Heidi's apartment only to find her gone but Mrs. Doyle and her two sisters Megan (Patricia Quinn) and Sonny (Dee Wallace) there. How they tie in becomes apparent early on but just what happens before the end of the film is a bit disturbing.

On the good side I will say that this is a brilliant looking film. It seems as if no budget was spared in making it and several shots in the film are magnificent to behold. They're like nothing seen in a horror film lately, at times reminding me of THE SHINING. I'll give director Rob Zombie credit on this issue mainly because I was afraid after his last several films that he'd turn into a one note director with a penchant for showing slummy looking houses and people in every film. Here he clearly steers away from that and comes up with a visually appealing film with images that may stick with you. Another great thing is the acting with all involved turning in solid performances. Horror stalwarts like Ken Foree (a great guy if you ever get the chance to meet him), Michael Berryman and Andrew Prine all get screen time that they deserve more of.

It's those images that are the most disturbing. Don't go in expecting a slice and dice killer flick or a monster of the week here. The movie deals with the issues of satanic rituals and witches that are involved in dark arts. Most sequences involving the witches have them completely nude and covered in something vile. While I was at first angered by the amount of negativity in the movie that seemed desperate to cling to the edgy rock and roll attitude of Satan spewing head bangers I slowly realized that the movie went no deeper into that area of story than ROSEMARY'S BABY did 45 years ago. If that movie bothered you than this one will take you over the top.

Zombie uses slow pacing to his advantage here, allowing the story to unfold rather than be rushed. It gives him time to play out the images that he's chosen, disturbing though they might be to most people. Each and every actor here turns in a believable performance in this unusual setting.

I can't honestly say that I loved or hated this movie. It will take a second viewing to decide. Horror fans will flock to this film for the name recognition of Zombie alone. Some will watch it out of curiosity. For those willing to take a look keep in mind what you're getting into and know up front that the more tame viewers will be shaken up.",1378944000,3,4429,4.486352357320099

It was a mistake having Mrs. Zombie play the lead role.  She's been great as a co-star in the past RZ movies, but she clearly can't carry the weight of a film as the lead.  Sid Haig and Michael Berryman were wasted in the film...all they had were lame roles as witch hunter helpers who had no lines.

All the feeling of this film is created with very little traumatic gore indicative of Zombie's other films, which I did not like. Obviously he has grown in artistic spirit and zeal, as well as maturing cinema-graphically into an artist that cohesively, with continuity, crafted a dark song of a film.
The iconography is so powerful combined with the powerful history of Salem; these archetypal histories, icons, and the use of music make this film uniquely American, and diabolically scary. The manipulation of western mythologies and occult ideologies was refreshing, and shattered taboos, while it formed a film that for some may have more impact on their sensibilities but needed to be made.
Zombie's advancement to good writing and solid story and the best casting have me salivating for his next film, which like The Lords of Salem should be iconoclastic and well written.",1378684800,2,1068,4.938888888888889

5345989,2,B009KU2MAM,"The Lords of Salem is a horror film from Rob Zombie based on the Salem Witch Trials. The basic premise is that the witches burned at the stake condemned their descendents with a curse. The film gets going when a DJ from the local metal radio station receives a record that starts to affect her when she listens to it.

It's not a terrible horror film, but it is pretty mediocre. It has a few interesting moments, but not enough to lift it from what is standard cheap horror tricks. It relies too much on shock and surprise rather than building tension. It does build a bit of suspense, but then ruins it with another shock moment.

One aspect it does do reasonably well is the audio element. The music themes work well (although if you're not a fan of metal it could get a bit much), but again it's geared to towards shock and awe rather than layering an atmosphere.

Some of the effects are ropey (literally in one case) as well. Overall it comes across as cheap and a bit amateurish, one to avoid unless you're a dedicated Rob Zombie fan.",1378598400,,1040,4.3782383419689115
5345990,1,B009KU2MAM,"I don't normally trash movies completely as I feel that, regardless of how bad a movie may be it will still have had some redeeming value - even if it's only gratuitous nudity.  The Lords of Salem, however, rightfully deserves a complete trashing.

This film is a disjointed mess trying WAY too hard to be arty while simultaneously trying WAY too hard to be shocking and outrageous.  The plot, at its core, is very basic horror movie fare - witches invoke Satan to curse the descendants of the one that brought them low, along with all the female descendents of the original women of Salem.  Just because, apparently, as their dark motives are never explained more than that.  Fortunately, character motivations will be the last thing on your mind as you sit through this film.  What will be on your mind is how close to the end of the movie you are.

The Lords of Salem plods and crawls.  The characters are two-dimensional and uninteresting, with obvious motivations (even the ""secret"" bad guys).  It tries REALLY hard to be creepy but the movie is so poorly paced, with characters you don't give a crap about, that all it accomplishes is drawing the movie out.  A decent editor could easily lop off 10-15 minutes of this movie and do no harm to it (which isn't saying much).  Honestly, I probably would have given this film another star had it been less of a yawning time-sink.

The Lords of Salem is chock full of nudity.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of it is not the kind of nudity you'd want to see (think of your grandmother, with a good coat of medieval grime on her, giving you the full monty along with the rest of her bridge club).  What is most amusing is that Sherri Moon-Zombie is shown naked lying face down in bed at the beginning of the movie, but her character never again sleeps nude.  Rob Zombie was obviously trying to offset the naked-grandma-mind-bomb he set off in the intro by offering up some eye bleach in the form of his wife au naturale.  Sadly, even her coy nakedness cannot save or redeem this scrambled disaster.  FYI, you get naked-grandma-mind-bombed a few more times throughout the movie.  Consider yourself warned.

Witches, demons, possession, eternal torture of Hell, it's all there.  On top of that, it's got enough gory and disgusting violence to make one cringe.  The movie progresses in a methodical manner and the plot is simple and easy to follow.  Now is the movie believable?  Of course it is not, it'a about witches, the devil, possession, and Hell for Christ's sake.  Nevertheless it is a beautiful depiction of unspeakable evil and horror, and should be enjoyed as such.

Unfortunately, this one let me down and if not for the insanely smokin ' hot Sheri Moon-Zombie, I wouldn't have even finished watching it. Starts pretty good and turns to just a nonsense movie halfway thru.
What are we supposed to believe happened as the credits roll? What happens to her and the reencarnated witches and what effect does this Devil's child cause to the world? Very similar to Rosemary's Baby, except senseless. I would love to see a Halloween 3 or a Devil's Rejects movie as a Rob Zombie movie next.

5346002,2,B009KU2MAM,"I went into this movie with pretty high expectations. Unlike the Rob Zombie haters out there, I have enjoyed all of his films to date. Each one presented us with crazy characters, gore, violence, and a sense that we should route for the bad guys in some way. He's taken concepts from past days and turned them upside down, two of which were Halloween remakes.

Coming out with an original film was the logical next step. In ""The Lords Of Salem"" we have classic elements like the freaky taped thing, but it's not a VHS it's a record playing some haunting music. It even has different characters, some the usual dirty people we've seen in his films before, and some not. It sets up a play of a particular witch and her mini-coven who put a curse that would last beyond their deaths.

What comes out of all this? A lack of actually diving into it's own story. Not much is ever shown or told of the witches outside of their rituals, naked women, and horror shots of ""someone's in the hall"" or ""they seem possessed."" 40 minutes in and most of what you think may happen is speculation, and it stays that way.

The writer who seems to know a lot about the Salem witch trials spends the whole movie following a trail that leads to nowhere. The witches curse seems to have no real point but to freak people out and make them act weird.

This film completely lacks any excitement and never goes anywhere. Who were the lords of salem? The Witches? The group of men who supposedly killed them, hung them, burned them? Never is made clear.

Also, this movie was supposed to based upon Rob Zombie's song ""Lords Of Salem."" It isn't even in the film, and it has nothing to do with the song at all. If he was going for something completely different than it should've been called something else.

All in all, this is one of those go-nowhere films that will be forgotten very fast, and fade away back into my wallet after I send it back for a refund.

Rob Zombie, don't go down this road. Get back into the game with a third Devil's Rejects film or a movie with actual events occurring. This feels like a witch version of ""Paranormal Activity,"" just not nearly as bad (I can't even write a review for those films because I cannot leave 1 star).",1378425600,,2226,4.388349514563107

I've been a long-time fan of Rob Zombie's movies and while this one was very unexpected and unusual (even for him), it is also the most unique in his history as director. As always, his wife Sheri Moon plays a central role and she really goes deep for this one. There are slow and boring parts of the film but when it hits the fan, things are so bizarre and twisted that it shames any nightmares you've ever had.

5346006,2,B009KU2MAM,"It seems that this movie is one that you either love or hate. I've watched ot several times, wondering if I missed something. I didn't, the movie is just...well...kind of a mess. If you've read the book you have a very general idea of the story, unfortunately, the budget for the movie only allowed the most bare bones version of Zombie's original script. What's left is a pretty dull movie, devoid of scares, plotlines, and a sense of coherency in general.
 It is unlike any of Zombie's other films, which is fine, but it comes across a little TOO different. Now, if you've read the book (based on the original script) you know that it is much more like a traditional Rob Zombie movie. Due to its budget, that was not the film that was made. To be honest, the movie lacked because of it. It's all style and no substance. It's clearly modeled after european horror movies from the 70s' but without the interesting storyline or scares to go along with it. If you listen to the commentary (the only feature on the disc) Zombie is constantly explaining that they had no time and no money to make the film and describes the production as ""chaos"". The chaos has certainly transferred onto the screen. For some directors time constraint and small (very) budgets won't make a huge difference, for Zombie....well, this is the result. It's too bad too, because his original script was a great story.
This isn't a total disaster like some want to claim. Some of these one star reviews are childish. This is FAR from the worst movie I've ever seen. It's  just not very good. Period. Some of the imagery, including the setting are really appealing. Those alone elevate it from a ""1 star"" film. The performances ( including Sheri Moon, who is perfectly fine for all the more that is required of her, she has maybe 30 lines) are more than adquete. Some are really quite impressive, but not enough to save the movie. I encourage people who did/did not like the movie to read the book, it is a more enjoyable experience.",1378425600,2,2004,4.579387186629527

Let's start off with the plot, considering horror movies have some plot to move the story forward. This plot was shallow. It jumped from scene change to scene change, flashbacks, etc with no good transitions. It dod not flow whatsoever. The characters were terrible and the acting was definitely not Devils Rejects-worthy. The special effects I would give a D and thats generous...really a midget in a rubber suit as the demon child?! Cheesy! Looked like an old Godzilla flick. Then there was some hairy yeti in need of a manicure that fit NOWHERE in this movie. If that wasn't idiotic enough, perhaps the group of old wrinkly naked ladies dancing around the campfire might be the scariest part of the movie. Just ewww. All in all, I would suggest saving whatever money that is being charged for the Blue Ray and wait about 4 months and it will be in the $5 bin at your local Walmart.",1378425600,,1160,4.555023923444976

5346019,3,B009KU2MAM,"In the beginning, there is the mysterious apartment 5 at the end of the hall in an apartment complex where the local rock DJ lives. Sherri Moon Zombie plays this character to the bone.  Then she gets a record dropped off at the radio station. She plays the record on air while an author who wrote a book about witches is the on air guest. Spoiler Alert. I was onboard at this point but the train derailed. The film had an old school 1970's supernatural movie feel. It wasn't supposed to be gory just that creepy the witches/devil are out there plotting something. Things took a bad turn when the screen flashed with some Scooby Doo psychedelic stuff promoting the radio show the main character worked on. Then the scene with the witches being burned. Everyone knows a witch has never been burned in Salem or the US. Burning witches was a European thing. The Salem witches were hanged. Salem is as close to Halloween Town in the Nightmare Before Christmas as any place in the US. The Bewitched statue was shown but that was about all the viewer got to see of Salem. It was definitely shot on location. The old buildings are there. There is an old graveyard in Salem where the crypts are practically crumbling with weird skeleton angels on the graves. That could have made a great scene. When Rob Zombie stays closer to reality or at least something that could happen it is gold. Devil's Rejections, that could really happen and that is why it is so scary. Dealing with witches and devils cannot go off into campy or it is not scary. Did Hocus Pocus scare anyone? The scenes which some reviewers thought were art do not work in a horror film. I think it was Halloween 2 where Michael Myers and his mother are in a field and are dancing around as if they are on a LSD trip, it did not work. The author investigating the witches could have been played up more. The witches were not scary. Three old broads drinking down some tea every five seconds reminded me of Murder She Wrote. The opening scene witches who came back throughout the movie where kinda scary. The scene with the devils touching themselves was beyond lame. The lobster baby that the DJ gives birth to looked like they got it out of the tank at Red Lobster. The fat devil child had no connection to the movie and was super cartoony. Near the end, the movie melted down into a crazy bunch of images that just did not fit and did not help the story. The end was pretty good as it was mixed in with the credits. It was the old newscaster voice summing things up. Because in the last 20 seconds the viewer gets that, the music is being played for the descendants of the Judge and the townspeople who killed the witches. Until that point, it was only clear the descendant of the Judge was to bear the lobster baby. The other women being brought to slaughter could have been move of the movie. The Judge and the townspeople who were in on the hangings are buried in a cemetery in the middle of Salem with these creepy old trees. That could have been used. The location was just about wasted and this film went off the rails of the crazy train but not in a fun ride kind of way.",1378339200,8,3133,4.373927958833619

I would say the plot was tired ( think Rosemary's Baby, The Omen)but there was really no actual plot, just some random insinuations as to what's going on. If this was a music video it would have been great, but unfortunately they tried to pass off this drivel as a movie. Lords of Salem was all style and absolutely no substance whatsoever. The movie was disjointed and never came together to make any real sense, the ending was a cluster of absolute nonsense, the dialogue was infantile, and the acting was crap- I'm not sure if the actors can be blamed for this with so little to work with.

I don't think Rob Zombie was putting in any actual effort here, and if he was then that saddens me even more. It comes off like a 12-year old metalhead was bored in math class, scribbled some drawings and lousy anti-Christian poetry in his notebook, and it regrettably came to life. It's not shocking, it's not subversive, it's idiotic and so adolescent I think I got a zit watching it. I don't even think Beavis and Butthead would give it 5 stars.

5346023,1,B009KU2MAM,"...Fails spectacularly.

Oooooh, where to start?

Sheri Moon Zombie - who, at a MILF-y 42, looks ridiculous trying to pull off 20-something crust punk dreads-tats-and-filthy-clothing - plays a D-list radio personality who gets stalked by a coven of witches and forced to give birth to their anti-Christ so they can over throw Christianity and take over the world. I think. They never actually say what their plan is or why they're doing what they do.

From the outset, Rob forgoes any sort of plot innovation or character development and banks completely on the shock value of anti-Christian blasphemy to keep the audience interested. So you'd think he'd at least hire capable writers, but no. The dialog is the kind of corny, hilariously over the top heresy you'd find in the diaries of upper-middle-class adolescent boys who listen to too much black metal.

The visuals are either boring, done to death, or just plain stupid. Naked fat chicks wear trash bags on their heads and sing dark hymns while guys dressed up as the pope masturbate technicolor dildos. Blood is puked. Babies are sacrificed. Goats are humped. Bigfoot lurks by at one point.

Zombie uses twice the violence, gore, and blasphemy as the classics like The Exorcist or Rosemary's Baby, yet manages to achieve half - if that - of their stunning effect. Who can forget the cross scene with Reagen, or the snake eyes peering up at Rosemary from the black crib? Rob's answer to those classic scenes? Sheri Moon giving birth to a squealing mass of tentacles that looks like a child's sweet potato experiment left to grow in the sugar water a little too long. Good luck taking the world over with a ""King"" so deformed you can't even tell which end to put the diaper on, Satanists. Way to go.",1378252800,81,1755,4.778877887788779

I saw Rosemary's baby, the Devonsville Terror, and the Shining and I am big horror fan of Dario Argento. Nothing new was shown to me. He really let me down.

5346027,4,B009KU2MAM,"I have been a horror aficionado for decades (I am 53 now) I have seen so many excellent horror films as well as many so-bad-it-is-good b-movies. This movie reminds me of movies that I have seen that are poorly edited, cut up or disjointed. Not to say that this is poorly edited or any of those things bit it is like one of those movies that unnerves you despite it's bad production. Again, I do not think this film has poor production, that is just the subliminal, poetic, jangly, jump-cut kind of impression it gave me. I certainly was entertained and did not look at the clock once. In my opinion, that is a success. We watch movies to take us away, immerse us, lose ourselves. It is just so outside the norm that it is hard for me to say, ""this is a great movie, go see it!"". It was definately not boring.
 Ever wake up from a nightmare, petrified, then as the morning burns on you forget details but surely remember the feeling of horror? that is kinda like this film. It most definitely leaves me with the feeling that I have witnessed something different, possibly the beginning of something great. I am very anxious to see which direction he takes on his next films. I would say it is important to see this if you care about horror. This may be where people start to imitate the formula. It was impressionistic, like poetry. I, myself, enjoyed it. Too many people need to feel that a story is completely told with no loose ends. Those people will be disappointed. I can recall people saying they did not like Hitchcock because of the unanswered feelings they had after watching his films. Now he is considered a genius. Mark my words, Mr. Zombie (is that his legal name now?) is just getting started. He does not pander to people who do not think with this film. I rated it four stars.

5346029,1,B009KU2MAM,"I am a life-long, die hard Zombie fan. Everything this man does is solid gold with the exception of this movie, which is less solid gold and more wet poop. Any time a movie opens with a bunch of old, dirty women getting naked and dancing around a fire you know things are not going to go well. When this movie ended my brother and I walked out of the theater and both said, ""What was that?"" We weren't sure exactly what the movie's point is, but we were both sure it was the worst movie we have ever seen and will probably ever see. Please go watch The Devil's Rejects again and listen to Hellbilly Deluxe 1 and 2 a few times. Don't watch this movie.

I'll try my best not to spoil the movie and still get across how bad this movie is. The basic premise is that Zombie's wife is one third of a Stern-style radio show. Some band called The Lords sends Sheri Moon a record, and she hears the record and goes into some kind of trance. The dude who played Senator Kelly in the X-Men movies is an expert on all things Salem witch trials and realizes something is afoot. Turns out Sheri Moon's landlord and her old friends are witches and are possessing Sheri Moon because she is going to bring back the Lords. What I just said makes more sense than what you see in the movie, I promise. It has taken me four months to figure our that is what the point is. All I know is there was one likeable character in the entire movie and he meets a pointless demise. This all builds up to a pointless ending that leaves you completely confused and resolves nothing because I'm still not entirely sure who the Lords are.

This movie is about nothing. There are scenes meant to shock you, but unless you're a 17-year-old bro you'll just realize Zombie is trying to be shocking and failing miserably. There's simulated masturbation and way too many naked old women. It doesn't shock so much as is frustrates because this movie makes no sense. It is literally a collection of scenes, but not even cool ones.

I will say that it is beautifully filmed. Zombie clearly knows what he's doing from a directing standpoint, but as a screenwriter he totally bungled this one. And I am also relieved he didn't kill off his wife's dog. If there had been animal murder to add to the atrocity that was this movie, I don't know if I would even be here today.

This isn't a movie so bad it is funny and one day it will be a cult classic. It was really bad. Literally nothing was resolved, there was a single likeable character, and I'm not sure what this movie was about other than Zombie having his wife walk around in underwear and listen to bad music. The end of this movie will make you so mad you'll want to riot in the streets and will lose so much respect for Zombie. This movie was so bad I almost didn't even listen to his new album since even though it is a completely different medium, I figured if Zombie fell off in one place he fell off in another.

If you're itching to spend money, go buy his most recent album. Please don't buy this movie. This movie was so horrid I am embarrassed to have spent money on it. I can't beg you enough to not watch this movie. The ending of this movie is so brutally idiotic, and the bit of film you suffer through to get there is so boring and confusing.

5346034,4,B009KU2MAM,"This is a nice, quiet little film. There is some strong imagery in it, but if you are used to horror movies nothing in this will raise an eyebrow. Its a very 'clean' production with a simple, almost casual script. Again, I was a little surprised at how mellow the film is. I was expecting, from some of the other reviews, a really 'satanic' and troubling film. But aside from some superficial religious imagery its just a loose revenge story. Sherri Moon Zombie is great in it. She has gotten so much better over the last 3-4 films. If I could make one change to this movie (im sure a lot went into it that im not considering... but thats the way it is) it would have been to develop the story more so that we have a stronger understanding of what a 'witch' is and why they love 'satan'. As it is in the movie this is basically a 'given' the audience is expected to accept on its own. However, the entire scare factor in the film is also based on understanding the relationship between the witches and satan. And since we aren't given a proper set of rules/goals that this relationship is supposed to strive for/aspire too it just isn't that scary (im way over thinking this now).

Anyway, definitely worth seeing. Definitely an enjoyable flick. Could be better. But that goes for most films.",1377820800,,1292,4.451476793248945

Not from the Zombie you won't! Pushing the envelope is what he does best and he's definitely done it here. Expecting my Blue-ray on Tuesday. Can't wait.",1377820800,4,478,4.7023809523809526
5346036,5,B009KU2MAM,"For the past decade, Rob Zombie has been one of the most polarizing directors in horror. Either people love his films or hate them with a passion. There is a very small middle ground. This film is likely his film that has divided fans the most. It is so different from the rest of his films that it is difficult to believe Rob Zombie even directed it. His previous films had heavy amounts of blood, gore, nudity, violence, and obscene language (though personally I think they had great character and plot in addition to all of that). This film is different in that it focuses on building a disturbing atmosphere and suspense rather than explicit violence. It is so unlike his previous films and so unlike any horror film to be released in a long time. The Sentinel, Suspiria, and The Antichrist (the 1974 version, not to be confused with Lars Von Trier's) are some horror films I can think of with a similar atmosphere. Because of that, I think lots of people will be confused because it goes against their expectations. You should go into this film expecting a bizarre, surreal, nightmarish film rather than The Devil's Rejects or Halloween but with witches. I think it is his best film yet. The story is fascinating, the character of Heidi Hawthorne is easy to feel sorry for (Sheri Moon Zombie gives her best performance yet), it has a cast of great actors such as Dee Wallace, Patricia Quinn, Judy Geeson, Bruce Davison, and Ken Foree who all give great performances. The musical score is also great as well as the cinematography. It is a heavily visual horror film that uses gorgeous imagery to tell it's story. Most horror movies nowadays have the same basic look about them so I think it catches people off guard that this one dares to have it's own individual aesthetics.

In conclusion, if you turn on this movie expecting it to be the same as any of Rob Zombie's other films (or any run-of-the-mill 21st century supernatural horror movie for that matter), you will be disappointed. But if you turn on this movie expecting an atmospheric, phantasmagorical horror film, you just may find that you love it. I know I did.

I watched most of what has come out in the horror genre over the past 20 years from big budget to low, low budget.  Never have I seen anything to compare to this large steaming pile of manure.  Even Rob Zombie should be able to do better than this.  It's boring and stupid.  The acting is horrendous.  The main actress must be Rob's daughter.(I have since been informed by numerous Zombie fans that this is actually Rob's wife.  I stand corrected but I think it's obvious why I'd think daughter if you have ever seen the two of them together)  Watching her is like watching a mannequin try to act.  There simply are no redeeming qualities to this thing.  I got through about half of it and ended up fast forwarding thru most of the second half just to see what happens at the end in hopes that there would be some payoff for the torture you are subjected to for the rest of the movie.  Nope, just more torture.  Please don't waste your money or time on this.  If you feel that you must, wait a week or two and get a copy from the discount bin at the used video store.

The movie,while it was OK and kept me watching did seem slow and repetitive in parts, really just seemed like a movie he wrote as a reason to show off his wife. Bruce Davison is good in this and he really helps the movie out.

5346044,4,B009KU2MAM,"If you enjoyed all of the ambiance, lighting, and camera angles in Rob Zombie's Halloween 2, you'll enjoy the scenes of Heidi' s solitary life in the Lords.  While I recognized all of the camera work and sets as what I love about Zombie' s movies, there was something missing for me in the character development of Heidi (played by his wife Sheri). At one point one of the witches challenges her to deal with some issues the witch assumes Heidi has, but there is nothing more mentioned about it after Heidi ends the conversation.  ###Don't read on if you haven't seen the END###

 I think Heidi' s avoidance somehow relates to the monologue in the final disturbing scenes, which I want to hear again, since it expressed a sort of ultimate fear of death, of the goat always winning in the end, mocking you by dancing on your grave.  I have nothing against goats, so the goat stuff added a slight humor for me, but I'd love to hear Rob Zombie elaborate on the topic.  The witches' description of the curse on the women of Salem was simultaneously humorous and disgusting, yet I have concluded that Zombie is portraying the witches' complete hatred for the entire life cycle of humans, so to his witches, reproduction is just the beginning of the ultimate decay of your family genes, your rotting ancestors. Truly disturbing with the image of them spitting in the face of a newborn still fresh in the mind from the earlier scenes. In contrast to this, I would have liked to have seen the goodness of Heidi' s life before she turned to drugs which seems to have been the self-destructive force that made her more vulnerable to the witches. She is very sweet with her golden retriever, which shows her nurturing, feminine side, but there could have been more beautiful scenes of her life, making the visual eulogy as emotional as the one for Annie Brackett in Zombie's Halloween 2. It's as if his topic was so broad that it needed the roots of a bit more history to give us viewers something to cling to while processing it. A free fall was probably the experience he wanted to create, though.",1373500800,,2088,4.56951871657754

5346047,1,B009KU2MAM,"Lords of Salem is the latest Rob Zombie flick, and he wants this movie to be so old school, that he even threw in the most useless ideas to make a bad C-grade film. Why a movie needs to start off with Sherri Moon Zombie naked on a bed, waking up and having a pee is anyones guess? But it pretty much sets the mood up for the rest of the movie; the mood of, this is going to be a bad movie. Not bad as in tough, cool, or great, no, bad as in, horribly made, bad plots and a bunch of useless shots.

When I first saw the trailer, I rolled my eyes and thought Rob Zombie has really dropped the ball, and I had no intention of even watching it. However, a popular review panel online said that they had not liked any of Rob Zombies previous films, apart from Devil's Rejects. And that is my opinion too. So I figured, maybe we think alike? But no, they said this movie was not great, but it was good. Not to me it wasn't, I was bored from start to finish. If I wasn't raising an eyebrow at what the hell was being shown, I was stapling my eye lids open so I don't go to sleep too early and ruin by patterns.

So, from what very little to understand plot there is; a bunch of witches where burned alive 100 years ago. They cursed the bloodlines of the one who burned them, and, now Sherri Moon Zombie's character... err... blondie girl is caught up in it when she receives a weird record to play at her radio station where she broadcasts her late night show from.

Too much of it evolves around nothing, then something weird happening, and it's a dream or hallucination or something, and then no explanation as to why something just happened, just a mind messing effect put in for no reason, followed by another useless scene that has nothing to do with anything. Rob may have caught that 70's horror movie feel, but there is a reason a lot of people moved on from them now. They are pointless and boring. The end of the film is what I expected, a confusing joke to just finish a movie off.

If you also thought to check this movie out because you heard it was blasphemous, HAHA, don't bother. It won't give you any kicks in anything you haven't seen or heard before. There is only one memorable scene in this whole movie, and it's within the first 10mins. So if you get that far and think the movie is going nowhere, take my word on it, you don't have to force yourself to watch it hoping it gets better, because it doesn't.

I don't think I will bother watching anymore Rob Zombie films. Even his last album wasn't good. The guy's lost his touch there, and never really found one in movies.",1370649600,7,2587,4.186746987951807

That being said, it is one of the trippiest and most sadistic films I have ever seen and I would recommend this movie to very few people. It's sort of like a combination of Suspiria, Rosemary's Baby, and Pink Floyd the Wall. Rob Zombie obviously knows and loves film, and this is visually his best film to date. He is in my opinion this generations best horror film maker, and this is another film to help prove it. This is a love it or hate it film. No one will find this just okay. This film will most likely be in my thoughts for days, and I very much believe that that was Mr. Zombie's goal.

5346049,4,B009KU2MAM,"Part art house, part grind house, and part bad acid trip, Rob Zombie's latest film LORDS OF SALEM swings for the fences but comes up just a bit short.  What might have been a home run instead was perhaps a ground rule double in baseball terms.

SALEM starts off decently strong - shot in the actual town of Salem, we immediately begin a day in the life of weird looking Goth hipster lady in her 30's who's a DJ.  One day she gets a crazy record at the station and when she plays it, all hell breaks loose.

Part of why this film is simultaneously fascinating and frustrating is that in parts, it works like a pure horror film.  Long hallways and longer dolly shots straight out of THE SHINNING and original HALLOWEEN (strangely enough) help set up some legit scares that could have kept rolling for the entire film as the story, set up, and performances are all pretty good.  The film is helped immensely by the wonderfully over the top music by John 5, who provides some of the best musical stabs since JAWS.

But inter cut all through the movie are dreams and dreamlike sequences - including an insaneo witch scene to start the film - all of which are super weird... but not scary in the slightest.  Gross and grotesque yes, scary no.  Which is too bad, 'cause this thing had potential to be one of the scariest flicks ever made.

In many ways it's like THE DEVIL'S RAIN or even EGE's own WITCHUNTER in terms of basic story structure (there a coven of child murdering people trying to summon Satan himself).  But LORDS OF SALEM is certainly better then both those films in terms of cinematic style - Zombie is really coming into his own, developing a true style as a film maker.  That's a good thing, right?

Yes and no.  In SALEM, Zombie tries to cram one too many cinematic styles for one movie.  He jumps between Kubrickian scenes in a huge theatre, then a witch burning shot that could have been out of a 60's era psychedelic flick like PSYCHOMAINIA.  Zombie goes for the gross out or the grotesque when he was getting plenty of scares without them.  It's stylistic as hell for sure, but if the film was a bit more straight narrative I think Zombie could have squeezed even more horror out of this film.  As it is, there's some bits that try for disturbing but come out as somewhat short - even comedic.  Think South Park's ep called ""Christmas Critters"" and you get the idea.

Styles aside, there were some small but important bits of realism he could have gotten, but didn't.  For instance, we see her doing her zany radio show with her 2 friends early on in the film.  All sorts of wacky sounds emanate, in typical shock jock fashion.  Which would be fine if they showed anyone hitting a button to make it happen, or an engineer in the background.  It just seems to be magically happening.  Seems a small detail perhaps, but after the 10th wacky sound blasting over the speakers you have to wonder what supercomputer is making all the noise happen.  That same radio station seems to be huge for a town of some 40,000.  Possible perhaps, but a little unlikely.

Likewise we never really get to know the main character at all before it all goes wrong, and because the character is so weird looking to start with (she's got tats everywhere,blond dreads, and really bad taste in clothes), it makes her fall a lot less great then it might have been, knocking some wind out of some drama in the process.  You do care about her, but I think if Zombie had spent just 10 minutes with her character to start the film, it would have helped that feeling even more.

All that said, Zombie made his flick.  It's not what anyone else would have done, but that his part of his brilliance.  It's an incredibly watchable film and it has a wonderful cast, including Sherri Moon Zombie as the DJ and Bruce Davidson as a sort of Van Helsing character.  The music as I mentioned before is outstanding and the camera work is super crazy.  The movie meanders from time to time, allowing itself far too many excesses in terms of dream sequences, but ultimately makes up for it with an ending that's simply awesome.  It's so weird and awful it hurts - but in a good way.  A truly great last 2 minutes of this movie makes up for so questionable decisions earlier.

In the end, it's not a home run.... but it's damned close.  Call it a three run triple up the gap and to the wall of crazy town.

BOTTOM LINE: 4 ""Never and I mean never take acid before watching this movie"" out five stars.",1369180800,7,4469,4.416870415647922
5346050,4,B009KU2MAM,"If you ask me,it's become apparent,or better yet,painfully obvious that not one other film maker in the genre has gathered the notches under his belt like Rob Zombie has. In 2003 he gave the world of horror a much needed shock to the system with House Of 1000 Corpses. It was raw,gritty,and a great way to to transition out of the slasher revival which found rejuvenation with the Scream films.
Though critically his films have mostly fallen on deaf ears,I would venture to say within the next two decades Zombie as a director will be looked at more seriously for his contributions to the genre.

With The Lords Of Salem Zombie somewhat stretches out of his comfort zone and tackles a larger film all together,and I got to say I absolutely love the premise behind this movie. Without spoiling too much,a mysterious vinyl record shows up at a radio station and puts a whole town under its influence,though you're really only seeing this madness through the eyes of one DJ at the radio station.
For me, the biggest disadvantage The Lords suffers from is that it's perhaps too ambitious. At times I felt you got a real sense of the movies limitations and it's never really successfully covered up,but on the flip side, the film as a whole really kept me engaged in what was going to happen.
Zombie really does an amazing job at invoking the whole ""witch"" imaginary as well. He doesn't entice us with over the top,beautiful looking women here. No,instead we see the filthiest,foul mouthed, heathen whores of Satan perhaps we have ever seen on film (or at least the best in a long,long,time).

In conclusion, The Lords Of Salem doesn't really offer us the shock value of 1,000 corpses or The Devils Rejects,nor does it carry the heavy weight history of the Halloween franchise,but what it does give us is a great,atmospheric horror setting with a great premise and spooky visuals. Rob Zombie's films are less like a movie and more akin to peeking into his psyche with a music video bent to it. Lords doesn't stray from this formula but I felt it was a more mature film all the same.",1369094400,2,2077,4.656675749318801

The witches in this film wear these over the top grimaces and speak in portentous sentences.  He likes to pepper their dialogue with ""shocking"" sexual imagery, and even shows them graphically naked in all their middle aged/unfit glory.  The idea is that the audience should recoil from this, but its not actually scary.  The bigger problem though is that Zombie still can't string together a cogent narrative.  He fails just in terms of making the film feel like a coherent force of story telling, and of a lot of the film's ""spooky"" imagery is just that---like montages of images that are unexplained and not related to each other.",1368662400,9,759,4.763358778625954
5346054,3,B009KU2MAM,"I'm going to try to keep this review relatively spoiler free, although I'll warn any incoming readers that I might inadvertently spoil something major. I'll try to keep to the smaller details as far as spoilers go. If you want to know whether or not to buy this, my opinion is... maybe. This isn't really like many of Zombie's other films and I can't even guarantee that you'll like it. If you're a Zombie completionist, get it to ensure that your collection is complete. If not, I recommend getting this via Netflix or similar and watching it first. Another disclaimer: I saw the theatrical version of this and not the DVD. If I watch it again on DVD, I'll update it accordingly. If it makes any difference, I'm actively debating re-watching this on DVD when it comes out, if only for the special features and director's narration. Despite how negative portions of this review might sound, there is some sort of endorsement in saying that I'd probably willingly view this again and not to make fun of it.

I'll also warn you by saying that if you're expecting House of 1000 Corpses or a traditional horror film, this isn't it. This is a strange, strange film and again, very unlike anything he's done before. I wouldn't say its his best film, but I wouldn't say it's his worst either. There is some very valid merit in seeing this for yourself and you'll probably end up either loving this or hating it with a passion. There is very little inbetween with LoS, although it might take you a while to figure out which side you're on. Me? I run the gamut between absolutely loving this and hating it, hence the three stars.

Now. On with the more detailed review.

I'd say that my biggest complaint is that this film couldn't entirely tell what it wanted to be at times. There were some nice jump scares in the film that made this film steer towards being a more stylish horror film. Other times you have these weird, trippy scenes that made it seem like it wanted to be more of an arthouse flick. You know the type. The one that's called ""horror"" but isn't really all that scary, akin to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Valerie-and-Her-Week-of-Wonders/dp/B00013D48G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Valerie and Her Week of Wonders</a>. If Zombie had chosen one direction or the other, this would've been a more solid film for it. As it was, the shifting from one film type to another weakened Salem's impact.

The first half of this film was fairly strong, I must say. This was before it started switching back and forth between the two different film types and stayed more close to the idea of being a straight-forward horror film. You have some great scares and some fun scenes, such as the radio crew interviewing the satanic musician. I'll admit that Sheri Moon Zombie isn't the most fabulous actor, but she does the job well enough for the most part. However, when the film starts delving into trippy arthouse territory when Heidi begins losing her mind (and soul), Moon Zombie just doesn't seem to be able to really and firmly grasp the character.

That isn't to say that the arthouse portion of it is without merit. There's some wonderful imagery here that unfortunately tends to look ridiculous in comparison to the more slick earlier portion. One such scene is one that will probably be the most infamous one of the film, where Heidi walks into the dreaded fifth apartment and is transported to this opulent ballroom. And is then assaulted/impregnated (sorta, but not in the way you're thinking, perv) by a double tentacled miniature demon-thing. My best friend and her husband both laughed like hyenas during this scene and I can't help but think that it was because it was so out of left field in comparison to everything up to this point. They also laughed during the ending, which sort of did the same thing. It was too ""art house"" in comparison to most of what had came before. The ending has a sort of charm and I'll admit that the image at the end of it (once you see it, you'll know what I'm referring to) is pretty cool, but it just felt a little inconsistent.

There are some otherwise good performances by the side characters, who are really the most endearing ones of the film. It's interesting that Zombie chose to have so many big name actors play as secondary characters, but make them up in ways that would keep them from being immediately recognizable to the average horror/cult movie savvy fan. Patricia Quinn (Magenta from RHPS) is a rather good example of this, as she's made up *just* enough to be recognizable if you're specifically looking for her but different enough to where I had to point this out to my friends. In other words, he didn't try to make her look and sound like her more well known character of Magenta. (Anyone who has seen, say, Adrienne Barbeau in anything will know that while she's uniformly awesome in all she does, directors do sort of go out of their way to portray her as the same type of person in almost every film.) It's a bold move and one that actually pays off for Zombie because he gets the talent without anyone automatically comparing them to their more infamous roles. I've got to give him credit for this point, as this isn't what most people would really lean towards doing. Oh, and the soundtrack is awesome, one of the other stronger points in the film. Another strong point is that everything was shot beautifully, even if it didn't really come together all that cohesively.

The only problem is that mish-mashing of genres. It just doesn't pan out like it should and at times feels like it's more SUPER-AWESOME-MONKEY-SAUCE-RANDOMNESS than the type of off the wall randomness that you see in art house flicks that somehow works wonderfully together. It also doesn't help that I've read the book, which supposedly is the version of the movie that Zombie wanted to make, and it's a more solid story than this was, despite its own serious set of flaws. There's some great imagery here and if it had been worked together a little more rather than feeling sort of random, this could have easily been one of Zombie's greatest films. It just wasn't really there. I can't decide if I liked the film or if I hated it, so I'm giving this an ambivalent three stars. My friends? They hated it. I might watch this again once it hits DVD, just so I can hear Zombie's director's track.

UPDATE:

I'm in the process of trying to get my mitts on a DVD, but this film sort of grew on me over time. The more I thought about it, the more I liked it. I'll wait to change the star rating after I see the film again, but the appeal of the scenes and Zombie's various choices for the film have sort of endeared themselves to me the more this film sinks into my brain.",1368489600,4,6752,4.648241206030151
5346055,1,B009KU2MAM,"WTG Rob Zombie, you have successfully tarnished your movie directing career with the biggest piece of weird s*** conceivable. Man, Lords of Salem really sucked goats balls, no pun intended considering there was indeed a goat in the movie. See, House of 1000 corpses, awesome, Devils Rejects, awesome, hell even the Halloween remakes were decent. Im reconsidering my whole perception of Rob Zombie now, im not sure if he is as creepy as he would lead you to believe or he is at this point just trying to hard to be different, either that or Sherri Moon was the puppeteer behind the stink guiding him to do a movie on witches and it somehow became a religious mockery fubar. Either way it was a piece of crap lol and I completely understand why it went straight to dvd in the UK. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY, PERIOD. The only good thing that came out of it was the laugh my woman got from the mutant midget with a split ambilical chord in which Sherrie Moon played like a nintendo wii,  lol its just wack, almost to the point that it seemed Rob wanted to try to make you confused even though you followed the whole movie and understood it all...its really solely based on shock value and even that is very weak, I don't wanna spoil the movie (if thats even possible) so I won't get into to much detail but when I say shock value one example was at one point in the movie there was 3 what appeared to be Mummy/Zombie (idk cuz there was no ties to the movie as far as that character/characters) Preachers sitting on thrones jerking off red rubber dildos like really I don't see the point, it didn't fit the movie, it wasn't even relevant....like I said shock value that was wasn't even shocking or did not have any value. If you want shock value watch Serbian Film that movie will mess with your head forever lol. Wish I could rate it no stars, trust me do NOT waste your time its an hour and a half you can never get back.",1368230400,5,1922,4.32409972299169
5346056,4,B009KU2MAM,"Since he transcended from the realm of Rockstar to Film Auteur with ""House of a 1000 Corpses"", Rob Zombie has had mostly a love-hate relationship with his fans. And with his latest release, ""Lords of Salem"", Zombie, proves that this will be much of the same. Despite the fact that this time around, [Rob] Zombie is completely thinking outside the norm of what has been his filming style and technique. Where before he set out for a certain shock value, with ""Lords"" Zombie has given us a very atmospheric, almost trippy film that borrows elements from such other masters of horror as Cronenberg, Polanski and Lynch.

If ""Lords of Salem"" was made in the 1970's (perhaps even as late as 1981) then it would have been hailed as an iconic horror film, much in the same way as such other greats of the genre of that time, as Dario Argento's ""Suspiria"", ""Rosemary's Baby"" or even that of Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"". Sadly, however, the film finds life in 2013 where most of the audiences that will go and see it will neither understand or have the patience for Zombie's latest creation.

We find ourselves following along the life of DJ Heidi Hawthorn (aka Heidi LaRox), played by Sheri Moon Zombie, living life in Salem, Massachusetts, as night time radio's hottest DJs. When One night after a show with her cohorts and hosts Herman `Whitey' Salvador (Jeff Daniel Phillips) and Herman Jackson (Ken Foree), Heidi receives an old wooden box containing a vinyl record and a note saying it is from the band The Lords. Heidi takes the box home, and while she and Whitey are hanging around Heidi's apartment, Whitey plays the record. The music is mostly made up of string instruments being played in some strange rhythmic beat. The music, however, invokes a vision of days past for Heidi (and that of Salem) who sees what happens to a coven of supposed ""real"" witches back in the days that would get you killed for practicing or even being accused of witchcraft. The next night Herman puts the record up for the typical radio gig of Smash or Trash, dubbing the band The Lords of Salem. However, those women that are descendants of Salem that are listening to the show are hypnotised by the sound; stopping what they are doing entranced. Much in the sameway Heidi was the night before. Unaware at the time, the music triggers something inside Heidi that sends her spiralling out of control as she begins to see and deal with things that can not possibly be real.

Like many 70's films of the like, and while the film is set in modern day it has a definite 1970's feel to it, Zombie does as little as possible in the way of character development. Just giving you the bare essentials (Early in the film we see Heidi taking shots with her co-hosts after the job only later to find out that she is a recovering junkie. A fact sort of come into play later in the film.) of backstories for them. Replaced instead with more backstory when it comes to plot. Although, that does not take away from the film. Zombie gives just as much as needed and doesn't get bogged down in useless or over dialogued scenes. Which is good. While I do not mind (as others) that Zombie puts his wife Sheri in all his films, her acting is quite limited, and at times with this film it is painfully so. As Zombie stretches Sheri Moon's acting ability and is a far cry from what she has done before. Zombie also has abandoned the shaky, handheld almost documentary style of camera work from his previous films. Replaced now with thought out scenes shot on steady cameras using 35mm film; fantastic lighting and set designs with a moving, moody score that draws the viewer inside this strange world where a sect of ancient witches are hell bent in bring the Devil's child into our world. The plot is nothing new when it comes to this style and genre but Zombie makes it his own.

I can see the influences that Zombie has when it comes to horror. ""Lords"" is much in the way of ""Rosemary's Baby"" was when it comes to subject matter; ""The Shining"" where the tension builds through the slow pace of the film helped with a heavy score; scenes that highlighted (while not of the 70's, but just as insane) ""Twin Peaks"". Though if it were made by Argento instead of Lynch.

""Lords of Salem"" took me a little while to absorb. I was lucky enough to have seen it in an empty theater with no distractions that plague today's movie going experience, because in my opinion (an opinion that Rob Zombie will only half agree with) is that this film, to get the true experience, needs to be seen in the theater. Although a mostly, if not fully, empty theater. I believe the impact of the visuals will be lost when it comes to BluRay, and won't lend the same stimulation of the cortex of the mind that of the big screen.

Like with Sheri Moon, we find the usual Rob Zombie stand ins. Although, timeout if you blink you will miss Sid Haig and Michael Berryman. The real standout, acting wise, is Jeff Daniel Phillips (aka the Geico Caveman). Phillips brings forth a certain reality and believability to his character.

Love it or hate it, Zombie, with ""Lords of Salem, does exactly what he sets out to do with the audience with the visuals, the sound and added factor of a creepy-ass, empty theater: the film sits with you long after it is finished. Leaving to think and discuss with others about what the hell you have just sat through.",1367539200,45,5379,4.539175257731959
5346057,1,B009KU2MAM,"Honestly, this movie was completely stupid! I didn't even finish it because of that and I was more than halfway through it! This movie was totally plain and wasn't all that! With this movie coming from Rob Zombie, this is pretty sad! Just don't waist your time! Please trust my view!",1367280000,4,283,4.568627450980392
5346058,5,B009KU2MAM,"Rob Zombie is among the last of a rare breed.  They don't make movies like this anymore.  This film is not for everyone.  Immature people won't have the attention span for it.  Or they will ignorantly laugh at the nudity scenes.  This film is a true gem.  It's like some beautiful lost film from the late 60s/70s.  It's like Polanski, Kubrick, and Kenneth Anger all in one.  Some sort of deformed satanic child that spawned from an orgy of Rosemary's Baby, The Shining, Eraser Head, Susperia, and Invocation Of My Demon Brother (w/ Anton LaVey)

The shots are beautifully executed.  The acting is fabulous.  This is how horror movies are supposed to be.  This is not some teenage high action horror flick like Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, etc...  This is not a slasher film.  If you wanted to see a ton of violence and gore, there are other films for that.  No, this movie is a slow paced, psychological burn.  It's very dark and not for kids.

My ONLY criticism would be that the character development is slightly lacking.  I feel this film would have befitted from being much longer, with even more creepy scenes and much more dialogue so we, the audience, can learn more about the characters.

Rob Zombie was forced to heavily stray from his original script intentions due to money and time constraints. He wasn't able to shoot everything he wanted to and so this film is what it is.  It's quite brilliant and extremely dark and trippy.  I do wish he would have had the time and money to film exactly what he wanted, but oh well.  It's one hell of a movie, and if you really want to know what would have been, I'd suggest purchasing his novel of the same name, The Lords of Salem.  It's based around his original script and fills in a lot of gaps.

I highly recommend this film to lovers of classic and cult horror.  Those of you with a true appreciation for the macabre.  Many will hate this film.  I think it's amazing!

EDIT

Another film that comes to mind when describing Lords of Salem is ""Antichrist"", by Lars Von Trier.  I highly recommend this film as well.  It has the same trippy elements and a very slow paced, terrifying horror.",1367280000,19,2156,4.479381443298969
5346059,2,B009KU2MAM,"Just not a scary movie. Some interesting imagery kept me watching but that was it. It's quite boring. Disappointing, Devils Rejects is awesome but this does not come close.",1367280000,,172,4.9655172413793105
5346060,2,B009KU2MAM,"The opening scene uses a flashback to old Salem. Showing the 'clich' of naked dancing witches invoking Satan around a fire, a few more 'toils' and 'bubbles' and I half expected Macbeth to turn up. The film relies solely upon the story to sustain the audience's interest, and the saying 'too much rope' comes to mind.

Sheri Moon Zombie's performance as Heidi detaches the audience, and you feel no sympathy for her, and the only redeemable character is Francis (Bruce Davison). The expected references of the occult, witchcraft and Satan are at the forefront of this film. However, the setting is underused as most of the film takes place inside, and the iconic visual possibility of Salem is a missed opportunity.

The film offers soft edged visuals conveying an atmosphere that is heavily reminiscent of the satanic horror films of the 1970's. There are some striking scenes and subtle low angle shots which aim to recreate a style similar to Kubrick minus the atmosphere. The 'head trippy' instances are the only artsy scenes of which inspire colour and originality.

Expect a tame and sedated film from Zombie, who has toned down the pace and body count, but cranked up the psychedelic injection of the strange and bizarre. An over complicated story that leads nowhere, leaving the audience feeling lifeless (and not in a good way). If this is Rob Zombie's last horror 'swan song' it disappoints on many levels.

The Lords are coming...horror clichs galore...with meters of rope trailing behind them....

[...]",1367193600,2,1514,4.992063492063492
5346061,5,B009KU2MAM,"One thing about Zombie's films that comes across clearly is his love of the genre. Nowhere is that better demonstrated than in Lords. If you are a long time horror fan, especially going back to the Eurocult films of the 70s (especially the Italians) then you will appreciate it for what it was meant to be. It seems it confused the hell out of some people, which is to be expected if you have no clue about films like ""The Other Hell"" by Bruno Mattei, ""All the Colors of the Dark"" by Sergio Martino, ""Black Magic Rites"" by Renato Polselli, Moctezuma's ""The Mansion of Madness"", De Martino's ""The Antichrist"", various by the better known Lucio Fulci or Dario Argento, or Mario Bava's surreal ""Shock"" or ""Lisa and the Devil"", as well as the other entries in the ""Beyond the Door"" series, just to name a few. It helps to have seen Jean Rollin's work, as well as Jess Franco, and Paul Naschy, to be able to fully appreciate the genius of the Lords. And of course, I cannot forget Ken Russell (especially The Devils, Lair of the White Worm, and Gothic), who Rob Zombie explicitly named as an influence for this film. In other words, if you're exposure to horror is only what's come out- or remade- in the last 20 years or so, then I can see why you might be confused. This is a horror film lover's film, a demon child born of the spirit of its ancestors. Its definitely retro. Vintage Satan.

There's so much going on in this film that I can't wait for it to be released on Blu Ray. My senses were overwhelmed, with so much to process on the visual and sonic levels. I loved every bit of it, by the way. Its not every day you get treated to so much bizarre, demonically inspired imagery and sound,  grotesque surrealism and hallucinatory sequences. And hardly ever in the last 20 years! In terms of acting, ""Margaret Morgan"" stole the show for me. Most of the time, Heidi was onscreen, which was fine, but man, when the original witches, especially Morgan came on, I was riveted, enthralled. The later day witches were also great, once they were revealed for who they were. Overall, the acting was just fine across the board.

Thanks Rob Zombie. Lords is one of my favorite contemporary films. I will view it many times over. I can't wait to crack open the book.

UPDATE: Having received the Blu Ray, I was very disappointed to find that the film is not complete. The DVD/Blu Ray release condenses the story to exclusively follow Heidi's experience. Gone are the scenes dealing with the relationship dynamics between the H Team. Gone are the scenes of how the local women respond to the subsequent playing of the title track, gone are some scenes between the author and his wife, as well as some extra footage of the death metal band. The scenes of Heidi in the room when the Jesus Saves sign was cut down, subsequent time in room 5 also cut, and her time in the baroque hall was also cut. I don't know why. Ken Foree appears in like 2 scenes in this release. I swear he actually had a role and not a cameo. I'm not sure how people who did not see the movie in theatres will experience this but I was disappointed. I am sure most who did see it in theatres will feel cheated. Why did this happen, especially to a movie that had a limited theatrical run? That means most people will not have seen the movie as it was intended to be seen.",1367193600,10,3331,4.402597402597403
5346062,1,B009KU2MAM,"LMFAO!!! Okay, I had to get that out of my system before I get started. I would also like to state that ALL reviews (including mine) are nothing more than opinions from different people. With that being said, I'm a Rob Zombie fan (Music & Movies) and The Lords of Salem was a TOTAL disaster in my opinion. When you sacrifice storyline and character development for the sake of art, most of the time you end up with crap. Most of the movie consists of flashbacks, flash side ways, flash forwards etc. LOL.. I'm seriously not trying to be that harsh on the poor guy, but even the acting was a joke. This is ""B"" movie at best, and not a good one at that. Check out a movie called ""MAMA"", it is a newer horror movie that has a lot more substance than this unholy steaming pile of crap. But don't take my word for it, watch it yourself and see if you can find anything good to say. If you can, please let me know what it was because I must have missed it. And before people start ragging on my review because they are huge Zombie fans and have a hard time not being biased, YES, I understood the movie, And as stated earlier, I'm a Rob Zombie fan who just didn't care for this. John 5 did do a great job on the soundtrack though. I hope his next effort blows us away!",1367107200,9,1262,4.113360323886639
5346063,2,B009KU2MAM,"I accept, in this case at least, that I don't understand Rob's vision when he made ""The Lords of Salem"". I'll go so far as to agree he had some cool scenes if I critique them separately from the movie, but overall, I can't say I was impressed with this disjointed slop.

I've read a few reviews, here and elsewhere, that think he borrowed from Kubrick. I agree to some extent, but I will say he heavily borrowed from Carpenter, in terms of sound effects and camerawork. In fact, he over did it with the Carpenter sound effects. The only part of Zombie that came through the film was Sheri Moon's horrible acting. No offense Rob.

Yes, as other reviewers stated, there are scenes that will stay with you long after you've watched TLOS. For me, that scene (SPOILER ALERT) was when Moon was in the abandoned apartment down the hall, facing a neon cross while a scary, demonic Bigfoot appeared from the dark, growling. That's going to be a forever moment.

If this was viewed in an art class and thought of as a series of snapshots of surreal horror, then I'd say Zombie succeeded. Italian horror director Lucio Fulci once said, ""In Italy, we tried to make films based on pure themes, without a plot, and The Beyond, like Dario Argento's Inferno, refuses conventional and traditional structures"". Maybe this is what Rob Zombie was trying to achieve. I don't know, but if you're looking for a film that makes some kind of sense, then go watch another horror movie. You're wasting your time with this one.

Lastly, (subtle SPOILER ALERT) I'd like to point out to anyone who reads this and to Mr. Zombie in particular--who should take note for future projects--the best witch-burning scene in horror cinema was in ""The Devil's Rain (1975)"". Ernest Borgnine burns while cursing his accuser in a way not seen before or since the movie's release. Classic.

Not worth the ticket price but check it out online when Netflix gets it. Judge for yourself.",1367020800,6,1939,4.657894736842105

5346065,5,B009KU2MAM,"went and caught a late showing of lords of salem the other night, and i was rewarded for my efforts, as I absolutely adored it. there were five other people in the theater, which kind of surprised me, and two of them left mid way through.  I think that kind of sums up how esoteric a movie it was, and I'm amazed something so specific and particular can still get made. it was disturbing, beautiful, blasphemous, and, strangely, it left me feeling kind of upbeat.

the story is basically about immolated witches using what looked like a 78 rpm record in the present time to crack the doorway open for their return via the descendants of their executors.  the vehicle for their musical transmission is local salem deejay Heidi hawthorne, played by sheri moon zombie, who really does a nice job, i thought.  not perfect, but alternately energetic and morose, and always working hard.  in her alone moments, i thought she was most effective, conveying simultaneously what recovering from addiction must be like, as well as what demonic entities entering her head must be like.  she's lost, and nothing helps you get found like a coven of modern-day practicing witches. this film, less than zombie's others, is filled with more seemingly normal people, though many turn out to be not so.  i really thought  judy geeson, patricia quinn, and (especially) dee wallace were awesome as the coven of witches lurking under heidi's nose.  they worked well together, were funny and dark, and, by the end, were very much who I was rooting for.  bruce davison in full jeff bridges regalia was awesome as always, and ken foree and jeff Daniel Phillips were their usual, hardworking, effective selves.  special mention must be made of meg foster, who is sublimely uncomfortable as the crone witch leader of yore.

i was sad that parts such as Barbara crampton's were excised from the film, as well as, i imagine, more of sid haig's and Michael berryman's.  i suspect, while editing, rob knew some of his vision had to be shortened and focused.  i hope the dvd will have a lot of the deleted scenes, so we can see more of lords.  but he was wise to keep this movie at around one hundred minutes.  it felt the perfect length.

i'm so glad I caught lords of salem before it was driven from theaters, as it really demands a theater to be best appreciated.  brandon trost's lens is wide and sweeping at times, saturated with bright, bleeding colors, deep tones and textures.  he captures the grey that is massachusetts to perfection, and he adds weight to every interior shot in the movie..

as has been talked about, there are moments that feel very kubrick-y, and others that recall roman polanski or dario argento.  ken russell's presence is also felt, and i think there's definitely some strong david lynch and david cronenberg vibes floating through this delightful movie. but make no mistake, rob is flexing his talents and artistry, and it's all his.  lords of salem is his auteur masterpiece. gone are the seemingly derivative homages, and what stands is more subtle, or more overt, or more streamlined into the movie, both in terms of the story, as well as its' visuals.  I'm not saying I mind the rest of rob's work, cus I don't, I love it, but the man is progressing.  I've heard he's gonna leave horror for a bit.  that's fine, but I hope it's only temporary.  His work is such a beautiful and courageous and ferocious amalgam of of images and ideas, it would be a shame for our genre to lose him, especially has it has been very much hordes of reactionary and angry horror fans who direct venom his way. but it is the polarizing nature of his work that contributes to what makes him an awesome and integral filmmaker, adding to his skill, his love--really, really informed and ardent love--of the genre, and his irreverence.  he provokes conversation, passion, emotion, energy, debate.  just like good art should.  I love him, and happily paid for my ticket.  I wish I could have paid more.

the music is perfect and the use of the velvet underground's venus in furs and all tomorrow's parties fits it like a glove; twas good to hear in booming theater sound.  The final sequence is one of the best uses of music at the end of a movie that I have ever seen.  It's been in my head all day.  rob has shown a real evolution in his dialogue, and it was pleasant to hear conversations free of insane expletives.  cleverly, he is still able to elicit disgust in much of the dialogue, simply by being smart and describing awful things well, or benign things horribly.  the set design was fantastic, the lighting noticeably brilliant, and the outfits had an argento-esqe level of thoughtfulness and appropriateness.  i also must admit that I loved the amount of smoking in the movie (real people smoke, dammit, especially when they are stressed).  whenever tense moments in movies occur, and no one smokes, it loses credibility for me.  I also love that, in a rob zombie movie, you can count on people watching old, black and white movies in every background teevee. even the wonderful elizabeth montgomery manages to find her way into the film, which made my heart sing a bit.

finally, i hafta mention how gloriously irreverent religiously it was.  it was almost gleeful in it's satanism, and really kind of poses questions like ""why do we just assume satanism is worse than and more barbaric than christianity?""  man, go satan!  it's too bad lords couldn't have gotten enuf pub or a wide enuf release to get on the radar of and start offending religious groups.  that might have brought more folks to the theater.

as always, i come away from a rob zombie movie feeling strangely uplifted, and appreciative of how good life can be, how beautiful and wonderful.  this is kind of a nice effect his movies have on me, and seems antithetical to their content.  but lords of salem was no exception, and, by it's end, I was smiling ear to ear.

**********
just a quick word on the blu ray:  it's absolutely gorgeous.  if you weren't fortunate enuf to see this on a big screen, it really demands to be seen in crisp, beautiful blu.  this movie is, above all else, extremely visual, the sets, the color palette, the salem scenery.  i watched slack jawed as i immersed myself in the textured, sumptuous visual amazingness.  unfortunately, the blu ray, while beautiful, is pretty bare bones, practically no extras of any kind.  let's get a version of this with extras, man!  deleted scenes!  commentaries!  making of featurettes!",1366934400,115,6505,4.696996466431095
5346066,4,B009KU2MAM,"I've read so much hate and disgust for Rob Zombies newest film ""The Lords Of Salem"" that I've been eagerly awaiting to see it myself not just because I love Robs work but also to see what all the fuss is about. It is an evil as hell horror movie if you allow yourself to get sucked into what is happening in the film, not as a fan or critic but just as someone experiencing a piece of art that is meant to leave you in awe. I feel that the lords is a true horror film that is definitely outside of the box and range of casual mainstream horror movie goer. It's root are deep in horror and deals with something that can truly be horrifying, Witchcraft and The Devil.

Of course this isn't a film for everyone, someone looking for another gore fest or cookie cutter teeny bopper horror film should look else where as ""The Lords of Salem"" is a horror film that stands out from the norm in every way possible and delivers itself as a true horror experience.

All these websites, blogs, and reviewers can trash the film but its obvious to me they just don't know a true piece of horror when they see it, one site or actually person in particular is Brad Miska from bloody-disgusting.com, I think he is a horrible reviewer for their website and has bad taste in movie choices. You want to read a review, than check out zombiehamster.com review for the lords, its dead on - zombiehamster.com/reviews/theatrical-release/the-lords-of-salem-2012/.

So now let the hate begin, I know all you angry reviewers/movie watchers out there can't wait to trash my review and give it a bunch of ""Unhelpful"" votes which is fine, I knew what I was getting myself into.

5346067,1,B009KU2MAM,"Well, its a shame writting this review because I had high hopes for Robs New Film. I am a huge fan of his music and most of his films. Check out his new cd by the way, very killer. Loved House of 1000 corpses and Devils REjects. The halloween films are so so and could really go either way. The cartoon movie was kinda interesting but Lords Of Salem was terrible.

Its hard to watch the film because if you are like me, Sheri Moon is a big reason you wanted to watch the movie and it was directed by Rob Zombie. I love the fact Rob puts his wife in his work. Her first major role as the lead. I read Rob was inspired by 70's Italian style horror films and he used his own money to release the picture. Well, Im a huge fan of Old school Lucio Fulci style Italian horror and I can tell you this isn't it. I also read he used infulence from THE SHINNING, I can see it but the wrong parts of it.

Here is the Pros and Cons

Pros
+Pulls no punches
+Interesting Idea (ripping of Evil Dead)
+Sheri as lead
+Rob Zombie as writter/director

Cons
-85 minutes of a 80 year old naked witch (true story)
-Boring cast
-Foolish ending, one of the worst ever (makes you feel like ""why did I watch this"")
-Sheri looks terrible (supposed to play a crack head, I get it but oh boy was rough)
-Film seems too serious for Robs Writting (the talking back and forth is a joke)

The last con you will see what Im talking about when you watch the converstation back and forth about the book written about the LORDS. Rob tried to go for a serious horror film like when he tired in the Halloween films BUT thats just not for him. Rob works better with House of 1000 corpses type films. Crazy texas chainsaw type films. I read a review on IMBD where someone said this was a good as Lucio Fulci's The Beyond. You sir, are insane.

**In a nut shell, I went in excited to see Rob's Idea of The Shinning, mixed with Italian old school horror, mixed with a Rob Zombie Flame but instead got my money wasted. This film had no re watch value, major fail on Zombies part. His fans, most of the stoner types will just go along with it and say they love it.

5346069,2,B009KU2MAM,"I really can't believe how many people like this movie, it has had very mixed reviews and I had to see it for myself being a very big Rob Zombie fan, house of a 1000 corpses and devils rejects were great films, even if they did mimic Texas chainsaw etc, they were full on hardcore in your face horror as were both the Halloween movies, I loved the Halloween remakes for the totally gory violent impact that they are, I was really hoping lords of Salem might deliver some of the same energy given the fact that the story is way different of course to his previous directions, but it was terrible, the movie is so boring building up with a messy surreal story and pointless scares, you really hope that its all building up to a great pay off but it don't, the cast was only ok, Sheri moon cant act and was only good for showing off her bum in a few shots, some of the support cast was good but wasted, as for the effects and surreal imagery it was boring, the only good thing I can say is that the soundtrack is pretty cool, overall Its very disappointing I can hardly believe Zombie made this hard to watch drawn out 96min drivel!! I can now see why this went straight to DVD in the UK, watch it if you must Its really not worth a second viewing, RENT IT.",1366675200,3,1254,4.1646090534979425
8542633,4,B009KU2MAM,"RELEASED IN 2012 and written/directed by Rob Zombie, ""The Lords of Salem"" is a witchcraft/horror flick starring Sheri Moon Zombie as a DJ in Salem, Massachusetts, who is sent a wooden box containing a mysterious record dubbed ""gift from the Lords. The creepy music thereof triggers flashbacks of her town's infamous past. Is Heidi going crazy or are the witches taking revenge on Salem?

The ambiance, mood, directing, music, locations, sets and cast are all top notch, showing that Zombie has developed into a quality director since his first shot eleven years earlier with House of 1000 Corpses, which was shot in 2000. This is serious haunting horror as opposed to the campy black comedy of 1000 Corpses (not that theres anything wrong with that, lol). The movie mixes elements from ""The City of the Dead, aka ""Horror Hotel"" (1960), Suspiria (1977), Rosemarys Baby (1968), The Wicker Man (1973) and To the Devil a Daughter (1976). If you like any of these movies, The Lords of Salem is as good or better.

Usually when you see old hag witches in movies its kinda eye-rolling; not so here. Rob gives us the real deal and its not pretty, although I admit to busting out laughing every time the witches hailed Satan. Speaking of which, modern Wiccans won't like how the films mixes Witchcraft with Satanism (the truth hurts). Interestingly, theres almost as much Christian imagery as there is Satanic.

One things for sure, Zombie doesnt paint witchcraft/Satanism in a positive light. Its similar to The Witch (2015) in this respect, where converting to witch-dom meant becoming a baby-slaughtering, blood-bathing, family-destroying, goat-sucking, friggin pedophile hag with the illusion of youth. When the Devil eventually appears in Lords, its anything but a positive image.

The story seems to perpetuate the myth that those condemned at the Salem Witch Trials in 1692-1693 were burned to death. Actually, 19 people were hung, another slowly crushed to death, and over 150 imprisoned.

Sheri makes for a strong protagonist, but shes the extant of any eye candy on the female front. As noted earlier, the witches are all hideous hags and look even uglier with their clothes off. Meg Foster surprisingly appears as the lead witch. Meanwhile, Judy Geeson, Patricia Quinn and Dee Wallace are on hand as a dubious trio in modern Salem. Speaking of whom, they have a great (hilarious) tea scene with Bruce Davison, who plays an expert on witchcraft.

THE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 41 minutes and was shot in Salem, Massachusetts; Sable Ranch, Santa Clarita, California (witches dancing around fire); and the Los Angeles Theatre (opera house).

It did it's job extremely well but I have a suggestion, don't watch it late at night when you're alone. I will most likely not watch it again for a while and when I do watch The Lords Of Salem again, it will be in the day. this is a confusing review I'm sure, I loved the movie and basically it will stay with me for a long time. I recommend watching it, if you have anxiety like I do watch it with other people around.",1524355200,,571,3.847457627118644
