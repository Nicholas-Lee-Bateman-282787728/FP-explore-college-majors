8397912,5,B003J6S0DQ,"Long Vacation is considered the gold standard for Japanese Doramas.  The actors, the direction, the script, and the soundtrack are considered by most Japanese and Western dorama fans as their favorite.  The story is as relevant today as it was in 1996.  Long Vacation won most Japanese TV drama awards (their Emmy equivalent) for that year.  It also put Kimura Takuya from SMAP up front as a top actor in Asia.

Its my understanding that Taiwan was given an in-country licensing deal for many J-doramas a decade or so ago, and I have found the DVD quality from Taiwan fairly good.  If J-dorama sets come from Korea or HK (especially HK)  the quality can be sketchy because of poor dubbing.  In Japan or from online Japanese outlets, its available for more than $130 but its without English subtitles!  However you can find readily Long Vacation Eng-subbed dvds online in US for about $20.  Whether you buy it from Amazon or elsewhere, I hope youll check it out.  The Soundtrack CDs are also available for $10 each or less, and youll probably want one of them after watching the DVD!",1528329600,,1082,4.671957671957672
8397913,1,B003J6S0DQ,"I love this J-drama.  It's one of my absolute favorites, no joke.  But I have to say it-- this DVD is a bootleg.  As of yet no J-dramas have been licensed for US release, ever. Any drama boxset that is both: A) ""All region"" (as opposed to R1 for North America, etc.); and B) both Chinese and English subtitled is almost assuredly a bootleg, and bootlegs are notorious for poor quality translations/subtitling.  Don't waste your money!",1315526400,9,434,4.671052631578948
