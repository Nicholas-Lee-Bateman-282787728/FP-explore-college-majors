8668326,4,B00LVANKOG,"This is a powerful and moving film, and well worth seeing, but unless you need a PAL/region 2 version, the newer Olive Films blu-ray and DVD are far better.  At least they present the film in the correct 1:85 widescreen aspect ratio, and not the 4:3 version offered in this German edition.  The picture and sound in the newer US release are stronger on all counts.

I'm giving this 5 star film, 4 stars for the underwhelming presentation.

As for the film itself: Given the weak reviews, I was shocked at how moving and poetic this portrait of street bums in the 30s was.  Streep and Nicholson are both magnificent, but the whole supporting cast is good.  It has flaws  its a little overlong, there the occasional heavy handed moment.  But its also a deeply moving portrait of lost souls trying to find meaning in a very cold world.  Heavy and grim, yes.  But so is a lot of great drama.",1445385600,,887,4.453416149068323
