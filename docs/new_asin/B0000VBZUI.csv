8003707,5,B0000VBZUI,"This film is by far the best documentary that I've seen on days of the dead. Made several years ago, it is very culturally current and offers a very insightful view into the world of Nov 1 and 2nd. The authors address the perspective of the mexicanamerican viewer as well as those of another culture. The appreciation for these days and the preparations leading up to them is phenomenal and I have shown this to my classes for the last 10 years and everyone has come away with a heightened awareness and knowlegde of these very siginificant days in Mexico as well as anywhere where her children and descendants reside. The voices are timeless in this documentary. Anyone teaching culture and or language of Mexico, Mesoamerica or Latinamerica would do well to have this doc in their collection.",1267574400,3,794,4.760869565217392
