Kries has put together an excellent set of DVD's that are great for the beginner and intermediate pilates learners, as she gives variations on the moves depending on your level. She gives clear instruction in all of the moves and I somehow manage to not get bored in the middle. Each DVD has two different ~20-25 minute segments focusing on different areas, coming to a total of 6 different workouts. There are also short segments for warming up and stretching as well. If you are looking for a work out you can do 3x/week and not feel repetitive, this is the way to go! If I have time, I like to do her warm up, two of the workouts, and her flow/flexibility cool down, coming to an 80 minute work out. Otherwise you can just do one or two of the workouts, but I try to do the flow/flexibility segment every time, and I feel amazing afterwards!",1456876800,,973,4.351648351648351

8071443,5,B000A0D1M4,"This series/ instructor is wonderful.  She is calm, statuesque, and patient - at the end of her workouts, you feel like you've worked oput with your best friend rather than having been pummelled by some hyperperky blond thing that makes you feel inferior no matter what you do...",1361059200,,279,4.8125
8071444,2,B000A0D1M4,"I just had a baby and while I worked out 8 months of the pregnancy I couldn't the last month...I thought this would be a good workout to help jump start my weight loss goals after the birth but there is no way this will tone, lift, or help you loose pounds. I do turbo jam, turbo fire, brazil butt lift, and I love jennifer kries precision toning all concentrated on the middle section! If your goal is to loose pounds or get tone this won't do it. this will only help you stay there if you are already very well there! very dissapointed :(",1348790400,2,540,4.152380952380953

8071446,5,B000A0D1M4,"I have been using the Jennifer Kries Perfect mix DVD for years.  I love it.  When I bought the 3 DVD set I became completely hooked.  It is low impact, but really packs toning excercises into a short period of time.  It is hard to follow at first but once you have done it a few times it is golden!  I highly recommend this product, it helped me go from a size eight to a size 2/4 and as a massage therapist it has strenghtened core muscles which are essential to proper body mechanics!",1173312000,16,486,4.127659574468085
8071447,5,B000A0D1M4,"I love these DVDs.  I use perfect mix the most, I really like the metabolic booster part because you get a cardio workout while toning your arms, legs, and core.  There is also a fabulous yoga part at the end which is a real treat after all that hard work.  The precision pilates DVD has a 20 min arm workout and a 20 minute leg workout.  I like to do the core conditioning on perfect mix, then pair it with the precision pilates DVD for 60 minutes of arms, legs, and core.  I feel very toned and refreshed after that combination.  The 3 dimensional toning has a really fun dance segment, but the core workout is kind of lame.  I never do it, I use the one from perfect mix instead.  Overall, I use these DVDs on a regular basis.  I enjoy Jennifer Kries, her enthusiasm is encouraging and she is not annoying.  You just have to keep in mind that she has super human flexibility or you will hurt yourself!",1169424000,20,904,4.233918128654971
