8458468,1,B000F6YWN0,"I think that Mozarts music shuld be played as it was writen and intended to be played by himself, not a mock of African or New Orleans Jass style music. Mozart will be turning around in his grave if he hears this obsenity and profanity of his music. The only place to deserve to store this DVD after watching it is in the garbage. I am so sorry to waste my money in this piece of music murder.
