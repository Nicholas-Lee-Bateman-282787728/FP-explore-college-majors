4272063,2,B0046ZYETI,"Well , I think that this trial of making a film by a indian producer , with some indian actors , including a big star , using the occidental way of making movies didn't result at all . As a BD or even a DVD the product is very good . Hrithik Roshan continues to be one of the biggest dancers in India , but nothing more . The story is absolutely boring.",1295222400,4,353,3.8493150684931505
4272064,5,B0046ZYETI,"There are two versions of this movie.  The original Bollywood version and a 'remix' made by a Hollywood Hack.  The Bollywood version has better plot, a cool dance number, and better character development.  The Hollywood Hack version cuts a lot of character, all the dancing, and jumps to the action straight away.  If the movie is 120 minutes or longer, it is the Bollywood version.  THAT IS THE ONLY VERSION ONE SHOULD BUY.

5 Stars is for the Bollywood version - massively entertaining.

*** Both versions are available on this disc and the video/audio quality of both is absolutely reference level.  Beautiful Blu-ray experience.",1290470400,6,632,5.009615384615385
4272065,5,B0046ZYETI,"I really enjoyed this movie, I do think it could have been better if some parts would've been edited out. The movie starts with a bang and keeps getting better. I have seen it.....I would estimate 5 times and the movie is just better when you watch it for a second time. I recommend Kites for viewers who are interested in seeing something unconventional. This movie really appealed to me because I like Bollywood, I'm Mexican, and because I speak both Spanish and English. This movie should have been released in Mexican theaters.",1286064000,4,531,4.720430107526882
4272066,5,B0046ZYETI,"Reality and subtlety are the twin enemies of Bollywood, and here's Exhibit A: Anurag Basu's multilingual action-romance about an Indian stud (Roshan) who falls in love with the gorgeous Mexican fiance (Mori) of his wealthy girlfriend's brother while in Las Vegas. (Got all that? Good.) Cribbing from countless Tinseltown efforts, this music-video-cum-perfume-ad is awash in excessively melodramatic flashbacks, car chases and references to the domestic illegal-immigration debate. It's a film that proves the concept overwrought is the same in every language.

Great movie by Hrithik. Absolute stunning. Real superstar of Bollywood.",1279238400,4,632,5.945054945054945
4272067,2,B0046ZYETI,"Watching the trailer is much better than watching the whole movie. You will not miss anything if u have watched the trailer.

Very disappointing for Hrithik Fans.

Generally Hrithik movie has style , Songs , Dance and action sequences . You will miss all in this movie . ... See More

There is a just 1 dance sequence for 10 mins and Hrithik did a good job . but , that's it ...don't expect music from the movie .

As a Hrithik fan , I was disappointed by the story line too.",1279152000,5,475,4.130434782608695
4272068,5,B0046ZYETI,"'Kites' was specifically made to appeal to Western sensibilities--it's not the first Bollywood film to try to crossover, but it is the first to succeed at it, and it does so while remaining true to the essence of Hindi cinema. 'Kites' looks like an American film, but it feels like an Indian one.

It's not the best Bollywood movie--not by a long shot--but by stripping itself of the typical trappings of Hindi films (and making itself stylistically familiar to Westerners), it reveals the heart of Bollywood--a beating, bleeding operatic heart. Hindi cinema is ultimately not about language or culture or musical numbers; it's about exalted melodrama that draws you in despite yourself and affects you with life's corniness and agony.

The story is set in Las Vegas; the actors speak a combination of Hindi, English, and Spanish; there is only one dance scene; and the plot follows a single sequence of events--all of which help make the film accessible to non-Indian audiences. Director Anurag Basu was the perfect choice for this project as his style naturally lends itself to the objective. Had his previous film, 'Life in a...Metro' (2007), been marketed abroad as aggressively as 'Kites' has been, it would have garnered the same critical praise in the U.S that his latest film has. Cinematographer Ayananka Bose produces sharp, gorgeous shots of the glitz of Las Vegas, the desolation of the desert, and the beauty of the leads, Indian superstar Hrithik Roshan and Mexican actress Barbara Mori.

Roshan and Mori play struggling immigrant hustlers Jay and Linda, who are about to marry into money--they are engaged to sister and brother Gina (Kangana Ranaut) and Tony (Nick Brown), the children of a ruthless crime boss/casino owner (Kabir Bedi). The night before Linda's wedding to Tony, she and Jay stay up until dawn drinking champagne, sharing their tales of woe in a broken hodgepodge of languages, and dancing in the rain. And after one brief, trembling, feel-it-in-your-toes, forbidden kiss, they foolishly, nobly chuck their gold-digging schemes for each other.

Even in love scenes devoid of explicit sex, Roshan is expert at appearing to teeter on the edge of control, and his precarious desire is hotter than bared skin could ever be (see his performances in 'Dhoom 2' and 'Jodhaa Akbar' for more examples)--although bare his skin he does--at least, his eye-popping torso--in between exciting stunts and car chases, as the lovers flee Tony, who's hell-bent on murderous revenge, and adorably struggle to communicate along the way.

'Kites' proves it is possible to fall in love--with people or films--even when you can't understand their language.

'Kites' is rated Must See.

Watch him dance in one of the dream sequences in Guzaarish.  This man is a triple threat!

Kites was action packed and the story was well told. I have watched Guzaarish since seeing Kites and both movies left me emotionally drained and gut wrenched!

I prefer the longer Bollywood version...much more to the storyline &acting, versus the more action packed Remix version...but both version are good.  Check out Hrithik Roshan on Youtube or on the internet for the list of all of his films..he has some fantastic  work out there. A few of his films are: Jodha Akbar, Zindagi Na Dobera Mi (not sure of the exact title but a VERY good romance, comedy) Dhoom2 (he dances), Agneepath (has some violence but it's necessary for the tale of love), Lakshya, Guzaarish.  On YOUTUBE (HE DANCES!!!) watch ""Come Fall In Love"" and his first tv interviews on ""Rendezvous with Simi Garawal"" (first interview he did with his parents, the 2nd part of that one he did alone) on Youtube.  SUCH A NICE MAN IN REAL LIFE!!!  You'll be amazed at how good he is.  I think he should be the next James Bond!!  He has a fanclub on Facebook, Hrithikrules.com, and he is on Facebook as ""Hrithik Roshan"" and he and Hrithikrules.com are both on twitter.  Have fun discovering the amazing actor, Hrithik Roshan!

4272327,1,B0046ZYETI,"I love watching Barbara Mori's other telenovelas and she is still as eye-candy as ever but I hope she stops making Bollywood movies.

PROS:
- Barbara Mori is a great actress but she's given corny love or poetry lines in this movie.

CONS:
- The male actor is horrrrible.  Need I repeat that?
- Bollywood tried to cram every feature of American movies into this movie and it doesn't work.
- Stupid comedy scenes like when they run out of a bank and he gets hit by car door.
- The character for the male actor is a dancer/action hero/doctor who can stitch open wounds/ and can take out the entire mafia in the last scene all by himself... I'm surprised he didn't take them all out with his bare hands! Geez.
- Cheap peeping-tom shot down Barbara Mori's blouse of her cleavage in the car scene after robbing the bank.
- Shallow character development:  How in the world did Barabara Mori's character fall in love with the male actor?  In the last scene, why would the butler betray his loyal mafia family by running over the Mafia's son??
- Not believable logic: At the wedding scene, how is it that the male actor can remember the long line ""I love you"" in Spanish yet he can't remember to say ""Si"" to accept his wedding vow???
- Too many stupid car chase scenes to try to be like American movies like when they drive down the road and can make all the police cars flip and do loop-de-loops.  Geez.
- Too predictable because of dumb director: the scene after the wedding where his friend comes out to give them their passports and the camera frames him standing in front of the window forever as if he's waiting to be shot and I guessed that correctly.  Geez.
- The title ""KITES"" is a good analogy but had nothing to do with the movie other than being poetic.
- In the last scene where he is able to single-handedly shoot all the mafia members down, my gosh he is super human; I was expecting the next scene to show him leap tall buildings in a single leap too.

TO BARBAR MORI: You're a much much better actress than this.  PLEASE stop making these B-movies.  I own your other movies like RUBI and I've seen the wonderful movies that you're capable of.  I'm glad to see you've tried something new but you're best at the dialog scenes, not action hero.

SUMMARY: Stay far far away from this movie.  I lost count of how many times I wanted to turn this movie off but I had to see how beautiful Barbara Mori is and her great acting skills.  Movie has a lot of shallow checkoff list of features but no depth.",1344902400,2,2502,4.329764453961456

I bought this movie as I loved the Hindi version and wanted to experience an English version. (I don't speak Hindi, but thanks to the movies I'm learning a few words).

I enjoyed this movie as one of Hrithik Roshan's newer films, especially as I was able to understand the dialogue without having to read it, but I think it lost a bit in the remix.

Hrithik plays the part of J a young guy who falls in love with the wrong woman Linda/Natasha played by Barbara Mori. It has a sad ending, so be warned, but it is still a beautiful love story and one of my favourites.

The story is basically the same (30 minutes cut with a bit extra included), but the sound track is completely different to the Hindi (Original) version. That was a big loss to me. I love the music Rajesh Roshan put to the original movie - I also bought that soundtrack. The car chase (should I say truck chase) scene is not quite the same without Tum Bhi Ho Wohi as the background tune.

Hrithik can dance and this was a big part of the attraction of this movie for me. The part where J takes up with Gina and they compete in a dance contest is cut (just a very small part of their dance is kept) and I felt that this is a big loss to the movie. The part that is cut also shows how J is accepted into the family.

I agree with the statement on the back of the DVD cover ""hot, sexy, exotic and wild"" but I was quite happy with the more modest Hindi version. It is not as explicit as some Hollywood movies (thank goodness), I prefer movies that leave things up to your imagination!

This is the 2 DVD set from Amazon and it has both the Hollywood Remix and the Bollywood version packaged in it. Unfortunately, there are no Special Features on either disc.

The original Hindi movie has special features - Song Making and Making of the Film with a Hindi Version and an International Version - very entertaining.

Would I watch it again? Probably, (I have seen it twice already), but I prefer the music and action of the original Hindi version. Friends who have seen it agree that the original is better, but it is still a great movie.

My advice is: watch both and make up your own mind.",1332547200,3,2280,4.472289156626506

4272331,5,B0046ZYETI,"I love,love,love this movie! Never get tired watching it. Hrithik and Barbara Mori ecxellent toghether. This is an experiment for Bollywood because it incorporate elements of Hollywood to please the western audience. This means a lot of action in a beautiful love story, a mexican actress as co-star an little dancing scenes usually seen in Bollywood movies.",1329523200,,358,5.298245614035087
4272332,1,B0046ZYETI,"Although Hrithik Roshan heads the cast and the film is in Hindi, I would say this film attempts to be an American story,and I don't respect many films coming out of Hollywood these days.  Kites was terrible.  I love Bollywood and other Indian film Industries, have watched hundreds of Indian films, and this is the worst I have ever taken the time to see.  Violent, disheartening, and without value!",1327104000,2,399,4.753623188405797
4272333,1,B0046ZYETI,"This movie was such a ridiculous waste--of time and money! It was like a hijacked version of Devdas--which was SO MUCH BETTER! The ending was dumb. Don't waste your time or money on this movie. Even if it had strong musical numbers, this movie would have sucked! It was hyped up so big before it came out that I practically ran to go see it when it did and was kicking myself for the error in judgement by time it was over. I love Hritik Roshan but he should've just said no to this movie. What a disappointment. If I could have given it less than one star, I would have!",1325462400,2,571,4.153153153153153
4272334,2,B0046ZYETI,I love these actors but I did not like this script. It was like driving down 40 miles of bad road without interesting landscapes. Really dark and hopeless. I felt like the script set me up for one ending and delivered another. Disappointing.,1324684800,,241,4.627906976744186
4272335,4,B0046ZYETI,"I bought both the ""Bollywood"" version and the ""Hollywood"" version.  I much preferred the ""B"" version. It is longer and has more of Indian movie style with the song and dance which is such a huge part of Bollywood. It also gives you a better understanding of the characters and the story.

If you are already a fan of Hrithik Roshan you will not be disappointed.  This wasn't the best written movie because I feel they tried to go in to many directions.  That being said, I think both Barbara Mori and Hrithik Roshan did a beautiful job of bringing your emotions to the surface. I love the fact that Roshan is trying to break the language barrier and make more universal movies.  I'm sorry this was not as big a hit as projected but I do hope that he continues to make movies that can relate with more than just the Indian audience.  His acting is as good as his looks...and that's saying a lot!",1319155200,3,894,4.355421686746988

4272348,5,B0046ZYETI,What can I say?  Barbara Mori is a great actress and no matter what movie she stars in or supporting role.  She lights up the screen. This movie was good!,1312416000,,154,4.1
4272349,5,B0046ZYETI,"First of all, let me say the Story is nothing outstanding, but what really makes this movie an amazing ride is the execution and the acting.  The lead actos, Hrithik Roshan (Bollywood Superstar) and Barbara Mori (Mexican Superstar) do an Amazing job acting in this movie.  They are both very good looking, and their acting is flaw less.  Barbara Mori's acting is truly outstanding, and she stands out for sure.  I am very surprised Hollywood hasn't picked up on her yet!!  Bollywood Director Anurag Basu does a masterful job keeping us laughing, crying, enjoying the movie with his twist and turns.  This is truly a movie where Hollywood meets Bollywood, and the result is an out and out entertainer.  If you are reading this, and trying to decide if you want to watch this or not, watch the movie, you won't regret it.

I also really enjoyed the scene where the two kidnap an innocent man and his take him for a ride.  That actor did a very good job in such a short span, he made me laugh out loud!!  His acting with the two superstars was outstanding, and definitely one of the highlights of the movie.  Very funny scene!!!

In my opinion, a must watch movie that will Entertain you for sure!!!",1311033600,2,1196,4.537383177570093
4272350,4,B0046ZYETI,"I won't go into the story plot but Kites has a good story line and was well performed by Hrithik and Barbara Mori(almost looking like Catherine Zeta Jones).The chemistry is all there between these 2 actors and it's endearing to see them communicating with each other in their own languages,one in Hindi and the other in Spanish with some funny results! As usual, Hrithik can dance like no other Bollywood actors can( perhaps a close second by Salman Khan)and it's always a pleasure to see him working some fancy moves in one dance routine. All in all a good movie to enjoy.",1309046400,,573,4.627450980392157
4272351,5,B0046ZYETI,"Kites is very different from the typical Hindi movie and is more of a fusion between Bollywood and Hollywood.  With that said, Kites is one of the best Hrithik movies ever made.  I've been his fan since the beginning of his acting career.

I'm not going to provide a synopsis since that's already available in the other reviews.  All I will say is that Kites has everything from action, romance, drama, and comedy.  You will smile, laugh, and maybe even cry.

I also want to note that Hrithik and Barbara have great chemistry.  This is her first Bollywood movie and she did a fantastic job even with the language barrier.

Finally, if your a Hrithik fan or would like to see more of his movies then check out the following(fav) list:

1.)Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham
2.)Kites
3.)Dhoom 2
4.)Guzaarish
5.)Krrish
6.)Jodhaa Akbar
7.)Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai
8.)Mission Kashmir

There are plenty more, but these should be a good start.  Feel free to ask me if you have any questions.  Hope your like the movie.",1308528000,2,995,4.655172413793103
4272352,3,B0046ZYETI,"This is the review of the unedited version which was released in India.
Kites is an attempt to go international by Mr. Hrithik Roshan. Primarily shot in New Mexico and California, Kites is about Jai, a vagabond who wants to make a quick buck but somehow has never managed to nail the big bucks. In walks in Kangna Ranaut, the daughter of the biggest casino owner in Vegas, sensing an opportunity Hrithik romances her. However fate has other plans, as he falls in love with Kangna's brother fiance Barbra Mori.
There are many positives in this film; Hrithik Roshan once again shows that it is possible for an actor to rise above a mundane script. He gets to act, dance, sing and explode a lot of cars. Barbra Mori is a great screen presence. She and Roshan share great chemistry. The music which has been the forte of Rakesh Roshan movies is not appealing at all. The dialogue is a mixture of Hindi, English and Spanish, mostly the latter two which I thought was a big negative. Direction is okay, the director Basu, known for his earlier work Life.....in a Metro, which was an average movie at best, definitively have way of stylizing scenes but I wish he had a sense of narration .However  these flaws apart, Kites is still a watchable feast of colors which flutters before falling to earth. Three stars.",1302393600,2,1305,4.600858369098712
4272353,3,B0046ZYETI,"I didn't know that it was a Hollywood version of that beautiful movie. What a shame! I think the Bollywood version it s such way much better. And I noticed because I saw the original one. Looks like its something missing in the movie. I had to explain to the others why certain things happened. Looks like discontinuous sequences. Where is the scene with the dance with J. and Julia (the girl who danced with him at the Dance Contest?) i don't understand why they deleted that gorgeous scene. And they added the love scene! for what? i felt disappointed!
I really thought you were sending me the Original version (the next time im gonna write it down this: I WANT THE ORIGINAL MOVIE MADE IN INDIA)
Thanks any way.

Either way, this film is fantastic, high budget and very creative. I dare you to watch it and not cry at some point in the movie. It is very powerful.",1299024000,2,359,4.202898550724638

To Kiss a girl? this is forbiden for indian actors and actresses and he did it I think he is the 1st one to brake this rule.
Nest no sex scene in indian movies,he broke again the rule. I am sorry because he did not get all the awards from this move in his country,but is not late. He is young,gorgeous,talentated,but way to many rules are in front of all indians actors to be brake because India has traditions some of them good soame not so good.
