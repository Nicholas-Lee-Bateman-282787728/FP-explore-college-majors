8297184,3,B001E96KGE,"It does work and my cats did use the concept for several months, but they became very messy after a while.  It worked for a minute, but when water splashed on them without the kitty litter they would mess in other area of the house.  NOT COOL AT ALL.",1363305600,,250,4.081632653061225
8297185,5,B001E96KGE,"The great thing about this product is you don't have to be a genius or a cat expert to make it work. It's very simple to follow, and inexpensive as well. However, in case you do have any mishaps, everything is clearly outlined on what to do if you run into any difficulties. Our cat had a couple of setbacks, but in the end, has been using the toilet no problem for over a year now, including when we go away on the weekends. It's way easier to get a friend to cat sit for you when they don't have to clean out a stinky, disgusting litter box -- they just need to flush the toilet! I think it would be ideal for those who live in an apartment or condo. Though we live in a house, we prefer to keep our cat indoor-only, so having her use the toilet is really ideal. Although we have two bathrooms now and we do keep one bathroom dedicated more or less for her, for a long time the whole family (including the cat) shared one toilet, and she never messed up the toilet -- it wasn't gross to share. Totally recommend!",1325289600,6,1014,4.100502512562814
8297186,5,B001E96KGE,Following the steps as directed and so far both cats have been coming along nicely.  Wonderful product!,1232496000,6,103,5.0588235294117645
