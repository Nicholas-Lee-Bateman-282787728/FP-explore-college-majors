1197236,2,B000009DIU,this movie blows!  i wasted my money on this one.  i watched it and the whole plot just sucks.  why would i watch a movie where the main weapon is a song.  Do not waste your time with this one.,954720000,2,193,3.75
1197237,4,B000009DIU,"i keep hearing people say Macross II is bad but to me if your're looking for something good to buy ,then buy this because it sure is better then Ghost in the shell and Ninja scroll .And all my friend who watch Macross II  agree it is good like mad . So if i were you i'll buy it ,you won't regret  it.",949622400,,301,3.761904761904762
1197238,3,B000009DIU,"I just rented Macross 2 last night, what a stinker. I have to give it credit for good animation but the plot was horrible. Make sure you do not add this title to your anime collection!",930096000,,184,4.138888888888889
1197239,5,B000009DIU,"The first time I saw this movie I was hooked!  Great characters, great storyline and good dubbing.  I got really attached to the main character and I really hope they make a sequel. I've heard of Macross Plus but I have  not seen it yet.  I've heard its preety good too, so if you like this movie  you should try Macross Plus.  But really Macross II is a great movie!!",928972800,,368,4.185714285714286
1197240,4,B000009DIU,"Macross 2 is one of the best animes ever made, it is second only to Macross Plus.  The animation is beautiful and it is one of those animes that you can watch over and over.  If you don't really watch many animes  but have seen and liked ones such as Akira or the Neon Genesis Evangelion  series, I suggest that you buy this one.",924307200,,329,4.09375

1197247,4,B000009DIU,I have always enjoyed Kenichi Yatagai's work and Macross II is a classic that any collector would want in their collection.  I have been wanting this movie for a long time and now it is mine.,1418688000,,191,4.305555555555555
1197248,2,B000009DIU,"Great anime, although it doesn't showcase the mech much",1418515200,,55,5.222222222222222

1197250,5,B000009DIU,"More Robotech goodness! This film is a little dated, but if you like Robotech you most likely will enjoy it.",1412985600,,108,4.45

1197264,5,B000009DIU,"Macross 2 is the best animated series to come out of Japan. The animation is a masterpiece,the story is the same.",1394496000,,113,4.428571428571429
1197265,5,B000009DIU,"I've been watching this movie since it was on VHS. For quite awhile this dvd had commanded at least a $30 price tag. Not too long ago it dropped near $20 so I had to grab it. Love this old school Anime. It's what I grew up on. Action, drama, sic fi, and a bit of romance, this Anime has got it all. Like Macross? Check this out. Don't know what that is? Look into it. Love the old school style? The peep this.",1377734400,,409,3.880952380952381
1197266,2,B000009DIU,"Where to begin with this one? Even though the plot follows the original show's formula of the Earth fighting aliens who want to kill everyone, this six-episode OVA leaves a lot of irritating plotholes. We have no idea who these aliens are outside of their names and we get no explanations to what their motivations are outside of... ""kill everyone that's different from us"". We don't even get an origin story with these guys and what their connection to the Zentraedi is. It's just... ""Hey, we're the Marduk and we're here to kill you."" That bit of info would have been nice to know since the Marduk can control the Zentraedi with alien opera. Oh.. and for a guy who's supposed to be the hero of the story, Hibiki;s completely useless! I know the guy's just a reporter and we shouldn't expect him to be Bruce Lee, but after the first episode, he becomes completely pointless. Ishtar, one of those Marduk opera singers I mentioned, contributes far more to the story than him. That's a big problem with these kind of OVA's very little or nothing gets explained. And Macross II is no exception.

The music's bad. The animation quality goes from bad to downright unwatchable. And there are holes in the plot big enough to fly a Zentraedi battle cruiser through.",1359849600,,1257,4.662162162162162

1197268,4,B000009DIU,"This is a good film but not quite as good as the origenal but it makes a good watch.
If you like the origenal series you will enjoy this.",1355011200,,137,3.7586206896551726
1197269,2,B000009DIU,"I bought this for nostalgic reasons, only to find out that I bought half of a movie. Chapter 1 through 4 are present (at least in the digital/kindle version). 5 and 6 are missing completely. Very disappointing. If and when the complete video is posted, it will be around 2 hours and 40 minutes.",1345075200,,294,4.462962962962963
1197270,2,B000009DIU,I want to point out that the streaming video version up on Amazon is missing a little over an hour of video.  It isn't supposed to end after 92 minutes.  The total actual length is 160 minutes.  Given two stars because of the missing video.,1337385600,,240,4.288888888888889
1197271,5,B000009DIU,"I won't review the movie here..I'm sure all of you have seen it!  As with much Anime' there is some really fantastic music!  It made me a fan of Mika Kaneko! The opening tune ""Hush like 200 Million Years"" is a real RAWKER!  The closing tune ""Lovers Again"" sounds almost like Journey would if Steve Perry was replaced by a Japanese singer!  The full versions of those songs can be found if you're willing to do a bit of hunting.  ""Lovers Again"" is also out there in a Karaoke/Off Vocal Version!",1333670400,,493,4.373626373626373
1197272,3,B000009DIU,"Though this is not on the same level as the original Robotech, Macross II, the Movie has all the elements and excitement of the original  with attack of a new type of Zentradi,(the Meltron,) and a little more with information on the background of UN Spacey as well as the world at large since the destruction of Earth's surface. With the subsequent melding of the Zentadi and Earth residents, it also sews up a few loose ends from the Robotech series. Its not very long and focuses on a young reporter named, Hibiki, and follows his exploits in the attempt to expose UN Spacey and prove they are withholding vital info from the general public and is replacing same with propaganda. All the while he is trying to hide his association with a young girl he befriends after finding her abandoned during a Zentradi attack. You still get the military action and excitement while a bit of suspense is peppered in with an ending that will please even the most die hard Robotech fans. Enjoy!",1305504000,,982,4.611428571428571
1197273,5,B000009DIU,Was a great Anime back in the day and is classic now. I have watched this over and over and still cant get enough of this series.,1300233600,,129,3.814814814814815
1197274,4,B000009DIU,"Exceptionally animated, realistic imagery and exciting technological diagrams. The story line is a bit short but the characters are very interesting. You see, with Robotech animated episodes, the plot is more true to life than Transformers, I think Robotech is targeted for mature audiences and people who aspire to be engineers of aircraft and military weapons, albeit fantasy but they say boys will be boys and I admit these cartoons were a powerful source of inspiration and motivation in my daily life when I was a young boy.",1299542400,,529,5.0227272727272725
1197275,4,B000009DIU,"This is another story of its own,but it relates to the macross series. Somewhere in the macross series certain events happen through out the macross/robotech series. If you like macross or robotech anime then I would suggest getting this one for the collection",1270425600,,260,5.069767441860465
1197276,2,B000009DIU,"Every review I have read here is talking about Macross Plus - an entirely different series produced several years after this.  Macross II is the first sequal series to Macross.  The first half is an intriguing set-up for a series, but the second half is lackluster and delivers no real pay-off.  PLUSES:  The character designs by original Macross designer Haruhiko Mikimoto are fantastic.  The animation and space battles for the first half of the story is great.  The universe feels like a natural extension of the original series.  MINUSES:  Poor second half, both in terms of animation quality and storytelling.  Overall, a worthwhile diversion for Macross fans, and any fan of Mikimoto or Kawamori's designs.  And still light years better than Macross Zero or the infantile Macross 7 which inexplicably ran for many years.  Enjoy.",1223596800,4,834,5.103703703703704
1197277,5,B000009DIU,I found this movie to be full of action and true life experiences.  A truly great story.,1216598400,,88,4.176470588235294
1197278,2,B000009DIU,"This DVD is the North American release of the six-volume OVA release; this film edits the six episodes into a compilation movie.  Since the creators of the original Macross series had no involvement with this project, this sequel series is usually considered an ""alternate timeline"" story.  By the time I finished watching this film, I had a hard time believing it was an actual sequel to Macross.  Even though the story is set 80 years into the future, there was very little that I saw or heard in the movie that tied this back to the original Macross series.

This DVD is also rather skimpy when it comes to special features.  It felt like more of this area was devoted to trailers and advertisements for Manga Entertainment (the company that released this DVD) than on providing actual special features for the movie.

If you're a Macross fan that wants everything Macross-related, then this DVD would be for you.  However, if you're a Macross fan that's not interested in seeing an ""alternate timeline"" story for the franchise, then you're probably better off not watching this DVD.",1206489600,,1086,4.837837837837838
1197279,3,B000009DIU,"I loved the Macross film ""Do you remember love"" very much, so I thought I'd give this 2nd film a try, hoping it would extend the splendid journey set out by the original Marcoss.  But I was utterly disappointed.  The storyline copies so much from the first film, basically you have a love triangle again between the male lead and two female leads, and this time again the alien invaders are defeated by a love song.  This plot worked out very good and very effective in Do You Remember Love, but here it's just weak, so weak that it seems the makers of the film didn't really bother with it, that all they wanted is to capitalize on the success of the previous film.  The quality of the animation is at best acceptible.  Like a reviewer commented earlier, the characters are like cardboard cutout, very cliche, with absolutely no depth and no development.  However, the songs in the film are very good, especially the theme Love Song.  When the female lead, Ishtar, sings the song in front of the huge alien fleet near the end of the film, it is very beautiful, so beautifully done that I thought it was the only part that's worth watching repeatedly.  So in my opinion the music really saves this film from oblivion.",1162512000,,1217,4.525114155251141
1197280,5,B000009DIU,"The 3 main characters go through the same end-fate as Lynn Minmei, Rick Hunter, & Lisa Hayse. (Does that make Kyle like Marduk?) It's basically the original Robotech crossed over with Audrey Hepburn's Roman Holiday (the similarities are outstanding). The English music bites the big one, so I highly reccomend watching it subed.

Also reccomend Gall Force: Eternal Story & Wind of Amnisia.",1128816000,,389,5.174603174603175
1197281,3,B000009DIU,"It's not a bad anime.

But the story lacks the 'soul' and the connection with characters that you have with the original macross. Another story that uses the macross name and have no direct relation with the original story.",1119830400,,223,4.717948717948718
1197282,4,B000009DIU,"First off, I want to say that this work is nowhere near as good as the rest of the Macross sequel offerings (Macross Plus, Macross Zero, Macross 7, etc).

That being said, I think that this series is unfairly being compared to it's siblings, that are paradigms of the genre (kinda like Alien 3, which in and of itself, was a good movie, but paled in comparison to it's predecessors).  But if you look at it by itself, you'll find that it's a pretty fun story with really good animation.  Again, not up to par with the rest of the family, but still able to knock the socks off of a lot of other anime offerings out there.",1105056000,4,620,4.237288135593221
1197283,1,B000009DIU,"I had fond memories of Macross (the American TV version), so I thought I'd take a look at Macross II.  As my title suggests, the story and writing is ridiculously childish.  The characters are cardboard cutouts.  The censorship storyline is incredibly simpleminded.  The action, as I should have known from watching the Robotech TV series, is just a confusion of missiles and smashing metal.
Perhaps younger sci-fi fans would enjoy this movie.  If you're older you might want to check out something else.",1089244800,2,504,5.024096385542169
1197284,3,B000009DIU,"So this isn't best anime feature in the world. Okay maybe that is an understatement. The art is dated, the subbing is awkward, and all that other jazz. But you know what? That is the best thing about this movie! It is so damn bad it is freaking hilarious, heck the opening battle scenes had me rolling on the floor with the fact they were fighting amidst holograms of dancing pop singers! And what is up with the singing? The singing is the best part! Hell I am little [irritated that] the characters didn't whip out any dance moves during their selected scores...
Just try to keep a straight face when Hibiki is placed in jail and he gives his ""heartfelt"" speech about media censorship or whatever...
Even the closing dialogue will give you big chuckle. God, what a disastrously great movie.",1047168000,3,792,4.584507042253521
1197285,5,B000009DIU,"I rented this movie for vhs back in 98, and I watched it 5 times in the 3 days I had it.  I bought it a few weeks later, and watched that tape a couple of times.  Then I got it for dvd, and it still kicks [rear].  The picture and sound quality is excellent as well.  I like the dubbing, especially for the Marduk characters, but the humans sound better in the Japanese track. Anyway, the language track goes by preference from each person.  Anyway, this movie is great.  It has cool villians (Marduk and Zentran), cool mech battles, and great music.  The only donwside is that the subs for the characters that speak Zentran are hard subs fixed to fit the dub, so those subs won't be timed correctly with the Japanese tracks Zentran language.  It isn't that bad though.  Most people consider this in an alternate universe, but since it is 80 yrs later, meaning it takes place in 2092 (since that is when Space War I ended), I think it does belong in the regular universe.  Anyway, I highly recommend this movie, well OVA, especially if you love Macross.  Oh, and I prefer this one over Macross Plus.",1043798400,,1098,4.3861386138613865
1197286,4,B000009DIU,"Okay, everyone's opinions seem to be clashing on this particular anime, so I might as well put my two cents in. Do you dig anime/sci-fi with epic yet rediculous plotlines like stopping a war with songs of love? Do you like gundam/macross style space battles? Do you love the often stereotyped anime main characters? Do you wish more anime had soft edges on the characters instead of the sharp lines so often seen? Do you like cool backgrounds, japanese pop and (above all) long for an animated movie longer than an hour and twenty mintues? Look no further! If you are what I consider a true anime fan, you'll love this movie. It's got everything. Epic space battles, weird plot, cool backgrounds, japanese singing, sappy motivational speeches, and a really hot alien babe the story revolves around. Don't rent it, buy it!",1031356800,4,821,4.788732394366197
1197287,5,B000009DIU,"I've been a fan of the Macross universe since the beginning of time (for the Macross Universe anyway).  Recently I ran across this little gem of an anime that was bashed by almost every reviewer in professional sites.  The truth is, this title not only delivers excellent animation, but also quality entertainment for all ages.
The story opens with an ambitious reporter for the SNN uncovering alleged scandals drawing from his inspiration formed when he saw the war report from the first Zentraedi war.  In a series of events, Hibiki, the main character, runs across an alien girl, who at first is Hibiki's ""scoope"" but later becomes more.  As the story progressed, the movie uses the theme of love and music to begin tying up loose ends in the movie, and ultimately agrees with the proverb ""Love conquers all"".
This movie has many underlying social comments, including human rights(or Marduk rights), handling responsibilities, government censorship of the media.
All in all, this movie's animation quality is extremely well-done.  The characters definitely follow the style of the Macross series.  Transformations of mechas are done with extra detail.  Action sequences are done with impressive cinematography complete with crisp animation and timely perspective changes, as well as excellent camera work.
The English dubbing as well as the localisation of the script are not among the best in the anime genre, but they are nothing terrible either.  On top of all that, if you truly do not like dubbing, you could always turn on the subtitles and switch the audio to Japanese track.  There are awkward pauses every now and then, however.
This movie is extremely highly recommended, and unlike most other anime DVD releases, this one actually contains a respectful amount of extra goodies outside of the featured film and previews for other animes.
If you are a fan of the Macross universe, snatch this one up with extra greed in your eyes and drool in your mouth.  If you're not ... well, buy it anyway...  or I will tell the Marduk Emulators to sing the song of death as I unleash my Zentraedi warriors upon you...",1018137600,13,2118,4.954802259887006
1197288,4,B000009DIU,"This movie isn't really a ""movie"" in the traditional sense, its really a short OVA compiled onto once DVD (complete with commercial break animations).  It has generally decent animation (the most spectacular is definitely saved for last) albeit the odd frame rate drop here and there, which is survivable.  The designs are great, and as for the characters, some like them, some don't, so its really a matter of taste.  I personally enjoyed the main characters, they were different from the usual anime characters (eg: mysterious forgotten pasts, or recovering from flashbacks/memories etc etc), they had stronger personalities.  It does have a few arguably hokey moments (as in j-pop helping them win the battles near the beginning of the movie) but those are understandable.. and are redeemed by the other 95% of the movie.  As far as the english voice acting... if you don't like it.. the nice thing about DVD is that one can switch it to subtitled mode and watch it in the original japanese.
If you've only seen Macross Plus this movie will explain a lot of things for you.  Comparing the two.. I don't think this movie was of the same calibre as Macross Plus, but it was still very entertaining. As far as ""nobody likes this movie"" goes... all the friends I know who are into lots of anim and have seen this movie, enjoyed it.",1003795200,2,1330,4.735930735930736
1197289,5,B000009DIU,"I just saw Macross II: Lovers Again, and believe me, it was an excellent movie from start to finish. For those of you like me who have watched the classic Robotech series on either early morning television back in the 1980s, to a rebroadcast on the Sci-Fi channel in 1991 to Cartoon Network's airing of it, Robotech has been a classic series, and Macross II captures the spirit and essence that has made Robotech so popular. The characters, while somewhat blunt and re-used anime sterotypes, fit in well with the action - orientated universe of Macross. The music fares well with the story's simple but effective plot, nothing to the quality of Macross Plus, but decent in its own right. Yet the thing that shines about this film is the way it captured anime's classic look and feel in its beautiful renditions of space battles, gorgeous backgrounds on both land and space and creative and somewhat cute character design that is what anime is all about. I'm personally captured to this wonderful feeling, and Macross II has all of it, and (dare I say), does it better than Macross Plus. An overall excellent movie, don't miss this!",1003536000,3,1131,4.746192893401015
1197290,2,B000009DIU,"When I first saw this movie, it was my first introduction into the world of ""Macross"". It wasn't as good as it could've been. But after seeing more ""Macross"" titles like ""Macross Plus"" and ""Robotech"" and doing a little research on this film, I quickly realized how low it really was in the world of anime.
""Macross II: The Movie"" (also known as ""Macross II: Lovers Again"") is a classic example of how a franchise can be milked out for all of its worth. Many problems plagued this movie from the start, including the overall ""silliness"" of the film and the ""bluntness"" of the characters' features (face shapes, noses, etc.) that was at the time being replaced by more sharper features in anime. The movie was originally set several years after the last ""Macross"" series, but because of the lackluster appeal of this movie, it was eventually discarded as an alternate universe.
Although it does put out a decent effort on its part, ""Macross II"" somehow manages to contain a flaw in every aspect. The plot is quite original, although in the end it's one of the movie's main pitfalls. The characters, while not completely stereotypical, aren't well fleshed out and at times act like cardboard cutouts. This can be attributed to the less-than-bearable English voice acting, which often is flat, emotionless, and even laughable.
I will give the film credit for one thing, however. For the English release of the movie, the invaders use the movie's original Japanese track as their ""alien language,"" quite an original idea I have yet to see elsewhere. Even so, while I haven't seen ""Macross II"" in Japanese, the Japanese voice acting in the English version often at times sounds as flat as the English voice acting. The animation, while probably good enough for its time, is nothing special. Movements, particularly speaking, appear choppy and oftentimes unnatural.
Even the two major factors that define a ""Macross"" world - fighting and music - fall short. The fighting in ""Macross II"", while plentiful, makes the viewer feel he's watching uninspired vintage footage. And the singing, while done rather well, consists mostly of bubblegum pop that isn't anything to talk about.
All in all, ""Macross II"" made a decent effort yet couldn't live up to the standards of the rest of the ""Macross"" series. If watched on its own without any previous knowledge of the Macross universe, it might be seen in a better light. But with the name of ""Macross"" attached to its title, and with everything that defines a ""Macross"" series/movie falling short in this film, ""Macross II: Lovers Again"" isn't a good choice for serious anime fans.",1001894400,16,2616,4.90744920993228
1197291,4,B000009DIU,"I have to admitt that it doesn't really fit in as a sequal..
I for instance am a die hard macross(robotech) fan... so i bought this title before i bought the rest... (the rest couldn't be found in my country).
I thought it was quite cool and i enjoyed watching it..
it is quite good if you leave the rest of the macross serries out of it... so if you gonna watch this put all the others out of your mind an i can asure you that you will have a great time watching it..
so i say if you love the robotech serries this is a must have....",1000598400,,534,3.908256880733945
1197292,4,B000009DIU,"I personally love Macross 2. Yes I know, its not as good as Macross Plus. But Id rather watch this than Dragon Ball Z.
I don't know why so many people diss this movie and the OVAs. It is set in a alternate universe, so you can stop worrying about continuity problems. I say check this one out, perhaps rent it first.",998092800,,316,4.112903225806452
1197293,2,B000009DIU,"No, I haven't seen it and perhaps it would be quick to judge without my seeing it, but every Anime fan I know of who has seen it essentially said it was awful.  So awful that in fact all sequels based upon the Macross universe just pretended that the events in this movie never really happened (Just like Highlander II)
I'd spend my hard earned bucks on something else, like Macross Plus (now there's a good Macross movie)",993772800,,422,4.410256410256411
1197294,1,B000009DIU,"It's story is Okay, but so lifelessly acted that I actually fell asleep watching it.  I don't recommend buying it, but I do recomend reading the Manga...  it is much more interesting than listening and watching though half closed eyes...  this Anime Video contains some of the most uninspired voice talent I have ever heard (Dubbed and Subtitled versions) and the most lackluster animation of any Robotech or Macross series.  Again read the Manga, and skip the Anime.",992995200,5,467,4.948717948717949
1197295,2,B000009DIU,"Macross II is best described as a failure that almost wasn't.  The parts, in and of themselves, are fairly decent: we have some nice mecha designs, some great battles, a few romances running in parallel, interesting (if early 90s-ish) music.  But when it's put together, the end result is less than compelling.  In large part, this is due to the main character, Hibiki, a gossip-mongering tabloid reporter who stumbles onto the reality behind the most recent alien attack on Earth.  Not a sympathetic hero.  The next major flaw is the English dubbing--a few parts are actually quite good (the Marduk, the alien attackers, seem to have the best actors)--but Macross II was an early dub and it shows.  Hibiki is the worst of the lot, which only compounds the problem.  Finally, the DVD version presents new problems: the transfer is awful, with compression artifacts everywhere.  This is one of the worst DVDs in video quality that I've seen.
Macross II can be appreciated for some of its component parts--I bought it on DVD having already seen it because of the music and the mecha designs.  If you're new to anime in general or Macross in particular, I'd suggest starting with Macross Plus, which is the now-official sequel to Macross (the events in Macross II didn't happen in the universe of Macross Plus).  Macross II isn't awful, but it has significant flaws which make it hard to justify as a purchase for a casual fan.",991440000,4,1424,4.799180327868853
1197296,1,B000009DIU,this is the WORST of the macross world. it's boring and the animation is not all that great. skip this one and go to macross plus.,981763200,3,130,4.038461538461538
1197297,5,B000009DIU,"There are many who say Macross II is not a good sequel. I beg to differ.
Of all the Macross sequels, I find that this retains the original Macross formula, but adds a twist to it which really does set it apart from the original. This time idols are in the military, the main character is far from being a hero and the hero is actually a heroine. Most importantly, the action was linked to the music, and this is where the main female character comes in,
As for the love story, it is hard to actually say if there is one, and if there was, it seemed to take a back seat to other elemetns fo the story. However there were elements of love in the story, such as trust and devotion, but affection is not evident for most part of the movie, and you would be surpirised to find out who actually loves who.
The art in the movies is typical 90's art. The animators make use of bold and bright colours. The colouring is a lot more uniform than older anime, to the point where art seems a bit 'sterile'. one thing which I disliked was the way the clothes were presented. The artists seem to have this fascination with oversized wrinkly clothing. The animation, was good for the most part, but not as impressive as the original.
The extra DVD features are a bit scant.  The only extra I was happy to see was the ending animation of episodes 1-5 without the credits.  I was disspointed that the very first oppening with sound effects was not fetured on the disc.  The DVD itself is zoned for areas 1, 2 and 4, BUT it is in the NTSC format so buyers still need to have a TV capable of NTSC playback to watch (or else it is in black and white).
I would say I enjoyed this movie/series more than any other Macross sequel mainly because it is faithful to the original. Any loyal Macross follower would look more behind the action to realise this.",981072000,2,1830,4.252873563218391
1197298,1,B000009DIU,"Unless you are a huge Macross fan, avoid this one.  My son, who up until this viewing had never met an anime' he didn't like, walked out about halfway through this one.  I *forced* myself to watch it.  The animation is sub-par, the plot is incoherent and the voice acting (English-dubbed version) is a pain to the ears. You will read here the 5 star ""allegience"" ratings given by the Macross purists, but save your money and get Macross Plus. Like any form of art, anime' has it's low end.

It even shows the effects of Zentraedi/Human culture and genetic mixing. The only flaw I can point  out is that it does not follow the Macross storyline with advanced  colonization (as M Plus and M7 does), still a great movie as a atand-alone;  even if it's not part of the official Macross story. Very fitting of the  legacy!",956534400,5,447,4.481481481481482
1197303,2,B000009DIU,"A friend had let me borrow this movie and I was glad I saw the movie before buying it. The animation quality is inconsistent and not the greatest in many places for one thing. Then of course was the dubbing that  was so bad I was laughing and rewinding scenes just to imitate the attempt  at being serious with my friends. My favorite instance of this was Hibiki's  strange monotone speaking co pilot with a hangover that died on a mission.  I was actually delighted he was dead cause his voice was so annoying. I  have seen plots much worse than this even though this plot couldve been  better and I did like a few scenes that actually made me smile. Sadly  though after Hibiki's close bond and relationship with Ishtar in the movie,  suddenly Hibiki turns around and kisses Silvie?  Silvie was a brat to both  characters throughout the whole movie and then Ishtar just gets sent away  in the end. Really dumb. Picture Top Gun with Tom Cruise, where Tom Cruise  suddenly turns and goes out with Meg Ryan (His dead co pilots girlfriend)  in the end instead of his flight instructor. Thats how strange this ending  was to me, giving the whole movie a slightly pointless feeling. As an anime  fan, I recommend to still see it just for a comparison to other movies.",955756800,,1262,4.497797356828194
