Some years ago my knee began to hurt, and I knew that I had to do something drastic with my health, so I began cycling indoors. Man, that was boring!! Every minute felt like a year and I knew I had to find something to rest my eyes on while cycling, so I went online and came across the CVO. I tried one video and I was hooked after that.

The Hearth Health is a video that is super for both beginners and advanced cyclists. It is an interesting workout with a nice view and drills every 5 minutes. It begins easy and then gets harder and harder towards the end of the ride. Paul, the narrator, is talking about ""why do I/we hate cycling"", and it is very interesting and fun listening to him. He is a wise man and knows a lot about cycling. It is like having your own personal trainer and he pushes you all the way to the finish line.

It is cool to see Paul cycling along in another small screen, and it is nice to see how he is doing the stretching out at the end of the workout. Time flies when you listen to Paul's stories and instructions, you get both sore and tired, but it is fun doing it anyway.

The Heart Health video is almost 1,5 hours long and it is divided into 30 minutes workouts. The first two with drills every 5 minutes and where you can read and follow what what to do on the screen. The last part is harder and about 12 minutes long and have another infopanel on the screen.

You can choose what you want to listen to during the ride. Only music, Paul talking with music in the background, your own music or you can shut everything off and just enjoy a quiet workout. It is all up to you.

I have been riding this video several times and I love it. If you want a workout that is both fun, interesting and challenging, this is the ride for you :)",1517702400,,1928,4.063157894736842
8662672,5,B00KYL7Y7W,"This is a great ride for those who are new to cycling, or for someone needing a recovery ride.  Our host Paul Gallas takes us on a tour of scenic Islands of British Columbia, starting in Nanaimo, on to Crofton Ferry Terminal, across the ferry to Salt Springs Island.

I do not belong to a riding club and usually ride alone, so Pauls comments are very helpful to me.  Its like riding with a personal coach.

In this video he covered some questions that I always wondered but have never had the opportunity to ask.  For example, he discusses various equipment like heart rate monitors, power meters, and clipless pedals.  He also talks about why cycling outfits are so stupid looking but necessary, and how to stretch on a bike.  There is also a helpful discussion of how the body burns fat at lower heart rates, and burns sugar with more intensity.

The first 75 minutes are a recovery ride, but the intensity picks up the last 10 minutes on Salt Springs Island.  During the first part he demonstrates drills to help our technique for real world cycling.  He also covers some of the basics of riding.  If you want just the background music or the sounds from the ride, there are alternate audio tracks to choose from.

Once we get across the ferry we see the full dashboard which tells us things like perceived resistance, % of max heart rate, cadence, etc.  It seems like Part 2 (not included in this video) will pick up from where this ride leaves off, and has a lot of anaerobic workouts.

I like Pauls videos, and recommend getting some from each category (endurance, intervals, anaerobic, heart health, etc).  This is a great one for a low intensity recovery ride, and has helpful tips.",1509494400,,1691,4.571428571428571

The video features an interesting and enjoyable narrative discussing various aspects of the sport of cycling from a beginners perspective: what equipment youll need, how to ride safely in traffic, how to get on and off the bike, etc.  Even though I was familiar with most of the material, it was still fun to listen to and I did learn a few things.

The video is the usual high quality, with footage recorded while riding through the countryside of British Columbia carefully smoothed to remove the bumps and shaking of the bike, with the occasional piece of footage taken from a vehicle driving past so you can see the rider (Paul) and his bike while out on the ride.

The main highlight of this video is the series of drills or cycling-specific exercises that Paul guides you through.  I had heard of cycling drills before, but wasn't sure how to do them. Paul gives you excellent commentary and guides you through the drills step by step.  There are high-cadence intervals, riding with only one leg at a time to make sure you are pedaling in circles, increasing the resistance of your trainer to build leg strength, and then standing up in first gear to help build good climbing technique.  These drills will help make you a better cycling by improving your pedaling technique and developing the muscles you need to be able to pedal faster and smoother.

For most of the video, your heart rate stays quite low, making this a great choice to use for a recovery ride.  The video is broken into roughly three half-hour sessions.  Combining cycling drills with a low-intensity workout makes for a great training video to use when recovering from higher-intensity rides, and you can choose whether to just do one half-hour session, or combine two or three sessions together for a longer recovery ride.

You don't need any special equipment to follow this video, apart from a bicycle and a trainer -- while a Garmin with a cadence sensor and heart rate monitor is an advantage, its not required.  A spinning circle shows you how fast to pedal if you haven't got a cadence sensor, and simple indicators tell you which gear you should be using and what you need to be doing at each stage of the video.

The last section of the video is slightly different to the others.  After a final set of drills, Paul guides you through a series of stretches while still on the bike, and then the video finishes with a ten-minute section of higher-intensity riding, where you have to match the gear changes as we mimic the ride shown on the video.  When the ride goes uphill or were accelerating, we are told to change to a harder gear so that we feel what its like to do the ride.

This is the pattern used in most of the Cycling Videos Online videos, and we are also shown the on-screen dashboard with heart rate, elevation, and power graphs.  This final section is somewhat harder than the previous sections, and I got a good sweat up, though its not too intense and still qualifies as a recovery ride -- especially as youll be well warmed up by this stage.  Its also a wonderful introduction to the other videos in the Cycling Videos Online series.

I had only one minor complaint about this video, and that was that Paul didn't allow enough time to change up to the highest gear before starting the high-resistance pedaling drill.  I found I missed the first few seconds of the drill as I was still changing gears and then getting my pedaling up to the required speed.  A few extra seconds before the start of the drill would have been helpful.

This is a fairly minor complaint, though, and probably an indication that Im too slow in changing gears.  Overall, this is a wonderful training tool, and a great introduction to cycle training videos.

Even though Ive been cycling for most of my life, I still found the drills very helpful, and Ill be using this video as a regular recovery ride on days when weather or time prevent me from getting out onto the road.  This is an excellent video for any cyclist who is just starting out with indoor training, as well as any cyclist who is not familiar with cycling drills -- they really will make you a more efficient cyclist by improving your pedaling technique.  Highly recommended.",1508716800,,4702,4.973180076628353

Then, I realized my mistake:  I've reviewed a number of Paul's excellent videos, including many that really ratchet up the effort.  Those assume a basic understanding of cycling as well as the use of these videos.  This one is different.

This one is an excellent starting point for both cycling and the use of these cycling videos.  Paul goes through many basics, from gear to the biomechanics of riding.  Assuming little knowledge on the user's part, he methodically explains these matters in a friendly, non-condescending way.  He takes us on a nice ride through BC, starting during rather overcast, even dreary, conditions.  Pacific Northwest, you see.  However, as the clouds part (somewhat), the instruction takes over to carry us through the ride successfully.

That ride incorporates a number of drills, designed to improve technique and conditioning.  Thus, introducing us to the importance of proper cadence, he launches into a variety of drills, such as single-leg pedaling and the like.  (Even incorporates a stretching routine, while on the trainer bike.)  Whereas this may be old hat for some, it may come as a revelation to less experienced riders.  Representing the fundamentals of effective cycling, these skills prove useful for doing harder, more challenging rides.

Finally, with about 10 minutes remaining, we board a ferry, heading to the mainland.  There, he introduces the dash, a graphic that contains the various metrics used in all these videos.  In all, the instructional value is high, as we pedal away indoors, perhaps training in winter gloom as we prepare for fair-weather centuries.  Good luck!",1508716800,,2043,6.15547703180212
