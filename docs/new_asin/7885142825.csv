7900481,3,7885142825,"A 2011 Hong Kong film ""Choy Lee Fut"" (""Cai Li Fo"") stars Sammy Hung (Sammo Hung's real-life son) as Chen Ying-Jie, a young martial artist who has just returned from UK to Hong Kong, with his Japanese friend Ken Takeda (Kane Kosugi, son of Sho Kosugi, star of the 1980s ninja flicks), only to find that his family's gym is about to be sold to a big company. To stop this, he proposes a martial arts tournament by fighters chosen by each party.

Besides its silly story, there is one thing you have to keep in mind before watching ""Choy Lee Fut."" Two big names Sammo Hung (as our hero's father) and Yuen Wah appear only as cameo and their martial arts scene is brief. Dennis To also appears as a master of Cai Li Fo (or Choy Li Fut), one of the Chinese martial arts systems, but only in a brief flashback.

Set in modern times, the film spends considerable screen time on the romantic comedy-like subplot about the protagonist falling in love with the big company's charming and efficient executive played by Wang Jia Yin. They are likable, but for most viewers romance is not what they are looking for. Those who are looking for ""Ip Man""-like intense martial arts action may be disappointed with the film's light-hearted tone.

What matters is action, and martial arts stunt of ""Choy Lee Fut"" is just adequate, nothing outstanding. Sammy Hung and Kane Kosugi show some pretty impressive skills, but not good enough to distinguish themselves from stunts in other better martial arts films. Obviously the two leads are talented martial artists, but they still need something new or original. Perhaps this is because of the choreography that looks to me a bit old-fashioned.

""Choy Lee Fut"" is barely passable entertainment. Considering the talents involved, you may call it a disappointment.",1336867200,,1788,4.758064516129032
7900482,2,7885142825,"The directors wasted the talent of Sammo Hung, who only shows up at the beginning and end and barely does anything.  You don't even see much Choy Lay Fut from any character.  The main character Jie Chen (Sammy Hung) and his Japanese friend try and defend their authentic Choy Lee Fut school from being acquired by evil worldwide martial arts school ""Panamerican,"" with its tattooed, aggressive American kickboxers.  On one level, the movie mocks MMA and its commercialism, while uplifting traditional Chinese martial arts.  However, this message becomes convoluted as Jie pursues a sappy romance with a woman who works for Panamerican, and is directly involved in undercutting his school.  One wonders where his true devotion lies.  And after all the negative portrayal of western influence in martial arts, the movie pulls a 180 out with hip-hop lion dances, scenes that play like music videos, and a ""Choy Lee Fut"" rap.",1313020800,,921,5.066225165562914
7900483,4,7885142825,"This isn't the best Sammo Hung movie ever made, but its a good film given the limited budget and the first collaboration between Sammo and his son, Sammy. The movie also stars Sammy's real-life best friend, Kane Kosugi who you may remember from DOA: DEAD OR ALIVE, GODZILLA: FINAL WARS; and MUSCLE HEAT. CHOY LEE FUT is an ancient and famous martial arts. I was hoping this film would delve into more detail about the art, but it only touches on it. As a Wing Chun practitioner, the fight scenes are good, and realistic. There were no special effects or wires involved. They aren't as spectacular as IP MAN, but then again, IP MAN did use more camera tricks and wires to complete the fight sequences.",1310428800,,700,4.563492063492063
