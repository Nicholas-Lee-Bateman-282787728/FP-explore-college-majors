6161685,5,B00HFC7LYO,More information is revealed about the guild and its history and some of the characters.  I thought it was a bit more intense than the previous ones.  Still contains humor.  Story line is building a lot.,1397952000,3,203,4.583333333333333
6161686,5,B00HFC7LYO,I enjoyed this show. It is one of my favorite animes. I own them all so far and am looking forward to the next set coming out in May.,1397692800,2,133,3.6206896551724137
6161687,5,B00HFC7LYO,"Show continues with the drama, the laughs, the intense fight scenes, and all the characters you have come to love.",1395705600,,114,4.75
6161688,5,B00HFC7LYO,"Fairy Tail Part 9 is the beginning of a 2 Part arc known as the ""Tenrou Island"" arc. Part 9 starts as most arcs do: with everyone lounging about at the guild hall. Later though, Makarov makes an appearance to the guild with an announcement: the Fairy Tail 'S-Class' promotional trials are due to begin soon. In these trials, several of the toughest members of the guild are picked- only the one who passes the trial will be promoted to an S class wizard, and be allowed to take tougher job requests. All members selected for the trial are also allowed to bring one partner along with them to aid them in the struggle.

With all members and partners set, Makarov and the current S-Class wizards take a ship to Fairy Tail's sacred ground: Tenrou Island. Once arrived, each team enters a seperate tunnel on the island. Each tunnel as a difficult challange. Those include: Fighting Erza, Mirajane, Gildarts, (ouch) or face a different challange such as a mental challange.

After the 1st challange is completed, the remaining contests are given their second assignment: find Fairy Tail's 1st Master's grave. Whilst looking for Mavis's grave however, one group is interrupted: two wizards from the most powerful dark guild in the world: Grimoire Heart, have landed to scout the island.

With the imenent landing of the full forces of Grimoire Heart, including the all-powerful ""Seven Kins of Purgatory"", Fairy Tail puts the trial on hold to try and repel the overwhelming attack. With defeat nearly certain from the start, Fairy Tail needs to give all it has to defeat this threat to their sacred ground, and stop Grimoire Heart from obtaining its ultimate goal of capturing a certain LEGENDARY black wizard. Not all members will emerge victorious, let alone alive from this battle.

On a personal note, this is the most action pact arc. There is more fighting in this arc than any other yet. Amazing fights go on, including my favorite fight in this part: Fire Dragon vs Flame God (episode 105). There are over 10 new intense soundtracks that are played for those of you who love Fairy Tail music (who dosn't?), and what suprised me was (small spoiler here) not all fights ended with Fairy Tail winning. In fact, MOST of them were a draw, (spolier again) or Fairy Tail lost! I think there were only 3 Fairy Tail victories in the Part 9, simply because the Seven Kins of Purgatory are SO POWERFUL.

In summary, This part has LOADS of fighting, the fights are- as always, 100% intriguing and fun, and there is also some backstory material in this as you get to see why all of the wizards want S class so much. As usualy this is a 5/5 Fairy Tail that MUST be bought by anyone remotely interested.
