4513348,5,B00506UL4E,I haven't watch a dog of flanders yet but I will. I love sounder and this heartwarming tale of a family who trying to make through the depressing time. I bought the set at walmart for 3bucks. A steal. It's worth it.,1376352000,2,215,4.142857142857143

4513350,5,B00506UL4E,"I don't care how old your kids are, these two are worth watching. Sounder is a classic and both movies are not only very entertaining but inlike most of todays movies they teach us what integrity, loyalty and functional versus dysfunctional lives look like. These are worth buying and not just renting!",1359504000,11,302,4.826923076923077
4513351,5,B00506UL4E,"While it does not say so anywhere on the back of the case, and this contradicts Amazon's description, the double feature disk of Sounder and A Dog Of Flanders are both widescreen releases. They are not anamorphic so you have to zoom your screen to fill it up unless you have an old tube, but I don't find that to be a big problem. It's double-sided, one disk. FYI for anyone who has wondered.",1354752000,10,392,4.3108108108108105

8450788,5,B00506UL4E,"A Double Feature:  ""Sounder"" and ""A Dog of Flanders"".  Two movies produced by Robert B. Ratnits, well known for making movies the whole family will enjoy.  Two movies in which the title role goes to the featured dogs.  Two dogs, both trained by Frank T. Weatherwax.  You may recognize the flop eared dog in ""A Dog of Flanders"" from his former title role in Disney's ""Old Yeller"".",1514246400,,379,4.597014925373134
