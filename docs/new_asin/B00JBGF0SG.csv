6353987,1,B00JBGF0SG,decent storydreadful copy. I expected better from Warner Bros.colour keeps changing which is very distracting.,1421020800,6,110,6.4
6353988,3,B00JBGF0SG,"The picture quality on this Warner Archive movie is terrible. The image is soft and the color shifts all over the place. Lots of red in the dissolves. Goes from dark to light whenever it feels like it. This needs restoration in the worst way. I've seen bootlegs that look better than this. The movie is all right but come on fellas, if you're gonna dish this sub-quality out then do it at the price it's worth--$3.00.",1420934400,7,417,4.428571428571429
