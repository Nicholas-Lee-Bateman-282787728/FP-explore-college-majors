This DVD is advanced and requires from you the dedication to Practice!  If your like me, an amateur with a pole in your home, this DVD is the challenge you've been waiting for!  Fastest way to get six pack abs, guaranteed!",1150156800,,361,4.4393939393939394
8324090,1,B000CCFLAK,"Don't buy this DVD ! I was expecting to see her dance, but she doesn't. In the introduction, I counted it with my watch (I promise) she doesn't even dance for 30 seconds !!  Next, Tammy and Kelly, okey, they are very flexible and good dancers but only teach you a couple of moves. In summary, the 75% of the DVD is all about FIRE, the safety instructions and bla bla, and everytime repeting the same images about a woman dancing with fire. The 25% is separted into 10% Tammy , 10% Kelly , 4,5% contortions and an insignificant 0,5% Fawnia! I totally threw my money into the garbage. I don't suggest buying this DVD! I am new in Amazon and I didn't take seriously the reviews of the people but from now on I will be more cautious.",1147996800,3,729,4.244604316546763
