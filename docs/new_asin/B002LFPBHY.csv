8372853,5,B002LFPBHY,"Excellent service and video! Received in a timely manner and in new condition like it said. I love Zac Efron, so I was excited to see there was a video about his life.  He's so CUTE!",1326412800,2,182,4.055555555555555
8372854,5,B002LFPBHY,Great informative video about Zac Efron. From his small beginnings to where he is now. This would be a wonderful video for any Zac fan.,1321142400,,135,4.44
8372855,3,B002LFPBHY,"This is an interesting little documentary that I stumbled upon by accident. Its only an hour long, and it doesn't really give you any information that you wouldn't already know (or want to know) about Zac. Worth a rent, but maybe not a buy.",1264291200,4,240,4.4772727272727275
