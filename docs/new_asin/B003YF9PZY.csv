4228735,3,B003YF9PZY,"While recovering from a tragic accident on the road, Max Matheson (Nick Stahl, ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"") is hired as a night security guard at a New Orleans department store. As Max works there, however, some of the company's employees die in the most horrific way - all in front of the mirrors. And only Max, it seems, has a special ability that might help him understand what is really going on.

The basic idea is almost the same as the 2008 ""Mirrors"" directed by Alexandre Aja, the difference being the filmmakers' attempt to explain the origin of the supernatural powers behind the strange deaths. They shouldn't have. The film opens fairly well with gruesome deaths (thanks to the good, if not great, effects), but in the second half ""Mirrors 2"" tires to do something different - I won't tell you the details - with lengthy expository flashbacks that are not very thrilling to watch. The police detectives are involved only to slow down the actions.

Emmanuelle Vaugier appears as Elizabeth Reigns, a key person in the latter half of the film. William Katt plays Jack, Max's concerned father. Unfortunately they have little to do in the story.

Not exactly a bad film, I admit, ""The Mirrors 2"" is still not very good. The deaths are certainly grotesque, but the rest of the film is just about waiting for them to happen, and watching the storyline unfold that is too neat and unoriginal.",1293926400,,1405,4.726530612244898
4228736,4,B003YF9PZY,"Well, considering that I'm normally not a fan of sequels (doesn't stop me from watching them), this movie actually was quite good. First of all, if you enjoyed the first movie especially the kill scenes then this movie should not disappoint. In terms of the gore and disgust factor with how people are killed this movie keeps in line with the bar set by the first film. There are quite a few very creative kill scenes that given a straight-to-dvd budget were very nicely done.

In terms of where I think this film falls a bit short is in the story (which seems a bit dry at times...) and character developments (maybe it's just me but I didn't sense a real connection between characters nor did the movie ever help me build a relationship with one of the characters that I could sympathize with...)

Even so, I would definitely recommend this movie to fans of the first film. This film brings back all the great gory kill scenes and suspense while trying to branch out and make some creative changes to the mirrors story (how one gets trapped in the mirror). Don't watch this movie expecting the level of the first movie, the first movie had very likable characters, thrills and chills, and a fit-the-pieces together plot that kept us guessing, but go into this movie with a very open mind considering that it is a sequel with a low budget then I think it will pleasantly surprise you....",1292976000,3,1388,4.570281124497992
4228737,3,B003YF9PZY,"I found this movie very gory. And it had some great scary scenes. I don't know why,but i still needed KEITH SOUTHERLAND to make me really feel this picture. The new night security guards,i just did not feel like keith delivered in MIRRORS 1. I still think it's a must watch movie. AND A GREAT HOLIDAY GIFT!",1290211200,,306,4.385964912280702
4228738,3,B003YF9PZY,Reasonably well done horror/thriller type movie. If you are poking through horror movies looking for something with good production values and a decent script then this is a good choice.,1289952000,4,186,5.233333333333333
4228739,4,B003YF9PZY,"Mirrors two hardly delivers anything new, but my expectations were so low that I actually came away pleased with the outcome. While it is a Part 2, the movie stands on its own, though security guards seem to be tragic fodder for mirrors. In this case, it's a grieving fella whose father (the Greatest American Hero himself) is opening a department store in New Orleans and is in need of his son's services to keep it secure (really, there is little more explained about their relationship). His presence in the store is pivotal since he is the only one able to interpret the presence in the mirrors, and he helps introduce us to potential vicitims. Since no one watches this for character development, there are a number of gruesome scenes, and an unexpected amounty of creepiness that keeps the pace of the film moving along quite nicely. And whereas the first movie tried to hard to do too much, the story here is fairly straightforward and convincing, considering the storyline. Again, nothing groundbreaking, but a more than worthwhile direct to video effort that has more going for it than some bigger budgeted national releases (read: My Soul to Take). Highly recommend for the horror fan.",1287619200,5,1195,4.8341463414634145
4228740,5,B003YF9PZY,"Admittedly I had low expectations for this straight to home release film, but after watching all of the features, both films and reviewing everything they offered here, it makes for probably the lowest quality film that I have given 5-stars as a rating (meaning purchase worthy).

The story follows another night watchmen (Nick Stahl this time) having personal demon issues with himself and the mirrors in his workplace. They made the supporting cast fill some average roles, but they went way upscale on the eye candy with Christy Romano and Emmanuelle Vaughier. And yes, I have had a few customers already ask right away if the Internet rumors are true about Romano and her shower scenes - definitely (I doubt any Kim Possible fans are renting this anyway). The majority of the film relies on suspense and weak character stuff, and the actual mirror scenes number less than ten. But what makes this product go from a 3-star event are the supplements and BD quality.

* Making of, 9:39 minutes. Standard interview fare with film clips, decent material if you liked the film.
* Deleted scenes, 2:09 minutes. Two scenes thankfully deleted, skip them.
* VFX behind the scenes, 12:33. A definite watch for the VFX fans out there both of the film and in general. Covered every single shot in the film that required both heavy post-production and make-up/props.
* Bonusview: When selected a 35% sized PiP fills the screen as the point-of-view of the mirror ghosts. Essentially they reversed the actual film footage and added some corny stuff - for the few times it comes up in the film I was wasting my time on fast forward. - not worth it as it muddles the sound also.
* DVD, disc 2. Contains the original Korean Film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Into-the-Mirror/dp/B000NW4RQS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Into the Mirror</a>&nbsp;and this film with same special features (sans the PiP option).

The picture quality is outstanding, both in the day and night shots. Clarity was solid, even to the point of showing the production weaknesses. One mirror shot in particular on a tracking cam with mirror cracks moving multi-dimensionally looked great. The DTS was decent, with several of the effects scenes filling all of the channels.

Overall, a slow moving film with one or two bad effects, but mostly a nice test for clarity and seeing another film getting made in the New Orleans/Baton Rouge area. That, and the inclusion of extras gives this a full rating. Unrated but saw nothing to give it above a standard R, region coded A.",1287446400,5,2569,5.066193853427896
4228741,3,B003YF9PZY,"OK, let's get this straight from the start - this is not only a stand-alone film from the Hollywood original, featuring a smaller, more contained B-movie cast, but it's actual premise defies even the most abstract of racing imaginations!

And, let's face it, the original didn't exactly light Hollywood up either, the best part of that movie being its main character's last minute of horrific self-realization. Anyway, in this low-budget sequel (Producer - ""There's less effects, but they're more effective""!), our hero Max (Nick Stahl - 'Terminator 3'), a man already recovering from a traumatic car accident, takes a job as a night security guard at his father's new Mayflower Department Store - now relocated in New Orleans.

Complete with the huge horror mirror from the first movie, once another night guard is bloodied up whilst looking into it, Max himself begins to see visions of a young mysterious woman in the store's mirror. Not quite knowing what is going on, he seeks therapy, swallows pills, but nothing seems to rid him of the nightly visions.

Directed by Spanish filmmaker Victor Garcia ('Return to House on Haunted Hill'), a man who can barely speak English himself, 'Mirrors 2' does have things going for it. It has some very inventive deaths, some really well-created, and usually bloody horror moments, and the always stunning, Emmanuelle Vaugier ('Two & A Half Men'). It was also filmed in a brand new, state of the art New Orleans museum, and the underground tunnel scenes were all filmed on location too!

Personally, I think the grisly slaughters make the movie, but the shower one (as a red-blooded male) is the cherry on the cake re: Christy Carlson Romano (voice of 'Kim Possible') ... because, she has the thinnest legs I have ever seen placed on a tight mid-section, with some big-ass fake boobs atop for good (counter) measure!

Anyway, back on track and coming full circle, the one thing I didn't get is the reason for the horrific car crash at the beginning. I mean, Max is driving in blinding, pouring rain, car lights shining constantly in his face, the wind howling around outside, and the asks his girl next to him to remove her seat belt, crawl over/past him into the back seat, to simply dip into his bag and remove a ring - to propose to her with there and then!! Come on, filmmakers, a) that's hardly a romantic moment for such an occasion, and b) seriously, in all that rain and bad visibility?!

The middle of the movie staves off from any horror, trying to tie up all the plot points for you, to allow you the chance to guess exactly what did happen that one night back two months ago - and, more importantly, which of the characters is the main killing culprit! And that's where it succeeds, although the film does feel like it's going in slow motion for some 30 minutes!

Come the ending, the final ending, yup, it's clearly guessable (both times!), but by then, and as long as you can suspend even Hollywood belief for the movie's duration, you've had a fun ride.

To help him recover over the tragedy, his father makes him the security guard of the new Mayflower Department Store to take over the night shift for the last security guard who had an accident and quit. During his shift he sees the corpse of something in a mirror. Could this be a part of his imagination? And if not, what does it want? -summary

For some strange reason, the powers that be thought it would be a good idea to add a sequel to a crappy movie with another crappy movie. To my surprise, Mirrors 2 isn't quite as crappy as the first Mirrors but it's stinking pretty bad. I just hope this isn't a sign of many more sequels to follow, because the horror genre really doesn't need another lousy long running gimmick out there.

Any well seasoned vet of film will quickly notice that director Victor Garcia is a cherry film maker. I mean, the guy has absolutely no imagination whatsoever, and this by the numbers script is proof. The first half of the movie is standard horror fare with a very near non existent plot, that plods along from one death scene to the next. The movie becomes boring very quickly and completely lacks the slightest amount of thought. The premise behind a murdering entity existing in another dimension through the mirrors is still a very interesting concept. Unfortunately like its predecessor, it's only used as a gimmick to raise the body count. To say that Mirrors 2 is lame as hell is an understatement. The second half begins to make sense of all the carnage with an all too predictable seen that before story. To those out there who need originality in their horror films, it would be wise to stay very far away from this turkey because you will cringe from beginning to end.

The plot follows Max as he tries to learn what this apparition wants, who happens to be very violent in dealing with its prey. Garcia even fumbles with the surprises in the death scenes, by providing Max with precognitive visions of the victims deaths. So much for suspense huh? Yeah, go ahead and show us that someone is going to lose their f*' head 5 minutes before it happens. Take all the fun out of the brutal death, we don't mind one bit.

I really didn't enjoy this movie at all, in fact, I wanted to stop watching it when the meaningless token nude scene was tossed in with the very predictable death. However, as usual, I will give credit and admit that Garcia gave certain story elements far more thought than what Alexandre Aja did. He makes sense on why Max was chosen by the entity to carry out its work, which was something left unclear in the first movie.

The death scenes have some disturbing, maybe even some squeamish moments; such as some graphic slicing and a decapitation. Gore hounds may find something worth their time here. The acting on the other hand has several stale moments, and Nick Stahl appeared to literally sleep walk through the whole damn movie. He was way too boring as a lead for me, and I really didn't care for him at all.

Mirrors 2 is a tad bit better than the first one, but that's not saying anything at all, since I find them both to be near equally worthless. If I could do it all over again I would rather go to sleep than sit through these. Victor Garcia pretty much proved to me that just about anyone can make a horror movie, because all you need is a gimmick to help push the paper thin from point A to B. Unless you're a fan of the first one or a serious horror buff, I recommend skipping this.

4228770,4,B003YF9PZY,"This sequel to ""Mirrors"" is a disappointment and narrowly escapes the pitfall of relying too heavily on the gimmickry of devising a string of increasingly gruesome ways to be done in by the powers of darkness; which was sadly apparent in the entire ""Omen"" trilogy.

Nick Stahl provides a well rounded performance as always but seems curiously absent from what one would assume to be a pivotal role in this film; in fact he's practically sidelined to a more supporting role of only minor consequence to the unfolding of the story.

The writers could have provided us with a far more plausible excuse to introduce one of the store's original mirrors such as a mirror that was part of a signature installation or architectural element that was iconic to the original NY store on 5th Ave.
Instead, they put a large plain mirror on a base and give us some nonsense about how famous their mirrors were and how well they were made or some such thing; sorry, this a not from the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, it's just a plain 'ole freakin mirror.

In a very loose and easy manner, they manage to make the film entertaining enough to keep you engaged but it sadly lacks the gut gripping atmospheric intensity, depth and dimension of the original story with Keifer Sutherland.

The storefront was rather strange, resembling the entrance to a museum rather than an upscale ""boutique"".
Now which is it, is the new Mayflower suppose to be a small intimate ""boutique"" or an upscale dept. store; there IS a difference; unfortunately the mirror, perhaps offended by certain acerbic remarks about ""ample"" size women, made the store Buyer it's first victim.",1437264000,,1641,4.787985865724382

4228827,5,B003YF9PZY,"The bluray has excellent video and audio and is sold at a great price. I thought the movie itself was excellent and the cast was dead on. I still can't get over the performance of Christy Romano. I never saw it coming.....The plot is predictable but they do a great job of keeping you entertained.

Great movie, great price.",1323561600,2,324,4.491525423728813
4228828,3,B003YF9PZY,"This definitely isn't a great movie.  It's not gonna win any awards, or stick in your  mind days after watching it, but compared to part one, it's fantastic!  I enjoy the idea of ghosts seeking revenge through mirrors and even peoples own reflections: pretty cool.  And some of the death scenes were enjoyable, like seeing the girl from the Even Stevens Disney show (naked and with breast implants, ewwww!) getting chopped up by the shower.  However, as I've said in other reviews: I absolutely hate rape being used in horror movies in an attempt to be dark and edgy.  Luckily, it's only a few seconds long and towards the end...but I really could have done without that.  And Nick Stahl looks quite sickly in this movie.  But, besides that, not too shabby.  So, to sum it all up: you're not missing out on anything by skipping this, but if you're bored, go ahead and watch it - whatever.",1323129600,3,888,4.569620253164557

4228830,2,B003YF9PZY,"I watched the prequel to this last week and rather enjoyed it. But like most sequels, the plot, acting and writing took a downturn. It really only amped up the bloody scenes but were a tad gratuitous for my taste. I'm all for gore, but they were too obvious in the attempts at shocking the audience. The plot was completely unoriginal and predictable. The editing made for it being a little choppy and didn't flow well. The writing lost some consistency when the lead (Nick Stahl) asked the same question multiple times when it had been answered already. It was amusing enough I suppose, but I would have rather not spent money on it. Save your $$ and watch the original with Kiefer Sutherland instead. It had a lot more creepy scenes, was better acted and had some unexpected plot twists.",1308960000,,789,4.602836879432624
4228831,4,B003YF9PZY,"The special effects and makeup in Mirrors 2 were great..The story was very cut and dry and one we have seen many times before.
Find the victims killer or killers then  they can rest in peace until then they will make a bloody mess of anyone involved. The gore was really good and very well done,the shower scene alone was worth the watch.
I love Nick Stahl ,he was convincing in this role given it wasn't the most concrete.
The story was simple but that's ok ,sometimes you don't want to think just watch.
Moral of the story ,never slip a potential Ghost a rufie.
I give it 2 thumbs up.",1303430400,4,586,4.2792792792792795
4228832,1,B003YF9PZY,"""Mirrors"" was a creative, atmospheric movie about demons and contained quality acting, suspenseful moments throughout and superb special effects.  ""Mirrors 2"" was a major disappointment on all levels.  The acting was lame and the story was overly predictable with no surprises or shocking moments.  The movie could have been part of Night Gallery's ""Sixth Sense"" series--more of a esp-crime show than horror movie.  I'm glad I checked it out from Red Box for a dollar.  Even at that price I feel I was ripped off. If you liked ""Mirrors"", save your money and avoid ""Mirrors 2"".",1298246400,,576,4.958333333333333
4228833,3,B003YF9PZY,"I'm feeling extremely generous this morning.
I'll give the movie three stars because of Nick Stahl.
I really liked him in T3 and it's kind of sad to see him wasting his time on movies like this.

Ok......the good.
I sort of enjoyed the first Mirrors.
So I was curious what they would do with this one.
Well...the FX are decent.
Nick is good.
There are a few decent scares in the beginning.
The music is done well.

The bad?
The first Mirrors was good but was it good enough to warrant a sequel?
I'll have to say no.
The gore was phony and total over kill.
The senseless nudity which sorry adds nothing to the film.
The story line dissolved into complete rubbish by the end of the movie.
It was watchable but I can see why it didn't make it to theaters.
I'll recommend a rental to anyone who loved the first one or people like me who can't help but watch a train wreck once in a while.
I hope the souls trapped in the mirrors have enough sense to do away with anyone who tries to make a third movie.",1296259200,11,998,4.139175257731959
4228834,3,B003YF9PZY,"Not really a sequel, this horror flick has some imaginative albeit gory death scenes.  The story is fairly predictable and the acting is passable although Nick Stahl sleepwalks through his performance.
Also a puzzling plot hole.  One of the potential victims apparently had nothing to do with the revenge plot---so why is the vengeful spirit after him?
Fans of the original may be disappointed but it's decent enough.",1295740800,6,417,5.117647058823529
4228835,4,B003YF9PZY,"Beneath the gore, the violence, and the destructive behavior of the characters lies a decent ghost story. It is a story that has been told before, but those who rent or buy a film like this one don't necessarily watch it for originality. This film delivers in terms of atmosphere, and the actors do a fairly good job.

Nick Stahl is good as the leading man, a young security guard who has experienced a tragic car accident. The accident kills his fiancee, but he is brought back to life by paramedics. His wealthy father (William Katt) gives him a security job at the Mayflower, a large building that he owns, hoping that he can get back on his feet and put the tragedy behind him. Once he begins working, however, he begins to have visions of a ghost girl in the mirrors of the building's basement, and with the help of the girl's sister (Emmanuel Vaugier), they search for clues as to what happened to her.

The film pulls no punches; it is exactly what you would expect, which is a combination of ""Stir Of Echoes"" and the first ""Mirrors."" The film is graphic at times, but does not rack up a huge body count. Christy Romano, the girl from Kim Possible, appears in the film also, and she is....shall we say...all grown up now. All in all, a formulaic but entertaining film, and something about it just draws you in. I found myself engaged until the film's ending. 3.5 stars.",1295136000,16,1376,4.47808764940239

8409139,3,B003YF9PZY,"The Film is good as an addition to the first one, but as a film itself its not that great, it is nowhere near as good as the first, it feels cheap like a made for tv film and it startes as a horror and has a gorey start with the kills then turns into a supernatural thriller half way through rather than a horror and goes down hill. The quality is quite good so if your wondering if its a good transfer then it is, you also get a double sided dvd along with the bluray the double sided dvd has the original korean movie on it on the flipside of it. The Audio is 5.1DTS on the bluray so the sound is pretty decent. so its good as an addition to the original otherwise if you havnt seen the 2008 film mirrors starring kiefer sutherland I suggest you watch that first..",1506124800,,766,4.0130718954248366
