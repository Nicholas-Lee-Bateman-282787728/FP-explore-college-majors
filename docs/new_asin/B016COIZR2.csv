The site is ""having trouble finding the order"" but I managed to find the order number. There is no way to get a refund other than to go through this system that is not working correctly right now?  I don't want a refund, I want a replacement, because I want these episodes.",1454371200,2,428,4.558441558441558

In the process of getting a third and I suspect it will have the same problem. For sixty dollars can you please send me something that works?!",1451433600,5,281,4.423076923076923
