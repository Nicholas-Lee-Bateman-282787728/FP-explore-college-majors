8022943,4,B00026L844,"Unlike NBC's ""Trauma"" where it is filmed in SF for TV, this is REAL and be aware that even the cover shows BLOOD, there is something to be alarmed about. This is NOT for the queasy nor faint at heart. You can fast forward for the 'blood and guts' that is filmed. NOTE: NOT ALL OF THIS is gross, they do, do other activities. It is more like the old On Scene with less narration.  This seems to be boring at times, but they do REALLY WORK. They do NOT just lounge around. These people are not just brave, but tireless. They keep on working and take back to back calls. This is good the way it is portrayed. Others may fear for the worst, but throughout they do other types of calls and just do not ONLY do Trauma or Emergency type calls. Interesting though.
Don't see how some of them pick up the heavy array of patients/victims. Atleast they follow around the lives of these crews and see what they really do. Should of maybe had a medical flight crew (AirMedics) and maybe a Special Event they cover(Concerts)?
Lorenzo seems to capture what other Directors don't REAL Activity, it truely is a challenge for him and his crew. Getting permission from these people that are at their worst to 'waiver' for the filming and get the job done from start to finish of the Golden Hour...",1254441600,,1278,4.369747899159663
