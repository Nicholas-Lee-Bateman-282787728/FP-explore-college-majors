6014604,4,B00FMGPVPG,"If you don't go in thinking this great little movie is going to be The Exorcist with a voodoo priest or a Danny Trejo action film, you'll be pleasantly surprised! It's like the child of A Nightmare on Elm Street and Hellraiser -- bizarre, complicated and unexpected. If you like B-movies and 80s horror, you will probably enjoy it like I did.",1389657600,,342,4.532258064516129
6014605,1,B00FMGPVPG,"The film opens with mom (Nancy La Scala) apparently being involved in some kind of voodoo as she kills herself to protect her sons Cody (David Thomas Jenkins) and Aiden (Ryan Caltagirone), the latter of which witnesses the event. We then flash forward to the future where Cody is a mental hospital doctor who has gone missing in Haiti. Aiden and Bree, (Kerry Knuppe) his news reporter girlfriend take off to Haiti to investigate his disappearance.

While in Haiti they cross over into the whatever and must face demons from their past at which point I had to ask, ""Why did they go there?"" They turned what was a poorly acted and written film into one that wasn't worth watching all together. Most of the filming was done inside a building. Trejo plays Kross the assistant who literally read his lines. Ryan Caltagirone has done better.

The film doesn't need to be in your Danny Trejo collection. It doesn't pass the smell test.

8616904,1,B00FMGPVPG,"So bad, probably the worst movie I have ever seen, a sad wast of 90min.

Acting is pathetic, the director must have been asleep not to notice how bad the acting was.

The story is uninteresting and leads to a low budget monster fighting the lead.",1419033600,,246,4.326086956521739
8616905,3,B00FMGPVPG,I like Danny Trejo and horror good movie on those merits alone,1414454400,,62,4.25
8616906,3,B00FMGPVPG,It was Ok. Danny Trejo wasent really in it that much so don't expect to see him much. Not a GREAT movie...but not the worse one I've ever seen. 5 out of 10.,1411776000,,156,3.757575757575758
8616907,3,B00FMGPVPG,"Not as intriguing as I thought it would be, I took a chance on this movie hoping the 2 star rating would prove me wrong... Well, it didn't. The plot was weak, movie props were awful, it was a B movie at best.",1410825600,,208,3.86046511627907
8616908,1,B00FMGPVPG,"This movie is one of the worst horror films I have ever seen. When I watched the preview I was stoked! Horror movie an asylum and voodoo?? Sounded like I won the lotto. But then I watched it......I don't mind the occasional cheesy movie with D list celebs as long as it has a good plot. But this was awful. The lines were terrible the scenes were God awful. They had a chance to make a decent movie but instead it crashed and burned. The second the movie started getting slightly good something corny happened. So if you like cheesy horror flicks with actors you've never seen and when you finally see the monster/demon and it looks like a card board cut out then this is spot on your movie. If not...don't bother

1 star out of pity",1392681600,,733,4.311594202898551
