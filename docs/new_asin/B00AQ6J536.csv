5469289,4,B00AQ6J536,"Fritz Lang's ""Ministry of Fear"" resembles a Hitchockian thriller, as Ray Milland plays our hero in a ""Wrong Man"" scenario. Milland who would win an Oscar the following year for his most famous performance, ""The Lost Weekend,"" shines in this movie too as Stephen Neale, caught in a mix of political espionage during the height of the Second World War. Milland is mistaken for someone else and given access to a very sensitive material that's hidden in a cake. As the story unfolds, Neale meets a cast of characters that the audience is unsure of who is helping Neale and who is out to hurt him.

Fritz Lang is known for his noir like features, ""M"" comes to mind. While Ministry of Fear is probably not one of his most famous movies, it's a suspenseful thriller that will keep the audience guessing the entire time. I'm glad to see it restored on Criterion.",1365984000,4,855,4.588235294117647
5469290,1,B00AQ6J536,"I love Criterion.  I love noir.  And I certainly love
Fritz Lang.  (MAN HUNT, his edge of your seat film of
Geoffrey Household's man-who-wants-to-assassinate-
Hitler, still raises my pulse rate!)  So why didn't I
like Lang's MINISTRY OF FEAR?

Ray Milland makes a very weak hero.  His motivations
- admittedly diluted from the Graham Greene novel on
which the film is based - are murky and not exactly
sympathetic.  The motivations of his female companion,
Marjorie Reynolds, are equally vague and uninteresting.

Criterion's print is crisp; Lang's direction is not.
The only time there is any suspense comes when the
Milland/Reynold team take refuge in the shadows on a glistening
rooftop, hiding from gunmen (Naziis?).  But then my lids
slid down and I slumped against my pillow.

I hope Ray extricated himself from his wartime
problems.  For myself, I could care less.",1365033600,6,871,5.063380281690141
5469291,4,B00AQ6J536,"For a 1944 spy movie, Fritz Lang's MINISTRY OF FEAR holds up pretty well.  I had never seen it before I watched it the other night via the new 2K digital restoration DVD from The Criterion Collection.

The picture, set in WW2 England, stars Ray Milland, playing a man who has just been released from an asylum.  He had been incarcerated because of his passive role in the mercy killing of his wife.

Waiting for the train to London, he stops at a seemingly innocent village fair after which he finds himself caught up in a baffling web of espionage and murder that has him being chased by both Nazi agents and the police.

Also in the cast are Marjorie Reynolds, Carl Esmond, Hillary Brooke, Alan Napier and Dan Duryea.

Although I certainly did enjoy the film, adapted by Seton I. Miller from a novel by Graham Greene, I couldn't help wondering how Alfred Hitchcock would have handled this same material.  In a Hitchcock thriller, audiences become emotionally involved with the film's hero, as they view much of the action from his standpoint.  However, in MINISTRY OF FEAR, the viewer is more often than not, just an ""observer"".

In all fairness to Lang, a master at creating dark moods and atmosphere, there are many effective sequences in MINISTRY OF FEAR, particularly in the initial fifteen-twenty minutes.  Yet, this not one of Lang's better efforts and, according to the Glenn Kenny essay that accompanies the DVD and the on-camera interview with Joe McElhaney, the director was well aware of this.  These scholars, for the most part, place the blame for the picture's shortcomings on Miller, also the associate producer, who prevented Lang from fully doing the kind of movie he did best, and whose screenplay did not do proper service to Greene's novel.  Indeed, there are moments in the picture where a character's actions make no sense whatsoever.

 Nevertheless, MINISTRY OF FEAR is an engrossing thriller.  It's just not ""great"".

5469292,4,B00AQ6J536,"What a curious film is 1944's MINISTRY OF FEAR, with its persistent excursions into the peculiar. It's a World War II spy thriller and based on Graham Greene's novel. Acclaimed director and German expatriate Fritz Lang has remarked that MINISTRY OF FEAR isn't one of his favorite works. But there's no doubting the film's ability to pique the viewer's interest. Watching this thing, the viewer will at least scratch his head several times.

It's even fitting that our protagonist is an Englishman who'd just finished serving a two year stint in the Lembridge Asylum for killing his wife, except that Stephen Neale (Ray Milland) pleads extenuating circumstances. Today, even though England is being bombed with frightening frequency by the Luftwaffe, he just wants to re-enter society and blend in like regular folks. He shouldn't have gone to that charity fair being conducted by old dowager volunteers. But Stephen Neale was waiting to catch a train, and he had time to kill.

In the fair he's coaxed into having his fortune read by a palm reader who proceeds to deliver a cryptic message: ""My instructions are these: What you want is the cake."" The rest of the instructions allow Neal to win a weight-guessing game, the prize of which is a cake. What sort of cake? Why, a McGuffin cake.

Ray Milland wears perplexity pretty well, and this suits the film ideally. His character's muddling thru is marked by frequent bouts of bafflement. The kernel of the plot concerns his efforts to expose a spy ring. Except that Stephen Neale is a rank amateur in this atmospheric game of intrigue. Along the way, he stumbles onto a seance, is accused of murder, and, yes, is assaulted and repeatedly shot at over the cake he'd won by mistake. Turns out, the loony bin was a whole lot safer.

MINISTRY OF FEAR is a moody and underrated mystery thriller, and maybe it's underrated because of the offbeat turns the plot takes. Credit Fritz Lang's knack for stringing along the audience. I liked the story's unpredictability. Lang massages that bump of paranoia until I wasn't sure whom I could trust onscreen. There is no dearth of untrustworthy characters. Even those amicable Austrian siblings, Carla (Marjorie Reynolds) and Willi (Carl Esmond), who elect to assist Stephen Neale in his improbable task, I gazed at them all askance. The sinister Dan Duryea is also here. As far as Dan Duryea is concerned, heck, probably even his mother looked at him with suspicion.",1357516800,41,2453,4.889423076923077

5469310,4,B00AQ6J536,"In stylistic terms, Fritz Lang's MINISTRY OF FEAR looks like a follow-up to Paramount's THIS GUN FOR HIRE (1942), their adaptation of Graham Greene's fast-moving novel that catapulted Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake to stardom. This time the stars are Ray Milland and Marjorie Reynolds, but the visual imagery is much the same; much of the action takes place in the dingy back-streets of Hollywood wartime London, or in darkened rooms where no one can trust anyone else.

MINISTRY OF FEAR contains some memorable set pieces - for example, a sance involving Mrs. Bellane (Hillary Brooke) and the sinister-looking Dr. Forrester (Alan Napier), where a single bright light focuses on Stephen Neale's (Milland's) face as he understands how the voice from the dead is actually talking to him. The screen cuts to black, a shot rings out, and Cost (Dan Duryea) lies dead next to the big table where all the sance participants have gathered.

The final sequence is equally memorable, as Stephen and Carla Hilfe (Reynolds) take refuge on the roof of a London building, and Stephen has to fire into the dark to try and kill off those people pursuing him. No one - not least the audiences - knows whether he has been successful or not, until a light goes on and Inspector Prentice (Percy Waram) becomes visible.

In this environment, no one quite knows who anyone is. Cost reappears later on as a rather incongruous-looking tailor Mr. Travers, while Mrs. Bellane appears to have a double appearing earlier on in the film. Such uncertainties seem characteristic of a wartime where everyone is out for themselves, and London is swarming with double agents.

The plot positively zips by, with Milland trying his best to cope with situations fraught with danger. The final sequence is a bit of a cop-out that has little to do with the plot, but apart from this, MINISTRY OF FEAR is well worth a look.",1462752000,,1880,4.829192546583851
5469311,3,B00AQ6J536,"This is a minor Fritz Lang film. I'm a fan of classic movies, film noir, and a couple of the other Lang films in particular he made around the same time like Scarlet Street and Woman in the Window, but while this one was watchable the first time through, Ministry of Fear ultimately fell flat. The situations portrayed seemed overly contrived and unrealistic, as did Ray Milland's performance. Glad that it was released and that I got to see it, but it's a non-essential title for a home library.",1456963200,2,496,4.584269662921348

If I didn't know better, I'd say that it's a lost middle-period Hitchcock thriller from his Hollywood period. Lang himself wavered on whether or not it was good, but directors --artists in general-- are their own worst critics. Spend the money, wait for delivery and enjoy --it's worth every penny.

5469353,3,B00AQ6J536,"Paramount pictures released Ministry of Fear in 1944. The wartime release creates an intersting hybrid: film noir propoganda. Although in 1944 film noir is not in the vernacular yet, the subtle propoganda elements are quite evident since they're designed to remind a wartime audience of ""why we fight."" Film Noir is a mood of pessimism, fatalism, and menace, which creates a dark atmosphere, highlights art deco production values, and inserts tropes, such as the femme fatale. The menacing nature, dark spirit, and legacy of the film rests in the wartime release. The war creates an irreplaceable authentcity to the picture. At this time, studios, such as Paramount, cranked out numerous war-inspired films designed to capitalize on the conflict thus propoganda becomes a major cinamatic element. However, in order to tell a compelling story, creative imagery is needed, so for inspiration early film noir screenwriters, cinematoraphers, and directors mined an older genre of film call German Expressionism. A contemporary viewing of Ministry of Fear is a metamorphic experience. German Expressionism's style uses long shots, high shadows, and distroted figures to highten the abnormal and surreal. Undoubtedly, anyone watching Ministry of Fear will immediately pick up on these techniques. Using fear as a common denomenator, German Experssionism of the 1920s & 1930s transforms  into film noir of the 1940s & 1950s. Director Fritz Lang is the perfect person to oversee the tansition of fear from German Expressionism. Lang pioneered German Expressionism in the teens and twenties, but fled Nazi Germany in 1933 after Joseph Goebbels wanted him to become head of the Third Reich's film ministry (a ministry of fear?). Apparently, the top Nazis brass, including Hitler, became impressed by Lang's 1920s masterpieces, such the Dr. Mabuse series, and especially, Metropolis (1927). It helps to understand historical background, but just on a visceral level it is easy to see why film noir is the direct desendant of German Expressionism. Taking a look at the opening scenes, audiences find just how convincing and effective German Expressionistic mood and imagery can be especially, when helmed by the ""original master of fear"": Fritz Lang. It helps that Lang adapted a Graham Greene novel, which uses similar film noir and espressionistic themes, motifs, and symbols. The opening scenes are indicative of the Ministry of Fear's transition from German Expressionism to film noir; they are as follows: (1) Ray Milland's character exits a sanitorium; as he is released, Milland wanders into a small carnival; through a series of unfortuante events, Milland's mind seems to stumble upon a complex Nazi plot and Milland's body soon follows. (2) The innocent country fair  is a mentally tortuous hall of mirrors for Milland's character. The country fair is also a peace-to-war metaphor because upon Milland's entrance into the fair; in what should be a refreshing, child-like fantasy world  events begin unsettling Milland's already unstable mind into paranoia and blanket fear. In a very Edgar Allan Poe way, things spiral from Milland's mind into a black reality of spies, murder, and a freak show of double-crosses. (3) During this carnival sequence, Milland ends up with a freshly baked cake - a symbol of indulgence and peaceful domesticity. By using a cake, Lang  would instantly connect with wartime audiences who would recall a cake is made with ingredients, such as sugar, cloves, etc. otherwise rationed during the war hence they would be somewhat rare and, by that token, suspicious too. The cake is not only a symbol, but part of a larger plot vehicle, which involves a Nazi suitcase later the cake symbol is traded for a devious looking dark suitcase - a symbol of menace. Thus, the cake/suitcase scenario ultimately becomes a 'why we fight"" motif as we are no longer in an domestically indulgent, peaceful world, but a abhorredly violent, darkly devious world. Thus with the opening scenes, Lang's message is complete: innocence is lost to menace and the wartime audience (and Milland) must fight back, however reluctantly, to regain some sembalance of control. Lastly, even in the introduction of Marjorie Reynold's character - a Viennese refugee - the character spurs wartime audiences thoughts of simultaneous humanitarianism and mistrust. Therefore, the film's Expressionistic opening thrusts us into a classroom of fear, where noir is the lesson, Lang the teacher, and, we the viewers, the terrified students.",1420934400,,4521,5.3188811188811185

5469360,3,B00AQ6J536,"Ministry of Fear (1944) is one of four Fritz Lang wartime espionage thrillers that were interfered with by their respective studios beyond the director's control. One understands the need for propaganda in such sensitive political times, but the need for simplistic Good v Evil and a happy end worked against Lang's usual claustrophobic obsessions. Man Hunt (1941), Hangmen Also Die (1943), Cloak and Dagger (1946) and Ministry of Fear are all films with great promise, but which are sadly flawed as a result. Ministry of Fear starts off brilliantly enough with the credits rolling over one of Lang's many clocks to appear throughout his work. Stephen Neale (Ray Milland) is counting the seconds down to the moment of his release from Lembridge Asylum where he has just spent two years because of the mercy killing of his wife. One cycle of Langian fate is concluded and another is about to kick off. The suggestion of psychological turmoil leads to four scenes where we literally can't trust what we see. First is a village fete (set at night with kids running around!!) where Neale wins a cake. We see a tall blonde figure (Dan Duryea) for the first time. He is certainly one of Lang's harbingers of fate. Second is a train sequence where a blind man is introduced by his cane tapping on the platform through a cloud of smoke. Is he a real person, or a figment of Neale's psychologically disturbed imagination? This leads to an unlikely bomb-attack, a death and a gun - actual events or more symptoms of Neale's paranoia? Third is a seance to which Neale is taken by an Austrian named Willi Hilfe (Carl Esmond) as a result of his investigation into 'The Mothers of Free Nations', an emigre charity organization responsible for the fete. At the seance we meet the tall blonde man again (calling himself Mr Cost) and in the gloom a mysterious voice claims she was poisoned by Neale - the clearest indication yet that everything we have seen so far is Neale's hallucination as it is impossible that others at the seance know about his wife. A shot rings out. Lights go up to reveal a murder with Neale the probable culprit. We are still unsure about Neale as Lang's carefully constructed mise-en-scene has so meticulously established a sense of ambiguity. An unlikely escape is followed by the last scene to really work in the film where Neale hides from his pursuers in the London Underground with Carla Hilfe (Marjorie Reynolds), the sister of Willi. As a mysterious man searches for him, Neale tells Carla about the killing of his wife. This works very well for we are as in the dark (in the underground!) about Neale as she is. In Graham Greene's book which 1944 audiences would have known, Neale's killing is more murder than assisted-suicide and they would have trusted Neale even less than we do. We are also unsure about Carla, her being of obviously Aryan extraction and a possible member of the Nazi spy ring.

Up to this point the film is Grade A film noir. Atmospheric shadowy lighting and slick camera work by Henry Sharp adds to the psychological ambiguity of Lang's mise-en-scene. A splash of paranoia here and a dash of violence there and all we need to make it a complete film noir is a femme fatale. Unfortunately characterization across the board soon becomes way too telegraphed for the film's good. Two possible femmes fatale are introduced. There's the beautiful medium, Mrs Bellane (Hillary Brooke) who is given a scene of character development only to be abrubtly forgotten. Then there is Carla who becomes merely the 'love interest'. Had our doubts about the characters been maintained until the very end, the film may have reached greatness. Too bad the carpet is ripped from under our (and Lang's) feet by the powers that be at Paramount who re-cut the film into a straight-forward goodies v baddies Boys' Own Hitchcock-wannabe spy jaunt. As the psychological complexity is stripped away so is our suspension of disbelief and we find ourselves faced with fake London sets, unbelievable wooden stereotypes mouthing movie talk which sounds terrible. It's all a far cry from the subtlety of The Woman in the Window which Lang made the same year. Traces of what could have been remain - especially the reappearance of Dan Duryea as a sinister tailor who dials a telephone number with a long pair of tailor's shears before topping himself - but these can't cover up the film's final idiocies. I found the final rooftop shoot-out ridiculous when I saw it as a kid over 30 years ago and my feeling is still the same - did Lang really shoot this? Then there's the absurd final scene of the two leads driving on the coast, talking about marriage and cake(!!) in a happy-go-lucky manner which feels like it's strayed in from another movie entirely. No, this is far from classic Lang. Lovers of Graham Greene won't like it either as the film strays too far from the book. In the book Arthur Rowe's (Stephen Neale in the film) guilt over the murder of his wife hangs over him the entire time and the final marriage between him and Anna (Carla in the film) is far from spontaneous and care-free. It's ironic that the original book is more Langian than Lang's film version of it. Paramount's efforts to turn the film into another Foreign Correspondent (1940) or Saboteur (1941) fudged the themes Greene and Lang were trying to ellucidate with the result that both of them duly hated the film when it was released. A curate's egg then, but the DVD itself is good. Optimum Home Entertainment have done a good job with the visual side, but the sound is too recessed for my liking. No extras, but at this price Lang devotees should snap this up as quickly as they can.",1411430400,4,5676,4.727547931382442

5469373,3,B00AQ6J536,"Most things I've read about this movie characterize it as an anti-Nazi movie -- and that's fair enough, but what's odd is the threat that the Nazis pose.  Of course they are after British secrets about troop deployments etc., but as far as the movie is concerned, they are masters of disguise and not the goose-stepping war machine.  They represent the conspiracy that seems to be required in all noir-ish movies of this kind -- as in ""Three Days of the Condor,"" for example. The interest of ""The Ministry of Fear"" comes from the accidental involvement with their plans by Stephen Neale, recently released from a mental hospital following his mercy-killing of his terminally ill wife.  He is mistaken for someone else at a village fair and ""wins"" a cake that should have gone to a Nazi spy.  From then on he becomes a hunted man -- hunted by both the Nazi spy ring and by British Intelligence Services, who are not at all sure that he isn't one of the spy ring.

That's enough to say without spoilers about the plot, but what's interesting is the consistent focus on Stephen's point of view -- and because he is confused, the viewer is forced to share that confusion, for no other viewpoint is available.  For example, at one point, when Stephen is told that he's at Scotland Yard, our first impulse is to doubt that!  But that deployment of Stephen's viewpoint is what generates the suspense -- when he's going through doors, he never quite knows what to expect, and we don't either.  There are plenty of empty corridors, staircases, enclosed spaces like a railway carriage or a seance room, that generate a sense of claustrophobia along with the suspense.  As Neale tries to explain his situation, people doubt his sanity -- he is, after all, just out of the looney-bin.  However, Stephen himself never really does.  A weakness of the film might be that Ray Milland isn't quite confused enough, or at least doesn't seem so.  He often seems puzzled, but never close to insane, either in his mind or ours.  It is creepy, though, how quickly the Nazis seem to learn about his history (not to mention how all these middle-aged women at the village fair seem to be in on the business with the cake!).

Overall, I preferred ""The Third Man,"" but it's a film that perhaps isn't totally comparable, because the moral status of Harry Lime is a serious concern of that movie.  The tension in ""Ministry of Fear"" isn't generated by any moral concerns -- the atmosphere of distrust is all that matters, and the effective use of the camera and the settings and design in the creation of that atmosphere is the main reason to see this.  There is no comparable interest in character, and of course that limits the nature and degree of our identification with Neale, the protagonist.  The Criterion print is good, and the sound has been well restored.  It's fun to watch, but it's not deeply engaging.

NOTE: I haven't read the Graham Greene novel on which this movie is based.  Apparently, great liberties were taken, and Greene wasn't very happy with the resulting film.",1405987200,,3056,4.676635514018692

So I skimmed through a review on dvdBeaver.com and it praised the film saying it was one of Langs finest US productions. I didn't read further since I didn't want to know any spoilers of the plot and wanted to be surprised while watching the film. So based partly on that one line review, on the great title, which coming from a German filmmaker escaping Nazi Germany I figured would have great input within the sub-text of the film and also the wonderful cover artwork Criterion chose, I hoped to see a great film. Was it good, yes....was it great, nope. Unfortunately, being a film lover one expects more from the better directors and hold them, whether it is justified/right or not, to a higher level of expectation. If I had just stumbled across this film on TV and watched it without any pre-conceived notions perhaps I would have enjoyed it more but the story is lacking and could have benefited from a strong rewrite.

5469388,3,B00AQ6J536,"In my opinion this is a lesser Fritz Lang film but the Criterion BD gives a beautiful picture and good sound.
Reading the Amazon reviews of this film is very enjoyable, one saying that Ray Milland puts him to sleep and another saying the only good thing about the film is Ray Milland's acting.
The plot is convoluted, a bomb exploding in an apartment is one of the worst effects ever done in Hollywood and the contrived romance between the two leads is far fetched even by Hollywood standards.  The only suspense is the lead character trying to convince the police that what he says is true.
So what is good about this film?  The acting is good (unless you hate Ray Milland) even though the plot can confuse the hell out of you with all the loose ends, but if you just let the film unwind and you go with the flow, it becomes an enjoyable spy picture.
It seems that this picture was NOT a ""Fritz Lang picture"" in that he did not have complete control, others controlled the script, but even with that he did a good job of setting up the scenes and the lighting and photography are really good.  If you are looking for a really great spy thriller, this ain't it.  It is an enjoyable spy picture as long as you don't analyze it too much.",1378166400,5,1235,4.310344827586207

5469391,4,B00AQ6J536,"There may be spoilers.

I remember getting a pretty good deal on this Criterion Blu ray edition of this Fritz Lang directed film.  Although I had never seen it before, I will pretty much see anything with Lang's name attached, especially when he's in charge.  The setting is England smack dab in the middle of WW II and the Nazi's are bombing the hell out of the place.  Stephen Neale (Ray Milland) is about to be released from the ""asylum"" where he was placed after his implication in his wife's death.  We are not sure early on what happened but it comes out in bits and pieces as the story develops.

Before getting on a train to London where he will get a fresh start (dodging bombs I guess) Neale stops for a charity event near the station.  He's persuaded to guess the weight of a large cake which he correctly guesses thanks to a fortune teller who gives him the answer.  Alas the fortune teller gave the information to the wrong man.  After Neale boards the train, complete with cake in hand, he is joined in his compartment by a supposed blind man.  As it turns out the blind man isn't what he seems.  As a quick aside this is the first time I've ever heard anyone pronounce Nazi as Nazee rather than Natzy.  Sorry.

The blind man is just the first in a series of misdirection involving people and who they may or may not be.  While it is certainly not difficult to identify the bad guys for most viewers of this stylized type thriller, there is enough illusion to keep you guessing.  As Neale runs after the man who took his cake, a Nazi bomb drops on the guy as well as the cake.  So what's going on here?

After getting to London, Neale hires a private investigator to help him figure that out beginning with the charity organization who sponsored the cake guessing contest.  Eventually he meets the lovely Austrian woman, Carla Hilfe (Marjorie Reynolds) and her brother Willi (Carl Esmond) who head the organization.  It turns out there are German spies afoot in England and the cake was smuggling microfilm containing British defense secrets.

Lang's use of the camera is very well done.  There are some interesting scenes where the angle of the camera is tilted up or down giving the shots a different perspective.  In one particular scene, as Neale is about to confront one of the bad guys at a tailor's shop, he sits next to a wall that turns out to be a wall-to-wall mirror just reflecting what he was looking at, off screen from the viewer's perspective.  It had me fooled!  ""Ministry of Fear"" was adapted from a Graham Greene novel and he was allegedly furious over the film.  Lang had changed many of the elements Greene thought were critical to the story.  Personally, I don't care.  While this may not be the masterpiece film in Lang's body of work, it is still an excellent film by any standard.

As usual Criterion handles the transfer well.  Look for a 1.37:1 aspect ratio and a 1080p resolution.  Here are the notes from Criterion regarding the video:

 ""This new digital transfer was created in 2K resolution on a Lasergraphics scanner from a 35mm safety fine-grain master. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, and jitter were manually removed using MTI's DRS and Pixel Farm's PFClean, while Image Systems' Phoenix was used for small dirt, grain, noise reduction, and flicker.

 Transfer supervisor: Lee Kline.
 Colorists: Jason Crump/Metropolis Post, New York; Lee Kline.""

The menu is easy to use, and the discussion about Lang and the movie is informative, especially in resolving differences between the movie and Graham Greene's original novel (Greene didn't like the movie adaptation).

8556145,5,B00AQ6J536,"""Ministry of Fear"" is based on the novel by Graham Greene and was directed by one of Hollywoods great directors Fritz Lang. The story has a kind of Hitchcockian flavor, but if one listens to the interview which is on the disc about the film and Fritz Lang, one will hear the differences between the two great directors. Interestingly, in this interview, Joe McElhaney suggests that this is not one of Lang's greatest films, M being one of his greatest, but compared to films directed by others, it is great.  I agree.
The black and white film was made in 1943 during World War II and is about England being infiltrated by Nazis.  The Ray Milland character is released from a mental institution and told as he leaves to be careful and not do an illegal act again. We do not know at this point why he was institutionalized and what was his crime. He says what he wants to do now is live in peace. This does not happen. He stumbles unwittingly into a case of sabotage. Had he taken the train immediately instead of going into a fair and having his fortune read, he would have been able to live in peace. But the fortune teller mistakes him for another man and he is given a cake containing an article the Nazis want.
A man posing as a blind man steals the cake from him, but is then killed in a bombing. Milland wants to find out what is going on and what was in the cake and becomes involved in many episodes, including murder and suicide.",1521417600,2,1437,4.338289962825279
