I wrote a review of it on my blog, ""Recovering Third Culture Kid.""  [...]",1358121600,2,251,4.1875
8537409,5,B0097CT2WE,"Watching the trailer for The Road Home online set me on an urgent, international mission to get the DVD, so I was thrilled to be notified that they had been re-stocked at Amazon.com. The Road Home is, above all, cinematic storytelling at its very best. The narrative is woven through with aching questions of meaning, identity and culture, but Mr. Gandotra has masterfully tucked in the seams and smoothed out the wrinkles in a way that only the greatest storytellers can do. While the story itself will immediately draw in all viewers from its stunning opening scene, it also offers deep, powerful waves of resonance and meaning for those of us who live, love and learn in multiple cultures, nations and races, those of us who may be ascribed identities by the world that are very different from who we are on the inside. The Road Home feels like a beautiful love letter to all of us, and to the whole world!...",1357776000,2,912,4.635802469135802
8537410,5,B0097CT2WE,"The writer/director has given us a film that echoes his own experiences as a Third Culture Kid (TCK) in a boarding school in India. Pico is British and has come from England to study in Woodstock School in the foothills of the Himalayas. His self-identity is British, but his family at some point must have come from South Asia, so Pico's hair and skin signal ""Indian"" to those he meets in India. Tired of the pressure to be someone he is not, Pico decides to run away from the school. But then.... Ah, I can't reveal more.
  Wherever you live there are people like Pico around you because of the world-wide diaspora of peoples. Those of the second generation and beyond are the ones most likely to be mistaken for new immigrants when they are actually as much American or Canadian or British or French or whatever as are those traditionally recognized as such. ""The Road Home"" is an excellent film to help us empathize with those of mixed heritage.",1357171200,2,949,4.576470588235294
