7076460,5,B00V4TUECA,"This movie was good. I guess i didn't realize both of the sister were pregnant at the same time, and one sister lost her baby and cliam the other sister's baby. Very well done and I would recommend everybody to see.",1441670400,5,215,4.2682926829268295

7076463,3,B00V4TUECA,"I disagree with the previous reviewer. For an independent film, it told the story well. Yes, there are its issues with some scenes lingering but I enjoyed the story and it shared a message we all need in every family. Keep using your gifts.",1434758400,3,240,4.4772727272727275

7076506,1,B00V4TUECA,Too slow and poor acting,1494979200,,24,4.0
7076507,1,B00V4TUECA,One of the producers.. Tony.. is a lying manipulator who finances his B movies by coning investors and never paying them back. He pays the actors with the investors money upfront... and ditches the investors. Not a good look for a wanna be producer.... with real credentials. These actors deserve better  and are potentially ruining their reputation by dealing with someone with such a lack of qualifications and character.  I hope they never deal with this guy again.,1492992000,,468,4.987179487179487
7076508,1,B00V4TUECA,This movie made no sense at all. Every character in it is stupid!!! The writing is poor and the acting is less than mediocre. Do not waste your time.,1488758400,,149,4.172413793103448

7076542,3,B00V4TUECA,Ok B-Movie with a Message Despite the Very Bad Deception by One Family Member to Another.,1483574400,,89,4.625
7076543,3,B00V4TUECA,I give it an E for effort. They tried. Had the actors and the script been more polished it would have had  better potential at being good. This was just far fetched and poorly written. I have so many questions. What was the so called rich wife suffering with? When did the husband realize he should stop cheating and go home to his sick wife? Why was his assistant so close to his wife where she could just pop up at her house anytime she felt like it? I say take it back to the drawing board and try again.,1483574400,,507,4.07

8709126,1,B00V4TUECA,Never in my day have I ever seen the movie so garbage and I've seen Catwoman. I was surprised to see old boy from Life in this movie AKA Juwanna Mann like how did he end up here of all movies like low budget this is like lower than the low budget movie y'all need to go back to the drawing board and figure out what y'all doing with your lives cuz this ain't it like pure trash can juice. this movie is so confusing this timeline is weird at one point it appears she does a flashback would you want to man but she never flashes back to current time for what it appears to be in now the sister is a spoiler alert I'm not going to spoil this trash. like what was the budget of this movie did they spend all that money on getting Juwanna Mann in because we're both of this movie but I think like maybe like 3 or 4 minutes of bulk of this movie was all stock footage. I am sorry that this review is so long but hey my time was wasted watching this trash movie I want to waste other folks time to payback is a mother ain't it live long eat cheese,1532995200,,1041,3.892018779342723

8709130,2,B00V4TUECA,"I did enjoy all the preaching and prayers, they were very well done, but .whatever happened to the ending?

It left us up in the air after the woman's water broke, which is really horrific writing.

Why She Cries should have had a Part 2 to continue watching to see a decent ending of this movie.

This was not a professional movie at all.

So glad this was included to watch with my paid yearly Amazon Prime Membership, because to make a purchase of this movie without Amazon Prime Membership is really not recommended.",1515628800,,520,4.5
