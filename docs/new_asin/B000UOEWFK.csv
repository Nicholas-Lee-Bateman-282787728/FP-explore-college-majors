Through the course of the video, the personality of each is developed, and you find yourself rooting for the princess dog, or the dog with the california surfer drawl. As a dog trainer myself, I was delighted to see the dogs actually opening doors, laying bricks, and doing a multitude of amazing tricks! My hat off to all the wonderful dog actors!",1196121600,,537,4.723404255319149
8214140,5,B000UOEWFK,"My four year old daughter is absolutely captivated by this video!  The catchy songs, colorful graphics, and lovable dogs make this one of her favorite videos.  From a parent's perspective, I appreciate the fresh, creative approach of this video - using real dogs to tell a classic story with a new message that enforces positive social skills.  From a teacher's perspective, this video helps children with the early literacy skill of rhyming through song and repetition, therefore making it great for kindergarten readiness.",1187222400,,524,5.289156626506024
8214141,5,B000UOEWFK,"I don't have kids, but I bought this video for when my nephews and nieces come over and need to be entertained.  I was surprised how much I liked this live action take on ""The Three Little Pigs"" considering I'm not even a kid myself!  The dogs were really cute and acted out the story with help from a fuzzy big puppet.  Nice touch!  The songs were catchy and I still keep humming some of the tunes.
I really recommend this video for kids and adults, since most of the kids video's I've bought so far are obviously only for kids - this is a video that entertains everyone!",1186704000,,572,4.220183486238532
8214142,5,B000UOEWFK,"My (almost 4 years old) son loves this video.  We only let him watch TV on the weekends, one thing on each day.  And he has asked to watch this DVD the last 3 times in a row.  He is captivated by the 3 little pigs story, enjoys the song, and gets up and dances, struts and spins along with the last section.  He's very engaged.

From the parents point of view, there is a lot to like here.  I like the content of the story - it follows the basic 3 pigs story, but with a twist at the end with some positive/educational messages.  It's subtly educational, without being patronizing.  It has enough suspense to really grab my son, but not enough to scare him.  The section at the end is a great transition back to playing, because it has my son up and dancing.  It also keeps TV-watching from being a couch-potato event.  But there's not too much of it - he doesn't want to do an exercise video at this stage of his life.  :)

In another important parenting note - I enjoy watching this video.  I've seen it with him every time.  I was surprised at how much I like it, as I'm not a huge fan of this genre.  (I generally find children's TV to be fairly annoying.)  I get more out of this video every time we see it.

Finally -  I love the dogs in this video.  The dogs are filmed in  natural behavior, no special effects, and the audio and story is matched to them.  It's brilliant - very well done.  I'm amazed that you can do that and still get a very cohesive, entertaining story.  You can tell from the body language of the dogs that they are very comfortable and enjoying the performance.  It's really neat to see everyday dogs - just like the ones we all have at home, doing something so professional and entertaining.",1186704000,,1721,4.205521472392638
