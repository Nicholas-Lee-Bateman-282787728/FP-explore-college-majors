318439,4,6301229606,"This is an excellent, entertaining biopic of the early career of Errol Flynn. I was never a fan of Flynn the actor but I enjoyed this film of a movie megastar emerging out of the old Hollywood studio system. It begins with Flynn's arrival in Hwood as a former world traveler and adventurer who is an innocent in this new wilderness

Duncan Regehr, a Canadian actor I never heard of, strides through the role with vigor, humor, and pathos. But it is the supporting roles that give weight and charm to the movie: Barbara Hershey as the tempestuous Lili Damita, a Flynn spouse...Hal Linden as the formidable and at times hilarious Jack Warner with whom Flynn butts heads and wins grudging respect (and fat pay raises)...Darren McGavin as irrepressible Dr. Gerit Koets, a buddy from Flynn's globe-trotting days...Barrie Ingham as a dead-on, aging John Barrymore, who forms a surprising and poignant friendship with the upcoming young star.

Whatever Flynn became after his career was ruined by rape charges of which he was acquitted, this film presents him as an atypical Hollywood icon who early on was more likely to associate with his stuntman double than the usual dissolute hangers-on in La-La-Land.",1212364800,8,1200,4.965174129353234
318440,5,6301229606,"This film is highly entertaining because it deals with an actor that is kind of a legend, Erroll Flynn. He is at once a success and particularly with women, especially young women, if not teenagers and girls, with his films. He marries a French actress who was also very popular. She more or less forces him into marrying her, but she cannot cope with his success and feels cheated and rejected. So she gets into a decaying approach of her own life.

When she gets pregnant she decides to ask for a divorce, bringing together what could be a great joy with what is a great drama. She has never been able to cope with the success of her own husband that she married within this own success. Maybe she was hoping to make him her devotee, her ""slave"" and that shows she had not understood what the life of a popular actor is.

The sad point of the film, and what I have just told is sad enough, is that Erroll Flynn is more or less broken in his career by these events and he loses his art, his talent, and little by little delves into marginal compensations such as alcohol and sex. This leads to a totally unfair accusation of rape. He is acquitted by a court but the stain will remain forever and he will be finished in his career, in his life, in his psyche even. Hollywood is often enough a long and dangerous pilgrimage to hell more often than to heavens.

318442,2,6301229606,"It has been said about Ken Burns' series on the Civil War that ""the less you know about the Civil War, the more you will enjoy this series.""
The same holds true for ""My Wicked, Wicked Ways,""  the 1985 television bio of film legend Errol Flynn. Anyone who knows  anything about Flynn and his wildly scandalous quarter-century in Hollywood  will find this production shallow and unsatisfying. Perhaps that's because  the project was the brainchild of one of Flynn's daughters, who reportedly  controlled nearly all production and interpretive aspects of the  film.
Flynn is portrayed by Duncan Regehr, a capable actor who,  unfortunately, lacks the enormous charisma and on-screen magnetism of Errol  Flynn. Occasionally he looks a little like Flynn -- but making comparisons  here may be unfair. Errol Flynn was perhaps the most beautiful man of his  or any other time, and to expect someone to measure up to that is  unrealistic. At any rate, Regehr's portrayal is acceptable, but nothing  more.
The film hints at Flynn's physical prowess in a fistfight or in  bed, and pretty much glosses over the rest -- his epic drinking, his  unsavory relationships, his drug abuse and brawls and unrelenting hedonism,  all of which killed him when he was only 50 years old.
Another  unsatisfying element of ""My Wicked, Wicked Ways"" is that it ends  at the conclusion of Flynn's 1942 rape trial. What about the rest of his  life? The slow decline and ultimate demise of one of the screen's most  magnificent specimens is, arguably, even more interesting than his  heyday.
Watch this is if you must, but once will probably be enough.",913939200,16,1620,4.92962962962963

7810146,4,6301229606,"Typical 1980s miniseries - acting and costuming was well done, music was generic. Nice to see a cast that did not include the usual stars of the 80s; I didn't even know Barbara Hershey did television...

Then why four stars, you ask?

Two words - Duncan Regehr. He didn't do an Errol Flynn impression but, let's face it, the man doesn't have to. He channels the same sex appeal that Errol did. Plus, he captures that flair of 1940s Hollywood superbly!",1495756800,,451,4.555555555555555

This TV movie is a simplified history of Errol Flynn, a well known action movie star of the late 1930s. He starred in many historical dramas, such as They Died With Their Boots On, the Hollywood History of the great George Armstrong Custer. Custer was an American hero since the Battle of Gettysburg (which he helped win by defeating JEB Stuarts The Invincibles) to his tragic death at the Battle of the Little Big Horn. Flynns personal life was scandalous in his pursuit of women, not that others were blameless. Actors in show business had a reputation over the centuries. To learn more read one of the many books written after his death. American law says no one can be libeled after they are dead. He was a good actor but not one of the greats.

Flynn, like Bogart, owned a yacht that was his other pleasure in life. It took him out on the ocean and away from unwanted publicity. Flynn came to America from Australia where he worked as a merchant seaman and contracted malaria and fever. He must have been wild and avoided an education and the life that goes with it. His drinking escapades shortened his life, dying at age fifty. Most of his movies were in monochrome and are seldom shown on TV today even though these historical dramas are often better than more modern movies (if you like historical dramas). Many WW II era movies are also banned today (unless used as filler at less popular times). Did all that drinking and carousing suggest a personality fault? Do you know anyone like that?

Jerry Gieslers book about his famous law cases is more interesting and educational than this movie. But it cant be adapted to a movie. Giesler began his law career as a member of Earl Rogers law firm. Some say Earl Rogers was the inspiration for Perry Mason.",1445040000,,1796,4.571428571428571

7810153,5,6301229606,"I worked on WICKED WICKED WAYS with Barry Mahon, Doris Keating's father. Barry, was Errol Flynn's manager and the president of his company for many years. Doris was the head producer on WICKED WAYS. Barry was also Errol's personal pilot before being his manager. Doris was the GOD-daughter of Errol Flynn, not his daughter. You can label me bias, but in my opinion, Doris told an accurate and fair story about Errol's life. She did everything right and made a quality film. All of her films, most of which I worked on in some capacity directly or indirectly through her father -- were quality. Among these films were, PASSION FLOWER, TOUCH OF SCANDAL, STRANDED, TAKING LEAVE. She gave Barbara Hershey and others their start. She could pick out talent like no one else. She was a class act. For WICKED, she auditioned hundreds of actors to find Duncan Regehr. One could not find a better ""Errol Flynn,"" and Barry, who was one of my mentors, knew Errol quite well so it's highly unlikely that Duncan was not a perfect candidate to represent Errol in his true-life story. See [...] Lastly, I know for a fact that Doris was quite willing to put anything and everything about Errol's life into the movie because she and her dad used to tell me endless ""spicy"" stories about what it was like hanging out with Errol and the Warner brothers, Marilyn, Orson, etc. So it was not Doris or Barry that would attempt to made the movie ""shallow or unsatisfying"" -- it was the network that wanted us to tone it down for their audience. That said, the life of Errol Flynn, was a wonderful life and he provided the world some of the best entertainment ever. No one remembers any of the bogus charges brought against Errol, so why would one even bother to mention them. All celebrities have bogus charges brought against them at some point -- even Bill O' Reilly. - James Jaeger",1388275200,3,1859,4.602409638554217
