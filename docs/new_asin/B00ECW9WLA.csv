5903869,5,B00ECW9WLA,"I watched this movie with my 8 y/o niece, and was actually paying attention to most of it.  The movie's highlight was Emily Alyn Lind's acting  (From the movie ""Won't Back Down""). The musical numbers were unexpected but made the movie fun.  Also, the part of the aunt, played by Laura Bell Bundy, was very good too.  Overall, this would be great movie to watch with your kids.  It's a lot better than the oversaturation of Pixar films which are rampant these days.",1379894400,8,464,4.542168674698795
5903870,5,B00ECW9WLA,"If you enjoy comedy mixed with great musical numbers then you will love ""Dear Dumb Diary.""  ""Dear Dumb Diary"" is about a girl named Jamie Kelly who attends Mackeral Middle School and dreams of being popular and of having the boy of her dreams, Hudson, love her.  She writes all of her secrets and dreams in her diary.  She is jealous of a beautiful girl named Angeline who she feels gets more attention from Hudson than Jamie feels she deserves.

My favorite character in the movie is Jamie Kelly (Emily Alyn Lind).  She is easy to relate to as most teenagers have insecurities and lots of dreams of how their life could be better.  Jamie keeps her room really messy and only cleans it when she wants to find her missing diary. She is funny and has a great sense of humor.  Emily is a very talented girl and does a wonderful job of acting, singing and dancing in this movie.

The musical numbers in ""Dear Dumb Diary"" are well choreographed and very entertaining.  They add a great deal to the movie because it keeps the viewer's attention and adds an extra dimension to this already excellent movie.

My favorite part of the movie is actually a musical number.  It is the musical number where Jamie sings that there are too many beautiful people in the world and they need to leave to give the ordinary people a chance to shine.  The ordinary people put all of the beautiful people on a small yellow school bus and send them away.

The film has many positive messages that can apply to all age ranges.  The first is ""do not judge a book by its cover.""  Angeline, who Jamie feels is mean in the movie because she is so beautiful, actually covers for her and returns her diary without reading a single word of it.  Jamie, even though she wants to shine and be the winner in the Jump-A-Thon, helps Angeline who doesn't know how to jump.

Jamie and her best friend Isabella do this because Angeline has many sponsors and will enable the school to hire the art teacher back and provide many extracurricular activities for the school. Isabella and Jamie show maturity in putting the greater good of the school before their own personal glory.  Jamie's best friend Isabella collects for a fake charity so she can get money to buy herself contacts.  In the end, Jamie and Isabella start a charity that helps less fortunate children to get glasses. Throughout the movie, Jamie is learning the lesson that inner beauty is very important.

I give this movie five out of five stars.  It's a great family movie appropriate for ages 7 to 18. You might think it is a girl's movie but I enjoyed it and so did my twelve year old brother. I feel the music and dancing help this movie appeal to a wider audience range.

5903871,5,B00ECW9WLA,"My daughters, 5 and 7, loved this movie.  A friend suggested it, but we really didn't know much about it.  Had no idea there would be singing and dancing in the movie, but we enjoyed all the songs and had to download the soundtrack immediately.  Nice family movie :)",1462406400,,266,4.387755102040816
5903872,5,B00ECW9WLA,"Even better than the books!  We weren't expecting much when we first watched it on Netflix, but after my girls begged me to watch it over and over and over again, I finally bought it for them.  It's been our favorite since we first saw it 2+ years ago.  It's super tough finding a decent kids movie.  Couple that with one that isn't inappropriate on so many levels and you're left with nothing.  Enter Dear Dumb Diary.  It's """"adult-friendly"" as well....still makes me chuckle in parts.  5 stars for sure!",1461369600,,505,4.544444444444444

5903883,3,B00ECW9WLA,"I'm writing this review with both myself and my five-year-old in mind.  We are hardly the target audience.

First, my daughter misses a lot of the humor in this movie, but the frequent musical numbers kept her interest...for about 40 minutes.  Problem is there were too many musical numbers detracted from the storyline.

Second, as an adult, I was in stitches (for the first half hour) because I totally understand what it's like to be a kid who sees the tiniest things as a sign that my crush a so in love with me, and I sure as hell wrote in my diary about it!!  Since we all did something similar, we understand. :D  I'm not sure the pre-teen set will quite get it, but I thought half an hour of it was funny.  I also had quite the laugh over Jaime thinking her 32-year-old aunt is a dinosaur.  I remember being in high school and thinking a friend's 21-year-old sister was old!  But, unfortunately, it lost steam.

It also has a slightly more somber angle in that Jaime sees her best friend doing wrong, and gets sucked in because she naively believes Isabella to be perfect.  I used Isabella's bad actions to talk to my daughter about being honest, but didn't make it until the end.  I'm guessing they get in trouble, but I don't know.

I really wanted to like this movie, and my daughter did as well, but we just couldn't get through it.",1444694400,,1344,4.392712550607287

5903902,5,B00ECW9WLA,"I was getting my Sunday morning coffee while my daughter was watching this. I could hear her giggling.  I sat with her for a moment while the coffee was brewing to watch.  Two minutes later I retrieved the cup of coffee and returned to continue watching. Meet the Press on my upstairs TV could wait.  Suffice it to say, this is spectacularly funny and charming.  The entire cast was brilliant.  The main character, her wacky parents, her beautiful aunt, the sincere principal, her loyal best friend, the menacing cook in the school's cafeteria--I was continuously laughing so hard at all of them I had to make a special effort to not spill that coffee.  I ended up watching the balance of the movie. Normally I hate musicals, but the numbers here are really cute.  In one, the girl is fantasizing about fighting ninjas.  It really makes me curious as to who would have all the requisite sensibilities to do something so spot-on. This is smartly scripted and perfectly acted.  This is destined to be a classic.  As a point of comparison, I thought this might be affiliated with ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid.""  We loved that, but this actually might be better. Highly recommended by a really old grown up.",1420329600,,1196,4.647619047619048
