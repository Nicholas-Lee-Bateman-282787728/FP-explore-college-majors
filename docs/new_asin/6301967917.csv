388332,4,6301967917,"This episodic and leisurely paced crime thriller/character study was one of the last of the true ""60's"" films (even though it was released in 1973). The twist here is that the existential anti-hero isn't riding a chopper or racing across America in a Challenger to keep one step ahead of ""The Man"" but in fact IS ""The Man"" --a motorcycle cop! One-shot director James William Guercio, previously known for producing the band Chicago and creating the Caribou Records label, does an admirable job (and leaves one wondering why he didn't continue to pursue filmmaking). Robert Blake delivers his second-best ever perfomance (""In Cold Blood"" remains his highest watermark) as a highway patrolman yearning for a more glamourous (to his perception, at least) posting as a homicide detective. All the supporting actors are superb, and the expansive cinematography recalls ""Vanishing Point"" and ""Badlands"" with its sweeping vistas of the American West. A sleeper worth a look.",999216000,17,967,5.245161290322581
388333,4,6301967917,"This film is a disjointed, unfocused, cynical, at times brilliant look at the life of a motorcycle cop in Arizona. Robert Blake plays John Wintergreen, a sympathetic loner and dreamer who aspires to be a detective. The suicide of an old drifter in the desert is quickly seen by Blake as a murder and his attempts to convince his superiors to investigate is met at first with derision. Through Blake's eyes we see a country torn apart: apathetic, neurotic, berift of dreams, lonely, capable of frightening acts of violence. An examination of the mindset of the early seventies and a film that is sometimes know as the ""anti Easy Rider."" Blake has rarely been better.",995155200,17,665,4.791304347826087
388334,4,6301967917,"""Electra Glide In Blue"" is easily one of my favourite ""unknown"" films of the 1970's. This was the first (and only) movie directed by rock producer James William Guercio, and in my book it is a top class effort.

Robert Blake ( from TV's ""Baretta"" ) plays ex-Marine now Arizona motorcycle cop, John Wintergreen, desperate to trade his Harley Davidson Electra Glide police motorbike in for four wheels and join the Stockman Motors detectives division. That opportunity presents itself soon enough, when Wintergreen comes across a gunned down corpse in an dilapidated shack and the puzzle of was it just suicide, or was it murder. Blinded by the supposed granduer of the detective's role, Wintergreen becomes sorely disheartened to find out that the grass is not always greener on the other side of the hill. Exposed to bigotry, hate and injustice, his lofty opinions of his police superiors quickly crumble as he realises the brutal and impersonal nature of their personalities.

The talented and versatile cast is what makes ""Electra Glide in Blue"" really crackle....Billy Green Bush plays Wintergreen's partner ""Zipper"" Davis...an abusive and arrogant police officer who is ultimately so insecure and lonely. The talented actor Mitchell Ryan plays head of detectives Harve Poole, another bombastic and narcisstic man seething with resentment and insecurities wracking his life. Jeannine Riley is the lonely, heartbroken waitress ?Joelene""....seeking warmth and affection in the arms of the local police officers....and the wonderful character actor, Royal Dano, is the tired and irritable Coroner. Plus, I can't leave out veteran character actor, Elisha Cook Jr., as the half witted desert loner, Willy. In the early 1970's, Guercio had produced several albums for rock group ""Chicago"" and he cast several band members in minor roles in ""Electra Glide""....trumpeter Lee Loughnane is ""Pig Man"", singer/bassist Peter Cetera plays biker ""Bob Zemko"", guitarist Terry Kath is ""Killer"" ( Kath died tragically in Jan. 1978 from a gun accident ) and session musician David ""Hawk"" Wolinski as the harassed VW minibus driver.

Add to this fine cast some spectacular cinematography of the stunning Arizona landscape and a haunting and somewhat foreboding soundtrack...and you have an interesting, thought provoking and powerful film that keep's surprising you right up until the final frames.

A worthy addition to your collection of great 1970's films.....",972950400,80,2446,5.395287958115183

388449,3,6301967917,"This Blu-ray was listed as ""Multi-format"".
I'm not sure what that was supposed to mean, as it contained one Blu-ray disc.

This is not a perfect film, but it is a great character study, accompanied by gorgeous, wide, landscape shots. Robert Blake is outstanding in his role, but some of the other characters suffer from over-acting. (Pay no attention to the cheesy motorcycle hoodlums and the clich '70s-era chase.)

The transfer is very nice allowing full enjoyment of the film with few distractions.

So why am I only giving this Blu-ray 3 stars? Just two ""little"" production problems.

The first is with the dynamic range of the DTS-HD Stereo soundtrack, which is so wide that the viewer strains to comprehend much of the softer-spoken dialog, unless the volume is raised to the point that the louder scenes are irritating. This translates into a lot of volume jockeying and rewinding while viewing.

Mysteriously, unlike the DVD, there are no subtitles, which would allow the viewer to catch the more unintelligible vocals. I don't understand how this came to be, since it's a given that a Blu-ray should be superior in every way to a DVD.",1462147200,3,1143,4.871134020618556

388452,4,6301967917,"In Electra Glide in Blue, motorcycle officer John Wintergreen is just trying to do his job the best way he can. The worst of his troubles is that he's working under a crooked police force. Patrolling countless miles of open road through the desert, he's got speeders, dealers, and fiends to bust, not to mention an unruly partner to contend with. Wintergreen as portrayed by Robert Blake gives us a believable, tough, and determined character. He wants to see justice through, and come hell or high water, he'll see it through with a pistol or a hard chase.

Unlike many of today's action movies where an overdose of special effects usurp story and substance, Electra Glide in Blue contains a moderate amount of violence. The plot is full of action and suspense, but sometimes feels familiar, as if you've seen something like it before. In spite of the familiarity factor, it somehow makes it more interesting to watch knowing that this movie was based on a cop's true-life exploits. (3.5 stars)",1452297600,,995,4.818713450292398

I mean, let's face, Robert Blake is not the first name that pops into your head when you think of great actors. But his performance in this film is powerful. He plays a disillusioned motor-patrol cop in Arizona. He wants to make a move to being a homicide detective, but this only sours him that much more.

This film is filled with a number of fantastic character actors such as Elisha Cook and Mitchell Ryan. There are even cameo appearances by Terry Kath and Peter Cetera, former members of the band Chicago. This only makes sense, since James William Guercio directed this film, his only directorial outing. Guercio was also the producer for the band Chicago. Another Guercio produced band, Madura, appears in the film.

All in all, this is a movie that is well worth the watch. It was generally panned by the critics, even though Robert Blake was nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance.

A man prepares supper (a porkchop in a frying pan) and loads a shotgun. There is a shot! John exercises at home, then eats two raw eggs. He puts a revolver in his coat pocket, then straps on his service belt. His helmet and leather jacket are next. Wintergreen wants a transfer to Homicide. John gives a speeding ticket to an LAPD detective. Then a truck driver is stopped. Dont thank me. Later they stop a VW minibus and search its contents. They relax in a pool room. Later, on patrol, they see a man on foot. He babbles about Frank. John finds the body and takes notes. The Doc says suicide, its not a murder. But John suspects somethings wrong. The autopsy finds a .22 slug in the back of the head - a dead man committed suicide! The detective searches the dead mans cabin. They find hidden reds. John goes to a hippie commune and talks to a young man.

Where is Bob Zemko? Harve questions them using his own methods. Later they visit a bar after hours. There is drama from personal conflict with the waitress, Joanie. [Does their talk seem plausible?] They see motocyclists on the road, one is Bob Zemko. There is a chase for action. Riders crash. Finally Zemko is caught and questioned. Harve questions Zemko. Next we see a concert. Police keep order. John talks to Willie at night and gets an admission. [Is he sane? Suggestive?] John learns another fact about that missing money. Did Zipper slip up? [Unbelievable.] There are shots! We see scenes of Monument Valley (often used in John Fords western movies). John is back on his motorcycle again. He stops a VW minibus then lets it go. Then he goes after it again. There is dramatic action to end this film.

In 'Electra Glide In Blue', Blake is cast in the primary role of John Wintergreen, a motorcycle cop who patrols the Arizona desert and dreams of climbing up the ranks in law enforcement. As the story unfolds, John learns that things aren't so rosy at the top and those he thought he admired turn out to be nothing more than false heros.

A column article, Riding Shotgun by: Don McGregor

Electra Glide in Blue should be a severely schizophrenic movie.

The two compelling storytellers, the first time director James William Guercio and cinematographer Conrad Hall have almost bipolar extremes in what they strive to achieve artistically.

There's one of those great behind the scenes film stories concerning Electra Glide that makes one smile and also shake your head. Guercio was virtually independent in the music industry, so when Hollywood came calling, he loved movies but it wasn't his creative imperative that he had to do movies. He loved movies; he especially liked John Ford Western films like The Searchers, often filmed in the 1950s in brilliant colors in Monument Valley.

This 1970s film, ostensibly about motorcycle cops patrolling the Arizona desert territory, had a minimal budget. Guercio wanted Conrad Hall as the man to film Electra Glide. Now, this is a curious desire, because Conrad Hall's approach to filming is the antithesis to John Ford's approach. I've written about Conrad Hall in a piece on the Stoney Burke TV series from Timeless. Right from the get-go, Hall experiments, on a weekly series, with low-key lighting, in Stoney Burke. Hall even blacks out Jack Lord's face in an intense emotional sequence from one of the episodes.

Hall does that again in Electra Glide, with Robert Blake, virtually obscuring Blake's features during an especially emotional sequence with Elisha Cook, Jr.

Look at a lot of Clint Eastwood's later directing work: He must have loved Conrad Hall. Clint didn't care if all you could see was a thin lighting sculpture along his jaw-line.

Shout Factory has done an excellent job of presenting Electra Glide in Blue in Blu. The sheer blending of shades of black alone could have caused viewing problems, but this is an excellent print, and retains Hall's subtleties.

There's a lot more on the Comics Bulletin.com Riding Shotgun column.

With photos, Links, even to Johnny Carson interviewing Robert Blake.

Hope this helps any of you who have an interest in Shouts! new Blu version.

388646,5,6301967917,"A cult movie from the 70's, lives up to its status.  Brilliantly photographed by Conrad Hall (All The Presidents Men, Butch And Sundance, Tequilla Sunrise)and acted by Robert Blake, (In Cold Blood)...this action/drama takes an epoch journey across the legendary Monument Valley, and the heart and soul of a lonely, over-achieving cop.

With humor, pathos and shortness of size, Robert Blake paints an unforgettable portrait of a motorcycle cop stuck in the heat of the desert, under a sun that fries the skin and sizzles the moral code of a cop on two wheels.

Some of the acting is over-baked, but not Blake ... or the incredible photography that is as fresh today, as it was over 40 years ago!

Billy Greenbush is an unsung character actor who made memorable impressions with his role as Zipper in this movie, as well as his work with Jack Nicholson in the classic, 5 Easy Pieces.

The last DVD of Electra Glide was exceptional...the Blue-Ray should be amazing!

Now that I've just seen it on TV, I realize how blatant it actually is. Definitely ""detective murder mystery meets Easy Rider"".  Both movies have a couple of guys on bikes, riding along in the desert southwest, one of them searching for something more out of life (Peter Fonda/Robert Blake). The difference between the films is that in Easy Rider the bikes are symbols of freedom and in Electra Glide they're symbols of oppression. Robert Blake's character hates his bike and wants desperately to get off it, while Peter Fonda tries to use the bike as a way to find meaning (ultimately unsuccessfully). But in both movies, the ""searcher"" gets disillusioned and comes to a bad end.  The final scene is a complete ripoff of the final scene of Easy Rider, though it makes even less sense.  Plus the whole Monument Valley setting, pure Easy Rider.  The rest of the movie is a lot of strained soul-searching by the characters and overacting.  The music is by bands that have long, long since been forgotten, if they were ever known in the first place (Madura??). Actually, what with the director being primarily a music producer, it seems he filled the movie up with music by bands in his stable that he was trying to promote.

On the positive side, Robert Blake actually does a decent job, given the material he has to work with.",1363219200,,1510,4.6367041198501875

While the moral ambiguity in this film is timeless, it is in other ways a time capsule piece. A Neo Western that is essentially an anti-Easy Rider. Some of the acting (by the supporting cast) is, how should I say, heavy-handed, but it never approaches camp.

For serious fans of the movie, there are still a few frames missing from the end. These were reportedly cut from the U.S. theatrical release in order to get the rating down to a PG. Supposedly the original UK version was more graphic (I'm trying not to spoil anything). But this new release by Optimum, while R2, still does not include the 17 frames either. Presumably they used the US master?

In any case it's a great DVD: Beautiful transfer, great soundtrack, and a career performance by Robert Blake.

The biggest question of course is why Jim Guercio never directed another film. Unfortunately he doesn't really address this on either the Introduction or in the Director's commentary.

It's almost like a euro art movie, even Fellini-esque, except I don't think that was the intent. Are you reading this review to make a purchase/rent decision or to validate your opinion of the movie? Hmm. If you like ""normal"" movies and just want a good normal movie to entertain you, then skip this one. Too weird.

Picture quality is excellent except for some occasional sprinkles in the middle.  Great movie, waited for a blu-ray release, and despite the high price I am satisfied with it, at least until something better comes along.  The widescreen hi-def picture really brings out the beauty of the desert in the outdoor vista scenes.  Another scene is in the beginning when John sneaks up on Zipper with his magnum, you can make out the lettering on the gun barrel, try that with VHS tape or a standard DVD.  The colors are vibrant, no apparent fading.  The sound is great, didn't notice any defects.  Love the music, bought the soundtrack separately on CD.  What can I say about this movie except that if you saw this in your youth, it must of made quite an impression for you to try to find it again.  Motorcycles, good and bad cops, hippies, bike chases, great acting by most of the stars, and iconic 70's jazz/rock music that make this a very enjoyable film.  Guercio in his intro talks a little about the making of this movie and what he had to do to keep it under budget.  Maybe in retrospect it was a labor of love for him to put up with all the constraints and to persevere and try to create an important American film (his words).

This film has several things going for it: some gorgeous tracking shots of the desert scenery, good noirish dialogue, and two great performances from Robert Blake and Billy Ray Bush.

This was a special breed of film: low budget but every penny shows up on the screen, shot on time and on schedule, with B list actors who deliver A-list performances. Similar movies: the Billy Jack series, JOE (starring the late, great Peter Boyle), Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry; and Sam Peckinpah's character study, Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.

Best scene is a tie: the first is when Robert Blake's character, standing at the bar, watches as the girl approaches him (pure, unadulterated sexual heat)and second is the masterful final shot, slow and lingering which you likely won't forget.

388669,4,6301967917,"Electra Glide in Blue is my favorite of the early-1970s, existential ""highway movies."" It has a plot, so it's better than Two-Lane Blacktop. Also, it seems less dated than Easy Rider. Electra Glide is a look into America's dark heart that is wrapped inside a murder mystery.

Robert Blake plays an Arizona motorcycle cop named John Wintergreen. People mock Wintergreen as ""Big John"" and ""Little Chief"" due to his small size. Wintergreen desperately wants to prove himself worthy of moving out of writing traffic tickets and into investigating homicides.

Wintergreen's ""big chance"" comes when he finds a ""bum"" dead inside a desert shack Everyone else is convinced that the death is a suicide, but Wintergreen knows better. Investigating the murder provides Wintergreen with the chance he craves. The murder mystery, however, is just a subplot. The film's true purpose is examining American culture and values. If Electra Glide sounds like a strange film, it should.

The cast is excellent. Before Blake became notorious in the Bonnie Bakley case, he was a first-rate actor. Billy ""Green"" Bush (as Blake's dumb partner, Zipper) and Mitch Ryan (as the tough homicide cop, Harve) are also excellent. I particularly liked Jeannine Riley (of ""Harper Valley PTA""-fame) as Jolene, an angst-filled honky-tonk waitress.

There are some ""added rewards"" for watching Electra Glide. The cinematography is gorgeous; the blue skies and washed-out colors of the American desert make a great backdrop. The 1970s cars, hair, and clothes also catch the viewer's eyes.

It's not a crisp thriller; not an action movie; and not very interesting at all. My girlfriend happened to catch the ending on TV and told me about it. Now, if you see a dramatic ending like that it makes you wonder what events could have led up to such a turn of events. We both were very curious and I almost bought this movie. I AM REALLY GLAD I DIDN'T after I caught it on TV.

It has one heck of a beginning that really sparks your imagination as you wonder if what you just saw was a suicide? A murder? Who was there? Why? And as mentioned, a quick and shocking ending that brings things to a screeching halt. The problem is that everything in between is pure garbage that just bores the life out of you.

So this guy wants to be a detective: why should I care? So he stumbles across the dead body and turns out to be too much of a sissy by-the-book dork to be a real case cracking detective: so he's a looser too! Why should I care about a looser? I just want to know how the dead guy was killed and why. I never got the answer, really.

Oh, and as far as the tittle: ""Electra Glide in Blue""? Why the emphasis on a motorcycle? Motorcycles have no significance in this movie. You could have named it ""Corolla in Blue"" or ""BMW in Pink"" and it would have made no difference. What a looser movie!!!",1248480000,3,1324,4.104247104247104

The acting, (while largely cheesy) is enjoyable in a pic like this.  I do enjoy Robert Blake's performance though, even though Detective Harvey is WAAAY over the top!!  (the coroner guy was very good also). I definitely see a link to ""Easy Rider"", and indeed, both films represent a (then) new wave of modern western, even maybe similar in some ways to Peckinpah's ""Wild Bunch"" and ""Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia"". Actually, as powerful a film as Easy Rider is, I don't think it's a very good film either. But like Elecra Glide, it does invoke that new ""take to the highway"" consciousness of the counterculture of the early 70's.  And as in Easy Rider, the cinematography in Electra Glide is fantastic!  The amazing Conrad Hall (the original Outer Limits, and tons of other shows and movies), shows Arizona in all its beautiful glory, this film really looks great!!  And it is such fun to see late guitar great Terry Kath and former bassist Peter Cetera from the group Chicago, after all, this was a James William Guercio film).

Part of the reason this film did so poorly in 1973 was the advertising posters and soundtrack record cover, which showed Robert Blake in uniform next to other men clearly a foot taller and the movie quote ""Did you know me and Alan Ladd are the same height?"", which led many to think this was a comedy.

It also produced alot of self-indulgent claptrap.  Unfortunately, ""Electra Glide in Blue"" falls more in the latter category than the former.  Director James William Guercio would like to invoke comparisons to John Ford(hence, the Monument Valley locales) and ""Easy Rider"".  Instead his film seems like a wacky episode of ""CHiPs"".  I have nothing against a filmmaker who tries to pace his film deliberately.  Guercio's direction, however, feels hamhanded and labored.  Not that he's helped by a script that contains any number of preposterous scenes.  One that comes to my mind is the long one involving a barmaid (Jeannine Riley) who dresses down a detective(Mitchell Ryan) for his inadequacies.  The film is redeemed by some terrific acting by Robert Blake as the highway patrolman who has big dreams that are undermined by his integrity, Billy ""Green"" Bush as a fellow patrolman who isn't working with a full deck, Elisha Cook as a mentally challenged man, and Royal Dano as the Coroner.

388747,3,6301967917,"I have to agree with all the other reviews about this film. It was and remains to this day to be my favorite film of all time. I saw it the first time in 1973 during it's first run in the theater when I was 10 years old and now I'm happily employed in law enforcement because of it (kinda the way TOP GUN inspired many to join the military). I've been waiting since that time for a chalk full of commentary DVD to get released.

For some reason, they ignored this movie until Robert Blake (a damn good actor, I might add) got into all this stuff with B. Blakeley. When I finally heard it would be released on DVD, I wasn't surprised. Why wouldn't a distributor capitolize on the whole murder mess. What did I care? I was finally going to get my DVD. When I first saw the DVD cover on amazon, the blatant capitolization on the murder trial was hard to ignore. The tagline read ""He's taking justice into his own hands"". What the hell was this? As a fan of this film and all it's memorabilia, this tagline never existed. In fact, it had more to do with Roberts court dealings than with the movie. THAT WAS WRONG!! But...moving on.

I went out the day of it's release and purchased it. The first thing I viewed was one of it's original previews, part of the special features. That was cool. Another very cool item was the intro to the movie (option) by James Guercio, the director. That was also nice and set the precedent for what was coming. Or.....did it? James fell into the rut that most directors do when they record their commentary. He's gets lost watching his own film and either stays silent for long periods of time or, when he finally snaps to, he states the obvious, basically explaining the scene that you're viewing. What's the point? You're viewing the scene!! The scene shows a bar with pictures and posters all around of Jeannine Riley. You don't need the director saying ""In this scene, there are posters all around of Jeannine Riley"" 5 times.

I don't mean to be hard on Mr. Guercio. It's just that I've waited 32 years for certain shots and scenes to be elaborated on, but wasn't satisfied with his commentary.  He did reveal some things, but fell way short of a commentary that stands up to, let's say Gary Marshall on the Pretty Woman DVD or Cameron Crowe. They should require directors to take DVD commentary 101 before allowing them to mess up the commentary track for all time.  I mean, they're spending time doing it so why not try and do it right.  We deserve that much.  With that said, I'm still glad to have it and thankful for the insights he did bring to this classic film.

P.S. - He also never explained why the movie came back to the theater the following year under the title ""Big John and Zipper"". I would have loved to know the back story on that.",1111881600,10,2782,4.367504835589942

I have seen this movie and I believe it is the best thing that Robert Blake ever did. Good preformances all around. Too Violent for small kids. Leonard Maltin gives it a 3 out of 4 Stars.

388750,4,6301967917,"is the film's best line, rattled off by Robert Blake with dead seriousness.  But did Alan Ladd ever mount a Harley in the Arizona dessert?  Blake does in what is undeniably a lost small classic.  ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE was unique for it's time:  it's a police story with a brain, foregoing the more popular chase and gunfight romps that filled the celluloid landscape in the early 1970's.  It also takes place in the AZ dessert, so it's nice seeing some landscape not cluttered in concrete.  Billy Green Bush and Mitchell Ryan give Blake the back-up he deserves and Jeannie Riley almost steals the film with her truth in booze revelation to Ryan (Blake getting dressed to The Marcels ""Most Of All"" is a close second).  Another gem that needs to get to DVD.",1099872000,4,755,4.58955223880597
388751,5,6301967917,"This film is a must for your collection for three reasons:
1. The best cop film ever made.
2. One of the best films in American cinematic history.
3. It shows Robert Blake as one of the true great actors.
Before I get down to details, a complaint. When is this movie going to be available on widescreen DVD format? I bought the video and anxiously await the DVD release.
In 1973 Electra Glide In Blue was released to a big yawn. It has since become an American cult classic. If I told you where the interesting title comes from, I'd be giving away a major plot point.
Robert Blake plays a small-town desert motorcycle cop with dreams of grandeur. He seemingly gets his wish when he's promoted to detective and becomes involved in a homicide investigation. The investigation centers around a hippie commune where Blake identifies more with the hippies than with his fellow officers.
There are three truly great American actors: Marlon Brando, James Dean and Robert Blake. Electra Glide In Blue shows Robert Blake at his very best. And that's the name of that tune.",1078358400,10,1063,4.659574468085107
388752,5,6301967917,"Aaahhhh ... the memories this brings back! I have always wondered why this movie died away instead of being hailed as a classic. It has only been since Robert Blake's trouble with ""that thang he married"" that this movie has gotten back into the public's eye.
I remember standing in a block-long line to get into our tiny theatre to see this one. I didn't get in the first night and had to go back the next night. It was so worth the wait! I would stand in line again to watch it today ... if I didn't already own it on VHS.
I loved the character Willie, the crazy old desert rat. But Robert blake was just out of sight with this performance. It was his best ... without competition. He just really got into this role to the max.
The ending is haunting! It has stayed with me all these years. Each time I watch it, I get chills. If you have not seen this movie, order a copy today.
I really believe this movie holds a special place in every motorcycle rider's heart. Most 'Nam vets that I know can tell you all about this movie. Obviously it touched a special spot with them too.
Get it today and join our cult following of this forgotten classic.",1054339200,14,1146,4.213636363636364
388753,3,6301967917,"Robert Blake as ""Big John"" Wintergreen is the important part of this film.
Not to say that the motorcycle chase setpiece isn't worth watching.
Not that the end of the film isn't ironic and powerful.
But Bobby Blake simply *owns* this film.
As Arizona motorcycle patrolman John Wintergreen, Blake gives  an excellent portrayal of a man who remains idealisticdespite the cynicism that his job normally engenders.
As other reviewers have mentioned, this film forms an almost certainly unintended (and somewhat tenuous, but nonetheless real) stylistic trilogy with ""Easy Rider"" and ""Vanishing Point"", examining issues and aspects of the counterculture of the 70s through the lens of America's addiction to gasoline.
Of particular ironic (and iconic) interest to myself and other Viet Nam veterans is the scene betwen Big John and the truck driver...
And the poignance of the ending is unquestionable, reflecting the cynical view that ""No good deed goes unpunished.""

Time will be good to you. As these reviews for this one movie shows in a small way. Yes Hollywood doesn't seem to want to give you another shot. In the grand picture it doesn't matter! You ARE GREAT! And nothin and no one will ever be able to take that away!! EVER!! This is a great movie. And if the general public reads his book Tales Of A Rascal, you will really appreciate this movie SOOOO much more. There is a whole section in the book on this movie that sets the record straight.
