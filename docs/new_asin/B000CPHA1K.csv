8100074,4,B000CPHA1K,"I had purchased this dvd to complete my collection of this series. This anime is a typical themed one loosely based around 1 guy and a bunch of gals who want his ""genetics"". It is a great comedy especially with all the different type of situations he gets into. The only thing I didn't like was the fact he was a ""ghost"" about 4 DVD worth of the collection. It was funny in the situations he got into despite being a ghost but I think it would've been more entertaining if he had a physical body. Overall, great anime and definitely one to add to one's OLDER collection.",1365379200,,570,4.287037037037037
8100075,4,B000CPHA1K,"Kazuki is wizard, but he can only use his magic 8 times before it kills him. Some of the most powerful magic families in the country find out about his dormant power and send their daughters to get his genes. That's pretty much the story.

This anime isn't very deep, but it's got some really neat characters and good animation. The soundtrack is all right too. Even though the story is pretty regular there are a few touching moments, it also delivers plenty of comedy too. I'm not gonna lie and say it's one of the best animes I've seen; but I'm glad I did see it. It's pretty enjoyable. Maybe check it out on youtube or netflix to see what you think.",1354147200,,653,4.308943089430894
8100076,3,B000CPHA1K,"This is the last DvD, buy the first one if you're interested in a world where magic is real and the costs of using it is your LIFE!",1262131200,,131,3.7142857142857144
8100077,5,B000CPHA1K,"Well, to begin with a few words about the storyline (Just keep in mind that the storyline refers to the entire series and therefore SPOILERS will be included!!!)

If you are looking for Mechas like FMP or Evangelion, a deep emotional like Mirage of Blaze or The Last Exile and so many others, than you should skip this one.

If one the other hand, you are looking for something like Oh! My Goddess, a harem anime, romantic and action comedy etc. than you are definitely in the right place.

The story unfolds in a world similar to the ones we already know with the difference that many people are able to use magic and werewolves, ghosts and so forth is something that people are accustomed with. The place: A High-School that consists of students that are able to use magic. The catch: Each student has a specific number of times that can use his or her magic and if used up than will turn into dust (basically, die).

The story resolves around our main protagonist, Kazuki, who is the typical looser guy (at least at the beginning, as it usually happens to the harem animes) but is the descendant of the most powerful magicians, meaning that his son will become the strongest magician ever; but has two main `problems': 1. Can use his magic only 8 times (which proofs to be super strong) and b. all females of the high-school will try to get his genes which will create the entire comedy!

Then we have the other three main female protagonists: Yuuna, who claims that she is his wife and lives together with him, Rin who is a samurai girls (and at the beginning would prefer to kill him) and Kuriki, the super hottie and super rich girl who would like to seduce him.

Apart from it, the story will mainly resolve around these four protagonists, the relationships they will create, the adventures they will encounter (they will have to deal against a ghost-hunter when Kazuki will turn into a ghost for a while) and of course what choice Kazuki will make...In addition, you will be introduced to various other characters who will influence the outcome of the story as well.

Last but not least, Kazuki has a good heart and will try to help the others in his own expense and everything will depend on a promise he made when he was very young (or should I sea, two promises ;-) ).

As for the animation: It is good, compare it to the one of Oh! My Goddess and you will have a very good picture.

The music is good, starts with a nice pop/rock song and ends with a ballad.

The dub, is good done as well; but to be honest as well, I have seen better dubs as well but still it is a good one.

As for the extras, it has the typical stuff: Not credit opening/ending, trailers etc.

As for the storyline: It is very good, has a good character development, solid and has a few twists in it (but we also should keep in mind that we compare it for its genre as it is).

To the most `interesting' question: Buying it or not? To begin with, the price is the typical one that you most probably will find out there, therefore, having watched the entire series I can recommend the shows so that you can have a different and funny magic/romantic/comedy in your collection.

I hope that I could help you with this review :-)",1156896000,3,3208,4.39695945945946
