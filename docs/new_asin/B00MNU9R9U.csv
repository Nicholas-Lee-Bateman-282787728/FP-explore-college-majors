8673356,5,B00MNU9R9U,"Since disbanding the renowned Beaux Arts trio after 50 years of international renown, Menahem Pressler has embarked on a return to his original solo concert career - this at the sprightly age of 90. This burst of activity has seen his dbut performances with the BPO, the Concertgebouw and the Mariinsky orchestras. This disc originates from two concerts in 2012 and 2014 with a concerto and an encore from each.

The over-riding impression, that is impossible to ignore throughput this disc, is the sensation and communication of absolute delight generated by Pressler and which is shared by conductor, orchestral players and, finally, evident in the warmth of the enthusiastic audience applause.

Throughout the concerts Pressler, unusually for soloists these days, has the piano part open in front of him, the exception being the Debussy encore. It is nevertheless clear from his playing that this is no more than a prop that is mostly ignored and is probably a habit retained from the need to have the trio parts open to be read in the days of the Beaux Arts Trio.

Pressler formed the Beaux Arts Trio initially from a desire to record chamber works of Mozart. That love of Mozart's music is readily apparent here and there is an unusual degree of relaxed ease with the essence of the compositions that makes descriptions such as `authoritative' or `perceptive' both meaningless and misleading such is the apparent symbiosis between soloist and composer. This depth of identification is in turn clearly shared with and between all the players and conductor and expressions of absolute delight and relaxed joy of music making are readily picked up and illustrated by the camera crew.

The disc concludes with a wonderful performance of Debussy's Clair de Lune which seems the perfect ending to a particularly wonderful 82 minutes as recorded.

The recording itself is an object lesson in now to cover such an event with involving but non-invasive camera work which allows for ease rather than hyper-activity. The imaging quality is crisp and notably realistic. The sound is deeply satisfying and offered in DTS 5.1 and stereo options.

There is a brief but illuminating 13 minute `conversation' with Menahem Pressler with Paavo Jarvi which ranges over Pressler's responses to the two concertos in particular and other Mozart concertos in general. It also explores Pressler's journey through life to this point and his motivations. What comes over most strongly though, apart from his obvious deep love for music making, is his considerable humility.

This then is a disc from Pressler's Indian Summer that simply glows with delight at every point and deserves serious consideration from collectors regardless of alternative recordings already collected. Newcomers need not hesitate.",1412035200,8,2784,5.187082405345212
