5008922,5,B006O94DP4,I got this for my almost 3 year old and she absolutely loves it! I would definitely recommend it.  The DVD is reasonably priced and certainly beats having to keep using on demand shows!,1357603200,,185,4.4411764705882355
5008923,5,B006O94DP4,"Since Caillou isn't on 24/7, we love that there is a new DVD out that has some of his favorites on there... One of my favorites is the one where Grandma sets up all sorts of activities for Caillou and his friends to compete in the backyard for different ribbons.  Why is this one of my favorites?  Well, Clementine comes over and has on a ribbon that she just won and then Leo starts talking about how he won a ribbon before too.... Caillou was upset that he had no ribbon to talk about.. Instead of Grandma just giving him a ribbon, she sets up fun events for the kids (Rosie and Gilbert get in on the action too!) to try and win ribbons.. At one point, Caillou is upset and his mom talks to him.. Then, he realizes it is about having fun, not always winning.  I love the Caillou episodes because it shows how creative little kids can be... Caillou has a very creative imagination and I love seeing it portrayed in each episode!

5008924,1,B006O94DP4,I ordered this without looking at the breakdown of scenes. I was surprised that a new release was completely without a single new episode. This is just a re-hash of other episodes. My son lost interest immediately. What a waste of time.,1332374400,2,236,4.642857142857143

5008940,1,B006O94DP4,"Until now, I've never had a single complaint about my near-perfect three year old. From sleeping through the night at 6 weeks of, giving up bottles and his crib and moving to his own room - even taking baths and going to bed every night without a single complaint and potty training and reading on his own at 2.

UNTIL CAILLOU.  And I'm not joking. This isn't a joke review. This is a serious complaint.

That obnoxious little brat, Caillou, in just two episodes, has my son WHINING ""I can't!!"" to EVERYTHING he is asked to do. ""Time to get out of the tub, sweetie,"" I tell him. ""I caaaaaaannnn't."" He whines in this horrible squeal. I had NO IDEA where this abhorrent behavior came from until I caught THREE SECONDS of this horrible show on tv.

My won was watching intently and I said ""turn the tv off please."" And to my horror, he dropped to the floor, and started whining over and over ""I can't!  I can't"".

I wanted to throw up.  No shock- this horrible excuse for a television show has been PERMANENTLY banned from our home. I will tell every parent I know of this god -awful excuse for an ""educational program"".

My son has caught glimpses of sponge bob (crude), power rangers (physical fighting) and even half an hour of gremlins (not in my presence, but I found out he saw the most gruesome parts) and had ZERO reaction to these things - he didn't karate chop our house cats, or imitate any of the crude humor on sponge bob....but in a mere TWO MINUTES of ""CAILLOU"" my son immediately picked up that petulant little Bart's HORRIBLE incessant whine and his ""I can't"" crap that he spews every time he is asked or told to do ANYTHING.

BY FAR the worst children's show I've ever seen.  PBS should be paying for a professional to help me fix this behavior (and a trip to the spa to relax my nerves after listening to the whining I'd never had to deal with before ""CAILLOU"". Flat out AWFUL.
