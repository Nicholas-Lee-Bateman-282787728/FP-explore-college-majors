5834010,1,B00DMOVIRK,"I cannot believe that I paid money to rent this horrible movie.  It has nothing to do with the Hitchcock Bates Motel/Anthony Perkins, as the picture leads one to believe, in fact, the picture of the house is never seen in this movie. A total rip off pile of junk that has bad acting, bad special effects, and no story to speak of.  What an insult to the late great Anthony Perkins and Sir Alfred Hitchcock.",1378684800,4,406,4.328947368421052
5834011,1,B00DMOVIRK,"Who ever did this film knows nothing about making films.
Have never seen such horridly un-scary, bad acted crappola.
Wasted my money on renting this ... something that should never have been green-lit.
And all due to the title that it seemingly ripped off from the BEST horror film of all time, Psycho.",1377993600,5,302,4.716981132075472
5834012,1,B00DMOVIRK,This was a complete waste of time and film. Corny from the get go. It was obviously made just for the fun of seeing how awful everyone could act.,1377561600,,145,4.0344827586206895
5834013,2,B00DMOVIRK,"The film opens a bit confusing as it appears to be a trailer for itself. This picture has nothing to do with the infamous Bates Motel, other than the name. A family operates a haunted hayride/farm in Gradyville, Pa. Agnes (Jean Louise O'Sullivan) witnesses her best friend Lillie (Aleksandra Svetlichnaya) die. Agnes' life has gone down hill. Her policeman dad (Robert Haag) and by far the worse actor in this film, forces Agnes to work at that same haunted Bates farm as therapy.

Soon everyone around her is being murdered. The film operates as a who-dun-it for the first hour with the formula cat and mouse ending.

The role of Robert Haag as a policeman was indeed a downer. The film did create some unique characters such as Wayne (Matthew Mastronardi) a masked gay chainsaw killer. This has some similarities to 80's style slasher films, but lacks style.

Works as a low end rental at best.

5834014,2,B00DMOVIRK,I thought it was something continuing with BATES. The whole plot was crazy and the acting was horrible. The only funny part about all of this was the actual acting! SORRY!,1377561600,,171,4.548387096774194
5834015,1,B00DMOVIRK,"Not that I don't enjoy a good B horror movie from time to time. This one was an F. Norman Bates would have killed himself with the knife instead of Janet Leigh, had he seen this one. Which always makes me wonder how junk like this gets made.

5834016,5,B00DMOVIRK,"I don't care what anyone says, getting killed by a harvesting combine is scary!

This movie is definitely worth the time if you are a fan of fun, campy horror movies.  And I hear the haunted hayride featured in the movie actually exists which adds to the thrill factor for this upcoming Halloween season.

I hope there's an even bigger budget for blood if a sequel gets made.  I'm hoping for a crop duster propeller in a corn field maze chase killing.  That would be sequel worthy in a heartbeat.",1376956800,6,496,4.466666666666667

5834018,5,B00DMOVIRK,"I'm a lifelong horror fan, and there's a lot out there, especially streaming, that you can be spending your time watching.  A lot of it is pretty horrible.  I can assure you this one is not as horrible as those movies, and is a good time.

Don't go into this wanting to take everything seriously.  The Bates Haunting has more of a tone like the Hatchet movies - old school styled horror, can laugh at itself, and hits the ground running so you're never bored watching it.  Kind of like Hobo with a Shotgun but not all ""LOOK AT ME!!!"" about everything.

What's worse than a boring horror movie?  Nothing.  Even that, that you're thinking right now as you're reading it.  Trust me, I've seen a lot of boring horror movies.

I can go on and on about The Bates Haunting and why you should watch it, and in turn, bore you out of watching it.  I'm not gonna do that!  I can boil everything down into one line that will make or break you wanting to watch:

TWO PEOPLE GET EATEN BY A COMBINE HARVESTER.

If you can't appreciate that, what are you doing reading reviews about horror movies?  Go play POGs with the neighbor kids or something instead.  They still make those, right?",1376352000,9,1171,4.376744186046512

5834045,3,B00DMOVIRK,"The Most remarkable thing about this movie is that it was filmed at a theme park called the Bates Motel and Haunted Hayride and apparently a good many of the Bates family who run the place were featured in the film.  In fact, the entire film capitalizes on the Bates name hut nothing else, though there's one nearly missed spot where one of the ""actors"" at the Hayride is supposedly a knife-wielding woman threatening two young women to ""stay away from my Norman."" That's the only other reference to the original story. Other than that, it's the usual slasher film or less, generally less. I suppose if one wanted to commit multiple murders, the best place to do it would be at a house of horror or a slasher theme park so that premise definitely works.

As is usual in these films, no real motive is given for the original killing or those that follow and the ending...there really isn't one. It just...stops.  The heroine may be attempting to escape and/or discover the killer but she stumbles along from body to body.  When seeing a murder in progress, she  screams to others who believe it's part of the show. Though they ""restrain"" her, their grips are so light she could've broken away and gone to the victim's aid, yet she simply stands there and watches.  The one bright moment is her surprise and shock when she accidentally kills one of her attackers, not once but twice.  Of course, the farm is in a ""Dead Zone"" where cell phones don't work and there are no landlines.  Really? A business with no way of communication?  Perhaps Verizon should know how many dead spots there are in America.

Some of the acting was passable, namely the actor playing ""Clyde."" However, this DVD is in the ""Had I But Known"" category...Had I But Known how the film was going to go, I wouldn't have wasted my time ordering it.  Frankly, the blurb was better than the movie.",1426723200,,1862,4.561561561561562

5834064,1,B00DMOVIRK,"If you, like the Peripatetic Reader, rented this movie thinking it had some connection to Psycho, you were wrong!

The only resemblance this movie has with Psycho is a fleeting mention that the ranch in this movie is called the Bates Ranch, and a brief, momentary, glimpse of an actor dressed up as Norman Bates mother. It seems the producers of this horrible movie were concerned about copyright infringement and wanted to make full use of the fair use doctrine. But no, theres another resemblance  both movies are in celluloid. The resemblance ends there, however, because Psycho was a good movie, a classic, and this is just a bad movie.

The acting is bad. The actors read their lines like they are reciting a high school play. The script is bad. The script is the standard slasher who-gets-killed-next-and-how nonsense.  The script doesnt make any sense. The characters are bad, cardboard caricatures. The dialogue is corny, the acting is stilted, the direction is bad. The entire concept of this movie is bad. Bad, bad, bad.

One star is too high a rating for this movie. This movie is not worth the $1.20 rental from Redbox.

This movie, if it is remembered at all, will be remembered as the movie that rivals Plan 9 From Outer Space in badness.  But Plan 9 From Outer Space was so bad it was good. This movie is just bad.",1386979200,2,1329,4.653846153846154

5834068,5,B00DMOVIRK,"'The Bates Haunting' is a fun bloody romp that will satisfy people who love Halloween hayrides and slasher films. Jean Louise O'Sullivan stars as Agnes Rickover, a girl who struggles to come to terms with her friends untimely death and untangle a string of murders. Most of the story takes place at the Bates Motel and Haunted Hayride in Gradyville PA. The haunted house and hayride look really cool. The Bates Motel is considered on of the best haunted houses in the country. If you love haunted houses and can't make it to PA I would recommend seeing this movie, it features a lot of the haunted hayride scenes and actors. The Bates Haunting isn't the best movie I have ever seen, but has one of the most hilarious insane sex/death scenes in any horror movie. I'd say it's worth watching just for that. Definitely laughed out loud a bunch of times especially during the scene featuring Ryan Dunn.
