4858077,4,B005QBDJ3S,"If you can suspend your disbelief and you like Ginger Rogers, this one is a winner.  Not sure what kind of copy you are getting here as most I've seen are TV copies, so I can not judge the quality.  As for the film, Ginger is great as the woman thrown into a bizarre situation as she is in another great comedy, Bachelor Mother.  Here her beau is Cornel Wilde who gets an unusual double role but actually plays it pretty well.  The supporting cast is pretty good but mostly have smaller roles here.  The leads carry the day and provided you are not without imagination, you should enjoy this one very much.  I don't like to give many spoilers or story lines, the description of the film as listed tells enough.",1345939200,4,710,4.340909090909091

4858081,4,B005QBDJ3S,"The first time I watched this movie, I fell asleep during a section but I liked it so much I decided to keep it until I could watch it again.  Big mistake because I would have given it five stars the first time, and I didn't understand the word ""raunchy"" initially.  When I watched it the second time, I didn't fall asleep and definitely caught the ""raunchy"" parts, which were indeed what one would call ""raunchy"".  Not my cup of tea to have the raunchy parts included, and in my personal opinion, the movie was better when that was the part I missed.  Could easily have been omitted, but it wasn't, so down to a 4 star it went. The actors were good and I REALLY liked the movie the first time, but the section when she was in Paris was a little ""raunchy"" as indicated.",1485734400,2,769,4.2465753424657535

4858084,5,B005QBDJ3S,"I watch almost no romantic comedies, much less seek them out. Take that into consideration... However, as someone who already liked Dan Soder and Cristin Milioti beforehand, this was a no-brainer to check out. Milioti is charming and cute as always, and Soder also came through as a and solid and likable actor. That being said, I hope Soder still continues pursuing being a great stand up, because his comedy is great and that's how I became aware of him. But I digress - this was a hard movie to track down and it was worth the watch.",1483747200,3,536,4.479591836734694

4858088,1,B005QBDJ3S,"Felt like both leads were weak and really didn't enjoy the female lead's personality or even her style at all. Made it hard to enjoy the story line, which also dragged on quite a lot. Not worth the rental fee, imo.",1482019200,2,214,4.2439024390243905
4858089,4,B005QBDJ3S,"It's just an easy movie to enjoy. Nothing is complicated except Sonia's whirlwind of emotions about getting married. Her journey, shown to us through flashbacks with witty narration, carries us into and through her present situation with her boyfriend and his proposal of marriage. Cristin Milioti is a delight in this, as she is in all her work, making the character of Sonia a very enjoyable person to watch and one for whom you feel a lot as she sorts through her life in a fairly short amount of time.",1481846400,2,505,4.622222222222222

4858092,5,B005QBDJ3S,"The story was basic, but it was told in a witty, original way. I loved the characters. They were so unique. And we laughed out loud numerous times. At the end, even my husband said, ""That was a GREAT movie!"" Impressive, considering its absence of machine guns.",1480723200,2,260,4.553191489361702

Leads had good chemistry, but I don't think the ending was very reaslis...  Hold on, wait, I have been told in fact it is very realistic!  (Right honey?)",1480118400,10,272,4.469387755102041
4858099,5,B005QBDJ3S,"Sharply written and sneaky good. Reminded me of the golden age of rom-com, even had a little Billy Wilder in it. One of the better films I saw all year.",1479859200,,152,4.1

4858102,5,B005QBDJ3S,"This is certainly not a movie with Ginger Rogers. This is a laugh-out-loud, contemporary twist on the typical rom-com plot. It's so great to see a woman play the role of the uncertain, commitment-phobe. And yet somehow she is adorable and lovable. Great acting, great writing, and great music. The scenes in Italy will have you crying from laughter. I have seen this movie four times already, and it just keeps getting better. Thank you to the writers/directors for returning the rom-com to its former glory. Enjoy!",1479772800,5,515,4.931034482758621

4858104,5,B005QBDJ3S,"Oh I love Ginger Rogers movies. This is a very classic comedy about Ginger Rogers trying to make up her mind on who to marry.
She is true to herself in this film. The quality of the movie was also very good. There are several stars in this movie with her including Spring Bryington who I love. The movie finally came available after several years at Amazon and it was delivered very quickly within the time frame they gave when placing the order. Great movie as well as some of her others, Lucky Partners, The Major and the Minor, RoxieHart, 5th Avenue Girl, Romance Rafters to name a few. I have purchased several movies from Amazon and all the movies have been great quality. I also have a lot of Debbie Reynolds, Doris Day and Bette Davis movies.",1402099200,2,749,4.434782608695652
4858105,5,B005QBDJ3S,"Great classic film. It's like a Yankee fan watching Lou Gehrig.

The acting in that film is pretty advanced for its time. Ginger Rogers may have raised the bar in that film.",1383264000,2,173,4.40625
4858106,5,B005QBDJ3S,"I had pretty much given up on finding a copy of this 1947 movie when lo and behold, up it popped on Amazon.  Customer service was excellent as was the quality of the DVD.  Although the movie admittedly is dated, upon seeing it again, I understood why I had enjoyed it so much the first time.  A great trip down memory lane.",1349481600,6,323,4.17741935483871
8483038,4,B005QBDJ3S,"Cute, worth watching. I'm a sucker for romance comedies, and I found this one to be enjoyable. A bit raunchy so it's an adult comedy.

The DVD did not have subtitles though.",1515110400,,173,4.40625

8483040,4,B005QBDJ3S,I really liked this movie about a girl who's not sure about getting married. It was funny and entertaining .... and I didn't fall asleep like I do so many times when watching movies! LOL,1504569600,,186,4.3428571428571425
8483041,4,B005QBDJ3S,"A romantic comedy about a role reversal; Sonia is an incredibly irritating woman who plays a commitment phobe for no apparent reason  to her boyfriend Chris' steadfast devotion and desire to marry.  Sonia is physically an elfin type who spends most of the movie batting her big brown eyes. I didn't find her adorable in the least, just, as I already stated, petty and incredibly irritating.  Chris's love for Sonia is really Inexplicable.  The movie is one big stereotype, and Sonia and Chris's friends are almost as irritating as they are.  A waste of time.",1503187200,,558,4.831578947368421
8483042,5,B005QBDJ3S,Cristin Milioti is great in this.  A great rom com for the millennial generation.,1499385600,,81,4.785714285714286
8483043,5,B005QBDJ3S,a very sweet movie - chick flick so watched when hubby was sleeping,1498348800,2,67,4.230769230769231
8483044,3,B005QBDJ3S,"nothing really outstanding or memorable here, good for a one time watch but that's about it.",1498176000,,92,4.8125
8483045,5,B005QBDJ3S,"Cute romance comedy, Cristin Milioti definitely carries the film as the quirky-yet-lovable lead role.  From the trailer, you can gather that the premise is that Milioti's character is a young woman whose boyfriend has just proposed, leading her to confront her ambivalent feelings about the idea of marriage. It's a movie that could fall flat if the characters aren't well played, but Milioti is quirky and relatable enough to make the whole thing work (sort of Zooey Deschanel in the ""New Girl"" but to a more realistic, toned down level).  Dan Soder is the boyfriend who just wants to settle down with his sweetheart.  The film is nice in the way that both character's wishes are evenly portrayed, and neither character is portrayed as being ""at fault"" for the whole thing, they're just two people trying to figure their lives out.",1495929600,,832,4.886524822695035
8483046,3,B005QBDJ3S,"Pretty predictable, but entertaining nonetheless.",1492992000,,49,9.0
8483047,5,B005QBDJ3S,"It's so hard to find a great romance movie nowadays, and If you're into the romance genre you've probably already seen all the great ones. It Had to be You is one of the great ones in what seems to be an endless sea of cheesy flat out bad romance movies. This is a must watch",1491091200,,275,3.9285714285714284
