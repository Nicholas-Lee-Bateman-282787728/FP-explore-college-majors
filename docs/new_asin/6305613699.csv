7892871,1,6305613699,"The movie is a 5 star, so why did I give it 1 star you ask? Read on please. I saw part of this movie on television years ago and fell in love with it. I surely would love to purchase it but not at the outrageous price listed above and certainly not on a vsh tape. Why oh Why is the movie not on dvd? Maybe the better question is when will Amazon release the movie on dvd?",1353283200,9,371,3.7088607594936707
