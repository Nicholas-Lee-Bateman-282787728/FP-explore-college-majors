2643912,5,B000HWZ4R0,"Don't you all remeber watching the DuckTales, back in the day. I still do. I love old school. I got them for my sis. She loved it.",1169164800,,130,3.8518518518518516
2643913,5,B000HWZ4R0,This volume brought back memories of Disney Afternoon - which my brothers and I watched almost everyday after school.,1169078400,,117,5.2105263157894735
2643914,5,B000HWZ4R0,A real good collection the nostalgic charme from this series directly comes up from the first episode on! I really love it! Im waiting now for volume three ;),1168905600,,158,4.482758620689655
2643915,5,B000HWZ4R0,"I bought this set for my 21 year old son.  He loved these as a kid, and still does.  I got Vol. 1 last year for him.  They just don't make the 'good' cartoons like this anymore!",1168819200,,177,3.72972972972973
2643916,5,B000HWZ4R0,"As a child of the fifties, I grew up reading comic books. Though I was more a fan of the superhero variety, I occasionally read the ""lighter"" titles, which included such fare as ""Archie"" and Carl Banks' ""Uncle Scrooge."" It is the latter that served as the basis for the series from which this compilation is culled.

Premiering as a weekday show in 1987, ""Disney's DuckTales"" brought a new dimension to television animation. Though primarily geared for a young audience, the show had enough in jokes and historical/pop culture references to appeal to the children's parents. Well done parodies of ""Star Trek,"" the ""Indiana Jones"" series, John Wayne, the Kentucky Derby, James Bond, fairy tales and world mythology, and even primetime's biggest soap opera, ""Dallas,"" can be found among this 24-episode collection.

The highlight, of course, is ""Treasure of the Golden Suns,"" the five-part pilot that introduces Uncle Scrooge and tells how he became guardian to nephew Donald's younger charges, Huey, Dewey, and Louie. The episode also shows the transition of Scrooge from miserly to a bit more compassionate to others as a result of his new-found ""parenthood.""

In addition to these characters, there is the introduction of Mrs. Beakly, the nanny, and her grandchild, Webby; the butler, Duckworth; inventor, Gyro Gearloose; erstwhile pilot Lauchpad McQuack; the boys' friend, Doofus; and McDuck's chief financial nemesis, Flintheart Glomgold. Filling out the cast are the recurring appearances of The Beagle Boys and sorceress Magica De Spell.

Voicing these characters is a talented array of voice actors. Leading the pack is Alan Young (""Uncle Scrooge""), primarily known for his memorable turn as Wilbur Post, owner of the ""Mr. Ed"" of television fame. Young brings vivid life to the sometimes cantankerous yet lovable duck millionaire. Terence McGovern has fun as ""Launchpad,"" while Russi Taylor has a field day providing all the voices of the younger ducklings.

Hal Smith, forever ""Otis"" on the old ""Andy Griffith Show,"" assays the duel roles of Gyro and Glomgold, as well as other incidental characters. Jim Cummings and Peter Cullen are other actors that bring voice to a myriad of characters.

And the legendary June Foray, the voice behind ""Rocky the Flying Squirrel,"" utilizes her distinctive pipes as ""Magica De Spell.""

Besides the great writing, Ron Jones, composer of arguably the best score in ""Star Trek: The Next Generation's"" history (""The Best of Both Worlds, Parts I and II"") is responsible for the exciting music that would be used throughout the series run. Much better than the usual fare that accompanies television 'toons, Jones deserved an Emmy for his compositions.

In all, ""DuckTales"" belongs in the cartoon hall of fame as a prime example of a program that is definitely ""family friendly"" and non-condescending to small fry, stimulating as well as entertaining.",1164844800,44,2889,5.224622030237581
2643917,5,B000HWZ4R0,"The Golden Suns are here, finally! This is an amazing set, and better than I remembered it as a kid!  Compelling stories, good animation, great voice acting.  Tons of fun for any age.  Wish they made cartoons today as good as they did back in the ""day"".  The Temple of the Golden Suns completely got me hooked on Duck Tales as a kid, and got me into reading the Carl Barks/Don Rosa comic books.  I remembered it from, gosh, when I saw it in 87', so it must have made a big impression!  Go get it today - you won't be disappointed!  Because life IS like a hurricane!",1163980800,5,565,4.175925925925926
2643918,5,B000HWZ4R0,"DuckTales is not necessarily a children's show. It's actually a very entertaining show for all ages. Thank goodness the first collection was popular enough to produce a second. DuckTales was one of the best cartoons ever made. So far I own both collections, collection one of Chip n' Dale, and the Talespin DVD set. I'm also looking forward to a collection of Real Ghostbusters seasons but that's a whole other studio. Thank you Disney for bringing this show back. I'm hoping that the third collection will be out sometime next year (with Bubba and Gizmo Duck) and I hope the movie will be released on DVD soon. The only thing I wish the folks at Disney could find is some behind the scenes footage or have an interview video with the developers of the show. This show brings back so many childhood memories. The copyright date of 1987 seems like ages ago. Disney should really bring shows like this back into the market.",1163548800,27,921,4.656441717791411
2643919,5,B000HWZ4R0,"Volume 2 has arrived and with it the much wanted Treasure of the Golden Sun Series.  The first five episodes are dedicated to the first disc along with 3 other episodes.  Swap the first discs from Volume 1 and Volume 2 and you'll have the Treasure of the Golden Suns on Volume 1.  The other episodes are all classics from the Ducktales series, Working for Scales is one of my personal favorite episodes from the series and I was glad to see it, along with its series from Catching as Cash Can.  I am also glad to say that the episodes are uncut and include scenes that are not shown on Cable.

While you cannot skip past the opening theme song, there are chapters when you play all, and you can skip from chapter to chapter.  There are no extras again, but for the price the Volume is a really good value.  I have noticed no problems in video or sound quality.  If you're like me and could care less about extras and just want the episodes for a good price this is the set for you.

So sit back and enjoy this viewing of the second Volume of the Ducktales series, many classic episodes for your viewing pleasure.",1163462400,12,1112,4.282296650717703
2643920,4,B000HWZ4R0,"My question is will the 5 part golden suns episodes be whole and complete? When they re-aired the episodes on Toon Disney they cut out various parts that I guess in the sanitary world of disney were deemed unacceptable. In ""wrong way to Ronguay"" they cut out a scene where there showed a world war 2 style cheesecake calender in the background... sexy looking women ducks in suggestive poses I guess are a no no. In ""Don't give up the ship"" simularly they cut out the ""La orange"" theatrical flyer front that showed a ballerina duck woman in what I guess could be a sexy pose. In the latter in cutting this out it made the storyline jump considerably and make no logical sense. There may be other cuts which I am unaware of, but these two alone both made the story jump a bit and not make as much sense. I have no idea why Disney would make such a big deal of these things to the detriment of the storylines, but for the airings on Toon Disney they did cut them out. I am really hoping they put the unedited versions on here, otherwise I will have to find a way to put my original syndicated tapings on dvd myself.",1159401600,9,1113,4.254716981132075
2643921,5,B000HWZ4R0,"So after plenty of lobbying and the internet community speaking out, DuckTales' Pilot, Treasure of the Golden Suns is making its way onto DVD, one Volume too late, but certainly nonetheless, great news. Not in its original movie format, but the 5 parts that went out into syndication after the first run of season one. Disc One includes, Treasure of The Golden Suns (Split into 5 parts), Back to the Klondike, Horse Scents and Scrooge's Pet. Disc Two includes The Firefly Fruit Contest episodes (1-4), Merit-Time Adventure, The Golden Fleecing, Ducks of the West and The Time Teasers. Disc three finished the set with Back Out in the Outback, Raiders of the Lost Harp, The Right Duck, Scroogerello, Double-O-Duck, Luck o' the Dcuks, Duckworths Revolt and the 2 story episode Magica's Magic Mirror and Take Me Out of the Ballgame.",1156723200,78,829,4.928571428571429

They are not good for children to watch in most cases and this is good clean cartoons!. I would not be worried about my child watching this. There are lessons in these. They are much better then the stuff they show kids now.  My husband and I actually have date nights and watch several episodes. Its light hearted, makes us laugh and not be so serious, and brings back some nostalgic memories. You cannot help but sing along with the intro song. Everyone that watched this knows the song. I have this and several other DVD's and I cannot wait until I have children and watch this with them and share those memories.",1475193600,2,786,4.346938775510204

My daughter has even named a few of her stuffed animals Huey, Dewy and Louie.  I am personally a fan of Launchpad McQuack.

DuckTales is an incredibly well-written, hilarious show that I still enjoy as an adult almost as much as I did as a kid. If you haven't seen it, you should. If your kids haven't seen it, they absolutely should. I'm only giving the purchase 4 stars, however, because the construction was lacking in the case. Though I appreciate the slimmed down design (Volume 1 came as three separate, slim, plastic cases in a cardboard sleeve), when I received the DVDs, the inner disc-holder that's supposed to snap on in the middle was already broken, so instead of providing the intended protection, the discs get tossed around a bit. It hasn't actually become problematic yet (the discs are all fine), but it's always sucky when things arrive broken.",1432339200,,798,4.748201438848921

Whoever said that it is not just a children's show is right.  Lol people of many ages will enjoy this.  Disney has changed a lot over the years.  I believe that Roy Disney JR. certainly lived up to his name, and his words.  He did a great job.  You just couldn't ask for a better show.

The kids giggle and talk about the show so it's obviously entertaining to them.  I think the best part is when my oldest turns to me and tells me about something that he learned... like not being greedy, or that we should think about others, etc.  It's nice to see that even though television is supposedly rotting our brains that at least my children are learning something from the same shows that we grew up with!

2644242,3,B000HWZ4R0,"I would like to be absolutely clear as to why I am awarding this three stars instead of five: the compression used to put these cartoons on the disk is atrocious. I bought this specifically to watch The Valley of the Golden Suns ""pilot"" with my wife (who is a huge fan of Scrooge McDuck) only to find that every small rounded shape in the cartoon was now square. Take for example, Scrooge diving into his money bin. Instead of a multitude of little round coins, they were square. When Scrooge is chased by a bunch of natives who are supposed to be little round figures in the distance, they are square. Even his round pince nez turns into little squares when Scrooge is small enough in the frame. It gets VERY distracting VERY fast which is a shame because the artwork and story of the series paved the way for the entire Disney afternoon lineup. In the end it was someone's job to convert the original animated material to digital to be put on this DVD, and that person should be reproached.",1420156800,18,992,4.426229508196721

2644346,5,B000HWZ4R0,"The 2nd volume of Ducktales is possibly my favorite (the only other candidate is Volume 3; even if volume 4 was released it would probably be my least favorite).  Heres a review of the episodes, with synopsizes from Wikipedia.

28-32./1-5.  Treasure of the Golden Suns:  The introduction of the series, as Donald Duck joins the Navy and sends Huey, Dewey, and Louie off to live with their uncle Scrooge McDuck. Meanwhile, a mysterious man named El Capitn busts the Beagle Boys out of jail in order for them to help him steal an awkward treasure map in Scrooge's possession.  This was a really good pilot.  Even the Nostalgia Critic really enjoyed it!  A+

33.  Back To the Klondike:  Scrooge takes the kids to the Klondike, where he met an old flame, Glittering Goldie.  A great adaption of the comic.  A

34.  Horse Sense:  Webby helps trains a horse for the Kenducky Derby so the owner will have the money to raise it.  The worst Flintheart episode well see (at least until Bubba shows up).  The bits with him & Scrooge are great, but the focus on Webby sucks.  D

35.  Scrooges Pet:  Scrooge loses the new combination for his vault to a lemming that the boys and Webby got him as a pet.  A fine episode.  B

36-39.  Catch As Cash Can:  Scrooge and Glomgold compete in a contest where the winner, being the world's richest duck, becomes the sales broker for a new fruit from Macaroon that works like a flashlight.  First, though, Scrooge must keep his fortune away from the Beagle Boys.  Another great multi-part story.  A

40.  Merit-Time Adventure:  The Nephews, Webby, and Doofus attempt to earn a Junior Woodchuck badge in sailing while a sea monster is preying on Scrooge's shipping fleet.  B+

41.  The Golden Fleecing:  After hearing about Launchpad's encounter with several Harpies, Scrooge heads to the Black Sea to seek out the legendary Golden Fleece.  However, the fleece is guarded by a Sleepless Dragon.  Some of Launchpads episodes are among the best in the whole show, & this is one of them.  A+

42.  Ducks of the West:  Scrooge and the boys go to Scrooge's oil wells to find out why they ran dry.  B+

43.  Time Teasers:  Gyro invents a watch that allows anyone to move incredibly fast.  But the Beagle Boys want to use it so they can steal all of Scrooge's money.  Things get worse when they whole group ends up traveling backwards in time and end up meeting pirates.  A

44.  Back Out In The Outback:  Something's attacking Scrooge's sheep and shearing off their wool, so Scrooge heads off for Australia to find out what's going on.  Worse, Webby gets lost in the outback.  Another Webby focused episode, but its better than the other one.  B

45.  Raiders of the Lost Harp:  Scrooge acquires a magical harp that can determine if someone was lying or not.  However, Magica de Spell wants the harp for herself, and so does the harp's guardian: a five-story stone Minotaur.  By far the better of the 2 Magica episodes on this set.  Its refreshing to see her going after something else besides Scrooges number 1 dime.  A+

46.  The Right Duck:  After being fired by Scrooge, Launchpad enters the space program, and accidentally gets sent to Mars.  Worse, Doofus joins him on his trip, the pair accidentally causing the Martians to attack Earth.  Launchpad-centric episodes are always a little above average if not excellent.  A-

47.  Scroogerello:  While experiencing a fever, Scrooge has an extended dream sequence parodying the fairy tale of Cinderella, with himself in the titular role.  This is a very fun episode.  I know it probably sounds sacrilegious, but I find this much more entertaining than Disneys Cinderella.  A

48.  Double O duck:  Launchpad finds himself masquerading as Bruno Von Beak, an agent for the Foreign Organization of World Larceny, whose leader Dr Nogood, wants to wipe out the worlds money supply.  One of the best.  Its especially interesting watching it now since it inspired Darkwing Duck.  A+

49.  Luck O The Ducks:  After finding a leprechaun in his cargo, Scrooge is led to Ireland, where he believes that he'll find a vast fortune of gold.  However, the leprechauns won't give it up without a fight.  This is the worst Ducktales well see this side of season 2.  Theres nothing good about this one.  F

50.  Duckworths Revolt:  After being fired by Scrooge, Duckworth and the boys are abducted by plant aliens and enslaved aboard their ship along with dozens of other kidnapped aliens.  A great spotlight for Duckworth.  A

51a.  Magicas Magic Mirror:  Magica uses a pair of magic mirrors to try to get Scrooge's Number One Dime.  It tries, but it should have been longer instead of wasting half of the episode to  C+

51b.  Take Me Out of the Ball Game:  This.  Duckworth coaches the Junior Woodchucks in a baseball game.  Not very entertaining at all I thought.  This episode was just a poor attempt at the 2 shorts format (which Gummi Bears pretty much mastered).  D+

So thats only 3 bad episodes out of 24, & a little over 2 thirds of the set are A- or better.  Even I have to admit this set is a really good buy.  Get this set first if you want to relive seeing Ducktales or have never seen it before.  Then go back to Volume 1 & then see Volume 3.  You will be very glad you did.",1388361600,,5243,4.593681917211329

Now about the DVD...um well the picture quality is still low grade, the same picture quality as Volume one, DVD extra's none wish I could say there is extra's but nope nothing

Note: If you purchase this item new keep in mind a genuine DuckTale's DVD set's come with Disney code slip inside of box cover, you'll get set with cover box wide enough to fit all three disk, & their separate clear thin cases, Volume one has paper art on disc, but Volume 2 has stamped art I recommend, buying new because it will lessen the likely hood of getting cheap reproduction set or poorly conditioned set, & new sets have redeemable studio code inside you can use the code to register the set on the studio website it helps to prove authenticity of set, buyer beware sometimes when shopping online there is always a slight risk of receiving cheap duplicate

Helpful playback tips:

If you have a Blu-ray player it's best to play this DVD set in AV mode because this set does not upscale well in HDMI mode, so be sure that you're Blu-ray player is connected with AV cables as well as HDMI cable so you can switch to AV mode when needed, remember this DVD set plays best in AV mode. well that's all I hope my review was helpful.",1361664000,7,1446,4.305147058823529

Ducktales is a classic because of the reaonably good stories & enjoyable naturer of the epsiodes. Disney is a classic due to poor product quality & total indiffernce to customer satisfaction. The Customer Service Centre is a total disgrace. My problems arose when I got my copy of ducktales & found black horizontal stripes. No big deal well so I thought. Contacted the Disney WMD & then it started. Good promises & no action. They appear to operate on the principle of refusing to reply after the third e-mail, good one Disney. That way they don't have to deal with the problem. So I e-mailed & even faxed Disey direct, yep same problem for me but solution for them just ignor the problem. If Disney want to finally do something I still have copies of e-mails & even faxes. No rude or crude comments involved so why did they refuse to deal with the problem simple it is their Corporate Philosophy ""refuse to acknowledge a problem"" that way you don't havce to deal with it. I can only hope that Disney gets taken over by a Japanese company that inderstands customer service & gets rid of the failed executives at Disney.

Some of the cartoons on TV right now are not at all in the same league as the clever writing and storytelling found in this series. When this DVD set came in the mail, my daughter and I immediately sat down and watched the 5 part pilot episode ""Treasure of the Golden Suns"". She is usually a very active child. This series kept her attention throughout the entire 5 part pilot. She fell in love with it, and we are watching the series together.

2644592,5,B000HWZ4R0,"What's not to love about a series revolving around the three boys (Huey, Dewey, and Louie) in a town called Duckburg?

I loved watching the reruns of this show when I was a kid. I had to have the DVDs when I saw them. They brought back memories. I've taken DuckTales (and other shows from around the same time like Gummi Bears and Chip'n'Dale Rescue Rangers) when I babysit for some of my younger cousins. Unlike most TV shows these days, they actually hold the kids' attention for more than 5 minutes. Nor I am ashamed to admit that I've been known to throw one of these shows in when I've had a bad day or am not feeling well and just want something comforting.

One thing: For some reason they decided not to put everything in its proper order when they released DuckTales on DVD. The first five episodes of the series are included here, in Volume 2 rather than being in Volume 1 where they belong. Its a bit odd and makes it more difficult if you wanted to watch them in order.

I think its even better to watch this series when you are older and wiser because of all the subtle nuances woven into the mini plots.
I can say this is probably one of the best series Disney ever ran. Originally, back in the 90s, it was part of Disney afternoons (that I would pray to be sick just so I could stay home from school to watch). I only wish Disney would produce a box set of each series together so I wouldnt have to purchase each volume by volume. Still it provides hours of peace & quiet while the kiddles remain entertained.

But that said, this 2nd set is really good. This set begins with the 5 episode start of the series. (""Treasure of the Golden Suns""). This is where Donald leaves for the navy, and Scrooge meets the 3 nephews.

Disc 2 has the 4 episode movie ""Catch As Cash Can"" where Scrooge and Flint Heart have a contests to see who is the richest duck and will make even more money soon. 'Merit Time Adventure' is an interesting 'Scooby Doo' type Duck Tales where Scrooge's ships are being lost at sea.

Disc 3 has a couple of good episodes. 'The Right Duck' is a DT version of Flash Gordon where Launchpad McQuack has a moment in the spotlight. 'Luck O Duck' is a nice Saint Patrick's Day special. 'Duckworth gets a little time in the spotlight in 'Duckworth's Revolt' when he is kidnapped and has to encourage some prisoners to rise up against their captors. Duckworth gets another moment in the spotlight when he coaches a baseball team in 'Take Me Out of the Ballgame.'

I like Flinthead Glomgold character as he the nemesis of Scrooge McDuck.  The best episodes are (The treasure of the Golden Suns), (The golden fleecing), (Raiders of the lost harp), and (Scroogerello).

Disc 1 includes: Treasure of the golden suns (part 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), Back to the Klondike, Horse scents, and Scrooge's pet.

Disc 2 includes: Catch as cash can (part 1, 2, 3, 4), Merit-time adventure, The golden fleecing, Ducks of the West, and Time teasers.

Disc 3 includes: Back out in the outback, Raiders of the lost harp, The right duck, Scroogerello, Double-O-Duck, Luck O' the ducks, Duckworth's revolt, and Magica's magic mirror / take me out of the ballgame.",1196553600,9,994,4.705202312138728
2644649,5,B000HWZ4R0,"We love Duck Tales and are very glad to be able to get the second edition of the series.  We are introducing a new generation to this fun filled cartoon.  To semi-quote Launchpad...""On a scale of 1 to 10, we give it an A!""",1194307200,2,222,4.0227272727272725
2644650,5,B000HWZ4R0,"The second volume is a welcome addition to the material on DVD of the amazing ducks. More great adventures,more spectacular fun and best of all, the series start is finally included. The masterful adventure in five parts that set the tone for the series is finally included, as is the great cash contest to see who would market the glowing fruit... all multi part stories, but great nonetheless. Also, the two stories in the space of one episode is introduced on disc 3 here. The additional stories on the discs are , in part, material adapted from the great Carl Barks' bountiful body of work. And why are there only ""24"" episodes, instead of 27 as there were in volume one? Where are the missing episodes?Or does the adverts count for more ( They sound great in 5.1)? But I am happy with it all, since Duck Tales was great on Saturday TV, and even better with no commercials.

The DVD is of good quality, but it is strange that the promo starts in disc one are in 5.1, but the remainder of the material is all in mono. And worst of all, the promo refers to the restoration of the older films, which is great; but, for the older fans who enjoyed these when young, why did Disney not put the material into 5.1? or even stereo ? And even a booklet that looks at the Barks connection to the  stories would have been good. Ah well, at least I am thankful this great work is out on DVD.
2/24/15: These new versions state 25th Anniversary edition, however they are still in 2.0 Mono ( what is that ? its either 2.0 or  its mono like the old films that hae been remastered but are still in mono). Anyway, I have not yet got volume 3, and at this time, not a choice for me. However, when I watched the original Duck Tales on TV, it was great since I could remember the carl Barks stories that most were based on. The quality of this material needs to have a sound upgrade, and I think that Disney would have a good investment for this high quality series. The most comparable duck series is quack pack, which, whilst I like it, it does not hold a candle to the classic Duck Tales. If you can get the 3 volumes, then I recommend you buy all three, since if they go up or ( heaven forfend) drop from production, then you will have a classic series that adults and children will love.",1191110400,,2274,4.271461716937355
2644725,5,B000HWZ4R0,"I'm very pleased with this buy! unfortunately Disney's not going to bring out this complete serie in Europe. We onely have 5 episodes on a disc because of the different languages that have to be on the disc. The onely thing is that I can't watch it in Dutch like when I was young, but that's no problem at all... Happely I could buy the dvd-box at Amazon. Even with shipping it's cheaper than in Europe, even through I had to pay another 10 euro's import-taxes to get it into the Netherlands.  This box makes me think about my youth, when I watched it when it was on television:d Great memories!
Amazing this dvd-box! Can't wait for the third box!!",1190073600,,648,4.4

2644727,4,B000HWZ4R0,I was very excited to get volume two on dvd. The episodes featured the actual ducktales and we finally got the pilot. These episodes were great but the dissapointment came when there were still no special features.,1185494400,3,214,4.8108108108108105
2644728,5,B000HWZ4R0,"Even better than Volume 1, this second installment of the Duck Tales series includes all parts of the 5 part pilot. The picture quality is a little grainy and the DVD menu isn't exactly inspired, but those are the only negatives I could say about the set.

I watched this series as a kid, then as reruns in high school, and now on DVD as an adult. And I don't just watch it for the nostalgia, although that's certainly a big part. The show is hysterical for people of all ages. The tales are inventive, and pull from all kinds of sources like King Arthur, the search for the Fountain of Youth, and Greek Mythology. The dialogue is great for kids, and there are some wonderful lessons to be learned from the stories, but there are plenty of great jokes hidden in for adults as well. I laugh through every episode. But then, something as simple as Uncle Scrooge yelling ""Murderers! Thieves! Politicians!"" gets me going. So if you have kids who are interested in treasure hunts and make-believe, or if you're an adult who enjoys subtle humor, you should definately get this set.",1182297600,2,1075,4.541237113402062

2644731,5,B000HWZ4R0,"The second volume of DuckTales is as much a delight as the first, because it in a sense starts over, opening with the pilot episode, here presented in five parts, Treasure of the Golden Suns. At the outset, Donald Duck has joined the Navy, so his nephews go to live with their money- loving Uncle Scrooge. At first they don't get along: he's got lots of rough edges, and the trio blench at being restrained. The very first episode brilliantly brings in the Junior Woodchucks, the scouting group Huey, Dewey, and Louie joined up with in the later Dell/ Gold Key Carl Barks comics.

From the beginning, this was an imaginative, lavishly done cartoon series, the flagship of the Disney Afternoon, which would also include TaleSpin, Chip and Dale's Rescue Rangers and Gummi Bears. Like DuckTales, these shows brought back stars from the Disney archives, building on the Disney strength of strong character design.

DuckTales is also a textbook case of how to make a DVD set. This box set includes three one- sided discs, each in their own slipcase, with a total of 19 episodes as well as the five part pilot. You can easily skip the initial Coming Attractions by pushing Menu on the remote. If you're doing Cartoons without Cable, your kids can look forward to a new episode each day. If you're an animation lover, fan of Carl Barks' comics or a Disneyphile, this is the set for you. Disney has long been synonymous with quality in animation; now they also lead the way in creating excellent DVD box sets.",1174953600,11,1501,4.681818181818182
2644732,4,B000HWZ4R0,"I grew up with this show! It's great for those nostalgic moments. Although, I like Volume 2 better, because it includes the original movie which is also referred to as the pilot episodes. It's where the nephews first come to live with there uncle & they end up looking for sunken treasure. I believe it's called ""The Valley of the Golden Sun"" or something to that extent. The regular episodes are good too. A bit cheesy, but it's a kids Disney show--what can you expect.",1173657600,2,470,4.541176470588235

It starts out with the original 5-part story which made the pilot of this series, when Donald Duck joins the navy and has to drop off his three nephews with his Uncle Scrooge. The episodes are all that I rmember them to be. Its just wonderful, like sitting in a time machine for each 20 minute episode and re-entering those blissful childhood days of the 1990's when I would come home from school and enjoy an afternoon of Disney.",1173398400,2,468,4.517647058823529
