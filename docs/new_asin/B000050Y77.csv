8507602,5,B000050Y77,"This is an excellent documentary film about one of the most extraordinary, fascinating, and interesting cult leaders in American history - David Koresh. This film has a lot of footage of David Koresh; it even shows him sing with an electric guitar and a lot of preaching. The video tells the story of David Koresh from the very beginning and to the end. I must admit that David Koresh was a wonderful musician; he had a very beautiful voice. He could have become a famous rock musician. I think it would have been a better choice for him.

I think it is amazing how David Koresh became a famous cult leader. As a child, he was severely abused, and he was never really loved by his parents. He also had a learning disability and attended special education classes. Children made fun of him. As a young adult, he was not allowed to marry the girl that he loved and who was pregnant with his child. Almost all of his life he was badly mistreated by the people around him. He found comfort and happiness in studying the Bible.

According to his mother, David Koresh used to stutter as a child. That is why he had to attend special education classes. He could not read, write, or speak properly. Given all these learning disabilities, he became an excellent speaker. Even his mother was amazed when she heard his sermons.

It is true that David Koresh did a lot of things which were wrong, but if one takes into consideration all the terrible experiences that he had to go through, one can understand why he did what he did. He was emotionally destroyed as a child and young adult. Despite him being a ""sinful messiah"", I belive that Branch Davidian members did not deserve to die the way they died. After all, it was their choice to live with David Koresh, to ""marry"" him, and to obey his orders. They believed everything he told them, but it was their choice to believe whatever they wanted to believe. I definitely think that there was another solution to the Waco standoff - a more peaceful and fair solution. The US government could have arrested Koresh when he was away from Mt. Carmel Center, but they did not... They also should have used better and more effective negotiation techniques when talking to Koresh. They should have listened to the religious experts who warned them against attacking doomsday/apocalyptic cults.

I think David Koresh was not an insane evil devil; he was an emotionally disturbed individual who was never truly loved by anyone, and who, deep inside, understood that he was not a happy person. Also let us not forget that people join cults or sects because they want a sense of belonging and a meaning in life. David Koresh provided that sense of belonging and meaning of life to his followers. In any case, Branch Davidian members were better off alive (even under the leadership of David Koresh) than dead.",1263686400,,2839,4.626984126984127
