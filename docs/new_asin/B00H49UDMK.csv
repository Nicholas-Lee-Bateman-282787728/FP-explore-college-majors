6131369,5,B00H49UDMK,Il Divo is the most beautiful awesome group of my time. I am 77 years old. They sing songs I have heard most of my life but with so much drama and inspiration. The Musical has it all!!,1393113600,2,184,3.8684210526315788
6131370,2,B00H49UDMK,We didn't enjoy it as much as some if the other performances we have from them. Interviews and lack of performance videos.,1392595200,5,122,4.590909090909091
6131371,4,B00H49UDMK,"I LOVE Il Divo and everything they do.  I've been an avid fan since their concert at ""The Greek"".  The CD ""Musical Affair"" is outstanding and one of their best.  The songs they chose and the duets with other performers are beautiful.  Nothing but brilliant can be said about the CD. They've only gotten better over the ten years of being together!  HOWEVER, THAT BEING SAID, I was so disappointed that the DVD was not of their concert, but interviews with them. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed listening to what they said because I've only seen short interviews with them and only as a group.  It was nice to hear what they had to say individually.  But I'm not happy about the fact that I was misled.",1417392000,3,699,4.4140625
6131372,5,B00H49UDMK,Il Divo is one of our favorite groups!  This is really good.  I don't think they are CAPABLE of making a bad album! :),1416096000,,118,3.875
6131373,5,B00H49UDMK,"Above excellent. I listen to them everyday, even in my car. I turn it full blast.",1412985600,,81,4.125
6131374,3,B00H49UDMK,"This DVD was not what we expected.  Where is the musical part of the DVD, it is only a conversational DVD????????????  CD is great; however, we already had one of them.  We believe we were mislead to think that the DVD would be a musical one.",1410739200,,242,4.217391304347826
6131375,4,B00H49UDMK,I purchased  CD for the car and the CD/DVD for home.  Was disappointed when I received the DVD that it was not a concert.,1407110400,,121,4.0
6131376,5,B00H49UDMK,Love love love them!,1404518400,,20,4.25
6131377,5,B00H49UDMK,Enjoyed the cd immensely.  Was disappointed with the dvd; I was under the impression it was a dvd of their concert when in reality it was just a lot of interviews with IL Divo.  I expressed my dissatisfaction to the seller and they immediately resolved the issue.  Good people to deal with.,1401753600,5,290,4.538461538461538
6131378,2,B00H49UDMK,I felt I was mislead. I thought the DVD would be the performing of the songs not the conversations about their making.,1398816000,3,118,4.409090909090909
6131379,3,B00H49UDMK,The DVD did not show Il Divo actually performing--only the making of the concert.  I saw A Musical Affair in New York and the DVD does not compare favorably.,1396396800,11,157,4.413793103448276
6131380,5,B00H49UDMK,"Excellent.  Heather Headley is so perfect as is Il Divo!  You can't ask for better music than what Il Divo provides.  Each voice has their own oneness and together just can't be beat.  Their production of each song they sing; the voice used when used is perfect alone or with one or more of the others.  Sebastian's voice is another Frank Sinatra voice only I believe better tuned as is his range.  Carlos being the only baritone sets Il Divo aside from the others attempting or actually singing the opera-pop which I believe they could very well fit into many other categories.  David Miller is so perfect.  I have never heard such a range and his falsetto is to strong it is very difficult to know when he goes into and comes out of it. (I've heard Alfie Boe, Hugh Jackman and Frazier Walters of The Tenors sing ""Bring Him Home"" and David far exceeds them all in ability and emotional deliverance.)  Urs has a voice like I have never heard before.  The most perfect clarity.  I love them all and hope they stay together until they can no longer produce their musical sound.",1393632000,7,1075,4.489690721649485
