8375532,5,B0000633RA,"What a crock, that editor that wrote the original editorial on these movies doesn't know what he's talking about!!! THomas the tank engine movies are about crochety, cranky trains who fight, argue and compete all the time.  They are quite rude and mean to each other. Jay Jay the Jet Plane characters are more cooperative, and friendly towards each other. THey are more loveable, and learn lessons in a MORE FRIENDLY way. Not to mention, just adorable, and very MUSICAL!",1109030400,7,470,4.875
