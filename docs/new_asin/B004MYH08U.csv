4434163,2,B004MYH08U,"The Green Hornet movie is one that I've been looking forward to for years.  It's been rumored to be coming since the early 90's.  It went through numerous incarnations that somehow didn't make it.  From actors like George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg as the Hornet to Jet Li and Stephen Chow as Kato.  A script was written by no less than Kevin Smith that was recently made into the first 10 issues of the Green Hornet comic book.  Somewhere in there it seemed like they had the nuts and bolts of it right....and then Seth Rogen entered the picture.

Rogen is one of America's beloved buffoons.  Necessary to the American psyche, buffoons have a hallowed place in cinema.  From the sidekicks of Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, the Durango Kid, et al to Jerry Lewis, Dick Van Dyke, and Owen Wilson, to the films that serve as a commentary on the buffoon lifestyle (Up In Smoke, Big Lebowski, Knocked Up), each of us has a buffoon we admire.  Buffoons generally realize their place in the movies and are usually content to work that vein for all they can.  Buffoons are typecast and (usually) should not attempt to crossover to leading man roles.  Rogen has attempted that step, I believe (the script makes it hard to tell for sure), and fallen badly in his try.

The script for the Green Hornet was written by Seth Rogen.  I have no doubt that he's a very smart man in his area of expertise, but, as of yet, that doesn't include action/adventure.  He can't make up his mind if he wants it to be in the action genre, comedy, or thriller, and ends up failing to be any of the above.  It never rises above the level of a 10 year old, resorting to violence, explosions, and gunfire in an attempt to cover its inadequacies.  Even Rogen's attempts at comedy are, for the most part, unfunny.  His Hornet whines and needs constant pampering. There is no attempt to be edgy, moody, or dark.  You will not mistake this for The Dark Knight.  The premiere of NBC's new show The Cape, seen last week and mediocre at best,  was Max Allan Collins meets Raymond Chandler compared to this. Rogen is the Green Hornet in the same manner as it would have been if Benny Hill had been cast as James Bond (which is not totally unlike the Moore James Bond, but that's for another time).

The Green Hornet tv show was made in 1966 on a shoestring budget.  The special effects were rudimentary.  Yet that old series far outshines this movie.  Van Williams played the Hornet as a tough-as-nails and hardcore fighter.  Bruce Lee played every fight scene with total energy and effort.  Those qualities are simply not to be found here.  Even the two serials from the 40's rank one star higher than this, the poorest of entries in the GH family history.

There were two bright spots that I found.  First was Jay Chou's portrayal of Kato.  While lacking the charisma of Bruce Lee, Chou's Kato was intelligent and witty, a partner rather than a sidekick.  I hope to see him in more U.S. movies.  The second was an early scene in the movie in Britt's room that showed a poster reproduction of a cover from an issue of Dynamite's Lone Ranger comic.  For those that might not know, the Lone Ranger (John Reid) is the great-uncle of the Green Hornet (Britt Reid).  The tip of the hat was very nice.  Interestingly, in 1980 a revival was attempted of the Lone Ranger.  While the movie had a few nice moments it had generated so much bad publicity before it even was released that it bombed.  I believe that Rogen's Hornet will make some money if for no other reason than mom and dad being able to take the 10 year olds to it, but quality-wise it actually ranks under the 1980 Lone Ranger.

I really wanted to like this movie.  I knew that reconstructing the magic of the series was impossible....I'm not 12 anymore.  I went in knowing that things would be different and for the first half hour kept telling myself that it was good.  Sooner or later we learn to stop lying to ourselves.  Not even Jeff Imada's martial choreography could save it.  Here's hoping that it doesn't spawn a series of movies, each one less than the one before it.  Masked heroes can be done right....Batman and Spider-Man, case in point.  Even Ben Affleck's Daredevil was much better than this.  This movie is silly and unintelligent and Seth Rogen should be ashamed of himself.  Come to think of it, the producers should be ashamed of themselves because apparently they thought it was some good stuff.  Don't waste your money on this one.  You'll buy it for the kids, they'll watch it once, and you'll sell it in that garage sale you have every summer.  Buy the old series on dvd....you'll keep that, if for no other reason than to watch Bruce.",1295049600,203,4671,4.502380952380952
4434164,1,B004MYH08U,"A mish-mash and hodge-podge of half-baked notions and confusing set-pieces and laboriously lame atempts at humor.  The two leads can't act and seem uncomfortable in the extreme.  Cameron Diaz looks cute but has nothing to do.  James Franco pops in briefly, probably relieved.  Terrific actors Tom Wilkinson and Christoph Waltz do their best with the inept script (again Rogen).

An opportunity missed to not go back to the 30s and do it in the pseudo-serious style of the great radio show.

$130 million wasted and no one at the studio with enough creative nerve to say ""this stinks.""  Sad.",1295049600,13,590,4.898989898989899
4434165,3,B004MYH08U,"You know something is wrong when the worst character in ""The Green Hornet"" is The Green Hornet himself. As portrayed by Seth Rogen, we see a twelve-year-old trapped in a man's body, a bratty and talkative megalomaniac that does none of the dirty work and truly has no idea what he's doing. Rogen, who is also the co-writer and one of the executive producers, is not only tragically miscast but has also written his character badly; rather than a bold and debonair crime fighter, as he was in the original 1930s radio program, The Green Hornet is now a broadly defined goofball, a spoiled and whiny jerk who can do little more than say how cool something looks before getting his butt kicked. In the annals of pulp fiction, few characters have been this unlikeable, unimpressive, and cowardly.

The unfortunate thing is that this ""new"" and ""improved"" Green Hornet sets off a chain reaction that brings down the rest of the film. This is bad because all the ingredients were there; Cameron Diaz was smart and sexy, Jay Chou was fast and fierce, the action was entertaining, the special effects were convincing, and for the first time in ages, the 3D process was full and immersive. For God's sake, they even got Christoph Waltz, who so effortlessly earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for ""Inglourious Basterds."" But when the best you can do is have the title character run away from a crime scene shouting, ""Save me, Kato!"" when he's supposed to be a ruthless vigilante, then something has gone terribly wrong.

In the film, Rogen plays Britt Reid, the son of James Reid (Tom Wilkinson), the editor in chief of a Los Angeles newspaper called ""The Daily Sentinel."" Still upset over the death of his mother, and bitter over his father's constant disapproval, Britt lives his life as an irresponsible slacker who likes to drink, party, and embarrass his father by ending up on the front page of the morning newspaper. James dies unexpectedly, apparently the result of a bee sting; Britt must now take over as editor in chief, a position he's neither qualified for nor motivated to take on, mostly because he didn't get along with his father and is disheartened by the public outcry over his death.

Even though he fired all of his father's staff, he rehires Kato (Chou) simply because he makes a damn fine cup of coffee. But Kato has other talents - he's an inventor and a mechanic, and I'll bet one of his creations is a time machine because there's no way a person can single handedly assemble a car so quickly. He also likes classical music, is skilled in the ways of martial arts, and possesses an inhuman ability to scan thugs and pinpoint their weapons. I will now skip a number of inconsequential details and get to the part where the two decide to become crime fighters. Their angle: They will wear masks, pose as criminals, and infiltrate the lairs of real criminals. In no time, Kato has rigged up a muscle car dubbed the Black Beauty with bulletproof glass, virtually indestructible steel, missiles, machine guns, and other various overkills. Kato then supplies Britt's vigilante alter ego with a name: The Green Hornet.

Britt secretly relies on his newly hired secretary, the beautiful Lenore Case (Diaz), for tips on behaving more like a criminal, since she's a serious journalist with a degree in criminology. He creates his own publicity by publishing stories about The Green Hornet in ""The Daily Sentinel,"" much to the chagrin of assistant editor in chief Mike Axford (Edward James Olmos). The articles catch the attention of Benjamin Chudnofsky (Waltz), a heartless Russian mobster who has control over all of the city's crime families. If you know what's good for you, you won't tell him he isn't scary, nor will you fumble pronouncing his name (an uncredited James Franco learns both lessons the hard way). Also alerted is Los Angeles District Attorney Frank Scalon (David Harbour), whose efforts to rid the city of crime have been undermined by The Green Hornet.

I'm making this movie sound a lot better than it actually is. In the hands of Seth Rogen and director Michel Gondry, the fast-paced and entertaining plot is overshadowed by the jokey and immature antics of the main character, a man so thoroughly off putting that I found myself going against everything movies like this stand for and wishing his secret identity would be exposed. How often do we root for the sidekick instead of the hero? ""The Green Hornet"" makes it impossible to do otherwise; Kato is smarter, braver, more skilled, and way more charismatic than Britt ever was. What a mockery of character and tone. Rogen can be a good actor (see ""Funny People""), and he can also be a good writer (see ""The Simpsons"" episode ""Homer the Whopper""), but here, he errs, and he errs badly.",1294963200,5,4768,4.781553398058253
4434166,4,B004MYH08U,"That's right. It seems as if it is being forgotten why exactly we go to the movies... to be entertained. To go to a movie and watch it and have fun. Not every movie is meant to be Academy bait, and as much as I love a good Oscar bait flick as much as anyone, I also like to go to movies that are supposed to be brainless fun- after all, that's why I go to movies, right? As a form of scape. Ah, but it's not like the elitists know how to have fun anyway, because after all The Green Hornet- No me likey superheroes!!! Me likey psychotic lesbo ballerinas!!!!!

That said, I will admit I was a tad skeptical- I wasn't very immersed in the Green Hornet world as I did not grow up with it, but the trailer looked fun and I was excited to see it, so my buddy and I went and saw it today. And I walked out colored had-fun!!! Like I said, I knew absolutely nothing about Green Hornet when I went in, as I had went to see it not based on nostalgia but entertainment alone, and I got what I wanted- a fun old, funny, quality time at the cinema that was full of laughs and action. So maybe I lose credibility there as I wasn't a fan before the film. But now I can confirm that my childhood already good childhood would be MUCH better if I grew up with Green Hornet!!!

BrittReid has had a troubled relationship with his dad ever since he was a young one. Now grown up and an heir to his dad's newspaper The Daily Sentinel, he always thought his dad was a selfish jerk, and his dad being found dead from a supposed bee sting doesn't make it better. Being left the newspaper and meeting his coffee maker for the first time after firing him, named Kato, Britt is under pressure. But Britt and Kato begin to bond after Kato shows some of the 'wares, and one night after stealing the head of the golden statue of his dad and kicking some butt, they decide with Kato's technology and Britt's motivation- it's time to be superheroes.

But they aren't the superheroes you'd wake up every Saturday morning and tune to your cartoon channel to watch. No, they are way different. They protect the law... by breaking it. Furthermore, the Sentinel dons them the name ""The Green Hornet"", and they find a villain- Chudnofsky, a man with a hard name to pronounce, who is a Russian mobster who plans to bring together LA's mob families.... and the man that Britt's dad was planning to expose!!!

I will say one more time that I am surprised that we've forgotten how to have a good time at the cinema! Sure this film isn't going to win any Oscars and bait gleaming reviews from the critics- one particular offender being Roger Ebert. But then again I stopped taking him seriously years ago, so not much I can do there, besides he gave Country Strong a positive review. This film is fun, and what's all you need to expect!

It's full of action. It's full of thrills. It is overexaggerated and it's unrealistic as hell. But that's the point! It's a superhero movie people. None of you complained when in The Dark Knight, Batman fell a great height from the party in the building, survived without a broken bone. The action scenes are awesomely well done, with great use of slo-mo, and even in 3D, the ""Kato-vision"" scenes looked awesome. The fight scene in the middle between Kato and Britt that goes on and on was probably the funniest scene, as you'd expect to get tired, but it just gets funnier and more ridiculous as it goes on.

So overall, if yo have a brain you are willing to turn off for 2 hours and just sit back and enjoy pure fun, you will enjoy the Green Hornet. My only quibble is that there wasn't enough Christoph Waltz, but then again, I had tonnes of fun- too much to care about that, so I ain't complaining there. Just go and watch and have fun, as this is a great start to the new year's movie season, and a must see for belly laughs, action and quality dialogue.

Oh, and you will believe a car can drive when it's split in half!",1294963200,4,3920,4.274932614555256
4434167,3,B004MYH08U,"First Impressions:

The Green Hornet is based on the original radio serials of the 1930s, predating Batman, yet has enough similarity to make audiences get in tune.

This movie was a lot of fun for the most part -- millionaire playboy whose Dad (and now Britt) works at the Daily Sentinel, and has a partner (Jay Chau, Kato) and pretends he is a criminal when he is actually fighting crime.

On the Radio:

So far, this aligns well with the radio show (except Kato in the radio show was Filipino -- but I digress), except the radio show was straight and this is a comedy. Seth Rogen as the Green Hornet is also the executive producer and the co-screenwriter so this is clearly his baby.

I loved the fast cars, the incredible skill of Kato and the egocentric jerk that is Britt Ried! His egomania really gets on Kato's goat and they fight it out with each other -- a slapstick fight that was a bit boring I must admit.

Lenore Love Interest:

Catherine Diaz plays the secretary who through her criminology knowledge actually unwittingly helping them out with her explanation of gang profile. The subplot of a love triangle was not played up which is fine, since that was not the main theme anyway!

The bad guy wants to control all of LA crime. He is paranoid and lives on a trigger. This guy is bloodthirsty and has no qualms about killing people who disagree with him.

The impossible stunts, the over-the-top action and the crazy situations the Hornet and Kato get into is just as goofy a comic book-like movie as you can see. There's even panel shots!

If you liked other similar films such as Rush Hour or even Lethal Weapon.

End Credits Worth the Price!

The ending credits play the original Green Hornet theme as composed by Billy May back in the 1930s, and we even listen to the singing of Jay Chau (Kato). Recommended for older teens and adults due to the over-the-top death by car and the gross methods of accidental and purposeful death!

Fun film! A nod to Bruce Lee and coffee baristas everywhere, LOL!

Michel Gondry (""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"") directing from a screenplay by star Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg based on the radio series created by George W. Trendle. The movie is played purely for laughs and should be taken that way.",1294963200,,2262,4.566831683168317
4434168,4,B004MYH08U,"The Green Hornet seemed like it was fighting an uphill battle as soon as it went into development. Most projects that were either influenced by Bruce Lee or are trying to continue a story he started just turn out to have disappointing and unfortunate results. The Green Hornet lost Stephen Chow shortly after it was announced he would direct and star in the film while many didn't think Seth Rogen was the type of guy who could do an action film. The main villain role was originally intended for Nicolas Cage before he eventually dropped out. With its release continually being pushed back and critic and early screening reception being practically nonexistent many wondered if The Green Hornet could just pull off not being a total disaster. Despite all of its issues, The Green Hornet is actually an extremely humorous and entertaining thrill ride.

Stephen Chow was replaced with Michel Gondry (Eternal Sunsine of the Spotless Mind, Be Kind Rewind) and his unusually artistic and spectacular visual style does get put on display on more than one occasion. Two of Kato's fight sequences, Britt's thought process in the Chinese restaurant, and the screen being split into multiple segments after a bounty is put on The Green Hornet's head are all great examples. Gondry usually manipulates scenes in extraordinary ways. In Kato's fight scenes, one car suddenly becomes a dozen while floating heads transition one scene to the next while Britt is in the restaurant. The great thing is his style works really well within the world of The Green Hornet.

The cast is a serious plus, as well. Seth Rogen brings a lot of the comedy he's become associated with, but juggles the action aspect fairly well. Rogen isn't exactly a stranger to action as Pineapple Express had its fair share of it. I seriously loved Pineapple Express, so him being The Green Hornet wasn't as bothersome to me as it was to others. Jay Chou is no Bruce Lee, but he's an entertaining Kato nonetheless. There were a few smaller roles that are worth keeping an eye out for. Edward Furlong is around long enough for you to say to yourself, ""Wasn't that the kid from Terminator 2 and American History X?"" Indeed it was, sir or madam. Indeed it was. James Franco shows up and gives a hell of a speech, as well. After seeing him in something like 127 Hours, it's amazing seeing him not only jump back and forth between genres but give such exceptional performances in everything he's a part of. Then there's Christoph Waltz whose Chudnofsky character seems to be just as fun as Colonel Hans Landa from Inglourious Basterds. Chudnofsky is funny in a twisted kind of way, maniacal, and misunderstood by everyone around him while Waltz seems to slip into the character with ease.

One of the more interesting and unexpected aspects of the film was the way certain things in the film were connected. Only the simpler things seem to come to mind now; Britt being interested in saving people at an early age, how The Green Hornet name comes to fruition, the one thing Kato can't do, and DA Scanlon's true motives. It all just comes together really nicely while little things are connected to the big picture and revealed later on. The Green Hornet isn't the best written piece of film, but everything flows really well and is put together in a way that'll surprise many who expect this to be nothing more than popcorn entertainment. There's even a brief nod to Bruce Lee in there.

If you hadn't noticed, Cameron Diaz has yet to be mentioned in this review. While her character is important to the storyline, Diaz isn't. Anybody could have filled her shoes. When she first shows up on screen, the woman next to me said out loud, ""What's she doing here?"" It was pretty hilarious since I was pretty much thinking the same thing. She doesn't have much screen time either. Christoph Waltz was around more yet she received top billing after Rogen and Chou. It just seems kinda weak even if she is the bigger star.

The film gets kind of rough towards the end though when it comes to special effects. While certain ridiculous things are shown in a light that almost make some of them seem feasible, the CG and green screen work is really noticeable during the conclusion of the story. It doesn't necessarily ruin the film, but it hurts it a little.

The Green Hornet is really a hell of a way to kick off the new year as far as movies go. It's an amusing and exhilarating thrill ride from beginning to end while its solid and well-rounded cast in addition to the film having a surprisingly well-written storyline is just icing on the cake. The Green Hornet is just a fun film that can pretty much be recommended to anyone. So the next time someone asks if The Green Hornet is actually a good film, be sure you reply by saying, ""That's a bingo!"" (sorry, I had to)",1294963200,4,4814,4.657647058823529
4434169,2,B004MYH08U,"Roger Ebert warned me, but as a six year old I used to love The Green Hornet TV show. I thrilled to the then inexplicable to me fighting of Bruce Lee, and there were a lot of explosions and fights. So, I wanted to like this movie and went to see it despite Roger Eberts' printed warning.

""The Green Hornet"" is the story of pampered party boy Britt Reid (Seth Rogen) who has an over-achieving father, James Reid (Tom Wilkinson), who is the owner of The Daily Sentinel, a newspaper that crusades against crime in Los Angeles. After the death of his father, Reid meets his father's mechanic and cappuccino maker Kato (Jay Chou). After getting drunk, Reid and Kato decide to vandalize the grave of Reid's father and in doing so inadvertently create The Green Hornet, and from there Reid decides to follow through and become the hero he feels resides within him.

Seth Rogen has to take a lot of the wrap for ""The Green Hornet"" as he produced and wrote the movie. Rogen makes the same mistake other movies have in bringing other 60's-70's TV shows to the big screen, they play up the camp in the shows instead of playing it straight with concept. Yes, ""The Green Hornet"" TV show was a bit campy in its day, it was produced by the same people who produced the ""Batman"" TV show. Rogen plays Britt Reid/The Green Hornet as a petty, jealous, vindictive adolescent, no, more like juvenile, and has him scurrying back and forth over the front seat of the black beauty more like Bluto from ""Animal House"" than a hero. Rogen should have watched ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" while writing this movie, and he would have been a lot closer to the tone of the movie he should have been looking for.

As a writer, Rogen's dialog is stilted and flat, and in places he has to throw in a chunk of exposition to explain who a character is to the audience, as when Mike Axford (Edward James Olmos) has to explain to Reid ""I was your father's trusted advisor for 45 years."" Reid doesn't know this?

Jay Chou's Kato truly doesn't need this Britt Reid and is the more interesting, and strangely enough the more fleshed out character. Kato is a mechanical genius building the fortified car ""The Black Beauty"" for Reid. And Kato has to keep rescuing Reid from the gangsters he's trying to foil. The Kato Show would have made a better movie. Cameron Diaz plays Lenore Case, Britt Reid's trusted assistant at The Daily Sentinel. While the script hints that Diaz' character could be more integral to ""The Green Hornet's"" crime fighting abilities than other female foils to superheroes she really is only given a few scenes to work with and those are mostly used to fight off the lecherous advances of Rogen's Britt Reid.

The lack of story doesn't allow for any emotional investment in either the characters or the plot so when the action scenes come along they're fairly routine and seem to string along the movie until the next plot point needs to be brought up. Lest anyone thinks I'm expecting too much from a movie with action. I noticed that some kids about 12 years old who were sitting near me were texting during the climatic chase scene.

If you want to see ""The Green Hornet"" you will do better if you watch one of the marathon's airing the 60's ""Green Hornet"" TV show in conjunction with the release of this movie.",1294963200,6,3304,4.535234899328859
4434170,2,B004MYH08U,"Green Hornet, the newest DC franchise to appear on the big screen, is some seriously lowbrow fare.  Written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, this plays more like The Three (ok, Two) Stooges than anything.

Britt Reid (Rogen) is heir to his father's newspaper/media empire.  Growing up estranged from his father Britt becomes a total party-animal, living completely in the moment.  The sudden death of his father leaves him questioning the direction of his life.  A meeting with Kato (Chou)- his father's personal mechanic who is much more than he seems- cements his new outlook and the two form a partnership to give meaning to their lives and help the citizens of L.A.  By posing as villains they'll be able to confront criminals on their own terms.  Initially successful, their scheme runs into serious trouble when they go up against aging Russian gangster Chudnofsky (Waltz), who's having his own identity crisis and is trying to reinvent himself while consolidating the underworld under his authority.

This movie is lots of noise, explosions and foolishness.  You understand why it was plagued with so many problems since it never really seems to know what it's doing.  I'm not saying that Green Hornet has to be like Batman Begins or anything, but this is just plain dumb.  Rogen's Britt Reid character is completely expendable; other than being the rich guy who can pay for everything he's useless, only good for one-liners and general goofiness.  Whereas much like the tv show Kato literally does everything- he creates the weapons, kicks everyone's behind and tricks out the car.  Heck, by the end of the movie he even installed nano-technology into the damn thing!  During all this Reid repeatedly gets his butt kicked and talks smack.  Seth Rogen wrote a movie where there's no reason for his own character. That should tell you something right there.

Christoph Waltz as Chudnofsky is the best thing in the movie.  From the outset you can almost see him trying not to smile while delivering his lines- his character is funny and actually pretty sympathetic for a while.  Jay Chou's Kato is ok, but there's no explanation for his skills; as an orphan from the streets of Shanghai he's practically Batman without the cape.  Cameron Diaz is here in name only; though her character plays a role in unfolding the plot Diaz herself doesn't add anything to the proceedings. Since she's there just for box office her part could've been played by Kim Kardashian for what it's worth.  Yeah, I said it!

Green Hornet is a stupid mess of a movie.  There's really not a lot to add other than two hours of this crud is way too long.  A typical 90-minute action-comedy with b.s., bullets and explosions would've been much better.  Just let this one buzz on by.",1294876800,4,2758,4.844017094017094
4434171,4,B004MYH08U,"What's not to like about The Green Hornet? Yes: a rhetorical question.

Well, it's big, it's loud, it's daft, it's funny and it's utterly preposterous. Will you, if you're a normally adjusted adult, be entertained? Yes, you will.

Seth Rogen, as you'd expect a seasoned stand-up to, aces every line for comic effect in his performance as Britt Reid, millionaire newspaper heir and crime-fighting party animal. He has a barista black-belt, martial arts-toting sidekick called Kato with a garage full of bad-ass souped up Camaros (pedants: they're Chrysler Imperials, but they *sound* like Camaros, and I want one - with or without rocket launchers). Indeed, Kato is so competent that he presents a plot dilemma: Why does he even need the Green Hornet in the first place? He can do Bruce Lee's one inch punch. He can design sports cars. He even knows how to make those funny fern leaves in the froth on a cappuccino. And he shows us: bonus.

The film also boasts Cameron Diaz, with all that implies including, as her standard terms and conditions of engagement apparently demand, an entry in which she winsomely sashays in and wallops the camera with a shameless ""it's me! Cutesie Cameron Diaz!"" gurn. The producers failed to accompany this, as their contractual obligations surely require, with Gary Wright's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dream-Weaver/dp/B000002KFV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dream Weaver</a>, which no doubt led to some anxious exchanges with her agents and lawyers when they saw the rushes. Still, comedy was extracted (bravely, from Diaz' perspective) from the fact that her character, at the tender age of 36, is knocking on a bit. (Diaz is 38!). But not to the point where more couldn't be extracted from Rogen's covetous glances at her backside.

Yet at the same time The Green Hornet has a body count, some cheerily gruesome deaths and a wanton demolition quotient that reaches back in time past Bruce Willis'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Hard/dp/B000W4HIY0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Hard</a>&nbsp;franchise and yearns for mid-eighties Arnie Schwarzenegger prime carnage. So: it will definitely go over well with the boy racers and even the rest of the cinema-going constituency would have to be a bit churlish not to be swept along. Which isn't to say some of them won't be.

There is, of course, stuff not to like, but much of that falls squarely in the sour-puss cinema snob category. But here it is, for the record:

Firstly, the film has evidently had a difficult midwifery. It has been optioned on and off since 1990 and has had more directors, producers, screenwriters and actors ""associated with the project"", many walking out as a result of ""creative differences"", than most films not directed by Alan Smithee, and even the release of this final version seems to have been plagued by delays (who orchestrates the global release of a film a week after schools have gone back in January? Were they that scared of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tron-Legacy/dp/B0037KMHRY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tron Legacy</a>?)

Furthermore - and yes, this is a pet, well, bee in my bonnet but I'm going to say it anyway - this film is in 3D and it absolutely shouldn't be, save for the closing credits and one classy Brian De Palma-style split screen sequence when, oddly, each ""screenlet"" was actually in 2D, just arrayed differently in 3D space. Otherwise, there really wasn't much call for, or use of, 3D, and it didn't look much good, to the point where I wondered whether it was added in post production, a la the train wreck that was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Airbender/dp/B002VPE1BQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Airbender</a>. A subsequent browsing of the blogosphere would suggest this is indeed the case.

There's also the possibility that venerable superhero lore is being permanently trashed here. The original Green Hornet radio series is ancient: it predates Superman by a couple of years and, from what I can tell, it was rather earnest fare with less enduring legacy than Superman, and this big budget farce, which upends it in every conceivable way, may consign it forever to oblivion. A more reverend take may have been more interesting: Even the 1960s TV series, in which Kato was played by a young Bruce Lee, might have been a better setting (opening up the possibilities of some Mad Men styling) than the rather dull, present day. Indeed, modern technology presents some plot difficulties with which the screenwriters failed to adequately deal: armed with the critical MacGuffin, a USB drive full of incriminating evidence, our heroes race across town, batman style, to their newspaper offices to post it to the internet. Er, come again? You have a custom built rocket propelled car, but you don't have wifi?)

In any case, it sounds as though every possible approach has been tried and rejected, and at the end of the day what we're left with is a pretty entertaining night at the movies. And that, I dare say, is what the Studio was aiming for. Rogen was candid enough about that on the red carpet in Los Angeles this evening: Asked if there would be a sequel he said, ""I would definitely be open to it, but until the movie makes a lot of money we haven't really thought about that"".

Remains to be seen. But well worth a look in the mean time, if you need cheering up on a cold January day.

4434266,5,B004MYH08U,"First  I will mention that I never give any spoilers in my reviews!

I need to start off by saying that I truly enjoyed this movie, and actually more than I thought I would. However I must also menton that if you're an old schooler and are familiar with the original show starring Van Williams playing as Britt Reid and Bruce Lee playing as Kato, then you are in for a completely different atmosphere with this movie. The characters act completely different than thier past counterparts from decades ago. But given that fact, I would say that it has been brought up to date, and has also done a good job of giving us a superb feel of what the Green Hornet is supposed to be about.

What I really enjoyed most in this film was the scientific creations of Kato's and his ability to create some gadgets that made me go 'Wow'. It had that feel of believability that totally engrossed me, and made me think to myself 'what if we could really do that'! I personally like those kinds of movies that make me feel like a little kid galavanting through a toy store. However, there were a couple scenes that were not realistiic at all, such as when the vehicles travelled at unrealitic speeds and cornered like they were on rails. We could have done without those added effects that are not possible. I say stick to the believeable effects that really make a person wonder 'what if'.

As for the special effects, they were done with good taste and not over the top as some more recent films are. The CGI was done well and not 'too busy'. Some movies are just hard to watch, and you end up missing half of what you could have seen because of the overdone CGI, but not this film, as most all of the CGI was done tastefully. Plus I really enjoyed the fact that the better part of the movie was not in CGI, and alot of the effects were actually done using camera effects instead of a computer. I think that this made it an easier film to view without making me feel I missed a good portion of what I had just watched.
As for the 3D, I have a nice 3D TV which does a superb job at rendering a 3D image, and is actually one of the better available to home consumers. But, there really were only a few great shots done in 3D. The rest was just OK. Some films are actually shot/filmed with 3D cameras so that the end result is a movie that has the feel of a 'real' 3D movie. However this movie was not filmed using a 3D camera. The Green Hornet is one of the infamous ""3D conversions"" that studios have been pumping out of late. One of , if not the best 3D conversions available is 'Alice', and well I have to say that this conversion to 3D is not near as good as Alice was done. The 3D has a few interlacing problems here and there which makes some scenes hard to watch. But all in all worth a watch in 3D if you have the capability to do so. But please keep in mind that not all 3D TV's were made the same, and some 3D
 TV's are better at delivering a good 3D experience than others.

Would I purchase this film again, a solid and resounding YES. I enjoyed this rendition of ""The Green Hornet"" and I found it quite entertaining and a good watch!",1482710400,7,3128,4.196339434276206

4434295,3,B004MYH08U,"I know, it was pretty hard for me to imagine Seth Rogan as a superhero too, but as it turns out things aren't exactly as they appear. In this 2011 re-imaging of the series, Rogan play Britt Reid, the son of a billionaire publisher, who (surprise surprise) is a big time party animal, with no real ambition in life. When his father passes away suddenly, Reid is given this huge empire to run and with no idea how to do it, he starts to lean on the people around him, people like Kato (Jay Chou). Reid knew Kato for years, but knew nothing of what he could create and nothing of the skills he was capable of. With Kato's help, Reid decided to take on crime in the city, only one problem, he sucks at it. This film may be the most evenly scored film I've ever reviewed, because I can honestly say my like and dislikes were exactly fifty-fifty, most notably were the cast. Seth Rogan in the right setting is brilliant and in the wrong setting is just annoying as hell, with that hardly laugh and his never taking anything seriously, it is perhaps never more abundantly apparent as it is here. Cameron Diaz also adds nothing to the cast, but name recognition and a lazy one sided performance. On the other hand, Jay Chou was fantastic as Kato, he was clever, funny, exciting, and in my opinion he made this movie, it simply isn't a superhero film with him. Then there is Christoph Waltz, the man with the mesmerizing voice who forever capture our attention in Inglorious Bastards, and has been the quintessential bad guy in everything since. The bottom line is the new Green Hornet isn't without it's problems, but the story here is better than I expected it to be, there are some stand outs among the cast, and the special effects and fight scenes were hit or miss. This is the kind of film you'll be into or you won't. Just like my list, audiences are going to be fifty-fifty on the one as well.",1476316800,,1892,4.3931623931623935

Well, it just so happens that Kato is a master of martial arts, along with being an expert mechanic and chemist. So, with the bumbling Reid in tow, the masterful Kato set out to do good. But, theres a bad guy out there, who doesnt like the Green Hornet (strangely enough, no one ever sees Kato) messing with his running of L.A., and he wants the man dead. Now its up to Kato to keep Reid alive and bring the bad guy down...if he can!

OK, as you can tell from the above summary, the makers of this movie really set out to turn the Green Hornet story on its head...and I don't know why. Their weird take on the Green Hornet is not particularly interesting or even all that entertaining. Seth Rogen and his character are so unlikeable, that you really don't care much if he lives or dies. And thats really sad. Indeed, its what squashed the movie, and made a sequel unthinkable.

But, having said all that, I still liked the film. Jay Chou effectively carries this movie on his back, bringing in a very good performance. Also, the action is really exciting, while the visuals are nothing short of superb.

So, while this movie is FAR from being what it could have been, it is nonetheless a fun and entertaining romp. If you like a funny, off-beat action movie, then I think that you will like this take on the Green Hornet...just don't expect too much.",1469836800,,1519,4.379432624113475

The problem is completely the director's--he seems to have taken a one take approach, where anything is acceptable, and looks like he must have been in the bathroom most of the time, rather than overseeing the production.

4434337,2,B004MYH08U,"Created for radio in the 1930s and adapted for television
in 1966, The Green Hornet has had a rather popular run
with generations of audiences.  When the series was brought
to television it was done so off the back of ABC's very popular
BATMAN series, though it was soon apparent that lightning would
not strike twice and the show ended up lasting for only a
single season.

Director Kevin Smith originally took interest in making
a film version of The Green Hornet nearly a decade ago
but the project somehow ended up in the hands of Seth
Rogan and Evan Goldberg who wrote the script and brought
it to Sony.

One may think it kind of odd that this film ever was
""greenlit"" for motion picture production, that is, until you
consider that the characters are not licensed by Marvel
and that the studio probably saw this as a cheap opportunity
to cash in on a super hero film.

...and ""cheap"" is exactly what you get in this rather
boorish film that gets off the ground running and then
falls completely flat before the film's mid-point where
things just become loud and clumsy.

The Green Hornet follows the exploits of Britt Reid (Seth
Rogan), a spoiled playboy who suddenly inherits his
father's wealthy media empire which includes the Daily
Sentinel Newspaper.  Living alone in a huge mansion,
Reid befriends his father's mechanic, Kato (Jay Chou),
a martial-arts expert who has a knack for creating elaborate
gadgets -- most of which can be found in a tricked-out,
souped-up 1965 Chrysler parked in the garage and dubbed
the name, ""Black Beauty.""

Upon thwarting a robbery, the two realize that they could
do some good for the crime-rampant city of Los Angeles by
becoming crime fighters.  What ensues is a bunch of wannabees
taking on the entire Los Angels crime syndicate headed
up by a villain by the name of Chudnofsky (Christoh Waltz).

As you sit and watch the opening moments of The Green Hornet,
you get the feeling that you might actually be in for the ride
of your life.  The film starts off most promisingly with a terrific
scene involving James Franco as a crime boss who faces off
against Christoph Waltz.  Waltz's presence in this scene is
very reminiscent of his role of Col. Hans Landa in Inglorious
Basterds.  However, once Seth Rogan and Jay Chou hit the
screen, you realize the film has nowhere to go but down.
The two actors are so entirely mismatched and have nothing
to rely on other than Rogan's lifeless dialogue which is void
of any humor whatsoever.  And poor Christoph Waltz -- the
Academy-Award winning actor's talents are entirely wasted
as he is reduced to a role of a buffoon.  By film's end, it
seems that a script absent of fresh ideas resorts to throwing
in the kitchen sink withon an obnoxious over-the-top car
chase sequence.

The Green Hornet was not originally intended nor shot for 3D.
That means all the upconversion was done in post-production.
With that in mind, I was still rather pleasantly surprised at the
results.  The film definitely has a cardboard cutout feel to it  --
where you get the sense that you can reach in and move
various objects around the screen.  Most of the film is based
on CGI effects, all of which is nicely enhanced in 3D.  A car
explosion in the first few minutes of the film features falling
flames and rising smoke that really defines the depth between
background and foreground. The drawback to the upconversion
is that nothing ever really leaps off the screen at the viewer.
When watching scenes that involve splashing water -- the
spattering of sparks -- or the spray of bullets towards the
viewer, the effects work suddenly stop short of spilling out
of the screen.  Most of the film takes place in dark L.A. street
settings, despite which, ghosting is just about nonexistent.

Sony has provided us with a beautiful transfer that provides
stunning imagery for the left and right eye.  This is as pristine
a transfer as anyone could expect with definition and clarity
that is unsurpassed.  It's flawless.  Colors are vibrant and
hues are persistently ""in check.""  Black levels are exceptional.
Take a look at Kato's hair, the couches in the office of The
Sentinal, or even ""Black Beauty"" to marvel at how rich the
blacks look here.

The transfer also sports a beefy 5.1 DTS-HD MA soundtrack
with fantastic dynamic range and an over-abundance of effect
noise, expertly mixed, that pans across the channels.  Although
I found the LFE bass to be a little weak to my liking, I still
consider this soundtrack to be demo material.

The Green Hornet comes packaged here in a combo-pack
that features 3D Blu-ray, 2D Blu-ray and DVD.  The Blu-ray
features a filmmaker's commentary and 3D animated storyboards.
The 2D Blu-ray carries the wealth of supplements that include
deleted scenes, a gag reel, and various featurettes and interviews.

If you feel that you really must watch The Green Hornet, be
prepared to invest as little emotion into it as possible.  This
dumb, pointless, noisy spectacle of a film never really knows
what it wants to do with itself.  The 3D imagery is decent, though
suffers somewhat from being done in post production.

If you are deciding between the 3D combo-pack or just
the Blu-ray, for the $5 difference, I would definitely recommend
the 3D version.",1453075200,,5250,4.7593818984547465

 This revival of a 1930s super hero has had some of the worst reviews that I have ever seen.  Atrocious, horrible and why was this stinker even made? come quickly to the pens of a number of critics.  Well, what so they know?  What I saw was a light, slight and slightly funny send up of the genre.
This is not the worst movie ever made, it just isn't much besides mildly diverting.  And the public agrees with me.  It has taken in a tasty $56 million worldwide in its first three days of release.  It is well on the way to repay the astonishing $130 million that the producers shelled out to make this movie.
 Seth Rogen wrote and stars in this car crash filled film.  There are more wrecked cars than in both of the Blues Brothers movies combined.  I particularly liked the innovative way the bad guys tried to off the Green Hornet and his oriental partner, Kato.  Lets just say that it involves huge cement trucks and a bulldozer.
 Rogen plays the spoiled son of a very successful news mogul.  He is not just unmotivated and lazy.  He is also as shallow as a puddle and frankly not very bright.  His sidekick Kato on the other hand is a genius at mechanics and swift and effective as a martial artist.  He does all the heavy lifting for the pair in every respect.  Kato has the best acting opportunities which Ray Chou exploits to his and our advantage.
 Poor Cameron Diaz is not given much to do, a shame for an actress with her comedic talent.  She is relegated to the role of providing the brains to the brawn of the two heroes.  It is she who must forestall and predict the moves of their very dangerous adversary.  Not much for a comedienne to work with.
 The film is a family friendly PG-13 with none of the language, skin or situational extravagances that we often see on the big screen.  It runs an hour and 48 minutes, which is long enough.  I saw the film in the traditional format but most people are choosing to watch it in 3D.  I doubt if the more exciting format improves the hollow scriptwriting.  We never really understand where the Diaz character comes from, for one thing.
 This is the biggest thing that director Michel Condry has done so far.  He did direct Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind which is well thought of.  The Green Hornet has exceeded the gross of his previous films in just three days.
 This two saw blade film is harmless fun for fans of all ages.  It isn't nearly as bad as some reviewers would lead you to believe.  Enjoy yourself and don't feel guilty about it.",1434844800,,2525,4.361290322580645

If I can give this film ZERO stars I would.  What an absolute pile of trash this movie is, & Seth Rogen is a horrible actor who both looks & acts like a total loser.

 When it comes to the topic of Bruce Lee I personally take that very seriously, and I found this film's description of the fantasy characters of the Green Hornet & Kato (portrayed like cartoon comedic morons) acting silly & dumb was disgraceful.  The Green Hornet and Kato, like Batman, are supposed to be portrayed as serious crime fighting characters, not like the three stooges.

 All of the late Bruce Lee's work, even including the original Green Hornet tv show, had been a serious insight into Martial Arts excellence.  Instead of finding a script that had a serious action movie tone, with a martial arts influence through the character of Kato, this film instead became a comedy on the Third Grade level.  These idiot film makers should have been fired, and replaced with people who understand the characters and the source material.

They should have made a film that attempted to live up to the level of the late Bruce Lee, with an example of a masterpiece in film making ""Enter the Dragon"".  They should have made a film where the Green Hornet & Kato where tough masked avengers on a mission to take on violent criminals using both their gadgets, their car, and their martial arts skills to bring the villains down.  But only toilet level activity happens in this film.

Irresponsible and party-it-up guy Britt Reid (Seth Rogen) is living the life as the son of the well-to-do publisher of The Daily Sentinel, but when his father is found dead after a fatal bee sting, Britts life is changed. Since he never liked his father, he goes to the cemetery and, meaning to sabotage his dads memorial, he and his dads mechanic, Kato (Jay Chou), end up saving a couple people from being mugged. Later, Britt convinces Kato that the two of them should pose as criminals so they could get close to real criminals and bust them.

Kato agrees and Britt adopts the identity of the Green Hornet. His target is Benjamin Chudnofsky, a Russian mob boss who is trying to unite the crime families in Los Angeles. Soon the Green Hornet and Kato find themselves neck-deep in the citys underworld.

Sometimes it takes a criminalor one posing as oneto catch a criminal.

I don't know, man. I was super jazzed when I found out they were making this movie because Im a big fan of the 1960s TV show starring Van Williams and Bruce Lee as the Green Hornet and Kato. I thought, hey, imagine doing an updated version where it could be a mob story with all sorts of intense drama, action and be a kind of Sin City, you know, with Green Hornet being an antihero and all?

Instead, I got a goofball comedy out of what was supposed to be a serious idea. I blame Seth Rogen, who I usually don't mind. He was one of the writers on this movie so obviously wrote to his strengths versus what the character was really about.

The costumes were cool, the action was fantastic, Chous martial arts was acesbut they got the Green Hornet wrong and took the gist of him and then did their own thing. Too bad. This really could have been a hit had they done the original series justice and then tweaked it for a modern audience.

Maybe sometime down the line theyll do another one and do it right. In the meantime, if a straight-up, not bad superhero movie is your thing, check it out, otherwise there are other lesser-known-superhero movies I enjoyed more like The Phantom and The Rocketeer.",1423008000,,2089,4.452879581151833

4434437,1,B004MYH08U,"old-time radio enthusiasts beware: this chaotic mess of a movie could not of been less faithful to it's source material if they'd presented the character as a kangaroo from outer space!!
even the plot bears only scant relation to the formula established on radio (and later carried on by the tv series starring Van Williams and Bruce Lee). the Britt Reid on the radio back in the day specialized in taking down corruption. his foes were dishonest politicians and racketeers ""just within the law."" here we get an over-the-top shoot-'em-up involving drug dealers straight out of a '70s ""Blaxploitation"" film. (okay, so they're white, but that doesn't make their methods any less derivative.)
they use the character's names but little else. the Britt Reid of old was an astute businessman befitting his day job as newspaper publisher, and a resourceful strategist befitting his extracurricular vigilantism. but sadly, as played by Seth Rogen (who also wrote this atrocity), he's an obnoxious spoiled-brat doofus who pretty much jumps in over his head for the adrenaline rush. he's one of those bozos who thinks he can endear himself with tiresome ""hipster"" banter, and his most readily apparent reason for getting into the superhero game is his euphoria at the death of his overbearing father.
and therein lies the foremost Achilles heel: this film has a thousand flaws, but it could have a billion more and still have some modicum of redeeming value if only it had given us a hero we could root for rather than one who made our skin crawl.
one of the most memorable characters on the radio series was Mike Axford. an ex-cop friend of his father's who ended up a Sentinel reporter (and Britt's unofficial bodyguard), the passionate Irishman was often the most engaging participant in the drama, bringing equal parts pathos and comic relief. here, alas, we get a wooden, caution advising authoritarian in the form of Edward James Olmos. (first he contributes to the bastardization of Battlestar Galactica, now this.) add to this ho-hum strait-lacedness his new job as Sentinel managing editor, and he in fact has more in common with the radio character of Gunnigan. (this is a twist of fate worthy of Rod Serling, because on radio Gunnigan was in fact Axford's nemesis.)
the most faithful characterization is Jay Chou's of Kato, the manservant-cum-mechanical genius who serves as sidekick. in a way he represents any viewer who might've already been familiar with the character: he tries to go along with the whole thing, to go against instinct and actually like this egomaniac, but finally gets frustrated and walks out.
and don't even get me started on secretary Lenore Case. once Britt Reid's ""girl Friday,"" here she's little more than a would-be love interest point of contention between Britt and Kato. on top of which she's played by Cameron Diaz, who has got to be the single goofiest-looking ""A-list"" actress in Hollywood history.
they say everyone loves a villain, but this film can't even fulfill that promise. Christoph Waltz plays a generic crime-lord named Chudnofski, who's only memorable character quirk is his quest for appropriately ""scary"" suit. (suit as in jacket and tie, not costume.) his one particularly amusing moment comes when he suggests he might wear red and change his name to ""Bloodnofski.""
of course, the true villain is the DA, Frank Scanlon (David Harbour), which you can see coming from miles away. this qualifies as a ""spoiler"" only if you've never seen a movie in your entire life.
to be fair, you have to understand what a film's goal is before you have the right to pass judgment. clearly, this one aspires to be a parody of the superhero subgenre of recent years. you might say it was trying to be Batman, with Seth Rogen as a latter-day Adam West. i can appreciate that as a comedy fan, but i can't respect a film that fails so miserably, that thinks it's so much cleverer than it turns out to be.
if nothing else, you'd think they could at least find room to mention the coolest thing about The Green Hornet, that the character is the great-grandnephew of The Lone Ranger! i've often thought it would make for a pretty cool movie to tell The Ranger's and The Hornet's stories concurrently, a' la The Godfather Part II. getting this debacle instead, now THAT'S what i call a bummer.",1421971200,3,4318,4.884196185286103

Wonderful visual style and good rapport between the two leading men.  The actor portraying Kato did nothing to embarrass himself and honored Bruce Lee's tradition.  Obviously Seth Rogen was an unconventional choice, but it was tailored to his skewed persona and truly didn't bother me.  I don't care for cookie cutter movies anyway.  Waltz was fine as the villain and Diaz is feisty as always.  I watched this on a plane and it made the time enjoyably go by.  Not a classic, by any means, but if you approach this as more of a ""Pink Panther"" move versus the traditional action and superhero fare, you can have a good time.",1412294400,,732,4.541984732824427

4434555,4,B004MYH08U,"Okay, so a gem of the 1960's was adapted in to this feature length film, which usually when something like this is done it gets hyped up, but to my surprise, this movie wasn't hyped up at all.

This film could go either way for pretty everyone; some love it, some hate it, and some don't care.
But as for myself, I thought it was awesome, not perfect, but still awesome.

The Green Hornet revolves around a rich guy and his intelligent assistant (No, Kato is not a sidekick).
These two go out, fight crime, but while they're blowing things to kingdom come, they're acting like bad guys, which on paper sounds stupid, but the way Seth Rogen breaks it down in the movie was great.

After seeing films like Kick Ass, you really look at a movie like this with new eyes. I saw it the first time a couple years ago, I was entertained, i watched it tonight and I thought it was bad ass. For example, after Hornet' and Kato take down their first group of badies, Hornet' makes a comment about how they should be superheroes; In Kick Ass, Dave asks why no one has ever considered being a superhero, and you know what, movies with these types of approaches just seem to work. And I like that.

Now this movie is in no way as good or even close to being as good as Kick Ass, but it is still a great Classic Adaption in it's own right, besides, you'd have thought this movie would suck after all this time, but no, it doesn't.

Oh and majorly important thing here; Christoph Waltz is in this movie, and he was awesome!
I usually always say that about all his performances, but hey, I can't tell a lie, so there that is.

And The Bottom Line is holding steady at a
75%- Stylish, Unique and Fun, The Green Hornet manages to be creative

If anything, Jay Chou (Kato) should've been the Hornet instead of Seth Rogan.  And speaking of Seth, I don't think he's a bad actor, but the script just made him look a hot mess.  Overall, if you haven't seen the flick, just skip it. You're not missing anything expect Jay Chou being bad ass.",1399420800,,543,4.38

The problem is obvious, those two disparate roles and movies fails completely. When Chou's eyes light up and he moves the movie moves, when his weapons fire they propel the action forward. When Rogen moves its like the old joke about a presidential movement report on SNL, just bad news.

Rogen is best as an impotent clown (as he was in the first part of the movie), but the move to hero????? No way.

  We see Britt Reid (Joshua Erenberg) as a boy, with his super hero toy, being taken to his father's office. His father (Tom Wilkinson) did not like him getting in trouble at school, so he grabs his son's Superman-like toy and breaks the head off.
  20 years later, Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz) is in a meeting to take over an underground company from Danny Crystal Cleer (James Franco) who is operating crystal meth. In order to take over the crime in Los Angeles (or make more), Chudnofsky wants his company. Danny gives him the rub, but Chudnofsky pulls out a double-barrel gun and shoots the thugs, then points the gun at Danny who is now scared to death.
  Meanwhile, Britt (Seth Rogen), now a man, has a good time with women in a mansion, but his father, still the abusive tyrant, goes into Britt's bedroom in the morning, throws his gormet coffee away from him and starts in on him again in front of his female guest.
  Later that day, Britt finds out on the television in his limousine, his father has passed away from a bee sting. Britt is now the heir of everything. The mansion, the cars, and the newspaper business. He fired everyone at the mansion, but when his coffee is not made perfectly, her realizes he has to re-hire Kato (Jay Chou). Kato is a genius, an inventor and is a great coffee maker.
 Later that night, when Kato saves Britt's life from the hoods, he sees that Kato has special powers and is very experienced in martial arts.
 The Green Hornet is created and Britt wants to take over the crime in Los Angeles.

Also in the cast: Edward James Olmos, Cameron Diaz, David Harbour, Edward Furlong.  Lu Parker from KTLA 5 appears as a news anchor on television.

I didn't even run to rent this, but found myself with a free rental and nothing else looked interesting that I hadn't seen yet.

To my surprise this film was very funny and even though purist will cringe at the liberties taken with the original story, this film is a refreshing goof on superhero films. First off, we have a hero who is delusional and so inept, that his ""sidekick"" is really the driving force behind all his power and intelligence. Kato played by scene chewing Jay Chou is the perfect balance for Rogen's flippant style and the two make for a very unconventional team, with a refreshing rapport that I haven't seen in these types of films before.

It was treated with a high level of respect, and with Bruce Lee as Kato it couldn't get any better.  We all had high hopes for a movie, at one point Jet Li was going to play Kato in a dead serious movie, but alas it never came to pass.  Then we get this comedy.  Ok some of the stunt work was superb, especially the car stuff at the end.  However the Green Hornet was never meant to be a joke, and thats what this movie is played as.

But eventually the cast and the audience both realize simultaneously that there's really no plot, and this movie just can't get serious enough to build any momentum.

I also have to severely question the casting of Jay Chou, who is so flat and boring that he makes Seth Rogen look charming and charismatic in comparison.

The movie is predictable if nothing else. SPOILER ALERT or not since the movie is predictable. Rich father, spoiled, rebellious son, father murdered, son gets his act together and revenges father's death, make amends with dead father. Seth Rogen plays the green hornet(and I use the term loosely)in the same manner as all of his other roles: the big, dorky goofball that's desperately searching for a way to be significant. His cartoonish voice and goofy facial expressions he used while playing Green Hornet never seemed to convince me he was a superhero and made Green Hornet seem more like a caricature than a character. He cnstantly whines throughout the movie and even admits in the movie that he is jealous of Kato(I didn't know super heroes were jealous of their sidekick). The slapstick comedy threw the movie into a different realm of bad. It was a strange movie with strange characters. The story line(s) didn't develop, Green hornet and Kato's friendship didn't develop, nor did the roles of good guy vs. bad guy develop.

Like when Bruce got stuffed in to the garbage can by one of the crazier villians on the show. Al films have this in them, some than others but this was atrocious. The only good thing was the car and that was blown out of proportion as well. Yes, I know there is no Bruce Lee around to fill in the gaps in this movies but even he couldn't have saved it.

4434730,5,B004MYH08U,"When I first saw the characters The Green Hornet and Kato, they were guest stars on the high-camp T.V. version of Batman from the 1960's. Bruce Lee played Kato, and then, as now, Kato steals the show, because he is the character with the best martial arts.

What people often don't know is that when the Green Hornet hit the Television screen, Bruce Lee always showed up the Green Hornet simply because Bruce Lee was THE martial artist and no one in Hollywood at the time was except for a very few who were taught by Bruce Lee. (No other martial artist would teach their disciplines to people outside the Asian community except for Bruce Lee.) In Hong Kong, because of Bruce Lee's martial arts mastery, the show was dubbed, ""The Kato Show.""

So the relationship between the Green Hornet and Kato has always been Playboy wannabe with follow-up masterful sidekick.

In television days, Kato was a servant in a rich household, and he was a man's man to the guy who becomes the Green Hornet. In this movie, it is updated. Kato is no longer a servant, but he does work for the mansion in a low-paid job of servitude, which he puts his whole self into: making a perfect cappuchino. Playboy Green Hornet wants him back after his dad fires him, and finds out that Kato is a genius maker and electronics engineer. They both go out and do good deeds and dubious stunts, then to try to fight crime by becoming questionable heroes themselves. Kato does most all the work, and Green Hornet takes all the glory.

But in all this, there is a lot of campy dialogue and action that fits this combination of millionaire playboy and creative genius martial artist.

The issue here is; Seth Rogan and the movie plot. Obviously Seth Rogan either never saw the original series, or he just likes to pervert a Classic.

Jay Chou has presence and is a decent actor. He Steals the show but other than that, the fat arrogant "" Bitch-Boy "" Seth Rogan totally ruins the movie. Jay Chou has class and should never act again with the immature little boy Seth. Jay Chou isn't Bruce Lee but he'll do in a pinch.

I remember the original actors as having a lot of class and they never, never, ever had arguments or fought with each other, nor did the Green Hornet ever talk down to Kato as Seth Rogan does numerous times in this movie, to Jay Chou, the Kato character in this movie.

For those of you who have never seen the series, there is a fairly new T.V. channel that shows old classics, "" MeTV "" and they are currently showing "" The Green Hornet "" on Saturday Mornings.  If you want to watch a great classic from that time period, I recommend you watch it. You will enjoy it. Maybe Seth Rogan should watch it to learn something about  "" Class, Style and Great Acting "". Besides, if he had ever talked to Bruce Lee the way he does in his move, Bruce Lee would have handed him his head and his Lunch.

Seth Rogan is an immature little punk and has been since the first movie he ever appeared in. He figuratively SUCKS the life-blood out of this movie through his actions, his attitude and lack of acting skill.

I don't want others to have to waste a $ 20.00 bill, especially during these hard financial times.  It is not even worth giving it away for free, which is what I am going to do. THAT my friends, is what I think about this movie.

There are other good actors in this movie who wasted their time and acting skills to produce this rubbish. Maybe they needed money but I am sure there were other movies they could have worked in. With all the trash and rubbish that currently comes out of "" Holly-Weird "" these days, there doesn't seem to be any shortages, especially since they like to make so many re-makes, of re-makes, of remakes.

Seth Rogan should give up as an actor, he has NO CLASS or Acting Skill what so ever. He is a big fat baby who needs a pacifier shoved into his mouth.

Don't waste your money! Setting fire to a twenty dollar bill would make more sense.

This movie is a B-I-G  L-O-S-E-R  ! ! ! ... like Seth Rogan. Hey Seth ... Your Diaper needs changing !",1350432000,10,2688,4.22265625

That being said, the movie is O.K., but Jay Chou and the Black Beauty save this movie from being a total bomb. Even though Chou lacked the charisma of Bruce Lee, his Kato was a pleasant surprise. An excellent job was done with The Black Beauty. Loved the car in the series and it didn't disappoint in the movie! Seth Rogen and Cameron Diaz were woefully miscast as Britt Reid and Lenore Case. Years ago when I heard that The Green Hornet had gotten the go ahead, it was rumored that Greg Kinnear was going to be cast as Britt Reid. I don't know why he dropped out or was passed over but he would have made a better Green Hornet than Seth Rogen! Van Williams is THE prototype Green Hornet and they cast someone who was a total opposite of him. I'm sorry but who in the hell told Cameron Diaz that she was pretty and could act! They were wrong on both counts (the other miscast). They should have cast a gal with the exotic look of Wende Wagner. She played a low key and stable character, not like the hysterical character Diaz made her out to be. The actress that should have played Lenore Case, in my opinion, was Megan Fox. She has a similar look to Wende Wagner. The last thing is that they couldn't decide what type of movie to make. The Green Hornet is supposed to be very dark, with some low key humor, if any. The movie didn't do either one very well. Plus, I didn't like the political correctness creeping into the franchise with having The Green Hornet riding shotgun instead of the back seat, where is supposed to be. The only thing I can think that the reason the makers of the movie went in the opposite direction of the TV series is they didn't want it to be compared to the Batman movie franchise. The problem is now that they've made a mediocre movie that they've damaged the Green Hornet name badly enough, that another movie won't ever get made. Which is sad because I love The Green Hornet. I passed on my love of the old TV series to my daughter when we watched the show together when it came on F/X. She now loves Bruce Lee.

Originally Kato was Reid's trusted friend and ally and their relationship was quite solid.  Likewise the D.A. was Reid's ally and friend and together they used the guise of The Green Hornet to confuse and bring to justice many evil and dangerous people.  This movie makes you think that if it weren't for Kato nothing would've worked.  The two of them going out on some fraternity dare style adventure was frankly sickening.

This was not some seriouse crime fighting mystery film. It was a hero movie turned on it's side & 1 of the funniest comedys of the last 20 years. Britt Ried is a young spoiled rich kid partyer, not a mild mannerd person. He's dad dies & instead of being emotionaly driven to do some thing because of it, He doesn't care cause he hates his dad.

4434792,1,B004MYH08U,"The fact that I got this movie as a gift from a coworker who couldn't finish it herself should have told me something...

So anyhow. Green Hornet is a modern updating of the classic pulp detective franchise, although it owes more to the TV show with Bruce Lee than the older properties. Left with tons of free time, poor self esteem, and a chip on his shoulder that nobody who owns a Bugatti should possess, newspaper heir Britt Ried (Seth Rogan) teams up with his boffin mechanic and barrista (this is a surprisingly big plot point) Kato (Jay Chou). Armed with a bulletproof car and the fighting skills of a movie Chinese guy (outstanding) and a doughy comedian (horrible) they wage a two-man war on crime, mostly for kicks. Cameron Diaz is there too but as in all of her movies, contributes nothing of meaning.

The film itself is a pretty inoffensive buddy action comedy, and I might have enjoyed it except for three things:
-Bizarre Benny-Hill style under-cranking used during practically any long cut
-Seth Rogan
-The writing (which is like 50% part of the Seth Rogan element)

The Benny Hill-vision is self explanatory so I'll jump to Rogan. He is, as always, horrible- a bleating frat boy with the voice of a muppet, zero comic timing, and surprisingly bad posture for a professional actor. Rogan waddles around the film talking over other actors, blurting humorless non-sequiters, and generally trying to evince the sort of ""such an ass he's charming"" ambiance as Vince Vaughn. Mr. Rogan, I have watched Vince Vaughn movies, and you are no Vince Vaughn. Chou is an exact opposite to Rogan, a blank slate with no personality save for a subtly murderous aggression. This is actually not unfaithful to Bruce Lee in many ways, but since Chou has very little screen presence and all his fights are wirework and CG, the emulation is incomplete at best. The writing is poor because there is far too much of it for this kind of film. Characters take long roundabout ways to say everything they say, awkward pauses go on so long they stop being funny and start seeming accidental, and the less said about the villain's interminable waxing on bad guy fashion the better.

There are doubtlessly people who will love this movie with all their hearts- the very easily impressed, for instance, who feel that the awful delivery of this movie's terrible dialog is actually clever, or the very old who are happy that there IS a Green Hornet movie then go to sleep five minutes in. But if you want the experience of past Green Hornet material, skip this pile. And if you just want a flashy movie based on pulp characters, Alec Baldwin's The Shadow or even Billy Zane's The Phantom (Slam Evil!) will both serve you better.

PROS
-There's a scene where Kato is making coffee and Jay Chou's stunt hands (apparently Mr. Chou cannot make espresso and couldn't be bothered to learn) show you how to make a sweet leaf pattern in the top with cream.
-The film ends at some point.

CONS
-Horrible acting and punishing dialog are murderous to endure.
-Seth Rogan is puppy-kicking unappealing and therefore a poor choice for the eponymous hero of the film.
-Kato's kung-fu sequences which should be a high point are instead silly music videos in which cables flail Mr. Chou at a bunch of stuntmen.
-You will guess every plot twist 120 minutes before it occurs. That's right, if you GUESS how the whole film goes right before you watch it, you will already know everything that happens.

THINGS TO WATCH FOR
-The late Mister Ried owns a car collection far in excess of what the owner of a single local paper could probably afford. Especially noteworthy is a scene in which Rogan systematically makes out with a party girl in every car in the garage, yet shies away from doing the deed in a Veyron. One assumes that there is simply no insurance that covers Seth Rogan defiling a 1.5 million dollar supercar (and wisely so).
-Kato goes overboard with the secret identity stuff. Like WAY overboard. His crime fighting car is hidden under and behind TWO OTHER PARKED CARS, a trick wall, and a hedge, and can still conceal all its weaponry. Note that he still gleefully wrecks it into cop cars and the environment at every opportunity.
-The villain has a trademark semi-automatic with two offset barrels. Neither seems to have an action of any kind, or a magazine. This is lampshaded when he mentions that it was ""really hard to build.""",1344124800,,4409,4.703367875647668

Seth Regan is at once ugly, awkward and without any true sense of nobility.  Well possibly toward the end he becomes a little noble. He does have one distinction-he is the first screen super hero to have some of his back teeth missing.  There is nothing else that makes this pic unique.

When the Green hornet was on television in the 1960's it lasted what one year a season actually not even. Why?

Cameron Diaz was somewhat pointless in it but she didn't do a terrible job. They made good joke at her expense in the middle which I thought was a good move.

If you can rent it for a buck somewhere it is worth that just to admire the various Black Beauty cars and then watch them get trashed.

There is this one scene where Rogen actually looks like the Green Hornet for about 25 seconds, but for the rest of the film he looks more like Lumpy Rutherford trying to play Wally Cleaver.

Sure, the film could have been much better, but that can be said for most films.  The fight scenes and chases are all well done and I'll watch it again for that.

I think about everyone involved in this is tremendously talented.  Even Rogen can write very well and has awards to prove it, but as an actor he is a character actor, not leading man material.  I'm thinking Rogen just lacks something here.

Then all of a sudden something hit me! Whatever it is Rogen lacked here, perhaps his character was actually supposed to lack it!  While I'm too young to remember the radio show, I was a huge fan of the old TV series in first run.  I vividly remember discussions about the show with friends who all talked either about Kato or the Black Beauty.  Hardly anyone thought TV's Britt Reid was especially cool.  The same thing is true here.  History repeats as Kato and the Black Beauty vehicles are the coolest things in the film.",1330732800,,1584,4.31864406779661

4434851,5,B004MYH08U,"To start off, I'm a huge comic book nerd. Also, somebody who thinks The Dark Knight should be the example for all superhero movies made from now on. I've seen every episode of the awesome Williams/Lee series, listened to quite a few of the radio shows, and quite possibly (in the darkest recess of my heart)like the Green Hornet character more than Batman. So believe me when I say I should definitely be one of those people who should of left the theater disappointed and angry.
 However, I left in a childlike state of glee. It captured some kind of essence, some kind of deja vu feeling of how it was like to want to be a costumed vigilante as I did as a child. That streak of fun and idiocy is so vibrant here. No hero flick has made me feel like this since perhaps the first Burton Batman. My buddy and I left buzzing about how realistic it would be to make a replica of the Beauty, how awesome Kato was, and saying ""Let's Roll, Kato"" whenever possible. I entered a 21 year old man, I left a 6 year old boy.
 Is the film a masterpiece? No. It's the stuff of which action blockbusters used to be made of. Fun, over the top, and yet serious enough to make it past the direct to video dreck. Honestly, had this come out in '87 along side something like Lethal Weapon it would've been a bigger hit. Perhaps that's the most apt analogy for this movie. A buddy cop flick for the comic book crowd.
 As for the blu ray, the film print is very nice and rich. Certainly looks as good, if not better, than when I saw it the theater. The extras are kinda disappointing. I would've really appreciated a really good Green Hornet retrospective  and perhaps an episode or two from the '66 series would've been great. The MOST irritating thing about the whole thing is the deleted scenes. I'm definitely spoiled by other dvd/blu rays that have post-production theatrical quality deleted scenes. All of theses are finished in most parts except the special effects. One in particular is especially jarring as Britt goes to flip up the Black Beauty, an obviously pasted in picture of a car pops up.
 Overall, not a bad time. Leave your expectations at the door and drop the attitude. It will serve you so much better in the long run with this movie. Well worth the price for the Blu-Ray.",1328572800,2,2272,4.4

With that out of the way - I was thoroughly entertained. Seth Rogen's character is unlikable, pathetic, and lacks for brains, but by the time the movie is over you want him to succeed because he really really...tries.

I found myself laughing at his ridiculous enthusiasms and it reminded me of the fantasies my friends and I would dream up while we were driving around aimlessly on a late Saturday night wondering what to do. In this movie, they act upon those fantasies and get in lots of trouble.

Any great movie has to have a great villain, and the crime lord here is just right for this movie. He is unlikable, pathetic, and lacks for brains.

I mean, I like Seth Rogen, he's a great comedian. But he fails when taking on the role of the Green Hornet. The original Green Hornet never whined about anything, was an awesome fighter, and knew how to handle things perfectly alone. Seth Rogen's Hornet is the complete opposite of that. But they did a good job in getting Kato's character right. The movie has a good sense of humor, like the scene where the Green Hornet & Kato get in a fight. That scene had me cracking up. Some of it is funny, but some of it isn't. I'd recommend this to anyone who has no history with the Green Hornet and/or loves anything with Seth Rogen in it. Hornet fans are going to HATE this and they should really avoid this at all costs. If you're a fan, you should go watch the 10 minute Green Hornet short film made in France, The 10 minute short does everything right that the movie failed to do.

The film has a lot going for it. It has decent production values, great action sequences, a serviceable plot, and creditable performances.

However, there are two things which put me off.

First, Seth Rogen's Green Hornet is just not very likeable. He is not heroic. He doesn't elicit even a little sympathy. He's an antihero, not a hero. Don't get me wrong; I don't mind heroes with flaws. But I want heroes I can root for and care about, not feel contempt for. The character does show some growth at the very end of the film but by then it is too late; the damage is done.

Second, the movie falls into the trap which many action comedies step into, it descends into self parody. Superhero films have to be played more or less straight. Any hint that the film makers aren't taking their premise seriously makes it really hard for the viewer to either.

For these reasons I doubt I'll be watching this one again anytime soon. Not as bad as some here make it out to be but disappointing overall.",1327276800,2,1097,4.410891089108911

Though I know next to nothing about the character, except that it was later made into a popular television series starring Van Williams and Bruce Lee-launching Mr. Lee into superstardom herre in the U.S.-I can say that this movie does NOT do justice to the series, though I remember little about it. My idea of the character, be it right or wrong, is that it's supposed to be a straight-up story with absolutely little to no comedy (and if there is humor, it should NOT be crass, crude or vulgar humor), no cursing and minimal, non-graphic violence with a solid story that has plenty of action, suspense and drama. And absolutely NOTHING over-the-top, ala this idiot Rogen or Robin Williams (though he mostly does comedies and when he does drama, he's strictly serious, which is the mark of a good actor). I do NOT recommend this movie. This is a film that screams, ""REMAKE."" But it HAS TO BE a good one, faithful to the character.",1327104000,,1084,4.474747474747475

Although I love superheroes and comics in general, I knew nothing about the Green Hornet when I hit the theater, and I absolutely loved it. Most of all, I loved Kato. I remember telling my friend that this sidekick finally managed to break all the stereotypes. He was no longer an asexual, lesser sucker-upper. I also know most men drool after Bruce Lee, but as a grown-up woman who never really quite managed to get into him, I have to say Jay Chou has all the charisma for which I had kept searching in Lee. This was by all means Chou's movie.
As a viewer without any canonic expectations, this movie had me laughing from beginning to end. It was a breath of fresh air and a break from a lot of superhero stereotyping. I came to Amazon quite decided to purchase it.
I would say, if you are an original fan, beware. It seems very unlikely that you will enjoy it.

4434880,5,B004MYH08U,I was interested in seeing this film remembering the prior work of the late Bruce Lee in the role of Kato.  Bruce was very good in the martial arts and onscreen presence.  Jay Chou was great in the role of Kato.  His onscreen presence was pretty impacting and did work well with Seth Rogen as the Green Hornet.  The film has good intensity and action and it flows well.,1323648000,,369,4.304347826086956
4434881,1,B004MYH08U,"The Green Hornet is an excellent and beloved comic book/graphic novel entity.  In the 60's, The Green Hornet was given life on the television screen thanks to producer Bill Dozier, who had success with the campy 60's Batman.  The 60's Green Hornet was played by the sexy and charismatic Van Williams.  His side-kick, Kato, was played by martial arts legend Bruce Lee.  This incarnation was iconic and by far and away the absolute best.

Hollywood has become so creatively dried up and barron that they constantly remake past successes.  Why is it everytime they remake something it seems like they endeavor to find the best ways to bastardize the original?

This incarnation of The Green Hornet does just that.  This film bastardizes everything that is great and heroic about The Green Hornet.  The character of Britt Reid, in this film, has the exact opposite dicotamy of the original character.  Reid, in this film, is an arrogant, spoiled, degenerate of a character who engages in meaningless promiscuous sexual encounters and sexually harasses his assistant. (Gee, that's original.)  He seems to have no moral compass, no perceivable intelligence.  Watching him is literally painful.

Cameron Diaz was cast as Reid's ever faithful assistant, Lenore Case (originally portrayed by Wende Wagner in the 60's).  All I can say about her is, ""Damn woman, you're 40! When are you gonna stop carrying on like you think you're still 20?""

The only good parts of this film are the casting of Jay Chou as Kato.  He's extremely talented, charismatic, and sexy.  He is the only member of the cast who even remotely embodies any part of the iconic character.  Tom Wilkinson and Christoph Waltz perform well in their roles.  However, the dialogue is cringe-worthy.

I don't know what possesed Warner Bros. to think that casting Seth Rogen in the lead and letting him write the screenplay would be a good idea.  Have they not seen the grotesque low-grade garbage he's starred in before?

I am so tired of seeing movies that star this off-beat douchebags like the Seth Rogens, the Jonah Hills, the Michael Ceras, and the Napoleon Dynamites.  It may have been funny in one film, two max.  Hello, It's NOT COOL ANYMORE!!

I saw this film when it premiered on Starz.  I tried to watch it objectively but had to shut it off after 30 minutes, just like another reviewer.  The film was literally painful to watch.  It is a travesty to comic book films, not that they have been on much of an upward move.  (Wait until The Dark Knight Rises, The Amazing Spider-man, and Man of Steel are released.  I wouldn't have too high hopes for them.  Especially if you've seen some of the images and video leaked on the web.)

I have never been so glad to NOT have spent money to watch a film in all my life.  The Green Hornet is a prime example of the oncoming death of the superhero film, especially if you keep letting people who made this train wreck make other comic book adaptations.

If you are thinking about buying this film, Save yourself the trouble and hit yourself with a hammer instead. That pain will eventually subside.  The pain of watching this film lasts forever.  I'm thinking about starting a support group with my therapist. LOL",1323561600,,3217,4.7644927536231885

Yes, I laughed a few times but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with taking comic book heroes and converting them into jokes.  And if you're going to do it, maybe a more anonymous hero(s) would work better.  In fact, how about ""Kick-Ass"" which is much better?  Anyway, this feature falls into familiar territory.  Short fights with plenty of adversaries, long fights that should have ended with 1 punch (Kato & Hornet) and a ridiculous finale that defies any reality.

The main problem is that Rogen's interpretation of the Britt Reid character is really a jerk. He is selfish, he drinks and curses too much, and he has a huge ego which contradicts the fact that he has zero accomplishments. His motives for becoming a superhero seem to be that he is bored and it would be cool not that he genuinely wants to help people. He is lazy yet he wants to take all of the credit from the hard working Kato. Clark Kent and Peter Parker are characters the fans root for and identify with- Rogan's Reid is not. I think you can mix comedy with superhero action but where this misses the mark is that it fails to present a hero that people can cheer on. The type of slacker jerk that Rogan portrays might have been funny as a supporting character such as a buddy or co worker of the main hero but as the hero, it fails. 2.5 Stars only.",1322956800,2,1093,4.23444976076555

People rarely criticize Steve Carrell when he does comedy/action movies, so why criticize Seth Rogan in exactly the same genre?? No, this is not an award-winning superhero movie. Yes, Seth plays a bumbling moron; but that's what makes this movie so fun! I love the juxaposition of the idiot Hornet and bad-@$$ Kato. No, it's not accurate to the comic books, but it is insanely funny. And the action in the movie was extremely well-done and creative.

4434913,4,B004MYH08U,"When the idea of `The Green Hornet' was born, I remember reading news on the production of the film and thinking that this was going to be amazing.  I kind of love Superhero films only because I grew up loving Superheroes and so to see my favorite characters on the big screen is a big deal for me.  Sadly, sometimes those films get weighed down by attempts to do too much or live up to such high expectations that they either shrivel up into wasted efforts or they are relegated to the closet as `satisfying fluff with no real memorable facet'.  There are some exceptions (`The Dark Knight', X2: United', `Spider-Man 2'; all of which set a bar VERY high) but they aren't the norm, especially when you consider the fact that Superhero movies are made by the handful every year.

Anyways, back to my initial thought.  I remember thinking that the idea of Seth Rogan playing the lead was an inspired move because he is SO not your typical Superhero, and I was getting tired of seeing Ryan `twelve-pack' Reynolds getting every Superhero gig out there.  Then you factor in Michael Gondry, who is awesome, Christolph Waltz, James Franco, Cameron Diaz and Tom Wilkinson, who I practically worship, and you have my appetite whet for sure.

Then the reviews poured in, the critics panned it and everyone I knew said it was awful.

I just, finally, had a chance to see this the other night and I'm baffled that this was disregarded as Superhero trash.  In fact, outside of the poorly conceived Kung-Fu scenes (I think people get so carried away with the 3D idea that they forget it still has to play out on a 2D screen) and the somewhat cluttered ending, this film was GREAT.

For me, this film soars because of two things.  First you have Seth Rogan.  I seriously think this guy is awesome.  Sure, he has his detractors, but I love his everyman humor and the way that he understands layering his `shmuck' characters with enough heart and warmth to make them truly likable (and in a believable way at that).  Here he plays a dejected son of an egomaniac who grows up without a mother and winds up squandering his potential by boozing it up with loose women in an attempt to get back at the father who never loved him.  Then his father dies and he has to take over the newspaper company he ran.  He is initially uninterested, but when he gets the chance to play `Superhero' (quite by accident) he sees that he can use his father's business to make his wildest dreams come true.  By becoming a Superhero (who poses as a villain to gain the upper hand on the real bad guys) he uncovers the truth behind his father's death and the truth behind the man he always regarded as a terrible human being.

I didn't mean to say all that without getting to the second reason this works, but then again, I don't think I'm done talking about Seth Rogan.  Seriously, he makes this movie work.  His humor is laced on every scene (he co-wrote the script) and it becomes a part of the fabric of the film.  The dialog is beyond quotable and infectiously entertaining, and that really keeps us glued.  It reminded me of the dialog for `Super 8' in that it was so sharp and witty that it, at most times, overrode the films construction issues.

The second reason this works is Michael Gondry.  His stylistic approach to filmmaking is used expertly here, but not in a way I initially expected.  Instead of fantasizing in a way that most would approach a Superhero film, Gondry scales back his visual inventiveness for a film that thrives on revisiting the nostalgic atmosphere of the pulp, crime noirs of yesteryear.  No, this is not a noir (by any means) but it has such visual presence and references that era nicely.  From the sets to the costumes to the score, this really embodied a strange sense of class that I wasn't expecting.  It was modern, sure, but it felt very old-fashioned and I think that was a good thing in an era so obsessed with outdoing the last `action film'.

Yes, I hated the way those slow motion action scenes were shot.  The scene where Britt and Kato have a fight in the house is far more entertaining because it is stripped of that gawky slow motion idea.  The use of 3D is too obvious to the 2D viewer (the bottle cap moment was ridiculous) and so it takes away from the actual film to a degree.  And yes, the conclusion was a tad cluttered (so much at one time) but it worked out in the end.

When all is said and done, I thoroughly enjoyed this.  For me, this was a nice diversion from the over-produced Superhero films clamoring for that `Special Effects' Oscar.",1319587200,,4564,4.478839177750907

The movie itself had me from the opening clip where a young Britt Reid comes reluctantly home to a stern, stone-faced and disapproving father, something I can all too well relate with. And as we flash forward twenty some years later, we get another glimpse into the dynamic between Britt and his Dad - strained. Kato's character is executed with playfulness and wit by Jay Chou, who instantly impresses with martial-arts excellence and a nerdy but flawless command of technology and gadgets.
From there, the movie just gets funnier by the minute! I won't say anything more as I don't want to ruin it for those who haven't seen this gem yet.",1318809600,,1035,4.630434782608695

I turned it off less than one minute into it because of the language.  I recognize Hollywood's belief that all movies have to have vulgar language to create realism.  I don't agree with it, but I do recognize it. The obligatory four letter word seems a must or it can not be a real movie. If I wanted realism, I wouldn't be watching a movie about a comic book super hero.  However, the language just in the opening scene is disgusting.
One reviewer mentioned 10 year olds.  I feel sorry for any parent who took their 10 year old to this and realized after it was too late what kind of language they would have to endure.  After about three sentences of dialogue, I turned it off and my wife thanked me.

The Green Hornet combines all that's awful about movies in the 21st century. Bland, but the movie thinks of itself as interesting. Silly, but it thinks it's clever. Somehow, the filmakers were able to jam Sam Cooke and The White Stripes into nearly adjacent scenes- which, I guess, is to let the viewer know that ""The Green Hornet"" doesn't take itself seriously.

When are we going to be done with Seth Rogen? Why is he allowed to make movies? Guys like him belong in community theater, not horrible summer blockbuster hopefuls. He's like some kind of terrible genetic monster, combining the acting ""ability"" of Ben Affleck and the ""charisma"" of Michael Cera, that thinks of itself as really, really funny.

And while we're at it, someone please tell me why, when Rogen discovers that he owns a bulletproof car, he immediately decides, ""Hey! I'll go be a superhero!"" (Flash-back to daddy breaking his Super Man or whatever dolly when he was 9... grow up already!)

We made it about 30 minutes or so into the movie- turning it off right after the scene where Cameron Diaz is hired as (gasp!) Seth Rogen's PERMANENT SECRETARY, which made for simply stunning cinema.

4434955,2,B004MYH08U,"In ""The Green Hornet,"" Britt Reid (Seth Rogen), the son of metropolitan newspaper publisher James Reid (Tom Wilkinson), spends his days carousing, throwing wild parties, drinking to excess, and passing out, much to the chagrin of his father.  When his father unexpectedly dies, Britt is thrust into his father's job -- a job he's unqualified for and doesn't take seriously.

 To strike back at a father who may have been the toast of the city but was a cold, distant dad, Britt enlists the assistance of his father's automobile mechanic, Kato (Jay Chou), in some local vandalism.  Security cameras pick up their grainy images but the newspaper staff assumes the perpetrators are members of a gang.  Britt orders his staff to write about the unidentified culprit and give him a snappy name that will sell papers.  They call him ""The Green Hornet.""

 Up until this point, the film isn't bad, and it promises some interesting dramatic moments balanced with action.  But director Michel Gondry goes the route of camp in gagging up every situation that follows, with Rogen's mugging and terrible acting undermining any attempt at a decent picture.

 Rogen is a limited actor who has become identified with man-boy social-misfit roles.  In that capacity he's fine and has developed a fan base.  But he is clearly not action hero material.  He goes through the motions, recites the lines, and tries to look determined, but we never once believe his character as a serious threat to the bad guys.  His Green Hornet is a human cartoon doing everything but running off a cliff and remaining suspended in midair as he looks helplessly toward the camera.

 Chou's Kato comes off as interesting, but he can't sell the comedic side of his role.  It appears he has all he can handle to deliver his dialogue in English.  There's no irony, no timing, and no sense of humor in lines meant to elicit chuckles.  In the action department, Chou is more effective showing off Kato's lightning-fast karate moves and proficiency at building amazing gadgets and equipping cars with gimmicky weaponry.

 Satisfying the unwritten rule of action movies that in stature the bad guy must equal or even surpass that of the hero, Christoph Waltz plays Chudnofsky, the deadly crime king of the city.  In an opening scene that borrows the menace of Waltz's Nazi officer from ""Inglourious Basterds,"" Chudnofsky shows that despite his mild-mannered appearance and soft-spoken voice, he is a formidable villain.  Equipped with a dual-barreled pistol, he is adept at knocking off upstart criminals, including James Franco in an unbilled cameo role, who threaten to muscle in on his turf.

 Cameron Diaz plays a secretary hired by Britt shortly after he takes over at the newspaper.  Modeled on girl-Friday Pepper Potts in the ""Iron Man"" films, Diaz' Lenore Case has little to do that is significant to the plot and is present primarily for attractive window dressing in this testosterone-driven flick.

 There are some good action sequences in ""The Green Hornet,"" including one involving several cement mixers, excitingly staged car chases, and an improbable scene in which a severed car continues its rampage through an office building.

 Humor is a tricky element in an action picture.  It has to be incorporated in measured doses to be effective.  The original ""Superman"" movie got it right, charming the viewer with gentle comedy without turning its superhero into the object of jokes.  ""The Green Hornet"" looks as if a group of drunk, rich fraternity brothers put it together, assuming their sophomoric approach was hugely entertaining.  When Hollywood throws its money into an ill-conceived project like this, it can only result in a dud.

 ""The Green Hornet"" is rated PG-13 for violent mayhem and strong language.",1314921600,,3781,5.030595813204509

4434957,1,B004MYH08U,"Don't waste your precious greenbacks, on the Green hornet. I rented this movie and was very disappointed, by the ignorant buffoonery of unfunny Seth Rogen. Right away Seth lets everyone knows he's not a serious minded, crime fighting hero. Kato carried some of the fight sequences, but could not carry the whole movie, because he was only the sidekick, and the movie was titled after his outrageous leader. Intelligence was not portrayed by this hornet, so I stopped watching after 5 minutes. I felt my time was being wasted, while I watched this buffoonish minstrelsy.

I found nothing from this Green Hornet, that was convincing, serious, or genuinely funny. At no time during this movie, will you imagine that this Green Hornet, reminds you of the original Green Hornet. This Green Hornet acts like a damn fool throughout this movie, and portrays an outdated minstrel show buffoon wearing black face. The new Kato at times mildly reminds you of Bruce Lee, and is just a tad more serious. I cannot give a detailed review about this movie, because I didn't spend much time with it.

I continued to fast forward this movie, to see if Seth Rogen's stupid minstrelsy  would subside, but it only get's worse. This movie is an irritating disgrace, to the legacy of the real Bruce Lee's efforts. I will submit one star just to get this review posted, there's just no other way around it. I'm in total agreement with the majority of other reviewers. You will not find anything heroic, or remotely believable about these two action figure's.

Sure I may not like the Twilight films, but I don't outright hate them as they make me laugh on several occasions coupled with the fact that the third film was OK. But this? If I could rate it any lower, I would! I actually even tried to give it the benefit of the doubt. The only thing I ever saw the Green Hornet was the two-part crossover featured in the original Batman series and since then have wanted to see the original series. Then I first heard about this garbage 2-3 years ago and found out Seth Rogen was writing and starring in it. At first I wondered who Seth Rogen is and then once I found out what kind of films he was in, I was like ""Well people were upset when Michael Keaton was cast as Batman and look how that turned out."" Boy was I wrong! He's an unfunny, talentless person (remember this is all opinion as I'm sure others have found him funny in other projects) but he should've stayed away from this! When I saw this in theatres, at first my dad and I were the only two in there but then at least five to ten more people showed up. Those other people found it hilarious. I sat there in silence, hoping it would get better. Rogen portrays the Hornet as a half-wit and screams with joy during one of their escapes as the police cars crash into obstacles. Britt Reid may want the Green Hornet to appear as a criminal but at no point, at least from the original series, does he get excited at the thought of mayhem and destruction. The guy who plays Kato, the name escapes me at the moment, was OK he didn't leave much of an impact on me (though that strange way he fights or gets pumped during a fight I thought was unnecessary and ""out there"") Cameron Diaz (another person I don't personally enjoy but she's OK) was wasted in this. The villain was bland, along with his recurring ""joke"" and the reveal of the DA being corrupt was expected. Black Beauty though was the highlight and I wish it was the Green Hornet who got totalled in the end and not the car. Believe me I wanted to like this but it was just stupid and I hope there is not a sequel. Another thing I noticed is a parallel with Batman; in the '60s, Batman was played as farce while the Green Hornet was played straight with Batman being far more successful. Nowadays, Batman is the serious one and Green Hornet played for laughs, again with the Caped Crusader far more successful. If you want to get into the Green Hornet my suggestion is to find the radio series or the much better Van Williams/Bruce Lee TV series (along with his crossover on Batman). And what really astounds me is that THIS has made more money than Green Lantern (just to clarify, Ryan Reynolds wasn't my first choice either and I actually thought they'd go with the John Stewart character for obvious reasons but he was good).",1314144000,7,2844,4.297951582867784

Jay Choi is good as Kato, the man who seemingly can do everything, Christolph Waltz is a riot as the villain of the piece and Cameron Diaz contributes nothing but having Rogen and Choi fight over her.  (Theres along and ridiculous fight scene between the Reid and Kato over Diaz that should have wound up on the cutting room floor.)
Whats great about this film are the action scenes and stunts which are terrific.  Theres an incredibly long chase and action scene between the Hornet's car, the ""Black Beauty,"" and many heavily armed vehicles of the bad guys that goes on forever.  (This scene is even longer in the deleted scene segment of the special features.)  The car scene ends and another explosive fight scene continues in the offices of the Daily Sentinel, the newspaper owned by Brit Reid, the secret identity of The Green Hornet.  The stunts and action scenes were performed by legendary stuntman, Vic Armstrong and many members of his family.
Look, as stated, this film can be very silly at times and Rogen can be hard to take, but, for the most part, this is an exciting and enjoyable film.  The special features on the blu-ray are very good: deleted scenes, gagreel, features on the writing of the film, the creation of the ""Black Beauty,"" the stunts, the special effect, etc. etc.  The picture and sound quality are terrific.",1312329600,,1960,4.60632183908046

This was a movie that had to be written by a thousand monkeys sitting at a thousand keyboards in order to come up with something.  I looked forward to Green Hornet coming out and I had high hopes; I can only hope that this doesn't affect the careers of Cameron Diaz and Edward James Olmos.,1311811200,,443,4.068965517241379
4435005,5,B004MYH08U,"The Green Hornet is one of those rare superhero movies that is so funny and action packed you can't help but love it. Seth Rogen is Britt Reid he has a father who runs a news paper so he is a partying playboy without a care in the world until the sad day he inherits his father's estate. Enter Kato and the fun begins after rescuing some people Britt and Kato are so jazzed they decide to do it every night they don't have any strict moral codes they are just out there doing good and having fun.  The movie is action packed and the humor is great. The villain wants to be scary and respected but the Green Hornet smashes his operations and steals his thunder since everyone thinks the Green Hornet is a criminal too, this leads the villain into a midlife crises. Cameron Diaz is in this movie too and she gives such a great performance having to put up with Britt and Kato who are alway's trying to hit on her while using her to try and figure out what to do. The way that the martial arts action is portrayed is not only cool but certainly unique to the film.this movie is an origin story so you get a hilarious and action packed look at how Britt Reid transforms from party boy to crime fighter. there is this weird vibe people seem to give superhero movies that try to make you laugh. I personally love dark vigilante movies but they have their place and movies like the Green Hornet and The Mask(another excellent Cameron Diaz movie) have theirs.

4435007,1,B004MYH08U,"The so-called Green Hornet movie doesn't even deserve to be called a turky, it's that bad.

When I heard there may be a Green Hornet movie in the making I was hoping it would never get done if all it was going to be was another Bruce Lee movie. Now I still wish it never got made. I didn't think anyone could make a Green Hornet movie so stupid.
The so-called humor you could see it coming, such as when Brett asked Kato for the gas gun then shot him with it. Also the humor wasn't funny.
Katos fighting looks a lot like the Matrix, wich is now getting kind of old.
All that shooting and destruction was seen in almost every episodes of the A-Team tv show. The bad part is when the hero does most of the shooting and damage  he is no longer a hero. He is even less when he does malicous vandalism.
It was the police who thought the Green Hornet was on the wrong side of the law and Bret took adventage of it to take down those who are the real crooks. He did not make himself to look like the bad guy.
By coincendence it seems Kato thought of everything like fixing the Black Beauty, a back wheel drive car, so it was also a front wheel drive in case the car was ripped in half so they can still drive off, but he didn't make it a four wheel drive.
This movie is a waste of money and time. It's not worth calling it a B-movie. It's not worth the C- Entertainment Weekly gave it.  There is nothing good I can say about this monie.
It is really sad to see relatives leeching off their ancestors name and ruining the good things they have done. George W. Trendle's son is credited as Executive Producer of this stupid movie. George should be haunting him with a vengeance.
All they did was what was done to the Lone Ranger in 1981 with the Legend of the Lone Ranger movie,they also KILLED the Green Hornet.
If you really want to see the Green Hornet get the two movie serials on dvd's or go to Radio Spirits for the collection sets of the vintage radio shows. Then you will really see and hear THE GREEN HORNET.",1311379200,,2008,4.130434782608695

So much so, that I wanted to purchase the movie as soon as it was released to DVD. One of the things I do when I get a new DVD is to watch the ""special features"" prior to watching the main film. The Green Hornet really benefits from this. The ""special features"" attached to the Blu-Ray version of this movie sets out what Rogen and crew wanted to create, as well as to pay homage to the original TV and radio series. Once I understood what was going on from the view of the actors, screenwriters, director, stunt crews, and special effects personnel, I was able to sit back and look for things I'd missed earlier and really enjoy this movie. Besides, how can anyone NOT like a movie with a 1965 Chrysler Imperial with twin front mounted chain fed machine guns? Some movies get better after multiple viewing and this is one of them.

4435010,1,B004MYH08U,"I was not familiar with Seth Rogen before this movie, but he has quickly vaulted himself into my ""Why Bother?"" List of actors/writers/directors.
I was a great fan of the 60's show, which wasn't campy like Batman but kept us kids entertained with neat gadgets, simple stories, and Bruce Lee's mesmerizing martial arts abilities. All the major characters, from Britt Reid (The Green Hornet), to Kato, to the secretary, to the DA were competent and honest people trying to fight crime when it reared its ugly head. What does Rogen give us? Britt Reid is now a spoiled, foul-mouthed, incompetent boob who is kept afloat by the closet mechanical genius of Kato and the organizational skills of his secretary. The DA leads the corruption instead of fighting it. The police are the idiots who ""get in the way"" while Kato gets things done (with Reid basically along for the ride). Meanwhile, the main villain is a guy with a poor Russian accent (is that possible?) who belongs more in the 60's Batman series than this movie.
The movie swings wildly between trying to be funny (it rarely is) and serious (it definitely isn't). It's not for kids (unless your kids are already foul-mouthed), it's not for Green Hornet fans (FUBAR), it's not for much of anyone.",1311292800,,1249,4.787037037037037
4435011,5,B004MYH08U,"Man I loved this movie! What is up with all the bad press, criticism and poor public reviews like here at Amazon? I am not going to go into great detail about the aesthetics and characteristics of the movie as movies go or as more experienced movie reviewers would. I watched the TV series Green Hornet when I was a kid - before I had any clue who Bruce Lee was about to become! And I loved that show. But comparing this one to that is absolutely not fair to this movie (nor to the old TV series for that matter).

I think the movie could have been made one of three ways, 1. In the spirit of the old TV series, 2. In a dark and serious manner (wasn't that just done? why so serious?), 3. In an action packed yet hilarious way!.

Well gee, which one do you think this is? Heck yeah! And in that vein, it was awesome! I laughed hard, and I was entertained immensely by crazy action, wild martial arts and special effects, whacky gadgets and tricked out cars that made any previous movies with tricked out cars seem weak by comparison!

When I saw the earliest of trailers for The Green Hornet, I was like, ""What? a comedy... starring this guy?"". I thought it would either be a complete dud or really funny and great. The more trailers I saw as the movie neared release, the more I could tell it would be funny and great. So by the time I saw it (first watched as a Blu-ray rental), I even had my hopes up already with plenty of hype - and you know that can never be good. But The Green Hornet not only didn't let me down, but I had a total blast and can't wait to receive my copy that I just ordered here at Amazon right before writing this review and watch The Green Hornet again for my third time and who knows how many more times after that!

Man folks.... lighten up on this movie... please. ;)",1311120000,2,1797,4.140401146131805

4435013,4,B004MYH08U,"A lot of people hate this movie, but for the wrong-ish reasons.  Obviously, if you loved the original ""Green Hornet"" TV series and took it seriously as an adventure story, this modern-day spoof, filled with broad comedy and crude language, is not going to please you. But underneath it all, this is clearly a labor of love for pop-culture geek Seth Rogen, who cowrote the film and stars as the Hornet himself, although he plays him as a clueless, ham-fisted would-be superhero instead of a sharp-voiced, action-ready mystery man. The most effective elements of humor in here are Rogen's frat-boy-goes-masked-man oafishness, and the contrast of his super-capable ""sidekick,"" the new, ultra-badass Kato, who is a martial arts tornado and builds super-weapons and crazy cars that would make James Bond's Q turn green with envy.  Also, the absurd collateral damage, with comicbook violence projected into the real world, is pretty funny (even if you do sort of numb out at the end of this film the same way you do in a lot of straight, non-comedy action flicks...)

Folks who say that Rogen ""got it wrong"" with the Green Hornet are either being disingenuous or just plain not getting it: this wasn't intended as a remake, it's a satire.  Sure, it's not the greatest comedy ever, but it's got its moments, and some are genuinely funny. I doubt I'll ever watch it again, but I would check out the sequel. I'd give it a 3.5  (Axton)",1310601600,,1425,4.8

Villein not very good, too many personal disorders and lack of self esteem. Rogen comes across as a foul mouthed buffoon but clearly shows his character has good heart and is trying to get his act together. They also show Brick Reid had personal problems with his father from the beginnings which is interesting. Settings great and costumes nice. Overall, it was a good effort to put this film forward but could have used a better villein and better editing. On the other hand I still enjoyed this film. I liked it with us showing Reid developing the Green Hornet rather than in the shows with Green Hornet as is. However, the flaw with the series was always the villeins were really not very impressive, simply put they were ordinary criminals for the most part with little characater or charisma. They could do a bit better with better villeins and characters. Since the Green Hornet did a cameo and a guest star in one episode on Adam West's Batman, I would love to see the next film with the Green Hornet mixing it up with Batman like they have with Batman and Superman.  They could also develope some villeins such as those that made Batman and Superman great.",1310515200,,1310,4.695652173913044

Nobody expects realism in a Green Hornet film, but the portrayal of the great hero of the dark in this movie was so absurd that it wasn't even funny.  Britt was a total waste with no redeeming qualities.  The film didn't adequately explain why Kato would follow such a selfish clumsy bungling loser.  The producers want us to accept that Kato, who could beat up 20 professional thugs with guns all in one fell swoop, couldn't beat Britt, who had never done any fighting.  Somehow, miraculously, Britt became an expert martial arts expert at the very end of the film simply by thinking like Kato.  As the film ended and credits came up, my wife said, ""You couldn't pay me to watch this film a second time.""  It just goes to show that better filmic technology does not make up for a lousy script and and extremely poor character development.

4435038,2,B004MYH08U,"The movie itself isn't my issue. I think Green Horney is a noble attempt at something different for the super hero genre. It's not great, but it borders on good by using its own charm to perpetuate itself. While Michel Gondry doesn't always hit the mark, it's quirky enough that I enjoyed my experience with this film. As for this Bluray, however, I've got my reservations. For starters, the 3D process used in post production was poorly done. At its very best moments, this 3D conversion allows for a few still, tightly focused shots to look like it was naturally shot in 3D. For the rest, it makes the film slightly unwatchable. The quick cuts leave no time to analyze the depth, so you have no idea what action is taking place. There's an awkward cross fade halfway through the film, and it's incredibly hard to focus on two entirely different planes of perspective. None of the actors really seems defined in their 3D space, and its more like the area around them is being highlighted. I noticed an ongoing theme where the top part of the screen is further away, and the bottom part is closer. While I'm sure that choice was mostly dictated by shot composure,it never feels right.

I hate to end on a bad note, but the best way I can sum it up is that most 3D TVs have an onboard feature that lets them convert 2D to 3D on the fly. It never works and is mostly an irritant - and that's exactly how I feel about this 3D Bluray.",1308528000,,1430,4.37593984962406
4435039,3,B004MYH08U,"I like the premise - bored rich kid starts dreaming of hero status cloaked in a super hero-like car and outfit with a side-kick who's really the only stud of the pair.  Rich kid does this following the death of his father, who owns a newspaper and never really had time for the kid.  Eventually what started as a night of defacing property turns into vigilantism and eventually ridding the city of criminals at the highest level.  That sounds good right?  The problem... way too little character development for me to be sympathetic to the cause, and way too many explosions and high speed chases to find much continuity in the story.

Seeking to finish out the film I focused on what I liked.  I liked the car - very cool and I want one.  I liked most of the banter between The Green Hornet and Kato.  Actually, Kato was the best part of the movie; smart, handsome and the mastermind behind The Green Hornet and his gadgets.  The Green Hornet really comes off as an oaf who simply follows Kato around, pretending he's in charge of Kato.

Overall this movie was a 'C' on an A to F scale.  It will appeal to boys and men more than it will to women, and much of it is so loud with car chases and explosions, that some will find it tough to hear the dialogue when it occurs. It's not offensive, but much of it was tedious and boring.  If it weren't for watching it with my family I would have turned it off and not finished it. The cool cars, fight scenes where Kato kicks a**, and the occasionally humorous exchanges, were the only good parts for me.

Great Green Hornet movie. Seldom do we get a movie with a beginning and an ending to match. There is emotion, action and depth of character.  With the exception of some rap music, the background and filler music matched the scene and did not overwhelm the dialog. There are plenty of car chases and structural destruction; yet in all of the mayhem there we do not see gratuitous blood and guts (maybe a few suggestive bullet holes.) Cameron may have been a distraction at first; however when she got down to acting you enjoyed watching her character.

What makes it worth watching are two things ... the car and the actor that plays Kato. They put all their energy into creating a great car (and thats why the trailer is great). Thumbs up for picking the actor that plays Kato. An the car with the music helped the trailer look great. Think about it.

On the other hand, the Green Hornet character reduces the credibility of the movie. The character will only appeal to all the un-employed playboys that love cars.

The fight scenes had too many special effects. They should have toned it done to appeal to more adults.

If your desire to watch it is very strong then use the ""Video on Demand"" option with your TV cable service. You will save 10 to 20 dollars.

4435049,3,B004MYH08U,"Seth Rogan is a rather obscure comedian.  I've never seen him in another movie and I can't remember ever seeing him on TV. But I know he's a comedian, so right away I knew that this was to be an unconventional treatment of this conventional comic book premise. I liked it. I thought it was amusing - not hilarious - just amusing.

The problem is that, this one not particularly funny joke runs thin after a while. The Green Hornet is played as an overweight couch potato - got it, what's next?

Fifty years ago Hollywood fought against the prejudice by whites against orientals. Famously in ""The Sand Pebbles"" Steve McQueen says that Chinese can't work on the boat's engine because they are too stupid. For them, he says it's all monkey see - monkey do. Much of the rest of the movie is devoted to affirming that the Chinese are indeed smart enough to serve as an assistant to an enlisted  mechanic (McQueen) on a large but rather simple boat engine.

This sort of plot wouldn't work today. Many of us drive Japanese cars and all of have Japanese or Korean electronics in our homes. Today oriental connotes brains especially engineering brains. But now we have swung too far the other way. Now we have a Cato - who was in the person of Bruce Lee just a simple kick ass chauffer - revealed as a genius inventor, sort of like the character of Tony Stark in ""Iron Man"". The new Cato is no longer submissive. He provides some real dominant and assertive manliness to compensate for the chubby dweeb who plays the Green Hornet. This itself is a problem. Bruce Lee as Cato was a servant who knew his place. He faded into the background. That made it surprising and entertaining when in a crisis he revealed himself to be a kung-fu master. Bruce Lee's Cato was a foil to the stiff but conventionally heroic Grant Williams. He was all of the fun in that long ago TV series. Alas this new Cato is just not much fun.

That's OK - got it, what's next?

Well there is also Cameron Diaz. But she is almost completely a negative presense on screen. She's just too old. The men in the screenplay all react to her as if she were some super attractive hottie. But your lying eyes this time are truthful. She looks tired, even haggard. Her looks have faded and she always had marginal features. Without youth she has nothing to contribute. She was never beautiful but she used to be cute.

Disclaimer: Although I lived through the era of The Green Hornet TV show, and with all due respect to Bruce Lee (genuflect) and Van Whatsisname, I never had any interest in watching that show. Or any interest in the radio show, or the comic books (if there were any) or anything to do with the Green Hornet. I am also sick to death of serious-as-hell comic book movies. I just saw the trailer for this movie and thought it looked good. And I am glad that I followed through and saw the movie.

Granted, Seth Rogen's version of Britt Reid makes me want to give him a good beating, but not to worry, he receives that during the course of the movie. And the movie drags until Kato (Jay Chou) is introduced. But he is introduced early on, and from then the movie is a fun ride. It doesn't take itself seriously, but provides a lot of action, and it feels a lot shorter than its two-hour length (not once did I look at the DVD player's elapsed time display, wondering how much longer there was to go, something I find myself doing during more and more while watching movies these days).

I have a feeling that 2011 will go down as the year the funny man killed the super hero movie. Im not one to pigeon hole an actor and I think Seth Rogen should be given the chance to spread his acting wings. Sadly he didn't do that in the Green Hornet. The movie comes off as a bromance comedy with a Rush Hour feel. I like my super hero movie gritty with doses of one liners. The Green Hornet feels more like a running one liner with a super hero subplot. Kato (Jay Chou) is the only saving grace for the movie. Great slow-mo fighting style and all the gadgets that would make Bond blush. Christoph Waltzs acting ability is severely undercut by the horrible comedic lines hes supposed to deliver. And the less said about Cameron Diaz in this movie the better. Leave your Dark Knight expectations at the door and get ready for something in between a Schumacher meets Michael Bay type movie.

(mild spoilers)

We are spared much of the nonsense found in superhero movies because, for starters, this is a comedy.  The bad guy is crazy, the good guys (at least one) are awesome, but we accept it easily because it just fits. Secondly, we're not dealing with picture perfect, self-sacrificing heroes. There's one nice guy, and one self-absorbed, egotistical schmuck; one butt-kicking fighter, and one self-important whiner; one always-got-a-solution-can-do-anything-and-everything-guy, and one privileged clown with no practical experience or knowledge. And yet, they make a great team.
The story itself is decent - neither superb nor awful. It is the characters that make it, however. Seth Rogen (the Green Hornet) is the key here...his acting is what makes his character come alive (and if you don't think he's believable, that's just because you have not met someone like his character [yet, anyway]!) Jay Chou's Kato is perfect, as is Christopher Waltz' psycho ""Bloodnofsky"". Cameron Diaz's enthusiastic crime-fighter reporter is superb (although farrrrr too tolerant of Reid...). Everyone does a great job, and the bungling twists and turns of their saga keep you on the edge of your seat. At least, they did me.

Jay Chou made an excellent Kato, Cameron Diaz could have been excellent also with better writing.  The bad guys, the DA - all good.  I found the special effects to be very entertaining also....Black Beauty was well done, the chase scenes were exciting.
If you want to see the intent of the Green Hornet - watch the old TV series.  It's dated - but hews to the intent of the character.
If you want to watch the fart joke version - watch this movie.

I was really disappointed that this bad of a movie could come from the director of Eternal Sunshine of the Mind and writers of Superbad.. the movie should have been great, how did it go sooooo wrong?

The actors, regardless of what they've done in past movies (the bad guy was GREAT in Inglorious Bastards, Seth Rogen has been great in other movies), all drown together in a shallow, jumbled mess of an unbelievable plot.

I've seen people saying it is a parody against superheros, to try to redeem it I suppose.  No way.  Even a parody should have a plot and dialog that holds up.  The dialog and the characters just do not match.  And I would guess they tried to save the move with over the top, crazy visual effects.... yet they do nothing because they have no believable story to stand on.

Foolishly the next day, after I had already stopped the movie once because it was so bad, I turned it back on and watched the 2nd half (I couldn't help myself, it was like being fixated on a bad car wreck, I had to look).... unfortunately the director, writers, and cast outdid themselves, the 2nd half was worse than the 1st half.

I cannot help but believe, as I watched this movie, that the writers had the same idea and wanted to make a movie that said, ""See, the Green Hornet's all about the sidekick!"" In fact, it does not just want to say that, it wants to shout it from the rooftops throughout the film. As a result, we have a Kato that does it all, and a Green Hornet that remains an inept, self centered loser the entire movie. And just in case you didn't get the hint that it's all about the sidekick, an arguement between the two ""heroes"" results in Kato kicking the Green Hornet's posterior all over the screen. Now, as silly as it seems that Bruce Lee was just a sidekick in the original show, I don't think there were that many fans that wanted him to kick Van William's (TV GH) a$$. And though no one measures up to Mr. Lee in fighting ability, the original TV Green Hornet was certainly not portrayed as a complete baffoon, as he is here.

Story is based upon a party animal playboy who inherits his father's multi-million dollar newspaper company, and then teams up with a martial arts trained engineer genius who together fight crime and corruption.  ""The Green Hornet"" originates in 1936 as a masked vigilante comic book hero that was popularized by a radio series.  Since then there have been many, many remakes of the classic story.  This 2011 release with Seth Rogen, Jay Chou, and Cameron Diaz has all the necessary gadgets and action, as well as several well-known actors who are actually fairly convincing in their roles during the film.  Best part of the movie of course is the climax of battles that takes place inside the newspaper company building where the bad guys wage an all out war on the Green Hornet and Kato.  The movie has star power, but actually is fairly well done (instead of the typical famous cast of has-beens who think their name and a few lucky roles make up for a crappy performance), this time everybody in the film pulled their weight.

4435111,1,B004MYH08U,"There's so many things wrong with this movie that the only way I could review it is to compare the main character (Tony Starks Jr.) in the Iron Man movies as portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. with the way Seth Rogen portrays Britt Reid (Green Hornet).

Tony Starks is cocky, brash and obnoxious.  But he is also brilliant, wealthy, a guy who can invent and create cool gadgets, has some father issues to deal with and he's dying.  It made you want to keep watching how he would resolve these issues, whether he would die or fall madly in love with his assistant Ms. Potts who he really cares for.  I really could identify with this character.  Who wouldn't want to be brilliant, wealthy and have an assistant as beautiful as Ms. Potts? It was fun watching the Iron Man movies.

Seth Rogen's portrayal of Britt Reid is also cocky, brash and obnoxious but he's also loud-mouthed with a Peter Pan syndrome to boot. The only enviable quality he has is that he's rich but I suspect that's so he can indulge in his childish behavior.  That's OK as a starting premise for a character.  After all, I like to keep watching a movie to see how the character develops.

[SPOILER] However,  there's a scene where Britt Reid has a fight with his assistant Kato.  Keep in mind that Kato, in prior scenes, would dispose of much deadlier opponents with ease and here he was having a difficult time fighting with Reid - who in previous scenes would run away from opponents - didn't make any sense.  OK - I thought, maybe he'll get the living daylights beaten out of him by Kato and this would transform him, change him in some positive way.  But no, both of them fall into a swimming pool during the fight (again, given Kato's fighting prowess in previous scenes, this didn't make any sense).  Of course, Kato can't swim and instead of a chance for the Kato character to help transform and move the movie in a positive direction, Reid saves Kato and we're left with the same Britt Reid character.  Eventually, I stopped watching as the movie was becoming too tedious to watch.

There was nothing fun about watching this movie and in the end I was annoyed at the character - made me want to beat the living daylights out of him for making me waste my time watching this.

It's a shame that Christoph Waltz' talent is wasted in this awful movie.  He was so good as Col. Landa in Inglourious Basterds.

Up till now I honestly didn't find Rogen all that funny, but he must be getting better because I found him hilarious in this. Chou was amazing - I too want to see more from him!! And Rogen - he is getting better and better!

The thing is I really liked the stupid funny aspect of this. I was far more entertained by it that I expected because of the bad reviews. I got it because I knew no matter how bad it would be my husband would love it, but I ended up loving it. It was a tight, fast moving work and the personalities of the actors really kept it moving. Waltz was scary funny with his puzzlement as to why no one found him scary while being completely creepy, and Cameron really gave a nice nugget of comic Girl Friday. But the chemistry between Rogen and Chou was awesome and Chou stole the show.

C'mon - even if you hated it the whole gas gun thing was funny...

But I do have to admit it lacked something. Maybe there was too much effect work and it overwhelmed the comedy.

4435114,1,B004MYH08U,"I think that this movie had some great elements: a funny star (Seth), a talented co-star (Jay), Cameron Diaz, and some sweet Green Hornet cars. Yet, with all of these things going for it, the Green Hornet had no sting at all.

The story was terribly predictable, and not really funny. The worst part of this film was the Green Hornet himself. He was anything but heroic. I have never seen a superhero with no skill, ability, or talent other than telling bad jokes. The only thing the Green Hornet character did is annoy me to the point of agitation and put my girlfriend to sleep.

The Green Hornet's side kick (Jay Cho) literally did all the work in the movie. He designed the cars, the weapons, fought the bad guys, got the girl, and was more funny than Seth. I was very disappointed by this film and felt like it was a real waste of time.

I would rather write this review over and over again for two hours than watch another ten minutes of the Green Hornet. Do us a favor and save the excessive humor and unnecessary sarcasm for movies like Superbad '07 (which actually was a good movie).",1305676800,3,1092,4.396039603960396
4435115,4,B004MYH08U,"I watched the original show when I was younger, but I grew up way after the show was made so I didn't grow up watching it on Saturday mornings or anything. And I basically only watched it because Bruce Lee was in it. That being said, I enjoyed this movie immensely. I knew going in that it was going to put an emphasis on comedy, which some reviewers here seem to have been surprised by. It was written by and stars Seth Rogan. What were you expecting? And it's not as if the comedy is out of place in the context of the movie. It's perfectly suited for the movie since a lot of it is physical comedy(not campy style though). And the dialogue is pretty witty and just as hilarious as the physical comedy. Some lines genuinely had me cracking up.
But let's say you're not interested in the comedy. OK, the action is awesome as well. The fight scenes are all pretty original and very cool. And the Black Beauty is amazing. They did so much cool stuff with that car.
How about the story? It's extremely solid, better than most action-comedies. It centers around organized crime and corruption and does so in a pretty interesting way. Sure, you see the ""bad guy"" twist coming from a mile away and it meanders a bit in the second half before the climax but it's still a solid and entertaining plot.
And if you did watch the original show then you should appreciate the little nods the movie gives, like Kato making a comment about being too fast to be captured on film on television. This of course being a reference to Bruce Lee's movements being too fast for the camera film of the time of the original show, which meant he had to slow down his punches for the show. And references like that are sprinkled throughout the film.

All in all it's a really fun, really entertaining movie that does exactly what it set out to do. It's going in my collection because I wanted to watch it again as soon as it ended.",1305676800,2,1905,4.351123595505618

The film is highly metaphorical and the perspective of the gang world is scarey - maybe it isn't metaphor.  The car and the material science ideas are so very cool, though.  Kato rocks hard and the Green Hornet will grow up.  Hope there are 3 or 4 more and that Miss Diaz stays the course as an older, wiser, educated character with a wardrobe as beautiful and appropriate as, say, Audrey Hepburn in ""Charade"".  That fine line of the very young, rich, double agent, city saver gets a needed comic twist with the casting of Seth Rogan.  Wish they could bring James Franco back from the dead on this one.  Who knew the ""Freaks and Geeks"" monkey troop would do so much varied and good work!?!  Freaks and Geeeks - keep on keeepin' on.",1305504000,3,866,4.329192546583851
4435118,3,B004MYH08U,"Let's cut to the chase here. This movie has a lot in it, but it sums up to a lot of nothing. The reason for that is mainly because the main character, the spoiled rich guy played by Seth Rogan has such a blatant disrespect for Kato. That's it in a nutshell. Throughout the entire movie, Kato is the real driving force behind everything while Green Hornet takes all the credit and basically fails to recognize Katos abilities or appreciate him, even in the end (I didn't believe his trite contrition at the end).

A lot happens throughout the movie, yet none of it really matters much because it all boils down to such a total disrespect for Kato. Green Hornet reminds me of a corporation's attitude toward its employees. Maybe that's the real theme here. Maybe that is why this movie has really turned off so many people. Green Hornet is the figurehead while Kato does all the real thinking and all the grunt work. Who gets all the credit? Green Hornet, of course. Who is Kato? Nuff said.

The movie could have really sparkled if Green Hornet had of come off with a different attitude, a bit if humility, instead of the selfish lout Rogan played. I don't fault Rogan as much as the script or the director for that, unless Rogan had a hand in that in the first place!

I only give it three stars for all the special effects and for the effort Kato put into this and... Cameron Diaz... She didn't really have a lot to do except kick Green Hornet in the gonads, but that was worth it.

Guess I don't have to not-recommend this one. Enough people figured that out on their own.",1305504000,4,1573,4.3951890034364265

First, it couldn't make up it's mind.  Rogen tried to be a playboy/comedian/action hero/serious leading man and failed miserably at all three.  He wasn't funny and couldn't remain in one type of character for any length of time.  I couldn't take him seriously as an action hero as he simply doesn't act or look the part.  If he was serious the entire movie and acted like a bad a$$ then it may have been better.

Chou plays Kato and he is pretty good.  I'm not a huge fan of the slow-mo fight scenes but he did a great job being funny/bad-A during the film and I hope to see him in other films.

Seth Rogen plays Britt Reid, a spoiled rich kid who gets his fathers fortune and newspaper after his untimely death. Jay Chou is perfect as Kato, an expert at pretty much everything. Reid meets Kato after he fires his father's entire staff, and is unhappy with his morning coffee. He summons Kato to his home where Kato shows him the elaborate coffee maker he designed. The two goof off for a while, checking out Reid's fathers awesome assortment of cars, and decide on a whim to become masked super heroes. Kato was Reid's father's mechanic, and can build anything. Anything! Which brings me to my favorite character, the Green Hornet's car. This baby puts the Batmobile and Knight Rider to shame! This car does absolutely everything you can imagine, it even keeps running once it's cut in half! Kato designed and continues to improve the car throughout the film.

4435123,3,B004MYH08U,"First, I did like this movie in general but there are too many drawbacks in this movie to rate it higher than 2.5-3 stars. I won't reccomend it for a purchase but a rental on a dry weekend might work fine.
Cast:
Great cast that as others have said, and I agree, didn't seem to hit the mark that A-listers should be hitting. The chemistry between Seth Rogen and just about everyone was always tense to me. Like no one was comfortable in their scenes (most of the time).
Cameron Diaz is, as always, quirky-cute and smart and she always pulls this off well. In regards to this movie, this is by far not her best work. It had to be said.
Chudnoksky...Good actor (Christoph Waltz)...Baaad charater. He had to give bad lines that he just couldn't seem to make entertaining. Fine, I get that he is supposed to be that bad guy that blends in. That you won't see coming. He looks and dresses like an ordinary guy but he is still dangerous. We find he is a bit off his rocker later in the story and has some of the lamest dialogue. Some people defend it but it is in fact, so bad, they think it is funny. But this is not the actors fault. It is the film maker's. They are paid to be directors and writers for a reason. (I know, ""write your own movie screenplay"" and see how hard it can be.)
Plot:
I DID like their explaination in the behind the scenes that you wanted to feel like they are heroes that simply had a lot of money in order to do what they do. They aren't coming up with super gadgets that are impractical and over the top. The weapons on the car actually could be pulled off (minus the camouflage). He had ""back up"" cars ready to go when one was destroyed which seemed more realistic.
Bad: Brit (Rogen) was firing people and re-hiring them out of sheer immaturity, fighting (fist fight) with his own partner, constantly insulting people, and we are to believe that ""all is well"" by the end? We are to like this hero? It's not the best written plot.
Kato, although the coolest character, could have been better. It's not Jay Chou's fault. I guess they pulled his character back since he is a sidekick/partner but they could do a solo movie of him and I'd see it. The actor gets major + points from me and the writing of his character may have saved this movie from disaster. It just seemed like he was missing something. He DID get some of the better scenes.
Violence:
This a much more violent movie than I thought it would be. Even after seeing a trailer or two I was surprised. They destroy property, assault just about everyone (including each other) but there was surprisingly very little blood. Hmm. If I'm going to see people shot up and blown up, wood pieces going into eye sockets (it happens), I want to see it like it's real. If you are going to make a hero movie, you should either go kiddie style or all the way. Going half-way feels hollow. There is a difference between action movies and violent movies. Some people may prefer to see the violence without seeing the blood and guts that accompanies it so this review may be what you needed to see. Now an action movie, would have explosions, fights etc, but far less blood but this had people cut in half, impaled etc but so little blood it was lacking reality. Enough beating that dead horse.
I give it 2.5-3 stars and like I said, if you have little to do on a weekend, it wouldn't hurt to rent it.",1305417600,2,3366,4.3107255520504735
4435124,1,B004MYH08U,"As soon as Seth Rogen had a single thing to do with this film, IT WAS RUINED! Don't get me wrong, I think he was great in his previous comedy roles, but this is not supposed to be a comedy. This was a great opportunity to bring the buzz back around one of the greatest martial artists that ever lived (Bruce Lee), but it was done so bad, no one could even link him to the character Kato (which, given the outcome of the movie - is a good thing). Seth should stay away from doing serious, dramatic, or action type movies, because much like ""Al Bundy"" - I just want to laugh when I see him. A great vehicle completely wasted!
Why would anyone want to buy this movie?...I only went to see it on the big screen because a friend insisted we at least give it a chance...yeah, he could not believe he was so wrong and apologized afterwards and he hated the movie as well. Rogen IS funny, and does not belong to this hero.
And yes, easily one of the worst movies EVER made. What the *bleep* were they thinking?...they should have trashed this project or postponed it as soon as Kevin Smith left it.
Lastly, if you want some idea of how good it could have been, check out the short on youtube made just a few years ago, it is only about 10 minutes long, but excellent compared to this garbage feature.

Seth Rogen was efficient in mixing drama with humor, but the real star was Jay Chou as Kato! Britt Reid (Rogen) may be the main hero, but Chou owned this movie! Christoph Waltz (who took his hokiness to an entirely new level) was only OK as the villain, and Cameron Diaz was sort of a mere sidenote character. It's as if the writers (Rogen and friend Evan Goldberg) just said, ""Well, I guess we have to put an attractive love interest in here somewhere."" But her part -- which may seem integral -- could have been played by anyone and wasn't really all that important, as someone else in the cast could've easily brought to the table the knowledge that her character had. In fact, I wish they had gotten an actress a little younger (or at least around Rogen's age -- her 38 to his 27) and/or a little more unknown; Diaz just seemed all wrong for the part. Nevertheless, Rogen and Goldberg did a decent job with tackling a tough genre; say what you will but it's damn tough to write a decent comic movie adaptation.

4435130,1,B004MYH08U,"This film is an absolute disappointment. Anyone wanting to see some extensive martial arts and action will be very disappointed. The most extended fighting scene is between the leading characters Britt Reid aka the Green Hornet (Seth Rogan) and Kato (Jay Chou) as they butt heads over Katos rightful inventions and fighting additions to the duo. Seth Rogan makes stupid and constant quips throughout the complete film. Katos fight scenes hold no where the intensity or action packed attempts the trailers and previews might let on. There is more fighting and skills proven from the film ""Kick Ass's"" Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz) or Iron Man II's Scarlett Johansson's fightn scenes. Hollywood has run out of original material, because they are prone to ignoring ethnic writers with new material and continue remakes of old films, ie., ""The Lone Ranger"" or ""Conan: The Barbarian"". Even musical scores are recylcled. I love AC/DC, but if I hear ""Highway to Hell"" in another film (Iron Man 2), I'm gonna burn my CDs.

The Green Hornet is the weakest superhero and villain production that has its strongest element being the ""black beauty"" mobile Kato constructs and even then, the car is not that impressive either. Its storyline is too predictable and completely boring with the villian as uninteresting and unoriginal. The first fight was in the hood against some street corner thugs (yawn) and although Cameron Diaz is still hot, she showed no substance for character or major substance. The Green Hornets creation is not from some dramatic fate or act visited upon Mr. Reid, but is manufactured through his wealthy family's newspaper. How original, even ""Blankman"" uses that element with much more comic success, thanks to Damon Wayans!

This DVD is for Seth Rogan fans only, but to me he is the same character he played in ""Knocked-Up"" combined with a deceitful attempt to lure in a karate film. What they should have done was made the film all about Kato instead because the Green Hornet is a boring and unfulfilled alpha male that humps air through the hole film.

What does all this have to do with the price of tea in China?  Absolutely nothing but I figured I'd write some totally superfluous and extraneous remarks for the Hornet haters who'll get all over me for loving this movie.  I never read the comic books or saw the Tv series so I accept this movie for what it is and it's a total blast.  Star/writer/producer Seth Rogen took a character that is sacrosanct to many and fashioned it to fit his devil-may-care persona purists be damned.  The nocturnal adventures of the Hornet and Kato come off more as a fraternity pledge prank than as some altruistic endeavor and I thought that was a hoot.  What would Kevin Smith think?  Rogen is aces in my book but the real find is Jay Chou as Kato. Chou's Kato has a real alliance with the Hornet instead of just riding shotgun and displaying his karate moves.  Christoph Waltz extends his street cred that he established in ""Inglourious Basterds"" as the head of the Russian mob and he's as equally chilling and funny as he was in that movie.  James Franco has a terrific cameo as Waltz's ""competition"".  And how can you forget the cool cars and stunt work.

Anyway back to my review of the green hornet film. Like alot of other people when i heard that seth rogen was going to write and be the star of the film i was like no way is that going that going to work i really thought that we was just going to make it a spoof and like alot of people i was going to boycott the film but when i saw the trailer i was like wait this looks awsome. then i went to see it and i was like ok this to me is a big screen up date of the tv series of the 60's i come on there are plenty of reffrences to the old tv show and seth rogen in interviews said that he was a big fan of the series with van willimas and bruce lee and if you watch you will be able to spot all the reffrences that seth gives to the shows that have come before it. In closeing I think seth took a comicbook character that has been in hiatus for 50 years or what ever it's been and brought it up to date for a modern audience of today. I really like the fact that the film doesn't take it self to seriously.

4435144,2,B004MYH08U,"Much has been the case with many action/superhero movies over the past few years. Are the creators of these movies not sure if they're gonna make any money with their project or have action scenes become that expensive? If their gonna skimp out on the action scenes, how about writing a really good script that compensates for it. Well, they didn't really do that either.

Many of these movies are falling into the exact same cookie-cutter formula style movie making. Iron Man 2 must have had the exact same screenwriter. Introduce bad guy in the beginning, spend an hour or more delving into the personalities of the hero(s) and then pour everything you have into a slam-bam finale. Oh, and since there isn't a whole lot going on in the middle, have hero shoot fruit in a drunken stooper or have hero(s) fight each other for no good reason.

I give credit to the filmmakers for stepping away from the special f/x riddled movies we see these days, and keeping many of the stunts completely real, but everytime Jay Chou/Kato does his thing, does it have to be in slow motion? As real as the car chases and car smashes were, the fighting scenes were Matrix/Resident Evilish.

Green Hornet isn't a complete waste of time, but it was certainly disappointing in an ongoing calvade of movies being paraded out over the past few years that have no depth, creativity, no quality writing and seem to only have one goal in mind, to dazzle visually. GREEN HORNET doesn't even do that, and if it wasn't going to do that, then they should have written a script that grabbed us.

On a final note, Oscar winner, Christop Waltz ""Bloodnofsky"" was completely wasted in what could have been a great and memorable bad guy. Yet, he was delegated to a scene in the beginning, a short scene in the middle and the finale.",1305072000,,1797,4.60625

4435157,2,B004MYH08U,"I don't know if Van Williams is still alive, or Gordon Jones. If they're not, right about now, there's a chance that they're spinning around in their caskets. But if they're still with us, they're probably furiously digging a grave for Seth Rogen, a disrespectful gent what just torpedoed the Green Hornet franchise. If you're a fan of the 1960s television series with Van Williams and Bruce Lee - or even if you're a fan of the 1940 serial with Gordon Jones - this new adaptation may find you grinding your teeth. Of course, you may have the same reaction even if you're not familiar with the Green Hornet.

Some things change for the better, but this adaptation makes a case for entropy. Feckless playboy Britt Reid has just inherited his murdered father's crusading newspaper, the Daily Sentinel. Reid's alter ego, the Green Hornet, updated to these contemporary times, is still the scourge of the criminal underworld. He's still viewed as a villain by the police and the general public, which is all part of the plan as the Hornet had, from jump, meant to pose as a lawbreaker (and I actually find his reasoning for this logical as hell). This time, his purview is Los Angeles and his main villain an underworld crime boss who touts the hard-to-pronounce name of Chudnofsky. Chudnofsky, by the way, agonizes over his image, which he worries may not be intimidating enough. This becomes a running gag throughout the film and eventually results in Chudnofsky's assuming his own costumed persona, but a lame one. Behold Chudnofsky as he becomes... Bloodnofsky. Everyone must now cower.

What were they thinking, the powers that be? That to properly revive a once popular pulp hero, it required a comedic swerve? Seth Rogen is absolutely wrong for the Green Hornet role. And since Rogen gets co-writing and co-producing creds here, much of what happens onscreen has to be laid at his feet. A touch of humor is always welcome and appreciated, but only so far as it services story and plot and even characterization. The Green Hornet ain't supposed to be frivolous and silly like the Mask. You couldn't tell that in this movie.

Even more egregious than the off-putting comedic tone is Rogen's choice of how Britt Reid is portrayed. His Britt is abrasive and buffoonish, which I guess is okay to start with. But as the movie went on, Rogen doesn't do or say anything to redeem his character or make him more appealing. He starts out obnoxious and then treads water. And this Britt Reid, he's not even clever. No wonder he becomes envious of Kato.

Speaking of, one of the film's few saving graces is Jay Chou as Kato, inventor extraordinaire, expert kung fu master, and Britt Reid's right hand man. Kato is clearly the brains in this operation, and this eventually becomes a source of tension between the two. There are some rough patches in which you can't make out what he's saying because of his thick accent, but Chou carries himself well. Kato's resourcefulness and his fight scenes are the film's highlights, although the one knock against his fight scenes is that there was this clear catering to 3D, and so we get those extraneous special effects.

Some other saving graces? I thought the Hornet's Black Beauty - a sleek 1965 Chrysler Imperial - was awesome. And the gas gun. And, okay, I did appreciate the exploration into the hero-sidekick relationship, and the neat swerve of the sidekick being ridiculously more capable than the lead hero.

Cameron Diaz comes in as the eye candy that drives a wedge between the Hornet and Kato. Tom Wilkinson and Edward James Olmos spend their time onscreen avoiding eye contact with their self-esteem. What does it say about the film when the best moment it offers may be when the Hornet and Kato are in their tricked-out ride singing along to 2Pac's ""Gangsta's Paradise""? Or, wait, maybe the best scene is the one in which Britt Reid tries to come up with a code name for his new alter ego, and he arrives at ""the Green Bee."" Or maybe that's just wishful thinking. Because THE GREEN BEE may have fared better. It doesn't come with the baggage of nostalgic expectations. Somewhere, Nicolas Cage is still marveling over his good luck. He abandoned ship just in time.

The DVD's bonus stuff (which features Seth Rogen's incredibly annoying laugh): Audio Commentary by Seth Rogen & co-writer Evan Goldberg, director Michel Gondry, and producer Neil Moritz; the ""Awesoom"" gag reel (00:07:19 minutes long); ""The Black Beauty: Rebirth of Cool"" - a segment focusing on the Green Hornet and Kato's ride (00:07:19 minutes); and a segment in which co-writers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg discuss their writing of THE GREEN HORNET (00:10:36).",1304726400,3,4677,4.831460674157303

I had not previously seen the movie in the theater, so I was going cold into this. I did watch the original Green Hornet (with Bruce Lee), when it was initially shown.  First, the ads, commercials, and previews are taking up more and more time on these disks these days. In this case it was about 20 min worth, half of which were Sony ads for 3D. The Blu-Ray, itself, was ok - nice and crisp, good colors, etc. Amazon delivered it very promptly.

Next, Bruce Lee is probably turning over in his grave about this movie. Superheroes should be superheroes. It's OK if they were initially bad and then realize that they should do good (examples - The Shadow and Iron Man). However, I have absolutely no empathy with this Green Hornet. He starts out as a spoiled brat and then goes around creating excess property damage of innocent people, especially with police cars. He also walks all over Kato and, in general, acts like a creep with his employees. When he tears up those police cars and then rolls them, after a while you ask yourself, ""Was anyone hurt?""  I don't know if he ultimately repented, since after a hour and a half I gave up on it.

In this movie they essentially ask the question, ""Is it ok to do bad things to achieve a good result?"" The answer is, of course, no. This guy isn't a role model for anyone. There are a bunch of other movies out in the theaters right now that are better (THOR?). Save your money on this one.

Regardless whether we're talking about a pulp fiction vigilante, radio serial adventurer, or comic book crime fighter, the one thing a hero can't be is selfish or cowardly.

And unfortunately, Seth Rogen's portrayal of the classic radio serial vigilante of the '30's and '40's, and tv masked crime fighter of the 1960's (for which this movie is based on) contains both of those traits.

Sure, the hero can (and should) have flaws.  That's what makes him identifiable to the audience.

But THIS ""Green Hornet"" actually ABANDONS Kato during a botched sting.  He even yells out, ""Every man for himself!""

At that point, I knew I wasted money seeing this.

It wouldn't be fair to compare Seth Rogen to either Gordon Jones (the movie matinee serial) or Van Williams (the '60's tv show), since a movie and actor should be taken on his own merits.

But a cowardly, selfish ""hero?""

4435172,5,B004MYH08U,"Literally, this is a remaking of the Green Hornet origins, while remaining as faithful as possible to what the audience has always accepted. To compare it to the television series of 1966-67 is a little disingenuous to say the least, since the concept reaches as far back as the 1930's on radio. So, in looking at the reviews here that cast a disparaging view upon the movie based upon the television program one must consider them ill conceived. The movie is faithful to the original concept. Reid takes the guise of a hero posing as a villain.

Kato has changed over the years, though. Originally Kato was Japanese, but as the show developed he morphed into a Filipino character (probably due to World War II). I don't recall any reference to nationality in the television series, but probably due to Bruce Lee's influence the character is purely Chinese today. It would make more sense for Kato to be Filipino today, but here we are.

So many of the reviews I have seen are negative, and yet I see nothing in the movie that calls for it. This movie deserves better from its audience. Go back again watch the 1966-67 series and if you really think things were better then, well I just can't conceive of why anyone would.

4435179,3,B004MYH08U,"Okay, okay, I was not alive or even young enough to know or remember the Green Hornet on the radio, in print, or eventually on the very good 60's tv series.  When I was a child I did get to see most of the 60's tv series on television and enjoyed it very much.  It didn't hurt that I was a virgining Bruce Lee mega-fan at the time either.  I would love to revisit that show now, especially after watching the film version of The Green Hornet got me all jonzed up for it.

This film version is nowhere near as bad as many of the fanboys would have you believe.  I'm not sure what some non-Green Hornet initiated people were expecting, but I understand the Fanboy backlash.  I mean, even if it was more like the previous incarnations they would find something to complain about, I mean that's what they do.  They're fanboys.  They spend most of their time complaining about things they say they hate, but can't seem to stop talking about.  Weird.....Anyway, the film takes an anti-super hero movie approach.  In other words it does the opposite of what would normally happen in these types of films.  I'll try to elaborate with a list:

Firstly, there's a love interest of sorts in the film.  Both Kato and the Hornet are after her, but she doesn't seem to like either.  There's no closure on the romance section. ""Whenever I watch one of these super hero type flicks the thing I care the least about is the romance"", is what Roegen said regarding his screenplay in one of the blu ray disc's special features.

Secondly, said love interest, played spunkily by Cameron Diaz, is the brains behind the whole Green Hornet operation without knowing it.  Kato and Hornet are presented as slackers who have a dream of being heroes but really don't know what they're doing or how to go about it.  This is fun.  They are over their heads and know nothing about crime.  The Diaz character guides them unwittingly into their game plan.  Very neat.

Thirdly, the villain is not a super villain.  The film makes it a point to show how mundane he is.  As the Hornet emerges he starts to think in terms of theatrics.  He wants to amp up his image and become a super villain because the emergance of two super heroes.  Christoph Waltz plays 'Bloodnosky' and has the funniest lines and delivery for my money. He's not played menacingly as he played the Nazi in Ingourious Basterds, but as impotent.  It's great.  Sure, he's a sociopath by his cold actions and random killings, but not by appearance and performance.  Very original and cool.

Those are the three main twists here involving the super hero genre.  There's more but they're less important.  Obviously, this film is as much a comedy as an action film.  Basically Hornet and Kato are a virging 'bromance' and they play out their relationships similar to the way characters do in other Roegen penned scripts like Pineapple Express and Superbad.  Basically take that type of interaction and throw in a typical super hero plot and origin and you have the Green Hornet.

Now why this film is only a three star affair for me comes down to how effective it is.  The action sequences are well handled and the whole concept of 'kato-vision' is ingenious and a fun way to portray karate fights, which are sooooo played out in cinema at this point.  The third act climax action is great and exciting, funny, and fun.  A great way to finish up the film.  Roegen and Chou's chemistry as budding buddies and crimefighters is very effective, sweet, and funny.  THe problem is that the whole plot and situations never feel like they're really happening or could really happen.  Everything is too lite and airy for their to be any real suspense or drama.  The tone of characterization should've shifted more by the end of hte second act.  Roegen doesn't seem to transition totally from frat boy to hero at the end.  Which would be fine with me if the film wasn't trying to convince of otherwise.

This film reminded me of Big Trouble in Little China.  Basically in that film there was a white star and a Chinese sidekick.  The joke was that the white lead thought he was the hero and acted like it, despite the fact that he was  goofball and inept.  The Chinese sidekick was the real hero.  He did most of the fight and knew how to handle himself better.  It's a funny concept, but Big Trouble in Little China did it a lot better than the Green Hornet, thanks mostly to Kurt Russell's very funny lead performance.

In conclusion, The Green Hornet is good enough.  It won't satisfy most old school Hornet fans.  Why should they fret, the comics and tv show still exist, so they will always have that going for them.  This film may lead to younger generations discovering the older incarnations of the Green Hornet and that's a great.  As a film on its own terms it's funny, but not hysterical.  There's not enough real meat to feel or invest in, but the action is exciting and our heroes have a great chemistry.  Worth a rent, but by no means a super hero classic.",1304467200,3,4989,4.530269058295964
4435180,3,B004MYH08U,"In the sixties the comic book icon Batman was turned into a television series that was low on detective seasoning and high on camp. The show became so popular that it was soon followed by a spin off, The Green Hornet, based on the pulp fiction/radio show character from the past. The show never took off like Batman did, but it did introduce the world to martial arts expert Bruce Lee as the Hornet's sidekick Kato. Talk of a new film version of the series went on for years, even Kevin Smith the director of CLERKS was involved at one point. So fans were delighted to see the Hornet finally appear on the big screen.

Seth Rogen stars as Britt Reid, the goofball son of publisher James Reid (Tom Wilkinson). The senior Reid puts out The Daily Sentinel, a newspaper that prides itself on reporting the real news and focuses on the issues of crime that happen daily in Los Angeles. When suddenly dies of a bee sting, Britt is left in charge as well as left to finally grow up.

Despondent at first and unable to fill his father's shoes, Britt turns to the man who took care of his father's cars and who made his coffee, Kato (Jay Chou). In Kato he discovers a kindred spirit; someone who loved yet felt much anger at his father and a man who feels a need for heroes much as Britt does.

Through a misadventure in which they save a couple from an attack by thugs, the pair decides to take on crime in LA. Kato sets out pimping their ride, a car now armed to the gills with missiles, machine guns, a flame thrower and more. Then Britt turns the newspaper on its ear, insisting that they do extensive coverage of the Hornet, going so far as to come up with his name. The next thing they do is hire an assistant for Britt, Lenore Case (Cameron Diaz), who knows more about crime than he does, going so far as to predict what the Green Hornet will do next. In truth, her predictions become their directions.

It seems that the entire criminal element in LA is run by one man, Benjamin Chudnovsky (Christoph Waltz), a bloodthirsty criminal who has made it his life's ambition to control crime from top to bottom. Chudnovsky makes a point of striking fear in those who would oppose him. And when the Green Hornet starts interfering with his operations, the Hornet becomes his number one target.

So does it work? In some ways very much so but in most not quite. As with the recent GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, we're presented with a star that needs someone to rein him in, to mold him into the character rather than have the character twist into something its not. Rogen can be a great actor at times but here he tends to run wild and use certain mannerisms that he has in past roles, none of which tend to enhance the character of Britt Reid. Instead much of the movie has Britt as the same goofball he was when the film started except rather than party non-stop he behaves like a kid who finally gets the chance to play the hero. It would have been nice to see the change in Britt come about far earlier in the film than it does and to have left more of the comedy out. The story deserves more action and less comedy.

Chou does a great job of presenting himself here. Pretty much an unknown in the U.S., he does a fantastic job of combining martial arts mastery with acting ability, much like Bruce Lee did when first starting out. The scenes with Chou feel more like the Green Hornet than do those with Rogen.

The supporting cast seems just to be walking through. Waltz shows less of the menace in his character here than he did in INGLORIOUS BASTARDS. And Diaz seems to have such a minor part as to nearly qualify as a cameo.

Much of the film comes together towards the last 20 minutes or so. It would have been nice to see many of the things that work well there happen 30 minutes earlier and the movie be taken a bit more seriously than it was. Instead, while entertaining enough, the film seems more like a Seth Rogen vehicle and less a comic hero film. Was it enough to garner a sequel? Doubtful, the box office wasn't stupendous, something Hollywood expects these days. If one does come about, let's hope they find a director willing to tell Rogen to rope it in and to play it straight for once. He has the ability, now he needs someone in charge to convince him of it.",1304467200,2,4263,4.346733668341709

Truthfully, superhero movies are not really my thing.  I may have enjoyed them thirty years ago, but I have long since outgrown that sort of entertainment.

Thus, I was somewhat pleasantly surprised when I started viewing this new version of THE GREEN HORNET, primarily because it's really a spoof of the genre.  Much of the film works, but also much of it doesn't work.

As all loyal followers of this superhero know, The Green Hornet is a masked vigilante whose real identity is multi-millionaire Britt Reid, and his trusted sidekick, Kato, assists him.

In this version, Reid is played as a wealthy, egotistical, somewhat cowardly, schmuck who dreams of being a superhero, and it's his driver, Kato, who is really the brains and the kick-ass brawn of the duo.

That's a very funny concept, and it works quite a bit of the time...until it becomes tired, repetitive and disintegrates into little more than a special effects/CGI action movie.  That's sad, because this picture could have become a classic lampoon, much like MEN IN BLACK was to sci-fi films.

Seth Rogen, who co-wrote the uneven screenplay with Evan Goldberg, is quite good as Reid and Jay Chou is a perfect choice for Kato.  However, it's Christoph Waltz' amusing, low-key playing of the demented super-villain that you'll remember most in this handsomely produced film.

I know more about this genre than a lot of other people probably do because I've been studying it in the hopes of one day writing a book and I can say without hesitation that The Green Hornet is one of my all time favorites, up there with Kick Ass, The Shadow, Superman, X-Men 2 and Batman: Mask of the Phantasm.

The film is, in a word, fun, perfectly blending action, comedy and suspense to make something that is nothing less than a celebration of everything that makes superheroes awesome. I admit that when I first heard of this film, I was unsure about it, but rest assured that Seth Rogan as The Hornet is like Michael Keaton as Batman. You wouldn't think he could pull it off, but he does, with style. Jay Chou is also perfectly cast as Kato and his condecension towards and exasperation with Britt Ried provides some of the film's funniest bits.

In a world with very few Buddy Super hero comics (Luke cage and Iron Fist, and Batman and Robin being the only two majors printing today) and even fewer movies, it was great seeing a film about friendship.  This was the Green Hornets Origin, and we see how a selfish, and lazy rich boy, becomes a super-hero.  Not to spoil anything, but by the end, The Green Hornet becomes a fighter who can hold his own, and even reveals his own deductive ""super-power.""

4435214,4,B004MYH08U,"As a Michel Gondry fan I was a bit skeptical, as a superhero fan I was suspicious and as someone who has enjoyed Seth Rogen's work in the past I was doubtful however this film impressed me.  It is rare to see an action comedy movie that is actually funny and that is what works in The Green Hornet.  If we compare Green Hornet to the three big superhero franchises of the past decade it comes out on top of all of them.

It is nastier than Batman - for all its gritty realism Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight saga is a bit to high gloss surface and spectacle over substance while Green Hornet has the feel of an eighties action flick where the violence is a little more out of control.

It is more fun than Spiderman - the awful Tobey Maguire spiderman never seems to enjoy his powers.  Rogen on the other hand does little but.  Mostly thanks to Gondry this film is like seeing a comicbook brought to life an effect none of the other series have been able to achieve.

It's less comercial than Iron Man - I know, I know, Iron Man is a Marvel Disney film and therefore is designed to please everybody and offend nobody but that is the opposite of what fans of comic books want.  Comics are the punk rock of literature and work best when parents and teachers disapprove.  Green Hornet is definetely made for the audience of teen boys who will love it rather than older folks who will merely like it.

That all said what makes this a good film is the supporting cast Jay Chou is hilarious and upstages Rogen (as Kato should).  Cristoph Waltz is clearly having fun - and making me look forward to Three Musketeers.  Tom Wilkinson is perfect in his cameo (and how pleased are we to see an American film where the death of a parent is not the end of the world.)  And Cameron  Diaz is both stunning and funny (and how pleased are we to see an American film where the jerky hero does not get the girl.)",1301356800,2,1893,4.266106442577031

4435235,2,B004MYH08U,"The 2011 ""Green Hornet"" film opens with an arch-villain Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz) gently asking (= threatening) a club owner and drug dealer ""Crystal Cleer"" (uncredited James Franco) to hand over the business to him. It is fun as the two actors know what they are doing, delivering delightfully scenery-chewing performances. To me the opening is the best part of the film. And the Green Hornet is not in it.

Seth Rogen (who also co-wrote and co-executive produced the film) is Britt Reid / The Green Hornet. He first appears as a 28-year-old slacker of a Los Angels newspaper publisher James Reid (Tom Wilkinson). Unlike most superhero films (or any films for that matter), they are not very likable persons. James is an arrogant and domineering father. Britt is just a spoiled son with no redeeming grace whatever.

But you expect something happen to Brit, like character development. Not much. Seth Rogen remains unconvincing as the protagonist (was he?) throughout ""The Green Hornet."" He talks too much, but does little. What does he want to be, a crime-fighting hero or a self-conscious parody of the genre? Or just an annoyingly goofy playboy?

Jay Chou fares slightly better as Kato. After all his character (once played by legendary Bruce Lee) can do something, like doing martial arts and making good coffee. Cameron Diaz appears as Lenore, newly-hired secretary and love interest, a thankless role made for the film's unnecessary romantic subplot. As to the actions, well, the action sequences are not great, not knowing when to stop. They lack rhythm and style. They break things a lot and that's all.

Finally the film is directed by Michel Gondry. Those who expected (like me) a happy marriage of action/superhero genre and his imagination of ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" will be disappointed. Like his previous feature film ""Be Kind Rewind"" something is not right about the film, as if he is not really allowed to show what he can do.",1297728000,8,1962,4.972560975609756

4435237,4,B004MYH08U,"First things first: if you're a devoted, faithful fan of the George W. Trendle's vigilante hero The Green Hornet, or any of the subsequent adaptations since then, perhaps you should stay away from this update, which would rather poke fun at the increasingly overcrowded superhero genre. Co-writer/co-producer/star Seth Rogen stays firmly within his usual wheelhouse, despite having dropped a good deal of weight for the role, throwing more one-liners than kicks and punches. His Hornet/Britt Reid is a self-centered rich boy motivated to do some good by the death of his ""tough-love"" father and an excess of wealth and time. The joke, as it were (ala Big Trouble in Little China) is that Kato is the real hero, doing everything from putting together the Black Beauty to taking out all of the pair's opponents).

Secondly, it helps to know that the film was directed by French auteur Michel Gondry, the man responsible for hundreds of innovative music videos (most famously, the LEGO-animated ""Fell in Love With a Girl"" by the White Stripes) and the popular, artful films Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and The Science of Sleep. On one hand, it might seem odd that Gondry would choose to direct a studio action movie, but look a little closer, and there's an intriguing parallel between the pairing of Rogen and Gondry and the pairing of Britt and Kato. Not that I have anything against Rogen (I'd wager if he heard this theory, he'd just laugh it off), but it's funny to imagine Gondry as Kato, the oddball inventor who puts record players in car seats and sees in ""Kato-Vision"", which allows him to single out points of danger and eliminate them one by one, while substituting Britt's desire to play ""Green Hornet"" with Rogen's desire to make The Green Hornet with himself as the lead character.

Beyond that, the film is a bit uneven. Although the idea of a neurotic, self-conscious mobster is very funny, there needs to be more meat on the scenes with Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz). The only one that registers as much as it should is the first, in which Chudnofsky threatens a younger gangster (""My gun has two barrels; that's not boring.""). Cameron Diaz is wasted in a thankless role that could've been fixed with a little re-arranging of responsibilities during the second and third acts. Britt, finally, may be a little TOO grating; although it's all part of the joke, Rogen might've wanted to pull him back a touch. That said, there's still enough solid comedy to float the average viewer's boat, and fans of Gondry will see his fingerprints everywhere (the aforementioned two-barreled gun, the execution of ""Kato-Vision"" (and any other fight scenes with Chou), and pretty much everything during the big third-act finale, from glass elevators to half-cars to a sea of paper rolls in a printing press. Plus, it's nice to see a superhero that isn't so dark; eat your heart out, Chris Nolan, but sometimes some pure, unbridled fun is appreciated.",1297641600,4,2957,4.900199600798403
4435238,3,B004MYH08U,"""The Green Hornet"" (2011) shown in 3D features Seth Rogen as Britt Reid who becomes The Green Hornet. He's the kind of over-the-top comic who can become very annoying and exasperating if you're not on his wave length. It helps if you have an adolescent fondness for zany and oafish playground humor. The real star of the movie is Jay Chou as Kato.
 Britt is a party animal who who lives a wasted existence until his tyrannical father, James Reid (Tom Wilkinson), mysteriously kicks the bucket via a bee sting. Britt inherits the family newspaper. When he meets his father's chauffeur, the brainy Kato who has designed fantastic cars, Britt decides to be a crime fighter, but to be different, he chooses to be a vigilante. With his inherited newspaper he can build up the Green Hornet as a bad guy. Kato builds a car, the Black Beauty, which has more gizmos, gadgets, and armament than any James Bond vehicle.
 Britt is a klutz, a know-it-all who knows nothing. He can't fight. He thinks he's great, is an egomaniac who after Kato beats up a gang of toughs tries to take the credit and denigrate his sidekick, but Kato has spunk and won't sit back and be a flunky. Kato is a terrific martial arts fighter and seems to have super powers. He can whip up elaborate inventions in a few days. He's the muscle and brains of that outfit.
 Britt thinks he can get any woman he wants, but he better look out for Kato. The movie has a love interest, but you'll be surprised at who ends up with the girl.
 There's way too much mayhem in this, and the car violence gets tiresome. The Green Hornet seems to wipe out as many cops as bad guys.
 If this movie succeeds, I can see sequels lying in wait, but they could very quickly become tiresome just as this film does. Parts are boring and Rogen can wear down the moviegoer who's not on his whiny track. He's a comic playing a comic book hero, but playing the character for laughs can be dangerous. It's part of the crime-fighter and sidekick genre played for yacks more than kicks. There's some crude stuff not for kids.
 Britt as a youngster was humiliated when his father took his toy caped superhero doll and tore the head off it. So what does the boy-man do as his first super-hero stunt? He cuts the head off a statue placed in his father's honor at the gravesite.
 It's a goofy movie so be prepared. Get ready for lots of mad-cap action, wild car chases, explosions, yucks and jokes. There's a monumental fight between Kato and Britt. No one could possibly escape from that melee without bruises and wounds, but these two do. The villains chasing the fearless duo in the newspaper plant is a long scene that could be condensed. The film is too long and drawn-out and needs closer editing and tightening.",1296864000,9,2745,4.488977955911824

4435240,3,B004MYH08U,"In an effort to battle the exorbitant cost of 3D movies (especially the ones that undergo 3D conversion post-production), I went to the Sunday matinee showing of The Green Hornet. I don't know if that's really the optimal environment for a superhero movie, but I do know that I felt super awesome seeing a movie by myself in a theater lightly sprinkled with moms. What made me even more awesome was my flirtation with the cute ticket taker and cashier, only to have them realize that I was friendless at the movies and therefore genetically undesirable for the production of offspring. But hey, free parking downtown on Sundays! Which makes me wonder...how many of those moms were actually angry San Luis Obispo meter maids?

As my stylish RealD glasses weighed down on my nose (which, by the end of the movie, was acting rather affronted), the previews drew to a close, and what followed was a moderately entertaining film. By no means a perfect creation, The Green Hornet lived up to its Buzz with charm enough to overcome the fact that it was little more than a souped-up, buddy-cop movie. While its generic overarching plot had a bit of originality Nested here and there, what really kept things aloft was Seth Rogen's light-hearted tone and performance. Britt Reid (Seth Rogen) and Kato (Jay Chou) were fun characters to watch and had pretty good chemistry. I believed their friendship, their obligatory fallout, and their eventual reconciliation, and I laughed out loud at lines like ""Do some of that Ben Hur stuff!"" Sadly, I was the only one who laughed during the entire movie. Man, those parking enforcement officers really don't have souls.

As always, Cameron Diaz was totally useless. She is the Queen of inane, managing to evoke a sense of lifelessness in every role. She Bumbles through her character, Droning on and basically adding nothing. At least it was a new take on the love interest. She wasn't really interested, and neither was she interesting. In fact, I feel like she was almost more objectified this way. Rather than either of the main characters forming a connection with her, she simply served as a vehicle for Britt and Kato's argument. I guess that's what they get for trying to stick their Proboscises where they don't belong.

Speaking of vehicles, the Black Beauty was one of the sweetest cars ever. The sheer number of weapons and gadgets made it the coolest thing since MIB's red button. What wasn't particularly sweet was the bad guy. In an attempt at humor, the villain constantly worried about his image and his hard-to-pronounce name, and he was right to. He just wasn't intimidating. I never felt the Sting of real fear or the sweet Nectar of joy at any point during the film.

One of the more interesting stylistic choices comes partway through the movie when the villain puts a bounty on the Green Hornet's head. The shot then enters an ever-expanding split screen as word of the reward spreads through all the different circles of evil, from the Thorax of malcontent to the Mandibles of hate. Watching the sheer number of thugs on the screen grow as they receive their mission really does add a sense of dread to an otherwise threat-free story. More and more split-screens kept showing up until I was so overwhelmed that I couldn't keep track of them anymore. I waited for the repercussions of this onslaught, only to watch as the group of villains murdered a ton of innocent people wearing green and then never reappeared. And just like that, the sense of dread was gone.

The Green Hornet was basically fun. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and there's some entertaining action and comedy. In no way does it surpass expectations, however, and many other films are better able to embrace the genre. If you've got some extra cash and a bunch of guys are sitting around bored, it might be worth checking this out, but otherwise you should probably just wait until it's on Netflix.

4435244,2,B004MYH08U,"What's good: Action, physical comedy, and a brief nod to Bruce Lee who had the Kato role all those years ago. (Watch the sketchbook.)

What's not: Sane plot, Cameron Diaz, acting like a grownup. I mean, all those things are great in themselves, but they're just not used in this flick. (Diaz is under-used to a baffling degree - this could have been just her kind of flick, if they let it be.)

Seth Rogen, in his role as the spoiled rich kid, is simply obnoxious. Except for the hefty paycheck, I can't think of a reason in the world for Kato to hang around and take the abuse. In fact, that abuse flows out of the screen and onto the audience. If that's what you want, humor a cut above jokes about passing gas, have fun. I shouldn't have bothered.

4435245,2,B004MYH08U,"I've said it before, I'll say it again. January is a wasteland at the multiplex. The studios are too busy concentrating on award buzz for the films released in December. Some of these films receiving buzz may get a wider release in January, to capitalize on the nominations, leading to more box office, keeping the film current and viable until the big daddy of award shows, the Oscars. They simply don't have time to adequately promote a new wide release. For that reason, January (and early September) is a dumping ground; any film getting a wide release is a film the studio has zero confidence in. These films have been ""delayed"" a few times, or you might see a notice in the newspaper indicating the ""studio declined to screen the film in time for a review"". These are bad signs but generally good indicators you need to stay clear.

For this reason, we have ""Season of the Witch"", ""The Dilemma"" and ""The Green Hornet"" hitting screens in our neighborhood.

By late January, the fervor has cleared and they begin to release new films they have time to get behind, new films they expect to see generate revenue. It is generally safer to go back to the multiplex. ""The Green Hornet"", the new superhero adaptation starring Seth Rogen, Jay Chou and Cameron Diaz is being released in the middle of January. It presents a conundrum.

Columbia Pictures must be trying to fill a void with a brilliant counter-programming move. Well, yes and no. There are a lot of reasons to think ""Hornet"" might be the exception to the rule. And it is better than most of the films released in January. But it is still not very good. And paying extra to see the film in 3-D sort of rubs salt into the wounds, making an OK film even worse. Don't even think of seeing this film in IMAX 3-D. It is not worth it.

The first reason you might suspect the film will be OK? It seems to have been a passion project for Seth Rogen. He has been everywhere, promoting the film, he has talked about it while promoting other films, he lost a lot of weight to play the role, and he even wrote the script with his longtime writing partner Evan Goldberg. All of this points to a famous comedy star trying to break out of the confines of the genre and work in a new and exciting area. I am sure he saw Robert Downey Jr.'s current rise to uber-stardom as ""Iron Man"" and wanted to give it a try.

Rogen clearly wants people to enjoy this passion project as much as he does. But there are certain things we expect from a superhero movie. You want a believable back-story leading to the hero's creation or emergence. You want great action scenes mixed with a little humor (maybe) to keep things moving. You want a believable, scary villain. The major problem with ""The Green Hornet"" is the mix of action and humor is completely, horribly off balance. Much of the film involves Britt Reid (Rogen) having discussions with Kato (Jay Chou), Lenore Case (Diaz) and Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz, ""Inglourious Basterds"") in which Reid takes on the laid-back persona Rogen has perfected and has a riff with his co-stars about something, anything. These moments almost seem ad-libbed and pointless. In fact, in many instances, the person Reid is having a conversation with doesn't seem to get or be in on the joke. This creates an odd disconnect; Rogen seems like he is trying to be funny, what he says seems like it should be funny, it would be funny in ""Knocked Up"" or ""Superbad"", but he is more often than not delivering these lines to a brick wall.

Rogen is smart enough to realize he isn't going to be able to pull of the lion's share of the action. So they found Jay Chou, a Taiwanese actor, to play Kato. His action scenes are good. But every time he delivers a line of dialogue, it is almost painful to watch and listen to. I highly suspect he had a dialogue coach standing off screen feeding him the lines phonetically. What this doesn't do is help him understand the meanings of the lines. His performance is a bit like watching Robert DeNiro, Michael Phelps or January Jones host ""Saturday Night Live"". During every live segment, they read their lines from a teleprompter unable to infuse the dialogue with any meaning. They are all clearly out of their element and their comfort zone.

The scenes between Rogen and Diaz are just confusing and painful to witness. Reid, a former playboy, openly ogles Diaz's Lenore Case, his new assistant. Every time they talk, Rogen begins the conversation with an awkward come on she ignores. This banter goes on for a few minutes before they get to the reason for the conversation. This happens every time they talk and it is never remotely funny. Even worse, there are similar scenes between Kato and Lenore, which are also painful, but for other reasons. Really, the dialogue seems like it was written by a twelve-year-old fan-boy for other twelve-year-olds. I half expected Rogen's character to say ""ass"" and then start giggling madly.

Rogen realizes the villain needs to be scary and menacing. The writers address this in their typical way; the villain discusses the issue himself with others who question his effectiveness. This is actually an amusing idea and the funniest running gag in the film. When we first meet Chudnofsky (Waltz) he barges into the nightclub of a rival who criticizes his lack of scariness. But there are many examples throughout the film illustrating this Chudnofsky's ruthlessness. Yet, the villain still has a complex about it. The role is a balancing act. On the one hand, Waltz has to reveal the character's self-doubt, playing the part a tad seriously for us to get the joke. But he also has to be tongue-in-cheek throughout. Waltz achieves this balance and is the best thing in the film.

For all of the exposition, all of the discussions in the film, there are quite a few things left unanswered, or not given enough attention or explanation. The most important of these would have to be why the Green Hornet feels he has to fight crime while portraying a criminal. They go so far as to make it look like the Green Hornet shoots Reid. There are a few scenes in which Reid talks with someone about a new aspect of his mission as the Green Hornet. They discuss a few options and then Reid latches on to one, smiles broadly and shouts, ""That's it. Good job my friend"". Rogen smiles goofily and they are off. It seems as though Rogen expects us to take his overt enthusiasm as reason enough for this idea or theory to exist. If these moments existed with other scenes depicting a better realization, they would work. Rogen's fan-boy enthusiasm is not enough. These moments seem intended to illustrate the Green Hornet's creation, but in reality they simply amount to a series of exclamations.

One of the primary reasons I thought ""Hornet"" might be a surprise is the director, Michel Gondry. Best known for ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", Gondry is a strange choice to helm a super hero film. I was hoping the combination would be more strange-good and less strange-Ang Lee-""Incredible Hulk"". His work is actually a little of both. There are a few strange, odd touches in the film. When Kato and Reid are fighting some street thugs, Kato kicks one and he goes flying over the trunk of a car. The trunk seems to multiply and extend almost as though Gondry is trying to give the impression of 3-D in a 2-D film. It is a fun, interesting sort of retro idea.

Gondry wants to present a more realistic vision. At times, dust floats through the air highlighted by a ray of sunshine, at others, the sun causes light flares as the camera passes. Both of these touches make the film seem more real and personal, but they also obscure the 3-D elements in the film. If the 3-D added depth to the film, it wouldn't matter that the new process doesn't enhance the action. But it doesn't, so you kind of want, and expect the 3-D to help the action pop. But because Gondry seems to relish using corny, older techniques to give the illusion of 3-D, these moments lose any power they may have had.

""The Green Hornet"" is a disappointment and further proof you should stay away from any studio film receiving a wide release in early January.",1296086400,13,8163,4.606602475928473
4435246,1,B004MYH08U,"The Green Hornet is a mystery film.  The mystery is in how so many talented people working together could end up producing something this mind-bogglingly lame?

Consider the talent involved:

Michael Gondry, Director - winner of Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, director of imaginative films like The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The Science of Sleep, and Be Kind Rewind.

Seth Rogen, Writer and actor - winner of Emmy award for comedy writing

Jay Chou, actor - one of the top singers, song-writers and actors in the Chinese movie and music scene today

Tom Wilkinson, actor - twice nominated for Oscar, winner of BAFTA, Golden Globe, Emmy and Screen Actors Guild awards

Christoph Waltz, actor - winner of Oscar, BAFTA, Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild awards for Best Supporting Actor

Edward James Olmos, actor - nominated for Oscar, winner of Golden Globe and Emmy awards

David Harbour, actor - nominated for Tony award

Cameron Diaz, actress - nominated for BAFTA and Screen Actors Guild awards, winner of Golden Globe award

James Newton Howard, musical score - multiple nominations for Grammy, Emmy and Oscar awards for music scores and songs, winner of Grammy and Emmy for music score and song

All this talent - and a final budget somewhere around $120M - and yet all we have to show for it is an inane half-baked script, badly acted, made as a 3D film for no discernable reason whatsoever, and arguably one of the worst adaptations of a super-hero character ever made into a film, which considering the genre is really saying something (it's worse than Daredevil, Catwoman, Ghost Rider and all Punisher movies combined).

There are so many things wrong with The Green Hornet that it's really hard to know where to begin.  It was a bad sign that, five minutes into the film I was already getting a really bad feeling about what I was seeing and was wondering if it was too late to slip out and catch some other movie instead. Having sat through the entire god-awful mess, I can tell you know that if you've seen the trailer for the film, then you've already seen 90 percent of everything worth seeing in the entire movie. If you have not seen the movie yet, then you can still spare yourself the experience of enduring a complete waste of your time.

It's almost a toss-up as to what the biggest single problem was: Seth Rogen or the script. Seth Rogen, who can be hysterically funny, is lost here, as if he wandered onto the wrong movie set by mistake. At no point even remotely believable as an action hero, he mugs his way through the film like he's improvising a sequel to Pineapple Express, completely trashing the Brit Reid / Green Hornet character. As for the rest of the cast, even the best actors cannot overcome bad characterizations and criminally lame dialogue. Christoph Waltz, the truly charming and chilling villain Col. Landa in Inglourious Basterds, in this film is reduced to being Chudnofsky, about the lamest crime lord the film world has ever seen:

Chudnofsky: ""You said I'm boring.  My gun has 2 barrels - that's not boring and it was very difficult to make.""

Tupper:  ""Look, trust me, a grown man wearing a mask is a little scarier than a guy wearing a suit.""
Chudnofsky: ""You're not pleased with my suit? Does it fail to fill you with fear?""
Tupper:  ""Sorry, I didn't mean to disrespect.""
Chudnofsky: ""Do you have any idea how many great people have killed in a suit?""

Chudnofsky: ""I was gonna have people call me 'Bloodnofsky'. I was gonna wear red for blood, get it? That's scary _and_ cool.""

Edward James Olmos, as the newspaper's top editor, spends most of his time scowling and looking like all he wants to do is get paid so he can get off the set and out of this mess. Tom Wilkinson as Brit Reid's publisher father is probably the luckiest actor in the film as he gets to die about 10 minutes into the movie.  Cameron Diaz is there presumably as the love interest, which seems strange after the fact as the script has her rejecting and then beating up on both Rogen and Chou. To make matters worse, there is zero chemistry between her and Rogen or Chou, a lack that is made even starker by the fact that Diaz is ten years older than Rogen and seven years older than Chou.

This didn't have to happen. This could have been either a really funny comedy or a great straight pulp-hero action film, but it feels as if no one involved could ever make up their mind and so it ends up being neither. There are a few funny bits (almost all of which are in the trailer) but most of the film just isn't funny. The jokes suffer from being lame and from atrociously bad timing.  Everyone's timing feels off, even in the parts that are supposed to be just straight acting. It's like watching the cast doing a walk-through for the first time.  Everything feels disjointed, disconnected. Adding to the stiffness are huge lumps of exposition where characters relate either what they've done or what they're going to do, and other scenes where it seems like no one could figure out what they were supposed to do so they just improvised.

The only halfway decent thing about Green Hornet is Jay Chou as an updated and hyper-competent Kato, but even his character is crippled by inanities. Like the fact that he's supposed to be a super-tough martial arts street-fighter... but he keeps going down after getting kicked in the balls. Or pushed into a swimming pool where it's revealed he can't swim. Or having to engage in a ridiculously long fight with Rogen whose sorry butt he apparently cannot manage to successfully kick, in spite of his previously having taken out entire groups of armed thugs without breaking a sweat.

Among the many things in The Green Hornet that obviously weren't thought through is that there was apparently no thought given to updating the Green Hornet's car, Black Beauty, to something that fits the 00's or the 10's.  Instead, they're driving around in this relic that looks like it was found on an auto lot that shut down back in the 60's.  And to add to the absurdity, there's a turntable in it.  Not an Ipod or a CD player or even a tape deck; it's a _turntable_. Playing an LP.  While the car is on the road. Without skipping.

About the only reason I could recommend this film to anyone is if you're a Jay Chou fan and want to hear him sing (in Mandarin) during the ending credits.  Other than that, if you're old enough to actually remember the original Green Hornet from radio or television, avoid this film like the plague; you're not only in for a disappointment, you're in for watching a classic character utterly trashed. If you're completely unfamilliar with the original Green Hornet, then just avoid this film to save yourself from wasting two hours and the cost of a DVD.  And if for some reason someone gives you the DVD, then just use it as a coaster while you watch a decent movie instead.",1295913600,152,6880,4.616078753076292
4435247,1,B004MYH08U,"Seth Rogen shines early, and the premise is promising, but so much of this movie just plain doesn't work.  Every other character seems false and about as 3-dimensional as cardboard.  Diaz and Chou both seem lost or characters from another movie.  Waltz's arch-enemy character is lame and how on earth did the editors decide that 2 hours of this would be a good idea?  You could edit it down to half that easily.  Just a big mess that had me checking my watch incessantly through the last half.",1295740800,12,493,4.556818181818182
4435248,3,B004MYH08U,"I really like Seth Rogan, But it felt like he was doing it by the numbers in the writing of the movie. Basically he takes the plot of the television series where a rich playboy, after finding out his father was killed by a hornet sting. We then find out that he is made the owner of the paper his father ran. He then turns to a crime because of his torrid relationship with his father so that he can use the newspaper to report on it. . He then sees some people in need of help, then turns on the other criminals. Basically he does bad stuff and then blames it on other criminals. I felt that aspect of it was really strange because he is basically committing crimes but getting away with it.

I mean this series isn't nessacry Batman, Superman, or even Spider Man. It's one of those cult figures that goes under the radar and becomes something new for a audience. The show really lasted a short time, but it did bring Bruce Lee to us, but since Lee is gone, Chou took the reins and really shined as Kato. He showed off his talents by making us look at him in Awe as he did most of the stunts of the movie as they were nothing. He has a remarkable talent and I hope he is in future films that can also show what he is all about. The writing was all over the place in the movie, it felt like it had no direction and the dialogue was just plain ok.  Also, the direction by Gondry was some of his best, showcasing his music video skills, and implementing them into the film. It was a fun to watch movie mainly because of the stylistic direction. But the one big problem I had with the film was based on two actors. One underused, and one that was useless. Cameron Diaz, who I dislike, was in this film but yet she had no place, no big moments, and not anything else. I feel she was just here for us to look at her sagging face while Rogen cracked a joke. SHe was just a waste of space.

The villain, Waltz, was not a villan at all. I mean what is it with writers and underwhelming villans? I mean there was one in Knight and Day, Mission Impossible 3, and numerous other movies that have been released in the past 5 years. Waltz is better than this movie, the man has a Oscar to his name yet he is doing movies like this that made me shake my head at the absurdity of it. He's a good actor, but he needs to pick better roles, and quit phoning it in.

Overall, I thought this film was a mess, but it was watchable in some parts enough. I get the feeling people were just seeing it because they got sick of seeing True Grit or numerous other movies that have been out for almost a month. The film is not that good, but I expected it to do well, and I commend the movie studio for their thinking.",1295654400,17,2690,4.069811320754717
4435249,1,B004MYH08U,"My time is precious and I won't hesitate to salvage every minute I can instead of wasting another second on such a fowl film!

The Green Hornet had the feel of a TV sitcom. I could absolutely care less about any of the characters. The dialog was so bad it was incredibly annoying. The story is so poorly written the best actors in the world would not have made any difference! The Green Hornet was dull, unimaginative, tedious; and what a waste of money during a recession! But I'm glad to report that on a Friday night - in a big city like Baltimore - only a handful of people were in the theater! The only way to stop rip-off films from being made is not to pay to see them! I used to be a regular movie goer, but not anymore!

4435250,5,B004MYH08U,"I don't really remember the original Green Hornet stuff, so this review is based strictly on watching this movie in the theater, and--I LOVED IT!  I saw it in 3D, which was nice but not necessary. (3D is older than dirt, but it didn't seem to go over well in the old days.) You may remember Seth Rogen from ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"".

The movie begins at The Daily Sentinel (Daddy's newspaper business).  Young Britt Reid is sent home for fighting in school, but was really trying to defend someone.  Daddy James Reid gets so mad, he rips the head off the boy's favorite toy, a super hero doll.  Britt grows up hating his father, believing that Daddy is way too hard on him.

Fast forward probably something like 20 years or so.  Mr Chudnofsky is the head crime boss in Los Angeles.  He controls all the drug stuff and dares anybody to try to do their own thing.  When something happens to Daddy, the family business is dumped into Britt's hands.  Britt/Seth Rogen is not a go-getter.  As a matter of fact, it's about all he can do to find his coffee in the morning and boink the ladies while living off Daddy's money.  As you might have guessed, Chudnfsky and the Hornet's parallel activities collide.

Britt meets Kato while searching for his coffee and they bond.  Kato was Daddy's mechanic, but also so much more.  Kato can design and build some super neat stuff--like he is an electronic genius!

This flick is extremely entertaining.  It has lots of action, lots of stunts, martial arts, and is pretty darned funny.  There are gunfights, car chases, and lots of really cool gadgets.  Seth Rogen is wonderful as Britt/Hornet, and so is Kato.  Cameron Diaz also plays a newspaper employee.  I was pleasantly surprised at this movie and highly recommend it.",1295481600,7,1759,4.591639871382637

Britt and Kato become friends and decide to cut the head of his dad's memorial statue. During this, they save a couple from a gang. They decide to become masked crimefighters and pose as villians.

4435252,5,B004MYH08U,"I'm sorry but I loved it.  I've already seen it twice in theaters and am seeing it again this weekend.  3-D isn't my favorite invention of all time but that's my only option here.

But I have to say that it is awesome.  I can't stand how lame they've been making some super heroes.  Spider-man is just too...lame.  I always felt those movies were more romance than super heroes and they barely ever kill anyone.  Just trap them for the police.  Green Hornet had more comedic vibes but other than that I would catagorize it more with Kick-ass in a way.  They shot and killed people rather than tie them up with silly string.

I mean I own all three Spider-man movies so don't get me wrong I liked it enough (and it certainly isn't the only one lately, I just don't feel like writing an essay on romantic super heroes) but it certainly isn't for someone looking for good action and car chases.  But two hours of action tends to get dull too.  Green Hornet had a little bit action and comedy.  Plus it's refreshing to not have Seth Rogen be in a movie about smoking pot.  I had yet to see a movie where he hadn't...now I have.  I hope he continues on this path more than the other...just saying.",1295481600,8,1192,4.306306306306307
4435253,3,B004MYH08U,"Myself, if I was the producer of a Green Hornet movie, I probably would have gone for a different flavor than the current Seth Rogan vehicle.  Likely, I would have aimed for an understated, cool 60's vibe (maybe even setting the movie in the 60's), with a cool jazzy score (lots of deep bass notes), snappy dialogue, and spare action (so it would really stand out when it eventually showed up).  But that's me.

I do admit that the flavor/theme that the producers DID go for in the current film- namely, what if an irresponsible, immature buffoon and his only slightly more mature friend are suddenly driven to become superheroes- is also sort of interesting, and that the movie explores that angle entertainingly enough.  But for me, the incessant goofiness got a little old.

On top of that, when the Green Hornet and Kato finally grow up a little and show some adult smarts and maturity, we're suddenly shunted into a huge, overwrought action sequence that takes up the whole last part of the film, preventing the movie from focusing on their new, less grating personas.  Regarding that last action sequence, again, I would have preferred spare, clever action (this isn't the Justice League, after all) rather than seeing the Hornet-mobile riding a service elevator up to the 40th floor of an office building and then tooling around a newspaper's editorial office amid automatic weapons fire from an army of goons.

But again, that's just me, and I'm definitely not saying that the movie is shoddy or dull or poorly crafted.  It just chose an approach- broad humor, broad action- that some people will like more than others.  My wife, in fact, thought it was a refreshing change from the usual melodrama of other superhero movies.  Maybe you will, too.

And, you know what?  Seeing that there are plenty of superhero movies that ARE done as straight-up (or mostly straight-up) dramas, like the current X-Men and Batman movies, I don't mind ALL that much that an occasional light, funny riff on this type of material, as seen in ""The Green Hornet"", comes down the pike now and again.  But let's keep it the exception to the rule, okay?  After all, do we really want to return to the old days of ""Holy spaghetti and meatballs, Batman-- the Pasta King is loose in Gotham!""",1295395200,4,2272,4.748091603053435

And of those people aware that their was once a Green Hornet series of his own, even less than that. There was of course the radio show where it all began. Followed by two serials and a series of comic books. If any of these incarnations of the Green Hornet are what you feel are true to his folklore then you might be disappointed or even angry with how this movie is presented. Knowing this before I went in was extremely helpful for enjoying what the movie had to offer (a fun action packed, somtimes silly adventure) instead of hating it for what it lacked. For how this movie was written, Seth Rogen was perfect to play the main characters. The only thing I had a hard time shaking was it seemed Rogen's character Brit Reid was trying to be more of a Green Hornet wannabe than the actual Green Hornet. So don't expect the suspenseful night time patrols in the Black Beauty as the Green Hornet and Kato pretend to be criminals to infiltrate real crime bosses. Don't worry, there's a Black Beauty in this movie, similar in appearence, with even more gadgets, weapons, and superior technology. But it's not as menacing as the one in the TV show.",1295308800,4,1257,4.469565217391304
4435255,5,B004MYH08U,"I have for long been a big fan of Rottentomatoes dot com, which, if you don't know, rates films based on positive and negative reviews they receive from professional critics; the term professional being a loose term , as often a bloke who has maintained a blog for more than two years can count as a critic. I usually agree with these critics, but often find that they are too soft on some films, and hard on others; The Green Hornet falls in the latter category.

I have a very limited knowledge of comic books, so I came to the Green Hornet as a newcomer. For those who don't know, this is the tale of a ""hero"" who enjoys attacking gangs after he enjoys beating up some thugs at a cemetery. It really is a spoof on the common Superhero motif, and the idea that they are actually saving the world, while in fact they may be creating more mischief and disaster.

The Green Hornet, played by Seth Rogen, is a lazy idiot who enjoys partying, sleeping with girls, and doing all those deeds rich sons of billionaires are known for. After his father's death, he, of all people, gains the reigns of the newspaper. He not only lacks leadership, but admits to having no interest or care for running the family business. Unfortunately, after his father's death, he needs his coffee, but he has fired the guy who made coffee every morning. He rehires him to find that this Chinese man's talents exceed this limited field. He is also a brilliant mechanic that can build cars that are tolerant to damage caused by a golf club, and even a bullet. He is the definition of expertise in developing these cars.
Side Kick better than the super hero:

One of the most interesting ideas about the Green Hornet is that the Superhero is simply the mastermind of the plans, which usually take a unfortunate turn. The actual hero is the sidekick, played by Jay Chou, who, reminiscent of Bruce Lee in the original TV series, beats up most of their targets by himself. The Green Hornet in this film is a fool, someone who came up with an idea, and arrogantly attempts to take on the most dangerous criminals and drug dealers. Some may claim that Seth Rogen was the wrong person for this role, but the awkward chemistry works great between Chou and Rogen. Rogen plays an absolute fool, while Chou's Kato sticks to the Hornet sometimes not understanding that he is the pivot of this partnership, and could perform equally well without the Hornet.

One of the main issues people may bring up with this film is its strange, underdeveloped, and often juvenile dialogue. I noticed this quite often, considering that Britt Reid, AKA The Green Hornet, overdoses on ""awesome,"" ""badass,"" and any other words that excite him. Rogen's dialogue is composed of sound bites, like an excited fourteen year old high on hallucinogens. The dialogue works however, as this partnership between Britt and Kato is such an anomaly this awkward dialogue fits the tone of the work quite well.  Kato, on the other hand, is also the stereotypical Asian character using a very predictable English accent that screams FOREIGNER; his accent is most similar to Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa in Family Guy. Though no one expects Chou to employ a perfect English accent, I believe that the director or Producers encouraged Chou to speak in such to make him at times the butt of jokes; this is especially clear when he uses words like ""p####"" that is not necessarily funny, but with broken English appears funnier than it should.

This film is visual eye candy, with shamelessly excessive and loud explosions. The sheer wreckage caused is both astonishing and laughable with the main offices of a top newspaper basically demolished. Their vehicle, the Black Beauty, is behind the singular action sequences. Causing so much havoc, it holds unbearably well  against the attacks of Chudnofsky, the villain, and his henchman. The Black Beauty could also count as the main ingredient of The Green Hornet's appeal enhanced by missiles and countless weapons that deals with a large majority of the villains.
As noted, this film has been criticized, by critics like Ebert, for lacking charm, for being just visually spectacular, and also lacking character development. Even though these charges, on a general level, are all valid, it is necessary to see how this film compares to similar visually spectacular phenomenons. A film like Transformers is just a visual experience with nothing to offer besides sound and explosion. This film is more than that, and though it does not achieve its full potential, it achieves the goal of being entertaining, even though it may leave many fans of the original series quite disappointed.

Verdict:

This film would be recommended to viewers who enjoy films like Superbad because Rogen and Goldberg, his comedy partner, are the writers of this screenplay. As such, this is no large social critique about Superheroes, but a film filled with juvenile humor that hits the mark. It may contain mundane and stale dialogue, but considering the awkward chemistry between Chou and Rogen, this is more welcome than poetic and biting dialogue offered in a film like True Grit.",1295222400,8,5137,4.815192743764173
4435256,4,B004MYH08U,"First of all, The Green Hornet was never Batman or Captain America. Even with Kato as his sidekick, The Hornet is rarely mentioned in the same breath as Superman, Spiderman, Wolverine or Iron Man. When you associate green with a superhero, it's usually Green Lantern, Green Arrow or The Hulk so Seth Rogen and company decided to approach this project differently and bring The Hornet back as a rich slacker who fights crime for fun. Kato (Jay Chou from Initial D) is no longer a butler/chauffeur. Now he's a killing machine/genius who can defeat anyone and create anything. Today's Green Hornet is a klutz who finds his way with the help of his new best pal and his gorgeous secretary, Lenore Case (Cameron Diaz) who unknowingly is the brains behind the partnership. Once the boys start cleaning up Los Angeles streets while posing as criminals, Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz) wants them eliminated because he's involved in all of LA's dirt. That's pretty much it, give or take a subplot or two and that suits me just fine. This is no Dark Knight. It's silly Saturday night nonsense. I don't know what the people who are shooting this movie down expected. At times, the mix of violence and silliness reminded me of Kick-Ass which I enjoyed immensely. Just have fun and relax. It's a Seth Rogen flick for goodness sake.",1295222400,5,1316,4.776315789473684
4435257,5,B004MYH08U,"I saw The Green Hornet yesterday in 3D and I thought it was awesome.
Seth Rogen Co-Writer/Main Actor did a fantastic job the movie was very very funny and with some great action something we are not used to see Seth Rogen in. He was very good at mixing comdey with action. Jay Chou who played kato did amazing aswell great martial arts and comedy aswell and for people wondering *Minor Spoiler* They do show a drawing of the original Kato (Bruce Lee) in a drawing Kato/Jay Chou made in the film. I don't want to go more into the movie without spoiling it with the rest of the cast but overall I loved the movie. I signed up to be emailed when this is able to preorder and I will be buying this Day One! Great Film and Nice way to start off this Comic Book Year for films.",1295222400,4,771,4.1466666666666665
4435258,5,B004MYH08U,"Just came back from seeing the non-3D version of the movie at Cinemark.  I really don't understand the negative comments about Seth Rogen.  I thoroughly enjoyed the new Green Hornet.  IMO.. it captured the favor of the old series, but with a lot more humor.  Remember in the 1960 series, the Kato action scenes and the BLACK BEAUTY always stole the show.  Hardly anyone remembers the person who portrayed the actual Green Hornet character.  I think his name had ""Van"" in it somewhere.  Again, the real stars of the updated version are the action scenes and the BLACK BEAUTY.  They really had some well placed stunts -- incredible!  Although I must say, this time, the actual Green Hornet character was not the hard-boiled thinker of old, but an immature risk taker, which now makes him much more memorable.  If Mr. Rogen really wrote this script, I applaud him.  As a side note, I would love to see a dark production of the Green Hornet (in the style of Batman Begins) brought to the screen!",1295136000,7,991,4.637931034482759
4435259,3,B004MYH08U,"The Green Hornet is far from great, or even very good for that matter, but it has a few charms that I couldn't deny no matter how hard I tried. Seth Rogen is a weird choice for the lead role in any kind of action movie. He is basically just playing a slight variation of all the other lazy losers of his past films. He does get his moments to shine in the realm of comedy, but he is mostly overshadowed by the sidekick role, Kato, played by Jay Chou. He is by far the more interesting character, though he and Rogen do have a few moments of humorous interactions. Cameron Diaz seems to be here to just add a bigger name to the cast and even Christoph Waltz, so good in Inglourious Basterds, doesn't hit the right notes as the villain. It's kind of funny that my favorite scene happens within minutes after the start. I'll just say it involves an extended cameo from James Franco, who I had no idea was even going to be in the movie.

I did appreciate the mixture of comedic relief to go along with the action, but I think the violence could have been toned down some. It seemed out of place. I mean, these ""heroes"" have a higher body count than the bad guys. I guess the Batman way of catching rather than killing the bad guys is just too much work when you can just spray them with bullets or stab wood stakes into their eyes. Yes, that does happen here.

I must say that the large crowd I saw it with may have swayed my enjoyment to the more positive side. They laughed at almost everything. As I left the theater, most people seemed to be of the opinion that it wasn't outstanding, but that it was much better than they thought it would be going in. Those were my thoughts as well. Worthy of a future rental.",1295049600,5,1711,4.197568389057751
4435260,3,B004MYH08U,"Before anyone accuses me of being a Diaz hater, know that in the past I considered myself a fan & for the most part I still do. It's just that she's never looked more haggard than she has in this film & her performance has never seemed more phoned in than it was here.

I didn't really expect a whole lot from this movie. I mean come on- it's a SETH ROGEN flick. I don't think any of us went in expecting&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iron-Man/dp/B001C08RHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iron Man</a>&nbsp;but we were expecting something better than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Robin/dp/B001OST0M6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman & Robin</a>. Don't worry- it's better than B&R for the most part. Since my dad is an IMAX & 3D fanboy, we shelled out the money for the souped up IMAX 3D tickets.

Word to the wise: Do not pay to see this in IMAX or 3D, let alone together. The 3D in this film is practically non-existent, although the IMAX did make everything a little sharper. I know this won't be an issue for many people since this isn't typically a film you'd go see in 3D, but if you have someone like my father who tries to watch everything in IMAX 3D, you'll want to discourage them. This is not worth the price of admission.

Anyway, the plot for this is pretty decent. It couldn't quite decide if it wanted to be a comedy or an action film, but that was fine for the most part. Rogen stumbles through his role with incredibly good cheer & despite him being a ne'er do well, you can't help but cheer him on. Chou is by far one of the best parts of the film, second to the character of Bloodnofsky. He's the one doing all the dirty work & I honestly found myself being more interested in what HE was doing than Rogen, but the two of them had an easy enough patter to where it worked out in the long run. And the bad guy? AWESOME. I really wish that he could've been in the film a little more- this guy was highly entertaining to watch, as were his bad guys.

That brings us to the albatross around the movie's neck: Cameron Diaz. Now I love her movies & as far as girls in general go I do think she's attractive, but she looks incredibly haggard & old in this film. There's absolutely no chemistry between her & any of the other actors & to be honest... she sticks out like a sore thumb in this film. Her interactions feel like an afterthought, like someone wrote the script & said ""oh, we have this other character- we should put her in"". Diaz really phones it in for this film & that's a disappointment because I know she can do better. Like another reviewer put it, the role really should have gone to a different (younger) actress. They could've hired an unknown for a fraction of the cost of Diaz & it'd have been money well spent. It's the scenes with Diaz where you REALLY begin to feel how long the movie really is. Mercifully her scenes in the movie are relatively short, as if even the director began to realize how horribly miscast she'd been. She's not Tara Reid ""Alone in the Dark"" bad, but the fact that I was comparing the two of them during the film wasn't really a good thing. I know I'm probably being overkill at this point, but words can't explain how disappointed I was with Diaz's performance. You could have taken her out & put any other actress in the role- she brought nothing to the film & if not for her previous name value, you wouldn't have even known who she was. Diaz is bland & colorless in this film, which again is a shame. I know she can do better.

Overall though this is a fun little flick & I'll admit that I'll probably watch it a few more times. I know it's not up to Iron Man standards, but it's just a fun & harmless movie. I initially hesitated at giving it 3 stars, but went ahead with it anyway. Minus Diaz, the film really is enjoyable. It's not something that you'd consider ""good"" like you'd consider Iron Man or Toy Story ""good"", but it's still fun to watch & will be one of those guilty pleasure watches. It'll probably be overlooked by many, but it's worth watching.",1295049600,2,4119,4.53835800807537
