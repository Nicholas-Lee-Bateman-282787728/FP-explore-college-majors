Anyone who believes said Garbage has no capacity for critical thinking and will probably believe any thing T.V. tells them as long as it includes some variation on ""just as the bible says."" A quick search of ""Dr."" Carl Baugh will reveal that his credentials are all completely bogus; he was awarded a doctorate from the unaccredited school of which he is the president. And his discoveries have a habit of changing locations.  Give me a break. Even creationists have denounced this fraud. I know this review may not change the minds of those hell-bent on accepting creationism or it's twin in the cheap rented tux, intelligent design. But if it can persuade one person to do their own research and think openly and critically, then it's worth it. Ask Questions.",1238371200,,841,4.922535211267606
7910865,3,B00000IML9,i thoroughly enjoyed vol. 1 most of vol. 2 and wish they left out vol. 3 untill they had more conclusive evidence.  i applaud NBC for showing vol. 1. i don't normally applaud NBC but in this case i have to. to their  credit they aired an anti-establishment show that stands toe to toe with  conventional evolutionary theory and serves it a 10 count knock out.  fascinating evidence of humans being alive millions of years ago even  walking with dinosaurs. evidence of mans handy work dating back anywhere  from 250k years to 2 billions. heavens forbid could the bible be right  after all.  it also depicts what happens when you buck the establishment.  guarenteed to raise your blood pressure and make you want to throttle your  local professor of archeology.  summary- worth seeing and having they  should have discarded vol. 3 until more research was done to confirm or  disprove the evidence. jb,937699200,26,898,4.790849673202614
