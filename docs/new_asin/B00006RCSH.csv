8324428,5,B00006RCSH,"Maybe I'm a bit baised, since I worked as a storyboard revisionist/BG & model sheet cleanup artist on this series (*.*).

But it deserves a review, and I'll provide one.

Great design & animation worth checking out.  Also a number of great gags.
If you're an animator or fan, you might be interested to know that this is a rare animated TV series made (animation overseas) in the SF Bay Area (most are made in LA).

Enjoy.  It was a blast to work on.",1235692800,2,450,4.309523809523809
