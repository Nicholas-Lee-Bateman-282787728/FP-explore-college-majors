5103403,3,B007PKSN0C,"I thought some of his documentary was interesting and he certainly is an entertaining lecturer, although I cannot agree with all of his opinions. I preferred the first episode about history of various civilizations over the second episode's discussion on 20th century and contemporary society. In the second episode his biases are quite evident.

The more I think about it, the less I like the 2nd part. He gives lip-service to the environmental problems, over-simplifies issues and skews too much in favor of his positions.

Overall it was much too light on the matter of slavery, indentured servitude, child labor, cheap labor, worker's safety and the exploitation/abuse thereof for monetary gain. He seems to want to pretend that is all in the past and doesn't need to be revisited, even though it continues today. And to say that people don't have a work ethic anymore is just plain insulting.

And he might have brought the Puritan influence into his discussion (in favor of) the Christian/protestant work ethic. Rampant consumerism is not a true Christian value (even if it has been co-opted as such) and is depleting the earth's resources.  I think it is a stretch to declare blue jeans the reason that eastern block communism imploded. Did he discuss the Scandinavian socialist model?....no.

I would prefer less opinion, more equitable analysis and discussion.",1337731200,12,1369,5.121076233183857
5103404,4,B007PKSN0C,"While Ferguson seems to be carving out a niche for himself as vitriolically pro-West (and trends anti Muslim, though has a soft spot for China and Japan), his accounts of 19th and 20th century history are at least thesis driven. So many history programs simply catalog events, which can be informative, but are more the purview of museum collections than historians.
  Recent PBS and BBC documentaries allow scholars to air provocative theses, which can only serve to make history more interesting to lay-people. While I do not agree with Ferguson's pro-West account, at least there is something to disagree with. Set within the recent spate of documentaries addressing the last 200 years of interaction between the west and the rest, Ferguson's ideas are a much more palatable response to Jared Diamond than Victor Hanson's fairly one-dimensional military accounting.
  Further, as far as the production values of historical documentaries go, I far prefer the pacing and artistry of the BBC to the likes of Ken Burns. Its true that the jumpy nature of the establishment shots in Civilization are unnecessarily flashy, but I prefer those to a two-minute slow zoom-in on one photograph. Although I know that criticizing Burns is, for some, akin to criticizing the flag, I find myself unable to stay awake through the folksy narrative that present many facts, but few opinions. And while PBS is head and shoulders above the History Channel and even Nat. Geo. for content, the BBC sets the standard.
  Ferguson is a high intelligent, and charismatic commentator on the last two centuries of world history. Like Kipling's 'White Man's Burden,' however, it is an intelligence tinged with an intolerance, and a belief that 'winning' makes a society right.

5103408,1,B007PKSN0C,"I like documentaries based more on fact than opinion.

As I probably should have guessed from the title, this documentary certainly did not meet these requirements. It was more of a neoconservative propaganda piece than an objective look at history.

I had a few basic problems:

1. Niall Ferguson consistently asserts that the West has ""dominated"" the ""rest"" for 500 years. But he doesn't really define what he means by that, instead cherrypicking a hodgepodge of examples, of everything from clothing to Christianity.
2. He attributes the rise of the West to 6 killer apps, including things such as ""Competition"" and ""Hard work"" yet again, he does a poor job of defining how he is using these terms.
3. He provides very little evidence to quantify why the West had more of these attributes than ""the rest."" The closest he comes in the episode on competition is saying Europe is broken up into multiple nation states, but he doesn't explain why competition between nation states would necessarily trump competition within a nation state.
4. He is unabashedly Eurocentric. It would likely be true that the West has had greater financial and military output than the rest. Ferguson treats this as if it it were an indisputably good thing. But with current rates of wealth inequality, global environmental degredation, and widespread war crimes committed by many western trans-national corporations, it was very difficult for me as a viewer to get into Ferguson's spirit that this is an ""unequivocally"" good thing. Also, I cringed at the constant lumping of a diversity of other cultures and ways of being into ""the rest.""

I expect a more fact based examination of the historical contingencies that gave rise to certain countries and spelled the downfall of others. Ferguson instead sells an ideology. As with any ideology that tries to reduce a complex phenomenon to six points, this series is reductionist and overly simplistic.",1403049600,9,1929,5.056603773584905

5103411,5,B007PKSN0C,"In looking at powerful trends in history, one seeks the sources.  Here, Prof. Ferguson looks to several distinguishing factors in Western Civilization as the sources of historical trends.  Starting with the traits of competition, science, and property, we see the beginnings of the modern world.

However, modern science is not purely abstract, but rather a cultural achievement that developed alongside technology and means of observation, such as the telescope, microscope, chemical tests, and innumerable other physical devices used for observation.  Since Prof. Ferguson accounts for scientific knowledge as a source for ocean navigation, the industrial revolution, modern medicine, accurate weapons, and other history-changing events, one has to look further at how and why modern science developed in Europe and not other continents.  For that topic I note that there is a closely related book:  ""A Culture of Improvement:  Technology and the Western Millenium"" by Robert Friedel (MIT Press).  The publisher's introduction for Friedel's book shows that he also seeks to explain why there ""winners and losers in history"":

""Why does technology change over time, how does it change, and what difference does it make? In this sweeping, ambitious look at a thousand years of Western experience, Robert Friedel argues that technological change comes largely through the pursuit of improvement--the deep-rooted belief that things could be done in a better way. What Friedel calls the ""culture of improvement"" is manifested every day in the ways people carry out their tasks in life--from tilling fields and raising children to waging war. Improvements can be ephemeral or lasting, and one person's improvement may not always be viewed as such by others. Friedel stresses the social processes by which we define what improvements are and decide which improvements will last and which will not. These processes, he emphasizes, have created both winners and losers in history.""

Interestingly, the ""pursuit of improvement"" may be closely connected with two of the ""Killer Apps,"" namely competition and the work ethic, since pursuing improvement is by its nature competitive and one which requires patience and a good work ethic.  In another sense, the geographic competition between small European states that Prof. Ferguson discusses means each had narrow and limited resources that needed to be developed, hence competition for resources.  Today, now looking at the East Asian context, it is often said that Japan, Taiwan, and similar countries were compelled to develop technology because of the lack of abundant natural resources, extensive farmland, oil, etc.  So the historical cycle of Killer Apps that ultimately lead to modern society may be repeating itself in East Asia, in this way and many other ways.",1389225600,,2811,5.464203233256351

5103416,4,B007PKSN0C,"Let me start out by saying that I have read Professor Ferguson's book ""The War of the World"" and found it to be albeit heavy an interesting read.

Professor Ferguson proposes in this documentary, that what caused the Western cultures to surpass the Eastern ones, were six so called ""Killer Apps"" 1. Competition 2. Science 3. Property 4. Modern Medicine 5. Consumerism 6. Work Ethic.

If you've seen documentaries that link things together, across the span of history and how one lead to the rise of the other or built upon the other i.e. ""James Burke's Connections series"" than  you have seen in gist what Professor Ferguson is attempting to do here.

All in all it was an interesting documentary, I watched it over the course of 6 days watching one episode an evening and discussing it over the course of the next day with a friend who was also watching it.

There will of course be points the he makes that you will disagree with but that is true of most material when it comes to lecturers. If you're interested in programs like ""Connections"" then I highly recommend this program as well as Professor Ferguson's books.

If I had to offer one complaint though, I would say that perhaps the price is a tad high. I got this when it was on sale at around $15 I believe and for that I think it was well worthwhile but when you get up above $20 I definitely say hold off on this or get the book then get the program later when it comes down in price. Granted that is more to do with the PBS/BBC releases then anything but still a good program just a tad pricey.",1369958400,3,1558,4.392361111111111

The first 3 episodes are pretty good though, with good locales and great cinematography.  It goes downhill from there, the one of consumerism emphasizing jeans as the epitome of western civilization gets pretty tiresome, and the last episode on the values of good ol' fashion Protestant work ethic is pedantic and hard to watch.  Here is Ferguson, a self-avowed atheist, suddenly becoming a born again Christian, if only for the means to save Western Civilization from the onslaught of Islam and European secularism.

5103422,1,B007PKSN0C,Ferguson again demonstrates his propensity to take a quote/fact/ancedote followed by two or three paragraphs claiming to present evidence and this he passes for research.  I suspect he cobbled this book together over a month based on reports from his team of researchers.  There is nothing new or original here David Landes Poverty and Wealth of Nations has already been there  and he does it better because Landes is an historian where Ferguson does not merit that title.,1351728000,4,472,5.0256410256410255
5103423,5,B007PKSN0C,"Knowing that Ferguson is one of the highest profile thinkers who openly rejects the prevailing Marxist narratives made me curious when I saw him publish the book which accompanies this DVD recently. Would he follow Huntington? Spengler? Toynbee? Weber? McNeil? How would someone in our generation who rejects the prevailing academic orthodoxy look at the world?

Since I didn't have time to add this book to my long list, I was pleasantly surprised to find it in DVD-- something enjoyable to watch while relaxing.  It really turned out to be an educational pleasure.  The basic concept is that Ferguson identifies 6 aspects of the West that other competing societies lacked.  Then in each episode, he picks up one of those 6 aspects and compares the West to another example Civilization.

As should be expected from a documentary series, it does not dive in depth, explore counter theories, etc.  He is simply making a case for his summary of the differences. A bit of a Weberian myself, I would have made the case that that his first 5 ""killer apps"" are the result primarily of cultural forces at work for many centuries (following Stark), but then you wouldn't expect this kind of religious argument from an atheist.  What you also don't expect from an atheist, however is that he DOES argue Weber's protestant work ethic in section 6 as a primary driver of Western dominance. I think his application to China overlooks the Confucian roots of their work ethic, but nonetheless, the story arc works. Protestantism made us work, those who are rejecting it, are stopping working, and those who are embracing it are working like we used to.

Contrary to what others may have insinuated, this series displays both a broad awareness of competing theories and literature (which he references, but often you would only know if you were in the literature yourself) as well as some scholarship of his own.  To be honest, a series like this one could not be considered good if there were not some leftists on here screaming and giving it one star reviews for no particular reason other than that it challenges their state-sanctioned orthodoxy.  Exploitation is simply not an explanation for dominance at all.  Exploitation has been the rule of the day for thousands of years, but does nothing to explain how the West outpaced everyone else.",1349568000,7,2331,4.8908629441624365
5103424,1,B007PKSN0C,"This program started out well enough, but despite Ferguson's standing on the staff of a couple Ivy Leagues, you cannot believe everything he's saying.  At one point in the program, he's discussing the World's Fair and clearly referred to Thomas Edison as the ""wizard of AC"".  Ferguson did not say ""wizard of Menlo Street"", in case you think I misheard.  (I know it's ""wizard of Menlo Park"" but ""Street"" just rhymed with ""AC"", which is what I heard. Anyway, it was Edison's researchers doing that footwork, not Edison himself...he just claimed the glory.)

During this period and for most of his life, Edison was a staunch supporter of DC power, not AC.  Tesla was in fact the man responsible for the AC grid, among many other mechanisms associated with it that people wrongly attribute to Edison.  As an ""esteemed"" historian, Ferguson should know this, since it is fact.  Instead, he perpetuates the lie the Edison is responsible for AC.

As this simple, established fact is so easily checked, I then also have to question EVERYTHING Ferguson states in this program, aimed at the teen segment of our population.  What is actual, documented fact?  What is simply veiled opinion?  And what portions of it are just plain falsehoods attempting to slowly change our views by chipping away at the facts, replacing them with crap?

Something most wrong with the world today is too many ""experts"" operating on partially or completely concocted data, or erroneous ""facts"".  Then there's folks like this who apparently inject their bised opinion into it as fact, nevermind the truth.  I'd like to see a debate between this historian (who can't be bothered to look up a simple fact) and say, someone like Pankaj Ghemawat, who is a fellow professor of Ferguson's at Harvard.

Now I'd find the need to confirm for myself, EVERYTHING Ferguson states, and not take a word of it for ""fact"" before then.  How much of what he says is Revisionist history? How much is fact?  I don't have time to argue with a so-called historian over so-called fact, but at least can recognize BS.  What about the younger ones who don't know any better and are too baffled to look into things for themselves?  Just more of what's seriously wrong with the world, thanks to folks like Ferguson.

P.S. - This is not his only error, by any means.  It's just one that anybody with half a brain can verify for themselves without bias.  Throughout the film, he tells the part of the story that benefits his (at times, just plain wrong) view, ignoring fact, then states as fact his own conclusion and opinion.  Revisionism at its very best.

5103428,2,B007PKSN0C,"I found the first half of this documentary to be far more interesting and believable than the second half. In general, I like the style of Niall Ferguson's documentaries - I find it to be a format that can engage the audience. However, I tend to find some of his political and economic views to be questionable. In this documentary, Ferguson lists ""six killer applications"" which he states are responsible for the rise of western dominance and spread of western culture.

The six killer apps are
1. Competition
2. Science
3. Democracy
4. Medicine
5. Consumerism
6. Work Ethic

I think a good case can be made for the first 3 apps, the last 3 are kind of iffy (at least the way he presents it in the film). Towards the last part, where the documentary talks about consumerism and work ethic, he starts to veer into strange tangents - the documentary becomes more and more of a stretch. I started to wonder what sort of political/religious/economic agenda he had because the end of the documentary really was not very clear and seemed far more to be composed of biased opinion than the beginning.

While I think it's okay to watch, I would take his viewpoints with a grain of salt. In general, I find him to be rather elitist in his political and economic views and not above manipulating the facts to concur with those views.

Also, he starts to sound like a western imperialist when giving the conclusion.",1339977600,11,1405,4.608

Of course, trying to make a broad sweep of history in six 45-minute videos will leave out points some will find critical, and make some generalizations others will find offensive, but the genius of Ferguson's grasp of history and twenty-first century social media is evident across the six segments. Yes, there are connections back to James Burke's wonderful ""Connections"" series from thirty years ago, and fellow Harvard economic historian David Landes went into much more detail in his ""Wealth and poverty of nations"" treatise fifteen years ago, but for the student or just intellectually curious, this series is hard to beat. Yes, the ""six killer apps"" theme may offend some as a bit too cute, too current, too much of an appeal to the MTV generation, but Ferguson knows his stuff and knows his audience.

Having taught an honors section of Western Civilization thirty years ago, I would have found this series invaluable for laying out the basic premise of the development of modern western civilization. It is not a replacement for serious reading or coursework, but it is an engaging introduction and thesis to frame the key issues facing the west and ""the rest"" today.",1339027200,24,1346,5.063063063063063

Make no mistake, you may find yourself not agreeing with Ferguson. I suggest you read his book (of the same name) for an even more comprehensive understanding of his views. However, not agreeing with someone's take on any given issue should not be grounds for condemnation or disregard. I, personally, find little to disagree with as far as his views on the rise of the West. In very simple terms, this is my take on Civilization: West & The Rest-- Ferguson presents a non-apologist's account on the rise of Western economic, political and cultural hegemony. He lays out a realist groundwork for why the West succeeded and why the 'Rest' failed. That said, by no means does Ferguson disregard the negative aspects of Western civilization (colonialism, slavery, genocide, rampant consumerism etc.) However, unlike the leftist literature/media that plagues academic discourse like a widespread disease, Ferguson gives ample credence as to WHY the 'Rest' failed. He does not wallow in self-loathing and pitiful guilt for the West's meteoric rise into economic, political and cultural splendor. On the contrary, he cites specific reasons as to why China, the Ottoman Empire and others failed to capitalize on opportunities to advance. Likewise, he provides us six ""Killer Applications"" the West implemented to bring themselves out of the dark ages and into the modern world. Niall Ferguson is as sharp as they come. The documentary itself is beautiful to watch and listen to. The photography is second to none and Ferguson's commentary is accessible, funny and captivating. He holds no punches when criticizing Keynesian economics, state-run monopolies, dictators and the failures of Socialism. Is he a crazy right-wing historian? Not by a long shot. Is he a left-leaning apologist who resents Western civilization? Absolutely not. Ferguson is a one-of-a-kind intellectual with a robust and honest dedication to his craft.

I found it to be his forthright assessment of how the West dominated the world during the last 500 years. His main question is whether we are going through a period of decline and fall.

A four hour program cannot be written about in a concise manner. He speaks about the West's domination of China, Africa, and... He postulates that China may well be the dominant power in the not to long.

He credits Weber's use of the term the ""Protestant work ethic"" which promoted capitalism and ergo, Western dominance. But, he rightly notes that religion is being
dissipated in Europe -- to be replaced by the seeking of pleasure.

And, it seems that only the U. S. has become more rather than less religious than the European nations. But, generally the West (in totality) has taken to materialism greed and an unrestained quest for pleasure as well. As China has usurped the work ethic and is embrasing Christianity.

It's four hours -- but, quite intriguing. I believe in many of Mr. Ferguson's narrative and conclusions. Will the West survive? Both he and I don't know.

8520504,5,B007PKSN0C,This film is both 1st rate and a little disturbing to observe. In that Author present a good concise story about the rise of the West.

8520505,5,B007PKSN0C,"Ferguson argues that ideas (intangible and abstract) are more important to human life and society, in contrast to resources (tangible and visible). He uses this premise to explain the ''rise'' of the West over the past five hundred years. Then questions the ability of the West's continued ''progress'' if these ideas are no longer present. Covers six ''applications'' -

Competition
Science
Property
Medicine
Consumerism
Work

Competition here is both political  and commercial. Contrasts the violent, combative, outward focus of Europe in 1500, with the Chinese monolithic, inward focus at the same time. Details the voyages of Zheng He (1430-1433) around Africa to Europe, and the marvelous ships, navy and technological superiority of Chinese. Chinese ''civilization'' clearly superior. What happened? Emperor Yongle died. Successor decreed no more voyages, no more more ships on pain of death. Turned inward. Different ideas creates different effects.

Why was Vasco da Gama so clearly hungry for money hungry enough to kill for it? There were roughly a thousand polities in fourteenth-century Europe; and still around 500 more or less independent units 200 years later. This political competition prepared Europe for worldwide competition.

This idea that civilization is in ''competition'' runs throughout the video. The ''rise'' and ''fall'', the ''winners'' and ''losers'', makes for drama and interesting narrative, but I found it hard to to completely swallow. Nevertheless, Ferguson presents both the good and bad of the West.  He seems to feel that the good outweighs the bad. The fact, that cannot be disputed, is that the ''rest'' are generally imitating the ''west''. Therefore western ''civilization'' is accepted as more desirable, although maybe not really ''superior''.

I enjoyed Ferguson's coverage of the good and the bad. For example, Locke inserted private property rights in the Carolina charter. Excellent results. Also included human slavery. Horrible result. Science reduced many African diseases - Great. Science justified eugenics and racial extermination by the Germans in Africa - Terrible.

Consumerism provides physical benefits the world has never seen - Marvelous. Consumerism can replace moral and spiritual benefits like nothing the world has ever seen - Astonishing.

This use of contrast adds interest and depth. In fact, even though Ferguson explains he was raised atheist, the respectful way he refers to historical Christianity is intriguing. Explains Max Weber's idea of the Protestant work ethic. Ferguson believes it. Presents the increase of Christianity in China as aiding the increase of business. Indicates Freud's psychoanalysis, replacing sin with sickness, may not be an improvement.

This presentation is interesting. I don't think Ferguson fully persuades the viewer in all cases; nevertheless, he provides much information and makes a clear argument. Well worth watching. This is the third time we have reviewed this analysis. Always gives me ideas to ponder.",1463270400,3,3016,5.608791208791208

Deep and detailed, structured and captivating, this show will satisfy your intellectual curiosity.  Professor Ferguson puts economy, politics and science in the context of hundreds of years of history and societal development, presenting a rare-to-find, big-picture level understanding of the human experience.  The case contains two DVDs with over 282 minutes of total run-time.  I highly recommend it for all.",1462752000,,549,5.825

Maybe it's for people who don't read much.  Why just these six vaguely specified Apps?  (Competition, Science, Property, Medicine, Consumerism, Work)  In fact, they seem to vary in the telling.  Isn't Medicine a special case of Science/Technology?  Could Property and Consumerism together just be Capitalism?  Sometimes Democracy shows up, and, at the end, there is a nod to Confidence.  Prof. Ferguson may have been rewatching Sir Kenneth Clark before filming the last episode:  Clark makes much of Confidence.  What about, say, the Sense of the Unity of Christendom?  The Limited Liability Corporation, Usury and Other Inventive Financial Instruments?  Not catchy enough, probably.  In short, some forcing and hand waving is needed to squeeze five centuries of European success into this little schema.  It wouldn't be wise for viewers to go around announcing that they have now learned the Six (or was it five or eight?) Rules of Cultural Hegemony.

The narrator doesn't stick very closely to his West and Rest story.  Some of his contrasts involve North and South, or what have you.  And, by the way, isn't Christianity a Middle Eastern religion, originally?  The Battle of Vienna was between a bunch of northerly and southerly peoples, all of whose minds had been colonized by Semitic monotheism.  Again, the failures of Spanish South America get contrasted to the successes of British (and French) North America, but this part isn't about a Western entity versus any Rest.  What counts as characteristically Western seems to jump around depending on the needs of the narrative.  Protestant Work Ethic explanations are controversial among historians, nor does Protestant theology really have much to do with the rise of prosperity in Japan or China.

One gets a sense from time to time that Ferguson thinks the weakening of European-North American dominance is a troubling thing.  But Europe and North America are not necessarily worse off when the Chinese, Japanese, Indians, Koreans etc. become wealthier.  It helps us too in some ways.  Competition can be healthy, but maybe world domination at the expense of others shouldn't be our aim.

In sum, there is a lot that is ad hoc and oversimplified, though in fairness you can't blame the narrator too much given the difficulties of boiling Civilization itself down into a journalistic TV series.  On the positive side, he is refreshingly candid about the advantages and disadvantages of imperialist practices.

There are informative facts and some food for thought, so I don't regret watching it, though I can't see myself going back to it in the future.

I will likely go back more than once to Sir Kenneth Clark's series.  Ferguson mocks Clarks de haut en bas manner and deliberately sets up his program as a successor to Civilisation, but the Clark series gets its more enduring interest from the wonderful art it shows, illuminated by Sir Kenneth's wide cultural knowledge and his highly perceptive taste.",1441584000,3,3011,5.148453608247423
