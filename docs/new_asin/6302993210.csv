528007,5,6302993210,"Read the other reviews! I have only seen the VHS version. Quite long, but a very nice story! Emmanuelle Beart is the best reason to watch this movie! She is gorgeous and naked through most of the film! An old man who is a renound artist who has not painted for 10 years, because he has ""lost vision"" is inspired by a new model ( Emmanuelle Beart ) to try again to paint his ""masterpiece"", an idea he was working on many years ago!

He puts Emmanuelle through Hell, modelling for him. Many times he is tempted to give up!  He finally paints the perfect: ""La Belle Noiseuse""! It is both BEAUTIFUL and EVIL! ( You never see the damn painting!!! Ha ha! ) It casts a bad light on the model! There is an underlying story within this story. What does the artist do with his masterpiece? Will people think the artist is a failure? Does he show his painting to the world? One of the very very best French Films I have ever seen!!! I thought at the end that the film deserved to win an award and it did!!! It WON a TOP French film award!!! An excellent movie!!!",1108252800,7,1051,4.198019801980198
528008,4,6302993210,"It is said that just before death the sum total of a person's existence passes before the eyes in a fraction of a second. The essence! Truth without pretense. For the artist, ""La Belle Noiseuse"" is that essence captured on canvas. Edouard Frenhofer is a master painter who has spent the past 10 years languishing in contented happiness. Languishing because an artist actively pursing the truth in art is never contented. Blood needs to be shed and suffering must be endured for truth can be cruel. ""La Belle Noiseuse"" was Frenhofer's unfinished masterpiece; an attempt that was abandoned. To paint the truth it is not enough to  merely copy what is seen by the eyes. One must go all the way, to penetrate, to . . . invent! This film painstakingly details the relationship between the artist and the model. The attempt by the artist to venture into the soul, and to return not only with the essence of the subject, but the essence of the artist as well. The script is loosely based on the short story ""The Unknown Masterpiece"" by  Honore de Balzac. This tale was also highly influential on the painter Picasso.",1106784000,6,1109,4.682051282051282
528009,5,6302993210,"I try to watch this movie once a year.  It is a gorgeous, slow moving thing.  The better part of the movie is taken up with the battle between Frehofer and the form he is trying to bring to life on the canvas, with Emmanuelle Beart as his model.  He gives up... she gives up... but they plow on through.  The story is unsullied by any erotic (or at least, overtly erotic) connection between the two.  But there is none of the neurotic histrionics and unrequited sacrifices of the usual films about artist: there is just the hard, greuling, work of having a vision and getting it right.

This is freely based on the story ""The Unknown Masterpiece"" by Balzac.  If only more movies ""freely based"" on a story could be as fine as this one.  Knowing the story, which is a short novella, may actually add to the appreciation of the film and the character of Frenhofer.",1103414400,4,861,4.405063291139241
528010,5,6302993210,"Emmanuelle Bart,  is used to being the object of desire, one of the most beautiful women, especially in motion.

Yes it is slow, deliberate, and calculated but it is far from predictable or boring.  People who have never experienced the multiple levels of creating art in some form will be treated to the simulated experience of the characters in this film.  It isn't exciting in the sense of action but rather like having something dawn on you.  I have returned to this film several times over the last 14 years and it never ceases to amaze me.  It will touch what creates inside of you.  Enjoy the view.",1096070400,8,606,4.405405405405405
528012,5,6302993210,"I am not sure what the person before me knows about French cinema and the history of this film in particular but before posting comments that border sheer ignorance PLEASE do some research. This true masterpiece of a film was shot in 1.33 and that is how La Belle Noiseuse it was shown during the Cannes film festival. This is the prefered original aspect ratio (perhaps some have forgotten that not all films are supposed to be seen in widescreen, many were shot in an academy ratio of 1.33). Though La Belle Noiseuse is a modern film, just like Godard often does, Rivette has chosen a ratio that fits best his vision.
With this said the length of the film has nothing to do with the artistic merits it conveys. This is a strong, utterly sophisticated, yet bold and original film that reaches the very core of the creative process artists go through. Exceptional work!!",1084147200,27,870,4.619354838709677
528013,3,6302993210,"This is a 4-hour French film, and I have seen the VHS version. Although the film is generally criticized for being way too long and boring, I personally found the film very appealing. I enjoyed the slow pacing. The film definitely involves the viewer, and 4 hours later, you feel like you really know these characters, who now have a life of their own. There is a substantial amount of nudity in the film, but it's more about posing for an artist than about sex. This is, in fact, an art film, not a mainstream film. As such, it delves into human emotion as much as it paints the beauty of the female form. I'm giving this film, in advance of its DVD release, 3 stars because it is being released in standard format, which is an insult to any film, and because it may not appeal to the average mainstream viewer, who may be too impatient to watch all 4 hours of it. But for me, it will be a welcome addition to my limited collection of French films.
I absolutely agree with everything said by the 5-star reviewer (except for the statement about this being released in its orginal format, which is apparently erroneous). But having read contemporary French language critiques of this film, and having dicussed it with a few of my French friends (who mostly complained about its length), I still believe that the average mainstream non-French viewer will probably find the film a bit too long and boring. Fans of art film in general, and French films in particular, will definitely treasure it, though. Include me in.",1083542400,40,1515,4.573529411764706
528014,3,6302993210,"After receiving extraordinary acclaim for his 4-hour masterwork ""La Belle Noiseuse"", seminal French New Wave director Jacques Rivette edited it down to 2 hours (by jettisoning its long real-time takes of an artist at work), substituting alternate takes of certain scenes and making subtle but important changes in the scene order. The result is ""Divertimento"", a slightly darker and, in my opinion, substantially lesser work.
If you admire ""La Belle Noiseuse"" as much as I do, ""Divertimento"" will give you a thought-provoking but not revelatory new angle on a great film. If you haven't seen ""La Belle Noiseuse"" yet, don't cheat yourself by watching this one first.",983836800,68,665,5.224299065420561

528079,4,6302993210,"""La Belle Noiseuse"" is a lovely four-hour film about an artist and his model, and men and women.  Emmanuelle B&eacute;art is the very essence of a beautiful woman.  To watch her in this film must be difficult for women, because of her striking natural beauty and grace.  Few if any would measure up, worldwide.

Such a film could never be made by the American studios because of its length and painstaking attention to detail, as the aging artist--played magnificently by Michel Piccoli--attempts to create his ""masterpiece,"" one stroke at a time.  The film has an intermission, which would seem to have been vital when it was screened in French cinemas and elsewhere.

To watch two DVDs, and take time to do so, underscores the brilliance of so many French films over the years.  The supporting cast members are terrific too, all of them.  The only reason for four rather than five stars is because its length will not enthrall everyone, but it is well worth watching from beginning to end, and then watching the special features that come with the DVDs.",1219363200,,1055,4.790055248618785
528080,4,6302993210,"This loses a star for its sheer length, at 229 minutes its too long. As with a lot of French films I found the beginning very slow. Nothing really seemed to happen in the first 1/2 to 3/4s of an hour. Others will probably rightly say that all this is character development...

However, don't let the above put you off, because actually its a rewarding film on many levels. If you are interested in art then the film will fascinate you. The scenes with the artist and his model are engrossing and even more engrossing for me was watching the creation of the art. You actually see, for minutes at a time, drawing with ink, and charcoal, as well as the frustration of the artist and the magic of creation.

Of course this is also an erotic movie. Emmanuelle Beart as Marianne is a stunning looking art model who is physically manipulated by Frenhofer, the artist, to try and capture something that he never completed when painting his wife ten years earlier.

The story is slight, and yes pretentious, but in the end rewarding, as at the end there are a number of surprises, which neatly tie all the loose ends together. You may like me not appreciate or understand the ending initially, but the revelation ocurred to me the next day and everything fell into place.",1208044800,,1262,4.5506607929515415
528081,3,6302993210,"Too much boring talk from the artist, in what could have been an interesting story.  But with a totally naked Emanuelle Beart hanging around, what man would dare to complain?",1203724800,2,174,4.8
528082,4,6302993210,"This very very French film about an aging artist finding renewal and inspiration in painting a beautiful and difficult young woman is probably the most detailed depiction of the creative process and the interaction between artist and model ever attempted.  You may find it overlong and boring or completely fascinating, depending upon your patience with the leisurely pace and the oh so French talk about relationships, metaphysics and whatnot.

I found no such boredom in watching the difficulty of creation because of the fine portrayal by Michel Piccoli of the irrascible and tasking artist but even more so by the object of his interest, the exquisite work of art that is Beart.  If a couple of hours of viewing the divine Emanuelle in the nude is too much for you, so be it, but it'll do for me.  Interestingly, the long exposure of her beautiful body allows the viewer to begin to see her as the artist does, as shape and texture, surfaces, planes and form.  There is also the effect of the artist's invasive exposure and objectification upon the subject. This is the central fascination of this film, less so the cryptic and enigmatic dialogue.  The artist and model struggle and the outcome of the struggle is change and re-examination for both.  Something different for those who like different.",1198800000,,1304,4.9
528083,5,6302993210,"Rivette's extraordinary drama about a famous artist who feels his well of talent has dried up examines the mysteries and passions that attend the artistic process, and the obsessive intimacy that often develops between painter and model. In a role that demanded a solid, mature, weighty presence, Piccoli is magnificent as Edouard, while Beart is simply ravishing in an equally demanding, robust performance. Expertly and patiently directed by Rivette, who homes in on the mundane details of creating a masterly artwork--the painstaking applications of ink and oil, the methodical refinement of technique--""Noiseuse"" is, quite simply, an enthralling experience. If a four hour viewing time deters you, by all means watch it in two parts.",1184284800,,737,5.473684210526316
528084,4,6302993210,"""La Belle Noiseuse"", directed by Jacques Rivette, is a splendid albeit admittedly extremely long film that manages to make the spectator understand the possibilities and dangers that are distinctive of art. An extremely good painter can bare the soul of his subject, but that is not always a good thing, specially if the artist's ruthless eye concentrates on the worse moral traits of his model. When is it time to stop? And can a real artist betray himself and his art and not paint what he is seeing?

That is the problem Edouard Frenhofer (Michel Piccoli) faced, when he had to choose between his art and his wife. Frenhofer, an extremely famous artist, decided to stop painting a portrait called ""La Belle Noiseuse"", because he knew that his model, his wife Liz (Jane Birkin), would hate the results. According to Liz, ""He wanted to paint me because he loved me. He stopped painting me because he loved me"".

Many years later, Frenhofer gets another chance to finish his painting, thanks to the visit of an admirer, a young painter named Nicolas (David Bursztein). Nicolas suggests that his beautiful girlfriend, Marianne (Emmanuelle Bart), could be the new nude model for ""La Belle Noiseuse"". Frenhofer loves the idea, as does Liz. Even Marianne, mad at first at Nicolas for his suggestion, ends up embracing the challenge. However, as days go by and Frenhofer and Marianne become immersed in a world of their own, Nicolas and Liz start to feel restless, abandoned. They know that the new painting will make a difference, and that things will never be the same between them and their loved ones. But can they do something? And will it be enough?

Of course, the answers to those questions don't really matter, and you will discover them soon enough if you watch this film. What is important, then? In my opinion, the director wants to show us the process of creation through the eyes of an artist and his model, and the hard choices that sometimes must sometimes be made in order to create a real work of art. Is it worth it? And how much of himself and others should the artist be willing to risk? Those are, from my point of view, the real questions that ""La Belle Noiseuse"" makes you ask yourself.

On the whole, I can say that I really liked this film, but that I don't recommend it for everybody. If you are just looking for an engaging movie that will entertaing you and make you laugh, ""La Belle Noiseuse"" is not for you. On the other hand, if you are in the mood for a relatively little known jewel that will amaze and disturb you, making you think, watch this dvd.

528085,5,6302993210,"Jacques Rivette's sublime masterpiece deals with the exploration of the artistic process in terms of its exploitation for destructiveness and its transcendent power.  Here we have the confrontation of an inactive painter, and a model, where we will witness the initial antagonism through a true escalade of wary hostility, driving one each other to dangerous limits.

This film deserved the Grand Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival.",1168992000,5,436,5.397058823529412
528086,5,6302993210,"The French New Wave is justifiably famous in cinema circles, schools, etc..  It is still talked about today.  When they mention the filmmakers that came from that school of filmmaking, they mention Jean-Luc Godard, Eric Rohmer, and Francois Truffault.  Rarely, if ever, do they mention Jacques Rivette.  When a friend of mine asked me my favorite French directors, I said Robert Bresson, Jean-Luc Godard, and Jacques Rivette.  My friend said ""Rivette?""  Jacques Rivette's films stand out from any other French filmmaker of his time.  The other French New Wave filmmakers were prolific, whereas Rivette would make a film every few years.  Rivette's films are generally very long (the most extreme example being the film Out 1, which runs 12 1/2 hours, his other films run on average 3-4 hours), and concern themselves with the artistic process.  This is a 4 hour film (slightly longer than most Rivette films, but not the longest), but it unfolds magisterially and beautifully.  I saw it in a theater (with an intermission), and I was entralled.  It is one of Rivette's best films, and one that really shows the agony of artistic creation.  Creating art is a long and arduous process.  Kubrick compared his art, filmmaking, to trying to write War and Peace in a bumpy car ride, but when you've finished, it's an amazing feeling.  Its pacing is very slow and leisurely, but there isn't anything wrong with that.  I didn't feel bored, and I didn't feel that the film needed to be cut.  It's perfect the way it is.  The title is translated ""a pretty nuisance"", for those who are curious.  This film really captures that.  On a completely unrelated sidenote, I remember seeing this film with 2 couples in front of me.  The women liked it, but the men were bored out of their minds.  One kept shifting his head back and forth throughout the whole thing.  The men were probably just hoping to get laid afterwards, so that's why they went to see it.  You should really only see this film if you're a committed art cinema person.  Luckily, I am.  This is one of Rivette's best films, and he's a filmmaker that deserves to be better known.",1166227200,2,2129,4.735694822888283
528127,5,6302993210,"After living with this film for 15 years, it seems to me that the best description of its theme comes in the words of the character Liz (Jane Birkin), who in context is speaking of the work of her husband, the painter Frenhofer.  According to her, it concerns something ""shameful--it's not the body that is shameful, not the nudity, but something else . . .""

That ""something else"" is a violation, existentially speaking, of the enigma of the painter's model.  Such a violation cannot be seen without the mediation of art.  In a cinematic context, it is the risk the direction takes whenever it approaches its subject frontally, and we can see Rivette's tendency to retreat to wide shots, to place events off-screen, or to circle behind his players. Is this a critique of Bresson, who insisted on calling his players ""models"" rather than ""actors?""  (It is impossible not to recall the storied psychological scars Bresson's methods allegedly left on his players. )  It is clearly not that simple, for there are close-ups in NOISEUSE that seem to be as cruel to the actors as Frenhofer is to his model.

This goes beyond Bresson in other ways: Rivette, always the reader, has patched together a thumping good story from literary sources ranging from Poe to Balzac to James, and in the process has created a true mystery thriller.  That the mystery hinges on four-minute shots of a hand scratching out a drawing makes it no less thrilling.  It tumbles forward toward a profoundly ironic ending worthy of the best James novels.

The initial critical take on this film was that it was the most thorough document of the artistic process ever committed to film.  Well, yes and no.  It seems to be about the artistic process of a painter, but I think there may be a playful game of ""bait-and-switch"" afoot.  Watch Bart.  Watch, especially, Piccoli, who is a veritable encyclopedia of the actor's art, as mesmerizing in his scudding, absent-minded movements as he is in his sudden precision, always surprising.  Rivette's devotion to actors is clear in all his films: think of his sets, so resembling stages with their creaky boards, a sound ""effect"" in Rivette that more often than not takes the place of score.

It may be that the artist of canvas, plaster, stone, or screen may reveal something secret, even  shameful, in his models.  It may even be that the unscrupulous artist is a thief of the soul.  But Rivette, for one, shows in LA BELLE NOISEUSE that he has given these things some serious thought.  And he is always generous to his actors.  The result is that the trust between artist and model demonstrated in this film amounts to a strong rebuke to the idea that film cannot show thought.  It can; it comes at a price, but in the hands of a master it can be as great a gift to the players as it is to the audience.",1161302400,14,2818,4.650505050505051
528128,5,6302993210,"Can watching paint dry be riveting, interesting, and compelling? Can looking at a beautiful woman who is naked for almost three of four hours long movie be not erotic? Is it possible to watch the movie where an Artist creates sketch after sketch of his model in preparation for a painting and many scenes run in real time and not become bored but instead be totally absorbed by the painter on the screen and how he was progressing with his work? Jacques Rivette's ""Le Belle Noiseuse"" is certainly not for every taste but I found it immensely rewarding. It is one of very few films where creative process with all its tension, uncertainty, selfishness and self-centering of an artist who once he began working is nearly oblivious not only to his model's discomfort but to the feelings of the ones close to him have been shown on the screen with such truthful passion, technical excellence, and tremendous acting. Michel Piccoli as an aging painter Edouard Frenhofer, once famous and productive, Jane Birkin (Liz)- his much younger wife and a former favorite model, and Emmanuelle Bart as Marianne, the young, bright, and intensely intelligent woman whose presence awakened Frenhofer from semi-lethargy and made him want to paint again were unforgettable.

Of course the only thing it has in common with QT's film is an exquisite blonde leading lady.

Like many French films, there's just an overabundance of random, pointless ""quasi-journalistic"" everyday stuff that should have been left on the cutting room floor because they do nothing to move the plot along, develop the main characters, or expound on an underlying theme.  My guesstimation is that a good hour could have been cut from this movie and it would still be very good (I wouldn't cut out any of Ms. Beart's divine nude scenes of course, that would be sacriledge).

This is an ""art"" film in the literal sense of the word: you get to see  not only the psychological/inspirational/interpersonal process of painting a human being, but also the nitty gritty physical/craft side as well.

It is a lot like homework&#8212;you're glad for having the knowledge, and nothing can replace it, but wouldn't it be nice to not have to do it?

It details a painter's efforts to capture the very soul of his subject in an image fixed on canvas, which therefore captures only a single moment.  The effect of this struggle on both artist and model is the theme of the movie.  Oddly, this struggle is captured in the film much more through dialog than visually.  For those who will find this sort of conversation among characters interesting, the run time doesn't seem all that long.  This movie is likely to appeal to the same audience that enjoyed ""My Dinner with Andre,"" although unlike that movie I'm not sure this one would bear repeated viewings -- it seemed to deliver up everything it had to say on the first viewing.",1117065600,3,804,4.755395683453237

The quality is not bad - better than a VHS tape but not equivalent to the newest DVD's. This film uses very slow pacing - I liked it a lot although it's certainly not something for the MTV generation where everything has to be done at warp speed. The camera dwells on the painting process brush stroke by brush stroke interspersed by the beautiful body of Emmanuelle Bart. The French countryside scenery, the old house of the artist and the studio are examples of beautiful photography. You have lots of time during this film to admire the old painted woodwork of the doors and mouldings - the spaciousness of the house reminds me of Rodin's old house now the Musee Rodin. The primary colors used on the interior doors and trim remind me a lot of Monets house at Giverny. This is an artists house. I loved this film for the atmosphere and the character development. I'm not sure if all films should be done this way, but the snails pace works well here. It allows you to soak up the atmosphere - after 4 hours it was over and believe it or not I was still looking for more. A film definitely not for everybody but I'm glad it was created.

528136,5,6302993210,"Time and space put together create an existence.  The existence that La Belle Noiseuse illustrates is human interaction.  An existence with human relations offers both abstracts and tangibles, however, a complete description of existence is very difficult to illustrate in regards to human relation.  A complete description would illustrate moments of thought, feeling, and action, as these would interact with one another.  Thus, reality is a muddled concoction of the tangible and intangible.  The complete image of the truth will never be fully uncovered, as reality does not allow the audience to know the secrets that each individual possesses in their mind.  Despite the abstract concept of ultimate truth, La Belle Noiseuse conceptualizes such a moment where time and space merge into existence while it flirts with the notion of complete illustration of human existence.

The story opens in a small courtyard during a sweltering summer day where Nicolas (David Bursztein) is sitting in the shadow enjoying a cup of coffee.  His girlfriend Marianne (Emmanuelle B&eacute;art) sneaks up on him taking a photo while pretending to be a paparazzi.  Two British women see the moment when Marianne takes the picture with the camera and the following situation, as they quickly come to their assumption of the situation.  However, this moment provides an insight to what is to come in the film, as the audience realizes that one cannot always trust what one sees.

Porbus (Gilles Arbona), a friend of Nicolas and Marianne, arrives later the same day and he is to bring Nicolas who is an up and coming painter to meet Edouard Frenhofer (Michel Piccoli).  Frenhofer's wife, Liz, (Jane Birkin), greets them when they arrive and it seems Frenhofer has forgotten about his meeting with Nicolas.  However, Frenhofer returns home after they have waited for sometime in the hot afternoon sun sipping on something cool.  The sixty-year-old Frenhofer used to be a talented painter, but has not accomplished anything of significance in the last decade.

During the visit at the Frenhofer's chteau, the audience will experience an ominous atmosphere, as if to warn the characters in the film.  Marianne recognizes there is something strange in the works, but Nicolas who wants to meet with Frenhofer puts her worries aside.  However, the bizarre ambiance continues to hang in the air, until Porbus accidentally shakes up the atmosphere at a late supper.

The heat makes the small group seek the cool air of Frenhofer's studio.  Their conversation leads toward art and Frenhofer's creations, which eventually leads to La Belle Noiseuse.  La Belle Noiseuse is a painting that Frenhofer never created, but rather exists as an idea.  However, something suggests that it actually was painted, but he never was satisfied with the painting and it may have disappeared.  Later, when Porbus accidentally shakes up the atmosphere, the idea of using Marianne as a model for the La Belle Noiseuse materializes.  Nicolas agrees that it is a good idea and accepts on Marianne's behalf while Porbus agrees to purchase the painting.  Up to this point, the audience will only have seen less than 30 minutes of this epic four-hour long film.

Later Marianne learns from Nicolas that he has accepted that she will model for Frenhoher.  Frustration boils up inside of her, but instead of following her own will she returns to the chteau to begin her modeling.  Cleverly, the director Jacques Rivette displays prolonged scenes where the audience can observe the creation of several sketches over the artist's shoulder.  Vigorously Frenhofer attempts to capture the essence of Marianne while she resists giving whatever he struggles to transfer to a canvas.  The audience can hear Frenhofer's hard work, as the pen is scratching the paper on which he is making sketches to help him capture the true Marianne.

Throughout Frenhofer's artistic process, the audience can bear witness to Nicolas who begins change his mind as he feels both guilt and jealousy.  Initially, Liz offers comfort to Nicolas, but she too slowly changes her disposition of loving support to jealousy.  However, Liz's jealousy is not in regards to her husband being able to see Marianne naked all day, but rather due to a void inside her.  Simultaneously, as she is dealing with her jealousy she tries to protect Marianne from a painful experience, which she knows will hurt her at the end.

La Belle Noiseuse is a brave film that tries to show something new, which Jacques Rivette successfully does.  The cerebral process and emotional struggle of an artist is brought to the light through painstakingly long scenes, which are necessary to depict what Rivette attempts to show.  Rivette proves that it is possible to combine the intangible and the tangible in one image, as he shows the long process of bringing them together in time and space on a simple fabric of canvas.",1110240000,4,4910,5.09375
7833062,2,6302993210,"La Belle Noiseuse,"" also known as The Beautiful Troublemaker, is Jacques Rivettes intimate exploration of the convergence between artistry and eroticism. Edouard Frenhofer (Michel Piccoli) is a reclusive painter living in the French countryside with his wife Liz (Jane Birkin). Their lives are radically altered with the arrival of a younger artist, Nicolas (David Bursztein), and his girlfriend Marianne (Emmanuel Beart), who becomes the muse that awakens Edouards fading passions. The film is both a character study and a thoughtful examination of the creative process.

Long stretches of this four-hour film simply observe a painter at work on a series of sketches in preparation for the completion of his long-abandoned masterpiece. This is the films major problem. Its pace is glacial, with little kinetic energy. We get to see into the mind of the artist, but in laborious fashion. Rivette uses a variation of the romantic triangle to show that the characters are interested in more than just their easels and paints, but  shots linger and dwell. Some judicious editing would help enormously in maintaining viewer attention.

Rivette does cut away from time to time to focus on Nicolas and Liz, and these scenes do offer variety in the storytelling. The movie is based on a story by Balzac, which ends in madness and death. Rivette concludes on a more positive note, though a decision that Frenhofer makes is not without personal consequences.",1525910400,,1449,5.210300429184549
7833063,5,6302993210,"An outstanding movie.  I'm shocked to find that Jacques Rivette can make a real movie, one that does not stink of artificial constructs.  I did not think that he had it in him to aspire, much less achieve a real movie.  He has always been that cute little director that actor's love (or hate).  The man that made very long tire-some small movies that moved in circles, round and round, but going nowhere.  Movies that must be explained, wherein the movie itself does not prove self evident are failures and Rivette has been a champion of failures.  Excepting La Belle Noiseuse and to a lesser extent it's ""Divertimento"" his work has always been disappointing.

So I'm surprise, shocked that he could make a great movie.  Piccoli, Birkin and Beart are all excellent, particularly Piccoli.  This movie is much less about the creative process than it is about the need to prepare to make the effort, to rev oneself up in order to create - to reach the manic stage necessary for creation.  It touches on the self absorption that is required and the resulting exhaustion.  Four hours fly by when they are well spent.  See this movie, hopefully, it will be rereleased at an affordable price.",1438905600,,1185,4.699029126213592

7833066,5,6302993210,"Since I find Emmanuelle Bart to be one of the best-looking actresses Ive ever seen, and this film is probably best known for extended shots of her posing in the nude, I had expected the film to be rather erotic. However, I didn't find the film to have even a trace of eroticism. Instead, it is one of the deepest and most genuine films about art, and itself a great work of art. The story is about the conflict between the demands of art and the demands of life (that is, of human relationships). Art is well known to be a hard master who will not tolerate anyone trying to serve another, and Van Goghs ear or the corpses of musicians from Charlie Parker to Amy Winehouse are only the most famous exhibits in a universe of wreckage with which artists lives have historically been strewn. The story told here is of one artists struggle to find a resolution to this conflict. For years the hero of the film has done no real work, as the human cost of achieving artistic perfection has proven to be too high in his relationship with his wife. The appearance of a stranger who will model for him raises the possibility of a return to artistic achievement. The film shows poignantly what the human cost of that is. It also shows how heavy a price must be paid by the artist in the end to regain his humanity. A truly great film, that would be immeasurably cheapened by reducing it to the level of the erotic.
It is perhaps also worth noting that due to the length of the film I had originally intended to watch it in at least two sittings, but found it impossible not to watch it in one.",1406419200,,1582,4.3120805369127515

a mesmerising film.
I was struck by the detail,
the long takes,
the very 'French' decor,
the pastels,
stone walls,
draping curtains,and
the sound of cicadas.

Watching the painter at his craft
was illuminating, and captivating.
Not being a painter myself,
it was instructive
to watch an artist at work.

Emmanuelle Beart?  Beautiful, yes,
but was she the saviour of this film
as another Reviewer suggested?
I don't think so.

I would have to watch it again
but i think the film's
saviour is the
honest depiction of the struggle to create,
though i must admit,
more than once i asked myself
would the artist have been as interested
if his subject wasn't Emmanuelle Beart,",1335744000,,675,4.793103448275862
7833068,5,6302993210,"A famous old artist who wants to paint one more masterpiece, a painting he abandoned ten years before, when he felt he had to choose between his art and his love for his young wife, who was also his model.  He chose love, but mourns the loss of his masterpiece.  When the beautiful pest comes along, his wife urges him to take up his project again, this time with a woman he's not emotionally involved with.  But this is not merely a character study of the old artist, but of his model as well.  She's as ambitious as he for this painting, and puts up with his coldness, the difficult and painful poses he makes her hold.  She makes him talk about his art, about why he abandoned the previous painting, his fears that he has lost his talent.  At a crucial point, when he's ready to abandon the project, she makes him go on.  She wants to be immortalized in paint as much as he wants to paint his masterpiece.  And the other characters play their parts, too.  The wife, who has had an affair but wants to recommit to her much older husband and see him regain his artistic confidence.  The model's photographer boyfriend, who wants to keep her dependent upon him and fears her new self-confidence, her independence.  The wife's ""art"" of taxidermy  comments ironically on his art; must the painter kill the thing he loves?

A long film which will sound incredibly boring when I tell you there are sustained sequences in which we just see sketching, but it is surprisingly engaging just because of those sequences, which turn out to be very dramatic.
