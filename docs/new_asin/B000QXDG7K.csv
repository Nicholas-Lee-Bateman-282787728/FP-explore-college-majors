2849532,5,B000QXDG7K,"I saw the movie in the theater and had a great time.  An entire theater filled with Naruto fans!

If you love Naruto, you'll love the movie.  It's like a regular Naruto episode, only longer.  It was kind of strange seeing Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura watching a movie in a theater as they do in one of the beginning scenes.  Do they have a theater in the Hidden Leaf Village?
Well, at least they weren't watching from the seats like everyone else.

There is action, intrigue and lots of laughs.  And more of our favorite sensei - Kakashi!!!!  (Can you tell he's my favorite character?)  Naruto gets a chance to try out his new (that is, new to American fans who watch the episodes in English on TV) jutsu - Rasengan!

The movie in the theater included interviews with all the voice actors (both Japanese and English) and it was very interesting.  I hope this will be on the video but don't know - Shonen Jump never gave me a call about it.

Buy this movie with confidence - it's great!  Believe it!",1186790400,3,996,4.377049180327869
2849533,5,B000QXDG7K,"This is the first of 3 Naruto movies that have been made so far. I have seen the Japanese version of this movie and its got an amazing storyline and amazing action. Along with some unknown ninja foes. I couldn't not see it in the theatres because there was not one near me doing it, at least not near enough for me to easily get to. I cant wait to hear the English dialogue. I certainly hope they put the other 2 movies into English because they are even better then this one. And the 3rd one even features Rock Lee. I also hope it comes with a free promo card. One can only hope.",1183507200,2,580,4.052173913043478

The only problem is, The English acting. It's terrible.
It's bloody terrible. If you think it's good I want you to watch a subbed episode. (That means it's in Japanese and the subtitles are in English). THEN TELL ME HOW GOOD YOUR ENGLISH VERSION IS!
Amazon doesn't have that option.

December 25th, 1875:

As far and as wide as I have travelled in my years, there is nothing in the world quite like Christmas-time in London. The crisp winter air echoes with the song of carolers and everywhere one looks the eyes of his fellow men are filled with an air of peace and charity. I gave the help the day off after our early meal and have spent the evening in quiet reflection and planning - for this Christmas, the germ of a grand and glorious new expedition has presented itself to me.

Two nights ago I attended a Christmas party at the gentlemen's club. The food was fine and the drinks flowed freely, and I remained in conversation with several of my fellow naturalists until well into the morning. Shortly after midnight our discussion turned to the topic of the super-natural, and Mr. Wallace, the famed father of evolutionary theory and a noted Spiritualist, told me of a most unusual occurrence he had heard of recently. An associate of his had recently returned from the Levant with a most unusual artifact - a small red disc, fashioned perhaps of cinnabar, carved with runes he thought to be an early form of Phoenician, or perhaps Cretan. When left to its own devices, the object would roll about on its own and reach great speeds, breaking through walls and crushing anything in its path, until it came to rest upon a mirrored surface. A man could pick it up easily no matter how fast it moved, he claimed, and until it was set down it would glow brightly in strange colours. We found this account most curious, but what Mr. Wallace told us next proved even more interesting.

Two months ago, he said, his associate's maid had been cleaning in the room where the disc laid pressed against one of his dressing mirrors. Ignorant of the object's nature, the maid lifted it up to dust underneath it and set it back upon the mirror - whereupon, the maid had said, the mirror's surface rippled and a man in strange clothes fell through, as if he had been leaning upon a wall that gave way. The man panicked and began flailing about and shouting nonsensically, and tried to flee before the maid locked him in the room and called the police, who took the man away as he shouted and tried to run back in the direction of the room he had apparated in. Mr. Wallace's associate had thought him at first a common thief, but there was absolutely no way the man could have entered the estate without arousing suspicion, and the maid's account was most clear - he had come through the mirror.

I have long wondered if there were other worlds in Creation where man, or beings like man, have existed and thrived; but owing to the great vastness of space, I have long assumed that none of them would be within our reach for some time. If Mr. Wallace's account was true, there might be a way to travel to one of those worlds right here in London! I entreated with Mr. Wallace for some time to divulge the name of his confederate; he refused out of respect for his friend's privacy, but told me that the strange intruder, who claimed the name ""Izikaiah Belson"", had been declared mad by the court and sentenced to Bedlam, and that I might find him there if I wished to. After New Year's, I intend to call upon this madman.

January 3rd, 1876:

The fact that an institution like Bedlam is allowed to exist in our great nation is an affront. Were a man not already mad upon entering these walls, the circumstances of his internment would make him so. I did my best to avert my eyes from the lunatics packed into dingy cells and overcrowded wards as a porter lead me to a padded cell where the man called Izikaiah Belson had been locked away alone. None of the doctors had been able to speak to him, she said; if I wished to try, I was more than welcome to do so. A gruff-looking gaoler with a large and ancient-looking key-ring unlocked the door, and I invited myself inside, where Mr. Belson sat alone in the corner. I introduced myself and said I had come to learn what I could of who he was and where he came from. He did not respond at first and turned his head away, mumbling under his breath. I listened carefully and found that the tongue he spoke almost resembled the English language, but it was far from any tongue that has ever been spoken in the Queen's court; twisted and altered as if by centuries of deviation, not dissimilar from how the many and various Romance languages evolved from the breakdown of the Roman Empire. I stood and listened attentively as he repeated a series of sentences three times, that I present below;

Hae who are bitwayn space, press'd is yir voce. Yi are watchen n' I yir vyss'l, here n' here n' there. Awaye wit' me sin, Vaader, n' shed for me yir sanggre weppin', n' I'll but do the word of the Vaaders b'low ye. S'beit.

The man's accent was strange, and it was part-way through his third recitation when it occurred to me that he was attempting to pray. I knew the prayer well, and when he finished his third recitation, I repeated it back to him in the Queen's English. He fell silent as he heard my rendition. His first reaction was more vitriolic than I expected - I believe he accused me of having ""the speech of the old elders"", and accused me of being a sinner or a witch. I assured him as best I could that I was neither; I am a naturalist. He seemed to calm himself somewhat when he heard that word; in any event, he no longer feared me, and over the course of an hour or two we worked out a pidgin of English and his dialect in which we could converse. In time, I came to the conclusion that he hails from a world which is surprisingly like, and yet completely alien to our own.

Mr. Belson claimed to have come from a place called ""The City Where Elijah Fell"". He describes it as a metropolis that would put London to shame; tens of millions of souls call it home, living in towers thousands of feet high, commuting on great trains and horse-less carriages that moved hundreds of miles per hour through the packed streets. Every building was wired with electricity, and possessed devices for receiving of sights and sounds from the other end of the world, for delivering the contained knowledge of entire libraries, and other incredible wonders. I showed him a map of the world and asked where this city lay, and he pointed to America, on the western coast of the Floridian peninsula. He claimed he had been at work in one of the city's great towers, momentarily leaning against a wall during a prayer break, when the wall seemed to fall away behind him and he found himself in a strange old house with a strangely dressed woman screaming at him, confirming Mr. Wallace's account.

I showed him a Bible I procured from one of the doctors and asked if he was a Christian. He recoiled at the proposition as he had when I recited the Lord's Prayer, and informed me that, while the elders had been Christians in days gone by, all of that had changed with the Second Coming and the authoring of the Third Testament, and that to openly proclaim to be a Christian was a heresy and a most heinous crime. I gather that in the nation Mr. Belson hails from, which he claims to control the entire world, the church and the state have been brought together in a way that would make the Archbishop of Canterbury himself a proponent of disestablishmentarianism. I asked what becomes of heretics when they are caught and he informed me that they are ""made pure in S'Tears""; for if heresy is allowed to spread unchecked, then ""the Unclean"" shall come and bring destruction to the pure and the wicked alike.

Mr. Belson refused to elaborate further when I asked him what the Unclean were. He asserted that it was blasphemy to even speak of them, for to say their name might draw their attention. I assured him that nobody in London would harm him for speaking of this matter, and that, whatever an ""Unclean"" might be, there were none in any corner of this world that I have explored. Belson was visibly frightened as he told me, in halting whispers, that the Unclean were the Devil. But unlike the Devil of the heretics, who lived in the pits below, these Devils walked the Earth. They were giant creatures, behemoths of pure sin, all of man's unrighteous thoughts and deeds given flesh. They stalked the darkest corners of the world and their sin tainted the Earth itself so that no crop could grow and no man could live, and it took all the efforts of the holiest crusaders to keep them so imprisoned lest they break free and the world come to an end.

Until such time as the doctor assured me I must leave for the night, I remained in Belson's cell and learned as much as I could of this strange world he came from - matters of language, culture, fashion, everything a man might need to know to travel amongst its gleaming cities anonymously. I managed to cajole a young nurse at the clerk's desk into letting me review Belson's file, and I learned that the affray that lead to his arrest occurred in Notting Hill at the residence of a Mr. Weathers. Tomorrow I shall call upon him and state my intent to purchase this disc that turns mirrors into gateways to another world; for I intend to conduct a survey of this civilization to rival Sir Burton's forbidden journey into Mecca, and, if I can, find one of these diabolical monsters Mr. Belson speaks of, and make it my prey.

January 9th, 1876:

Mr. Weathers was quite relieved to be rid of the disc when I purchased it from him. It glowed an eerie purple as he handed it to me; and yet once in my own hand, its aura seemed to fade, and become instead a greenish hue. I took it home and placed it on a mirror in my study, and immediately the glass seemed to become as water. I saw a pastoral scene not unlike that which one might behold in our own country-side; a farmhouse in the distance, tilled fields with tall crops between. There were children running and playing among the crops, and in the distance, over the horizon, I saw in silhouette titanic structures taller than any building man on this Earth has ever made. For several days I observed through the mirror; on a few occasions the farmer and his hands came close enough that I could hear their speech; the accent not as thick as Mr. Belson's had been, but foreign enough that I strained to decypher their conversations. The clothes they wore were not unlike those a farm-hand might wear in England; but Mr. Belson had warned me the fashions in the city were very different from what he had seen in London, and I would be most out of place in any of my usual clothes. A visit to the Metropolitan Police, and after a lengthy conversation with the precinct constable and the promise of a sizable donation I was able to acquire the clothes Mr. Belson had been wearing at the time he entered our world. It was not dissimilar to morning dress, but to my eye it seemed less formal; there was no waistcoat, the jacket was shorter and cut more conservatively with broad lapels, the cravat was thin and a solid shade of black. I had Deeds tailor it to fit me, and I stowed it away for when I reach the city.

I have packed lightly, for I shall be travelling alone and I shall have none of the native currency, for Mr. Belson had carried no bill-fold when he entered our world. I have my clothes and rations for a few days, and I shall enter dressed in a farmer's garb and remain so dressed until I reach the metropolis. Gold and silver I have brought in the hopes of trading for currency (Mr. Belson having informed me that the principal form of trade is paper), and within my pack I have hidden my pistol and several of Mr. Moth's weapons. I have my compass, my sextant, my electric torch, a comprehensive atlas of the world, and my journal, and a few good luck talismans besides those. The cycle of day and night in this other world is some eight hours behind our own; from this I deduce that the scene I behold is somewhere along the western coast of America. I shall cross through the looking-glass under cover of night this evening, for fear of alarming the farmers of my presence, and make my way towards the city; where, hopefully, I can discover a library or an institute of learning and document the history and culture of this world - and where the so-called Unfertile Zones are located, so that I might observe these Unclean for myself.

January 10th, 1876:

What a world this is indeed.

This is indeed one of the more temperate parts of the world, for though it was past midnight local time when I entered this world, the air was perfectly warm. Based on my reading of the stars, I judge myself to be somewhere near the thirty-fourth parallel, in the region that must in this world correspond to the land of California. Here in the fields it is dark; but in the southeast I behold a stunning panorama of light shining into the darkness, the aura of the great metropolis bathed in electric light so bright that it shrouds the stars themselves above it. In the distance I heard sounds like great engines. The terrain was easily passed, even in the darkness, save for a fence at the edge of the farm I had alighted into, which I was forced to climb.

The sight I beheld when I reached the source of the noise was unbelievable. A great paved road lay stretched across the grassland, solid barriers at either side. It was wider than any road I have ever beheld, and stripes painted on the road indicated sixteen lanes for traffic - eight going in one direction, and eight in the other. The entire road was lit by giant lamps brighter than the gas-lamps of London or New York, and one could have read a newspaper comfortably by their light. Even at this late hour, I watched in surprise and wonder (and no small amount of terror, I must admit) as motor-carriages far more advanced than Mr. Bollee's steam-cars hurtled along the road at speeds faster than the finest locomotive or the fastest race-horse. They must have been travelling a hundred miles per hour or more - some of them small enough to carry a handful of people, others massive like train cars and looking to haul cargo by the ton. Some never touched the roadway at all, seemingly gliding on a cushion of air. I had to sit by the roadside, obscured in shadow, for some time while I took this in. Many times in my life I have encountered savage tribes that never before have seen the wonders of civilization. At this moment, I felt the savage myself, beholding wonders he has no hope of contemplating.

I dared not cross the road, and as it seemed like a straight-away enough path to the city,I walked for several hours along its shoulder. It was difficult to tell in the darkness, but it looked to be about thirty miles to the out-skirts of the city, and I judged it would take well past mid-day to reach the inhabited areas. I feared that any of the carriages hurtling by might at any moment careen out of control and catastrophe would ensue, and I wondered how any man could bear such speeds. The eastern sky was beginning to show the tint of dawn when one of the carriages slowed to a stop on the edge of the road, next to me, a door opened, and a voice from within asked if I desired a ride into the city. I have never been one to rely on the charity of strangers, but I was curious to examine one of the carriages from the inside and accepted.

It was scarsely a quarter hour before we were among the crystalline towers of the metropolis. I did my best to disguise my terror as the driver, who identified himself as Ben O'Kazzem, inquired of my business. I told him my name was Teodor Swarzrod (that, Mr. Belson had told me, being how my name would be presented in his language), that I was a farm-hand in the nearby country-side, and that I had never before been to the city but that I intended to research my family's history at one of the major libraries therein. We struggled to understand each other as I had yet to fully master the dialect, but his assumption that I merely had a ""country accent"" saved me any uncomfortable questions. I disembarked in the financial center of the city and offered to pay him for the ride with one of my gold slugs. He refused saying it was far too much for a simple ride, and I offered him a silver slug instead - which he accepted, and offered me a considerable sum of paper currency in the balance, while commenting that he never imagined the country-folk had such wealth at their disposal.

This metropolis, which I now know to be called the City of Angelic Glory, is easily larger than any city in all the world - I imagine the entire population of England could dwell within and find themselves wanting for neighbors. There is a great bustle everywhere I go in the city, and yet, there is a desperation and fear that underlies it all; nobody meets anyone's gaze, and every man seems constantly to fear and suspect every other. With the bank-notes Mr. O'Kazzem had given me, I breakfasted in a bustling cafe where I enjoyed a meal barely dissimilar from the full breakfast one can find at any reputable establishment in London, and I have found board in a grand hotel named the St. George. Imagine my surprise when I was told my room would be on the seventy-eighth floor! An electric lift that would make Mr. Otis green with envy whisked me to the impossible height in seconds, and I found myself staring out a window at the gargantuan city. Towers like the one in which I stood jutted out in all directions, many of them extending hundreds of feet even above my own vantage point. Highways not unlike the one that took me to the city cris-crossed the metropolis and formed a ring around its perimeter, and I beheld a massive network of smaller roads and railways. The hotel concierge has given me directions to the civic library - tomorrow I shall seek it out, but for now I must close the curtains on this impossible scene and rest, for I find myself overwhelmed and weary.

January 11th, 1876:

My findings at this city's great library have shed much light into the nature of the world I now find myself in. The library itself stood twelve levels high - not as tall as many of the other buildings in the City of Angelic Glory, but easily taller than any institution of learning in London. A librarian guided me to the eighth level where I would find books of history and geography, and I spent the day immersed in study. Though the books are written in strange letters that do not resemble any I have ever seen, I have found somehow that I am able to understand them as if it were common English writing.

A comparison of a world map to the one in my own atlas confirmed that I was in the land of California, in about the same area as a town that in our world is known as Los Angeles. Many great cities in this world stood in the same place as cities in our own, though none shared the same name - London was here called the City of Winston's Stand, and Edo the City of David's Triumph. I saw no national boundaries on the map, though there were many names indicating different regions - the United Lands of the Son, Huffasia, the Land Bountiful. The only divisions indicated were between the ""Blessed Lands"", colored green, and the ""Unfertile Lands"", colored red. There were Unfertile Lands spread across the globe, though I found the distribution most uneven - in North America I saw but seven, and in Europe four, while Africa had dozens, and almost the entirety of China was covered by them.

I found that the Bible exists in this world, but it is a Bible very unlike our own. It is about a thousand pages longer and is divided into three sections, named the First, Second, and Third Testaments. The First and Second Testaments are similar to the Old and New Testaments of our Bible, but have been extensively rewritten - all references to ""God"", ""the LORD"", or ""the Father"" have been replaced with a simple reference to ""Him"", and there is a greater emphasis on sin, uncleanliness, and purification than I recall ever learning in school.

The Third Testament appears to have been written in the seventeenth century; and as I had not the time or inclination to read it in full, I referred to a history book about what is referred to in this world as the Second Coming. Prior to the year 1621 or so, I found, the history of this world had been much like our own aside from certain linguistic and cultural details, and an indication that the wide-spread colonization of the Americas had begun several hundred years earlier. In that year, the being called Him made itself known to the people of the world, and nations worldwide proclaimed it to be their God. He provided them with great advances in technology and medicine, which were the impetus of the advanced civilization I now beheld; but war broke out across the world over the question of which nations were most worthy of His love. When He beheld the devastation that His children had wrought, He wept - and where His tears fell, those who tasted of them were purified of sin and lost their inclination to fight. But those who refused to cease in strife, those who were consumed by sin and evil, their wickedness was magnified in His absence and took form until it became the Unclean, the giant abominations that to this day lurk in the Unfertile Lands. All life that the Unclean encounter is destroyed utterly - men and women, animals, even plants, are all consumed by the creatures and vanish into thin air, leaving behind only the ichor of sin it discharges when it feeds. Agents of the church known as the Blessed Militia guard these lands, and do constant battle to keep the Unclean imprisoned within.

In time, the United Lands of the Son brought together the nations of the world under the rule of a theocracy, governed by a man called the Most Holy Father. There were ten ranks of the clergy, from the Most Holy Father himself to the Blessed Fathers at the bottom, whose hierarchy comprised not only the church, but the courts, the legislature, and the executive powers of government. The judicial system was not unlike English law, though it incorporated elements similar to the canon law of the Roman church, and the clergy were exempt from its direct judgment, for only the Most Holy himself could pass judgment on them. The death penalty was unknown - those who had committed great crimes were bathed in a compound called the Tears, supposedly refined from His own weepings, and if they survived the trial the urge to sin was cleansed from their mind.

As luck would have it, one of the few Unfertile Lands in this country is located in the deserts a hundred miles east of this city. On the maps I spotted a railway line that draws dangerously close to this border. Interestingly enough I noticed that almost every city had a rail line leading directly into the Unfertile Lands as well; but those were marked as for militia use only and I deemed them inaccessible. Tomorrow I shall travel on the train that passes this border and find a way to depart as close to the edge as possible, and determine whether I can smuggle myself into this forbidden land. I know not how much of the history I have read is true and how much is hagiography concocted by the church, but soon I shall find out.

January 14th, 1876:

I am lucky to have escaped the events of the past few days with my life, but even now I may be doomed.

My entry into the Unfertile Lands was uneventful. I was able to excuse myself stealthily from the train during a brief stop, and hiked but a few miles under the desert sun to the edge. The perimeter in this region was guarded only by a fence with prominent signage;

WARNING

UNFERTILE LANDS - UNCLEAN WITHIN

BLESSED MILITIA ONLY BEYOND THIS POINT

By order of the Regional High Father, City of St. Francis' Triumph

The Blessed Militia, I assumed, must have some means of tracking the Unclean and preventing them from crossing the borders of this country. I, on the other hand, would have to rely on luck and Providence.

I could smell the Unclean for hours before I spotted it. Nothing grows in this land and there is no running water, nor so much as a buzzard in the sky, but the air hangs heavy with the undeniable stench of death, worse than the foulest Scottish abattoir or the banks of the putrid Ganges. I could have been sick, but I steeled myself and pressed onward in the direction from which the stench seemed to be its strongest. I assembled and readied the destabilizing musket I had carried in my pack, a special model Mr. Moth had prepared especially for this expedition, and bringing to bear considerably more potential for atomic disassembly than the standard models.

I spotted it after climbing a ridge and almost turned around and retreated right away. I had expected a creature the size of a man or not much larger. The abomination I beheld was easily five hundred feet long and dozens of feet tall. It was almost the shape of a man, but it had no legs; two arms that seemed to grow and shrink as they moved dragged a massive trunk across the desert sands, while a head with no face seemed to lull and stare at nothing in particular. Its skin, the tone of a white man's, was smooth and hairless across its entire body, and it made no sound as it seemed to crawl about aimlessly, a brown ichor seeming to ooze from it before quickly evaporating. It was no wonder the people of this world thought these things to be devils made flesh. Even with my heavy destabilizer at the ready, I was obviously ill-equipped to hunt a creature of this size.

I observed for several hours as it seemed to crawl aimlessly in the same general area, with no particular direction or agenda, taking notes and making sketches. It was late in the afternoon when I determined I would have to turn around - a train bound in the opposite direction would pass by shortly after night-fall, and I intended to board it and return to the city. But luck was not with me - as I stood from my hiding spot upon the ridge, the Unclean's head turned in my direction and it stopped its incessant crawling about. Though it had no eyes or ears, it somehow knew I was there; and though it had no mouth, the abomination let out a blood-curdling moan that echoed for miles. One of the creature's giant arms stretched out in my direction and it began to drag itself my way. I had no choice but to stand and fight. I raised my musket at the creature's featureless visage, took careful aim, and fired.

The Unclean was wholly unaffected as the bolt from my musket passed harmlessly through it and dissipated in the atmosphere. In seconds it was before me and I was sure I was about to die. The creature loomed above me, resting itself on its giant hands, as the face bore down upon me. Before it could presumably devour me whole, I heard a massive report, and a giant shell struck the Unclean in the face and exploded. I was showered with foul-smelling brown ichor as the beast's face was torn open, and though the wound seemed to seal itself quickly, more and more shells struck it in the face, the trunk, the arms. It stumbled and I ran to avoid it falling on me, as men in dark-colored uniforms, decorated with symbols like those I had found on the disc in London, pounded it with artillery. It lurched at them, and one of the soldiers was devoured whole by the creature, its clothes and weapons falling to the ground as the man vanished. Soon it could take no more as the barrage continued, and it turned around and fled back into the desert.

I retreated in the direction from which I had come to find a convoy of armored motor-carriages armed with heavy cannons. I attempted to run, but in seconds the soldiers surrounded me and apprehended me in the name of the Blessed Militia. I was told I was lucky to be alive after attempting such a foolish pursuit and that I would be put to the question by the Court of Blessed Voices. My situation was compounded when one of the soldiers searched my pack and found one of my good-luck charms - a small gold cross that had been given to me by the Patriarch of Alexandria during my exploits there in 1855. The soldiers immediately declared me a heretic, and some were of the opinion I should be shot then and there, or taken back for the Unclean to devour. In either event, I was bound with steel cuffs and escorted to a prison cell where I now await trial. They do not know I still have this journal, though if I am convicted of heresy and put to the Tears it may not long matter.

January 16th, 1876:

I was brought before the Court of Blessed Voices yesterday. The scene I found myself in looked like a scene out of the Spanish Inquisition; three men in arcane robes beheld me from atop the judge's bench, while I stood in the dock guarded by the Blessed Militia. The senior judge advised me I had been accused of heresy and trespassing in the Unfertile Lands and that I faced the Tears, and demanded my plea. No lawyer had been provided of me, and I expected nothing resembling a fair trial if I contested the charges; yet if I plead guilty I would surely be put to the Tears and my mind torn apart by that mysterious concoction. Recalling that the laws of this land were similar to those of medieval England, and that no member of the priesthood might be tried by them, I took a gamble and insisted that I was a man of the cloth, and thereby was entitled to benefit of clergy - the ancient right of a holy man to avoid prosecution by proving his ability to read from the Bible.

The judges were most skeptical of this proposition; even in this nation, the benefit of clergy was an outdated rite, for many more people could read in these days than simply the priesthood. A reference to their legal texts, however, found that the rite had never been disestablished. I was told I could attempt to exercise that benefit if I wished, but that it would then be up to the Most Holy Father himself to judge my fate, and he would be less forgiving than this court. I hoped for nothing less than to play for time, and I agreed.

It was decided that I would be expected to r",1401926400,,29999,4.434325108853411

2849905,4,B000QXDG7K,"Naruto the Movie: Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow is the first theatrical film in the Naruto franchise.  It's a good film; however, it was definitely written in a way where you already had to be familiar with the Naruto anime series in order to fully understand what was going on.  No time was used for any kind of exposition to explain some of the things that are common knowledge from the series.

The menu on the first disc allows you to watch the film, set up your audio and subtitle preferences, select which scene from the film that you'd like to see, and special features.  For the audio options, there is English 5.1, English Stereo, and Japanese Stereo.  For subtitles, you can choose whether to have them on or off.  In the Special Features menu, you have six options.  You can watch the ""Konoha Annual Sports Festival"" short (which preceded the film when it was shown in Japanese movie theaters), you can see the English trailers for the film, you can see trailers for four Viz Media releases, you can see ads for Shonen Jump manga, a screen promoting Toonami Jetstream, and the trailers for several Naruto videogames.

The second disc in the set includes seven special features.  ""Behind the Scenes of U.S. Voice Recording"" is a 20-minute documentary which includes interviews with the Production Manager, ADR directors, and some of the voice actors; you also get to see the voice actors dubbing some of their dialogue for the film.  The second feature is a 10-minute feature which includes interviews with the Japanese voices for Sasuke, Naruto, and Kakashi; this feature is subtitled.  Next is a five-minute feature that includes messages from the ADR Directors, the U.S. voice cast, the Japanese voice cast, and a text message from Masashi Kishimoto, the creator of the Naruto manga.  Next is the seven-minute feature, ""Inside the Animation Studio.""  It is narrated by the U.S. voice actor for Kakashi, and it shows the animation process that the film underwent in Japan from the character sketches to the final rendered product.  Then, an almost eight-minute feature about Naruto at the 2007 New York Comicon is next; it includes interviews with several people involved with the dubbing of the series, as well as some footage from the actual con.  This is followed by the original Japanese movie trailers.  This feature runs for about five minutes and includes ten trailers; unfortunately, it is not subtitled.  The final extra is the original Japanese credits.  It's basically the last five-and-a-half minutes of the film, and does not include subtitles.

The third disc is a CD soundtrack for Naruto the Movie: Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow.  There are twenty instrumental tracks, and the disc is 29 minutes in length.

If you're a Naruto fan, then this film needs to be in your DVD collection.  However, I would recommend getting the deluxe edition DVD if you can.

2849949,3,B000QXDG7K,"My biggest complaint about anime is that 95% of it is extremely derivative as if it's all drawn from the same general template then modified slightly. Too often they have an assembly line feel to it. Unfortunately Naruto is guilty of this sin with a definite lack of originality about it. I liked the look of the snow ninja's but their boss is a totally unoriginal stock anime villain and the story is rather unremarkable. Overall the animation is fairly good but it's not going to win any awards.

This is my first experience with the very popular Naruto series so I'm reviewing this based on complete ignorance of the characters. As I said earlier it bears more than a passing resemblance to dozens of other series like Dragon Ball Z and Full Metal Alchemist. Naruto himself is a likable character with an indomitable spirit although the voice acting can get grating particularly when he's pontificating about never giving up. Naruto's never say die attitude is his defining characteristic but at some point it can get to be a bit much. After about the dozenth time of him saying he'll never give up I started to get a bit numb to it.

When you get right down to it the showpiece for anime like Naruto is the action and this film has one spectacular fight scene. This battle takes place about halfway through the film and I was hoping for another great fight but the final climax wasn't nearly as exciting. Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow seems to be aimed directly at teenagers and younger which makes it more surprising that a scene later in the movie displays a shocking amount of blood, violence and death.

Naruto will likely appeal to a younger audience who haven't already seen this same story played out dozens of different times in other anime. For older audiences I would suggest the wonderful series Cowboy Beebop or give Paprika or Tekkon Kikreet a try.",1204848000,3,1867,4.634441087613293
2849950,5,B000QXDG7K,"I've been disappointed in most anime movies: Usually they contain only enough plot for an episode or two of the series. But this one brings forth a whole additional full-bodied realm for Naruto and company to explore and actually achieves a cinematic scope. If you are a fan of the series, you won't be disappointed. Of course Naruto is the star, but everyone on Team 7 gets a chance to do something cool here -- even Sakura.",1198713600,,425,4.532467532467533
2849951,3,B000QXDG7K,"NARUTO: NINJA CLASH IN THE LAND OF SHOW is the first of three Naruto movies. I love Naruto, and I have never seen the English version (I saw the Japanese version back in 2006 at a screening at Animethon 13), but having seen the original Japanese version I must admit I was kind of dissapointed in the movie, but I still thought it was OK.

Naruto has been stalking a princess actress after being ""moved by her performance"" in THE NINJA STORY OF THE SNOW PRINCESS, a movie to which a sequel is being made. Naruto, Sakura, and Sasuke (our heroes of the day) travel with the film's crew to the Snow country to shoot the movie, and Naruto must protect the princess the whole way.

That's pretty much all I'll give away of the plot, since the plot is a HUGE part of the movie.

I must say, as a Naruto fan, I am kind of dissapointed. I thought this movie would be much better. It had a very good first half, which was followed by a very lackluster second half. Meanwhile we do get great action scenes, we get lots of plot holes too; not to mention the derivativeness (sp?) in the plot (The King Kong-style ""Movie"" subplot, the ""Total Recall""-like ending, etc.). And we get some flashbacks; one which COMPLETELY put me off Kakashi (If you've seen this movie, you'd know what I am talking about). I am also surprised about some character omissions (Rock Lee not being in this for instance, My favorite character!!!!)

And I couldn't believe this movie was only 84 minutes long, it felt like FOREVER.

The 2nd movie is coming out next year, I hope to attend the screening if there is one (which I'm hoping there is). So here's to hoping the 2nd movie's better!",1196726400,5,1652,4.421052631578948
2849952,5,B000QXDG7K,"With the latest anime movies I've seen before this being made in the mid-nineties, I had some low expectations when I ordered this from amazon. But I guess anime movies have come a long way since '95!

STORY
In a nutshell, Naruto and his squad are assigned the task of guarding an actress during the filming of her latest movie. But like all Naruto characters, this actress has some skeletons in her closet and it was only a matter of time until her past catches up with her.

The movie keeps the general flair of the series without getting too caught up in stuff like fight scenes. Like it's canon series counterpart, this movie does a good job of things like good back-stories and character development.

My only nitpicky complaint about the movie itself is that you could tell that the writers were trying to cram in every awesome attack there was available to the according characters (Kakashi and Sasuke's sharingan; Naruto's Mass Shadow Clones; even Sakura's evil side near the start of the movie!). The character designs for the bad guys and other movie-only characters are also not the best (the Princess' is probably the best out of all the new characters), but their back-story and weird quirks definitely make up for this.

Amazingly enough, this movie also fits in well into the series (as far as I know). Naruto's flashback in the series and Sasuke still being there shows that the movie is around the time right after Tsunade arrives in the village.

TECHNICAL STUFF
As for the animation, you can definitely tell that the movie got the royal treatment in that department. You can especially tell during the chidori/wolf scene. And, of course, like all current animated shows, the picture quality is beautiful. The background music also keeps most of the more memorable music from the series as well as some new tracks of their own.

One thing I was worried about when ordering this DVD was it's aspect ratio. See, the movie was originally filmed to be shown in theaters, so the aspect ratio is widescreen. Again, rest assured, that this release has the widescreen version as well, as opposed to being cropped to fit full screen TV monitors. And to make matters better, it's in anamorphic widescreen, meaning that if you've got a widescreen TV, the footage will automatically fit to the size of the screen (as in, without the black bars on the top and bottom of the screen). A much better option than the alternative of setting up your widescreen TV to zoom in to remove the black bars, but keeping the rest of the picture, since that would in turn cut off part of the subs and make the picture slightly fuzzy.

LANGUAGE TRACKS
Upon getting the movie today, I was most worried about the movie only having the dubbed version. Rest assured that there is a subbed Japanese version available. Now, I have close to no knowledge on the Japanese language, but it looks like the only changes made sub-wise were done for the sake of ""American-izing"" it (ie: having the subs read the first name before the last name and excluding suffixes like ""-san"" and ""-chan"") But nothing major.

And for those interested in the dub, based on the one scene I've seen of it, it looks like they've done a good job keeping close to the script and only making some changes for the sake of making the prose flow better and for the mouth movements to match up.

It definitely would have helped if they pointed out that both the dub and sub were available on the box art. Upon buying this, I was completely freaking out about whether this release had both versions or not!

EXTRAS
No way I would have given this release the full five stars if it didn't have at least one legit special feature-- a 10-ish minute short featuring Naruto and most of the other genin. The story's basically about Konohagakure holding a little tournament among the younger ninja. The only problem is that poor ol' Naruto's constipated and is forced to hold it in for the entire tournament.

The short is also available in dub and sub and is in widescreen, so I'm assuming this was played before the actual movie when shown in theaters in Japan (kinda like Pikachu's Vacation playing before the Pokemon movie). My only complaint with this is that unlike the movie itself, this short is NOT anamorphic, so your options to watching the sub while maintaining its aspect ratio (on a widescreen TV) are limited to 4:3 (full screen). Either that or you can have the screen stretch out or zoom in to remove those darn black bars. The problem with zooming in is that this means the subs will also be cut off slightly since well... it's not anamorphic. A slight pain, but still worthy of five stars.

WHY BUY IT?
You may be one of those fans who've downloaded this movie before Viz came around to distribute it here in the US... so you may be asking why you should buy it in the first place? Well, the way I see it, you're basically hurting the well being of the series if you don't! Downloading the episodes while they're available is one thing, but you should show your love for the series by buying the official releases once they're available on DVD. It's also always good to have a hard copy outside of your computer.

In conclusion, ""Naruto The Movie: Ninja Clash in the Land of Show"" is definitely worth the purchase, whether you're a subtitle or an English dub kind of fan. It's everything a fan would expect from the series meshed together into an hour and 35 minute movie.",1189123200,34,5432,4.6107660455486545
2849953,5,B000QXDG7K,I first saw this movie with subtitles a couple years ago after downloading it. I loved the movie then and even more now. I was surprised to find Hidden Leaf Village Grand Sports Festival in the Extras which I had also downloaded but lost shortly after. A short yet funny extra. Not only is this a good movie for the older viewer but for kids as well. It has the action for the older viewers and the comedy that is Naruto for the kiddies. Yes I know theres blood in it but most people I meet have young kids that watch wrestling and horror movies. A must buy though!,1189123200,3,565,4.192660550458716
2849954,5,B000QXDG7K,"I just finished watching this movie having bought it yesterday and I cannot say how amazed I was. I've read other reviews and I agree that it does seem a bit more of an extended episode rather than a stand alone movie of the franchise, but I think it is that exact fact that makes this movie a must see for die hard fans. Naruto, Saske, Sakura - all the ninja carry over from the series exactly as one would expect them to. The music is directly as it would be if one was watching an episode, but this actually helps as it allows the familiar viewer to know what is about to happen - the old naruto theme song lets you know that naruto is about to do exactly what he does best - pull out one of his surprise attacks, completley unexpected, utterly triumphing over those who would oppress and control. This movie is fantastic. Amazing! Incredible! I cannot say how much I loved it. The humor was right on and original. This is a must see for any die-hard naruto fan and even those new to the series.",1189036800,3,998,4.230366492146596
