4838830,5,B005MXQCV6,Very good workout.  Low impact which is what I need.  If I do too much high impact I won't be able to walk on my feet.  It really gets you sweating and your muscles feel like they have been worked.  I use this along with my dance workouts.  I would reccommend this to anyone wanting to get in shape.,1330560000,,299,4.0
4838831,2,B005MXQCV6,"I'm someone that used to be very fit.  I have let that lapse now for so long, that I needed a new beginner workout so I can build up to my former level again.  I bought this (having had a few other Denise workouts) thinking that by now, she'd have improved as an instructor.  I was wrong.  Not only is her cueing pathetic - if existent at all - but the ""choreography"" (and I use that term loosely) is pathetic.  Even for a beginner workout, this whole routine is bits and doesn't flow.  It's hard to get in a rhythm because before you know it, you're moving on to other movements before you've even cottoned on to the previous movements.  It's frustrating to say the least.
Having said that, if you are a beginner (as in someone that has NEVER done an aerobics workout before EVER) then this is your workout.  If you're more experienced, but just unfit now after time away from aerobics, this workout is going to bug you and you'll hate it.  Her bubbly personality can't hide how flawed this really is.",1329868800,14,1002,4.372972972972973
4838832,5,B005MXQCV6,"If you are a beginner or intermediate exerciser you will find this DVD challenging and fun. The Low Impact Workout gets your heart pumping with power walking and simple and fun routines that target the whole body. At the end of the segment you are feeling invigorated and ready to face the day. The Stretch & Tone segment Denise incorporates stretching, ballet, pilates, and yoga.  It is a perfect routine to do at the end of the day.",1329264000,11,434,4.564102564102564
4838833,5,B005MXQCV6,I purchased this dvd after reading other reviews and am glad I did. I'm 48 and have been working out cosistently for about 7 years. When I saw the description was low impact I wanted to check it out. My knees and shoulders can't take the hard pounding of the higher impact workouts and this seems to be working fine. It consists of two workouts. One is a 30 min low impact cardio which involes some dance style moves which make it enjoyable and the other is a 20 min stretch and tone which I think is very important no matter what type if workout you do. Denise is an inspiration for older woman to keep up the hard work and stay fit and healthy!,1329177600,29,646,4.176
4838834,4,B005MXQCV6,Did this workout for the first time and found it a good basic workout.  Time will tell if I see results but will definitely do this workout again.,1327708800,,146,4.214285714285714
4838835,5,B005MXQCV6,These workouts are just what you need if you want to have results quickly. The first improvement for me was not visible but my flexibility and range of motion were improved. That made doing these and all exercises correctly much easier. The outward results came with time and effort just as with any successful program. The two work outs are great together or separate.,1325635200,34,369,4.78125
4838836,4,B005MXQCV6,"This DVD contains 2 workouts for beginners who have been exercising for a while or one may use them on a light exercise day which is what I did.  In both workouts, Denise Austin works with 4 ladies.  No equipment is needed, except maybe a mat for the second workout.

1. Low-Impact Cardio (31 minutes, 36 seconds)
In general, this is a light to moderate workout.  Exercises are non-stop and Ms. Austin moves briskly through a variety of exercises.  The workout includes traditional aerobics, small jumps, balance work, and a few easy Latin steps.

2. Stretch & Tone (20 minutes, 27 seconds)
This workout is divided into standing work and floor work.  Standing work is comfortably paced with stretches and light standing moves.  Then, Ms. Austin moves on to the floor and the exercises become a little bit more intense and faster.

Here are the floor exercises.
Modified push-ups
Mobility work
Low hover
Bridge
Hip swing
Pulses
Ab work
Crunch
Leg lift
Bicycle
Side plank and lift
Cobra
Superman
Reverse plank or bridge with triceps

This ends with a few stretches on the floor.",1323993600,149,1076,4.798913043478261
4838837,4,B005MXQCV6,"I am an intermediate level exerciser in my early 40s.  I thought this might be too easy because it said ""perfect for beginners"".  What a surprise! The cardio workout is low impact but it does get your heart rate up if you put in an honest effort. I even broke into a light sweat. There's walking and some fun dance moves that will take someone klutzy (like me!) a few times through to figure out.  It has been a long time since Denise put out a 30 minute workout that is cardio only.  I really enjoyed it!  The tone section is a pleasant, easy workout for days that you are feeling tired or if you are sore; it is 20 minutes and tones the whole body!",1323993600,95,650,4.126984126984127

4838847,2,B005MXQCV6,"I cannot understand the good reviews for this DVD. I love Denise Austin and her positivity, but that is the only good thing about this workout. The workout has a few mambos, v-steps & other steps, a few yoga poses & not much else. After 50 minutes I still hadn't broken a sweat (and I'm not an advanced exerciser)!  Denise's cues for the next move were also poor (although this has never been her strong suit). I totally wasted my money on this & will give it away. By far, the best DVD of Denise's is an oldy but a goody: Ultimate Fat Burner. It never fails to help me lose weight & tone up.",1459209600,,592,4.147826086956521

4838849,2,B005MXQCV6,I love this workout- good music is important for me to be able to get motivated and it's a great workout- Denise Austin has a way of motivating you and encouraging you to keep going- you feel great about finishing when you get to the end !,1458518400,,239,4.1063829787234045
4838850,4,B005MXQCV6,"This is a very good low impact workout. I have been doing home based DVD workouts for many years. The half hour low impact cardio session is good and you will break a sweat, but it isn't super challenging, which is why I gave it four instead of five stars.  In spite of that, you will get a good workout. I have to be careful as I have had tendinitis in the past, so I can't do high impact and this workout is good for me. If you do the 20 minute stretch and tone workout after the cardio segment, you will get a very good all over workout. The stretch and tone piece has yoga inspired stretches as well as good toning exercises such as push ups. I feel very energized after doing the cardio and the stretch and tone segments. Overall, I recommend this workout and enjoy it every time I do it.",1456531200,,793,4.116129032258065
4838851,5,B005MXQCV6,"Love it! The cardio dance part is easy to follow and very upbeat with ""balance challenges"" so you'll break a sweat by the end. I personally like Denise Austin's bubbly demeanor. She doesn't always perform each move perfectly like a robot, which just adds to her appeal. Working out is supposed to be fun, so ""just do the best you can"" and ""don't forget to breathe!"" Also, the ""stretch and tone"" section hits all the major spots without overworking anything. I will definitely add this workout to my weekly rotation.",1455926400,,515,4.733333333333333

4838854,4,B005MXQCV6,"I personally liked this because it had a better pace for me. It is a beginner workout, but will get the heart rate up. I do this in between my more strenuous workouts, to keep my stamina constant without over doing it.

I will say it can be boring for those who are more into a very fast pace,, which most of the newest one seem to be. This one still gives a workout, without killing yourself.",1443916800,,393,4.103896103896104

4838859,4,B005MXQCV6,"Listening to Denise Austin can be irritating, but she does have great advice.  I especially like, ""zip up your abs"" which she repeats many times to remind you to keep your core strong during these exercises.  This is low impact, but will still get you sweating and working hard.",1432857600,,278,4.653061224489796

4838867,5,B005MXQCV6,Recvd my wrkout dvd today. This is my second copy of this particular wrkout. I cracked my other one from using it so much. Denise is my all time favorite instucter. Her approach leading all the exercises in her programs is much nicer than others. You get a full body wrkout from this one and results are just amazing. Be consistant and self deciplined in your wrkout.  She makes all movements smooth yet you feel the burn. Your body will transform quick.  I don't even eat that well and i stay toned and healthy looking because i am faithful w the wrkout.  I never get bored with Denise s wrkouts. She is fun but wrks your body without you feeling like you are following a drill sargeant.  People ask me if I compete often... I say no I just like to be fit and healthy.  Before Denise I never really enjoyed dvd wrkouts.  FOR ANYONE Who is searching for THAT wrkout you will actually love and look forward to this is it.  Denise has many other dvd s out there I just found the one for me and stick w it.  I add 100 situps after i do this 30 Min. Wrkout and some arm weights 4 sets of 20.  I am 5 ft 2 and 112 lbs.  I have lots of energy after wrking out and you will too.  A MUST BUY THAT WILL NOT COLLECT DUST.  Summer of Houston,1421712000,5,1230,4.058091286307054

4838871,5,B005MXQCV6,"This is a great workout dvd. I've been doing Denise's workouts for free on youtube for awhile and really liked them. After awhile I wanted to start getting some more so I figured I would take a gamble (since you never know with workout dvds till you try it). The first workout is a really fun cardio workout. It'll take some practice to get all the steps down perfectly but as long as you are moving and having fun- that's all that counts. I never feel bad if i miss a step or too because at least I'm trying which is still worth a sweat bead or two. Denise is upbeat and fun to listen to, the dvd also has the option for instruction with Denise or to just workout with the music alone. The second workout is a stretch and toning workout which is a little shorter but still nice. It's more relaxed than the first workout but still nice to get your muscles stretched out. Definitely worth it!",1413936000,,891,4.247058823529412

The moves are pretty low impact, and she keeps it interesting the whole time by changing moves constantly. The warm up and cool down were perfect, she used moves and stretches that are my favorite. On some of her other work outs, she uses awkward movements or squats to warm up. This one will definitely by in my work out rotation for a long time!",1403568000,,467,4.379310344827586

You work up a sweat, but don't feel like a LOSER if you are not super workout woman.  The moves are simple, straightforward, but not crazy repetitive. Again, if you want more of a drill sergeant, directing kind of instructor - her DVDs are not for you.

You could also add hand weights for a more intermediate workout.  I was actually ready to stop when I realized there are different sections of the video.  Wasn't sure I could make it through but I finished and was ""perspiring"" quite a bit by the end.  The next morning I had a good soreness in my abs which always makes me happy after a workout since abs are sometimes ignored in whole body workouts.

If you're a Denise Austin fan, then you should not have any trouble at all with the routines or moves! I also read people complaining that this DVD should not be called low impact, because there is jumping...yet, you could easily modify and the jumping was short lasting.

4838929,5,B005MXQCV6,"This DVD has 2 workouts. One stretch and tone, which is a body-shaper. The other is a low impact cardio.

The low impact cardio is dance inspired. This came as a pleasant surprise, since I normally kill myself just running outside for a half an hour. The moves really do require a lot of energy if you really put effort into them and are fun. There is also a built in warm up and cool down.

Probably not for hard core exercisers, but it says right on it that its for beginners. I also found the moves tough to follow the first time I did it, but they are readily learned by way of repeated viewing. I was just fine by the 2nd/ 3rd viewing.

This DVD really earned its 5 stars for me.  With a sensible diet I lost 20 last year in 3 months using these exercises.  I will definitely be trying some of her other dvds",1390953600,2,813,4.088050314465409

She also repeats the moves enough which allows for more success in completing the routine.  I will probably go back and use this workout routine again.

Prior to my thyroid slowing down, I was in excellent shape with very healthy eating habits.  Hypothyroidism resulted in a weight gain of 40 pounds in just a few months.  I have started working out at home, combining workout DVDs with the Total Gym.  I did the cardio portion of Denise's Shape Up and Shed Pounds workout, which is a low-impact workout labeled ""Perfect for Beginners!""  There is a 3-minute warm up, 26 minutes of not-too-complex cardio, and a 3-minute cool down.  I like that, because the moves are not complex, you can increase or decrease the intensity by modifying your efforts (e.g. bigger hops or stepping instead of hopping).  I worked up a sweat and enjoyed the workout.  I did not do the toning portion of the DVD.",1385942400,,887,4.86

4838949,2,B005MXQCV6,"I was a little iffy about this when I got it after viewing the preview on Collage.com. I found this to be a terrible workout. Denise does not have you stay at a move very long, just 2-4 repetitions. She changed moves right when I was finally catching on. Also, it is more dance oriented than I like. I found myself having to leave out some moves because I either could not do them fast enough or they were awkward for me as a person who struggles with coordination. For example, she does these side steps with stomach twists that I could not do at all, so I just stuck to the side steps. She also did turns that I found hard to do in this workout with the other moves. I had to change some moves to be more user friendly for me. If you like dance and like short bursts of activity you may like this workout. I found it hard to follow.

Denise Austin seems like a very kind person so that is a definite positive about the video and her in general. I have other workouts by Mrs. Austin that I really like. Both are her walking workouts and they are not dance oriented at all.",1384819200,13,1073,4.109523809523809
4838950,2,B005MXQCV6,I guess I am not as coordinated as I thought I was. These seemingly simple choreographed moves frustrated me and instead of enjoying the workout I constantly had to go back and try to get the moves right.

When I saw she had exercise videos available on prime she was my obvious choice. However, I could not follow this workout well. Her instructions were soft spoken and unclear at times. The changes in exercise were to quick. By the time I understood what were doing she was on to the next one.  I am not sure I would use this again because I felt like I wasted my time trying to understand the workout rather than working out.",1382745600,,546,4.300970873786408
4838973,1,B005MXQCV6,"I really enjoy Denise's videos, but this was not good for me. I found it hard to follow and frustrating because she didn't really repeat moves or give enough direction before switching moves to comfortably catch on to the workout. I started the video twice and turned it off after 5 minutes both times because I couldn't pick up the moves. I would not recommend this video, but would strongly recommend her boot camp or quick burn cardio videos instead.",1382227200,11,453,4.675
4838974,3,B005MXQCV6,"This does seem to be an all around workout and is fairly well done. In addition to cardio, Denise takes viewers through movements that are designed to stretch, work, and sculpt various parts of the body.  Some moves also work on balance.  I only have three issues with the routine.  I believe that every cardio DVD should pause maybe midway and right before the cool down to allow participants to take their pulses in order to make sure they are not overworking or underworking.  The DVD also includes a few sections that incorporate hops in which both feet leave the ground.  A low impact routine keeps one foot on the floor at all times.  Both feet never leave the floor at the same time. This makes the DVD partially high impact, which may be problematic for some participants, especially if you must exercise on cement. I was able to do my own low impact moves in these sections, but it would have been more beneficial I did not have to adapt and if the entire routine could have been authentically low impact. The last issue I have likely won't impact many people. Denise does incorporate quite a few dance moves.  I never took dance lessons, even as a child.  And I was a wall flower much of the time. So I was lost and felt inadequate trying to mimic these moves.  Other than that, this is a decent DVD.
I do have three favorite low impact workout that I prefer. Listed in the order of preference, they are:
Shape Up with Mary Hart
Basic Training with Ada: Low Impact & Strength Training Workout
Gilad: The 60 & 30 Minute Low Impact Workouts (The 60 minute gives you about 22 minutes of cardio)
My only deep wish with the Mary Hart VHS is that the producers would create a DVD version.  It would be much easier to chose my workout from a menu than it is trying to fast forward or rewind to find my beginning location. But I absolutely love Shape Up with Mary Hart.",1381881600,4,1871,4.397101449275362

4838989,3,B005MXQCV6,"I gave this 3 stars because the title is misleading.  This is sold as a weight loss, low-impact workout for beginners.  There is no one in the video who even remotely has weight to lose, so there is no one you can look to to model modifications to some of the more challenging movements.  I am a 50 year old with significant weight to lose and arthritis issues.  I cannot jump up and down, balance on one foot while bending over, etc... I hope to get to where I can do those things, but I can't yet.  Combine this with the awful cuing of Denise the annoying hyperactive elf, and  it was nearly impossible to follow.  She never tells you ahead of time what move you are going to change to before she changes, and then she only does about 2 or 3 reps before changing again (unless of course she says ""a couple more"" in which case she does at least 5 more!).  She does a poor job of explaining correct body position for each move and the camera work constantly cuts off the feet so you can't even verify the move visually. The workout itself might be fun for the more intermediate exerciser or a beginner who only has a little weight to lose, but it is definitely not for anyone starting a weight-loss regimen with serious weight to lose.

Denise hasn't changed over the years, she's still you biggest cheerleader, which I love. I don't enjoy boot camp style instructors. If you're looking for someone who screams at you, look elsewhere.
