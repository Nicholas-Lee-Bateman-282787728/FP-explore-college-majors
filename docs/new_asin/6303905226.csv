I honestly think this comedy could have had a very long run with many successful seasons on TV. Jim Carrey was brilliant, wild and creative in this role  as he is in every role on screen.",1498694400,,277,4.0181818181818185
7854400,4,6303905226,"Jim Carrey in rare form.  Buy these final episodes of ""the duck factory"" and you won't be dissapointed.  Jim Carrey was full of energy and never lacking in a witty comment.  Recommended to me by a friend, John Swindell, this movie truely shows where Jim Carrey got his start.  It's no wonder why he has become such a big star.",977443200,3,326,4.383333333333334
