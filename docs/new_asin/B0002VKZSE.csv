The story has a lot of the same elements as the 1960's live action version. Super Atragon II fills in most of the blanks that volume I  left open although many feel on the whole there's too much action and not enough character development. While this isn't hard science fiction it does have some valid science and if accepted as an update to the 60's release it's enjoyable as action SciFi. Just don't epect something of ""Planetes's"" caliber. Super Atragon II is released by ADV films.",1205712000,,591,4.628571428571429
8033327,2,B0002VKZSE,"If you're into sci-fi drama, I wouldn't recommend this dvd.  I bought this thinking maybe it'll be a good addition to my Robotech, Macross, and Yamato sets.  The story is really unfinished, too many loop holes in it, and the science is probably more art than science.

They really don't go deep into the characters and how the enemy nor the main characters got into this battle or war.  For some reason, I am believing that they ran out of budget and never finished this movie.  If you're looking for a good sci-fi, then don't buy this DVD.  Actually don't buy this DVD period.  I watched it once, and never touched it since.",1102896000,3,625,4.477876106194691
