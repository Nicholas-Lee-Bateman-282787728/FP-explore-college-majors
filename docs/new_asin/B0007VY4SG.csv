8052402,3,B0007VY4SG,"I bought this double sided, 2 DVD pack because I read about Slipstream in IMDB and thought it sounded cool. In short both films are badly produced with semi bad acting.

Abraxas is a ""futuristic"" terminator ripoff, with a very badly aged Jesse Ventura, that is difficult to watch full of references to movies that were much better. I really hated it, in fact I ended up putting a label for Slipstream on this side of the disc.

Slipstream is about twice as good as the film on the other side of the disc,I mean how can you go wrong with mark Hamil? I recognized most of the main characters as actors from other B-Movies. Although the production was lacking and some of the acting and storyline was hard to stomach, I truly enjoyed this film. It had an original storyline and the characters were fleshed out enough for me to care about what happened to them. It is set in the future where global warming has messed up the air currents around the world. all the major cities were blown away and people use small air gliders to traverse this more desolate earth. Two bounty hunters fight over an incredibly important bounty, both trying to collect their fee.

If you are interested in Slipstream this dvd is a cheap way to get your hands on it. If you loose any desire for films after watching Abarxas don't say I didn't warn you.",1305590400,,1327,4.4526748971193415
