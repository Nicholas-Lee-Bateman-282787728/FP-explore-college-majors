8411189,1,6300128636,"Okay, I got this video because Jon Pertwee, Doctor Who #3, was listed as a star, not realizing that it was really a 70's style red-light movie.  His total air-time must have been all of 4 minutes.  The rest of the time was a bumbling stupid sex-comedy that was not amusing, too crude and graphic, and very boring.  Its like a sleeze version of a Carry-On movie.
The plot was that a famous super-detective, Jon Pertwee, goes on vacation, and his goofball office assistant pretends to be him when a rich female client shows up needing help.  Several sexapades later, Jon Pertwee comes back, saves the day, and the movie is over.  The assistant looks like a member of the group The Monkees, and the females are neither comical, cute, or ""interesting"".
Jon Pertwee fans STAY AWAY!",1235088000,4,776,4.635036496350365
