4246736,5,B0041W56GG,"I purchased this item for my son who is 12 years old. He is a major Hot Wheels fanatic. From the moment it arrived he has watched it nearly everyday! He was lamenting over the fact that he really missed being able to watch Battle Force Five on Cartoon Network on Saturday mornings. Now, he can watch it whenever he pleases. I truly enjoyed the series myself, so it's been a blast being able to watch all of the amazing action of the series again. It is a series that is imaginative, funny and action packed from beginning to end. It is a definite must for any Hot Wheels buff young or old!",1347148800,,589,4.221238938053097
4246737,5,B0041W56GG,My cd came in no time it was exactly what I was looking for. It was for me and my oldest grandson and we love sitting and watching it,1338163200,,133,3.6206896551724137
4246738,5,B0041W56GG,"Great season now that I don't get all the commercials interrupting the action. the story lines flow, and yet hold together on their own.

So when is season 2 coming out?",1314057600,,169,4.451612903225806
4246739,5,B0041W56GG,My 5 yr old son and I love this show...lots of action without being too violent...good morals on team work and self sacrifice and very creative and cool storylines and cars.  Very cool show...we have the whole first season now and we've watched it multiple times.,1298678400,,263,4.717391304347826

4246741,5,B0041W56GG,My son loves this Hot Wheels Battle Force 5 series! Wish they had more out on DVD and put more episodes onto one DVD as 4 isn't enough. But it's a great concept for young kids and so much fun!,1292716800,,192,3.825
4246742,5,B0041W56GG,The dvd was okay. I didn't enjoy quite as much as the original Hot Wheels movies. My son still enjoys all the car action tho.,1291420800,,125,4.04
4246743,4,B0041W56GG,"This cartoon is one of my kid's favorite so I bought Vol 1& 2 here because it's hard to find it in other stores.
After playing Vol 2, I notice that if you go selecting chapter by chapter, the final chapter has no sound at all.
You need to select ""play all episodes"" so now the final episode has excellent audio, quite strange but true.
After all, I'm very happy to have these DVD's.
My kid loves them.",1285632000,,401,4.153846153846154
4246744,5,B0041W56GG,"Battle Force 5 is my favorite show!  I like the exciting things that they do.  There is good personality in Vert (and all the characters).

This DVD has all my favorite episodes (Double Down, Behind Enemy Lines).  In 'Double Down,' Battle Force 5 is copied, like the exact opposite, and the evil Vert secretly steals the key from BF5. 'Behind Enemy Lines' is the first episode that is in the Vandal home world.  This BF5 disc doesn't have any extras, just so you know.  (We are hoping for a full season release with extras - very soon!!!)  This disc is very good quality.

(Mom's notes:  my son discovered BF5 through a Hot Wheels Happy Meal toy.  When he went on the Hot Wheels website he saw the Battle Force 5 and was hooked in right away by the exciting, cool videos of fast paced action and cars and humor.  He was so excited he wanted his parents to see it too!  As I have been watching it with him, I have been drawn in by the simple, but interesting plots driven (haha) by well defined, interesting characters.  The show is exciting, funny, clean and encouraging - there is always some challenge for the characters and they learn and grow from it.)

We hope that you get this and enjoy it too! :)",1278288000,2,1204,4.364864864864865

4246749,4,B0041W56GG,"My kid would not stop talking about wanting this series on DVD.  When we got it for him he watched it non-stop for about 3 days.  For the price, its good entertainment for a few days.",1367625600,,183,4.055555555555555
4246750,5,B0041W56GG,In the same format as Battle Force 5. Not too intense for my 5-year old to sit and watch. Runtime is a little long and movie is certainly Dated based on graphics/animation quality but the kids love it and thought nothing of the older format.,1364774400,,241,4.377777777777778

8413201,5,B0041W56GG,"My five year old son is a Hot Wheels fanatic!  Really, he loves all things Hot Wheels; he even had me buy him the Hot Wheels Ultimate Handbook,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hot-Wheels-the-Ultimate-Handbook-Fun-Facts-Stats-More-All-About-150-Cars/dp/0545491843/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hot Wheels : the Ultimate Handbook , Fun Facts, Stats & More All About 150 Cars</a>, which I am often forced to read to him as a bedtime story!  So boring for me, but he loves it.  LOL  In any event, when I found this series I immediately thought it might be something that he would like, but I worried that maybe he'd be a little too young for it...he was only four at the time.  However, all my worries were in vain; he LOVES it.  I initially purchased the first episode on Amazon Instant Video for him to try it, and when I saw how much he loved the show--he watched it like six times back to back that first time--I quickly purchased the DVDs for the complete first and second seasons.

The shows are action packed with high speed car racing and good guys, ""The Battle Force Five"" fighting against evil monsters who are trying to wreak havoc on the universe.  The graphics are fantastic and the sound quality excellent.  My son really enjoys these shows, as does his seven year old sister.  Even my husband likes watching them...me too, but shhh that's our little secret!  LOL  My only quibble is that the last episode on this disc, while it has excellent picture, it does not have any sound, so you can see it perfectly, you just can't hear anything!!  I even exchanged the disc twice thinking it was a fluke, but alas that was not the case!  In any event, this DVD is great, but it doesn't get five stars because of that one defect.",1428019200,,1771,4.899328859060403
