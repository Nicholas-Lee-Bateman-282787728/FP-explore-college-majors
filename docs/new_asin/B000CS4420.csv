8101453,5,B000CS4420,"This is one of the best spaghetti westerns after those made by Sergio Leone (The Dollar Trilogy and Once Upon a Time in the West).
Do you like James Bond? Well then you'll enjoy Sartana. When director Parolini was brought on board to help rewrite the script and incorporated elements that was influenced by the British Spy franchise.
Sartana has many appearances: an insurance agent, a scarecrow, and a rattlesnake. But he's really your first class pallbearer. And when a coffin full of gold is up for brags, and Mexican bandits, bounty hunters, and corrupted politicians get in on the game altogether... I'm sure you know where this will head in your typical spaghetti western.",1441411200,,678,4.904347826086957
8101454,5,B000CS4420,"This is a good drama about a super hero, Sartana, who appears in other films. Sartana is a very thin, handsome bearded man, dressed as in most Spaghetti Westerns in an unusual coat and usually wears his hat almost touching his eyebrows. He is very quick in drawing his gun, which does not look like other guns, and usually never misses. He is a kind of angel of mercy, coming to help the needy. In this film, he comes to help solve many stage coach robberies where, curiously, the robbers are murdered during the holdup by someone who shoots them from a far distance. Spaghetti Westerns can be fun to watch. The Clint Eastwood versions in my opinion are the best. This one does not compare with it, but is still very good. The pictures were a little grainy, but still fine.

 People unfamiliar with the genre of Spaghetti Westerns will find that many, but not all, have lots of bearded men wearing long coats or blankets with the hero smoking a small cigar. The villains laugh a lot. The voice and mouth movements are usually not in sink. They have the customary western plots and actions, but sometimes add a twist. For example, the stage coach holdup men seem to always make the mistake of not confronting the coach directly, but letting it pass them by and then chasing it like keystone cops shooting and being shot; something they could have avoided if they came right out and confronted the coach immediately instead of chasing after it. There is lots of double crossing in Spaghetti Westerns and many villains have blond hair. There are also many beautiful women in these films who are bad, but not entirely so as well as men made to look ugly and vicious.",1386201600,2,1662,4.555183946488294
8101455,2,B000CS4420,Meh...Obvious Clint Eastwood ripoff - second rate spaghetti western. Plot? Box of rocks. Cheesy sound effects. Couldn't get through it...,1372723200,,137,5.9
8101456,2,B000CS4420,Like an old spaghetti western but not as good. I couldn't make it all the way through the movie. I thought by the date that it was going to be a modern western.,1371427200,,160,3.878787878787879
8101457,5,B000CS4420,"Okay, first off, the video quality is not great, but its a Italian Western so that is often expected.  Also, I read lots of complaints on Amazon about the voice dubbing so here is a little help on that score.  Almost ALL Spaghetti Westerns (Italian Westerns) were shot silent and dubbed into all languages (even Italian).  They will always have the look of a strangely dubbed movie; its just the way it is.

Now about this actual film.  I think its a GREAT example of the genre with one the classic Spaghetti Western characters (Sartana) and one of the classic actors (Gianni Garko).  The plot is very convoluted so pay close attention to the betrayals as it matters.  I have seen the movie several times and I still have to pay attention.

There is lots of Spaghetti Western gun play and great Italian death scene over acting.  Just fantastic.

The cast list is a whos-who of classic Spaghetti Western actors:
Gianni Garko
William Berger
Klaus Kinski
Fernando Sancho
Sydney Chaplin
Gianni Rizzo

Finally, please, for the love of all that is sacred and holy, don't take this movie too seriously.  Its just a fun romp that is an great example of the amazing burst of creativity that was Spaghetti Westerns of the 1960s.

Enjoy!

PS: If you hate westerns or dubbed movies, don't watch it!",1354838400,5,1286,4.657777777777778

8101459,4,B000CS4420,"This spaghetti delivers all the goods of the classic Italian western, a good but difficult plot, lot's of gunplay and violence, good acting from John Garko, and his rival William Berger, good direction from genre director Frank Kramer, director of Sabata, the reason why the two films are similar, almost the same plot, both actors carry a derringer but Sabata being the better movie with Lee Van Cleef...Sartana has a descent video transfer, 16x9 widescreen, good but limited music score and an interview with John Garko, Sartana is a classic shoot'em up spaghetti western in the tradition of Django, also starring genre regular Klaus Kinski.",1213056000,4,643,5.133333333333334
8101460,1,B000CS4420,"I am a Spaghetti Western fan. Because of this I decided to purchase a number of rather rare films on DVD by Wild East Entertainment. One of films was ""If You Meet Sartana Pray for Your Death.""

The first DVD I recieved was the Lee Van Cleef classic Day of Anget. It had some major problems. I ordered the disc BRAND NEW from amazon directly and the disc contained many DEEP scratches, fingerprint smudges, and the center of the disc was even cracked. I sent the disc back to get a replacement. The second disc I recieved was also scratched badly. I'm not sure who is in charge of making these Wild Eest Entertainment discs but holy hell, give me a break! For brand new discs they look and play like a an ex-rental that had been used as a frisbee. I sent the disc back for a second time because the film skipped. The third disc I recieved...what a surprise...was also really scratched. Enough is enough! How many times do I have to send a disc back in order to get a disc that is in LIKE NEW condition and plays fine!

That was only the first problem I had with a Wild East disc. I also ordered the DVDs Sartana and Gentleman Killer. I will say up front that I have a normal television (not some fancy widescreen TV) and a normal high quality Sony DVD player. When I played either one of those DVDs...the image come up scruntched on my TV. It's not like I have a widescreen TV playing non-anamorphic discs. I have a normal everyday TV. I emailed Wild East Entertainment about the problem and they eventually responded that it was a manufacturing defect on their part and the person has to switch their DVD player manually to 16x9 to play properly on their TV. Sadly I was unable to do this on my DVD player and the company offered my money back if I sent back the discs along with my amazon receipt. I sent the DVD to them. It's been months and I have not recieved any refund and they refuse to email me back. They took my DVDs and never sent me a refund and refuse to answer my letters and emails. I have NEVER been treated so poorly and they basically robbed me of $40.

The ""Matalo!"" DVD also has some extremely poor encoding but I assume I warned potential buyers enough about ""Wild East Entertainment"". I respect the work they are trying to do by releasing hard to find Spaghetti Westerns but they need to shape up or ship out. Releasing defective discs that are poorly manufactured (like the Day of Anger disc) is upsetting. Their customer service promising refunds that never arrive and ignoring emails and letters is childish. It's a shame because I bought a LOT of their DVD's but the defective discs and their customer service giving false promises ensures that I will NEVER buy another one of their products again.",1175299200,5,2724,4.400793650793651
