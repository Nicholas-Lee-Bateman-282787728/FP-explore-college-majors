681694,5,6303548830,"There are choices to be made in your life. This movie is comical and has nice eye candy, but it makes you reflect on the choices you made in your life.  I enjoyed this movie.",1124236800,4,174,3.9714285714285715
681695,3,6303548830,"The film opens with answering machine messages from guys breaking off dates with Jamie (Marguerite Moreau), underscoring Jamie's main problem: the love 'em and leave 'em guys she gravitates toward. When a seemingly promising relationship with John (Naveen Andrews) ends, she vows to get to know the next guy before taking off her clothes, as she says, and begins 90 days of celibacy. During those 90 days, she meets Mick (Brian F. O'Byrne) and actually does get to know him.

Jamie's first meeting with John is full of the nervousness most of us can relate to as we build up the courage to go talk to a guy we find attractive. She promises herself and her sister that she won't sleep with him but she does anyway, justifying it with the familiar sentiment that she was afraid of losing him. She and John share some tender and awkward moments, until he tells her his ex has returned. It's terrible to watch her cry in front of him, and Naveen Andrews conveys regret convincingly just as he conveyed tenderness in his role in the film ""The English Patient"".

While swearing off men and cigarettes, she goes to her acupuncturist neighbor (D.B. Woodside) who is so handsome and sweet to her I wish he'd had a more dynamic role in the movie. She meets Mick who's also getting treated, and they begin a friendship laced with growing attraction. When John attempts to win Jamie back, she struggles with the hurt he caused and her new feelings for Mick. Jamie seemed to really want to be with John while she hesitates with Mick, making it hard for us to take sides and cheer for one guy or the other. I want her to do what's best for her, but it's hard to discern if she's choosing one over the other or just reacting and bouncing off each one into the other. But the film conveys the confusion of being in the middle of this kind of situation and it does not lay on any heavy moralizing about it. The plot has the usual misunderstandings that cause arguments between the lovers, and the camera stays with these unpleasant moments, giving the film a satisfying realism many romantic comedies stay away from. The subplots support the main theme of love and trust.

Wonderful, evocative, and heartfelt music by Grant Lee Phillips sets the mood and creates smooth transitions between scenes and shifts in the story. The light seems washed out in a few scenes, and the film has the feel of an indie picture, almost a documentary at times, as if we are visiting Jamie in her apartment as she goes through her struggles. The camera work echoes how adrift Jamie is in the world, unanchored and easily blown about by changes until she begins to get a grip on herself.

Jamie's hair and apartment are always a mess, and she personifies the pain of the search for the right guy, the roller coaster of hope, excitement, disappointment and the crying. I thought the subplot with the sister took a nasty turn, but the characters just accept it and move on. I wanted them to fight it out like the siblings did in the film ""She's the One"". There's an odd scene of Jamie encountering a woman who wants to jump off the building because her husband left her; the scene feels a bit like a device for the plot. It touches on Jamie's loss of her mother which is revisited later but not fully. It shows us just a hint of her relationship with her father that leaves us wanting to know more. At the end of the film, Mick provides an endearing shift in the meaning of the movie's title.",1123372800,10,3454,4.503987240829346
681696,2,6303548830,"Marquirite Moreau (Queen Of The Damned) is the main character in this movie about love and other things. Moreau falls in love with poetry man, played by the always great Naveen Andrews (Tv's LOST, Kama Sutra: The Tale Of Love) and they start to hit it off but then he leaves her. So, she recoils from him, in which he still loves her but he doesnt care. So she goes after her friend who has his own show, played by Brian F. O'Bryne and the two of them start to become more. Andrews starts to see Moreau's sister, played by Emily Deschanel (sister of actress Zoey Deschanel) behind her back and yada, yada...we get it. There's one long sex scene between Moreau and O'Bryne which just...ok, I won't say more. The awesome D.B. Woodside (TV's 24, TV's Buffy The Vampire Slayer) has a small part as Moreau's shrink friend. Moreau is sweet and cute but the movie is just too hollow and I didn't care for it that much. Naveen Andrews is good though and so is Brian F. O'Bryne. My advice is just watch it once and if watching it a second time, for me, it wouldnt be like the first time.",1115769600,5,1078,4.315270935960591
681697,4,6303548830,"Marguerite Moreau has the most winning smile I've seen on any actress. I rented ""Runaway Jury"" again just to watch Marguerite Moreau's part in it. She deserves better parts now that she has shown what she can do.

The plot stays interesting with twists that are plausible. Although you think everything will be fine in the end, there are many times when that ending is in doubt. I wasn't sure who would end up where and at points wondered if it was a comedy. The sex scenes are the most natural I have seen - not contrived, they fit in.

I'll see it again, after I get ""Off the Lip"".",1112745600,5,583,4.290909090909091
681698,4,6303548830,"This is a delightful romantic comedy with a very engaging main actress (Marguerite Moreau). After spending years as a ""jerk magnet"", she is about to quit the dating scene when lo and behold, two decent guys with real potential come along. Like they say, ""it never rains but it pours"". She is then faced with the opposite problem of deciding which guy would be the better choice. While watching it, I didn't really know how things would turn out because both guys she was into were actually quite likeable. Fortunately everything ends happily. Well it is a romantic comedy. :)

I thought customers might want to know the specs for this DVD seeing as Amazon has continued its bad habit of omitting tech specs from newer releases. The DVD is by Screen Media Films. It is in it's original aspect ratio of 1.85.1 (enhanced for widescreen TV). Colors are accurate. There is quite a bit of film grain but not too distracting. My only quibble with the presentation is that black levels are closer to a dull grey so that the transfer lacks a sense of depth and richness. Soundwise it's in 2.0 and 5.1 surround with pretty decent sound reproduction. There are no close captions or subtitles contrary to what it says on the backcover and on Amazon.

All in all a very enjoyable movie. Definitely worth a viewing.",1112486400,108,1301,4.6521739130434785
681699,5,6303548830,I have used this tape recently and in the past to get back into shape so I can make the next step into real tapes which have an upbeat and quick pace.

681953,4,6303548830,"This is a puzzling film; that's why I don't give it a five.  The plots (there are several) sre tangled because the lives of the characters are tangled threads of love, jealousy, longing, searching and sex, sex, sex.  Marguerite Moreau is a young adult, daughter of a youngish mother Emily Deschanel. An example of these adult tangles is when mother and daughter are both sexually involved (almost daily at times) with a ""foreign looking"" charmer.  Later mother is involved with other men when her husband is off with other women in this odd community.
I'm a ""Bones"" fan of Emily Deschanelshe can ""do no wrong"" in my eyesso there's a secret delight in watching her go very wrong in ""Easy""!  And, in an odd ending, there is a christening party everyone goes to with love and forgiveness all round!  Would that I had been there! ALAN N. HALL",1406332800,,838,4.635135135135135

If you think about though, she does a pretty good job of showing a women who wants to change her life and how some supposed friends stab you in the back.  all comes out good in the end.

682077,2,6303548830,"There's really not much to this movie.  There's no comedy, no action, no suspense, no thrills of any kind.  Some women may find a little bit of drama in it, I'm not really sure.  I'm a guy, so it's definately not for me.  What's advertised on the cover, you get very little of in the film.  The girl pictured on the cover hardly reflects the one in the film, so if you are going based on that, then be prepared to be disappointed, just a fair warning.  And if you are looking for any sexual content, then look elsewhere.  There's really not much at all. A very lame film for men, but it MIGHT be ok for women, I've sat through much better chick flicks though, forcibly at that.  Two stars, probably only deserved one.  But I don't hate it.  I just don't like it.",1316304000,,762,4.1931034482758625
682078,2,6303548830,"So basically I can sum this flick up in one word, manipulation. Instead of being 'jerks' these two guys are tugging at this girls heartstrings playing the other side of the 'jerk' mentality. Giving her what she wants, using her desires against her to get her with themselves. As far as I can tell she isn't doing any better with the two guys trying to get in her pants. The only difference is these guys are desperate enough to stay!

The movie isn't what I would call a romantic or a comedy, it's more depressing really and drags on and on with pointless directions that really don't add much to the story at all. I'm not sure why the movie had to go the additional mile after she decided who she wanted to be with.",1311897600,,716,4.303703703703704
682079,4,6303548830,"I'm one who likes a good romance,so I wasn't real sure where this movie would fit in. To my surprise It was a great romance movie in a round about way. It was also a good movie about discovering who other people really are not just their facade; as it was also a good movie in discovering who you really are. It got a little slow in one spot but pulled out in time so you weren't disinterested.",1300492800,,394,4.064102564102564
682140,3,6303548830,Not a great film by any means. The star is attractive but wasted on this story.,1280534400,2,79,4.0
682141,1,6303548830,"The low budget mediocre acting is somewhat forgivable, but I can't look past the over the top plot and emotional psychosis of the main character. What should have been a quirky romantic comedy turned into an incestuous love fest where everyone is sleeping with everyone else. Not only is it a cliche and tired plot, but far from anything remotely realistic. Furthermore the main character is painful to even watch as she traipses through life being ""easy"" as it were because she's an emotional vampire. In the end we question whether she can be happy with any of the characters, much less the man she ends up with, because she can't ever be happy on her own.

None of these characters are exactly role models nor do any of them actually make for an interesting movie. Save your time and money on this one due to its sheer lack of originality.",1280361600,15,842,4.576158940397351
682142,5,6303548830,"I fell in love with this movie after seeing it on an indie movie cable channel,

682143,4,6303548830,"I have been a fan of Marguerite Moreau since The Mighty Ducks movies.  Her career path is much more interesting than the career paths of the other Disney child stars; I especially loved her performances in ""Queen of the Damned"" and ""Firestarter 2""; and the reason that I wanted to watch ""Easy"" is to see Marguerite Moreau's rendering of the lead character, Jamie.

The movie is a lot of fun, and Marguerite is very endearing in this film.

The only question that I have is about the ending.  It comes across, I believe, as a happy ending.  But with the track record of Marguerite's character (Jamie), you have to wonder ""how long will it last?""

I would very much like to see a sequel to this film, and to find out what happens to the characters 10 years later.",1276128000,,761,4.438848920863309
682144,5,6303548830,"When I bought this movie, I was under the assumption that it would be a decent movie that would at the least be interesting enough to hold my attention for around 90 minutes, but I was pleasantly surprised at the substance within the movie and how real the acting felt.

This was positively one of the most well-acted films I have ever seen. All of the supporting cast were great, especially John and Mick. However, the main character absolutely stole the show and really draws the audience in to feel her happiness and pain.

I am sure that everyone has seen plenty of movies, in their time, that attempt to depict relationships in today's world, and they all fall woefully short of the truth. Most movies attempt to show as much nudity as possible and hold back the emotion; while this movie has some nudity, it is effectively done with Moreau being in the moment, either showing her affection or love for the character she is with. Easy was able to pull off ""classy"" nudity on camera, however ""classy"" nudity may be able to be. I did not feel at any point that it was overdone, nor was the acting overdone.

Moreau feels like a friend that everybody has and everybody knows that just wants to be happy, but is confused as to how to arrive at that happiness. Easy depicts her journey to happiness and does a phenomenal job of doing so. I whole-heartedly recommend this film to anybody that wants to see an entertaining, true-to-life film that actually ""keeps it real.""",1236211200,4,1470,4.581749049429658

682146,2,6303548830,"I generally enjoy quirky little independent films about modern relationships, but Easy is an exception. It seems to have been marketed as a romantic comedy and, to be fair, there a few nicely comic moments along the way. Unfortunately, the amusing bits would not make up an episode of a tv sitcom. Most of the film is a fairly predictable soap opera with moderately explicit sex scenes which seem to suggest that woman on top is the new missionary position.

The leading character is pleasant enough. Her offbeat nature is underlined by her ridiculous job - the sort that only people in movies have. The composition of the rest of the cast screams political correctness and everyone seems to love everybody else regardless of race, creed, or lack of attractiveness. The problem is that I found it difficult to care about any of them. The rather forced emotions of the script made involvement with them impossible. By the time the happy ending is reached, I found myself thinking: ""You could have done that an hour ago."" Possibly, some of the problem is mine - I suspect I am not part of the film's target audience. Even so, Easy is nothing special and offers nothing new. It's all been done before and done much better.",1214611200,49,1219,4.696261682242991
