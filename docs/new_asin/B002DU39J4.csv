3912793,1,B002DU39J4,"The novel on which the movie is based was the first Nora Roberts book I read.  What fascinated me about it was the writer's ability to create vividly a small Alaska town in mid-winter, when it is dark for all or most of the day and snow lies piled deep.  The plot was OK, a newly-hired cop meets an abrasive female bush pilot and gets mixed up in an old murder in the nearby mountains.  The characters were a trifle shallow, but the ambience made up for the slack.

Now comes the movie, wherein the producers chose to ignore Ms Roberts well crafted atmosphere.  The town isn't right.  There's not nearly enough snow.  And, worst, on New Year's Eve the sun is high overhead in the afternoon.  Did they think that readers of the book and intelligent viewers wouldn't notice?

In addition, the actors were completely unconvincing, particularly Ms Rimes, who is a country singer out of her milieu.  I was reminded of an anecdote regarding Dolly Parton in her movie acting debut.  A frustrated director stopped a scene and asked Parton, ""Can't you act at all?""  ""No,"" she answered, ""and your job is to make it look as if I can.""  In that case, the director succeeded, but the director of Ms Rimes failed completely.

In short, the movie is a slapdash failure, not worth the time of anyone who enjoyed the book, and a time waster for those who didn't.",1253059200,13,1345,4.5041322314049586

3912795,4,B002DU39J4,"This was cute, and the rustic scenery was what attracted me to it when it originally showed on Lifetime(?).  That, and LeAnn Rimes, who was attractive in this film. And as everyone now knows, this movie was the basis for the breakup of the marriages of both main actors.  What you need to know before buying the movie is the acting quality and direction is variable throughout. There are many instances where it seems more like a soap opera than a movie, perhaps because it's a made for TV movie, but it didn't have to be that way.  At any rate, it's a good, but not great movie.  I'll watch it every Christmas season along with other favorites at that time of year.",1486771200,,666,4.390243902439025

The story is lost, the depth of character if lost.  There is no sophistication, no humor, no drama.  And who casts the actors for these?  That person should be run out of town on a rail!  Books can never quite become a movie as written, we all know that, but when half of the book is left out, what's the point?  Northern Lights is one of the top 3 Roberts favorites of mine (in book format) and I thought it might be fun to watch the movie version - must be the fever keeping me home from work today.  Should have minded the reviews that said to save my money.  And why did they change the character names and still call it ""Nora Roberts' Northern Lights""?

Watching the tv-movie in and of itself was only mildly irritating due to the obvious ripoff factors from NX, but it became more than mildly irritating when Lifetime ran some promotional interview clips with Nora Roberts in which she quite smugly congratulated herself for coming up with such an ""offbeat mix of colorful characters.""

My god, woman, you ripped the whole thing off from top to bottom. The least you could do would be to at least act a little modest about it, say it was ""fun to write"" or some such nondescript baloney, instead of congratulating yourself for the ""creative inspiration"" to rip off every character in the freaking story.",1403913600,,1322,5.282296650717703

3912877,4,B002DU39J4,"I don't much read Nora Roberts, so I can't speak to the faithfulness of this made-for-TV adaptation to its source material. What I know is that even though Northern Lights is fairly by-the-numbers, it still held my attention. Partly, it's the curiosity factor. I wanted to see how well LeAnn Rimes can transition to acting. She does fine.

It's a 2009 Lifetime Channel movie that taps into a familiar premise: that of a newcomer to Alaska falling for a spirited bush pilot. It's not as successful in channeling Northern Exposure's appealing central staple, which is its quirkiness. Northern Lights introduces burnt-out ex-Baltimore homicide detective Nate Burns (Eddie Cibrian), come to the fictional town of Lunacy, Alaska to outrun pangs of guilt and remorse. Nate has had enough of big city crime. As Lunacy's new police chief, he's looking forward to negotiating the more sedatechallenges posed by a remote, sleepy town. And to add even more incentive, Nate catches a glimpse of local bush pilot Meg Galligan (Rimes) and is instantly beguiled. They formally meet on New Year's Eve, an auspicious date that is not at all flushed with romance.

But here's that clich rearing its ugly  head, the one about small towns, big secrets. Nate hasn't even had time to settle in before he turns up a 15-year-old murder, one that holds special ties to his favorite bush pilot. It takes a minute to worm oneself into the good graces of a closed-in community like Lunacy's. Ingratiation is specially hampered when one starts digging up nasty secrets. Can the new police chief hold down his job long enough to solve a murder or two? Certain citizens are grumbling about the decision to hire an outsider like Nate. After all, Lunacy's window of tourism doesn't extend past summer. Who needs an all-seasons police chief, and an outsider at that?

LeAnn Rimes and Eddie Cibrian happen to be married in real life, and there's a bit of that synergy captured on camera, a certain comfort level. Cibrian, with his affability and his exasperating matinee idol looks, is likable. But I tuned in for LeAnn Rimes, and it seems to me that she lights up the screen. Rimes infuses spunk and vitality into her character. Meg Galligan is someone who asserts herself and who is comfortable in her own skin. In one scene, she even saves the new police chief's bacon. Chalk that one up to a lesson learned about the vagaries of moose meat bait.

Northern Lights is a rote murder mystery, made all the more routine by our sleuth's underwhelming ""eureka"" moment. How Nate arrives at the killer's identity smacks of dipping into that barrel of standard TV mystery investigative tropes.

Thank goodness the potential for a Cibrian-Rosanna Arquette romance was nipped in the bud early on. In light of Arquette's character's relationship with Rimes, that would've been pretty icky. Still, it's nice to see such a well-preserved Rosanna Arquette. She plays the promiscuous innkeeper (with a, yes, heart of gold).

I love the gruff-looking dog. What breed is he? Seems like a mix of American bulldog and awesome.

Mt. No Name is a cool name for a mountain.

With an aggressive name like Deputy Otto Gruber, I expected him to be more prominent in the film. After a while he just fades into the background. Bit disappointing. I wanted him and his new boss to clash more.

3.5 out of 5 stars for this one. The showdown with the murderer goes down ridiculously. Nate actually made a solid call in his strategy for catching the guy. Too bad other folks took the play out of his hand. But it's one more thing that cheapens the movie. The fictional town of Lunacy was founded in 1805, much like the mystery elements here. If you watch this and end up enjoying it, I've no doubt it's because of what LeAnn Rimes brings to the table. I hear she can sing, too.",1397952000,,3812,4.770864946889226

In the book, Charlene tries to get Nate into bed several times and Nate doesn't meet Meg when he first gets to town as the movie showed.  Mag also thought her mom had bedded Nate so she kept her distance.  Also there  was a screwed up part in the movie where they said they gloves belonged to Ed (the banker) when in the book, Bing reported his gloves and knife stolen from his truck when he turned the fishing pole in at the police department after he said he found it.  There were several very funny parts in the book about the two brothers and the messes they got into that would have made the movie better but none of the detail was there.  It was a hack job of the book. The acting was ok but they could have added more scenery of the area as that is very detailed in the book which made you want to see that area..

Burns quit his previous job after his partner was shot and killed, and Burns feels responsible. The two most eligible females in Lunacy, Charleen Galligan (Rosanna Arquette) and her daughter Meg (LeAnne Rimes), are both romantically interested in him. Charleen's husband disappeared a decade earlier and the family assumed he'd just upped and left. But now two young climbers find his body with an ice-pick in his chest, so the search is on for his killer. Several of the townsfolk are resentful at Burns because they thought someone from the town should have got the job, not an outsider. Now, although the state police want to take over the case, Burns insists on handling it because he believes the killer is still in town. When the editor of the local newspaper is also killed, Burns is convinced his theory is right, though the townsfolk are happy to call it a suicide. There are twists and turns in the story, and it's quite an exciting thriller.",1366156800,7,1118,4.7979274611398965

I did appreciate the supporting actors, though. Leann is a great actress and Eddie can hold his own, but this movie just didn't have the romance I was looking for.

I think that this was her first movie, but I am not certain about that.  If it is her first movie she hit a real home run with her initial performance.

Even the setting of the movie was all in daylight and in that part of Alaska, that time of year you get about 4 hours of daylight. I was disappointed with the movie. Some of the events and characters that were in the book, and made the story more suspenseful were removed. I am shocked that Nora Roberts allowed that much alteration to the story.

This movie is truly terrible- the performance of Nate is wooden and he lacks any type of leadership for someone who is supposed to be Chief of Police--and he is the star of the movie after all.  The movie was superficial and lacked any truly intimate feeling for the town and the characters who lived there.

3912918,1,B002DU39J4,"I'm a bit behind the times, but I just read the book and then had to see how the movie was done.  Most reviewers thought it was great... I couldn't disagree more.  How can I begin?  Meg was supposed to be raven haired with blue eyes and a very hard nut to crack.  Ms Rimes was totally wrong for the part, and it was played like she was a guidance counselor.  She needed to be dark haired and private, thus Jacob's spirit child.  The part of Burke was played like a lost schoolboy until a bit in the end.  In the book he's all business and very much a professional which is what the Lunacy folks were not used to.  In the book he was haunted, but tough and no-nonsense at this job.  The bad guy ""Darth"" was supposed to be 'tough, lean, gray haired crewcut with a scar over his eye'...  this bad guy looked like a pudgy pedophile.  Charlene and Meg DON'T get along -- this was played way too mother-daughter (the scene where they spread his ashes was just hurl-worthy).  I understand movies can't be exactly like the books, but when the characters aren't believable, well it's just a waste.

I also read first then watched Carolina Moon...  that actually was a bit closer to the book, although I thought they spent way too much time showcasing the ladies' stomachs (which were yes, beautiful and flat and young), but a half an inch down on some of those pants there wouldn't be anything left to the imagination.",1303171200,3,1409,4.369230769230769

It is. of course, an adaptation and, unless you are prepared for a 12 hour minisweries, it is always impossible to crowd an entire novel into a movie. Moving from book to movie means picking out what is best suited to the screen, and a necessary element in the plot, and discarding anything else.  That was done well here.  The main characters were well portrayed, even giving allowance for the fact that the female lead has not spent most of her professional carreer as an actress.
