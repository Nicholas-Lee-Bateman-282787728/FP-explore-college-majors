It is fun to learn more about the world, and it makes you dream about a time when you'll have the time and money to travel.

Michael Palin does a great job all the way through this serie.",1119398400,3,307,3.78125

529688,5,6302994500,Absolutely love Michael Palin's travel videos - have 4 of them now - beautiful photography/video plus his unique sense of humor and interaction with local people.,1418256000,,162,5.269230769230769
529689,5,6302994500,"I highly recommend this DVD to anybody thinking about buying it.

Michael Palin in 1989 decided to chronicle a journey Around the World in 80 days - as Phileas Fogg did in the 19th century Joules Verne novel - without using air travel. He travels through Europe, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, India, Hong Kong, Japan, the US and then back to London during the journey, retracing the path taken by the Jules Verne character. The series shows how much the world had changed in the 100 years since the novel was written - in the days of the early steam ships - in 1989 the biggest struggle was to find a ship to sail in. I specially like the segment that covers the journey after India and before it reaches the US. I however, recommend you watch the entire series. If you weren't around, you can get a glimpse of the World as it used to be in 1989.

I first watched this BBC documentary about 20 years ago - when I used to have access to the BBC. I have never forgotten the great BBC documentaries. I have since craved for the British sense of adventure when setting out to explore the world. It reminded me of the time when I used to still have a romantic view of the planet, when the it had not yet been invaded by the Americans, and before the Arabs had taken to chopping heads in the Middle east.

Buy this DVD just to enjoy that very romantic British sense of adventure.",1417564800,,1364,4.27906976744186

529694,5,6302994500,"I had the pleasure of watching this on PBS in the early 90s, and was amazed to find it on DVD! The first of Palin's well-documented treks across the globe, this series started it all, and remains in my mind the best of them.  Well worth it!",1398729600,,240,4.1063829787234045

529696,5,6302994500,"I first encountered this series at our public library.  I had never heard that Michael Palin (whom I have been a fan of since 1974) made a trip copying Jules Verne, and so thought it might be worth a look.  I found myself unable to tear myself from the screen as his style of presentation was so conversational and intimate I felt as if he were recounting the voyage strictly for my benefit.  I have since collected all of his travel programs and have enjoyed them all, but ""Around the World"" remains my favorite.  I highly recommend this program for anyone with even a hint of a spirit of adventure.  It is inspirational and a reminder of just how large, and also how very small, is our beautiful world.",1384819200,,704,4.426356589147287

529749,5,6302994500,"So I watched this when I was in college (yeah I am old), and the Leda Maersk stuck with me all this time.  As I was setting out on my own ""Around the World"" journey, what better time to hunt down a copy and enjoy Michael Palin.  His adventures and the people he meets still ring true more than two decades later,  I only wonder how his trip would have changed had he had a smart phone or even a cell phone.",1369785600,,406,3.926829268292683
529750,5,6302994500,I have travel to alot of these place and this just shows me how small the world really is.  How life for some cultures has never changed and that people are good deep inside and welcome travelers from all over.,1363651200,,210,4.25

529752,5,6302994500,"It is good. I have got four of these Palin travelogues now. I love them all. It starts off richly enough, but you can imagine that when you get to the Pacific Ocean heading for California and America it might get a little slow. My other complaint is that rather short thrift is given to America in an effort to beat the deadline and get back to the start point there in London. It is a cool idea to try and stick to the ""80 Days"" - but the story suffers a bit adhering to this requirement. I don't think audiences would've been that upset! But you do find yourself rooting for them to make it. Quite an adventure. You should go too!",1357516800,,632,4.146341463414634
529753,5,6302994500,"This is superb, but if you've only seen this and ""Pole to Pole"", (which was the case with me), you're in for an even bigger treat if you spring for the entire series in ""The Michael Palin Collection"". The whole thing is amazing, and the visuals, sound, (and technique overall) just get better and better throughout the two decades worth of journey! The only small bit I wasn't crazy about (except for the second part where Michael continues his journey through Britain, several years later) was ""The Great Railway Journey"", but all of the rest- spectacular!
Since prices go up and down for the individual sets, as well as ""The Michael Palin Collection"" (all the travel series in one set), get out your calculator and do the math. In most instances the big box set will save you money- especially when it's on sale.",1285545600,2,814,4.659722222222222
529754,5,6302994500,"I have enjoyed all of Micheal Palin's journeys. This was the best because he was new at intrepid travel and so he brought along all of his British angst and trepidation. In later series, he was much more comfortable in the most extreme of surroundings, which made it harder for the ""typical"" traveler to relate. All the series are great, but this will always be the best.",1246579200,,371,4.552238805970149
529755,5,6302994500,"I watched this years ago on PBS, so I was curious to see if the DVD lived up to the fond memories I had of Palin's adventure. It certainly did, and more. I have since purchased and viewed Palin's New Europe series, and while I found that to be interesting it doesn't compare with Around the World. The reason? In addition to giving us a glimpse of some fascinating people and places, Palin is in a race against the clock, which gives the whole journey an edgy feel. The host's marvelous sense of humor is tested on several occasions, as he and the film crew overcome a series of obstacles. It all makes for highly entertaining viewing. I especially enjoyed the final episode, when Palin arrives home in England to a rather dispiriting welcome from his countrymen.",1238544000,2,763,4.576642335766423
529756,5,6302994500,"This is one of my favorite TV documentaries of all time. Palin is great and although I enjoy the others, like Pole to Pole. This has got to be his best.

Every 2-3 years I pull this box set out and watch. I must have seen this whole season at least 5 or 6 times since it was first on TV in 1990.",1234742400,,295,3.6825396825396823
529807,5,6302994500,"I watched these videos while stationed in Europe in the late 80's and have always wanted to buy them, but for many years could not find them.  This DVD set is timeless and we have introduced our children to Michael Palin...they love him! We will be buying all Palin's travel DVD.  Although the videos are not ""educational"", our children could not help but learn and be inspired by Palin's witty, humorous style.  These DVD's are first rate.  They are a great way to introduce children to the many wonderful places in the world.  Oh yea, adults will love them, too.",1222473600,4,564,4.6
529808,5,6302994500,"The DVD was excellent.  Previously I purchased a VHS tape version which unfortunately contained only HALF the series episodes.  The DVD, however, was complete.",1216598400,,159,5.583333333333333
529809,2,6302994500,"This such a disappointment compared to Palen's other series.  Here  he spends a long, long, long time at sea, and the days pass in tedium. For this series, air travel was forbidden, so it followed that the journey had to be via boat. And therein lies the problem. There's only so much one can do on a low budget ocean voyage.  Somewhere in mid-ocean everything begins to lose its savor, if  ever it had any, and then the story gets even worse.  Once back on land, the journey disintegrates into a long, long, long train ride across the U.S. This is where Michael spends a lot of time chatting with people who maybe just want to be on camera.  One storyteller, a conductor, gets into the act by recounting a not very funny (and quite apocryphal) tale about a fat lady who got stuck in the toilet.  And was it my imagination, or does he have more than a little contempt for most Americans... he could hardly have portrayed them in a less favorable light. Sahara, New Europe, and Pole to Pole are terrific travelogues, but this one is a dead end trip.",1210809600,4,1048,4.398963730569948
529810,5,6302994500,"Around the World marks the beginning of Palin's prolific new career as travel host.  He is less confident than in some of the later series, but he has an infectious energy that really comes through.  Some of the passages overland and on the sea are fascinating looks at anachronistic modes of travel.  Palin is maybe the best travel host ever to appear on the tele.  He is funny, yet always respectful and always smiling (so important when traveling).  His voice over narration is just perfect.  Only criticism is that this series is a bit dated - the video quality ain't so great and the places he visits have changed enough since then that it feels slightly irrelevant - but that's only a relative criticism.

Update:  After watching 80 Days countless times over the past 2 years, I can now say this is one of my favorite travel series of all time.  It is a one-of-a-kind and I never tire of it.  Love the nervous energy of it.",1205539200,2,929,4.508982035928144
529811,5,6302994500,"I watched this mini-series almost 2 decades ago when it was aired on
BBC. Today I own the DVD. The world has changed a lot since Palin's
journey, especially China and India. Some of Palin's comments do not
reflect modern times. But his adventures will always be relevant
regardless of time.

I more than agree to all the appreciation this series has received from
the reviewers here. My only criticism is Palin gives undue importance to
the traces of british legacy that he observes in the great cultures of
Egypt, India and Hong Kong. But his down-to-earth attitude and sense of
humor more than make up for his nostalgia about british empire.

The challenges faced by Michael Palin are different from those faced by
Phileas Fogg, but it makes a gripping journey. Overall great concept,
great presentation and excellent background score.",1200787200,2,837,4.929078014184397
529812,4,6302994500,"Michael Palin follows Jules Verne's Fillias Fogg around the world and by the end, you get the feeling you really know Palin. The journey is mesmerizing, funny, interesting and you feel like you're with him every step of the way. The Dhow episode is worth the price. . .At least I think so.
It's a long series and can be daunting if you try to watch them all the way through. You really have to WATCH to enjoy.",1200096000,2,409,4.256410256410256
529813,5,6302994500,"This was one of the most enjoyable ""national geographic"" type documentaries that I have ever watched. I am not really into geography. I am not even an armchair explorer who likes to read or watch on subjects concerning new places or unexplored territory. But this was both funny and enjoyable. First of all, the format itself was interesting.. attempting to replicate a fictional journey of a bygone era made the entire subject come alive. The commentary felt ""unrehearsed"" and this gave the series an air of genuineness. There can be no better way for kids to learn about far off lands and places than Around the World in 80 Days. Kudos to Michael Palin.",1194652800,,655,4.754385964912281
529814,5,6302994500,"Michael Palin really found his calling in playing the slightly adventurous Englishman willing to roam the world for the BBC. With equal parts wonder and humor, he's a rare mix. In this first outing, the story is all about time. The deadline forces him to really race and struggle and imparts a drama that is largely missing from later excursions. His instant fondness for anything pleasant, no matter how un-English, is wonderful. The rather sour ending is unfortunate (In America, he is told an apocryphal story about a train toilet and, in England, is rejected by ordinary folks and the exclusive club at the heart of the adventure), but is handled so well that it is part of what makes this travelog great.",1193011200,2,709,4.772357723577236
529815,5,6302994500,"I saw this progam when it aired in 88, and it has only got better, Micheal's exploits and humour makes this show something for the whole family to enjoy.",1187136000,,153,4.310344827586207

529828,5,6302994500,"Its so very cool to sit back for a bit, hear Michael Palin's wry humor as he attempts to make the trip in 80 days. My family loved it when we were kids in the 90's and now its a nostolgia trip for me and starting my own family. This  is a unique series and totally worthwhile, and even thought provoking as he visits different cultures and makes commentary. Especially haunting is the visit to China right before Tianamen(sp) Square in 1989. You will enjoy this series if you love to see the world from your armchair!",1179705600,3,517,4.329896907216495
529829,5,6302994500,"I like travelling, but normally I don't like travel programs. They're boring and sensible, and although the surroundings are beautiful, they don't deliver anything you couldn't have looked up in a Lonely PLanet guide.

But not this one. Ex-Python turned globetrotter and British national treasure Michael Palin delivers a thoroughly entertaining, funny, untraditional and quite exciting travel program with, what would become his first of many great travel programs, ""Around the World in 80 Days"", in which he tries to recreate Phileas Fogg's journey around the world in Jules Vernes classic novel. No planes allowed, only boats and land transportation.

Not only is (was) it a new and more exciting way to create a travel program, but Palin, with his great sense of humour and his happy go lucky sort of approach to the task before him, is one of the best television presenters ever. He really grabs your attention and makes you interested in the places he goes to. He has indeed made the entire UK sit and watch his travels to places they had never heard of before week after week.

I have never spoken to anybody who, after seeing Palin's travels, did not feel invigorated and full of lust for adventure. It did certainly rekindle my love of trains and boats watching ""Around the World in 80 Days"". Now I travel by train instead of plane whenever I can.

I have watched the series some 4 or 5 times over the years now, and it never gets boring. They are the benchmark of travel programming. Highest possble recommendation.",1179014400,24,1525,4.831417624521073

529831,5,6302994500,"I have been waiting for years for this to come out on DVD. The book was a joy to read & can't wait to see the DVDs! I was extremely lucky a few years back to be in the audience for Saturday Night Live & heard a rumor days before that Michael Palin & John Cleese would be on the show that very night. I took a copy of Michael's ""Around the World in 80 Days""

hoping the rumor to be true & it was. Palin & Cleese opened the show & later did the famous Dead Parrot sketch. After the show I waited outside in the cold & out came Michael Palin & John Cleese! Michael signed the book & wrote ""Happy Travels"" & I also asked John if he would sign & he did & wrote ""Rubbish!"". It was a great night & can't wait to enjoy the DVD's.

529832,5,6302994500,"Tragically, it is not easy to get access to BBC shows in the USA. There are some truly great series, for example all the travel series done by Michael Palin (some more amazing than others, but all very good). You might recognize him from his days as a star in Monty Python or from the film ""A Fish Called Wanda."" Part of what makes him a great travel series host is that he retains his humor while exploring extremely fascinating parts of the globe. His series are very balanced, informative, and entertaining all at the same time.

 The most refreshing thing about his series is that they are not presented as ""look at all these great touristic places I have been,"" but rather the camera is more of a silent witness to his adventures. It really just follows him as he sets out to do his carefully researched itineraries (""Around the World in 80 Days,"" ""Pole to Pole,"" ""Full Circle,"" ""Sahara,"" ""Himalaya"") or themes (""Hemingway Adventure,"" ""Palin's New Europe""). His style is both objective and subjective. Whilst retaining a journalistic like objectivity he also lets you know how he subjectively feels about the places he visits and about how he personally feels in regards to his personal health both physically and psychologically: he shares his apprehensions, feelings of triumph or defeat, relief or disparity, amazement and disappointments, mourning or elation or even neutrality, sickness and homesickness or feelings of health; in other words, his style is to bring the richness of a written travelogue to film. You get the feeling that you are watching his diary; for example, when he does his post trip/editing room voice-overs and other commentary, he adds his comments from it.

 You see him get altitude sickness in the Himalayas (""Himalaya""), and you see him participate in a bizarre yet hilarious crossing-the-international-date-line ritual performed by the ship crew on his way from Japan to the USA (in ""Around the World in 80 Days."") Moreover, the trips have quite large budgets so there really is no limit to what kind of itinerary he can dream up. In ""Around the World in 80 Days"" he set out to literally circumnavigate the globe, but not just in a ship, he uses any means of ground transportation he can find, which includes joining ship barges. The one stipulation is no air transportation. In other series his itineraries are equally as grand: in ""Full Circle"" he makes a trip around the Pacific Rim and has the unique privilege of hiring a helicopter to see some difficult to get to parts of far eastern Russia and after, true to Palin style, learns Russian drinking songs from the pilot while drinking vodka with him; in ""Pole to Pole"" he takes the only commercial plane that flies from South America to the South Pole, a ticket that is prohibitively expensive for your average traveller.

It was very easy for me to get addicted to Michael Palin's series and I had the fortune of living in China where bootlegs of anything are easy to come by when I did. In the USA, his shows are difficult to come by. I know that the complete box set of all the series he has done so far (he has at least one or two more left in him) is sold at a bargain price in the UK. But for people living in the USA who cannot stand the fact that those DVDs are (probably) regioned to the effect that they will not even work on our DVD players here even when legitimately purchased and imported to the USA, perhaps the best alternative is to turn to the internet (cough, torrents, cough).",1173830400,5,3489,4.675895765472313

Palin's has an excellent homey style to his narration and always expresses in his looks and words much of what the audience is thinking about the situations he finds himeself in.  The pacing is excellent and one quickly finds oneself truely involved and wondering will he make it on time.  This is a fun travelcade which sweeps you around the world in great scenes which makes you want to revisit many of them.  This was the first in a series of adventures which hopefully will all be released soon such as ""From Pole to Pole.""  At this time you can view ""Sahara""  his adventures in Africa to get a feel for the style that this soon to be released series manifests.

We also discover the joys of simple travel, simple pleasures, everyday people from faraway lands, and such important lessons as how to remove a snake's gall bladder and - my favorite bit - the manly way to iron laundry.  Yes, on top of being provided with a fascinating window to other cultures, we are awarded the constant presence of the wittiest, most charming and most informative travel guide ever to grace a TV screen.  I love all of Palin's travel adventures but this - his first - is still in my book, the very best.
