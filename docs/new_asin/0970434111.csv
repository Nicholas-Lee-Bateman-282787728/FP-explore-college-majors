7794186,5,0970434111,"I have admired Casals all my life and am grateful to have this wonderful film biography. I recommend it whole-heartedly; but with the caveat that it is clearly a second generation copy...either of an original DVD (?) or (more likely) a VHS tape. The DVD begins with a copy pattern and has no extras; but (as I said) I am grateful to have it as it is. It would be wonderful if a major company would reissue it with the ususal bonuses of additional interviews, etc. But don't miss the opportunity of grabbing this copy while it's available. Casals was one of the three great spokesmen for peace in the previous century. We just lost Mandela. Only Pete Seeger remains. Buy it and share it.",1390003200,,686,4.496

""An intimate biography of Pablo Casals life and work and his dedication toward world peace told in his own words.  A film by Academy Award winner Robert Snyder.

""In 1936, when [Casals] silenced his cello and baton, he went into self-imposed exile in Prades, French Catalonia.  His silence served as a moral protest against not only the Franco government, but against all fascist governments.  But the world would not accept his silence, and on the occasion of the Bach bicentennial in 1950, he was persuaded to conduct an orchestra on his own turf, the Prades Festival.  And later, the Puerto Rico Casals Festival, after he moved to Puerto Rico.  Finally, as the composer of his peace oratorio, El Pessebre, in his last years, he mounted a personal peace crusade, conducting his work in some 50 major cities throughout the world.""

An 84-minute biography.  Robert Snyder's last film, A Cry For Peace offers an in-depth look at Casals' life from birth to death and through his incomparable career as a great musician who resolved early in life to dedicate himself and his work to the cause of world peace.

A Master & Masterworks film. DVD.",1288656000,6,1168,4.824120603015075
