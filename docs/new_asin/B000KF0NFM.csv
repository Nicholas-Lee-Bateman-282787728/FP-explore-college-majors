8156101,4,B000KF0NFM,I kind of really liked this movie even though it was a bit quirky.  The movie is funny and warm in a round about way.  Seeing mafiosa in all their glory in Scotland was interesting.  The actors were all good but I did have a hard time accepting the leading lady in this part.  The leading lady was in the Harry Potter movies and was a bad witch.  So seeing her in a good guy part was a bit hard and she really didn't fit in as the love interest for the leading man but in the end it all seemed to come together.,1360281600,3,511,3.875
8156102,4,B000KF0NFM,"Two New Jersey Italian-Americans come out on top of a shoot out with some Ukrainian mafia types. The Ukrainian mobsters are out for revenge. Our two Americans (Danny Nucci and Dan Hedaya) decide to leave the country and hide in Scotland with an honest cousin they have never seen before. Roberto (Gerald Lepkowski) is the boring Scottish cousin who runs a restaurant and ice cream parlor. Alice (Shirley Henderson) also works there, complaining about her dull life and dull Scotsmen. Roberto loves Alice but has been too shy to say anything. Now with his American cousin Gino in town, Roberto finds himself in competition with the new guy who is dashing, out going, and well hung.

Meanwhile the Ukrainian mafia has put a contract out on our two American cousins while a group of local thugs shake down Roberto's establishment. The film has an indie quality to it in that it combines action-crime, drama, romance, and comedy into a production and swaps up at will. Shirley Henderson was remarkably good.

F-bomb, rear nudity (Danny Nucci), no sex. Solid 4 stars.",1335744000,2,1062,4.894444444444445
8156103,4,B000KF0NFM,The accents were a bit hard to understand but the relationships and screenplay were stellar- one of my new fav flicks,1187049600,2,117,4.619047619047619
8156104,3,B000KF0NFM,"The good ensemble casting and the unlikely Scottish locale make this dark comedy better than it ought to be.  As with the ""Sopranos"" mobsters are portrayed as lovable goombas where cold blooded murder and larceny are just all in a days work.  A subplot love triangle between the two cousins and a native Scottish girl is sublimely worked into the story and supplies some touching moments.  Vincent Pastore of ""Sopranos"" fame, bit part is cast as a N.Y. mob boss, obviously for box office draw. His appearance in the film is all but 3 minutes.  Ofcourse the crediblity of the film is exstinguished by the need for a hoaky, sappy, ""Everyone lives happy ever after"" ending.  Overall, its' worth a view, with some minor violence and language that the ladies will be willing to endure.",1181865600,,780,4.7481481481481485
