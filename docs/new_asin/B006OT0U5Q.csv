5011229,5,B006OT0U5Q,"It's about time this classic series recieved a proper release!  I was just a kid when Lancelot Link Secret Chimp origially aired, and never missed an episode! I loved it then and never forgot this show! It's as funny now as it was then.
 I preordered this set as soon as i saw it announced and couldn't wait to see it again. All episodes are present along with a great bonus disc. I started watching the shows as soon as i recieved it, and just finshed watching the entire set! Hats off for a great job, and for an intesting bonus disc!
 HIGHLY RECOMMEND! GREAT SHOW!!! Television will never be the same!",1338595200,8,604,4.375
5011230,5,B006OT0U5Q,"Just in case the other reviews are unclear: reviewers who mention an incomplete, two-disk set with barely-acceptable video and audio transfer are talking about an unofficial release from 2006.  The current edition was released in 2012: it contains every episode, three DVDs, a superior transfer from the original ABC archive masters, is officially sanctioned by one of the show's producers, and includes several bonus features.  So don't be put off -- if you're ordering the three-disc set, you're okay.

I adored this show as a child, and my fondness for it hasn't diminished one bit.  Essentially, it's ""Get Smart"" with chimpanzees as the cast, which makes it the most bizarre spy-spoof ever.  All the sets and props were constructed at 3/4 scale, and costumes were all custom made, so you have this constant nagging sense of disbelief that any sane television producer would spend the time and money (it was the most expensive children's TV program of its time) to do all this in the service of such DUMB storylines, LAME jokes and SILLY parodies, but thank goodness for insane television producers!  The overall effect is a funny, fully-realized fantasy world where apes rule instead of humans and where one well-meaning but incredibly stupid secret agent is our last, best hope against the forces of evil.

A portion of the proceeds of this edition go toward the Wildlife Waystation, a non-profit animal sanctuary in Los Angeles, where Tonga (the chimp who played Lance) is still alive and happy.",1338336000,43,1501,5.028225806451613
5011231,5,B006OT0U5Q,"I wanted to write an early review for the NEW Lancelot Link Secret Chimp 17 episode Complete Series set coming in May 2012. There are so many bad reviews here for the unofficial release, that I had to post something. I own the unofficial release and it has gone from $20 to $200, which I think needs to come down now that the official release will be out soon. I found a product preview ad from Film Chest Inc. on Youtube and I have to say that it looks amazing. All of the complete 17 episodes have been restored from the original ABC masters and they look incredible. The set will include the documentary film ""I created Lancelot Link"", which came out in 1998, which I purchased,  on VHS. It never found it's way to DVD and now it's going to be included in this set. The video in the preview looks so clear that it seems as if it were made yesterday. The DVD also contains a visit to see the Lancelot link, alive and well, at the Wildlife Way Station. I can't wait until it arrives in May

  If you would like to see the advertisement from Film Chest, just search on Youtube for ""Lancelot link film chest"" It is worth watching and you will not be disappointed.

  I have already purchased my copy from Amazon and I can't wait....",1333065600,21,1231,4.280172413793103

5011247,5,B006OT0U5Q,"Perfect picture quality and sound, better than when originally shown in the 70's. These classic episodes are funny for adults and kids without the worry of the filth that seems so predominant in today's comedy arena. I would recommend if you're looking for clean and silly comedy with a special place in your heart for chimps. If nothing else, you'll be left asking just how did they train this group of chimps so well. It's a clean and innocent flashback from being a 70's kid.",1465257600,,478,4.635294117647059

5011249,5,B006OT0U5Q,"I bought this since I loved the series. Nobody would actually buy this if they never saw the series, would they?
Monkeys are funny.
Chimps are actually not monkeys...
Great apes include chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, bonobos and humans. There are several differences between great apes and monkeys. Great apes don't have tails, while most monkeys do. Apes generally have larger bodies and bigger brains than monkeys.
However, this show is hilarious, since it's a goof on the SPY CRAZY of the 60's ... set off by Bond, James Bond.
And Get Smart. And in the case of Lancelot Link... The Man from Uncle.
I suppose the episodes might be on YouTube. If so, and you don't know, check it out. The show is really amazingly well done, and now, I guess, in this day of declining chimp and ape population in the wild (DUE TO THE CRAZY APE, HUMANS) ... this kinda show will never be done again.",1461369600,,886,4.613924050632911

5011253,5,B006OT0U5Q,"I already owned the other Lancelot Link DVD produced by Image Entertainment, and this one is far superior. The older Image edition has only 13 episodes- one of which is incomplete- from very beat up masters. In contrast, this one has 17 episodes from intact masters. It was a very happy moment for me when I put this one on for the first time and saw how much better it looks. In addition, a card contained in the package claims a portion of the proceeds go to support the wildlife refuge where (as of 2012) the venerable star of the show still lives, so it's a completely guilt-free purchase. My only complaint is it doesn't seem to be available on Blu-Ray.",1455148800,,658,4.446280991735537

5011270,5,B006OT0U5Q,"""LANCELOT LINK,SECRET CHIMP"" was quite a departure from the average Saturday morning cartoon fare! debuting on ABC's Saturday Morning line-up in Fall 1970,this live action satire,played by Real Chimpanzees,was both cute and witty,but despite its sincere intentions,""LANCELOT LINK"" just wasn't strong enough,especially since Saturday Morning Television in Fall 1970 was dominated by CBS,who had just debuted ""JOSIE AND THE PUSSYCATS""
and ""SABRINA AND THE GROOVY GOOLIES"",,the second season of ""SCOOBY-DOO,WHERE ARE YOU"",and ""ARCHIE'S FUNHOUSE"",plus ""THE HARLEM GLOBETROTTERS""-ABC and NBC just didn't have a strong Saturday morning line-up,,but that didn't exclude ""LANCELOT LINK's"" growing
success,as it ran on ABC until 1972,with its first and only TV season (1970-71) the company,SBM Productions,were actually quite a talented group of
producers,,and who better to supervise the training of these simians,then the great Frank Inn,known for his work on ""BENJI"",and CBS's ""THE BEVERLY
HILLBILLIES"" and ""PETTICOAT JUNCTION"",to say anything about the vocal talents of Joan Gerber,Bernie Kopell,and veteran actor Malachi Throne,may he rest in peace,which helped the series greatly! but of course,watching this ABC series in 1970 was also unusual,considering that 20th Century Fox's ""BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES"" was a huge box office success-so seeing Chimps starring in their 1st ever Saturday morning series was certainly a first! in the decades that have passed,""LANCELOT LINK"" has become a very big hit in vintage TV,since it was one of a kind! i'm
going to take a wild guess,that former Warner Bros. animator Chuck Jones likely had a hand in bringing this Saturday morning show to ABC,since he was in charge of Children's programing from 1967 to 1973. and by an incredible coincidence,many of the ""LANCELOT LINK"" people also worked on another ABC Saturday morning TV series called ""CURIOSITY SHOP"" for Fall 1971,which included Pat Shields,who was the director of both of these vintage early 70s kid shows! the Bottomline-""LANCELOT LINK,SECRET CHIMP"" is a true and original TV classic,that is worth both the money for serious DVD collectors,and for lovers of simple,creative,and pure Family entertainment,which will truly be enjoyed for generations to follow!",1423958400,3,2262,5.695266272189349

I remember seeing these episodes when I was a child, but couldn't remember what any of them were or could say what the plots were.  This DVD set has ALL of the episodes, along with the Chimpies and the music videos but The Evolution Revolution Band.  Great, silly fun!  Think:  Get Smart done with chimps.  It's no surprise that's what it seems like since two of the writers of the show also wrote for Get Smart.",1419811200,,476,4.3522727272727275
5011276,5,B006OT0U5Q,"Somewhere in this collection you'll hear a line that will have you laughing for weeks. It's great to revisit this nutty show after so long. The colorful international roster of villains all seem to have something funny to say, while hero Lance is a stiff in comparison and Mata Hairy is just plain annoying with that whiney monkey voice of hers. My favorites were/are droning Creto (""Yah, Herr Baronnnnnnn"") and the charismatic Ali Assa Seen (when he jumped on his horse with a hearty ""Onward, my ship of the desert!"" I lost it and busted out laughing as my wife and brother-in-law watched me in amusement). Adults and older siblings will get the most out of this kiddy show, while younger viewers will just be confused (which is funny also).

Isn't it strange how our minds were wired when we were little? It is the dumbest show ever made!  Sky King was wonderful compared to this.  However, my memories are still very fond.  Shared it with some of the grandkids and they were in hysterics!  I am truly happy kids ARE. wired differently than us big people!  I think I am falling in love with Lance, again.

As a satire of the tv show at the time, ""Get Smart"", you cant beat it.  Great for adults and kids.  Oh yes, make sure you get the 3 disc version vice the 2 disc version.

It had only a 17 episode run for 1970-72.
All 17 episodes (from the original ABC masters) are on this great 3-disc dvd set from Film Chest.
The first two discs contain the 17 episodes (disc 1 has episodes 1-9, and disc 2 has 10-17), the third disc is packed with great extras/special features (interviews/documantaries/etc)
Highly recommnded!",1366588800,4,527,4.921348314606742

5011311,5,B006OT0U5Q,"I remember this show from my childhood. It was a spoof of the spy genre in which all the roles were played by chimpanzees. It was silly then, and it's silly now. And I still love it.",1358726400,,182,3.945945945945946
5011312,5,B006OT0U5Q,"Whether you remember this as a child or if you're just curious about a spy show where all the actors are chimps, you gotta get this set!  We recently watched with a crowd that was ages 3 to 61 -  everybody loved it!  It's cleverly written and believe it or not, well acted too!  Guaranteed a good time for all !!!",1358380800,,313,4.081967213114754
5011313,5,B006OT0U5Q,"Given the premise of taking chimpanzees, dressing them up, and having them ""act"" out scripts that are like junior Man From Uncle episodes seems almost crazy today, and would be done in exceedingly poor animation, but this is a bit of history... and it works!

I have fond memories of watching Lancelot, Mata Hari and Commander Darwin back when I was in high school. Like many things I was a little nervous about how things might hold up in reality vs. memory, but I can still say that I enjoy these shows.

Cheesy? You bet!

Silly? Make mine a double!

Anyone over about 50 should have a great time watching these (in small doses) and kids of today from about 3-8 ought to have a really fun time with them.",1357171200,,706,4.407692307692308
5011314,5,B006OT0U5Q,"Weird and psychedelic world full of chimps, good and evil. Apparently this series was one they gave the Navy in the late 1970s/early 1980s for their sailors to watch while out at sea.",1357084800,,183,4.575757575757576
5011315,5,B006OT0U5Q,good quality. Very enjoyable and brings you back to a era where fun was part of life on a reguler basis,1356566400,,103,3.9523809523809526
5011316,5,B006OT0U5Q,"I was 10 years old and my brother 8 when we used to watch this show with jaws agape at how they were able to get these chimpanzees to act so convincingly.  The Dragon Lady, Baron von Butcher, the evil chauffeur Creto and Ali Assa Seen are all as vivid and entertaining as ever - and Mata Hairi is just as charming and Lance is just as clueless.  As an adult, you don't even have to retain a child's ability to suspend disbelief to thoroughly enjoy these silly plots such as C.H.U.M.P.'s theft of the $3 Million Dollar ""Star of Karachi Diamond"" or A.P.E.'s round-up of ""chicken rustlers.""  The shows contain the same sort of ""swinging 60's/70's"" cultural cues as the Austin Powers series - only the Lancelot Link production is an ""authentic"" translation of the times as they were experienced contemporaneously.
  This 3-DVD set is well-produced and the transfer to digital format is clean and crisp.  This series could be run on cable TV and would be a hit with youngsters (just as ""Archer"" is a hit for mature audiences).  The clueless secret agent never ceases to bring smiles to folks young and old.
  I bought two sets for Christmas:  one for myself and one for my 8 and 10-year old nephews.  I may order another set for my 50-year old brother for his birthday in a few months.  I know he'll love it for all the good childhood memories, too!
  From a pure entertainment standpoint, Lancelot Link has stood the test of time better than has another series from the same period:  H.R. PufNStuf.  No matter my age, I have always enjoyed kid's fare:  from the Transformers to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to the Power Rangers.  Lancelot Link Secret Chimp is unique and wonderful - and comes highly recommended.
  If you've got a sense of humor and appreciate well-produced, creative (and silly) children's programming, you won't regret buying this set.  Enjoy!",1356220800,2,1862,4.685185185185185
5011317,5,B006OT0U5Q,"If you have fond memories of the series like me, the quality of this is perfect and the price is a small one to pay to relive a part of your childhood Saturday mornings. It's 100% complete (unlike the older, unauthorized 2006 set), plus some extras on the 3rd DVD.

BEST OF ALL, a portion of the proceeds helps Lance, who deserves to live in a comfortable and worry-free retirement.",1356134400,,382,4.457142857142857
5011318,5,B006OT0U5Q,"I think this could be a spoof of the live action (non-chimp!) comedy ""Get Smarty"" with Don Adams (Who also was the voice of Tennessee Tuxedo classic kids cartoon - also now on DVD!).
This is a great blast from the past! he chimps were well-trained to 'act' the parts & is a very original and entertaining series!
Ted Turner tried to revive this type of 'chimps-as-actors/actresses' and parody more modern films as ""The Chimp Channel"", but it didn't last long.
Get the original & enjoy!
I did!",1352246400,2,492,4.6022727272727275

5011320,4,B006OT0U5Q,"Ok, so it's corny, goofy, slapstick but it's still a lot of fun. Sort of like Austin Powers with mischievous chimps. I have fond memories of watching this series as a youngster in 1970, but one of the main reasons I purchased this collection was that proceeds from the sales go to Lancelot's Retirement Home, Los Angeles' Wildlife Waystation.",1348790400,2,342,4.813559322033898

5011326,4,B006OT0U5Q,"I was one of the people who bought the first release. It was not in very good shape as far as quality. The episodes were just not good at all but i wanted to see it again so i bought it. This one i will buy and use the other for coasters most likely. I sure hope this one is better. Its a funny show. Animal rights folks will most likely complain about it but im sure the monkeys were treated well(at least i hope so).If i find out other i will not keep it.

Update---The prints are very nice in the set. It was worth every penny. I watched the whole thing and  there was lots of info about how they made it and the chimps used. They even showed the real Lancelot Link at the wildlife waystation i think. I guess chimps live long. He is much bigger than he was on the show.

5011329,5,B006OT0U5Q,"In 1970, ABC aired a different type of show, starring CHIMPANZEES!! (not one human was seen). Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp was a spy spoof (influenced by James Bond, Get Smart, and a little Humphrey Bogart, since Lance sounded like him). This originally aired as an hour long series (not as the half hour versions seen on Nickelodeon and TV Land years back.) This series aired at the same time as CBS' Sabrina and The Groovie Goolies (same time slot at 9am). I didn't catch this show until TV Land aired it as part of their Super Retrovision Saturdaze line-up in 1999. Keep in mind, this show aired 6 years before I was born, so I couldn't catch it in it's glory.

As for this series, It's funny and charming at the same time. I'm not finished with it yet, but I'm glad I've brought it. What you get is ALL 17 eps, with excellent bonus features. (Do away with the Image Entertainment copies from 2006. This set is better). I've also discovered Worldvision Enterprises originally distributed this series for syndication (both versions of the logos appear). And yes, these are the half hour vesions you'll watch.

BTW: Veteran cartoon writer, Tom Dagenias was one of the show's writers.

To the creators, thank you for making this series so hilarious for the fans. Although it's cheesy by today's standards, overlook it. You'll have a blast watching this. Thank you, Film Chest Media.",1341100800,,1381,4.721991701244813
