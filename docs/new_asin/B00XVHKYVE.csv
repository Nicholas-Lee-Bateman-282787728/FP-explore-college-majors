7199872,4,B00XVHKYVE,"This WWII war story follows the classic storyline of soldiers trapped behind enemy lines. In this movie, it is American soldiers in France who have been taken as POWs and then escape. If you watch war movies, it's a story that's been done many times before. But there's a reason for that: people like it. I think we relate to elements of survival and relying on one another to get through hard times, whether that's war times or otherwise. One thing that makes this story a bit different is that female nurses are included in the stranded group. There is also an interesting sub-plot at a Frenchman's house who is ambivalent to help the group.  It's an independent film, not a big-budget studio film, but it delivers well in the independent genre. There are some gritty moments, some very suspenseful scenes, more than one heartwrenching story arc, and action scenes.

As a nice bonus, there is a 20 minute Behind the Scenes feature on the DVD where you can learn about what went into the making of the movie and what an independent production is like.",1437955200,3,1052,4.650537634408602
7199873,2,B00XVHKYVE,"The last thing we needed was another low budget, badly scripted and poorly edited war film with re-enactors who can't act for toffee; but we don't always get what we want.

The plot is that it's 1944 and some American soldiers are lost behind enemy lines. One of them has a whoopsie in the trench and his Captain gets injured. This gives the makers the excuse to have some nurses in the mix too - for l'amour as it were. Then they have to get back to their lines etc etc.

Now the acting is actually ok in places so that is a break with the norm. The vehicles are all real but we have a tendency to use American materiel and drape a Swastika over the front to disguise it and fool us all into thinking it really is German. Why camouflage a vehicle then advertise it with a ruddy big red, white and black flag?

The music is a bit too dramatic - especially as there is very little action. The scenes go on far too long; this needed some vigorous editing to be honest. There is no tension and any that does build up soon evaporates in the lack of anything happening. The guns are ok in places but those with a keen eye will see some of our Nazi bods sporting a rather `ahead of its time' AK 47. The uniforms are a bit ropey, there are too many plot holes to bother with and the cover art work is pure fantasy.

I tried to find something positive, and apart from some efforts in the acting department - there is nowt - even the plot is so dire and plain bad it is enough to make one cringe; its isn't even so bad that it is funny. If you want to waste your time you could clean your naval button fluff out instead it will be more rewarding.",1436659200,8,1637,4.074534161490683
7199874,1,B00XVHKYVE,"I don't know what movie the other three reviewers saw but I was very excited to see this movie but frightfully disappointed when I finally made it through the five minutes of opening montage only to find one of the slowest moving war movie I have seen in decades no action talking and talking and endless talking throughout the entire movie.
There was some potential but it moves so slowly I kept wanting to fast forward but was afraid that was it I might miss something interesting sadly that was not the case somewhat decent acting at times however really missed any action, bad cgi gun fire and stock footage to bad might have been good.",1436572800,2,640,4.525862068965517

7199877,5,B00XVHKYVE,This move is suspenseful and action packed! It is a Great War movie and has an unpredictable plot line which keeps you on the edge of your seat! I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good action packed thriller!,1436400000,3,225,4.380952380952381
7199878,1,B00XVHKYVE,"Writting was poor to very bad, acting was marginal, using some farms house in southern America as a French country farm is redicioulous, too many details not right for the time, casting a actors that are 60 years old as a Lt. and Capt. is not believable, and having 1940's nurses looking they are from 2017 is obsurd. Even the uniforms lacked completeness in many respects. Then there are the Germans that look like they stepped off the set of ""Hogan's Hero's"".  Ultimately, it was boring.",1509494400,,489,4.686046511627907

7199882,4,B00XVHKYVE,"Decent low budget film. Came here for Elizabeth Rice who shines in newly released Paradise Club. But one thing I want to mention, a major flub. The farm house... There are no sliding windows in France, anywhere. All windows are bay windows. Choosing a location in Alabama where the movie was shot, a little of the budget should have been spent on fixing that. It spoils the suspension of disbelief in foreign markets.",1505779200,,417,4.726027397260274
7199883,1,B00XVHKYVE,This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while.  Everything about it was poorly done.  The storyline is totally unrealistic.  The characters are one dimensional.  The outcome ridiculous.  Don't waste your time.,1504310400,2,216,5.057142857142857

7199885,5,B00XVHKYVE,"Somewhat tried and true themes interspersed with enough ""what can possibly happen now"" to make it worth passing the time.  I agree with the reviewer who gave it 5 stars and wrote about the humanity in war--the best quality of this movie is seeing that shift back and forth.  Some things made absolutely no sense (widower keeping a very tidy farmhouse with (spoiler alert) chocolates in the bottom of a dresser drawer. The German stereotypes are a bit overplayed, I would have liked to see some novelty there.  Regarding the scenery, well, I doubt they could have filmed on their budget in 12 days in Europe, plus obtained all the permits needed to display Hakenkreuzern, etc. Casting was good--Germans looked ""German"" (uniforms help) including young boys as you would see late in the war, Panzerfausts, I don't think you would see someone quite as rotund as one of the SS officers....The sound quality was a bit troubling. No subtitles, normally I can understand German in films, what was spoken by the ""Gruppenfuehrer"" was either a dialect I've never heard, or just poorly recorded.  Medals were a bit ""kitchy"" but most wouldn't notice.  At the end it was quite obvious that leaving the flag on the front of the ""Jeep"" would have been a problem (as it was in another fairly low budget film set in the Ardennesoffensive (Battle of the Bulge) that I viewed recently)).
Pvt. Lewis saves the day with his good luck charm--okay, a little Alice in Wonderland there but better than many high-tech and high budget films I've had to see recently.  Discussions of ""what is a good soldier"" made sense and were a break from the action.",1504051200,4,1624,4.761565836298932
7199886,5,B00XVHKYVE,"Not sure what all the negative reviews are all about.  Maybe they just don't like stories that show humanity in the face of war.  I enjoyed this immensely.  It was suspenseful, and showed humanity on both sides.  It showed how frail and how strong the human spirit can be.  I like it that the nurses were not left out of the picture.  Women played important parts in the war, and on the home front.  The black and white stills in the beginning were beautifully photographed.  Great movie!

I thought the big muscled guy seemed more like a bear in a circus.  Which is my only negative thing in the movie.",1503446400,2,603,4.4
7199887,4,B00XVHKYVE,"Jesus people- this is an indie film- for anyone making a movie do you know how hard it is to make a movie from an idea to production? Great effort- I have been in this industry for 25 years. It's not a perfect film- and there are so few-, but bravo to the cast, the crew, very well shot, good effects. Interesting film about the human condition in a time of great conflict. To the critics: Make a feature film with your own hands before you judge. I really enjoyed your film to the actors, crew & producers. Bravo, well done. You should be proud.",1500940800,8,546,4.20952380952381
7199888,4,B00XVHKYVE,"Don't know what the bad reviews were about.  There were only two things I found that didn't seem quite right.  One was the location.  It should have been in a forest with fir trees, and not pine trees.  The other was the one house that the Germans invaded and took over in 'France'.  It was a house right out of the 60's here in the US.  Other than those two things, the movie was very good.  It kept me watching.  The acting was really good, as was the writing.  One has to remember that during the war, many of the troops didn't always talk and act 'military'.  They were just young boys scared to death, and away from home.  I took one star off simply because of the two location errors.  But those two errors wouldn't stop me from recommending this movie.  I enjoyed it.",1500940800,6,774,4.255172413793104

7199893,1,B00XVHKYVE,"What a ridiculous movie.  This movie had very little plot and was poorly executed.  The worst kind of low budget film.  They didn't even so much as bother to cut the actors hair into period styles.  A German fighter aircraft was just some kind of modern low wing airplane.  The actors did the best they could with the ridiculous script.  A ""french farmhouse"" looked strangely like a 1960's Southern states (NC, GA, AL) 1 story average house.  Lots of scrub pines everywhere.  Nothing about this was any good.",1495324800,2,508,4.693181818181818
7199894,2,B00XVHKYVE,"Interesting premise and setup, but right away nothing seemed realistic.  Too many characters with zero awareness, too much un-military behavior.  Too few characters acted sensibly or intelligently.  And the ones who did failed to take decisive action to get the other ones on the right track.  Officers just acted disgusted instead of showing leadership and giving clear orders.  After a short while the movie became so irritating that it was unwatchable.",1491436800,7,455,5.352112676056338
7199895,2,B00XVHKYVE,"Changed my mind a bit on this one when I read it was filmed in 12 days. On that basis I would say it is entertaining enough as cookie cutter as it was. The acting was decent all the way around...story not so much. Lame. This group of ""soldiers"" couldn't win a flag football game let a lone a military conflict. Almost spoof like.",1491091200,3,329,4.15625

Only watched about 20 minutes of it and how a tank was able to sneak up on a guy I have no idea. Going back to the house in the woods.... that never happens in Europe, let alone the house style is not European.

7199901,1,B00XVHKYVE,"For starters, you have WW2 American soldiers in Vietnam era uniforms. The coveralls the girls wore weren't of the era either. Even the hairstyles of the nurses were inaccurate with one girl having a Stevie Nicks style do. They end up at a ""French"" farmhouse that looks exactly like a small country cottage in the architectural style of American South. Clapboard with cute shutters and a nice front porch with wooden columns. Inside complete with a regulator clock, iron bed in the bedroom and country cottage style painted white dresser. And the photo of the mans wife wasn't anything like it should have looked like in that era and was in a cheap walmart frame. The barn was unlike any European barn I've ever seen in my six trips, just a wooden out building, not a typical European stone barn.... also a corrugated tin sided shed complete with a slat back country rocking chair and a country quilt for cover. Not even close. Some of the German uniforms looked authentic in the tunics and headgear. Rifles were M1's and Mauser k98 which were good. Not a great plot or believable story line.  Not to mention it looked like some of the German soldiers had nine lives coming back in later scenes once they had already been killed off....Kind of laughable overall and not worth a watch. I could make a better movie myself....",1488499200,5,1322,4.67381974248927

7199905,1,B00XVHKYVE,"My husband and I love movies and documentaries about WWII and have seen many. I have got to say this was easily the worst we ever have seen. The acting was amateurish, and the actors' words were out of sync with their moving lips. The movie started out OK but rapidly deteriorated until the ending, which was really bad. The actors manage to escape captivity by setting explosives in broad daylight all around their German prison camp, and their escape vehicle is American and barely altered to look ""German."" They race out of camp and continue on their way through American lines with a Nazi flag still plastered on the front of their vehicle. It's little wonder that their American compatriots fire on them before they have a chance to explain. By the end of this film we actually were laughing as though it were meant to be a comedy.

7199998,1,B00XVHKYVE,"My tolerance for self flagellation lasted approximately 44 minutes before I had to stop watching. This should give you an idea as to how bad this excuse for a movie truly was. If nothing else, it was inspirational insomuch as I felt inspired to grab my HD camcorder and make my own film in my backyard since even that would be a step up from The Last Rescue. Yes, it really was that bad.

Everything about it was amateurish from the script to the acting. I never criticize a motion picture for a lack of a budget, in fact, I'm more likely to heap extra praise on it whenever it's pulled off. Unfortunately this wasn't the case in The Last Rescue. The setting didn't even remotely resemble the thick green woods of northern France during the Autumn. Instead, it looked more like Northern California during the Summer. While there was an authentic feel to the German uniforms, the American uniforms looked as though they belonged in the hot Pacific Theater rather than the much colder European theater. If details like those don't bother you, then consider yourself free to focus on the script and plot...both of which are riddled with the cheesiest of cliches i.e. the widower (and GQ model) living alone in the woods who takes in the runaway band of POWs. Wouldn't you know it, but it just so happens that among the POWs is a beautiful nurse who just happens to be a widow as well! Cut straight to eye-roll. The more successful directors within the motion picture industry have finally realized that you shouldn't make a German soldiers speak English as the vast majority of them clearly didn't speak English during that time frame. The ""Vee have vays of making you talk"" era of English speaking German villains has largely come and gone...but not in this throwback piece of cinematic trash. Forget about hiring German speaking actors and the use of subtitles to give an air of realism. Instead, this film doubles down and even includes the evil German laugh after this iconic line ""Don't vorry madam, vee vill be out of your vay in no time so long as you aren't hiding anyone...like a jew (insert evil laugh here). I could go on and on but there isn't enough space on the internet. In fact, please don't consider this a review but rather more of a public service announcement.",1482364800,,2277,4.6361386138613865

7200036,1,B00XVHKYVE,"Well, I guess with so much reenacting stuff around and reenacting groups, when you get bored you make a movie.  A pathetic movie.  This thing is supposed to be set in August 1944 in NE France when the 101st and 82nd Airborne divisions were back in the UK waiting for their next drop which didn't happen until the middle of September; nevertheless, there they were, ""soldiers"" from both divisions in the middle of this thing.  I restored a 1945 MB jeep and a 1942 Dodge WC51 so I know a little about the military vehicle collectors. It's always nice to see the old hardware - even in this case an M36 TD.  But geez, guys - the round loaded in the M36 90 mm looked like it had just been dug up.  Same for the rifle ammunition.  And how come so much shooting and obviously empty ammo pouches.

The German Army historically did use captured US equipment, but this movie has the German's using so much American vehicles you would think the US Army Quartermaster Corps was their main source of equipment!

I almost turned it off with 10 minutes to go, I cared so little about how it would end. The acting is horrendous and the characters - especially American - look like and speak like they are set in modern times. With such a huge collection of WWII movies setting the genre, there is no excuse for such anachronistic writing. The plot is just boring - I don't care at all about the characters as there is no character development, just a bunch of stereotypes (the tough yet respected leader, the scared kid, the fearless tough guy, the strong woman, the weak woman, the a-hole German, the sympathetic German...).",1473638400,13,726,4.507575757575758

7200394,2,B00XVHKYVE,This is a really ridiculous movie full of the most improbable situations and so far removed from any real possibility that I think it must have been written for the Hallmark channel. Poorly trained troops who keep screwing up and refusing to fight or obey orders. German SS officers waste time trying to convince these characters to give up when they are already prisoners. Hanging Swastika flags on American Jeeps and driving around France. Shooting prisoners one minute then talking to them and wasting time trying to find one of them and doing nothing else. Frustrating portraits of weak people who would never  make it though basic training. The is a real pile.,1473552000,2,665,4.884955752212389

7200515,5,B00XVHKYVE,"This movie attracted me because it is an indie film, and because the cast includes such an interesting lineup of actors. I wanted to see how Cody Kasch would do in a role so different from the one he played in Desperate Housewives, and to be honest, I love Gilles Marini and Johann Urb. I was happy to discover it is a good watch. The cinematography looks lovely and the acting is quite gripping at times. The two female leads play well against each other and add a dimension not usually seen in war films.

I don't understand those people who gave this movie just 1 or 2 stars. I can only conclude that they were unhappy because the DVD cover leads one to expect multiple epic battle scenes with dozens of bombs and special effects. The movie does open with a battle scene but the rest focuses more on character development and the psychological aspects of war.
