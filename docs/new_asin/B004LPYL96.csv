8434564,4,B004LPYL96,"Perfect, now these songs can annoy me in TWO languages!  ;)  my 3rd grade daughter is in her 4th year of Mandarin immersion, and loves this. She knows enough to understand its not a direct translation of the English, and it's a huge hit during playdates with other immersion classmates.  We're happy (well, especially if it's playing out of my earshot - ""get it out, get it out, get this song out of my head...."").",1414022400,7,414,4.493333333333333
8434565,5,B004LPYL96,"I'm putting a five star rating here even though I have never seen the DVD. The CD is simply amazing, Todd is in fine form and his stories are funnier than most stand-up comic's acts.

I have never seen this DVD actually offered for sale, new or used, and was wondering if anyone knew of its availability.",1402617600,,304,4.333333333333333
8434566,5,B004LPYL96,"Being of Scottish decent,  Nazareth has always been a favorite of mine.  If you like live rock,  you'll love this one.  Its even better than Snaz and I'll more than likely wear this CD out.  At the price buy 2 of them as its a must have for the serious rock fan.",1222905600,,262,3.9615384615384617
8434567,4,B004LPYL96,"no no no no no...the 'product review' for this dvd is all wrong.

That's right. Order last year a Runrig CD and now ship me Amazon.com a Nazareth DVD. Now are the DVD on the way to me.

A CD is not a DVD.",1136851200,2,204,3.6136363636363638
