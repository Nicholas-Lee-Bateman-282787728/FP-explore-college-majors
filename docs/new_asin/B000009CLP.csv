Great acting, themes, story lines, and scenic view.",1309737600,,234,4.133333333333334
1197204,5,B000009CLP,"Great movie, wish that the other episodes would come out on video also. If ever a movie screamed for a 2hr. followup ending to wrap up the loose ends this is it. Too bad Mr. Urich is dead this was one of his best roles!",1027468800,9,219,3.888888888888889
1197205,5,B000009CLP,"Everyone should see this video!!The 90 minutes went by too quckly!  I was sorry when it ended, hopefully some more episodes will become available.  Robert Urich is just great, handsome, appealing, and so believable as Lazarus.  The music is enchanting, the sets excellent and the story exciting.  I just can't say enough about how wonderful  "" The  Lazarus Man"" is.  I will watch this again and again.",1025049600,4,401,4.895522388059701
1197206,5,B000009CLP,"I first saw this television show and was enraptured by it. From the fine acting on the part of Robert Urich to the scenic beauty of the landscape in which it was filmed. The costumes and the music: how could somebody not  love this? Moreover, the opening two-hour episode (the series pilot) weaves  a tale of conspiracy theories mixed with post Civil war angst that would  make any fan of westerns or the X-files want to give this one a peek.  If  only the other episodes were also available...sigh!",938131200,19,499,4.561797752808989

7905335,1,B000009CLP,nothing to say except disappointment watching it!  I would no recommend this to anyone else.  Too many time changes in show to make it even remotely enjoyable.,1370649600,,159,4.851851851851852
