8550665,1,6305159424,"This video sucked! Video was too short + didn't show any Gang Members just talks nonsense about how to stay away from Gangs. I actually thought this was that movie Gangs After School Special shown on CBS Channel but no. I actually ended buying this same movie on another website claiming to be the after school special AKA Gangs the tough decision to stay out! Even had the actors names and every thing but sadly they gave me this same BS movie only difference is that it's on DVD not VHS. The VHS cost me like $12 or so and the DVD cost me $64 :( waist of money, on a movie I already have. ;(",1469577600,,593,4.120689655172414
