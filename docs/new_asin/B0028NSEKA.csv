3872793,2,B0028NSEKA,"This movie was a huge letdown for our entire extended family of all ages. There are so many ""dry"" spells you almost fall asleep. One good laugh every 30 minutes isn't enough for me. You hardly see Kirby Heybourne, the famous ""Mormon"" actor. The leader in charge of the shooting range was the only ""out there"" character in the whole movie. Very amatuer movie altogether. No wonder it was not marketed for theater release. If you have boys that want to see what scout camp MIGHT be like, then this is the movie for them. And the truth is, they may never want to go after watching this.",1246492800,5,583,4.407407407407407

3872795,5,B0028NSEKA,This is an entertaining family film that appeals to all Cub Scout boys and Scout young men.  My grandsons watch it over and over.  They tell me they all want to be Scouts when they get older.  Each one identifies with a different character in the film.  Buy it for your kids and grandkids.

3872801,4,B0028NSEKA,"Not a bad comedy with lessons to teach. The main thing is that it contrasts the best and the worst that I have seen over the decades. That said, it overamplified them out of proportion. Do Scouts get into fights? Sometimes, but rarely. Most often, it is an argument, not fisticuffs. The acting was ok, nothing to write home about. I did enjoy the concept and challenge of the ending twist. Could it have been done better? Absolutely! All said, it was worth a watch.",1416355200,,465,4.482352941176471

3872806,1,B0028NSEKA,"This had to be the worst movie that Kirby Heyborne has ever been in. It was a total waste of money and the acting was worse! Do not buy this movie, even if it's on sale for 50 Cents with free shipping. That's not all, the package came in the mail late and destroyed. DVD case was smashed, not the postal service's fault. May as well have sent it with only postage for all the package was worth. Lucky the DVD was only scratched a little but still worked.

3872809,2,B0028NSEKA,I found it very boring with no story to catch my interest.  The only reason I gave it two stars is because it might follow real life. However the Indian they threw had no.realizum,1382227200,,179,4.264705882352941

3872813,3,B0028NSEKA,This one was fairly ridiculous but I guess that was to be expected. The story was weak yet still somewhat entertaining if that makes sense. It is what it is. We still enjoy watching it once or twice a year.,1361145600,,206,4.175
3872814,1,B0028NSEKA,"Sorry!  I took a chance on the positive reviews in hopes that it would be a good buy.  I purchased it used on Amazon for a few dollars.  Thought it might be a good flick since I have FIVE young boys and a Scouting Husband.  We watched it as a family the other night.  It was painful!  Some of us were falling asleep!  I doubt that I would even give it one star.  I really wanted to like it, but it was just not good.  My husband has been a scout master for several years.  I know for a fact that if he were to ever be so oblivious to what was going on in his troop, as the scout master in this movie was portrayed, he would be released as a scout master.  Save your money for something better.  I threatened my boys that they had NEVER behave this way at a scout camp..... EVER!  I know... it was just a comical movie... but this is not the way I want them to think that they can act and behave at a scout camp.  Not even worth it to send it back.  I wonder if the second hand store or the local library would like it donated there!",1360368000,5,1032,3.8708133971291865

3872816,3,B0028NSEKA,"I have 3 scouts so I bought this movie as a Christmas gift to them.  Movie definitely wasn't Oscar material but still fun.  Boys got some laughs out of it.  Being in the scouting environment, you pick up on little flaws here and there, but overall it was worth the buy.  We've brought it to a couple of scout movie nights and the other boys liked it too. The boys favorite part was the extras and the music video included.",1355788800,,422,4.2375
3872817,5,B0028NSEKA,"Being a Life Scout from Troop 42 in frigid North Pole, Alaska, it took some of the bite out of the air when we saw what a real scout camp should be like. Of course it would have been more entertaining if they brought an Alaskan blizzard into it, but I guess that won't happen anytime soon. But I guess -40 below zero doesnt apply to everyone. All in all, great movie.",1320537600,,367,4.111111111111111
3872818,2,B0028NSEKA,"I really wanted to like this movie, previewed it and wasn't sure if it would hold the scouts attention. While on a road trip to camp, tried it out and the scouts elected no movie over finishing this one.",1313366400,3,203,4.230769230769231
3872819,5,B0028NSEKA,"This movie has drawn critics who have compared it to some of the previous Scout movies that have come out in the past. While this movie might not stand up to the comparisons, it's an enjoyable movie. It is not a deep movie full of drama and themes and full fledged life lessons. It is a nice enjoyable movie about camp and growing up and learning how to stand up and be counted when you need to be and that the Scout Oath means something.

The scenes that you would expect to see in a movie about Scout camp are all there. The rifle master taking his job too seriously, the reverent flag ceremony, the fire building and so on. They were just enough over the top that anyone watching should be able to get the idea that while there might be some limited truth to the scenes- they are to be taken as a joke.

This is an enjoyable movie. Funny at parts, poignent at times, but mostly just enjoyable.",1293753600,7,896,4.233918128654971
3872820,5,B0028NSEKA,"Movie is a fairly accurate example of a scout camp.  Funny and most troops have individuals like the these characters. This movie would be better viewed by older scouts who are First Class and have been to a couple of summer camps. The humor is geared toward boys who have some knowledge of a boy scout summer camp, otherwise it might be a bit confusing. Great movie. Our older scouts loved it, not so much the ones who had not been to summer camp yet.",1293148800,,452,4.317647058823529
3872821,1,B0028NSEKA,"Yes I am a boy scout. Now that we have that out of the way, I am a film Major and have to say that is a horrible piece of crap. Why say that? Because its an insult to scout camps around the nation. If this ""director"" had actually been to a camp, he would have learned WONDERS on how to portray camping for a week. The acting, script, cinematography, music are all OVERLY BAD and look as though it was made with $5.

3872823,1,B0028NSEKA,"I truly CANNOT believe that ANYONE who has seen this movie would rate it as ""good"", or ""great for the whole family"" or as anything other than the absolute rubbish that it is.  We just saw it inthe video store and thought we'd give it a whirl.  What a waste of six bucks!  It was so awful that it actually made compelling viewing; we sat there saying to each other ""surely it can't get any worse???"" and then - guess what? - it did!  It was SO boring and SO totally lacking in anything resembling, plot, point or talent, that I found myself losing the will to live.  I would rather stick pins in my eyes than EVER see a single frame of this dreadful excuse for a movie ever again.",1270080000,4,679,4.152671755725191
3872824,5,B0028NSEKA,"Purchased video to watch at Cub Scout meetings, movie nights or camp outs.
I was very pleasantly surprised when I watched the movie to preview.
It was good, clean and funny.  Plus, it had a message in line with Scouting (honesty and courage).
Our Pack will be using this, along with ""Down and Derby"" in our video ""rainy day"" library.
My own kids were engaged when watching ""Scout Camp"" at home, so I know the Cubs will watch it.
I enjoyed how the director poked fun at the various ""types"" of Scout Troops and Troop Leaders; from the uber-Scouts to the ""not-really-there"" Scouts.
I also thought that the blend of ""boy types"" was truly reflective of the vast array of boys in Scouting.",1269734400,12,683,4.5528455284552845
3872825,5,B0028NSEKA,"Scout Camp is a great movie for a low-budget film. If you are the wife or daughter of Scouts and Scouters, this will give you an insight into what your boys do when they're out camping in the woods. I was a Scout when I was a child, and a Scout leader for over 10 years. While some things in the movie were a bit exaggerated to make a point, the movie provides a realistic portrayal of what a week at Scout camp is like.

The Scout camp portrayed in this movie was a little more rustic than the camps I attended in the South. Our camp had actual plumbing and running water with hot showers in the KYBOs. And, we had an air-conditioned dining hall so we didn't have to cook meals in our campsite during week-long camp.

Overall, the movie is fun and campy and will provide new Scouts a rough idea of what a week of summer camp is like. Everything from the cheers, to the troop rivalries, to the camaraderie of Scouting is shown in this film.

Until now, ""Follow Me Boys"" was the movie to see, but this one, being more contemporary caught our eye.  We bought it out of curiosity and were very surprised when we played it, it kept the whole family's attention till the very end - even our grandson's!  I would definitely recommend this movie.",1266105600,25,450,4.530864197530864
3872827,4,B0028NSEKA,"I enjoyed Scout Camp: The Movie. Granted, it is not your big budget film but it was fun to watch. I have been involved with the Scout program for a number of years and I was surprised to see so many different personalities of Scouts represented in the film. And one scene hit a little close to home. I agree that a couple scenes could have been better acted, but overall I thought it was a fun family movie.",1262995200,2,407,4.1645569620253164
3872828,1,B0028NSEKA,"This DVD is not worth $20 or even $10 to say the least. Please save your money! The acting and filming are terrible. I had very low expectations of this movie and was still very disappointed. I bought this movie for my Dad for Christmas, my Dad is a scout master so I thought he would love it, and no one in my family liked it!",1262649600,6,327,3.9696969696969697
3872829,3,B0028NSEKA,"Only once a generation or so, it seems, does a feature-length movie about Boy Scouts reach the silver screen. There was the surprisingly meaningful ""Henry Aldrich, Boy Scout"" back in 1944 and then Disney's heartwarming ""Follow Me, Boys!"", with the versatile Fred MacMurray as Scoutmaster, in 1966. And, of course, River Phoenix starred as the youthful Indiana Jones in the 1989  hit, ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"". Billed as the next film of this genre centered on the world's largest youth movement, ""Scout Camp""  naturally invites comparison with those earlier pictures.

As Troop 909 spends a summer week at Camp Rakhouta, there are familiar vignettes aplenty:  skits and storytelling around the campfire while roasting marshmallows,  the assorted pranks and scatological gags sure to evoke giggles from the adolescent set, swimming at the waterfront, late night cabin raids, and the general fun of kids being kids at summer camp, away from school and parents.

Technically, Summer Camp is very good for an independent film, with pleasing cinematography that takes advantage of the rustic on-location scenery in Utah. The handsome production design gives the sets an inviting summer camp feel, sure to make any Scout ready to pitch his tent there. Casting and direction help make the youthful actors believable as authentic Boy Scouts. The post-production is of high quality, with entertaining music tracks (especially an offbeat hip-hop rap by Troop 909 in the midst of a camp formation) and original songs, such as ""Born to be a Scout"".

Despite these virtues, the film's woefully thin premise is likely to leave grown-up audiences wishing the writers had scripted a more ambitious story line offering some real depth, instead of a screenplay essentially limited to disconnected sight gags and not very developed characters.

""Scout Camp"" is a pleasant-enough B-movie that will appeal to boys of Scout age, but it could have had more lasting impact with a better plot.",1257552000,24,1980,5.2239747634069404

3872832,5,B0028NSEKA,"I thought this was great family fun. For a small budget movie, it was well written, well shot and well  directed. I always have great respect for anyone that puts in this much effort to make a movie and this one really reminded me of my ol' scout days! My 4-year-old son thought it was hilarious and he doesn't even know what scouts is! I know he'll appreciate it more as he gets older and gets into scouts later in life as well. I really would suggest this for any family that wants to see some good, clean fun. It really will bring back the memories. Show it to your Scout Troop!",1252454400,2,581,4.1875

Although there are a few memorable moments that the scouts could actually relate to, most of it did not hold the scout's interest very long.  The plotline related to the disappearance of the ""spirit stick"" might reflect some of the camps out there, but not this one.  Much of this movie was pretty dry.",1251504000,6,422,4.384615384615385

Okay, it's not Academy Award material but even on an obviously low budget it captures the experience of a Scout summer camp in a loving and entertaining way.  The director of the film is an Eagle Scout and in the bonus features he explains that this movie is his own ""love letter"" to Scouting for the fun and positive role it played in his life.  It doesn't portray Scouting as you might see it in the handbook or training videos, but it is pretty true to the camping experiences that most of us have had.  And it's a lot of fun.
