2445245,5,B000BX4X3G,"Even for a non-Yogi...or someone who has never taken Yoga before, this film is very informative and goes into the history of where Yoga comes from...And India is beautiful, so are the people there...I was very impressed and it's not even really my genre, but now I want to see more...",1153526400,16,284,4.588235294117647
2445246,5,B000BX4X3G,"I just loved it, as this film gives you so much more insight about yoga and where it comes from. Those practising yoga should def. watch ORIGINS OF YOGA. That does not mean that you have to be into the spiritual part about yoga. It's just great to see how the ""true"" Yogis live and where it all began. I can't wait for more films like this. I already saw 'Naked In Ashes' by Paula Fouce and it is outstanding, and I hope that it will be available on DVD soon.",1131321600,25,459,4.054945054945055

2445249,1,B000BX4X3G,"This documentary does not accurately describe the true path of yoga or the genuine ascetics of India. There is too much emphasis on thec external such as clothing, hair, lifestyle. The true yogis were often householders and knew that externals are irrelevant to self-realization.",1417219200,3,279,5.363636363636363

2445251,5,B000BX4X3G,"I ordered this DVD to add to the library of spiritual films. We create a safe space for spiritual exploration. I viewed 2 other films about Sadhu's in India, and The Origins of Yoga is far and away the best film I have watched on the subject. The narrator is respectful, and there is no exploitation of its subjects. I am very happy to have a genuine, thought and feeling provoking piece to share with our guests. There are many paths to wholeness, and exploration of one path of the Sadhu helps cast a light on one of the thousands of possible ways to express a Higher Power.

I definitely recommend this intriguing film. It showcases how a group of people, generally unknown in Western Canadian Culture, manifest their love and service to their Higher Power.",1259712000,2,760,4.588235294117647
2445252,5,B000BX4X3G,"Sometimes films like this leave me bored, but not this one. It has visual beauty, but what really gets you is how interesting it is. All the characters are unique, and they carry the story right along. I loved being exposed to this world, and I loved the film.",1169078400,4,260,4.326530612244898
2445253,1,B000BX4X3G,"Very disappointed. This DVD is nothing but collection of video of Sadhus. If Origin of Yoga is the subject, Yoga is much older than Buddha and is discussed in ancient scriptures of South Asia, which could have been shown together with details from Patanjali's book or from famous ""Autobiography of a Yogi"". If Spirituality is the subject, Sadhus shown in the video are too ordinary to talk about spirituality. There are respected experts in India on Yoga such as Baba Ramdev, who has tought Yoga to millions ( yes, millions ) and on Spirituality such as any of Shankaracharya or Sri Ravishankar. I found this DVD to be nothing but superficial work on naked sadhus.",1168560000,26,664,4.782608695652174
2445254,4,B000BX4X3G,What a nice surprise.  Interesting and well done film; much better than the cover photo might suggest.  For those who take yoga seriously or merely the curious.,1168473600,,160,4.888888888888889
2445255,3,B000BX4X3G,"This 50-minute documentary explores the way of life of wandering Indian yogis, vividly making the point that hatha yoga, practiced by many Westerners, is just one small part of the yogis' life of renunciation and seeking oneness with the Divine.

We see various yogis--many of them clad only in ashes rubbed onto their skin--wandering through northern India and Nepal, making pilgrimages to holy sites, praying, meditating, bathing in rivers, offering blessings, and of course performing difficult yoga asanas (postures). Commentary is provided by the yogis themselves and by Dr. Georg Feuerstein, a prolific Western writer on yoga.

The film, though interesting, wanders about with little apparent organization and with virtually no analysis (Are these guys ""holy"" or just odd? What are their backgrounds? What do their families think? Why aren't there any women?), and I came away feeling that I hadn't learned much about yoga or gotten much new insight into yoga as a spiritual path.

If you want to learn about the origins of yoga--a topic that doesn't actually get much attention in this film--I'd recommend the documentary ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Unveiled/dp/B002B8YORE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga Unveiled</a>.""

2445256,5,B000BX4X3G,"This is a wonderful film that every yoga student should see or anyone interested in Asia or the yogis.

Another well done magnificent little gem from Paula Fouce!",1164672000,,162,4.785714285714286
8093823,5,B000BX4X3G,"i guess the negative reviews are from people who were looking for a more academic film exploring the linear anthropological origins rather than the living ROOTS that are still fully present today. this is a wonderful documentary, an authentic portrayal of what yoga looks & feels like to the onlooker. that's about the most that anyone can ask for without being initiated themselves. i only wish the video used subtitles instead of voice-over when some of the sadhus were actually speaking English. i get that thick accents and unique sentence structure can make interpretation difficult, but sometimes HOW they say something can be as significant as WHAT they say.

very much enjoyed this.",1466812800,,690,5.106194690265487

8093825,5,B000BX4X3G,"Excellent documentary showing the real yogis, not the American`s  portrait of only females showing off posses of hatha yoga, and  well fed ""gurus""(today everybody is a guru of this or that) talking about yoga, and no-attachment, but living off the money of their followers, in nice houses,nice clothing, and well kept yoga schools. The main  character in the film explains about  fake yogas, and how some of them just smoke hachiss to get high. He explains that he does not go with them. Now a days you see lot of ""spiritual teachers"" in every religion preaching renouncement while at the same time are well taken care off by their disciples` money. In this film you see people that have really left everything behind,wearing rags, practically barefooted,bathing in the Ganges,ribs showing,with only a couple of possessions, and still one of the most relevant features is the genuine smile on their faces, and the peace they feel.",1463875200,,930,4.980645161290322

8093827,4,B000BX4X3G,Great insight into the true practices of yoga. It's not just about trendy yoga clothes and pithy affirmations. Refreshing to see the whole story about the purpose of the practices.,1462147200,,180,5.033333333333333

8093831,5,B000BX4X3G,Very lovely. Dr. Feuerstein has given an accurate and beautiful story of his experience in India. Wonderful synchronicitic experiences along his journey. The video provide a grander vision of the reality of the system on Yoga far beyond the western image of exercise. I highly recommend. I have only been meditating for 44 years with a little inward and outward study.,1427587200,3,368,5.049180327868853
