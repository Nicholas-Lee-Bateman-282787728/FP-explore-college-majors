189472,1,1572523255,"I bought the Johns on the suggestion of a friend and I seriously contemplated ending the friendship (afterall anyone who thought this movie was any good can't be worthy of my friendship). The movie had some funny scenes but that was it.  I thought David Arquette performances was seriously lacking any believiablity.  Lucas Haas was great however as the caring hustler who would do anything for his friend.
The plot was extremely unplausiable.  I was hoping the movie from all the hype it had to atleast be as good as Leaving Las Vegas.  It so was not.  The picture quality was subpar and only added to make the movie even worse.
The movie was a big letdown and that is why my review is so harsh.",1045526400,3,696,4.492063492063492

189474,5,1572523255,"I decided to let this film sink in a little before writing a review for it.
Let me start by saying: This film is much darker than you may think considering it's star is a goof-ball with the majority of his other acting roles.
This is not a Comedy.
And it is not for the weak stomached.
The Jesus Metaphore throughout was a bit much at times...but worked very well with the story.
You MUST see the DVD for the extras. I watched the film then immediantly watched the David and Lucas commentary throughout the film. (DON'T WATCH THE TRAILER OR THE COMMENTARY BEFORE YOU SEE THE FILM...IT GIVES AWAY TOO MUCH).
VERY GOOD...A Flick that Sticks With You.",1024358400,17,648,4.453781512605042
189475,1,1572523255,"With hopeful expectations of a modern reincarnated Joe Dallesandro movie, I found myself beyond dissapointed. Even a bigger put-down was the fact that Siskel and Ebert gave the loser ""two thumbs up"".  What you actually wind up with, is a sorry mutated version of ""Trick"" and ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar"" rolled-into-one. Even more distasteful, was the haunting ""stereotypical"" music in the background. Instead of collecting money to fulfill a drug habit, the main character ""John"", begs, borrows, and steals, to try and buy the ""one- day-high"" of staying at ""The Plaza"".  How completely unrealistic, as was this entire film. I would not only give it ""two thumbs down"", but two big toes as well. Do yourself a favor and watch something from the 60's or 70's, and put this piece of rubbish out to pasture.",975974400,5,800,4.9185185185185185
189476,3,1572523255,"Not-bad calling card for Hollywood, until you realize that the director's next project was ""The Mod Squad"" a movie that lacks any of the potential shown here. Although this movie about El Lay hustlers has its  faults--too many trite plot trappings when a solid character piece lurks  beneath--the performances are very good. David Arquette, Lukas Haas, and  ""guest star"" Elliott Gould are very effective. Contains the  expected abundance of ""F words"" and seedy situations.",962064000,2,472,5.337837837837838
189477,4,1572523255,"The movement of the story is very slow. There are 10 chapters on the DVD. Around chapter 4 I thought I was near the end of the film.
The film doesn't pick up speed until the middle. Here, we finally get to see how all  the hustlers are related to each other. Also, the two main characters  reveal a lot of themselves. We learn at how Donner's (Lukas) family  mistreated him when he decided to stop hiding. And we learn about how sad  John (David) is about the unfortunate placement of his birthday on the  calandar.
The movie is actually better with the commentary on. But, you  should see the film as is first before you watch it with the  commentary.
All in all, this film isn't bad. I think it is best viewed  when you borrow your friends DVD of this movie. It will not bore you, but  you won't have any trouble hitting pause to go to the bathroom, or talk to  friends, or answer the phone, or do anything. This film is really for those  that LOVE independent films.",952041600,8,969,4.269230769230769
189513,3,1572523255,"The VHS packaging calls this a ""dark comedy-drama"", and there is a level of street humor totally missing from two more famous films with similar subject matter, MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO and TWIST. That said, there is almost nothing funny about it. This is one of those films that seems to be made so that it can NEVER be shown on commercial television. There is lots of swearing, sexual situations and some seriously disturbing violence permeates the film from beginning to end.
The Christian symbolism is laid on with a trowel, but the acting is uniformly good. Arquette and Haas are tremendously watchable in unappealing roles.
I don't think that I would want to watch this a second time. It is just way too violent, but there are some remarkable moments, especially an ineffably touching last encounter between Arquette and Richard Kind as a sympathetic hotel clerk.",1184457600,2,865,4.891156462585034
189514,4,1572523255,"I was rather surprised that I didn't see this film when it first came out more than ten years ago, because it's on the level of compelling drama as My Own Private Idahol(River Phoenix). Having recently worked with Lukas Haas in The Stillborn(a horror film kind of like The Sixth Sense), I was quite eager to check out what he was like in terms of acting when he was 19 years old. I didn't quite expect to see David Arquette play a hustler, but it's convincing enough because his character is straight and he's ""gay for pay"". I must say that overall, this film is more touching than My Own Private Own Idahol, but it's kind of lower-budget and has a documentary feel to it.

Lukas Haas plays Donner, a ranaway/disowned wealthy son of a businessman. He's down and out in L.A. and befriends a more experienced street hustler John,played David Arquette. Donner goes through ""dates"" that John had seen many times before and they share a strong bond dispite their different sexual orientations. Donner eventually considers leaving the street life, but he must save enough money to buy his ticket. John wanted to go with Donner, but his hope for a new life gets jepardized when he got picked up by his last date, a homophobic trucker....

I was quite surprised that Arquette was willing to do a lot of sexy scenes like kissing and seductively dancing, and simultated oral sex with other men. Lukas Haas' role is less challenging compared to Arquette, but his performance was still very real. I loved the scene when he got picked up by elderly client and he got smacked until he was nose-bleeding. He had more dramatic and moving moments at the end of the film. I noticed that even Terence Howard Stamp played a supporting role as a gay pimp.",1168992000,2,1734,4.608414239482201
189515,5,1572523255,"I really like this movie though it has not so hot reviews.  I found it really sad, and it showed a side of the population unfamiliar to most of us.  It didn't hurt to have David Arquette dancing in his boxers either!",1168473600,,216,4.119047619047619
189516,4,1572523255,"This is a good movie with a solid story and realistic acting. Anyone who couldn't feel for these characters must have either not been paying attention to the movie or they are just heartless. Even though I don't enjoy seeing the sad lives of young hustlers the fact is they are out there. As with Donner many are there because they were kicked out of their homes by their parents who rejected them for being gay and others are there because of being repeatedly sexually abused. I didn't get the feeling that this was just another low-budget movie. The movie appropriately relayed the coldness and ""bad lighting"" of living on the streets.",1155340800,3,637,4.696428571428571
189517,1,1572523255,"This was a sorry, pathetic excuse of a film.  Nothing, from the opening title sequence, to the characters, to even the paper-thin story, was worth redeeming or recognizable as value.  Several reviews have argued the point that perhaps director Scott Silver (of The Mod Squad fame) should have done a bit of research on the life of a male prostitute instead of just allowing David Arquette the freedom of just jumping around and screaming to show the hardships of ""reality"".  I couldn't agree more.  I felt cheated and confused as I watched this elongated 24-hour period erupt chaotically into several convoluted themes and unsecured elements.  There was never a moment in this film to feel for our characters.  There was never a moment in this film for us, the audience members, to feel what living on the streets of LA involved.  There was never a moment in this film for us to see the pain that Arquette or Haas experienced on a daily basis.  Why was there never a moment?  There was never this moment because Silver was too busy using clich elements to force us to like Arquette as a character.  Silver continually forced Arquette's empathy and tribulations onto us thinking that seeing a Hollywood actor playing a gruff street urchin would immediately force us to break into tears and bow at the mercy of this flawed character.  How pathetic.

What should have unfolded during the course of this film was a chance for us to see the underbelly that LA attempts to hide.  There should have been more hardships aimed toward Arquette that would have developed into sympathetic moments.  A tragic character allows audience members to connect freely, while a forced character, like the one seen in Johns, makes us fall asleep, feel apathetic, and overly pressured.  It nearly seemed that during the course of this film Arquette could have run for Mayor of the homeless if he would have pushed himself a bit further. Arquette's final version of his character reminded me of an annoying politician instead of a homeless person.  He was shaking hands with everyone, becoming a stronger part of the street's culture, whether the street wanted it or not.  Never was it apparent that he was upset with his current living situation.  It was never made apparent that he wanted to escape the life that he had created.  So, when the unstructured ending finally occurred, it boggled my mind.  Arquette, or maybe it was Silver, made his character do things that I believe he would not have done in real life.  John (Arquette's character) would have not fallen asleep as shown in the beginning of the film once he had his birthday money in hand.  John would not have easily thrown his dream into the trash, as stated, but instead worked throughout the film to make it a reality.

Silver's inclusion of Donner (Lucas Haas) into the script only brought the story further into the dismal zone.  Donner is a random target.  Silver makes Donner stronger than John and I do not think that is a fair assessment.  Whatever Donner wants, he gets, no matter how that hurts John.  Donner is not the ""good friend"" that we all assume throughout the course of the film.  In fact, I believe that we could have done without this ""friend"" and just watched the course of John in this one day period.  Donner takes John's heart, his dreams, and nearly places him in trouble, and we are to assume that Donner was about to save him from this disappointing life?  I didn't buy it.  Secondly, did anyone else have trouble with the fact that Arquette and Haas were the two worst male prostitutes ever filmed?  Not that I have any experience with male prostitutes, but it felt as if each time either of these two ""professionals"" got into cars with clients, they had quite a ""no"" mentality.  This led to my impression that these two characters were not just weak, mismatched, and underdriven, but also lazy.  Silver successfully created two of the laziest male prostitutes to ever grace the silver screen.  I guess we cannot knock him for completely failing in this film.

Finally, I would like to say that Silver had a boatload of opportunity with this film.  The talent (perhaps outside of Arquette) was present on the screen, sadly, they just didn't do anything.  Keith David, Nicky Katt, Terrance Howard, Elliot Gould, and even John C. McGinley kept this film watchable, but with the counterpoints leading back to Arquette it only worsened the overall feeling of the film.  Even these independent heavy-hitters couldn't save this little ditty of a production.  We needed emotion and heartache instead of the suppressed anger we felt when dealing with the stereotypical generalization of these characters.  Silver didn't create an original body of work, but instead took clich moments from other cinematic features and called them his own.  Throw in a spaz-tastic lead, and you have what I like to call a little film named Johns.

This was not worth the DVD it was printed on.  I normally don't mind general independent films being made to tell a story about the hardships of living in America, but what I do mind is when they cast decent actors and give them horrible parts, or surround them in a horrible story, or just do not allow them to blossom.  Arquette hurt this film by not fully embracing the character or the realism of the life that follows these certain individuals.  Lukas Haas completely embodied this film with his character.  Poorly developed and randomly tangent.  This was a poor film and I do not recommend it to even the novice of cinema fanatics.

Grade: * out of *****",1143676800,4,5554,4.765445026178011
189518,5,1572523255,"Granted this movie suffers many of the perils any low budget flick must endure.  Bad sound horrible lighting and a little more predictability than I generally like in a good film.  Yet this is a good film.  Yes it is utterly a downbeat film with very little sunshine and hope in it.  However walking the streets of any big city you see the clones of each of the individuals protrayed in this film.  The cleaseless never ending parade of tired burned out haggered youth on the stroll hunting for that next ""Date"".

You sit eating your danish reading the morning paper insolated in the cacoon of middle class bliss and listen to those youth talk a few booths over at a fast food resturant.  Go there each morning for coffee and you hear how these hardened urchins cling to a clutch of tattered pie in the sky pipe dreams each more unrealistic than the last.  You look at their arms and see evidence of the losing game they play with drugs and worse.  If you eat in a place often enough soon comes a day when one of the regulars comes in beaten bloody bandaged if he is lucky having survived a date gone wrong. I work in a clean nice safe office as a computer geek one floor up and one trillion miles away from the horrid depraved street life people like those protrayed in this film call home every day.

Is this film a downer I guess maybe it is if you wanted a happy sugar coated hollywood ending.  While I have never been homeless or on the stroll selling myself I have helped people who have known and lived this ugly world 24-7. From my vantage point I see very little about the world of male prostitutes, drugs and street life that is redeeming light and fun which is what this movie shows.  The end of Johns sports a grim operatic quality traggic victory hard won and blood drenched such that it is in my jaded middle classed eyes hardly a victory at all.  On the streets even tiny scraps of joy no matter how hard they are to come by are so very precious and that is the real message of this movie.  Look at this movie and learn to be thankful for your many blessings because some among us honesty do have so very little in life that a pair of Lucky Sneaks can be the only reason to cling to hope. I know enough about life to understand that if  man's hope dies when he lives on the streets his body soon leads him to the grave.",1132531200,16,2334,4.237020316027088
189519,3,1572523255,"Unfortunately all the pieces are there, except the story.  To say the story is weak implies that there is one.  Things happen, but for no apparent reason, and the sequence of events doesn't add up to a coherent or compelling story.  It's more of ""a day in the life""...of a hustler.  If this is your interest, then you will like this.

Having said that, the acting and editing are strong and David Arqette is a likeable and convincing principal character.  It's okay overall, but not very compelling, despite it's relatively polished feel.",1116633600,2,538,4.793478260869565
189520,3,1572523255,"A somber and at times depressing indie movie about the friendship of two male hustlers, ""johns"" is a fine debut for filmmaker Scott Silver. Urban and dark, yet still emotional, this story focuses the loneliness and little hope of two young adults, presenting a moving and gripping drama. David Arquette is great as the lead character and Lukas Haas is competent as his sidekick, even if the plot isn`t all that great and innovative. Melancholic and heartfelt, ""johns"" is a pleasant surprise.

Worth watching.",1095206400,4,508,5.0476190476190474
189521,5,1572523255,"Anyone want to catch a glimpse of what happens to kids who are neglected or rejected by their families? Then you need to check out this movie. While incredibly tame compared to real life, it at least takes the average ""john"" into a pseudo world of the streets, and the actors are excellent in their roles. I have watched this movie SEVERAL times and have cried at the end each time. While I agree that it is a dramatic close-to-life rendition, and many want a fantasy world in which to escape when watching a movie, it also has a great message, one which you must find for yourself. I believe this is why no other character has a background, save the one, so that each viewer can find themselves in one of the characters. I love David Arquette in this movie...he reminds me a lot of a close personal friend.
Oh, yea, and most of them don't work because they have been on the streets since a very young age. They have few skills, no address or phone number, and perhaps are even a bit scared. My advice, watch this without the rose colored glasses.",1089417600,9,1047,4.374358974358974
