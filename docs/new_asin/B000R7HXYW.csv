2861519,5,B000R7HXYW,My son is a huge Veggie Tales fan and loves all the videos.  This was a perfect addition to our library at Christmas time.,1198713600,3,122,4.083333333333333
2861520,1,B000R7HXYW,"There are NOT 4 movies in the set. Anyone who wasted their money thinking they were getting new Veggie movies (like me) is going to be sorely dissappointed. This set has what they have already released.
Toy that saved Christmas and The Star of Christmas.
It has a Very Veggie Christmas on CD.
And another CD.

I was so excited because I was waiting for them to put A Very Veggie Christmas on DVD.
Since there is no product description and the photo is decieving I bought it.

There are 4 discs alright.
2 DVDs and 2 CDs.

If you already have this seperately don't waste your money on this set unless you really want the extra CD.",1192492800,63,629,4.313559322033898

2861544,4,B000R7HXYW,"My kids are teens, but they still love VeggieTales; and a Christmas without ""The Toy who Saved Christmas"" just feels lacking.  When I ordered this, I didn't read the summary properly so I thought I was getting 4 dvds.  The set is 2 dvds and 2 music CDs, which could be great if you have small children or work with children and need that kind of musical inspiration.",1359936000,,366,4.367647058823529
2861545,5,B000R7HXYW,Our 4 yr old loves veggie tales and this DVD/CD set didn't disappoint. It comes with two movies and two listening CDs.,1358121600,,118,4.409090909090909
2861546,5,B000R7HXYW,"If you have a toodler, you can't go wrong with Veggie Tales.  Personally, I think the  original, basic story ones are the best for children, not all the spin off's from modern day movies.",1354924800,,187,4.470588235294118

2861548,3,B000R7HXYW,"When I saw this product, I thought it was 4 holiday movies.  I should have looked more closely at the cover image.  It is actually 2 movies and 2 music CDs.  I wish I had bought the Holiday double feature instead.",1295049600,2,213,4.146341463414634
2861549,5,B000R7HXYW,"I saw this pack and immedietly had to buy it! I only owned The Toy That Saved Christmas but it was on VHS so this was a great deal. There are two movies and two cds. The cds are done in the style of an old radio show and are hugely entertaining.

The Toy That Saved Christmas - The Nezzer Toy Factory is trying to convince the children that unless they get the most toys Christmas won't be great. It's up to Buzz-Saw Louie and his friends to remind everyone what Christmas is really about!

The Star of Christmas - Set in 1800s London Bob and Larry set out to teach London to love by putting on a show (with lightbulbs!) however there is a pageant the same night at a neighboring church. How can they teach London to love if no one comes to the show?

A Very Veggie Christmas - I had this on cassette when I was little, it was the only tape I played so often that it broke. Finding it on CD was pure joy. It is like a really song heavy episode of VT in radio format. Everyone is gathered at Bob's house for a Christmas party. The theme is Christmas around the world.

The Incredible Singing Christmas Tree - Another CD much like Very Veggie, Bob and Larry are putting on a Christmas concert but they need to find the star singer so begins the auditions!

Highly enjoyable and totally recommended!",1290556800,4,1296,4.209677419354839
