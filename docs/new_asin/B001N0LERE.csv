8322715,5,B001N0LERE,Love this movie!  This is one of my favorite movies.  The picture and sounds quality are pretty good for the age of the film.  Anything with William Powell  in is fabulous and then to add on the other stars like Jean Arthur - it truly makes this a great film!,1454544000,,259,4.12
8322716,5,B001N0LERE,"I have a collection of Philo Vance. Everyone will have a favorite. What was surprising was that I also collect Louise Brooks's films and had no idea that she was in this one.

You can tell that this is during the transition time between silent and talkie versions as everyone is trying to find their footing. Evidently there is also a silent version out there somewhere.

It seems that a Margaret ""The Canary"" has her hooks in too many rich philanderers and the like. Now she is out for a title to go with her riches; young Jimmy Spottswoode (James Hall) is the perfect target as the potential hubby.

Her effort to touch everyone for a wedding gift irks them. Her potential father-in-law says no way, Jimmy's girlfriend lives next door; as we know will end up with the Canary being dispatched.

Yep everyone could have done it. It is up to the police, coroner, and Philo Vance (William Powell) to figure it out. Naturally if it is true to form it should be the last person you suspect.",1404432000,,986,4.4916201117318435
8322717,3,B001N0LERE,"The Philo Vance mystery novels were very popular in their day, but faded into obscurity due partly to their seeming superficiality (the auther, S. S. Van Dine never took his work seriously) compared to other writers like Agatha Christie or Raymond Chandler.  But ""The Kennel Murder Case"" was sufficiently clever and well executed on film (with William Powell reprising the Vance roll) over at Warner Bros. in 1934 that it justifiably ranks as a classic.  This first film with Powell as Vance (part of three films done at Paramount) is a lesser film, but still fun to watch (if only for the always enjoyable Powell).  The only snag is that the prints are poor (not surprising) but which the video versions only aggravate by stretching the image to fit a 16:9 HD TV layout (instead of presenting them in 4:3 bookend form).  If you're prepared for that limitation, though, mystery or early sound film buffs can still get an interesting feel for the era by exploring these early Vance mysteries.",1370908800,6,991,4.811764705882353
8322718,4,B001N0LERE,"In the event the film does appear again on Amazon (copies are available here and there) here is a brief comment. First, while given top billing in most places the film was/is being sold, Louise Brooks and Jean Arthur, between them, have no more than five minutes dialog. The first plays the eponymous 'Canary', the second a suspect in the murder of the former. Too bad. While I have no recollections of Louise Brooks, Jean Arthur was one of the Darlings of the Screen and is much missed. On the other hand, three established figures of the silent era did appear and showed a bit of the reason why they survived  well into the era of sound film. William Powell, best known to this date (1929) for his villainous portrayals, here is in the process of becoming one of the very best at what he did on the ""good"" side of the law to be seen on films. Note how he, and each of the better performers, deliver their dialog following a noticeable pause between speeches and with a stiffness not later apparent in their work. I suppose there was a technical reason, something to do with sound recording in that day. On view,also, is Eugene Pallette, once handsome leading man, who already had gained the weight, which, with his gravelly voice, became his trademark in many classic films (and, many others not as good when his career went downhill). Finally, the Canadian ex-singer, vaudevillian and silent film actor, Ned Sparks, with his dead pan face, and inimitable voice, was on hand for one of the first of his long sequence of featured roles.
Unless some digital magic can be wrought on the film that will be issued, it is likely not to be in the best of shape. We are lucky to still have some things left from that era (it is said that 90% of all silent films have disintegrated into chemical mush or simply have been lost). The story is co-written by S. S . Van Dine (pseudonym), a best selling author of mystery books in the 20's and early 30's. It is a typical Philo Vance. Through the analytic power of his mind, Vance is able to discover just who did kill ' The Canary', and save his friend Markham, DA, and his chief police assistant (played by Pallette) from certain embarrassment by picking the wrong person for the crime. There is no rough stuff, no tough guys, just an assortment of potential wrong-doers and the victim, in addition, that is, to Mr. Vance and the police, none of whom speaks in other than the King's English. It is an engaging film, both for its historical interest (it sets the format for a generation of similar movies) and to see in action some of those pioneers who gave the films a voice.",1331424000,7,2616,4.495798319327731
