7990742,5,B00009EIRD,My 4 hour old loved the video.  The dance steps were broken down step by step.  Still a little fast for her to follow but she was determined to keep dancing even if she messed up the steps.  I followed along too to keep her going. Fun for the whole family.,1262822400,2,256,3.980392156862745
7990743,5,B00009EIRD,"So...I'm in a local store recently and I just happened to be sifting through their videos for kids when by chance a see a face that seems very familiar to me. I stared and could not figure out why...until I noticed the name Geo...Geo...Geo..Geo?OMG!.....Geo!...from ICONIC... on MTV's America's Best Dance Crew 2008! You know I had to buy it, right?!? I was not disappointed at all. I really enjoyed this video. I loved the 3-way camera angle shots. My kids & I like hip hop dancing and this is a new fan favorite at our house. Call the kids downstairs and get on the dance floor with them. You will be smiling before you know it, and maybe ""bustin' some new moves"" as well!",1203033600,6,674,4.443548387096774
7990744,5,B00009EIRD,"I bought this one for my 11yr old son - he loves Hip Hop dancing but is too shy to attend a class. He loves it! I love it - and his siblings (3 younger) all get up and dance too. This is quick, fun and energetic! Oh - and very positive too - I like the language and positivity of the intructor and kids. You do not have to be GOOD or coordinated to enjoy this DVD. A+ for anyone who wants to get up and move to the music and have FUN!",1201219200,7,434,3.627659574468085
7990745,5,B00009EIRD,"I do this with my kids and it's really a laugh fest. I wish there were more exercise type videos geared toward kids that I could do to. It's hard to exercise with kids...but this one keeps their attention fairly well. (My kids are 5,3 and 1) It is really for older kids and I totally believe a 12 year old would love it just as much as my smaller ones and myself!",1182470400,6,363,3.9863013698630136
