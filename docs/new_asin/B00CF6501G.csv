I particularly liked the part where after the first few days, her body is hurting, and then you see that the body just gets in this rhythm and keeps going, day after day... it shows not only the reality of such a journey, but the resilience of the human body and the strength of motivation.

Thanks!",1389916800,,430,4.443037974683544
5720967,1,B00CF6501G,"I was fortunate to have walked the Camino de Santiago myself in 2008 so I speak from experience.  When I bought this movie I was hopeful that I would find something more than seeing ONE person walking and not having interviews with fellow travelers to get their experiences.  The movie was very short (thankfully), and then went on to show her walking in Asia, which had nothing to do with
Spain's Camino.  I was extremely disappointed  and felt ripped-off.
I don't recommend buying this DVD.  Instead, check out the extraordinary documentary ""The Camino, Six Ways to Santiago,"" which follows six people on their 500 mile journey.  It really brings the actual experience to light.  It's poignant, insightful, humerus, and full of the human spirit.
  Another interesting DVD is called ""The Way,"" with Martin Sheen and his son, Emilio Estevez.",1388793600,24,841,4.9928057553956835
5720968,5,B00CF6501G,"I saw this short film at Hell's Half Mile Film and Music Festival this year (13) in Michigan and was impressed.  It successfully told a story without dialogue in a brief 15 minutes.  Great cinematography, music, and storyline with a touch of suspense.  I wanted it in my collection.",1381104000,,282,4.714285714285714

5720970,4,B00CF6501G,"I enjoyed it, but it is not very long.  The second part is about Asia.  The best film is THE WAY, as far as scenery goes.",1370736000,5,121,3.6153846153846154
8581160,1,B00CF6501G,totally disappointing since I thought this was the marvelous documentary about the people who walked the road to Campastello that I had seen in the theater in 2014 (?). I'm sorry I did not look more closely when I purchased this video.,1435968000,,235,4.619047619047619
8581161,5,B00CF6501G,Fabulous film which builds in drama and meaning as it unfolds. I am still thinking about its message. Don't miss this one.,1435276800,,122,4.590909090909091
8581162,3,B00CF6501G,"I should have read the description a little better. This is just 15-20 minutes of camera work. I was looking for an actual documentary on El Camino. Only 3 starts because, even what it is, it could be a better.",1429315200,,210,4.275

8581166,1,B00CF6501G,"DO NOT BUY this dvd if you intend to see a documentary on The El Camino Santiago!  Extremely disappointing!!! I thought I had purchased the wrong dvd! It CLEARLY states on the case ""CAMINO The Journey To Santiago"".  On the back of case: ""The Way of St James, Frances route, is an ancient pilgrimage from the Pyrenees of France to Santiago de Compostela; finishing at """"The End of the World,"""" Cape Finisterre, Spain.
It is ONLY the first 15 minutes of this film of the El Camino, and 10 minutes of that seems to be spent on sewing on a patch on her backpack, looking at a map, brushing her teeth or putting her hair in a ponytail!!! There is no narrative and only music.
After that, the entire documentary she is narrating her hike to see temples with a chinese hat on I'm assuming in CHINA!!!  I did not know the El Camino runs through China! NOWHERE on the description does it EVER mention a hike through CHINA!!!  What the hell?!!!",1411862400,4,934,4.412790697674419

8581169,4,B00CF6501G,"Really enjoyed this video, although I thought it was a bit too short.  I walked the Camino in 2013 and seeing all the places in the video brought back all the memories with it, the joys and the physical trials.  Looking forward to her next video on her pilgrimage to Japan.",1398643200,,273,4.333333333333333
