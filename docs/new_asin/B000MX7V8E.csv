8173304,5,B000MX7V8E,This is my 3rd time watching this series and I love love love it! I particularly loved the character Grace Baily...without her I would probably have watched only 1 time.,1509753600,,169,4.666666666666667
8173305,3,B000MX7V8E,"I purchased this used.  The first two disks were in excellent shape, but the 2nd side of disk 3 is scratched and almost impossible to watch.  It is disappointing.",1420416000,,162,4.551724137931035
8173306,5,B000MX7V8E,Great Series.  Really enjoyed.,1419292800,,30,6.5
8173307,2,B000MX7V8E,"I tried this because my family loved Anne of Green Gables and the Avonlea series, both by Kevin Sullivan as well.  However, I admit I was unable to finish it due to the acting.  It does not compare.  So if you are thinking it will be good because it has five stars here and Anne and Avonlea are great, don't get your hopes up too high.",1383609600,,335,4.045454545454546
8173308,5,B000MX7V8E,"My wife started watching the ""Wind at my back"" and really loved it.  The episodes on TV were sporatic, out of order and hard to follow. Went to Amazon and found all the seasons.  Now she watches them in order and is very happy with the shows. Quality of the item is excellent.",1326585600,3,276,4.188679245283019
8173309,5,B000MX7V8E,"I liked this video so much that I got two of them, and sent one copy to my sister in New Mexico. She and her husband both enjoyed the video.",1317600000,,140,3.7
8173310,5,B000MX7V8E,"I fell in love with the movie. I saw it on T.V. and was so surprised to find such a clean, humorous, heartwarming movie with no obscene or vulgar scenes or language.",1304380800,2,165,4.1875
8173311,4,B000MX7V8E,"Great series about family life during the Great Depression in a mining town in Canada.  This series has it all--cute kids, interesting and engaging  adult characters, a battle axe of a grandma who can actually have a heart at times, fantastic sets, convincing costumes, solid acting, and a story line that pulls you along.  It's heartwarming, genuine ""family entertainment"" and an ideal choice for anyone who enjoys ""wholesome"" programming, and is particularly suited to those who are terrified that their children might see adults acting like adults sometimes do (not a profanity to be heard, nor a glimpse of ""untoward"" flesh anywhere to be seen)...all in all, it makes a wonderful gift for all ages.

However, you can get this for more than half the Amazon price from Sullivan Entertainment (the ""Anne of Green Gables"" franchise).  As of July, 2008, they're asking sixty nine ninety five plus shipping for both seasons.  This hundred and forty nine dollar price tag is a blatant, even offensive ripoff, which is why I only gave the series four stars.

Fairly priced, it deserves five.

Also, for fans of the show, someone other than Sullivan has acquired the rights to Seasons 3-5, and they should be coming out with those sets in the fall of 2008.  I'll be first in line to buy them, as the series is addictive!",1217289600,21,1315,4.834821428571429
8173312,5,B000MX7V8E,"This is a wonderful DVD series. Great for the Family. It is wholesome entertainment.
I wish there were more Sessions in the series.",1200700800,9,131,4.739130434782608
