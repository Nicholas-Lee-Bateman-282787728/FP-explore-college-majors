1684413,3,B000062XE7,"I did not buy this DVD from Amazon, but was interested as I had seen it advertised as a ""psychological thriller of romance and intrigue"" (or something like that) and it sounded unusual. It more closely resembles something from late night HBO or the Spice Channel. The story is not really particularly involved, but in the end everyone gets burned and nobody is really who they seem to be.
As far as the story itself goes, there isn't much plot other than an ongoing theme of infidelity (and inability to trust your friends), and relaxed dress and moral codes. The actors generally are quite good looking, and the cast largely does a good job with their roles. The movie seems implausible enough (and is) but there is an interesting and unexpected twist in the last ten minutes of the film that earns the movie a couple of stars above an HBO late night production. I won't spoil the twist, but will say that it does make the entire premise of the film much more plausible, if still not entirely so.
Not really a true romantic psychological thriller, it is well done for what it is.",1090195200,6,1080,4.543589743589743
1684414,4,B000062XE7,"Forbidden is a good adult movie. The sex is explicicit and the
women look great. Such an incindent can occur in real life!
The music is also good. Jason(Dillon Silver) appears to be
a promising actor. Niki(Renee Rea) looks just like Britney Spears.
The story is good.",1079049600,3,267,4.702127659574468
1684415,5,B000062XE7,"wow, what can I say... I'm impressed. FINALLY after many soft-core movies this is the best one by far. Not only the sex parts are really good but the whole story will get you into it. Yeah, I'm the kind of guy who fast forward to get to the sex scene parts and never cared about the story, but this one actually caught me. Renne Rea (the one on the picture) reminds me of Britney Spears, so.. yeah.. THAT IS QUALITY.",1055289600,23,416,4.148148148148148
1684416,4,B000062XE7,"Jason is a young man at a crossroad in his life. He is about to marry his beautiful and adoring fiance Lisa. But first he has to survive the ultimate bachelor party being thrown for him by his best friend and best man Andy. However, Jason is committed to remaining faithful, and slips away from the festivities to hide out at the hotel coffee shop. There he meets Nikki, a fascinating woman with whom he forms an immediate bond. The two of them end up sharing the perfect intimate night together and agree that it will remain their erotic secret locked away in time forever.
Two years later, Jason and Andy have not seen each other since the wedding and Andy relocated to the other side of the country. The old friends plan a reunion weekend at a fantastic Malibu Beach house that Andy has rented. Jason brings his wife Lisa and Andy brings the woman he is planning to marry. When the four finally meet up, Jason is shocked to discover that Andy's fiance is none other than Nikki (now Monique) the woman from his bachelor party - the very woman he has not been able to shake from his fantasies for the past two years.
Jason's thoughts and feelings run amok...""I'm married"", ""Monique is engaged to Andy my best friend"", ""I am still ridiculously attracted to her and not a day has passed that I haven't thought of her"". It is obvious to Jason that to pursue his feelings for Monique would be wrong. But sometimes the most tempting fruits are the ones which are Forbidden.
There are multiple sex scene, nudes in this movie which I give a rating of four(for those whom likes to watch multiple sex scenes in a movie). I give a rating of 3 star for the story in the movie.",1054080000,68,1666,4.412337662337662
1684417,4,B000062XE7,"Forbidden is absolutely the cream of the crop of American softcore, a position which I used to grant to ""Play Time"" with Jennifer Burton. This film goes way further than that one, and out-performs even the kinkiest of Skinemax's erotic soap operas. The skin factor here goes off the scale, and gets extremely daring and explicit, moreso than all the other American softcore that I've seen (and trust me, I've seen a LOT!). Shannon Whirry, Shannon Tweed, and Monique Parent films should be on Disney compared to this. Zalman King, the publicly accepted king of American softcore, is put to shame by this film. I don't want to get too graphic with my descriptions--I CAN'T--but let's just say that this is the closest I've seen an American product get to duplicating the great euro-sleaze genre typified by Jean Rollin and Walerian Borowczyk films. Beautiful women with absolutely no shame in exposing themselves entirely!!!",1052697600,50,922,5.032679738562091
1684418,4,B000062XE7,"In a genre crowded with mediocrity this little gem delivered on all levels!  Great looking women (although I would've given 5 stars if there were more than 4 of them), nice ""action"", EXCELLENT story, and quite a bit of craft involved with it's production.  Also the fun DVD extras were a nice surprise, it's like hanging out on the set.  I did a credit search and it seems like the Producer and Director were responsible for a bunch of Playboy's better titles.",1040169600,18,460,4.585365853658536
1684429,1,B000062XE7,I have to agree with the other 1 star reviewer.  This movie is terrible and not worth buying.  Not a good movie for female viewers!!!  Now I am stuck with this piece of garbage.,1272844800,,177,4.147058823529412
1684430,1,B000062XE7,"I suffered through since I had paid for the DVD, but it went in the trash bin as soon as it ended.",1261094400,2,98,3.5
1684431,1,B000062XE7,"This movie is completely one-sided.  The females in the movie are filmed from all angles--T, A, and crotch shots--with nothing left to the imagination.  The males, however, are filmed from the back, leaving everything to one's imagination.  This movie is great if your a man--a disappointment for women.  The only thing forbidden in this movie is showing frontal male nudity.",1249948800,23,375,5.2
1684432,3,B000062XE7,"The basic premise as explained by other reviewers was made believable in the movie. The actors made the brother/sister connection work. Unfortunately it takes up to scene 13 before any good sex enters the movie.  From there on the story is much more interesting, especially the kitchen scene; and her action when she realizes their parents know what's been going on.",1226793600,10,366,5.0
1684433,5,B000062XE7,"Not much for plot and storyline here. This movie was great, if you like to watch T & A. Believe me, there were alot of it. At his bachelor party, Jason has a one-night stand with Nikki(Renee Rea) who he forms a bond with immediately but can't continue because he's due to marry. Fast forward to 3 years later, Jason and his wife Lisa (Tracy Ryan) and Andy and his fiancee Monique/Nikki plan a reunion weekend together. Jason is surprised to discover that Andy's fiancee is none other then Nikki/Monique. You can probably guess the rest. Very good with alot of T & A action.",1198800000,17,573,4.466666666666667
1684434,4,B000062XE7,"Forbidden is another of the seemingly inexhaustible and growing supply of softcore flicks. So what's Forbidden about? Anybody that rents this kind of movie for the plot is going to be sorely disappointed but still, it has a plot, so I will describe it. The story centers around four people, Andy, Jason, Lisa and Monique. A couple days before Andy's impending marriage to Lisa, Andy's best friend, Jason, throws a bachelor party for him in a local hotel room with his buddies and a couple strippers. Andy can't seem to get into the swing of things so he goes outside and sits at a table by the pool and orders a drink and starts up a conversation with an attractive tall slender girl named Nikki (Renee Rea). Andy left the bachelor party because he intended to remain faithful to his fiancee Lisa (Tracy Ryan) but he gravitates to Nikki and though both their intentions seem to be honorable, they inevitably end up in bed for a memorable night. They both agree this was a one time fling, expecting to go on with their lives, never to see each other again. Unfortunately, Nicki really got under Andy's skin and he still thinks about her, even three years later when his friend Jason invites Andy and his now wife Lisa, to his family's vacation house for a long weekend and to meet his fianc`ee. Now Andy is the consummate player, who swore never to marry, so both Andy and Lisa are anxious to meet the woman who captured this confirmed bachelor`s heart.

Andy and Lisa arrive first and one thing leads to another and Andy starts shagging Lisa on the Billiard table. When Jason and Monique arrive, while Andy and Lisa are flagrante delicto, they make a mad dash to retrieve their clothes and dignity. After the embarrassed couple get dressed Jason introduces his fianc`ee Monique who to Andy's surprise it's his dream girl Nikki (Nikki is short for Monique). Unbeknown to Andy, Jason and Lisa have a past and unbeknown to Lisa, Andy and Nikki also have a past and what evolves is an almost comedic situation of musical partners and an anticlimactic climax.

Conclusion

Obviously with softcore movies, one has to use a different yardstick to review and rate them. The unstated but ultimate purpose of softcore movies is not so much to entertain but to stimulate the viewers, while entertaining them. If you do not believe this, I admire your naivety. With that in mind, I take this criterion into my reviews of softcore films. While sex scenes are supposed to be erotic in nature some succeed more than others. Of the ten or so sex scenes within the film, a single shower scene reached true eroticism for me. The other scenes while still ""entertaining"" seemed to be too choreographed and were, somewhat, devoid of emotion and even worse intensity.

Overall the flick had a relatively weak plot, an attractive cast who performed decently. The directing was acceptable, while cinematography was very good although it shot and edited in a straight forward manner..

1684436,5,B000062XE7,"Poor guy, meets his dream girl at the really wild bachelor party.  The story had a good plot, and I thought the acting was very good.  The two leading ladies were really beautyfull.  I tell you, it sure made it hard for ME to choose between them.  [:-)",1122336000,6,252,4.1875
1684437,4,B000062XE7,"forget what I have written during the past and as for this review, I do know that my very first review is very unlikely to be posted as the first person to review for this diffrent brand made of the movie forbidden but hope that the recommendation do help not only to improve the sale of this movie but to let the rest of interested buyers know what they really want and what they are looking out for. I hope this recommendation is useful in some ways.

The story is basically about Andy knowing Jason's weak spots of his 'playboy' character after and before his marriage. He bought her Nikki at first and then a the end Monique which later ended up with a big 'spark' which caused his wife and his freind to leave him and the woman he love behind the ville. (Andy also have sexual contact with Jason's wife by the way). There are lots of erotic scenes in this film which might interest buyers whom are interested in this category of LOS(eg: playboy series which is also passed by MPAA).

1684438,2,B000062XE7,"Other than the firm sexy bodies and the steamy erotic scenes I don't find another reason to watch the movie. I was particularly astonished with the weak acting capabilities of the cast and the weird ending of the movie. What was intended to be a twist at the end of the movie, turned out to be more of a confusing unrealistic tease!

I don't know when are we going to get a decent erotica movies that respect the viewers' mentalities and do not undermine the audience expectations.",1090800000,6,481,4.528735632183908

It does have a bit of a plot so I liked that - but the ""interaction""

7957714,2,B000062XE7,"On my way home from lunch, we passed by a well-known San Diego store which specializes in adult books, videos, etc. My wife wondered why we didn't watch any adult videos. Well, I don't know. We just haven't and I just didn't feel like going into that particular bookstore. So, I suggested that Amazon might have some and we checked. Sure enough, there is a good supply of soft-core DVDs and we ordered three. One of them was ""Forbidden.""

""Forbidden"" is a lame story involving two women and two men who seem to want one another and the resulting couplings which take place. The acting is weak and the filming is so-so, but I guess you don't watch these things for quality cinema. Well, there's a lot of skin showing, that's for sure, and the couples go from one simulated love scene to another, and another, and another. You get the idea. None of the actors is any good but, of course, they have quite nice bodies and are good looking. Some of the close up photography of the women, in particular, is quite explicit and leaves little to the imagination, if you're into that sort of thing. Don't expect any full frontal male shots, however. The love scenes are just not believable, in fact they look ludicrous. Let's face it, this is just not a good movie. I suppose it would be watched for arousal, but it is not particularly arousing either. Much better stuff can be found on the internet.
