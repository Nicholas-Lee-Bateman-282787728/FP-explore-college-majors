8392443,5,B0039UU3SM,I turned my lovely gf onto One EskimO a few months back.  Just last week she came home from a Goodwill with this remarkable DVD for $1.50.  Sweet!  Will be purchasing at least one more copy from Amazon.,1436054400,,202,4.2631578947368425

8392445,4,B0039UU3SM,"For the not-so-technically inclined, please read:  This dvd did not play on my MacBook.  It would have been helpful to know this information before purchase.  There is a small disclaimer on the back cover which states, ""This disc is expected to play back in dvd video ""Play Only"" devices, and may not play in other dvd devices, including recorders and PC drives.  The disc contains .VOB files (not mp4 or mpeg), which are unreadable by iTunes, QuickTime, and VLC upon insert.  After much reading online, using trial and error freeware, shareware, and paid software; I was able to extract and convert the content to play on my Mac (as mp4).  I don't know if the same holds true for Windows-based systems.  Had I known this beforehand, I would have just purchased the entire season on Amazon Instant Video.  Three stars for the hassle.

Technical issues aside, I absolutely love the music and wonderful animation in this tv production.  Five stars for content.",1325980800,2,958,4.8580246913580245
8392446,5,B0039UU3SM,"If you are fan of One eskimO, you will greatly enjoy the animation created by the band members themselves.  The animation was well done and set to the album's music, just lovely.  Only thing I didn't like was the credits between each cartoon.  I understand how they intended to set up the cartoons, to keep you watching for the next one.  I had hoped that the cartoons would be shown continuously as they are shown when the band plays live.  All that aside, I really enjoyed going along for the ride with One eskimO. One eskimO reminds us to never lose sight of our dreams and ambitions, and to trust in taking a leap of faith!",1291680000,,627,4.370689655172414
