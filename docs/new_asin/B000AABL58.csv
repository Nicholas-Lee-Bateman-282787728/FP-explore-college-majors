2383748,1,B000AABL58,"I HATED this film.  I had hoped to learn about the ""Birth of a Nation"" and ""prenatal"" life in the region.  But the entire film is about postnatal fighting.  Fighting, fighting, fighting!

The film is for people who find fighting to be glorious - for people who like to keep score of battles and casualties like some kind of sports game.

This ugly film depicted the entire society as being barbaric.  And it sanctified the barbarism as being something good, something heroic.  Surely the beautiful people and the rich culture of this region deserve more than this.  Surely the viewers deserve more than this History Channel pandering.",1159660800,16,634,4.859813084112149
2383749,5,B000AABL58,"the most beautiful miracle of hshem took place on may of 1948. israel became a nation once again. for 2000 years israel has been displaced and been scattered through out the nations of the world. this is the most touching,heart warming,and gut renching you will ever see on film. makes you want to sob with so much joy and relief to see the holy people of G'D coming back home to the promised land of avraham, yitzhak,and ya'akov. biblical prophecy has been fulfilled.

  yehoshooah is the gratest miracle, his life and ministry, his death, and ressurection. his whole life mirrors (reflects) exactly what happened too ancient israel and the jewish  inhabitants. also vice versa israel mirrors the agony, pain, and death and ressurection of our beloved masheeakh yehoshooah.

 this movie makes me proud to be jewish, proud to be israeli, and joy in my heart that yehoshooah,the anointed one,and his father in heaven, the holy one of israel, made this all possible that israel would be a nation once again. against all odds israel is still a nation surrounded by arab enemies who want to destroy our country and our people. it is sad to say but true that there are christians who like the arabs feel the same way about us. yet against all odds israel is a nation and a miracle too. bruch hshem (bless G'D) and todah hshem (thank G'D) i know i do every day. i know this film will inspire people.anyone who loves freedom will love this inspiring miracle that came true and was well documented on film. after the agony, suffering,pain, and death of the holocaust joy came afterwards in may of 1948 that joy came when israel became a nation once again. sorrow comes in the evening and joy comes in the morning i have read this in the psalms of king david. the holocaust was the evening and the nation of israel was the morning when joy came to the people.",1144713600,35,1850,4.60790273556231

2383751,5,B000AABL58,"A riveting and highly informative documentary for anyone interested in Israel's War of Independence, with penetrating commentary from the greatest historian of Jewish history today, Sir Martin Gilbert., together with real live footage from the War of Independence and shots of Israel from today. Ends with a film essay by the ex-British soldier and Jew, Bernhard Beecham of Israel in 1949, just after having won the war.
By the end of World War II the Nazis had killed about 6 million Jews. Many of the survivors were refugees in foreign countries. The British government continued to limit Jewish immigration into Palestine and protesting Jews organized large scale resistance movements. Shows footage of the activities of the three Jewish liberation movement s at the time the Haganah, the Irgun and the Lechi or Stern Group ,  The United Nations Special Commission on Palestine recommeded that the Holy Land be divided into an Arab state and a Jewish state. The Arab state as Gilbert explains covered the areas where the large majority of Arabs were settled and included Jerusalem, the Galilee and the Negev. The area which was set aside for the Jewish state had a mainly Jewish population. since the Jews had a 3000 year history in the Land of Israel and had there had always been a Jewish presence in the land, and the Jews were there by a peaceful process of return, one would have though that it would have been universally considered fair that the Jews were allowed a part of this land. The Jews accepted this decision but the Arabs rejected it and began hostilities immediately.
This video covers such events as the Ben Yehuda Street bombing by Arab terrorists, the massacre of the Hadassah convoy of nurses and doctors where over a hundred Jewish doctors and nurses were brutally massacred by Arab terrorists who had ambushed their convoy. The Battle of Latrun in which Jewish forces fought a way to open up supplies to besieged Jerusalem and the Arab attacks on Jewish kibbutzes across Israel., as well as footage of the horrific mutilation the Arabs practised on Jews they had murdered.
In May 14, 1948, the Jews the independent state of Israel and the British withdrew from the Palestine Mandate. The next day five neighbouring Arab states invaded the fledgling Israel to try to help the Palestinian Arabs destory the new state and it's population.
also demonstrates the British role in the war in which British troops actually took part in some of the fighting on the Arabs behalf, and British warplanes bombed Israeli positions.
Quite a succint and instructive focus on the war, we see how Druze and Bedouin villages actually rallied to support of the Jews and the new State of Israel, and after the Jews had won the Battle of Haifa , the Jewish commander urged the Arabs to remain in the new state but to no avail. Interviews with Jews who took part in the battle.
Heart wrenching and inspirational how the Jews, losing a tenth of their population, fought and succeeded in securing their homeland, depicts the hope, courage and sacrifice of those who forged the new state, with footage showing the men, women and children , who pioneered the modern state of Israel. I would just differ from the title, which I think should have been called 'Israel: The rebirth of a nation' as this was the rebirth of the ancient Jewish nation that existed on this same land.",1361750400,6,3374,4.827288428324698
2383752,5,B000AABL58,"If you are looking to figure out Israel's miraculous survival through the centuries, looking into the recent history of their reemergence as a nation with films like this can help a person understand that they are truly ""God's Chosen People"".",1360713600,,242,5.075
2383753,1,B000AABL58,"The documentary is shameless in its advancement of Israeli nationalism. The narrator imposes his views on virtually everything. Irgun, the Zionist terrorist organization is not viewed as a terrorist group, but acts from Arabs are. Britain is viewed as having a limiting effect on Israel, when it could equally be argued that they were an enabler for the Israelis. He stated that the Israelis granted full civil rights to residents, no matter what ethnicity or religion, which is patently false, even if it may justifiably be argued that Israel grants a significant amount of rights that exceeded those granted in surrounding states. No effort is made to view the conflict from the Arab side, with only minimal information brought to light about the Arab forces, their strategies, and the plight of the Palestinian people. It ends with a sentimental shot of a rainbow, which is a great microcosm for this film. If you want something that will make you throw your fist in the air and say ""GO ISRAEL!"", then this is your film. If you want something that presents the war in a fair way, then it is not.",1357862400,2,1098,4.78421052631579
2383754,5,B000AABL58,"This documentary will better help you understand the trials, testings and determination it took for the Jewish people to gane their own land.  It will give you a heart for the Jewish people and a willingness to stand for Israel.",1357776000,3,228,4.7
2383755,1,B000AABL58,"While I am not Jewish I do feel for any people that are made to suffer. I was greatly disappointed as complex maps, names of obscured villages and towns and leaders that were laundry listed one after another . The video failed to show the birth of a nation by the continued suffering of a great people with almost no support.  I was ashamed and surprised that the British (who always seem to meddle with self righteous indignation) caused much of the pain because of the way they partitioned the country after the WW-II. I was also surprised how the British favored and supported the Arab countries over a people just trying to exist and even did recon to aid in the killing of the Jews. The video was mainly a blurry film of many of the battles and wars from 1947 to 1949. I was also horrified how the leaders in Israel used Jews returning from concentration camps were used as ""fodder"" like lambs lead to slaughter sending them out to fight without training, supply or support. I could go on and on about the failure of this film to truly highlight the suffering of the people and the true birth of a nation. I feel the video should have included the outrageous conduct of the Egyptian people, the slaughter of the Jewish people using the available documentation of the radio and newspaper threats the returning Jews had to face. The one highlight for me was hearing how the Jews had existed with the Arabs for centuries before the war and how some factions of Arabs were supporters and fought side by side with Israel and helped in building the new nations and were actually welcomed and became citizens of the new nation.",1326758400,9,1625,4.5272108843537415

Take my word on it, that DVD stands head and shoulders above this one!",1240876800,12,331,4.5
2383758,4,B000AABL58,"The use of stock footage from the era gives the viewer a ""feel"" for the times.

2383759,4,B000AABL58,"Undoubtedly it's difficult to adequately describe the history of any nation's birth in one 50 minute documentary. The History Channel and Sir Martin Gilbert made a creditable attempt. Yet, the overall result is disappointing.

As another reviewer mentioned, the film is too much comprised of historical footage major War of Independence battles--from before the Nov. 29, 1947 United Nations partition vote, before and after Israel's May 14, 1948 Declaration of Statehood, through the February, March, April and July 1949 Armistice agreements and their aftermath.

The film includes interviews with retired Jewish defenders and survivors of massacres at Kfar Etzion, Mount Scopus (Hadassah Hospital medical convoy, Apr. 13, 1948), Sha'ar HaGai and Yad Mordechai. There is also wonderful 1949 footage of post-war Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and so on shot by Briton Bernard Beecham, who visited specifically to document life in Israel's first days as a sovereign state.

On the down side, the only Arab archival footage was reportedly staged anti-Israel military propaganda. This seems imbalanced.

There are also 1948 clips of Galilee Druze and Negev Bedouins who look  happy to have accepted Jewish sovereignty.

But viewers miss any adequate Arab League political or Islamic theological explanations for the refusal to accept a new Arab state alongside the Jewish one. There's only the demand of Transjordanian King Abdullah I--that Israel submit to Muslim rule, or face war.

Also missing are any extant archival radio or news clips of Arab exhortations to flee--or destruction of Israel. Possibly only the news clips survive, but the documentary missed an important opportunity to air them.

Finally, while Jewish immigration from Arab nations is mentioned in passing, the forced exodus of nearly one million Jews from Arab and Muslim nations is not reported here, nor is Israel's absorption of their vast majority. That's unfortunate, since Middle Eastern Jews had lived in Arab and Muslim countries for thousands of years, in the case of Iraq, since long before the coming of Christ.

Birth of a Nation tries, but doesn't adequately present the intricacies of Israel's founding.",1169683200,25,2175,5.411242603550296
