8278509,1,B001APXB0U,this was taken from a Kinescope and the picture quality is terrible.  Even at this low price it isn't watchable. It's badly out of focus,1478390400,,136,4.44
8278510,1,B001APXB0U,"As a collector of vintage recordings of television productions of musical theatre recordings, I have become used to overcoming the flaws inherent in watching classic recordings in favor of their content.

Of all the recordings I've viewed or purchased -- this video is an example of among the worst I've seen.

There are better copies of this out there.  I've seen them.

DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS ONE.",1439683200,2,415,4.802816901408451

8278512,5,B001APXB0U,"The picture is a little smudgy, but you can see them fine.  The sound is good.  I frankly don't care for Mary Martin.  Lots of Coward's songs are from his Las Vegas show (the announcer said so at the end of the show) which is still available on CD, along with his Manhattan show (called The Noel Coward Album).  It was a delight to see him perform. His remarks and delivery are about the funniest things I've ever seen.  He cracked up Mary Martin at one point.  I saw Coward in a couple movies (not his own), but I've never seen him like this - the gestures, the facial expressions, the inflections in his voice.  To put it bluntly, he was a ham, and there's no mistake he was gay.  God bless him!

I only know these songs from his nightclub shows.  ""Uncle Harry"".  The last chorus was cut, obviously censored (has the word ""bust"" in it).  Martin's ""My Heart Belongs To Daddy"" was revised - to the point that the song HAD no point!  Coward's raciness came across loud and clear.  I was stunned and happy.  There were some other lyric changes, but they didn't spoil much.  Coward was incredibly rhythmic.  And he reminded me overwhelmingly of (of all people) Al Jolson (who I've loved for years).

It was all singing, solos and a closing medley.  There were three or four short ""backstage conversations"" with Coward and Martin which were hilarious.

Coward wrote songs (words and music), plays, poems, short stories, one novel, painted (he was good at that too), traveled constantly and performed.  When did he find time to DO  all this???

It was about 90 minutes long, the length of a movie, I thought Mary Martin was boring, and really only liked Coward, and that when he was singing his own songs and talking.  In the medley, they sang a few bars from Rodgers and Hart's ""I Didn't Know What Time It Was"" which is the only time I've heard Coward say or do anything about Larry Hart.  (I forgot.  In his bio, Rodgers mentioned that Coward in one of his plays has a character play some of a Rodgers & Hart song on the piano.)  While it's well known that he loved Porter.",1326240000,3,2070,4.4217506631299734
8278513,5,B001APXB0U,It is what it is.....a kinescope of a TV show Mary Martin and Noel Coward did many (55) years ago. The quality is just terrible but I love it. It's just priceless if you are a Coward fan. I am thrilled to have it. The Master is the Master.,1270598400,3,239,3.8979591836734695
8278514,5,B001APXB0U,"For those of a certain age, this program will help them remember when network TV cared about presenting a certain number of classy, quality presentations.  The video looks like a slow speed VHS copy of a kinescope (one can see the tracking adjustments).  The sound, however is clear and undistorted.  The performances are classics and should be in the library of anyone who cares about either of the performers.  This goes particularly for Coward since so few of his musical performances are available on video.  Although most of his own songs are available on CD, his facial expressions and hand gestures add a lot to one's enjoyment.",1268524800,3,635,4.897196261682243
8278515,4,B001APXB0U,"I bought this video, and expected a little better video. I guess I should have known better for a 1955 TV show. The picture is horrible, and the sound barely passable. Nonetheless, it is still worth having for the performances of two of the theater's all time greats--still in their prime years, more or less. Having a video of Mary Martin singing ""I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy"" is worth the price alone. And watching Coward doing many of his Las Vegas night club songs I previously heard on CD is a treat. The expression he gets with a lyric from his hands and those long fingers helps to explain why Sinatra and Judy Garland were such big fans. Considering the breadth of his talents, he is perhaps the greatest British theatrical figure since Shakespeare.

Martin and Coward had not collaborated since she had starred in his ""Pacific 1860"" production, done prior to her big success with ""South Pacific."" Their relationship had been on-again, off-again--but certainly on-again by this show. One of the highlights: the Puccini opera aria sung semi-comically by Mary, which Coward had wanted to cut, since he didn't think her voice was operatic. Interesting that they decided to put this conflict into the script, as it actually happened! Well, Mary pretty much pulls it off singing in English (awkward for an Italian aria), with Noel watching on-stage, showing soprano range except for the last high note.
And to think they did all of this live in those days.",1222300800,12,1464,4.809523809523809
8278516,5,B001APXB0U,"the video is pretty tough  but this is a gem
realise it is 1955  live tv

it is a rare  live performance  of  the great noel coward
and  a great pairing with mary martin
this is a real charm  to watch
even though the poor  video quality
overlook the  video  and enjoy  the program
its wonderful",1217635200,6,294,4.053571428571429
