1817735,2,B00007KE63,I was excited to receive this film after reading the other reviewers comments.  Unfortunately the format is tired - dramatic male voiced narration over scenes with actors and interviews with historians (who seem to have an average age of about 70).  Information is accurate but there's none of Franklin's joie de vivre.  I was hoping to use this for my middle school students but I want them to LIKE history.  Disappointed.,1452038400,2,423,4.915492957746479
1817736,5,B00007KE63,"one of our favorite cds on the founding fathers. detailed, showing his private and public life. there are many details of franklin's life that go unnoticed or not talked about and this brings them to light.  There were many more layers to this man than you realize. while many think he frittered his time away having fun in france, others believe it was his influence there that eventually brought france into the revolutionary war that won our independence for us. it is evident we could not have beat england  at that time without the help of the french soldiers. highly recommend. enjoy!.",1444262400,3,591,4.784313725490196

1817780,5,B00007KE63,"This excellent documentary/biography with actors recreating Benjamin Franklin and other notable persons who were related or friends with Franklin was produced by PBS.  The documentary explores the life of one of America's greatest citizens and the fascinating live he led.  Benjamin Franklin was an inventor, a politician, a diplomat, an observer of society, the first post-master general of the United States, a revolutionary, a father, a husband, a philanderer, and a man who cherished the spotlight.
All of these characteristics of Benjamin Franklin are told in honesty and expose the greatness and the weaknesses of this remarkable man.  The scenery is great, the acting by actors recreating the life of Franklin is fascinating, and the documentary always keeps the viewers interest. The documentary tells about his beginning in Boston and through the years he ends up in Philadelphia as one of its most revered citizens and was a very active man in creating the new United States and signed both the Declaration of Independence and The Constitution.  He was also the United States first diplomat (Ambassador to the court of King Louis XVI of France).
This three part series is a great documentary by PBS, who ALWAYS makes great documentaries and is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1382572800,,1273,5.2254901960784315

1817782,5,B00007KE63,"Epic documentary.  Really takes you through his life, and makes you feel who he was, and how America embodies his spirit.

The actor playing Mr. Franklin (Ralph Archbold) does a great job in connecting with the viewer, and capturing that wit, charm and spirit.

Watching the end, I felt a emptiness in having this great person leave my screen (I watch alot of documentaries, and this is the only one I felt that way).  A must-have for every documentary or history fan. Would make a great gift too.",1375833600,3,497,4.613636363636363

1817803,5,B00007KE63,"In general, I much prefer the Ken Burns approach to documentaries : vintage portraits or pictures with voice-overs. This is one of the best biographical PBS films I know of that features live actors. Easton is very believable as Benjamin Franklin : the quotes are very well chosen and I thoroughly enjoyed watching Easton act them out.",1320624000,,335,4.894736842105263
1817804,5,B00007KE63,"This is an outstanding series in three parts about one of our most fascinating citizens. The writers have demonstrated the changing philosophical, religious, and scientific context of Franklin's life. The contributions of this man were amazing, though his normal human limitations are evident as well. The director of these videos employs actors, often speaking Franklin's actual words, as well as many art works that the depict the subject.",1317081600,,441,5.5
1817805,5,B00007KE63,"As a big fan of Franklin's life, I've read several books and have seen every major video of his life, and this one is fresh, informative and entertaining. The actor who portrays Franklin is convincing and isn't brought into the streets of Philadelphia today - I watched it twice in the first two weeks of receiving it.",1314748800,,318,4.5964912280701755

1817807,5,B00007KE63,"The video was awesome. The acting was awesome. Even if you had no interest in this guy, by the end of the DVD you want to read everything you can about this amazing man. BF was well ahead of his time! Born with no social rank whatsoever, his insatiable desire to learn & his vast intellect allowed him to rub elbows with kings, heads of states, scientists, philosophers, musicians, literary giants..and every other walk of life you can possibly imagine.

1817810,5,B00007KE63,"What a smart fellow...his love was science, but he gave that up and his close family ties to serve his country.  This DVD shows the flow of his life and the hurdles that he had to overcome to reach the goals that were important for a new forming country.  It was the French that made the British surrender at Yorktown, VA and it was Ben Franklin that brought the French army into the fight.  He should have been President and the Hero of the war...but it is difficult to go against Washington's efforts of living in frozen ditches and being in the field.  Without Ben Franklin the young America would not have bloomed into the country we love today.  Very well presented and should be a required DVD for high school students.",1263168000,2,725,4.462121212121212

1817822,5,B00007KE63,"I have not seen many biographical documentaries, but this has to be among the best I've seen.  It was very thorough in the treatment of Ben Franklin's life as a scientist, diplomat and bussiness man.  Whether you are looking for a good introduction to Ben Franklin or looking for something to solidify and review your knowledge of him and or the times he lived, this is an excellent program.  What I really like about this video is that it doesn't shy away from some of the more unflattering aspects of Ben.  This shows that all men (small and great) have their faults.  You will learn about his whole character which will provide an excellent foundation.",1258416000,,655,4.660869565217391
1817823,5,B00007KE63,"Many would say Abraham Lincoln, some maybe George Washington...but in my opinion, Benjamin Franklin was, and is, the greatest American.  Why?  Franklin was accomplished in so many areas, you'd have a hard time just trying to keep track of everything he did.  Luckily, this program does it for you, and does it rather well.

It is split into three episodes, but throughout, you will see the many sides of Franklin:  statesman, diplomat, inventor, scientist, philosopher, self-made businessman, humanitarian, visionary...and that's just what I can remember!  Franklin was one of those rare individuals who was able to succeed at seemingly anything he tried; a multi-talent who, really, was a giant among his peers.  That's what it comes down to, and one of the historians interviewed at the end of this program nailed it:  Franklin was, simply put, a genius.

His story is told in a variety of ways - re-enactments, readings from Franklin's ""Autobiography,"" letters, on-site location filming, commentary from noted authors, and more.  It is all woven together rather neatly, which helps to make the 3+ hour program pass without noticing.  In the end, even though Franklin lived to be 84 years old, you are left wishing there was more to tell.

Five stars.  Anyone watching this program cannot help but come away with a new appreciation and admiration for Franklin, even if you already know his story.  Let the others fight over Lincoln and Washington, because it's only for 2nd place anyway.  Franklin tops them all!",1247875200,2,1514,5.0728744939271255

1817826,5,B00007KE63,"This is one of the very best video biographies on Ben Franklin I have ever seen.  It goes beyond quotes and images and (thanks to Mr. Easton's marvelous portrayal) the audience is treated to a very deep and thorough understanding of this complex ""human multitude""*

1817828,5,B00007KE63,"This video was ordered because of my son's school project.  We didn't think that we would actually enjoy it so much. The story was told so well, and presented a character that spoke as if Benjamin and an actress that represented his wife.  You really got the feeling of knowing and loving Benjamin Franklin.  I can't wait to watch it again and I hope that my other son will someday have to do the same project.",1201392000,,410,4.368421052631579
1817829,5,B00007KE63,"This clever and entertaining look at the life and times of Benjamin Franklin would be a great addition to the library of any Franklin buff or history buff for that matter.

It is well written, and entertainingly presented with a mix of narration and live action.  Richard Easton does a fantastic job portraying Franklin and the cast does well acting out actual correspondences and written first hand accounts from the time.

The film is broken down into three segments showing the life of Franklin. Let the Experiment Be Made, The Making of a Revolutionary, and The Chessmaster.

Let the experiment be made shows the early life of Franklin, how a genius was made and his contributions to science.

The Making of a Revolutionary shows how a man who once considered himself a loyalist became a fierce proponent of independence.

The Chessmaster detailed his years in France gaining support for the war, the treaty of France, and the building of the American Experiment in democracy.

Ultimately this film does a great job portraying Franklin as a man.  Sometimes flawed, as we all are, but a man who contributed so many things to making America what we know today.
It does it with wit, humor, and narration that moves quick and keeps you interested.",1200528000,62,1247,4.849056603773585
1817830,5,B00007KE63,"This DVD is made up of a combination of historical reenactments, interviews of actors quoting the real character's words, and comments made by authors, historians, and other assorted well read people on history and the Franklin family.  They are all interwoven flawlessly together.

There is so much information about Doctor Franklin, his contemporaries, and events in history, that this needs to watched several times to absorb all of it.

Doctor Franklin, who was given an honorary doctorate degree from Oxford University, had only two years of formal education.  He was self taught in many areas and had many diverse interests and talents.  He was a scientist, inventor, writer, business man, philanthropist, ambassador, and helped to establish and secure our country as a legitimate one Europe's eyes.  He is the only person to have his signature on three of the most important documents in our history, The Declaration of Independence, the treaty with England after the Revolutionary War, and The Constitution of the United States.  Finally, he was also a husband, father, and grandfather.

I could write pages on what I had learned from watching this DVD, but it would be better if you purchase it and discover the enormous contribution that this man made to this country and the world for yourself. :)",1188864000,3,1308,5.107981220657277
1817851,5,B00007KE63,"This film is about another founding father of the United States, Benjamin Franklin. It categorizes three parts to decipt him and I think this arrangement is pretty adequate.

The first part, Let the Experiment Be Made, is about his enthusiasm on the science and the impacts to the world. The most famous story may be the kite and the lightning. In addition, this part also talks about his early life. Some of his scientific works are scattered in the other parts of this film.

The second part, The Making of a Revolutionary, is about how he becomes a Patriot rather than sticking to a Loyalist. It is somewhat ironic since he regards himself as an Englishman rather than an American most of his life. At last, this turns out to be his darkest time since he and his son, who helped him in the kite and lightning experiment, are separated for different political beliefs.

The third part, The Chess Master, is mostly about his endeavors in France during the Revolution War. After winning the independence, he is also a key man for the peace treaty with England and France and the U.S. Constitution. It is not straightforward as we might think to reach the peace treaty with the European powers because they had their own agendas. The U.S. Constitution is also not seemed to work at that time since no one is satisfied with it due to so many compromises and fears. Overall, these make him the only one sign in the three most important documents in the early U.S. history, the Declaration of Independence, the Treaty of Paris and the U.S. Constitution.

The time is well spent after I have finished it. The narration and comments from experts are smooth and on focus. It's very pleasing to watch during the whole running time. I recommend this DVD to anyone interested in Benjamin Franklin, who deserves his fame.",1180569600,20,1810,4.682389937106918
1817852,5,B00007KE63,"Benjamin Franklin was really a great man. He contributed so much to shape America in what it is now.

1817853,5,B00007KE63,"As with the PBS series Liberty!, this documentary uses actors donning costumes and delivering dialogue from actual letters.  You will never find a more lively performance than by Richard Easton as Franklin.  He will make you believe he really is BJ; there should be some kind of award for this performance because you will not find better acting in any current television show (or film) than by this master of the art.",1165708800,10,418,4.791666666666667

Its informative, accurate, and if watched on your laptop/desktop - you may want to investigate the background materials online that are discussed (or acted).

The acting is good.  Richard Easton is a true professional, and the rest of cast does an above average job as well - for a documentary.  The commentary from experts is equally as pleasing, and quite balanced.  It stays on point and leads from beginning to end like a good book.

Well worth a buy for the facts, acting, and return value.  I give this 4 stars as it is not anamorphic, but letterboxed widescreen (not enhanced for 16x9 TV's).",1162512000,41,851,4.509803921568627

That he was one of the greatest men who ever lived comes as an afterthought (many afterthoughts here).  A thoroughly human human being.  Does not stint his science.  All actors here are superb. Perhaps a few too many professors, but even they outdo themselves.  Terrific humor, tragedy.  Best thing ever seen on PBS.  Do not miss the opening scene!",1150156800,9,477,4.875

I'd seen part of it on PBS and had to track it down.  The stories are detailed, and the way the actor comes across, you forget that he isn't the real Benjamin Franklin.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1137283200,5,329,4.174603174603175
1817858,5,B00007KE63,"There is so much information in this PBS DVD that I was very impressed.  The level of in depth knowledge that a group of students that I mentor at Glenwood School received from it was also impressive.  The ideas that each child shared upon watching the major sections of this DVD was extremely helpful.  The students communicated how they were inspired by Ben because of his tenacity, diligence, determination and his ability to come from poverty and rise to international fame.  But whether you watch Benjamin Franklin alone, at work, in a small group or with students you will enjoy it.

GREAT LESSONS FOR ALL VIEWERS & ALMOST ALL AGES...
The lessons in this DVD are clearly communicated but there is a genius about Benjamin Franklin that is intriguing.  I have to date watched this DVD 12 times and I'm still extracting powerful revolutionary principles.  You just will not believe the things you will gain from watching this DVD but I challenge you to try.  As an educator of American History I was able to gain the following:

*Historical accuracy was excellent!
*Costumes and scenary reflected the times of Benjamin Franklin.
*University professors who made guest appearances was wonderful.
*Video production by Twin Cities Public TV was excellent
*Acting was outstandingly superb!
*Ellen Hovde & Muffie Meyer did a great job of producing.

WHAT I EXTRACTED BUT I WON'T TELL IT ALL...
On top of that I extracted many ingenious practical tips I have been applying in my own life that Ben used.  This video inspired me to write a book.

WHAT WILL YOU LEARN?
You will learn where Ben began his life and how going to England changed his perspective.  You will find that Ben offers huge insight in every area from Marketing, to business, to Sales, to Writing and Publishing.  You will gain a historical appreciation as well from Ben's ability to overcome adversity.

I BROKE MY TV FAST TO WATCH THIS ONE
This is one of my all time favorite things to watch and this is coming from a person who has been fasting from TV since 1998 because of all the trash on TV but a great DVD like this one is worth breaking my fast from TV.

1817859,5,B00007KE63,"This PBS documentary traces the epic life of Benjamin Franklin from his humble beginnings in Boston to his worldwide fame as a scientist, writer, Founding Father, and diplomat.  Originally premiered on PBS on November 19-20, 2002, the documentary breaks Franklin's life into three parts:
(1) ""Let the Experiment Be Made"" (1706-1753) looks at how Franklin quickly rose from his humble origins to become a prominent printer and publisher in Philadelphia.  He ""retired"" to become a gentleman of leisure and devote his time to studying the new science of electricity.  His discoveries not only freed the world from the harmful effects of lightning but also made him a major figure on the world stage.  Throughout the series, Franklin's scientific work, from inventing the Franklin stove to charting the Gulf Stream, keep popping up along with their importance at that time.
(2) ""The Making of a Revolutionary"" (1775-1776) finds Franklin moving to London where he ended up in the middle of the growing dispute between England and the American colonies.  The focus is on how this dispute turned Franklin, a loyal subject of the British empire who had his illegitimate son William made the Royal Governor of New Jersey, into a revolutionary who would return home to help draft the Declaration of Independence.  Keep in mind that this is happening in a world where getting a message back and forth across the Atlantic took weeks if not months.
(3) ""The Chess Master"" (1776-1709) follows Franklin on the most important mission of his long life as he became the American diplomatic representative to France during the American Revolution.  Despite the less than helpful presence of John Adams and others, Franklin manages to play a pivotal role in getting France to recognize the new nation of the United States of America.  After the war, ends his public service helping to create the U.S. Constitution and being the only one of the Founding Fathers to actively campaign against the institution of slavery.
Narrated by Colm Feore, this documentary features Dylan Baker as the young Franklin and Richard Easton as the older version.  The major strength of the production is that it relies heaving upon Franklin's own writings and those of his contemporaries, which are performed by Baker, Easton and other actors addressing the camera.  Easton especially does a marvelous job of catching the wisdom behind Franklin's wit and even his righteous anger when somebody gets on his bad side.  The result is that Easton ranks with Howard de Silva (""1776"") in the first rank of those who have portrayed Franklin on screen.  There are also talking heads, such as Gordon Wood (whose ""The Americanization of Benjamin Franklin"" I read last year), who providing historical insights and perspective.  But mostly you are going to remember what Ben tells you (e.g., the story of paying too much for the whistle), and have a much better sense of both the man and his accomplishments after spend 3  hours watching this documentary.
There is a short featurette on the making of the series and some program ""outtakes,"" which consist of more examples of talking heads, primarily Franklin, reciting various writings (apparently the people at PBS are so sheltered they do not know these would be better characterized as deleted scenes, or at least excerpts).  As is the case with most PBS DVD Videos you can go to their excellent website for ""Benjamin Franklin"" and find a Teacher's Guide and other Resources for teachers and students to learn more about Franklin.",1115769600,11,3531,5.053356282271945
1817860,5,B00007KE63,"This is one of my favorite documentaries to date. The acting is top notch for the young Franklin, the elder Franklin, and others in Franklin's life. Re-enactments and unique footage fill the majority of scenes instead of musty paintings or drawings. The whole documentary has a fresh and witty feel.
What impressed me most, though, was how clearly and informatively the documentary sets out the life of Franklin, his character, and his effect on early America and the world. Not only is he revealed as a genius and a founding father, he is shown as a humorous man and the quintessential American. Franklin displays all the unique traits that define the American character, from the refusal to accept social status as fixed by birth to the constant search for scientific truths.
Two parts, both excellent. The documentary should have great appeal to any age with even the vaguest interest in American history.",1059004800,21,908,4.980263157894737
