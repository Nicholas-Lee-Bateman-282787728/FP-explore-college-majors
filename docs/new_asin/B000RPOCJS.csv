2874680,5,B000RPOCJS,"This is not a movie! Goosebumps was a television series in the mid 1990s that aired on Fox and was based on the book written by R.L. Stine! The series was filmed in Canada on a low-budget, which explains the bad acting and special effects.

There earlier DVD releases, like this one, were horrible as they don't contain menus and the picture quality is slightly below average.

Greg and his friends decide to break into the old Coffman house in Say Cheese and Die. Greg finds an over-shaped camera and takes several pictures with it. He later realizes that the camera's pictures can tell the future before it happens.

In Say Cheese and Die ... Again, Greg wrote a story for his English class about the evil camera, but his teacher gives him a big ""F."" Now Greg has to dig up the camera to proof that his story is real.

The episodes were filmed a year apart. The actor that played Greg in the first episode plays Greg's older brother in the second, probably because of the actor's sudden growth spurt.

These episodes are some of the creepiest out of the Goosebumps series!",1346198400,6,1074,4.515463917525773

The story is funny and makes you wonder who dunnit and I thought it was appropriate for the intended age group. I liked the main character and the supporting cast (one of them truly reminded me of my oldest son.) I thought the reactions to having the camera pointed at you were fun.
