8616252,3,B00FK9VMVM,"This movie should not have even been called once upon a time in mumbai bc it does not follow the style of the first one at all!! There was so many one liners that instead of being brilliant it was way over the top!! Akshay's character was cheesy and overdone and who could take him seriously with all those one liners!! Imran's character was also cheesy and overdone again same with the one liners but his wasn't quite as irritating as Akshay's character!! Sonakshi sparkles in this movie and she was the really only redeeming thing about it, that and the songs... THe songs in this movie are fantastic!! For that it gets 3 stars.... I think it had the potential to be better and a good movie but the writing was terrible and just too much... I'm a fan of all three actors, i think they did the best they could in this movie and it's not bc of them that this movie flopped!! I still bought the movie knowing all this bc i did enjoy the love story between Sonakshi and Imran and every once in awhile can handle seeing the over the top cheesy.... so check it out before you buy if your not sure which way to go! :)",1398902400,,1112,4.225352112676056
8616253,5,B00FK9VMVM,For this movie I'll give 5 stars for it with best known Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar as a main role in it. Lots of action in this movie compare to the first one.,1397779200,,161,3.909090909090909
8616254,4,B00FK9VMVM,"I really like all three leads -- Akshay Kumar, Imran Khan, and Sonakshi Sinha. There is great chemistry there. Classic two men love the same woman story. And some really great music -- I have downloaded three of the songs to my iPod.",1393804800,,233,4.441860465116279
8616255,3,B00FK9VMVM,"This review is from: Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai Dobaara (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) (Audio CD)
Once upon a time takes off right from the point when the previous one ended. Emraan Hashmis role now essayed by Akshay Kumar who is the king of the underworld, he lives in a mansion in a far off land- Oman.
Shoaib (Akshay Kumar) is the new don. He is needy, crazy and vicious with a swagger that accompanies his chain smoking and retro suits, All the time mouthing lines of wisdom and common sense. An botched attack on him prompts him to return to Mumbai. He bumps into Jasmine ( Sonakshi Sinha) and his instantly smitten by her ways. He however does not realise that his trusted aide Aslam ( Imran Khan) also loves her. She rejects his advances and turns him to vengeful lunatic....
Its the 80's and its retro time, we see ambassadors, Maruti cars and fashion reflects the time period. The theme is Romance and not rivalry for the underworld. There are traces of turf wars between Rawal ( Mahesh Manjrekar) and Shoaib but love for a woman is the cause of violence.
OUATIM has a great first half thanks to some great writing and dialogues- Machchar jiska khoon peeta hai ussi ke haathon marta hai- Thank you Rajat Arora. Although the writing is great, I felt that these dialogues were forced throughout the film.
The love story and the ensuing conversations that follows between Aslam and Jasmine were fun to watch. The second half was long and boring with the song Bismillah served up for no reason. The last hour was a drag for me but the monologue by Akshay Kumar at the end was a treat.
Performances were great and Akshay Kumar although at times seems to be over the top is good. He has the best lines and the meatier role. Imran Khan was a misfit and tries hard to play a ruffian, it just did not suit him. Sonakshi Sinha as the love interest looks pretty and gives a neat performance. Sophie Choudry is scintillating in a brief role.
The prequel had sensational music, music that I still listen too but this soundtrack falters. The only songs that I liked was Yeh Tune Kya Kiya and Chugliyan both great numbers.
The dialogue writing is what makes the movie awesome- each line is superb and that credit should go to Rajat Arora. Direction and the editing in the second half could have been tighter and the climax explosive but that doesn't happen. I thought that this was a decent one time watch primarily because of the writings. one question vexed me though- Why did they change ""a"" to ""ay"" in the title of the film. Three stars. 8/15/2013",1387065600,,2552,4.525974025974026
