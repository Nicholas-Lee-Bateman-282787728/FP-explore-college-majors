8238010,4,B0010KO41A,"THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT was released in 1983. This GOODTIMES videotape is typical of that company's product: recorded at LP speed, with a slightly degraded picture and linear mono soundtrack.

E.G. Marshall hosted an hour (minus commercials) program from the very room where John Kennedy held 61 press conferences during his presidency, an average of one every couple of weeks. The only lengthy break in press briefings was a two month period after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

At the time of this taping, little in the room had changed in 20-plus years. Even plush theater seats provided the media seemed to have their original upholstery.

As demonstrated in these b&w video excerpts, John Kennedy, the pioneer of such regular briefings, was supremely presidential: at times very serious, at others charming or playful. Watching JFK's interactions with an always polite group of newspeople is just a pleasure, and it's an aching reminder of what was taken away from us on 11/22/63.

Kennedy often relied on one lady reporter for comic relief. Looking peculiar in a '20s-style bucket hat, Portland, ME.'s May Craig posed questions about obscure things, like an eight-lane thruway that would disrupt one of her pet projects, and JFK was always ready with a smile and a quip that broke up the room.

A favorite moment is when he's asked about public comments that Pierre Salinger is too inexperienced as press secretary. Salinger slumps in his seat at these words and glowers. JFK lightly fends off this attack by saying it was also reported that Pierre's main function is to raise the president's Gallup Poll rating. ""Having done that..."" he mischievously adds, as Salinger breaks into a smile and the room fills with chuckles, ""...Mr. Salinger will now concentrate on better communications.""

THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT is highly recommended, even in this lesser quality form, for all who fondly recall John Kennedy, also for anyone interested in 20th Century American political history.",1339891200,,1983,5.123839009287925
