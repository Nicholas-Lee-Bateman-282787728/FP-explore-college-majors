952272,1,630503768X,The was no content and no point to this documentary/ movie. Stupid indulgence by the director of another movie who thought he could make a movie out of the outtakes of the original. Meaningless Rubbish,1167782400,6,201,4.771428571428571
952273,5,630503768X,"In this documentary, British filmmaker Ron Peck reflects on his effort to make the 1970s gay cult classic film NIGHTHAWKS. But this documentary is a multi-layered thing. It is Peck's personal perspective of coming to terms with his own homosexuality as a youth; it is a reflection on the emergence of a gay liberation movement in the US and Britain; it is an expose on censorship, sexual politics, and the sexual mores of the gay community. Not having seen NIGHTHAWKS, I found STRIP JACK NAKED a little hard to follow at first. Peck's style for this film is to have a running commentary (himself presumably) to a rather free-floating collage of images and film clips. I wanted to know who in the film clips was supposed to be representing Peck/the narrator. But not knowing seems, in part, to be the point. In some cases the ""I"" is a picture of Peck as a school boy; in others, it is the ""school teacher"" character from NIGHTHAWKS (who, of course, was based on Peck...so the distinctions are moot). I felt as though this blending of personas was a statement in itself: while each gay person in the 60s and 70s travelled a lonely path to self-discovery, their exerpiences were astonishingly similar. Because NIGHTHAWKS was Peck's first feature-length film and funding sources were few and far between, it took many years to come to completion. And Peck notes that by the time the film was released, the gay liberation movement has already had its effect. Large scale discos catering to gay clientele had replaced the smokey little clubs that were part of Peck's coming out experience and which served as the primary setting of NIGHTHAWKS. Peck gives the viewer (especially gay viewers) much to think about. It is a reflection on dark times but is neither dismal nor depressing. His comments about himself as a gay person and filmmaker are frank and clear-eyed. He is neither narcissistic nor self-flagelating. He is both rational and wise.

A nice treat on this DVD is the short film ""What Can I Do with a Nude Male."" This film, too, consists of running commentary (from a fictional physique photographer) over a series of images (in this case, of the model in various cliched, masculinist attires and poses). The monologue is brilliant, on the level of Alan Bennett. And the model...well, let's just say you'll want to keep your remote handy.",1153094400,21,2342,4.811414392059554

952420,3,630503768X,interesting historical accounting.  I don't really have much to say about it in terms of being a film besides that it was worth a watch to see the story.  It was mostly narrated with some parts that had audio to go with the video which might turn some ppl off to this film.  The video quality is older but not too big a deal and the audio towers above some recent gay films i have seen on amazon recently.,1453075200,3,405,4.10126582278481

7881135,4,630503768X,"After watching Nighthawk again I decided to watch this film and thought it was interesting to see how hard it was to make this film at the time and how hard everyone worked only to find they were a day late and a dollar short because the gay movement had gone further than the film depicts.  Whereas bathhouses and unmarked bars are a large part of the original film by the time it was released discos and parades had taken over.
This is a piece of gay history and for that alone this is a must see film.",1517961600,2,504,4.142857142857143

7881144,2,630503768X,"I remember watching the original work  this is based upon, ""Nighthawks"", about a closeted schoolteacher in England, shortly after it was made in 1978. Because of the dearth of other serious gay films at the time, it was notable, but frankly, quite dreary and boring. Seeing this ""redux"" made in 1991 makes it clear why. Ron Peck, the filmmaker, seems never to have actually gotten over the trauma of finding himself to be ""queer"", and his views on being gay in England remain stubbornly suburban. Most of the rest of us move on. He seems stuck. Considering that there were more radical (even heroic)  pictures with gay content made in Britain before his (Lindsay Anderson's ""If"", Ken Russell's ""Women in Love"", John Schlesinger's ""Sunday, Bloody Sunday"", Jack Gold's ""The Naked Civil Servant ""), his little coming out story is hardly as seismic as he believes it to be.  Besides which,(and this is the kicker) this retrospective and rehashing proves, well,  he's really not all that talented.",1462233600,2,992,4.957831325301205
