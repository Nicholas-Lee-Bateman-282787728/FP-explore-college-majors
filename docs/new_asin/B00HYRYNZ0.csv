from around 1975 thru to 1986 when the Cocaine smugglers were caught & arrested
you get new interviews with some of the Lawyers, newspaper reporters, Ex/retired cops, Ex miami police officers
and others that were involved
and also interviews with some of the Drug smugglers themselves well the smugglers that were still alive to be interviewed anyway
so obviously not all the smugglers in the Doco were interviewed cause most of them were assassinated
by the Columbia Drug cartel when they were released from Prison
very very detailed & frightening Doco i was Glued the whole time, the Doco was over before i knew it, so much info
this Documentary was first released on DVD back in 2008 with only 120min Duration
along with some extras like Deleted scenes
well the films Producer/Director Billy Corben reissued the Documentary again about 2 years ago COCAINE COWBOYS RELOADED
with 30mins of extra scenes inserted back into the original 121min feature which makes the total runtime 151mins
plus another 14mins of Deleted scenes as a special feature/extra
this new reissue is available on blu-ray or DVD with the same 1:78:1 ratio & the same run time 152mins
with the same extras which are 14mins of Deleted scenes
so whether you get the blu-ray or the DVD of COCAINE COWBOYS RELOADED you get the same content anyway
5 stars for both the blu-ray & dvd versions based on so many interesting stories",1464048000,,1506,4.863813229571984
