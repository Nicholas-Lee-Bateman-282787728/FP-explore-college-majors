8148748,2,B000J2813M,Hoped this video would serve as an educational tool for people who are unfamiliar with the USA ... giving pictures and skeletal information about the country... NO SUCH LUCK.  It is low level scenic aerial photography without commentary.  Would not recommend to a friend.,1266364800,3,271,5.136363636363637
8148749,3,B000J2813M,Was disappointed in the quality of the video camera used as some of it was not too clear-- Disappointed to see on large screen TV-- Probably OK on a laptop size screen--Some of the scenes are repeated in the DVD of almost the same name--EJV,1239840000,4,240,4.355555555555555
