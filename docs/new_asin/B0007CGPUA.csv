8046659,4,B0007CGPUA,"Despite carrying over many of the same creative personnel from Harry Kupfer's Bayreuth ""Ring"" (Teldec), this is hardly a case of deja vu. For his Barcelona staging of ""Das Rheingold,"" Kupfer and set designer Hans Schavernoch have made the World Ash Tree the centerpiece, in place of the Road of History. Its roots dominate the Rhine and Niebelheim scenes and its branches reach almost to Valhalla. However, Kupfer struggles with making the stage action work as strenuously as any other director, giving rise to some exasperating failures of basic stagecraft (Freia has to run into the giants' arms to be ""captured."") In this respect, Kupfer's earlier version, Otto Schenck (DG), Patrice Chereau (Philips) and even Herbert von Karajan's one-off film (DG) get higher marks. At least Kupfer and Schavernoch make capital use of the Liceo's stage elevators, showing the descent into and return from Niebelheim, as well as revealing Erda sitting in the bowers of the World Ash. Perhaps the singing provides compensation ...

Well, yes and no. Except for Wolfgang Rauch's Donner, the secondary gods need not detain us. Francisco Vas is an energetic Mime and, looking like bonafide giants, Kwangchoul Your (Fasolt) and Matthias Hoelle (Fafner) cope manfully with the robot-like costumes -- they really resemble giants -- and sing about as well as any Fasolt/Fafner duo on video and better than some. The Rhinemaidens make lovely sounds but Andrea Bonig is an ordinary Erda. Linda Finnie (Kupfer/Teldec) and Stephanie Blythe (LePage) retain Fricka supremacy, while Birgitta Svenden (Kupfer/Teldec and Schenck) continues to hold the palm as Erda.

Gunther von Kannen is a recidivist from Kupfer I and his vocalism has changed little. While we may have been too quick to dismiss him as a stopgap 20 years ago, ""Ring"" cycles have come and gone on video and he's still tops in complete cycles. Eric Owens (LePage) and Ekkehard Wlaschiha (Schenck and Lehnhoff/EMI ... if you can find it) are content to coast along on apt vocal endowments, while Hermann Becht (Chereau) is rankest Bayreuth Bark. Ergo, apologies and an upgrade for Herr von Kannen. Graham Clark's metallic tenor cuts through the orchestra like a buzzsaw and his interpretation of Loge is essentially the same as at Bayreuth, which is A Good Thing. Lastly but not least, Falk Struckmann is a bel canto-oriented Wotan -- but so are James Morris (Schenck) and Bryn Tercel (LePage), especially Morris, while the Karajan film catches Thomas Stewart in prime estate. Morris is perhaps the most impressive of the four in characterization and sings the part with almost insolent ease. Bertrand de Billy leads the proceedings in solid Kapellmeister fashion.

If choosing a ""Rheingold"" for a novice viewer, I would probably select Karajan/DG, whose cast is not only telegenic across the boards -- Fassbaender, Altmeyer, Schreier, Stewart, etc. -- but is vocally up to all their roles, including the best Alberich on video, Zoltan Kelemen, who just nips von Kannen at the finish line. (Also, certain endemic staging problems are finessed better on film than a stage production can do.) If you're looking to assemble a complete cycle, the Schenk production makes a good jumping-off point, although the balance of the cycle has Brnnhilde and Siegfried problems, so you may be jumping off into an abyss. Execrably sung, TDK's Stuttgart production is a non-starter and need not detain us.

Having done that, you might want to explore the quite different visions of Kupfer I or Kupfer II (Opus Arte), although Struckmann's superiority to John Tomlinson (Kupfer I) gives the later ""Rheingold"" a sizable edge. As for the Chereau production, that really is strictly for adherents of *regietheater*, as most of the singing is best not dwelt upon. Confusing much?",1491350400,2,3794,5.144246353322528
8046660,3,B0007CGPUA,"I am not a veteran watcher of Wagner operas on DVD.  I am a listener primarily and consider myself more knowledgeable than most about Wagner and his music.  I am surprised that no reviewer seem to object to what I consider to be bizarre costumes and staging in this production.  Perhaps I am not attuned to the cosmic implications of the many things I don't understand -- why is Wotan's costume apparently growing hair that matches his real hair? why is Alberich wearing a gold lame suit coat? what are the strange glasses that Wotan and Alberich are wearing, to say nothing of the apparatus on the Nibelungs? why are the gods running back and forth like they are playing the children's game of ""Red Rover""?  why are the three gods grouped together around Wotan's spear like Dorothy and her comrades about to follow the yellow brick road?  why are they falling on the floor and crawling around? why is Loge blowing his nose and throwing the handkerchief away?  And I almost forgot the Transformer costumes the Giants were wearing and the cardboard hammer of Thor.  True, the action did seem to flow, but.....I found the voices to be quite satisfactory most of the time with acting non-existent except for Loge who was superb!",1404604800,,1225,4.696261682242991
8046661,3,B0007CGPUA,"Oh,give me a break! Can ""ill focused voices"" sing three complete Wotans without to show any kind of fatigue by chance?On the contrary,I listen this complete,very uneven Ring production and I'm sure Struckmann is a strong reason 'cause this dvd set isn't completely irrelevant one. Interesting Kupfer's ideas here,but some whims like Loge and Alberich resembling Las Vegas' Siegfried&Roy,that Dracula's fiance Erda(what a poor singing to this character!)and I'm not sure about these Power Rangers Fafner/Fasolt and gods dancing a ""minuetto"" at the time they should be ""over the rainbow"".Orchestra has serious problems in its horn/wagner tubas section and de Billy gets well ""Siegfried"" and ""Walkre"" (in despite that weak eight Brnhilde's sisters)but shows his lack of affinities with Wagner scores on ""Gotterdmmerung"",the lowest performance by his crew. Pick one or two parts of this set and keep your money to Bayreuth production reissue.",1128729600,2,938,5.520833333333333
8046662,3,B0007CGPUA,"I was definitely looking forward to this release.  But after watching it, I have to put it in the ""good but....."" category.

The good -- I liked the production.  It was very high tech and moved fluidly with none of those ""this doesn't make any sense"" ideas.  The Alberich, Loge and Mime with excellent.  If you know the Bayreuth Kupfer version, you'll see similarities in the production and direction.  And I do agree with another reviewer who thought there was much clarity around the story line.

The not so good - the rest of the singers were acceptable but no shining stars and I'm just not sure what to make of Struckmann's Wotan.  While I think the notes are there, too often his tone sounded unfocused and forced.  But the biggest problem for me was the overall lack of real emotion.  Yes, it can be ""cold"" as another reviewer stated but then there is an emotion that is conveyed even with that -- too often this performance was bland and the characters just not convincing.  Given the overwhelming emotion in the Bayreuth Kupfer production I don't know what happened here.  Were the singers just poor actors, was it the fault of the director OR was it the orchestra direction?  De Billy's conducting was lackluster at best -- it wasn't a Solti supercharge, it wasn't a von Karajan sense of musical line, it wasn't anything distinctive, it was........just there.  I certainly hope the orchestra has replaced some of their horn section since this performance.  I know it was live but there were more flubs in this one performance than should ever be acceptable.

All that being said, would I still buy it, yes.  If you love Wagner, you get just about everything you can, the good, the bad, and the somewhere in between.  And on a separate note, that's why I'm fascinated by the Stuttgart ""Ring"" on TDK.  I absolutely hate and love some of the concepts in it but they challenge my thinking and many of the singers gave  supercharged emotional performances.  I would have given the Barcelona performance a 3 1/2 stars but I can't.  Okay, now it's onward to Die Walkure and I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it will get better.",1117670400,13,2132,4.644385026737968
8046663,5,B0007CGPUA,"I was very fortunate to have bought the video of Harry Kupfer's memorable 1988 Beyreuth RING.  This has been most unfortunately delisted and should be reissued.  This production is based on another version Kupfer did for the Deutsch Staatsoper Berlin.

Since ""Das Rheingold"" is the Prologue of THE RING, and since the other three productions are not yet available, it is hard to see how it will develop.  It is of necessity a very cold production since Siegmund and Sieglinde have not yet introduced love into the Cycle.  All the characters are egocentric and self-serving -- except possibly for the Giants; and this is very clear in this production.  I would hope that Falk Struckmann who plays Wotan warms up his voice in the next two productions, but for this one, the cold tones in his voice are most appropriate.  His acting matched his voice.

Gunter von Kannen as Alberich stole the production for me.  His singing and acting are impeccable, and I almost felt sorry for him when he was stripped of his gold and the Ring; his prior swagger, bragging and bullying notwithstanding.  He was Alberich in the 1988 Kupfer RING, as was Graham Clarke who turned in a very good performance as Loge.  The Rhinemaidens (cockteasers all) were also very good.

As with the 1988 production, the scenery is effectively abstract and, because of the extensive stage mechanics, very fluid with no need to  pause between scenes.  Bertrand de Billy's musical direction is also excellent.  And, as usual,  Opus Arte has produced a technically superb DVD.

Until whoever has the rights to the Kupfer 1988 RING and rereleases it, this is the best production of Das Rheingold currently available.

Although ""Die Walkure"" has been released, Amazon has not seen fit to obtain it as yet (April 20).  They should!!",1113868800,22,1792,4.874172185430464
8046664,5,B0007CGPUA,What a fine show this is!  Here we have a production that really adds to one's understanding of the ring and is gripping. The singing and conducting are more than adequate but not all have been to every reviewer's liking. Some thought Loge and Albrecht particularly well done and the Wotan somewhat weak. Others completely reversed this judgement. For me all presented refreshingly new ideas about their characters and all were well sung and well acted. Of course there are faults. The opera is spread over two disks and changing disks requires reprograming.  But then the sound is excellent.,1113696000,12,592,4.96969696969697
