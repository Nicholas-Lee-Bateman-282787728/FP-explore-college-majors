8246251,3,B0012JJOB4,"Partly Cloudy offered nice visual as far as some of the principal characters. However, the dialogue, the acting and the setting appeared, at times, too stiff. It's one thing to act, but to become that character, and not an actor portraying a character makes all the difference to the overall quality and performance of a production.",1438905600,,332,4.946428571428571

8246254,5,B0012JJOB4,"Although this was obviously a low budget movie, I think they did as great a job as they could in acting. I highly recommend.",1364947200,,124,4.208333333333333
8246255,2,B0012JJOB4,"All in all, given the budget, it wasn't totally bad.  On the other hand, it wasn't totally good either.  I agree with ovah that the acting wasn't great but I actually think Mello was the worst.  Overall the girls did better than the men with maybe the exception of the actor who played Derrick. The actress who played Fran was the standout, in my opinion.  She just happens to also be the girlfriend of the director.  Unfortunately for her, the parts between her character and Keon's character Rick was inconsequential and didn't add anything to the movie.  It seemed out of place and more like filler material.  And then there's the awkward ""love scene"" between Ray and Darnell. Funny enough, the director mentions this in the behind the scenes footage as if they actually did something.

It's quite obvious that the actor John is straight and didn't want to commit fully to the kiss between the two, so the camera men shoot them from the top looking down on them.  John is a good looking guy, no doubt, but has to step it way up on the acting side.

All in all, with the sound glitches, editing, underdeveloped story, soap opera/porn/gospel music, and marginal acting, I still won't quite give it a 1 star.  That was saved for another movie because there's far worse that I've seen.",1301788800,2,1284,4.612334801762114
8246256,4,B0012JJOB4,"I totally enjoyed this film, it has a great story line that truly fits into today's lifestyle for Men of Color and Same Gender Loving Relationships. Each character brings a unique and very entertaining part to the film. Like a good book it is well written.",1292976000,,256,4.586956521739131
8246257,1,B0012JJOB4,"this was poor acting, writing, directing and overall production was atrocious!...I'm sorry its sad as a fellow african american to be downgrading our own material but WE MUST DO BETTER!! Partly cloudy was more like a TSUNAMI in BAD MOVIE PRODUCTION...from poor acting, I mean YOU got to be kidding me with the melodramatic acting and over play on theatrics!! clearly nobody had any acting classes!!..furthermore One of the co-stars the gay lead character seemed quite familiar to me...could it be that he is known as Mello in the gay porn industry!!..Yes they cast a porn star in this flick and actually he provides some much needed entertainment in the movie with his slick delivery and quite comfortable presence on screen unfortunately his costars need more time in front of the camera!! his love interest the supposedly straight married guy is pretty hot and is quite the eye candy but his acting is minimal good at the least not that we care about his acting we were too busy looking at that hot body!!..The sound production people need to be stoned for that crap!! one minute the sound was muffled and low the next all loud and screechy!! sign of poor sound mixing!!..Directing was just a disaster with actors faces being cut out of shots and close-ups!! some zooms were not cleared out and some shots were blurry!!..atrocious..The music was all melodramatic reminisce of a bad soap opera!!..The writing was all over the place and whoever worked on the continuity should be thrown off a  cliff because in one scene they forwarded the action 3 years later but than expected us to believe that things where just where they were at three years before how corny!! Get Real!..especially the envelope pictures scene!! LOL",1285372800,5,1721,4.873720136518771
