1882877,5,B00009B8G7,"It is great.  They watch it over and over.

I actually like it despite not particulary liking Cailoiu",1120521600,4,101,4.555555555555555
1882878,5,B00009B8G7,"I think Caillou is a great way for kids to learn how to express their emotions.  Some days Caillou gets to do what he wants and others he has to respect mommy and daddy's needs.  I also enjoy seeing how the parents react to Caillou with patience and understanding.  There is some whining and tantrums from Caillou, but overall it's a great tool for kids.  Caillou is a typical 4 year old.  I find the show entertaining and by watching it with my son, we often pretend we are the characters and act out the scenes.  Really a lot of fun!  I definitely recommend this video to kids 2 and up.",1112140800,8,588,4.243243243243243
1882879,4,B00009B8G7,"Yes! I can't stand Caillou! (Pronounced KAH-you) But I give this DVD 4 stars because my 19 month old daughter LOVES it.  And when I say LOVES it, I don't just mean she'll sit and watch it when I put it on, I mean she BEGS me to put it on.  We can be sitting and watching the news or the Simpsons and she'll wander in and say ""Caillou tv?""  Our daycare provider lets the kids watch it on PBS and she had to teach my daughter that when the credits come on, that means the show is OVER!! ""Caillou ALL Done!""

That being said, this is a good DVD for the toddler-to-preschool set.  Like all the Caillou material that I have seen (we also own Caillou's Treasure Hunt), the messages are basic and not condescending, the relationships and stories between characters are realistic and not preachy, and Caillou does real-life stuff like take a train trip (he's excited at first but gets scared when the HUGE train pulls in, then has fun exploring with Daddy), and decide what toys he might sell at a yard sale (""But then I won't have any to play with!"").  And between the animated Caillou segments are puppet characters and ""music videos"" of real kids doing the kinds of things that Caillou does in the cartoons.

It's also a fairly long DVD.  I haven't let my daughter watch the whole thing straight through, but it seems to be over an hour long.  And she stays engrossed for 20 minutes at a stretch: long enough to get a load of laundry done or prepare dinner!

But PLEASE don't make ME watch it anymore!!!  The theme song is just so catchy....",1092096000,21,1536,4.3543859649122805

1882902,1,B00009B8G7,"Until now, I've never had a single complaint about my near-perfect three year old. From sleeping through the night at 6 weeks of, giving up bottles and his crib and moving to his own room - even taking baths and going to bed every night without a single complaint and potty training and reading on his own at 2.

UNTIL CAILLOU.  And I'm not joking. This isn't a joke review. This is a serious complaint.

That obnoxious little brat, Caillou, in just two episodes, has my son WHINING ""I can't!!"" to EVERYTHING he is asked to do. ""Time to get out of the tub, sweetie,"" I tell him. ""I caaaaaaannnn't."" He whines in this horrible squeal. I had NO IDEA where this abhorrent behavior came from until I caught THREE SECONDS of this horrible show on tv.

My won was watching intently and I said ""turn the tv off please."" And to my horror, he dropped to the floor, and started whining over and over ""I can't!  I can't"".

I wanted to throw up.  No shock- this horrible excuse for a television show has been PERMANENTLY banned from our home. I will tell every parent I know of this god -awful excuse for an ""educational program"".

My son has caught glimpses of sponge bob (crude), power rangers (physical fighting) and even half an hour of gremlins (not in my presence, but I found out he saw the most gruesome parts) and had ZERO reaction to these things - he didn't karate chop our house cats, or imitate any of the crude humor on sponge bob....but in a mere TWO MINUTES of ""CAILLOU"" my son immediately picked up that petulant little Bart's HORRIBLE incessant whine and his ""I can't"" crap that he spews every time he is asked or told to do ANYTHING.

BY FAR the worst children's show I've ever seen.  PBS should be paying for a professional to help me fix this behavior (and a trip to the spa to relax my nerves after listening to the whining I'd never had to deal with before ""CAILLOU"". Flat out AWFUL.

However, we bought this DVD specifically because the description says the language is in BOTH English AND FRENCH.  We bought several Caillou movies that listed English/French ability.  Unfortunately we can't figure out *HOW* to make the movie sound in French.  Other movies that list similar ability (i.e. Dora movies) have the option to change the language in the menu options.  This is not an option in the Caillou movies.  Does anyone know *HOW* to watch these Caillou movies in French?  Thanks!!",1345593600,,572,4.895833333333333

The puppets are horrid. I can't imagine what the producers of this show were thinking. There is a tremendous discrepancy between the wholesome and sweet tone of the cartoon and these awful (sarcastic) puppets. It's so disappointing, I want to send it back.",1333497600,,463,4.860759493670886

However, I have to honestly say that I have never seen, nor never wish to see again, the multiple silly (read: idiotic) segments that take place between Caillou episodes. Dancing children with someone singing (sounds like the person who voices Caillou), a little girl going on a car ride with her mother, etc.

My daughter kept coming over to me and asking ""Where's Caillou? I wanted to watch Caillou?""

I wanted to say ""Well, honey, Santa obviously messed up big time with this one...""

The stories themselves are interesting and educational. My only grouse is the puppet segment where we have Caillou's stuffed dino, and pet cat Gilbert among others doing their own thing. It is quite annoying, and my daughter doesn't care much for them. I think they've cut those segments out in the more recent Caillou stories on PBS [thank goodness!], but this DVD still has those segments.

However, this DVD (like several other Caillou videos) includes a bunch of ""extra"" content, including poorly written puppet scenes and some annoyingly bad live action.  This extra content (almost 50% of the DVD length) is mixed in-line with the main Caillou episodes, and there's no way to avoid it without manning the remote.  My daughter hates this stuff (as do I), it has little to do with Caillou, and it's meant that she rarely watches this video (we rely on the Tivo).

As a parent I want my child to watch as little video as possible, but when she is going to watch I need to be able to multi-task (shower, cook dinner, etc) -- you can't do any of those things if every 5 minutes you get a call: ""Daddy, come skip the puppets!"".

PBS Kids should label the content of their Caillou DVDs more clearly -- if only 1/2 of a Caillou video is actually Caillou, and if the non-Caillou stuff is mixed in, then the label should say so!
