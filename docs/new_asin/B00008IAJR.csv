1847982,3,B00008IAJR,"This movie is a good culture study that follows the life of a pretty village woman who is married off in an arranged marriage. The families involved are common folk and farmers. The new couple have to live in the mother-in-law's house and they all struggle to make ends meet.  The mother-in-law has borrowed a great deal from the local money lender to pull off the (for them) lavish wedding.  Trouble soon starts between the family and the money lender.  As the woman has more children, the film depicts family life in a poor farming family. Their troubles continue with bad weather, flooding, bad luck on the farm, and continuing problems with the money lender. Bad luck strikes the family numerous times, but the brave woman continues to struggle. The title seems to project the struggles of the poor farmers of India with the struggles of the newly minted nation of India itself. And in the end to survive.

This film takes the Westerner out of their comfort zone and shows that even the poor in America are rich compared to many of the poor in the third world.

1847983,1,B00008IAJR,"DVD does not work, typical of EROS dvd production--failed, or a remake of a film when you want the first version, etc. The Eros version of Mother India I bought does not play on computer or DVD player.  A waste of money.",1299715200,2,220,4.238095238095238
1847984,5,B00008IAJR,I absolutley LOVE this movie! I like to watch a long movie that makes it worthwhile to keep watching and this one shows the joys and sorrows in the life of a young woman until her elderly years. The actors are gorgeous and that little boy should have one an Oscar!,1271808000,,264,4.196078431372549

I only wish there had been subtitles during the music, other than that, I loved it :D",1218931200,,121,4.5
1847987,3,B00008IAJR,"A while ago, I got rid of my VCR and put in a DVD player in my computer.  I re-purchased almost all the films I had in DVD format.

This movie is one of the great classics of world cinema and is a must view.  Why am I rating it only 3 stars?  The DVD transfer is AWFUL.  I sorely regret having given away my VHS copy; it was much better.

Buy the VHS.",1148083200,12,351,3.675675675675676
1847988,5,B00008IAJR,"It's kind of like GONE WITH THE WIND, and it's sort of like THE GOOD EARTH, and even a bit like EAST OF EDEN, but really MOTHER INDIA is its own thing, one of the loci classici of so-called ""Bollywood.""

The young screen star Radha Mitchell (PITCH BLACK, NEVERLAND, MELINDA AND MELINDA) was named after the longsuffering heroine, Radha in this movie, as Scarlett Johanson was similarly named after the heroine of GONE WITH THE WIND.  Perhaps that's why Woody Allen was attracted to them both and employed them in recent films.  He was reaching back into old epic roots and didn't even know it.

Radha is a young maiden in India whose mother entangles her into a scheme whereby a local moneylender would pay for the cost of her wedding, but in the process, like Shylock, he comes to ""own"" the whole family and causes them pain for generations to come.  The mother is not a simpleton, more like a Lillian Gish type, and besides, we get the picture that this is just how things were done back then, and that dowries and fancy weddings were everything to these people.  The action switches to the birth and development of Radha's two little boys, Ramu and Birju, who grow and mature during the film, and struggle against the age-old curse of the moneylender, who nows owns everything (like the carpetbaggers in GONE WITH THE WIND).

The only thing that you've ever seen in Western cinema to compare it to fairly would be Michael Powell's GONE TO EARTH with Jennifer Jones (sometimes called THE WILD HEART).  Jennifer Jones, perhaps Susan Hayward, is the only Hollywood star with emotional power enough to have conveyed, maybe, Radha's metonymic attachment to land and family.  Alas she never got a chance to perform in the cinema of Bombay!  It's all about melodrama, music, dance, spectacle, heart and something else, something that can't be pinned down.  Recommended with a plus sign, and two such signs should you ever have had a mother or a country.",1128556800,11,1949,4.71976401179941
1847989,5,B00008IAJR,"Haunting film and painful portrait of Indian in those fifties. Ferocious critique of the caste's system that rules the life of Indian people through the traps employed by a swindler band to cheat illiterate persons.

A brave film made with honesty, courage and honour, nominated as Best Foreign Film in 1957.",1108339200,5,308,5.03921568627451

7984447,5,B00008IAJR,"The classic Mother India was a remake of Aurat also made by director Mehboob. Yet the movie cast brilliantly with Nargis, new comer Raaj Kumar, Sunil Dutt and Rajinder Kumar. That Nargis was only twenty eight years old when she acted as the mother of grown up sons Birju ( Sunil Dutt) and Rajinder Kumar is astonishing. The melodrama depicting the sad life of exploited small time farmer in rural India was sad. Raaj Kumar's portrayal of Nargis' husband presented a new style of acting, dignified, restrained and tragic. His resonant voice was an effective instrument which he used in so many later films. Color photography, music, acting and dialogues were all of a very high calibre at the time( late fifties). That Nargis later married Sunil Dutt surprised many movie fans in India. But she remained steadfast in the marriage was in character of this great actress who died young.",1417996800,2,883,4.854304635761589

7984449,5,B00008IAJR,"Nargis is wonderful in this movie. It shows the hope and loss in a life. What is also shows is life is not better for the villagers in India now as it was then. The hope shown is hope lost in today's reality.  However for any movies buff who watches the 1940s US movies we are a lost people too. So much potential for both our countries that to see these movies and see the now reality we are much closer to the reality of "" Brazil"" ( the movie) than any hopeful future shown in this movie. It is well worth watching and we all know the plight of Women in India is no better today. Just as here only a few rich women get the dream.",1394841600,,631,3.9296875
