8319978,1,B001LX4BUA,"I tried hard to think of something complimentary to say about this DVD but, alas, I cannot. This is a grade school-level highlight of the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta. Despite the assertions in the product description that this DVD is about hoplite tactics, it is nothing of the sort. There is virtually no description of tactics. At points, the narrator would mention some innovative tactic employed here or there but without any explanation. There is virtually no description of equipment or training. Much of the show is about the navies but, again, without much detail (but the discussion of tactics was at least attempted). The costumes were absurd--even old Hollywood sword & sandal ""epics"" did a better job. Weapons were primarily non-Greek and included a some sharpened poles (as spears) as well as weapons and armor from Roman, Dark Ages and Medieval eras--the scimitars would have looked nice in the hands of Saracens, for example. If I judged from the movie correctly, ancient Greek cavalry must have invented the stirrup and hoplites fought mounted. Some armor defied description--apparently someone got hold of some leather furniture covers cutting then into shapes that only by the most vague associations resembled Greek armor. I had to laugh at sight of the ""hoplites"" walking around with their ""armor"" flapping in the wind. Even the battle scenes were comical--A bunch of guys standing around tapping each other's weapons or shields, some not even bothering to look at the guy they were supposed to be fighting. I assume the computer generated fire and dust was an attempt to obscure this nonsense. The only positive thing I can say is that I stand a small chance of recouping at least some my money at my next yard sale.",1296259200,4,1753,4.986348122866894
8319979,1,B001LX4BUA,"This DVD does not rise to the level one would expect of a documentary seen on any major television channel.  The history and information may have been fairly accurate, albeit simple.  The documentary does not even touch on Hoplite warfare, other than to give a history lesson of some of the battles fought.  Virtually nothing is said of the actual equipping, training, or tactics of the hoplite warrior.  The re-enactment scenes are almost painful to watch.  They are comprised of a hodge-podge of re-enactors wearing clothing, armor and weapons from all sorts of different periods and cultures.  Many of the re-enactors were on horseback, which is the antithesis of the heavily armored hoplite infantrymen.  I have always loved Greek and ancient history, studied it in college, read about it, and even have my own panoply of historically authentic hoplite armor from Daniyal Steelcrafts, but this DVD was so boring and poorly made, I couldn't even finish it to the end.  Its a waste of money and embarrassingly produced.",1273968000,6,1021,5.035714285714286
