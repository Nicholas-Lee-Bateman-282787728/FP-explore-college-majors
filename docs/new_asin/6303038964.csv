7835117,2,6303038964,"What a profound disappointment. Not the movie. No, the original movie was delightful and wicked, but this bowdlerized version has not only excised some of the best scenes (like the protestant hosts asking the tipsy priest for some ""good"" inquisition stories) but leaves far too much of the dialogue untranslated. And half of that is white text against white background and therefore unreadable. My god, what were they thinking? Awful. Just awful.",1435795200,,446,5.208333333333333
7835118,5,6303038964,"When a village postpones its destruction collaborating with their conquerors was the real presage four years before the Nazi occupation in France and similar related behavior patterns in other places in Italy . Jacques Feyder made also the Heroic Kermesse but this is his immortal masterpiece due its inner implications .

In the line of Jean Renoir you may beware of the colossal effort to re-crate on the screen the great works of the masters paintings during carnival time , because as you know your mind and soul are exposed to certain liberties usually not allowed in the rest of the year .

The carnival is one of the last atavistic rest of the collective unconscious .",1101600000,6,675,4.760683760683761
7835119,5,6303038964,"A very funny, saucy French historical comedy, directed by Jacques Feyder, with production assistance by Marcel Carne (who was just on the cusp of his own directorial career)... The story is set in the Flemish town of Boom, in 1616, after the Spanish conquest of the region... When the royal troops announce their intention to billet in the town on their way across country, the village's male population proves so wimpy that it's left up to the womenfolk (led by Francoise Rosay, who is a brilliant actress) to save the town.  It's unfortunate that this video version has such incomplete subtitling -- all the racier jokes get glided over, and the text is kept to a bare minimum.  But even non-Francophone ingoramuses like myself get how clever and bawdy this film is.  Cute.  Apparently, this also had a powerful influence on manhy of the costume dramas which came in its wake.",1039564800,6,878,4.7947019867549665
