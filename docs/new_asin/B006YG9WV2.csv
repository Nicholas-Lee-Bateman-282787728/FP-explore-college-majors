8506468,5,B006YG9WV2,"Now for those who don't already know, Pro Wrestling Guerrera (P.W.G.) is a promotion based out of southern California who holds events monthly/bi-monthly that feature local independent wrestlers along with some names who work for other promotions as well like ROH, DragonGate, and NWA.  Now as a side note, it wasn't shown on the broadcast but mentioned various times in the commentary that they kept having technical issues throughout the night as the audio guy kept playing the wrong themes that kept getting Excalibur upset.

The main event here was for the P.W.G. Tag Team Championships as the Young Bucks defended against Kevin Steen & the returning Super Dragon in a ""Guerrera Warfare"" match that is basically a no holds barred brawl that went both in & out of the ring filled with various weapons such as chairs & tables being used while everyone took hard hits & punishment throughout the match.  Another big match on the card was an 8 person tag match with the Dynasty & Ray Rosas & Peter Avalon vs. the returning B-Boy & Famous B & Chris Kadillak & Candice LaRae in which from the moment that quite frankly had so many sexual & sleazy actions towards Candice LaRae (in a comedic way) from the other team that the audience eventually started the chant ""NO MEANS NO!"" before Candice eventually got her receipts later on while having other moments like Avalon calling out ""the b***h"" & almost getting killed in response.  Other matches include a non-title match with P.W.G. Champion El Generico against international star Dick Togo (WWE fans remember him from Kaientai while he was a member of the Blue World Order in the original ECW) who was on his retirement tour in a match where the fans had so much respect for him that they had a ""Togo!"" chant to counteract the ""Ole!"" chant from Generico, Davey Richards & Eddie Edwards reunite as the American Wolves in a match against the Super Smash Brothers that had some good wrestling along with fun moments like the battle of poses along Eddie's response to both Player Uno & the crowd asking to please not chop him anymore, Chris Hero's surprise return to P.W.G. against Willie Mack in a match that was physical from the start, Future Shock vs. RockNES Monsters that had the Monsters be more aggressive than they usually are, Amazing Red's P.W.G. debut against Roderick Strong in a ""speed vs. power"" match, and T.J. Perkins & Kenny King vs. Fightin' Taylor Boys.

This was a really fun show featuring a bunch of returns & reunions & debuts while also just delivering great action from top to bottom so this is an event worth watching.",1333756800,,2590,4.733924611973393
