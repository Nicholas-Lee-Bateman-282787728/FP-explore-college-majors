7968140,1,B00006G8F2,"Another badly dubbed Mexican import from K. Gordon Murray . . . and a complete stiff. ""The Robot vs. The Aztec Mummy"" (1958) is so devoid of entertainment value that not even ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" could bring it to life. Where's Santo when you really need him?",1477699200,,269,4.625
7968141,5,B00006G8F2,"A ""Must Own"" for any B movie enthusiast.

Best seen in a drive-in movie theater but otherwise not a bad movie.

Fast-paced, excellent plot, good special effects.",1442793600,,161,4.925925925925926

7968143,1,B00006G8F2,"Dr. Krupp (Luis Aceves Castanda) is your typical mad scientist who is hellbent on taking over the world as he steals forbidden treasure from an Aztec temple unleashing an ancient mummy of a king named Popaca (Angel Di Stafani) who goes on the rampage trying tom get his treasure back. In the mean time, the authorities are searching for him and Krupp invents a robot to destroy the mummy.

A totally ridiculous and out of place 1957 Mexican Sci-fi horror clunker with terrible acting, a stupid as hell plot, bad special effects including a laughable robot and of course a character who looks like an early Freddy Krueger. I'm so glad MST3K chose this movie cause it was perfect because this dull and unexciting b-movie is what they needed to riff.",1308787200,,747,4.702290076335878
7968144,1,B00006G8F2,"You might think that with a title like ""Robot Vs the Aztec Mummy"" this would be a terrible film.
You would be correct.",1275696000,,118,4.173913043478261
7968145,2,B00006G8F2,"""Robot vs. the Aztec Mummy"" is a terrible black and white Mexican horror film featuring some of the worst acting, worst plot development, and lamest monsters in film history. The plot combines elements of Mexican history loosely interspersed with typical horror movie plot devices like reincarnation, virgin sacrifices, evil scientists, an ancient mummy, and one of the stupidest robots ever. The sets are awful, the plot holes are enormous, everything is so dark that it's virtually unwatchable, and the climactic fight between the robot and mummy is among the worst choreographed (and slowest paced) I have seen.

Some people may be able to view this as a ""so bad it's good"" movie, but I mostly found it tedious and boring, with insufficient camp value to redeem it. If you think it might be worth a look as a bad-cinephile, go ahead and have a go, but I recommend trying the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version to make it (a bit) more palatable.",1253404800,3,949,4.8580246913580245
7968146,5,B00006G8F2,"The Robot vs. the Aztec Mummy is, in my opinion, one of the most under-appreciated gems in b-horror cinema, and with a decidedly eccentric character rarely achieved in Hollywood productions.  Shot in black and white in 1957, this is a low budget affair that looks much more expensive, and would have been perfect for a slot on late night televisoin back in the 60s: you have a robot possessing a human brain, a mad scientist, and a mummy that is this grotesque, fleshy looking thing--not at all like Universal's ace bandaged menace--which would have given me nightmares had I seen it as a kid!

This movie is FUN, and anybody who takes it more serious than that will no doubt criticize The Robot vs. the Aztec Mummy for its wooden acting and ludicrous plot line (of creating a robot to steal treasure guarded by one bad Aztec mummy!).  This is ENTERTAINMENT, folks! Take the time to sit down and actually watch this film uninterrupted and with an open mind, and you will be charmed and delighted with this film. It has some truly special special effects, and the climactic battle between the hideous Aztec mummy and the highly nuanced performance of an intriguing looking robot are not to be missed!

A true classic and a MUST HAVE for escapist b-movie afficianados!",1211587200,5,1266,4.714932126696833
7968147,1,B00006G8F2,"This movie truly epitomizes the genre of the Mexican B-picture.  This movie is truly awful, in that slightly enjoyable way which leads to a following.

-See ""scientists"" behaving badly!

-Gasp and recoil with fear as you encounter enumerous plot holes and amateur writing!

-You'll laugh so hard when you see the creatures that you will shame the people who made this film from miles away!

Really not as good as other cult classics but still enjoyable.  If you wind up liking this movie you might also check out another Mex B-pic called ""Night of the Bloody Apes""; it's a rung above this pic.",1100304000,5,593,4.70873786407767
