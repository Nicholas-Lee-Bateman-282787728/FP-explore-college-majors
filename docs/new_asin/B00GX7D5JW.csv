6123269,5,B00GX7D5JW,"I always like action movies. These are as good as movies today. Even thow they are outdated the movies did focus on events that could happen in real life even today. Well maybe not so much today,but you never know. The action is why I bought the movies plus when I was brewing up I use to watch reruns of the show.",1395532800,,314,4.080645161290323
6123270,5,B00GX7D5JW,"Get ready for this final season of Steve Austin, with the return of bigfoot and the death probe, will delight fans of the show.",1394841600,,127,4.333333333333333
6123271,4,B00GX7D5JW,"Sadly, this was the last season.  Also, thankfullly it was the last season!  The stories were getting dull and you could see that Lee Major's heart wasn't in it anymore. All in all it was still enjoyable to watch because of the fact that there was still some good episodes with great writing in them.",1394323200,,300,4.4363636363636365
6123272,5,B00GX7D5JW,Now having all 5 seasons of this classic show it is complete. Bigfoot and The Probe return in this last season. Some good two part episodes also. I wish they would of had a last episode in this season to close out the series. Good DVD !!!,1394150400,,238,4.085106382978723
6123273,5,B00GX7D5JW,"I have seen most of the two-part episodes of Six Million Dollar Man Sharks, Deadly Countdown, The Lost Island,  Return of Death Probe, Date with Danger. Lee Majors met Suzanne Somers who portrayed Jenny Frasier on the episode of The Cheshire Project. I have seen Steve Austin's wife Joan Austin not Jamie Sommers on the episode of Target: Steve Austin",1393545600,,351,4.85
6123274,5,B00GX7D5JW,I gave it 5 stars because i love this show and can't wait til season 6 comes out. Its good for all fans of seventies T.V. shows.,1392940800,,128,3.7777777777777777
6123275,3,B00GX7D5JW,"I have had issues with the Six million Dollar Man, The A-Team, Knight Rider, And buck Rogers In The 25th Century.  guess What? They are all released by universal Studios! They only care about quantity, but not quality... I am very disappointed by the poor quality packaging of Six million Dollar man Season 4 as well.  Stacked DVD's is very poor.  Thank heavens I will not be buying anymore universal Studio's DVD's TV Series after the Six million Dollar Man & Bionic Woman 3 movies come out.  IF they come out.

Okay, back to the review... in this season, we get to see classic episodes such as:

Big Foot V, Return Of Death Probe part 1 & 2... These are the very reason why I bothered purchasing this set.  When they divided up the characters to never appear on either show during the last Seasons of each show, and why? Because they said no bionic woman on six million dollar man season 5 and no six million dollar man on bionic woman season 3.  The shows were even on two different networks, another reason the show got cancelled.

I enjoyed the death probe part 1 and 2 from Season 4 better than return of death probe part 1 and 2 on season 5 even if they added two spinning blades and a different and possibly more deadly probe.  Ken Johnson has a talent for quality TV programming such as the Six Million Dollar Man & bionic Woman And The Incredible hulk.  I own all of these.  I think he also Did V the series, the older series to which I own those too.

I originally gave this set two stars, but I have a workable set now which I gave it a mercy 3 stars which is more than universal studios deserves since they don't deliver quality.",1392768000,2,1642,4.309446254071661
6123276,5,B00GX7D5JW,"I loved the series when I was growing up.  Brings back good memories just sitting and watching it.  Even if that is all you get, it is worth buying it.",1390867200,4,151,4.0
6123277,5,B00GX7D5JW,"This is one great fun TV show. And was when TV was worth watching.

He plays  a crooked Russian general out to test a new anti-aircraft mobile rocket launcher.  This season has a lot of great two part episodes and doesn't let up like many last season shows.  We see Ted Cassidy in his final appearance as Big Foot. You get to see lots of great 70's actors in this one .  It stands up to repeated viewings even if you don't like sci fi.  It has enough to keep you coming back each time to see what happens next.  That's the objective of good writing.  I wish that there were more good shows like this on the air with a hero sets a good example..  You can't say that about a lot of TV shows of today that are in the genre of science fiction.

6123424,5,B00GX7D5JW,"When I was growing up in Albany NY, WAST-13 (ABC Affiliate) was the local station that broadcast the show for maybe the first three years before bumping it off the air, replacing it with The Lawrence Welk Show, on Sunday nights.  I would see commercials air during the week promoting the show, only to see the station never allowed it to air.  So I had to wait 36-37 years to see Seasons 3-5, so even though I grew up with the show the first 2 or 3 seasons, the rest is all new to me!  I never liked the moustache in Season 4, I just didn't think it fit Lee Majors. The Six Million Dollar Man was one of my favorites growing up.  Once I finish the series, its back to purchase The Big Valley Seasons 2 & 3, to see Lee Majors before he gained his bionics!",1400803200,2,754,4.074324324324325

6123431,5,B00GX7D5JW,season 5 was the end of a great show-the end of a great period in my life-those care free days and a simpler time-the Six Million Dollar Man did not disapoint-i enjoyed it just as much today as i did back in the glory days of the 70's-the packaging was great to unlike the season 4 disc stacking blunder-thumbs up to Steve Austin,1397260800,,329,4.238095238095238
6123432,5,B00GX7D5JW,"First off, I'm so HAPPY to 'finally' now have all five seasons of one of the most popular and entertaining t.v. shows from the 1970's. In fact, ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" was not only one of my all-time favorite shows as a kid, but continues to be so all these years later. So on to season 5: Steve's appearance is a bit different this time out. Gone is the cheesy 1970's mustache from season four, while his hair is somewhat longer and his clothes a bit classier. He actually looks more like ""The Fall Guy"" in this season than the Steve Austin character - Ha! O.K., so overall, the writing in season 5 may not be quite as strong or original as in previous seasons, but ........ that doesn't mean that these episodes aren't just as much fun to watch. In particular I love that Steve's old rival / buddy ""Big Foot"" makes a return appearance. Even better (at least for me) is the fact that neither the alien beings nor the Bionic Woman are involved this time. It's just Steve and the Sasquatch.

Season 5 also includes no less than five 2-part episodes, including a particular favorite titled ""Dark Side of the Moon."" In case any of us forgot that Steve Austin was a top notch astronaut, the NASA theme is present in that 2-parter, as well as in a few of the other episodes from this season. My absolute favorite episode though ~ and one that I wish had been a 2-parter ~ deals with a paranormal / psychic theme (Dead Ringer). Oh, and those familiar with Lee's ""Big Valley"" days will recognize a couple of actors from that series who make guest star appearances. Gone this time around is Farrah Fawcett-Majors (who made an appearance in each of the previous four seasons), as well as Steve Austin's gold bracelet (a gift from Farrah). We do see a lot more of Rudy Wells, but unfortunately somewhat less of Oscar Goldman. Of course long time fans of the series know that Richard Anderson was splitting his acting duties between two bionic shows at the same time. Uh, this might very well be one of the reasons why I wasn't a fan of The Bionic Woman. I loved the Oscar Goldman character and particularly enjoyed the Six Million Dollar Man episodes which featured Steve and Oscar working on a case 'together.' So if I could have changed something about season 5, it would have been more screen time for Oscar !!!!

O.K., so on the other side of the coin: There are no bonus items / special features included, which I must admit was somewhat disappointing. It would have been wonderful to have included an interview with Lee Majors and Richard Anderson. It would have been extraordinary if they had been able to include outtakes or behind-the-scenes footage, etc. None of the 5 seasons featured any such interview, unfortunately. I also get the feeling that those involved with the series didn't know that season 5 would be their last (?). Sometimes when a series is coming to an end the cast and crew do something special for the final episode. Instead, we're kind of left hanging ... as there was nothing particularly special or significant about the final episode.

If you were a fan of the series back in the day, or if if you're just becoming a fan now ..... you simply MUST add season 5 to your collection. It's doubtful that I'll ever grow tired of watching this series. In fact, it's the type of show that can certainly be passed down from generation to generation .... as some parents have proven by introducing their own kids to one of the greatest t.v. heroes of the 1970's.",1395532800,22,3481,4.522222222222222
