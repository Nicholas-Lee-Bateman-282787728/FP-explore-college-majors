1) A CALM BEFORE THE STORM:
With Ransik's mutants depleted, the Rangers ponder their past and future as Rangers. Frax's new robot terrorizes the city, but is destroyed by Eric and the Q-Rex
2) END OF TIME PT. 1,2,3
After helping to deliver a baby, Nadira has doubts about hating humans. Frax is captured by Ransik, turned into a mindless robot, and forced into piloting Doomtron against the Rangers. As Eric and the Q-Rex fight Doomtron, Wes tricks the Rangers, and forcefully sends them back to the future for their own safety. Doomtron incapacitates Q-Rex, leaving a injured Eric on the run with help from Wes. The two retreat to the clock tower, which is raided and destroyed. The Rangers take control of their fates, and go back to help Wes. As a team, they destroy Doomtron. Their final battle with Ransik ends with Ransik turning himself in after nearly killing Nadira. The Rangers part ways as the four leave to go back to the year 3000.",1013990400,2,976,4.6473988439306355

7958535,5,B0000633Y9,"Time Force was great, not as good as MMPR or PRIS, but still really good. People who hated this season should wake up to themselves. I absolutely loved it! Go Time Force!",1130025600,,170,4.34375
7958536,5,B0000633Y9,"Though the somewhat scathing review of 'The End of Time' may suggest otherwise, Power Ranger fans will be well-pleased with what the final 4 episodes of last year's Ranger show has to offer.
The plot, which runs cohesively throughout, is about Frax (who betrayed Ransik in the latter episodes) plotting to overthrow the Time Force Rangers (Jason Faunt, Deborah Estelle Philips, Erin Cahill, Kevin Kleinberg, Michael Copon, and Daniel Southworth) and his former master Ransik by creating a massive robot.
Meanwhile, Ransik's daughter, Nadira (Kate Sheldon) has second thoughts about hating humans. After helping to deliver a baby and playing with a couple of kids, she realizes that she's one of them... as well as her father, Ransik.
What follows is an emotion-packed powerhouse, helped by equal doses of acting between Erin Cahill's fierce portrayal of Jen and the man she has grown to love during her visit in the year 2001, Wes Collins (Jason Faunt, who does more than a successful transition from baseball player/model to TV actor). The ending is sweet and powerfully emotional. It certainly isn't up to par with the beautiful finale of ""Power Rangers in Space""'s 'Countdown to Destruction,' parts 1-2; but it comes very, VERY close to at times.
What makes the final 4 episodes ('Calm Before the Storm' and 'The End of Time' pts. 1-3 edited together) much better than they were in separate episode forms is that it plays more like a movie rather than a 4-part episode. It makes it all the more powerful, satisfying and engrossing to watch.
If you hated all the shows after ""Mighty Morphin'"" through ""Power Rangers In Space"", this will make you think that the Ranger franchise has gotten better, not worse, with time.",1036281600,2,1720,4.975694444444445
7958537,4,B0000633Y9,"Power Rangers Time Force is probably the best Power Rangers series there is. I definitely had high hopes for the finale, and for the most part it delivered. We got to see more of the blossoming friendship between the Pink Ranger and the Red Ranger, as well as Jen finally letting go of Alex. The story is action packed with a bitter sweet ending. Although this episode doesn't quite beat the finale of Power Rangers In Space, I think it is a close second along with the finale to Power Rangers Lost Galaxy. Power Rangers In Space, Power Rangers Lost Galaxy and Power Rangers Time Force brought a whole new quality to the Power Rangers shows. Of course, we'll try to forget the mistake that was Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue. Power Rangers Time Force is a return to form and these episodes edited into a feature length version certainly deliver. Bring on Power Rangers Wild Force!",1027296000,3,881,4.653846153846154

Power Rangers Time Force IV : The End of Time
The 11th and 12th Power Rangers movies.
Dawn Of Destany :
The first of two triple episodes.
So far having seen most of the sieries myself , this third Time Force Movie involves both wes and Alex Collins.
Alex who was assumed dead after a brutal fight with Ransik arives in 2001 to assume leadership of the team while Wes deals with the prospect of taking over Bio-Lab.
Meanwhile , as Alex tries to take charge , the Rangers know who their true leader should be - and not a minute too soon when Dragontron returns.
The End Of Time
The triple play finalie is the final attack on Silver Hills -
Will the Rangers survive?",1020816000,2,710,4.266666666666667
7958539,5,B0000633Y9,"All four episodes that are included on this tape are wonderful. I actually stopped watching Power Rangers after Mighty Morphin Power Rangers ended because I really didn't like the way it went after it ended. But a few months ago I started watching ""Power Rangers Time Force"" and I loved it! I also think that it was actually better than the original. Jason Faunt and Erin Cahill are amazing together and both very talented and they both are great in these four episodes. This is a great tape for anyone to own. Don't miss out!",1019001600,,526,4.5473684210526315
