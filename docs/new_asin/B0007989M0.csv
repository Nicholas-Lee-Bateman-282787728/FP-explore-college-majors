8046201,3,B0007989M0,"Potential buyers should be aware that NONE of the material on these DVDs is remastered, restored or cleaned up in any way whatsoever.  It ranges from fairly good to horrible in quality.  The bondage clips and segments from her films are fair quality but the rest is really bad.  Also, Teaserama, Varietease and Striporama are NOT the complete movies.  What's here are only the very short clips with Bettie Page.  The advertising leads one to believe those films are here in there entirety, and they definitely are not.  Another thing is that they have added music to all of the dance clips and it is music that is not at all from the correct time period.  Everyone knows there was no music used in the original films (Bettie Page said so herself) but these hucksters have added music from the early 1970s.  They probably think that no one will know where the music comes from or what it is, but I happen to know.  What's here are custom instrumental versions of popular songs from the 1970s that are the sole property of Muzak.  It's great music but is from the wrong time period.  We see Bettie Page dancing to songs like ""American Pie"" and ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face.""  We all know Bettie Page was in a padded cell by the time those songs were hits.  More troubling is the fact that nothing in the credits indicates where this music came from or that it was properly licensed.  I'm betting that it was used without permission.  Muzak recordings have always been highly proprietary and not available to the public.  There could be a big lawsuit in the making here, although I know Muzak is now out of business but someone must own the rights to their recordings.  I like the music and I like the videos, but what bothers me is the lack of effort to make something that makes sense.  It's glaringly obvious that no attempt was made to sync the music selections with the dance sequences.  A song ends and Bettie is still dancing, and that is jarring.

Overall, after buying this DVD I don't have a good impression of Cult Epics.  I've ordered some pretty pricy horror movies on Blu-ray from them just recently but haven't gotten them yet, and if they are anything like this I'm going to be furious.

I think this should've been a much better release.  In this day and age there is no excuse for not restoring film stock especially when you plan to put a $50 price tag on a release.  I love the material in these DVDs, I love Bettie Page and I even love the music, but this release is a travesty.",1454889600,2,2504,4.440789473684211
8046202,5,B0007989M0,"Granted the footage is grainy and old, but considering that it was done ""quietly"" in the 1950's, it is of good historical interest.... or at least thats what I tell my wife...  ;-)",1375488000,4,180,4.454545454545454
8046203,5,B0007989M0,Bettie's attitude is her claim to fame. She liked all that she did. She could take advice and constructive criticism. She never understood the objections to anything she participated in! The collection is not that much about Betty but was very well put together! Well worth the maximum rating!!,1355702400,5,294,5.020408163265306
8046204,4,B0007989M0,"The three discs are fun but not all the material is about Bettie Page.  There IS written commentary by her, a small history of fetishism and S&M, photo galleries and more.

Bettie Page Pin Up Queen, for example, is 97 minutes of movies dealing with her and other Pin Up girls.  A lot of the film is black and white and old, grainy and not too clear.  Mostly it deals with burlesque films and shorts of her dancing.

While Bondage Queen is 113 minutes and has a lot more of Bettie Page.  The movies on this disc are in better shape, have narration and are set up showing the history of S&M in two parts.  Cat fights, women being tied up and spanked - all good stuff.  The best out of the three DVDs.

100 Girls by Bunny Yeager is 45 minutes of Bunny Yeager talking about the girls she used as models.  Some interesting extras show what happens behind the scenes of the photo industry but most of it seems to be right out of the book published under the same name.",1160956800,56,962,4.2076502732240435
