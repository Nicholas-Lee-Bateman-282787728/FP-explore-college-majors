4429628,2,B004MCGNTE,"Doesn't really give facts. There is a lot of assumption here.  The acting is not great, and it seems like they are glamorizing the sad murder.",1320796800,10,142,4.461538461538462
4429629,5,B004MCGNTE,"I loved it so much when I first saw it on Lifetime, I had to buy the DVD. I didn't know much about the case before watching, as, though I'm an avid news watcher, there hasn't been much on about this case considering it is ongoing. I did know the basics from watching part of a crime show that was covering it. You should watch the ""Beyond the Headlines"" part of the DVD first if you're unfamiliar with the case. It is equivalent to what I saw on the crime show.

The details, characters - nothing is overdone or misconstrued. From what I've researched on the case (I got into it after watching this film.), it seems very true to life. Though, Hayden Panettiere tries her best as Amanda, she just doesn't have the cold, unfeeling side to her that is very apparent in Amanda Knox. Ironically, Panettiere is of Italian descent, but the film does a good job of making her very much the outsider here. I think there is a little bias in favor of Knox (who I definitely think is guilty), though maybe I'm seeing that because the actress just does not make ""Amanda"" believable as a killer. Again, it is probably because I'm used to seeing the character in happy, bubbly roles.

Keep your eye on the female detective who is always wearing blue jeans (very casual for a detective, I would think, but as you will see the Italian legal system is quite different than ours). She cracks me up because she zeroed in on Amanda from the get-go and is merciless! I'm pretty shocked as an American to learn that the investigation methods seen in this film are what were used on Knox in real life, though I don't want to get into judging their legal system. The admissions of Knox and Solletico are the most damning evidence of all. I'm not a cop, but their behavior, even before questioning, was suspicious.

Back to judging the film itself - I think it lays out the case quite well. I would have liked to see more background on Meredith Kercher. It does not give you much indication of what kind of person she was or what kind of relationship she had to Amanda and the rest of her roommates. I guess though in real life, we really don't have that, either - just testimony from the roommates and people who knew Amanda and Meredith. It really is a mystery, and that is precisely what both the movie and the case leave us with - mystery.",1314057600,5,2317,4.383720930232558
4429630,3,B004MCGNTE,"Judge Gordon Sullivan, DVD Verdict-- Ignoring all the real-life hubbub about Kercher and Knox, Murder on Trial in Italy is an okay made-for-TV film. Hayden Panettiere does a fine job making Knox a bit ambiguous. She doesn't play her as the trumped-up sexpot of the media, nor as the innocent angel her supporters would have you believe in. Instead, she's confused young woman who we can't quite believe. Some of her actions can put down to her age and inexperience, but others are a bit more troubling. Knox's supposed partner in crime, Guiliano Mignini, is ably played by Vincent Riotta, who bears a striking resemblance to his real-life counterpart in some shots. The film also managed to snag the dependable Marcia Gay Harden as Amanda's mother. She's the one responsible for really driving home the prosecutorial aspect of Amanda's treatment.

Despite the sensational aspects of the film's title, and the trial, the film could be a lot worse. Sticking to a fairly simple flashback structure, it starts with the discovery of the body and works backwards to fill in the details of Amanda's life.

Amanda Knox: Murder on Trial in Italy comes to DVD in a simple, solid package. The anamorphic widescreen transfer is bright and colorful, belying the dark nature of the story. I didn't notice any significant compression or authoring problems, and this DVD looks about as good as you can expect from contemporary television. The audio is a bit less impressive, but totally serviceable. Dialogue is kept clear in this simple stereo mix, never overwhelmed by effects or music.

4429631,1,B004MCGNTE,"DON'T BUY THIS DVD!!!

I could not believe that a network (Lifetime) I considered at least reasonably responsible would create this fabricated, disgusting and poorly acted outrage, and then schedule it in the middle of the Amanda Knox/Raffale Sollecito appeal process, a totally unconscionable decision. I fervently hope that Amanda wins her suit against this film.  I counted 47 misrepresentations and outright lies portrayed as ""facts"" including a brief scene of Amanda, Raffaele and Rudy Guede brutally killing Meredith Kercher and I'm sure I missed a bunch.  This film is a blatant cheap shot, attempting to cash in on the misery of the families involved.  No thought was given to the victim, to the two obviously innocent people convicted of her murder and currently held in an Italian prison, or to the families.

There is so much in this film that is misleading, fictitious and created for sensational effect that it makes me want to vomit.  I had a hard time getting through it. The script writer obviously read ""Angle Face"" by Barbie Nadeau, a woman who wouldn't know the truth if it came up and hit her in the face.  Ms Nadeau wrote her book solely to cash in on the sensationalism of the case, most of which was created by Ms Nadeau and her buddies in Britain and Italy. She is no writer and she should be ashamed of herself as should the script writer, the director, the producer and the network, to say nothing of Hayden Panettiere (as Amanda Knox) and Marcia Gay Harden (as Amanda's mother).  I was not surprised that Ms Panettiere appeared in this film...not in great demand as an actor so anything for a buck, but I was shocked to see Ms Harden, an Oscar winner, involved in this mess.  She should be particularly ashamed of herself.  Both of these actors took it upon themselves to not only tout the film on various TV talk shows, but to offer opinions on the case.  Neither one of these women knows or ever even spoke to the characters they portrayed.  Ms Harden remarked that she felt she knew all she needed to know about the case as she read the Massei Report.  The Massei Report is a severely flawed document full of misinformation and manufactured evidence written strictly to back up the psychotic prosecutor Guiliano Mignini's hallucinatory scenario of the crime.  Ms Panettiere publicly advised the Kercher, Knox and Sollecito families to watch the film as they would not find it at all offensive.  The Kercher family begged Lifetime not to air it, the Knox and Sollecito families did the same and Amanda was sickened by it.  So much for Ms Panettiere's advice!

If you want an objective, accurate depiction of the case, please read ""Murder in Italy"" by Candace Dempsey.  You should also read ""The Monster of Perugia"" by Dr. Mark Waterbury and ""Injustice in Perugia"" by Bruce Fisher.  Two innocent young people have spent 3+ years in prison for a crime they didn't commit.  They are currently appealing their conviction and a film like this does nothing to help keep the trial atmosphere objective.  Please don't encourage this kind of network behavior and do not contribute anymore $ to their coffers by purchasing this DVD.  If you haven't already watched this abomination, please take my advice and don't have anything to do with it.",1302998400,19,3262,4.777183600713013
4429632,1,B004MCGNTE,"Regardless of anything, this book is based off another book called, ""Angel Face, the true story of student killer Amanda Knox.
That should say  everything...",1301443200,19,157,5.28
4429633,1,B004MCGNTE,"Is the whole world mad, or is it just me? This film is an outrage, and  Amanda Knox is rightly taking out an action for 3 million Euros against the makers of this film. And Amazon should have nothing to do with its distribution. It is pure fiction, except that the people portrayed in the film exist and two of them (Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito) have been subjected to the most outrageously improbable targeted aggression by an outrageously out of control polizio-judicial system. This film has helped to compound the problem, just to make money and feed on our collective taste for sensationalism and tittle-tattle.

We should be used to institutions of all kinds, from  Governments downwards, being taken over by psychopaths, yet it always seems to come to us as a surprise! Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, Amin, Gaddafi, Mugabe; a few decent enough examples from the top drawer. But psychopaths are all around, and present the main reason for ills in the world. Put another way, we have 4% of androids among us, who seem to be humans, but have no empathy and no conscience and will aggressively target us in whatever way they can best get away with.  And they tend to congregate, and then hunt in packs. Politics at all levels, is a natural hotbed, that is why we need to be able to get rid of them in elections. But it applies equally to the professions and of course the police. As Joel Bakan has written eloquently in his book `The Corporation', incorporated firms BY LAW have to behave like psychopaths, their only responsibility being towards their shareholders. So of course Lifetime is going to behave as a psychopath, unless the price for doing so is exceeded by the penalty. They are probably laughing at 3 million Euros - so let's make it 6, three more for Raffaele

With Meredith Kercher's murder, the truth is simple, too simple it seems. Rudy Guede, a known criminal (who was, incidentally, also working undercover for the police), broke into her flat, surprised her when she came home early, and sexually assaulted and killed her. He had to because she knew him. Common or garden sexually aroused criminal psychopath. No extra papers sold and no film material in that. Psychopaths controlling the police then go for the least probable solution and target and torture ('interview overnight') two innocent lovers, trusting outsiders, without lawyers, or in the foreigner's case a translator to translate. Kids with no track record of anything other than exemplary behaviour - perfect targets in other words, for our modern fantasy world of make-believe. The public prosecutor in Perugia on duty is himself a convicted criminal, guilty of abuse of power (for a lawyer the equivalent of Dr Harold Shipman caring for his patients). Read `The Monster of Florence' by Douglas Preston and Mario Spezi if you doubt the pathology. He operates in, and controls an unbelievably incestuous system, where his chums include the first trial judge!

And the Press have to sell papers- another set of Corporations vying for profit. They make a killing from spoon-fed lies from all these psychopaths, and most of us obediently swallow them. Gullible, and especially psychopathic bloggists have a field day amplifying the diabolisation of Amanda. Then this film, brought out just as some sense is at last beginning to enter the legal proceedings in Perugia, and the snakes are beginning to squirm. We should be ashamed of ourselves for letting Lifetime get away with it.",1301443200,15,3469,4.921367521367522

4429649,4,B004MCGNTE,"This is an originally made for TV movie in 2011, so if you know that going in I don't think you'll have the expectations that some other reviewers seem to have of this. It is based on a true story, and isn't a documentary, as you'd expect it embellishes some things and leaves other less entertaining stuff out.  It follows the TV movie formula of going for around an hour and a half, cutting the story short and wrapping everything up with a number of text boxes on the screen. And spending its casting budget on unknown outside of other TV movie actors with the exception of a regogniseable face from a popular former TV show's that is no longer on air. In this case that show  was Heroes' (which went off air a year earlier with it's actress Hayden Panettiere leaving that show even earlier than that).  Hayden who a year later would go onto to star in Nashville and become a much more A list actress, plays Amanda Knox in this one.  The trio of the accused in real life that got the most media attention since she was an attractive young American.  Although Panettiere is certainly smoking hot, she doesn't look a great deal like the real Amanda Knox.  But she portrays a young woman in the situation of being accused of the murder of her roommate in a foreign country that doesn't investigate and prosecute crimes the same way it is done in America (and well most first world countries).  You certainly through Hayden felt what the real Amanda would have gone through.

Although it might annoy some people who know anyone actually involved in the real life situation or who knows the victim or accussed or their families, this film deliberately stays vague on portraying if Amanda actually was involved in her roommate's death or not.  You certainly do see the incompetence and somewhat arrogance of the Italian prosecution team though.  This film was released before appeals and everything else had played out, you've also got to remember that too.

Amanda Knox: Murder on Trial in Italy is an entertaining enough way to pass an hour and a half.  It's no People vs OJ Simpson in quality for example, but it never had the money or length of screen time to be something like that.  If you want a comprehensive coverage of the trial and aftermath there are no doubt better alternatives out there made in more recent times with more facts out there. Maybe the same people who made People vs OJ will remake this story, I'd watch that.  But if you are just after an entertaining low budget movie, or a fan of Hayden Panettiere and want to see everything she's made, you won't go wrong with this.",1463356800,,2595,4.552688172043011

4429652,4,B004MCGNTE,"People need to have realistic expectations of lifetime movies. They are made for entertainment, not fact.

While acknowledging Knox's imprudent and inappropriate behaviors, as well as illegal drug use, Dempsey argues that Knox and Raffaele Sollecito were caught in a rush-to-judgment.  It appears that Knox quickly became the victim of a frenzied international media more interested in sales than in truth.",1428192000,,525,7.590163934426229
4429667,1,B004MCGNTE,"Movies based from real tragedies can be done if those movies are presenting accurate facts coming from certifiable sources;  are filmed years after the case is ""closed"". But in the case of this movie based on the Meredith Kercher tragedy, this is not what happened. Instead, the movie uses innacurate sources and reports, along with scandal newspapers' details to present the people involved, even inventing behaviours and elements that never happened. Which I think is horrible and wrong. Because in this movie, Amanda Knox and Rafaele Solecito are presented as cunning individuals while important parts and facts of their lives are obliterated. Facts that prove their innocence and humanity. Proofs that prove they never attacked Meredith Kercher. That the sole culprit in this murder is Rudy Guede. As this movie was done and broadcast in 2011, it also put in danger the innocence of two individuals who were still on Appeal at the time. Which is reckless and irresponsible.

Also when the actors portraying the people involved are terrible, not credible, and play their parts using whatever lousy Method acting Hollywood or Studios believe makes its puppets portray reality, it's horrible because their portrayals hurt reputations, in particular Amanda Knox's as she's played out by Hayden Panetierre as some Hollywood starlet in Italy, which is not at all how the real Amanda Knox speaks and behaves. And when the actors interviewed (ex: Hayden Panetierre) explain their interests in interviews as ""just doing our job"", to win their bread, butter, and milk, well I think it's unnacceptable and pretty pathetic. Especially as LifeTime is the one producing and releasing this scandalous pornography. But then again, what more can you expect from such a sexist channel that promotes a ""men are dogs"" ideology; especially in its ""Murder Porn"" and lame TV movies that have been condemned in many shows like Family Guy and South Park.

In conclusion, I think this movie is an insult to Knox and Solecito's dignities because court testimonials, ethical investigation, and non-biased experts have confirmed the innocence of Knox and Solecito in 2011. And so did Judge Hellerman who felt sorry for those two kids and the hatred they, along with their families, have suffered on Twitter, Facebook, and Scandal sheets in the UK, Italy, and around the world.

And as Amanda Knox and Rafaele Solecito have been finally declared ""Not Guilty"" and ""innocent"" in an ultimate verdict given by the Supreme Court of Italy on March 27 2015, I think it's time for LifeTime to remove this filthy and libelous piece of trash.",1427673600,4,2606,5.110328638497653

Then she's later smiling and waving at the cameras, certainly leaving a very bad impression. If her and her boyfriend were innocent , then why did they change their stories ? I feel the room-mate lied in court when she said that Amanda brought a lot of strange men to the apartment and had sex with them leaving used condoms in the bathroom. Amanda only had the one boyfriend who she spent all her time with. Initially, there was no forensic evidence pointing at them. I feel the evidence was later planted and people e.g room-mate were paid off to lie, including the guy from the cleaning supply store. Maybe the doctor had something to do with Amanda's blood being found in the bathroom 47 days after the initial investigation ! He did of course draw blood samples from her telling her she had AIDS initially. I feel because the prosecutor knew a lot of powerful people who he could have paid off, also had a personal vendetta against Amanda for making it public knowledge of his indictment. He wanted to save face in the public eye by proving that he could convict Amanda. The question is his theory that Amanda and her 2 boyfriends went back to the apartment to kill Meredith who was there with her British friends. They were never cross examined. It doesn't make sense that a murder be committed with friends in the apartment. Amanda should have taken her mother's advice to return home. Amanda did not have a motive to kill Meredith. A few squabbles over her hygiene and not doing housework would not in my opinion lead her to do that. She had no history of run in's with the law or mental illness. I don't understand why the interviews were not video taped. The female prosecutor told Amanda to imagine what happened. Amanda should not have spoken to them without first asking for an attorney.

4429812,1,B004MCGNTE,"It was really fun to watch this for the many views of Perugia and of the cottage tho it could have been much better if their intent was honorable - or even better (seeking TRUTH, not just quick cash $$$)

EVERYONE was against the making of this film before the trial finished, including the defense of Knox, Sollecito and even the defense of Meredith.

I woulld have loved to hear how Hayden was advised to portray AK cuz she sure does make her look GUILTY tho the evidence says NO.

Amanda and Raffaele were not 'surprised' or 'caught' by the police - that's why they were standing outside the cottage waiting!

The clock on the wall was 12 minutes SLOW, not fast as Mignini claimed.

In the film MK's room is twice the size that it really was.  Too small for 4 people!

She had no dresser.

Meredith was not stripped to her bra and panties.  She was stabbed before she even took her coat off!

She was sexually assaulted after she was mortally wounded, as she lay dead or dying.

Mignini claims she didn't retract her srtatement but court testimony proves that's not true!

AK knew the details of the murder because Filimina's friends Paola and Luca looked into the room and told Raffaele and Amanda what they saw.  Again, as they testified in court!

They never had a picnic - they met in frigid October.

They didn't run away laughing and gigglinng from the candlelit vigil.

AK and RS were not there.  They were called back into the station that night.

NONE of MK's friends or the other roommates were at the vigil either.

NO ONE yet knew who the murderer was as the lab tests were not back and Rudy had not yet been found!

4429817,4,B004MCGNTE,"As movies made for television go, I found this Lifetime production to be a decent film overall.  There's clearly some exploitation going on of a salacious international news story still in the headlines, but I don't think it was done in an unreasonable way.

Hayden Panettiere plays Amanda Knox, the now well-known American exchange student in Italy who was accused of the murder of Meredith Kercher, a British university student also studying there.  Her Italian boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito and Rudy Guede, an immigrant from the Ivory Coast, are also accused of the murder.  The facts as painted by the police and prosecution make for a tantalizing tale almost perfectly made for exploitation and hype by news tabloids and other media.

The film shows events unfolding in a mostly procedural manner with occasional flashbacks to earlier events involving Amanda and the ill-fated Meredith.  Not all of the details that can be found in media accounts made it into the film, but the most significant ones did and are handled in an effective and expeditious manner.  The same is true for the later police interrogations and the trial proceedings.  This is not a documentary, but I actually can't find too much fault with how events were portrayed in the film.  The confusing and conflicting accounts that can be found across the large body of media articles are also present in the film with roughly equivalent balance for different parties.

The movie is a OK adaptation overall.  There are no earth-shattering revelations since the international news media has already covered the various accounts, accusations, theories, and hyperbole in substantial detail.  However, I found a film-based presentation interesting in linking those details together in a way that events unfolded and as how those events would have seemed to the people involved.  Panettiere does a decent job in portraying Amanda as a free-spirited young woman experiencing life for the first time in a foreign country and in showing her reactions as the ordeal of Meredith's murder and its investigation begins.  Marcia Gay Harden makes an impression as Amanda's mother with her limited screentime.  Vincent Riotta is effective as prosecutor Guiliano Mignini, who is the lead figure in representing the local legal authorities.

Although the film is somewhat sympathetic toward Amanda, it also presents details about her that contributed to Italian authorities focusing on her.  Drug use and a perhaps overly care-free spirit generally don't enamor one with the law-and-order types that inhabit most law enforcement organizations, and those aspects of Amanda seem fairly presented.  However, much of the behavior of the police and prosecution is also confusing, especially to those who may be accustomed to different legal systems than that found in Italy.  That is as much a part of the news story as anything else, and I think it's fairly depicted in the film.

I recommend the film for anyone interested in the real-life story.  It adds to the narrative through its story-based presentation of events and human portrayal by the actors.  It has the usual constraints of TV productions, but I think the majority of flaws in the narrative come from the muddled affair of the real events.",1391212800,,3254,5.158095238095238

Daniel Radcliffe in ""Woman In Black."" Definitely held my short attention span and didn't want it to end. Acting was realistic with never a dull moment. Check this out even if you're not a fan of courtroom drama.",1390780800,,386,4.5285714285714285
4429821,3,B004MCGNTE,"Amanda Knox is a student at the University of Washington, just as I was in the 90s, although I've never met her.  Yes, she has a lot more money than I do; doing ill-advised interviews for network television will do that for you.  And yes, she's far ""prettier"" than I am, although I'm a guy so I'm not sure that's a fair comparison.  (It kind of reminds me of that commercial where the gal wakes up in the middle of the night, and thinks that her husband's having an affair, as he's whispering on the phone.  Yeah, he's having an affair with a ""dude"" from State Farm that's wearing khakis.)  And finally yes, she speaks Italian, and all that I can muster in that language is to order a latte or spaghetti, as I've been to Italy a couple of times.  But nonetheless, I wouldn't trade places with her for anything in the world.

After all, she's facing her third trial currently, which is surely lame as Italy should have a double jeopardy law, just like the United States.  (To be fair, however, she was found guilty the first time, and she got a new trial the second time which set her free, which surely didn't upset her.)  And I believe that she is still facing charges for implicating her old boss for a murder, a murder in which she supposedly knew nothing.  (I saw Ms. Knox on an interview and she seemed to feel truly remorseful about this one.)  And while she's not in Italy currently -- I think that she's back at the good ol' U Dub, taking classes in the wonderful rain and cold of Seattle -- she won't return to Italy if found guilty.  She probably won't return either way would be my guess; would you if you were in her shoes?

But still, if she's found guilty the second time, she will be a prisoner in her own land.  Why?  Well, let's say she flies outside US borders, even to some Virgin Islands.  And let's say that there is an emergency, and the flight is diverted.  If she ended up in a non-US territory, she could be extradited back to Italy immediately.  That option is not optional; the risk will be too great.

Of course, this film is somewhat of a different story.  While I really liked the lead here (she looks like Ms. Knox and ""channels"" her a bit as well), I liked neither the tone nor the writing.  I felt that this was way too one-sided, one-sided on the side of Ms. Knox.  It would have been much better as a balanced affair in my opinion.

And why is it that people from a country always are on the side of their own countrymen, when those countrymen are arrested abroad?  Well, you and I both know the reason:  people are not objective, just like this film.  Who knows what really happened?  I would imagine that Meredith Kercher knows, although she took that knowledge to her grave.  And the person -- or people -- who killed her surely know as well, although they will never talk, unless, say, one of them ""gets religion"" perhaps, and then has a change of conscience, and eventually fesses up.  But that is highly unlikely.  After all, this isn't the movies.  It's only TV.

When you make a film -- even one that is made-for-TV, as I believe this one was -- you still owe it to your audience to remain objective.  I think that this one did not, so I'm going to have to give it an unfortunate pass.  Arrivederci.",1390262400,,3242,4.3305647840531565

I had read another book about him called the The Monster Of Florence. This man seems corrupt to say the least. Makes me wonder if he did have an agenda of his own. And maybe he did go after Amanda Knox.

In the Monster Of Florence Douglas Preston presents a gripping account of crime and punishment by this Prosecutor. In 2000, Douglas Preston fulfilled a dream to move his family to Italy. Then he discovered that the olive grove in front of their 14th century farmhouse had been the scene of the most infamous double-murders in Italian history, committed by a serial killer known as the Monster of Florence. Preston, intrigued, meets Italian investigative journalist Mario Spezi to learn more. This is the true story of their search for and identification of the man they believe committed the crimes, and their chilling interview with him. And then, in a strange twist of fate, Preston and Spezi themselves become targets of the police investigation. Preston has his phone tapped, is interrogated, and told to leave the country. Spezi fares worse: he is thrown into Italy's grim Capanne prison, accused of being the Monster of Florence himself. Like one of Preston's thrillers, The Monster Of Florence, tells a remarkable and harrowing story involving murder, mutilation, and suicide-and at the center of it, Preston and Spezi, caught in a bizarre prosecutorial vendetta.",1322352000,5,1535,4.881226053639847

8435929,3,B004MCGNTE,"Do not watch this cinematic showing of the Amanda Knox trial if you believe in innocence. There were multiple incorrect facts, including her flatmates (depending on whether or not you like the Netflix documentary). While I did admire the acting of Hayden, I thought the real genius came from the costume director who clothed Rafelle. His turtlenecks were spot on!
While I got a good chuckle, I do not agree with the viewpoint of the film. From the start, it sets out to frame Amanda Knox and not allow the viewer to see they other side of the story. I feel as though Lifetime prevented me from learning the whole truth. Amanda Knox is clearly innocent (ask Netflix) and I feel that she was discriminated against in this film. I would recommend it for those who think she is guilty as this plays to you needs (but it is also an incorrect viewpoint). This shows just how the media sways opinions!",1480982400,6,894,4.559006211180124
