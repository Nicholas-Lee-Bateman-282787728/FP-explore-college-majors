8520821,4,B007PXYVOG,"Passed (sic) the Door of Darkness and Fist of the Vampire.

Door of Darkness is one of those Se7en knock-offs, but manages to make the idea its own. The ending was especially delicious.

And Fist of the Vampire? Exactly what the name implies. Vampires. Punching each other. A lot. If you're a fan of mindless martial arts films, this is one for you. The choreography is definitely amateur but surprisingly well-done, and there are female characters in here who are not irritating. WHAT?! Given, the story is a little ridiculous, but what do you expect from vampires punching each other in the face?

The other films in here are featured in many other multi-movie DVDs, and if they aren't, they weren't so memorable as to earn a mention in my review. So, spend the $5.00 just for Door of Darkness and Fist of the Vampire!",1396224000,,820,4.641379310344828
