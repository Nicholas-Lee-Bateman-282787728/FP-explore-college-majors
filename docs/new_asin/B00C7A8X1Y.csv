5692315,4,B00C7A8X1Y,"Was a mystery to try and figure out who the ""bad"" guy was who was responsible for a lot of pain and death.  Not for the faint of heart.  Twist at the end which I didn't see coming.  Enjoyed the film.  It is English, so dialogue can be difficult at times.",1400198400,,254,3.9215686274509802
5692316,4,B00C7A8X1Y,"A well acted, suspenseful film about a group of apartment dwellers under seige by an unknown sniper. Unknown that is until the end. An outstanding performance by Jack O'Connell.

I had a bit of trouble understanding some of the dialog due to the heavy accents. Unfortunatly, the DVD was missing the subtitle option which would have helped.

Very good film overall.",1399334400,2,364,4.950819672131147
5692317,4,B00C7A8X1Y,"It takes about 15 minutes for this thing to get going, but once the sniper started picking off people through their living room windows, i was hooked. Taken on that level, this is a good movie. But once the identity of the sniper is revealed, i started asking a lot of questions and there aren't any answers that make sense. It would almost have been better if they had never told us the identity of the bad guy, and had him disappear into the night. If you can get past that, you'll like this movie.",1378771200,,500,4.273684210526316
5692318,2,B00C7A8X1Y,"The movie is boring, the sitting very off, looks like a second hand movie. when I buy my movies, they keeps me on the edge of my seat.  This one did not. I wish I could return it.",1378339200,2,179,3.710526315789474
5692319,1,B00C7A8X1Y,"WELL WHERE DO I START, I GUESS HAVING SEEN IT HAD FOUR STARS IT WAS A POSSIBLE WINNER NOT SO IN MY OPINION. USUAL VIOLENCE TO START WITH YOUTH IS BEATEN TO DEATH IN HALLWAY OF A BUILDING THAT HAS MULTIPLE STORIES BUT ALL THE RESIDENTS ARE CONFINED TO ONE FLOOR? SOON THE KILLING STARTS WE HAVE A SNIPER WHO IS ABLE TO KNOW WHICH WINDOW IN WHICH ROOM PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE IN THEN WITH DEADLY AIM SHOOTS AND KILLS THEM MOSTLY WITH A SHOT TO THE CHEST NOW THIS IS PRETTY GREAT SHOOTING HE OR SHE CAN EVEN HIT TARGETS WHEN THE CURTAINS ARE CLOSED THATS PRETTY GOOD AND WITH MANY ROOMS FOR THE SNIPER TO TRY TO COVER THEY ARE ALWAYS ON TARGET FOR THE RIGHT ROOM AT THE RIGHT TIME. CAMERA PAN SHOTS SHOW THAT THERE IS A WIDE EXPANCE OF NOTHING BUT NO ONE IS SIGHTED ,HANG ON NO ONE LOOKED THER IS HOWEVER A BUILDING A LONG WAY OFF IN THE DISTANCE PERHAPS THE SNIPER IS HIDDEN IN THER SOMEWHERE? BOOBY TRAPS THE SPIPER HAS ALSO MANAGED TO BOOBYTRAP THE PLACE WHEN AND HOW IS ANYONES GUESS BUT THERE THEY ARE JUST THER AT THE RIGHT SOP.THEY DO TRY AND ESCAPE THE FEW THAT ARE LEFT YOU NEED TO WATCH IF YOU LAST THAT LOND TO SEE WHAT THEY ATTEMPT THEN ALL IS REVEALED THE SNIPER ENTERS THE BUILDING NOT CERTAIN HOW BUT THERE HE IS WITH A PISSY LITTLE SNUBNOSED AUTOMATIC RIFLE HELL THAT THE WEPON THAT HE HAS BEEN USING BETTER TELL TOM BERRINGER (THE SNIPER) ABOUT THAT TYPE OF SHOOTER HELL HE PICKED OFF PEOPLE HE CAN'T EVEN SEE WITH IT. ONE SAVING GRACE WITH THIS , PERHAPS TWO IS THE ACTING NOT TO SHABBY FOR A B MOVIE AND THE END CREDITS ARE TERRIFIC I ONLY PAID TEN BUCKS FOR MY COPY SO IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE.
AL WATTS
ALMOST FOR GOT THEY DECIED TO SET A FIRE TO ATRACT ATENTION WHICH THEY COULD HAD DONE EARLIER AND SET IT ON THE ROOF AND JUST BACK TO THE SNIPER HE'S ABLE TO SHOOT THROUGH A FIRE HOSE IN THE DARK WHICH IS LOOPED OF THE LEDGE AND HIT IT MULTIPAL TIMES GIVE ME A BREAK",1377043200,2,1886,4.005305039787799
5692320,4,B00C7A8X1Y,"I saw this when it showed at Fantastic Fest in 2012, and it's a great, simple, and unique thriller. If you're in the mood to watch terrible things happen to varying levels of terrible people, this is the movie for you!",1375488000,4,218,4.341463414634147
5692321,5,B00C7A8X1Y,"I live in the uk, so I can fully understand what they are saying. I don't normally like British films which is ironic seen as though I am British. I read a review by Richard P. Thorne on here he said he couldn't understand the accent but that's what people who live in council estate talk like in the uk and he said the region 1 copy of the DVD doesn't have subtitles but if you get the uk DVD copy of it (region 2) then you get subtitles and a behind the scene featurette. I most say tower block is the best British film I have ever seen. I would defintly recommended this film.",1375228800,,579,4.043478260869565
5692322,2,B00C7A8X1Y,"Story and thriller aspect good, but I feel I need Daphne ,from Frasier to interpret the dialogue for me. And Naturally NO CLOSED CAPTIONS, if any movie needed them, this one does. Feel kinda gyppped on my purchase of this, but I will be careful now for movies made in England. I would NOT recommend this unless you are from the U.K. Sorry, I really wanted to enjoy this movie, but could not in the dialogue aspect. BE WARY. Rent instead from Netflix or Redbox. I usually do not give bad movie reviews, but have to warn folks on this turkey.",1373068800,,540,4.356435643564357

8577915,5,B00C7A8X1Y,"I bought this for my Grandma and this is what she had to say

""Kind of, well, different because it took place in England with English actors. it was good and it was pretty believable. It was filmed well. I liked it""-grandma",1513468800,,223,4.309523809523809

8577918,5,B00C7A8X1Y,"First off, Becky (Sheridan Smith) and Pauly (Russell Tovey) and Curtis (Jack O'Connell) are outstanding. Don't get me wrong so is the rest of the cast all of them are terrific. I totally loved the idea of this movie, it is something I haven't seen, similar but not in this context. A 15 year old boy is murdered on the top floor of a huge apartment building. No one cares enough to help (becky tries) but no one will talk about it to the cops. One year later these same people are victims of a sniper somewhere nearby. The exits are booby trapped and they are all alone. Very suspenseful and tense. Violent but very good. I do love my British movies. This one is an excellent addition to the rest. Bravo, to the director, the writer the actors and everyone involved. The ending was a little predictable but well worth the watch.",1436054400,,828,4.4183006535947715

8577920,4,B00C7A8X1Y,"I watched this movie because of Jack O'Connell. As far as the movie goes (kills me to say this) it was ok. I watched it after reading reviews & a trailer. Thought ok, this might be good. I'll just say, I'm glad I didn't pay for it. It was pretty boring.",1433116800,,253,3.980392156862745
