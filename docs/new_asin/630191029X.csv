Of that restoration, Terrence Rafferty in the New York Times wrote, ""Thanks to his diligent widow, the evidence of Jacques Demy's brilliant beginnings survives, rescued from obscurity and decay. It's wonderful, in this grim time, to know that ""Lola"" and ""Bay of Angels"" are back to stay, and miraculous that they look so bright and clear and young.

376403,5,630191029X,"I remember thinking when I first got this, ""It's probably just another boring foreign film"". I couldn't have been more wrong! This story was surprisingly easy to like. A real sense of sweetness and nostalgia permeates the entire production. Demy would later produce more dazzling works, but would never surpass the effortless perfection of this simple black & white film...one is not just watching a story, but living life itself here.",1320451200,,435,5.140845070422535
376404,5,630191029X,"Lola is an elegant example of French New Wave filmmaking from the early 1960's.  Start with the opening scene showing how Demy influenced photographers Gary Winogrand and Robert Frank (with the white convertible and the American sailors).  Or perhaps they influenced him.  I've seen this movie three times and I've loved it every time.  Anouk Aimee is like a combination of Marilyn Monroe, Cyd Charisse and herself.  Lola is kind and sensuous.  Also Elina Labourdette from Bresson's Les dames du Bois de Boulogne as the bourgeosis mother worried about her daughter.  Startingly frank in how it deals with sexuality, in comparison to American movies of this time period. Watching this movie you can see how the Nouvelle Vague influenced American film directors in the 1970s.",1312243200,,773,5.136
376405,4,630191029X,"Originally conceived as a Technicolor musical but shot on the cheap (so cheap they couldn't even afford a sound crew), Jacques Demy's Lola isn't exactly the masterpiece critics claimed back in 1960, but it is one of the more likable films of the French New Wave, largely because it's less concerned with scoring stylistic points and more interested in people. What's particularly refreshing is that Demy likes these people - all of them, without exception - and never judges them, and that generosity of spirit carries it a long way. Following the role coincidence plays in our lives through its characters whose paths and hearts cross, it staves off complete schmaltz with an awareness that one person's happy ending is often another's missed possibility of happiness: Demy may not be able to resist giving one character a Hollywood Happy Ending, but it does come at a price to another, while other characters lives are left unresolved. There are a few moments where Anouk Aimee's tart with a heart overdoes the Marilyn impersonations (an affectation of the character rather than the actress) and Allan Scott's English dialogue sounds like it's been dubbed by a German reading phonetically, but they're fairly fleeting irritants and there's more than enough elsewhere to make up for it, not least Raoul Coutard's lovingly shot black and white Scope photography of Nantes.

The 2.35:1 widescreen transfer transfer, taken from a restored version, is good but not outstanding (though with the budgetary limitation the filmmakers had in 1960, it's doubtful it could look much better). Aside from the original theatrical trailer it also includes an extract from the documentary The World of Jacques Demy about the making of the film, though for the section dealing with the forgotten US sequel, Model Shop, you'll have to buy the documentary (available separately) itself.",1179532800,5,1868,5.1650165016501655
376406,4,630191029X,"Jacques Demy had a special way of viewing the world. He loved women and he was an incurable romantic. This delicate movie about a melancholy, gorgeoous woman in Nantes, France, who ""dances"" with sailors to earn a living while pining after her true love is a bittersweet poetic ode to the romantic in all of us. Anouk Aimee who was stunning years later in A Man and a Woman gave one of her best performances in this film, with a charming music score by Michel Legrand (and themes that would reappear in The Umbrellas of Cherbourg). Lola was recently restored so it looks very good on this DVD but I wish they hadn't used yellow subtitles--very distracting--which is why I didn't give the film five stars.",1079740800,9,703,4.587301587301587
376407,4,630191029X,"Ever see Jacques Demy's lovely ""Umbrellas of Cherbourg""? This is the film he made BEFORE Umbrellas - and the central character is Roland Cassard, the second man in Umbrellas. ""Lola"" stands by itself as a lovely introduction to Demy's world - boy meets girl, boy loses girl to her first love, boy goes off to smuggle diamonds (and reappears in Umbrellas as a diamond merchant). Very much worth seeing if you enjoy Umbrellas, and it could give you a new perspective on that excellent movie.",1008288000,10,488,4.752941176470588

7816533,5,630191029X,"I bought this movie because it was cited in France-Amerique as a classic.  It really is.  I think it provides some real insight into what France was like as it recovered from the Second World War.  The characters in this film are engaging and entertaining.  And if you have watched ""Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" you will be delighted to find that Lola is really the prelude.  Remember - ""Jai aime un femme - elle s'apelle Lola""?  Here is Lola.",1474848000,,438,4.551282051282051

7816541,5,630191029X,"My next four reviews continue my Nouvelle Vague preference, but this time with (Paris) Rive gauche (Left Bank of the Seine River) productions: After Demy's Lola his wife Agns Varda's Clo (1962), Resnais' La guerre est finie (1966), and finally Chris Marker and other short films by the Rive gauche auteurs Varda and Resnais. Lola, produced by Georges de Beauregard and Carlo Ponti, is dedicated to Max Ophls (1902-57), another auteur  before its Nouvelle Vague time, written and directed by Jacques Demy. Camera, in black and white, is by Raoul Coutard, one of the leading Nouvelle Vague cameramen of early and later Godard, Truffaut and others. Original music is by Michel Legrand. Script girl is Truffaut's regular Suzanne Schiffman.

Anouk Aime, main actress of the title role, had already played in Le Rideau cramoisi (1952) and Les Mauvaises Rencontres (1955), both by Alexandre Astruc, Les Amants de Montparnasse (1957) by Jacques Becker, La tte contre les murs (1958) by Georges Franju, La Dolce Vita (1960) by Fellini, and then, after Lola, in his 8 (1962), and, most famously, in Un homme et une femme (1966) and Viva la vie (1983), both by Claude Lelouch - and many more. Though Lola did poorly at the box office at the time, it certainly established Anouk Aime and Jacques Demy as leading figures, and introduced Corinne Marchand, later Varda's Clo, in a small but significant side role as a dancer.

Somewhat in contrast to so many internationally known names, Lola, a true romance, plays in the provincial port town of Nantes, South of Brittany, but with US Navy ships calling in at neighbouring Cherbourg. The people living in Nantes, like some US Navy crew, are very well chosen and, despite the lack of big actor names (except for Lola) give a credible and plausible background to the story. France, it should be recalled, came out of World War II in 1944 but subsequently fought two colonial wars: Indochina and Algeria. After losing the war in Indochina in 1954, the even fiercer Algerian War started the same year. Due to the large number of European settlers, Algeria was particularly problematic. General de Gaulle's re-accession to power in 1958 in the middle of the crisis ultimately led to the independence of Algeria with the 1962 Evian Accords.

Likewise, the Treaty of Rome, the international agreement that led to the founding of the European Economic Community, came into effect on 1 January 1958. It is a generally accepted view today that the origin of modern economic France starts with that event. So much of the real world of Lola still deals with the immediate past, the three wars still omnipresent, and many adjustment problems ahead. It should only be another ten years to May 1968, which triggered Gaullism without de Gaulle. Nantes, around 1960, seems free of major changes, though some people leave for Paris or overseas. But that is the exception rather than the rule.

So a society in transition, with the old as ballast and not much new in sight, the political instability cause and effect of lacking directions. Near the existentialist philosophy of the time, but at a much more pedestrian level, stagnant waters. While topic-wise a very set melodrama, the cinematographic treatment is light, using many mirrors, glass and stairs, dynamic, bursting with life. The happy ending fits well, with a tear in the eye of all, and it remains an absolute mystery why Lola, when it first came out, did so poorly at the box office: I hold as equal to Chabrol's, Godard's, and Truffaut's first movies!
