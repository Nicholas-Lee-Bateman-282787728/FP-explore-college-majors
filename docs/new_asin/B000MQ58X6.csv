2738482,4,B000MQ58X6,"Okay, I have been a Monarch fan for some time and I must tell you up front I love the original Monarch characters.  I really miss Hector and Killwillie.  Weren't you getting tired of Lexi in Series 5?  They had done everything they could do with her character and if they were smart they would have shipped her and Archie off together to live happily ever after and raise some baby lairds.  Unfortunately, the writers turned our beloved Lexi into a harpie by having her make out with her brother in law, Paul, as Molly watches.  This scene really made my skin crawl.  How about a little honor in the Highlands?  This really sullied the characters of Lexi and Paul.  Anyway, this season pretty well purges the old Monarch cast with the exception of Golly and Molly.  It still didn't make sense to get rid of Duncan.  And the way they did it was awful.  He didn't even have a heart to heart with Jess before he left.  The real Duncan could never do that to a pal.  If they would have kept Duncan around at least Golly would have had someone to talk too.  Keep in mind that this is not the Old Monarch that we are used to.  There are plenty of new characters and it gives us a chance to see Glenbogle in a new light.  I know I was getting bored with the bitter, business woman/laird Lexi.  They sucked all the fun out of her character once she got married.  Anyway, this season is a refreshing change and Uncle Donald (from Dr. Who) is every bit as eccentric as his brother Hector.  If you are a die hard Monarch fan I would purchase this item.  Keep in mind this isn't like any of the past series and all your old friends have left.  But the new tenants of Glenbogle did keep me watching.  Hey BBC, how about a Christmas at Glenbogle with all our old pals returning for a family friendly holiday season?",1181260800,28,1801,4.281899109792285
2738483,2,B000MQ58X6,"When Hector was written out, I wondered how the show could go on as entertainingly as before.  It did.  The natural transfer from father to son, with Molly's trials adjusting to widowhood, all worked, not least because Kilwillie was frequently in the picture to stir things up.  I missed the tension/surprise between Katrina, Lexi, and Archie more when she left, than I did what Hector contributed.

By the time we'd lost Hector, Katrina AND Kilwillie, I began to feel the situation comedy more forced than natural.  I disagree with other reviewers who think Archie had become redundant. Hand he returned from Tibet, with Paul installed and things carrying on in his absense, a whole new set of natural tensions upon his return could have been explored.

But removing Duncan - the equivalent of writing out the Fool from a Shakespearean play, takes everything just way too far away from the original concept and the dynamics that worked.  Sorry, I'm really disappointed that what started out so wonderfully, just fizzled. The previous reviewer is right - they should have written an intended conclusion if losing central actors, and wrapped it up satisfyingly, as did the writers of The Wonder Years (which many are still waiting to see on DVD!)",1181174400,9,1245,4.956730769230769
2738484,4,B000MQ58X6,"How can you not want to watch and enjoy this season of the light-hearted scottish series just for the presence alone of 4 great british cult tv figures!? The divine, authentically scottish Simone Lahbib from the first 3 classic seasons of ""Bad Girls,"" Tom Baker (still my favorite Dr. Who), Anthony Head (Giles from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and prime minister in the hilarious sketches of ""Little Britain"") and the great Susan Hampshire whose resume reads like a history of british tv (from the original Fleur Forsyte in the black and white version of the Saga and many other classic mini-series and episodes of ""Masterpiece Theater"" to the 60s classic spy series ""Danger Man"" aka ""Secret Agent."") And, as always, the scenery is gorgeous and will have you pining for the Highlands.",1180569600,3,783,4.9393939393939394
2738485,5,B000MQ58X6,I love this one as much as the others. I think it is refreshing to have a change of characters and a new laird. I grew up on a multi - generation cattle ranch in the west and find related similar plot themes.  Tom Baker from the old Dr. Who series gives a new angle on the older gent living  on the estate.

2738486,1,B000MQ58X6,"When Monarch was in its earlier seasons, or series as the British call them, the characters were warm, funny, and endearing.  As the series progressed, we grew to love the zany antics of Duncan and Hector, watched Archie come to grips with his family and their situation, and all were very entertaining.  Slowly, each of the principles took their leave, and new characters were introduced to fill the gaps.  The problem with this was that by the time they reached Series Six, there were only a couple of original characters left and the magic was gone.  I knew it was over for me when they showed the phoney glint off Lexie's diamond wedding ring at the end of Series Four, while she was sweetly dancing with Archie.  Then and there the shark was being jumped...too bad.  It was great while it lasted, but when the main characters left, they should have stopped production.",1172793600,30,873,4.673202614379085
2738497,5,B000MQ58X6,"I had originally watched the series (minus the last season) on prime instant video. But - boo hoo - no Season 7 (the last one). So I bought that, got things tied up (happy endings for all), and realized it's a series I will watch more than once. SO........am watching for the other seasons to hit low prices (entire 7-season series is available as a boxed set now, but pricy), to purchase, and this one did. No hurry - I'll find the rest some day.",1393545600,,447,4.270588235294118
2738498,5,B000MQ58X6,"Great, great , great, super enjoyable, I love the box set - it is a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon (and evening) , the scenery, the characters and the story are each wonderful",1388016000,,182,4.228571428571429
2738499,2,B000MQ58X6,I know it was used but the listing said it was in good condition.  The first disk was scratched and would jump and missed part of the video,1381708800,,139,3.9642857142857144
2738500,4,B000MQ58X6,"The item arrived when it was supposed to. The item plays fine in the player. There was one disk that had some lose and was mving around in the case, but it does not seem to be scratched up bad enough to effect it playing.",1356998400,,221,3.933333333333333
2738501,5,B000MQ58X6,"This entire series is mesmorizing from the complex characters to the beautiful scene shots of Bonny Scotland herself. How could you NOT care about this ""family"".",1353110400,,161,5.230769230769231
2738502,1,B000MQ58X6,"This program is good through series 4.  Series 5 is iffy.  Series 6 is downright ridiculous.  The only good character left is Duncan.  Don't waste your time.  Bad writing, bad acting, I give up.",1315440000,2,194,4.588235294117647
2738503,3,B000MQ58X6,"We had enjoyed the original series and thought that the additional available series 5, 6 and 7 would be great.  We were sadly disappointed with series 6 & 7.",1277337600,,157,4.413793103448276
2738504,4,B000MQ58X6,"at the beginning the series looks very good with all the characters according the story but in the final seasons the lack of archie mcdonald, hector mcdonald and the introduction of the new ones give a minus to the story. it was to easy get rid of archie and never show again, what happen? he dies? he just disapears from the glenbogle story.
it appears than the writers wanted to enlarge the series and the original actors refuse to do it in that way and simple dissapear in a very easy way, leaving the audience in complete and unknow knoledge about them.
but seing the first four season is good enought to buy the complete series.",1232409600,,633,4.4655172413793105

  will make more of her  store line. She is a great  actress.",1231286400,,129,3.6666666666666665
2738506,3,B000MQ58X6,"With series 6, the show continues what I feel is a gradual slide downward. Gone is the good natured humor and sense of ""place"" that made the first few seasons so special. Now, we're subjected to an hour of bickering and all-too-predictable misunderstandings and jealousy on top of continual romantic musical chairs.

Is there any place in the world that really has only unmarried people on the lookout for love? EVERYONE in the series now is single (and most are young and trim: no middle aged or heavy set people -- except those who serve as the comic relief and buffoons -- no happily married couples, no children, no community life.

And people sure do get over lost loves REAL fast! I thought Archie was fickle, but fist Golly is deeply dedicated and in love with Molly, then --in two episodes -- it's Meg. Paul loves Lex, then Isabel, then Susan. Jess forgets Duncan real fast when someone new appears.

Everytime a new character is introduced, you can spot immediately that he/she will be someone's love interest!  Remember the show Hamish MacBeth? The variety of characters there was so much more interesting and 'real.'

Also, there is a complete lack of logic in the storylines. This HUGE estate, which is apparently involved in everything from raising wolves to offering an 'activity center', has almost no staff and no one seems to work!

Finally, the show has become, for the most part, ""generic"" in locale. Gone is the glimpse into Scottish clan life and history (hardly anyone even wears a kilt anymore!). Gone are the pipes and the ""feel"" of the country. Change their names from MacDonald to O'Reilly or Le Clerc and you'd never tell the difference.

Still, the show has its moments and I continue to watch in hopes that it will regain some of its past allure. And of course, I watch to see glorious shots of beautiful country and to listen to the most marvelous accents!",1212019200,9,1886,4.714285714285714
2738517,4,B000MQ58X6,"I fell in love with this show from the first time I saw it.  I have to admit the transition from Archie to Paul was hard for me, but after watching a few episodes where Paul was the main lead, he began to grow on me.  Now that this is the last series, I will miss both Archie AND Paul.  This is a great show, and one not to me missed.  Don't believe the reviews that tell you Series 6-7 are not as good as the first ones.  It just takes a little adjustment, but everything that you loved about the first 5 series is still in 6-7.",1194393600,4,529,3.861111111111111
2738518,4,B000MQ58X6,"I have been a fan of 'Monarch' for many years and still am. However, like many I prefer the earlier episodes. Why? Well, for me there are not enough cheerful Scots in the present series. At times 'Monarch' could be set in the Lake district! Lloyd Owen is excellent but he is very English both in accent and attitude, fair enough but the surrounding cast are universally mournful and the only one with any flair is Tom Baker, also English! Where is the enjoyable sparring of Hector and Kilwillie, the earthy attraction of Lexy, the sheer unbridled enthusiasm of Duncan? If a series is set in Scotland, particullarly one which plays up the romance of the Highlands, then lets have some tartan happiness and daftness and less English melancholy. The presence of Alexander Morton and Susan Hampshire ensure some continuity but the happy eccentricities of Hector, Duncan and Lexy are sorely missed. Still a wonderfully entertaining series but not as enjoyable.",1192924800,10,955,4.937888198757764
2738519,2,B000MQ58X6,"I purchased this product after reading (negative) reviews only for the sake of completeness of my library. I was really taken with this program, initially on PBS, and PBS screwed it all up by mixing episodes, unnecessary  reruns of previous series and never completing the series. So instead of donating to PBS, I bought the series. Previous reviewers are correct. The original charm was lost in the end with the gradual removal of key characters and some really contrived story lines. Plus they had to screw around with the morals of Lexi, who was the one true solid character. Too bad, but it was great while it lasted.",1191888000,5,621,4.75
2738520,5,B000MQ58X6,"I've been watchig Monach of the Glen on BBCA but would only get to see bits and pieces. By ordering the seasons of the show, I was able to see how the charactors I knew and how they evolve.  I just loved the story lines and the history and the conpanionship of the entire group.
By season six, some of the charactors had moved on, some new ones had been introduced and people like ""Golly"" are forever part of the show.
Love the show, but knowing I have only one more season makes me sad.",1190851200,3,487,4.126315789473685

2738522,5,B000MQ58X6,"I have loved this series from the beginning, and although there's a little lull in there while you get used to new characters, Series Six ends just as strong as the show ever was. I'd trade Hector for Uncle Donald any day -- wonderful character that gets better with each episode.",1187654400,4,280,4.509803921568627
2738523,4,B000MQ58X6,"The final season of Monarch of The Glen isn't as good as the first three when Hector was still alive, but it is still better than most anything available on broadcast TV.",1185580800,3,170,4.34375

2738525,4,B000MQ58X6,"Series 6 had some negative reports largely based on the changing charactors and themes.  I found that it did indeed lack some of the spark from the original cast we had all grown to love, however the new charactors offered some additionl flavor.  The elements of the series that have made it great remain. New scenes and locations were introduced and we see different sides to the old charactors that are consistent with the ageing process.  As Americans we may not have the patience for reality seeping into our ideal world - but I appreciate a series with the courage to deal with these subjects.  I found the DVD quality of series one through three poor but this has been corrected in the Series six copy.",1183248000,4,708,4.595238095238095
2738526,5,B000MQ58X6,"Not as good as the first five series, but it still has the same humor.  I would recommend getting these series to anyone.  I prefer Lloyd Owen in the title role, and I didn't see the point of having Lexie randomly in a few episodes.",1182902400,2,232,4.133333333333334

The many characters of Glenbogle soon began to feel like part of your family.  I just have one question - at the end of Series Six when Meg confronted Golly and informed him that she was pregnant, and they seemingly got back together, Golly and the baby  alone appeared  in Series Seven, which I purchased as a DVD from Amazon.  What happened to Meg - did she die in childbirth??  There was no mention of her in the last Series.  Please, someone fill me in!  There were too many characters that were just ""written off"" in the series.
