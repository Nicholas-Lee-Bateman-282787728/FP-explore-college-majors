8525203,2,B0084UVTJE,"The Tommy Dreamer-Hack Myers match was a back and forth match but nothing interesting really happens here. The Chad Austin-Don E. Allen match was a extreme dud. GET IT? The Tazmaniac-Pitbull #1-Dog Collar match was a simple brawl eveh if it was confusing at times. TheThe Bruise Brothers (Ron & Don Harris)-Mr. Hughes & Shane Douglas-Tag Team match was also a simple brawl too. The Tommy Cairo-Sandman-Cane on a Pole match was weak and the finish had no sense. The Terry & Dory Funk Jr.-The Public Enemy (Rocco Rock & Johnny Grunge)-tag team match was a just a brawl with two guys who really don't do actual moves, and two old fellows with a dumb DQ ending to boot. The Mikey Whipwreck-Rockin Rebel-TV title match was a short and a weak Big Lipped Alligator Momet. The Sabu-Cactus Jack match was a good bout, but had an extremely weak finish. I give this event a 4 out of 10.",1427068800,,875,4.544303797468355
