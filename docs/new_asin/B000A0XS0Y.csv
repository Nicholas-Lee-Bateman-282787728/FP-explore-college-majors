2348641,4,B000A0XS0Y,"Let me keep it simple. Wonderful opera with great cast, staging, orchestration, sound quality, video quality, costumes, libretto and plot, even sub-titles. So why just 4 stars? Ultimately I have to judge this opera compared to all of Verdi's operas and all operas. Il Trovatore is a 5 star opera to me.",1306368000,,302,4.826923076923077
2348642,5,B000A0XS0Y,"This is the kind of sumptuous traditional production that the Metropolitan does so well. Don Carlo is perhaps Domingo's best role. Quilico is very impressive.  Freni starts low-key, but that is because she knows that she will own the last act if she reserves the strength.  In the end, she succeeds brilliantly.",1200268800,3,311,4.961538461538462
2348643,5,B000A0XS0Y,I greatly enjoy the complete nature of this DVD. It includes the often omitted 1st act chorus whose removal robs the opera of so much of its power. Not to mention the lead singers are Domingo and Freni... need I say more.,1196640000,2,221,4.285714285714286
2348644,5,B000A0XS0Y,"This is an outstanding performance on DVD of one of the grandest of Operas ever composed by Verdi. I would rate it 5 stars but with some strong reservations.

This is the most complete performance of the opera available and that in a way must be a tribute to the conductor James Levine.

Placido Domingo as Don Carlos gives one of his best performances ever, recorded on any medium.  He sings beautifully, with great passion and fulfils the vocal demands of the role with great ease and authority.  His acting and visual impression of the role are excellent. He plays the part of the unfortunate rebel-prince very convincingly. I can hardly think of anyone who could have been better as Don Carlos in any production ever.

Mirella Freni provides us with an excellent vocal and visual interpretation of the young Queen of Spain. She is alas, a touch past her prime, at least visually (unfortunately none of us remains young for ever) but none the less, she provides us with a very moving performance, beautifully sung. If one listens to her outstanding performance of the same role on CD under Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra recorded in 1978, five years earlier, then my point will become clearer.

Grace Bumbry is a veteran in the role of Eboli. Vocally she is very good. Visually, she portrays the princes with great conviction, but especially in her case she is someone far too old for the role she is portraying. I feel that Baltsa on the Sony DVD with Karajan s better.

Louis Quilico makes a good realisation of the role of Rodrigo. He is visually and vocally adequate, without being in any sense outstanding. Cappuccilli on Sony is far better and Gobbi's performance for E.M.I. on the 1954 CD is at a totally different level.

Ghiaurov is also a veteran at the role of the King of Spain. He provides us with an strong portrayal of the King, but not really exceptional. He is vocally ample for the role and plays the part convincingly. One has only to listen to Christoff on the 1954 CD from E.M.I. to realise what an ideal exponent of the role can be. Visually, Christoff at Covent Garden in the late fifties and early sixties, under the direction of Visconti also provided us with a visual interpretation of the part, unlikely to be equalled in the near future. Ramey in the E.M.I. DVD from La Scala provides us with a much better performance, both vocally and visually.

Furlanetto is simply bad and inadequate for the role of the Inquisitor, both vocally and visually. He is even worse as Phillip on the Sony DVD under Karajan.

James Levine in my opinion is a mediocre conductor for Verdi. He cannot make the music flow or portray the passion that either Karajan for Sony or Muti for E.M.I. are far more capable of. A pity because, as I said to begin with, it is to his great credit that he provides us with such a complete performance of this important work.

The production by John Dexter is good, with nice sets and costumes but rather dark lighting, especially in the first act.  The Metropolitan combines acts 1 & 2 and acts 4 & 5 and names it a 3 act opera, which is not.  This is only a minor point. If you really want to see a lavish Don Carlo on DVD go to the E.M.I. from La Scala staged by Zeffirelli. Not as good as either of the Visconti productions for London or Rome, but none the less spectacular.

The image and the sound on this Deutsche Grammophon two DVD edition are good for 1983, although I have seen better from the same period. It is preferable to the the One-disc version of the same performance on Pioneer Classics.

It is definitely worth buying.",1150329600,24,3597,4.546439628482972
8071795,5,B000A0XS0Y,It's not easy to steal the show from Placido.  He is as always excellent.  But Grace Bumbry steals the show.  I have watched this twice so far and what I cannot get out of my head is Grace Bumbry.  Wow!  ~ Celeste Downey,1476921600,,220,4.023255813953488

8071797,4,B000A0XS0Y,"I like this DVD and do not disagree with anything that has been said about it. My comment has to do with the fact that the DVD I received is in three acts not five. The cover looks exactly the same, but apparently I received an abbreviated version of the opera. I also have the 2013 Salzberg Festival conducted by Antonio Pappano version of this opera which IS five acts, so I know what I am missing.

Maybe the ""remastered"" designation is significant. Oh well - live and learn.",1450137600,2,478,4.370786516853933

8071800,4,B000A0XS0Y,"When a great opera is sung by competent singers and conducted by a conductor who clearly believes in it, then you have to at least ""like"" it.  If that phrasing suggests a reservation or two, it's mainly because one can't help but just wish that many of the principals here were 15 to 20 years younger.  Ghiaurov, Freni, and Bumbry were great voices in their time, and they are still effective here -- good enough musicians to put over the quite heavy vocal and expressive demands of their roles.  Louis Quilico was never quite in that league, and he sounds a bit spread and woofy in places here, but he works hard and effectively to bring Rodrigo to life.  Placido Domingo recorded his first Don Carlo, for EMI with Giulini, about 15 years before this production, but he looks and sounds fine here -- in the early 1980's he was doing very good Otellos and Lohengrins too, and Furlanetto, still in his 30's, brings a rich, young voice to an old part and succeeds in making the Grand Inquisitor vocally as well as expressively formidable.  Levine brings both weight and energy to the score, and that reading fits well with the overall ""traditional"" design and production -- the Met's wardrobe budget must have been severely taxed, but everybody looks splendid.  Freni, almost 50 at the time of this production, looks very good.  She sings a bit carefully, her degree of movement determined by her prime focus in getting the notes and phrasing as she wants them -- contrast the greater physical freedom of Mattila's performance in the 1996 Paris account -- but Freni is a  resourceful singing actress and knows how to make the role work for her.  I'm one of those who think this was a role she never should have taken, but that's partly a sentimental response; no serious actress is going to want to be singing Mimis and Susannas for ever.  Mattila has a voice for Janacek and Beethoven's Leonore, and Elizabeth of Valois is much more in her comfort zone that it is in Freni's.  Domingo too by this time knew how to combine singing and acting, and he's a good-looking and good-sounding Carlo.  Bumbry, who recorded Eboli for Solti in 1965, still has it in her -- vocally more comfortable in the Veil Song than Waltraud Meier in Pappano's 1996 account, although Meier creates a ""needier,"" less stable and dignified character than Bumbry.  Ghiaurov sounds a bit rusty, but Philip II is an old guy, and Ghiaurov brings pathos, authority, and a voice that still has some of its distinctive beauty to the role, one that he sang many times.  So there you have it . . . old pros who know what they're doing, bringing the music to life, in a production that captures the heavy, dark, oppressive atmosphere of Philip's court.  You can understand why Elizabeth would rather be back in France, as she makes clear in the scene -- beautifully done -- where she sings her goodbye to the old friend her husband has sent back home for failing to keep his wife, as we would now say, under surveillance.  Good work from the Met chorus too -- the opening contains music, much of it choral, that I hadn't heard before, and they are very strong throughout.

I've referenced the Pappano 1996 Paris production in a couple of places above.  You should get it too.  It's the French version and it's just a different beast.  I'm tempted to say that it's a French opera (and not just because of the language) -- stylistically it's lighter and more fluid.  It's good to have both that one and this one.",1424131200,9,3471,4.6022727272727275

Figuring that I may have scratched the disc, I ordered another DVD.
