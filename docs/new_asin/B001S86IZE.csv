3784943,5,B001S86IZE,"Looking at the series objectively, Season 6 is  the best season so far released on DVD. The early seasons evoke more nostalgia in some people, and that's ok.  However, if  you look at the early years of Mission: Impossible it seemed that almost every episode took place in some make-believe east bloc communist country,with phony accents and uniforms. Season 6 is different and more exciting. The episodes take place mainly in the USA and brings organized crime into the element. The scripts are tight, more believable,  and the cast works together like a fine swiss watch. Great viewing, even though the episodes are almost 40 yrs old. Highly recommend.",1244073600,23,654,4.972477064220183

3784946,3,B001S86IZE,"""Mission: Impossible - The Sixth TV Season""  is a six-disc box set featuring all 22 episodes from the 1971-1972 season.  Known for its jazzy theme by Lalo Schifrin, this series ran from 1966 to 1990, one of the longest runs for a TV drama.  The formula remained essentially the same throughout, though there were cast changes through the years.  At the beginning of each show, the leader of the Impossible Missions Force, a group of highly trained government agents, receives a tape-recorded message outlining instructions for an assignment he was to consider taking.  The rest of the program shows how the team plans, sets the stage with intricate, covert preparations, and executes the assignment.
 Plans generally include assuming identities, make-up and disguises, rigging equipment, and plain old guts.  Risk is always present.  Discovery will mean failure and possibly death, so teamwork is essential.  The team consists of leader Jim Phelps (Peter Graves), electronics wizard Barney Collier (Greg Morris), muscle man Willie Armitage (Peter Lupus), and makeup artist Casey (Lynda Day George).  During the sixth season, Jim and his team focus primarily on targets outside the reach of conventional law enforcement agencies and bring master criminals, corrupt politicians, and syndicate bosses to justice.",1243036800,,1309,5.435643564356436
3784947,5,B001S86IZE,"in my opinion this season has the best casts  everyone fits together
equally. this season had clever stories, and they are easier to  follow.
i think the addition of LYNDA DAY GEORGE (casey) was a very smart move.
she added class, beauty, and excellent skills. the episode with william
shanter when the team transports him back in time is one of the  most
imiginative stories ever brought to the series. the  episode was filmed
in black and white. in this season i  really enjoy the chemistry with
all the cast  members. i think this season got back to being what made
the first season so amazing. there are so many  episodes in this season
which are among my favorite. this series has better stories,  acting,
 suspense, and drama. i find this season to one of the best. and the
music and opening sequences are also  appreciated. GREAT SEASON",1240876800,5,843,4.635135135135135
3784948,3,B001S86IZE,"I agrre with mr. Schoditsch's comment regarding the switch away from picture discs.  Not only with this series, bur oh so many.  When we collect year after year of our favorite shows, continuity should reign.  It's an important easthetic.  CBS shows are now almost exclusively on non-picture discs.  At least, studios, when many seasons have already been released on pic-discs, please continue so. (Another ex., Bewitched: Seasons 1-5, pic-discs; Seasons 6 & 7, non-picture).

I gave a 2-star penalty for this, but the show episode's content - 5 stars.",1239321600,5,552,5.146067415730337
3784949,4,B001S86IZE,"The IMF's penultimate sixth TV Season brings us a fresh face and again a renewed sense of story. Gone are Leonard Nimoy and Lesley Ann Warren but in with the talented & beautiful Lynda Day George!  (Sam Elliott as Doug drops in for his last appearance in episode 2).  This season continues with contemporary adaptations for its time while still carrying the agenda of its kernel formula.

Again my one star deduction is for the DVDs NOT being picture discs as with the first four season set releases. Continuing on with picture discs would have been nice with the addition of new member Lynda Day George as 'Lisa Casey' to the IMF this season.  But still, it's great to have the whole season of 22 episodes at a nice price!

Paramount has been fairly consistent with their release schedule of MI.  Their mission, and we sure hope they accept it, is to release the final Seventh Season AND the 35 episodes of the 1988-89 version.",1234310400,11,928,4.593939393939394
3784950,5,B001S86IZE,"Good morning. This is the sixth season (1971-1972) of ""Mission: Impossible"" which is again produced by Bruce Lansbury (from season 4 and 5) and supervised by top writer Laurence Heath who also produces six episodes. The series returns to its genesis (the original theme music, a sophisticated leading lady) and solely focuses on the American gangsters threat also known as the Syndicate: the IMF now does Feds jobs instead of Secret Service operations.

There're substantial changes: find a small crew of four IMF agents, a new and real ""glamorous"" leading lady named Lisa Casey (played by Lynda Day George) who also replaces the master of disguises Paris, the departure of Dr. Doug Robert (which appears once in ""Encore"") and character Barney who becomes a major asset for the plots and displays his acting knacks, especially in ""Mindbend"" as a brainwashed fugitive, ""Blues"" as a junky soul music performer in which he sings twice: ""Judy's Gone Now"" and Otis Redding's ""Sittin' on the Dock of the Bay"", ""Image"" as a Tarot dealer and he plays twice a master of disguises (actually, his new talent was first shown in the season 5 ""The Hostage""): in ""Underwater replacing a gangster's henchman and in ""Bag Woman"" replacing a gangster's right-hand man. A brand new director popsup named Leslie H. Martinson who achieves the masterpiece ""Invasion"" and will blossom next season.

Above all, this is a showcase for actress Lynda Day George who not only act--her best efforts are highlit in ""The Bride"" and in ""Committed""--but performs a song (""The Gentle Rain"") in ""Trapped"" and we witness her husband Christopher George in ""Nerves"".

Top episodes are still here as ""Encore"" (guest starring William Shatner as an old gangster who believes traveling into his own past: June 30, 1937), ""Invasion"" (an unusual espionage intrigue, guest starring Kevin McCarthy as an American defector who thinks that America has been taken over by the Soviet army), ""Mindbend"" (a disturbing plot, guest starring Donald Moffat, about brainwashed small-time criminals trained like Pavlov's dogs to kill politicians which foreshadows Alan J. Pakula's ""The Parallax View"") and fine episodes are numerous as ""Blind"" (in which Peter Graves gives his best performance as a corrupted Federal agent by simulating the pathology of blindness combined with alcoholism), ""The Tram"" (from a story written by scripts genius Paul Playdon and guest starring Victor French), ""The Miracle"" (guest starring Joe Don Baker as a Christianism-hating drug dealer who is conditioned by the IMF to become his moral opposite: good!), ""Underwater"" (guest starring Fritz Weaver and Jeremy Slate), ""Blues"" (guest starring William Windom), ""The Connection"" (guest starring Anthony Zerbe), ""The Bride"" (guest starring James Gregory), ""Committed"", ""Bag Woman"" (guest starring Robert Colbert and Georg Stanford Brown), ""Casino"" (guest starring Jack Cassidy). As usual, the music scores are inspired, especially ""Blind"" by Benny Golson who launches the sound of the Syndicate,  ""Run for the Money"" by Robert Drasnin, ""Encore"" and ""The Miracle"" by Lalo Schifrin, ""Mindbend"" by Robert Prince who composes a modernist electronic music.",1234310400,33,3170,5.359437751004016

3784975,4,B001S86IZE,"Season 6 is really quite good. Linda Day George is the best replacement yet for Barbara Bain. In fact, I think she's even a little bit better actress than Barabara. I miss the foreign country missions. With almost every episode being about the ""syndicate"" the themes are a little too repetitive. But the actual plots are still very clever and varied. I liked Barny better when he stuck to electronics and demolition.

3784988,5,B001S86IZE,"Mission Impossible returns to good form with two much-needed reforms. Every member of this team is now a seasoned professional. The salt-and-pepper team of Willy Armitage and Barney Collier are back. (They were the only two who stayed with the show through its seven seasons.) Sam Elliott as Doug Roberts is gone. And: no more stage performers (Paris), and no more flighty flower girls (Dana). In their place: a professional who clearly must have come from the intelligence or law-enforcement community--most likely the FBI. And it shows.

The show opens well, with possibly the best and most thoroughgoing and risky imposture Jim Phelps ever takes on. (""A blind man--now you gotta picture this--a *blind man* with the Dee Tees!"") Barney also gets some serious imposture roles to play, and shows he has talents beyond building gizmos. (In one, he shows he has a set of pipes that could have given Nat King Cole a run for his money.)",1474243200,5,932,4.89873417721519

3785097,5,B001S86IZE,"I now have two through the sixth season and I like them all.  As I have written before I was just a teenager when I first saw Mission Impossible and liked it then. After all these years and over 30 years in law enforcement I like it even better. It just doesn't get old other than the cars and trucks and I love seeing those old rides again. I even get to see some of the same type patrol cars we used in the 70s. Of course Plymouth has gone, but the doges are back. My mother always told me what goes around comes around and she as always knew what she was talking about because the Dodge Charger patrol care is back and I love them. I have to say this show was far ahead of its time. I am going to stop at season seven as I understand the few later shows were not as good as the first round.

3785125,2,B001S86IZE,"It may be true as others have said that these episodes are in fact more realistic and believable than some of those from the early seasons.  The episodes may have been written and acted well.  But it is clear that the series has started its down hill ride given this season.

1. The cast has been reduced in size.  Five seemed like the magic number to me.

2. The skills of such a talented set of spies is being wasted on domestic problems?  Come on... did all the despots trying to destroy the world take a vacation?  It may be that these episodes are well written and acted, but it is insulting to me to see ""the greatest spies in the world"" used for such mundane tasks.

3. How many times can you go back to the same well ""local law enforcement is unable to deal with the problem"" so you guys have to take down the bad boy crime bosses.  This common theme relegated the series to being mostly the same as other police shows.

Don't get me wrong.  MI is a great series, and these seasons are just as good as anything else from that era.  But I was not watching MI to see something that was just as good as everything else.

Amazon has a sale on the entire series from time to time.  That is how I got mine.  If you want it, wait for it, then go for the whole ball of wax.

it is also great to see a 52 minute production.  not 40 or 42 as it is now.  i guess back in the day the studios figured it needed only 8 minutes worth of commercials to grab your cash instead of the 20 or so commercials minutes today.

I remember in the third season to present some of the characters change, for example in the third season Martin landau and Barbara Bain leaving the show in its place came Mr Spock (Leonard Nimoy) from the Star Trek Tee Vee Show for the fourth Season.

In the fifth season fifth with Lesley Ann Warren and Sam Elliott. And the sixth season with Linda Day George. and always with original cast are Peter Graves, Greg Morris and Peter Lupus.

I thought it would be a little less since the content was less than the others.

Be that as it may, it was still a thrilling season and so much fun to watch.  I didn't remember that there were seven seasons.  I know that shortly there will be no more ""missions,"" but what there is, I shall add to my collection and be overjoyed to have them.  I'm just hoping that Season seven doesn't have just two DVDs for $34.95.

3785226,3,B001S86IZE,"I loved the old Mission Impossible series. It was way better than the Tom Cruise movies, with all the sense of adventure and teamwork which the movies lacked. Unfortunately, by the sixth season, the series seemed to have become a little tired. Martin Landau and Barbara Bain were long gone, and Leonard Nimoy, who provided much of the life in Seasons 4 and 5 was now out of the series as well. The international nature of previous seasons had also departed, with most Season 6 episodes covering activities of the ""syndicate"" which ""conventional law enforcement agencies"" had been unable to combat.

Although this classic series is always interesting, and way better than the movies, for anyone who loves the series and doesn't have any of the DVDs, I would recommend seasons 2 through 5 (Season 1 is good, but the series became much better with the arrival of Peter Graves, playing the team leader Jim Phelps, at the beginning of Season 2) over this rather tired effort.",1246665600,22,970,4.808383233532934
3785227,4,B001S86IZE,"Bruce Geller was the creator and Executive Producer of Mission: Impossible which is probably the finest dramatic television series of all time. Unfortunatley, his perfectionism grated on the studio and the network and he was finally forced out.  The results of this and the consequent serious decline in the show's quality becomes apparent in this Sixth season.
The first problem was due to ""political correctness"" of the period which was the early 1970's. At that time, US involvement in the War in Vietnam made many people feel the United States shouldn't ""interfere"" in other countries' affairs and the producers of the show decided to respond to this by ending the show's emphasis on international intrigue which was the staple of the shows's first four seaons and which was still visible in season 5, although less so.  It was decided to switch to having the Impossible Missions Force concentrate on the fight against ""the syndicate""  (it was politically incorrect also to use the word ""Mafia"" at the time) in ways the ""conventional law enforcement agencies"" couldn't utilize, as the voice on the opening taped message would point out. Of course, the Watergate scandal a few short years later would make these types of activities which infringed on the constitutional rights of the subjects of the IMF's activities also ""politically incorrect"" as well, but the show had been cancelled by that time.
As a result, the large majority of episodes became endless repeats of the theme of taking two partners in an organized criminal enterprise and turning them against one another. For me, seeing a small team of experts taking on a tyrannical, totalitarian regime from the inside is much more exciting than using the same  abilities to incriminate a couple of pathetic criminals who often seem like a bunch of saps for falling for the obvious frame-ups concoted by the IMF.  This simply becomes overkill and one occasionally ends up feeling sorry for the bad guys simply because they don't have a chance. A good example of this is the ridiculous ""Encore"" episode starring William Shatner, where he is somehow convinced that he is suddenly 30 years younger.
Even an episode written by Mission: Impossible's most imaginative writer, Paul Playdon (""The Tram""-his last for MI) was ruined by poor directing, exemplified when we enter a room where a gathering of the top Mafia (oops, I meant to say ""syndicate"") people in the US are planning their operations for the future, and every single one of the men has a really mean scowl on his face as if they are saying to each other, ""yes, indeed, gentlemen, we really are bad guys!"". I burst out laughing when I saw that, it looked so unnatural-in real life, even mobsters can joke around. Other episodes which had fine actors and had potential for interesting stories had things ruined by introducing artifical ""excitement"" created by unlikely coincidences and occurrances . One example is ""The Connection"" starring Anthony Zerbe who had made several appearances in MI in previous seasons. This time, the writers came up with a story  that was really  uninteresting, and which didn't use Zerbe's outstanding acting abilities, so in order to juice things up for the audience they writers came up with a ""stowaway"" which introduced nonsensicle ""crises"" for the IMF to overcome.
Having said all this, by and large, the stories are still fairly entertaining and still better than most of the dramatic stories on television. If you are new to Mission: Impossible, I would recommend starting with seasons 2-4, then seasons 1 and 5 and only then, for the sake of completeness would I purchase this Sixth Season.",1245628800,11,3646,4.996705107084019
