7861196,5,6304061323,"This was one of the early films to try to reach a broad audience on the subject of HIV and AIDS (released long before we had more than AZT soon after an HIV test was available).
The cast is tremendous. Julie Andrews plays the successful business woman concerned about the health of her gay son (played by a young Hugh Grant) and his dying partner. Ann Margaret plays the ignorant Arkansas trailer park resident who has disowned her gay son. It is a strong contrast between a mother's unconditional love and acceptance of her gay son, and the conditional love of a mother who rejects her gay son.
Through stubborn determination, the loving, accepting mother goes cross country to collect the reluctant hateful mother to force a reconciliation. There is some progress made as the four converge at the home of the accepting mother and argue over homosexuality, HIV and AIDS, the nature of homosexuals, and especially the dying, and acceptance vs judgement.
SPOILER ALERT: since this is before 1996 and alternative drugs, one son dies. But the way that his death is dealt with is the surprise of the film.
The message of the film, unconditional love of mother's for their sons is still poignant and relevant.",1184457600,,1204,4.793269230769231
