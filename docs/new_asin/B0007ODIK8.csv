8049527,3,B0007ODIK8,"Fair, for its time, early 30's creaky murder mystery.  While in India an extremely obnoxious archaeologist disrespects the local people and customs, insults and offends resident Europeans, and to cap off his stay, with the help of a belly dancer steals a temple treasure and kills the guardian gorilla.  A gorilla in India?  The Hindu priest lays a whammy on the thief which follows him for twenty years.  Has the requisite spooky house with hidden passageways, potential heirs (and murder fodder), and bumbling detectives.  The film is only about 62 minutes long and has no background music to liven things up.  The Alpha Video DVD is not bad quality but needs re-mastering.  Being an obscure B-grade film, will probably not get it anytime soon.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1515110400,,782,4.961538461538462

8049529,4,B0007ODIK8,"The usual ingredients are here: an old house, a curse, greed, murder, bungling cops, and a stuffed ape acting as Objet d'art.  There's humor to be had and some monkey business.  The Prendergast Archaeological Expedition Shareholders are gathered at the Prendergast home, ostensibly to gain their share of some ill-gotten goods.  Their host is a sneaky individual with a sob story they accept, requiring them to remain in his house where they can be conveniently picked off one at a time, their necks broken.  But first, a sance!  Where Pocahontas is summoned to tell them where the treasure is hidden.  Instead, they have their first victim.  ""Dead as prohibition!  Who did it?""  After that, it's just a matter of divide and conquer.  The cops arrive accusing everyone.

A tad silly at times, this short feature is nonetheless entertaining.  I especially enjoyed Mary Foy as Mrs. Hyacinth Potter, a shrew of some magnitude, forever scolding her befuddled husband (Harry C. Bradley as Prof. Horatio Potter).  The rest of the characters are stock.  It's predictable but I expected that.  The transfer is adequate.",1435622400,,1111,5.060773480662983

Quality of their unrestored movie transfers varies from fair to good, based on condition of film stock and source material (often old 16mm broadcast prints). The only extras provided are a catalog insert and DVD-accessible title list.

Although artwork indicates this film is called THE House of Mystery, that's a 1938 Jack Holt movie. This one (according to imdb) is HOUSE OF MYSTERY (1934).

If you like guys in fakey gorilla costumes, have I got a movie for you!

In a somewhat comedic programmer, an American archaeologist (Clay Clement) kills a consecrated monkey while visiting India. Twenty years later, the curse of a temple priest (Brandon Hurst) plus the aforementioned ""gorilla"" bring grief to him and some investors. They want their share of jewels the monkey-killer stole before returning home. Hearing that others who received some of the precious stones died violently soon after dosen't dissuade them. They're told by the now wheelchair-bound archaeologist that they must stay in his creepy house for a week before getting anything. Thus, people start mysteriously dying.

Ed Lowry's cinematic career is slight: two silent shorts as a youth and this early MONOGRAM programmer. Lowry's character here, 'Jack' Armstrong is not to be confused with radio's All-American Boy.
