The information is essential because so many people have NO IDEA what is behind the smart meter grid movement. It's not just a simpler way for the electric utility to measure your electric usage. There are significant health concerns, significant privacy invasion concerns, and significant civil rights concerns related to the sweeping invasion of smart meters. Things you won't ever be told by your electric company, or if you ask, they may very well lie to you. You MUST see this movie, and share it with all your friends and neighbors. Even if you don't buy the DVD here, go to your library and check it out. This information is ESSENTIAL.",1382313600,18,725,4.761904761904762

5990535,5,B00FFI77IU,"Everyone needs to watch this documentary!  So few folks are aware of the danger from smart meters to our personal health and also the vulnerability that comes for America to get on a world wide grid.  This grid is easy to hack and weakens America by the possibility of being shut down through shutting down our electricity.  This documentary shows the proof of all of the above.  An informed America is a safer America.  This documentary should be watched two or three times just to absorb all the information it contains...buy two and share it with your friends and family.  You need to know what your rights are concerning these smart meters.  Many towns are fighting these meters...you will learn all about this from this documentary.  It is vital that we all work to take back our power.  Thank God for those who make this documentary.  I have bought three copies and will most likely buy more.

5990539,5,B00FFI77IU,"One of the demonstrations Josh del Sol uses in his ""Take Back Your Power: Investigating the Smart Grid"" is with the head of a ""Crash Test Dummy.""  He shows how RF waves within the ""safe"" range will not heat up the dummy's head - and the head would have to heat up one degree to pose a ""thermal"" danger to humans.  And if you go to the FCC's website, you'll find that this thermal danger is the only verifiable danger posed by RF waves.  That's because the FCC hedges on possible cellular damage with the old ""needs more investigation.""

OK, stop the presses right here and now!  If the FCC acknowledges that additional testing is needed regarding possible cellular damage, should it not have withheld approval of the Smart Grid with its army of Smart Meters until such testing could determine with a fair degree of certainty one way or the other if there was a hazard to humans?  That's a rhetorical question, of course - because there was no way the FCC was ever going to put the brakes on something that's already been decided by, let's call them ""higher authorities.""  And that's been the bottom line of just about every decision of every government agency since at least 1980.

But as Josh del Sol shows again and again, there has indeed been a wealth of testing - literally, thousands of tests.  And these tests have shows again and again that there is indeed a hazard to humans from even the so-called ""safe"" RF levels.  One of the things I wanted to write down so I'd have a handy reference was a listing of certain adverse reactions at certain levels (this can be located at 45 minutes into the DVD).  At 0.1, there is ""extreme concern""; at 1.0, there is sperm DNA fragmentation, headaches, dizziness, fatigue, chest pains, indigestion; at 2.5, there is altered calcium metabolism in the heart; at 4.0, there is changes in the hippocampus, resulting in memory and learning problems; at 6.0, there is DNA damage to cells.  Bear that in mind when you consider that the FCC's ""safe"" level of RF exposure is 600 to 1000.  Because, you see, at that ""safe"" level, your brain will not be souffled by the thermal properties of RF radiation - so don't worry, be happy.

The reason I'm particularly concerned with the 0.01 to 6.0 range is that's the range the RF Detector I bought records.  It shows 0.01 to be generally safe for everyone; and 0.1 may produce symptoms; and 1.0 is too high for people with greater RF sensitivity; and 3.0 and 6.0 are unsafe for everyone.  Yet the FCC considers 600 to 1000 to be ""safe.""  I really don't think anything further needs to be said, does it?",1400025600,4,2583,4.544276457883369
5990540,5,B00FFI77IU,"I have viewed this film twice since it was first released in September of 2013, and it is quite impressive. Although the film maintains a strong focus on ""Smart Meter"" intrusions into private lives, there are a number of excellent interviews with health professionals which clearly define the deleterious effects of microwave radiation on biological cells and tissues. The film makes many strong points concerning Federal and International invasion of personal privacy and security issues (see UN Agenda 21) yet In my opinion, our current and future health crisis's is where the focus should remain.
Humanity's failed corporate/industrial paradigm must be understood and addressed in mass. Proliferation of dangerous EM radiation technologies are poorly realized by the citizen public, and this information should be disseminated in future exposs. Environmental health should become the PRIMARY focus in all economic and political reform. We simply cannot and should not allow corrupted science and corporate politics to dictate the terms of our survival. Bravo to Josh del Sol and those who contributed to this very important film.",1394236800,6,1132,5.511494252873563
5990541,5,B00FFI77IU,"The reviewer who states that ""visible light"" emits radio frequency (RF) radiation just as smart meters do is incorrect.  Both visible light and RF fall into what's referred to as ""the electromagnetic spectrum.""  But that's where their similarities end.

Visible light, obviously, is a natural frequency in the environment. The human body needs visible light in order to produce vitamin D (vitamin D is produced in the skin) and in order to produce melatonin (in the pineal gland).  TOO MUCH visible light, of course, has detrimental effects, leading to  sunburn -- and over time, skin cancers.

In contrast, the vast majority of radio frequencies we're exposed to these days are NOT NATURAL at all, but rather, a man-made. The human body does not need this radiation for any purpose.  And in fact, frequencies from smart meters and other wireless devices are extremely detrimental to the body. This is because we are electrical beings.  Our cells are continuously communicating with one other via electrical signals.

Although scientists don't have all the answers, it is known that the exposure to the 'informational content' of the RF (generated by smart meters and other wireless devices) easily penetrates the body, and interferes with intercellular communications. This results in less-than-optimal functioning -- over time leading to cancer and other potentially devastating diseases.

Most people don't realize that the radiation emitted by smart meters (and other wireless devices - cell towers, cell phones, WiFi, cordless phones, and sadly even baby monitors) falls into the MICROWAVE portion of the radio frequency spectrum.  This explains why these signals so easily penetrate buildings -- and the human body.  This radiation is harmful because we have not yet had time (i.e., hundreds of thousands of years) to evolve protective defense mechanisms.  - Up until recently, the only microwaves that occurred naturally in the environment were from outer space, and these are mostly filtered-out by the earth's atmosphere.

5990542,5,B00FFI77IU,"First search for a 10 minute UK video by Truthseekers titled ""Cell Phones More Deadly Than Cigarettes"" and watch this excellent 10 minute video:
[...]

Now that you have seen proof that the Telecom Industry ""War Games"" the science, we can move on to other facts.

Search You Tube for a video showing how Dark Field Microscopy clearly shows blood cells immediately damaged upon RF exposure:

[...]

You will see that out of 3 people tested, only one actually immediately felt the negative effects of the radiation, however, all 3 experienced immediate cell damage upon exposure at a microscopic level...which means whether we ""feel"" it or not, it IS harming us!

 The prior posting by ""MB"" represents the same ridiculous lies & deceit that we have been spoon fed for decades!  Time to wake up people!  ""Take Back Your Power"" exposes the sham that our Government calls ""science"" & very clearly illustrates how it has been pulled off.  Our Government along with the FCC, the FDA, & the W.H.O. are all complicit in creating a public health catastrophe in regard to the ever-increasing Global prolific RF/Microwave RADIATION exposure.  And yes it is called ""Radiation"". That is what a top level FCC official called it when I spoke to him!  Find out for yourself & get it straight from the horse's mouth.  I encourage you to call the FCC for yourself.  They are the one's solely in charge of you & your children's health & well-being.  The FCC is solely in charge of RF ""safety"", exposure levels, & public awareness in regard to RF/Microwave radiation warnings on device labels (which are NON-EXISTENT).  President Obama recently appointed Tom Wheeler, former CTIA Lobbyist for Big Telecom, as the head of the FCC!  Is this a conflict of interest??  Mr Wheeler says ""Cell Phones are safe"".  Here is the FCC phone number: (202) 418-0600.  Ask the FCC if they can absolutely guarantee you in writing that RF/Microwave radiation exposure at any level is ""SAFE"" to humans or animals?  The answer is NO, & it will never be proven ""SAFE"".  Then ask the FCC if it is not proven safe & over 6000 unbiased scientific studies (including the 2007 & 2012 BioInitiative Reports [...]  & multiple U.S. Army/Navy reports [...] )  clearly say it is unsafe for humans, then why are we & our children allowed to be forcibly bathed in ever-increasing RF radiation daily with no safety limits what-so-ever?  They have no answer for that question, because they have been criminally complicit in misleading & misinforming the Public they are publicly funded to PROTECT!

Don't be fooled...there are NO SAFETY LIMITS!  Then ask the FCC why they consider RF/Microwave radiation safe?  The answer will be that it is because ""if it does not thermally heat your tissue, then it must be safe"".  This is arcane science at best, & completely laughable!  They ignore over 6000 scientific studies that say it is unsafe & pretend they do not exist.

 Next ask the FCC where are all of the studies that proved that this radiation was safe before they rolled out all these cell towers, smart phones, cordless phones, & smart meters?  The answer is: ""there were no studies done to prove it was safe before it was rolled out on the public, & there still are no unbiased non-Telecom funded studies definitively proving it is safe"".

Next ask the FCC what is the difference between 1G, 2G, 3G, & 4G?  They will tell you that every time they increase a ""G or Generation"" they significantly increase the number of frequencies at all the base stations (cell towers) & it is a ""DRASTIC INCREASE IN RADIATION EXPOSURE TO EVERYONE"".  This is exactly word for word what a top FCC official told me.  Not only is a 4G tower many times more powerful than a 2G or 3G tower, but so are the newer 3G & 4G Smartphones.  These phones constantly roam for towers & radiate the user & everyone around them for long distances.  Every time a tower is connected to, it blasts radiation & highly exposes everyone for a long distance in all directions.  Did you hear about Apple iPhone 7's making people sick?  Yes they covered it up by saying it was ""motion sickness"", but don't be fooled...you will be hearing much more like this as the radiation levels keep increasing & so many people are being exposed 24/7 to this man-made radiation which is MILLIONS of times higher than humankind has EVER been exposed to!  Ask the FCC for yourself if Mankind has ever been exposed to these levels of this type of radiation?  Ask them if that is so, then how can they be so sure it is safe to allow children of all ages to be bathed in high level RF all day long at school, by their phones in their pockets, by the constantly emitting wireless routers at home, & the smartphone under their pillow at night?  Yes over 80% of teenagers sleep with their phone under their pillows!  The link to RF exposure with Autism & ADHD is undeniable folks.  This video will show you the actual data correlation.  It is a FACT.  All you have to do is take a look around you.  Start looking at who has problems & how much RF exposure did they or do they have?  RF exposure during pregnancy is crucial.  Do some research on your own in regard to RF & children.  Go to You Tube & search wi-fi in schools:

[...]

Ask the FCC, if RF/Microwave radiation is classified by the W.H.O. as a Level 2B possible human carcinogen (like DDT, lead paint, car exhaust, HIV, & power lines) then why are our children now forced to use wireless in school?

Then ask why the 1996 Telecommunications Act specifically prevents the stoppage or removal of a cell tower based on human health hazard concerns?

Then go to the FCC Website:  [...]

Search the two FCC dockets (13-84 & 03-137) ""re-investigating the safety of RF"".  Go to ""search for filing"" & type in 13-84 or 03-137.  Read for yourself the hundreds of testimonials & data by actual scientists, researchers, & people who are suffering from the effects of RF exposure.  If you are one who is suffering, then this is your golden opportunity to post or ""submit"" your own filing, sharing your personal experience, & make it part of the official public record!  The FCC purposefully made their site with these dockets very difficult to find, with no Media exposure, & very user-unfriendly, so take your time & call for instructions if needed.

I have 9 years professional experience in health care with Radiology & Blood Lab.  I also have 5 years of Military experience working with airborne early warning radar aircraft.  I understand what ionizing & non ionizing radiation is & how BOTH of them are absolutely harmful to any biological living organism.  The last 3 years working in health care has been a real eye opener for me, because I have personally seen how so many people are suffering from the ever increasing levels of RF/Microwave exposure, & no one has any idea where their problems are coming from.  The increase from 2G to 3G around 2008-2009 was a significant turning point that very quietly happened to the unsuspecting public.  At the same time, AT&T rolled out their powerful wireless routers that constantly emit 24/7.  Many of these are placed directly in people's bedrooms!  Wireless routers, smart phones, & DECT cordless phones are the biggest offenders for constant exposure.  It has been easy for me to correlate patients health problems exactly with when they got that router or smartphone!  It never fails.  The most common symptoms are: hormone trouble & weight gain (especially for women because their hormone systems are 10 times more complex than men), fatigue, insomnia or poor quality sleep, headaches, ADHD or inability to focus attention or keep things straight, memory loss, vision loss, ringing in ears, & etc, etc, etc, but basically just feeling like garbage!  Can anyone relate?  Experiment for yourself.  Try going camping or isolating yourself completely from RF for a day or two & see how you feel. Everyone I talk to says it is shocking how different they feel!  I have heard many reports of ADHD & Autistic children returning to normal or greatly improved when they are removed from RF and all EMF's!  Standard blood panels will not show RF or EMF's as being the cause for hormone trouble & fatigue, so it is virtually undetectable....the perfect weapon!  And that is exactly what it is, a weapon.  Do the research & see how RF is used as a weapon.  It is openly used by the Army to ""confuse & disorient the enemy"".  Novel Military weapons by many countries using RF are no secret.  Search ""Barrie Trower"" on You Tube & watch his video on the Moscow Embassy to see one of the early examples of RF used as a cancer-causing weapon:

Ask the FCC why more towers have been constructed this year 2013 than ever before in the U.S.?  Ask the FCC why this year more so than ever, Federal dollars are funding the mass deployment of wireless devices & technology in our Nations' schools?  Ask the FCC why our Government is doing all this at a manic pace this year, at the same time that they are ""re-investigating the safety of RF"" with these dockets?  Why is all this happening BEFORE the safety ""investigation"" is complete?  Why has the FCC not kept up with the ""drastic increase in radiation exposure"" of 1G-4G with ever-increasing 24/7 human exposure in all aspects of our lives with WIRELESS EVERYTHING from ""smart pajamas"" to ""smart teeth"" being rammed down our throats, & not done any ""investigating"" on the safety of RF since 1996?

The FDA would rather follow suite with the FCC & keep our doctors ignorant as to the real causes of our current epidemics.  I know there are many doctors who figured out the Truth on their own, with no help from the FDA.  They know the lid is ready to blow off this health care catastrophe at any minute.  Watch & share ""Take Back Your Power"" with everyone you know.  It has life-changing, if not life-saving potential!!!

5990543,1,B00FFI77IU,"This is a classic example of someone editing a bunch of anecdotal stories and out of context numbers together without a conceptual understanding of a smart meter, of RF signal propagation, or biology.

To explain how uneducated and downright stupid the creators of this film are, they don't understand that 4 milli second pulses, several thousand times a day, only equal 45 seconds of actual transmission time. They claim to have caught the power company in a lie, but in reality are too incompetent to add. To assume that these meters spew radio waves into the air at all times shows a complete lack of understanding of radio communications. They physically cannot spew energy, as it would interfere with other meters transmitting information.

Further, the information that RF energy causes illness is a subject of considerable debate, and to date the FDA has ruled that RF energy at low levels does not cause cancer. To emphasize how dishonest these people are, they make no effort to illustrate the difference between radiation and RF radiation. ""Radiation"" that causes cancer comes from radioactive particles, and is in the form of alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays. RF radiation that the meter emits imparts less energy onto your body than does a light bulb. Yes, visible light IS RF RADIATION!!

They argue that there are no ""green"" benefits to smart meters, yet they do not understand enough about energy generation to realize that generators must run in ""dissipative mode"" on standby to compensate for sudden increases in power demand, which wastes energy.

This film is dishonest, inaccurate, and overall misleading. The creators have no understanding of basic physics, have no exposure to power generation engineering, and are absolutely despicable.

8615256,5,B00FFI77IU,"This is a documentary that everyone in this country should see.  The roll out of these so called ""smart"" utility meters goes against the Constitution of the U.S.  These meters, once appliances are updated with computer chips, invade our privacy by letting the utility know exactly when you turn on or off an appliance and exactly what appliance it is.  Many people have also reported that their utility bills doubled.  The electric utilities will be able to remotely turn off an appliance in your home if running during ""peak"" load hours.  They will be charging more if you are running appliances during these peak hours.  This is an invasion of the right to privacy in our homes.  Furthermore, there are health issues created by these new digital meters.  They produce what is known as dirty electricity and generate highly spiked electromagnetic fields that surround you 24/7.  I have personally witnessed the dramatic decline of a friend's health after on of these meters was placed on her home.  She has letters from 4 doctors stating that the digital meter was the direct cause of her failing health.  after removing the digital meter and replacing it with the old standard analog meter, her health improved so much that it stunned her doctors.  They could hardly believe that this was the same patient.  I urge everyone to either attend a viewing or purchase this documentary.  This is NOT a conspiracy theory.  I have personally opted out of having one of these meters by paying what I call an extortion fee of $69 to keep one of these off my home.  They also charge a fee of almost $10 per month to send a person out to read the meter.  The digital meters transmit to the utility your usage, eliminating the need for meter readers.  Here in Michigan there is a Bill in the Michigan House that would allow a customer to have a choice of the type of meter they want on their house WITHOUT the extortion fees.  The Representative who heads the Energy Committee, does not want this Bill to pass.  His term expires this year and it is rumored that he will go to work as a lobbyist for the electric utility.  The utility itself says that they will make more money on the data they will sell to 3rd parties than they make for the power they sell you.  As you can see, I can't stress enough the importance of educating yourself regarding these digital meters.
