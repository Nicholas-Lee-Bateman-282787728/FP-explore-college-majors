450455,5,6302313899,"Strictly Business is NOT a throwaway movie as some reviewers would have you believe. I found this movie very entertaining in spite of the weak plot. The ideas are good ones but the concept and execution are lacking.
The main reason to buy this movie is Samuel L. Jackson. He's in this movie credited as ""SAM JACKSON"", and in the few moments he's onscreen as a mailroom boss he gives such an amazing performance that it makes all the other actors look like amateurs. He shows us that a great performer can overcome the weakest material by making a strong effort. While this movie will be remembered as one of Halle Berry's earlier movies (it's one of her better ones) Samuel L. Jackson's performance is worth the purchase of this DVD alone.

The weak plot revolves around a streetwise guy (Tommy Davidson) helping a straight-laced Wayman Tinsdale (Joseph C. Phillips) get with Club promoter Natalie (Halle Berry) in exchange for a spot in a training program. Its too bad Natalie wasn't a better-developed character. I wonder if she would have picked Wayman had the writers given her a personality and a story. The story assumes she'll go out with him because he wears flashy clothes, big money and a nice car. Shallow, Shallow, Shallow.

My biggest beef with this movie are that the female characters and aren't fully developed; they have stereotype personalities. They seem to be there just for Wayman and Davidson's character to drool over or argue with. I wish some African-American filmmaker would show some courage and depict strong female leads next to their male leads. All those flaws aside I still love this concept and think it could work if done properly.

Watching this movie inspired me to write my own story based on the African-American workplace. I fleshed some things out so it has fully developed, well-defined characters (especially the women), and a plot revolving around the actual workplace, not social situations. I hope to get the manuscript published one day...",1094688000,,1985,4.901785714285714
450456,4,6302313899,"I watched this movie and was totally into it from the start!  I love the characters so much and how well they interact together... I even had to stare when Halle Berry was dancing at the club... and I was in total awe and had to say Go... Natalie...Go Natalie...which is the name of her character in this movie... My favorite part had to been when Waymon has to get her back...and his homeboy says..""Hope he brought his knee pads!"" So how romantic was that...I love this cause Natalie has a dream to be a club owner....and that is something that I have been wanting to do for a long time now :)",1010620800,8,594,4.256637168141593

450495,5,6302313899,One of the many great movies that came out in the 90's. As a mother of a young man I would much rather show him this than one of the movies of the 20th century. Although now as an adult I see some faws with the movies unlined message that maybe the average person would not peep its just a better image of the male figure. ,1484784000,,323,3.893939393939394

450527,4,6302313899,"Strictly Business is a swell joint from back in the day. I dug it for several reasons: for that echo of How To Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, and for that reverse twist on Pygmalion, and for a stunning Halle Berry early in her film career. In brief, the plot concerns a mailroom clerk (Tommy Davidson) who scales the corporate ladder by coaching an unhip workaholic in wooing a fine-ass restaurant hostess/club promoter (Berry).

More details. Work-obsessed Waymon Tinsdale III (Joseph C. Phillips) is the golden boy in the prestigious New York real estate firm of Drake, Gearson & Burke. Styling them Brooks Brothers, at ease at power lunches, in firm command of multi-million-dollar presentations, Waymon is this close to landing that partnership, if only he can close the very lucrative Savoy Tower deal. He's got it going on, or so he thinks. Never mind that his work friends make racist jokes behind his back. Never mind that his uptight, toothpick-shaped girlfriend Diedre (Anne-Marie Johnson) treats their relationship like a corporate merger and that, when they have sex, she orders him around like a drill sergeant, and, afterwards, she hands him a wipee. ""For the thing,"" she says. Ugh.

And then one day Waymon's orderly world is upended as he catches sight of Natalie (Berry) in a restaurant. And, just like that, the very lucrative Savoy Tower deal gets put on the back burner. And there's Bobby Johnson's foot in the door.

Bobby is a street-savvy night owl and a serial party animal. He's also a mail room clerk who's always tardy and so gets shade from his mean boss (Samuel Jackson). Yeah, it makes sense that Bobby hasn't made headway in getting into that training program to advance himself. A co-worker sneers at him: ""You ain't nothin' but a late-in-the-house dreamer.""

Ah, but if Bobby can pull a Professor Higgins on Waymon and help him snag the girl, then Waymon promises to hook him up with that training program.

It's not easy as pie. As Bobby remarks to Waymon, ""You know what, G? You are straight-up whiter than the whitest white man!"" For Waymon is a yuppie of the first order, more square than four 90 degrees put together. For goodness' sake, his drink of preference is a club soda with lime. When he ends up in a Harlem nightclub, he goes for a casually cool greeting: ""Hey, home dudes, what is going on?"" C'mon, Waymon, at least use contractions.

For those seeking further dramatic conflict, there's a sub-plot about an envious colleague of Waymon's who dives into dirty shenanigans. But don't worry. This is a feel-good story.

Funny, checking out the ""trendy"" wardrobe circa 1991 and how I used to strut around in those. Today, those threads probably won't be caught dead on anyone other than maybe Russell Westbrook. But, back then, boy were you a fly clotheshorse. Strictly Business, whenever it comes on the telly, compels me to stop and watch. It's a cool flick. It presents a neat love story that skirts the confines of life styles and income levels and stereotypical thinking. It rolls out a terrific positive message that, if only given a chance, anyone of us possesses drive and talent to succeed in life. This movie hearkens back to my younger days when I thought I was hip. Davidson, Phillips, and Berry are all very watchable and likeable and provide some genuine laughs, although the guffaws probably come strongest when Anne-Marie Johnson is on screen. The soundtrack is catchy as hell and rife with musical artists that were happenin' in the 1990s. Remember Father MC and Guy and Jodeci and Troop and Levert? Old schoolers Big Daddy Kane and Heavy D also represent. And LL Cool J does the title track. But LL isn't the reason to watch this sucker.",1466208000,,3711,4.807210031347962

Sam Jackson is also in this film acting crazy as only he can. Tommy Davidson is great in one of the few lead roles in his career. The film is funny and romantic. It also addresses racism and the negative stereotypes laid on African American men. I highly recommend this film for fans of clean, funny, romantic comedies. The soundtrack is also very good.",1390262400,,494,4.43956043956044

450898,4,6302313899,"It's interesting that back in 1991 the selling point of ""Strictly Business"" was Tommy Davidson who was a featured player on ""In Living Color"" and Joseph C. Phillips who was a later cast member on ""The Cosby Show"".  Naturally today the focus would be on Halle Berry, one of the most glamorous women to ever grace the silver screen, and Samuel L. Jackson, one of film's greatest actors.  On the surface the film is a reworking of the old uptown versus downtown theme.  What gives the film luster is that it is an interesting microcosm of the State of African-American Union of it's time. It's not dated just a specific commentary on what was going on in 1991.  The cast is uniformly engaging.  Berry in probably one of her earliest films is more than just a pretty face as the urban flygirl who catches the eye of a corporate climber (Phillips).  Jackson is effective in the brief time he's on screen as the hard-nosed stockroom supervisor.  I debated whether to give this four or five stars but felt it was just a tad conventional to merit the full five star treatment.",1346457600,,1068,4.560209424083769
450899,4,6302313899,"Very good movie. Funny and entertaining without a lot of cursing and violence. Can be a little corny but still a classic.

She is still a very attractive woman. There are many good reasons to buy this DVD, it is a good comedy by director Kevin Hooks. There is also a good message in this movie. This movie came out in 1991, it never grows old or dated.",1317513600,2,378,3.9220779220779223

Just makes you realize that it isn't a person's career as much as his/her outlook on life and positivity that makes a relationship flourish. Tommy Davidson is hilarious. Buy it! This one is definitely worthy of being on the shelf with your collection. I'm not a real big fan of Halle Berry, but I do love her innocence and honest-hearted endeavors whenever she portrays her characters. I saw this one way back in 1991 when it first came to the theatres (back then I don't think there was a such thing as a DVD) But I'm glad I waited until they started making DVDs to buy it. I'd never owned the VHS version.",1271894400,6,657,4.43801652892562
450926,5,6302313899,"A good lighthearted movie about business situations, actions and eventual outcome. The resultant side businesses and cooperative efforts prevail to a successful end. Tommy Davidson and Joseph C. Phillips are very funny in this movie.",1262217600,2,233,5.685714285714286
450927,5,6302313899,"I don't care what anybody says. Not many movies can capture the essence of the 90s like Strictly Business. See back then it was about having fun so the comedies we watched were just fun. Plus this one was pretty funny and had a slight sense of awareness(some comedies had that even Boomerang). Nowadays what passes for comedy is sheer garbage just like these overrated movies that Hollywood oversells to death. At any rate..

The story: Waymon Tisdale(Joseph C. Phillips) is a bank investor that is not too happy about his love life with his swishy and domineering girlfriend Diedre(Anne-Marie Johnson). He meets a beautiful girl named Natalie(Halle Berry) and ends up falling for her. He calls upon the help of a mailroom clerk named Bobby(Tommy Davidson)to aid him in getting her.

Tommy Davidson is funny  as hell in this movie. So is Joseph C. Phillips. He is pretty good as the square but likable Waymon Tisdale. Halle Berry was just gorgeous here as Natalie and to tell you the truth I like her 90s movies better than the junk she's in now. There are too many funny situations to name them all and Strictly Business perfectly captures everything about the 90s urban culture whether its the music or the fashion.

Pay no attention to pompous and sheep-minded critics that cant even write real reviews and don't even have the decency to open up an account(still hiding behind the customer review option huh? Lazy punks). If you want a 90s comedy that's fun to watch then look no further. If you want something overrated beyond belief then follow these easily manipulated puppets but prepare to be disappointed if you do.",1243123200,7,1624,4.789285714285715

450930,3,6302313899,If you are looking for a few laughs and a romantic story then Strictly Business is the movie for you.  The movie was not only funny but it touched on a few life lessons.,1235952000,,169,3.9705882352941178
450931,4,6302313899,"A romantic comedy that doesn't give enough credit to the co-stars Tommy Davidson (In Living Color), Anne Marie Johnson, & Samuel L. Jackson. Joseph C. Phillips and Halle Berry deliver the theme of the story well - Phillips playing the role of a ""square"" investment banker who is smitten by a beautiful nightclub entrepreneur(Berry).  Phillips feels Berry is out of his league and feels he's not hip enough to attract her, so he seeks the advice of his friend (Davidson) who works in the mailroom, on how to dress-to-impress, and to ultimately be introduced to her.  Phillips has another problem though - he already has a girlfriend (Johnson) who is a domineering, vain, controlling, self serving, arrogant yuppie who plans to marry him for appearances and for all the other wrong reasons.  Samuel L. Jackson delivers humor in a short-lived way as the hard-nose mailroom superintendant.  To add more substance to the romantic comedy, the story shows how you can loose yourself, your identity, and ultimately your friends & your woman by trying to live a double life, climbing the corporate ladder, all the while safeguarding against corporate backstabbing and sabotage.  A fun, funny and entertaining movie.",1188777600,22,1206,5.101522842639594
