Women should watch this video as a reminder of how we should be treated ",1464134400,,145,3.8333333333333335
8014528,5,B0001M72O4,"I originally got this as a gag gift for a secret santa, for this uptight girl from India. Who is Super Lonely, thankfully this tape came to her aide, because she is the kind of person who owns a VHS player. This tape was not only fun to give, but prevented her from buying 30 different kinds of cats to fill the void in her empty heart. Now she will never have to spend another night alone, because she will always have her incredible instant Adoring boyfriend.  A new problem arose which is getting her to walk away from the TV she seems glued to every second of watching the adoring boyfriend. Maybe i will have to buy her a cat anyways.",1387411200,,639,4.237704918032787
8014529,1,B0001M72O4,"This is the creepiest video. I'm reminded of the Steve Martin movie, The Lonely Guy, where he has a party in which he and and another lonely guy are the only people who show up. Martin leads his friend around the living room where they admire life-size  cardboard cutouts of celebrities.

Friend: Where'd you get these?
Martin: The Lonely Guy Store. I thought they'd liven the place up.

By the 15 minute mark I felt like I was being talked to by a robot. Then when he brings ""you"" a glass of wine on his way to take out the trash, I sprained something doing an eye-roll.

I pity the lady who thinks this video will somehow fill a void. It's Stepford Boyfriends. Better to get a dog or cat, or better yet, get a Tony Robbins self-improvement video and take actual steps to gain control of your life so you won't have to sit at home and watch a guy who never speaks your name pretend like he's so *in* to you.",1382140800,,908,4.23121387283237
8014530,5,B0001M72O4,"The review has even got to be a joke - OMG this is sickening and completely funny but oh snap it can't be real! It is hysterical but pretty disturbing, do not buy unless you are getting it as a gag gift. The stalker-boyfriend is so way over the top I have been screaming OH GOD! in amused disgust for the last twenty minutes.",1382054400,4,325,4.09375
8014531,4,B0001M72O4,"I got this out of curiousity and because it looked fun.

People might think it's lame, but it's not. Just fun for the single girl.
With all the good vibes and compliments he had, my ""boyfriend"" actually put me in a good mood! Sure, he's just on a dvd and  there isn't anything interactive about him, but that's sort of the point. You just sit back, relax and enjoy him complimenting you.

I work hard like most people, so it felt nice to be doted on, even if it was only pretend. Something about someone paying so much attention to you and thinking your special really is nice, so I guess now I know a little bit about what it feels like to have a boyfriend.

As to the content, I won't spoil everything, but I will tell you that he treats you like a princess and ""takes"" you on vacations. (He just talks about taking you there.) He actually asks how your day was, too, and does chores. The ending is nice as well.

While the DVD is pretty good, I do have a few complaints.

It could have come with a rating. I was expecting something G or PG-rated,
but it caught me off gaurd when he suggested getting in the shower with him and scrubbing my back and later started talking about, um,
""relations"", to put it delicately. (Nothing graphic, mind you, just about his friends rating thier girlfriends and saying that ""out of ten you'd be an eleven."") Seeing him in a towel I could've also done without, particularly when he started showing a lot of leg. (Don't worry, he keeps it on and changes off screen.) It's not that I don't like seeing guys in towels, but when that much leg is shown (his thigh, to be exact) I get  uncomfortable. I know it's nothing terrible compared to what you might see in a TV show, but some of the things I mentioned did manage to make me blush. Anyway, while it looks cute and innocent from the cover, I don't think  it's suitable for a minor.

The editing or something wasn't that great. While I watched it I'm pretty
sure I heared the camera man or someone cough off-screen.
Also, I think it's kind of sad how you can tell it was shot in a very
small studio, but I guess they didn't have a very big budget.

Maybe it's me, but the producers of this video could've found a more attractive man to portray the ideal boyfriend. The dude they picked is
cute, but not gorgeous. A male model with some acting skills would've been better. There are quite a few moments in the dvd where all you do is
stare at him for at least two minutes. I'd feel much happier  doing that if he looked more like Tom Welling or Wentworth Miller. Too bad it didn't come with a selection of men to choose from. That would've been nice.

All in all, it's a fun dvd if you want to waste time or feel like being praised and doted on after a hard day's work, but really is no substitute for a real boyfriend.",1226016000,7,2804,4.24015009380863
