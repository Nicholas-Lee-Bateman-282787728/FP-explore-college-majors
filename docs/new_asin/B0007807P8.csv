8045596,5,B0007807P8,I love this portrayal of Jesus life and ministry. I think it is very reverent and respectful towards the Lord. Remember this is a 1951 movie so the picture and audio may not be as good as one more modern and up to date. But I think most christians would be very pleased with this movie.,1294099200,2,286,4.125
