8311400,4,B001IV61AS,"I thought I knew Vogler's adaption of Campbell's Hero's Journey inside and out. Well there is more and I'm so glad I have this DVD and the work book. Technically, the DVD is for microbudget Digital Film Making. But it's about story. It doesn't matter how well you have the software you use to write a story. A person has to know how to tell story. I have the whole twenty hour DVD class and the work book. It took me a while. But it is by far the best investment I ever made. And to the ""gentleman"" who left a message regarding my affiliation with the authors--I am a consumer--a fanatic fan of the whole series and the workbook. I hope one day they allow certifications or teachers of this ""ultimate"" story program. U",1412899200,,718,4.325925925925926

Character arcs techniques are given to show the theme of the main film. Sheridan presents 20 different ways to show how a character's CHANGES are explained. The DVD explains how to make the transitions realistic and timely.

At this stage in taking all the DVD's in the set, I really understood how mythic structure permeates everything from plot, to character, to symbol, to visual. Very very helpful in creating my story with a ""flesh and blood"" hero.

Another video from this wonderful series that gets anyone ready to write a a blockbuster screenplay or novel fast. She teaches you to combine drama character arcs and classic hero journeys to create Shrek type stories with the best of both worlds. Lots of information on how to use and develop character arcs and how to SHOW them changing in stories. Small character changes visually. Lots of SHOW DON'T TELL tips for creating characters that change visually as they move through the plot. Hero journeys are covered in depth too with lots of ideas on how to use digital FX to make them original.

It took me a few months to get through all 19 of these videos but now I have a great script! Lots of info on things I never learned in any writing or film class. Special focus on digital film making and animation too. There are samples of this class on YouTube which is how I found out about it. It has changed the way I write and made it much easier to plan out ideas. Great for students or people new to digital film or animation!",1244332800,2,1134,4.374407582938389
