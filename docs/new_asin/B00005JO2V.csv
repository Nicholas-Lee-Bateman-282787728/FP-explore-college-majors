They come out with some of the stupidest shows on DVD, yet have not released this popular sitcom. Why??? Trust me, I know there will lines around the block once they finaly release this show!

1533190,5,B00005JO2V,"This was the best TV show ever.  I watched this show when I was growing up.  It was hilarious and oh so cleverly written script.  It was some good wholesome humor for the whole family.  It gave good ideas of what to say to girls, and I loved a decent moral of the story to each episode.  I've been scouring the web for the Family Matters Complete collection of all episodes and come off empty handed.  I'm getting this collection right when it comes out.  I know lots of folks who want to but aren't tech savvy enough to write a comment here at amazon.  I hope I can represent them by saying that we love Family Matters and want it on DVD soon.",1119830400,5,644,4.137096774193548
1533191,5,B00005JO2V,"This is one of the greatest sitcoms ever to grace TV.  Urkel was so annoying but you loved him anyways, and my other 2 favorite characters were eddies friends Waldo and Weasel, they were hillarious.  2 of my favorite episodes were the ones where Carl and Urkel wrestle the Bushwackers (who played ex-cons in the episode and when Urkel tells them that he's a cop they try to really rough them up) and another great episode was when they went on American Gladiators, and the one where Carl kills Urkels rare beatle and they go on the People's Court.  So many great memories of this show, it would be a mandatory part of the collection, hurry up and start releasing these already!!!",1119225600,6,679,4.549180327868853
1533192,5,B00005JO2V,"I really loved seeing all the Family Matter shows that Michelle Thomas who played Myra on Family Matters and Justine on the Cosby Show.  I really thought that Eddie and Gretta made a cute couple.  I am glad that Steve's cousin Myrtle and Eddie never became a couple because Myrtle was really a guy played by Jaleel White.  I really thought that Steve and Laura made a cute couple when Laura became attracted to Steve in the last season.  I also thought that Laura and Stephon made a cute couple.  I was never really crazy about Laura dating Curtis, but I thought that Maxine and Waldo made a cute couple.  I wish that Waldo and Maxine had never broke up and that Waldo played by Shawn Harrison had never left the show.  I have many favorite episodes of Family Matters and I hope that Michelle Thomas who played Myra rests in peace because she died in 1998 of ovarian cancer.  It was so sad because she was only 29.  Michelle Thomas was Malcom Jamal Warner's girlfriend in real life and she played Theo's girlfriend Justine on the Cosby Show.  In real life after Michelle's death Malcolm Jamal Warner married Karen Brown who played Charmaine on the Cosby Show.  Charmaine was Pam's friend.  Pam was Cliff and Claire's cousin on the Cosby Show.  If Family Matters comes to DVD I will buy every season.  I watch Family Matters on Monday-Friday at 1/12 central on ABC Family. Some of my favorite episodes of Family Matters include the episode when Urkel might win 1 million dollars at a basketball game, the pilot episode when Mother Winslow moves in, the episode when Rachel opens her own restaurant Rachel's Place, the episode when Steve and Laura get married for a class project, the episode where Steve's punch is spiked at Maxine's party, the episode where Laura and Maxine get into a fight because Maxine started dating Curtis after Laura broke up with Curtis, the episode where they make tarts, the episode where Laura's guardian angel shows Laura what its like to be Steve, and the episode where Carl has a marriage nightmare and dreams that Steve and Laura got married.",1117497600,8,2074,4.646575342465753

1533194,5,B00005JO2V,"I watched this show for 9 years and it was much better than it's predecessor ""Perfect Strangers"". ""Family Matters"" was the spinoff from Perfect Strangers Marie Jo Peyton played the security guard Harriet Winslow on tha show. So producers decided to spin her off unto her own show. I loved her show better! I stopped watching ""PS"" and started watching ""FM"" for it's entire 9 year run. It was sad when they replaced ""Harriette"" in the last season because Marie Jo was upset that her show became the Steve/Laura/Carl show. Eddie grown into being a really hot looking man! Damn those biceps he has!  So when are they coming out with the DVDS?",1113091200,17,638,4.646017699115045

I love Myra and Laura. They are my sweethearts. God bless Myra a.k.a(Michelle Thomas) who passed away from stomach cancer several years ago. I heard rumors on the internet that Carl was gay. I don't believe its true cause its just a rumor. People just make up stuff, but if it is true thats his business. All I care is he is a great actor. I loved every star on that show. Evary family needs to have this collection no matter what race you are. Thumbs up to all the supporters including me. I hope everyone gets this show on DVD cause I know I will!

1533197,5,B00005JO2V,"I watched this show when it first came out and when it was still airing. It was an amazing show. The cast was great, the plots wonderful. Each episode always had something that everyone could relate to or empathize with, and that was part of the reason it was so great. The other reason was the family interaction - it was great to have a good, wholesome family show because that's what kids & parents alike wanted and needed when this show was on.

From the characters Steve Urkel and Laura Winslow, the non-existant romance was entertaining and amusing. The daily problems Carl Winslow faced as a police officer were great. I still remember one episode, though I'm not sure it was in the first season, where Carl was having serious guilt issues because of an incident where a guy got killed and Carl blamed himself.

Then, the school drama of the kids was great. From middle school to high school, the problems were real. Graffiti, bullies, grades, friends, it had it all. One episode even touched on bullies using/displaying deadly force, which promoted a drive by the Winslow family to do a ""marathon"" type event where people could turn in their weapons, no questions asked, to get their lives back.

After watching all the seasons, I honestly have nothing bad to say about the show.",1112054400,5,1287,4.685840707964601

1533561,4,B00005JO2V,"Important: if you're buying this just for Urkel, bear in mind he doesn't appear until episode 12. The writers originally meant for him to be a one-time character for that episode, but he turned out to be so popular that he became the focal point of the show.

Not that the lack of Urkel in the first several episodes is a bad thing. In fact, it's kind of refreshing. Before Urkel's constant one-liners (""did I do that?"") and physical comedy (how many times can he break a window or fall onto a coffee table?), the show was really character-driven and actually focused on, well, family matters.

This is one show that jumped the shark hard in the later seasons, but Season 1 is full of nostalgia and warm humor. Cheesy? Yes. Worth watching? Yes.

One note: the DVD packaging itself is kind of shoddy. Not sure if mine just happened to slip past quality control, but the plastic is really brittle, and the little spindle where you're supposed to snap the disc back into place pretty much broke off, so the disc now rattles freely inside the case. Not a huge issue, though. Worst case scenario, put the disc in a paper sleeve or in one of those giant, zippered CD albums everyone had in the nineties.",1470614400,3,1197,4.506912442396313

1533695,5,B00005JO2V,"I belong to a generation who because of when we grew up got to watch Family Matters when it originally aired on ABCs TGIF lineup (later CBS) and in syndication on TBS among other networks. To me, Family Matters will always harken back to a time when my biggest responsibility was being a kid. Part of me wonders how I can possibly be objective under such a strong nostalgic pull but here it goes

Watching Season One of Family Matters is like stepping into an entirely different show. Yes, most of the characters are the same and the premise is intact, but there is noticeably less Urkel and the storylines revolved around family things like adjusting to change or jealousy and the perils of growing up and wanting to stake out some independence. This was probably the most family centric season of the entire run. However, I could definitely see where the Urkel character was needed because without him it wouldve been a kind of dry: Family has problems-Family solves problems formula that couldve gotten old or stale quickly.

Its really weird to watch looking back, but its still awesome viewing for those who don't remember Family Matters where Urkel wasn't the focus.",1459036800,,1172,4.768472906403941

1533697,5,B00005JO2V,"I loved this show as a child.  It was a great family show.  I'm actually sad at times to read that most remembered parts of the show have to do with Urkele clumsiness since there seemed to be so much more to this show than just the slapstick.  The Winslow family felt incredibly real and they were able to make me laugh, cry, and learn.  Learned many things from the Winslow family.  How parents should raise their children and do what is best.  The fire that burns within each character and the interaction between them.

They brought up hard to swallow issues for their children and parents alike.  Dealing the death of love ones, taking responsibilities for actions, way for parents to talk to their children, dealing with family craziness and issues, treating people who are different and societal matters such as racism and gun violence.  Don't get me wrong it is still a show but a show I definitely hope and pray I can get my kids to watch when they are older.",1456963200,,967,4.511494252873563

1534021,5,B00005JO2V,"Great family sitcom! Family Matters debuted in the fall of 1989 and featured the Winslow family, headed by police officer Carl Winslow and his wife Harriettte Winslow, an  elevator operator turned head of security of Ferguson's department store. Together they have three children, a dim witted but meaningful son named Eddie, a smart and sassy daughter named Laura, and a sweet and precocious younger daughter named Judy. The Winslow's also share their home with Carl's loving, but sometimes cantankerous mother Estelle and Harriettte's widowed younger sister, Rachel, who is a writer and has a young son named Richie. They have their funny and serious moments throughout the season, and deal with them accordingly. One of the ""matters"" they deal with often is their nerdy and pesky neighbor, Steve Urkel, who has an unrequited crush on Laura and does anything to get her attention, often to the annoyance of her and the rest of the family.

1534153,4,B00005JO2V,"I started to type a review on this first season of Family Matters on 1/3/2015, and today is 12/1/2016. And it's Christmas time.

They actually just even finished releasing all the nine seasons of Family Matters on the DVD sets this year in 2016, and I just have the first eight seasons that I like, including this first season. Jaleel White is actually 40-years-old this year in 2016, and I think now was a good time for them to have finish releasing all the nine seasons of Family Matters with him on DVD sets, so that there would be something to watch and to remember him by as a youngster, playing (Steve Urkel). But I would just watch the first eight seasons with him that I just like, including this first season.

Family Matters is my all-time favorite show, and this is the first season of the show released on the DVD set. And I do have this first season and seasons 2-8 of Family Matters on the DVD sets. There is also a 9th season of Family Matters, which is the very last season, but I don't like that season for a simple reason, so I wouldn't buy or get the 9th season to watch on the DVD set. And this show Family Matters came out with nine seasons.

Other than that, this first season of Family Matters from 1989 is a pretty good season with good episodes. I remember back when I was a kid, I started to like this show, and it became my favorite. And I also remember when I used to see it come on the TV channel, I would always watch it, especially on Fridays with the TGIF show lineup. And I still to this day love this show Family Matters, because it's one of the best shows I've ever seen, and it brings back good memories of Jaleel White and the Winslow family.

And knowing that today is 12/1/2016 and it's Christmas time, I have this first season and the seasons from 2-8 of Family Matters on the DVD sets all wrapped up together as a Christmas present to myself, and I just know that I'll enjoy watching this show around the holidays, after opening them up on Christmas morning. And I definitely would even watch the Christmas episodes from the 2nd season, and from seasons 4-8. There is a 2006 movie with Jaleel White that I do have on a DVD, and I do have that 2006 movie wrapped up with the first eight seasons of Family Matters that I have, including this first season. And that 2006 movie with Jaleel White is called ""Who Made The Potatoe Salad?"". And I would watch that 2006 movie with Jaleel White, after watching him from the first eight seasons of Family Matters that I just like and have on the DVD sets, including this first season. That 2006 movie is also something good to watch with Jaleel White, and it shows him all grown up and wiser. And instead of me watching the 9th season of Family Matters that I don't like, I would even watch that 2006 movie with Jaleel White, and I do have that 2006 movie added with the first eight seasons of Family Matters that I just like, including this first season.

This first season of Family Matters did not have Jaleel White as one of the main characters. But it did show him in a few episodes from this first season, being played as (Steve Urkel), which was a character that was played by him throughout all the nine seasons of the show, including this first season. And the 2nd season was when Jaleel White then became one of the main characters on the show.

I would say that one of my favorite episodes from this first season of Family Matters is ""Two-Income Family"", an episode where Jo Marie Payton as (Harriette) loses her job as an elevator operator at the Chicago Chronicle, and she gets another job that's better for her. The rest of the episodes from this first season are also pretty good episodes to watch with good memories, and I do like Jaleel White as (Steve Urkel). And not only do I like Jaleel White on the show, but I also like Jo Marie Payton as (Harriette) and all the other main characters, especially Reginald Veljohnson as (Carl), who was married to Jo Marie Payton as (Harriette) on the show.

I find this first season and the seasons from 2-8 of Family Matters are the good seasons. But I don't find the 9th season was as good, and things weren't the same on the show then. And it sure would be a waste of money for me to buy the 9th season of Family Matters on the DVD set. So this first season and seasons 2-8 of Family Matters is what I'll just have and watch on the DVD sets, and the 9th season is the very last season I would do without watching. There's also a way TV shows and episodes can be watched on the internet, and I sure wouldn't even watch any episodes of Family Matters from the 9th season on the internet. And neither on the TV channel, I would watch any episodes of Family Matters from the 9th season. Seasons 1-8 of Family Matters is good enough for me to watch anyway. And now that Family Matters has been released on the DVD sets and that I just have this first season and the seasons from 2-8 to watch, it wouldn't even make sense for me to watch the show on the TV channel anymore, and I used to always watch Family Matters whenever it came on the TV channel. And I've seen all 22 episodes from the 9th season before.

I find Jaleel White is a good actor, and this first season of Family Matters shows when he was a youngster. And I have to say that as a youngster, Jaleel White did play a good role in a few episodes that he was in from this first season, even though he was not a main character. But he was not in every episode from this first season. And now that Jaleel White is all grown up and wiser, this first season of Family Matters even brings back memories of him from when he was a youngster, and from when he first started playing (Steve Urkel).

It's also noticeable that this show Family Matters even came out with seven Christmas episodes from the 2nd season, and from seasons 4-9. But this first season of Family Matters did not come out with a Christmas episode, and neither did the 3rd season. I do like the Christmas episodes of this show Family Matters, and they do bring back good memories of the whole family celebrating Christmas on the show. But the Christmas episode from the 9th season is what I would do without watching, knowing that I don't like the 9th season and wouldn't buy or get it to watch for a simple reason. I've seen the Christmas episode from the 9th season before anyway, and it's really not a big deal if there's no Christmas episode from this first season, because this first season of Family Matters is still a good season to watch with good episodes.

Family Matters is even a show that puts me in a happy zone by watching and enjoying it, but only from seasons 1-8, including this first season. And it's a show that I would never want to forget with good memories. I even like the last episode ""Rock Video"" from this first season, an episode where Darius McCrary as (Eddie) and the Winslow family sings and does a music video together as a family, after entering and winning a contest. And the song they sang in the video and in that episode was a great song.

Knowing that the 8th season of Family Matters is the last season I would watch, there are 24 episodes from that season, and the 24th episode from the 8th season is ""A Pirate's Life For Me"", so that's the last episode of Family Matters I would watch. The first and pilot episode of Family Matters from this first season is ""The Mama Who Came To Dinner"", and that's the first episode of Family Matters I would watch. That episode from this first season is the only one that shows a little girl named Valerie Jones as one of the main characters playing (Judy), and the rest of the episodes throughout this first season and from seasons 2-4 then shows Jamiee Foxworth being played as (Judy). And I do like Jamiee Foxworth as (Judy) alot better than Valerie Jones. I don't find that Valerie Jones from that pilot episode really did fit the character to play (Judy), but Jaimee Foxworth played it well, until she disappeared and was never seen again on the show after the 4th season. Jaimee Foxworth was more like a daughter and a sister and had more character on the show, and I think that it was a good decision for them to have her as (Judy), instead of Valerie Jones. So knowing and remembering Jaimee Foxworth as (Judy) on Family Matters would be better. I still don't mind watching that pilot episode with Valerie Jones though, because it's still a good episode to watch with all the other main characters, and this whole first season of Family Matters is a good season for me to watch.",1420243200,,8522,4.346733668341709

Carls (the dad) facial expressions are epic and so is Harriets (the mom) no nonsense attitude! Eddie (the brother) is asmooth talking player with enough color blocking in his wardrobe to last that whole decade, not to mention the high top hair!

""Family Matters"" was a huge hit back in the day.  I can remember everyone imitating Steve Urkel on AFV.  Kids nowadays haven't a clue what good television is until they sit and watch a show like this.  I highly recommend this DVD set and all the others to anyone who grew up in the late 80's through the early to late 90's.  It's a great show to get your kids into instead of getting your kids into the trash that's on modern tv today.  There will NEVER be as good a sitcom as this.",1384128000,,669,4.21259842519685

  It's astounding to me to think something this wholesome could ever be on network TV. The kids aren't living immoral ""oh isn't fornication cute"" lives. The parents aren't calling their kids idiots or morons. And while their is some sibling rivalry--we, the viewer clearly understand ""Family Matters""!!!

  It could never survive todays network comedy atmosphere of filth.",1382227200,,474,5.324324324324325

1534714,5,B00005JO2V,"""Family Matters"" - the hit sitcom about Chicago cop Carl Winslow (played by Reginald VelJohnson) & his wife Harriette (played by Jo-Marie Payton), is loosely based & spun off of the sitcom ""Perfect Strangers"" - of which Harriette Winslow was a cast member. The Winslows have three children - Eddie (Darius McCrary), Laura (Kellie Shanygne Williams) & Judy (Jaimee Foxworth). Living with the Winslows, is Harriette's sister & Carl's sister-in-law Rachel, who has a son from a previous marriage named Richie (played by twins Joseph & Julius Wright [Season One only]). In ""The Mama Who Came To Dinner"", Mother Estelle Winslow comes to live with the family, despite Carl's objections. ""Two-Income Family"" finds Harriette losing her job to automation, so she seeks a higher position @ the Chicago Chronicle. Carl purchases a vintage police car in ""Body Damage"" - where Rachel decides to take a spin in the jalopy with disastrous results!. Carl dreams of son Eddie making it big in ""Basketball Blues"" - where Carl asks a former pro ball player to talk to Eddie about sticking with basketball. The Winslows catch a glimpse of their favorite TV idol in ""False Arrest"" - where Carl has an unfortunate run-in with Buddy Goodrich (played by guest-star Ron Glass). Eddie is excited when he brings home a perfect report card in ""Straight As"", only to find his friend Rodney (played by Randy Josselyn [Seasons One & Two]) has doctored it up. Rachel writes a detailed story in ""Short Story"", but the rest of the family isn't too thrilled. Carl attempts to build Mother Winslow (Rosetta LeNoire) a shower in the family bathroom in ""Mr. Badwrench"", while Laura accidentally sells Mother Winslow's family heirloom in ""The Quilt"". With this landmark first season of ""Family Matters"", there's lots to choose from, as you'll find there are plenty of funny episodes to satisfy children of all ages from nine to ninety. Make ""Family Matters - The Complete First Season"" a must-have item in your DVD library ASAP!

1534875,5,B00005JO2V,"Back-in-the-day, right after I retired from the military, I used to watch ""THANK GOD IT'S FRIDAY""
every Friday. What a block of great shows in the ""olden days"" when there were, like, FIVE channels
to watch in Saint Louis---if ya didn't spring for cable....No WALKING DEAD, No SUPERNATURAL, No EUR-
EKA, No WAREHOUSE 13... I've noticed all my favorite shows get cancelled, and worse yet, aren't al-
ways available on DVD/BD, either.

Since there ARE people younger than me [65], I'll start out with telling you a little about the cast:
A spin-off off an elevator-operator character on PERFECT STRANGERS, JoMarie Payton-France, now 64,
played Harriette Winslow-- the wife of ""Carl""...

Reginald VelJohnson, now 62, played SGT Carl Winslow--and was the o-n-l-y cast member that appeared in
EVERY-SINGLE-TV-EPISODE!

Rosetta LeNoire, died at 90,[1911-2002] ""Mother"" Winslow.

Darius [Eddie] McCrary and his ""sister"" Kellie Shanygne [Laura] Williams, are 38.

Jaimee Foxworth played ""Judy"" from episode #2, on; age 34. Appeared in 7 porno films, thereafter, rather
than file bankruptcy.

Joseph & Julius Wright, billed without the ""&"" appeared in the first season, as the baby.

Telma Hopkins, now 65, {singer/actress} appeared as Rachel Crawford.

Jaleel White, 38, soon, despite only appearing in one minute of the first DVD's eight (8!) episodes is the biggest
[foreground] character on the DVD-case.
His next appearance is in episode #12, thereafter, his character Steven Quincy Urkel steals the show... and later,
even, actually, writes some of the BETTER episodes.
He, pretty much, does voice-over work, now, and continues to write for the screen. Not being a ""Goober"", a ""Barnie""
or a ""Beaver Cleaver"", his ""Urkel"" character ended with his saying something, to the effect: ""If you EVER see ME
playing Urkel again, put a gun to my head and blow my brains out!""

Some actors, like Reginald VelJohnson [Sergeant Winslow] have been playing THEIR characters for years, and years, and years.
VelJohnson appeared as a POLICE SERGEANT in Die Hard 1&2; a jail guard in GHOSTBUSTERS, etc., etc., etc.... and works to this day...
morgue attendant; cop; guard; whatever...

Trivia noticed by ME:
==> * The first time we see Sergeant Winslow wearing ANY rank, whatsoever, it is in his dress-blues which show him as a [triple-bar] commander.
==> * Episode #14 is the first time we SEE his Sergeant Stripes -- but without ANY badge(?)!
==> * Episode #15 = no stripes, no badge.

1535000,5,B00005JO2V,"Here's the back cover:
""Hi, Everybody!"" Fans of '90s sitcoms know those words mean Steve Urkel has come to call, bringing lots of geeky, goofy fun with him. A spinoff of Perfect Strangers, Family Matters began as the art-home adventures of elevator operator Harriett Winslow and her multigenerational family. But midway through the first season, Jaleel White made a one-short appearance as neighborhood nerd Urkel. With oversized glasses, undersized body, screechy voice and indomitable self-confidence, Urkel proved irresistibly funny, turning White into an overweight sensation and a new star of the show. Join Urkel and the Winslows for the 22-episode debut season of the hit series that proclaims love matters, laughing matters, and Family Matters!

1535112,4,B00005JO2V,"Like most of the rest of the world, I didn't discover Family Matters until the second season, when Urkel had already started his takeover of the series. I was totally unfamiliar with Season One and it's very interesting to see compared to what came later.

For starters... although the show is somewhat generic, usual fare for what one would expect from a Miller-Boyett production of that day and age, there's a lot more heart to it. Thankfully Reginald VelJohnson, Jo-Marie Payton-France (what's with all these long names?), Telma Hopkins, and Rosetta LeNoire carry the show because the acting from the children aside from maybe Eddie is horrendous. I'm sure they got better with time, because I don't remember them being so bad later.

Despite that criticism, I really like it. Get it when it's on sale like I did, and go back to a time when sitcoms were simpler but not fluff.

Sadly, there are no extras... I'd actually be curious if Carl Winslow ever showed up on Perfect Strangers to visit his wife... and the original Season 1 theme song, which was Louis Armstrong's ""What A Wonderful World,"" has been replaced with the traditional Family Matters theme. That's one change that doesn't bother me too much - at least it's not as blatantly obvious as the later Happy Days theme replacing ""Rock Around The Clock"" for the Happy Days Season 2 set.

I'm also sad that, so far, no more Family Matters seasons have been released on DVD. I want to see more!",1299283200,,1454,4.71259842519685

Carl, Laura, Eddie and the rest of the Winslow family are all well written and thought out characters but then every in every episode you have to deal with Steve Urkel who is horribly played by Jaleel White.  Urkel is probably one of the most disgusting and horrible people ever to grace the silver screen.  He constantly is messing up the Winslows residence and all he can say is ""Did I do that?"" in the most annoying voice ever heard.  I watched the series on and off hoping that Urkel would learn not to damage others property but it never happened.  Carl should of shot him between his 4 eyed face and used his Chicago police connections to get rid of the evidence.

After a while Urkel then makes a ""cool"" machine and becomes Stephan Urquel and I really just had to stop watching the show before I hurt myself or someone else.  I really wish I could give negative stars for this abomination of a show.",1294963200,5,954,4.3559322033898304

I just got Season One on DVD, and while I am pleased with the boxset as a whole, there is a TOTAL disregard for special features. No commentaries, no optional foreign language tracks, no original ABC promos, nothing of the sort. I was expecting hours upon hours of special features, but WB failed to deliver. I want these features on the Season Two boxset, provided that there is one. Warner Bros., either put more special features on Season Two, or don't release it at all.

1535372,3,B00005JO2V,"""Family Matters - The First Season"" is a new box set devoted to the popular TV show, which aired originally from 1989 to 1998. It focuses on the Winslows, a multi-generational, middle-class, suburban Chicago family.

The show takes a closer look at the at-home adventures of Harriette Winslow (JoMarie Payton-France), the sarcastic elevator operator who was initially featured on ""Perfect Strangers.""  Also featured in the series are Harriette's husband Carl (Reginald VelJohnson), a Chicago police sergeant, and their three kids: rebellious son Eddie (Darius McCrary), intelligent daughter Laura (Kellie Shanygne Williams), and youngest kid Judy (Jaimee Foxworth/Valerie Jones).  Other regulars include Carl's streetwise mom (Rosetta LeNoire) and Harriette's sister Rachel (Telma Hopkins).

During the first season, the Winslows are introduced to the show's scene-stealing breakout star, geeky next-door neighbor Steve Urkel (Jaleel White).  Urkel, the ultimate nerd, develops a big crush on Laura.  With his oversized glasses, high-waisted pants, suspenders, and high-pitched, squeaky voice, Urkel is a living, breathing sight gag.

The three-disc set contains 22 episodes.",1278892800,,1175,6.0

If you're looking for something that will keep you laughing for hours, this is it.  The first shows were really good, but the show really took off when Steve Urkel moved into the neighborhood.

When I was a very young kid this was the show we watched together every week, even when they started revolving the entire thing around Jaleel White. While Urkel does indeed get out of hand in the later seasons, Season 1 is a good example of what the show was trying to be; a family-oriented sitcom with a wise-acre Grandma, two ""cute kids"" to add humor, the attempted teen heart-throb, the sarcastic mother & the policeman father who attempts to stay out of confrontations with his own family until his wife forces him into it.

Hopefully later seasons come out, this is just a top notch show! I miss the days when classy shows like this came out.",1277337600,3,806,4.409395973154362

Later seasons he would be a regular, but season 1 he just recurring, like Rodney. Steve Urkel wasn't on until the 12th episode except one episode where he was on before opening credit, but no more that episode. He should not have been given star treatment on the Season 1 set.  The first Season mainly revolved around the Winslow family. The first season
artwork should have revolved around the Winslow family. This is
misleading. It leads people to believe he was more than he was. Steve Urkel is all over the artwork on everything. The first disk had his face on it, but he wasn't on those episodes except for the one episode where he was on before opening credits. I think the artwork should have featured the Winslow family only. The disks should have had: Disk one; Carl and Harriet, Disk two: Eddie, Laura, and Judy, Disk three: Momma Winslow, Rachel, and Little Richie. Later seasons Steve was a major player and it would okay then to feature him on the artwork.
In the first Episode while Carl and Harriett are talking about where Mama Winslow could live besides with them Harriett says ""Your mother hasn't liked Frank since he took est.

Even if there was not an Urkell, the show still would have worked on it's own. I'm not saying that I don't like the following seasons, I do. I remember watching the original episodes as a kid during it's first run with Urkell in them. Only in syndication did I see these episodes from the first season, and I enjoyed the first season as much as the following four seasons. After the 5th season, the show fell flat though. I am as annoyed as everyone else about the box cover showing Steve in front and the family in the back. Even for the following seasons, that wouldn't be right. It should have all of them in a picture together. Steve shouldn't be pictured on the box at all because he wasn't a major part of these episodes. The second season should rightfully have the whole family plus Steve together on the cover. But of course, WB wants to sell it.

I am soon to be 21 years old (the same age as the show!) so it was really great to see the episodes uncut, and feature new scenes that aren't played in syndication. My only complaint about the DVD set is that Valerie Jones (the actress who played Judy in the pilot) is featured on the DVD artwork instead of Jaimee Foxworth.

The only thing im worried about is that if it took this long for season 1 to be released in June 2010 then how long will it take for all 9 seasons to be released? Please please release all 9 seasons of Family Matters on dvd! I've seen every single episode from beggining to end of this sitcom and can't wait to own it on dvd. I have WAY too many favorites to list but 1 of the best of the best that I must see and have is the episode with Steve's evil puppets Steevil and Carlsbad. They were scary and so fun to watch.

1535634,5,B00005JO2V,"Finally!!! How many days have gone by while fans eagerly waited for the release of this classic family sitcom on DVD?! Now fans who have waited patiently, like myself and my friends, will be able to own the complete first season of the Winslow's and their quirky neighbor Steve Urkle in Family Matters. The 3-disc set will contain the following 22 episodes originally airing from 1989-1990:

The Mama Who Came To Dinner
Two-Income Family
Short Story
Rachel's First Date
Straight A's
Baseball Blues
Body Damage
Mr. Badwrench
Stake-Out
False Arrest
The Quilt
Laura's First Date (Steve Urkle's Proper Introduction!!!)
Man's Best Friend
Baker's Dozen
The Big Reunion
The Party
The Big Fix
Sitting Pretty
In A Jam
The Candidate
Bowl Me Over
Rock Video

No news yet on any special features and some are wary of expecting any but just being able to own these episodes on a proper set should be more than enough to please fans. Though, any exec's out there with a say in the matter should be aware of how much us fans who have waited so long would appreciate a little something extra, a blooper reel would be great, even some sort of featurette or promotional material if not a commentary or two, just throwing that out there.

Anybody growing up or alive in the 90's knows the name Steve Urkle. Urkle became a household name and now fans can revisit, and newcomer's can finally be introduced to, the man who did do that. Though Steve Urkle easily became a star the show wasn't only great because of him, (in fact Urkle wasn't written in until the 12th episode but became so popular they made him a regular and fit him into some earlier episodes not yet aired), but it was also great because of Carl, Harriette, Laura, Eddie and the entire Winslow family and how audiences related to them and the issues they dealt with, which is an even rarer thing this day and age. I still remember the way Carl would drag out ""Harr-i-ette"" or how Steve would be told ""go home Steve"" only to then respond ""I don't have to take this, I'm going home."" This show is classic American sticom at it's finest and they just can't make them like this anymore. I don't know if it's because the world has changed or if they just don't know how to capture the innocence, comedy and family values the way sitcoms once used to. This show in particular had great stories that at their core taught us family does matter and it still does just as much if not more so today.

2010 is a great year for the 'Most Wanted TV Series on DVD' crowd, shows like Daria and Family Matters that fans have waited for patiently for so many years are finally getting released. It looks like all the online petitions and fans showing desire to purchase these great series has finally paid off. I have to give this show 5 stars and don't see any reason that this set won't deserve five stars, especially for fans who have waited so long for this ""most wanted on DVD"" series. Everybody get out there and buy this, it's the bigger love of the family!

Such a release never did materialize, and fans have always wondered why the show was missing on DVD. In a September 2008 live online chat with Warner studio execs, hosted by our friends at the Home Theater Forum, the program was brought up in a question. The reply from the studio was: ""Family Matters is a title that has always been on our list, but related costs have prevented it thus far and we're working to get around those issues, if possible. MORE TO COME."" At last, we're pleased to tell you that ""more"" is here!

This morning Warner Home Video has formally announced that Family Matters - The Complete 1st Season is coming to DVD at last, on June 8th. The show's rookie year in 1989-90 included 22 episodes starring Reginald VelJohnson, Kellie Shanygne Williams, Darius McCrary, JoMarie Payton, Rosetta LeNoire, Jaimee Foxworth, Telma Hopkins and (starting with the show's 12th episode) Jaleel White as ""Steve Urkel"". Guest stars include Ron Glass (Barney Miller, Firefly) and Tim Russ (Star Trek: Voyager, Samantha Who?). The DVD release will come on 3 discs, for $29.98 SRP.

Further details - including A/V specs, bonus material (if any...it looks doubtful) and package art - have not been revealed as of this writing. But stay tuned and we'll update you just as soon as we can!""

Of these, Family Matters has yet to be released on DVD. I miss the older show that have a rise and fall of plot with a defined (good) resolution. It had a lesson to be learned to make us and future generations wiser. The TV nowadays has no resolution, it's like soap operas all afternoon and evening. I long for the day when this is released on DVD. Thanks and God bless!",1235433600,3,509,4.1

She LOVED Family Matters when she was growing up and still does.  It only comes on TV in our area between 11 pm and 2 am.  And Netflix only has Season 1.  For her I would definitely by this show.

Recently, I found it on tvland, but I would like to have my own DVD set of the show.  I have been wanting to buy the Family Matters DVD set for 2 or 3 years now, but it is still unavailable through amazon.com.  (I have also searched other well-known areas.)

However, when I did a search for the show on the internet, I came up with the following website:
[...]
where ""Family Matters"" is listed for a very inexpensive price ($[...] for all 9 seasons).

There are also lots of other DVD collections found on that website.  I can't help but be curious as to why DVD Media Star can not only get something that is not yet ready for release, but they can get it for such a cheap price.  Does anybody know this company?  Would it be wise to buy from them?",1223510400,,852,4.090361445783133
1536495,5,B00005JO2V,"Sometimes a great show comes about almost by accident.  The wind blows in just the right creator, just the right performers and the kind of writing that extends beyond the domestic audience into something universal that can be enjoyed at many levels by many kinds of people. Family Matters has the kind of classic formula that made The Three Stooges, The Munsters and Seinfeld great in and beyond their time, and features the kind of endearing personalities that transcend the usual American barriers of color.

Though going from top billing to next in line after unexpected bombshell Jaleel White hit the show could not have been easy for the rest of the crew, all the support they gave him for as long as they could endeared each of their characters to the viewers even more.  The show does suffer from some errors in continuity and inconsistencies / exaggerations, many most probably stemming from network pressure to ride the Urkel wave at the expense of all else.  Even so, it has an indescribable attraction and adorable nature that has made viewers like me die hard fans forever.

My Japanese, French and other friends from several countries love it too; we are all eagerly awaiting the long overdue release of the shows on DVD!",1218931200,,1235,4.806603773584905

He just knew that if he couldn't find Richie, he was certainly gone for it. He would have been blamed for the rest of his life. Then there the one when Steve took Carl to court because Carl squashed his bug. That bug was like $483 and some change. I know that Steve is a nerd and all but, who pays almost $500 for a bug?

Steve Urkel I love him to death and he is who makes that show from his youth to his older age. Steve moves me with every inner action he has with the other actors on the show where he has bought me to tears. He is truly a brillant and talented actor.

Jaleel White was born to play this lovable nerd. He seems so boring when he's just normal! Steve Urkel was the crowning moment of Jaleel White's career. T.V. sucked ever since this show was cancelled! I've been searching stores for years, just hoping it would be released on DVD Box Sets. Why on earth hasn't this been released on DVD when even the Fresh Prince has?

 There's a website called dvdcollections.tv that has the complete 9-seasons of Family Matters in one Big Box Set [215 uncut episodes on 24 DVD's] for $69.99.

1536645,5,B00005JO2V,"This is another excellent show which I have heard might come out in '08 and I certainly hope so.  The first season was much more down to earth, with Urkel not debuting till the 4th episode and keeping a relatively minor role for most of the season.  The focus here was on the family, a sort of working class version of the Cosby Show, but with that trademark Miller-Boyett Style.  Looking back at it, it actually holds up quite well, and Reginald VelJohnson is truly a warm and wonderful star who anchors the show and is the clear standout.  Of course, sometimes ratings are low for shows like these and a certain popular character tends to take over, which is exactly what happened after this season.  This is fine, as Urkel is extremely funny and well played by Jaleel White, and he certainly deserved to become the focal point of attention.  However, it is still fun to go back and watch this first season to look at what the show was originally supposed to be.",1189209600,,964,4.48
