God bless people like Jim.

A young incarcerated woman, in prison for deeds as a gang member,  has just read her poem, about her life, and the part that gripped my heart was the last line: ""But never will she bend and say, Forgive me Father, for I have sinned.""

We all make such a mess of our lives, to lesser or greater degrees, depending on whose scale we compare ourselves to. When this lady read that, from a prison meeting, I exclaimed That's IT! None of us can ""fix"" the part of us that needsto FEEL the grace and forgiveness of Jesus Christ. That's a part of us that we can not see, examine, or touch, but it shapes our decisions and reactions, and journey- our life.

I explain it like this: Did you ever clench your fists as hard as you could, and hold that for as long as you could? Remember how that felt? Then, when you unclenched your hands- remember how that felt? Well, we all live and walk around ""clenched"" inside. Only God's forgiveness can give us the ""unclenched"" feeling, in our heart, mind, and body.

The peace of God feels like being filled with a thick, liquid, peaceful, quiet, stillness. Every part of the mind- worry, fear, anxiety, guilt, loneliness, self-hatred, cravings, anger, vengence- whatever- is gone. Every part of the body- stomach, nervous system, heartbeat, racing thoughts- is stilled, quieted, relaxed. Fidgeting and restlessness go away. Stillness. Rest. Peace.

I'll watch the rest, maybe update this review afterwards. So far, though, I give it 5 stars. :)",1492992000,3,1578,4.67870036101083
