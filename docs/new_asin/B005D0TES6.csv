4655335,5,B005D0TES6,"always loved the SUPREMES, MARVELETTES, MARTHA AND THE VANDELLAS. BUT ALWAYS WAS WATCHING MARY WILSON, BEAUTIFUL, SEXY,
CLASSY. THE SONGS WITH diana ross  singing are iconic but in later years it was all about diana ross. then came along
JEAN TERRELL AND MARY WILSON AND CINDY BIRDSONG we begin to hear and see MARY and CINDY back up front. the lineup of
JEAN, MARY, AND CINDY WAS THE BEST. you can watch the ""up the ladder to the roof"" segment on you tube but not the whole
version. i remember this was their debut in red outfits and looking good. JEAN opened up with ""if my friends could
see me now"" then ""up the ladder to the roof"" the next day ""up the ladder to the  roof"" was selling like crazy. just
a beautiful song and what makes it so great is the blending of all three SUPREMES. and to me ""NATHAN JONES"" sung by
JEAN,MARY, and CINDY WAS AND is so ahead of it's time. LOVE THE SONG! the arrangement and the vocals. so when i get
this i will look at  FLORENCE BALLARD, MARY WILSON, CINDY  BIRDSONG, AND JEAN TERRELL,these  were the SUPREMES without
3 in the line up the group  could not exists. now that time has  passed the  diana YEARS were just the same old
sound, a  formula but MARY and FLO were the SUPREMES and their  vocals were always  what made the songs good and fun
to sing along with. and now i have always loved the MARVELETTES and to me they were the  best girl group of the 1960's.
the whole girl group was always about the group the lead  singer was a part of the group no matter the success",1315008000,5,1516,4.2404181184668985
4655336,1,B005D0TES6,"Why isn't ""Someday We'll Be Together"" on this? It was their final performance on the show. It seems they are leaving out alot.....",1314748800,3,130,4.695652173913044
4655337,5,B005D0TES6,"As a Supremes and Motown fan, I could not be more excited about this DVD. I can't wait to re-live their performances of ""Baby Love,"" ""You Can't Hurry Love"" and ""Love Child."" So much to love!

Along with that, I'm excited for the bonus of ""Up The Ladder To The Roof"", which I have never seen before. The Supremes were a class act and I'm very excited to add this DVD to my collection!",1314316800,7,383,4.175675675675675
4655338,4,B005D0TES6,"While I am appreciative that this is finally being released, couldn't they have at least look at the ""Reflections"" DVD that has gone double Platinum, and try not to duplicate the tracks? The hits were great. But it was the special tributes like ""Funny Girl"", ""Leading Lady Medley"", ""Irving Berlin"", etc. that made The Supremes the #1 Female Group in the world still to this day, some half century later. To that end, the inclusion of ""Always"" from the Irving Berlin tribute and ""You're Nobody Until Somebody Loves You"" deserves a standing ovation.

Placing ""Up the Ladder to the Roof"" on Motown Gold would have been wiser, but, including it as a bonus prevented the sequencing from being inconsistent with the continuity of the Ross-led hits that rightfully dominates this collection.

Out of respect for their legend, I am at least glad this is finally coming. On the heels of ""Reflections"" bodes well for more of the vast collection of Ross' DVD offerings.

In a slick marketing ploy, I Pre- ordered all 3 because there is something I want on each. Diana stole the show during the sing off with The temptations, just watch her burn up ""I'm Losing You""....... But that medley ends up on The Temptations and not The Supremes. Makes me wanna holler. So hats off to the EdSullivan.com marketing staff as my wallet gets hit for almost $50.00.

Regardless, I will be waiting for my copies on 13 September 2011!",1314230400,7,1406,4.75
4655339,5,B005D0TES6,This is a steal of a deal for the price.  I have been waiting forever for this DVD to come out.  I remember as a kid watching Diana Ross and The Supremes on The Ed Sullivan Show.  They were (still are!) my favorite group and this DVD looks to include some of their best songs and performances.  Hopefully we will see more old Motown releases in the near future!,1314057600,16,361,4.188405797101449
4655340,3,B005D0TES6,"The production review mistakenly says it has 22 performances when the listing only shows twelve.  For a Ross/Supremes fan, all these performances have been seen before. Just another compilation of videos that most Supremes fan have on one DVD or another.  I am not buying this one until I read the customer reviews.  I want to know if the entire performance of the ""new"" Supremes is included or just Up The Ladder To The Roof which was already released on another DVD.  Except perhaps for ""Always"" I think I've seen all the rest on DVD somewhere in my collection.

What about the Fats Waller segment, the Irving Berlin segment (with an Ethel Merman walk on), the Funny Girl segment and other great performances not seen in DVD?  I get so tired of buying the same thing over and over.  Why not just release ALL of their ED Sullivan performances unedited?  Do we have to wait another 10 years to get the rest?  And what about the Motown 25th Anniversary?  I bet Suzanne DePasse won't release that and definitely will not release it uncut where the now infamous and controversial tug of war between Ross and original Supreme Mary Wilson took place.  That way the public can make up its own mind whether it was deliberate or not since DePasse denies there was any pushing.  If not, then why did she not release it as it happened?

Again, I will wait to hear what other fans that buy this DVD say and maybe then I will buy it.",1314057600,8,1421,4.482490272373541

4655383,5,B005D0TES6,"Sullivan's cameras focused soley on Ross even when Mary, Cindy, and Flo were singing their hearts out.  Was CBS controlled by Motown? This blatant disregard for The Supremes has always annoyed me. Cindy and Mary finally step out front and center when the ""New Supremes"" debut on Ed Sullivan in 1970.  ""Up the Ladder to the Roof"" is superb but the show stopping ""Nothing Can Stop Us Now"" is even better.  I hope the picture and sound on this dvd are better than the gangsta VHS copies floating around.",1335657600,,500,4.595505617977528

4655385,3,B005D0TES6,"Although it is always exciting to see the Supremes on video with a big flat screen t.v. and suround sound; I was disapointed in the production of this one.  Has anyone at Motown ever heard of remastered sound and colorizing black and white videos? The sound wasn't as good as the original performance on my old tv from 1964 and the video could have been improved to make the black and white picture as  sharp as the original show.  When it comes to the Supremes lets start thinking of quality reproduction instead of a quick buck!  Those of us from the 60's want the highest quality possible for our groups.

Also each performance is shown complete without distracting editing or disturbing voice overs. I think this is the first time that ""Up The Ladder To The Roof"" is shown complete and I am very grateful for that.  However it is kind of annoying that the producers of this DVD didn't program the videos by date.  And I can't understand why they keep releasing bits and pieces of The Supremes on Ed Sullivan instead of releasing everything including the non-hit performances. Come on guys! Stop fooling around with this material and give us the COMPLETE SUPREMES ON ED!",1319760000,3,697,4.704918032786885
4655390,3,B005D0TES6,Haven't bought it yet but wanted to know if this is the full unedited versions of these songs. This is a very big let down as they should have included ALL the performances. No one seems to ever get The Supremes just right on dvd. Any help?,1318550400,3,240,4.127659574468085
4655391,4,B005D0TES6,"In late 2006, the ""Reflections"" DVD is released and brings us a dozen or so Supremes performances from various sources. Now, Sofa Entertainment brings us this collection of 13 performances from 1964-1970 taken exclusively from The Ed Sullivan Show. We see these fair Motown City maidens morph from doing a demure shimmy in their little fringe dresses in black-and-white to their final performance as a superstar group in gold sweeping caftans before their leader branches off solo.

The video/audio quality is great on all of these performances though some are a little better than others. If you already own the ""Reflections"" DVD, the only repeats here are ""You Can't Hurry Love"" and ""Love Child"" (the 1968 lip-sync version performed sans wigs and makeup). ""Come See About Me"" is the original black-and-white version (not colorized), as it should be so the purists will be happy.

There are four non-hits/standards including ""More"" and ""Always"". We get to witness the girls' stage patter when they dedicate ""You're Nobody Til Somebody Loves You"" to Ed.

It's easy to see the group was a class act all the way as they glide around the stage in billowing pink chiffon during ""My Favorite Things"" or flash their bling and million dollar smiles during the exuberant ""The Happening"" (where, surprisingly, Mary Wilson occupies center stage). Cindy Birdsong looks positively regal occupying Flo's old place in ""Forever Came Today"". But they were also human, too. Watch for Mary's split-second reaction to Diana's ""Go, Mary"" before the dance solo on ""Love Is Like an Itching In My Heart"". It's as if she's thinking ""Excuse me? Girl, WHAT are you doing""?.

These clips all look better than what we've seen on Youtube, especially the astrological flop ""No Matter What Sign You Are"", featuring the gals in glittery ponchos and bell-bottoms as they prepare to embrace the '70s.

Included as a Bonus Feature is a 1970 performance with Jean Terrell in their first post-Diana appearance performing the underrated ""Up The Ladder to the Roof"". It was clear from the outset that what Jean possessed in pipes, she lacked in stage presence. Still, this era of the group is sadly negelected and I highly recommend you check out some of their early '70s post-Ross work including such gems as ""Automatically Sunshine"", ""Touch"" and ""Your Wonderful Sweet Sweet Love"".

The cover art features a 1966 shot of Diana, Flo and Mary in their Carnaby Street mod fashions and there are 13 color pics inside the case that range from the girls in green taffeta and bouffants circa 1962 to mature-looking women in gold lame circa 1969.

Sofa Entertainment has slyly marketed these sets so that you also need to buy ""Motown Gold"" to get five extra performances that aren't included here: A 1966 greatest-hits medley, the final performance of ""Someday We'll Be Together"", ""My World Is Empty Without You"" (1966) and their early 1969 appearance where they performed both ""Love Child"" (in a superior live performance that rivals the studio version in drama and intensity) and ""I'm Livin' In Shame"" (lip-synced). In purple crushed velvet pantsuits, the girls still look casual enough to reflect the song's socially-concious lyrics, yet not as unglamorous as they did months earlier when they debuted ""Love Child"" dressed-down. The ""Motown Gold"" set also includes ""Come See About Me"", ""Love Is Like an Itching In My Heart, ""You Can't Hurry Love"", ""The Happening"", ""Forever Came Today"" and the first 1968 performance of ""Love Child"", so if you get it you're double-dipping on those.

IMO, if you have to choose, go for the ""Motown Gold"" set and skip this one. You'll only be missing the four standards, the 1969 hits medley, ""No Matter What Sign You Are"" and ""Up The Ladder To The Roof"". The other set is more bang for your buck, but if you're a completist, you'll want both.",1318118400,9,3832,4.967238689547582
4655392,5,B005D0TES6,"This collection is a must for any true Supremes fans out there.

4655415,5,B005D0TES6,"Bought this a few days ago and think it's great entertainment.  It's a perfect companion piece to have this dvd along with the Supremes 'Reflections' dvd of a few years ago. I think anyone buying this will find it a great value and a lot of fun. Just glad to have it, you know?  The sound quality and clarity is awesome, much better than you'll find online or in bootlegs, it just jumps out at you on the screen.  Beautiful job by all those involved.  I hope the releases continue, so support it enthusiastically and hope there will be a  Volume 2 of The Supremes on Ed Sullivan, and other Diana Ross releases. The publishing clearances and many fine details the gp are unaware of make it nearly impossible for many vintage performances to be released, so I'd rather have this than nothing, and it feels like a lot as you watch it.  You don't feel shortchanged watching this dvd, it's a satisfying entity with merit, you'll enjoy it, watch it again, and will be glad to have it in your collection.
 I was happy to find the last copy on the shelf at 'BB', and with the holidays coming, this dvd could be a huge seller as a stocking stuffer if it finds it way into retail chains, it will sell.

Yes this is incomplete, but hopefully there is a VOL 2 down the road. My VHS tape of these performances is starting to look shoddy after almost 20 yrs. It has always been striking to me to watch diana grow into the diva that she is today while watching these performances. And watching mary turning into a pro while complimenting her...Priceless. Flo..Beautiful! I may not have purchased this if ""Always"" had not been included(my fav). Wish ""the impossible dream"" had been included(sublime). Overall i would recommend to all diehards. I have been a fan now for more than 40yrs. I would encourage those who want more DVD releases(TCB)to purchase this
disc to show that there are a lot of us out here that would support such releases.
I understand the media/merchandise play the Beatles and Elvis get. But why not the Supremes. They were just as important!",1316736000,7,1008,4.700564971751413

Most include Ed's original intro as well as his shaking hands with the group afterwards.  And the good news is there is no extra narration added (previous releases on VHS/DVD included narration).

1. December 27, 1964: Come See About Me. In black & white as originally aired.  A previous release used a colorized version of their first appearance on the Sullivan show.  All other performances are color.
2. September 25, 1966: You Can't Hurry Love.  Flo & Mary add tambourine.
3. May 1, 1966: Love Is Like An Itching In My Heart.  Look for Mary's reaction half way through the song to Diana's adlib line (""Go Mary"") as they dance.
4. December 4, 1966: My Favorite Things.  A holiday fav.
5. May 7, 1967: The Happening. Ed forgets the group's name and introduces them as simply ""the girls.""  Florence Ballard's last time on the program.
6. May 1, 1966: More.
7. September 29, 1968: Love Child.  A lip-sync but performed barefoot in street clothes and natural hair.  They perform the song live just a few months later (both performances are included in the Motown Gold on the Ed Sullivan Show two DVD set).
8. May 5, 1968: Always.
9. May 11, 1969: You're Nobody 'Til Somebody Loves You.  Dedicated to Ed and he even joins the trio during the song.  Mary & Cindy add some comedy during the performance.
10. May 11, 1969: No Matter What Sign You Are.
11. December 21, 1969: Hits Medley (ten songs) on final appearance with Diana.
12. March 24, 1968: Forever Came Today.
Bonus:
13. February 15, 1970: Up The Ladder To The Roof.  Line up of Jean Terrell, Mary Wilson & Cindy Birdsong.

There are four performances on this DVD that are not on any other releases (More, Always, You're Nobody and the hits medley with Cindy).  There are six other performances by the Supremes on the Motown Gold DVD that are not included here.  Those include their second performance of Love Child, I'm Living In Shame, Someday We'll Be Together, My World Is Empty Without You, a five song hits medley with Florence, plus In And Out Of Love (where Cindy makes her debut on Ed's show).  We have yet to get every one of their many performances but, between this DVD and the Motown Gold two disc set, most of the high points have been included.  Improved sound and picture makes this a must have.",1316304000,42,2404,4.561771561771562
4655419,5,B005D0TES6,"I love the dvd. I had already seen all of the performances before but was really happy with the excellent quality full first performance with the trio meeting Ed Sullivan at the end. This was previously released edited and also colorized.
The Post Ross Supremes singing ""Up The Ladder To The Roof"" has been previously released. But not the ""If They Could See Me Now"" performance. I'm surprised a lot of fans didn't know that.
I wish they would release the second Supremes performance with the girls in pink gowns singing ""You're Nobody"". Someday We'll Be Together has also been previously released. I just wish they would REALLY release all the Supremes performances on Ed Sullivan on one dvd in the correct order. It would only be two hours.
Either was I was very happy to get this DVD.",1316131200,6,787,4.669064748201439
4655420,4,B005D0TES6,"I don't see why they didn't just include all of the performances The Supremes did on The Ed Sullivan Show. If I'm not mistaken, I think they were the act that held the record for most performances on the show.

In spite of including only a handful of shows, THE BEST OF THE SUPREMES ON THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW DVD was fun to watch. The only episode in black and white was the first performance of ""Come See About Me,"" the rest was in glorious color and looks pretty decent.

With the original line up of Florence Ballard, Diana Ross, and Mary Wilson, watching them on the DVD, The Supremes had exhibited such an exciting and dynamic screen presence that you can't help but become enthralled by the three girls. And they had such wonderful vocal styling, handling their pop/Motown repertoire as well as classic crooner-type songs like ""More"" and ""My Favorite Things,"" and were the perfect complement to each other. Even though in hindsight we'd come to learn that things were not always happy behind-the-scenes, watching The Supremes on Ed Sullivan and they look like they're having a good time and all is well.

A funny moment happens early on Sullivan makes the comment about how wonderful it is for the group to come from three separate states, but during another performance, when he asks the group about that, Ross corrects him and says they're all from the same state of Detroit, LOL, so I think some of the performances, though split up on the DVD, are actually from the same Sullivan show.

Anyway, the group dynamic definitely changes when they become ""Diana Ross & The Supremes,"" when Cindy Birdsong replaced Ballard. Though there's no mention of it, Sullivan starts announcing them as DR&TS and their performances seemed labored and less fun, which you'll see on the later shows.

The Supremes sing live on all the performances on the DVD except on three: Love Child, No Matter What Sign You Are, and on bonus Up The Ladder (To The Roof) - the latter being done so poorly that the live band plays over the final fade and repeat to cover it, the 70s Supremes stop singing, but the vocals keep going from the playback.

Another thing is the DVD is really short!

But I'd still recommend it for fans of The Supremes.",1316131200,7,2220,4.633587786259542
4655421,3,B005D0TES6,"I bought this DVD thinking that maybe for once we would get all the Supremes performances from the legendary Ed Sullivan Show. Most of these performances have been included on other DVDs but the worst omission of them all is not including their performance of ""Someday We'll Be Together"" from the farewell performance of Diana Ross and the Supremes. If you are going to market this DVD as The Best of The Supremes on the Ed Sullivan Show, why would you not include that performance?? A missed opportunity to say the least. That being said, Motown needs to put both TCB and GIT on Broadway on DVD. Hope someone is listening.",1316044800,4,623,4.621621621621622

I wish this song had been included, as well as the Millie/Rose/Mame number, when the Supremes got their biggest ovation on the Ed Sullivan Show.  This is a great reminder of the staying power of the group, and you can see from 1964 to 1967 how Florence Ballard changed over time in her attitude towards Diana Ross.  I hope a vol. 2 will be released with the Millie/Rose/Mame, Fats Waller number, and the Irving Berlin tribute added to the DVD.",1441065600,,508,4.440860215053763

8466129,5,B005D0TES6,"I've been a Diana Ross and Supremes addict since ""Baby Love"" broke on my transistor radio over 50 years ago. Before the advent of music videos we had TV variety shows to showcase our favorite performers. Appearing on The Ed Sullivan show meant the act (solo or group) had made it to the very top of the entertainment realm, at least for that week. The Supremes appeared some sixteen or more times before Sullivan's audience, in the studio and at home. As Oprah has noted on several occasions, whenever The Supremes appeared on Ed Sullivan Black teens rushed to get in front of a TV set to catch ""the Girls"". The Supremes were something we had never seen before, publicly. They were young, they were talented, they were poised and they were attractive, spelled ""G-O-R-G-E-O-U-S!! In them, we saw ourselves and who we could be. The twelve performances by Diana Ross and The Supremes on this DVD not only bring back all the joy of seeing the trio for the first time, but provides a visual history of the threesome as they developed from a pop act to superstars. Through the course of the DVD, The Supremes go from sweet, young ladies in chiffon to radiant, beautiful showmen showcasing themselves in those form-fitting, dazzling Bob Mackie gowns. As they stepped up their physical appearance, The Supremes also expanded their repertoire. In addition to Motown, they branched out by performing standards (""Always"") and contemporary music (""More""), as well as Broadway show tunes (""My Favorite Things""). My only criticism with this DVD is it does not include all of The Supremes performances on The Ed Sullivan Show. Missing notably is a Broadway medley comprised of ""Thoroughly Modern Millie"", ""Second-hand Rose"" and ""Mame"", and of course, Ross' last Sullivan appearance with The Supremes singing ""Someday We'll Be Together"".",1431129600,,1821,4.973770491803279
