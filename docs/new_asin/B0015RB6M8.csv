8259737,4,B0015RB6M8,A good video for relaxtion but it has a lot of the same moves as his other DVDs.  I think Discover Tia Chi for Fitness is superior: it has several 10 minuite segements that you can use alone or add together.,1428969600,,207,4.048780487804878
8259738,5,B0015RB6M8,"We had a family crisis this past few months and I found this routine very helpful for relieving stress.  Scott's quiet manner gives one confidence, and these simple routines can be practiced all day whenever you feel the tension building again.  I would recommend incorporating these techniques into one's daily exercise program.",1378771200,3,329,5.3076923076923075
8259739,4,B0015RB6M8,I liked this Chi workout it was comfortabley doable. I bought it but sent it back because it did not look complete I thought there was a pamphet that came with it I will probably try purchasing it again with a higher rating incondition.,1363305600,,236,4.386363636363637
8259740,3,B0015RB6M8,The moves on this video is similar to those in another Scott Cole DVD I have.  That was a bit disappointing because I was looking for something that contained new Tai Chi movements.,1351296000,2,181,4.484848484848484
8259741,5,B0015RB6M8,I purchased this for a friend in the hospital. It was great. Soft and relaxing but breathing deep and refreshing air.,1344384000,3,117,4.619047619047619
8259742,4,B0015RB6M8,"This is a decent Chi Kung video. Scott Cole is a relaxed and casual instructor and does a good job demonstrating and explaining the moves. The DVD is fairly short at about 33 minutes and consists of 3 sections. Part 1 (about 10 mins) are seated breathing exercises, which are pretty basic (belly breathing, vocalizing sounds on exhalation, alternate nostril breathing). Part 2 (about 15 mins) are standing Chi Kung movements which include Gathering, Centering & Opening the Chi (involving lowering and raising the arms in circular patterns) which are often used to begin Chi Kung workouts, a simple torso rotation, Flying Wild Goose (from Tai Chi Qigong 18 movements), Heaven Hands (also called Waving Hands like Clouds), 8-Part Energy Breath (a slight variation of the Golden Ball exercise taught on the video ""Chi Kung: the Healing Workout""), Monkey-Bear (a kind of arm swinging, weight shifting movement), and Bending Bear (a really nice forward bending/releasing). Then as a ""bonus"" section, there are the ""8 Poses of Empowerment"" (about 6 mins). This one's a bit more complicated and challenging, but an interesting way to ground, center and stretch.

Cons: I could have done without the generic new agey background music and ocean waves (nothing against new age music in general, but I find even good music on videos like this to often be distracting; some people might prefer it), and the production value is OK but not fantastic. I also think there should be at least 10 more minutes of practices here for the $15 list price, comparable to other Qigong videos I've bought. Overall, this is probably not a 4-star DVD (probably 3 1/2) but I like the exercises and I think it would be a good and effective starting place for a beginner or someone looking for a gentle and holistic workout.",1230940800,20,1794,4.920792079207921
