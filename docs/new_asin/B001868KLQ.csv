3411740,5,B001868KLQ,It was on t.v.  and it kept me on the edge of my seat to see who would win or lose. First the body of a student but who's to blame. Was it there fellow students or was it the bats?Keep guessing but watch it for yourself. I would like to see it again. If you like Lucy Lawless in Xena the warrior princess then you will like this one. Watch it for yourself and find out how or if the kill the vampire bats. Who will win you be the judge.,1286409600,,436,3.739130434782609

8268408,5,B001868KLQ,"I was surprise at this one.  Somewhat scary and horrid, with a villain.  I sorted love bats, as well as snakes, sharks, and dinosaur movies.",1436054400,,140,4.56
8268409,4,B001868KLQ,"This is a sequel to a movie titled Locusts: Day of Destruction (it is referenced by a character, Dan Dryer (Dylan Neal) at one point in this movie).  Both were made in 2005, but only this one is available (and only in a DVD-R format).

The story takes place in a college town near a bayou.  A student goes missing.  He's soon discovered dead, drained of all his blood.  Naturally, the dopey police figure it's a ritualistic murder and blame the two friends who saw him last.  Apparently, they can't tell bite marks when they see them so it's up to a professor (Lucy Lawless as Maddy Rierdon) to solve the crime.  She soon runs into opposition from a shifty mayor (Timothy Bottoms as Hank Poelker) and an obstructive game warden (Liam Waite) with theories and solutions of his own.  Everyone is reluctant to accept Maddy's hypothesis of mutant vampire bats on a killing spree, never mind her suggestions on how to dispose of the menace.  It takes a series of grisly deaths before those in authority decide something needs to be done.  Late in the game, Maddy and a few of her students investigate whether a case of pollution may be the cause of the abnormalities in these vampire bats.  Eventually, the villain of the piece figures Maddy must be dealt with........permanently.

The movie is slow to get to the point, slow to produce the bats and show them chowing down on people.  And when they are finally shown, they're obviously puppets or mechanical constructions (but they get the job done).  This film was meant to showcase Lucy Lawless above everyone else.  It is entertaining if not instructive in how not to make a horror based film.  There's nary a fright to be had.  I did, however, find it enjoyable if not humorous (for all the wrong reasons).

It's a keeper.",1429315200,2,1771,4.621794871794871
8268410,5,B001868KLQ,"If you love Creature Features, look no further! Lucy Lawless is awesome and needs to be in more movies.",1427328000,,103,4.473684210526316
