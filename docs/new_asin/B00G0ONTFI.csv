8619933,3,B00G0ONTFI,"It can be argued that Karl Bhm, Clemens Krauss and Herbert von Karajan conformed the unrivalled trio of exponents of the music of Richard Strauss in the central decades of the XX. Century.  Bhm was a close friend of Strauss and discussed with him in depth the compser's works. and it can be argued this dvd amply shows that. With the Vienna Philharmonic in good form, this opening concert of the 1963 Vienna Festival is indeed a record of a wonderful event. So why three stars and not more, you may ask yourself? Because of the image quality, as the sound is quite good. Accompanying documentation is scant and from it one can't learn of the technology employed for video capture by Austrian Radio & TV (ORF for its german acronym), whether it's a kinescope or video tape recording; it might also be film, as there are moments that certainly look it. But in any case image quality is average at best, with a consistent shadow or ""veil"" that seems to derive from dirt or mould in the camera lens that is always present and which I found irritating. Or may be it is source material deterioration, who knows. In any case contemporary videos from other sources (as for example the Beethoven piano and cello sonatas from Edinburgh with Richter and Rostropovich from the prior year) have a superior quality or seem to have been preserved better than this. You get used to it in the end and end up enjoying the concert, but I felt it had to be noted as nothing is mentioned in the box nor inside.

The playing style in the orchestra is by now ""old style"", as pianist Magaloff used to brand himself, practices some of which were not allowed to pass in studio audio-only recordings of the time but which none the less still were indulged in at live events. Concertmaster Boskovsky's interventions in ""Heldenleben"" for instance, are full of expressive devices now out of fashion. The Vienna Philharmonic of the time still was an all-male organisation and was to remain so for at least three more decades.

I'd say then that this video, which I'm tempted to consider as ""wonderful"", is mainly a document of a now bygone era and cannot be considered as the single representation of the works contained therein in a collection. It is a supplement but a most enjoyable one ...",1484179200,,2262,4.621890547263682
8619934,5,B00G0ONTFI,"Dr. Karl Boehm is one of the greatest conducter in 20 th century.

And the Vienna Philharmonic was his orchestra.

This is the opening concert of Vienna Week 1963 and all Richard Strauss Programm.

Tod und Verklaerung, Burleske and Ein Heldenleben are very deep, beautiful and splendid.

Especially Nikita Magaloff and Willy Boskovsky are very nice.

Vienna Philharmonic under Dr. Karl Boehm is very strong and marvellous.

Special Thanks to Dr. Karl Boehm and Vienna Philharmonic.",1477267200,,481,5.2631578947368425
