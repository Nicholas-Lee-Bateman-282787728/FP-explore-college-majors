8041011,1,B0006B2AI8,Most likely you're a DJ or want to be a DJ and think it would be cool to watch a DJ movie. Don't waste your time or $4 with this movie. The acting and storyline is awful. I threw my copy in the garbage.,1305763200,,202,3.6136363636363638
8041012,1,B0006B2AI8,"This is the worst movie I've ever seen.  It has terrible actors, a ridiculous story, and is badly written.  Whoever wrote this movie definitely didn't graduate from high school.  Don't even waste a precious second of your life on this one.",1208217600,2,239,4.780487804878049

This film is the story of two slacker brothers named Tim (Tim Scarne) and Thom (Thomas Ian Nicholas) who live in a small town trailer park in California. But have big dreams of becoming famous club DJ's in L.A. When their Uncle Marty gets hospitalized they finally get their shot to go to L.A. and DJ a party for his company; unexpectedly when they get there they find out it's a Bar-Mitzvah; not that they have any idea what that means. But while in L.A. Tim discovers there is a DJ spin off with a grand prize of $20,000. But a series of mishaps, mistaken identity, arrogant bouncers, and sneaky competition conspire to crush the brothers' dreams. In a race against time and stupidity, they learn their relationship is more important than anything. The film was co-written by the real life brother duo of Tim Scarne and Thomas Ian Nicholas. It marks the directorial debut of actor Thomas Ian Nicholas (American Pie 1 & 2 and American Wedding, Rules of Attraction, Rookie of the Year). The film was produced by it's star Tim Scarne. It also stars Caleb Moody, Paul Willson, Clare Kramer, and Stacy Bellew. It features cameos by some of the world's biggest DJ's: Carl Cox, Mark Lewis, Colette, Donald Glaude with special appearances by DMC and the late Jam Master Jay. This indie feature has a blazin' soundtrack of the hottest dance music including Dave Aude, DJ Dan, and Christopher Lawrence.
