8370539,5,B002HW5FXQ,"From the dudes and dudettes that brought you ""Total Drama"" and more recently ""Stoked"" comes ""6teen"".  Think of it as an animated version of ""Friends"" - except it takes place at the local mall.  It's called ""6teen"" 'cause it centers around - what else ? - six teenagers: Jen - the responsible one, Jonesy - the smooth operator, Wyatt - the cool-headed musician, Nikki - the tomboy, Caitlin - the sweet girl, and Jude - the dude.  This super cool 2-disc set has the first 13 episodes such as:

""Take This Job and Squeeze It"" - Our team of teens attempt to get their first summer jobs at the mall - including Caitlin, who just got her credit card revoked.

""The Big Sickie"" - The gang decides to spend a day at the mall's amusement park, but Jen refuses to participate.

""Breaking Up with the Boss' Son"" - Jen falls for Coach Halder's son Corey, but has to find a way to break up with him.

""Idol Time at the Mall"" - When none of his friends show up at Wyatt's musical audition, he gets so mad he sings an insulting song about them.

""Employee of the Month"" - When Nikki gets the title ""Employee of the Month"" at the Khaki Barn, things get a little stranger especially for her.

""The Girls in the Band"" - Jen and Caitlin are psyched about their fave boy band coming to the mall.  However, the two get a little jealous when Nikki gets cast in the band's new music video.

I must admit, next to ""Total Drama Island/Action"", this is a pretty good series and I've grown attached to it.  It's got heart, humor, and a rather interesting look a typical teenager's life.  And best of all - if I may borrow a term used in this show - it doesn't suck !

Keep watching Cartoon Network for more on this series and look out for more new episodes on this as well as ""Total Drama"" and ""Stoked"".",1261785600,4,1776,4.262686567164179

Fun characters, decent storylines & a really different animation style makes this a standout series. Tales of growing up were never this fun before.
