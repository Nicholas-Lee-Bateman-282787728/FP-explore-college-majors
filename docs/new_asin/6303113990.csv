566444,5,6303113990,"I loved ""The Little Rascals"" when I was growing up.  I'm glad to see they have a nice mix of episodes with my favorite characters.  Spanky, Alfalfa, Jackie, Buckwheat, Marianne, and Pete (the dog!) are all here!
If you are unfamiliar with the Little Rascals, it was a series of short comedies filmed in the 1920's and 1930's called ""Our Gang"".  The films were about poor kids and their very funny escapades. (Note: there is racial stereotyping that was common at the time of filming, not that that is any excuse!) These were intended to be stand-alone films.  In some films, the gang had parents.  In others, they live in an orphanage.  There were plenty of other inconsistencies like this from episode to episode.  Hal Roach sold the original series to MGM, bought it back, and renamed it, ""Hal Roach's Little Rascals"". More episodes were filmed into the early 1940's.  No episodes were ever produced for TV, but it started playing on TV in 1955 under the name, ""The Little Rascals"".  Jackie Cooper played ""Jackie"".  (Robert Blake played ""Mickey"", but not in any of these episodes.)
Here is an episode guide, with a tiny description:
Teacher's Pet:  Jackie brags to a nice woman about the tricks they plan to play on the new teacher.  Guess who their new teacher is?
School's Out:  Jackie is worried that the new teacher, Miss Crabtree will get married and leave.  So when the gang thinks she has a boyfriend, they try to discourage his interest.

Readin' And Writin':  Brisbane tries to get kicked out of school after his mother reminds him that he can be president if he does well.
Spooky Hooky:  Spanky and Alfalfa want to skip school and go to the circus, so they send Buckwheat and Porky to put a fake doctor's note on the teacher's desk.  When they find out the teacher is taking the class to the circus, they do everything they can to get the note back.
Sprucin' Up:  Spanky and Alfalfa show off to the new truant officer's daughter.
For Pete's Sake!:  After Marianne's doll is destroyed by the local bully, the gang tries to get her a new one.  They end up trading Pete, the dog, for a doll!

The Kid From Borneo:  The gang decides that a wild man from Borneo wants to eat them up.
Dogs Is Dogs:  Pete, the dog, ends up at the pound after he is accused of eating Mr. Brown's chickens.
The Pooch:  Stymie steals a pie, but is forgiven when he gets the other kids' dogs from the dogcatcher.

Dog Heaven:  Pete, the dog, is upset because Joe spent money on a girl rather than a promised dog collar.  Pete saves the girl from drowning, but gets in trouble when Joe thinks Pete pushed her into the water.",1074643200,73,2608,4.50319829424307

566446,5,6303113990,"Volume 3 in the ""Little Rascals"" collection is quite different from the first two because the first three episodes focus on Jackie Cooper's infatuation with his new teacher, Miss Crabtree.  ""Teachers's Pet"" (1930) finds the gang upset on the first day of school that their beloved Miss McGillicuddy has been replaced by a new teacher which the horrible name of Miss Crabtree.  Of course she is a beautiful young blonde (June Marlowe) who happens to pick up Jack and Wheezer on the way to school.  They proudly reveal some of the stunts they have for their new teacher: sneezing powder, red ants and a mouse.  Fortunately, Miss Crabtree is not only good looking, she is pretty smart too.  ""Teachers' Pet"" is a different type of ""Our Gang"" comedy, in that there it relies on the story rather than gadgets and action.  This one has Jackie, Farina, Chubby, Wheezer, Echo, and Hercules.  A fitting companion piece, ""School's Out"" (1930) is the next ""Our Gang"" comedy made but now it is the end of the school year and Jackie is passing around a ""partition"" for school to stay open all summer.  Seems he likes Miss Crabtree a lot, which is why Jackie's crush makes him chase off the stranger who is asking after her.  Jackie is not going to let this team get married and run away (but it is only her brother).  There is a nice bit here involving a Miss Crabtree trying to give the kids a quiz.  jackie, Farina, Chubby and Mary Ann have most of the action in this one.
Jackie's love for Miss Crabtree continues to get the better of him in ""Love Business"" (1931).  But now he has some serious competition.  Miss Crabtree is now a border at Jackie's house and when Chubby shows up to propose marriage the insanely jealous Jackie sabotages his friends every romantic effort (Chubby had been practicing on a cutout of Greta Garbo).  What is interesting here is that Miss Crabtree plays along, actually kissing him when he tells she is pretty; I sure do not remember my teachers being like this.  But the fun here is between the romantic rivals, Jackie and Chubby.
The final episode, ""Spooky Hooky"" (1936) offers up an entirely different set of Little Rascals: Buckwheat, Porky, Spanky, Alfalfa, and Von the Dog.  However, school is still the common denominator, because the circus is coming to town and Spanky has a plan to get them out of class.  Irony abounds, not only in that the plan almost backfires big time, but in that fiction comes true in the end.  This is only a one-reeler from Roach Studios and the gang's teacher, Miss Jones (Rosina Lawrence) is not as cute as Miss Crabtree, but it does teach the lesson that honesty is the best policy.  So, overall, Volume 3 is another first rate collection of Little Rascal comedies, even if they do try to convince young kids that school is an okay place to be during the day.",1020988800,4,2817,4.598

566588,5,6303113990,"NEWS FLASH for frustrated collectors of this series: While the discs of the 2008 set, which follows the same contents list as these separate discs, did not live up to the 'complete', 'uncut', 'from original masters' claims on the box at that time, it seems that once remastered c. 2011 to better fulfill the promise, each disc was issued separately (as here). Collectors assumed that the boxed set continued to supply the inferior 2008 discs, and that one had to purchase the 2011 discs separately to get the upgrade.

What is less well known, and which I discovered the 'expensive' way, is that these 2011-remastered discs are identical to those being used in current printings of the box set as well. I bought the set (with inferior transfers, many not from masters) in 2008, years later buying these much improved separates, then in the last few months, I bought the box set again. The discs of the set (whose box markings still carry the c. 2008 date - but whose box has dropped the 'from the original masters', 'remastered', 'restored' and 'uncut' claims form the front), all say c. 2011, have the MGM intros where the 2008 set had Blackhawk films intros, etc., and are identical to the 2011 separate disc issues. Though the newer boxes have dropped some of the claim blurbs which were on the original boxes, it remains unclear if they were dropped prior to 2011 during the controversy generated by disappointed fans, or if they were dropped at the same time the upgraded discs were being used. As this remains a mystery, it is still going to be uncertain whether a particular sealed box set will have the 2008 discs or the upgraded 2011 discs, so I would go with purchasing an open set after inquiring with the dealer first.

Good luck!",1464220800,3,1742,4.689542483660131

566859,3,6303113990,being this is the very first Little Rascals from 1929 the sound is a bit off & it is hard to hear some of the kids talking.  The 2nd volume is SO much better than this one.,1357948800,3,172,3.6486486486486487
566940,3,6303113990,"Of course, the content is amazing.  No one since has gotten performances out of kids like you'll find on these shorts. Word of warning, they're racist as hell... well as racist as people were in the 20s and 30s, which is... very. Also, until later years, these didn't have much of a plot or story.  Mostly some cute kids getting forced into weird situations and filmed with a few slapstick moments.

The quality on the other hand... not so good.  Audio is sometimes very hard to understand, and I'm not just talking about Buckwheat.  Someone said these were taken from the Cabin Fever restorations... that is a lie.  I have a few of those on VHS and they're another world of quality.  Sadly, they're gone and hard to find.

I can highly recommend this set regardless of what titles you have owned from the past. Packaging is what you would expect as well with no flaws or skimping. Has the correct order of release for each volume. Easy title selection makes it a breeze to find the film you want to view. I do not know all the problems involved in acquiring and adding the sound to each film but it seems that a better job could have been done. A bit of a roller coaster sound wise with most films having a silent title beginning, including the MGM Lions roar, and a few spots of silence or quite loud or very low volume. Just a few words missing from the ""Cabin Fever"" tapes. Generally very good though. Just a few words about one of Amazon's distributors, Importcds. I ordered all 7 volumes from importcds and they were very good. Great packaging, prompt shipping, etc. If they would only combine shipping for each volume it would have been perfect. Shipping cost more than the DVDs themselves. All in all, the best experience I have had since ordering Vivendi's ""Laurel and Hardy-The Essential Collection""",1326585600,11,1255,4.632286995515695

Mistakes like this are why Genius Entertainment is currently out of business and Vivendi currently carries the torch as distributor of Our Gang and the rest of RHI's holdings.  All prints in these volumes include original title cards and great looking prints--no Blackhawk or Film Classics prints in sight.

The collection is not perfect.  A few seconds of footage are missing from ""Bear Shooters"" and ""Washee Ironee,"" both of which can be found uncut on certain DVD releases elsewhere (for completists).  The lack of subtitles can certainly impair the enjoyability of the earliest talkies using sound-on-disc methods, both because the children are still learning how to act vocally and the audio from the surviving sound discs are in a bit of rough shape (much like the earliest Laurel and Hardy shorts).

The only thing truly lacking are the surviving silents that Vivendi owns and have not released.  Hopefully a silent collection is forthcoming from this company.",1323648000,8,1094,5.181818181818182

Now, if they had taken that much time and effort on correcting problems with the sound, then the shorts would be perfect.  Railroadin' has a distinct hiss in the sound track and can make understanding the actors words difficult to understand.  There are many ways sound can be improved and hiss reduced or eliminated and that has been done on other sound tracks, but it appears as if nothing was done to this short.  This makes the set very disappointing in my opinion and would recommend anyone considering buying this set to put off the purchase until all of the problems have been resolved.",1321056000,6,679,4.633333333333334

This disc fixes the errors on that set by presenting the first 10 Roach shorts with their original titles returned (many on the original set had Blackhawk reissue titles!) and they are now truly uncut (Genius carelessly used cut masters on several shorts, these are uncut transfers that Cabin Fever used, which is what Genius should have used originally).  So, my advice if you have the 2008 box set, buy these INEXPENSIVE individual DVD releases as they come out and replace them in the box set packaging (which is very nice).  The second disc is already scheduled and is also under ten bucks.  Pre order it!  It is the same cover art as this one but in blue.

Small Talk
Railroadin'

Lazy Days
Bouncing Babies

Shivering Shakespeare
The First Seven Years
When The Wind Blows
Bear Shooters

And the stars will be Jackie Cooper, Chubby Chaney, Wheezer, Farina, Mary Ann, Jackson, and in the first four films Joe Cobb.

These first Our Gang (aka Little rascals) sound comedies are a mixture, some can be very fun while others are rather awkward as the studio learns to edit sound and keep the comedy pace going.  The only clinkers are, Lazy Days which is just that, Lazy; and Bear Shooters which is quite boring. There is almost no story, just kids running around pretending to be bear hunters.

567081,4,6303113990,"The kids have a new teacher in ""Teacher's Pet"" and she couldn't possibly be a nice as Miss McGullicudy. After all, her name is Miss Crabtree! The gang gets together to devise a plan to get this Miss Crabtree by bringing in ants, itching powder, and even a mouse. On the way to school, Jackie hitches a ride with a beautiful blonde woman and tells her all of his plans for the day. What a bad move that was; the beautiful blonde is Miss Crabtree. She is hurt by the news that her students already hate her, especially since she planned to give them all ice cream.

""School's Out"" is a bit of a sequel to ""Teacher's Pet,"" and begins with Miss Crabtree's brother coming to town. She just can't wait to see him, but the gang mistakes him for her boyfriend and fears losing her to marriage. Jackie is especially vehement about getting rid of this guy because he has developed a schoolboy crush on his teacher. The gang does all they can to discourage this man on top of discouraging Miss Crabtree's teaching by giving foolish answers to her daily quiz.

""Love Business"" again features Miss Crabtree, this time outside of the schoolroom. Jackie still loves her, and this time so does Chubby. When she takes a vacant room in Jackie's house, his dreams come true and he plans ways to make her fall for him. He digs out his mother's old love letters and memorizes them, in spite of Wheezer's constant teasing. Chubby does the same, with Dorothy mocking his every phrase. Finally comes the night to win her over, and both boys are present while Miss Crabtree humors them in the sitting room.

""Spooky Hooky"" is the final short on the tape and it features a much later group of kids. The gang wants to go to the circus instead of going to school, so they put a sick note on the teacher's desk. Then they find out that the teacher was going to take them all to the circus the next day. Spanky decides that they will all return at night to steal the note back, and what a night! It is stormy and dark, and Buckwheat is afraid of the dark. The night watchman hears the kids making noise and comes out to investigate, but he suspects ghosts more than he suspects mischievious children.

This tape features commentary by film historian Leonard Maltin and crisp, clear photography.",1208649600,2,2264,4.47457627118644
567082,5,6303113990,"The first of the Cabin Fever Little Rascals tapes, this excellent series gets started with a bang. ""Fly My Kite"" features a group of kids at Grandma's house. Grandma is an elderly woman with few friends besides the gang, and she adores having them around to read stories to and play games with. Unfortunately, her sweetness is taken advantage of by her son Dan who does all he can to swindle her. When he learns that some saving bonds she holds are worth a fortune, he lies about their value to collect for himself. It is too bad that the bonds are outside on the tail of Chubby's kite. Hilarity ensues as the gang fights off this menace of a man. This was the last time that Chubby and Mary Ann appeared in an Our Gang short, a symbol of the coming of a new era in the gang's cast.

""Honky-Donkey"" features that new group of kids. Here we see Spanky and Scotty teamed up together as the wise youngsters who are never taken seriously. The gang has a mule named Algebra who gets riled up with a sneeze and who is calmed by a bell. The kids rig a makeshift merry-go-round with Algebra as the power. It all looks pretty fun to rich-kid Wally who insists he be allowed to play too. He has so much fun, he decides to take the mule and the kids home with him, which of course, turns out to be a disaster. Making an appearance is Tommy Bond before he became Butch of the later shorts.

""Beginner's Luck"" is one of those great putting-on-a-show films with lots of music of the era. Spanky's mother fancies him to be a big shot actor and has him memorize Shakespeare to perform for her friends. She is so proud that she enters him into an ameatur night at the Ritz Theater. Determined not to have to read such ""sissy"" lines again, Spanky urges the gang to ruin him on stage. They all agree with enthusiasm, and on the big night are present in the first row with all of the noisemakers and spitballs in town. On goes the show! Specialty acts like Alfalfa and his brother Harold singing ""She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain"" and a group of cute but talentless girls singing ""Honalulu Baby"" are cute, but the real showstopper is Spanky. He changes his mind about wanting to flop; a pretty little girl with stage fright wants the prize desperately so she can buy her costume, and Spanky decides to win it for her. But the gang does not comply and inadvertantly helps him while hurting him!

""Reunion In Rhythm"" is the final short on this tape and features some of the previous cast members with their replacements. Mickey Daniels, Mary Kornman, Joe Cobb, and Farina Hoskins return for the class reunion and are treated to some musical numbers by the new gang. Porky and Darla are two dolls in ""Baby Face,"" Spanky leads the gang in the extravagant ""Broadway Rhythm,"" and Alfalfa swears he'll never love another girl in ""I'm Through With Love"" just after being serenaded to ""Goin' Hollywood."" However, the real show stopper is Buckwheat, relegated to holding cue cards announcing each scene, but really wanting to be the actor. He takes matters into his own hands by reciting ""Little Jack Horner"" as many times as time allows, much to the chagrin of Spanky and the gang.

These tapes feature wonderful commentary from film historian Leonard Maltin. As always, the picture quality is clear and crisp thanks to the painstaking restoration of these gems.",1208649600,5,3337,4.529021558872305

567140,4,6303113990,"Another excellent collection of Rascalism.

We have in tandem TEACHER'S PET and SCHOOL'S OUT. These two films introduce the Miss Crabtree (June Marlowe as the pretty teacher) cycle. The first one has Jackie Cooper and the gang trying to scare away their teacher's potential sweetheart (""she has a mean teampature""!)-or so they think. SCHOOL'S OUT features the classic history exam-

Miss crabtee-""Buddy O'Donald, what did Paul Revere say on his midnight ride?""

Buddy-""He said WHOA!""

Then we have what amounts to two very ANTI-racist Gang comedies. In THE POOCH (1932), the white Rascals band together to help their Black pal Matthew ""Stymie"" Beard keep the Dogcatcher from killing his cannine pal Pete. In DOGS IS DOGS (1931), Sherwood and his mena mama won't let Stymie come in to play with Dorothy and Wheezer, but guess who helps to save the day?

SPOOKY HOOKY (1936) has the later generation of Rascals (Spanky, Alfalfa, Buckwheat, and Porky) trying to retrieve a phony note from their teacher. The gang (and janitor Dudley Dickerson) gets scared out of their wits by a skeleton in the dark. Even my nephews, who don't usually take well to black and white films, enjoyed this one.

DOG HEAVEN (1927) is not so hot. Not one of the better silent Our Gangs (which I usually treasure), this is a rather crude entry with the beloved Pete trying to hang himself (rather graphically, I might add) after his master Joe deserts him for a yonug girl. The comedic canine is also shown using his paws to hold up bottles of bootleg liquor to get drunk from in despondency. YUCK! Keep the kiddies away from this one!

Other than that, a typically great collection.",1145664000,2,1656,4.830388692579505
567141,4,6303113990,"I grew up watching the old re-runs of the Little Rascals in the 1980s and watching those shows are some of my most vivid childhood memories.

In retrospect, why can't viewers accept the fact that this show featured good, clean innocent childhood fun AND yet also had some racist undertones consistent with the times?

To say this show wasn't groundbreaking and hilarious, is to ignore the facts. But to say that this show, looking back, didn't have some racist undertones is also to ignore the facts.

Look at Amos-N-Andy. A large portion of the Black Community in the 1950s refused to watch this program because of its overtly racist undertones, and yet a lot of those same people will admit today that it's hard NOT to laugh at some of the humor.

You just have to be honest and be real when watching old footage of Hollywood shows like these.

I'll continue to laugh when I watch these episodes, but in adulthood, it's hard not to also think back to what living in the 1920s and '30s was like for my family -- it wasn't always all fun and games (and no doubt, we all know that TV & Hollywood images have proven to be equally empowering & damaging for a number of reasons).

Little Rascals should serve as the ultimate history lesson.

Great writing & great comedy are timeless. This kind of racism, no matter how blatant or hidden,is dated.

These DVDs attest to that.",1141689600,11,1371,4.544715447154472
567142,2,6303113990,"Ok now I am afraid to try any other Our Gang DVDs! No one mentions how poor the sound is, so that it it almost impossible to understand what is being said! This made this DVD worthless in my opinion.",1134777600,5,199,4.0
567143,5,6303113990,"This DVD has a REALLY good selection of Gang/ Rascals comedies, among the best of the bunch!

""Free Wheeling"" (1932) Much has been said about the supposed racism of the Gang/Rascals, but this is possibly the most ANTI-racist of all gang films. Dickie Moore's snooty mother overprotects her impaired son and refuses to let him play with Stymie, who she referrs to as ""that colored boy"" and ""that street urchin,"" but guess who saves the day? Strong stuff for 1932 and good stuff for today.

Mike Fright (1934) is a hoot about the gang's ""International Silver String Submarine Band"" running amuck at a radio station. LOVE the gag where Tommy Bond sucks a lemon (""they're good for your freckles"") while Leonard tries to play the trumpet.

As for ""Shiver My Timbers,"" (1931), Leonard Maltin has not spoken well of this film in his Our Gang book, but I LOVE it! This is where a salty old sailor scares the gang with wild pirate stories. Anyone who has ever had the fun of telling children scary stories will have a soft spot for this pix.
