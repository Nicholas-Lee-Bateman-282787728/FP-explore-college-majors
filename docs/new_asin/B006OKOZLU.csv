5009955,4,B006OKOZLU,This is the first Call of the Wild movie we have seen.  I think I may get a few of the episodes.  My 9 year old and I watched it.  We really enjoyed it.,1384300800,3,152,3.411764705882353
5009956,5,B006OKOZLU,This is a great adaptation of Jack Londons classic novel. I would recommend reading the book and then watching this movie to any older school aged child as well as adults who are not familiar with the story.,1368230400,9,207,4.473684210526316

5009978,2,B006OKOZLU,Not true to the book.  Not even the right kind of dog.,1453939200,3,54,3.5

5009980,4,B006OKOZLU,"I loved this movie.  The scenery was beautiful, and the acting was great.  Rick Schroder grew up to be a very handsome man, and a good actor.  I enjoyed this movie.  I'd watch it again.",1451174400,,185,4.2

5009986,5,B006OKOZLU,"Look, there are deviations from the book, starting out with the fact that Buck is not a German shepherd--and more significant plot changes, though the ending is pretty darn close. We have a German shepherd, though, which made my young son think our dog was starring in the movie. We all enjoyed it very much, including my dog, who howled along. Bittersweet, powerful ending. The quality of the DVD was not super sharp, and it was not full screen, but it worked just fine.",1412985600,3,471,4.619047619047619

8502052,5,B006OKOZLU,This was one of my sons favorite movies when he was a child.  I ordered a copy of it for his son.,1512086400,,97,3.409090909090909
8502053,2,B006OKOZLU,"I am a high school English teacher and bought movie intending to show it to my class after we read ""The Call of the Wild.""  I'm glad I previewed it first, because it DOES NOT follow the story at all, the acting is mediocre, and the movie is dull.  It's fine as a stand-alone, but if you're looking for something close to Jack London, this is not your best bet.  I will not be using this version to enhance our enjoyment of the classic tale.",1508716800,5,440,4.152941176470589

8502055,5,B006OKOZLU,"I have been looking for this version of the movie for some time now, I remember watching it on tv a few times but never found out the release date.. I did order a couple of the other versions and just received the first one (1972 version) which was very slow and boring! I am hoping the next one I ordered will be the correct one!",1497484800,,330,4.015151515151516

8502059,4,B006OKOZLU,"Somewhat brutal and upsetting for young children at first, but faithful to the book.  This was a mde-for-Tv short, appearing in 1993, and doesn't quite have the impact of the original 1935 film with Jack London as one of the writers.",1464912000,,233,4.682926829268292
