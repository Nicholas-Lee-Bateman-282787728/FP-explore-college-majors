It doesn't get much better than this video.  We love going to the beach...Watching this video really takes us there.  Thank you.",1431820800,,270,4.933333333333334

7917009,3,B00003CM1C,"I love these ocean videos, since I'm 1500 miles from the sea and can't get there as often as I'd like.  This one has some lovely scenes, but the colors bother me.  They feel strange and artificial, muddy purply-brown skies, gray seas, weird florescent flowers...These look like places I'd love to visit, but it's hard to believe I'm there with those strange colors.  I don't know if they used filters, or if the light really did happen to look like that.  Maybe they went looking for odd light conditions.  I'd find it a lot more relaxing with some blue sunny skies and orange sunsets.",1254960000,,585,4.586538461538462

7917011,5,B00003CM1C,"I brought this tape for a friend who was in the hospital. Anyone who has been in a hospital knows how noisy they can be and how difficult it is to get rest and relaxation. Then nurses caring for my friend noticed that less pain medication was needed when this tape was on. It proved to be great for everyone to relax too. I came to visit one evening, and found several staff in the room mesmerized by watching the tape. They had all written down the name of the tape and stated they were going to get a copy. I found out that several did and they stated it was the best medicine for letting go of stress after a busy shift and that they noticed that they went to sleep much quicker. I even purchased extra tapes to give as gifts. I'm now buying the DVD format to give. This is a wonderful way to let the stress of the day just go out with the waves.",1177891200,2,849,4.029585798816568
7917012,5,B00003CM1C,"This is a quiter ocean dvd than Californian Dreams but is still relaxing. This dvd features many of the sites on Californian dreams but the waves are more gental and lapping. There is one night sean with waves lapping under the moonlights reflection which I enjoyed. Also on Day 5 you see several light houses. On one view you see a lighthouse in the distance over looking the ocean,but if you look closely enough you can see a intermentent light beam as it turns. It's a little white bright light that goes on and off but it's hard to see. Also it's possible there might be a foghorn on day 5 or 6. I thought I heard one but it was very distant and hard to here if I did. If that's what it was it wasn't as loud as the one in Californian Dreams. Also on Californian zen is a nice group of gulls scattered thruout but not as numourous as in Californian Dreams. The ocean seems like it's in the background on zen but it is still relaxing and is worth adding to your dvd collection. If you have Hawaiian dreams,Californian dreams and Californian zen you can pop one in each day and it will seem like a three day vacation. I highely recommend all three of these dvds for your collection. I hope the producer will make one of the Atlantic. Preferely the Southeast coast such as Savannah GA or Jekell Island GA.",1019260800,10,1306,4.313008130081301
7917013,5,B00003CM1C,What a wonderful way to clear your mind sitting quietly on a beach. The sounds of the surf alone will help calm you. The sights of incredible sunsets make you realize how beautiful and precious life is. Highly recommended for anyone who meditates or is in search of a quiet place of solitude!,983577600,6,292,4.528301886792453
7917014,5,B00003CM1C,"As a caregiver for my handicap dad, these Waves tapes are our salvation.  Powerful real medicine that speaks to the body, mind and spirit. Quick way  for mom and me to meditate, relax or escape. It instantly alters our whole  enviroment, giving hours of peace. Beautiful beaches and lovely birds make  this one of my favorite Wave's videos.",965347200,5,340,4.810344827586207
7917015,4,B00003CM1C,"I recommend Waves to anyone who has trouble sleeping. It really helps you relax and to sit quietly for a few minutes... It's great to have Waves bring the soothing beach to me in my small apartment, late at night.",944697600,8,213,4.35
