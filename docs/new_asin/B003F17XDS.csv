8395769,4,B003F17XDS,"What you see is what you get, a classic skateboard video that delivers raw footage as it happens,
not some cheesy flick where every trick is landed back to back to back.  This gave me a whole new
insight of what it means to be a Pro skateboarder and perform a demo in front of a lot of people...
how fun it could be, and how frustrating it could be trying to land one particular trick. Jason
Lee is a great guy and now and awesome actor, it was neat seeing him in this video as a Pro
skater.  I can't believe how much style he has!!!  I wonder if there are any other videos out there
like this (just raw unedited footage)??!!!",1299888000,,626,4.073170731707317
