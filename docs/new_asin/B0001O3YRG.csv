We don't want to buy this only to find we already have it. I only give it 2 stars because all we know is that it is Scooby-Doo.",1103414400,5,294,4.175438596491228

  Nowhere can you find any information, as to what is included, on, or what to expect, when you purchase this DVD Collection.
 Once you buy it; you will find out that it is of Great Value, to anyone that has children, who love Scooby Doo beyond compare.
  I recommend this Collection very highly,and I will definitely call it a Best Buy !  You will love this new 2004 WB release !",1090108800,5,564,4.427184466019417
