2919599,1,B000UAE7O0,"Grindhouse was one of 2007's best movies. This is only half the movie.
Find a bootleg copy of the theatrical release and stick it to the distributors who are trying to rip the fans off!",1186531200,26,185,4.314285714285714
2919600,1,B000UAE7O0,I loved Grindhouse at the movie theaters. Despite its poor success at the box office. I have been so excited to see this Dvd. Only to find out they are going to screw there fans by releasing Planet Terror and DeathProof seprately. So I would have payed $30 for a special edition for both movies together. Instead out of protest I will buy neither. Why whould you do this to your fans. Nobody else cares about the movie and the fans have spoken. Its not to late to package the movies together.,1186531200,14,492,4.358695652173913
2919601,5,B000UAE7O0,"couldnt ask for more from this movie, it blows death proof out of the water even though both were good.  Would really like this dvd to come with all of the grindhouse in it, seperating it is a bit of a money grabber, just download it.",1186444800,,234,4.086956521739131
2919602,1,B000UAE7O0,"It's OK that they are selling these movies seperate but I want the whole Grindhouse movie together. Not giving the fans the option on something like this is a slap in the face. Give us what we want. Even if they wanted to make a huge Special Edition, it would be worth a little extra money. Not giving us the theatrical release on DVD is, well, not cool man.",1186444800,13,358,4.202898550724638
2919603,5,B000UAE7O0,"This movie is so much fun!  As Robert Rodriguez proved his truly awesome  talent two years ago with Sin City (also with El Mariachi, Desperado, and  From Dusk Till Dawn), he scores once again with Planet Terror.  It's a zombie film made in an old-school way, featuring hardcore violence, awesome music and pervasive dark comedy.  I hope you have fun!",1186185600,4,350,4.766666666666667
2919604,5,B000UAE7O0,"I love this movie.  It's a trip back to my drive-in theater days.  The sound of the crappy metal speaker hanging from daddy's side of the wood panel station wagon.  Playing on the playground equipment while the sun set.  Theater popcorn, jammies, blankets, asleep before the second reel of the John Wayne western, or war movie.  Mostly westerns.  PLANET TERROR boasts perfect casting.  Love the creativity in the story, like Marley Shelton having numbed hands, then broken wrists, starting her car with her teeth.  This is the kind of stuff that makes it better than the genres it mocks, because it really does develop a story and really does have excellent production values.  I love how quickly he accepts Cherry without a leg, as if to say, ""So what?  That's nothing.  Let's go!""  The movie sets out to be campy fun and it succeeds.",1514678400,,835,4.722222222222222
2919605,1,B000UAE7O0,"god awful... the script and story is bad enough and that is suppose to be the plot, but still, the bad deliberate film quality and puss strewn effects was just way to gross for any sane person.",1510963200,,193,4.243243243243243

2919620,3,B000UAE7O0,"Skip this and buy the ""Grindhouse"" double-feature blu ray instead. Two movies for the price of one, and they are FAR superior versions of the film. The Grindhouse versions are both about 15 minutes shorter, cutting out a lot of the unnecessary filler, plus you get the wonderful fake trailers missing from the individual DVDs.",1491436800,,326,4.945454545454545

2919623,5,B000UAE7O0,"This is by far the best movie Rodriguez has ever made. It is a parody but actually genuinely creepy at times. Very funny and weird. Tarantino is in it as an actor and he is terrible as usual but he is not on screen long enough to ruin the film. Love this damn thing. Is it a serious movie? No, absolutely not. The ""plot"" is intentionally ridiculous. But it works and is totally entertaining.",1488067200,,391,4.297297297297297

2919637,5,B000UAE7O0,I like Grindhouse movies. Quentin Tarantino is my favorite. Only rated it 5 stars because I collect Grindhouse movies. If I had to rate the actual movie then I would give it 3 stars. It is extremely silly but I would still give it a chance and watch it.

2919676,5,B000UAE7O0,"I have never walked into a movie so good, I was shocked. My ex was watching this on his giant, curved, plasma T.V. and when I went in to complain about the noise, I saw Rose with a machine gun leg, flying off a roof, zooming through the air shooting zombies. ""WTF?!"" So what did I do? Sat down, gave it 5 minutes and was hooked until the end; then I had to watch it again from the beginning. This movie is so underrated, I'm surprised she didn't win an award for this! (If only she had used her leg on Manson when they were dating. ugh). Quentin does an ""o.k"". job in acting, but the rest of the cast shines and the lines that are all tossed in here are hilarious and flat out mean! This movie is an instant cult classic for any fan of Rose, Quentin or zombies for that matter. The humor in this is so funny, the characters are REAL AS YOU CAN GET, it's bloody disgusting and the dialogue is all over the place! A Splatterhouse of a zombie film!

2919705,5,B000UAE7O0,"""Grindhouse"" is a double-feature, in which one film, ""Deathproof,"" was directed by Quentin Tarantino and the other, ""Planet Terror,"" was directed by collaborator Robert Rodriguez.  What I love about both films is the way they capture the B-moviegoing experience of the 1970s, with cheesy-looking ""Coming Attractions"" and ""Feature Film"" titles (both exactly duplicating the titles of the time), as well as the graininess, color fluctuations, grating electronic score, and rough film splices that I recall from my adolescence.  The plot?  Oh yeah.  A bunch of small-town denizens battle zombies and military types when there is a major leak at a nearby chemical warfare plant.  While retro in its appearance, the film is set in the new millennium, replete with cell phones.  Wonderful melodramatic characters, but especially look for Josh Brolin as a vengeful doctor and of course Rose McGowan as the stripper heroine with the machine-gun leg.",1429401600,4,941,5.36734693877551

It has a really great cast - except for one casting choice: Freddy Rodriguez. He just doesn't have the screen presence and complex snarliness this character requires.

And despite the great job of the other actors and the great look of the film, this has something missing that was also missing (unfortunately) from ""Machete"" which could also have been a blast. There's a hole of some kind at the middle of Rodriguez's movies, something missing. They 'grind' on you, or should I say they grind you down.

2919751,2,B000UAE7O0,"Humor is one of those things which vary widely from person to person, therefore unless you have a penchant for gross, the cast of this film may not be enough to carry it for the non-zombie connoisseur who lets this be their introduction into zombie genre films.  Rose McGowan is lovely, but ""where's the beef"" regarding using her name and cover photo pose as a huge teaser to get you to hope for some revealing footage from her performance.  There are some recognizable actors and actresses here, but even reminding myself that this show is an intentional spoof film, I can't understand the undeserved hype and rave reviews by so many Amazon reviewers.  If you're under 14 years old, you'll more than likely enjoy this film perfectly fine.  I recommend ""Zombieland"" a 2009 release DVD with Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, & Bill Murray.  At least ""Zombieland"" is entertaining.
The marketing gimmick of emphasizing this ""Planet Terror"" film is presented by Grindhouse is clever, but this is not a movie boiling over with sex or nudity.  I could watch this film sitting in the same room with my daughter and my mother and not flinch.
From what some of my acquaintances have said, ""Death Proof"" with Kurt Russell has better special effects if you're a fan of death and gore.  Maybe I'll get it next and hope for something worth having in my DVD movie collection.
My mind cannot grasp why the extended and unrated two disc special edition version of ""Planet Terror"" is a big selling point.  I guess those giving 5 star reviews of this film are zombie genre aficionados, relatives of somebody in the cast, or investors hoping to recoup their money.",1411344000,4,1640,4.75

It's intentionally bad, but in a fun way, which is confusing for some. So if you're looking for Shakespeare, you might want to avoid this.

For the rest of us, this is a fun and funny movie that will make you laugh (sometimes with it, sometimes at it) and cringe multiple times as a go-go dancer's dream of becoming a stand-up comedian is derailed by zombie apocalypse. It's even better with a group of friends, especially those who will get the humor yet still lightheartedly make fun of the movie. Also better with pizza rolls.",1404432000,,655,4.589743589743589

2919792,2,B000UAE7O0,"I suppose to an extent *all* zombie flicks are odd (that is, if you're one of the few who's only seen one or two in your lifetime) but this one is clearly more unusual than the rest.  It begins with footage that resembles late 70's/early 80's with cracks in the picture and audio, and... believe it or not, that's going to be the way the film is presented the entire way through.  While I don't mind the cracks at all, what I DO mind is the lack of any memorable characters.  This is one of those movies where they just throw a bunch of characters on screen and expect us to care about them without developing anybody in any way.  In this case a hot stripper played by the *extremely* attractive Rose McGowan, a Spanish testicle-collecting drug dealer who later on has the antidote for the zombie infection, and Josh Brolin as a doctor.  If this all sounds really odd to you, well you'd be exactly right- it is!

So how about the actual zombies?  They don't attack in any way that will have your heart racing.  At least not initially.  In fact they often feel like more of an afterthought to the deliberately far-fetched acting and storyline (that does change in the second half, at least).  Perhaps the reason Planet Terror feels so weird is that it's trying to be a mockery of the zombie genre which would explain the exaggerated way, to name one example, a man jumpkicks or bounces off walls while cautiously walking down hospital hallways eliminating the zombies, and the way the music gets WAY too dramatic out of nowhere is another indication the writers are going for something else here.  Also, let's not forget the way people practically explode into a bucket of paint-resembling red blood the moment they're shot or run over (even a poor dog becomes a splashable victim later on!)  The problem is that it's not a true mockery so it's somewhere in between a legitimate zombie thriller and making fun of zombies, and this concept doesn't really work for me.  It has to be one or the other.

I can't believe the writers actually thought Josh Brolin would fit the doctor role.  I beg to differ!  He's too serious much like his old man.  He should be out there fighting and shooting the zombies instead.  At least Rose McGowan is perhaps the hottest woman of all-time, so at least her addition and performance is a major selling point.  Come on, she really is sweat-drippingly hot don't you think?  Well this is an acquired taste as far as zombie movies go.  Some of you will enjoy the intense far-fetched acting, volcano-pouring blood spills, intentionally implemented Die Hard-like comedy segments, fights and explosions, others will dislike it and will feel cheated that they didn't get something closer to a group of people driving away from a severe swarm of zombies.  I'm part of the latter group I'm afraid.

I mostly need characterization but also something more comparable to a zombie thriller instead of a bunch of cheap tricks disguised as one.  I do love the way the one police officer gets torn apart like a soft pretzel, haha.  Also, Twirling guns like a cowboy, driving motorcycles out of town on the back wheels, a peg leg being forced into a mans eye socket, helicopter blades serving as decapitations (hilaroius segment this one is), Rose McGowan using artillery guns as a leg, having trouble knowing which position Rose wants to sit herself on the motorcycle... well I suppose the final 20 minutes is pretty entertaining.

2919827,4,B000UAE7O0,"Big budgets. Big name actors. And talent. Three things that would never be found in any of the films that filled the 42nd Street theaters throughout the 60s and 70s. Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino set out to emulate the Exploitation experience for mainstream audiences in their double-bill GRINDHOUSE, with mixed results. Rodriguez brings us PLANET TERROR, about a toxic bio-weapon that transforms half of Texas into deformed, pus-spewing maniacs. A lone band of survivors take on this mutant menace, lead by the one-legged go-go dancer Cherry Darling and her mysterious gunfighter boyfriend known only as El Wray. With a total budget of $53 million dollars and a cast that includes Bruce Willis, Rose McGowan, Josh Brolin, and others, GRINDHOUSE is about as far removed from films like DON'T GO IN THE BASEMENT and I DRINK YOUR BLOOD as anything could be. There is nothing cheap about the explosive special effects that plaster the screen in an absurd amount of blood. When it comes to the exploitation of violence and gore, however, Rodriguez knows his audience better than anyone, and comes out with another wildly entertaining thrill ride that assaults the senses from start to finish. As if to justify the use of the name ""Grindhouse,"" Rodriguez ages the look of the film in post-production and removes a reel of footage to create a forced nostalgia, but PLANET TERROR is simply too large to ever truly fit in with its peers. The real Grindhouse experience would have placed both filmmakers under the same constraints of time and money as their predecessors, but where would be the fun in that? Regardless, gore fans are sure to enjoy PLANET TERROR in all of its head-splitting, gut-spilling splendor.

2919843,5,B000UAE7O0,"It's a pity that Quentin Tarantino's/Robert Rodriguez's tribute to Grindhouse films didn't get the respect it deserves when it was first released. Filled with faux coming attractions (2 of them, Machete and Hobo With A Shotgun, would eventually be real films), with a double feature, the 2nd being Tarantino's Death Proof. Rodriguez's contribution, Planet Terror, is the superior one.

Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan, who does a great dance in the opening credits)picks the wrong time to quit her job and leave town: it becomes overrun by zombies thanks to ""Planet Terror,"" which is a bio-nerve gas. Seems that the military (Led by Bruce Willis, who is just all kinds of cool) needed it for personal reasons (I don't wanna spoil the storyline, but a line about Bin Laden seems weird considering), but a greedy scientist (Naveen Andrews) has other plans and accidently unleashes it. Pretty soon a group of survivors, including Dakota (Marley Shelton) whose all shades of crazy Dr. hubby (Josh Brolin) doesn't take kindly to her leaving him for her girlfriend (Black Eyed Peas's Fergie). Led by El Way (Freddy Rodrguez), they have to escape the zombie stampede.

It's an INCREDIBLY GORY FILM!

But that's what Grindhouse is about and kudos to Rodriguez for knowing this. It even has a ""reel missing"" scene that happens at the most inappropriate time, and the result is just fantastic.

Now, there's nothing wrong with that and it doesn't mean that I don't love PT, as I do, but that's not what a ""grindhouse"" movie is supposed to be which is transgressive. Sure, Planet Terror has lot of gore and action but it truly doesn't plumb the depths of depravity like Crank 2: High Voltage which, IMHO, is a TRUE modern day exploitation masterpiece.

2919850,5,B000UAE7O0,"Despite the homogeneous nature of cinema, I keep going to the movie theater. Largely, it's because of dudes like Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Taratino, both of whom go their own way and offer up something that's so distinctively theirs that their names have become name brands for a certain type of film. When they collaborated on GRINDHOUSE, I knew it was gonna be something outrageous and offbeat, something decidedly unhomogeneous. With fanboy nudges and winks galore, these two maverick directors take us back to 1970s shlock with their gleefully offensive homage. In its sheer excess and blatantly hokey sensibilities, their efforts pull no punches. The audience is treated to crass, old school sensationalism, incidental nudity, fake-looking geysers of blood, and rampant and visceral disembowelment. I loved the hell out of it. In their simulation of that grungy sensation one feels when in them cruddy, shady theaters of old, Rodriguez and Tarantino willfully insert scratches on the print, projector miscues, sound goofs, and bad dubbing. We even have title cards apologizing for missing reels, which occur in the most inconvenient of times. My neighbor, who is old as dirt and had also frequented this film, remarked that that exactly was what it was like when he attended those low-rent, B-movie playhouses of yesteryear. I realize that this DVD only has PLANET TERROR, but I'm stubborn enough to not split the two films. I'll be mentioning both as watching them back-to-back in the theater enriched my original viewing experience. The double-feature bill trots out Rodriguez's PLANET TERROR and Tarantino's DEATH PROOF. Let's start with PLANET TERROR or, as I like to call it, Rodriguez's cheesily apocalyptic PLANET TERROR.

THE film title alone is reminiscent of many of those old time, sci-fi/horror B-movies. The plot centers around a mass zombie attack. We witness humanity's last stand as embodied by a one-legged go-go dancer (played with jaded brusqueness by Rose McGowan), her inexplicably lethal boyfriend (Freddie Rodriguez), an adulterous, needles-touting nurse, and a few others. It's a cup overflowing with campy dialogue and over-the-top, hilariously staged horror and action sequences. It also offers up a print that is marvelously grimy and grainy, and Rodriguez himself comes up with a pretty effective John Carpenter-like synthetic score which helps to drive the storyline. By the way, creature make-up artist Tom Savini gets a bit part here as he plays a digit-less deputy, while Naveen Andrews is great fun to watch as a testic1es-collecting bio-engineer. Fun, fun, fun.

The second billing is Tarantino's very talky DEATH PROOF, which is a callback to films such as VANISHING POINT, DIRTY MARY, CRAZY LARRY, and the original GONE IN 60 SECONDS (all of which are referenced in this flick). And, if anyone's seen the 1965 flick FASTER, PUSSYCAT! KILL! KILL! then DEATH PROOF will strike a certain familiarity. Kurt Russell does a deliciously villainous turn as the scarred Stuntman Mike who applies his death-proofed vehicle to do away with gorgeous females. But he makes the worst mistake of his life when he picks on fellow stuntperson Zoe Bell (who doubled for Uma Thurman in KILL BILL and who, here, plays herself).

With respect to the very natural Zoe Bell and her awesome ship's mast stunt, to me, the one to watch is Sydney Poitier (yes, it's his daughter) who plays the casually sexy Jungle Julia, she of the ravishing feet. Meanwhile, Rosario Dawson again can't help but sizzle on screen, while the very pouty-lipped Vanessa Ferlito... pouts her lips. If you're into extended dialogue which bears that distinctive Tarantino flourish, then the first half of this film is right up your alley because it's all significantly verbal and catered to the gentler sex - ""gentler"" being qualified here in that f-bombs are dropped with relished abandon. However, if you're an action fan, just wait 'til the second half because, then, Tarantino not only pulls out the stop signs, he smashes you in the mouth with 'em.

I have to mention the quartet of coming attraction trailers which ran in the theater. They ranged from the hilarious (MACHETE - ""He just f***ed with the wrong Mexican!"") to cliched shlock (DON'T and WEREWOLF WOMEN OF THE SS) to vaguely disturbing (I don't even want to know what was going on in Eli Roth's THANKSGIVING). MACHETE's faux trailer was so outrageous that it inspired an actual motion picture. There's also an ad for some kind of Tex-Mex restaurant with dubious shots of its menu samples, which made me queasy just looking at 'em.

Rodriguez and Tarantino, in their celebation of exploitation films, inject GRINDHOUSE with their exuberance and subversive humor and their love for shlocky cinema. By doing so, they elevate this film tiers above the basement genre of their intended tribute. Their gifts for crafting cinematic icons are again on display as Cherry Darling, Stuntman Mike, and Zoe Bell -  la the Bride or El Mariachi - have become film cult figures. At three hours long, yeah, my bum did fall asleep, but it's a small price to pay to gain admittance into blissfully trashy paradise.",1331769600,,5155,5.101895734597156

2919853,5,B000UAE7O0,"This is an over the top thrill ride, that doesn't pull punches. This was one of the two movies featured in the Grindhouse feature that played in theaters. This IMO is the better movie of the two, and it doesn't have huge gaps of slowness as Death Proof did. In the theaters Grindhouse played this and Death Proof one after another, but has enough special features to make it a separate movie.

The story is pretty decent, but basic. This is a movie about over the top action and kills, and the story takes a second place. That doesn't mean it isn't entertaining, just shorter. It fits well into the movie itself, and is pretty cool. Even with all this action going on, it actually allows the characters to develop, which is kind of rare in this type of movie.

The action is where the movie really shines, the explosions and kills are really nice and fluid, and very few movies have made me cringe like this one did. It has some big actors in this movie, which just add to the greatness of it.

The way they filmed was to make it low budget. They altered the film to make it seem like it is scratched up and degrading, but it adds to this movie, not becoming an annoyance. You can also see some stuff they left in (Like a crane in the background), which adds to the low budget feel of the movie, without taking you out the experience.
The music and sound effects in this movie are well done. The music just adds to the movie and feels like it's meant to be there. The gun sound effects, impacts, and the gore noises are believable. The sound just adds to great experience this movie brings.

The special features are really nice, including a second disk for most of them. The commentary is entertaining, and its cool to hear the director talk about how he made it seem more degraded and what not. They also included a audience track, which includes the recording of the audience reactions in a full theater. This may sound like it would take away from the movie, but it really makes you feel like you're in a theater, and I wish more movies added something like this. The rest of the features are just your typical behind the scenes, and run about 20-40 minutes total.

Overall this is one of my favorite gore movies. It has a good story, humor, and a ton of gore in it. I recommend buying it.

2919856,4,B000UAE7O0,"You know Hollywood has probably gone too far when film-makers consciously set out to make bad films. Or at least ""so-bad-it's-good"" films.

In this case action director Robert Rodriguez of Sin City and Desperado fame and Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction) sought to replicate the whole ""grindhouse"" cinema effect with a movie called... drum roll please... Grindhouse.

Grindhouses were cheap cinemas in the 1970s which showed B-rate exploitation flicks all day long -- usually in the form of double bills.

Grindhouse (the movie) consisted of a ""double bill"" of two movies, namely Death Proof and Planet Terror. The cinema prints of both movies were deliberately ""aged"" with scratches, faded colors and so forth to replicate the whole watching a battered print at a grindhouse cinema effect. Planet Terror actually has a faux trailer before the movie itself starts (it is quite funny and very reminiscent of those 1970's action flicks) for a fictional movie titled Machete.

It even has a deliberately ""missing reel,"" letting the audience fill in the dots between scenes themselves. The DVD, by the way, goes one step further: you can select an audio track that replicates the cinema experience - you can hear an audience jeering and a guy eating pop corn in the seat next to you.

Death Proof starred Kurt Russell as a serial killer who drives a 1970s muscle car and targeted young women -- that is, until a group of them fights back.

In Planet Terror -- Rodriguez's flick -- cannibalistic zombies overrun a small town when a top secret virus is set loose at the nearby military base. The gore and violence is way over the top with some scenes directly stealing from movies such as The Thing, Evil Dead and Total Recall.

The most notable image from the movie is of a sexy Rose McGowan as an amputee with a machine gun as a prosthetic. Sensitive viewers should take care to avoid it. It stars several Rodriguez regulars and Bruce Willis in a small cameo. Watching it is like watching some forgotten straight-to-video effort from the early 1980's --  Highly stylized and reminiscent of B-movies from that era, the color palettes are often a sickly green with a dated synth music score (of the sort Carpenter's films were noted for) on the soundtrack.  Its like watching a movie you have never seen before, but feeling as if you had, but can't remember when.

Cinema audiences however never got the joke as the whole ""grindhouse"" experience was as alien to today's young teenaged audiences that frequent today's multiplexes as were the concept of a drive-in.

There were many incidents of audience members not realizing that the movie consisted of a double bill and leaving the cinemas before the second feature started. Cinema owners weren't too happy at the film's long running time either and didn't go to any trouble to keep the movie running when the film proved to be a box office disappointment.

For the non-US. market (as well as the DVD release) it was thus decided to market and release the two movies separately. Thus with padded running times Death Proof and now Planet Terror are released as separate movies. All that remains of the whole ""grindhouse"" title is the ""Grindhouse presents"" moniker.

Back when Grindhouse was released as one feature in the cinemas director Tarantino remarked on the film's odd concept that audiences were desperate for something fresh, new and different. It would seems that he was wrong as Grindhouse proved to be a major box office disappointment.  Or was he?  Perhaps this was a film that proved to be too creative for its target audience, in this day and age of high tech video games, and instant gratification movies that have to 'dumb themselves down' so audiences 'get it'.  I think this was a film that the target audience needed to be kids - if not teens back in the late sixties, early seventies to appreciate what had just been viewed.

THE DISC: The movie plus audio commentaries are to be found on the first disc. As stated previously, the film print has been deliberately aged to look much older than it is with all kinds of scratches, splotches, color fades and the like.

The second disc is filled with behind-the-scenes making of featurettes and interviews with the various actors and creative people involved. Unfortunately no time is spent on explaining the whole ""grindhouse"" phenomenon and inspiration to any newbies. But it is interesting -- and ironic! -- to see how 2000's high-tech computer technology is used to replicate a low-tech early 1980's B-grade look and feel to the movie.

RECOMMENDATION: Worth a look-see, particularly if you miss those genuine early 1980's B-grade straight-to-video efforts from that era's home video boom, and want to take a trip back to a time when movies were what they were - enjoyable, smart, and full of effort.",1320364800,7,4814,4.877450980392157

2919871,4,B000UAE7O0,"One thing this whole grindhouse thing forgot is that when I buy real grindhouse movies on dvd I want them to find the best print available. For instance 'death carries a cane' from 1971 looks as scratched up as they these were made to look and then someone put out with a great print remastered in austria. I ditched my scratched up one and bought the newer one.  Why?  because films don't start out that way. And when I saw grindhouse movies at the drive in or a cheap theater back when they  didn't start out trashed often. They wore them down sure but I would go to them when they first came out.  However the spirit of those 70's and 80's grinders is alive in the movies themselves for sure and for that I love them. I could have done without the scratches and I was grateful to get the scratchfree nagative print , it's so much better than the scratched up one although the machete trailer is not on that option it's still on the other regular option so you can laugh at that one still. Of course low budget gh stuff is unintentially funny and this movie captures the whole experience completely. Low budget horror is like this no film critic would ever give most horror more than a few stars so I put them in their own five star ratings how good is a low budget film in regards to others of it's type?  Anyways this movie is alot of fun and laced with humour of purpose whereas most gh was dead on serious (but funny sometimes because it's so over the top)  unlike lets say giallo movies which is like gh but more slasher and was huge during the 70's too. Anyways this blu ray version shines and I am glad I got it and if you are a fan of gh get it. Or even if you look down on gh films get it because it's wild and funny and could fit right in with any drive in movie of that lost era.

2919882,3,B000UAE7O0,"Robert Rodriguez (""El Mariachi,"" ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"") and Quentin Tarantino (do I need to list references?) have famously teamed up on a number of projects (""Desperado,"" ""Sin City"").  While these two cinemaphiles always appear to have a blast making their movies, the ""Grindhouse"" project may be the paragon of their mad-cap filmmaking self-indulgence.

""Grindhouse"" was a double-feature in which RR and QT each provided a flick designed to be a homage to the low-budget horror/exploitation films of the 60s and 70s.  ""Planet Terror"" is RR's entry, although QT makes quite an impression in an extended cameo as a deranged military nutcase.  QT's half was ""Death Proof,"" which I won't review here, but it's definitely of a piece with ""Planet Terror.""

Zombie films are seemingly as popular now as ever, so RR's spoof/tribute is timely.  The flick opens with a hilarious mock trailer for ""Machete,"" an X-rated revenge flick.  The film quality of the trailer is terrible - RR fakes wear-and-tear on the film and includes skips and flaws in the soundtrack as a tribute to the grindhouse experience.  This works fine in the trailer, but as it continues into the feature film, it gets more than a little annoying after 60 minutes.

""Planet Terror"" opens up with a zombie outbreak in Texas, thanks to military hijinx led by Lt. Muldoon (Bruce Willis) for reasons unknown.  Soon zombies are tearing across the countryside, rending the innocent and not-so-innocent limb from limb.  Unfortunately, ""Planet Terror"" is aiming more for humor and gross-outs rather than genuine scares, so be prepared to wince rather than cringe.  Some of the jokes really work, such as several close-ups of the ""humps"" of Black Eyed Peas singer/ornament Fergie, just before the zombies tear her humps apart.  There's also a clever ""Missing Reel,"" alert, with apologies from theater management, just when a love scene between stripper Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan) and Wray (Freddie Rodgriguez) gets its most ""exploitative.""

Ultimately, this is not a good horror movie in that it will not create any genuine terror, a la the original ""Halloween,"" ""Nightmare on Elm Street,"" or even ""Dawn of the Dead.""  But it must be said that there are two types of horror movies, and this is the second type - the kind that goes for dark humor, ridiculiously-sensational death scenes, and blood by the barrelful.  That kind of horror movie doesn't appeal to me all that much, truth be told, but if that's your game I expect ""Planet Terror"" will find its way to the top of your DVD stack pretty quickly.

For what it is, I cannot imagine a movie doing a better job of hitting its target than ""Planet Terror.""  It is a tribute to bad taste and bad movies - and for what it is, almost as much fun as RR and QT had making it.",1264982400,11,2786,4.841772151898734
2919883,5,B000UAE7O0,"After seeing Grindhouse in the theaters, it became an instant favorite of mine. I've gone through a few DVDs so far (US DVD and Japanese 8-disc set) before getting the blu-ray - I have to say there definitely is an upgrade here (despite the old/torn up/dragged through the dirt look of the film). I'll start off by saying that it looks exactly as it was intended to look (and I hate it whenever people say that, as it usually means ""It doesn't look that good, but it's not supposed to, so I give it 5 stars"") - there is a significant increase in the sharpness of the film, but the blu-ray also includes an exclusive version of the film without the ""grindhouse look"" - a nice clean print if you ever just want to sit down and watch it without all of the damage (a very cool extra, even if just to check out). Overall the video is a significant jump from the DVD Release and looks very nice. Great audio track to go along with the video - definitely a fun action/horror movie to sit back and crank up the volume to. All extras from the DVD release are carried over and round out the package nicely (the only new extra being the scratch-free version mentioned above)

For anyone who has seen Grindhouse in theaters, it's important to note that this is only the Planet Terror portion of the film - it has been extended (almost half an hour longer) - this may be a good or bad thing based on which version you like. I personally like both versions (extended individual versions and the double-feature) for different reasons - currently, the double-feature isn't available on DVD or Blu Ray in the US, so there aren't many options.

What could have made it better? Picture in picture track and all of the theatrical trailers on the disc (currently the disc only has Machete on it).

If you don't have it on any format, I highly recommend it. It's a nice zombie/action movie - don't expect too many scares, but if you want to sit back and have a fun time, this is the perfect movie. If you own it on DVD, I still recommend the upgrade to the Blu Ray for the extra feature (scratch-free version) and the significant A/V upgrade.",1264204800,14,2120,4.403061224489796

*Spoilers*

If there's one thing I like more than zombie movies, it's parodies of zombie movies. ""Planet Terror"" delivers in a huge way, by spoofing just about everything you could hope for.

Just because this is a hilarious parody/comedy doesn't mean it's for kids, though. There's a lot of disturbing material here, often more disturbing because it's humans behaving badly, rather than simply zombies doing what zombies do. In one of the most horrific cinema scenes I've ever scene, a young boy shoots himself because he is too young to responsibly handle a gun (or he doesn't feel capable of being saddled with the instruction to kill anyone who approaches - even his abusive father). In another scene, an attempted rape comes to a disturbing halt due to the inability of the would-be rapist to maintain...structural integrity of his melting genitals. This isn't exactly light-viewing we're talking about.

Yet as a deconstruction of the genre, ""Planet Terror"" is superb. Every trick in the director's book is used with hilarious effect, including a false ""missing film"" / ""intermission"" during which all the introductory misunderstandings and usual ""coming to grips with the situation"" material all occurs without the audience being privy to the material. This is a particularly nice touch, in my opinion, since the ""let's face it - they're zombies"" speech really has nothing new to contribute at this point anymore.

If there is a downside to this movie, it is that Rose McGowan receives her leg-weaponry far later in the film than previews would have viewers believe - but every second afterwards is golden, climaxing in a truly hilarious ending that will have all zombie fans rolling on the floor laughing. If you like zombie movies, and like making light of them, ""Planet Terror"" is for you.

2919887,4,B000UAE7O0,"I'll be honest, there are over 200 other reviews in this movie - what can I add? I'm only reviewing this movie because I'm trying to manipulate/influence Amazon's methods of selecting items for recommendations and for Gold Box offers.

Having said that, if you know what Grindhouse is and/or you know, in general, what type of movie this is, you will not be disappointed. This was released in conjunction with Tarantino's ""Death Proof"". Planet Terror has, by far, more over-the-top gore and violence. Therefore (to me), it's loads more fun!

This is not a ground-breaking, genre-influencing movie. The stunts aren't super spectacular. The story isn't one you haven't seen before (in general). There are no big plot twists - it's just a straight-forward, deformed-mutant, apocalyptic survival action movie...and it's solidly pulled-off.

Basically, ""Planet Terror"" is a fun 90 minutes of cinematic diversion. To me, that equals ""I like it""...and, to Amazon, the equals 4-stars.",1260316800,4,976,5.324675324675325

This was the first half of the Grindhouse double feature when it was originally released along with its counter part, Quitin Tarrantino's Deathproof.  Made to look like a grainy 1970's horror, you would think a bluray version would be obsolete, but you would be wrong!  The Blu Ray version comes with an option to watch the movie with or without the grainy 1970s film looking effect.  This results in a crisp clean 1080P looking Planet Terror, or a choppy, grainy 1970s feeling Planet Terror.  In my opinion the film is WAY more enjoyable in crisp clean 1080P, and you can see and appreciate the cheesy gore and explosions in a more detailed way. So if you like horror, like good lookin girls, and like Bruce Willis, and have a Blu Ray Player, definately pick this one up.  Oh, and watch for Quintin Tarrantinos guest appearance!

That's the bizarre plot of PLANET TERROR, writer/director Robert Rodriguez's homage to the blood-spattered, beaten-up horror movies of the 1970s.  This was originally part of the double-feature presentation ""Grindhouse"" along with Quentin Tarantino's DEATH PROOF, and whilst both movies play well as a double feature, you can easily enjoy PLANET TERROR as a stand-alone movie experience.

Rose McGowan is a natural fit for the role of Cherry; and it's a complete mystery--to this reviewer at least--why it's taken her so long to be the leading lady of an action/horror film; she's perfect!  Rodriguez's script is totally tongue-in-cheek with lots of fun references and cliches for the veteran horror experts.

Co-starring Bruce Willis, Tom Savini, Quentin Tarantino and Josh Brolin this is an electrifying and funny Sci-fi horror action packed rollercoaster ride of a film. Writer-director-producer Robert Rodriguez (""Sin City"", ""Desperado"", ""El Mariachi"" and ""From Dusk Till Dawn"") with producer and co-star Quentin Tarantino have conjured up the best of the two stories on 2007's experimental cinematic flick ""Grindhouse"". It's got lots of great performances including some 70's 16mm style grainy filming including a brief missing reel part to make it seem like the audience is in a grindhouse theater, i also love how the heroine in this movie is very sexy yet original as she's like no other heroine to hit film before yet she kicks ace.

2919899,4,B000UAE7O0,"Directors Robert Rodriguez and close friend Quentin Tarentino, conceived `Grindhouse' as a theatrical double feature salute to 70's exploitation cinema, featuring Rodriguez's film Planet Terror, and Tarentino's Death Proof.

Planet Terror is a fun, and campy romp, that even with some significant gaps in the plot, stays pretty much on track up to its explosive conclusion.  It's a not unfamiliar story, where a chemical weapon produces horrific results, with a band of survivors battling to stay alive.

The strong cast is led by Rose McGowan who takes on the physically demanding role of Cherry.  Freddy Rodriguez is the mysterious Wray, a man with an assortment of deadly skills.  Michael Biehn, Josh Brolin, Marley Shelton, Naveen Andrews, Jeff Fahey, Tom Savini, and Michael Parks, all excel at playing some rather unusual characters.  Topping it off are appearances by Bruce Willis, and Mr. Tarentino himself, as dedicated military men on very different missions.

There is a wealth of information in Rodriguez's commentary track, and the bonus materials on Disc 2.  John Carpenter is repeatedly mentioned as an influence.  Casting was done with a minimal script, and Rodriguez then finished the screenplay, writing with the actors that he had cast in mind.  The decision to make Cherry a dancer, and open the film boldly with her performing on stage, is a character embellishment that many will appreciate, as Ms. McGowan certainly has the moves down.  The reasons for using the `missing reel' ploy are explained, and though it jumps the action to the middle of a firefight, whether it makes for a `better' story is open to discussion.  The feature '10 Minute Film School' reveals how many of the special effects were accomplished.  Other featurettes highlight the cast, including some unlikely members from Rodriguez's real life.  It's not mentioned, but when Cherry has a minigun attached to her leg, it appears that more of her real leg remains than was previously shown.

The film was shortened to make it more suitable for the theatrical release.  This expanded version contains some additional scenes that fill in a few of the gaps.  Some may feel that an incompletely developed story, detracts a bit from the film's luster, while for others it may not be an issue.  Either way, Planet Terror gets mostly positive marks as a fun film, with some cool action scenes, and the machine gun legged Cherry is hard to forget.",1242432000,,2430,5.062814070351759

Growing up on TNT's MONSTER VISION with Joe Bob Briggs and USA's Up ALL Night with that Rhonda whats-her-face, I was treated to the worst B-movies and heavily edited for TV movies than you can shake a stick at and Planet Terror would truly fit the bill for either show.

Filled with hilariously ridiculous moments and buckets (literally gallons in cases when someone getting machine-gunned to death) of gore per foot of celluloid, and more of Rose McGowan than you ever dreamed seeing, this is one hell of a fun film. I laughed... and laughed... and come to think of it laughed some more at how authentically bad it was, right down to the warping film and missing reels. Even the joke trailers that could only be seen in theaters (though rumor has it they will be releasing the movie as it played in theaters sometime soon, fingers crossed) were downright ridiculously funny.

So if you're looking for a bad B-movie just for giggles, this is probably the best you'll find that it's in the bargain bin.",1241308800,,1095,4.697916666666667

Her character is portrayed as sexy, strong and a leader so Rose McGown has to be rated on her looks as well as her acting ability. She failed at both. Rose McGowan never pulled off the sexy character because she is neither all that sexy or attractive. In fact in some shots, she looks tired and way too old to wear leather mini skirts. Viewers can't tell the difference between her original wooden stick leg and her reed thin real one. Her face is concave (especially visible in the scene where 2 soldiers are about to rape her) and her googly eyes are not attractive. Rose McGowan did an awful acting job in this film in part because her body and spirit don't match the role she is playing and it doesn't help when the script is bad. Worse, this walking worthless piece of humanity named Cherry Darling has a daughter and passes her genes onto another generation,  I mention her LOOKS because her character is SUPPOSED TO BE SEXY.

2919904,3,B000UAE7O0,"The GRINDHOUSE experience, as portrayed in this double offering of PLANET TERROR and DEATH PROOF, stirs up more confusion than nostalgia.  The authentic clips introducing the fake Coming Attractions hits the mark perfectly!  WEREWOLF WOMEN OF THE S.S. is dead on.  The echoing, minimalist voice over for the THANKSGIVING trailer is perfect.

But the movies themselves end up being too schizo to really evoke the 1970s drive-in ""grindhouse"" experience.

First of all, you have an A-list production of special effects, photography, etc....but they added scratched film effects.  Both films appear to be in the present when bell-bottom pants, big porn moustaches and horrible 70's hair would've worked better than the scratched film effect.

And, really, most modern movies are this ""bad""...or worse.  Is PLANET TERROR really that different than the monthly zombie movies we're getting all the time?  The gore and the violence are as bloody and grotesque as anything else we're getting a steady diet of.  RESIDENT EVIL, 28 DAYS LATER, ""WHATEVER"" OF THE DEAD, etc.  I know the rifle attached to Rose McGowan's leg is supposed to be so over-the-top that it's funny...but aren't all the other modern movies this stupid that it doesn't seem so extreme?  It really didn't seem that out of place these days.

Still, PLANET TERROR is far more entertaining than DEATH PROOF, although the zombie thing has been (literally) done to death.  How about doing a parody of ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET THE DAWN OF THE DEAD?  Now there you'd have something that wouldn't look like everything else these days.

(And can Quentin Tarantino look any creepier in his cameos?  His role as ""The Rapist"" in PLANET TERROR was mercifully brief, but he just comes off as a creepy bartender in DEATH PROOF surrounded by sideshow freaks between shots of hot chicks and their feet.)",1236988800,,1843,5.049668874172186

The plot, in an extremely cliched nutshell, is that all hell breaks loose in a small southwestern town, when the local military loses control of a deadly virus that turns people into flesh-eating monsters covered in infected sores. A small group of survivors, including a GoGo dancer who's lost a leg to the undead, a mysterious mercenary, the battered wife of the local doctor, and the owner of the local barbeque, band together to fight off the ravening hoard.

Along the way one-liners are cracked, cars are blown up and enough blood is shed that the actors might as well have been given water-guns filled with fake blood and told to reinact the battle of Gettysburg.

Yes, I know, the Grindhouse double-feature didn't too so well in the theaters but maybe the public wasn't yet ready for such advance cinematographic material. Maybe it still isn't and maybe it will never be. I know that I will never get myself tired of anything Tarantino or Tarantino-related and a movie where Tarantino, if fact plays a part and it's supposed to be the B-movie to Quentin's 'Death Proof' is a Tarantino movie to me (sorry, Robert Rodriguez). Just for the fun of name-dropping, did you know that Fergie (yes THAT Fergie) ends up eaten here? That Bruce Willis falls flat on the floor, as it decomposes? That Carlos Gallardo (El Mariachi) plays the main gunslinger? That Robert Rodriguez kills (the character played by ) his own preschool son - his son plays a part where he ends up dead. That his real-life family doctor actually plays a doctor? There's so much to learn and talk about and it's all on second disk's extra but Rose McGowan absolutely steals the show. She played a relatively short part in Death Proof but her Planet Terror role is likely to be the role of her lifetime. She's simply perfect, sensational, stunningly beautiful and deadly accurate when it comes to shooting with that leg-mounted machine gun.

But, I wasn't planning to talk much about the movie itself. I only wanted to make some brief remarks about the Blu-ray edition of Planet Terror.

To my surprise, Planet Terror goes a lot farther than any of the previous Tarantino-related (yes, I know, it's Robert Rodriguez) Blu-ray releases in actually taking advantage of the Blu-ray technology. A lot farther than Death Proof, Kill Bill or Reservoir Dogs.

Disk one, has TWO versions of the movie. The 'scratched' original and, surprisingly (because Death Proof lacks it) a mostly 'clean' copy. In addition to the 'regular' and the traditional 'commentary' sound track it's possible to select the 'audience reaction track' (available on the 'scratched' version only. Interestingly, the 'clean' version does not include the 'Machete Man' introduction.

The sound track is Dolby TrueHD or Dolby 5.1 in English and it is so on both the 'regular' and the 'audience reaction' tracks. French and Spanish tracks are also available in Dolby 5.1 only. Subtitles are English or Spanish but not in French.

As it is the case with Death Proof, BD Live is one of the options listed as a 'special feature' but, when selected, you are told to that it is not available at this time and to 'check back later'.

The second disk is full of rather interesting featurettes. There's an 11 minute one titled '10-minute film school' where Robert Rodriguez talks about the making of the movie, there are shorts on 'the gals' and the 'boys', extras on the special effects, trailers, etc., etc., etc. and, to my surprise, the quality of extras is quite decent.

Briefly: it goes a long way but not 'all the way' toward taking advantage of Blu-ray, some of the options and features implementation are confusing (see above), for reasons impossible to comprehend it claims to have BD Live but it does not, the second disk, full of extras is actually worth watching.

The whole thing amounted to a great theatrical experience - one that hasn't been able to be replicated on video - here in the US at least.

So we are left with two seperate releases.  Planet Terror fares better on its own.  Even though its left without its partner in crime, its still an homage to the old Grindhouse flicks.  It exploits the over top horror, stylized shots, and campiness of those films.  It does one better by having a higher quality and because unlike those films, which mustered up cheap shots in order to get tickets sold, the creator is out to deliver a fun film.  Rose Macgowan gets a gun for a leg!  Freddy Rodriguez is really good with guns!  And just wait til you see what happens to special effects expert Tom Savini!

Still, on its own, there are some issues.  Notably, the film is almost too long.  The ""exteneded and unrated"" notification is to be taken almost as a warning.  A lot of the so called ""unrated"" scenes, were cut for pacing.  They don't add anything really.  A sad testament to this was Robert Rodriguez's commentary, as he states several times that scenes were cut for good reasons.  Still, this is a fun film.  However, if you can't wait for the inevitable proper cut in the US on DVD, have some dinero and a multiregion DVD player, Grindhouse can be experienced properly via the 6 disc editon available at Amazon's Japanese site.",1234051200,,1582,4.494736842105263
2919914,1,B000UAE7O0,"I never knew what a grindhouse movie was.  I could have lived my whole life not knowing and not have suffered a bit.

To create an ""homage"" to this degenerate genre is worse than the genre itself.  Rumor has it that the fake trailer will be made into a movie.  Please don't.  Put the money to some good use, like feeding starving children, and teaching people how to healthily parent.  I will admit that Fahey looked fine in that fake trailer, but that is not a reason to make another piece of,... heck,... I am running out of derogatory terms.

So many people have written glowing reviews of this gorefest.  Who are these people?  What kind of pea-brained cretins salivate over blood and guts?  Please don't tell me they are the ones who will be running this country eventually (or is it now?).  Is Obama into these things?

I can see them:  lots of beer and/or pot, rotting teeth, limited income potential, small vocabulary, poor hygiene, narrow lives due to limits imposed by intelligence.  All this does is sadden me that these people must have been nurtured to ""maturity"" in a vile stewpot devoid of values, love, and genuine nurturing.  Viewing this garbage is their attempt to stimulate feeling, any kind of feeling, other than emptiness.

What else could it possibly be?

So, if I find these movies so objectionable, why did I watch and why am I bothering to write a review?  Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that's why.  My noble reason.

My shallow reason?  I came across Jeff Fahey in a different instance, hadn't seen him since The Lawnmower Man, and wanted to see how he was holding up. Now I know.  Still in B Movie Hell, even though he could perform roles with much better quality.  Why, why, did he choose to stay in this farce of a genre?  Someone please 'splain it to me.

2919918,4,B000UAE7O0,"I'll forgo a movie review since there's an abundance of them online and there's a good chance you've already seen it. Here's a review of the Blu Ray:

Video: 4/5

This is a grindhouse experience, so the film was given a rough, blemished appearance. Now despite this rough look, the video is still quite sharp and pleasant to see. Grain appearance is just right, not overdone like Spider Man or Weeds 1st Season on Blu Ray. Now if the rough look isn't for you, don't worry: there's a ""scratch free"" version included which also looks quite nice. I won't lie: although I enjoy this movie, I was worried the scratches/rough look was going to equal nasty picture. But really, it was a pleasant surprise.

Audio: 4.5/5

The audio options include English TrueHD 5.1; Dolby 5.1 English, French and Spanish; Dolby 5.1 English (crowd reaction track)

The high def audio is just as thundering as the surround track found on the DVD release. The surround effects do their job well enough, are immersive as best as an action movie may offer. Bullets whiz by and the flame sounds surround, but the subtle ambiance that makes you look over your shoulder is missing. Nevertheless, the audio is not bad. The crowd reaction track is also a welcome inclusion and something I enjoyed on the DVD release. Perhaps not for everyone, but it makes you feel like you're in the theater again.

Conclusion: If you have the DVD, I'm sure watching it upconverted isn't going to be a huge jump in quality for you. However, if you wish for a scratch free version or a bump in audio, that is what the Blu Ray offers, so give it a rent and see if it's for you.",1230076800,15,1626,4.532423208191126

The first film of his and Quentin Tarantino's Grindhouse double feature , Robert Rodriguez's tribute to the expolitation films - zombie genre with this film - is one hell of an R rated fun ride . And like most of his movies , it's all about having fun . Gore fun this time . And he delivers .Plot holes are still here , but it's supposed to be this way . That damaged film look is really great .

Good dvd extras like Robert Rodriguez's commentary and his always appreciated 10 Minute Film School .

Maybe an arm (a-lah Army Of Darkness, but not a chainsaw), but a leg is just something I have a hard time with. Maybe it's because I'm a leg man and have a hard time staring at a smokin' chick with a machine gun for a leg.

2919921,4,B000UAE7O0,"There is too much bitterness about Grindhouse. We only have ourselves to blame. The Weinsteins' spent 67 million on it. It made $25 million, worldwide. That's that, people didn't come out. In the end, it hemorrhaged cash. Don't forget the ads. I wonder what that cost?

The Weinsteins messed up. The fall was a better time. Who wants to see horror, in the spring? Many felt, with 300's success, that Grindhouse was rearing for a repeat. Except, they forgot something; comic fans drove it. 300 was driven by young fans. Fans of Frank Miller and comics, not movies; that's the secret, ..this was different. Comic fans came and came. Bringing more and more, with them everytime, Grindhouse was another animal. Its strength was other Tarantinos. Film geeks would have to come out in force.

Unfortunately, the Weinsteins' treated it, the same. Focusing on young fans, the ads played it, as 300. Freddy Rodriguez was Gerald Butler. Instead of hordes, there were zombies. Explosions, instead of slashing; all with ""cool"" music in the background; and no mention of its length; and that's the point. It didn't get people to go. The wrong people went, so ""no one"" did.

Those who went were horrified. Some loved it. Fake trailers, missing reels, the film was massive. Three hours, with an intermission, and that... affected everything. People didn't come back. I can't really blame them. They were expecting 300. But, for a film like Grindhouse to work, you have to have repeat business. There is no other way.

Without the right audience, the film died. Like Lethal Weapon and Shawshank Redemption, Grindhouse will find its place, at home. People will discover it. And they'll watch it, over and over. And, really, that's all you could ask.

As for the full version, ... the film tanked. The double feature was a gamble. In the end, ""no one"" came. The Weinsteins lost money. Obviously, the format didn't work. So, they released the films, separately. In longer, more complete versions.., this worked. The films are more themselves, and less butchered. What's missing? Three trailers, that's it. What's the big deal? This smells like spilt milk.

The film lost money. We didn't show up. We have no one to blame, but us. Not the Weinsteins.

As for ""the executive's corporate greed"", are you ignorant? The Weinsteins are to trying to recoup, their loss. It took home video, to right that ship. And I wander, if they broke even. ..There's nothing wrong, with making money. If the Weinsteins go under, so do many others. It's called economics. Look it up.

2919926,5,B000UAE7O0,"Admittedly, Quentin Tarantino can be irritating. He's a weak-jawed geek who believes his own press clippings (and thinks he's tough guy because he makes action flicks). And he's also a screamer - an actor who can't stop shouting on screen.

But I've never met him, so maybe I'm being presumptive.

Because whether Tarantino is a jackass doesn't matter. The man makes dynamite movies - from ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992) to ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994). He makes those guilty pleasure flicks filled with great lines, fast action, and superb acting. As a director he yanks the gusto out of his actors. John Travolta should send him Christmas cards for saving his career.

That brings us to ""Grindhouse"" (2007).

All the credit can't go to Tarantino, of course, as he co-directed ""Grindhouse"" with the talented Robert Rodriguez. But the movie is an achievement of writing, directing, and acting.

The concept is brilliant - a throwback to the 1970s drive-in B-movies (called grindhouses in the industry). The movie meshes two exploitation classics: a serial killer revenge flick and a zombie splatter fest. Sprinkle in some pop references and ironic dialog with a dash of dark humor and you've got a roller coaster ride of a movie.

The movie looks like a film pulled out of a rusty canister - complete with missing reels and burnt celluloid. There are fake trailers for movies with names like ""Machete"" and ""Werewolf Women of the SS.""

But the movie flopped. It brought in a meager $25 million and cost more than double that to make. There was just too much going on in ""Grindhouse."" For 191 minutes there were the two movies, the trailers, and an intermission. It was a glorious effort - but it was just asking too much of the viewer.

But all that's been fixed with the DVD release of Tarantino's ""Death Proof"" and Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror."" Rather than sawed-off versions - we get full length features. Both movies are better off longer.

Death Proof

""Death Proof"" is the best Kurt Russell movie in long time - one where he gets his Snake Plisskin mojo back. He plays Stuntman Mike, a charming viper of a misogynist serial killer. Stuntman Mike - gored face and all - has a black ""death proof"" car with a cage inside it. He likes to put women in the cage and then drive really fast, braking, and cornering until he's basically turned his female passengers into hamburger.

This snippet of dialog sings:

  Mike: Well, Pam, which way are you going, left or right?
  Pam: Right.
  Mike: Oh, that's too bad.
  Pam: Why?
  Mike: Because it was a 50-50 shot on whether you'd be going left or right. You see we're both going left. You could have just as easily been going left, too. And if that was the case, it would have been a while before you started getting scared. But since you're going the other way, I'm afraid you're going have to start getting scared - immediately.

Stuntman Mike then proceeds to give Pam a ride she'll never forget (or, in fact, survive). ""Death Proof"" is actually two movies. The first half is about how Stuntman Mike stalks, charms, and then murders a group of four female friends.

The next half he's up to his old tricks with another group of four women. But two of these women are Hollywood stunt drivers - and they know how to fight (and drive) back. The ending is worthy of any revenge flick in existence.

But what makes the film work? Character and dialog. Two things that were given short shift in the original version.

Planet Terror

""Planet Terror"" is Rodriguez's homage to the gore-infused horror movie. The plot is secondary (it has something to do with a chemical being unleashed and turning the innocent into flesh-eating zombies). There're lots and lots of blood - and black humor (Jeff Fahey as a barbeque chef is outrageous).

Rodriguez shines with the small moments - the love scene between the protagonists (Freddie Rodriguez and Rose McGowan) is a high in low-brow. McGowan's character has had her leg severed and a broom handle shoved into her stump as a replacement. Ridiculous camp at it's best.

Then there's Bruce Willis in a self-parody. There's Freddy Rodriguez mounting a mini-motor scooter as he zips down the highway firing bullets into the heads of zombies. There's Tarantino himself (shouting per usual) playing to type as a rapist thug.

But most of all there's energy. The throttle is open wide and ""Planet Terror"" doesn't stop.

So while ""Grindhouse"" had its challenges as one movie - do yourself a favor and get both these DVDs for a true grindhouse double feature.

2919935,5,B000UAE7O0,"Grindhouse was originally released in theatres as a nostalgic look at the matine style movies of the Grindhouse theatres. These movie theatres would usually display 1, 2 or even 3 movies in a row. The movies were relatively low budget in exchange for high levels of advertising. Both Tarrantino and Rodriguez have spoken of their love for the Grindhouse theatres as kids. They both set about to make two separate movies that would be shown in succession, but in between would feature commercials for further fictional movies. This, in their mind would create the same atmosphere that they experienced as kids. It didn't work and a lot of the time, after the first movie would end (Either Planet Terror or Death Proof) movie go'ers assumed that was it and would leave. Not knowing there is another movie to follow after the commercial breaks. Because of this failure, against their will both Rodriguez and Tarrantino decided to release the movies separately and the success grew from there. I've seen Tarrantino's Death Proof, and I must say I didn't really care for it. This is why we have Planet Terror. In case you don't have the attention span to follow an hour or so of dialogue, then at least you get this movie in which people get blown to pieces every couple of minutes. I am the latter and I absolutely loved this movie.

It had cheesy dialogue that, at times made no sense and had no place in the situation our heroes where presented with. The gore was reminiscent of my beloved classic sci-fi gross out flicks that, instead of using CGI endeavored to create the gore for real (not using actual body parts though). This made some of the craziness more genuine and in Planet Terror actually made my stomach turn.

In Texas, a gang leaded by the black market dealer Abby faces a group of renegade militaries leaded by Captain Muldoon in an abandoned military base. During their shootout, Abby shoots a recipient of biological weapon, releasing an experimental highly-contagious gas that turns humans to flesh-eating zombies. Meanwhile, in the local hospital, Dr. Block sees an epidemic with many patients with the same nasty symptoms. When the outbreak affects most of the local population, a group of people with immunity leaded by the mechanic Wray, Sheriff Hague, the stripper Cherry and the Dr. Dakota, fight to survive and become the last hope to save the world.

This was an awesome mind numbing movie that went at a mile a minute. It doesn't seek to be intelligent or even have a go at some random intelligent speeches. Be warned, this movie is stupid and watching it may make you a few points lower in your IQ. One thing I have to tell you is that it's really worth it as it's so much fun. I'm actually disappointed that Tarrantino's installment didn't really deliver for me.

2919936,5,B000UAE7O0,"""Planet Terror"" is one of the most unique films I've seen in quite a while. It's a sort of parody/ tribute to the drive-in/ exploitation movies of the 1970s. Now here's my Top Ten Reasons Why You Should Watch ""Planet Terror"":
1) It's brought to us by Robert Rodriguez, the same man that gave us ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", so you know this is gonna be something interesting, and especially well-made.
2) ...and, like ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", this movie starts off serious but is able to do a 180 about 40 minutes into it. This basically means that the pacing of this movie is good and time really flies, even though it's about an hour and forty minutes long.
3) There's plenty of odd characters, and while there isn't any real plot, all the characters contribute to the charm and appeal of this movie.
4) A reason you MUST watch this movie, a girl has a machine gun for a leg! She doesn't get it until the last, twenty minutes or so, but when she DOES get become our loveable Machine Gun Sally...WATCH OUT!!! This includes when she shoots the ground and flies thirty feet over a wall like a comic book superhero. That's a clip you will DEFINITELY wanna watch again.
5) Gore, gore, gore!!! This movie is packed with plenty of horror-related action, alongside LOTS of headshots and the red stuff flies like ducks flying south for the winter.
6) Tom Savini makes an appearance as a police officer, and it's always cool to see Tom land a spot in a cool movie.
7) The whole film even feels like a sort of '70s movie, if you forget the fact that it's a tribute to these types of movies, so we get the nostalgic feel and classic sorta setting.
8) All the actors do a very good job at playing their roles, so this breathes even more life into the film.
9) There are so many, ridiculous moments, like the guy that jumps around like a martial artist and rips zombies apart one after another after another!!! This movie is chock full of awesome moments and true novelty ideas that put a real twist on this type of movie.
and Reason Number 10:
10) This movie is a real treat because it doesn't follow the rulebook on what a horror/action/exploitation movie should be. Like ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" it is such a novelty item and SO COOL, it's a movie you just can't watch once. It's a fun-filled, action-packed, zombie-raging movie that YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE SERIOUSLY! Just kick back, grab a bottle of your favorite iced tea, and let the DVD play.

Well, if you made it this far into the review, I wanna say thanks!!! If you're looking for a fun, exciting, gory, and actually rather funny movie, ""Planet Terror"" is a newfound gem that's sure to withstand the test of time, and can almost be called this generation's ""From Dusk Till Dawn"".

I applaud the production, directing, casting, editing, and camera work. All went into making it look and feel older. The cast does a fine job with their parts and add to the illusion of an older B movie, but with some satire that let's us smile along with them as we know they aren't really serious when in the older movies they were funny unintentionally and they were serious about it. I really enjoyed the characters in this movie and it kept my interest the whole time. Well worth at least a rental and I think this one is a keeper and the price makes it a steal.

A zombie movie, with classy B movie actors who supply the type of performance you would expect from a major production that pays homage to many movies from the 1970's and 1980's. So long as you've got a reasonably strong stomach and you don't mind the slightly 1970's misogynist edge to the whole thing its really entertaining.

I was never a fan of Rodriguez until I saw Sin City, and this is almost as good as that.

Came out around the same time as resident evil and you know what the difference is between the two?  Resident Evil doesn't pretend to be clever, it got slated in the press (rightly so) its just a popcorn movie with no plot or purpose.  This film on the other hand will be guaranteed a certain sales and why?  Because it has Rodriguez on the front cover who did Sin City and most boxes has Tarantino's name on it front and back(Just to boost those sales a little more)

Well I for one am sick of seeing his name on every 3rd rate ""Sell to the University student crowd and the kids who want to look smart"" films that have come out ever since his God awful Reservoir Dogs (A film that lets face it is famous only for the ear slicing off scene) I remember watching that when it first came out in some art house cinema and everyone walked out saying ""What the hell was that cr**"" fast forward a couple of weeks and suddenly its a ""Cult film"" (Aside from its endless ripping off of other films) Pulp Fiction was the only decent film he ever made.  No matter how much he plugs Kill Bill if I wanted to watch a Japanese blood fest I would watch a Manga film or a John Woo film not some 3rd rate director rip off.

So whats this one about?  Small Texas town, virus gets let loose turning the locals into zombies with a blood lust.  Zombies go on rampage, small town cops, local thug, beautiful girl fight them off...er and so on.......

Stick in the obligatory Tarantino cameo (ala Desperado and numerous other of his tosh films and spin offs) have the usual characters, tough southerner, sleazy girl, useless cops, action actor (This time Bruce Willis rather that Travolta) and you have the plot.  Seen it before with every 70s shock horror film.  They may bill this as ""paying homage"" to the Genre but lets face it, its nothing of the sort its just another cash in.

Shoot out at the end of the film just makes this film frankly painful to watch.  Most of the directors of those 60s and 70s horror classics must be cringing when they watch rubbish like this.  45 minutes into this film and you really do just loose interest.  Good thing this did come out on DVD so quick as at least at home you can find something else to do.

2919971,5,B000UAE7O0,"Honestly, I really can't think of anything else to title it. It's just cool. Quite often, I am a little late catching up with some things that everyone else appears to have seen. The recent 'Grindhouse' movies is one example. I didn't think I would like them, had no real feeling for Robert Rodriguez, and I certainly wasn't going to sit in the theater for 3+ hours. But as these things usually end up going, I did see it, and I wished I had jumped on earlier like others. Look what I was missing!. ""Planet Terror"" is over the top and absurd in it's violence, gore, blood, and camp, and it's utterly brilliant.

Plot?. Here goes. Something weird is going on in this town. People are coming to the hospital with weird bites and gross break-outs all over their skin, and people are being turned into cannibalistic zombies out to destroy everyone. A gang of people, each with their own story and introduction, all get entangled with each other and try to stop the monsters and save themselves.

""Planet Terror"", modeled after the exploitation films of the 70's, is expertly done and crafted. The time worn film reels, the color, certain camera angles, it's just all wonderful. Director Rodriguez knows what he is doing and knew what he was going for. He got it. The look and style of the film is quite breathtaking. It appears that it was painstakingly done, and the effort is over the top cool. All the little touches, including the fake ""coming attractions"", were hilarious and welcomed. Anyone else really want to see these ""fake"" movies?. Danny Trejo in ""Machete""?. ""Thanksgiving""?. I'd be there. Elsewhere, the make-up, effects, and especially the gore, are all top notch. It is probably one of the goriest films I have seen in a very long time. Maybe the goriest I have ever seen. It is so cartoonish and absurd and in your face. Then again, it's supposed to be. Just total carnage.

Thankfully, Rodriguez assembled a wonderful cast to be able to pull all of this off. The movie is filled with wonderful character/cult performers like Michael Biehn, Tom Savini, Jeff Fahey, and Michael Parks(who I just recently discovered and think is one of the greats). Plus, you got Rose McGowan(sexier and cooler than ever), Freddy Rodriguez, Josh Brolin, and cameos by Bruce Willis and Quentin Tarantino(who still isn't much of an actor. Sorry Quentin). It isn't hard to imagine that all of these people just let it rip and had a ball doing this movie. It's great to see such a mish mash of personalities and talent. They all deliver their own special touches. And how cool is the image of McGowan with her gun leg?.

In the end, ""Planet Terror"" is an amazinginly fun, entertaining, brilliantly crafted film paying homage to the real thing of the 70's. I appreciated what Rodriguez and Tarantino were trying to do, and all the touches they put into it to make it like those movies they were paying tribute too. This movie is all over the place. It's wild, bloody, hysterical, campy, and just let's it rip for the fun of it. If I have any complaints it's that it felt like it was running a bit long in the tooth towards the end.

*Good, exciting, engaging story with lots of action.
*No shortage of violence and gore; fans of blood and guts should be satisfied with this.
*Some action scenes are downright awesome (like when Cherry uses her leg-gun to kill a bunch of zombies...).
*Characters are good.
*Dialogue is good.
*Music is great.

The Bad Things:
*This is definately the grossest movie I have ever seen.  Lots of gut-ripping, heads-exploding, brain-eating, torrents-of-blood, melting tallywackers, and other gross bits all over the place.
*Also lots of disturbing tidbits (but could also be good, because it makes the film edgy).
*Some campiness and plenty of parts that are very absurd (but this could be a good thing, because it's stylish and entertaining).
*All of the movie is made to look old on purpose (which I think is good, because it's adds some interesting effects and serves as homage to 70s films (and older ""Grindhouse"" films)).

Highly reccomended for anybody who likes blood and gore, zombie movies, or absurd movies (like ""Sin City"" or ""Shoot 'Em Up"").

There is a lot to like about Robert Rodriguez' new horror film which is just a usual run-of-the-chemical-factory zombie movie with a budget. Those who remember the zombie flicks of the 1980s, which didn't take themselves too seriously, were heavy on the splatter, and got a few laughs along with the high haemoglobin count, will be at home with Planet Terror. Those expecting something of the calibre of the Dawn of the Dead remake will not be so impressed.

The cast contains very interesting performances, bringing some dead actors and actresses back to life. Planet Terror plays homage to every movie that has had a trickle of blood in it. There are big nods to Peter Jackson (head splitting gore) and Sam Raimi (the hero is an amputee). It does manage to try and flesh out what could have been paper-thin characters. Even the scene of one brother spilling his barbeque recipe manages a touching moment in a film which thinks having the heroine launch herself into the air from machine-gun-leg-recoil doesn't challenge our fresh brains.

2919981,4,B000UAE7O0,"There's a good reason that the style of film-making from the 70's died out. For the most part, it was puerile crap!

Exploitation, racism, plot holes that you could fit the Death Star in, terrible acting, worse lines, special effects that would cause someone with lactose intolerance to suffer a major attack...

Hey, who am I kidding? It had its charm. Face the music, back then, people really didn't know much better. God, listen to me, I sound like it was in another century for the love of god, not only a couple of decades ago.

When you consider the more refined tastes of the movie going public today, movies done in that old style, well, it's laughable.

And now, who's kidding who here? You want crap that is as bad, if not worse than what was produced way back in the age of decadence, just go to your local video store right now and take a good long look at some of the titles that are sitting on the shelf.

Many of these titles try to pass themselves off as a serious movie, but don't kid yourself, they're as bad, if not worse, than many of the B rate movies that we saw all those years ago.

Back in the 70's, those types of movies were made very cheaply, and were pretty much mass produced for pure entertainment value.

Sort of like many of the movies you see that are direct to DVD today, especially ones that try to cash in on a major motion picture. A perfect example is this - the Transmorphers. A play on the title the Transfomers, which made an obscene amount of money in the theatres last summer.

I shouldn't judge, considering that I haven't seen this direct to DVD flick, but when you have a title like that, you know that the producers are simply trying to ride the coat-tails of a successful movie, hoping that the less informed members of the public will pick it up and watch it.

However, when you get a director like Tarantino, someone who absolutely loves that style of movie, and has gone out of his way to emulate it over the years, it's no wonder he's trying to revive that old style of film-making. Take his movie Deathproof as a perfect example.

So, consider that his friend and fellow director Robert Rodriguez have made movies now that fit that billing. Mr. Rodriguez made a downright terrible B rate movie. He didn't pull any strings making it. He even went out of his way to use terrible acting, worse dialogue, completely over the top effects.

And he got away with using familiar (Michael Biehn, Rose McGowan) and in one case a famous actor (Bruce Willis). Even Tarantino had a cameo in this film.

Was it terrible as I said? Damned straight!

The movie is pretty simple. A crazy, money obsessed bio-chemist (Naveen Andrews of Lost fame) is working with a rogue military unit, providing them with a dangerous chemical that they require.

The chemical gets loose, and suddenly this quiet little Texan town is hit with a plague of zombies.

You get the drift.

Again, it was terrible, but strangely enjoyable. The reason is that, as is the case with many of the movies that I've watched over the years, it was done this way on purpose. Mr. Rodriguez and the cast must have had a blast (once again, pun intended), making the movie.

It was totally over the top and it wasn't sorry in the least. If anything, it basked in the bygone glory (gory?) of the lost (and please, stay lost) 70's.

Nostalgia comes to mind. Nostalgic memories of sneaking out on my mom and going with my friends to the drive in on the weekends (when they could sneak me in, considering I was under-aged at the time) to see these terrible movies. It brought back many fond memories.

Taken in small doses, these movies are fun. But, I don't know if I could handle seeing these movies return full strength to the big screen. If the Grindhouse wants to get back into business, pump out these terrible but oddly enjoyable films for direct to video release.

And don't ever try to apologize, for trying to bring back the 70's style of movies. Just - as I said above, let's do it in moderation, and don't try to pass it off as serious film-making. That would be an insult to the viewers.

2919985,4,B000UAE7O0,"Two masters of modern action cinema, Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, have come up with a jim-dandy of an idea for their first collaborative moviemaking effort, ""Grindhouse.""  They have decided to make two `70-s-style exploitation pictures (the kind of movies on which these two directors were obviously weaned), package them into a double feature, then add a coming attractions trailer and a note from the theater management to make the ""experience"" complete (please note that this review is based on the split-DVD versions of the film, not the original theatrical release).  Although the films are set in the present day, the directors have made them appear to be un-restored relics from three decades ago.  The poor lighting, faded colors, missing frames and surface scratches all make the prints look very old and worn indeed.  In fact, were it not for the cell phones and references to Chris Rock and Osama bin Laden contained in the film, one would swear Tarantino and Rodriguez had just found these long-neglected movies moldering away in some dusty vault somewhere, possibly on the lot of American International Pictures.

But beyond the obvious technical triumph, is there anything of substance to ""Grindhouse""?  Well, if by ""substance,"" one means ""food for thought,"" then the answer is probably no.  But if there is intrinsic value to be had in simple camp and parody, then Tarantino and Rodriguez clearly deliver the goods.  While both films suffer from over length and hit a point of diminishing returns before reaching their respective conclusions, ""Grindhouse"" provides entertainment in extremis for schlock-meisters everywhere.

The first up is ""Planet Terror"" (directed by Rodriguez), a cheesy zombie picture decked out with absurdly over-the-top action sequences and a great deal of good humor (it`s amazing just how close some of this gets, in terms of storyline and detail, to the later ""I Am Legend"").  The large cast consists of Freddy Rodriguez (""Six Feet Under""), Josh Brolin (""No Country for Old Men""), Bruce Willis, Naveen Andrews (""Lost""), Rosa McGowan, and Harley Shelton, all of whom get into the spirit of the enterprise by ginning up their energy levels and playing their roles with deadpanned earnestness.

The second feature, ""Death Proof,"" is considerably different in style from Rodriguez` entry, with Tarantino bringing his trademark mixture of snappy dialogue and graphic violence to the offbeat tale of a homicidal movie stuntman (Kurt Russell) who employs his souped-up, ""death proof"" car as a weapon of mass destruction.  There are those who will find ""Death Proof"" to be too talky and slow-moving for their tastes, especially in contrast to the hyper-kinetic ""Planet Terror,"" but Tarantino's more cerebral approach makes it possible for him to achieve a tone of genuine menace in the second half of the story.  He also undercuts audience expectations by casually doing away with most of his main characters partway through the movie.  Restless action movie aficionados should also note that all the talk is merely a lead up to a spectacular car chase sequence guaranteed to have them gripping the arms of their seats in excitement.  An affectionate homage to all those car-demolition epics from the 1970's - ""Vanishing Point,"" ""Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry,"" ""Gone in 60 Seconds,"" etc. - that one scene alone is worth the price of admission.  (Oddly, at about the midpoint of the movie, Tarantino suddenly drops the pseudo-'70's look in favor of a more contemporary style).  Russell has a grand old time playing the grizzled serial killer, while Rosario Dawson, Vanessa Ferlito, Jordan Ladd, Sydney Tamiia Porter, Tracie Thomas, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Zoe Bell and Marcy Harriell provide eye-candy aplenty as the various women and/or victims who come his way (though, why oh why does Tarantino keep insisting on casting himself in his own pictures?).

The faux-trailer that the directors have attached to the beginning of the movie (it's for a film called ""Machete"") comes about as close as possible to looking like the real thing, with one key exception:  it features swear words and nudity, something that no coming-attractions trailer, to my knowledge at least, has ever done.

As a pastiche of raw-boned, off-Hollywood moviemaking, ""Grindhouse"" is a mixed-bag of virtues and flaws, and it won't be everybody's cup of tea by any stretch of the imagination.  But lovers of '70's movie schlock should have a decent enough time with it - provided they have the patience to sit through it that is.",1200873600,2,4540,5.174863387978142

When the deal goes wrong, Abby shoots the DC2 and it all fills the night air and infects some of the town's residents. Then we meet Dr. Block and his wife, Dakota. They work the graveyard shift at the hospital. Meanwhile, Cherry runs into her old boyfriend, El Wray. During a ride in his truck, they run into some trouble with zombies! Cherry loses her leg, and Wray takes her to the hospital. At the hospital, the bodies keep rolling in, and the zombies take over. Cherry, Wray, Dakota, and the sheriff all meet at the sheriff's brother's BBQ place called The Bone Shack.

2919992,2,B000UAE7O0,"Don't get me wrong, ""Planet Terror"" is a fun film.  But, it is not ""amazing"", ""terrific"" or even ""awesome"" as I keep reading in so many other reviews.  This film is exactly what it set out to be; a cheesy take on 70's drive-in films, with one huge exception:  Unlike those films in the 70's, which were cheesy due to a low budget, it's very obvious that ""Planet Terror"" had a larger budget, but choose to go the cheesy route, possibly thinking it would be more entertaining.  I found it lazy.  There is no plot, no attempt to give ANY of the characters a persona and possibly the worst dialogue I've seen in a movie.  There are so many spots where it becomes so obvious that the script is meant to be bad, that it loses the whole point and ""campness"" that make films of this nature enjoyable.
Going back to the characters for a second, I'd like to point out that this is what I found to be most disappointing about this film.  I never cared for a single one of them.  I never cared if they died, if they lived, nothing.  None of them are likable and that is really because none of them are defined.  You just have a bunch of people.  One is a mother, one is a go-go dancer, one is a sheriff, one is a BBQ chef and that's all you get.  Answer me this, how can a horror movie succeed if the audience never feels scared for the characters in the movie????
This movie is not a complete waste though.  The gore is probably the one area of the film that truly excels.  The way the film was shot was, for lack of better words, ""cool"".  I love the grainy footage that is splashed in throughout the film.  The action is great, especially at the end.  But, again, here is another problem with the characters; they almost seem invincible, especially el-ray and peg leg.  How am I supposed to be scared for them when they can't seemingly be hurt?
Anyway, the film is entertaining, but nothing that I will ever watch again.  I'm a huge fan of cheesy horror(check my reviews for proof), but I find something sad about purposly making a big-budget film for the purpose of cheese.",1199059200,9,2064,4.300518134715026

2919997,4,B000UAE7O0,"I saw Grindhouse in Theaters.  Once.  It was an awesome experience, and I could not wait until the DVD came out.  I expected, if not a single DVD, then at the very least a double-DVD set with both movies (and hopefully the intermission at the end of Planet Terror or at the beginning of Death Proof) and perhaps even one or two DVDs of special features.  And yes, I expected the price to be around 30 bucks or so.  But it would be worth it, even though the experience still would not be the same as it was in theaters.

Unfortunately, most likely due to the costs involved in trying to keep Grindhouse a true double feature, we get this...a divided film.  And unfortunately, the DVD is nowhere near as exciting as the theater experience.  If you missed Grindhouse in theaters, buy both Planet Terror and Death Proof to get an idea of how cool it would be to see both on the big screen back to back.  If you saw Grindhouse in theaters, this may not be worth it unless you enjoyed the actual films that much.  I enjoyed the theater experience more, and I hope that some day Grindhouse will achieve Rocky Horror status and be replayed in theaters year after year.

I hope people who did not have the chance to see Grindhouse in theaters will buy these two DVDs, so that if a studio decides to take another risk and launch a double-feature like this one, they will actually make some money and be encouraged to continue doing so.  These kinds of films may be just the resurrection that movie theaters need.",1197158400,,1502,4.4021739130434785

2920001,3,B000UAE7O0,"When ""Planet Terror"" ends there should be a series of schlock trailers and then ""Death Proof."" That was the point of the double feature. There are some who would say, wrongly, that many of us didn't see ""Grindhouse"" in the theater because we were too lazy to see a 3hr double feature, or  because we saw ""Disturbia"" neither is true. I for one couldn't afford a baby sitter and the money for a theater seat isn't something we always have, I really hated having to wait for DVD for this. That said, the DVD is shockingly disappointing. The ""extended cut"" here has the same running time as the ""international version"" there's ten minutes not seen in the U.S. because theaters didn't want the films w/credits to run over 3hr 30min. If you saw it anywhere in the world other than the United States of America (A Subsidiary of Halliburton) you already saw the ""Extended Cut.""

For the film itself, mindless zombie gore and explosions. The issue I have with both of these films is that they use modern techniques that takes all the 70's experience out of them. Both films feel like they should be set 30 years ago, but then a cell-phone comes out and you realize that the sense of time here is gone. The CGI combined with the fake scratches and stutters make for an uneven experience. First of all, I just watched ""From Beyond"" last night, a low-budget gore-fest from the very early eighties and they didn't release it on DVD all scratched and ruined, they fixed it and made it look pristine. The other issues I had with ""Grindhouse"" included the deep, saturated colors that when a real grindhouse film would look washed out and the rich surround sound when a true grindhouse film would be in mono. The films only look a tiny bit authentic, more like a NIN video than a grindhouse film.

There's no plot here worth talking about. This film is about a government gas that turns people into zombies, the only cure, more gas. As long as you keep inhaling you're fine, stop and you blister, bubble and fall to rubble. It's a film where guns never run of ammunition and a girl can replace a leg with an assault rifle and fire it by simply willing the bullets to come out. Suspend your disbelief here, all who enter!

I like ""Death Proof"" better. Tarantino rights the best dialogue this side of Kevin Smith and when his film kicks into high-action gear it's earned not taken. Nothing in the 105 minutes of ""Planet Terror"" is as good as the last 18 minutes of ""Death Proof.""

I'm embarrassed to say that I'd never heard of Rose McGowan, but she was terrific, and I've just ordered ""Devil in the Flesh"" based solely on her performance in this film.

I also bought and watched the Grindhouse companion piece, ""Death Proof,"" which I enjoyed. However it doesn't have ""repeat viewing"" written all over it.

By the way, I loved ""300"" and ""Sin City."" I disagree with one reviewer that didn't like ""Sin City"" because its plotlines didn't make sense. I suggest that individual watch it again a few times. It makes perfect sense, and is a top-notch film on all counts (Jessica Alba notwithstanding).

It was as if Tarantino felt that he could put anything out, and his devoted followers would praise it as genius.  Judging from some of the reviews of that film, I guess he was right.  I almost did not rent ""Planet Terror"" due to my experience with ""Deathproof"". However, I decided to give it a chance.  I am glad that I did.

2920013,4,B000UAE7O0,"You've gotta love blood, gore, sex, lesbianism, and impossible human feats to enjoy something like PLANET TERROR. It is, in essence, a hardboiled 70s slasher/zombie film with all of its nonsensical sexual under (and over) tones surrounded by reel-to-reel style filming with its scratchy and skipping that those who've spent time at the drive-ins of ol' will no doubt enjoy as it harkens them back to days gone by (gotta love that run-on sentence, eh?)

Rose McGowan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Proof/dp/B000R7HY0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Proof</a>) plays Cherry Darling (no, it's not a p0rn name ...although it could be), a strip dancer who's suddenly thrust into the middle of a pending apocalypse. The military has unleashed a zombifying chemical and it threatens Cherry's nearby one-horse town.

She is quickly reunited with El Wray (Freddy Rodriguez,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lady-in-the-Water/dp/B000JLTR8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lady in the Water</a>), a lost love turned truck driver who's never forgotten her. The two zip this way and that in an attempt to avoid the newly walking dead but Cherry meets up with a hungry bunch and has a lower leg gnawed off. She's taken to a local hospital where it rapidly becomes apparent that the zombies are taking over.

Meanwhile, El Wray is taken into custody by Sheriff Hague (Michael Biehn) and there's an unmentioned tension between the two that escalates as the Sheriff's town begins falling apart. But the Sheriff knows how good El Wray is with a gun (""I never miss."") and eventually hands over his pistols to him. The ensuing head shots are gruesomely wonderful (I believe the handgun was a .45).

Also amongst this chaos is the strained marriage of two physicians, Dr. William Block (Josh Brolin,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dead-Girl/dp/B000MTFFO0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dead Girl</a>) and Dr. Dakota Block (Marley Shelton, DON'T COME KNOCKING) who work at this hospital where zombies begin increasing in numbers. William suspects his wife is having an affair and it is later confirmed; but it was with another woman, something that incenses him. Dakota is excellent at anesthetizing patients and her skills with her sexy syringe-stuffed garters comes in handy.

The running gag throughout the film is a take on a barbeque restaurant which is besieged by the undead. It is run by Sheriff Hague's brother and the two are at odds over a secret sauce recipe. The brothers eventually come together in a very destructive way, but come together they must.

In the end it is El Wray and Cherry who save the day. El Wray with his dead aim and Cherry with her newfound leggy weapon (gotta love the handicapped!)

This will be a film of contention for many. For those who want a serious telling of a great zombie flick, they won't find it here. For those wanting a laugh-out-loud comedy in-line with such things as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaun-of-the-Dead/dp/B0006A9FKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaun of the Dead</a>, they won't find it either. But it is nicely wedged in-between those two, with some rousingly good gore and a few chuckles thrown in for good measure.

A decent film for those that might enjoy a stroll down memory-film lane.

I do not live my life on the Internet. Neither does the vast majority of the people on this planet. When this movie was first advertised apparently only the Internet zombies knew it was a new film. It was advertised as an older movie and that is probably the reason why the movie bombed. Who the hell wants to go to the movies and pay for a thirty year old film? I don't have the time or inclination to do your marketing for you so get it right.

Piss poor marketing killed this movie at the cinema, not apathy. Get over it. I didn't go watch it because I didn't even know when it was going to play. I had seen an ad somewhere but had assumed it was for some old flick, never mind the names of the directors attached. Good old-fashioned self serving egotism did these films in.

To have some nit-wits here tell us that we should be happy with the cut versions we're offered now because we didn't support the film at the box office, thereby making us ""unworthy"" of seeing the film as it was supposed to be seen is the height of arrogance. Let me remind you of something. We are the paying public. We do not get ""punished"" for not supporting a badly marketed film, the makers do.

Having said that, I watched ""Planet Terror"" having rented it. It was an amazingly entertaining film. After watching it I researched it online and found ""the rest of the story."" Now knowing what it was meant to be, I refuse to buy these cut pieces of crap until I can see it in it's full theatrical release. I am a customer. It is my right.

The 'Werewolf Women of the SS' trailer was waaaaay better than 'Death Proof'. Here's how exploitation films work Q.T., action-talk-action-talk etc. That way you keep the audiences attention AND drive the plot and characters.
Anyhoo, 'Planet Terror' is a much better film. Shorthand- 'From Dusk till Dawn' + Zombies.

I REALLY wanted the trailers, but I will not buy the double bill DVD as I object to giving money to Tarantino as it may be used by him to make films, so it's back to YouTube for those trailers...",1193702400,,1250,4.712328767123288

While not as original as death proof this one is hillarious, and Rose McGowan does a terrific job, its extremely funny when she puts the machine gun on her leg.

2920023,5,B000UAE7O0,"First off I love the steel case packaging. So glad I sheld out the extra cash cause apperantly they're gonna be hard to come by. Now for the movie. On this version of Planet Terror we DO get the fake movie trailer. YEAHHHHH! Unlike the DVD for Death Proof:( This version to me seems exactly like the theatrical version. I didn't notice any extra footage.

This was my favorite of the 2 movies. This movie to me is pure genius. It does such a good job of being cheesy that it becomes excellent. The acting, writing, and direction are all top notch. Acting especially from Freddy Rodriguez who I believe will become one of our next great actors. The movie is violent and gory, scary at times but more often funny, but it also has a good story that is actually interesting. The movie is not for everybody but if it sounds like something you might like, then you will like it.

Also in the steel case packaging you get a third disc that is just stuck in there in a white paper sleeve. The disc is unmarked. It is footeage of a Grindhouse 101 seminar with director Robert Rodriguez.",1193616000,8,1077,4.38
2920024,4,B000UAE7O0,"Originally the second part of the Grindhouse double-feature along with Tarantino's Death Proof, Planet Terror finally gets an elongated release of its own. A throwback to the B-movie nastiness of the 1970s, the flick centres of a group of survivors, including a mysterious drifter, El Wray (Rodriguez), a solicitous stripper (McGowan) and a doctor desperate to escape her possessive husband (Shelton) - all of whom are immune to a toxic gas that is making the majority of the town hungry for blood and guts. They must fight off the zombies using seemingly every weapon imaginable, to endure the night and get safely to Mexico. Easily the strongest part of the proposed double-feature, Planet Terror is a horror film very much in the vein of earlier Rodriguez cult classic From Dusk Till Dawn - inexplicably entertaining and cheesy at the same time. However, some of the dialogue feels tongue-in-cheek, while other scenes are played arrow-straight and suffer as a consequence. Rodriguez is widely-regarded as one of the most innovative directors working today, and if Planet Terror does nothing else, it proves that point unequivocally.",1193529600,2,1135,5.2076502732240435
2920025,4,B000UAE7O0,"Planet Terror is Robert Rodriguez's best movie since Shark Boy and Lava Girl....j/k I mean his best since Sin City lol. It's about a gas that's released on the world that turns people into zombies. What seperates this from other recent zombie films though is the great cast and the great action and b-movie goofiness.

  Rose McGowan has been good in movies like Scream but she shines here more than she has in other movies. She also wasn't bad in Quinten Tarantino's Death Proof. But here she steals the show as an extremely sexy stripper that loses a leg due to a zombie attack. She soon is transformed into the toughest chick with one leg when El Wray (Freddy Rodrguez) gives her a gun for a leg.

  Of course you also have people like Bruce Willis, Josh Brolin, Marley Shelton, Nicky Katt and Naveen Andrews in good form. But what I also love about the movie is that it casted Michael Biehn (Terminator, Aliens) as the sheriff and Jeff Fahey (LawnmowerMan) as his cook brother. Although he's the sheriff, Biehn also wants a recipe that his brother won't give him. Anyway what I like about them being in the movie is that they haven't been in many in years. Although I hear Fahey will be in Lost season 4 which is pretty cool. Now if only they had a part for Biehn lol. What I'd also like is another Grindhouse double feature but that probably won't happen since for some reason the Planet Terror and Death Proof combination didn't do fantastic in theaters.",1193529600,2,1460,4.532319391634981
2920026,5,B000UAE7O0,"I approached ""Planet Terror"" with some trepidition because Quentin Tarantino's segment of ""Grindhouse"", ""Death Proof"", was such a crashing bore.  Well, Robert Rodriguez's flick is the polar opposite of that self-indulgent mess.  Rodriguez inherently understands that the whole grindhouse experience is about fun and he delivers it in buckets.  Whereas Tarantino had to spell out in capital letters his influences(we filmgoers can't be as knowledgable as the former video store clerk), Rodriguez references the work of George Romero and Tobe Hooper with maybe a touch of Sam Peckinpah without rubbing our noses in it.  For sure there's a lot of gore here but Rodriguez presents it in such a hilarious tongue-in-cheek manner that you're never repulsed by it.  Rose McGowan gives a star-making turn here and she has a classic beauty that reminded me of a latter day Rita Hayworth.  I also liked Josh Brolin as a physician treating the infected.  Brolin is a terrific actor and you should check him out as the heavy in the underrated ""Into the Blue"".  Rodriguez with this film and ""Sin City"" puts himself in the first tier of American directors if only the critics would get over their aversion of the genres he works in.  On a final note will somebody make a full-length version of ""Machete"", the film trailer that stars Danny Trejo and Cheech Marin.",1193529600,3,1347,4.977678571428571

2920029,5,B000UAE7O0,"Robert Rodriguez hit's the nail on the head when recreating the old exploitation classic's. I was never a huge fan of his, but I am now.
There is every thing that comes along with the great old exploitation flick's: Gratuitous nudity, ridiculous dioluge, gore for the sake of gore, comedy, huge plot holes, and over the top violence, and most importantly doesn't take itself too seriously. I went into watching this expecting to hate it, but I really ended up loving it.
The special effect's and zombie's in this movie are great looking. It does not go 10min. without making your TV cry out for windshield wiper's with all the blood spraying everwhere. Seriously this movie is one of the goriest I've seen since Dead Alive.

Always looking for a new place to stick a gun, he is one of the few directors who can grab a genre and re-energize it; This movie is just fun all around; I found it much more entertaining than Deathproof(too much talking for me...), and seemed to capture that style, camp, and look of the 70's exploitation movie just a little better. I loved alot in Deathproof, but felt it could have lost a little more in the editing room, made it a little tighter... Rodriguez keeps the quirky talk and moves us right along with it; Way over the top, ultra violent, and some things you may not have seen in a movie before(everyone knows about the machinegun leg by now, but I think it's a first!).

2920031,5,B000UAE7O0,"""Planet Terror"" is Robert Rodriguez' contribution to ""Grindhouse"", where it was double-billed with Quentin Tarantino's ""Death Proof"" and complemented by fake movie trailers to recreate and re-examine the exploitation film experience of the 1970s. Truth be told, ""Planet Terror"" owes a lot to 1980s sci-fi action-horror, but this homage to zombie movies surpasses most of the films it emulates. I expected to be bored. I was surprised to find myself giggling at the gorefest. There are severed limbs, vile disease, splatter, and grotesqueries galore. But it's a hoot.

Go-go dancer Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan) crosses paths with ex-boyfriend El Wray (Freddy Rodriguez) just as a dispute between a rogue Army officer (Bruce Willis) and a mercenary scientist (Naveen Andrews) results in a toxic biochemical agent being released into the air in their small Texas town. The gas turns those who ingest it into grotesque zombies who prey on the living, ripping their victims limb from limb. The lovers lead a motley group of survivors against the zombies -despite Cherry's newly-acquired disability.

""Planet Terror"" is scratched and speckled, recalling a film that has run through the projector too many times. The film in the Weinstein 2007 2-disc set is 10 minutes longer than the theatrical double-bill version, but there is still a ""missing reel"". One fake trailer, for Mexican vigilante flick ""Machete"", precedes the feature. Tarantino's ""Death Proof"" is more cerebral in its comment on exploitation cinema, but ""Planet Terror"" is better-paced and has more laughs. ""Planet Terror"" manages to be both self-parody and a terrifically entertaining example of those films which it parodies.",1193356800,2,1686,5.406844106463878
2920032,3,B000UAE7O0,"Planet Terror is without doubt the best 'good' movie that I've seen this year. It's certainly no 5-star classic, and it hardly borders on being 'great', but for a deliberately over-the-top, 70's Horror/gore-sploitation spoof, it easily takes the 2007 best-of cup.

Have you ever seen that campy flick from the 80s called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Return-of-the-Living-Dead-Part-II/dp/B0002KQNL8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Return of the Living Dead Part II</a>? You know, where some government bio-warfare chemicals are accidentally released and turn anyone that comes into contact with the agent into a brain-craving zombie? Well, Planet Terror Director Robert Rodriguez clearly has seen it, and he ultimately made what could be considered a *much* better than the original remake of ROTLD II with PT.

Unlike its Grindhouse partner,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Proof/dp/B000R7HY0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Proof</a>, Planet Terror goes mainly with the 'that's just plain silly' instead of the 'this could really happen'. The situations in Planet Terror are over-exaggerated (deliberately); the gore is way over-done (deliberately); and the movie is as much a Comedy (deliberately) as it is a Horror film. Keeping the 'deliberateness' of the movie in mind makes it all work quite well.

Planet Terror is full of actors you know, and many are usual suspects in the Tarantino/Rodriguez shop. The actors really help make this movie successful at what it's trying to do by taking their roles seriously in a not-so-serious movie.

2920033,5,B000UAE7O0,"Any movie that features a heroine with an automatic rifle for a leg is cheesy at best, but Robert Rodriguez doesn't stop there.  He brings in blatant sexism, gaping plot holes, hammy acting, silly dialogue and unbelievable action into this messy cinematic masterpiece.  If you are expecting anything beyond that, you are watching the wrong movie.  Come on, how serious can a movie be when you have a heroine strutting around in a leather miniskirt, a push up bra and the aforementioned prosthesis?

What makes this work is that Robert is not trying for anything high-minded; he took all the conventions of the genre and cranked them up to delirious heights.

There are a few clunky ""heavy"" moments in the film that feel bogged down and are quite painful but if you can make it through them there is a fun ride in store for you.  The filming made me laugh when the missing reel message popped up and the warbles and pops are a fun throwback to horrible, horrible ""grindhouse"" films.

I think there is a lot of the experience that was lost when the movies were split up outside of the theater.  I wish that a true theatrical running of double-feature with advertisements and trailers was available because that is what I really want.

2920037,5,B000UAE7O0,"Some fans and reviewers are going on and on about The Studio's decision to break up these Grindhouse films into two features because it didn't make any money in the theaters. Some of the cynics think that The Studio will put the two films back together in a Special Edition to double dip your pocket book. Well, it's official; Rodriguez says on The Special Features Disc, that it will be released in it's original theatrical version. So, it is a business, and some of you can stop crying.

I for one, am glad they split these flicks into two separate DVDs. There are several reasons I wouldn't go see the Grindhouse double feature. One, I've never really liked any of Robert Rodriguez' films. From Dusk Till Dawn was okay. I even walked out of Sin City when I saw it in the theater. (Rourke, one of my favorite actors, was great. The look of the film was great. But, it was chock full of unfinished stories, with no substance whatsoever, Frank Miller found in a drawer one day. Entertaining? Maybe. Not to me. It took me 4 viewings on cable just to get through it one time. 300 is a great Frank Miller story.) If Sin City had been shot as a real film, it would never have garnered the attention and acclaim that it has. Two, Quentin Tarantino has shot his load as a great writer. IMHO, his last great film was Jackie Brown. Kill Bill volume II was an episodic mess. I could talk about how bad that film was for days. I won't. It's no wonder I didn't go see The Grindhouse double feature.

I'm glad these films are on separate DVDs because, Planet Terror is a great zombie horror genre film, and Death Proof is a godawful mess.

(How could Quentin Tarantino come up with such a great idea for the man that was so wonderful as Snake Plissken and R.J. MacReady in those classic John Carpenter films, Escape From New York and The Thing, and under-utilize him to such terrible effect? Kurt Russell was so amazing at the beginning of Death Proof as Stuntman Mike. But, he's nowhere to be seen in the dragging, sagging, middle of the film. And the ending of Death Proof is so out of character for Stuntman Mike, that it ruined the whole experience, among other things, for me. He turns into a wimp because Tarantino is really just a girl at heart with his ongoing female empowerment diatribe. Some realistic, pretentious, and unintelligent dialogue from a bunch of female characters that would cause me to run out of the room screaming and pulling my hair, if they were dining anywhere in my general vicinity. Nothing empowering here. Tarantino forgot to make them interesting. I have to admit, the car crash sequence at the beginning was worth the whole price of the rental, but the rest of the film is Tarantino at his worst. Even the wrecked look of the film disappears towards the end. Continuity anyone? It's official in my Grindhouse, The Emperor no longer has any clothes. Continue your worship at his alter and press the No button.)

I have to admit, this whole Grindhouse retro-love is beyond me. I don't remember most of the films that these two guys are giving homage to. I have seen, and love, some of the bad 70s B-Movie splatter flicks, the black exploitation flicks, and the car flicks. But, I'm not sure the Grindhouse title is anything more than exploitation of exploitation films and a marketing ploy.

So what's a guy like me doing reviewing Planet Terror? Well, I have an open mind, for one. Two, I worship at The Temple of George Romero. And I absolutely love a good zombie gorefest just like the next guy.

Planet Terror is pure zombie splatter overload. No social commentary ala Romero here. There's also no realistic, devoid of zombie conventions ala 28 Days Later. This is just a balls out (pun intended) comic splatterfest the likes of which we hardly ever get to see anymore. Some wonderfully humorous and deadpan acting from a great great cast, hot chicks with machine gun legs and hypo-guns, some wickedly sly one liners, over-the-top, tongue-in-cheek action, and gore galore. The slimy oozing kind of gore that makes this film worth loving for all of us sick gorehounds that just love stuff like bloody genitalia, exploding heads, and splattering zombie body parts. This flick will stain your television screen for weeks after you run it on your DVD player. Make no mistake, fanboys. Zombie movies don't get much better than this. And it's bloody hilarious to boot. Now, this is what I call, female empowerment! The opening trailer for Machete had me giggling like a madman too. I would love to see that flick for real, Rodriguez. BRAVO! I give Planet Terror a 10 out of 10. Pure mindless fun for horror fans. I'm in Heaven. Or should I say, Hell?

Take it from someone that was no fan of Robert Rodriguez until now. This is a Classic of the genre and deserves to be in your collection. It's now in mine.

2920038,4,B000UAE7O0,"There are alot of us that should have gone to this in the theater and supported this maverick attempt, but the trailer wasn't cut that well and most of Rodriguez and Tarantino's fanbase are lazy DVD collectors who just assumed we could snatch it up in 6 months or so.
All that BS aside they delivered an old school cinematic butt kicking that pulls off the real double bill drive in Job Bob Brigg's special that they teased at with FROM DUSK TILL DAWN a decade ago.  Planet Terror is an homage and remake of countless films and directors, I had alot of Carpenter,Romero,TCM flashbacks during PT and they never felt forced or gratuitous (unlike the VIOLENCE!) Rodriguez knows how to pace the story and action scenes particularly well and doesn't fall victim to the DIGITAL BLUR that sullies so many modern fast paced action scenes and leave you saying what did I just see?
 This is a well paced star laden smuckers jam pasted thrown down with a few really terrific performances and set pieces tossed into the mix.  The fact that QT and RR work better with little studio involvement is evident here as the self indulgence and attention to detail is what makes these exploitation love letters tick.
Satisfying for the classic gorehound like a good arcade compilation I can't wait for the real theatrical cut on DVD someday but until then DEATH PROOF/PLANET TERROR and the Machete trailer or gonna have to satisfy that DRIVE-IN craving.

""Planet Terror""...Robert Rodriguez's first half of the experimental 2007 Grindhouse experience.  As the cliche goes...before you go in leave your brain at the door.  But in this case, that could be taken literally (as one scene in the film will explain that.)

Anyway, is this film good?  No, not really.  Its premise is just as stupid as countless other Seventies Grindhouse-style films.  But what makes this one different is that it was made in the digital film age, so the special and visual effects are better than those achieved 30-40 years ago.  Of course, the aging, scratching, and even film melting effects are put in it intentially which actually disguises it to the point of it being such a bad movie thus making it somewhat of an instant classic.",1192838400,,795,4.751824817518248

The dissonance between the retro style of this movie and its contemporary setting was much better handled than in the Death Proof DVD.

Zombies, more zombies, gore and cheesy humour. This movie is pure escapist fun with its tongue in its cheek. The ""Machete"" trailer really added to the feel, I felt like I was back at the drive-in. The ""Missing Reel"" was a great gimmick to avoid explaining how all the main characters ended up at the barbecue shack.

I felt like a kid again! I can't think of anything Rodriguez did wrong with this except that he didn't teach Tarantino how to do the same bang-up (pun intended) job for his retro car movie.

If you want a serious motion picture oeuvre, then why would you even consider a film called ""Planet Terror""?

Or they say it was just plain stupid. And the funny thing is I agree with them. It was fake. It was gory. It was stupid. But in my opinion that's what made it great. For those that don't know, this was the first film in Grindhouse. The double feature created by Tarantino and Rodriguez. These two work beautifully together. They both have amazing talent and skill but also know how to have fun. They make sure the people that come to see their movies get every penny's worth. They don't just make a movie. They give you an experience. This movie wasn't made to be an Academy Award winner. This movie was made to give people a good time. It was gritty and worn. There is blood and guts, bullets and explosions, foul language and zombies galore. Its over the top and completely unbelievable which is exactly what it was meant to be.
It starts out with military men meeting and a trade goes wrong and a gas is sent into the environment. As the hours go by the townspeople slowly pour into the hospital showing some of the most disgusting symptoms I have ever seen. These people slowly start dying off. Only problem is they don't stay dead. They come back as flesh eating zombies. As the night goes on, it looks like the end of the world is upon the survivors. They all meet up and after a lot of blood is spilled and bullets are fired, and come up with a plan to head to Mexico. They can start fresh there with the ocean to their backs. I don't wanna ruin the ending or give the whole story so I'll leave it at that.
As for the movie itself, it's a classic zombie movie with a Rodriguez twist. Over the top action. More blood and gore than I thought was physically possible. And some of the craziest, most ingenious ideas I've ever seen.
The dialogue isn't the greatest and some of acting could be better but with everything going on in this movie, it is barely noticed.
Overall, I'd say this is one of the greatest movies I've seen in a long time. It kept my attention, it made my jaw drop, it had its comic moments. Planet Terror gave me the perfect movie experience.

2920049,5,B000UAE7O0,"For starters, I went and saw this double feature THREE times in the theater: once with my cousin, again with my sister, and finally with my wife.  Each time, I loved these movies more and more and appreciated Rodriguez and Tarantino taking such a daring step on such a clueless and idiotic American public.  As a hardcore horror buff, I found necessity in supporting an already-dead, oversaturated  genre to possibly help breathe some new life into it for would-be directors and potentially renewed interest in GOOD horror movies in our society.

Well, did it work like they had hoped?  Of course not, look at we Americans: we're fat, lazy, whiney [...]!  To those who did go to the theater to see ""the Grindhouse experience"" reborn, it was awesome, wasn't it?  To those of you who are whining about the films not being released together, please shut the hell up (I asked nicely).  These films were grouped together only for the sole purpose of giving a nod to the scummy days of late 70's exploitation flicks for a new generation of moviegoers.  Most of those films from the 70's were originally supposed to be stand-alone films as well, but they were grouped together to draw a bigger crowd for a movie-going deal.

Planet Terror and Death Proof are completely stand-alone films and were awesome in their own right, but they also worked very well together as the double feature experience.  Buy both DVDs and stop all of your whining about the release.  There are bigger fish to fry than worrying about how a DVD is being released, right?",1192492800,3,1540,4.726591760299626
2920050,5,B000UAE7O0,"Bruce Willis and his cohorts have unleased a deadly gas into the atmosphere--one that rots away at the flesh, and turns the populace into cannibalistic monsters.  Caught in this nightmare is Cherry Darling, a go-go (not cry-cry) dancer who loses a leg and gains some self-respect; a mysterious truck driver named El Wray, who is handy with a gun and never misses; the local sheriff who's been around the block and is rather weary of it; the local barbeque chef who just wants to make his recipe the best he possibly can; and the frantic mother who's just trying to save her child from her sadistic husband.  Together, they must combat these hordes of zombies before the zombies eat them.

That's basically it.  Never fear, though--""Planet Terror"" isn't meant to be anything more than exploitation fun, which is what makes it so tantalyzingly enjoyable.  A stellar cast (Rose McGowan, Freddie Rodriguez, Michael Biehn, Jeff Fahey, Josh Brolin, Marley Shelton) leads the way, with wonderful supporting roles from Willis, Michael Parks, Tom Savini, Quentin Tarantino, and Robert Rodriguez's own son providing ample and talented back-up.  The writing is crisp; the action flows along smoothly.  There's little pondering about WHY people are becoming zombies; there's no room and no need for it in a movie of this sort.  This is an exploitation movie, and as such is not meant to be thought-provoking, only chilling.  You'll cringe in spots; yes, even you, the die-hard horror movie fans, will squirm in your seats.

A note about ""Grindhouse"" overall.  Tarantino's half, ""Death Proof,"" was a more serious, thoughtful effort; while I admire Tarantino, and absolutely love his contribution, Rodriguez's would have to be my favorite half.  I'm not sure why...maybe because it's just good fun.  For those of you who, like me, saw the movie in theaters, you'll be happy to note that the scratches are still here; the missing scene is thankfully still missing (I was upset that Tarantino put the ""lap dance"" scene back in ""Death Proof,"" but it's all for the best, I suppose); and the ""Machete"" preview has been tacked onto the beginning of the movie.  Rodriguez also makes mention, in the bonus features (well worth watching, by the way), of a future double-disc ""Grindhouse"" release...so hopefully the rest of the mock-previews will be included there.  It'd be great to see this feature in its entirety.  If nothing else, these seperate releases help us view the movies on their own terms; both live up to their hype (and, in many instances, surpass them).  So go ahead and buy them individually; I did.  And I'll buy the ""Grindhouse"" feature when IT comes out.  Because, let's face it--these are just two great movies.",1192492800,,2709,4.98
2920051,5,B000UAE7O0,"For those unhappy that the trailers were not included on Death Proof, let it be known that with Planet Terror, the Machete trailer is there just before the real movie begins! Grade A move there! Thank you Mr. Rodriguez! It's too bad the rest aren't there either.

However, this movie is excellent. I loved Death Proof, but Planet Terror just rocks! Rose McGowan is hot and the movie is out right over-the-top gory and hilarious. Unlike Death Proof (whose picture mysteriously cleans up), Planet Terror stays true to it's Grind House roots with the shoddy picture, missing frames, including the meltdown during one of the steamiest scenes in the movie.

What I really like is something Rodriguez did with the DVD release of Sin City: including an audience reaction track during a showing of the film. It makes you feel so much a part of the experience when the movie was shown to the public.

Disc 2 contains the normal stuff you expect from Rodriguez, including the 10-minute film school, a feature on the babes of Planet Terror and more.

Overall, much better than the Death Proof release and including the Machete trailer really helps.

Own both movies to complete the collection though. And hopefully, with enough people crying for it, maybe we can also get the original theatrical release as well. Would that be useless talent #151?

Oh, and during one of the features, Rodriguez speaks about an upcoming 2-disc edition of Grindhouse which will include his 10-minute cooking school, so maybe that is the theatrical release? We can only hope!",1192492800,3,1545,4.877862595419847
2920052,5,B000UAE7O0,"Because of a totally awful local theater, we never got the full ""Grindhouse"" experience with 2 films and several fake trailers. Not that it mattered since most people avoided the film anyway, proving that great ideas for film geeks don't mean a thing to Joe Casual Moviegoer. I watched the film's second half ""Death Proof"" done by Quentin Tarantino and found it kind of a bore with a car crash and a thrilling chase being the highlights. Now we have ""Planet Terror"" done by Robert Rodriguez which is probably some of the most fun you can have in a movie, theater or otherwise.

Cherry, a former go-go dancer with dreams of being a standout comedian, meets her ex Wray who has a mysterious past. Elsewhere, husband and wife Michael and Dakota are going through some marriage problems with Dakota being unfaithful. However, they will all meet when a viral infection hits town, turning the unlucky into pus-covered crazies with a taste for humans so they all, as well as the local sheriff, a barbecue cook and a scientist, need to escape town before they become lunch.

""Death Proof"" talked a lot about things evoking the feeling of old 70's cinema but as a film it just felt empty with a bunch of characters talking, and talking (and talking) with each segment bookended by a great sequence. ""Planet Terror"" on the other hand feels like an exploitation film would feel like: it's campy funny, it's campy gory but vastly entertaining. Deaths are disgusting yet a level of fun is injected to not make them too overtly violent. We also have the print which has been intentionally altered to have print flaws, scratches, image which seems to pulse and even a image burning up, revealing the ""missing reel"" which isn't included since it was always part of the joke that it was missing.

Whereas Grindhouse's second half had unsympathetic characters but anchored by a great Kurt Russell performance, here it's basically's Rose McGowan's show and everybody else is just appearing in it. Sympathetic, believable yet able to kick undead (or whatever they are) ***, she's the scene stealer here. But then again we have Freddy Rodriguez who's finally used more than he was in Poseidon and Lady in the Water; Michael Biehn, James Brolin and Marley Shelton also appear as well as Naveen Andrews of Lost fame and Bruce Willis. The only weak link strangely is Tarantino playing a soldier/rapist who kind of hams it up a bit.

To be honest I always found Sin City aesthetically pleasing but kind of emotionally-inert with one-note characters besides Mickey Rourke. While I'm not sure if I can call this Rodriguez's best film, it's certainly one of his most entertaining on par with Desperado.",1192492800,4,2674,4.819172113289761
2920053,5,B000UAE7O0,"The best part of Grindhouse (besides the fake trailers) was Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror, which is now on DVD nearly a month after Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof was released.  Though the Weinstein Company sadly decided to split the films for home video release (besides Machete, the fake trailers aren't here), the pair's Grindhouse films are an experience to say the least.  Planet Terror revolves around Go-Go dancer Cherry (Rose McGowan) and her ex-flame El Wray (Freddy Rodriguez) who are caught in the middle of an undead outbreak.  As survivors gather together, the military steps in with their own intentions, and thus let the blood bath begin.  What really makes Planet Terror so good is that Robert Rodriguez is clearly having a blast with the proceedings, as he pays delightful homage to the exploitation flicks that inspired Grindhouse as a whole.  There's nifty gore effects from industry master Greg Nicotero, and the rest of the cast, including Bruce Willis, Josh Brolin, Marley Shelton, Michael Biehn, Jeff Fahey, Stacy Ferguson, and Lost's Naveen Andrews, make memorable turns as well.  Instantly enjoyable for zombie addicts and Rodriguez fans alike, Planet Terror is a deliciously bloody and gooey treat.",1192492800,18,1228,5.271794871794872

I remember seeing ""grindhouse"" double features when I was a kid in the 70s. I loved them then and I love them now. Death Proof and Planet Terror capture the true atmosphere of the old 70s flicks.

Planet Terror is a fun movie to watch. Action, blood and explosions galore! And how can you resist Rose McGowan and her machine-gun leg!

Don't try to analyze Planet Terror. It's simple with lots of action and laughs. This movie along with Death Proof are not for little kids though- a word of caution - these movies have quite a bit of harsh language and graphic violence.

Buy Planet Terror along with Death Proof (yeah, I was a bit disappointed too that they didn't come together in a single set) Make some popcorn along with your favorite beverage. Sit back and have a ball!",1192406400,,888,4.53125
2920058,5,B000UAE7O0,"This is a fun horror movie flick with a good storyline that takes me back to films such as the classic ""The Return Of The Living Dead"" and ""Evil Dead 2"", two films that I love. I now put Planet Terror at number 3 behind those two films. Not to be taken seriously of course and very tongue in cheek but in my opinion it's a great return to classic genre form and far superior to the ""Scary Movie"" franchise for example.",1192406400,,418,4.109756097560975

If I want art, I'll let my girlfriend pick the flick.  I want entertainment and action.  Death Proof was just plain painful to endure.

Planet terror, part two of the double billing, is fun, but I could do without the fake file burn, missing reel, scratched, color washes and the like.  The cameo appearances are cool, and the gunfights are typical of the old drive-ins:  a revolver shoots 20 rounds, etc.  I hardly used the >> button at all. The movie unabashedly rips off zombie flicks, Samurai Jack (The Scotsman's Machine Gun Leg), and others - just like those old films did.

I've wasted more money on worse movies.  If you like zombie flicks, Bruce Willis, or strippers with full-auto appendages, then this is an enjoyable way to spend around 80 minutes.

The fake trailer for Machete was fantastic - especially the bike mounted Vulcan mingun!",1192406400,,1018,4.631284916201118

And then when i found out they weren't going to be on this DVD either, now i'm pissed off. but other then that, the movie, Planet Terror, is by far the better half of the Grindhouse feature.
The action takes place in a small town where a goverment faction has been conducting experiments that turn the dead into the undead. Now a small group of townsfolk must fight through the zombie hordes and make it to safty.
Now, this is the film i think really captured the whole Grindhouse experince. while Death Proof seemed to have given up on the whole experince about halfway through the film, Planet Terror makes full use of the whole fun of the Grindhouse. with its grainy picture, missing reels, outrageous plot elements, it was honestly one of the most fun i had at the movies.
Like i said before, i do hope they release the movies in one single DVD set, trailers and all, with loads of extras. But until then, for those of you who can't wait to see the films, two options. rent the two films at your video store and watch them back to back. or if you can't wait, get Planet Terror and stave of getting Death Proof until the deluxe edition comes out (if ever).

I'm a fan of Tarantino and Rodriguez so I loved Grindhouse. Truth be told, these films are instances of two cutting-edge, extremely talanted film makers having fun, that's why they were so fun to watch. Regardless of what Tarantino claims, that Death Proof was his latest ""real"" movie, it wasn't. It's him having fun with a long lost  B-movie tradition. It doesn't come close to the level of his real films e.g. Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill. In Death Proof the dialog often rang false. For the first time watching a QT film I had a hard time immersing myself in the film's dialog. It actually sounded like actors reading lines that Quentin wrote down on paper rather than fiction operating in real-life situations, as his previous material does. Caught in the moment like your eavesdropping on a conversation, that's what I love about QT films, and this one wan't like that. But it was still pretty good and I'm sure his next one will be up to par.
Planet Terror, on the other hand, while still riffing on the old grindhouse tradition, is a great movie, and funny as hell. It is right up there with RR's best films, the Mariachi trilogy. Fans of QT and RR will get both Grindhouse movies anyway, but I would recomend Planet Terror over Death Proof if I had to choose.",1191715200,,1438,4.426415094339623
2920067,2,B000UAE7O0,"I saw the feature film feast that was Grindhouse on a friday evening.
The theatre was largely empty.  I sat through several previews for the coming summer fare of movies and was largely unimpressed (save for Live Free or Die Hard, but that's another review for another time). But the previews were over and it was time to get my Rodrieguez on.  As soon as I heard the gravelly voice-over for the revenge movie known simply as ""Machete"" I knew I was in for one helluva ride! For the next 3 hours I was left in state of giddy euphoria.  I found the camp and wit of both features overwhelmingly entertaining and the action was over-the-top, in a good way. Fun was had by all ten people in the theatre.
I went again the following Saturday.

Obviously I was a fan.  So it was only natural for me to be excited for what would probably be one of the greatest DVD releases to come along in a long time.  I could see it in my mind.  A faux-worn case with mini-posters and trading cards and booklets chronicling production and giving an overview of the features of the film.

Then September rolls around and I was still anxiously awaiting for news of the release of my beloved ""Grindhouse"" on DVD.  What I get instead is a rushed realese at best of the film ""Death Proof"".  It lacks the faux-trailers and most importantly, Planet Terror.

I can only assume that the man-toad called Harvey Weinstein is responsible.

While both of these movies are amazing in their own right, splitting them apart takes away from the allure and charm of it's original theatrical release.  Much like Cherry's machine gun leg, the movie stands strong and is a tour-de-force when both films and trailers are together.  But without that, you have two movies that want very much to be something more but are missing that crucial element that makes a double feature so special.

Down the road I will probably fork over the dough for both films unless somebody comes to their senses and release I had originally envisioned.  But until then, I'm just going cry myself to sleep until that happens.

So overall, Planet Terror was good, but without all the trimmings that made the theatre release such a delicious bird, I can't endorse this product.",1191628800,2,2210,4.582697201017812

I was anxious to buy the DVD of this as I enjoyed the movie (it was a singular movie, divided in two pieces, like a peanut, in my mind), and now I see these greedy fellows have broken it in half and are attempting to double their profits, and ruin the concept, simultaneously.  And they try to rationalize this pathetic strategy by larding up each half with a bunch of ""extras"" which really will only be of interest to people with way too much time on their hands.  I'm particularly disappointed that these talented directors allowed this rip-off strategy, as I'm sure it would not have happened without their approval.

Guess what?  I can live without these two halves of a whole.  If these folks think that this folk is going to pay the collective price which both disc sets would cost, they are seriously mistaken.

2920070,1,B000UAE7O0,"I think a lot of people here have missed the point entirely on this.  Tarantino and Rodriguez weren't making movies to be shown back to back, they were trying to recreate an experience for their audience.  The experience is what made the overtly bad quality of the film, the missing reels, and the sometimes goofy acting enjoyable.  It's greedy to package these in this fashion but it's also a bit of narcissism and a revisionist attitude for these directors to look at their films after the fact and say ""On second thought my movie was just too damned good to not be appreciated as its own work.""

Grindhouse attracted a special audience of people like us, the pro-active movie-going enthusiasts who are extremely loyal to our cult obsessions and ruthlessly hard to please.  The studio had to know we would be the last demographic that would look at this packaging and accept it, although I'm sure many of us have just because we liked one of the two films too much to go without.  To blatantly deny the demand of the audience is going to affect their ability to sell their supply, and in this day and age when most of us (especially the tuned-in geeky film nerd crowd) have access to p2p networks this is just another example of how media greed encourages the customer to take what they want rather than shell out money for things they don't want.

From the moment this picture went south at its release everyone was looking for a way out, and I think that it's ironic that Tarantino's poorly written acting shop class is the one being placed upon a pedestal as though we just ""didn't get the subtle nuances"" and need to appreciate it removed of all the distracting trailers and cartoons.  Tarantino has vast amounts of credibility with the Weinsteins and I wouldn't be surprised if there was more ego involved in this badly packaged DVD release than just sheer greed. It's a shame too.  The studio could have made a lot more money selling these versions to rental chains and then adding additional content to the original version and selling it in a box with some crappy posters to people like us.",1191196800,9,2100,4.60857908847185

2920073,3,B000UAE7O0,"The Weinstein Company took a hit earlier this year with the bootleg of ""Sicko"" that went out over the web prior to its release. The shame of that is that the Weinstein Company is shorting the fans of Tarantino's Grindhouse by breaking it into two separate DVD purchases, most likely to grab the impatient fans (who are fighting over the subject in other ratings for both disks), who should actually speak with their dollars by waiting patiently for the original film, containing both films (with trailers) which should release sometime after the buzz on the two disks dies down. Instead of the up front $50.00 in cost prior to the whole, I'll go with a COMPLETE PRODUCT.

The real shame here is that Planet Terror is actually the better of the two films, so for some, the omission of Death Proof may be an actual favor. But to me, the act of calling a boycott ""childish"" is rather childish in itself. In order to force a company to release a product that is in the interest of the public, rather than the ""bottom line"", one must withhold the $$ and force them to do right by us, the consumer.

Buy this one if you want to, it's really not a bad movie, but remember when making this purchase, that many more attempts at raiding your wallets and purses may be just around the corner (Special Bonus Edition, sometime next year!!!).

I may only be 32, I may only be considered as having no knowledge of the ""Grindhouse"" genre, but I most resent the splitting up of the two films.  I'm so sorry the rest of America was too damned lazy to sit through it, but I did.  Half way through, I had to pee like the dickens.  But did I complain, no.  The films were brilliant from beginning to end.  And to split it into two is insulting.  Put it onto DVD the way it was meant to be shown: in Widesreen, with both features fully intact, with the in-between trailers.  Do it and do it soon.",1190332800,13,612,4.0
2920078,5,B000UAE7O0,"I went and seen this is the theater and yes, it was by far the best film of the year.  The double feature was really cool.  The only thing I wasn't too thrilled about that I'm hoping will be in the extended and un-rated version are the pieces to the film that were edited out.  They made it look like the film was burned in a few places and there was lost film, I didn't care for that especially paying $9 just to see it at the theater, when I could have just waited to see the whole thing for $22.99 when it came out.  Which by the way, is too long of a wait.  It's been almost a full year and I still have to wait until October for this one to come out.  Death Proof on the other hand... will wait to be purchased because that one wasn't my cup of tea.  It was really slow to begin with and really didn't give you any umpf! You know!  Planet Terror was better than Death Proof any day and by far one of the best movies of the year.

2920079,5,B000UAE7O0,"Ok...so let's think about this. Did you really think that with the way these 2 Directors like to package their Bonus Features together that both of these movies would be put into one set? On the 1st release? If you've been buying DVDs since Day 1 you would know that this is just the 1st realease of these movies. I guarentee that 3 months from now (come Christmas time) that there will be another BOX SET released. Does anyone remember buying SIN CITY? 4 different boxes and NO EXTRA features. That meant this: Rodriguez LOVES extra features! That meant he was taking his time putting together the ULTIMATE SIN box set. That meant he wanted us to have those extras. But the studio (and possibly Robert) wanted to make some extra bucks. What is the freaking problem here?!!! Frankly I would rather have to separate movies so I can watch them indiviually. If you go to Walmart right now you can buy it for only 18.99. So quit bitching and get a clue people. If you wanted the GRINDHOUSE  experience, you should have gone to the theater. This is home video. Welcome to it!!! The idea was brilliant and was a load of fun. I have my own copy of DEATH PROOF (not my fave of the two) but with the extra footage it was much better than the theater. I am anxious for PLANET TERROR. So that's all for now and support your local filmmakers!!! I am one.
Thanks for watching.

2920080,1,B000UAE7O0,"This DVD release gets one star for the same reason many have already stated: Lack of faux trailers, seperate from Death Proof and different release date than Death Proof.
This was obviously only done for one reason -- more money. I can see the producers now: ""We didn't do so well in the box office, or at least as well as that crappy Spider-man 3 movie, so lets release the movie in two seperate parts, throw a bunch of crappy extras that nobody really cares about watching so as to constitute a second disc and leave out all of the faux trailers that viewers saw in the theater so we destroy the purpose of the film in the first place.""
And then it probably went something like this: ""After making 'bank' off of selling this movie in two parts, a couple months later we can release the film in it's entirety w/trailers and minus all the stupid extras, and make even MORE money off the mindless consumers!""
This movie started off as a unique and artistic experience, a real treat for people who love movies, unfortunately the directors and producers let something as silly as money get in the way of creating something truly memorable. My advice is to not fork over a single red cent of your hard-earned money on this attempt at stealing your money. And then when the real film is released on DVD, don't buy that crap either... if you have to, steal it, but don't just hand over your money to these people and pretend that there's nothing wrong with being conned and monetarily raped.",1190160000,10,1485,4.503703703703704

And for those of you complaining about the separate packaging, suck it up. Grindhouse is comprised of TWO movies, both of which have the right to stand on their own. If you got to see the whole shebang in theaters, consider yourself lucky. I do.",1190160000,2,522,4.4375
2920082,5,B000UAE7O0,This is the best movie of 2007. I haven't had this much fun since watching Evil Dead 2 the first time. Just spectacular and fun.,1190160000,2,128,4.16
2920083,4,B000UAE7O0,"Yes it sucks they are releasing Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's films separately.  And yes it sucks most of us will more than likely end up shelling out more dough for either the theatrical version of ""Grindhouse,"" or some form of special edition package that, even if doesn't recombine the films the way they were in their glorious theatrical release, combines these two movies in some fashion - and gives us back the faux trailers, which were just as much a reason to see ""Grindhouse"" as either of the films themselves.

 ""Grindhouse"" was an experience.  That was the whole point of the project.  Bigger than just seeing a double feature, the creators wanted their audience to experience the exploitation pictures of the 70s, many of which inspired them to become the directors they are today, in all their over-the-top glory.

 Because the film was too long, too violent and released on Easter weekend, people just didn't get it, didn't want to see a couple of grainy, odd 70's exploitation style flicks (they weren't hits then either, and that's the whole point), it was rated `R' and largely off-limits to its target audience, or because the promos for the film so heavily focused on something as admittedly strange as a stripper with a machine gun leg - there are several theories - ""Grindhouse"" disappointed in theatres.

It is perhaps because of that we are now getting the films released separately and the experience has been, for the most part, broken up and abandoned.  Gone are those terrific trailers, though they admittedly would have seemed out of place as individual special features on just one the films; and gone is the thrill of what was a three-plus-hour, down and dirty, drive in spectacular.  Who knows if this decision was meant to recoup lost funds in order to release more versions down the road, or if the two films were always planned to live on their own after theaters, like any film that was part of a double feature during its theatrical release.

As I said, this is not the way I would prefer to relive ""Grindhouse,"" and I sympathize with those who would bash these two DVDs because releasing them separately not only distorts and truncates the experience, but this decision feels like it will ultimately prove to be a cash-grab by the studio when, six months down the line, they decide to release another version.  But the fact is, the ""Grindhouse"" films are still great and work well on their own.  Just because they are no longer a double feature doesn't mean each doesn't accomplish what it sets out to do expertly well. And realistically, this type of separate release makes sense in that these really are two separate films, not one long one.  But I loved ""Grindhouse"" in its entirety so much that I was looking forward to reliving the experience over and over, and I envisioned it becoming one of those staple movies the next generation watches behind their parents backs during sleep-overs and such.

Well, shoulda, woulda, coulda.  That's not the way, at least for now, the films will be released.  And my own hopes for the film's legacy are not what I am supposed to be reviewing.

Nearly as much as debating this releasing format, people have been debating which half of ""Grindhouse"" is the best - Tarantino's or Rodriguez's.  I will admit right off that I found much more to savor, as I always do, in Tarantino's film, ""Death Proof"".  Some have dismissed it as too talky or too boring or not the ""slasher"" film it was presented to be (though I don't recall being promised anything specific from the movie before its release).  It is first and foremost a hot rod thriller ala ""Vanishing Point"".  Cars, stunts, menacing characters - both evil and anti-heroes - and thrilling chases are the point of this vehicle.  As usual Tarantino doesn't just mimic the films and filmmakers he idolizes, but he raises the bar and does all the old stuff in a new, interesting and many times in a shockingly audacious way.  And the stunts in this flick are not only spectacular, but they are real; and I'll take that over CGI and camera trickery any day.

Which brings us to ""Planet Terror.""

Yes Robert Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror"" is the flashier, showier, more action-packed entry here, and just because I'm in the ""Death Proof"" camp doesn't mean I didn't love what Rodriguz did with this zombie throwback.  As both spectacle and parody, ""Planet Terror"" is big, loud and fun.  It has a great cast, some surprising cameos, and tons of great lines.  I think the problem I had with ""Planet Terror"" is that it was a zombie movie.  Not because it is a zombie movie (I love zombie movies), but because there have been so many lately and a lot of them have already been presented in a hip, self-winking manor as if they were already sending up old-school, schlocky 70's zombie movies.  Because of that, I always felt like I knew where ""Planet Terror"" was going and I was never that thrilled or gripped with suspense.  The movie managed to have some big surprises here and there and plenty of individual great scenes and moments.  I would never call it dull, or bad, uninteresting or anything other than expertly done - as I said, I liked this film too, it's just that by comparison, I think Tarantino offered up the more interesting film.

But, to each his own.  The criticisms for films like this - and with the goals these guys have in mind, which is really to deliver a piece of hopped-up nostalgia - are relative and negligible.  Too criticize ""Planet Terror"" for some of the things I did one could argue is missing the point.  The whole reason for these movies is to honor and revisit the over-the-top junk that these films were.  It that regard - and in terms pure entertainment and bang for the buck - these films both out do themselves.  But, as they say, I likes what I likes and ""Death Proof"" was more my style.  More ambitious and less obvious in its thrills, the movie builds a sense of dread and it gets that feeling of 70s cinema just right, from the opening shot and title cards, to its gasp-educing, thrillingly abrupt conclusion.  Kurt Russel is flat-out fantastic and real-life Tarantino stunt-woman Zoe Bell is a discovery and revelation.  As always with QT, this movie is dialog-heavy.  I savor his stuff.  If you don't, I can see why the movie may play like less than the sum of its parts for you.  But I love juicy dialog as much as I love the blood and goo that spills and flies out of bodies in movies like ""Planet Terror.""

And that is the genius here.

By giving us both sides of the coin - two major types and examples of 70s exploitation cinema - ""Grindhouse"" delivered on both a promise and a concept.  No two directors were more suited for the task, and it likely would have failed with any others at the helm.  Now that QT and RR have laid the blueprint, I look forward to seeing what other genre-dabbling directors could do with similar material (like all the guys who contributed those terrific afore-motioned fake trailers - I would definitely pay to see full-film versions of ""Machete,"" ""Thanksgiving,"" and ""Nazi Werewolves of the S.S."").  Sadly, because the films are now split, some of you may not feel the same excitement (and if you didn't see it theatres, for now at least, you won't see any of these trailers).

But rest assured, even separated, if you pick up either ""Death Proof"" or ""Planet Terror"" - preferably both (and assuming you know what you are getting into and what these two visionary directors are trying to do) you are in for one hell of ride.  For true film fans or just those in search of something daring, original, and way too entertaining, to miss these two films, or in the case of the fans boycotting their separation:  to avoid buying these two films, is to miss out on a great film experience.  Sure the real experience was better, but buying these separate is hardly a rip-off.  First, both come in jam-packed, two-disc sets with all kinds of bells and whistles, including deleted scenes.  And speaking of deleted scenes, since about a half an hour of each film had to be cut for the theatrical release, had they just released ""Grindhouse"" as we knew it, we would not be seeing the films in their intended entirety.

I don't know if that makes up for separating the two, but it is reason enough for fans of these films to rejoice.  Face it.  Had they released ""Grindhouse"" as we knew and loved it, we would still want to see the individual movies in their entirety, so most likely we would have wound up buying two products somewhere along the line anyway. I'm actually hoping somewhere down the line I do indeed get that chance.  No I don't want to see three or four more DVD releases of the individual films, but I'll spend some money on these as they are, for what they are, and the entire ""Grindhouse"" someday.

Here's to hoping we get that chance.",1189900800,10,8849,4.626760563380282

I'm probably one of the few who actually saw the two seperately in theaters because that's the way they released it in France, so I didn't have the possibility of viewing them back-to-back with the trailers, etc... like in the US.
That being said, I'm glad that they're releasing it like this.  Each movie stands well on its own, and even seperately I'd have to agree and use the term ""masterpiece"".

The uncut version of ""Death Proof"" that was released in theaters over here is completely genius.  There is a lot of talking, but once you get what Tarantino is trying to do, it makes it that much better.  Add to that Vanessa Ferlito's lap dance (that was cut in the US version), and really you can't ask for much better.  In the version I saw there also wasn't a ""missing reel"" because it wasn't cut out.  The performances by the girls are amazing, and it's thanks to those that the movie reaches its full potential.

While ""Death Proof"" was my personal favorite of the two, I also had a blast watching ""Planet Terror"", which is a zombie flick, a really gross one at that, thanks in large part to their appearance, and it's up to Cherry (McGowan), El Rey (Rodriguez) and the rest to save the uninfected.  Anyone who says that these aren't masterpieces just didn't get the point.  It's supposed to look like a bad horror flick, that's the genius of it.  It's supposed to be ridiculously hilarious and have a nonsensical storyline.  The performances are great, and Rose Mcgowan is just hot, even with one leg and a gun where the other should be.
Whether this helps or not : if the DVD release of ""Planet Terror"" is actually the same as the theatrical release over here, then the trailer for ""Machete"" should be included and should be right before the beginning of ""Planet Terror"", that's how it played over here.

In any case, if you boycott these movies because they're being released seperately, then you're missing out on not one, but TWO great movies that are a guaranteed good time.",1188777600,2,2079,4.632152588555858

I cant understand if its the actual fans who are complaining about the split, or their wallets. At first I was upset about the departure, but then i realized, ""Hey this is a really good idea"" Many wonder why.

With the split of grindhouse, the fan can decide which is worth spending the 25 dollars.  If someone didn't enjoy either they can purchase the other. I think that with the split, it will look nice with all the other dvds to my collection. If one night im up for gruesome blood and guts, ill pop in Planet Terror, if another night im up for high speed car chases or watching Kurt Russell do what he does best, then ill pop in Death Proof.

There are so many good things that someone could say about Planet Terror. If you are a fan of old 80's gore-fest movies this is the movie for you.

Do they really think that by watching a theatrical version of the films on DVD will recreate the experience they had or were supposed to have in theaters? NO.  That was the whole point of making it a double feature because that's where you see double features, IN A THEATER!  I can guarantee you that no matter what kind of home entertainment system you have, you can NOT recreate the experience of seeing it for the first time in the theater surrounded by everyone else that supported this project.

NOW, to the guy a couple reviews down that said that there are no real missing reels for the films and that it was a marketing ploy; you really didn't follow this project, did you?  First off, watch the theatrical trailer.  The piece of the missing real from Death Proof is in the trailer; the part when Stuntman Mike is getting a lap dance from Vanessa Ferlito.  Also, if you would have researched the movies a little more (and maybe even have been a TRUE supporter and fan of Grindhouse), you'd know that Tarantino & Rodriguez both DID FILM THE ACTUAL MISSING REELS.  They cut them out of the movie because of the running time and so they'd have something to spice up the seperate DVD packages.  AND THIS WAS CONFIRMED IN THE HORROR CULTURE MAGAZINES WHICH CAN BE FOUND IN BOOKSTORES ACROSS THE NATION:  RUE MORGUE ISSUE 66 (APRIL 2007) AND FANGORIA 261 & 262.  To quote Tarantino directly from Fangoria:  ...""I don't know if I want to put them back in there later for the DVD. I'm loving this tight version. There's a big section that won't be in Grindhouse because that's where I'll be missing a reel. ...See that script?  Fifteen minutes will be gone and it's gonna be in a place where you don't expect and people will get pissed off.""  The article continues explaing that he's putting the missing reels back in for the DVD's and so on, which is what Rodriguez is doing also.

So sure, the Grindhouse DVD's won't have the 18 and over panther ratings, or the food advertisments (SUPPOSEDLY), but should they really?  Those helped recreate the old theater viewing experience, something which isn't meant to be viewing in your home, but a THEATER.  People need to realize that it wasn't so much the movies themselves that were meant to be ""grindhouse"" style, but actually going to the movies to see a double feature of 2 different horror genre movies that were missing a reel and didn't make much sense.  Which is something I think they intended to do ALL ALONG which they also discussed in Rue Morgue and Fangoria.  So for those of you who missed out on the double feature experience, TOUGH LUCK!  QUIT COMPLAINING!  If you were a true fan and supporter of the project and the film makers, you would have gotten up and SEEN THE DOUBLE FEATURE IN THEATERS.

As for the movies themselves, I like both Rodriguez and Taratino and I thought they both made good movies for Grindhouse (I do like Planet Terror a lot better though).  That being said, if you're a fan of the directors, you'll like these films, both have action, gore, and some great humor and are relatively fast paced (Planet Terror more-so).  So if you're new to these films, I suggest checking them both out!

As for me, I'll buy both.  And if I really want to TRY ""re-live"" the theatrical experience I'LL PLAY BOTH MOVIES BACK-TO-BACK!  I guess it's even too much work to take a DVD out of a player and put in another one right after it for these ""boycotters...""",1187827200,6,3542,4.544164037854889
2920104,5,B000UAE7O0,"First, a word about this childish boycott.  ""Grindhouse"" gave us two brilliant genre films for the price of one in the theaters.  It was a once in a lifetime experience for most of us and a chance to see the two most bada$* directors in Hollywood give us 3+ hours of hardcore horror entertainment including the funniest faux-trailers your likely to ever see.  And it bombed.  Big time.  Why?  Because lazy America said it'd wait for the DVD because the film was too long and lost the chance to support a truly brilliant idea and show that we are sick and tired of cardboard cutout PG-13 teen horror and bad remakes of beloved cult classics. They went to see ""Disturbia"" instead. ""Grindhouse"" was what true horror fans -hell, what all true film fanatics- have been dying for and shame on all of you who missed it.  So the studio took a loss for taking a chance on this idea and as a result, they've split the two films up with extra scenes that were cut for time and are giving us these two films as we haven't yet seen them, each in double-dic editions packed with extras.  Awesome, right?  Weeeeeellllll, now the same whiners who stiffed the films in the theaters are angry they missed out and want both films on one DVD (as if there'd even be room) for a discount price.  Sorry, but it don't work that way.  The theatrical cut was packaged as just that, an experience for the theaters simulating the double-feature drive-in days of old.  Even if that experience would translate to DVD, why would the company re-release it in a form that already failed miserably? The bottom line is this: we now have another chance to show that THIS is what we as horror fans want to see and the only way to do that is to buy these great-looking DVDs.  The notion that making the films bomb yet again on DVD is going to lead to some super-duper deluxe theatrical edition must have been conceived in the mind of a five year old on crack.  If we don't support these editions, these films will die and the studio will waste no more money on this failed project or any like it in the future.  This is basic business sense.  Support true horror and boycott crappy remakes and bloated sequels *cough*Spiderman3*cough* instead.

""Planet Terror"" as you already know, was Robert Rodriguez's half of ""Grindhouse"" and while it's artistically inferior to it's sister film (Tarantino's ""Death Proof""), Rodriguez brings the campy action, hardcore gore, and zombie awesomeness hard and fast like you know he can.  The music, as always, rocks and grooves, the deaths will make you laugh and recoil in disgust, and Rose McGowan may well be the sexiest thing on the planet. The story is nonsense, of course, and the dialogue is hammy and shooting a grenade launcher directly into the ground will NOT launch you into the air (not in one piece, anyway) like a superhero, but this film is of the kind where this sort of unreal madness only makes you love it more and leaves you drunk and giddy with the chaos. It's silly, but you will love it. Much of ""Planet Terror"" makes me feel like I'm watching the most kicka$# video game ever made; a game I'd really love to play.

  The movie is packed with recurring jokes and funny, memorable dialogue (much of which is based on Rose McGownan's real personality) that pays off in spades down the line. Rodriguez did not skimp on the cast, either.  Sure, he cast most of his family plus his doctor and even his freakin' real-estate agent, but they are all fantastic.  Bruce Willis chews the scenery, Freddy Rodriguez is THE zombie-killing machine, Quentin Tarantino plays ""rapist #1"", and you know it's a true undead party when Tom Savini hits the scene.  Also, Fergie plays a lesbian who gets her brain eaten by the marauding undead.  Yes, I know if this was realistic the scene would have played out like the Simpsons episode where the zombies moan ""braaaaaainsss"" as they feel her head and then, finding none, leave the so-vapid-she's-sexy pop tart to ponder her 15 minutes of fame; but like I was saying, this is not a realistic movie and any dead Black-eyed Peas member is a good one.

If anyone knows how to do extras right, it's Robert Rodriguez.  You've got the standard commentary, plus the audience reaction track from the film's premiere (a personal favorite), his patented ""10 minute film school"", and yes, the ""Machette"" trailer still precedes the film.  Sweet.  The rest of the bonus features largely mirror the ""Death Proof"" DVD with lots of love for the cast and stuntpeople; very informative and very entertaining.  I was actually hoping for more restored footage to the actual movie then we get (more crazy babysitter twins, anyone?) and the visual defects and missing reel -which was fun in the theater- are still there and not nearly as cute, but these are my only gripes.  I could seriously write for days about all the things I love about this movie, but I'll just say one more thing before wrapping up: I sure could go for some barbeque.

""Planet Terror"" brings some seriously awesome action-horror that delivers everything you want in a zombie film and you'd be a fool to pass on it just because you don't get a whole other movie free.  Buy it, buy ""Death Proof"", and then go wave your copies at the moron down the street who's boycotting.",1187740800,304,5269,4.619098712446352
2920105,5,B000UAE7O0,"The biggest problem with Grindhouse on DVD is the sheer length of it all. DVDs can only hold so much data, so are we going to sacrafice the ""experience"" or the ""quality"" ?

Imagine seeing the 'grimey' horrorshow, now with a grainy, pixelized transition. You'll love it, I'm sure.

Unless new advances in BluRay or HdDVD have lead us to adding a longer runtime without severely jeapodizing the quality of a film, I'd like to hear a better solution.",1187654400,,447,4.6455696202531644
2920106,5,B000UAE7O0,"Well, I loved Grindhouse in the theaters and have been looking forward to the DVD release. I don't mind them being split up. Unrated and extended is better in my book.

2920107,5,B000UAE7O0,"I saw this in the theater, along with the inferior DEATHPROOF, and I found myself thinking, good gravy, this is more like a Tarantino film than the one Tarantino actually directed. For those purchasing this half of GRINDHOUSE on dvd, hard to believe, but, well ... this is the only half of GRINDHOUSE you really need (but the bogus trailers that came between the two films would have made a great special feature). PLANET TERROR is a true homage to the zombie genre, so gruesomely realized that it actually ends up transcending it.

I cannot believe it escaped the NC-17 rating, as bloody and nasty as it is. But really, if you were brought up on DAWN OF THE DEAD and similar fare, you'll not be complaining when the chick with an automatic weapon for a prothstetic leg mows down the undead in an entrail spewing fit of pique, nor will you turn away when the helicopter bears down and forward, employing its rotors as a zombie scrambler--all to a very retro, very cool soundtrack. It's not so much a reimagining as it is a celebration of the thoughtless violence and carefree destruction that characterizes most zombie films. You'll also enjoy a veritable bevy of top-flight cameo appearances that I won't spoil for you by revealing them here.

2920108,5,B000UAE7O0,"...that they decided to split this into two DVDs. When I saw this in the theater, I absolutely fell in love with ""Planet Terror"" and despised ""Death Proof"" (save for the final scene with the boot and the squish, you know). A part of me is sad, though, that they split this up into two, just like they did with ""Kill Bill"". I'm wondering what's going to happen to all those awesome fake trailers that they had in between the movies (my favorite was the one in the beginning before PT started). This isn't that big of a deal to me but I can see where everyone is coming from. It is a big gyp for the people that loved both movies and wanted them all on one disc. At the very least, they could have made it a two disc edition and just not have had as much bonus material. Or they can do what Lord of the Rings did and just have like a gigantic box set with every needless special feature in the world. Either way, it's not going to change the executives' minds. :(

Cheer up guys, it could be worse!",1187481600,,996,4.107692307692307
2920109,4,B000UAE7O0,"Cherry Darling played by Rose McGowan who strips to get a ""leg up"" and make ""ends meat"" realizes her destiny with a little help from her ex boyfriend ""El Ray"" and a machine gun leg after an experimental bio-weapon is released turning everyone into zombie like creatures.  At the end in her Arab like garments and how far she'd come it reminded me of Lawrence of Arabia albeit by means of a fun gore fest b horror movie about three hours shy of David Lean's epic masterpiece and instead a cool Rodriguez film.

There are some other minor plot points such as Bruce Willis and his ties to Osama Bin Laden.  A love triangle between Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas (along with a few gratuitous shots of her) Marley Shelton and her abusive husband played by Josh Brolin there both doctors and this comes in handy as she can keep needles under her garter.  A sheriff played by Michael Biehn (Aliens, Terminator) who wants his brothers barbecue recipe and last but not least keep an eye out for the babysitter twins.

Out of the two grindhouse features I found Tarantino's Death Proof to be the more artistic and probably better film although I found Planet Terror to be the better action movie and a fun ride, although Death Proof did have one of the best car chase scenes I've seen perhaps since The French Connection.  It's kind of the way I view Alien and Aliens.  Alien to me is a great film and to me superior however Aliens is also great and one of the best action movies I have ever seen.

All and all released together or separately or if they come out with more editions there both two cool movies and some of the best of 2007 and a worthy add to any collection and both dvds are filled with extra, I've listed Planet Terror's below.

2920110,1,B000UAE7O0,"This ""movie"", as anyone who viewed it in the theatre will tell you, wasn't so much a couple of films played back-to-back as a unique cinematic experience. In essence, the whole was greater (much, MUCH greater) than the sum of its parts.

Sorry folks, Planet Terror and Death Proof aren't cinematic masterpieces. They were never meant to be. Flying 'em solo violates the entire purpose of their creation. Two releases - what's the point? Now they're just a couple of me-too horror flicks on DVD.

I can't believe someone here has suggested that the DVD releases will contain the complete and unedited versions. Sorry to disappoint, but there wasn't any reel missing from Planet Terror - that was purely a gimmick to create a feeling that the film stock itself was well-worn and it was written into the script. And don't expect them to clean up the pops and scratches either. Those were intentional too, my friend.

Certainly, those ""flaws"" are going to be more annoying than charming sans the complete grindhouse experience.

Furthermore, as I must admit, I saw this a second time (and would've went a third time had it stayed around longer) in the cineplex solely to see the faux trailers again. What do I have to buy to get the highly quotable and gut-busting previews for Machete, Don't! and Thanksgiving? How about the not-so-appetizing advertisement for that plate of soggy nachos at the local Mexican dive?

I'm afraid some people just don't get it. The greatness of Grindhouse was the CONCEPT itself. Releasing these two ""features"" separately without the glue holding them together is like releasing the Sound of Music without sound. Dumb indeed.",1187049600,41,1652,4.928057553956834
