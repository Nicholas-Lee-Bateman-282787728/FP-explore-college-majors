2794003,5,B000OCY65Y,"I happened upon this movie on PBS when I was on a business trip, and it essentially helped to kick-start my journey into a healthier lifestyle, where I have lost 40lbs already in a 150lb long term goal.

I remember being deeply and personally moved by the stories, but it was also a game-changing flood of information about the latest biological research that did the trick for me.  It allowed me to see the issue not in terms of will power and laziness (as is all too common in popular culture as well as years of medical haranguing) but in terms of physical compulsion akin to and even surpassing opiate addiction.

Why was this new information so critical in my current success, where previously I had tried and failed?  It is definitely that it shatters the myth that weight loss is as simple as consuming less than you expend, a glib and harmful misstatement of the problem as profound as saying that beating heroin addiction is as simple as going cold turkey.  You'd think that learning exactly how hard it is, really, to lose weight would be discouraging, but it was exactly the opposite.  After years of people, including my doctor and nutritionist, breezily tossing off advice and plans of action, I finally learned what I was up against.  Then I declared war on it.

I strongly recommend this for anyone who is obese or has an obese person in their life.  It's a real eye-opener!",1198972800,24,1389,4.6138211382113825
2794004,3,B000OCY65Y,"Many media discussions of obesity conclude by saying we fat people are stupid if we don't devote all our energy toward losing weight.  This documentary was sympathetic to fat people.  It said research on how to lose weight and keep it off is scarce.  It says there are numerous causes for obesity and there won't be a one-size-fits-all explanation, no pun intended.  It even included a woman who seemed to be a part of the fat acceptance movement.  She asks, ""Why am I fat and healthy, but my thin sister has had three forms of cancer?""  This work doesn't beat up on people in the slightest.  It does mention early death, fertility problems, and blindness due to diabetes:  it's not that the sad stuff doesn't come up.

A conspicuous fact of this film is that it focuses upon VERY FAT people.  Interviewees looked more like Big Pun than Jim Belushi.  They were 350 pounds plus, rather than just in the high 100s or low 200s.  Have you ever seen a plus-size model and thought, ""Gee, they're not that fat!""?  This work features ""real"" fat people who are big, big, big.  I appreciate that they didn't whitewash a group to whom I belong.

The fat interviewees are diverse in terms of age, gender, and ethnicity.  It includes an Arab Muslim family that have accents and bravado like many New York City residents.  The last segment includes Latinas speaking in Spanish with English subtitles supplied.  Though the work includes men and women, you can tell that women are more of their target audience.  The chubby wife of a fat man says, ""Fat women face more stigmatization than fat men.""  I'm a fat man and I agree.

The work focuses on the fat subjects, rather than on narration and experts.  In fact, I think it only included maybe three researchers.  Too often, women are only given the chance to narrate documentaries covering famous women.  Here, Meredith Vieira narrates on a somewhat gender-neutral topic.  I'm glad she was invited to participate (though she's thin, by the way).",1184630400,22,1981,4.705539358600583
8184575,1,B000OCY65Y,"I found this movie to be a total joke. Were those even real doctors on there. If you eat right and exercise daily you will be healthier! I mean really dedicating yourself, it will happen! That is a fact! This movie is basically telling you not to even try cause its not your fault. Well it is. You don't want to hear it but it is. I am an obese 27 yr old women with a bmi of 37. I know in order to change my health it will take me dedicated to working my ass off for the rest of my life. Its not a work hard for a little while get thin and that's it thing. Its a lifestyle. Its mentally holding yourself accountable. Its choosing to not be weak and make excuses but instead make changes! This movie is spreading a bunch of nonsense to some unhappy people that they have no control over themselves! Complete Nonsense! You do have control, you just have to be willing to really do something with it! I wish i could give this negative stars! ",1473120000,,939,4.103260869565218
8184576,1,B000OCY65Y,"I was sorely disappointed in this feature.  Though eating a ""healthy"" diet was mentioned at no time was the idea of a WHOLE FOOD PLANT BASED diet discussed.  I found it disturbing that this film supports the notion that being overweight is essentially a hopeless condition and the most effective solution is surgery.  One need not have ones body parts removed in order to beat obesity.  I am among thousands of people who have overcome the problem by educating myself and adhering to the teachings of  people like Dr. T. Colin Campbell, Dr. Cauldwell Esselstyn, and Dr. John McDougall.  The answer is not in a pill or a scalpel.",1415491200,3,628,4.715596330275229
8184577,1,B000OCY65Y,"VERY DEPRESSING. Simplistic ""safe"" presentation is limited to eat better, exercise more and see your doctor.
This sounds good IF ""your doctor"" (if you have one) knows something about modern nutritional excellence.

No mention is made of doctors and researchers of the caliber of Drs. Esselstytn, Campbell, Barnard and Greger::",1409788800,,326,5.52

8184579,5,B000OCY65Y,"As a teacher, I rented this PBS television special for my class.  I was impressed by how informative and well done it was.  It led to a rigorous class discussion afterwards about today's weight epidemic and what it means to us as a society, and to the individual.  I enjoyed it.  Well written, interesting, good tone.  Thanks PBS for always making good, reliable television.",1367366400,,374,4.78125
8184580,4,B000OCY65Y,"This DVD is about being fat, the consequences, and options for losing the fat.  It follows the lives of various fat people and show where their obesity took them, in a positive and helpful light.",1358553600,,195,4.571428571428571
8184581,5,B000OCY65Y,"I found this documentary very informative.  What I like is that it shows the personal human dramas that rage inside the hearts and minds
of the overweight.  It clearly makes us walk a mile in their shoes and shows the viewer how society can discriminate against the obese.  It is so ingrained
in our culture, and this is important to become aware of. The one personal story that stands out the most for me is that of actress Mary Dimino.
Her journey to health and well being is nothing less than inspiring.  I can relate to her the most because she used health as her motivation.  I recommend this
documentary to anyone who is struggling with a  weight issue.  In fact, I would also recommend it to those who do not have a weight issue,  It may help them
understand the plight of 70% of Americans today.  Good work, PBS!  Thank you for your insight.",1301616000,,849,4.419354838709677
8184582,5,B000OCY65Y,Good video. I FF to some parts because it gets long. Great information and usable for all classes: Wellness; Health; Nutrition. A very good buy.,1286668800,,144,4.8
8184583,3,B000OCY65Y,"Fat is a documentary that looks at America's weight problem. The movie is not encouraging, though it does hold your interest.

The filmmakers focus on the reasons it so difficult to lose weight. We evolved in a world of scarcity and our ability to gain weight (and then keep our weight up) helped us when food was not available. The scarcity is gone (at least in the developed world). As a result, we find its easy to gain weight and difficult to lose it.

The people who appear in the film are likeable, and one sympathizes with their earnest attempts to ""do the right thing."" But the viewer sees little reason to hope that their lives will improve. The filmmakers imply that it is just too difficult to control weight in our calorie-rich, sedentary world. (Fat does present gastric bypass surgery as an effective way to lose weight).

Fat is not a bad film, but another documentary on the same issue - Killer at Large - does a better job of engaging its viewers.",1267660800,,964,4.528735632183908
8184584,1,B000OCY65Y,"I have seen very many health and food related videos in my role as a director on a food cooperative.  I watched this one with the idea it would offer ideas as to better nutrition and the basics as to what we are gaining weight.  In my opinion, and blast away, it takes away the individual responsibility in many respects.  The ""star"" is an 18 year old that is over 500 pounds, because he won't exercise and gets fast food and delivery at all hours.  So instead of fixing that, the solution is to have gastric bypass surgery.  You see his mom deriding him on failing at every diet, and his siblings getting real hot over him not really trying any other options.  There is a heavy couple that admit they can't cook, probably won't like the healthier food, and are only used to the drive through.  A stand up comediene that works out like a dog and has done very well.  And many of the presenters are doctors would specialize in surgery, so forgive my suspicians of conflict of interest.  With less than eleven minutes to go, there is finally anything about nutrition, labels, and keeping junk food away from kids.  So, apparently there are a lot of factors to obesity, and just diet and exercise may not matter.  But our star after surgery, execises and eats less and loses a ton of weight.  My thoughts:  another shift from responsibility from eating right and exercising to ""it's not my fault"" (including one person who gained 130 pounds after college because she did neither).  I don't care about assigning blame, and genetics are a huge factor, but it really seemed another example of not having the guts to look in the mirror.",1266969600,9,1629,4.534246575342466
