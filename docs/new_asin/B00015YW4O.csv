8006980,5,B00015YW4O,"Troy is a virtuoso and an exceptional teacher. In this video Troy shows the basics in lead guitar that will allow you to go into intermediate material. It contains good explanations and demonstrations of basic technique (hammer-on & pull-off, bend, slide, finger vibrato, palm mute, artificial harmonics, alternate picking and more), scales (minor & major pentatonic, blues and dorian), key changes and blending modalities. And not only exercises but also three very short solos. It's very cool to see Troy showing how to use articulations to make licks come alive.
As you guess from the title, this is a DVD for beginners.
Publisher has released a short booklet (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beginning-Rock-Lead-Guitar-English-Edition/dp/0793562112/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beginning Rock Lead Guitar: English Edition</a>) with transcription of the exercises from the DVD.",1202256000,7,916,6.336
8006981,5,B00015YW4O,"This guy is really a teacher. Despite I'm more an intermediate student than a beginner; I bought the first two Celentanos' DVDs (rhythm and lead guitar) for covering ""holes"" in my skills. That was a great idea; in both DVDs I learnt a lot of basics that I dint know. But the best part is that everything is showed in a clear way. I read on the Internet that Celentano went to GIT School and that hi was always trying to learn how to teach the instrument, well, se did.  I have a lot of books of learning guitar but this the clearest one I ever saw.

Talking about the DVD and the booklet, the DVD is actually a VHS transferred to DVD, you can chose chapters and everything but the color is like a Super VHS tape (if you know what I mean).

About the booklet, it's definitely not fancy: the paper is really ordinary and also the print... but it doesn't matter I think. If you want to learn to play rock guitar, Celentano is the teacher.

I have ordered the Intermediate (rhythm and lead) DVDs this week. I will review they soon.",1130630400,4,1027,4.251282051282051
