6877189,5,B00QMX8RJA,"The video quality has improved drastically from what was offered in the ""Official Season 1"" release!  Some of the episodes do look a bit cleaner, and sound a bit clearer than others in this collection -- I am guessing this may be due to the age of the material used, but the set is still fantastic, and thoroughly enjoyable to watch!  I'll go even further and say that if Levy-Gardner-Laven Productions goes back and cleans up ""Official Season 1"" to look like this, I would definitely buy that set again!  Yes, I am that much of a fan!",1419379200,13,535,4.438775510204081

6877193,5,B00QMX8RJA,"This set starts off with an on screen statement acknowledging the issues some folks had with the previous season and the attempts to satisfy those with this issue.  I must say the first episode looks stunning to me quality wise.  The opening has been changed... unlike the first season this one begins with a bit of the episode followed by what I am assuming is the original then series intro.... not the walking down the street firing the gun from season 1.  The image is crisp with terrific contrast, I'm hard to please , hate PD versions of classic shows but this really looks to my eye better than Season 1 and that was good. Something to note , I enjoy the brief synopsis from Chuck Connors at the start of each episode, I don't know what year they were filmed, but they are in color and add to it. I watched these in the 60's as a kid and they bring back huge nostalgia.  Many of the episodes were morality tales, much like Leave It To Beaver, only these often got settled with a gun.  I'm writing this Dec 8 '14.",1417996800,17,1019,4.286458333333333

6877203,5,B00QMX8RJA,"Fantastic collection, I had no idea as a kid just how great this show was.  Chuck Connors and Johnny Crawford are consistently superb, it's too bad that the show wasn't expanded to be a 1-hour show after a few years.  Gunsmoke was also originally a 30-minute show, but was eventually expanded to 1-hour episodes, allowing for much more nuanced writing and performances from the cast.  This is no knock at all on Rifleman, it is still a superbly-crafted show, every episode has engaging plots full of the battle between good and evil, each episode stands up on repeated viewings.  I can't wait for Seasons 3, 4, and 5!

On a side note, fans of the show should seek out YouTube videos of performances from the last 25 years of Johnny Crawford singing and playing the guitar.  He has developed into a major exponent of popular songs from the first half of the 20th Century.  He leads a medium-sized band that performs period-specific songs in the manner similar to vintage recordings on wax cylinders & 78's.  Amazon's rules prevent me from posting any links, just do a search for ""Johnny Crawford singing guitar"".  The Today Show clip with an interview by Jane Paulie and performance by Johnny is a real gem, as are others from various talk shows.  Johnny has a massive talent as a guitarist of great range and a wonderful tenor voice, I urge anyone interested to have a look, or even purchase his CD<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sweepin-The-Clouds-Away-Remastered/dp/B005G547H6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sweepin' The Clouds Away (Remastered)</a>!
