Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller play their parts with such excellence and class that the musical version seems like a rather overdone remake in comparison. No extravagant costumes or snazzy tunes are needed with acting of this high caliber. Truly a necessary addition to the collection of anyone who appreciates pure top notch theater.",1252713600,21,492,4.9156626506024095

3688007,5,B001LMU1BO,"I loved this movie, and I see it as a precursor to the movie ""Anastasia"" - all the important characters in that movie have analogs in this movie.  Though I watched the Amazon streaming version, I am posting here because I've seen a few reviews (on both sites) about the merits of the DVD edition.  I have a question: does your DVD include subtitles or captions? On Amazon streaming video, there were none. I could use help what with the accents (especially Cockney, but even with the English sometimes) and the sound quality. Thanks!

3688020,5,B001LMU1BO,"If you love ""My Fair Lady"", this is a fantastic companion piece. Shaw's estate was directed that any adaptation had to use a huge percentage of his own words, so ""Lady"" kept a great deal of the original script, to its benefit. But there's nothing like the original, and this is it. Much much funnier and true to class hierarchy than the other.",1388880000,2,343,4.4603174603174605
3688021,5,B001LMU1BO,"Unassailable, this film adapted from the play of the great Bernard Shaw holds a large part of its interest in the complexity of the scenario. The two main characters end up living together after having known each over in a very pleasant social environment: complicit mother, foolish rival, respectable people of the world , the picture is rich and inventive.
Pygmalion is a nice romantic comedy. It naturally contains excellent burlesque passages that are no less moving. The man who has managed to transform throughout the movie this woman will not have the incorrectness to boast but it nevertheless remains true that the viewer assists with delight to a real evolution of the female character. Picked up in the gutter, she will have the chance to be accepted by him ( without even having to go through the intrusive step of marriage proposal.)
Actually, from the beginning, we can but to be seduced by this scientist too shy to show off his magnanimous heart . We do not portray enough in our films all that the bourgeoisie is able to teach to the good people, first and foremost to know to express themselves, to express themselves properly.",1386374400,,1145,4.817258883248731
3688022,5,B001LMU1BO,"I always liked My Fair Lady but I'm neither a big musical fan nor a particular fan of that movie. I like it but that is it. I do really like Audrey Hepburn though which is the main reason I watched My Fair Lady in the past.
When I decided to watch this older version of the Shaw classic out of curiosity, I expected it to be extremely dated and not nearly as good as the 1964 award winning musical. I was surprised how completely blown away I was by this version.

I actually had to rewind the movie several times during the movie just to watch a great scene again because it was so good. The movie doesn't seem dated at all and it made me realize that I should watch old classic movies much more often. The final dialogue sequence of the movie was so intelligent and moving that I was speechless.

3688027,5,B001LMU1BO,"""My Fair Lady"", is obviously the musical version of Shaw's Pygmalion, but the actors really seem to be channeling Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller from this film between the musical numbers in that musical from about 25 years later.  Howard is the epitome of pompousness and callous (dis)regard for others' feelings that Rex Harrison could only hope to get close to in MFL and Hiller's Eliza is the equal or better of Audrey Hepburn.  This movie is really a treat and I feel is much better quality in acting and cinematography than other films I have seen of it's era (late 1930's).",1368489600,3,580,4.676470588235294
3688028,5,B001LMU1BO,"Little did I know, having seen My Fair Lady already, that the dialogue for both MFL and Pygmalion are very nearly identical.

Am recommending it to my friends and recommend it to anyone else who loves movies!!!,1363046400,3,268,4.34
3688030,5,B001LMU1BO,"Very well done. Leslie Howard is fantastic as Professor Higgins and Wendy Hiller is also wonderful as Eliza Doolittle. In comparison to My Fair Lady, which is more flashy and glamorous thanks to the song/dance numbers and other elements such as costuming and jewelry, Pygmalion is more subtle and feels far more realistic. Differences such as seeing the inside of Eliza's lodgings, noticing how Alfred Doolittle is seriously nervous about his wedding (as opposed to Stanley Holloway, who drinks and sings and mourns his way to the altar), and watching Higgins fall apart after Eliza implies she's leaving for good (especially obvious in the occasional violence of his gestures), make the cast and the story more gritty and relateable. In Pygmalion, Higgins really is an arrogant, conceited blowhard, but is brilliant and has a heart, even if he doesn't care to admit it. Eliza really is a poor girl who's reputation as a flower girl and not a prostitute is the only thing that keeps a roof over her head, but is willing to better herself and has more strength and independence than she believes.  Comedic touches such as that from the rapport between Higgins and Mrs. Pearce (""Then you'd better find her, damn it!"" is one of my favorite lines), and the dry wit of Higgins' mother (Marie Lohr, also a lovely actress), make it a delightful movie and a wonderful story.",1358208000,6,1366,4.8626609442060085
3688031,5,B001LMU1BO,"I teach an intro to theatre class at Indiana University South Bend, and my students read the play -- it's good to let them see this (non-musical) version of the play, which was adapted by Shaw himself for the screen and maintains most of the original play's dialogue and intent.  My students see this and can then make comparisons to the Lerner & Leowe Musical version. The play is a comedy but has much to say (quite charmingly) about classism and sexism.  Wendy Hiller is a less romantic Eliza than Audrey Hepburn was later, but her performance is phenomenal, as is Leslie Howard's.",1357689600,2,584,4.660194174757281

3688037,5,B001LMU1BO,"A pretty wonderful film of the great George Bernard Shaw play.

Both Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller are terrific in the leads, and this
production brings out both the fun and wit of Shaw's words, without
losing the sharp, complex, and sometimes paradoxical political and
social observations underneath the playful extrtior.

Dated in style, yes, and it could be argued Hiller comes off a bit older than
ideal for the character's innocence.  And some of the supporting performances
are too stagy (although some are very good indeed).

But overall this is a lot of fun, and quite thought provoking, with a
nicely ambiguous ending.

Note, this ""Essential Art House' version is the same excellent transfer
as the Criterion (which owns both labels) the only difference is cost
and extras.",1307145600,9,783,5.038759689922481
3688038,5,B001LMU1BO,"I won't dwell on the wonderful qualities of this adaptation of Shaw's most famous theater piece. I won't tell you how superb the actors are or insist that the film is a must for your collection. I'll simply recommend that you purchase this edition rather than paying a premium for the Criterion Collection DVD, which virtually the same disc. There are no extras on either, and spending up to twice as much for a brief essay on an insert is simply not reasonable.",1287964800,57,462,4.578313253012048
3688039,5,B001LMU1BO,"This a perfect film - perfect script, both leads are perfect, direction is perfect, I can go on and on... I loved the ending, of course, she should stay with Higgins. Eliza is the intelligent girl, remember, and what woman in her right mind would choose a dull and helpless Freddie (mediocrity itself) over a genius and success, as charming as Leslie Howard?! She is smart and brave, she won't be frightened by his manners, she'll learn how to deal with him. Has anybody noticed that at Higgins' mother reception, professor is the only one really interested in what Eliza is telling, not how she is telling it? They are true equals, and there is a great chemistry between them.
The quality of the DVD leaves a lot to wish for - some scenes haven't been digitally redone, no extras, no subtitles.",1274054400,27,795,4.605633802816901
3688040,2,B001LMU1BO,"While the acting in this film (especially Wendy Hiller and Leslie Howard's) is excellent, I really disliked the altered ending. The ending is NOT Shaw's ending nor did Shaw approve of the ending. While I understood the themes Shaw was trying to convey throughout most of the film, the altered ending left me questioning, ""What am I supposed to take away from this film? What am I supposed to learn?""

After a bit of research, I realized that having Eliza reunited with Higgins goes against the entire structure of the play. Higgins is not supposed to be rewarded. In his own epilogue to the play (written in 1941), Shaw clearly displays his disgust with the ending of this film adaptation. Higgins is NOT supposed to receive a happy ending because Higgins REFUSES to alter his behavior.

Because of the ending, I recommend the 1973 BBC adaptations, which follows Shaw's epilogue.

Even though the acting in the 1973 adaptation is quite inferior to the 1938 adaptation, I still believe this 1938 adaptation is worthy of 3 stars while the 1978 adaptation should receive no more than 2 stars. (I would have given this 1938 film adaptation 5 stars except for the ending, which is the same as the ending in ""My Fair Lady"", although it pre-dates the musical.)

However, this said, if you can accept the altered ending, by all means purchase this 1938 Leslie Howard adaptation.",1269216000,18,1370,4.7923728813559325
3688041,5,B001LMU1BO,"Charles Laughton was Shaw's first choice for this film, gratefully; he was talked out of it. Leslie Howard delivers one of his great performances as Higgins.  He captures the snide sarcasm, without hitting it with a hammer.  Howard was famous for underplaying and even taught this to his friend, Humphrey Bogart. Bogart's second child is named in his honor.

The problem with Harrison is that he is far too old for the part and even older for the film.  It is hard to suggest a romance under those conditions.  Howard is in his early 40s and looks a bit younger. Shaw did not consider this a love story but it clearly becomes that, more than the social satire that was intended.

Harrison also declaims the role, as if he was a bit hard of hearing.  One can understand this approach on stage but it gets tiresome on film, where subtlety is appreciated.  Howard explores the nuances of the role without over-blowing the emotion.  He mines it for every comic twist. His timing is infallible and Hiller is the perfect foil for his tyranny.
Watch his eyes, he has some of the most expressive peepers in the business and knew how to use them for the camera. (Ronald Colman was also famous for his ability to act through his eyes.) Howard was nearsighted and loved playing roles that allowed him to wear his glasses.  There are several such parts in his catalogue.  Suggest you check out `The Stand In,"" with Bogart.  Of course the ""Scarlet Pimpernel,"" is a must. ""Pimpernel Smith,"" a wonderful remake of his original film.

Many films can be found on Amazon and other sites and are worth having.  ""Pygmalion,"" is beautifully restored and there is a wonderful new Shaw box with Wendy Hiller in ""Major Barbara,"" featuring a younger and better suited Rex Harrison. ""Caesar and Cleopatra,"" with Vivien Leigh and Claude Rains.  There are many more great films out there and his real genius,  is tragically unappreciated in GWTW.  It was his least favorite role, and the one for which he is best remembered.  A shame.....

""Pygmalion,"" only suggests the realization of a romance at the very end and that was as intended. We are confident that they get together but Shaw leaves us wondering how and when.

For those who only know Leslie Howard from GWTW, this film is a revelation.  He hated ""Wind..."" and only did it as a favor in return for staring in and producing Ingrid Bergman's first American film, ""Intermezzo.""

Howard returned to England where he directed and starred in several fine films during the war.  He also did a great deal of documentary work for the war effort.  He was killed in 1943 while on a trip to Portugal, when his plane was shot down by the Germans. The exact nature of that trip is still in question.  He was just 50.  It is not generally known that Howard was Jewish, of Hungarian extraction.  He married out of the faith and was not very concerned about religion but his hatred of the Nazis is obvious from his work. Had he lived, he might have developed into a fine actor/director, such as Wells or Eastwood or Chaplin.  Even so, the work that he leaves is a testament to his great talent.

A lesser known fact is, that despite a wife and two kids, he was one of the most insatiable ladies' men in Hollywood.  Joan Blondel said that he could sit between two women and flirt with both and make them believe it.  Bette Davis remembered that she held him at arm's length for three films.  One of his children wrote that he could never avoid the female temptations of Hollywood but always came home to his family.  Ironic, for a man who cultivated the exact opposite image. He was also an amazing polo player and loved horses.  Surprising, that he did not play more roles that took advantage of his skills as a horseman.  Actor, Director, Stud, Athlete, inside the shell of a shy, romantic, poetic, scholar.",1267747200,15,3824,4.598227474150665

But on reflection the awarding of misogyny makes the Janus Films version of Pygmalion something other than consistent with the original intent of G B Shaw.

Given an earlier reviewer comment about the pricy versions, my copy was bought at a nearby big box as part of a  price sale. So -not Amazon Verified but I did get a deal.

In terms of performances and as related to the much later musical: This version of George Bernard Shaws Pygmalion is in every respect a great version of the play. There are parts when you can hear the singing and the dancing from the musical and throughout most of Shaws words and intent ring clear.

The point is that Shaw did not write a musical and he did not regard Henry Higgins as a hero. It bothers me that the Professor gets to make it clear that he will be abusive, including violent if so moved and Liza, gets to serve as a besotted assistant. It is never clear that they will be husband and wife. I also suspect that the Profs idea of romantic does not include time spent with a woman. He is clearly happier, more relaxed and more respectful around men. Did Shaw intend for Professor Higgins to be gay? Certainly not in any obvious cross dressing or heaven forbid lisping way, but the character is clearly incapable of acting humanely towards a woman.",1482796800,,1436,4.554263565891473

TITLE: Pygmalion (1938)  NR  1:35:33
  Leslie Howard, Wendy Hiller, Scott Sunderland, Wilfrid Lawson
  Anthony Asquith and Leslie Howard (Directors)

  The quintessential filmed version of one of George Bernard Shaw's most beloved plays, with Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller in the leads  what more can you ask for from a casting director. NOTE: While there appears to be some (very) mild controversy regarding the ending of this version of the movie with a few of the other reviews presented here (possibly because Shaw is known to have said that it was NOT an accurate portrayal of HIS ending of his play); one should also be aware that Shaw also said that other than the ENDING, everything else about the movie was MORE than satisfactory (particularly since he adapted the screenplay from his own play, and he also chose Wendy Hiller to play Eliza). In any event, I've read the play (and, admittedly, while I find its ENDING much more realistic), I still find this version of Shaw's story  as it is presented in THIS movie  to be, by far, the MOST emotionally satisfying. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

  See the other reviews for more detail and/or other opinions regarding the plot of the movie.

  Within the confines of the DVD format (and quite possibly because of its MUCH higher than average bit-rate), this transfer exhibits very-good to frequently excellent picture quality. Criterion's re-mastering of this classic gem is  as per usual  first-rate. The foremost reason being, that while there are artifacts such as black specks, white dots, hair-lines and an occasional dropped frame, they are very few and NEVER glaring. In addition, sharpness and detail (for a DVD) are EXCELLENT throughout most of the film  with the textures of most clothing and furnishings being readily apparent and natural looking. Also, contrast and gray scale (again, for a DVD) are VERY good overall, and in very many scenes, even excellent. The only major issue with this transfer is that, apparently, a limited number of the source elements were in far worse shape than others  and, consequently, a very few sections of the film look much worse than the majority of the movie. Even so, this is the best that this movie is going to look until it gets a well-deserved major restoration and re-mastering for a new blu-ray release.

  Criterion has also done some major clean-up work on the film's soundtrack, because there are no loud bumps nor objectionably high levels of hiss. Also, the dialog is very clear and all voices are easily understood. However, dynamic range is quite limited, and there isn't any bottom-end nor any top-end to speak of (which makes the few sound effects contained in the movie seem ""tinny"" and unnatural). Otherwise, considering the age of the source elements and the fact that this is a monophonic, dialog-driven, movie from the 1930's, this film's soundtrack has more than acceptable sound quality.
