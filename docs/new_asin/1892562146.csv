7801050,1,1892562146,"It is never funny to imprison wild animals for entertainment. In order to train these animals to perform these unnatural acts, negative & painful reinforcement is often used. This is fact, and much information can be found on the web. Do you really think that a bear enjoys riding a bicycle, or that an elephant wants to travel around the US in a small trailer? These animals need to be animals ... not money making machines. Wild animals belong in their natural environments. If you love & respect animals, please do not support this type of ""entertainment"" ... instead, watch humans perform incredible feats.... at least they have a choice! Thank you...",1002153600,,655,4.857142857142857
