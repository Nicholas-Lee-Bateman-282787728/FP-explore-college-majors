2816170,5,B000PCMHEU,This is a fantastic classic and I'm really glad that I found it. The sevice was great and I received the movie in not time at all.,1214784000,,130,3.8518518518518516
2816171,5,B000PCMHEU,"The saga of rural southerners trying to stay on the land continues unabated since industrialization.  Tobacco Road is a wonderful illustration of this struggle, and has many subplots that only a mature viewer would appreciate.  Jeeter Lester was a complicated person - he was willing to steal from his own family, but we admire his steely determination to save the farm.  Idleness had acclimated him to leisure, and laziness now marked his days.  And desperation had acclimated him to dishonesty as a way to get along.  The Lesters were brutal, and they were brutalized.  They were sinners and saints.  If it weren't for Charley Grapewin's upbeat performance, the movie would have taken on the aura of a dark comedy at best, if not an outright tragedy.  Which is exactly what the story was - a tragedy wrapped in the cloak of a comedy.  It has often been said that the line between tragedy and comedy is the finest thread.  I think Ford does a good job of keeping the cloak of comedy on, with occasional glimpses of the ""inside"" story.  Then ending is perfect, for it leaves the laughing child viewer with an assumed happy ending, thinking that it all worked out and they lived happily ever after.  But the mature viewer knows that the ending is sad, because the benevolence of the wealthy friend only prolongs the inevitable.  I recommend this movie for both the amusement seeker and the serious thinker.",1196380800,35,1405,4.756198347107438
2816172,5,B000PCMHEU,"It is a truly definitive historical look at the ""Dust Bowl"" era of an elderly couple & their home.  Not a family type movie..

2816182,4,B000PCMHEU,Good cast and good direction.  Based on the Erskine Caldwell novel and adopted from the long-running Broadway play based on the novel.  The film was made in 1940 and examines the issues of the period.  It reflects the history of the time in which it was produced.  Watch it to gain insight into the era.,1469318400,2,303,4.454545454545454

2816198,3,B000PCMHEU,"Set in rural Georgia during the Great Depression, a dirt poor tenant farmer (Charley Grapewin, WIZARD OF OZ) tries to hold on to his dying farm as the bank threatens to possess it. Rather than being based on the Erskine Caldwell novel, the film is based on the hit Broadway play of Caldwell's novel. At the time the film was made, it was the longest running play in Broadway history (over 3,000 performance and an eight year run). The film differs considerably from both the novel and the play. For some reason, the director John Ford decided to play it for laughs and the film plays out like a skewered episode of THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES. Caldwell showed an insight and an empathy for his poor white trash characters, here screenwriter Nunnally Johnson and Ford give us outrageous cornpone hillbilly stereotypes and with the exception of Elizabeth Patterson who gives a touching performance as Grapewin's wife, the acting is broad and buffoonish. And whose idea was it to cast the lovely and elegant Gene Tierney as a barefoot, dirt covered hillbilly nymph? With Dana Andrews, Marjorie Rambeau as psalm singing Sister Bessie, William Tracy, Grant Mitchell and Ward Bond, married to a 12 year old in the book but the movie ups her age to 13.

The DVD from Fox Brazil is a handsome looking B&W transfer in English with optional Portuguese subtitles.",1345420800,2,1348,4.810344827586207
2816199,1,B000PCMHEU,"Setting aside the HUGE liberties taken with adapting the Erskine Caldwell, and the good, but mis-cast, cast this is just a really BAD movie.  It is just odd to see a  serious (and controversial) novel turned into what is probably the precursor of the Beverly Hillbillies.  Grapewin's Jeeter is hard to feel sorry for despite the thick layers of slapstick, hillbilly humor he piles on.  And, William Tracy's Dude Lester has to be one of the most annoying movie characters in the history of cinema.  The oddest casting choice was Gene Tierney as Ellie May, who, in the book, is described as being a cleft-lipped horror.  Despite the heavy use of Tierney in film posters and ads her role in the movie is minimal too.  This can't be the highlight of her career.  This definitely isn't one of John Ford's better movies either.  Perhaps this movie offered something new  in 1941 when, maybe, the script writers had to turn to humor to avoid the Hollywood censors, but by modern standards it isn't very interesting.  There are plenty of other gritty films from the time that didn't turn to slapstick.  It is hard not to compare Tobacco Road to the later Beverly Hillbillies as it even has characters named Ellie May, Granny, etc.",1344902400,2,1222,4.712264150943396
2816200,5,B000PCMHEU,"I saw this movie on T.V and just loved it. I could so relate to some of the older generation, their look and mannerisms, like
Jedder's wife, so humble and tolerant, just wanted a little snuff, that's all she ask for. I wanted to share it with my husband and I am always hesitant to say how good a movie is because it sets it up, and then if he dosen't like it I am disappointed with his take on the movie. But, he really did like it, and we actually watched it twice, it is just as funny the next time. The front cover was in another language, so when it arrived my husband looked at it and said he thought it was in Spainish or something, but it was just imported, which of course we were very relieved that it was in English, and just what we wanted. This film was used, considered by the seller, (famious films) to be in very good condition, and that it was, couldn't even tell it was used. I really like the old movies, and just ordered another movie 'To Kill a Mockingbird' from this company, and was Very satisfied and just glad we have access to these old movies they are part of my grandson's education at my house, watching these old classics. I trade out with him by paying for a game on line, and in return, he has to watch the movie of my choice. It works well.",1339113600,12,1273,4.116465863453815
2816201,4,B000PCMHEU,"This is an underrated classic from director John Ford, which doesn't quite match ""The Grapes Of Wrath"" but has a wonderful touching affect all its own. Adapted (or some might say, cleansed) from Erskine Caldwell's novel and James Kirkland's Broadway play, concerning a backwoods, dirt-poor Georgia family who may soon lose their home and their land. Charlie Grapewin and Elizabeth Patterson give touching performances as Pa and Ma Lester, with only two of their many children who still reside with them. One is their supreme annoyance of a son, Dude (William Tracy), who becomes so irritating that I couldn't help but wish that someone would put him out of his misery. Gene Tierney plays their daughter, Ellie May, who pants after her brother-in-law, Lov (Ward Bond), who is smitten with her but is afraid to marry her. Enter Captain Tim Harmon (Dana Andrews), who assists the clan in preserving their land. Marjorie Rambeau's portrayal of Sister Bessie Rice is great also. Funny, touching, entertaining, interesting . . . . . . .

And getting to see Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews in an early film together before they were paired again later in their starring careers make this worth it for viewing alone.",1330214400,,1206,4.940886699507389
2816202,5,B000PCMHEU,"I have a feeling this movie was the basis for the Beverly Hillbillies, Tv Series.  There was an Ellie May barefoot young daughter, character with the name Ellie May, that the father wanted to marry off.  There was a strong, dumb Jethro-type character. Even a Granny-type character.  Except they live on an old Run-down family owned Tobacco Plantation, that no longer has any crop.  The actors are all really great.  It is a fun movie, with a solemn feel to it.  That is an indication of good Directing, and acting.  Something that no longer exsists in Hollywood.  This movie belongs in every movie collectors collection.  More comedy than drama, but enough balance of each to keep you glued to your movie seat.  It WAS a difficult movie to find.  I originally bought a fuzzy bootlegged copy of this in DVD online from a trading site a year ago, then Amazon came out with it, and I immediately upgraded.  Get this movie.  You WILL enjoy it.",1327708800,9,939,4.618181818181818

2816209,2,B000PCMHEU,"I've been reading a biography of John Ford this past couple of weeks and I decided to view some of his work that I hadn't seen before.  I rented ""Tobacco Road"" because it had promise as a successful Broadway play and an outstanding director.  It didn't take long before I realized that that was nowhere enough to salvage this turkey.  The acting is abrasive and so much so that Dana Andrews seems totally miscast with his calm, reassuring delivery.  The worst character is the son named Duke who screams, hollers and explodes.  There is no continuity to the script which seems to veer left and right at high speeds (just like Duke's driving).  I realize that this was intended to be a comedy (with social implications?) but the humor wasn't there.  The characters were to be pitied, not laughed at, and the scheming was more pathetic than innovative.  Everything was done for the good of the moment with no thought to the future.  Thus everytime we felt the least amount of sympathy or encouragement for the characters, we were reminded that these are idiots who won't put any effort into saving themselves so why should we put any effort into caring.  I'd characterize ""Tobacco Road as ""The Grapes of Wrath"" on helium but, then, that would be giving the script a credit it doesn't deserve.

Years ago I watched ""Donovan's Reef"" and realized that John Ford did not always succeed in making a good movie.  ""Tobacco Road"" shows his capability of actually making a bad movie.  Ford must have been out for revenge when he made this one.  I note the 6 previous reviews all give ""5 Stars""; to each his own.  Don't say I didn't warn you.",1246752000,7,1630,4.611111111111111
2816210,5,B000PCMHEU,I saw this movie a long - long time ago and never forgot it.  It's a really good thought provoking film with a lot of funny stuff in it.  Even though it is a foreign made DVD it works well.,1240876800,,189,3.7
2816211,5,B000PCMHEU,"One of the top 10 movies ever made. Another magnificent piece of art by John Ford. The South never looked as poetic, realistic, as here. You will cry as much as you laugh out loud. The respect for the old folk, the love for the soil, the humbleness of common people, the care and devotion to the land, to the people who toil the land, is depicted with artistic perfection.

I couldn't even blink watching the masterful art of John Ford. I even thought how banal, ridiculous are other so-called great classics compared to this one film. Welles, Hitchcock, Cukor, Wyler... everyone shrinks to the atom level when you compare their films to this gorgeous and heartwrenching film.

And then the script so wonderful, is like listening to poetry; and the faces (oh, Lord, the faces!). How he achieved those expressions in the camera is only miraculous. And, of course, the choir songs, the gospel chants... It's the final touch, Mr. Ford's signature. I hadn't seen this movie in years. Now I think it may be the best film ever.",1227484800,20,1021,4.666666666666667

8190512,5,B000PCMHEU,"Excellent classic film!
My all time favorite Rural American (Hillbilly) story.
I haven't read the book so I can't make comparisons, I'm not familiar with the stage play either.

Tremendous performances, insightful direction and sophisticated cinematography. Excellent production values.

Many outrageous characters, larger than life!
An obvious inspiration for the Beverly Hillbillies TV series, especially Ellie May.
These characters do inspire sympathy for their destitute plight, they are absurdly poor but this was real for some.
To be this desperate was considered comedy back in the day, I don't know how many can comprehend this now.
I find it hilarious myself because I can relate to a degree, I think most of us can at some point in our lives.
Both of my parents and their families are from low income areas of Kentucky and know adversity well.
My Dad's father developed Black Lung after working in the coal mines, Dad had to quit attending school and take his place to support the family. He was in the 6th grade.

Things seem a bit better these days.

This Region 2 release features a very good High Definition restoration which is nearly perfect but for the inconsistent brightness or contrast, it occasionally has a subtle flashing or wavering effect. It isn't annoying or disruptive, it just could be better.
This release also has more impressive video quality than the Region free NTSC Korean version being sold here at Amazon.
That version looks to be done on the cheap compared to this one.
This PAL video format version has a much more defined and stable picture despite being DVD 5, single layer.
The Spanish edition is sourced from the professional Twentieth Century Fox studio release.
DVDs are lower definition but the PAL format is slightly higher and this disc upscales almost perfectly, very near Bluray quality!

Menus for this release are in Spanish but original English Audio is included.
Subtitles are in Spanish.

An excellent release for this masterpiece film, the best I've seen yet.

This is the one to have, until a Bluray edition of course!

This review is based on the honest performance of this DVD title and a multi region Bluray player with 4K upscaling & 4K television.",1523059200,,2209,4.967479674796748
