8354930,2,B0027LZ0FA,"I subscribed to all access CBS through Amazon and have watched all of them except the ending ones which all say ""Unavailable?""  What!  No way would I want to pay for CBS when they don't make all available!  Amazon needs to fix this fast! CBS, should not be able to charge a monthly fee for this.  The show by the way is great. Just wish I could see all the episodes not just some.",1526428800,,380,4.094594594594595
8354931,1,B0027LZ0FA,"love the show but unclear as to why my ""all access pass"" only lets me watch part of the current season.  Its a month behind and won't go back to previous seasons.  I'm glad this is just a trial and I can cancel.",1520035200,4,211,3.883720930232558
8354932,2,B0027LZ0FA,"Like the show but disappointed that if I get CBS ""all access"" through Amazon channels I have to wait for episodes that I can get earlier on the CBS All Access directly. I have ROKU and amazon Fire and I was really surprised that even though I subscribed to CBS through Amazon I am still waiting almost a week now for the next two episodes 26 and 27 which is a 2 parter. I will now be suspect of ""Amazon Channels"" from now on and just use apps directly for networks I want to watch. DISAPPOINTED.",1519948800,5,495,4.166666666666667
8354933,5,B0027LZ0FA,I love these episodes and some I've followed in the past. I got to see the final conviction of a creepy old rapist/MurdererCatholic priest. Natalie Wood and new evidence pointing the crime to Robert Wagner. These reporters on 48  Hours keep digging at the truth. Amazing true crime stories and real insight into our criminal justice system.,1518825600,,340,4.964912280701754
