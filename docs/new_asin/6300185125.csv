220789,5,6300185125,"This is one of my favorite romantic/screwball films of all time. It such a  neat blend of clever comedy and dialogue. Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck  are terrific- I mean it's a flawless film! Preston Sturges has done some  excellent films(Sullivan's Travels, Palm Beach Story, Miracle at Morgan's  Creek), but this one has really got to be my all time favorite. Show it to  someone you love!",969235200,2,394,4.82089552238806
220790,5,6300185125,"Preston Sturges's first big budget film with  superstars Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda is one of the director's most successful and often imitated  movies.  Stanwyck and Charles Coburn masquerading as daughter and father,  make a living as card sharps, taking advantage of the rich and famous  aboard transatlantic luxury liners.  Along comes Charles Pike (Fonda), the  heir to Pike's Ale (the Ale that won at Yale!), and Jean (Stanwyck)  immediately sizes him up as an easy mark.  To reveal too much of the plot  would spoil the fun.  Stanwyck and Fonda appear to be having the time of  their lives, each digging into their roles with verve and gusto.  Fonda is  especially amusing showing off his excellent physical comedy skills,  heretofore unknown.  And Stanwyck proves once again, that when it comes to  portraying tough-minded women who chuck it all for love, she's in a class  by herself.  Filled with the usual Sturges stock company, Eugene Pallette  (simply hysterical as Fonda's father), William Demarest, Eric Blore, Robert  Greig, all giving wonderful comic performances.  The Lady Eve is one of  those pictures that grows more endearing with each viewing.",966384000,4,1172,5.149732620320855
220791,5,6300185125,"Henry Fonda was never better. Stanwyck is superb with a supporting cast that really shines.
The plot is wonderful and zany and you can forget things like Eugene Pallette being Fonda,s father. Bill Demerest is worth  the price of a rental alone. Charles Coburn and Melville Cooper are just  deft in their comedic roles. Preston Sturges,always seems to have funny  lines laced with wit and irony for even the smallest actor in each  scene.
At the end of the film you,ll want to watch again to make sure you  caught all the double entendre. Sheer Magic...and if you want the magic to  continue...try "" The Great McGinty"" "" Hail The Conquering  Hero"" "" Miracle at Morgans Creek"" etc.
PS two of his non  director films are on video also  "" Remember The Night"" and Easy  Living""  MAGIC TIME",963792000,2,784,4.608695652173913
220792,5,6300185125,"Great for Barbara Stanwick fans. One of the best comedies of the 40's by one of the best (if not the best) comedy-filmaker of the 40's. Preston Sturges best film (The Miracle On Morgan's Creek is an ultra-close second).  This movie is extremely entertainig, Hilarious and a lot of Fun. From a  scale of 1-10 I give it a 9.",950659200,,322,4.35
220793,5,6300185125,"Barbara Stanwyck is terrific as a lady card shark who first teases then falls in love with a professor of snakes (!) played by Henry Fonda. Stanwyck plays her role in a refreshingly modern way; her Jean is alternately cynical, tender, vulnerable, seductive and always believable. Charles Coburn is great as her con-artist Dad (he says to Jean: ""Let us be crooked but never common"" and when she falls for Fonda, Coburn laments ""Children don't respect their parents anymore"". The New York Times chose ""The Lady Eve"" as the best picture of 1941. This film proves that Stanwyck was more versatile than is generally remembered (she's better known for her hard-boiled characterizations).",944265600,,681,5.089285714285714
220794,5,6300185125,"This is one of the best romantic screwball comedies. Though it failed to really grab me the first time, the second viewing had me laughing. Barbara Stanwyck is perfect. If only she had done more comedies. The best, and the  most romantic scenes occur when Barbara is the cardsharp Jean. Pretty hot  too, when Henry is putting on Barbara's shoe, and when they discuss their  ideal partners. No wonder Henry has said that he's been in love with  Barbara since this film. Fluff this may seem to some, but Lady Eve is a  well crafted, cleverly written and directed film, intelligently put  together by real first class pros. Preston Sturges was one mad-cap talented  man who really knew how to write. My favourite script of his, however, is  ""Remember The Night"", a little known film, but what a knockout it  is. And as great as Barbara and Hank are together in this film, I believe  they were even funnier in that wonderful gem ""The Mad Miss  Manton(1938)"". However, this is truely sophisticated stuff and an  essential video to have in any collection.",942883200,16,1049,4.7032967032967035
220795,5,6300185125,"It's hard to believe that some people who see this film don't get the point (this is another way of saying that this brand of comedy is not for a generation weaned on The Beaver and the Brady's).  If you thought that the  laugh track on The Brady Bunch was real, you should stay away from the  films of Preston Sturges, whose cerebral wit in ""The Lady Eve""  and other films is strictly for true cynics who secretly wish they could be  idealists.  The cast is terrific, and Charles Coburn steals scenes so  subtley you wonder why he didn't appear in more films (maybe that's why).  The weakest part of the movie is Miss Stanwyck's wooden face and her habit  of either over- or under-acting -- but for some of Mr. Sturges' dry-witted  lines, this works quite well.  The Sturges comedies were the nearest  american equivalent to the dry British social satires of the 20's and 30's.  Certainly, Hollywood wouldn't have the nerve to make such a film today.  Critics are in error, though, when they class this strictly as a  ""screwball comedy"".  Sturges, as a writer and director, went past  screwball and toward the sublime, where at least a modicum of worldly (and  world-weary) awareness is involved.  Not only was this movie ahead of its  time, it may still be too advanced for the current generation.  The  honeymoon scene in the Pullman car is hysterical, and so is Mr. Coburn's  line when someone suggests that Eve should open one of the train's windows.",940550400,4,1455,4.641732283464567
220867,5,6300185125,"The Lady Eve is my favorite Barbara Stanwyck movie.  Even though she was nominated for another film in 1941, I think she should have won the Oscar for this one.  Since this is from the higher priced Criterion Collection, I was expecting a restored sharp, crisp black and white print.  In fact, on the back of the box, it reads:  ""Sparkling new digital transfer.""  What I got is what looks like a soft-focused VHS transfer.  I know that Paramount has stated that their studio is not interested in restoring old movies, and they want to devote their time and energy to newer films on DVD or Blu-ray, but I honestly thought The Criterion Collection would take it upon themselves to restore it.  Rather than 22 bucks, this is worth about $8.95.  If you love this picture as much as I do, it may not matter.  It is one of the best comedies from Preston Sturges!",1495238400,,856,4.470967741935484

Yes, this transfer was created over 15 years ago, but there are other classic movies on DVD (from same time period) with much better video.

220914,2,6300185125,"To my surprise, I didn't like this film at all, as I found the story unpleasant and wrong. I am quite surprised that it is considered so highly by most of the public and reviewers. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.

Jean Harrington (Barbara Stanwyck) is a con artist. Along with her father, ""Colonel"" Harrington (Charles Coburn) and his partner Gerald (Melville Cooper), she targets a very naive rich young man, Charles Pike (Henry Fonda), son of beer magnat Horace Pike (Eugene Pallette). The crooks, posing as rich passengers, attack their prey on board of a liner... They initially want just cheat Pike in a game of cards, but soon Jean sees a better opportunity. I will not say more about the story to avoid spoilers.

The film is well directed, actors did a great job, there are some clever one liners and also some good moments of humour. However I couldn't really enjoy all the treasures of this film, because of some fundamental flaws in the scenario.

The first problem I have with this film is that the main male character, Charles Pike, is a pathetic moron, so insanely stupid, clueless and hapless, that the only thing one can feel towards him is pity mixed with contempt. How can you make anybody believe that any woman can spend her life with such a man without deep inside despising him? The man is cheated three times by the same people, in exactly the same way, without even really realising it! I didn't find the complete destruction of this character funny - at all.

The main female character on another hand is a very, very clever person but she is also a cold, calculating, merciless reptile, with a sadistic streak. The result of pairing such a woman with a man who has the wits and conscience of a 5 years old boy is not romantism - it is actually embarassing...

The third reason why I didn't like the film is the sympathetic way in which con artists are portrayed. It shocked me. Con artists are not a joking matter and showing them as ""cool guys"" who win at the end and everybody is happy is not a good thing - those people cause real damage and pain. Using them as comedy characters is a good idea, but letting them completely off the hook at the end and leaving them smiling and counting their loot is, for me, a disturbing thing. There is fair and then there is not fair.

Finally, there is the ending and the conclusion of the film, which I found as INSANELY WRONG as possible. In fact it INFURIATED ME! Bad people win, big time and a honest (although stupid) man is left without honor, with the stain of being f...ed three times by the same person all over his body and mind. I found the ending HATEFUL. I will not keep the DVD. The film presents some interest as part of the cinema history, but me at least, I didn't have much fun weatching it.",1465948800,,2794,4.468627450980392

Fonda plays a naive rich guy, taken to the cleaners by con artist Stanwyck who falls in love in spite of herself.

221045,5,6300185125,"... and probably my favorite A-list film. Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda display such chemistry and play off of each other so perfectly, and I have to credit director Preston Sturges, because in another pairing of the two at about the same time, in ""You Belong to Me"", their chemistry - heck the whole movie - just landed with a thud.

Fonda plays Charles, somebody born to wealth, and therefore with the leisure to do whatever he wants to do without thinking about the beauty of his situation. Charles chooses to study snakes. His no-nonsense self-made man father, perfectly played by Eugene Palette, holds his egg head son in only medium esteem, to quote another film, and has therefore assigned tough guy Muggsy (William Demarest) to be his body guard since he somewhat rightly perceives that Charles has no common sense or survival instincts. Charles is nave, Jean (Stanwyck) is a con-woman wise in the ways of the world. She starts out to fleece the guy at cards when they find themselves on the same ship, but falls in love with him in spite of herself. When Charles finds out Jean is a con artist, he rejects her and she vows revenge, which she gets in the most imaginative way possible, all the while claiming that she doesn't love Charles anymore - but she does. She is a young woman wise to the ""tells"" in everybody else but blind to her own true feelings.

Eric Blore, usually given to expressing himself with looks and one liners, is given a rather intricate story to tell at a crucial moment in the film and carries it off wonderfully. William Demarest has never been funnier, and poor Charles gets no end of grief from his father. Sure he's clumsy, but at one point he's blamed for having the main course dumped in his lap at a dinner party caused by two servants fighting over who is going to serve the main course.

I won't give away any more, because the story is truly part of the delight here, but just let it be said that Jean teaches Charles that you can't tell what is in the present by looking at the wrapping paper, although the real moral of this film is that people in love believe what that want to believe. Highly recommended.",1428796800,,2156,4.523076923076923

Other reviewers have covered the story so I won't bother getting into the storyline, but I do believe Ms Stanwyck does well in comedy roles.  I had waited a long while for the price on this DVD to come down.  I finally happened on The Barbara Stanwyck Collection on TCM, which has 4 movies (The Lady Eve / Double Indemnity / All I desire / There's Always Tomorrow).  I was able to buy the 4 movie set for under $15 in January 2015.  I'm thrilled to be find this movie set for considerably less.

All those films have a little more humor, a little more heart, and bang up performances by the usual cast of crazies.

221165,5,6300185125,"I may be biased, but this is my favorite movie. This is the movie that made me love Barbara Stanwyck and old movies. The scene Jean (Stanwyck) looks into her mirror and begins to dictate the unassuming Hopsie's (Fonda) life showed me the kind of power Stanwyck could have over an audience as an actress, and Sturges could as a writer/director. This may be the most perfect pairing in Hollywood there ever was.

It's hard to find anything more to add to the vast discussions of Preston Sturges' comedic masterpiece. Stanwyck and Fonda are the definition of chemistry. The movie is the perfect length, and never drags as some great, old Hollywood films do. The transfer is sparklingly beautiful; you'll never see Stanwyck in a better light. The extras on here are excellent: especially the commentary by film scholar Marian Keane who explores the movies themes more profoundly.

I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys screwball films, beautiful costumes, pratfalls, or saucy dames.
Other Stanwyck films I would recommend are Stella Dallas (1937), Christmas in Connecticut (1944). The Mad Miss Manton (1938), and No Man of Her Own (1950). Other screwballs I would recommend are Bringing Up Baby (1938), The Crystal Ball (1943), The Women (1939), My Man Godfrey (1936), and Nothing Sacred (1937). And I would recommend Sturges' equally funny films The Miracle of Morgan's Creek (1944) and The Palm Beach Story (1942).

Barbara Stanwyck is terrific in the role of con artist Jean Harrington who, together with her father, played by veteran actor Charles Coburn, sets out to fleece Charles Pike, a young, shy, bookish millionaire played by the young and handsome Henry Fonda, while on a South American cruise.  The only problem is that they actually do fall in love with each other, and the con is called off.

Unfortunately, the path of true love never runs smoothly. When Pike's general factotum, Mugsy, played with comic intensity by character actor, William Demerast, discovers that Jean is a con artist, this sets into motion a series of comedic plot developments and amusing misunderstandings.

Having grown up with her as an older actress on television and jaded by the only film performance I had ever screened her in, portraying a villainess - I had no idea she was spunky, zesty, and so vivaciously sensual in her prime.

Rented because of her co-star, Henry Fonda and the Sturges pedigree. It was a queue suggestion that, very much like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bride-Came-C-O-D/dp/B000MTEFW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bride Came C.O.D.</a>"", I resisted and avoided until there was nothing left on the virtual e-shelf. And just like that wonderful Cagney/Davis film, I came to deeply regret waiting so long to screen this hilarious production. (one that I eventually purchased as well)

Stanwyck plays Jean Harrington, a con artist. Along with her father and uncle, played by veteran movie manipulator Charles Coburn and the dry witted Melville Cooper respectively, make up their three-person team of grifters who ply their shenanigans on the voyaging steamships of the day. Like the wind-up watch, it's difficult for this generation to comprehend that, prior to the 1950s, traveling by boat was the primary public-accessible method of moving from continent to continent. And people today who are prone to complaining about air travel taking so long, would undoubtedly have a conniption fit taking two-to-four weeks to reach their destination, one way.

It's on one of these luxurious journeys that, quite unexpectedly, a target of opportunity has presented himself: Charles ""Hopsie"" Pike, scion and heir to a brewing empire. Played to a perfect tee by Fonda, who is cast as a quiet introspective academic wanting nothing to do with the family business or it's money; preferring instead to explore the jungles of South America in the pursuit of his beloved snakes. And notably, he assiduously avoids female dalliances. It's pretty clear he's been hurt in the past and correctly presumes most of the attention he garners is being driven by shallow greed and the blatantly devious plans of women attempting to snare a wealthy man.

Jean realizes that the 'come hither' approach is all wrong. He's not going to be beguiled by a pretty set of eyes, alluring body or coquettish smile. No, the direct approach won't work. Like all grifters, she's skilled at reading people, and she knows that she'll have to approach her mark obliquely; make him come to her, not the other way around. The scene that plays all this out is incredibly hilarious. Jean watches from the sidelines as a horde of women try every trick in the book, some virtually throwing themselves at Charles' feet. And it's via feet, or more specifically a foot, by which she sets her hook.

This scenario also explains why so many folks fall for a co-worker. Humans naturally gravitate to pair bonding with people we see every day -or- are stuck seeing every day. This movie is a genuinely fun example of that.  And despite pleas from her partners to not get emotionally involved with their mark, she can't help herself. By end of their first journey (there's a second) they've fallen in love.

But there's a glitch. Hopsie has no clue how Jean makes her living. So she intends to rectify that with the absolute truth. Let the chips fall where they may and hope that their love will carry the day.

It might've worked. If she wasn't beaten to the punch by his valet/assistant/bodyguard played by constant sour-faced William Demerest. Convinced now more than ever that he'll never find true love, or at least an honest woman; and believing he had once again been caught in a honey trap - our man quietly goes home alone.

However, being abandoned has left Jean more than just angry. She, like Hopsie, let her guard down and truly fell in love. Now she's a woman scorned and hellbent on payback. And she intends to use her grift skills pushed to their uppermost limits in order to get even with her former love.

Her plan: Take another run on Charles ""No-Longer-Her-Hopsie"" Pike - by creating another persona, Lady Eve Sedwich from Great Britain.

Can she convince him that she's a completely different woman? And what does Jean/Eve's ultimate revenge entail?

Timeless and extraordinarily funny, especially if you're a fan of true love conquering all.",1317340800,3,4380,5.0428769017980635
221260,4,6300185125,"The first 50 minutes of The Lady Eve is the best moviemaking Preston Sturges or almost any other director ever did, thanks largely to Barbara Stanwyck's brilliant performance. She was never this good in any other movie, nor did Sturges ever find another actress this good to play his heroines.

When I think of Betty Hutton, Claudette Colbert, and the others he worked with, I have to lower the bar a lot to appreciate their performances; but Stanwyck pushes me far beyond any expectations I had going into the movie. She is smart, feisty, sexy, complex, continually surprising and delightful, the perfect channel for Sturges's eccentric genius.

It's too bad they worked together only this one time. Even actresses much better known for screwball comedy than Stanwyck was - Katharine Hepburn and Rosalind Russell come to mind - were never as good as Stanwyck is here.

Henry Fonda - as always - plays Henry Fonda, a likeable enough dimwit, and at least he never gets in the way of Stanwyck's brilliance. But then the big switch comes midway through the movie, and the marvelously complex Jean becomes the incredibly shallow, dumb and annoying Eve, with one of the worst British accents ever filmed. And the movie becomes just another screwball comedy - not even Sturges's best screwball comedy: The Palm Beach Story gets that honor.

If the first half of The Lady Eve had not been so extraordinary, the last half might not seem so mediocre: it's probably as good as the whole of almost any other screwball comedy - but after Jean, Eve is just too dumb to enjoy. So I enthusiastically recommend watching The Lady Eve until the lady Eve appears, and then swapping it out for something else.

221262,5,6300185125,"I'm not entirely familiar with Preston Sturges's work, but watching `The Lady Eve' gave me that giddy excitement that I had when watching some of the older Ernst Lubitsch comedies.  It is sharp, witty and delightfully `merry' in tone, a comedy that is elevated from the material by marvelous performances.

In particular, Barbara Stanwyck, but I'll get to her in a minute.

The film tells the story of Jean and her father Harry, professional card players who board a cruise ship in hopes to swindle money off of Charles Pike, heir to his father's ale (not beer) fortunes.  Things get complicated when Charles falls in love with Jean.  Things get even more complicated when Jean falls in love with Charles.

The film has it's fair share of clichs, but the material is so rich with witty dialog and thick comedic timing that you forgive the familiarity with the plot (they fall in love, they fight, they reunite) and the redundancy of some of the gags (Fonda falls an awful lot).  Helping you `forgive' is Sturges's steady directorial hand.  He really uses his actors and his surroundings effortlessly, and he penned the script, so he makes effort to push the envelope so-to-speak, creating something that feels edgy as apposed to safe.  In this way, he helps stretch himself out of the box, away from any easy comparisons to other films of this nature.

But this film would have been nothing without actors who understood how to make this film something special.  Henry Fonda is perfectly doting as Charles Pike.  He bleeds of pure desperation as he pines over Jean, the sultry woman who won't just give herself to him.  Is it just me or does he look a little heavier here than in most of his other films?  I don't mean overweight, but it was nice to see his face looking fuller.  Most films I've seen with Fonda, he looks almost too thin.  Charles Coburn is delightful as Harry, Jean's father, and Pallette is believably smitten as Horace, Charles father.

And yes, William Demarest has some of the best lines in the film.

But, in the end there can only be one real standout here, and that is undoubtedly Barbara Stanwyck.  I'm going to just say this right here and now; this is one of the best performances of all time; period.  Stanwyck writes the book on witty, charismatic, charming, seductive and endearing.  She is the perfect tease, and she teases the audience as much as she teases Fonda.  Her comedic timing is outstanding, expertly finding the depth of each gag, and she never once misses a beat when it comes to displaying the emotional side of her characters journey.  You believe her, every step of the way.

With an ending that nearly had me cheering, `The Lady Eve' is a near pitch-perfect comedy that will keep you thoroughly entertained!",1269475200,6,2755,4.703549060542797
221263,5,6300185125,"The Lady Eve (1941) is a screwball comedy about a man and a woman who meet on a cruise played by Henry Fonda and Barbra Stanwyck.  In 1994 the film was preserved by the United States Library of congress by meeting their guidelines of being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". The Lady Eve continues standing the test of time as an influential piece of cinema in the department of romantic comedy.

Like all screwball comedies the pair is mismatched from the start of their adventure.  Jean Harrington (Stanwyck) is an expert con artist who plans to scam the rich (not to mention nave) Charles Pike (Fonda) who works as a snake expert.  Unexpectedly the two meet on a luxury liner.  She is on her way to scam him and he is on his way back from a trip he had taken down the Amazon for the study of snakes.  They fall in love so that when they reach the mainland Harrington finds it hard to go through with her plan (but boy, does she sure try to go through with it to the best of her ability).

Unlike other films, like It Happened One Night, The Lady Eve is a much more fanciful film, both in its tone as well as its characters.  From its animated opening with a snake whose tail is firmly wrapped around a rattle the audience can tell they're in for some fun.  While It Happened One Night certainly set-up guidelines for the screwball sub-genre, The Lady Eve seems to drive home the fun aspect of it by pumping up the differences between its characters to the point that realism is lost in place of purely fun antics - which is in no way a bad thing.  In fact the fact that it doesn't try to be anything other than good comedy is the best part.  Often romantic comedies try to cause serious drama during their climax, but not The Lady Eve.  A conflict between the two leads does arise, but they never seem to take it seriously.

Some slapstick might be a tad dated, but for the most part The Lady Eve is a lasting gem for the comedy genre.  It revels in its fantasy and the crew of the film seems to have enjoyed its production judging by what we see on screen.

The Lady Eve is not to be missed by any generation.",1267660800,2,2136,4.305
221264,5,6300185125,"Preston Sturges dominated cinema comedy in the early 1940s and finished off the competition with several films that took the genre to a new place others have tried to reach, rarely successfully, ever since.  His ability to combine slapstick with some of the subtlest eye gags and dialogue wit is breathtaking in this example of his work. He leads and deceives the audience with such a sure touch - only the director is more conniving than the con-men and con-women who dominate the story. Stanwyck is fabulous - sexy, yes, as others have noted (with expressed surprise). Fonda is the perfect prat (not so unsuspecting as to be vacuous). The supporting cast features many of the great character actors of the time. Coburn as the elder card shark delivers the deadpan stuff with his usual perfect pitch. This is a genuine laugh-out-loud comedy (the scene with the horse is a hoot) - but, if you aren't in tears from the humour (at a couple of points Fonda is unable to suppress a smile), you will marvel observing the amazing skill of the ringmaster.

It is a silly romp but charming, very charming.

In the process of seducing him Eve ends up falling for him. However, when Fonda's character discovers her criminal ways, Eve must use her con artist talents to get him back.

Stanwyck and Coburn are great, and I loved watching them interact, especially when Stanwyck's character was trying to foil Corburn's attempt to cheat at cards. If the movie had more of that dynamic, I think I would have enjoyed it more. Since Coburn's character is absent most of the second half of the film and Stanwyck's character is playing a role different from her original one as the smoldering seductress, the element that captures your interest in the first half of the movie largely disappear by the second half.

The movie falters for me when it comes to Eve falling for Fonda's character. There is no reason why she should have fallen for him. He is shy, awkward, boring, and naive. He doesn't seem to distinguish himself from her other victims. She falls in love with him in a short amount of time, but there is no transition from target who she intends to fleece in cards to love interest. You don't realize there has been a change until she explicitly say so. She does offer one reason why she falls in love with him-- it was fun seeing him show her father a card trick. Well, since her father knows card tricks himself, I don't see why that would impress her. It could be the irony of Fonda's character unknowingly showing off a simple card trick to the master that amuses her, but again, I don't see why his naivete would make him more attractive than any of her other targets. If Fonda's character wasn't such a dolt, I think I would like the movie more because then her falling for him would have been believable.

Neither does Fonda seem to have the knack for screwball comedy that, say Carey Grant, does. Even when he does something crazy like trip over a sofa, it comes across as more awkward than funny.

I love old movies, but this movie didn't strike me as very funny. If you're looking for a great old comedy I would suggest something more like His Girl Friday, Arsenic and Old Lace, or It Happened One Night.

Okay, moment of truth, moment of classic screwball truth anyway, women have been laying traps to ensnare men since, well, since Eve, and maybe before. And that premise drives this film entitled, ah, as if to put paid to that point, The Lady Eve, directed by the king of classic Hollywood screwball comedy (Sullivan's Travels, among others). Of course if one went with the original story, that old Adam and Eve ensnarement story we would have a very short film, very short indeed and so Brother Sturges has flesh the piece out a bit.

He does that stretching by having Barbara Stanwyck (last heard from in this space leading Fred MacMurray down another garden path as a femme fatale in the film adaptation of James M. Cain's Double Indemnity) put on her sophisticated comedic best as a professional card-shark, a roper for her shark father, travelling the Atlantic sea-lanes in search of, well, in search of the big chance haul. And to show that those wearisome trans-Atlantic rides on some old tub were well worth the effort she took dead aim at the scattered-brained scion of a brewing fortune, a role played by Henry Fonda who was heading home from a year down in the Amazon looking, well, let's keep with the metaphor, snakes. Yeah, easy picking for a world- weary traveler like our Barbara.

Here is the hitch though while trying to fleece Henry she, well, she falls in love with the goof and so all bets are off, literally. The problem is that other protective forces put Henry wise to her gang of ship-board hustlers and so all marriage bets are off. But one should be very, very careful with a woman scorned because all hell is likely to break loose. And it does as Barbara seeks to ensnare Henry one more time this time by doing an impersonation as the well-born Lady Eve (Sidley if you are asking) in his hometown. Needless to say our goof falls, falls hard, and marries our Lady Eve. Only to find out on their honeymoon once Barbara told him that she was basically a tramp in furtherance of her revenge. So the goof leaves her again. Seeing that revenge wasn't so sweet after all Barbara has something else up her sleeve. Watch the film to find out what that stratagem is. In the meantime remember this-women have been trying lay traps to ensnare men ever since Adam and Eve, maybe before. Got it.

Original review

The 1930's and 1940's were the hay days of the innocent screwball comedy and the `king of the hill' director of many of them was one Preston Sturgis. The Lady Eve represents one of his better efforts. The plot line is fairly simple- boy meets girl, magic, a little plot twist where things go topsy-turvy, a little emotional reverse twist and in the end boy gets girl, girl gets boy. It is the way that this is done that makes this film above the run of the mill manifestations of this theme. Barbara  Stanwyck is steamy as `gold digger' /Lady Eve. Henry Fonda is, well Henry Fonda, the boy next door, if your neighbor is Rockefeller. The gags and gaffs roll right along. If you like your humor dark stay away. If you like your humor and romance light, and you want to know what helped people through the Depression and World War II on the screen, watch on.",1199318400,,3195,4.547826086956522
221336,2,6300185125,"This movie is renowned as Preston Sturges' masterpiece. The first half is certainly excellent.  The jokes and innuendo come thick and fast as a man and a woman meet on a cruise ship and begin a complex, sexually charged game of cat and mouse. Barbara Stanwyck is scorchingly sexy as the witty, confident con woman who sees an easy mark in Henry Fonda's nerdy millionare scientist. Fonda is equally good, projecting a shy, awkward air, but gradually we warm to him as he falls in love with the woman who's aiming for his wallet, and she begins to fall for him. Together they have amazing chemistry and make every scene they're in sparkle. We start to root for this couple to have a happy ending, even though we know someday Fonda will have to learn the painful truth.

When the action leaves the ship it's like a switch has been turned off. The movie starts to drag and resort to painfully unfunny slapstick (Fonda gets something spilled on him at least three times. What hilarity!). The magical suspension of disbelief that was created so effortlessly during the first half is shattered by a truly ridiculous plot device.

The chemistry between the two leads evaporates as Stanwyck becomes shrill and obnoxious and Fonda dull and non-responsive. The ending resolves the buildup through the clever device of ignoring the consequences of everything that happened in the last third of the movie. It left me hating the characters and wishing that the first half hadn't been so damn good.

I do plan on seeing more of Preston Sturges' movies in the hope that he was capable of creating a second act that matched the first, but The Lady Eve is only half of an awesome movie.",1194566400,5,1668,4.6825938566552905

221339,5,6300185125,"You know, most of the time if you watch a screwball comedy from back in the day you go into it expecting unrealistic dialog and somewhat predictable plot twists.  Many of the best classic movies are classics only because of the chemistry of the stars.

That's not the case at all with this movie.  As a screenwriter, Preston Sturges (who also directed) was way ahead of his time.  You still have the snappy, quick dialog between characters.  Barbara Stanwyck seems to speak 1000 words per minute.  But the dialog never seems forced.  You never feel like the characters are only speaking to set up the next joke.

The plot is what you'd expect from a romantic comedy--Stanwyck is a gold digger who's out to swindle a naive, rich man--Henry Fonda.  But she ends up falling for him, just as he realizes her game.  In a typical movie you'd expect her to attempt and win him back right away through a series of funny, unsuccessful acts--but that's not what happens here.  Instead the plot takes a turn towards black comedy for a bit before Fonda and Stanwyck ultimately get together.

The twists are pretty unpredictable and the second half of the movie is really where you find all the laughs, with the first 30 minutes setting things up.  If you like movies like ""Bringing Up Baby"" or ""His Girl Friday,"" then you'll love this.",1171152000,5,1323,4.626609442060086

This Criterion offering is expensive but there is so much on offer. Thanks so much.

The film itself is perfect - script, direction, acting, photography, costumes, score - the lot. You can't help feel too that they had a ball making it. The rapport of the leads is palpable. The plot involves the seduction, twice, of a naive millionaire by a sexy card sharp. The dialogue is very clever and Henry Fonda performs at least 3 hilarious pratfalls. Stanwyck performs a marvellous imitation of an English Lady and although she is very attractive and amusing, there is a cynicism at the heart of her performance which conveys much deeper emotions. When she is sad, she is deeply moving.

With all those great players, it is probably churlish to single out Stanwyck but, what the hell, the title of the film refers to her and for anyone familiar with the cold hard Barbara from so many other films, the sexy and attractive Barbara here is a revelation. She is unique and memorable.

The commentary attached to the DVD is a scholarly analysis of the script and direction, carefully noting all the undercurrents and cynicism of Sturges world. While it leaves no stone unturned in the pursuit of the potential of Sturge's ideas, it misses the opportunity to simply ""sit back, relax and enjoy the comedy"". Overanalysis can kill the spontaneity and at times the thought process of the commentator is a bit obscure.  Peter Bogdanavich's interview is more laid back and therefore easier to enjoy.

221357,4,6300185125,"The Lady Eve is a movie that has a universal appeal.  People all over the world can relate to its message.  In my review I'd like to not only discuss the message of The Lady Eve but to also discuss a form of criticism called ""sociological criticism"" and use it to analyze the movie The Lady Eve.  After discussing the sociological critic's point of view, I will apply its criticism to the movie The Lady Eve and I will discuss whether or not the sociological critic would approve of the content of its text.  This review will allow you to understand sociological criticism and use its criteria to critique any form of text.

To understand sociological criticism it's important to know what factors the sociological critic considers when analyzing text.  Sociological criticism analyzes, evaluates and interprets text from the perspective of a particular social group.  It asks, ""How does the text reflect the plight, concerns, and likes of different sociological groups such as young people, senior citizens, women, the rich, the poor, homosexuals, etc?""  In other words, sociological criticism looks at how text affects particular sociological groups in society.

  To begin this review of The Lady Eve it is necessary to start of with a brief synopsis of the movie.  The Lady Eve starred Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck.  Fonda plays Charles Pike, the clumsy, snake-loving son of a wealthy brewer.  Stanwyck plays Jean Harrington, a beautiful, fast-talking hustler.  The movie starts out with a scene of Charles in the Amazon preparing to return home with a rare breed of snake.  Jean and her father happen to be on the same ship as Charles and they plan to hustle him with their card-playing skills.  While trying to scam Charles out of his money, Jean falls in love with him as does he with her.  Jean abandons her schemes to rob Charles to the dismay of her father.  As soon as everything seemed to be going well with the couple, Charles found out the true identity of Jean and her father and didn't want to have anything to do with them.  Jean asked for forgiveness but Charles was too upset to grant it.  While they were apart they longed for each other, but Jean wanted revenge for the heartache Charles caused her.  Jean later disguised herself as a duchess to see Charles again.  Charles married the duchess not knowing she was really Jean.  While they were married Jean, under the guise of a duchess, tortured Charles by telling him she had been with many men before her marriage to him.  Charles got so upset that he decided to divorce the duchess.  Later Jean revealed her true identity to Charles and they kissed and realized that they belonged together.

I think the two main characters best represent the sociological group of young people.  Both characters were young and as the movie shows, the two experienced some of the stereotypical antics of young people in love.  I believe that still today a lot of young people can relate to what Jean and Charles went through.  An interesting characteristic of this movie and most romantic comedies is that the man and woman bound to fall in love are two very different people.  Their personalities and characters are so different as to destroy the audience's hope of the two ever getting together.  I think that still today most young people would say that opposites attract.  A lot of young, wholesome girls and women are looking for flashy, fast-talking boys and men because they're exciting to them as Jean was to Charles in this movie.  This situation is seen in The Lady Eve except the female is the flashy, fast-talking love interest and the male quiet and wholesome.  Charles is a quiet, clumsy man.  He is shy and has a passion for reptiles and nature.  He has a heart of gold, but is by no means ""Casanova"" when it comes to women.  Jean, on the other hand, is quit the opposite of Charles.  She is a fast-talking woman with what would be considered a ""vulgar"" mouth in past times.  She is very forward and has a dominating personality.  Despite their different personalities, Charles and Jean fall in love with each other.  There were also many obstacles keeping the two from being together.  Charles found out about Jean's scam to rob him and he was angered.  It seemed as though his anger and her resentment denied all possibilities of them becoming a couple.  In The Lady Eve, the male and female don't compromise their individual identities, they only complete each others.  The trials that befall them only make their love stronger and make them more deserving of each other.

A lot of young people throughout history have defied the ""rules"" of love imposed upon them.  A classical example of this defiance comes from the story of Romeo and Juliet.  Romeo and Juliet were two young people from families who were enemies.  The danger of being together only made their love stronger.  Another example of young love similar to The Lady Eve can be seen in Aladdin.  Aladdin was a poor, young boy who fell in love with a beautiful princess named Jasmine.  The law of their land was that royalty was only to marry royalty.  Aladdin and Jasmin's love changed this archaic law as the end of the movie shows.  Today we see young people of different races dating, marrying and having children.  Interracial dating is something that only fifty years ago was forbidden.  In some places it is still looked down upon today but the number of interracial couples has grown greatly and continues to grow today.  There is also a stigma placed on homosexual couples.  Years ago couples of the same sex had to hide their love in fear of being killed or severely injured if they were ever found out.  There is still a heavy stigma on homosexual couples today although homosexuals have made great strides in fighting for their rights.  Today homosexual couples no longer have to hide their love.  The work to allow gay marriage is being oppressed by the religious powers that be but young people are making it known that this oppression will soon change.

The Lady Eve is a movie that appeals to young people.  It shows that despite whatever differences there are between two people in love, love always prevails.  The sociological critic would say that this movie's text speaks to young people and it represents their plight to break the archaic stereotypes of relationships.  The Lady Eve's text tells young people that it's alright to love whoever they want no matter their race, gender, or socioeconomic status.  That is why I believe the sociological critic approves of The Lady Eve's text.",1118620800,,6549,4.76779359430605

In *Stella Dallas* and other weepie dramas, Stanwyck did method acting before method acting was invented.  In *The Lady Eve,* Stanwyck proved herself an equally adroit comedic actress with her perfect timing and crackerjack wit.  You can barely blame Henry Fonda for tripping all over himself and staring--just staring--slack-jawed at Barbara throughout the entire movie.

221361,5,6300185125,"I recently discovered the NY Times list of ""1000 best films ever,"" and if not for that list I would have never seen ""The Lady Eve.""  As a child of the '70s the names Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda conjure up dramatic images of ""The Big Valley"" and ""The Grapes of Wrath,"" not exactly the kind of thing I'd go out of my way to see.  With the Times's recommendation, however, I decided to give this 1941 film a look.

Imagine my surprise to find Fonda showing such a wonderful flair for comedy!  Having some familiarity with film history, I knew that Stanwyck in her day had been quite a femme fatale, and she certainly is here, but the innocent Fonda character wins her over...more or less.  Their on-again, off-again romance carries almost as many plot twists as their are laughs in this wonderful film.

I'm one of those people who like the idea of ""old movies"" better than almost any specific old movie, but thanks to the Times I now have a clue as to which old films are really worth savoring.  ""The Lady Eve"" is high on that list now, along with such as ""Camilla"" and ""The Little Foxes"" (I always knew about ""Casablanca,"" at least).  Why did it take me so long to find this gem?  Nobody said anything about it.  Shame on you older folks for keeping this secret to yourself!

The sequence where Babs spoils outfit after outfit of Henry Fonda's at a swanky dinner party is absolutely not to be missed.  Remade in a somewhat inferior sequel starring George Gobel and Mitzi Gaynor, ""The Birds and the Bees"".",1104278400,2,394,5.046153846153846
221363,5,6300185125,"This is a great movie, one of my all time favorites. Stanwyck and Fonda make a perfect couple as they fall in and out of love with each other, sometimes literally. It's about a con artist name Jean played by Stanwyck who planned to seduce the millionaire Charles aka Hoppsy played by Fonda. But things went awry when she fell for him but it's too late when he found out her plans. After rejecting her she orchestrated a perfect revenge that even psychology cannot topple. The rest you have to watch.

Fonda is perfect for the part where his dignified persona was put into good use. I mean it's triple as amusing if not exactly laugh out loud funny in his multiple pratfalls. I wish he did more comedy in his career. But this film really showcased Barbara Stanwyck's gift as an actress. She gets to be funny, dramatic and sexy. In the classic scene where she and Fonda are in the bed seducing each other through words, it was just pitch perfect. Love it!

The film was silly due to its plot because it's definitely a screwball comedy only that it's more sophisticated and verbose than most in the genre. But because it was so well written how silly the plot may seem, the movie just works. The ending was particularly witty and clever.

I'm a little disappointed with the special features since this is criterion and it's really expensive compared to the other DVDs. I would really love to see a documentary on the making of the film.or a tribute to Stanwyck or Fonda. But there's a commentary here which I haven't listened to yet.

Her plans hit a snag, though, when she finds herself falling for him, which leads to some madcap fun. Directed and co-written by the peerless Preston Sturges (""Sullivan's Travels""), ""The Lady Eve"" is among the finest of Hollywood 1940's romantic comedies. The script is quite brilliant (the movie received only one Oscar nomination, for its screenplay, which it lost to ""Here Comes Mr. Jordan"") and delivers some genuine laughs. In addition, the tinge of bitterness and cynicism that characterizes Sturges' work is here -- this movie isn't a sickly sweet romance. Sturges also manages to create a wacky screen couple and then make them seem believable; a formidable task. Finally, Fonda has never been better; his all-American looks and blank visage are put to perfect use to convey the innocence required for the role.

I enjoyed young handsome Henry Fonda and particularly Barbara Stanwyck.  Barbara Stanwyck is not a favorite actress of mine.  Maybe it's her brassy delivery and non-leading lady face, but I've changed my mind.  Barbara is without a doubt the equal of Claudette Colbert or Carole Lombard in screwball comedy.  She might be better.  There is a burning intensity, a wistfulness in her delivery of: ""Sometimes a good girl can be bad and a bad girl can be good.""  Fonda has been in the Amazon for a year and on a ship home he runs into a family of card sharks.  Barbara traps him, he trips, falls, lands on his ass, and holds her stocking foot.

Worse, the DVD mastering is shoddy, with an excessive amount of edge enhancement, aliasing and fine detail shimmering that completely distracts one from enjoying the performances.  Film and digital grain is excessive and distracting.  Tiling in the background information is also glaringly obvious and present throughout.  The gray scale of this disc reads more like a muddy haze of undistinguished tones in which all of the fine details get buried under and lost.  The audio is mono and strident, scratchy and worn.

Essentially, The Lady Eve is the story of a naive (but very wealthy) adventurer right out of the Amazon, played by Henry Fonda (in his only screwball performance) who meets a sly and sexy girl named Eve, played by Barbara Stanwyck on a boat and immediately falls for her. When, however, he realizes she and her father are really professional gamblers who roam around getting money from people by playing card games, he is furious and leaves her. The rest of the movie deals with her hilarious efforts to win him back under a different name - that of the Lady Eve Sidwich.

221392,4,6300185125,"In the important areas, ""The Lady Eve"" seems hardly to have aged a day. This is one of a handful of romantic comedies from the 1930s and 1040s by which all others before and after are measured. One reason is doesn't seem so dated is that it so much better than socres of imitations made since its release in 1941.
While Henry Fonda is excellent as the rich, naive scientist whom Barbara Stanwyck's grifter / fortune hunting character is chasing after, one can still imagine another star, such as James Stewart, in the role The same thing can not be said of Stanwyck. She absolutely makes the role her own, and in the process, turns a very clever comedy into a timeless classic.
The script is extremely well-written, with lots of lines requiring perfect comic timing. Director Preston Sturges makes it all look effortless, but the scenario and the dialog would have proved [and has proved!] disastrous in lesser hands.
Naturally, the movie was made under the heavy-handed and sometimes Draconian moral production code in force at the time.'The Lady Eve' is hilariously subversive in the way it goes to the very limits of the code's rules. As a result, it ironically is far more sophisticated and clever than the majority of today's comedies. Compare the movie's very long scene in which Stanwyck play with Fonda's hair to any of today's 'Look! We're in bed together' scenes, and you'll see what I mean. [I don't care that couples are shown in bed together nowadays. It's just that there are other ways to make the same points.]
My favorite segment? The one in which Fonda proposes to Stanwyck as they stand gazing at a lovely sunset. His ditzy, rambling speech is one of the funniest parodies of romantic scenes I have ever heard. And whose brilliantly demented idea was it to put that happy, friendly  horse in the background? What funnier way to point out what a horse's [rear] our hero is making of himself?",1017619200,4,1909,4.7155688622754495

Not only is THE LADY EVE one of Sturge's best, it is also one of the finest in the entire genre, a comedy so potent that even the most jaded will be completely charmed.
There is no way to describe the story without spoiling the fun, so suffice to say the plot concerns the heir to a fortune (Fonda)who is beset by a beautiful but predatory card shark (Stanwyck)--and who looses considerably more than his heart in the process. Considered racy for its time, Stanwyck's... manipulation of Fonda is one of the funniest elements of the film, and the movie as a whole abounds with ""Garden of Eden"" motifs: the name Eve, apples, and (of course) a snake.  Everything moves along at a fast pace and with plenty of crackle, so there's never a dull moment, and the exceptional supporting cast includes witty performances from Charles Coburn, Eugene Pallette, William Demarest, Eric Blore, and a host of others.

221425,5,6300185125,"The Lady Eve is another of the great comedies from writer/director Preston Sturges. Henry Fonda plays a wealthy snake scientist who has been up the Amazon looking for unusual specimens. On the boat back to the States, he literally falls for Barbara Stanwyck. But she is part of a team of con artists seeking to relieve him of his money. The complication is that she starts to really fall in love with him. Out of this situation Sturges provides some hilarious moments. Fonda just can't stop falling over. He falls over feet, over furniture and into mud and has any number of objects fall on him. This is one of his few comedy roles and he does a fine job keeping up with the comic talent around him. Sturges uses Fonda's screen persona and subverts it with the result that the film becomes a sort of Lady Eve meets Young Mr Lincoln. It shows what happens when decent, methodical, idealistic Hank meets conniving, sophisticated, gold-digging Barbara. Stanwyck plays her part to perfection. She can be hard-boiled, but also vulnerable. She can be frighteningly icy, but allows her emotions to peek through the faade. Stanwyck also shows that she can perform a good imitation of an upper-class English accent. It only falls down when she uses a few examples of American English like `pants' instead of `trousers', but this is the script's fault not hers. The supporting cast in The Lady Eve is full of Sturges regulars like William Demarest who is his usual gruff no-nonsense self, seeing through all tricks. The cast also has the wonderful Eugene Pallette as Fonda's father. A scene where he calls for his breakfast by banging lids like cymbals is one of the funniest in the film. The script is full of great lines and the dialogue is so fast and witty that it is certainly necessary to see The Lady Eve more than once in order to appreciate all of the humour.
The print used for the Criterion DVD is nearly perfect. I noticed one moment where the image flickers, but it only lasts a fraction of a second. Otherwise I saw only clear bright images. The sound quality is also good with none of the background hiss and indistinct dialogue which sometimes plagues films from this period. The DVD also has quite a few extras. The commentary by Marian Keane is a bit academic for my taste and some of Keane's speculations I found to be a bit wild. Nevertheless it has some good insights and is well worth listening to. There is also a collection of stills to scroll through and a recording of the Lux Theater adaptation of the film.

221429,5,6300185125,"As a lifelong Preston Sturges fan, I find the problem with submitting reviews of his films to be twofold. The first is where to begin; the second how to stop. A third problem (growing out of the first two) manifests itself immediately upon watching a flawless jewel like THE LADY EVE: why even bother to praise it? No matter how accurate or elegant a rave you write, they'd still be merely words, and words can't do Sturges justice...not after hearing and seeing his own words spinning like a thousand plates over the 90-odd minutes this film is utterly captivating you. Unlike many black-and-white products of the studio era, which generate condescension or apathy in the current version of the Pepsi generation, the Sturges cult grows with every passing year. Young audiences fall under his spell, drawn initially to his work for the still-startling energy of the stream of raspberries he blew at the Production Code. (In this sense, EVE marks a high point; it's all about sexual gamesmanship, and its tone, both matter-of-fact and dizzyingly playful at the same time, is a decided departure from the typical 1940s studio approach.) But hopefully, they're coming for the sizzle and staying for the steak. Like all Sturges' Paramount films, EVE is an embarrassment of riches - a boudoir farce, a slapstick clinic, a cynical dialogue comedy AND a love story of great, soulful heart. It's especially recommended to anyone beset by misery and tribulation as a guaranteed restorative and all-around black cloud lifter. When a movie from any era can so completely and pleasurably take you out of yourself without resorting to any cheapjack plot-gimmicks or trite manipulation of an audience's emotions, all you can do is be grateful. Though the unfailingly superb Sturges Players are on hand, in fine form (including of course his human rabbit's foot, Wm Demarest) EVE features a number of actors making their first and only appearances in a Sturges-directed film: Stanwyck, Fonda, Chas Coburn, Eric Blore, Melville Cooper and perennial Fonda cohort Eugene Pallette. All of them take to the material like catnip, making one long for an alternate reality in which Preston Sturges could have remained unmolested at Paramount for 20 years and a dozen more films than he actually made - not just to see this cast reunited, but to discover what might have resulted from any number of actors new to Sturges being exposed to the hothouse atmosphere of his screenplays. That it never worked out that way is one more reason to treasure what he DID leave us, foremost among them THE LADY EVE.",998697600,7,2578,4.969907407407407
221430,5,6300185125,"Wow.  This film is a stunner.  It is also one of the best romantic comedies of the 1940s, or of any era.  As usual, Preston Sturges's dialogue and situations sparkle with humor and wit, while his direction keeps the action moving quickly.  Both Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda turn in perfect performances.  There are also notable supporting turns by Charles Coburn, Eugene Pallette, and Eric Blore (all practiced character actors that shined in romantic comedy).  Several Sturges regulars also appear, notably William Demarest.
Stanwyck plays a con artist, who, with her father (Coburn), tricks unwary passengers on cruise ships.  She decides that Fonda, a rich man who is heir to Pike's Pale [ale] fortune, will be her next victim.  They meet ""cute,"" as is required in an old romantic comedy: Stanwyck purposefully trips Fonda and breaks her shoe, then forces Fonda to take her to her room to replace it.  The following scene on the chaise loungue is a keeper.  Soon Fonda is falling under Stanwyck's spell, while Coburn is stealing his money at cards.  But Stanwyck also finds herself falling in love, as she is slowly won over by Fonda's innocence.  She decides to reform and give Fonda back his money.  But then Fonda finds out that Stanwyck is a known criminal, and breaks up with her.  Determined to have her revenge on Fonda for dumping her, Stanwyck disguises herself as the wealthy English ""Lady Eve"" and goes to Fonda's house.  There, she quickly seduces him, without Fonda ever recognizing her.  Then things get even more complicated.  Of course, certain events result with our hero and heroine finally understanding each other and finding happiness.
This film is a treat from beginning to end (I loved the opening credits with the animated snake--nice Adam and Eve reference).  Well worth the money.  Also recommended: Easy Living, Hail the Conquering Hero (both also Sturges), Ball of Fire (also with Stanwyck), anything by Lubitsch.",993168000,8,1948,5.012461059190031
221431,5,6300185125,"The gist of THE LADY EVE is ably summed up by Barbara Stanwyck's character in the first half of the film:  ""The good girls are never as good as they seem to be, and the bad ones never as bad.""  In this movie, Barbara plays Jean Harrington, a ""bad girl"" who is not as bad as she seems to be, who later pretends to be Eve Sidgwick, a ""good girl"" who isn't as good.
In my opinion, this is the greatest romantic comedy ever made.  Other films may be more romantic, others funnier, but not a single one combines both elements so perfectly.  Everything about this film sparkles.  Preston Sturges, one of the finest screenwriters in the history of cinema, turned out one of his most perfect scripts..  The details, the transitions between scenes, the wit, the lightning pace, the superb oneliners, the cascading dialog, absolutely everything marks this as a Preston Sturges production.  The cast is utterly beyond reproach.  Absolutely no one in the history of film could have been more perfect in the central role as Barbara Stanwyck.  Other men could have played the Henry Fonda part, but he was nonetheless excellent in his role, one of the very few comedic parts he managed in his career.  Charles Coburn sparkles as ""Handsome"" Harry Harrington, just as he excelled in a dozen or so other great films from the thirties, forties, and fifties.  Eugene Palette, the finest Friar Tuck there ever was or ever could be, is delightful as Henry Fonda's beleaguered father.  William Demarest is a fixture in nearly all of Preston Sturges's films, and while his role is not as large here as in some of the others (like HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO, SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS,  or THE MIRACLE OF MORGAN'S CREEK), he nonetheless manages to steal nearly every scene he is in.
THE LADY EVE is easily one of the most sexual films of the Hays era.  There is a great deal of barely concealed sexual innuendo, beginning with the title (""Eve"", the temptress), to the moment when Henry Fonda first climbs up the ladder onto the ocean liner that picks him up at the beginning of the movie (Barbara Stanwyck drops an apple that hits him on the head), to the extraordinary seduction scene (no sex, but at the end of the scene you know Henry Fonda goes back to his cabin for a long, cold shower).  I am not sure that the forties ever pictured a man filled with greater sexual desire than when Henry was holding Barbara's  leg while putting on her shoes, lost in her perfume.  Indeed, the entire segment extending from the second when Barbara Stanwyck initiates meeting Henry by tripping him (one of six pratfalls he will take in the film, if one includes his falling in the mud upon disembarking from his ""honeymoon"" train) to her sending him out of her cabin in a state of intensely heightened sexual awareness, is utterly astonishing.  As someone who grew up watching Barbara Stanwyck on THE BIG VALLEY, seeing that sequence for the first time was a revelation.  I had no conception that the woman was that sexy.
The greatest thing about THE LADY EVE is that it gets better with each viewing.  I have to strongly disagreee with the editorial review of this film, when he says that it is hard to say whether BALL OF FIRE or THE LADY EVE is funnier:  I have seen BALL OF FIRE and THE LADY EVE approximately four times and nine times respectively.  The mark of a really great film is how it stands up to reviewing.  BALL OF FIRE is great the first time but lessens somewhat upon reviewing (Howard Hawks is marvelous, but it is not one of his stronger films), but THE LADY EVE improves each time in every way.  Like I said, in my opinion, one of the best romantic comedies ever made.",991094400,101,3643,4.552147239263804

221433,5,6300185125,"Plot reviews are elsewhere below - Here's some background...Stanwyck and Fonda did a film prior to this, THE MAD MISS MANTON, but absolutely nothing happened between the stars.  She was too involved with Robert Taylor and he was in his third year of films and still being miscast.  By the time Sturges coupled them for EVE, they were ready to work together as a team and their chemistry was incredibly right.  Once the premise is established and Stanwyck has him in her sights, the ball is rolling and it never stops.  Fonda has stated more than once that he fell in love with Stanwyck at the time, and had he not been married, would've tried his best to win her away from Bob Taylor.  Barbara was thrilled that someone was willing to cast her in a role that required more of her in the way of an accent, having been pidgeon-holed with tough talking Brooklyn gals(previous attempts at an accent had failed until she passed with flying colors in 1939 as Irish Molly in Cecil B DeMille's UNION PACIFIC).  Fonda was fresh from heavy dramas after GRAPES OF WRATH and was looking for something light.  Stanwyck had been cast in a holiday comedy penned by Sturges, REMEMBER THE NIGHT with Fred MacMurray(years before DOUBLE INDEMNITY) so Sturges knew she'd be perfect in his first A picture directing project.  The stars liked everything about the script, the shoot was a joy and she was nominated for a Best Actress award.  She should've won(I think DeHavilland did) - Some brilliant scenes include over two minutes of narrative about Fonda in her compact mirror, her snaring and baiting him on a chaise lounge without anything really happening but the heat being turned WAY way up, Eugene Palette trying to get fed by someone in his staff, William Demarest as Fonda's nosy valet, Fonda's pratfalls and a hilarious sequence involving a horse getting in on the action.  In that case, a horse began inching up on Fonda in one of the takes and the acting pros kept on going with the scene until crew laughter stopped it.  Then Sturges wrote it into the script, causing someone to deliberately inch up the horse on the Fonda thruout the scene.  It's truly funny to watch and a truly brilliant film.  This is the one I show to people who think Stanwyck was only in Big Valley or noir pieces and think of Fonda as a Western star.  I HIGHLY RECCOMMEND THIS FILM!!!  It's one of my all time favorites and woe to the fool who thinks they can do a remake.  (It's so special for so many reasons, no one's been fool enough to try!) - MDM",983404800,4,2520,4.554323725055433

7804429,5,6300185125,"One of the all-time great comedies. The Criterion edition restores the sound and picture quality to better-than-new. Stanwyck plays a card-sharp con woman on an ocean liner who falls in love with her millionaire mark (Fonda). Unfortunately, before she can tell him who she is someone else does and he dumps her immediately. The real fun of the movie begins when she decides to get her revenge by reentering his life in the guise of the title character. Stanwyck and Fonda are surrounded by a delightfully-quirky cast of first-rate character actors, including Charles Coburn, Eugene Pallette, William Demerest, and Eric Blore.
