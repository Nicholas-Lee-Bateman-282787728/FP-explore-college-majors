6251707,4,B00I5YBJ5S,Have enjoyed re-watching all of the seasons without having to wait between episodes or seasons.  I know that I couldn't/wouldn't do all that they go through.,1397347200,,157,5.038461538461538
6251708,2,B00I5YBJ5S,"I am a huge TAR fan and have purchased every season released so far. When I received the discs 2 days ago, my heart sank!

There were huge scraps and scratches all over every single disc in addition to one episode with a huge chunk of airtime missing!
Another one with sequences totally spliced out of place....very poor editing that is NOT from the original telecast.

Shocking!!!",1396656000,2,381,4.6716417910447765
6251709,3,B00I5YBJ5S,"My son was so excited that Season 12 was finally available and delivered after pre-ordering a month ago. He is a HUGE Amazing Race fan! Unfortunately, there are a few glitches with a couple of the episodes which he was very disappointed about. On Disc 2, episode 4 there is missing footage and on  Disc 3, episode 1 the sequencing is incorrect. We are hoping that Amazon will send us a new CD set once the corrections have been made.",1396396800,3,433,4.4125
6251710,4,B00I5YBJ5S,"Finally! Season 12 on DVD. This was the last season to be made available on disc or via streaming. And it's The Amazing Race, so what's to criticize? The drama of teams racing around the world makes for one of the most entertaining reality shows ever. This race was as exciting as all the others, so the content itself is beyond criticism. However, there are issues with two of the episodes. On Disc 2, episode 4 there is a chunk of footage, about 15 minutes, missing from the middle. This is the episode where father Ronald was especially mean to daughter Christine during a Detour in India, and the footage that is missing encompasses this section. There is no explanation or other indications of missing footage, the viewer just has to figure out the sudden jump in sequence. It's always been my assumption that a legal  issue held up the release of this season on DVD, and with this missing footage I believe this may have ultimately been the case. Now on Disc 3, episode 1 has a serious editing issue. About a third of the way through the sequencing skips towards the end and runs about 15 minutes before finally skipping backwards to the point where it originally left the original sequence. Very confusing! And again, no explanation or indication of a problem with the episode.  But considering this completes the availability of all Amazing Race seasons, it's a pleasure to be able to watch this vintage season all over again. The 4 star rating instead of 5 is only because of the issues with the two episodes described above.

PS - I wouldn't think it fair to revise my review based on new evidence below, so please read the comments posted by other users.",1395964800,5,1665,4.618243243243243
6251711,3,B00I5YBJ5S,Glad to see these faces I do remember but the dvds are terrible. One of them got stuck on some of the scenes I could not watch so I had to use the dvd remote to skip and continue to see the rest. I don't know if they do the same for other copies of Amazing Race but at least it can be enjoyed for the most part.,1406246400,,311,3.588235294117647
6251712,2,B00I5YBJ5S,"Poor quality; tried in two different dvd players. Audio keeps breaking up, picture freezes. The quality control issues noted by others several months ago have still not been corrected.",1405296000,,184,5.379310344827586
6251713,5,B00I5YBJ5S,Arrived on time and in new condition. I love this series as it allows me to tour the world while learning about local cultures and enjoying the competition without leaving my home. Season 12 was no exception. Looking forward to the next season released.,1401062400,,253,4.7727272727272725
6251714,4,B00I5YBJ5S,I agree with the comments about this season which had some of my favourite teams.  The dvds I received had time missing from one of the episodes on disc 3 and the editing jumble in another episode on the same disc.  It would be nice to have that disc replaced with a correct one.,1399680000,,279,4.148148148148148
6251715,5,B00I5YBJ5S,the amazing race season 12 was a joy to watch.  this is my favorite tv show and if you have any of the seasons after 13 let me know.,1399593600,,132,3.5517241379310347

6251718,4,B00I5YBJ5S,"The only problem was on one of the episodes, the sequence was off--that is the editing was was not sequential.",1397779200,,110,4.55
6251719,3,B00I5YBJ5S,"the first nine seasons of TAR on DVD had closed captions or subtitles. From season ten on, no closed captions or subtitles are included with sets. Very disappointing. We have a deaf family member who cannot enjoy this set so we had to return it.",1397520000,,245,4.466666666666667
6251720,4,B00I5YBJ5S,"If you choose each episode individually from the menu it seems like footage is missing from the last episode of Disc 2 and the first episode of Disc 3 is in the wrong order. However, the seems that there was an technical error with the discs. If you access these episodes using the Play All option on the respective discs all the footage is present.",1397520000,3,349,4.384615384615385
8639522,3,B00I5YBJ5S,"My copy has numerous flaws but wasn't worth the hassle of returning. As a rabid AR fan this was a fav of mine. Again I question, though, why AR DVDs have so many flaws. I've never experienced this before.",1486944000,,204,4.256410256410256
