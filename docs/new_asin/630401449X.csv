7858617,5,630401449X,"Fans of James dean or anyone in general will enjoy this program.  It is set on a farm and the cast is wonderful, esp. James Dean, playing a  ""true to life"" role for him as a farm boy, that wants to leave  the farm.  This is really a ""Thanksgiving"" special and orginally  aired the week of that holiday in 1953.
 There is a really neat scene of  Jimmy playing with a little boy; he's tossing him up in the air and  catching him.  That's more than worth the low price of this wonderful  videotape!",966988800,7,495,4.170212765957447
