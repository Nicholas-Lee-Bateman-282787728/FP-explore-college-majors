8696884,3,B00S1TP3V8,"So far I have only watched 2 of the 4 discs so I should perhaps have waited until I have seen them all - the content has been interesting and certainly the DVD set is far less expensive than the costs of the course, transport, accommodation etc.  The main reason for the low rating is that the sound went very strange half way through the 1st disc (this may just have been mine) which made it difficult to listen to, and during the 2nd disc many people with no microphone are asking excruciating long questions, and the DVD viewer is just abandoned having no clue what is being said, just watching a very hot Lane Pederson sipping water and nodding.  Frustrating!",1463443200,5,663,4.471074380165289
