4112082,2,B003DTMPG2,"So, here's the deal.  The content is great.  It has 6 regular episodes and one double length episode not available on the other dvds.  However, this dvd is not what you  might expect.  It says, ""This disc is expected to play back in DVD Video ""play-only"" devices and may not play in other DVD devices, including recorders and PC drives.""  It says this in very tiny print.  I popped it in my computer to play for my kids and the computer crashed and rebooted.  Seriously.  Twice.  Also, interestingly enough, above the barcode it says, ""Manufactured by Amazon.com""  Anyway, just thought I'd share this information because it certainly isn't clearly explained in the product info. Guess this is what they mean when they say ""This product is manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media.""",1277856000,12,792,4.879699248120301

8394954,5,B003DTMPG2,"The Wonder Pets are fun to watch. They also teach children about lots of things. They should of never took them off the air. They also stopped making more new DVD,s of Wonder Pets. I don,t see why. Maybe they didn,t get to many high ratings. They should of got high ratings. They are the best. I would be interested in ordering more if they come out with some new ones.",1357516800,,369,4.211267605633803
8394955,1,B003DTMPG2,"What a disappointment! I've read about the warning of the devices before I purchased this DVD, however, it doesn't even play on TWO different Sony DVD players! Both of them are ""play-only"" devices and new models! It took a long time to ""load"" the dvd, and after the spinning stopped, no image, nothing happened! It is just not playable! If Amazon/CreateSpace has the technology to produce such a product and sale it in top price, why don't they produce something user-friendly? Instead, we paid almost $20 for ONE useless dvd, got super disappointed and have to go through the hassle of return/refund! What a waste of time!",1289520000,2,623,4.831775700934579
