5423665,5,B00AFQSYJS,"This is a joint China-Canada project. It was shot in both countries .. there is a nice documentary that shows a lot more of it was shot in the rather amazing studio's in China then you might think. This story takes place in the 1880s.

The history being told about is true; in Canada we had waves of labour immigration to bring cheap labour from abroad -- Irish were getting more costly (and settled) so Chinese workers were brought in to do the dangerous and labour intensive work of building the railway through the mountains (in this case the ""Hell's Gate"" passage).

The story of ""a woman"" dressing as a man to get work is apparently true, but ""literary license"" was used beyond that in regard to the dramatic plot. That said the background story is true; much like was done with the 1997 movie Titanic -- and if anything was played down from the reality. As noted, a ""Head Tax"" came out of this immigration -- whereby the Chinese were taxed more then the railway cost. Canada formally apologized to China in 2006 for this.

I have shown this movie to several people and they all told me they REALLY enjoyed it. It is broken down into two parts and EVERYONE was very anxious to get Part Two as the cast and story are VERY VERY GOOD. Part Two is terrific too, as it delivers even more then alluded to from the very good first part.

Some things worth noting. First in the 1880s .. that was VERY early in Canadian History; you forget how things were back then; such as it taking a month to travel to and from China. The train shown is a fully operational 1912 model, that was modified to appear to be an 1880 model. Apparently there are some historical errors pretty minor stuff, but some people are into the details.

I highly recommend this movie. It is in spoken English. Special mention again for the terrific cast. Peter O'Toole, (Betty) Li Sun, Luke Macfarlane, Sam Neill (Hunt for Red October), Tony Leung Ka Fai (""The Lover"" in 1992). Again, the plot is well done, and keeps the viewer well involved and interested the the outcome of these character's story.",1266019200,27,2068,4.48936170212766

5423683,4,B00AFQSYJS,"I enjoyed this movie.  Peter O'Toole and Sam Neill were excellent as always.  I  thought the young Asian actress who played the young Chinese boy just shone!  I also enjoyed the first part of the movie depicting China at the turn of the century.  I would have liked to have seen more of Sam Neill.

Overall, an excellent movie.",1377907200,6,327,4.4576271186440675

There's a good possibility you missed Iron Road, a Canada/China television miniseries when it originally aired in 2009. That would be your loss. The good news is Iron Road is now available on DVD from my friends at Entertainment One.
It follows the epic journey of a young Chinese girl, Little Tiger (Sun Li) who poses as a young man. Her mother has died and she's quit hearing from her father, who left earlier in search of fortune at Gum San (Gold Mountain).
Gold Mountain is actually a remote construction camp located in the Rockies, where men are attempting to blast through a mountain's core and lay down railroad tracks. The venture is headed by tycoon Alfred Nichol (Sam Neill). His project is behind schedule and he's facing bankruptcy. He wouldn't have a chance but his banker's daughter has a thing for Nichol's son, James (Luke Macfarlane).
Desperate Alfred sends his son to China to recruit more workers because they will work cheaper than Americans.
That's where James meets Little Tiger, and her caretaker Relic (Peter O'Toole). The two form an awkward friendship, with James thinking Little Tiger is a young boy. Little Tiger eventually finds his workers, but he doesn't want to take her because he considers her too young, too small.
This is a remarkable tale told with breathtaking scenery of mountains in British Columbia, Canada for a backdrop. Authentic wood trestle bridges, built by the Canadian Pacific Railway, during the Gold Rush (1900) can be seen.",1368576000,12,1530,4.957198443579767

8551066,2,B00AFQSYJS,"I really enjoy historical dramas, but this effort is a fairly lame melodrama at best. Every character is a complete stereotype. Every plot development is totally predictable. The bad guys might as well be twirling their long black mustaches. The romance between the owners son and the Chinese girl is implausible. I watched part one and never finished the rest.",1451088000,,361,5.033333333333333
