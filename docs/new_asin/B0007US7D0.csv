2244668,2,B0007US7D0,"I've watched all three of the Dracula trilogies movies going back to 2000 and actually Dracula II Ascension wasn't bad at all, Dracula III is not the worst vampire flick I've seen , there's actually some well thought scenes but the movie has many flaws. One of the best things I can say about it is that it was entertaining, and it was pretty much as I expected. Well first let's get down the bad stuff.

Jason Scott Lee reprising his role as Father Uffizi is just plain horrible. Lee himself Is a mediocre actor to begin with apart from his martial arts stuff, he can't act. every time I see him going into his little Indiana Jones routine of chopping heads of with his whip sends me into a hysteria of laugher.

Roy Scheider is in this film for two minutes as a useless character named Cardinal Siqueros. Now perhaps the biggest con and letdown is that Dracula himself, now played by Rutger Hauer is in this film for about six to twelve minutes!!. What a waste, some more screen time would have helped, although Rutger himself seems to old play this role just like Christopher Lee was during the last Dracula movies.

Before the movie starts we , we get a barrage of clips from the last movie and I have to say that it's horribly edited to the point that I almost died laughing. Jason Scott Lee is such a horrible actor that he made part of this film into a comedy not a horror movie.

The plot says that Uffizi and Luke (Jason London) are still searching for Dracula and Luke's love Elizabeth but this time around they encounter some vampire along with the way, along with some different mutated vampires and a couple of stupid rebels. That's dead on actually. Apparently there a separate group of scum selling villagers as food. Anyhow, Uffizi and Luke rescue some girl named Julia whose a reporter and from there let the vampire killings begin!!!

The action/vampire kills in the movie, are pretty good actually, at least this part is watchable, there's some good setup of suspense and thrills just before every kill.

The movie never gets dull at least, the characters never have too many long lines keeping the action going.

The acting was average to good, Jason London as Luke is more likable than the priest, and he actually does some vampire killings of his own which are done alright, Rutger Hauer in the few minutes he has as Dracula does his best. Again Jason Lee is horrible but he has his moments.

Budget wise, since this was from Dimension the budget seems small but from what I saw it was good enough to present at least a semi watchable vampire film. The movie is definitely nothing I would shell out money for if it came on DVD but if it's on cable or something I might watch it again. Then that is Dracula III The Legacy, it's watchable but just don't expect your socks to be knocked.

It's not that horrible,I actually liked it but by no means is it a horror classic. You're usual vampire flick with it's highs and lows, a 5 out 10 from me",1119916800,10,2962,4.450184501845018

2244673,5,B0007US7D0,"Hey, what's better than Romanian vampire circus clowns on stilts?

But seriously, lots of action and (some) character development in a high production value vampire flick.

It would help if you saw Dracula II to understand who the characters are, but not essential.

If you are tired of zombies, try this as a change of pace.

Please note that there are scenes of large numbers of semi-nude bloodied up female Romanian extras showing considerable T&A and even other real estate. This will be of intense interest to sixth grade boys, so I warn you about it.

I'd agree with others that this film can go neck in neck with some of the best Romero zombie flicks and that most other vampire film suck in comparison to this one, perhaps with the exception of Blade and Interview with a Vampire.

One last note: Not sure why they needed Rutger when he was on for so little time and it looked like he hadn't shaved for four days and they put makeup over it. He did have a few good lines.",1364688000,,979,4.441340782122905

This one though, I think I would have preferred Stephen Billington over Rutger Hauer as Dracula.  Billington is a more scary, menacing vampire to me.  But over all, I really like this one.

2244677,1,B0007US7D0,"This seriously hurts the Dracula myth.  Dracula is NOT Judas.  The very Dracula novel will tell you that he 'must be the Dracula who fought the Turks'.  That's Vlad the Impaler, born 1431 and died 1476.  NOT Judas.  And I find the attempt to justify Dracula's limitations to tie them to the Judas story to be flawed at best.  Okay, so he was paid in silver when he betrayed Jesus so he hates silver, he hates the sun because he tried to kill himself at dusk... O...kay... and he hates crosses because of Jesus being crucified (long held guilt?).  So how do we explain his aversion to Garlic?  They had Italian at the last supper?  Also I do NOT like the idea that Jesus would condemn anyone to be a vampire.  Jesus forgave Judas.  And why would he come to save humanity only to unleash the world's worst vampire on the Earth.  That's a Messiah who gave us Count Dracula?!  Some Messiah unleashing a monster on us. Thanks a lot!

This is a poor sequel from a film (Dracula 2000) that was weak to begin with. Still Rutger Hauer is a good actor though.",1308355200,2,1049,4.34020618556701
2244678,5,B0007US7D0,"OK, for anyone reading this review, keep in mind that over the years I have collected over 100 vampire movies, and for the longest time I didn't even care if they were good or not.  I shamefully admit that I've got some *really* bad ones in my collection (Reign in Darkness comes to mind).  I've been trying to curb my collecting, and I'm trying to get vampire movies that have at least some sort of redeeming quality to them.  I gotta say, when I first saw this movie for sale, I wanted to get it because it would complete the series from Patrick Lussier... but when I saw that Rutger Hauer was the one that played Dracula, I balked.  I have nothing against him, but he was, after all, the vampire from the original Buffy.  That kind of ruined it for me.  I gave it a shot anyways, and I'm soo glad I did!!  The good - the scenery!!  It was filmed in Romania, so the scenery was actually very realistic.  Some of the set designs were a bit cheesy, but the scenery itself was great.  The main characters are likeable, and the dialog didn't seem forced.  Some of the vampires were unique too - especially the one on stilts.  Yes, I said stilts, but he did come from a carnival, so it does make sense once you see it.  The ending scene reminded me of a picture done by Joseph Vargo, which was a nice touch.

Now of course this movie isn't up to par with something like Bram Stoker's Dracula, and this movie is not going to be everyone's cup of tea.  But try going into it with an open mind.  It will make you giggle at some parts, and its not going to be scary or anything (at least in my opinion) but there are a LOT of really bad vampire movies out there.  You could definitely do much worse than this one!!  I personally liked it a lot.",1296604800,,1737,4.180722891566265
2244679,2,B0007US7D0,"Dracula 2000 was a fantastic modern retelling of the Dracula lore, and its first sequel, Ascension, while not picking up on any of the plot points of 2000, was still a solid vampire movie and gave me GREAT hopes for this movie.  My expectations, however, were greatly missed on every level.

Legacy has a great premise as the characters from the Ascension hunt down Dracula in Romania, however the build up is very slow and generic.  Everything just feels like filler as opposed to a solid plot, and characters and scenarios seem to be randomly thrown in just to waste time until the final showdown.  Logic is also thrown out the window in these scenarios (apparently only a main character can figure out how to climb out of a vampire pit, and likewise apparently he's the only person the vampires won't attack).

To make matters even worse, the final showdown is a HUGE letdown.  Rutger is woefully miscast, and gives one of the worst performances of his entire career.  Somehow the young Dracula from the previous film is suddenly an old man for no apparent reason, and the battle is anything but a major payoff as it lasts only a few minutes and is one of the worst fights I've ever seen.

Also, if you want to see this just for the pay off to the storyline from Ascension (i.e. the search for Elizabeth) don't waste your time as the payoff to that is even worse and seems even more generic.  In fact, it goes from the driving plot point at the beginning to something of an after thought that seems to just be tacked on.

Overall, a very disappointing movie.  The only redeeming value is the tease at the end that could lead to some interesting sequels should this series continue, though I'd rather see a true sequel to Dracula 2000 following Van Helsing's daughter.",1284076800,,1770,4.569620253164557
2244680,2,B0007US7D0,"Dracula 3 Legacy starts where the previous film ends and fast fowards 5 years. At that time we pick up in Romania with Luke and Father Uffizi, the two survivors of the previous film who didn't become a vampire.  The other survivor of the 2nd film in this Dracula series was Elizabeth who, in the end, became a Vampire and saved Dracula from the clutches of Father Uffizi.

But back to the 3rd film.  We pick up in Romania with Luke and father Uffizi tracking down Dracula and Elizabeth.  Only on their way they find many people who stand in their way.  In the end they catch up to Dracula and Elizabeth and destory both. Only for Father Uffizi to succum to his vampiric blood.

The Positive:  The movie focused more on Luke and Father Uffizi's journey to find Dracula and Elizabeth.  We see Father's Uffizi's battle with himself and his character development is central to the plotline.

The Negatives:  The movie focuses too much on Luke and Father Uffizi.  Failing epically to develop the characters of Dracula and Elizabeth.  They don't even show up in the movie until the last 20 minutes.  At the end of Dracula II: Ascention it lead the audience to believe that there would be more character development of both characters.  Elizabeth was key character in which the director and producers could of developed immensely.

The focus was taken off of Dracula and Elizabeth, who should of been the main characters in the movie.  The passion and love interest between the two could of helped create a sense of ""unholy"" dread and passion within the movie.  Elizabeth becoming a vampire and choosing Dracula would of created a better dynamic for the ""heros"" in the story to have to fight.  All of this could of made for a much more terrifying movie.

As most people know a movie, especially a horror movie, the strength, ingenuity, intelligence, and the power of the bad guy makes or breaks the movie. In the end Both Dracula and Elizabeth were weak characters who could hold up to the standard of tough baddies for the good guys.  The final battle was short and lacked any real substance or fear.  Elizabeth's character could have been used as more of a stronger character working towards some ""evil"" that was a moral decision on her part.

Overall, I was disapointed.  Only reason why I gave the movie a two star was that Father Uffizi was a strong character.",1276646400,,2358,4.642512077294686
2244681,4,B0007US7D0,"The first of the series Dracula 2000 is a cult classic that I really enjoyed.  The franchise was given over to Jason Scott Lee, and his acting here is superb (the morning cleansing rituals send shudders down my spine).  The new female lead Alexandra Westcourt is well cast,a real classic British beauty, with an outstanding performance. The visuals are very good.  The plot twist, a la Conan the Barbarian, makes for a strangely irreverant cathartic ending, something Wes Craven fans will definitely enjoy.  The scoring is good. The only minor critique is that I wish this was shot on film instead of a digital camera or at least resampled to 24p, which is what you'd come to expect with a mainstream release movie.  the action scenes really suffer from the hyperfluid digital frame rate, gives it that TV quality which is inappropriate for an action movie. the digital recording also affected the recorded speech adversely. would have been better to shoot it on analog! perhaps more expensive, but this is an otherwise studio quality release.",1268524800,,1043,4.937142857142857

I had the most trouble with the changing of actors during the three movies. Was it so hard to keep them or did they use them up during the process? Not a clue.

Perhaps I'm a bit spoiled, but I prefer grande productions in high quality such as the Bram Stoker's version.",1202860800,,403,4.36

2244702,2,B0007US7D0,"First, let me give you warning: `Dracula III: Legacy' from Dimension Films picks up the thread of `Dracula II' at the time several years after the film had ended. Without knowledge about the ""second"" Dracula film, you find it hard to follow some part of the story of the third, in which we meet again the vampire hunter Father Vincent Uffizi (Jason Scott Lee) and his wise-cracking partner Luke (Jason London).

Not much is going to happen in `Dracula III: Legacy' except that Uffizi leaves the Church (and Cardinal played by cameo Roy Scheider), and that Luke searches his love Elizabeth (Diane Neal) whom Dracula abducted years ago. They fly to Romania, where there is a civil war going on (really?), and the two hunters meet a TV reporter Julia (Alexandra Westcourt) among the dead - no, undead bodies of the local people.

I could not understand how and why very well, but somehow they meet the rebels who might or might not be helping them, and Dracula's cohorts who are working for the evil Count to provide the blood, kidnapping the villagers.

Director is again Patrick Lussier, who uses the limited locations cleverly, but as shown in his previously released four pictures (all occult thrillers from Dimension Films), he does not seem to completely trust the good ideas in his film, and instead relied too much on fast editing and murky photography. In fact, all of his films including `Dracula III: Legacy' make me think that there is a good film somewhere deep inside of them, but before they are fully used, the film goes back to the familiar fight scenes in which the hunters wield sickle, and white-faced vampires attack with teeth.

Interestingly Rutger Hauer, who plays Dracula here, had played the vampire lord in 1992 film `Buffy the Vampire Slayer' and this fact tells you how some actors are easily typecast in the movie. Hauer with exaggerated mannerisms does his best, but his Count is nothing impressive. Strangely, it seems to me that he has not been allowed to show considerable charisma of his own for these ten years or more, that which easily matches Christopher Lee or Frank Langella. As to Jason Scott Lee as once-bitten vampire slayer, what can I say except this -- Please don't disappoint me again. In fact, the sidekick by Jason London is more convincing as a character.

But I should not blame the director and actors. According to IMDb, the film company decided to split the original story into two parts while shooting, and made two `Dracula' films - `II' and `III.' If this is true, they should not be faulted for the thin content and lackluster direction.",1141776000,3,2593,4.779017857142857

2244707,4,B0007US7D0,"I went in to Wes Craven Presents Dracula III: Legacy cold, without having seen either Dracula 2000 or Wes Craven Presents Dracula II: Ascension, so I can't really compare what has come before with what takes place here.  I was cautiously optimistic about the film, though (the name Wes Craven doesn't necessarily guarantee quality the way it once did).  There are some things I didn't like about Dracula III, but overall it's a better than average vampire film.  There could have been more blood and gore, and some of the special effects toward the end smelled slightly of cheese, but Jason Scott Lee pretty much carries the film.  His character, Father Uffizi, isn't your typical vampire hunter - and he's certainly not your typical priest - and I think that gives the film a special little spin.  Unfortunately, the movie is short on hot vampire chicks.  Diane Neal more than fits the bill, but she's limited to the film's final scenes.

Father Uffizi is going after Dracula, with or without the Church's blessing (the Church being represented by Roy Scheider in a short, nonessential cameo).  Unfortunately, he takes an annoying do-gooder sidekick with him.  I can understand Luke's (Jason London) motivation, since the woman he loves is now a plaything of the vampire and it's apparently all his fault, but his is the kind of character vampire movies just don't need - unless they're going for comedy.  The two make their way to Romania, a country in the throes of civil war, and fight their way through a number of obstacles - both human and vampiric.  Along the way, they take up with an English journalist who is about to get the scoop of her life (assuming she lives to report it, of course) when she learns that the real source of the trouble in Romania is a vampire.  As you might expect, the final scenes play out in Dracula's abode, and I can't say I was all that impressed with the head honcho blood-sucker.  He's not all that bright to have caused so much trouble for so many centuries and his security system could certainly do with some improvements - and it takes more than harsh whispering to make a vampire truly impressive.  Half the time, I had to strain to understand whatever rubbish Rutger Hauer was putting out there.  I liked the ending, though - it's not unpredictable, but it is subtle.

The special effects are pretty darn good for the most part; human appendages tend to be less impressive when they're separated from the body, and I thought the special effects of the climactic scenes could have been better, but I'm not really complaining.  Okay, I will complain about one thing.  Uffizi has this deadly arsenal of blades, but we usually have to settle for watching blood splatter on the walls rather than see the blades do their dirty work.  There's no shortage of that blood, though.

It's hard to offer a new take on the Dracula legend, but this movie does a pretty good job of it.  I've certainly seen worse - much, much worse.  Seeing Dracula III won't make your life complete, but I think most vampire fans will enjoy it.",1130371200,8,3059,4.667910447761194
2244708,1,B0007US7D0,"I've written many reviews on Amazon.com before and I like all of them.  If you'd like to see Rutger Hauer as a vampire, go to Salem's Lot 2004.  Border's, Best Buy, Circuit City are carrying copies of this bloody mess.  Lussier should have just quit while he was ahead in Dracula 2000.  At least Gerard Butler, hot as he is, made it to the big screen, and the film did well in the theaters.

  So, in keeping with my title, I hope that this helps people to keep their credit cards, cash, debit cards, in their wallet.  The only good ""Dracula"" films are those of Christopher Lee, Frank Langella, maybe Bela Lugosi (benefit of the doubt), and Ben Cross (Dark Shadows-The Revival Series 1991).  Mr. Cross, in short, was a reluctant vampire who displayed many of the correct characteristics of a ""head"" vampire.  Please do not get me started with Tom Cruise as Lestat in ""Interview With The Vampire"" or Gary Oldman in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"".  These two are no more than a couple of bloodsucking wimps in rehab.

  As long as we keep the memory of Peter Cushing(Dr. Van Helsing) alive, and  revere Christopher Lee along with Mr. Langella as likely the best Dracula players, we should keep shaking hands with Ben Cross and Gerard Butler for honest upgradings.",1128556800,4,1254,4.636363636363637

This time around, Jason Scott Lee returns as the fearless vampire killer, aided by the expected ""dorky"" associate, played with little aplumb by Jason London.  Roy Scheider has a cameo as the wisened older priest and Rutger Hauer returns briefly as the nefarious count.  In between, we have some kind of plot focusing on Rumanian rebels and the quest to find London's girlfriend who the count absconded with in the second movie.  The vampire scenes are cliched, the plot is thickened with nonsensical diversions and the acting subpar.

2244711,3,B0007US7D0,"Dracula 3 The Legacy is one of those movies that I wanted to see so bad, because I loved the first two films. However, to me, this film isn't as good as the other two films, but it's still a good movie.

It's a lot different than the first two films Dracula 2000 and Dracual 2 Acension. The other movies go for a younger audience and try to mix Dracula with a modern day world. This film goes to Romania and wants the audience to be more aware of where Dracula came from and show things from a different point of view, being away from modern civilization and involving an army and a different setting entirely.

The things that really work for this film are the relationships the actors have with each other and the total change of scenery from the first two films. Jason London and Jason Scott Lee provide better than expected acting in their roles as vampire slayers.

The things that don't work for this movie are the amount of time Dracula and the vampires fighting the slayers get on the screen. A lot of the vamire fights are just way too short to be that interesting and entertaining to watch.",1122422400,4,1100,4.382352941176471
2244712,1,B0007US7D0,"I love vampire movies. They are my biggest guilty pleasures in life. I love everything from the immortal classic ""Nosferatu"" to the ultra-chic ""Underworld"". Unfortunately there are a few turkeys that I just absolutely can't stand. One is ""Dracula 2000"" and ""Dracula III: Legacy"". I probably should have first rented ""Dracula II: The Ascension"". After seeing ""Dracula III"", I have no desire to see its predecessor. I found the writing and acting beyond atrocious.

The premise of the film sounds promising: Luke (Jason London, Jeremy London's brother) and Father Uffizi (Jason Scott Lee) travels to Romania to find Luke's girlfriend Elizabeth (Law & Order: Special Victims Unit's Diane Neal) and to finish off Dracula (Rutger Hauer). Along the way the duo meets a tv reporter Julia Hughes (Alexandra Westcourt) who had discovered that Dracula had hired some local thugs to feed his blood lust.

I really wanted to like this movie since I love vampire films but I found myself gagging on every line that was uttered by all the actors, Jason London who annoyed me to no ends of the earth, and the horrible acting from Jason Scott Lee. Wesley Snipe played the tormented half-human, half-vampire 100x better than Jason Scott Lee who looked like he was constipated. The idea of Jason Scott Lee playing a (defrocked) priest was laughable and his acting (or lack thereof) even more laughable.

The only good things I could say about this film is: a) the beautiful scenery in Romania, b) the action sequences, and c) the gore factor, otherwise there is no redeeming quality about this film. While I do love Diane Neal on her tv show, her performance was just as bad as Jason Scott Lee and Jason London's although I have to blame the terrible script that she was given, everyone else is a terrible actor in general (except for Rutger Hauer - as scary as he was in ""The Hitchhiker"", he could not scare a sea monkey in this film). If this film was supposed to be campy, it certainly lacked the humorous camp value of ""The Lost Boys"" which had quite a bit of sense of humor. This film had none. Whatever humor it had was because of the bad acting and poorly written script. This movie definitely has b-movie quality written all over it and in this case the B stands for BAD.",1122422400,,2261,4.704545454545454
2244713,4,B0007US7D0,"Move over Blade, there is a new vampire franchise in town. Tired of slick, over-produced horror movies like Underworld? Look no further. Dracula III: Legacy is the latest installment in a surprisingly durable franchise. Director Patrick Lussier has been quietly picking up the slack from a now dormant John Carpenter by making straightforward, atmospheric B-horror movies.

Jason Scott Lee is surprisingly effective as a driven vampire hunter. Armed with a nasty looking scythe, he is a very efficient (and cool) killer of the undead. He wouldn't be out of place in a Carpenter film as one of the auteur's trademark, enigmatic men-of-action, like Snake Plissken in Escape from New York. In contrast to Lee's no-nonsense character, Jason London is the easy-going sidekick that provides the film's doses of comic relief. These two actors have come a long way from films like Dragon (Lee) and Mallrats (London) to form an excellent duo.

Dracula III features a good balance of cool characters, the right amount of exposition and a beefed up vampire presence that was lacking from Dracula II. This last installment of the trilogy captures a modern gothic atmosphere beautifully, putting other contemporary Hollywood horror movies to shame. The heir apparent to John Carpenter's legacy has been found and it should be interesting to see what Lussier does next.

There is an audio commentary by writer/director Patrick Lussier, producer/co-writer Joel Soisson and special makeup designer Gary Tunnicliffe. This is chatty track as the three men discuss their movie and the challenges of shooting on a budget.

""A Conversation with Patrick Lussier on the Mythology of Vampires."" The director was fascinated by the depiction of vampires all over the world and in particular Romania's Vlad the Impaler and Bram Stoker's take on the legend.

""A Conversation with Special Makeup Designer Gary J. Tunnicliffe."" He talks about the hardships of working in the cold weather of Romania and how he had to ship in fake blood and reassemble the plastic weapons because they kept breaking in the cold weather.

""Cast Auditions"" features footage of four of the supporting cast members who were taken from Europe.

""Deleted Scene-Flat Tire"" features our heroes fixing a flat tire and encountering some undead along the way.

Also included is an ""Alternate Ending"" that features a much more upbeat ending than what is in the existing version.

For dedicated fans of this franchise there are the original story treatments for all three movies that allow one to see them in their early stages and how Lussier initially envisioned them.

Finally, there are trailers for the first two Dracula movies.",1122336000,23,2672,5.178654292343388
2244714,1,B0007US7D0,If you can stay away from this movie it was stupid it had no story and i thought that the other two Dracula movies were way better then this one!!!!!! LIKE I SAID BEFORE STAY AWAY FROM THIS STUPID MOVIE IT'S NOT WORTH RENTING OR BUYING!!!!!,1122076800,2,240,4.239130434782608
2244715,4,B0007US7D0,"After seeing ""Dracula 2000"" and the sequel ""Dracula 2: Ascension"", and enjoying both, needless to say I was looking forward to the release of the third and supposed final chapter in this new `Dracula 2000' series, for two reasons.  One reason was, obviously since I enjoyed the first and second entries in this series, I figured I would enjoy the third installment; and second, because ""Dracula 2: Ascension"" left everything hanging at the end of the movie.  This was due to the fact that both ""Dracula 2: Ascension"" and Dracula 3: Legacy"" were filmed at the same time, and when viewed together, they essentially make one big movie that continues from ""Dracula 2000"".  So, of course until ""Dracula 3: Legacy"" was released, over a year after the release of the second film, I felt the series was incomplete since ""Dracula 2: Ascension"" didn't really have a satisfactory ending.  Finally, after over a year of legal maneuvering, Dimension Films was able to release the third installment in the `Dracula 2000' series, and it definitely was worth the wait, as it ties everything together in a very cool way.

""Dracula 3: Legacy"" as I said in the previous paragraph, quite literally picks up the second that ""Dracula 2: Ascension"" ends.  Father Uffizzi, the priest/vampire hunter, and his reluctant partner Luke (Jason London) are pursuing Dracula in hopes of finishing him off once and for all.  The problem is, they don't know where Dracula has gone to since he evaded them, this leads them back to the Archbishop that assigned Uffizzi the task of eliminating Dracula, for some help in locating the vampire that started it all.  At this time we learn that since Uffizzi has somewhat given Dracula the forgiveness he was lacking, Dracula is no longer immortally young as he has been all this time.  Now, Dracula (Rutger Hauer) is growing older and he knows that his time is shorter now and is doing all that he can to prolong the inevitable end to his reign of terror.

""Dracula 3: Legacy"" takes the series to Dracula's home in Romania, for what appears to be the final installment in the series.  This change of location served for some interesting twists, as the hunters must now track Dracula on his own turf, while fighting off legions of vampire servants for Dracula, and avoiding the civil war that is raging in the country between Dracula and his legion, and those who oppose his oppressive rule.

It was nice to see Jason London and Jason Scott Lee reprise their roles for this film, also making a cameo appearance is Roy Scheider as the priest that assigned Uffizzi the task of killing Dracula (Roy Scheider also made a cameo in ""Dracula 2: Ascension"").  Dracula this time around is played by Rutger Hauer, who does a magnificent job of playing the menacing vampire lord.  By the way, Rutger Hauer is the third actor to portray Dracula in this series.

The story stands much better by itself than the story of ""Dracula 2: Ascension"", but to really appreciate the events in this film you really must see both ""Dracula 2000"" and Dracula 2: Ascension"".  Some fans of the series have said that ""Dracula 2: Ascension"" and ""Dracula 3: Legacy"" feel as if they have no relation to the first film, I disagree with these people.  Clearly if you watch them all together you can easily see the relation between each of these films and how the overall story flows wonderfully from one film to another, a quality that most horror franchises never achieve or aspire to.

This has been an entertaining series of films, that has done an excellent job of tweaking the legend of Dracula to make him more menacing for the new generation.  If ""Dracula 3: Legacy"" is to be the final installment in the `Dracula 2000' series, making it a trilogy, then I am completely satisfied.  If Dimension Films and the director choose to continue on with this series, and at the end of the movie there is potential to take this franchise in a completely new direction or do a spin-off series, as long as the quality of future installments stays on the same level as these films then I will definitely be watching.

""Dracula 3: Legacy"" is rated R for violence, language, and brief nudity.",1121731200,5,4157,4.729916897506925

Viewers who are vampire fans will find this movie entertaining.  Non-vampire fans will find this less entertaining.  The acting was pretty good considering this is a direct to DVD offering.

There are a couple of short interviews and a good commentary with the DVD.

Overall, I would actually give this a 3.5 stars, and with the ending, felt satisfied with the resolution.  In fact, I would be up for a Dracula 4.",1121212800,4,651,4.8108108108108105
2244718,3,B0007US7D0,"Although the title might suggest otherwise, ""Dracula III: The Legacy"" is not the final part of a trilogy but rather the second half of a story begun in ""Dracula II: The Ascension.""  In other words, you do not need to go back to ""Dracula 2000,"" because there is really nothing in that movie that has anything to do with these other two.  This may or may not have anything to do with the audacious but rather ludicrous idea that the reason vampires loath Christian symbols is that Dracula is really (wait for it) Judas Iscariot, but except for the fact that at the end of ""Dracula 2000"" the title character is a charred corpse and at the start of ""Dracula II"" he is a charred corpse, there is really nothing else to connect the dots (and for what it is worth, yes, I buy the explanation for why Dracula looks different in each of these films).

When we go to the ""to be continued"" end of ""Dracula II,"" Luke (Jason London) is desperate to find out what happened to the woman of his affections, Elizabeth Blaine (Diane Neal).  Luke is traveling with Father Uffizi (Jason Scott Lee), a vampire killer who uses a scythe to decapitate the undead.  Uffizi remains at odds with the Church because his superior, Cardinal Siqueros (Roy Scheider), insists that the goal is not just to kill vampires but to try saving their souls as well.  Father Uffizi and Luke are making their way through the Romanian countryside where they have to worry not only about vampires, but revolutionaries and other people with guns.  They discover a British TV reporter, Julia Hughes (Alexandra Westcourt), who though she was covering the war but has stumbled upon Dracula's plot to use the locals to stock his blood cellar.  The whole concern about the scientific properties of vampire blood and the emphasis on all of those ancient Eastern European superstitions regarding vampires now take a back seat to rescuing Elizabeth and stopping the orgy of blood sucking taking place over at the Dracula place.

This 2005 film is again directed by Patrick Lussier, who co-wrote the script with Joel Soisson.  Lee is certainly a compelling lead figure, and London manages to provide the comic relief without becoming laughable in the wrong way, but the problem is that in a Dracula movie the big bad vampire should pop up for more than the conclusion.  Granted, the film really is more about Uffizi to the point where you wonder why it has to be a Dracula film.  But then it would be too much of a Blade rip-off.  At this point it reminds me more of the ""Hellraiser"" direct to video releases where Pinhead usually shows up just at the end.  If you are going to go this route then you really need the journey to be a lot more interesting, but what we have here is nothing like going off to see Marlon Brando in ""Apocalypse Now.""

Lussier filmed both ""Dracula II"" and ""Dracula III"" at the same time in Romania, but for some reason I have not bothered to investigate we have had to wait all this time for this direct to video release.  The production values are pretty good (you get your money's worth in Romania apparently) and I liked doing a contemporary film back on Dracula's home turf.  But Rutger Hauer is not simply wasted, his performance is counter-productive.  Ultimately the whole idea here is that Uffizi is arriving at a personal crucible, and the Dracula he finds at the end is not worthy of the moment, especially given the ending they want to go with for the movie (I was going to say for the series as well, but who knows: they might be trying to squeeze a few quarts of blood out of this storyline).",1121126400,10,3578,4.5640625
8051891,4,B0007US7D0,"I don't really like vampire movies. The standard vampire now is a 20th century invention and has been done to death. Usually badly. But I trusted Wes  Craven to make a competent horror movie, so I took a fly on the first one, and was glad to watch the others. He does keep your interest, and gives the subject all the respect it deserves. Most vampire movies fail in that they take themselves at all seriously. (True Blood being a notable exception, and being worth watching goes right along with that.)
In this one, it was especially nice to see Rutger Hauer reprise his masterful and career defining role from ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer."" (Probably the best vampire movie of all time. Not the TV show. The movie.)

On one level I did enjoy seeing the continuation/culmination of these movies. Having said that, the first is far better than #2 and #3. #3 Does have its fun moments, don't get me wrong. But on a certain level it just felt like it was slapped together, they got some money  for Rutger Hauer who was great but sort of wasted.

I suppose for me this felt like a ""C"" movie over a ""B"" movie. Was sort of fun while watching it but in retrospect I wouldn't watch again. Could be a good late Friday/Saturday night ""what the heck"" rental.

Yes, dear old ancient Dracula has regenerated one more time and opted to turn into an old geezer with very little tooth to his performance (Rutger Hauer).  Accents may come and go, pusses too for that matter, but we're expected to accept this as par for the course where Dracula is concerned.  He went from young(ish) and vital to old and worn out in the space of a single movie and no, it doesn't make any sense.  They also bothered to bring back vampire Elizabeth (Diane Neal) from the second installment.  She is still with the old vamp (even though he's definitely seen better days), prompting Luke to mount a rescue attempt (although the impracticality of rescuing a vampire......to what end?).  The exotic locations definitely help this final entry in the Dracula saga as presented by co-author and director Patrick Lussier.  The highlight for me was the vampire circus performers.  Otherwise, more of the same from Jason Scott Lee, a grim and lackluster performance as the now renegade vampire hunter (no longer sanctioned by the church).
