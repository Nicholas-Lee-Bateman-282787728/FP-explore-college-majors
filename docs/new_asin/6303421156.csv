642327,5,6303421156,"I believe that the Cinder Path is an excellent choice for your viewing enjoyment. This film features many extraordinary actors that give extraordinary performances. Cathrine Zeta-Jones(Mask of Zorro) and Maria  Miles(Cold Comfort Farm) co-star in this lovely BBC production. I would not  recommend this film for children primarily because the story might be to  intense for the little ones. I would gladly explain it in detail but I  don't want to spoil it for you!  If I were to rate this film, it would be  no more than PG, yet if you are weary of PG films, don't be hesitant to get  this one. It is a fine dramatic film that you will enjoy and recommend to  friends in the near future.  I strongly urge you to purchase this film. It  is a classic that will be enjoyed by everyone!",918086400,4,783,4.5285714285714285

642384,2,6303421156,"I bought this DVD based on the reviews and what sounded like a promising storyline; I really expected it to become one of my favorites, however, that is not the case.  Almost everyone in this story is hateful and cruel (reminds me of Wuthering Heights, in that respect), but without any reason for their being so. The main character, Charlie, is a nice guy, but everyone in his family treats him horribly. Victoria is the scandalous rich girl he marries. Catherine Zeta-Jones's portrayal of Victoria reminds me somewhat of her role as Eustacia Vye in The Return of the Native (which I love!). But here, she's very one-dimensional: haughty, mean, and manipulative, and without any of the sympathetic qualities she brought to Eustacia. I don't feel the movie makes it understandable to the viewer how Charlie could actually marry her; in the same way, I also feel the ""romance"" between Charlie and Victoria's sister is completely unbelievable. I doubt I'll be watching this again anytime soon, if ever.",1432080000,2,1000,4.9523809523809526

I liked that there were several separate stories that i could watch over a period of time.  At this time i have watched five of the eight DVD set and so far they have held my interest but find each one dark and violent laced, and The story lines become predictable after the first DVD. .  My husband even became interested in one of the stories and he said wow there is more violent scenes in these and you usually don't like that in your dramas.  I agree.

Most of her heroines begin life as not loved.  There are lots of not so nice men in the stories. The Cinder Path is full of rich characters. Most notice that Catherine Zeta-Jones is in it, but she is the weakest character. It takes place just before WWI breaks out and carries you through the war.
  I particularly like her stories because they deal with the middle and lower classes. The films stay true to the periods. They are not Up Stairs, Down Stairs. They concentrate on the challenges of adversity.",1301356800,2,681,4.658333333333333

642543,5,6303421156,"Koch Vision and BBC presents ""THE CATHERINE COOKSON ANTHOLOGY"" (1995) (1259 mins/Color) (Dolby Digital) --- Dame Catherine Ann Cookson was an English author --- Cookson became Britain's most widely read novelist, while remaining a relatively low-profile figure in the world of celebrity writers --- Her books were inspired by her deprived youth in North East England, the setting for her novels.

Cookson took up writing as a form of therapy to tackle her depression, and joined Hastings Writers' Group --- Her first novel, Kate Hannigan, was published in 1950 --- Though it was labelled a romance, she expressed discontent with the stereotype --- Her books were, she said, historical novels about people and conditions she knew --- Cookson had little to do with the London literary circus --- She was always more interested in practicing the art of writing --- Her research could be uncomfortable - going down a mine, for instance, because her heroine came from a mining area --- Having in her youth wanted to write about ""above stairs"" in grand houses, she later and successfully concentrated on people ground down by circumstances, taking care to know them well.

Cookson went on to write almost 100 books, selling more than 123 million copies of her books, her works being translated into at least 20 languages --- She also authored books under the pseudonyms Catherine Marchant and a name derived from her childhood name, Katie McMullen --- She remained the most borrowed author from public libraries in the UK for more than 20 years, only losing the title in 2004, which is testament to the ongoing popularity of her novels.(From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

Here are the seven films featured in the eight-disc The Catherine Cookson Anthology, a few are as described on the box set's gatefold:

1.  The Cinder Path - (12 February 1995)

2.  Colour Blind - (16 December 1998)
Bridget seriously offends her conservative family for marrying an African sailor. After being accused of murder, her husband is forced to leave town. As their daughter grows up, she must learn to cope with the racism surrounding her.

3.  A Dinner of Herbs - (24 November 2000)
Hal was just a boy when his father was murdered by the ruthless Dan Bannerman. Now, with a family of his own, Hal discovers that the man his daughter hopes to marry is none other than Bannerman's grandson --- Filmed on location in the north of England, ""A Dinner of Herbs"" is an unforgettable mix of murder, passion and revenge!

4.  The Girl - (16 February 1996)
""The Girl"" focuses on a young woman who must overcome emotional and physical obstacles to finally come into the life she deserves. This tale is no different. The performances are excellent, and the costuming and locations equally well done. The acting is top notch, and the scenery and production are beautiful.

642545,5,6303421156,"Set in the rural areas around Newcastle during the years 1913-1918, this impressive dramatization of Cookson's work centers on the personal struggles of a wealthy young land owner (Charlie) who is seen by many around him as a weakling and utter failure until he is thrown into the cauldron of military service on the Western Front and is forced by circumstances to fight and lead or perish.  Much of his inspiration and will to survive comes from the love and devotion of Nellie, the troubled younger sister of his unfaithful, stunningly beautiful wife Victoria.

Although the starring roles are played ably by Lloyd Owen and Catherine Zeta-Jones, the most memorable and arresting performance was delivered by Maria Miles as Nellie.  Maria Miles brought her character to life and graced her with a beauty that surpassed even that of Catherine Zeta-Jones.  In fact, the character of Nellie emerges from personal depression to become one of the genuinely strong and likeable figures in of the Cookson series (and I have seen them all).",1204156800,13,1033,5.023391812865497
642546,4,6303421156,"The Cinder Path

It's all vanity ... when we lose sight of love
[150 minutes - genre: drama]

This 85 min. drama movie shows the intricacies of love, materialism, hasty marriage decision, war, lust, envy, and hatred in the life of neighboring families.  Charlie grows up being overpowered by his father's decisions and the expectations of his family to marry a neighbor's daughter (Victoria), all for material gain (his family would expand their land territory and she would increase her family's treasure chest).  After his father's death, Charlie grows up: learning how to run a farm, and how to fight in battle, and how to care for his comrades on the front (the Great War).  His greatest achievement is realizing who he really loves - Nellie.

While realizing that his marriage to Victoria (Nellie's sister) was a sham, that his sister had robbed him and left his estate naked, and that he had killed a man - Ginger - in cold blood (because of built up hate), Charlie breaks down in front of his future wife, Nellie and says:  ""The truth is too much for me.""

This great family drama (that portrays the vices of people, evil intentions, and ugly face of reality in our world) has a positive outcome after Charlie has a cathartic moment:
""The most frightening thing in life is to come face to face with yourself!""

Now, after a bloody marriage, bloody war, and blood-dried estate farm, Charlie and Nellie can start life afresh.  Time does not wait for anyone.  If only he had made wiser decisions in life, earlier.",1173744000,7,1517,4.708333333333333

He lets his father bully him, covers up one murder, and later commits another; he marries, goes to war, and gets a commission because other people tell him to, not through any will of his own. His wife warns him that she won't be faithful, and he clearly doesn't love her, but still gets angry when she does exactly what she told him she would. Worst of all, he treats his own sister like a hired hand. Near the end when she steals from him and emigrates I cheered for her.

It wasn't helped by the lead actor looking like a deer caught in headlights in every scene.",1142812800,8,650,4.158730158730159

As his father met with an ""accident"" and died, young  Charlie was ill-equipped to manage the farm. He is pressured into a  loveless marriage with the haughty and faithless Victoria, leaving her  sister Nellie, who secretly loves him, heartbroken. As World War I breaks  out he is forced to join the British Army and the horrors and hardship of  the frontlines finally let him become a man of strength and character. He  is now able to overcome the heartbreak, blackmail, cruelty, revenge and  deception to ultimately find his true love.
The Cinder Path is based on  the bestselling novel of Catherine Cookson. If you love period Jane  Austen-like romantic drama this one is for you. Why did I not give five  stars? I did not like the extensive war and battle-scenes. Furthermore, I  thought it a shame that this DVD does not feature any extras (no  widescreen, foreign languages, subtitels, behind the scenes information).
